2395532,5,B000AXWGRC,"Ducktales is Disney's first ever cartoon series. It consisted of 100 episodes. It has tremendous underscore provided by composer Ron Jones, and is one of the most entertaining, well written television cartoon series ever!

I can't imagine why the pilot episodes would not be included! They were so good, much better then even Ducktales the Movie (which was a disapointment because it lacked the 'ducktales' style - it was a differnet production completely). Would be great if it contained additional features, but highly doubt it.

Lets hope Disney releases future episodes, including The Movie on DVD.

Highly anticipating this release!

-The biggest fan of Ducktales!",1126915200,4,669,5.3428571428571425
2395533,5,B000AXWGRC,"""DuckTales"" was one of my favorite shows as a child. Being lucky enough to have grown up at an age when Disney released wonderful animated shows like ""DuckTales"", ""Gummi Bears"", ""TaleSpin"", ""Chip `n Dale Rescue Rangers"" and ""The Little Mermaid"", it is sad to see that the Disney Channel now airs shows that are hardly worth watching, when compared to the ones mentioned.

First aired on September 18, 1987, the episodes revolves around the adventures of Scrooge McDuck (the wealthy billionaire of Duckburg), his nephews Huey, Dewey and Louie, their pilot LaunchPad McQuack, the nephews nanny Mrs. Beakley and her daughter Webby. The main reason I loved watching this series was because it contained humor, adventure, good animation, and above all, a moral to each episode, hence making it fun for both kids and adults to enjoy.

I hope this is not true, but I heard that this DVD set will not contain the 5 part pilot episode called ""Treasure of the Golden Suns"", where we get to see how the nephews come to live with Scrooge, and how Mrs. Beakley and Webby join the family.

However, it would still be great to have this classic show as a part of my DVD Collection. I hope Disney decides to release the rest of their animated shows that aired from the late 80s on DVD Volume sets as well.",1126742400,70,1289,4.644736842105263

I've heard that the DVD set of DuckTales may contain 27 episodes in chronological order but from what I saw it may not have the Treasure of the Golden Suns mini series which started the series and introduced everyone.

I grew up on this show & my VHS tapes are wearing out!  It's a great show for kids & fans of the classic Disney Ducks.  DuckTales launched a spin-off called Darkwing Duck & even had characters like Launchpad McQuack & Webby (aka Webbigail VanderQuack) as major Disney characters that have appeared at & on merchandise for the theme parks!

I was expecting these cartoons to come out in like 2009 or 2010 or so as like a 20th Anniversary edition, but I'm so glad Disney decided to release cartoons like ""Chip and Dale"" and ""DuckTales"" like now!

Even better is that we get these DVDs first! Which is good, because Disney always releases the good stuff on DVD in Europe and Australia first, I wonder why? But anyways, expect a whole lot of episodes (about 22 or so) on this volume, games, and a whole lot more!

2395670,5,B000AXWGRC,"I do love it - but if you're reading this you probably already do too so you don't need commentary about the show.  It's just striking how Huey Dewey Louie & Webby were so innocent, yet likable little ""kids""- but the new series has them as modern typical kid wiseasses.  Is this a mirror into today's society, where our kids are basically a-holes who think they're way smarter than they are?

Now about the video quality, I was surprised, even for SD, how grainy the quality is. Even more, I wasn't expected a Disney XD logo and station bumper - it's like it was recorded off an airing on cable and digitized off a DVR.

BUT - the DVDs as you've noticed do not have all the episodes - the digital ""seasons"" have all the episodes straight through to the end. So pick your poison. I've committed myself to the idea Amazon ain't goin' anywhere so digital it is.",1513468800,,858,4.377358490566038

2395706,4,B000AXWGRC,"All I have to say is that if you're a fan of the old Duck Tales cartoon, then I highly recommend getting started on watching this.  This show is clearly done by fans of the original, with just the right upgrades that makes keeps it fresh and open to new ideas, while still remaining true to its adventurous spirit.

The animation is amazing (in my opinion)!  The comic-book look and feel, with the old fashion cartoon style, was a genius move.

The characters are all done very well.  The best upgrade being Webby.  No offense to her original counter-part, but I never like the character before this new awesome version came along.  She's a mix of Mable from Gravity Falls and.... eh.... okay, fine, just Mable from Gravity Falls.  But she's still awesome!  The triplets of Huey, Dewey and Louie are all given different personalities, allowing for more development and identity.  The voice-actor for Scrooge was a great choice.  Others like Launchpad, Glomgold, Donald Duck, Mrs. Beakley are all given upgrades and/or changes that work in their favor.  Though, to be honest, I'm still having a hard time understanding Donald.

But the biggest addition to the story would have to be... actually, you know what?  I'm not even going to say it here.  It's so awesome genius of the creators to bring in this additional story-arc that it has to be seen in order to experience the excitement.

My biggest and only problems with the show is that it seems to be focusing more on the 'once-a-week/episode', side-adventures.  Don't get me wrong, those are fine and great, but they don't seem to bring much to anything, aside from being fun adventures.  I know Gravity Falls did the same, but it at least used those once-a-week/episode adventures to help explore and develop its world and characters.  We do get that once and a while, but for the most part they seem to just happen just for the sake of adventure and fun.  Now, that doesn't mean they're bad.  Quite the opposite!  It's a lot of fun.

The 2017 Ducktales reboot is one of the very few that I can say lives up to the original source material and is a lot of fun.  You can catch the first episode for free on YouTube (until Disney says otherwise) and see what all the fuss is about.  And be prepared for that theme song to haunt your thoughts once more!",1508630400,,2304,4.601965601965602

2395725,4,B000AXWGRC,"The re-boot/re-imaging of every child of the 80's cartoon favorite
Returns after 30 years was it to late though?

While this re-make isn't by any means horrible or even bad
Some of the magic of the original has been lost

The V/O cast do a very good job for the most part
some of the actors were only chose to draw a audience
I honestly don't think Millennials will care about DuckTales
This series is very much a generations thing!
If you grew up during this time
You'll have plenty of great memories from what Disney was doing in the late 80's early 1990's
Cast members include:
David Tennant  ( Scrooge McDuck)  Does a close to perfect job (I would think even Alan Young would be supportive of Tennant's version of  Scrooge) If he was still with us RIP Alan Young
Kate Micucci  ( Webbigail Vanderquack) also does a phenomenal  v/o this version of Webbi is actually better then the original
Danny Pudi  (Huey)
Ben Schwartz  (Dewey)
Bobby Moynihan  ( Louie)
While the team behind this series tried to distinguish each one of the nephews apart from each other
There voices run together i honestly can't tell the difference much like the original series the 3 nephews are a bit generic
They tried to update them in very cheap/silly ways
Beck Bennett  ( Launchpad McQuack) terrible casting choice he doesn't sound right at all Terence McGovern should have been brought back to do Launchpad not sure why this dude was given this part besides his connection to SNL he is sleepwalking and it's a massive waste
Toks Olagundoye  ( Mrs. Beakley) at first i didn't like the way she sounds But, it did grow on me

Tony Anselmo  (Donald Duck) The only original cast member asked to return which is odd
Tony does a solid version of Donald
Keith Ferguson  (Flintheart Glomgold) a stand out all around his voice is perfect it's super over the top and has a lot of major Kinetic energy!
It's a real shame he looks horribly animated
Margo Martindale  ( Ma Beagle) Margo is another great choice for Ma Beagle she gives a outstanding performance
But, the look of Ma Beagle in this version of DuckTales is God awful so cheap it is a insult to such a fine actresses
Eric Bauza  ( Big Time Beagle) Horrible the original version of the Beagle Boys (DuckTales 1987) was awesome mostly due to the v/o actors Big Time vocally mimicked Moe Howard and Burger Beagle sounded like Curly,  from the 3 Stooges and it worked brilliantly
Each Beagle Boy had there own look and sound!

Catherine Tate  ( Magica De Spell) I have mixed thoughts on Tate doing this voice Catherine Tate is super underrated I hope she does the character the proper way I know she can but, the V/O engineers i don't think watched the original series

The animation on the other hand is all over the place
Some could argue the series was given a set budget
But, if that's the case why pay somewhat big name actors to do Huey, Dewey, and  Louie
When the three pretty much sound the same
At times it looks very good other times it looks very cheap
Almost all the main cast of characters look right for the most part
even though both
 Webbigail and  Mrs. Beakley have a major overhaul in there appearance I can dig there new looks
along with Gyro Gearloose who has been changed a lot now much younger and a bit mad scientist
The animation team dropped the ball on  Ma Beagle and the Beagle Boys
they all look horrible as though a 5th grade student designed them
Not sure why they didn't copy the look from the original series
 Flintheart Glomgold also was animated way ""Off"" and looks super rushed

It might look like I'm being overly critical of this new series
I am mostly cause the original series means a lot to me
I think it's awesome they dusted off this old IP and actually made a remake
But, I'm sure the biggest ratings draw is from woman and men (30-45) That also grew up on the original series
That care a lot about the characters and might even try to introduce it to there kids, nieces, and nephews
I honestly don't see this being a major hit with kids though
It might say TV Y7 (but, most kids are not going to give this series a chance)
In 2017 there is way more stuff for kids to do
I'm a bit surprised this was even financed since tv has changed so much since 1987

While it's far from perfect it's a massive love letter to the original with all sorts of inside gags and old references
Worth the time to watch and relive your childhood
When the Disney Afternoon was a national syndicated juggernaut that helped change the face of the afternoon tv landscape  for years to come

As of this review, there are 4 episodes and I think it's safe to say this series is even better than the original, and I loved the original when I was a kid.
There's action, great writing, and blabberin' blatherskite is it funny. Webby is no longer the shy tagalong that brings things down. Huey, Dewey and Louie have some individuality now(great joke on that in 4th episode). Scrooge is based more on the original comics than the original animated cartoon, which lends to some interesting character. Plus, Donald Duck is more involved in this version than before!
The art style is different, yes, but you get used to it quickly. It's a playful look and well-done. This is, of course, subjective and your mileage may vary.
The nephews' voices do sound too adult for child characters. That's certainly a drawback, but thankfully everything else makes up for it so it doesn't lose a star.

2395954,5,B000AXWGRC,"This is such a wonderful set of Duck Tales episodes!  Sure, it's not in chronological order.  I don't remember that being an issue when I was watching as a kid.  They don't need to be seen in order...they are completely 100% stand alone episodes!  Not sure why they were released this way, but I have no complaints.

Lately I've been trying to get my kids interested in cartoons that I watched when I was a kid.  Duck Tales, Dark Wing Duck, Rescue Rangers, Tail Spin, etc. Youtube is a good introduction, but the ability to buy these on DVD is fantastic.  My kids (ages 3 and 5) are entertained even though these are drastically different from cartoons that are made today.  They seem to really enjoy Duck Tales, so we bought this DVD for a recent road trip.  This bought us several hours of viewing time in the car.  The 3 year old is still a little young to pay attention to an entire movie (even an 80 minute Disney movie).  He gets bored in the middle.  Twenty two minute episodes of these will hold his attention...and they even get some giggles!

As a parent, it's a bonus that I get to rewatch some of the cartoons I grew up with.  There are so many jokes that I didn't appreciate as a kid (like the space episode when the actor/astronaut speaks like William Shatner the entire time?  Hilarious!)

Also, I've seen that Disney is going to start making and releasing new episodes of Duck Tales in 2017.  What better introduction than watching a few of the classics?  I these DVDs, they're packed with tons of episodes, and they've been wonderful for road trips.  Highly recommend for nostalgic reasons!",1465171200,5,1607,4.517361111111111

2396031,4,B000AXWGRC,"While I loved spin off series Darkwing Duck, I never had seen an episode of Disney's DuckTales.  I changed that when I borrowed the Volume 1 DVD release from a friend.

This was an animated show from the late 80's and very early 90's.  It focused on Scrooge McDuck (voiced by Alan Young.)  He's the richest duck in the world, a title he takes very seriously since, while he enjoys his wealth, he still tries to get more.  He is currently taking care of his great nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie (all voiced by Russi Taylor).  They live in the town of Duckburg, although their adventures take them all over the world.

And just what kind of adventures do they have?  Well, they fend off several attempts by the Beagle Boys (Frank Welker among others) or Magica de Spell (June Foray) to steal Scrooge's fortune using shadows, a cloner maker, and a transportation device to name a few ways.  Flintheart Glomgold (Hal Smith), another rich duck, tries to become richer than Scrooge.  He even frames Scrooge for a robbery and sends him to Aquatraz.  Scrooge and the boys also jet around the world in all kinds of adventures to recover a magic lamp or the crown of Genghis Khan.  There are also some time travel adventures involving ancient Greece or medieval Europe.

Really, you never know quite what you'll find in an episode of the show.  All you really know is you'll get an adventure and some laughs.  While some episodes are funnier than others, this show does try to combine the two, and usually succeeds.  While one episode dwells on really bad jokes, another has lots of Shakespeare related puns.  The target children probably won't get the jokes, but adults certainly will.

It took me a few episodes to get into the show, but once I did, I began to enjoy the characters and fun nature of the stories.  However, I do feel that I missed something coming to the show as an adult.  I found a few of the episodes weak and predictable.  Others were fun magic that I got caught up in.

Another problem I had with this set is the fact that the 5 part pilot isn't included.  While the rest of the episodes are in random order as well, it doesn't hurt anything since each contains a stand alone adventure.  I would have really liked to see how everything started.

The voice cast does a great job, sometimes taking on two or more characters in an episode.  Yet everyone sounds distinct.

Likewise, the animation is good.  Yes, it's a smaller budget than the normal Disney animated feature, but it still allows you to get caught up in the story with ease.

This season set consists of 27 episodes equally distributed on 3 discs.  The show was originally produced in full frame and stereo sound, and that's how they are preserved here.  Andthat's it.  There's nothing in the way of extras.

While I'm not quite as hooked on DuckTales as I thought I might be, I did enjoy my trip through Volume 1.  If you like fun animated shows, I bet you will enjoy this one, too.",1433116800,,2957,4.506591337099811

2396035,5,B000AXWGRC,Love it! This was my all time favorite cartoon as a kid. I was super excited to relive the adventures again. And surprisingly life and 20+ years will make you forget each detail so it's kinda like watching them all over again for the first time. My 6 year old step daughter and 4 year old niece are just as  excited to watch them as I am! Great for family night or when your babysitting your very active and hard to slow down 4 year old niece. So many episodes for the money!!!,1432080000,,477,4.129032258064516
2396036,4,B000AXWGRC,"I  like  the  show.  &  I'm  not  just  talking  about  Volume 1,  I  mean  all  3  volumes.  &  there  are  plenty  of  episodes  I  do  remember  that  just  aren't  here  in  these  Volumes.  Its  too  bad  they  couldn't  have  included  every  episode  that  was  ever  made,  Instead  of  only  giving  us  the  episodes  they  think  is  most  popular.  Definitely  episodes  missing!  All  I  got  is  the  memories.  &  I  guess  I'll  never  see  them  again.  I  was  hoping  to  see  the  ones  I  remembered  &  saw  some  of  them,  not  quite  all  of  them.  I  do  recall  memories  of  some  episodes  that  aren't  in  none  of  these  3  volumes,  (one  is  where  Scrooge  is  trying  to  return  an  idol  or  something  to  the  place  he  found  it,  if  he  doesn't  do  it  at  a  specific  time  the  entire  planet  will  turn  to  gold  &  some  of  them  were  frozen  for  a  while.)  (&  in  another  one  Scrooge  gets  amnesia.) If  your  looking  for  one  of  the  best  shows  I  knew  from  the  80's  this  is  truly  it!  At  least  from  Disney  I  mean,  not  even  the  Smurf's  can  top  this  show.  My  favorite  characters  are  Launch Pad  Mac Quack  &  Gyro.  Scrooges  genious  inventer. Scrooge  has  his  rivals  Flint Heart Glom Gold  who  I  think  was  the  richest  one  in  Duckburg  before  Scrooge  came.  &  he'll  do  anything  to  beat  scrooge.  Then  there  is  someone  who's  nothing  but  interested  in  his  Lucky  Dime,  Magica  De  Spell.  Scrooge  is  real  picky  about  losing  one  cent. He  can't  stand  losing  a  penny.  He's  worried  he'll  lose  his  pride. Among  all  the  characters  there  are  in  the  show,  we  got  Flint Heart Glom Gold, Magica  De Spell, The Beagle Boys,  Gyro, Launch Pad, Doofus, Webby, Duckworth,  Mrs Beakley. They  go  treasure  hunting.  &  Scrooge  tells  his  story  about  how  he  got  rich.  They  go  on  all  sorts  of  interesting  adventures.  Duck Tales  is  the  kind  of  show  I  don't  think  you'd  ever  get  tired  of.  I  think  both  my  nieces  would  love  this  show.
Ya'll  notice  Huey Duey  &  Luey  are  quite  a  bit  different  than  they  were  in  the  everyday  shows  we  use  to  watch  when  they  were  with  their  uncle Donald?  They're  not  as  Mischievous. Scrooge  deals  with  monsters  that  we  can  only  imagine.  &  has  perfect  fantasies.  Its  silly  some  of  the  situations  they  get  into.
They  go  on  all  sorts  of  exciting  adventures.  A  lot  is  which  of  some  very  strange  looking  creatures,  &  prove  that  even  though  often  they're  in  tough  binds,  they  somehow  plot  their  escape  or  gain  the  advantage.  &  of  course  Scrooges  name  callings  when  he  gets  upset  is  sure  to  make  anyone  laugh.  &  cannot  resist  the  smell  of  money.  He  is  the  only  one  as  far  as  I  know  that's  never  had  problems  with  the  I.R.S.  But  plenty  of  others  out  there  target  him  for  his  money  bin!  In  volume  3  I  didn't  think  Bubba  &  Gizmo  Duck  originally  known  as  Fenton  were  that  popular.
I  think  this  is  truly  one  of  Disney's  best  shows  ever  made!!  Every  day  after  school  we'd  watch  this  show.  &  its  a  perfect  way  to  just  kill  time.
(Skip  the  other  show,  Darkwing Duck)  I've  seen  it  &  I  didn't  enjoy  it  as  much  as  Ducktales.",1431388800,,3405,4.26775956284153

Quality was a bit sub-par as far as DVDs go, not much in the way of up-scaling but noticeably better than VHS quality. Maybe im just spoiled with all the netflix/blu-ray I've been watching.

2396103,5,B000AXWGRC,"I do not know about you, but I can not stand watching most of the current cartoons or shows that my daughters enjoy. There is usually a very superficial story that teaches some in your face lesson, and very little imagination. My oldest daughter turned three this past winter and for one of our movie nights I picked up Season One of DuckTales. She loves it, and so do I. I was a child in the 90's and remember all of these episodes (ok, so I might have been raised by a TV in my bedroom).

The great thing about this show and collection is how imaginative it is, and there is always a good moral lesson (although it doesn't smack you in the face like a big piece of salami). We have since picked up Chip n' Dale's Rescue Rangers and plan to start collecting these shows (TaleSpin, Goof Troop, Gummi Bears, and if I am very persuasive Darkwing Duck).

It's a nice bit of nostalgia that I'm happy to share with her now that I'm older. The humor in these older cartoons may be a bit dry for modern audiences but I find that they are more wholesome than the cartoons my younger sister is now watching.

She loves the series and watched a couple episodes back to back.  She really enjoyed Launchpads character.  I should have known she would.  She loves planes and he is a pilot.  If your on the fence about this series I say give it a go.  You can never really predict what your little one is going to love or hate but at a good little show with a lot of adventure.

We bought just the one volume to see if it was as good as our memory.  Comes with 3 discs.  What I don't like is the way they did not separate each episode individually if you want to just select PLAY, so instead you have to remember which chapter you left off on (each episode is I think 4 chapters).",1380758400,,446,4.151162790697675

That and Alan Young, the voice of Scrooge McDuck.  He essentially sounds like Sean Connery as a duck!  The stories look like they were pulled straight from the comics.  All the classic cast is there.  I remember when this was on TV in 1987. It was one of the better shows one could watch with their family.  All in all it's one of the best Disney adaptions out there.  I like the duck world and any fan of good animated cartoons will love this economically feasible collection.

2396151,5,B000AXWGRC,"Now don't get me wrong it's still a great show.  It's just not the alpha dog I remember it to be.  Like I said in my Rescue Rangers review, in my favorite DA shows the jokes are funnier, the guest characters more interesting & the heroes more sympathetic which makes their adventures even more exciting (especially in Gummi Bears whenever they travel to an ancient city of theirs & learn more about their past).  But it's still very entertaining, for the most part.  The animation is great (when it's by TMS, though Wang did churn out a few good-looking episodes), the soundtrack & voices are excellent (this has my favorite voice cast of any Disney show except for Gummi Bears & Gargoyles) and some there are some really good stories here & there that totally make it worth my while.  Here's a review of every episode with synopsizes from Wikipedia.

1.  Send In the Clones:  Magica DeSpell gets the Beagle Boys to help her steal the Number One Dime, disguising them as the nephews.  We all know by now about the exclusion of the pilot, and that really annoys me because I don't like this episode very much.  It has its moments, my favorite being the battle with the potions at the end, but there are too many moments where the characters should have realized something was up.  C

2.  Sphinx For the Memories:  An ancient Egyptian Civilization abducts Donald so that he can host a spirit of a Pharaoh.  Much better.  Any episode with Donald Duck in it is good.  A

3.  Where No Duck Has Gone Before:  Gyro's props for a science fiction television show accidentally launch the cast into space, and Launchpad becomes the hero when it is realized that he is the only real pilot on board.  A great Star Trek parody.  A

4.  Armstrong:  Gyro presents the McDuck household with a robot named Armstrong to do their work for them. However, the robot decides it would rather work for itself.  A

5. Robot Robbers:  After the incident with Armstrong, Gyro builds giant human-operated robots for Glomgold, only to have them be stolen and operated by Ma Beagle and the Beagle Boys.  This was always one of my favorites, because Flintheart Glomgold is my favorite villain in the series & I love anything with giant robots in it.  A+

6.  Magica's Shadow War:  Magica's plot to steal the Number One Dime using her own shadow goes awry when her shadow develops a mind of its own.  This episode is superior to Send In the Clones.  It was pretty creepy to me as a kid.  A+

7.  Masters of the Djinj:  Scrooge and Glomgold race for mastership of Aladdin's genie.  I have to admit, this is much better than the Rescue Rangers rip-off A Lad In His Lamp.  A+

8.  Hotel Strangeduck:  Scrooge turns a castle once owned by mad scientist into a hotel, but he doesn't believe that the place is haunted.  A+

9.  The Lost Crown of Genghis Khan:  Scrooge goes searching for a crown in the Himalayas, which is guarded by a snow beast.  B+

10.  Duckman of Aquatraz:  Scrooge is framed for stealing a painting from Glomgold's art gallery and sent to Aquatraz.  A

11.  The Money Vanishes:  The Beagle Boys steal Gyro's handheld teleporter and use it to steal Scrooge's fortune.  B

12.  Sir Gyro de Gearloose:  Gyro, tired of being looked upon as a ""gadget man"", invents a time machine and uses it to go back in time to the Middle Ages.  By far the best episode without Scrooge in it.  A+

13.  Dinosaur Ducks:  Scrooge and Launchpad explore a land where dinosaurs still live, but the kids tag along against Scrooge's directions to the contrary.  C

14.  Hero For Hire:  After being fired by Scrooge, Launchpad is tricked by the Beagle Boys into performing a series of bank robberies disguised as movie scenes.  A

15.  Superdoo!:  Having a hard time at camp, Doofus accidentally finds a stolen alien crystal that grants him numerous super powers.  C

16.  Maid of the Myth:  Mrs. Beakley is abducted by Vikings and it is up to Scrooge and the others to rescue her.  A good episode, but it's nowhere near as good as Rescue Rangers' A Case of Stageblight.  B

17.  Down and Out in Duckburg:  A family debt causes Scrooge to lose his entire fortune, sending his entire family into the poorhouse.  D

18.  Much Ado About Scrooge:  Scrooge and the boys track down a lost play of the famed playwright William Drakespeare.  A

19.  Top Duck:  Launchpad's family comes to visit while the Beagle Boys eye Scrooge's new jet so that they can use it to pilfer his Money Bin.  A+

20.  Pearl of Wisdom:  Scrooge learns that a pearl he bought will grant him infinite wisdom once he takes it back to its homeland.  B+

21.  The Curse of Castle McDuck:  Scrooge, the nephews, and Webby visit Scrooge's ancestral home in Scotland, only to be embroiled in a mystery surrounding Castle McDuck.  A

22.  Launchpad's Civil War:  When going to Virginia for an American Civil War reenactment, Launchpad encounters aged Union veterans who once served under his ancestor, who had lost a battle.  Meanwhile, Doofus and the nephews learn that a businessman is exploiting the reenactments for financial gain.  Launchpad works to avenge his family's honor by rallying the old veterans to a ""rematch"" of sorts against the reenactors.  A-

23.  Sweet Duck of Youth:  Scrooge and the boys head for Florida in search of the fabled Fountain of Youth.  A-

24.  Earth Quack:  Scrooge and the boys discover that the games of an underground civilization are causing earthquakes directly under the Money Bin.  This must have been a popular episode, because at some Disney Stores you can see a Ducktales display based on it.  A

25.  Homer Sweet Homer:  Circe, a sorceress from the past transports Scrooge and the boys back to time of Ancient Greece, where they meet up with Homer.  A

26.  Bermuda Triangle Tangle:  Scrooge seeks to find out why his ships are disappearing in the Bermuda Triangle.  A+

27.  Microducks From Outer Space:  Scrooge misuses an alien size-shifting device, and accidentally ends up shrinking himself, the boys, and Webby.  C

Watching it again, I realize one big weakness is that they don't use the villains nearly often enough.  They have 3 different recurring villains, but they're only in 8 episodes here.  That's not even a third of the volume.  Their episodes don't rock all the time (as seen in Send In the Clones & will be seen in Volume 2), but half of them were A+ & a couple more were A.  I so would have traded lame episodes like Down and Out in Duckburg & Microducks From Outer Space for more episodes with them.  I always wanted to see an episode where Flintheart Glomgold & Magica DeSpell team up as they are my 2 favorite villains in the series, and would have gladly exchanged all the episodes I rated less than B for just that one.  But despite my moaning, this is still a good set.  Two-thirds of it range from A- to A+ and 4 other good episodes besides.  I have to admit this is probably my least favorite Ducktales set, and recommend people who want to relive seeing this show get Volume 2 first, as that has the awesome 5 part pilot on it, then if you like that get this one then Volume 3.",1371945600,,7074,4.543130990415335

2396167,5,B000AXWGRC,"Here's a series that I am reviewing:

It involves three intelligent, trouble-making boys who happen to be the nephews of Donald Duck. Donald can no longer take care of the boys because he wants to join the navy so he turns to his uncle Scrooge for help. After some resistance, his uncle Scrooge takes the boys and that's where the series begins.

Each episode follows uncle Scrooge as he goes on his adventures, tries to educate his grand-nephews and goes about running his business. After all, he didn't become the richest duck in the world sitting on his tail feathers.

He has also since become my favorite Disney character (though I prefer Mickey Mouse). This series also sparked my interest in the 'duck-verse'. Lol. A duck-verse sounds like a funny name

Ducktales is truly a hidden gem. (And uncle Scrooge needs more love!) This is definitely a worthwhile buy whether you're a Disney collector or just an animation enthusiast.

My only real complaint is this: I felt that they really should have released Ducktales in chronological order so the viewers wouldn't get confused as to the order of events. (Yes, the series is semi-story oriented...)",1362268800,,1152,4.887179487179488

2396173,1,B000AXWGRC,"First let me make it clear I grew up watching DuckTales & I love the series, but this DVD set is one of the worst sets of any film or TV show I've ever gotten! I was so excited to get the DVD set I just couldn't wait for it to arrive in my mail box & when it arrived I waited three days to make sure my schedule was clear so I could watch it uninterrupted

Well I watched it, and boy! was I disappointed, why because the DVD playback is awful! it would not upscale correctly & I noticed a lot of blur also jagged lines during playback, and before you say it's my player that's simply Not True I own other standard format animated DVDs & they all look great on my current blu-ray player accept the DuckTales DVD, and when DVD looks bad on a good player it usually means it's not a genuine DVD or it's just a really poor transfer. the box cover Say's that the series digitally remastered well it does not look remastered at all the picture looks like a regular VHS tape transferred to DVD disk

Also I didn't see all of the same episodes that I remember from my childhood, I know it's only Volume 1, but where is the Pilot! ep?? the one where Huey, Dewey & Louie first move in with their uncle Scrooge? also there are no extra features I'm really annoyed at the general quality of this DVD

Normally I'd say avoid this disk set, but sadly this may be the only way to watch this now classic cartoon series because this DVD set is becoming slightly rare and since it no longer airs on TV you may still want to consider buying it anyway because once DVD sales slowdown you may not be able to get your hands on another copy so don't rule out buying it while supplies last, just don't expect more then a few fun eps & a bit of childhood nostalgia because if you expect more then that you'll be as disappointed as I am.",1357862400,3,1811,4.110169491525424

2396184,5,B000AXWGRC,"DuckTales first came on TV in 1987, when I was an older kid (12/13 yrs old), but I watched it regularly back then, and probably much longer than I should have, age-wise.  I loved it back then, and it still holds up really well today.  I recently bought the Season 1 DVD collection for my boys and they watch and enjoy it every day.

Not to sound crotchety, but these were much better shows than the crap they put out today.  The 80's seemed to be the golden age for cartoons.  That's how I feel anyway, having grown up during that time, and I seem to read a lot of similar opinions from others on the retro sites online.

DuckTales exploits all the elements of adventure (danger, foreign travel, new inventions, good vs. evil, etc.), it features flights of fancy (robots, aliens, time travel), it has interesting characters, fun plots and an often dramatic, almost John Williams-like score.  It also manages to inject good virtues like honesty, courage, and friendship, without sounding preachy.

After only owning it for a few weeks, my boys already have favorite episodes, they quote characters, and they sing the theme song.  I loved it when I was a kid.  Now I love sharing it with my kids.",1344556800,,1194,4.589622641509434

But now to the subject at hand. Strangely enough, ""The Treasure of the Golden Suns"" which started the series is not here. (It got placed on volume 2.)

Disc 1 has the good ""Sphinx For the Memories"" where Donald is kidnapped, and a spooky Egyptian mystery unfolds. 'Where No Duck Has Gone Before' is a cute episode where Launchpad and the nephews find themselves in outerspace. 'ArmStrong' + 'Robot Robbers' is a good 2 part episode where Scrooge and his enemy Flint Heart have to put aside their differences to save the day. 'Magica's Shadow War' and 'Hotel Strangeduck' are some good Halloween specials.

The high episode of Disc 2 is ""Much Ado About Scrooge."" Great for Shakespeare fans! Scrooge thinks he may have found a lost play by 'Drakespeare.'

Disc 3 has some really good episodes. In 'Top Duck,' we meet Launchpad's family. 'The Pearl of Wisdom' is a great story about the meaning of true wealth. And 'Bermuda Triangle Tangle' is a nice sea story. One of Scrooge's best lines in reaction to his ship being lost in the Bermuda Triangle: ""Oh no! Why my cargo ships? Why not the loveboat?!""

Like I said. The 3rd Volume is really the best if you are just after some 80s nostalgia. But this 1st set is good too.",1302739200,,1391,4.460629921259843

2396197,5,B000AXWGRC,"In the 80's after Disney struck gold with The Gummi Bears and Wuzzles for syndicated and saturday mornings, they decided to bring Carl Banks's beloved comic strip ""Ducktales"" as a cartoon series. It consist of the richest duck in the world named Scrooge Mcduck (Voiced by Alan Young) who explores many places for treasures and go on various adventures even with his nephews Huey, Dewy and Louie (All voiced by Russi Taylor) along with Launchpad Mcquack who is a cunning but blundering pilot, Gyro (Hal Smith) who is a kind inventor, butler Duckworth who's actually an anthro dog than his last name, Mrs. Beakley who is the maid/cook/nanny and her granddaughter Webby Gale even facing enemies like the Beagle boys, Magica Despell (Voiced by June Foray) to even his arch-rival Flintheart Glumgold (Voiced by Hal Smith).

It became an instant hit that ran from 1987 till 1991 that even spawned a motion picture finale to the series. I grew up watching this show since i was 5 when it came out in 1987 as it was one of my fave cartoons of that time with Real Ghostbusters, Transformers, Thundercats, GI Joe, He-Man, Rescue Rangers, She-Ra, Gummi Bears, Voltron and more. This show still holds up very well in my presence as it appeals to all ages including animation fans who hold it a place in their hearts.

This collection contains some of the first seasons episodes but not the pilot which is in another set as i'll give you what episodes are here.

We start off with ""Send in the Clones"" where sorceress Magica Despell who magically transforms the Beagle Boys into clones of Scrooge's nephews to capture Scrooge's first lucky dime, ""Sphinx For the Memories"" has Donald Duck as a guest star where he is in Egypt kidnapped only to be turned into a king where he must battle a mummy with the help of his uncle with the boys, ""Where No Duck Has Gone Before"" deals with the boys with Launchpad being on their fave TV show but ended up in space for real which is a very ""Galaxy Quest""-like concept that was years before that movie. ""Armstrong"" has Gyro who creates a unique robot that helps people but has a mind of it's own to harm them unless they find a way to destroy it, ""Robot Robbers"" has the Beagle Boys stealing some large robots to use them for robbing banks. ""Magica's Shadow War"" has Magica who uses her shadow to try to steal Scrooge's first lucky time but decides to become an evil mind of it's own then as the episode is followed by ""Master of the Djinni"" where rivals Scrooge and Glumgold fight for Aladdin's magic lamp even if they are sent back in time. ""Hotel Strangeduck"" deals with Scrooge and friends doing business at a rundown yet creepy hotel where it's haunted then finally on Disc 1 is ""The Lost Crown of Genghis Khan"" where Scrooge with Launchpad and the kids go search for the title crown in Everest where they encounter the legendary snow beast.

Disc 2 has ""Duckman of Aquatraz"" where Scrooged is framed for a crime he didn't commit, ""The Money Vanishes"" has the Beagle Boys who steal a ray gun and special spray that can make things disappear and reappear in any location as they want Scrooge's money. ""Sir Gyro De Gearloose"" has Gyro with the three boys back in time in the medieval ages, ""Dinosaur Ducks"" has Scrooge exploring the lost world where caveducks and dinosaurs still exist then followed by ""Hero for Hire"" has Launchpad with Junior Woodchuck scout sidekick Doofus to work for the Beagle Boys on being fake heroes only to do bad things for them. ""Maid of the Myth"" has Mrs. Beakley as an opera singer thus kidnapped by real vikings, ""Down and Out in Duckburg"" has an angry fox who takes over Scrooge's house because his ancestor didn't deliver his own ancestor's marbles long ago thus leaving with family poor but Scrooge must find a way to get his fortune back. ""Much Do About Scrooge"" has an annoying salesman who goes with Scrooge and the boys to an island where Shakespeare has a lost book that wasn't published.

Disc 3 has ""Top Gun"" which is about Launchpad who must try to impress his family by proving he's not a dork as the Beagle boys has plans. ""The Pearl of Wisdom"" has Pete who steals a unique pearl that will give anyone wisdom as Scrooge buys it from him but Pete wants it back, ""Curse of Castle McDuck"" has Scrooge with the kids in Scotland where he was raised as they journey to a haunted castle, ""Launchpad's Civil War"" has Launchpad going to another town where he cast in a Civil war reenactment but is embarrassed of his roots. ""Sweet Duck of Youth"" has Scrooge and others to Florida to the fountain of youth, ""EarthQuack"" has Scrooge with the kids traveling down underground to find out that some creatures are the cause of Earthquacks, next is ""Home Sweet Homer"" where Scrooge and the boys are expected to meet Donald until they are whisked away to ancient greek times, ""Bermuda Triangle Tangle"" has Scrooge and the boys trying to find a lost peanut-butter supply ship in the legendary Bermuda Triangle to solve the mystery and finally ""Microducks from Space"" has tiny aliens that bring great gifts but accidently shrink Scrooge and the kids.

2396201,5,B000AXWGRC,"Honestly, I don't remember much about Disney's Ducktales. Other than the fact that it was a great show. That's why I'm glad I bought this volume of Disney's Ducktales cartoons. The show is about the adventures of Scrooge McDuck and his great-nephews. The nephews, who live with their Uncle Donald Duck, are left in Scrooge's care while Donald joins the Navy. A good bit of the episodes deal with others(like Magica & the Beagle Boys) trying to take Scrooge's money away from him while others still involve other storylines. I love the show because it's humorous and always teaches you something by episode's end, which is great for lil' kids to watch.

The show itself is based on Carl Barks' Uncle Scrooge comic book series. It premiered in 1987 and lasted until 1990(a total of 4 seasons).

What amazes me most about this show is the fact that it's Disney's first foray into a weekly animated series and they actually hit everything dead-on the first time through(which is highly unheard of in any cartoon series). Usually, it takes a season or two to get things going but they get everything just right.

Do I recommend Disney's Ducktales? You betcha' I do and then some. It's a milestone in animation and something that shouldn't be missed. Great job, Disney!",1281916800,,1263,4.784403669724771

Extras like behind the scenes or even old episode trailers would have been great!  But, I'll take what I can get, because as of right now, the last volume will not be released, so at least we have this much in case it stays that way.  I hope it does not stay that way.

I really want to see the last volume of this and other shows like it come to DVD.  To that end, I have a Facebook group up getting Disney fans together to get Disney to releases these un-released sets.  Join us if you are on Facebook.

The set, aside from that very irritating thing, is a great and a great addition for anyones Disney collection. Just remeber make sure your have the money to buy volume 1 and 2 at the same time the story loses it value if you don't.

2396206,5,B000AXWGRC,"I'm twenty one years old.  When I was a child I used to watch Ducktales every day after school.  There was something wonderful about Scrooge McDucks want to stay the richest duck in the world.  In one episode, when they give the history of Scrooge, they show how he made his wealth, through hard work, labor, and deal making.  It was an impressive and wonderful epiphany, at that moment, I knew I wanted to be rich.  I was six years old.  Ever since then I've been a buyer and seller of anything I could buy and sell, whether it be candy, notes, yu-gi-oh cards, baseball cards, and everything else, as a young man with little capital, and having to charge people upfront.  I'd buy game systems, play them for the summer, then sell them for fifty dollars devalued.  A lot of things about business I learned from Scrooge McDuck, as funny and weird as that may sound. But as a hcild, watching Ducktails was, to me, like attending the best educational program in the world.

It was fun, adventurous, I could watch the episodes over and over and over again, and never got tired of them.  This was one of the best cartoons I have ever seen.  I'm so glad that I thought about it again and saw it was available on DVD.  I was getting tired watching episodes on youtube.
This show made me want to be rich.  I am still going to college, I trade in stocks with a lot of success, I write books (some stories that have seen publication), and I'm working on a travel agency with some friends that will cater to people who are looking to take world adventures. It all started with Ducktales, all its adventures, treasure getting, business dealings, and money making.  The episode when the boys open a lemonade stand has never left me.  More information was given in that episode about how to run a business than any time I spent in a business class.",1250467200,2,1834,4.432835820895522

I was heartbroken when it was off the air. Correct me if I am wrong but the honor of replacing Voltron was Ducktales at 4pm channel 11. Not a bad sacrifice.

2396210,3,B000AXWGRC,"Duck Tales is for sure one of the most successfully long-running animated series, and for a good reason. It is undeniably a terrific show. The writing, the exciting stories, the characters, it's mostly spot-on. I wish I could say the same about this DVD, which commits the same crimes the Moomin cartoons originally saw upon DVD release - not ONE of the episodes here is in chronological order!

The first episode of this set, ""Send in the Clones"", didn't air until WAY after a host of other episodes. And the second, ""Sphinx for the Memories"", even aired a considerable time before that. And that's just the tip of the iceberg, sadly. The series opened with the five-episode special - from ""Don't give up the Ship"" to ""Too Much of a Gold Thing"".

A friend of mine got this set, and I told him in full honesty that I would have got it myself if Disney had bothered to actually keep the chronological order. We fans aren't stupid, we do notice these things! And it's especially bad because Duck Tales is one of those shows where later events are particularly influenced by past events - new characters introduced, new plot developments etcetera.

In conclusion, good show, bad DVD. Disney, you need to release your cartoons in chronological order, because it does matter to fans. 3 out of 5 - because the show, whatever the release's faults, deserves no less.",1232236800,4,1358,4.697478991596639
2396211,5,B000AXWGRC,"Sometimes childhood classics aren't as good when you watched them as an adult but Ducktalea should surpass your expectations. Not only is it as good as you remember it, you can now appreciate the creativity, humor and wholesome fun that cartoons use to have. They just don't make too many cartoons like this any more! Ductales provides: a cast of talented voice actors who have done voice acting for years (and aren't just movie actors that have asked to do cartoon voices). You get classic 80s inspired music (without robotic sounding lameness)...Ron Jones provides wonderful background music (no wonder he was chosen to do the background music for Family Guy). You get clean animation (for back in those days) and imaginative story telling. You also get humor that may be slightly cheesey at times but mostly its cleaver without being suggestive. How can you go wrong?
There are some things you see as a kid and see as an adult and realize that you probably didn't get all of those adult themes and that you really shouldn't have been watching that. This is not the case with Ducktales. You can rest assured that your children will be watching a show that they will love and that will be wholesome and not mind numbing. Watching this show reminds me of all the creativity I've lost since I've become an adult.
Bottom line: No, you will not find any extras in this set of DVDs. Instead you will find the episodes you remember watching as a kid and that I think is enough enjoyment.",1221955200,,1482,4.6603053435114505

The lack of bonus material such as commentaries or interviews even preproduction art they would have lost a second star but a rating of one star would be unfair, It is still an enjoyable set. If you are not a Die Hard who needs to have an entire series in their proper running order or want something family friendly then by all means pick this up but if you are a Die Hard you might want to hold off purchasing this.

2396223,5,B000AXWGRC,This volume brought back fond memories of cartoons that are written well enough that they don't require famous voices or crude plotlines.,1169078400,,137,5.2727272727272725
2396224,1,B000AXWGRC,"I love this show, I used to watch it and love it when I was young, which is why I was so excited to see it released on DVD. I got my copy popped it in, and soon I got very disappointed. The contents of this DVD have had DVNR done to them. For those of you who do not know what DVNR is, it stands for Digital Video Noise Reduction which is a form of restoration to get rid of dirt only unlike the restorations done for Disney platinum editions which is done frame by frame by people, DVNR is done by a computer. The result? Disappearing lines, blurring, characters become mushed. I mean just watch the episode earthquack and freeze frame the DVD when an earthquake appears, the whole screen just turns into a mass of colored blobs. Why Disney Why?",1167523200,17,746,4.223776223776224
2396225,4,B000AXWGRC,"I always loved this show as a kid, so I bought it for my niece. Since I have a good memory, I feel a little short changed though. I mean why isn't the original pilot movie not included ? I mean that's what made me a fan in the first place and what started it all. If you're a new viewer, you don't even get to see the real beginning of the series. It's good that the show is on dvd but come on why isn't all of it included here. It would also be nice to see the movie that was released in theatres also given a special edition release. Plus since the pilot isn't here they should release that on dvd too.",1165104000,,604,3.879032258064516
2396226,4,B000AXWGRC,I loved coming home from school and watching DuckTales when I was young.  It was funny and entertaining.  I wanted my children to have the experience too.  So we bought it.  My oldest loves it now too!  (My youngest is still too young to watch TV.)  She's having a ball with it.,1162771200,,278,4.25
2396227,4,B000AXWGRC,"This is one of the shows I watched when I was younger, its so good to be able to see them again, the bad thing is that it doesnt come with spanish audio.",1162598400,,153,3.6666666666666665
2396228,5,B000AXWGRC,it is my all times favorite...Thanks to disney they got it for me. It reminded me my childhood days.,1162512000,,100,4.315789473684211
2396229,5,B000AXWGRC,"I grew up watching Ducktales every afternoon.  My heart would race as that familiar theme song began and I would sing along.  When I popped in the first DVD of this wonderful collection, I was instantly transported back to my younger days.  It all came back to me.  All of the characters and plots.  I knew everyone by heart as a kid and I found myself reconnecting with them now.  The episodes still hold up.  I had a great time watching all of them.  Sure, it can be corny and cheesey at times, but that's why I loved it as a kid.  Ducktales does not take itself too seriously.  It is wonderful nostalgic fun.",1156204800,,611,4.280701754385965
2396230,5,B000AXWGRC,"There was a time when afternoon television programming was the highlight of the day for millions of young people across America. The reason for all this after-school joy: a very special programming block known simply as ""The Disney Afternoon."" Of course, the Disney Afternoon did not simply materialize out of thin-air. It was a gradual process to develop, and it was all started by a very special animated series called, ""DuckTales."" The syndicated, daily, half-hour adventure/mystery/comedy show blew fans away with animation and stories far superior to the programming that was standard afternoon cartoon TV fare at the time. Working with the classic comic book stories of Duck Family creator Carl Barks as a basis, Disney created a memorable and much-loved program that raised the bar for animated TV programming to a new high that later shows were frequently expected to reach.

Everyday, adapted comic book classics and completely original stories brought us into the world of Scrooge McDuck, the richest duck in the world and uncle to Donald Duck and his three nephews, Huey, Louie, and Dewey. From the city of Duckburg, we were taken on wild, treasure hunting adventures to far off places and strange lands, to meet wonderful new characters and even learn some stuff along the way without even knowing it! With friends Launchpad McQuack (Scrooge's crash-prone pilot, who was basically a replacement for Donald who was off seeing the world in the U.S. Navy), Mrs. Beakley the nanny, her granddaughter Webbigail, Duckworth the butler, and comic book favorite Gyro Gearloose the inventor, among others, Scrooge and his nephews had all manner of thrilling, Indiana Jones-esque exploits! In fact, the old Uncle Scrooge comic books that were the basis for DuckTales were also inspirations for the Indiana Jones films! Comic book fans delighted in DuckTales' rogues gallery as well! The list of baddies that tormented Scrooge and repeatedly went after his precious fortune included such classic Disney comic characters as Flintheart Glomgold, Magica de Spell, and a collection of Beagle Boys that were given distinct personalities, looks, and even a mother just for the TV series! The fantastic show even boasted occasional appearances by Donald's supernaturally lucky cousin, Gladstone Gander! Yes, the cast was fantastic for Disney fans new and old, but the amazing tales of daring do were the real heart of the wildly popular `80s television classic!

Now, ""DuckTales"" has finally and thankfully been released in its first DVD set. This three disc ""Volume One"" collection includes the first 27 episodes of the classic animated series from Walt Disney Television Animation Japan. The episodes are detailed below.

Disc 1:
Send In the Clones: Ever after Scrooge's Number One Dime, Magica de Spell breaks the Beagle Boys out of prison and sends them into Scrooge's mansion magically disguised as his nephews! It all creates a horrible headache for Uncle Scrooge as he tries to present his family in the best light possible to an interviewing reporter.
Sphinx for the Memories: On leave in Egypt, Donald gets mistaken for a returning god, and it's up to Scrooge and the boys to save him before a cult replaces his soul with that of the ""Garbled One."" This classic take on ""The Mummy"" is noteworthy as one of the few episodes featuring Donald Duck.
Where No Duck Has Gone Before: Scrooge takes over a TV studio when they can't pay back his loan, and it just happens to be the studio where ""Courage of the Cosmos"" is filmed! When the nephews and their friend, Doofus, show up to watch a taping of their favorite show, Gyro's improvements to the set cause the boys to be sent on a real space adventure with only Launchpad and Major Courage around to save them from the real aliens!
Armstrong: Gyro builds a robot that quickly becomes the apple of Scrooge's eye, but by the time the efficiency-obsessed machine reveals he is too smart for everyone's own good, it may be too late!
Robot Robbers: Flintheart Glomgold gets Gyro to build some giant robots for his construction company, but even without a brain, Gyro's robots prove to be nothing but trouble. That is, once Ma Beagle and her boys get ahold of `em! One of several episodes based directly on a Carl Barks comic book story!
Magica's Shadow War: Scrooge and Magica are forced to team-up when one of her evil plots goes awry. Her plan to use her own shadow to steal Ol' Number One backfires as the shadow develops a plot of its own!
Master of the Djinni: When Scrooge and Glomgold find and rub Aladdin's lost lamp at the same time, they must race home to the Duckburg Ice Cream Parlor in a contest for control over the wish-granting genie! But, while the genie is pampered and waited on at Scrooge's mansion, he decides to take matters into his own hands.
Hotel Strangeduck: Here's a fave episode (I love the spooky stuff)! Scrooge turns an old castle into an upscale hotel and employs his nephews, nanny, and butler within. But when the staff and guests begin having encounters with the ghost of Ludwig Von Strangeduck, the haunting mystery must be solved before Scrooge's hotel business goes belly-up!
Lost Crown of Genghis Khan: In another Carl Barks story adaptation, Scrooge competes with members of his explorer's club to find the lost crown of Genghis Khan. But who is more dangerous, Scrooge's fellow adventurers or the mysterious abominable snow-man rumored to live in the area!

Disc 2:
Duckman of Aquatraz: Framed for stealing a priceless painting from Glomgold's art gallery, Scrooge must survive in Aquatraz prison long enough for Huey, Louie, and Dewey to prove his innocence!
The Money Vanishes: The Beagle Boys bust out of prison and swipe Gyro's new furniture mover ray. Their plan is to use it to ""move"" Scrooge's three cubic acres of money!
Sir Gyro de Gearloose: Feeling unappreciated and taken advantage of as the local ""gadget man,"" Gyro decides to take a trip back to medieval times. Scrooge's nephews accidentally get taken along for the ride!
Dinosaur Ducks: When Launchpad discovers an island inhabited by dinosaurs, Scrooge insists he be taken there. Naturally, Huey, Louie, Dewey, and Webby stowaway for the trip!
Hero for Hire: Fired by Scrooge for crashing one plane too many, Launchpad is encouraged by Doofus to become a hero for hire. He soon finds himself playing a superhero in a big budget action film! What he doesn't know is that the Beagle Boys are running the show, and it's all just a trick to get Launchpad to rob banks for them!
Superdoo!: While on a Junior Woodchuck camping trip, Doofus can't seem to earn ANY merit badges of his own. But, when he finds a mysterious ""diamond donut,"" he suddenly has super powers and soon becomes the best at everything... except being a good sport. It's always a treat to see these Junior Woodchuck episodes, as that imaginary scouting organization was a staple of Huey, Dewey, and Louie comics.
Maid of Myth: When Mrs. Beakley is kidnapped during her opera debut by real Vikings, Scrooge McDuck and crew must follow them to Greenland to retrieve her. However, the only way they can do so is by Launchpad winning a chariot race against a seemingly unbeatable opponent. Great episode, and for those of us who love cute cartoon girls, there's an adorable female Viking duck in this one that Launchpad immediately falls for.
Down and Out In Duckburg: Scrooge learns a valuable lesson when the crafty fox Fritter O'Way claims legal rights to his entire fortune based upon an ancestral contract. Suddenly, the former richest duck in the world must seek help from those less fortunate folks he shunned before to get his fortune back.
Much Ado About Scrooge: In this particularly smart episode, Scrooge and the boys fail to resist the dreadfully persuasive salesman Fuller Brushbill, and one of Scrooge's purchases leads them to a mysterious land where William Drakespeare's famous plays seem to have come alive!

Disc 3:
Top Duck: Launchpad's family is in town to perform in a big air show, much to Launchpad's dismay. He is convinced that he is a constant disappointment to them, but the Beagle Boys just might give him the chance to prove himself. A notable episode for introducing Launchpad's entire family and for a great display of continuity by bringing back the playboy character of Benzino Gasolini, previously introduced as a guest in the ""Hotel Strangeduck"" episode.
Pearl of Wisdom: Scrooge goes up against an ocean smuggler known as Sharkey to be the one holding the magical ""Pearl of Wisdom"" when it casts its great power over its possessor. However, they first must get it back from Webby, who is using it as a ""great masher"" in a Duckburg marbles tournament. The character of Sharkey is notable for bearing a strong resemblance to Disney's classic villain, Pete. It's rather a shame that they didn't simply use Pete for this episode.
The Curse of Castle McDuck: Another classic Barks story redone, Scrooge takes his nephews to visit his ancestral home in Scotland only to find it haunted by a vicious glowing hound controlled by disgruntled druids.
Launchpad's Civil War: Launchpad is invited to perform in a Civil War reenactment portraying his great-great grandfather, Rhubarb McQuack. His pride is short-lived, however, when he discovers it's his role to be humiliated and defeated.
Sweet Duck of Youth: In another favorite episode, painfully reminded of his old age by a surprise birthday party, Scrooge goes on a quest to find Ponce de Loon's famous Fountain of Youth. But what is the true power of the magical water?
Earth Quack: In this Carl Barks classic, Scrooge and the boys head underground to find the source of earthquakes plaguing Duckburg and threatening Scrooge's precious money bin. What he discovers is a strange society of round-bodied creatures that roll around destructively for fun!
Home Sweet Homer: Taken back to the 11th Century B.C. by an evil spell, Scrooge and the boys must help Ulysses' nephew Homer reunite with his Queen Ariel and defeat the witch, Circe, who wants to transform them all into pigs! This is another favorite episode with all sorts of Grecian style monsters, and yes, Queen Ariel IS a cutie!
Bermuda Triangle Tangle: Scrooge and his nephews travel to the mysterious Bermuda Triangle to discover the cause of the famous disappearances of ships in the area. What they find is a community of survivors living on seaweed, in dread of a sea monster, and lead by the boisterous Captain Bounty.
Micro Ducks from Outer Space: Another of Carl Barks' classic Scrooge comics comes to life in this episode! When Scrooge has too much excess grain on his hands, Gyro comes up with a fascinating group of buyers! An extremely tiny race of aliens! Unfortunately, when they leave their molecular manipulator behind, Scrooge, Webby, and the nephews end up being shrunken themselves!

Featuring an unforgettable theme song, some of the best voice talent in the business, including Alan Young (Wilbur from Mr. Ed) returning as Scrooge McDuck (he originally played the character in the theatrical featurette, ""Mickey's Christmas Carol""), and spanning 100 episodes and a theatrical feature, ""DuckTales"" is high-quality Disney entertainment that can appeal to all ages, so long as the viewers are young at heart. Full of great memories for those of us who grew up with these fantastic programs from Disney's magical late `80s/early `90s Renaissance, this 3 disc set is a must own, even if it is not everything the hardcore fan has been longing for. The series is unrestored, and there is not an extra to be found (a crime in the case of a DVD boxed set). Of course, what concerns many of us the most is the lack of the five-part premiere, ""Treasure of the Golden Suns."" As with the ""Chip `N' Dale: Rescue Rangers"" Volume 1 DVD set, the 5-part premiere story is not included, which is most distressing, particularly since the 5-part premieres set up the entire series and are usually the best stories in the entire run. Happily, I have recently learned that ""DuckTales"" Volume 2 and ""Chip `N' Dale: Rescue Rangers"" Volume 2 will indeed both include these missing episodes! Both are scheduled to be released mid-November of this year along with ""Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears"" Volume 1! Hooray! Let's hope they don't skip over ""The Wuzzles,"" but with the coming releases of ""TaleSpin"" and ""Darkwing Duck"" this month, it's going to be quite a year for Disney Television Animation fans! But back to the point, this DVD set is fantastic if you are a fan of the show, even without any extras. A twenty-seven episode set for twenty-five bucks is a steal! I suggest you pick this one and ""Chip `N' Dale: Rescue Rangers"" Volume One up right away. I've been enjoying these shows enormously since I picked up the sets the day they came out! I only hope future Volumes do contain some extras and that Scrooge's other animated films get DVD releases too! ""DuckTales"" the movie has yet to be released to the general public, and still no sign of the wonderful animated short, ""Scrooge McDuck and Money!"" Plus, I seem to be the only one that remembers his teaming with Sport Goofy in ""Soccermania!""",1155340800,17,13156,4.915879442195232
2396231,5,B000AXWGRC,We have been waiting for this clever series to come out on DVD.  My young adult children watched it when they were kids and loved every episode. It still makes us laugh.  Thanks,1151884800,,177,4.333333333333333
2396232,5,B000AXWGRC,"This was one of my favorite 80's cartoons!  The cartoons now a days are just not NEAR as good!

WHY HAVEN'T THEY RELEASED THE SMURFS ON DVD YET?!!!  :-)",1151712000,4,152,4.172413793103448
2396233,3,B000AXWGRC,"I don't know if it was a local thing or what, but when we first got Ducktales they Aired Sir Gyro De Gearloose at night as a ""preview"", and never aired The Treasure of the Golden Suns as one long movie, instead it was aired AS the pilot in five episodes and kicked off the entire series. I still have a local newspaper clipping that tells about the show coming to our area, and the picture it shows is from The Treasure of the Golden Suns, showing Scrooge flipping the sun coin in the air. I don't know if this is how it worked for everyone elses area, but for some reason Gyro De Gearloose technically was the ""pilot"" as it was what was first aired.  As for Bonuses I had hoped and prayed that Disney would do commentary interviews with the Voice of Scrooge: Alan Young, and anyone else from the cast who hasn't already died. It would have been very nice to include the Disney channel spot about Carl Barks, the creator of Uncle Scrooge from when he won his Legacy award. I am sure one or two of the producers are probably alive too. I see absolutely no sense whatsoever in not including The treasure of the Golden Suns, it tells you about the characters, their motivations, who they are and why they are where they are. Without this five parter to explain things, newcomers to the series will be asking a lot of questions. I do hope once Treasure of the Golden Suns is released finally, that they are not the cut down crappy edited versions they used to show on Toon Disney. There were some somewhat risque background jokes (well for disney anyways) that were cut out; in wrongway to ronguay on the plane there is a ""cheescake"" 1940's style pin up calender of a sexy duck lady LOL. I have actually seen one cut version where they even cut the front of the la orange theater flyer out in ""Dont Give up the Ship"", heavens knows why, thus making a absolute mess of any sense of the plot. The five parter Treasure of the Golden Suns is far and away my favorite of the entire series, as it most closely feels like one of the actual Carl Barks comic stories, in fact I love it so much that back when cd burners were a rarity I had a buddy record the audio for all five parts for me so I could listen to it over and over LOL. I am not sure I will be buying this set, I think I will be better off burning my old videotapings to dvd, and buying bootlegs of the ones I don't have; mainly because I have seen the quality on these dvd's and honestly in some cases original tapes are better. Really disney put out a very dissappointing set here, any way you look at it. I suppose its nice to have part of the episodes out there again and available, but the heart of the entire series is missing without a word on why.",1150156800,12,2706,4.213872832369942
2396234,5,B000AXWGRC,How can you not like DUCKTALES.  This is the best show ever.  I used to watch it as a kid and now that im in college i can watch it all over again.  The best part is i can now share it with my children someday if they like that kind of thing.  Also the cartoons nowadays are not as good as they used to be so it will be good to show my kids what good cartoons really are.,1149552000,,371,3.6
2396235,5,B000AXWGRC,I loved watching this show as a kid and now that I'm in my 20's it's fun to watch it again.  I live abroad and it's great to have a piece of American culture to watch.  Great idea to put them on DVD.,1144886400,2,199,3.604651162790698
2396236,4,B000AXWGRC,"I'm really glad they finally released a volume set of ducktales, one of my favorite cartoon shows of all time.  I would have been much happier if they had included the first 5 episodes on this DVD set.  Does anybody know when the next volume sets are going to be released?  I am tired of waiting!",1143590400,3,296,4.25
2396237,5,B000AXWGRC,I love these older cartoons the kind you don't have to worry about your kids watching them back when it was fun to just make a good animated adventure,1142985600,,150,4.206896551724138
2396238,5,B000AXWGRC,"This is one of the greatest cartoons disney ever made. The video quality is a little uneven on this, but i suppose thats to be expected from source material thats at least 10 years old. The episodes are entertaining, fun and short. I'd highly recommend this for anyone who has kids. They don't make em like they used to, as the saying goes",1142467200,4,339,4.396825396825397
2396239,2,B000AXWGRC,"This release was disappointing - mainly because the episodes were not in order and the pilot was missing. Am I happy that they released them at all? Not really.

I'M 27 YEARS OLD AND I GOT DUCKTALES AND I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR SO LONG FOR SOMEONE TO COME OUT WITH ALL THE GREAT EPISODES IN A DVD OR EVEN IN V H S. NOW I FINALLY HAVE IT. HOPE YOU GUYS ARE WORKING ON VOL.2 CAUSE IT DOES'NT MATTER HOW OLD I GET . DUCKTALES RULES...

2396241,4,B000AXWGRC,"Disney finally released the cartoon show that started using the latest technology to make cartoons with cool animation.  I haven't seen Ducktales since the early 90's (I guess I missed the rerun on Disney and Toon Disney).  I swore someday I would own the entire series, and now I own episodes 6-33.  I give Ducktales 4 stars for these reasons:

1. Brings back memeories

2. Favorite show of all time

3. What's up with menu?  We need more!!

4. Not remastered, mastered from tapes in a television studio that was going to air them but didn't, so quality is close to VHS

5. Mono surround?  I know most shows around that time weren't stereo yet, but the movie Bambi is in surround sound!!!

6. Episodes 1-5 missing, why Disney?

Overall, my favorite show off all time, I have to give Disney some credit, but still, they have many issues!!",1142121600,,838,4.550335570469799

2396244,4,B000AXWGRC,I love the duck tales team. Very disapointing to see that the first few episodes are not on this volume 1 looks like they are starting after the initial pilot. Very disapointing. What's the good in collecting the series. I have still rated it high because they are great to watch and remember the old times sitting home on a saturday morning.,1140739200,,342,4.532258064516129
2396245,4,B000AXWGRC,"What's to say? Ducktales is one of the classics, and this DVD set has a lot of the great episodes you may have watched as a kid or want to show your kids today.",1140393600,2,160,3.735294117647059
2396246,5,B000AXWGRC,"I watched this show when I was a kid, and I have to say that now I'm an adult, it's even better. When I was young, I liked the show for the nephews, because they were cool. But now I watch the show for Scrooge, and I actually get some of the in-jokes intended for the adult mind ( Like the fact that the Beagle Boys and their mother are based off the real life criminals Ma Barker and her sons.) The problem with Disney is that they don't value their old work. Perhaps the release of this and Chip n Dale Rescue Rangers means they're getting the right idea though. I wish Disney would make cartoons like this again, but now all they're concerned with is making the graphics as flashy as possible. Trust me, measure up ""Chicken Little"" and ""Ducktales Treasure of the Lost Lamp"" and Ducktales will win EVERYTIME. Parents, do yourself a favor and pick up this DVD for their kids and let them watch a GOOD cartoon for a chance. Even if you don't watch cartoons anymore, if you're in your early 20's, you probably watched this as a kid, so pick it up, the nostalgia will hit you like a tsunami.",1139011200,,1089,4.265700483091788

Most of the Disney DVDs are half-price, too.",1138147200,,295,4.381818181818182

i just watched 2 episodes of this ducktales dvd and was quite intersting. not boring at all.

some people complained of the narnia preview at the beginning of the disc but it tells you you can skip it by pressing the Menu button.

my only gripe is not putting the golden suns movie at the beginning. thats why its 4 stars.",1138147200,,449,4.451219512195122

Let me say that Donald Duck appears in a handful of episodes, and when he is there its magic. However he is not the glue that holds these episodes together. It is the special Disney magic that makes this works.

This first DVD box set of 27 episodes is about five and a half weeks of the tales series as they ran on Network nightly strip (five days a week). I love them on DVD, and wish it was more. There some missing episodes like the pilot of the Tales show...however I figure those episodes will come soon. There are NO EXTRAS, but the set is fine without them.

The enjoyment of these episodes is because they never talked up or down to kids. The kids and the adults were on an even playing field when you watch these adventures.

I just hope powers that be at Disney will release Volume two soon. As well as full seasons of Live Action Zorro, Tailspin (Baloo the bear as a pilot), Kim Possible, The Proud Family and the Gummi Bears

This show was Disney at its prime. I don't think there is a soul on this Earth that disliked this cartoon. It had everything a television show needed with out the use of extremes. The characters were great, the stories were perfect and the theme song is unforgettable. This show is probably one of the greatest to emerge out of the `80's lasting into the early `90's. `Ducktales' led the pack of the Disney Afternoon block introducing a slew of new characters and even a feature full-length film. Heck!, this cartoon even generated a spin-off in Darkwing Duck!

I wouldn't be surprised of this DVD is on everyone's wish list. Now that the first 28 episodes have been put into this first DVD volume it is officially on everyone's must have list.

Oh a minor note for all of you complainging about the pilot...the pilot was split into 5 episodes and shown in one of the later seasons so don't worry it's coming.",1135728000,6,1286,4.706666666666667
2396251,2,B000AXWGRC,"There are several things about this DVD which i found to be very annoying. The biggest problem i had is that the DVD, being Volume one, does not contain the first five episodes of this classic Disney cartoon.  The first five episodes were a five-part miniseries called ""the Treasure of the Golden Suns"" that introduced many of the characters and lay the groundwork for the all of the followig episodess.  I was really dissapointed they were not included on the DVD.  You can check this out yourself.  Read the episode list on amazon.com, then compared it to how they actually aired ([...] So in reality this DVD has episodes 6-32, not 1-27 as advertised.

The other things that i was dissapointed about were the following:

1.  Disney placed trailers to its upcoming movies, like The Chronicles of Narnia

2. The sound quality was poor.  I don't think they even attempted to improve it for this DVD.  When you look on the box it plain says ""DOLBY DIGITAL MONO SOUND"".  I just expect more out of a DVD, even for cartoons that aired in 1987.

After everything i have said about the DVD release, ff you were a true fan of the show like i was, then this DVD is still probably worth buying just so that you can have your own copy of Ducktales.",1135728000,11,1238,4.477678571428571
2396252,3,B000AXWGRC,"I got this for Christmas, and was thrilled that DuckTales was being released on DVD. I eagerly opened up the package, looking forward to see how the nephews end up living with Uncle Scrooge. . . and found that the pilot was missing.

Wow, I kept checking the DVDs thinking that there was a mistake. Perhaps they didn't pack the correct discs?

Well, as others have mentioned, the lack of the pilot is VERY disappointing. I'm a huge DuckTales fan, but have even thought about returning it. I will keep it, because I love the show, but I hope the folks at Disney release the pilot episodes. It explains the premise of the entire series!

It's terrible judgement on their part to leave these episodes out of the first collection on DVD. Still, if you enjoy the show, you should still purchase the set. My only hope is that they release the pilot in the future. I might even wait to rewatch the episodes until that time. It is really annoying to watch them out of order.",1135641600,6,966,4.446327683615819
2396253,5,B000AXWGRC,"The DVD is great picture quality, and superb entertainment for the kids. The Video/DVD  quality is high grade. The stories are all formatted for Saturday morning style  Broadcast. Much of this  First  season I have not seen before, thanks to the Australian ""Mouseketeers"" show, or SATURDAY DISNEY, tendency to broadcast out of synch. However, since the DVD avoids commercials, and the inane inserts that the ""hosts"" made, I get to watch the shows whole. And forget about the comment that there are DVD  commercials you cannot get past; just select root menu, or title  menu, and you can select the show you want.
Stylistically, this material is Classic Carl Barks, and you can  see this in the Gladstone series comics ( either the ones  from 15 or more years ago, which were in themselves  reprints, or the higher quality ones out currently). I don't know why the stories were re-written in the manner that they were, but they seemed to follow a very patterned structure. And for some unknown reason, Donald is hardly  seen at all ... this affects the Adult viewers since Donald has been , at least historically, the most popular of the Ducks. I assume that a story ""model"" was created, where in some stories that had a mystical bent, SWEET DUCK OF YOUTH, the mysticism is taken out ( and the use of the Caverns is gone too).However MASTER OF THE DJINNI, PEARL OF WISDOM , and HOME SWEET HOMER, all have a specific ""Magic"" or ""Magical"" leaning. However, the majority of the stories that are true Bark's flights of fancy, are all closer to the Sci-Fi  Model of the short form story.

Anyways, this is an A-Grade Video watch ... if you cannot get a good video signal, then its time for a new TV or a New  DVD  player. The only thing that needs upgrading is the DVD's  audio. Its a pity that Disney clearly aimed this at the kids market, and have not bothered to edit the audio to 5.1 surround, which they clearly have the technology to do; Otherwise, Any fan of the one and ( unfortunately) only DUCKTALES, needs to buy this set. And, for the Adult fans, as well as the kids, look at the Gladstone reprints !!! Available now, from Amazon, they are VERY much worth the price.

2396254,3,B000AXWGRC,"First off, this DuckTales release is very good (aside from the omission of the five-part miniseries pilot). And secondly, Chris below needs to grow up. So what if some cartoons are edgier these days? Those aren't meant for reality-impaired people like Chris anyway. When I was a kid, I loved watching these kinds of Disney cartoons (anybody else remember Disney Afternoon?), but I must admit they are extremely formulaic. I happen to think The Boondocks is a hilarious and honest look at life through the eyes of a black kid who's too smart for his own good. How is an honest depiction of a black family and their off-kilter day-to-day surroundings offensive? Chris must be offended by the fact that the kids have a grandfather as the head of the household... and that they're all black... and that they're middle class. Not everything has a happy ending, but in DuckTales it did. People's tastes develop as they become an adult, but we still remember the things we held dear as kids. I always liked DuckTales and Talespin a lot back in the mid-late 80's, but the new cartoons on CN's Adult Swim are actually something I wouldn't be embarrassed to watch with my friends. They represent what we liked as kids (the cartoon aspect) with a collision of what we are as adults (the brash and unflinching nature of the characters and plots).",1135296000,4,1334,4.7296137339055795

My biggest complaint, and reason for giving it 3 stars, is that each disc makes you sit through 6 previews for old and upcoming Disney movie.  At my age I am not interested in Toy story, cinderella or any other Disney garbage.  I think that perhaps advertising the release of chip and dales rescue rangers would have been good.  Besides this complaint the DVD is pretty awesome.  It leaves out the first 2 hour episode that introduced us to the Ducktails gang, but I guess we can dish out the money later for that set when disney decides to put it out.

The movie, ""Treasure of the Golden Suns"" was originally aired in primetime and not as part of the afternoon series.  There were two more movies that were aired in primetime first.  The three movies were later edited and split into 5 episodes each for reruns.  These movies will probably be the last Ducktales cartoons released on DVD.

2396264,4,B000AXWGRC,"To paraphrase Ernest Hemingway's comment about Mark Twain's ""Huckleberry Finn"": All modern television animation stems from one source, Disney's ""DuckTales"".  It is quite simply the most uniformly enjoyable animated series ever created.  Proving that high quality and daily strip syndication were indeed compatible, it raised the bar for all subsequent daily-strip animated projects, ultimately leading to the creation of The Disney Afternoon, Warners TV Animation's numerous projects, and many other worthwhile efforts.  The ""quality TV-Toon boom"" that ""DuckTales"" detonated helped convince FOX to green-light ""The Simpsons"" in prime time, with all that that move implied for the future.  The series' popularity even convinced Disney to develop TV-themed attractions at its theme parks.  18 years after its debut, ""DuckTales""' impact can still be felt.  It was long overdue to appear in DVD form.

Unfortunately, Disney's treatment of the property in this release can charitably be described as uninspired.  The episodes are uncut and unaltered, apart from one or two tweaks (e.g. the voice-track volume in ""Top Duck,"" originally very hard for the viewer to hear, has been turned up, and a line in ""Sir Gyro de Gearloose"" that originally [and inadvertently] sounded very much like a cuss word has been redubbed).  There are no extras of any sort.  It is to weep, especially when this set is compared to previous releases of such series as ""The Simpsons"" and ""Batman: The Animated Series"", not to mention Disney TV's only previous DVD release, ""Gargoyles"".  It appears that Disney now regards ""DuckTales"" as just another ""old"" product to be vended in as generic a manner as possible.  A series that has had such a profound impact on the TV-cartoon industry deserved more respect than that.  The comparison with the ""Gargoyles"" release is particularly bothersome because Disney, in its decision to include extras with that particular set, may have been expressing its belief that ""DuckTales"", unlike ""Gargoyles"", was strictly ""kid stuff"" and never had any sort of an adult following.  How soon they forget: A healthy chunk of ""DuckTales""' regular viewers (not to mention many of its most fervent fans) were over 18 years of age.

Ultimately, if you buy this collection, it will be for the format alone.  For serious ""DuckTales"" fans, this will be sufficient reason for most to make the purchase, but it will be a source of consternation and disappointment for others.  I'd encourage all fans of the show to contact Disney DVD and request that extras and other materials be included in future volumes.

This is good clean family TV.",1131753600,,486,5.075
2396266,3,B000AXWGRC,"I was really looking forward to this and the Rescue Rangers box set, though the latter to a lesser degree.  I wasn't expecting anything in the way of special features, since these shows don't seem to have quite the vocal fanbase or involved creative teams that ""Gargoyles"" does.  But I really wasn't prepared for the discovery that the 5 part pilots had been omitted.  There's nothing on the box to let you know this; all it says is Episodes 1-27.  The episodes included can only be seen when you open it up and check the cases for the individual discs.  Disney's website is no help either; I couldn't even find a mention of the box sets on their DVD site, let alone a list of what's on them.

What I've been hearing as a possible reason for the pilots not being included is that they're going by episode airing order minus the movie showings of the pilots.  So in theory, the pilots could show up on some future box set covering the time that they aired as separate episodes.  This is kind of an off chance though.  Disney seems to be deciding whther to continue releasing a TV seris onto DVD based on the sales of the last DVD in the series released.  And since there seems to be little to no adertising for these sets, people may just not know that they're out.  Couple that with animation fans learning that the pilots, which often contained some of the best animation in the series, aren't included and deciding to skip the DVDs and you may well get low sales.  If Disney thinks they're too low, we may not even see more episodes, pilot or no.

The show is still good with some really quality episodes in there.  It probably would have recieved four or five stars were it not for the total lack of speical features and the missing pilot.  I really do hope we get to see more of the series make it to DVD, but I also hope Disney starts wising up and figuring out what they can do to give this show the respect it deserves.",1131753600,8,1926,4.325905292479109
2396267,4,B000AXWGRC,"While a lot has been made about Disney's history as a company, its animated features, and the controversial corporation we know today, there is little in the way of documents about their animated television series. However, on these cyber boards abroad the internet, a loyal, enthusiastic band of fans hold many of the Mouse House's TV animated shows close to their hearts--namely DUCKTALES.

Premiering on airwaves in 1987, DUCKTALES follows the adventures of Scrooge McDuck, a miserly multimillionaire with, to say the least, a heart of gold. He's accompanied by (who else?) Donald's mischevious nephews Hewy, Dewey, and Louie as well as Scrooge's niece, Webbigail Vanderquack (or Webby for short). Also along for the ride is Launchpad McQuack, a lunkish pilot with an unfortunate schtick for crashing airplanes. Each episode lands these mallards into all kinds of wild situations, including treasure hunts, magical mixups, and valuable lessons for young and old at heart.

What's fun about this show is that it doesn't just speak down to its juvenile audience, but provides imaginative excitement, action, mystery, and even a bit of charm to keep even grown-ups interested. Anime buffs might also want to take note that the artistic visuals were provided by Japan-based Tokyo Movie Shinsha. While the actual animation and backgrounds are nowhere near up to the level of Disney animated features (hey, this is a TV production, what did you expect?) the overall quality of the artwork is leaps and bounds above that which we tend to get with most Saturday Morning cartoon fare. Of course, it helps, too, that the cast of characters are a likeable, well-defined bunch of quackers (even the typical bad guys--ranging from the batty enchantress Magica DeSpell to the bumbling Beagle Boys to the nasty opposite of Scrooge McDuck, Flintheart Glomgold--have a bit of appeal to them, too!), and this is largely in part due to the top-notch voice work. Alan Young, in particular, simply IS Scrooge McDuck; his distinguishable Scottish accent and attitude really defines the character as a whole.

Fans have been clamoring for the release of this classic TV show on DVD for many years. Now, however, Disney has released a three-disc set of DUCKTALES--finally. Like most fans, I do have issues with this first volume--the lack of bonus features is disappointing, for one, and I find it baffling that Disney would neglect to include the four-part pilot episode which began the show on this edition. However, the mere fact that this show ever got released to DVD at all more than makes up for it. For a 1980's produced show, the visuals are surprisingly good and the sound, although mono, is adequately presented. Hopefully this release will prompt Disney to bring out more of its popular animated TV shows to the new digital medium.",1131667200,2,2822,5.077586206896552
2396268,5,B000AXWGRC,"Even at the age of almost 30, I still enjoy this series. The episodes are fun, unlike a lot of cartoons that you loved as a kid, but don't quite give you the same enjoyment as an adult.

Unfortunately, this isn't the optimal DVD set for fans. While it technically contains the entire first season (of seven), it is missing the 5-part pilot ""Treasure of the Golden Suns,"" which introduces us to the characters and show how Donald's nephews ended up with Scrooge. The first episode it does start with involves Magica De Spell trying to steal Scrooge's dime and jumps right into the show. It would have been nice to have those first five episodes to see who Scrooge is and how the nephews came to live with him.

This DVD set also lacks any bonus features, which isn't uncommon for older shows released on DVD, but would be nice. Picture quality is fairly dull, but isn't necessarily bad either. They just don't appear to have been enhanced at all for the DVD. Audio quality is the same way. The DVD set does include subtitles for the hearing impaired.

One of my main problems with the DVD set is the crummy box it came in. The set includes 3 DVDs, each in a cheap flimsy plastic DVD case, about half the thickness of a normal DVD case. These three cases are in a cheap cardboard box that doesn't look like it's meant to be saved. They could have easily put the three discs in one normal-sized DVD case with a flip holder on the inside, or at least put them in a decent box.

This series, and Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers, have been long overdue for release. The video quality might not be a+ but it's good enough! People complaining about the lack of the pilot shouldn't worry, because I'm fairly confident it will be on a later set, but likely in the multi-episode format and not as a full movie.

2396272,4,B000AXWGRC,"With the popularity of DVD season sets, it was inevitable that cartoons from the '80s (easily the most prolific decade for animation on the small screen) would get their due. However, the results have been pretty poor: incorrect footage for G.I. Joe and The Transformers, incomplete series releases (G.I. Joe, Jem, and The Inhumanoids), editing (My Little Pony), quadruple-dipping (Robotech), and time-compressed episodes (He-Man and Fat Albert). Despite these issues, the sets have sold like gangbusters and have given hope even to fans of the most obscure cartoons of the era.

Of the cartoons people would most like to see on DVD, the whopping majority were produced by Disney for their Disney Afternoon syndication package, or owned by the Mouse (namely, the Marvel Productions library). When Gargoyles finally saw its first season come to DVD last December, the hope was that the rest of Disney's excellent TV series would hit DVD as well. And now, at last, DuckTales (along with Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers) are here with a very basic 27 episode release, on 3 discs.

If you're expecting special features like those that Gargoyles received....think again. You're getting the episodes, and the episodes alone. The two-hour premiere movie (which was later broken up to air with the rest of the series on weekdays) is not here, presumably because Disney is thinking about putting that on a separate DVD (even though the premiere explains why Huey, Louie, and Dewey are shacked up with Uncle Scrooge as opposed to driving their Oscar-winning uncle completely insane). Unless you're familiar with the show, you're probably going to be lost, since there's no Donald at all. (And let's not get into the reasoning why Donald, a World War II veteran with the Army, would join the Navy, especially since he was obsessed with flying....)

These quibbles aside, you're getting 27 episodes of an excellent cartoon, unedited, at their proper speed, and in reasonably good (if unrestored) condition. Compared to how other great cartoons are being treated on DVD, this is a fine DVD set indeed.",1131408000,,2084,5.087719298245614
2396273,5,B000AXWGRC,"Disney knows that like me you'll rush out and by this 3 DVD set of Ducktales, and so have included a preview for the Disney/ Walden Media movie, The Chronicles of Narnia, opening Dec. 9, 2005. Why would you want to do that? Anyone who remembers the dismal state of weekday TV in 1987, also remembers how Disney saved it with Ducktales, Disney's first entry into afternoon cartoons, soon followed by Talespin and Chip and Dales' Rescue Rangers, each of which (re) introduced well-known Disney characters in new and imaginative roles.

Ducktales raised the bar for weekday animation so high with fluid, full animation, great character design, June Foray and other well-known voice actors, and thoughtful stories that didn't talk down to kids, that it's no overstatement to say they saved daytime cartoons, and set a standard that other studios would later strive to reach. Although Disney had made many great duck cartoons for theatrical release, this was the first series that took full advantage of Carl Barks' cast of characters and story telling prowess. The very first episode introduces Scrooge and his nephews, Webby and Mrs. Beakley, along with villains Magica de Spell and the Beagle Boys in a complex story about cloning and Scrooge's number one dime.

This volume one set includes the first 27 of Ducktales' 65 episode run (nine each on three DVDs). The three specials, ""Treasure of the Golden Suns,"" ""DuckTales: Time is Money,"" and ""Super DuckTales"" may show up in later sets, along with the feature length film, ""DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp."" For now, though, here's the 'toon that changed TV, back again for both adults and kids to enjoy. This set includes these episodes:

DVD one: (1) Send in the Clones, (2) Sphinx for the Memories, (3) Where No Duck Has Gone Before, (4) Armstrong, (5) Robot Robbers, (6) Magica's Shadow War, (7) Master of the Djinni, (8) Hotel Strangeduck, (9) The Lost Crown of Ghengis Kahn.

DVD two: (10) Duckman of Aquatraz, (11) The Money Vanishes, (12) Sir Gyro de Gearloose, (13) Dinosaur Ducks, (14) Hero for Hire, (15) Superdoo!, (16) Maid of the Myth, (17) Down and Out in Duckburg, (18) Much Ado About Scrooge.

DVD three: (19) Top Duck, (20) The Pearl of Wisdom, (21) The Curse of Castle McDuck, (22) Launchpad's Civil War, (23) Sweet Duck of Youth, (24) Earthquack, (25) Home Sweet Homer, (26) Bermuda Triangle Tangle, (27) Microducks From Outer Space.",1131408000,203,2418,4.916666666666667
2396274,3,B000AXWGRC,"First of all, the three-star rating does not apply to the quality of the program.  That would be a five, but because of the slapdash way this DVD has been produced, I had to lower the score.

""Duck Tales"" was a groundbreaking program.  Adapted from the great Carl Bark's masterful comic books, ""Duck Tales"" was Disney's first foray into the syndicated animation market, and it proved that the medium need not appeal to the lowest common denominator.  The stories were charming, exciting and funny, the characters were well-rounded and sincere, and the animation, while obviously not as luscious as Disney's big-screen offerings, was lively and colorful, miles ahead of the other TV cartoon fare at the time.

""Duck Tales"" became a huge hit, both critically and commercially, and aside from the other Disney series it inspired (""Rescue Rangers,"" ""Tale Spin,"" ""Darkwing Duck""), it caused every major animation studio to create better, more elaborate programs.  I think it's safe to say that without ""Duck Tales,"" Warner Bros. would not have launched such classic syndicated fare as ""Tiny Toon Adventures,"" ""Animaniacs"" and ""Batman: The Animated Series.""

And it's about time it arrived on DVD.  Unfortunately, what we get isn't really worthy of its name.  It seems this set was thrown together as cheaply and quickly as possible.  It's as if Disney, having run through their entire theatrical inventory, needed to make some fast cash for Christmas.  Everything in this set smacks of shortcuts, assembled by people who clearly do not care enough about the program nor understand its importance in the annals of TV animated history.  Five years ago, this wouldn't have mattered, but in the wake of such superb DVD sets as ""He-Man"" ""Batman: The Animated Series"" and ANY of WB's Hanna Barbera releases, one wonders why Disney dropped the ball on what has to be the crown jewel of their TV animated output.

I could go on and on about this set's shortcomings, but it essentially boils down to two things: 1) lack of bonus features and 2) poor presentation.  For the former, I can understand the difficulty in producing new bonus content for a nearly-20-year-old program, but there has to be SOMETHING in the Disney archives that could add value to this!  TV spots, deleted scenes, old interviews, EPKs, ANYTHING that puts the program in some sort of context!

As for presentation, there's NO excuse for the exclusion of the pilot episode.  First of all, it aired as a two-hour movie BEFORE the weekday broadcasts began, so if this set is indeed organized by airdate order, it should by all rights be first.  Also, narratively, it sets up the entire series.  It makes absolutely no sense to shuffle the five-part pilot episodes into a future release, well after the premise and characters have been established.

As for packaging and menus, they're fine.  Nothing fancy, although they've clearly recycled the back cover artwork from the late 1980s VHS packages.  But that's the least of my complaints.  And perhaps I've been too harsh.  It is a blast to revisit these episodes, and I suppose we should be thankful that we're getting to see them at all, since they've long since vanished from TV and cable.  But I'd rather have waited far longer and gotten something a little more substantial.  Perhaps, if enough people make their opinions known, Disney can put a little more effort into their future releases, not just of ""Duck Tales"" but of every other title in their rich history of television animation.",1131408000,9,3499,4.948630136986301
2396275,5,B000AXWGRC,"I have actually emailed the Disney company a couple times asking them to release what is perhaps my favorite disney cartoon ever on DVD. They of course, ignored me. But it's finally here! I loved Ducktales as a kid, grew up with it, and have been watching my old tapes with my younger sister (who is also a fan) ever since. I'm very happy to see Disney has finally wised up and decided to release these gems. I am disappointed to hear that they will not be including the episodes from the ""Golden Suns"" mini-series, as those are some of the best episodes from the series and really set up the plot. Hopefully they will include them in a later volume if not in this one. Funny, new leadership at Disney and suddenly they're acting sensibly for a change :)

I can't wait for November 8th! :)",1131062400,2,789,4.36734693877551

2396279,5,B000AXWGRC,"Of course Duck Tales is the best, but I have some info that probably should set everyone at ease about the mysterious ""pilot"" episodes being missing.  I have a framed cel in my collection from the episode ""Wrong Way to Ronguary"" and on it the cel says ""Show 25 Scene 310""- not show 2, or 3, etc.  By contrast I have an episode from the Castle McDuck episode from Season 1 and it does not have a show and scene listing at all.  In other words, the pilot was probably shot/made during season 2, although intended to be the pilot week (thus the Valley of the Golden Suns series should show up on Volume 2).

In Norway we did not have Disney Channel in the late 80s, but we could see Ducktales (same name in Norwegian) as well as Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers (Snipp & Snapp: Redningspatruljen) on VHS. I have loved this two series ever since I was a child, as I love almost everything else that is Disney. I hope that Disney/Buena Vista will release the Norwegian versions of these two shows here in Norway, but I am locking forward to see this two TV-series in English for the first time.

8080224,5,B000AXWGRC,"What can I say? I love Ducktales and all the original Disney Afternoon classic cartoons from the 90s. Although I am very thankful that Disney released these on Amazon, I do realize that if you want to purchase the entire Disney afternoon collection on Amazon, it is very expensive. But I did it anyways because these shows are incredibly difficult to find and I want to show my support for them so that hopefully Disney will release the rest of the missing Disney afternoon shows such as Darkwing Duck, Gummy Bears, Quack Pack, Bonkers, The Mighty Ducks, Alladdin and Marsupilami. Classic Disney cartoon in general are a hugely missed opportunity for Disney. Other 90s toons I would love to see released are Disney's Recess and the Wuzzles, The Little Mermaid, Timn and Pumba, Buzz Lightyear of Star Command, The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh etc In addition to all the Walt Disney Treasures films that were sold on DVD inside collector Tins. All of that should be available for streaming but it's so incredibly hard to find still. That's a ton of money that Disney could be making on streaming purchases. But this is at least a start. I really hope the fans speak with their wallets. Money talks! I love streaming Ducktales! So many happy memories of a good show from my childhood. Please bring the other toons back as well!!!",1525996800,,1331,4.716738197424893
