8042174,5,B0006PWM6E,"Shortly after its premiere in 1919, in New Jersey, this film was shown in Pennsylvania, where the State Board of Censors changed the title for screenings around that state to SEX CRUSHED TO EARTH, which is comprehensible for the time, but the work is after being a morality play, with the lead character, Adrienne Renault(Louise Glaum) realizing what the wages of her superficial existence are to be. Adrienne, star of the Frivolity Theatre in New York, enjoys stealing husbands with her major acquisition being Phillip Overman (William Conklin) whose wife she scorns when Mrs. Overman begs for his return; a chorine, Daisy (Peggy Pearce) is impressed by Adrienne's victorious self-absorption, and when the latter disposes of Overman in favor of a millionaire, Dick Wallace (Irving Cummings), the two performers find themselves in competition for him, which buckles the flooring of Adrienne's harsh philosophy. Although baldly a melodrama, SEX has many good moments and effective scenes, is well directed by Fred Niblo, and is a proper showcase for Glaum, who at the time of filming outdistances Theda Bara in the sweepstakes for America's favorite vamp; the titles offer witty art design, editing is smoothly done and Cummings, as a wealthy man about town, gives an outstanding, nuanced performance as the axle of the story.",1524787200,,1325,5.225352112676056
8042175,5,B0006PWM6E,Well what can I say I'm not sure which one this is because we purchased two of them but I can honestly say one of the best products all we have ever gotten between the different speeds which I believe there are 7 and the different pulses I think there are like 7 or 8 one of the best toys we have ever gotten kudos to the maker definitely would recommend and I'm actually looking at the other two Styles they have and am going to purchase those as well,1484092800,,452,4.033333333333333

8042178,1,B0006PWM6E,"I'm a silent movie fan.  I like to think, though, that I am fairly discriminating in what I add to my collection.  This one was a big mistake.  It is said that at the time Louise Glaum was replacing Theda Bara as top vamp.  I can appreciate Theda's crude but pioneering seductiveness even though little remains for us to see.  But this movie.  The story was shallow and ridiculous.  Even if it had been an interesting production, it could never have carried Louise.  In looks and behavior, she just isn't believable as a man seducer and stealer.  I am not so into movie history that I want to spend time and money on a bad product like this.",1297900800,3,641,4.364406779661017
8042179,5,B0006PWM6E,"There don't seem to be too many silent movies with vampy women in them, but ""Sex"" certainly fits the bill. Louise Glaum plays a headlining showgirl with a party-hearty lifestyle, and lots of wealthy men at her feet. Eventually she decides to settle down and marry one of them, and (surprise!) she even falls in love with him. You'd expect the story to end there, but actually it's just heating up. The vamp's young protege, back at the theater, now becomes a big star, and the little vixen sets her sights on that husband! I won't give away what happens next, but this movie was a lot of fun. You might start watching it just as a hoot, but before the end you'll be drawn in and sympathizing with the characters. I didn't expect this to be as strong a film as it is. The DVD has a little bonus section which is a slide show of scantily-dressed (and sometimes UNdressed) silent film stars, and this was a treat too. I have to admit I've watched it more than once already. Bottom line, this is a very enjoyable DVD, and I found the picture quality to be just great.",1152057600,20,1063,4.346733668341709

8042181,4,B0006PWM6E,"No doubt most of us will have certain expectations from a film entitled simply ""Sex"", and seeing the production date, 1920, might stretch our imagination even further.  The film's title caused quite a controversy back in 1920, but watching it by modern-day standards will make you wonder what all the fuss was about.  The worst you'll see are dancing girls in a club called 'The Frivolity' which attract wayward married men.  In fact, putting aside any expectations or images that the title might conjure up, ""Sex"" turns out to be a very good story with a morale and some points to ponder.  Its director, Fred Niblo, has some impressive credentials directing famous stars and films like Valentino in ""Blood and Sand"", Fairbanks in ""The Mark of Zorro"" and ""The Three Musketeers"", Greta Garbo in ""The Mysterious Lady"" and not in the least, ""Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ"".  I was pleased to find that ""Sex"" measures up to Niblo's standard - at least in 1920 before his more famous films - with a smooth, flowing style as the story unfolds and the plot takes a few turns.  Louise Glaum may have been cast in the vamp role in those years, but her part in ""Sex"" as the leading dancer and hostess of wild (by 1920 standards) all-night parties appears harmless to the modern-day viewer.  She and her girls think that flirting and having fun with married men is just a game, but after some time the tables are turned on her, and this makes ""Sex"" an interesting and satisfying story.  The picture quality could be a bit better, and another musical score other than the standard organ accompaniment would also enhance this film, but it's still quite acceptable as it is presented here by Unknown Video.  However, if you're after something sexy after all, the bonus feature on this DVD might hit the mark:  a slide show of several dozen surprising photos  of many famous silent screen stars like you've never seen them before!  Featured are Louise Brooks and Clara Bow, plus many others - also some men - in various stages of undress, but all of them are very tastefully done and suit the fashion of the time.  This fascinating slide show, together with a quality film with a good story makes this DVD worth a look - or two.",1112572800,14,2213,4.629156010230179
