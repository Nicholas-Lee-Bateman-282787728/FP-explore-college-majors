669308,1,6303454615,"Richard delivers yet another stank performance in this cheese-wad take off on a real premise.  Sincerely, this movie was a disappointment to car lovers everywhere - sure, there WERE cars in the movie...  it was dark and  the plot less than made up for their cameos.  Please reconsider buying this  stank-pot.  Thanks for your time!",949276800,3,331,4.927272727272728

I gave it a 5 star rating because even though its an older, or what is considered a ""B"" movie, it is awesome to ""REAL"" drag racing movie fans!!!!  Come on everyone, give me some support to make it happen!!!  This is the Fast and The Furious of the 1980's!!",1467936000,3,411,3.9634146341463414

7849307,5,6303454615,Richard Grieco does a good job in this older movie made around the street drag racing scene. I love the fact he drives one of the best muscle cars ever built. The 428 Cobra Jet Mustang,1355616000,5,184,4.138888888888889
7849308,5,6303454615,"If you're a race fan this is the movie to have.  Forget about those hi-strung imports, this one is All American muscle. I have watched it over and over, it never gets old. My blood pumps a little faster every time I see it.",1068508800,6,223,4.068181818181818
7849309,3,6303454615,"filled with cool racing scenes and Grieco's wanna be James Dean attitude. though I think Grieco ripped off Dean's red jacket. some scenes are lame as hell. the lead actress is hot(fogot her name) but she is hot hot hot. Born To Run is for the dragracing fans and fans of the cars and the ladies, yeah. fun for a while. the ending is good to.",1068422400,6,341,4.181818181818182
7849310,3,6303454615,This is a very polished high gloss movie with Richard Grieco as a racer kid. The storyline to me was quite boring. Maybe you like it more if you are into car racing. Grieco still has one of his better appearances in this one.,1050624000,6,225,4.136363636363637
