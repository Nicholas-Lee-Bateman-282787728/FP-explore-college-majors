8288034,4,B001CK7OLK,"Preface: What I write here is from my layman's perceptions.

The DVD has 2 parts: the first (about 25 minutes) features, on separate pianos, Solti and Perahia, and the 2 percussionists (Glennie and Corkhill playing 7 instruments) rehearsing, discussing and listening to playbacks. Actually, it is the immensely powerful and committed Solti who does nearly all the talking, and all the expostulation. Fortunately his intensity is leavened by occasional humor. Unfortunately I had trouble at times understanding his English.

 On Google I read of Solti's close connection with Bartok, which at least partly explains his intensity. -- Solti's friend Perahia, while participating in these scenes mostly silently, is fully there, committed, and certainly holds his own in the performance. Solti makes clear that the sonata is hard to get right. His concentration shows that. He impresses as a man of Authority, great talent and conviction.

The music: Repeated (attentive) listening of course helps a lot. And in this case, watching the performers, their interplay (and so the interplay of the instruments) is both entertaining and instructive. The pianos, potent as they are, share the spotlight with the other instruments. By the way, in this sonata the piano's percussive nature is very clear. Yet there is lyricism, especially in the lovely, quiet beginning of the 2nd movement.

Why not 5 stars? The DVD is under one hour; the 6 introductory segments and the performance are of roughly equal length. So there isn't much actual 'play'. I'd love to have another piece, say for piano alone. There is plenty to choose from, but maybe nothing was available for this DVD. - ALso,while I like replaying the sonata I don't want to replay the other parts. Consequently, for me, the DVD is about 27 minutes long.

However, for people who enjoy, or are curious about Bartok, especially his piano music, and for anyone curious about developments in ""modern music"", especially in the 1930's-'40's, the entire DVD may be quite rewarding. Also,  those who are drawn to percussion instruments might enjoy this DVD.

This is not BArtok the folk music aficionado but a composer focused on structure and development, on exploring new ways of melding powerful propulsive force with lyricism (where lyricism seems to be the lesser part). Maybe I say the obvious about the challenge of melding propulsion with lyricism. Beethoven did that and Brahms,.... and and and ...

 Bartok surely was greatly affected by Stravinsky. I wonder (as I am listening now to Brahms' first piano concerto), was Bartok influenced by Brahms?) But influences surely are multiple and often less than obvious. So much music - ""old"" and current - is always floating about. Bartok of course had keen ears. And what he produced reaches other keen ears, including jazz musicians', etc.etc. And now ours,if we tune in.",1353715200,4,2868,5.135193133047211
8288035,5,B001CK7OLK,"Great performance!  To see Sir Georg Solti lead this group to create wonderful music is worth having this dvd.  Murray Perahia and Sir Georg Solti perform this difficult piano music with great joy for the music.  Being a percussionist myself, I certainly enjoyed the performances of Evelyn Glennie and David Corkhill.  As a musician, one can certainly learn from watching the rehearsals how Sir Solti gets himself and the other musicians to work together to achieve a fantastic performance.  Recommended for anyone who enjoys great music.",1260835200,12,538,5.209302325581396
