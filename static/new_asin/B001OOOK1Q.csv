3731458,3,B001OOOK1Q,"After viewing more episodes, I have modified my review. The quality of the picture is fair to almost good for an older TV show, and the stories are worth the trip if you like old fashion good guys over bad guys TV series material. An episode called the deer hunters starts off with bad guys trapping a fawn in a snare trap, which the boy discovers, which should give you a clue to the types of shows. By the way, this is noted in the description as being in color but it is in actually B/W so be aware, if you dislike black and white features. At this low price, all things considered, it isn't a bad investment. I would have rated it higher if the picture quality was better.",1376956800,4,676,4.207692307692308
3731459,4,B001OOOK1Q,"This is another wonderful oldie.  The little boy is so cute and so grown up (as children were back then).  It is an innocent show about a boy and his animals that help him along in his adventures.  The uncle comes second and helps Sandy when he gets into trouble.  Like Sandy said in one episode...""You're always getting into some sort of trouble!""  I love the way things were back then - so innocent and carefree.  These episodes had some wonderful character actors, such as Lee Van Cleef and James Best.  What a wonderful Show!

On the quality of the DVDs, they were viewable but obviously not at the quality most professional DVDs are done, but I won't complain about that because i'm just glad we have these to watch.  I do hope Timeless Media will someday release the rest of these episodes on a DVD, or even better yet...that a complete episode DVD set will be done with remastered film...",1292544000,5,895,4.509316770186335
3731460,4,B001OOOK1Q,"The Adventures of Champion (1955)

Ricky North, an orphan living with his Uncle Sandy, had a knack for finding trouble and adventure in the desert Southwest of the 1880s.  His best friends were Blaze, his German Shepherd, and, of course, Champion, a stallion who leads a remuda of wild horses, but always responds to Ricky's whistle in time of need.  Ricky was the only human whom Champion would allow to ride him.  The 12-year-old Ricky was played by Barry Curtis, a talented child actor who had, undeservedly, relatively few credits.  Uncle Sandy was played by Jim Bannon, a handsome actor who earlier played Red Ryder in a series of B-westerns and looked every inch a lanky, broad-shouldered cowpoke who could lend a hand when Ricky and his preternaturally intelligent animal friends couldn't handle the bad guys by themselves.

Ten of the 26 episodes are included in this Timeless Media issuance.  Unlike most of Timeless' other DVDs for 1950s television series, the prints are somewhat battered, though certainly viewable.  As in other juvenile western programs created by Gene Autry's Flying A Productions, the episodes include plenty of hard-riding action with solid direction and good acting from both the principals and the  rogue's gallery of character actors that fill out the cast.  The episodes include in the set are:

1.01  The Saddle Tramp (co-starring Francis McDonald and Chris Alcaide)
1.02  Crossroad Trail (Stanley Andrews, Tom Irish and Lee Van Cleef)
1.03  Salted Ground (Hal K. Dawson and Tristram Coffin)
1.04  The Medicine Man Mystery (Myron Healey and Harry Harris Sr.)
1.10  Hangman's Noose (Hank Patterson and Frank Fenton)
1.13  The Stone Heart (James Best, Bill Henry and Barbara Bestar)
1.14  The Deer Hunters  (Leonard Penn, Howard Negley and Glenn Strange)
1.21  Andrew and the Deadly Double (Bill Henry, Don C. Harvey and Mary Jane Saunders)
1.22  Bad Men of the Valley (Morgan Jones, Sally Fraser and Ray Bennett)
1.24  Brand of the Lawless (Ann Doran, Walter Reed and Hank Patterson)",1248566400,24,2020,5.094512195121951

Violence was kept to a minimum with a lot of good values and lessons for the audience.  Even though there were 23 episodes of the 26 produced this is a good one to own.

8331008,4,B001OOOK1Q,"Amazon mix reviews for different versions of titles and even on different formats and its something they need to stop.
Previous releases of Champion have all been appalling . The UK set appears to have been filmed off a monitor as you can actually see the sides of the screen at times.
It would appear that Champion has not been preserved very well over the years . Every release including the new one has 3 episodes missing so maybe there are no surviving copies of these anywhere.
Quality wise this is the best so far although it still ranks as disappointing in comparison  with better known shows of the same era. Champion was shot on 16mm so that's a minus point and dvd doesn't handle grain very well and whoever authored these discs didn't seem to do much to improve these shortcomings so there are many imperfections . However the Film Chest Version is better than all the others and its definitely worth a purchase but don't let the "" restored in HD"" byline get you too excited . The state of many of these prints are rough to say the least. Mine came from Amazon Canada and Disc 1 showed the layer separation issues suffered by early dvd releases of The Terminator and other titles . My other 2 discs were fine but I do wonder if long term these discs may fail to play",1392249600,5,1277,4.411016949152542
