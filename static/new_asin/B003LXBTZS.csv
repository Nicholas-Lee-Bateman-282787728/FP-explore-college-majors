8399890,3,B003LXBTZS,"TNA went through a number of changes in the first half of 2010 when the company brought in Hulk Hogan and Eric Bischoff to, supposedly, take the company to the next level and compete with the WWE. Four years later and we've seen how THAT turned out! Anyway, Sacrifice was the company's fifth event after the change and is actually pretty decent.

Not Worth Watching: Abyss and Desmond Wolfe clashed in a disappointing match while the Global Championship and Tag Team Championship were lethargic, nearly unwatchable encounters. Jeff Jarrett and Sting had a match that was really a segment that didn't seem to accomplish anything.

Worth Watching: Madison Rayne and Tara had a solid match for the Knockouts Title, the triple threat tag team opener was a fast-paced encounter that got the crowd going, and Mr. Anderson and Jeff Hardy had a match worthy of their series in WWE years earlier, though they would top themselves in 2011 while feuding over the TNA Championship.

Match of the Night: AJ Styles and Rob Van Adam capped off the night with a strong match for the title. Ric Flair and Jay Lethal provided some entertaining distraction in the middle of the bout that didn't feel overdone and there was a feeling of ""can you top this"" Between two great, athletic performers. Not a five star encounter, but it was worth the price of admission.

Sacrifice was just another PPV on the calendar when it started in 2005, and the 2010 event doesn't break the mold. Still, there's a couple worthwhile matches booking the show, so it's worth a look.",1405641600,,1542,4.764044943820225
8399891,4,B003LXBTZS,pretty good movie with lots of big stars and great matches. if you like tna you will love this.,1405382400,,95,4.052631578947368
8399892,4,B003LXBTZS,"I saw commercials for this particular dvd on every since TNA 2010 dvd, saw commercials for this more than any other dvd so I thought I'd check it out. While I don't think it was worth THAT much promotion it's certainly not a bad show. It's more of a typical but good TNA ppv. I have to praise the 3-way tag team match, the X-Division title match, and Hardy/Anderson (not to mention a hilarious interview with Anderson & Christy). The World title main event isn't bad but I have to say Flair's commentary does kind of drag it down a bit.

I have to give kudos to the Sting/Jarrett ""match"" if you can call it that. I'm doing this review in 2014 and have seen the immortal storyline from conception to completion and I didn't understand why Sting maliciously attacked Jarrett. But now the storyline has come and I go back to these pre-Immortal shows and realize TNA actually really did a good effort in making a good slow-built storyline, which isn't normally seen in TNA.",1404432000,,969,4.505681818181818
8399893,4,B003LXBTZS,"Pretty good show from TNA, In my opinion at least. I wasn't found of Wolfe getting buried by the Hogan version of Abyss, but oh well, can't like everything I guess. RVD vs AJ was always a dream match for me, so it was fun to see that.",1363564800,,234,3.8958333333333335
8399894,4,B003LXBTZS,"The 3 way tag bout(Team 3-D vs. Beer Money Inc. vs the Motor City Machine Guns) was a pretty good/solid 3 way. The TNA Global title match between Rob Terry & Olando Jordan was a dull & dry match. The X-Divsion title match between Kazarian & Doug Willams was a high-flying,hard-hitting showstealer. The TNA Women's title match between Madison Rayne & Tara was a solid/back-and-forth bout and the same goes for the Jeff Hardy-Mr. Anderson match. The TNA World tag team title match between Ink Inc(Jesse Neal & Shannon Moore) & The Band(Kevin Nash & Scott Hall) while having some flaws,it was still a good match. The Aybss-Desmond Wolfe match while goofy at some points,it was still a solid bout. The Jeff Jarrett-Sting match was a 14 second stink-fest. The TNA World title match between RVD & AJ Styles was a heart-stopping,nail biting,high-flying match of the year candidate. I give this PPV a 8 out of 10.",1279584000,,905,4.770700636942675
8399895,3,B003LXBTZS,"Team 3D vs. Motor City Machine Guns vs. Beer Money - This was a triple threat match to determine the #1 contendors to the Tag Team Titles.  The Guns controlled the match early against Beer Money which got the crowd heavily behind them.  For a while, Beer Money was purposely kept out of the match by both 3D & the Gunz which resulted in them having to resort to a blind tag to get back in.  If your a big Guns fan then you'll love this match as it was the strongest showcasing they've had in a while as they were wrestling for a majority of the match.

TNA Global Champion Rob Terry vs. Orlando Jordan - Rob Terry dominated early with his strength as Jordan wasn't able to get one move in until he missed with a kick resulting in Jordan taking advantage & heavily worked over his knee for most of the match before getting caught in a sudden chokeslam to retain.  I'll give credit here in that Orlando Jordan did have good storytelling by working over Terry's knee & carrying this match but the match itself was just too dull & dry to the point where it was just boring & the crowd chanted to ""END THIS MATCH!""

X Divsion Champion Kazarian vs. Douglas Williams - Back at LockDown, Kazarian won the X Division title after Williams was stripped of it because he was unable to make the event...however Williams still had the physical belt & refused to hand it back since he was never beaten for it.  For months, Williams blasted the X Division & it's wrestlers for heavily depending on ""highspots"" more than technical wrestling so Kazarian took a different approach than the others and tried to beat Williams at his own game with technical wrestling.  Kaz was able to pull off some impressive moves such as an attempted headsissors into an inside cradle along with a slingshot DDT while Williams at one point delievered a powerbomb into the corner with Kaz landing short on the fall.  This was a real good wrestling match.

TNA Knockouts Champion Madison Rayne vs. Tara - Tara put her career on the line in this match while Madison Rayne sent the rest of The Beautiful People backstage so it would be a one on one match.  In recent weeks, Tara did a heel turn by attacking the other babyface knockouts which led to the crowd being split between which two.  This was actually a better match than I expected as it went back & forth resulting in a good match between both girls.  Unfortunally Tara was defeated & got a standing ovation as she left the ring while Rayne had the best showing I've seen her from her while also picking up her first ever singles win in TNA.

TNA Tag Team Champions The Band vs. Ink Inc. - Just a couple of notes here in that the new team of Ink Inc. consist of Shannon Moore & Team 3D's protoge Jesse Neal, Eric Young recently replaced Sean Waltman as the third member of The Band, and Ink Inc. had a conversation with Team 3D earlier in the night with Team 3D warning them that The Band would take out their issues with 3D on Jesse with Neal having a responce that Brother Ray took personal.  The match had a few early botches between Shannon Moore & Scott Hall before Neal came into the ring with The Band targeting & working over ""the rookie"" of the team before Ink Inc. was able to make a comeback.  Eric Young appeared before Brother Ray came out & had a reaction to what he thought was a personal insult.  This was an average tag team match but I'll give credit here in that Hall & Nash helped give Ink Inc. a real good showing as they came off like they would have won the tag team titles if the match would have stayed between those four men.

Abyss vs. Desmond Wolfe - The winner of this match would win posession of Hulk Hogan's Hall Of Fame ring & Desmond Wolfe's valet, Chelsea.  Abyss attacked Wolfe on the way to the ring out of anger due to him being arrested on charges of assault on Chelsea on Impact...which were revealed as false.  Abyss did his usual power offense while Wolfe attempted to work over Abyss' arm before Abyss ""hulked up"" to gain his revenge & Chelsea for the next month.  This was a watchable match.

Jeff Hardy vs. Mr. Anderson - Before I get started, anyone who's a fan of Mr. Anderson's promos will laugh their ass off at his prematch promo & the new name given to his fanbase.  Anderson came to the ring with his ribs taped from Jeff Hardy's swanton bomb through a table on the previous Impact & controlled the match in the early moments.  Hardy recovered and connected with a sweet looking jumping leg lariat off a chair on the ramp into the ring that knocked Anderson back.  It got real competitive between the two men resulting in a real good match but it was the actions of both Anderson & Hardy after the match that left an impression.

Jeff Jarrett vs. Sting - This was one of those ""put a storyline over"" segments more than an actual match as Sting just beat down & bloodied Jeff Jarrett from the backstage area all the way down to the ring to the point where he left a big spot of Jarrett's blood on Mike Tenay's format sheet at the broadcast booth.  Sting used his bat & the ringside steps to injure Jeff's shoulder before eventually getting the win & warning Jarrett about playing the ""deception game"" with the rest of ""them.""

TNA Champion Rob Van Dam vs. A.J. Styles - The night after Lockdown, RVD won the TNA Championship from Styles so this was their rematch and Flair was ejected from ringside in the opening moments leaving Flair to join Tenay & Taz on commentary for the match.  Both men had very similar styles with their dives & flips & overall arial offense against each other which resulted in A.J. going for a more grounded attack using some of the tactics Flair has been known for throughout his career along with other moves such as Lex Luger's ""Human Torture Rack"" backbreaker.  Flair did eventually try to get involved leading to the appearence of Jay Lethal who once again gave Flair a taste of his own medicine before RVD retained his championship in a great main event.

Overall this was a solid PPV as there was only one bad match (Terry/Jordan) & one that was below average (Abyss/Wolfe) while the others had good performances from those involved.  This was a good ""B show"" from TNA so if you have a couple of spare bucks, go ahead & check this out.",1276128000,5,6242,4.400869565217391
