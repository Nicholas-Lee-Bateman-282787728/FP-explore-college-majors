3474624,5,B001AYWY5O,"Like all her other workouts, this is the best.  I just love Leslie Sansome and have recommended her to all my friends.  In fact, one recently lost 45 lbs. on Weight Watchers and credits it to WW and Leslie Sansome workouts!",1224547200,13,223,4.414634146341464
3474625,5,B001AYWY5O,"This is a great work out dvd.  It is so easy anyone can do it yet you are really working out hard.

I love this dvd",1224460800,3,115,3.3846153846153846
3474626,5,B001AYWY5O,"Leslie is so good.  I, like most exercisers, like to go for regular outdoor walks, but when the weather is bad or too hot, then this is the next best thing and I truly believe that you can burn as many calories as outdoor walking if you give this your all.
The workout is made up of five walking cycles all of which are around 30 minutes each (or just a little under).  The first workout is the easiest; it's the basic march, kick, step touch and knee lift routine that you may have come to be familiar with already.  The next three, incorporate body toning (arms, abs and lower body) which make it a little more challenging and then finally comes the hardest of them which is the speed walking routine and it honestly is intense and more challenging than you'd think.  You can feel the burn in most of the routines, but this is the toughest and you'll feel it for a day or two later.  I certainly sweat up a storm in this last segment.
For me, I feel that I work harder doing this dvd workout than when I go walking outdoors on my own because she is using motivating music that has fast beats that keep your feet moving fast.  I really love doing this and highly, highly recommend it.",1223596800,24,1185,4.2444444444444445
3474627,4,B001AYWY5O,I have several of Leslie Sansone's videos.  All are similar and each one gives you a good workout.  I like that each mile in this DVD targets a different part of your body. This DVD is unusual in that Leslie is alone in the workout studio.  I like seeing other folks (especially those who are older and still getting into good shape) working out with her.,1223251200,9,355,4.348484848484849
3474628,5,B001AYWY5O,"Wasn't sure if I'd like Leslie in a solo workout, but this just might be my favorite.  The music, for the most part, is new.  Leslie is a ""subdued"" version of herself, which is nice for days when you might not be up for a lot of ""chatting"".",1223078400,15,240,3.9791666666666665
3474629,5,B001AYWY5O,I just wanted to say how much I appreciate the new 5 Day Slim Down DVD!  Leslie does moves I haven't seen her do in any of her other videos - I love it!  Each mile provides an excellent workout!  I also like that she does the workout alone.  I hope Leslie makes more DVDs like this one.  I also think it's great that I can customize my workout!,1222905600,20,344,3.927536231884058
3474630,5,B001AYWY5O,This is my favorite video by Leslie Sansone. I love the way the miles are divided up so that you can put together your own custom workout. I would definitely recommend this video to everyone.,1222732800,14,191,4.485714285714286
3474631,5,B001AYWY5O,"This is the first Leslie Sansone DVD that I've tried, and I love it.  Each mile is slightly different, targeting different muscle groups.  The first 4 are 14-minute miles and the fifth is a 12-minute mile.
Like other posters have said, this one features Leslie alone.
Since getting this one I'm hooked and I've borrowed several of her other DVDs to try.  I like some of the ones with friends, but over the long- haul, could see how they'd get on my nerves more.
I like the pace of this one - not too slow but not too fast for a beginner.
Also, I like the setting for this DVD better than most.  Several of her DVDs are against a black curtain and they feel too dark.  This one has a great open studio with windows and the outdoors in the background.
The moves are easy to follow, the music is great, the studio is really cheerful and the cueing is excellent - easy to follow.",1221955200,171,875,4.246987951807229
3474632,5,B001AYWY5O,"I've lost 36 pounds with Leslie's dvds and jump at the chance to try anything new that she does.  I did all 5 miles of this workout and was very impressed!  When done all together, it's her most challenging and versatile workout yet.  The first mile is a classic walk; the second focuses on arms; the third, legs, with squats and lunges along with the walking; the fourth, abs, with lots of standing ab work; and the last, a speed walking mile.  There is a warm up and a cool down with a nice amount of stretching at the end.  There are some new variations to the basic walking steps in this dvd that keep it fresh and fun, and the music is also updated.  It's a great dvd for beginners who can do a mile at a time, or for Leslie veterans who can do the entire dvd for a challenge.",1221868800,177,781,4.105263157894737
3474633,5,B001AYWY5O,"This is one of Leslie's most basic and versatile workouts yet. For those accustomed to Leslie's DVDs, you should know that this one features Leslie solo in every segment. I rather like seeing Linda and JoAnn and Carol in the other workouts, but Leslie's jokes and chatter really grow old when you've done the same workout umpteen times. This workout is straightforward. Leslie talks all the way through, giving her usual good cues, but there are no jokes and little to no giggling. A welcome relief if you plan to do it often.

Unlike the earlier 5-mile workout, there are no walking aids such as hand weights or stretchy band. The first mile is Leslie's basic walking steps. The second mile focuses on the upper body and arms. The third mile focuses on legs (with some squats). The fourth mile focuses on the abs and waistline. And the fifth mile is a ""fast mile"" but with only one brief section of ""boosted walking,"" which is optional.

This is also versatile enough both for beginners and advanced walkers and for short or long workouts. Like Leslie's earlier 5-mile workout, each individual mile can be done separately, or they can be done in combinations of 2, 3, 4, or 5 miles. And unlike the earlier 5-mile workout, this one has separate warm up and cool down segments. If you do 1 mile a day (each one is 12-14 minutes) plus the 5-minute warm up and 9-minute cool down and stretch segment, you have 5 different workouts of less than 30 minutes each, one for each day of the week. If you do the warm up, all 5 miles, and the cool down, it takes an hour and 22 minutes.

I usually prefer to walk outside than to walk in front of the TV, but when I'm pressed for time (as is usual during the work week) or the weather's bad, there's just no better or faster low-impact workout than Leslie Sansone's. Fortunately, I have a fairly large library of her workouts, which provides variety. I've been doing them 3-4 times per week for several years now.

This is a very welcome addition to my workout library. It would also be a good place to start if you've never tried one of Leslie's workouts before.",1221264000,569,2101,4.492146596858639
3474655,5,B001AYWY5O,This is a really great DVD. You can do one mile a day with different emphasis or you can combine. Separate warm up and cool down segments help you customize the workout you want for that day and you can always make them as hard or as easy as you want. I really like all the videos that are just Leslie by herself.,1476662400,,313,3.984126984126984
3474656,5,B001AYWY5O,"Best exercise video I have ever bought.  Simple, too the point and you can add hand weights to increase the cardio.  Leslie has many versions of this, and I have several of her versions.  This is the one I keep going back to and I have bought several of this specific version to give as gifts.  If you are only going to have one exercise video-this is the one.  I have at least 20 videos and this is my all time favorite.  It is easy to stick to and easy to follow.",1476144000,,465,4.0
3474657,5,B001AYWY5O,"Nice addition to my Leslie 5 miler collection. It's just her without a class, but she managed to keep it interesting and threw in some good variety.",1472688000,,148,4.518518518518518

3474665,5,B001AYWY5O,Love Leslie Sansone,1459555200,,19,5.666666666666667
3474666,5,B001AYWY5O,"I have three Leslie Sansone Walk at Home videos, but this one is my favorite because it includes miles that target arms, legs and the abdomen. Plus, she is solo, so there's no irritating chit-chat and giggling The pace is not as fast as some of her other videos, though. In fact, the first mile, the ""Classic Walk"" is almost a warm-up. (I'd prefer it if she added another speed walk.) However, I add 2 lb. hand weights to the second mile ""Sculpt Your Arms"" for a more intense workout. I especially like the lunges and squats in the third mile, ""Slim Your Legs."" (I pause the video and do a third set of each.) Mile 4, ""Trim Your Tummy"" is a decent waistline workout and mile 5 is a ""Speed Walk."" There's also a cool down walk and stretch and a special feature about breakfasts. I like this video much more than her ""5-Mile Walk"" which includes miles using hand weights, the walk belt and a firming band--but doesn't have a mile that focuses on the lower body.",1459468800,2,959,4.363128491620111
3474667,5,B001AYWY5O,"Love it! Very doable, an exercise DVD my husband will do with me!",1457740800,,65,4.076923076923077
3474668,4,B001AYWY5O,"Like many others I also have many of Leslie's walking tapes.  I especially like the one-to-one tapes that she has since she is more informative in why and how the exercises are important.  The giggling and chat does get old fast when you are using the tapes regularly.  This particular tape is good because you can work/enhanse different areas on different days.  for example: I generally use weights (2 lb) for the mile with the arms.  And ankle weights on the mile with the legs.  Overall, this is one of my favorite of all my Leslie tapes.",1457568000,,542,4.536082474226804
3474669,5,B001AYWY5O,"So easy, so much fun to do.  You can walk anytime of the day or night.  You control what you want to do.  And once you get into the habit, you look forward to the next day.",1455667200,,172,3.5945945945945947
3474670,5,B001AYWY5O,I purchased this dvd and was amazed at the great workout I could get from just walking! Even though each workout is only 12-15 minutes you can definitly get a good burn going! On days when I have time I move my coffe table and do the full dvd! Love Leslie's easy to follow moves! I love this dvd!,1454025600,,296,4.033898305084746
3474671,5,B001AYWY5O,I do these exercises every other day. Some days I walk a mile other days I might do two miles and when I'm feeling extra energized I do the entire video. I never get tired of this video because each mile you walk targets different muscle groups. One of my favorite walking videos.,1451865600,,280,4.30188679245283
3474672,5,B001AYWY5O,"Haven't opened this yet, but ordered it to replace the same DVD that had started to skip/stall.  I have 5 or so Leslie videos, and I particularly love this one.  The only thing I wish it did differently is to be able to set up a workout program by choosing any number of the workouts in any order with warm ups and cool downs.  You have to play the whole thing straight through or go back to the main menu after each thing you choose to do. Still love it though.",1450310400,,462,4.054945054945055

3474687,5,B001AYWY5O,"introduced to leslie's walk at home program about 2-3 weeks ago, it has been a perfect low impact exercising program for me who is mostly at home.. finally i can do a workout that i can actually follow steps to and keep up with, there are no over complicated moves to make me feel uncordinated or any that make fall behind..most important, my knees do not start hurting after only five minutes like my upright bike and elliptical were doing, so i actually now look forward to exercising everyday knee pain free! i started with the walk at home quick & easy part one on youtube, next day did it and part 2 and got this dvd on third day and am now up to being able to do the warm up, day 1 classic walk, day 4 trim your tummy, day 5 speed walk and the cool down, all in a row in one day..that is pretty good considering i rarely exercised!
highly recommend this dvd, i chose it over others because of a review i read but, mostly because i wanted kinda like a one on one experience for now, it is just leslie in this dvd so there are no distraction from others exercising with her like in other dvds..eventually i will try those too but, for starting out, i think this one is best.. the breakfasts making part was even interesting to watch too.

also got the walk away the pounds dvd, have not used it yet but, its a one on one dvd too and you use light hand weights with that one so probably a good choice to get that one to use after using this one..",1444867200,2,1449,4.120141342756184

3474689,5,B001AYWY5O,"I chose this one because of other reviewers' comments that Leslie featured by herself was a great way to feel like you have a personal trainer. And I agree. It's fun and not annoying when you've basically got it memorized. I can customize from 1 to 5 miles, based on my time and energy level and get a little work on arms, legs or abs.",1442620800,,335,4.1692307692307695

Leslie has designed a program consisting of five 15-minute segments. You can do as many as you like each day. Leslie is like my personal trainer - just the two of us working out in the privacy of my own home. I still enjoy the workouts and feel that I get good results, so I ordered The Big Burn - 2 Miiles of intervals. Adding intervals to the walk routines is good, but I do not enjoy the workout. Leslie added other walkers, which I find distracting. She talks to them and I no longer feel that she is my personal trainer.

It has a classic walk, then each section after has a section to tone arms, legs and waistline.  For years people have implied that her walks are not  anything special, but I totally disagree. It keeps a person in great shape, and helps aide in weight loss. I also like the fact that she is alone on this tape, as the ones with her friends can get redundant at times, and a bit annoying unless you put your DVD on mute.

It is also a bonus that these workout sessions put no stress on your body, yet enable one to lose weight and get physically fit.

3474732,4,B001AYWY5O,"I love Leslie Sansone walking workouts. This one is a little different though as you have to go to the main menu for warmup, then again for the walk, then again for the cool down walk. It would be good if you did all 5 mile workouts, but it is a little inconvenient for just a one-mile workout. Think I will go back to a different DVD that has it all in one session.",1416960000,,366,3.9594594594594597
3474733,5,B001AYWY5O,"I have a few Leslie Sansone DVD's and I like that I know what I'm getting.  I added this one to my collection along with another one by Jessica Smith.  I really enjoy this DVD.  It has 5 different work outs that target different areas, most running about 15 minutes, along with a warm up and cool down of about 5 minutes each.  It is low impact, which is important to me, yet challenges me.  I like the variety and usually combine two different routines along with a warm up or cool down.  Leslie is alone on this DVD and it is a nice change from the other ones I have.",1412035200,2,569,4.081081081081081

3474736,5,B001AYWY5O,"This is my ""go to"" video when I work out.  You can do one mile, up to 5 which work on different body parts.  The warm-up is excellent!  I use it even when I warm up for other workouts.  It has a good cool down also.  The arm part takes a little too long in my opinion, but overall a great video.  There are no other people to distract from Leslie, which is nice.  It is not too difficult to do.  I am pretty overweight and am able to do it with no problems.  The mile 3, which is for your legs, is kind of hard and you will probably be sore the next day of you're not used to squats and lunges.  Mile 2 is my favorite, the arm one.  It gets my heart pumping and not difficult.  If you are unsure and just starting out, I would highly recommend it!",1410825600,2,747,3.8421052631578947

3474759,5,B001AYWY5O,I like the dvd. I had it for a while before started using. I used it last night. I like how each mile is different. I don't like stopping to change menu every time. I feel my muscles after I am done. I hear so many people who say they have results that I'm going to stick with her and see what happens. I think this is a good place to start. It is definitely hard enough to get you sweating withput giving up. She is going to be my primary exercise coach. I have several of her dvds to keep in rotation so I won't get bored. I'm looking forward to this evening to work out. I will not be doint this in the morning unless on a weekend. Some people here are so picky complaining about the window with cars passing. Just do the exercises. Buy this dvd you cant go wrong.,1404172800,,767,3.987012987012987
3474760,5,B001AYWY5O,"As someone who did not exercise for years, I bought one of Leslie's DVD's on a whim and I am hooked. Although she basically uses the same steps in all of her work-outs, it is still fun to see the different people and choose another work-out for your day. Each walk is still one mile but concentrates on a different area daily. I think beginners or advanced will like it.",1403395200,,370,4.3

3474764,4,B001AYWY5O,I really enjoy this DVD of Leslie's. It moves to a good pace and although it's fun when she has the group with her I feel as though I have a personal trainer when she is by herself. I enjoy her enthusiasm and her personality and she makes the routine very easy to follow. I try doing a mile or two before or after work every day and it makes me feel great. I have a couple other of her DVDS and I enjoy all of them. This is one of my favorites. I would definitely recommend this one to anyone who likes a quick but effective workout.,1398211200,,533,3.9444444444444446

3474766,2,B001AYWY5O,"After watching the tape, for me it was confusing.  Oh sure, every day was less than 15 minutes of walking and I was able to get in some exercise but because each day was targeted for a different part of the body, on some days it was a very fast start.  I was trying to understand how, at 5 in the morning, a body could go right into this high intensity walk; that didn't work for me.  Maybe I'm not understanding what she wanted to convey with this DVD.  I'll have to get a bit more physically advanced in order to appreciate it.  Right now it feels like I wasted my money.",1397865600,,573,4.080357142857143

Each workout (warm up & cool down included) still ends up being close to half an hour long...so you're actually still getting a good amount of exercise in even if you're only doing one mile.

3474774,5,B001AYWY5O,"I have been wanting to lose weight for a while but never found the motivation to exercise. I tried a few other high impact workouts thinking they would be better but they were too intense to start out with. I researched low impact workouts and Leslie Sansone's walking workouts came up consistently with positive reviews, so I though I would give them a try. I ordered 5 Day Slim Down and 5 Mile Fat Burning Walk. Today I did 2 miles on 5 Day Slim Down along with the warm-up and cool down for a great workout overall. I was sweating and was in my target heart rate zone. I never felt so good. Leslie is also very motivating throughout the workout which I like.

I work at a hospital 3 days a week (12 hr shifts) and I'm a mother of 2 kids under 3 years old plus all the demands from the farm that we live in. This was perfect to get in a decent 20-30 minute workout. I was not someone who exercised prior to starting this video. I was active but didn't routinely exercise. I like how you can choose which mile you want to do and how there is 3 different miles set up to target different areas of the body. I am a larger girl too (200 lbs) and have knee and ankle problems so this was a great low impact workout that actually made me a little sore the next day so I knew I was getting a decent workout.

I was just looking for a guided, motivating, get moving DVD for days that I couldn't get outside...and that's what I got.  I'm glad for the option of the 5 different miles, but really they are quite similar.  BUT, it is easy enough to incorporate all of her simple suggestions/moves at any time during any of the different miles and bump it up a notch for yourself.  Overall, a good DVD to get you moving and certainly not so difficult that you dread doing it.",1389052800,,531,4.28

I have about 10 of her dvds now and was looking forward to doing some more of her new ones that I just ordered but a knee injury has put a screeching hault to that.

You can do one mile per day, yes, it is designed to help you do one mile per day which is only about 15 minutes.  You will be surprised how much that 15 minute work out per day will help you get some inches off your weight line where we carry most of that unwanted fat that is so dangerous to us.  I started out doing one mile a day and now I do all five miles each day.  It's an awesome DVD and you will be glad you purchased it.",1386979200,,575,3.7666666666666666

Music, nothing to write home about, and is a repeat of other DVDs, BUT  is okay.  Better than some other DVDs I have.  A NICE thing about this tape is she is ALONE in all 5 miles so her ceaseless chit-chat is kept to a minimum. Not a new DVD by any means.  Cover May Be New(er) , not the material. Choose the whole 5 miles, or pick you mile format.  All in all I like it.  Classic Leslie, no surprises.

This is totally doable by just about anybody who can walk. Leslie is really upbeat throughout, and does a good job of explaining how wonderful you are for walking. :)

This isn't for someone who already has an exercise routine, but it's great if you want to get started but don't want to get in over your head.

It's great that you get to choose how many miles you want to walk at a time. If you include her warm-up and cool-down plus a single mile you end up with a little over 30 minutes of walking/working out at a time. Pretty easy to fit in on any given day. I started walking with her again being VERY out of shape and over weight and have already lost 15lbs in just 7 weeks. I highly recommend any of her dvd's.,1379548800,3,563,3.7796610169491527

Take your pick of five different mile-long workouts, or do two, three, four, or all five of them in a row. I generally do two or three at a time, sometimes taking a break from the action to do waistline movements with the really cool ""longevity stick"" that my husband made for me, while Leslie continues to march and kick. (See the video below for a demonstration of the longevity stick; at around the 2-minute mark the instructor works the shoulders and waistline. My shoulders tend to bother me, so I hold the stick behind my waist; it's amazing how far it helps you to rotate!) Then I put the stick down and pick up with whatever Leslie's doing. A good workout!

3474822,5,B001AYWY5O,love these dvds. leslie sansone makes it so fun and easy to excercise. really enjoy these. the hubby is even doing them,1375056000,,119,4.454545454545454
3474823,4,B001AYWY5O,"I have several of Leslie's workouts and am always looking for something new to add to the rotation. I bought the 5 Day Slim Down because it seemed to have a different variety than her usual workouts. I also liked the ability to mix and match miles, which isn't possible with other DVDs of hers that I have.

The miles are rather quick--faster than I would walk on my own, I'm sorry to say. Miles 1-4 are about 14 minutes each.  Mile 5 is 12 minutes. The Warm-up is 5 minutes, maybe 5:30. The Cool Down is almost 10 minutes long and includes some really nice stretching. It is possible to add intensity to the workouts with hand and/or ankle weights, if desired, but I would have to work up to that.

In addition to the mix-and-match of the miles and the general good pace of the workouts, my favorite feature of this DVD is the fact that it is Leslie by herself. There is no group to distract her from giving cues, and little of the sometimes inane chatter that goes on during the group workouts.

I just received the DVD today (7/16/13), so I have not tried any of the meals Leslie demonstrates, but I plan to do so.

So far, so good.",1373932800,3,1135,4.26046511627907
3474824,4,B001AYWY5O,I've had MANY Leslie Sansone videos and DVDs.  I like that you can do as much or as little of this one as you like.  She also seems a little less annoying in this one...(you know...the overly chipper way too early in the morning thing?),1373587200,,236,4.222222222222222
3474825,3,B001AYWY5O,"I am a Veteran Walker. Leslie has helped me lose 15 pounds so far. I'm 26 1/2 years old with a BMI of 27.1. She helped me go from 170 to 158 pounds. I did the entire five miles all at once, which I normally do in any of her DVDs. With the calorie counter watch, I burned around 463 calories for the entire five miles. However, I had my calorie watch on low sensing. SO maybe at high or medium sensing you'd burn a little more.

**DVD Menu Screen Options**
1) Introduction
2) Full-Workout (all five miles)
3) Classic Walk (That's the first mile)
4) Sculpt Your Arms (Second mile)
5) Slim your legs (Third mile)
6) Trim Your Tummy (Fourth Mile)
7) Speed Walk (Fifth Mile)
8) Cool Down
9) Super Breakfast

The first mile was very 'blah' to me. There was nothing really challenging about it. When I work with Leslie I usually want to feel that push. But this DVD kind of made me feel like this is for beginners; people who have not worked out with her before. The Second mile gave it just an itty-bitty push. The third mile was when I was really getting a little drained. By She'll have you do lunges, which I don't like. So, I usually do just do squats. But the lunges don't really last through the entire mile. It's just for a small little section; maybe 2 minutes at the most. The Fourth mile has a lot of kicking and knee-lifts. And for the speed walk mile (fifth mile) it was what I was really looking for, for the entire DVD. The cool down was very full and thorough and I believe this was the only full cool down I've seen her do becuase the stretching exercises are not so brief and rushed this time.

***Pros***
1) It does get the job done. I know I said it wasn't what I was looking for, but you will indeed feel like you've done something for the day and gave your body a nice workout.

2) Her key on executing or exchanging between moves is about 4.5/5. She does surprise you rarely, but she was easy to keep up with.

3) The breakfast tips at the end were REALLY helpful. I'm not a big breakfast person but she made me want to eat it from now on. She shows a lot of tips in how to be creative and add flavor to a boring breakfast. She made eggs, oatmeal, french toast, smoothie, etc. Each food had its own section. She'll even tell you how certain foods are good for certain parts of the body.

***Cons***
1) There is no clock or mile meter to let you know what your progress is. Sometimes I felt like the miles were going on forever. But the mile meter only pops up at the beginning and end of the mile. I think each mile is like 15 minutes.

2) She's alone. I know some people prefer it this way, but she seemed so alone in that big gym. I usually like when she's very social and perky with other members. To me when others are there, it just gives that extra flavor and more to look at and observe.

3) The music was a letdown. Sometimes some of them repeated into the next miles and I'm like...'Didn't I just hear that song?'. I am BIG BIG BIG on music becuase with good or new music, it distracts me. It helps me keep the beats strong. But she recycles her music too too much to where it makes me feel like I haven't bought anything new from her other couple of DVDs.

***Neutral***
1) There were parts in the DVD that looked like the scene would abruptly cut off due to her having to step out or come back the next day. There was a part toward the end where suddenly they just stuck a new fresh moment in the mile to finish it up. I'ts kind of hard to explain.

2) The gym had no life. She had two windows that were free to glare out at. But I wish she had gotten rid of that huge black curtain and just let life and nature behind her come at us through all the windows.

3) There was also something weird going on with the nearest window close to her on the left. Sometimes I'd look at it and suddenly a house or building is there, but in other shots, there's no house but just trees and a far distant street. It kind of had my attention for a while, but it could have just been the angle of the cameras.

4) Leslie's demeanor is calm in this one. Yes, she talks non-stop but that never bothered me. But she's not as cheerful as she is in other DVDs, especially with other people.

*******
All in all, I could have done without this DVD. If you want to really work your butt off and sweat with a very high heart rate, I'd buy her -

3474862,4,B001AYWY5O,"I am a 40ish overweight, really out of shape woman with some mild knee, back, and neck issues.  This workout is a good fit for me.  Each mile can stand alone as a basic workout or you can combine miles for a more extensive session. It is  challenging but not too difficult.  I tried other workouts before I found Leslie's walking at home series. Many of the other workouts left me feeling discouraged because they were too difficult for me and the moves hurt my knees. I can do Leslie's walk at home workouts without pain yet they still get my heart rate up.  The moves are pretty basic (walking in place, knee lifts, side steps, kicks, and a few hamstring curls). There are a few other moves but if they are too difficult you simply go back to walking.  You don't have to learn any complicated dance moves.  I thought I might get bored with walking at home, but having five workouts to choose from gives it variety.
This workout probably wouldn't work for someone who is already in really good shape unless you do the full 5 mile workout each day, but it is great for those who are newer to exercise. It feels good to get moving.
The only complaint I have about the workout is that the warm up and cool down are a little on the long side.  I just fast forward through some of the warm up and do my own cool down.
If you are relatively new to exercise and need some thing to get you started, this is a good one for you.",1363132800,3,1419,4.210332103321033

3474880,4,B001AYWY5O,"The thing I like most about this DVD is its versatility. I depend on it for a quick workout when I'm short on time. The DVD consists of 7 segments - a warm-up, 5 separate miles, and a cool-down/stretch. When I've got 30 minutes or so, I do the warm-up, whichever mile I feel like, and the cool-down/stretch. When I've only got 15 minutes, I just do one mile, easing into it a bit, then spending a few minutes stretching on my own. You could do anywhere from 1-5 segments depending on your preference. One thing I don't really like is that each of the segments is a separate chapter on the DVD - no ability to customize your workout.  As for 3 of the miles focusing on arms, legs, and abs - I don't really see these miles being any different from Leslie's usual workouts - but they are good workouts nonetheless. I would love to see more short workouts from Leslie for those of us who like to sneak in 15 minutes here and there throughout the day. As always, Leslie's cuing is consistent, she's upbeat and fun, and the workouts are energizing, stress-relieving, lighthearted, and fun.",1360972800,,1083,4.442211055276382

Unlike some of Leslie's other DVDs, this one allows you to EASILY and separately select the Warmup and Cooldown for before and then at the end of your workout whereas some of her other DVDs make it quite hard to find to cool down.  Also this DVD allows you to exercise from 1 to 5 miles, each mile separate, and also including different parts of the body, so you can format it to meet your time frame to exercise that day including the Warm up and Cool down or you can start at the first, do every mile to the cool down...OR you can do one a day from Monday thru Friday, pretty slick!

3474939,4,B001AYWY5O,"First of all, I have used Leslie's walking workouts for years.  I literally wore out my VHS copies of the original WATP 1, 2, and 3 mile tapes.  After using them for so long, I was ready for a change and started looking to see what else she had available.

I bought two of her DVDs (5 Day Slim Down - A Mile Each Morning and also 5 Really Big Miles).  One thing I absolutely LOVE about both of these is the ability to select which miles I want to do.  Unlike the old workouts where it was one long ordeal (and sometimes you'd like to skip sections and couldn't), the newer DVDs allow you to walk any or all of the miles if you choose.  You can customize your workouts based on your own needs or personal preferences.  This is a HUGE plus!

On the 5 Day Slim Down - A Mile Each Morning, there are some pros and cons.  Leslie is by herself on this one rather than with the group (I personally prefer the group setting).  The camera angles switch back and forth periodically, and since it's just her, the transition is awkward at times.  The studio has dark drapes, which I realize are probably for audio/sound purposes, but I like the lighter colored studios better.  I realize this is a minor complaint, but it is a consideration.  For these reasons, this DVD is not my absolute favorite of her workouts.

On a positive note though, you *WILL* sweat!  It is a really good workout, and I keep this DVD in my regular rotation just for variety.  My favorites on this are Mile 4 and Mile 5.  Mile 5 is the 12 minute ""power walking"" and I love doing it.  I normally do the warm up, go to those two miles, then do the cool down.  In all, it takes about 40 minutes total, but it's a much more thorough workout than the original 2 Mile WATP.  You can do more miles or less if you choose.  Leslie is wonderful about offering encouragement at just the right time.  Her bubbly personality might annoy some people, but it's easy to walk with an mp3 player and the tv muted if that's a problem.

You can't beat these walking workouts for low-impact exercise.  I have arthritis in one knee (I wear a knee brace while I'm walking), and have no trouble keeping up.",1346716800,,2147,4.257425742574258

My original Leslie Sansone workout was on VHS and I had replaced that with a DVD - bringing me into the twenty-first century.  One of my favorite parts of the Leslie Sansone workouts has been seeing others in a range of condition.  It made me feel like I could do it too.  I actually felt like we were a team working together to improve our fitness.  In this video I find the pictures of such perfect people on the wall annoying - really makes me feel bad about the shape I have allowed myself to get into - the team effort is missing.  I like the different mile workouts - I miss the use of weights (which I really felt helped) - I find the cool down goes on forever and start skipping ahead to get to the stretching.  I will search for that missing DVD so I can get back to working out with other ""not always perfect"" people.",1340668800,3,924,4.221590909090909
3474948,5,B001AYWY5O,"I really don't have anything negative to say about this video. I am not a gym rat and I really dislike exercising.

I've tried a few videos and this is my favorite. For instance, Jillian Michael's 30-day shred (too harsh on the knees) and a few Shape and hip-hop ones. Leslie Sansone's:Walk at Home - 5 day Slim Down was the one I was most motivated to pop in everyday.

I love the way it's segmented into separate miles (about 14 minutes each)depending on if you want to work abs, arms, legs or just walk that day. Perfect! You can benefit from this dvd if you only do one of these per day (don't forget to do her warm up and cool down first (14 minutes combined). Nothing hurts afterward and I'm definitely working up a sweat with this one. More so, then when I walk 2 miles around my neighborhood.

She makes me giggle with her little -isms even though I've heard them before. If that East Coast accent starts to wear on you, just turn off the sound and add your own music.

Highly recommended for those:
 - looking for a low impact cardio routine
 - Live in hot climates like me and prefer NOT to walk in 100 degree temps
 - Beginners to intermediate
 - Wants to ease into exercising
 - Need to kick the ol' endorphins in high gear",1340150400,2,1235,4.266094420600858

3474971,5,B001AYWY5O,"When I first dove into the world of workout videos this was the first one that used, as suggested by a friend at the time.

I'll admit just like many people would that I truly with EVERY INCH OF MY BEING thought workout videos were lame, stupid, embarrassing, a waste of time and money, and a spectacle for when you needed a good laugh. All I could picture was my mother doing the goofy video tapes back in the early 90's with women full of bright colored unitards and tights with all sorts of cliche patterns of that era. This pushed me away from the idea even more.

My friend had been losing a lot of weight and getting in shape after she was quite heavy for a many years, as was I, but I had begun losing a significant amount of weight myself through dieting and walking around a near trail. I moved into a different neighborhood and didn't feel comfortable walking around outside, so she suggested I just give this video a shot... she even came over with her copy to try it out with me for my first time and to my surprise Leslie Sansone was a fun and comforting guide who dressed in a regular modern workout suit and had a friendly attitude, pushing me to keep up with the good work I was doing. I've read some reviews which the people complain about her talking so much, but I really think it's encouraging even when I was used to the workout and having a much easier time with it. She says some funny things which make me giggle and bring a little levity to my sometimes serious attitude about being in shape. She really is a fun teacher/instructor.

It's a nice video which can be used for anyone who's got little time to work out, or plenty of time to work out. She says herself that you can do 1, 2, 3, 4, or all 5 of the sections with each session. The first part is a nice easy warm up, the next 3 focusing on different parts of your body, and the last a faster paced, heart pumping section which lasts a few minutes less while still giving just as good a workout as the previous.

I wish that Leslie had some free instant watch videos on Netflix, but I've found some others that I enjoy (particularly the ""Crunch"" series)...

Since she doesn't, I will be looking around on Amazon to see if I can buy any others which I could enjoy just as much as this one.

To top it all off, she has a short segment at the very end which she shows you some healthier breakfast choices... which are actually quite tasty.

Give this video a shot... the price is absolutely worth it, as I payed at least double and found it worth every penny.",1333411200,2,2538,4.231404958677686

I hate exercising, but I figured that walking would be a great way to start. This DVD makes walking actually fun and interesting. It's more than just walking forward. The moves are easy for beginners but you can always ramp it up if you are more in shape. The workouts are divided into 5 days with one mile each. You can do one mile or all of them, which is nice. There is also a warm-up and cool down included, which I found very helpful.

I really like the way that Leslie Sanson interacts with the audience. She is encouraging without being forceful. I always hate it when a skinny/in shape person on a workout DVD tries to push you harder than you know you can go.

3474986,5,B001AYWY5O,"At the time I'm writing this, this DVD is selling on Amazon for $7.99 - a fabulous price for a really great at home workout. Honestly, I would have paid double that amount because this video is so versatile.

The DVD features segments that can either stand alone - basic walk, legs, arms, waist and tummy, and a fast 5-miler - or segue together as one long workout. Leslie is alone in this video and is as cute and good-humored as ever. She gives excellent cues, and I appreciated that there was no one else with her with all the joking around and wisecracking and giggling. That can get old quickly if you do the DVD several times a week.

I don't like the generic dance club music Leslie uses much at all. To me, that music is about as inspiring as a punch in the stomach. I did the video through once with Leslie so that I could hear what she had to say, but after that, I turned down the sound, put my iPod on my favorite playlist, and followed her as she moved. It worked just as well for me and I can change my tunes as I'd like, rather than listening to the same dull music over and over again.

I'd recommend this video to people of a beginning to a moderate fitness level. Your heart gets pumping and sweat will pour as you go through each segment, but when you go through all five miles, you feel full of energy instead of worn out. It is a great way to exercise, build strength, stamina and endurance, especially if you live somewhere like I do, where the snow is thick on the ground and it's too darned cold to walk outside - or when the YMCA closes because of inclement weather.",1325548800,,1591,4.2098360655737705

3474988,4,B001AYWY5O,"Leslie Sansone's ""Five Day Slim Down"" features five one mile walks (each targeting different areas); a warm-up session; a cool down session; and five super breakfast meal plans.

Day 1: Classic Walk:

This 14 minute mile is exactly what it says - a classic Leslie Sansone mile. It features her four basic steps: walking in place; side steps; kicks; and knee lifts. There is nothing too difficult - she does do some walking back and forth and double side steps but that is it. It is a pretty good workout but for some reason the entire workout only has one set of knee lifts.

Day 2: Sculpt Your Arms:

This is another 14 minute walk. It is more intense than Day 1 as it includes things like tap outs (later in the workout she turns the tap outs to lunges) and double knee lifts. While this focuses on the arms and includes things like bicep curls, there are no weights involved, although you could easily add them if you want to ramp up the workout. There is an odd editing glitch in this one, as if Leslie had more time left than she realized and needed to add more exercises, which can be a bit distracting.

Day 3: Slim Your Legs:

This 14 minute mile is pretty intense and a good workout - perhaps my favorite on the entire DVD. You modify the four basic steps by doing things like lifting your knees while doing side steps; tapping while doing side steps; and tapping with your heels while doing side steps. She even throws in a grapevine instead of side steps. To slim the legs she incorporates squats and lunges (she shows you how to modify them if you want). While there is another one of those unfortunate editing glitches, this is basically an excellent workout.

Day 4: Trim Your Tummy:

This is another intense 14 minute mile that starts out pretty intense from the beginning as Leslie quickly has you do tap outs (later the tap outs turn to lunges). To work on the tummy, Leslie uses several moves like kick backs (hamstring curls) and adding a kick while walking back and forth. The big thing here is that there are lots of knee lifts - single knee lifts, double knee lifts, four knee lifts - done several times throughout the workout. This is another of my favorite workouts on this DVD.

Day 5: Speed Walk:

The final walk on the DVD is a 12 minute mile in which Leslie amps up all her regular moves. While there are only single knee lifts in this workout, she adds some twists to her other movements.  You do sidesteps while walking up and back; instead of regular side steps you tap after the fourth step; you do tap outs that turn to lunges; at one point you even jog back and forth. Leslie also adds some enhanced arm movements that make this quite an effective workout in just 12 minutes.

Warm Up, Cool Down, and Super Breakfasts:

The warm-up lasts for approximately five minutes and incorporates Leslie's four basis steps as well as some walking back and forth and some arm movements to warm up the upper body. The cool down is a nice leisurely nine minute segment that feels great after the workout. The stretching segment of the cool down is six minutes long and even incorporates some modified yoga poses. I wasn't quite sure what to expect from the super breakfast segment but I was pleasantly surprised as Leslie showed not only scrambled eggs, french toast, oatmeal and smoothies, but a grab and go breakfast (yogurt, cereal, bars) that are so often eaten during a busy day.

Conclusion:

For the most part this is a pretty good exercise DVD. The workouts are diverse and offer you the choice of doing a one mile workout, a two mile workout, etc. and you can mix and match which workouts you want to do each day. My one wish is that this was programmable - instead the workouts blend into each other (which is fine only if you want to do them in the order they are on the DVD), and you have to stop at the end of each workout to pick the next one (the same thing happens when you want to do the cool down). Also, while Leslie mentions several times that you can do a quick mile when you don't have a lot of time, the cool down is very long so even a ""quick"" mile takes half an hour. Still, I found all the workouts on the DVD to be effective and I like the idea of mixing and matching what part of the body I want to focus on during a workout.",1323129600,9,4273,4.350502512562814
3475009,5,B001AYWY5O,"I kept checking the tracking info when this DVD didn't arrive on the date it was supposed to be delivered.  I can't blame the Amazon seller because it always seemed to be somewhere within the State of Michigan - for 8 days beyond when I should have received it.  The tracking even had the item arriving in my small town, then the next day it was back out on the road at a nearby larger town!!  It's like the thing took the scenic route.  At that point I printed off the tracking and poked it under the nose of my local postman.  He couldn't explain why it left again after arriving.  However he did finally admit that the biggest holdup had been in the Lansing routing center, which they are threatening to close down.  I know I'm supposed to be reviewing the DVD, but just wanted to take this opportunity to say, PLEASE LETS PRIVATIZE THE POST OFFICE!!!!  Christmas is coming, do we really want this kind of delivery service for the gifts we buy our loved-ones!!?!!  Now, the DVD; it is perfect for me.  I've allowed myself to get out of shape and this DVD lets me to work at a moderate pace and I can do a couple of 14 minute segments - or just one - depending on how I feel and how much time I have.  Don't skip the cool down, it helps you stretch out the muscles and that is the part that causes you to appreciate the good feeling of exercise.  If I get tired of the same comments by Leslie all the time, I just mute it and listen to Rush Limbaugh while I exercise - It's easy enough to follow without the sound.",1322870400,,1516,4.171821305841925

I have about 8 of her DVDs now...and I've enjoyed each and every one. But I have to say, I may just like this one the best...Others may enjoy her repartee with her ""sisters in sweat"" - or the walkers she has in other DVDs, but I prefer one on one, as though I have her personal attention and she teaches me about multi-muscle-walking, posture, muscles, health, even diet. In this DVD, she is so cute as she cooks/prepares basic breakfasts - practically begging us to see that it won't take much time to make something nutritious to help fuel us during the day. I'm so impressed by her outlook and her methods. I broke open this DVD as soon as I received it and immediately did all 5 miles (as I said, I've been doing her programs for some time, so I can do that) and was delighted by the targeted workout for tummy, legs and arms/upper body.

This is just not that type of workout and based on the title, I don't believe it was meant to be. However, if you are looking for a little pick-me-up, this may do the trick.

I did all 5 miles at once. I was sweating but I was at the very low end of my aerobic zone for my age (30). To be more illustrative, I burn about 752 calories doing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leslie-Sansone-Walk-at-Home-5-Mile-Fat-Burning-Walk/dp/B001F12ISU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leslie Sansone: Walk at Home - 5 Mile Fat Burning Walk</a>. I burned a little less than 400 doing this workout.

In the third mile, she does squats and lunges. I just kept walking through it though because in my mind, squatting and lunging don't count towards miles.

What I did not like was that in each mile, instead of two or three full songs played all the way through, each mile has about 5 snippets of different songs. That can make the mile seem interminable at times. There were also some points where maybe the editing wasn't too good because the scene jumps (so to speak). There were some moments where the cuing was questionable but overall it wasn't too annoying.

3475012,5,B001AYWY5O,"It was a leap of faith when I bought this - I read a gob of reviews on a ton of DVD's but this one really caught my attention.  I am an outdoor morning walker, but living rural, its just not a good idea to walk in the dark now that the days are shorter (we have snakes).  So while I'm traditionally not ""in to"" aerobic DVD's, I thought I'd buy one of the used copies of this and just see what it was about.  And you know what?  I love it!  I walk to it almost every single morning now - Leslie really keeps you motivated.  I like mixing them up (there are 5 separate miles)each day as well.  I use two pound hand weights for an added benefit and this is easy to do (I outdoor walk with hand weights).  Some days I only have time for one 14 minute mile, some days up to three.  And that's the beauty of this one - you can do a mile in 14 minutes and you are done!  For the record, I am not overweight, not trying to slim down, just want to keep my heart in good shape and that is why I walk.  That said, I find that I might add a few more steps or moves when Leslie doesn't...I also like how she'll tell you that you can ""add this"" or if you aren't feeling it, ""keep your hands down"".  No matter what level you are at for walking, you won't feel bad at the end of your mile.

I like the fact that you can do a different mile each day of the week with each mile targeting something different. It is simple to do, yet I think pretty challenging at the same time.

Mixing and matching the 5 miles keeps my routine fresh. Again this is the perfect workout for those of you needing low impact cardio.",1314403200,,514,4.161616161616162

I have had back surgery (twice) and my surgeon said walking was the best thing to do. This video is just what I was looking for.  I can customize my workout with any combination of 5 different 1 mile workouts.  If I don't have much time, I can choose the fast paced 12 min. mile.  If I have more time, I can choose 2 or more one mile workouts. I have been using this video almost every morning for about a month and I feel better, have more energy and more strength in my legs not to mention I have lost a few pounds!",1313712000,2,613,3.9274193548387095

I am doing one mile each morning before work and its exactly the amount of time I have to spend, but you can also do as many miles as you want, each routine is a little different and works different parts of the body, its not just walking!  I have already ordered another DVD by Leslie!  Great buy!",1313366400,,402,4.2631578947368425
3475018,5,B001AYWY5O,"I really enjoy working out Leslie's Walking videos. It is great having music without bad words and beats that hurt your ears. Her instructions are easy to follow and she does not look like a tramp in her outfit. Many of the songs played inspires your soul as you are working on the body! Each segment focuses on a different area, so if you really want to work on one area, you can do it daily. I like the choice to vary the areas you work on! The main thing is, if you just want to walk, you can in any weather in the comfort of your own home! I highly recommend this video!",1310601600,,574,4.043859649122807
3475049,5,B001AYWY5O,"Okay, all I wanna say is, if you are trying to decide which of her dvd's to get...this one is good.  I have a couple of her other ones, as I'm a fitness dvd junkie & love trying new ones.  This one is great, because you can jump from the main menu to a particular workout ""mile"", or do them individually.  I like to combine doing 2 miles, with the free run on my wii fit. (I turn on the wii fit, pop this into my dvd player, then switch from the wii fit, with the remote in my pocket.) :D  I'm 32 yrs old,  5'6"", 133 lbs and relatively fit(considering I've had 3 children) & she gets my heart rate up, and I literally sweat doing this.  I love cardio, because of the way I feel afterwards & and Leslie's attitude & energy is infectious.  I look forward to doing her dvd's because she is positive, authentically inspirational, and just plain fun.  I wouldn't say I've lost weight, because that wasn't my intention. For those who do have weight to lose, THIS dvd, COMBINED WITH A DECENT DIET LIMITING JUNK THAT WE KNOW WE SHOULDN'T EAT, WILL ABSOLUTELY WORK TO HELP YOU LOSE WEIGHT.
We all know, for heart-health, that we need to exercise.  I do this when I just don't feel like getting off of the sofa after a working an 8 hr job in front of a computer.  I change it up when I get bored of JM/or my wii games....but I find I always come back to this particular dvd simply because it's quick, EASY, and it works. Everyone has at least 30 minutes a day. You just have to make yourself do it!  Sorry if I sound preachy, but, I'm like you, I look for dvd's that people have had good experiences with, and I'm just sharing that this one works for me!",1309305600,3,1644,4.138364779874214
3475050,5,B001AYWY5O,"The Workouts are divided into 14 Minute segments, each a One Mile walk.  You can probably find time for 15 minutes of exercise, and it will be over quickly.  You can mix and match the segments however you like - do one, two, or all five at once if you want.  I generally do one in the morning and one in the evening - and end the day feeling great I did 30 minutes of exercise!

5 DAY SLIM DOWN includes five - 14 minute segments, one of which is ""Classic Walk"".  Three segments target specific areas - arms/legs/tummy (all while walking) and Day 5 segment is Speed walk.

*This DVD also includes Warm up Walk (5 minutes) and a Cool Down Walk & Stretch (9 minutes) which are very good to do and not always included on Leslie's DVDs.

Extra feature is Leslie doing Super Breakfasts demo.

I like walking with Leslie and look forward to the workouts.  I find her motivating, upbeat and habit-forming!
She shows how to speed up or work harder, but takes time to say do what is right for you.  On a day I don't want to work so hard, it is easy to go my own pace while watching the workout.  The moves are easy to modify (or just keep walking) so I don't hurt myself.  And I have found it possible to do more than I thought I could.

She has two basic beginner Walks at Realage.com so you can test how you like her style before you buy.  I still go back to those workouts, but it is nice to have the DVD when online is not available and the DVD has more variety and more advanced moves.",1306281600,,1481,4.114982578397212

I also love that the DVD is broken up into five one-mile walks and they are a good workout for being one mile, especially if you're just starting out.  Or you can do all five miles of workouts, one after another as you get stronger.  Give it a try....I love it.",1304380800,,427,4.096385542168675

I've also had my 9 year old granddaughter exercise along with me at home. My granddaughter did 2 miles in one session. The program has a section where you warm up before you start the actual exercise, then once you have completed your exercise there is a cooling down period. This is an exercise for all ages. You also work different parts of your body.

When I first started exercising two years ago, this was the only DVD i bought where I could actually follow and do the work-out. It was the only one that was not to hard to do.  most of the others just made me want to give up on exercise all together b/c they were so hard to do.  Now 2 yrs later I am 50 lbs lighter and still going strong.  and I still use this DVD for aerobic exercise along with some of the harder stuff that I used to not be able to do.  it is still very effective for me.

With the variety of 5 different 1-mile walking workouts, I found that I was able to work on strengthening the areas of my body that really need it: stomach, legs, waist, and arms... The workout is something I can actually do - and at the time I want, in the comfort of my own home. AWESOME!  I love, love, love the way Leslie Sansone leads us through the workout... I find it encouraging and more challenging than I thought it might be. Yet, it is really do-able for those of us who haven't worked out in a while.

I am a very busy working mom of 3 and I have tried different DVD's and other work out routines (resistance bands, etc.)  I really like this DVD because if you don't have a lot of time you can just do one mile.  With the warm-up and cool-down included it takes a little over 20 min. and definitely gets my heart rate up!  If you feel up to it you can keep going and do more miles, each mile has a different target area (arms, legs, etc.) For the price I would recommend giving this a try, especially if you have found it hard to stick to other work out routines or if you find it hard to fit exercise into your day.",1300147200,,687,3.9927007299270074

Since I had my second son (almost 7 months ago already) we have been on a health food kick, my husband has lost a whole pant size, JUST by changing his eating habits...jerk! Haha. So I have decided to start working out. For a month I was using the Fitness Videos On Demand from Comcast (I would do a 20-30 min cardio + a 5 minute abs), and doing the slim fast diet..I might have lost 2 lbs...My only result was that my pants were no longer uncomfortable tight. I got this video Monday morning, I had already done my workout for the day so I put it away until Tuesday. Tuesday I did the first 2 miles..I felt great, it was easy, a great pace, and best of all, I got to look outside at the rain and get a great walk in. Wednesday I decided to do the first 3 because the first 2 were easy enough...again it was a great pace, but I could definitely feel it was working. Now it's Thursday, and I just decided to go for it, I did the ENTIRE DVD in one session. I FEEL FANTASTIC!!! Its not to fast, its not to hard, it worked EVERY muscle in my body! I showered, and I while getting dressed I made an amazing discovery, not only are my pants no longer uncomfortably tight, but they are now loose!!! I am (or at least was a month ago when I really started to diet) out of shape, this is a GREAT way to get back into a good steady work out. It's pretty low impact, gets your heart rate up, and if you do the whole thing at once you WILL get results! (I even cheated on my diet and ate quite a bit of quacamole and chips yesterday-what can I say, I'm human!)
I would highly recommend this dvd for anyone who is just getting started on their weight loss journey, ANYONE!",1299715200,2,1734,4.028985507246377
3475122,5,B001AYWY5O,"I've done several of Leslie Sansone's workouts, and this is by far my favorite.  I like that she's the only person in the workouts; she seems to be a little more down to earth when she's by herself.  Each workout is challenging in its own way.  Day One is the basic walk.  Day Two incorporates arm-strengthening exercises.  Day Three focuses on the legs (lunges and squats included).  Day Four targets the core stomach muscles.  Day Five is a speed walk that always makes me want to jog at the end.  Also included are warm-up, cool-down, and breakfast segments.  Overall, this dvd is one of my favorite ways to get in a good workout and feel like I've accomplished something in as little as a fourteen-minute mile.",1298073600,,714,4.603174603174603

Now that I'm only a few weeks away I've cut back to about 6 miles a week.  I'm positive that I will still love this workout after having the baby to get back into shape.  The first 2 walks are what I've enjoyed so far and they are about a 14 min mile each.  The first one is a basic walk and the second is for arms so they are pretty easy to move with.  It's nice because if they get a little too fast you can just walk in place.  The 3rd walk is for legs and 4/5 are a little more like a power walk.  The 5th mile is a 12 min mile and almost like a jog.  Even though I'm 35 weeks, when I have bursts of energy this is a great one that I enjoy.  I wasn't doing anything but walking during the first 2 trimesters and started out doing about 3 miles a week working up to what I do now.  I highly recommend this for anyone who can't get out as much as they would like but still want to get some exercise.  It only takes about a half hour to do the warm-up and 2 miles which is perfect.",1297555200,,1153,3.7583333333333333

Each workout is packed with heart-pumping, calorie burning exercises that are easy to follow. You feel energized and motivated. The DVD is perfect for when you're stuck inside during winter or rainy weather and need to get some good cardio in.

3475126,4,B001AYWY5O,"I'm what one might call a 'theory exerciser', in other words, I know a lot about working out, but I rarely put my knowledge into practice. Yes, I'm pretty much a lazy butt who works out every now and then, but not often enough. Anyway, I decided it's time to start exercising again for I haven't done anything in months and, after reading great reviews about this DVD, I bought it (thanks heaven for computers, PS3 and newer versions of DVD players that play the Region 1 DVDs over here in Europe too :-)).
Anyway, I was pretty sure I was totally out of shape, but then again, walking has never been a problem for me. Namely, I can walk for hours, but ask me to run and I'll roll over and die after 30 seconds. So I wasn't quite sure what to expect and I decided to play the full workout and see how much I'd be able to do. As I kinda thought, I was able to do the full workout without any major problems, but I did break out a sweat, had to catch my breath and boy did I feel my glutes the day after! So, even though I don't think the workout is too challenging to anyone with a tiny bit of shape, it is great for those that want to go back (or get into) exercising. Besides, I can already see how I can make it more challenging for myself - simple extra weight in the hands would do the trick.

However, I do have some complaints, two to be precise:
1. she fails to remind the people to hydrate themselves, which is crucial while exercising, but also often overlooked... and since the DVD is kinda targeted to beginners, that IS something that should've been said...
2. she doesn't really show the correct way of doing the squats and lunges... and trust me, I've seen many people doing them totally wrong, in a way that it hurt ME just to look at them... it is very easy to hurt your knees, joints and even spine with these two exercises, so I really think she should've explained the proper dos and donts for them

All that being said, I do like the DVD. I just hope I'll keep my promise to myself and start working out regularly now. Wish me luck :-)",1296691200,,2054,4.171284634760705

There is a classic, 14 mins - arms, 14 mins - legs, 14 min - abs, 14 mins - fast walk, 12 mins. They all use a lot of the same moves, but they do emphasize what they say they will...except the abs could have been done a lot better. Over all a great video. They are short walks so you have time for them everyday and being able to switch it up keeps the boredom down.

The music is very good for workout music- its not campy, but it keeps me motivated and Leslie even keeps me going in between the music changes. She wants me keep on going even if I cannot keep up with her just as long as I keep moving. I take it day by day for a good 5 day slim down- I call it 30min even though most of the rigorous walks or not more than 14 mins because the warm ups and the cool downs are still stretching and working out those muscles. Only one downfall I find is there should be a warm up and a cool down after each 1 day workout because she has the full workout option that keeps going and going. but I manage by using the menu button on my dvd remote. But Leslie Sansone dvd/tapes are a keeper for a short but vigorous exercise and I even see the results in my clothes well I started with it 2 weeks ago in conjunction with my weight loss diet.",1290729600,4,924,3.946524064171123

Each mile is 14 minutes, except for mile 5 which is 12.  There is a separate warm up and cool down, so you can build any type of workout you want with the warm up and cool down added on.  Leslie is good at giving cues and adds in a few unexpected steps for variety.  This is a solid workout and would be really intense if you did all 5 miles!

This dvd is not just straight walking - you move around quite a bit. There's segments concentrating on your stomach, arms, waist, etc. And there's a quick walk for 12 min. They go by very fast. I'm still doing the warm up, plus 2 segments & the cool down.  There are 5 different parts in this dvd. Each one is 14 min. except for one, that is for 12 min.  The cool down is good also. I guess it's important to include that part. She also has an interesting chat on breakfasts. She makes 5 different kinds, that are quick & healthy, & not boring.

3475192,4,B001AYWY5O,"This Leslie Sansone Walk at Home DVD was one of three I purchased recently to add some variety to my work out routine.  While titled ""5-Day Slim Down"" it is not meant to imply you can slim down in 5 days, but that there is a different routine for each day of the week.  This DVD can be used in two ways: a mile each morning for 5 days or any combination of workouts up to 5 miles.  I did all 5 miles one day and found it an excellent workout.  Leslie is her usual bouncy and informative, as well as motivating, self.  The moves are the four moves all walk-at-home devotees are familiar with, but the music and set have been updated.  Each mile also has a different emphasis so that if you choose to do a different mile each day, you will be working different muscles.  Arms, legs and tummy each get their own mile, one mile is the classic walk and one mile is the speed walk for extra cardio fitness. I would recommend this DVD for anyone interested in increasing their activity level as it is good for beginners as well as the more experienced in-home walker.  Also included is a great feature on breakfast with some practical ideas for good nutrition in the morning.  The menus are realistic and don't push a fad-type agenda at all.  Good ideas for the whole family.",1272153600,13,1268,4.312236286919831

3475194,4,B001AYWY5O,This is a great work out video for someone who has not worked out for sometime. Due to my work schedule I never was very dedicated to working out and was very out of shape. Since I have retired i have a little more time to work out. I only do a mile a day but it really makes me work up a sweat and I feel it all over my body.  I like the fact that it works on different areas of the body everyday.  I highly recommend this work out even though it is not strenuous you can feel the difference it makes.,1269648000,6,502,3.7714285714285714
3475195,5,B001AYWY5O,"There are so many reviews for this that I won't go into detail. Suffice it to say I love this video. There is no cast --- just you and Leslie. The music is merely to keep the beat, and that's fine. Not too loud like lots of exercise videos.

You can start with a warm-up, which is on the menu, select the walk you want and then select the cool-down. The fact the warm-up and cool-down is on the menu really makes it nice. Some of her videos don't offer this and it makes it a bit rough --- you have to do your own cool-down.

These are really great exercises. You can, if you like, add boosters such as the weight belt. With all of Leslie's videos you can go at your own speed and not feel intimidated. But, the steps are all easy and natural. The video is lots of fun. Having to change the menu to warm-up and cool-down is a bit cumbersome but not bad. She goes right into the next mile. The warm-up and cool-down are a bit longer than I like. But, it's probably best to take the time and do them with her. I actually prefer her videos that allow you to do the warm-up, walk and cool-down without having to change the menu.

When you do the warm-up, the walk and the cool-down, allow for changing the menu, the times comes to an average of about 29-30 minutes.

Highly recommended.

Plus it has a separate warm up and cool down in the menu, so you can easily select what you want for the workout.  I kind of miss the collection of ""walkers"" she has in the Walk Away the Pounds collection -- it's fun to watch the exercisers - helps to pass the time.  But, as others have said, some of the quips and comments become a bit tedious  after hearing them so many times.  After reviewing this DVD and doing a couple of the workouts, I decided to buy it.  It will be my 4th Leslie DVD (plus her yoga DVD), but that's o.k.  It's good to vary them to keep motivated!",1268870400,2,736,3.918918918918919

Only drawback is that it takes 80 minutes to do the 5 mile walk with the warm-up and stretching.  However, the stretching session is twice as long as her other DVD's -- and I found it much more effective.

3475225,3,B001AYWY5O,"I own 5 or 6 of Leslie's DVDs and they are very helpful burning calories without creating injuries.  However, I was somewhat disappointed with this collection, mainly for small reasons.  The workouts presented seem less organized.  There is very little prep or lead-in for move changes, which is annoying.  The whole first mile didn't have any knee lifts, a staple of aerobic calorie burn.  The workouts are improved by carrying hand-weights (though it's not mentioned or suggested).

Good to turn to for a change of pace if you're getting bored with other DVD collections but overall disappointing.",1266364800,14,599,5.123711340206185

3475249,5,B001AYWY5O,"This  has quickly become one of my favorite DVD's from Leslie.  You can do 1 mile up to 5 with an emphasis on different areas. Before I did this one for the 1st time, I mistakenly thought I wouldn't get a good workout because there are no weights, stretchies or cords used.  I was wrong!  I do 2-3 miles mixing them up..even repeating the same mile occasionally.  I'm a fan of Leslie alone and with a group... Keeps me interested. Try it!",1263945600,,438,4.2926829268292686
3475250,5,B001AYWY5O,"In ""Walk at Home: 5 Day Slim"" Leslie Sansone bases her routines on just a few core moves. You will recognize kicks, knee raises, walking in place, walking back and forth, side steps, double side steps and kick backs. These form the foundation for all the workouts.

There are five workouts to choose from and there is also a warm up and a cooldown. You can choose to do all five. I've been working out to Leslie Sansone's workouts for years so I really liked being able to do five miles.

What I liked most about these workouts was how Leslie added in some new moves that really seem to tighten and tone the whole body. In the first 14-minute mile there is no special equipment - it is just a pure and simple walk. The second workout is for your arms. The third workout strengthens the legs with squats and lunges. I could really feel the burn. The fourth workout is designed for the core and abs. Then the fifth workout is a speedwalking workout that incorporates skating and jogging.

Throughout the workout I was impressed with the seriousness of Leslie's attitude. She doesn't joke around, talk to anyone but the viewer and generally just brings a good dose of positive energy to your day. Normally she works out with a group but in all these workouts she is totally alone. So in the end it feels more like you have a personal trainer working you out.

Some of the extras on this DVD include a segment where Leslie teaches you to cook breakfast. She doesn't really measure anything so you are left to figure that out on your own. She teaches simple recipes like oatmeal, scrambled eggs, French toast and a smoothie. If you love cooking you will be able to follow along quite easily. She shows you how to add more protein to your breakfasts.

Keep Going!"" Also There Is A Spot In The 4th Mile Where She Says She's Going To Do Single Side Steps Then Go To Doubles & Instead She Does Doubles & Goes To Single.

What I like the most is that I can combine my workout the way I prefer so I don't get bored. My favorite is the classic mile(#1) and ""slim tummy"" (#4).

The first mile is very basic, but the next 4 get more challenging.  The muscle miles are great, I don't normally get sore from her workouts but with these was definitely feeling it the next day and have already tightened up quite a bit!

Plus, you can start with the warm up before your walk and end with the cool down, as you should!

I also use a stationary bike each day, do stretches and weight training at least 2 times a week, and also work in balance ball workouts and yoga, but, I just felt that wasn't working fast enough for my weight loss and I missed that extra burst of energy and calorie burn that can only come from a fast walk!

OK most of Leslie's other workouts have this but my main pleasure is that It's only Leslie doing this one without all the usual chatter amongst the others, as someone mentioned previously the constant chatting and jokes become quite boring once you have done a workout several times.

And Leslie is the master of walking, she knows how to put things together to help you on the way.

This DVD is versatile in the ways you can work more on certain areas, and you can implement the routines when you walk outside, which I enjoy doing.  Plug in a iPod, listen to a couple of songs, and before you know it you have done a workout.

3475302,5,B001AYWY5O,"I have a very large collection of Leslie Sansone's walking workout dvds. This is my go-to workout when I don't want to do boosted walking (only in mile 5 offers a boosted walking option). I know you don't have to boost in her other dvds but it bothers me a bit when I don't do the boosting with her because I feel like I haven't really completed a mile.

I fractured my left foot several years ago and the other cardio work outs are too intense for me to do. Walking is the most safest and most knee-friendly cardio work out for me. And since 4 of the 5 miles do not have a boosted walking option, I feel better to walk the whole 14 minutes to reach a mile.

I like using the dvd if I don't want to hear Leslie goofing around with the other walkers. I can't deal with the silliness every single morning (sometimes I wake up a little too early to workout so I'm a little groggy and a little cranky).

It definitely got the juices flowing thru my joints. I love her BEBE SPORT workout outfits. If I have the time, I will do  up to 4 or 5 miles with
1.5 lb hand weights. With the hand weights, I like to move my arms back and forth like you do on an elliptical machine. I definitely see definition in my arms and delts and my legs look slimmer and firmer. My abs aren't made of steel but the kicks and the constant reminders by Leslie to stand up tall and hold/tuck the tummy in flattened my midsection. Plus, the moving back and forth with the hand weights really forces my midsection to tightne and adjust to the weights. My midsection is flat and I don't have to suck in my tummy to make it flat anymore.",1247356800,2,1604,4.115015974440895

There's also a track for warm up and one for cool down and she even has a track on there that goes over healthy breakfasts.
What I love about Leslie is her positive, encouraging attitude.  She's always so upbeat and it inspires you to either do more or just makes you feel like you accomplished so much even if you only did one mile.  It's a winner.",1247097600,,586,4.243243243243243

3475321,5,B001AYWY5O,"This is the first segmented workout of Leslie's that I've purchased.  I like being able to pick what I want to focus on - Basic 1mi (14min), Arms, Legs, Abs, Fast 1mi (12min).  I didn't mind just having Leslie and not others (Leslie is solo in these segments).  It would have been nice to have a feature I saw on another instructor's DVD, on the menu screen, you check marked which segments you wanted and they auto-played. But other than having to manually press a button on the remote to go to the next workout, I really enjoy it and am glad I've added it to my workout library.",1243814400,,580,4.302752293577981

This is a not a grunt workout. So showoffs, need not apply. However, what it does is, get you off the couch, and moving. That's enough for me. Great for cardio, and losing weight without breaking your back. The truth is, you don't have to.  This, and a yoga CD would be the perfect regime to get fit.

3475359,5,B001AYWY5O,"I've used nearly all of Leslie Sansone's workout DVDs, and find the bulk of them annoying for various reasons:  low-budget music and/or sets, poor cues from Leslie herself, unplanned routines that focus too much on walking in place, and often too many other people on the set.

This DVD, however, is MUCH BETTER as far as I am concerned.  I find Leslile to be much more likable when she is alone on the set.  Her personality is more natural and her instructions are better.  She pays more careful attention to planning the movements and varying them to target specific body parts.  This particular set is attractive and uncluttered, and the production is good.  The music is nothing special, but at least it isn't the same stuff she has used in video after video, and it isn't too loud.  Best of all, I feel like I can actually get a good workout if I combine several of the 1-mile segments to create a 3 or 4 mile routine.  I especially like the segments that focus on the tummy and the legs.",1238716800,2,993,4.472222222222222

I am amazed that a 15 minute work-out every other day is producing results!! I've been told at work that I look slimmer. I can button my pants easily now. I've changed nothing with the way I'm eating. She is easy to watch... no group of women behind her. I haven't gotten tired of her; nothing obnoxious in it. She is actually adorable.

It will only play the beginning and the ending if you try to skip which makes it hard because that is the purpose of this DVD, is to walk as many miles as you wish each day, not necessarily ALL 5. :-( But otherwise, it is wonderful. :-)",1236902400,3,513,4.03921568627451

I know alot of people think that is so much better, feel it is more like a personal trainer, but I enjoyed watching the group better. I think with a group the time goes by much faster. That's only a personal opinon though. I still would have bought the video even if I would have known this. I do recommend this video to anyone.

This one wasn't bad although I do prefer when she has other people working out with her.  This one was just a solo Leslie for all the miles.  I didn't feel like the arms and stomach ones did much work on my arms or stomach.  I did like the legs section.  Overall though it's a good basic walking workout.  I would suggest pairing this with a toning workout.,1235606400,,472,4.131868131868132

She often states that her workouts are not for sissies and that is very true but REALLY anyone can do them. You just set your own pace. I started working out with Leslie's videos on April 1st, 2008. I weighed 240 lbs. It is now February 24th, 2009 and I am happy...no thrilled to tell you that I have walked away 83 lbs!!! I went from 2X to size 12. My goal is to lose 100 lbs and I know I will get there. When I started out I could barely get to the end of the 3 mile video. I'm up to 5 miles now and I love it! I'm hooked! What a great thing to be addicted to...excerize!!! Now here's the best part....I'm 62..I'll be 63 in just a few days and the young girls who work out with me can't keep up!!!

I do three miles each evening - and the entire 5 miles on Saturdays and Sundays. Although I have 5 of her DVDs, I find myself only using this one. It is just sooo good! Well worth the money.
Since discovering Leslie, I have lost 20 pounds (in seven weeks) and hope to lose 30 more before then end of the summer. I feel like I owe her a debt of gratitude. Without her, I could not have done this.

UPDATE - April 2013:  It has been four years since I purchased this DVD.  I have bought many, many more since then, but this is still my favorite.  I sweet and work my butt off with this.  Still love it!. THANK YOU LESLIE!",1235260800,12,895,4.00561797752809

Fourteen minutes a day, plus warm up and cool down, equals one mile.  And remember, we are talking about walking indoors . . . and no equipment. . . It's a great way to get started moving.  It's not just for beginners either.  Since each mile is chaptered (five miles in all), you can walk as little as one mile or as much as 5 miles.  The moves and footwork are very easy.  Also, Leslie is cheerful but not gitty, and it's just her in her spacious studio focusing on you.  A great addition to the video is Leslie in her kitchen, actually preparing 5 quick breakfasts right before your eyes.

Leslie is chipper and friendly and she makes you want to work out. But it was the intensity level that surprised me. This is really a great workout and the moves are so easy you don't need to devote too much brain power to do them correctly. These miles make me sweat, a lot. I do have a couple of gripes. First, sometimes Leslie's cues are off sometimes which throws me off. ""Ready for sets of four? Oh no no, wait not yet."" Ack! On the 4th mile they had to splice in an extra minute or two to make for a full mile which is awkward because she explains things she'd already talked about in the beginning of the mile. Several times the camera guy gets the stage lighting in the shot and I'm not quite sure why they didn't edit those shots out. I know I'm being nitpicky but when you watch the same DVD every day these things start to get under your skin. But I love the workout it gives me so I'm shopping around for another Leslie DVD that is a little bit tougher because I know I'm going to grow out of this one eventually.",1234656000,,1176,4.1173913043478265

However, my husband prefers this workout. So, it's really just a matter of taste. I love Leslie and have just purchased my 3rd dvd from her--my first dvd from Leslie was the 4 fast miles and that one is still my favorite. Yet, this one is good-just wasn't my favorite.

She also gives metabolism boosting breakfasts tips, which total no more than about 400 cals. each.  You will easily walk that off and more if you do the 5 miles in its entirety and your metabolism will just keep on burning for hours after this one.  I've noticed marked tummy and thigh results.

Leslie, as always, gives great cues for upcoming moves (the same moves in all of her DVD's) and her message is the same - keep fit, keep walking, keep healthy.  I did all 5 miles the first day, and my hips and bottom were sore in a good way.  Music is good too - modern but not annoying.",1233878400,,443,4.25
3475429,5,B001AYWY5O,"You actually sweat while doing it. the movement is her basic ones, but the combination is very good. It doesn't need a lot of fancy movement that you need a professor to explain to you. if you just started exercising or like me just delivered a new baby this is a wonderful form of exercise.",1233705600,,291,4.3090909090909095
3475430,4,B001AYWY5O,"I haven't used Leslie's workouts before, but I really liked this workout and would consider getting other ones from her with faster-paced miles. When I use it I do 3 of the miles, including the faster one, and then add some toning and stretching of my own at the end. Due to time constraints, I can't see clearing more than an hour for a not-very-intense workout.

I think this would be great for someone starting out to exercise, who could start by doing mile 1 and then progress to adding a second mile, etc. And it's fantastic for people who can't do high-impact stuff.

One problem I have with the DVD is that it's not very customizable. For example, the 10 minute solutions DVDs allow you to choose just abs and arms, or just legs and stretching, etc, from the DVD menu and then it all plays. On this DVD, I have to pick ""play full workout"" and then skip the DVD chapters and do just the ones that interest me. This loses it a star.

I also thought some of the breakfasts she recommended looked a bit large, portion-wise, so make sure you check the nutrition value of your breakfasts if you are following her and trying to lose weight.",1233446400,2,1140,4.393364928909953

This is leslie's best so far - with 5 miles each dedicated to a different area- legs, abs, etc.  Leslie leads this workout alone, and there is a ton of her usual upbeat enthusiasm and encouragement chatter, without the jokes and giggles etc.  She incorporates some new moves with her old classics which makes for an interesting and effective workout.  I do all 5 together, but I do believe leslie when she says even one of these miles each morning would be great.

And that's saying a lot, because I love most of the others too.  This one, Leslie is walking on her own, no crew behind her.  And in each mile, she does something different, mile 2 for arms, 3 for legs and 4 for abs are really awesome!  I do the quick warm up and then usually choose 2 or 3 of the miles to do in combination.  I've noticed a real difference in my obliques from targeting abs and waist in mile 4!

At times she only cues you a fraction of a second before she does something (like a knee lift).  At other times, she changes her lead leg.  I know . . . ""You can't do it wrong.""

I like the fact that each mile targets a different part of the body.  The first 4 miles are 14 minute miles.  The first mile is a typical Leslie walk.  Mile two targets the arms, mile three the legs, mile four the waist, and mile five is the fast walk (12 minute mile).

Someone mentioned that her music was new.  A couple of tunes were new, but several of them have been on previous DVDs.  With that being said, I would say that this DVD is an intermediate level workout.  However, you can make it more difficult by exaggerating some of the movements and easier by moving at your own pace or not exaggerating the movements.  As a long-time user of Leslie Sansone workouts, I would say this just adds a new workout to my routines.  I like it because you can do each mile separately, or you can do all 5 miles for a longer workout.",1232582400,2,1254,4.776744186046511

It feels like she is talking to me and is my personal trainer.  She isn't silly and has no one to joke around with.  This is a no-nonsense great workout DVD for every part of your body.  She even cooks up a few healthy and nutritious breakfasts at the end of the DVD, which is a nice addition to this DVD.  Out of the 10 or so Leslie DVDs that I own, this is my very favorite!

I record my steps,miles and calories..and i would assume u would burn more calories in the 5th mile than the 1st or second.

This dvd is definately for people who are used to exercising; beginners- buy it- do 1/2 a mile at a time; will give you incentive and goals for yourself.

3475476,4,B001AYWY5O,"I have several of Leslie's videos and for me this is probably her best workout. It has great variety and keeps you working at a good pace. I like the music she's chosen to use -- it actually sometimes feels like you're dancing. I do wish she used (as she does in some of her other videos)a graphic on the bottom of the screen to show your progress within each of the mile segments. That's pretty minor, though.

My bigger problem with this DVD, and the reason I gave it only 4 stars, is the quality of the video itself. Leslie's face appears to be sort of out of focus all the way through -- you can see the edges of the pixels -- and I tried it on 2 separate players on 2 separate TVs. The same effect is obvious on parts of the background where there's a lot of contrast between adjoining objects. So I called Amazon's customer service to say I had gotten a defective DVD. They sent me a replacement -- very promptly, I have to say -- but it had the same problem and actually looked worse than the original.

I'm keeping the DVD because I really like the workout and will just have to overlook its poor quality, I guess. I'm surprised that nobody else has commented on this. I can't believe I got the only 2 sub-standard copies of the DVD.",1229299200,,1241,4.2100840336134455

I own probably 10 videos of Leslie's and I enjoy doing her programs.,1229299200,,348,4.242424242424242

3475480,4,B001AYWY5O,"I enjoyed this workout, but if you are looking for a toning workout for specific parts of the body, this video is NOT for you; it's really more of a cardio workout.  I love Leslie Sansone and thought that because of the workout description, the segments would target and tone specific body parts. I do like the fact that Leslie uses some unique moves, such as tap-outs and walk-walk-walk-tap series. It mixes things up a bit compared to some of her other workouts. If you are a regular at-home walker, this workout should challenge you a little more and work some different muscle groups, but don't expect EXTREME toning, like you would get by working out with weights.

Warm-Up) 5 minute light walk.

Segment #1) Classic Walk: This segment consists of a 14-minute mile. It's a ""classic"", moderately-paced walk with walking, side steps, knee lifts, kickbacks, tap-outs, etc.

Segment #2) Sculpt Your Arms: This segment consists of a 14-minute mile. It leaves much to be desired for arm toning though. I thought Leslie would incorporate either a toning band or light weights like some of her other videos. In reality, it's simply a walk that incorporates more arm movements than usual. Don't expect any visible toning from this workout. The cardio effect is wonderful though.

Segment #3) Slim Your Legs: This segment consists of a 14-minute mile. Considering that the arm segment truly didn't challenge my arms, I was a bit wary about this leg-toning segment. I must admit though that Leslie does do more specified toning in this segment. The ""toning"" consists of several sets of lunges and squats. If you are a beginner or intermediate exerciser, you will probably feel the burn and feel challenged. Again, the cardio effects, however, are wonderful!

Segment #4) Trim Your Tummy: This segment consists of a 14-minute mile. There really isn't any specific ab toning in this workout. Leslie just seems to focus and talk more about focusing on abs when lifting legs during knee lifts and kicks.  You'll hear her emphasize more than normal about good posture and keeping your abs tucked in. Great cardio, but nothing special that will target the abs any more than normal.

Segment #5) Speed Walk: This segment consists o a 12-minute mile. This is a great walk if you are short on time or would be great to pair with one of the above segments.  It should definitely get your heart rate up and is a fast-paced mile.

Cool-Down) A 9-minute cool down walk and stretching. In my opinion, the stretching segment is a bit drawn out. I'm use to just 3-5 minutes of stretching like her other videos. This cool down never seems to end.

Overall, this is a great workout, and I will certainly add it to my Leslie Sansone rotation. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I felt the description insinuated better toning than this video offered. It would be great for beginners who are working up to building endurance (they could do one mile at a time); it's also great for more advanced walkers who may consider doing the entire video in one exercise session.",1228867200,14,3061,4.756603773584906
3475481,5,B001AYWY5O,"I've been doing Leslie's tapes for about 3 years and am always excited to get a new one.  Each one I get I like better than the last.  This one is different in that it is just Leslie, none of her friends or associates.  It was actually a nice break from the usual. As always, she talks constantly during the exercises but is not irritating at all, very friendly and encouraging. I found this one to be more challenging than the other 5 mile tapes because each mile focuses on a different part of the body and it is fast-paced.  The segments are about 14 minutes each, I would have preferred faster 12 minute max.  I don't like mile 3 because it contains squats which I don't do because of knee problems, but love mile 4 (abs) and 5 (overall) and the warm up and cool down are good, too.

This features Leslie solo, with each mile featuring a different focus, a traditional mile, a fast mile, focus on abs, focus on legs, focus on upper body/arms. I did all but the ""legs"" mile when I first got it, thinking that legs were my least concern. Then I did the whole thing. The squats and lunges in the ""legs mile"" as well as some new combinations, were an awesome challenge/opportunity and got my heart rate speeding more than it had in a long time.

Some of the music is new, some of it is from WATP for Abs and earlier but sounds better. Thankfully, we are spared another round of ""New Attitude"" and ""Everybody."" Hallelujah indeed! Leslie's patter is pleasant and useful.

8280361,4,B001AYWY5O,"I love Leslie Sansone's videos!  I started with her Walk Away the Pounds 1 and 2 mile walks, and it was the first time in my life I have ever stuck with an exercise video program for longer than a month or so. That says a lot about Leslie's walking programs. I was motivated by the 1 mile walk because it was challenging, yet I was able to do it without becoming exhausted.  At first I found the 2-mile to be a bit too intense, but eventually worked up to it, and now I do 2 miles at least 6 days a week.  That video had Leslie with a group of walkers which I liked.  On super busy days I occasionally will just do the 1 mile walk, so I ordered this video just to change things up a little.  Leslie walks alone in this one, and there is a separate warm up and cool down you can go to on the DVD.  Then there are the 5 individual 1 mile walks targeting different areas of the body.  I like the music, and she changes up some of the standard moves a little to target different muscles, so you won't get bored.  I actually found these 1 mile walks to be a little faster and more intense than in the Walk Away the Pounds videos.  The only thing I did not care for was that the warm up and cool down segments are separated from the miles, so you have to change to the actual mile workout with your remote or whatever you use, and then you have to again change to the cool down segment afterwards.  For this reason I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars, because I prefer to have the warm up and cool down blend seamlessly with the workout.  With that said though, Leslie Sansone is the best!  Her upbeat, happy, personality is refreshing, and she makes you feel like you CAN do it! I am so happy to be on a regular exercise program, and I am healthier for it, because of her!
