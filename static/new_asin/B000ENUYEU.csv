2524390,4,B000ENUYEU,"See these with your girlfriends. They may not have been a huge hits on the big screen but these two movies are big hits with all my female friends and my husband enjoyed them too. These movies let you enjoy the characters and the story without the smut and violence of too many movies today. The acting was believable and allowed you to feel as though you know the characters. Just two ""feel good with happy ending"" movies for a rainy Seattle winter night.",1323388800,,456,4.440476190476191
2524391,5,B000ENUYEU,"I personally love both movies.  My husband tolerated the ""chick flicks.""  I would recommend these for a rainy afternoon...don't forget you kleenex.",1168732800,5,147,5.636363636363637
2524392,2,B000ENUYEU,"This had the potential to be a great movie.  As Hollywood is won't to do, it was spoiled by profanity, using the Lord's name in vain, indecent attire, and unnecessary references to sex.  Why do the married couples always have to be bickering and screaming?  The plot was sweet and the acting was very good, but all the aforementioned left a very bad taste in my mouth, and left me feeling like I just wasted two hours of my life. It is an old PG I guess.  I would definitely give it a PG-13.",1167177600,11,491,4.191489361702128

2524395,4,B000ENUYEU,Return to me] is a fabulous story and movie.[At first sight} is  not near as good. Val Kilmer is the wrong actor for the part in that show .Two stars for At first Sight!,1431820800,,169,3.9705882352941178
2524396,5,B000ENUYEU,"I had  seen this film before and liked it so order it so I  would have my own copy. the other film was a bonus but it also is a good film that I enjoyed so this order was extra good. How ever since I had seen Return to Me before I think some parks had been cut, possibly to make it certain time length.",1429920000,,302,3.6307692307692307

2524398,5,B000ENUYEU,"""Return to Me"" is a tear-jerker of a movie, but I love it! Just grab a box of tissues and turn it on. I love the chemistry between David Duchovny and  Minnie Driver. Having ""At First Sight"" on the same DVD was a bonus. This is also a touching movie with believable characters and an intriguing story line.

Grab a quart of ice cream, a box of tissues and settle in for an evening of riding an emotional roller coaster.",1421798400,,418,4.2125

2524403,5,B000ENUYEU,"""Return To Me"" is gripping story that fully exercises most every joyful and empathetic emotion in the human repertoire.  This production is based on a true story where a deceased loved one's gift of life is returned.  Minni Driver portrays a kind and caring recipient of a donor heart and winds up, unknowingly  falling in love with her donor's husband.  While this has every chance of appearing contrived on screen, David Dochovny, Mini Driver, Carroll O'Connor, Jim Belushi and a host of other veterans bring this story to life in the best possible way.  This is a must see but of the two dvd set but, watch ""At First Sight"" first.  The veteran of so many action pictures, Val Kilmer and his costar Mira Sorvino produce a first class show.  The problem is that you'll need a week to let down emotionally from ""Return To Me"" before you can view anything else without comparison.  This twofer is a genuine bargain and after watching, you'll agree it belongs on the bucket list.",1404950400,2,977,4.6725146198830405

2524406,5,B000ENUYEU,"I love the movie return to me, had it on VHS and it broke, so I bought it online in DVD and happy to have it in a double feature.  Used it for many years around valentines in a classroom setting for Teens to promote becoming an organ donor.  My husband received a transplant many years ago, so organ donation is close to my heart.",1389139200,,330,4.061538461538461
