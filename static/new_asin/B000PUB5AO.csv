There are also some glaring continuity errors in the film. Parts of the film seem to be lifted from 1930s or 1940s film; and while this is sometimes the case in excellent films noir (stock footage of 1930s and 1940s police cars and fire trucks in a mid 1950s noir), one must realize that these were, for the most part, B-Movies shot on extremely low budgets. But this black and white 1960s film goes way too far in using antique stock footage! But as said, the story's not bad. I'm certainly not regretful that I added it to my extensive film noir collection. And I've always enjoyed the original Fritz Lang portrayals of the super devious Dr. Mabuse. And I'm a huge Fritz Lang fan! If you haven't seen ""M"" or ""Metropolis,"" you should. And in the world of film noir, I'd highly recommend two of Lang's classics: ""Scarlet Street"" and ""The Woman In The Window."" Finally, about the print...it's an Alpha Video and I've yet be impressed with ANY of their video releases. Too bad someone else didn't get the job and find or restore a better print! It reminds me of the original release of ""Scarlett Street"" (which may also be an Alpha product); it was also godawful! If you shop for a DVD of ""Scarlet Street"" be sure to get the remastered version! Enjoy!!!",1440288000,,1422,4.473076923076923
8193446,3,B000PUB5AO,"Nice, decent little black and white German import from the 60's....Gert Frobe is good as the police inspector and Daliah Lavi makes a beautiful reporter/heroine....interesting show for those who have a taste for this sort of thing.....",1380672000,2,235,5.378378378378378
8193447,3,B000PUB5AO,"If you like over the top pulp style action and mystery, you'll like this film.  While it's a little odd to see Gert Frobe playing a solid police inspector, he does it well.  And Lex Barker (Tarzan in the 1950's) turns in a solid performance as well.  It's not a serious film, and you can make fun of parts of it.  But you have a vile villain and his insidious plot.  A damsel in distress looking for her father.  And a legion of mind controlled minions who work to carry out the sinister plan of Dr. Mabuse.  Really, you don't need much more (popcorn anyone?) to have an enjoyable afternoons movie.",1310688000,3,598,4.333333333333333
8193448,3,B000PUB5AO,"The Return of Dr. Mabuse is a really old detective story that was probably considered horror back in the day.  Ha!  Nowadays it's ""horror"" for the wrong reasons, lol.

It was released in 1961, so don't expect any flashy colors or groundbreaking special effects to grab your attention.  However, it's actually not that bad of a movie.  Oh sure, I'm giving it 3 stars, but I can think of a few other old films that so are unwatchable they aren't even worth the time of day to review.  This one though, is pretty decent.  It tells a nice Scooby Doo-like story that is probably about as believable as Scooby Doo, but still worth watching because it does manage to keep you interested in what's going on.

It mostly centers on one cop and a young 21-year old woman who goes around trying to find out about the mysterious deaths surrounding a prison.  There's a few twists that are worth noting, but I won't spoil them for you.  There's also some surprising looking deaths that will surprise you the way they're so graphic for their age.  The ending has some nice action as well.  But it's not that great of a movie to watch these days, but maybe if you're in the mood for some older films (as I was) you'll find yourself enjoying it.",1200528000,,1228,4.433035714285714
