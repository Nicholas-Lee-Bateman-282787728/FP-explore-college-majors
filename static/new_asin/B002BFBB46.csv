8361214,5,B002BFBB46,"In the same vein as the Fun with Eric in same series.  I got Fun with Eric when my toddler was maybe 18-20 months old and he loved the directed floor time with mom, with hello & goodby songs that are the same each time.  There are about 5-6 10 minute sessions which include hello & goodbye songs, short warm ups, a fun exercise activity, another rhyming physical activity, exercise review.  Very fun!",1367107200,4,400,4.4520547945205475
