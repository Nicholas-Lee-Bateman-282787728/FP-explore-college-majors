4641304,5,B005ANZN3Q,"This is my favorite (I have the bluray) piano concert in my well over 50 that I have collected ranging from Rubinstein to Horowitz, Glenn Gould, and everything in between.  Those who do not like Lang Lang's unique way of presenting a concert need not comment because this was not made for the classical music snobs (which most people, and I would agree) contribute to classical music's demise.  If you want classical music to survive, then you need to support artists who make videos like this.  There's no written rule that says a concert must be done a certain way.  If you're going to comment, comment on the actual music and not everything else going on.  Lang Lang is brilliant.  Don't hesitate to get this, unless you're also against buying and wearing jeans that have holes in them, too.  It's 2011 so let's stop acting like it's still 1930.",1325289600,20,848,4.651006711409396
4641305,1,B005ANZN3Q,"Lang Lang's an excellent and passionate pianist and can be very entertaining, but this BR is an utter disappointment. If you have Lang Lang Live in Vienna, don't expect the same level of satisfaction. This performance was at the London Round House festival which was intended to spread classical music to non-classical music fans or rock concert goers. Although his piano performance is good, the visual background (a la music video) is very distracting. It surely will disappoint many classical music fans. Half of the disk is filled with ""virtuoso"" piece which is really a self promotion of Lang Lang.",1325203200,13,603,5.04
4641306,3,B005ANZN3Q,"Much of the playing is excellent, and all of it is technically dazzling, although some of it justifies the appellation ""Bang Bang"" that has been given to this artist by some skeptics. However, the arrangement that Lang Lang plays of the ""Rakoczy March"" is clearly copied from the one created and recorded by the late Vladimir Horowitz, to whom no credit is given in the album listing. I hope someone corrects this omission as quickly as possible.
The visual presentation of the recital is distracting; the ""music video"" repeat is a waste of disc space. The documentary portion seems designed to show the artist's self-absorbed and inconsiderate side. I can't imagine why such material would be included on a disc that's sold to his fans.",1325203200,5,737,4.904
4641307,1,B005ANZN3Q,"I like Lang Lang as I have been following up his career for a number of years. As huge as his stardom is, he is not a great pianist (yet) as his artistry is still in the stage of infancy. Let's forget about his rock star status for now. In terms of pianistic capacities, Kissin is seldom matched. But I do take Lang Lang very seriously. Is he a showman? No. I think he is very genuine expressing his freedom within the right context of the music he plays. So, beyond the corny and superficial smoke & blue lights exhibited in this concert, he plays the music as it should be played based on his understanding and experience. Now let's get to the marketing side of the concert. In live concert, maybe those side shows such as flashing lights or blue smoke might excite younger generations who know nothing about classical music, but do make an effort coming to see Lang Lang live. In the sad days of claasical music with totally diminished audiences, we need to do whatever it taks to let young people experience the beauty of past treasures. In this sense, I give the promoter(s) 5 stars to pack young people in the concert hall so that classical music won't completely die away in another 5 years. But I do give the DVD one star for the viewing experience as the video director lost his sense of providing a sense of continuity of images matching the music. So, I needed to look away from my large TV so that I can concentrate on his playing AND music, of course.
My recommendation: Buy the DVD regardless to support classical music if you can. The music along is good enough to compensate the shortcomings of the visual presentation.",1325116800,8,1635,4.471571906354515
4641308,5,B005ANZN3Q,"Some strongly criticize Lang Lang for showmanship.  Such criticism should be reconsidered.  In the show I saw broadcast live he was called a ""classical rock star"".  That is true.  This is a classical rock concert.  There were no blue hairs in the audience in London.  That in itself, is remarkable;  it was the first classical concert I have ever attended where the average age was under 60.  The piano some times floated in fog, there were streams of images on light panels across the stage.  In the showing I attended, after several pieces, the audience in the theatre stood up and clapped to the screen.  It seemed totally appropriate.  The performance was superb.  The commentator is a bit underwhelming (one view is enough);  on the DVD just fast forward through it.

Each generation needs to define its own method to appreciate classical music and to approach it through the technology of its time.  I lived with scratches on LPs for years and learned to marvel at icy clean technical renditions by Horowitz.  Times and tastes change.  I'm quite sure what Liszt's audience in those salons of 19th century Paris heard was not cool precision.  Liszt, by all accounts from the time, was all ablaze in his performances.  He, Georges Sand, and others scandalized Paris;  Parisians loved it. He gave them, in this repressive, highly stratified society, new ways to see themselves, new ways to think about liberty.  Lang Lang, for this new generation of classical listeners, shares that fire.  My 17 year old son, a fine pianist, was hypnotized by the spectacle.  He came home and started playing for 40 minutes.  It was 11:30 pm when he started.  In twenty years, almost all of the current blue haired classical music lovers will be in the grave or in rest homes, myself included.  It is time to listen in a new way.  Get with the program.

Stated last, but not as an afterthought I must comment on the tenor of the whole performance.  This young man understands deeply what freedom means.  He breaks boundaries technically and with interpretation.  Isn't that exactly what Liszt was trying to do before his audiences in the mid 19th century?  ""Liszt now"" for me, means exactly that;  we're listening _now_.  It is such a delight to hear with new ears.

This is a great performance.  I am delighted it is on DVD.",1320883200,44,2312,4.75

4641310,3,B005ANZN3Q,"Lang Lang plays real good, but he was spending too much time crowd-pleasing.  Would be nice to have more actual piano playing footage.",1374969600,2,134,4.826086956521739
4641311,5,B005ANZN3Q,We enjoyed very much this concert in family. We recomend this DVD specially for children who love piano.  Very nice selection also.,1373068800,,131,4.954545454545454

4641313,5,B005ANZN3Q,Not only is the performance in London wonderful but the section on his life is very educational. Wish they would have interpreted the conversations with his parents.,1357257600,,165,5.148148148148148
4641314,5,B005ANZN3Q,"Now, let me bee very clear..... most classical music DVD's must have been processed by Thomas Edison, they are so poor in both audio and video quality, this is saying nothing about the music or musician, just the poor recordings on offer.. LANG LANG blows the doors off the studio with this recording. His playing is magical, he lives up too his reputation as a world class artist and the video arts burn the house down with the most amazing lights and camera arts, all too the highest standard.  This DVD would be worth twice the asking price just for the video work alone... a must have MUST BUY DVD and it will leave other recording artists wishing they had come up with something like this..

4641315,5,B005ANZN3Q,"Lang Lang is himself. That is his talent. We should do exactly what his teacher did many years ago. Let him play his music without interrupting him even if he maybe exaggerating. Tweet him your constructive comments afterwards. Why should we draw a cycle to surround him or to create restriction for someone to be himself? He wants to pass his classical music to the next generation, so he does that exactly by using young people's language on this latest DVD. Perhaps a middle age man like me will not like the DVD's visual presentation because of the constant flashing of visual images. Perhaps, I am like other traditional audiences who prefer Lang Lang in Vienna that not one moment the camera was point away from him. But we should not put ourselves over the benefit of next generation. Now a days, I need to email, text, SMS, facebook, twitter & MSN to my kids. We are all purchasing goods from the internet now without caring about how past generations bought goods from retail stores. The world is moving forward as well as the next generation audience. It doesn't matter if it is a rock show or untraditional classical piano music performance.  Freedom should apply to him and his producer. Let them be themselves and let next generation make their own judgements. He is the bridge to connect different generation together via classical music!",1343520000,3,1352,4.777777777777778
4641316,2,B005ANZN3Q,"It is a pop concert format. Visually stunning but there is very little to show how the music is produced.
Camera work is very distracting, changing scenes every second.
About 5 minutes in total of the program shows how the pianist produces this magic.
If you are a fan of Lang Lang's playing then I recommend you buy a CD of the concert rather than the DVD.
Surely the reason for a film of a pianist is to see how he/she makes the music.",1341360000,7,437,4.214285714285714
4641317,3,B005ANZN3Q,"Lang Lang played some good music recorded in the Blu-ray.  The sound was good and the performance, from what I can see, is good.  However, the same could not be said about the video editing.  The scenes are no longer than 2 seconds.  I suppose the person who did the video editing thought that this is a rap/pop/dance concert and kept on cutting between different cameras.  That makes watching the virtuoso performance very difficult.  This technique is used in that pop culture to hide the fact all those movements since the music is simple and the dancing repetitive.  It would be hard to say what the viewing experience would be like should a more conventional video editing technique is used.",1341100800,7,696,4.75
4641318,5,B005ANZN3Q,"I greatly enjoyed the Blu-ray of Lang Lang's Liszt concert. He is bringing something fresh and exciting to music. The speed of the camera shifts is certainly meant for a young audience,and together with the lighting and special effects...it has pop concert overtones with all the energy, technical skill and passion that Lang Lang brings to his performances. His Live In Vienna Blu-ray might better suit more traditional concert goers, but it is great to see Lang Lang's style connecting with new audiences.",1329004800,6,507,5.120481927710843

8463491,5,B005ANZN3Q,"This all-Liszt recital was a deliberate attempt by Lang Lang to reach a larger audience, and specifically, one that would not normally respond to the idea of either attending, or showing any interest in, a classical music concert.

The venue of the Roundhouse was key to this project therefore and so was the presentation which involved plenty of stage smoke screens and extensive visual effects displayed on large screens. This approach is more akin in nature to a pop event than a classical concert. The packed audience was rapt during Lang Langs playing and showed considerable support at all points where that might be appropriate. In terms of the intentions of the event therefore, this can be summarised as a major success and one which Lang Lang could be proud of.

For purchasers of this disc who might be a wider audience and one with more traditional viewers, the issue is not quite the same. The basic questions that need to be answered are simply whether the playing compares favourably with other pianists offering the same or similar material and whether this recorded experience is one that will sustain repeated viewing.

The disc consists of the live concert, a 71 minute documentary which delves into Lang Langs development and current situation plus a 54 minute Visual journey with Franz Liszt during which the whole concert program is played in the same order but without introductions and clapping etc. At the same time there is a silent film made up of impressions derived from Lang Langs concert tours. The music seems to have been recorded under separate studio conditions and lasts just over 54 minutes. There is no obvious thematic link between any one piece and the accompanying visuals and the playing seems mildly more sedate, or less expansive, than that heard in the live recording. This is a subjective response and no direct comparisons have been made.

The music therefore lasts just over 54 minutes. The live concert plays for just over 62 minutes and includes audience and performer arrival footage as well as applause and some comment by Lang Lang. About 8 minutes of this concert is therefore devoted to non-playing time. The 10 pieces played will all be familiar to many purchasers and could be loosely described as Liszt Piano Highlights. This is a reasonable, nicely varied and very enjoyable introductory selection and completely appropriate to the occasion. So is Lang Langs playing and delivery which could be loosely described as being of the moment in style and strong in audience communication.

There is less of the flamboyant than one might expect. Instead the emphasis is rather more focused upon a lyrically emotional delivery which suits the Romantic nature of the chosen pieces very well. This combination of the lyrical emotional coupled with moderate flamboyant display makes for a heady combination particularly when underpinned by a notably secure technique and an obvious enjoyment in the act of performance.

Taken on its own terms therefore, this is a completely enjoyable musical experience. In addition, for those who resist the visuals, and there will be many who will, there is always the option to either play the live concert or the visual journey bonus feature with the visuals turned off or obscured. That would seem to be a way of satisfying all.

The Art of being a Virtuoso documentary sheds an engrossing light onto Lang Langs early life and the influence of his parents desire to turn him into a star player with a demanding practice regime imposed by his very determined father. This even led to his father resigning his job to watch over his sons progress in further musical training. Eventually his role was replaced by that of Lang Langs mother who had obviously been very upset by her earlier exclusion from Lang Langs earlier life. All of this has resulted in Lang Lang developing a secure technique and work ethic that seems to give him next to no free time of his own. That he has not been psychologically damaged by this is both remarkable and a testament to his own resilience.

The imaging is of good quality HD resolution throughout but the sound is rather disappointingly only available in stereo. This is clear and precise but seems to be lacking in more range and tonal subtlety than one might expect from a team of engineers used to such a program given on a concert grand with all the recording challenges that such a piano produces. The sound is still acceptable though and an increase in playback level makes a positive improvement. The main documentary is provided with subtitles in English, German and French  essential in order to follow the important contributions made by Lang Langs parents.

In summary this disc celebrates an occasion of celebration and can be counted as very successful in that regard and it also comes with a particularly revealing documentary of considerable frankness.",1438387200,,4888,4.942752740560293

8463497,3,B005ANZN3Q,"First and foremost, Lang Lang is one of his generation's finest overall pianists spanning the core repetoire.  Always dynamic, unqiue and friendly as a person matched with a well-earned, formidable technique.  I continue to be impressed beyond his technique with his interpretative sensitivity to find the right moods and subtlety in the music.  And he is not the only Chinese artist to bridge this gap so artistically lately.  I also love the enthusiasm Lang Lang brings especially to expand his audience to younger crowds who do take to his energy and fun spiritedness.

Here we have a concert that is MTV meets Carnagie Hall that is clearly designed for Generation ADD"" who can actually process 3 frames/second music video and feel good watching it. The sea of backlight smart phones held up cast their vote - as well as added another distraction to the performance.  My main critique with the approach is not breaking traditional classical concert protocol - but that it was a totally overproduced jumble that became the show. (hint: well-produced shows enhance not overwhelm the performance).  Like another reviewer recommended, I would buy the CD which is excellent Liszt, a performer deeply revered by Lang Lang, as well as get the other available video filmed in Veinna which really goes deep into the production of the show, the artist preparation and a magnificent performance for the record books.",1410134400,3,1408,5.06926406926407
