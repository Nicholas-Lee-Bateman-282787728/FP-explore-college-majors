7904122,5,B000006805,"I am a partner with a public elementary school in the city where I live.  As a partner, I donate books and other materials to the school's library/media center, often working in conjuction with the school's librarian.  I ordered this at the request of the school librarian.  She told me how much the children enjoyed this work (hence the 5 stars).  They had used their current VHS copy so much that it needed to be replaced.  So I did.  However, we (the librarian and I) would much rather have this on DVD.  I do hope it will become available on DVD soon.  VHS players are not as prevalent anymore.  For future use, it would be better to have it on DVD.",1302220800,,653,4.330578512396694
