8617965,5,B002V3A4G4,"This book is not for the casual reader. Haney goes into great detail on the mechanics of a great swing. The book is more like a textbook on the golf swing than a quick fix. If you really want to improve your game it is well worth the effort to read this book, but you have to really read the book and work at it, not just put it under your pillow at night and hope for the best. When I read this book everything my pro was trying to tell me makes a lot more sense.",1528070400,,464,3.7938144329896906
8617966,1,B002V3A4G4,Save your $24.95 and order a golf instruction video with some actual instruction. This DVD is basically Hank Haney talking for 45 minutes and includes absolutely ZERO drills for improving your swing. Not at all what I was expecting!,1337212800,2,232,4.9743589743589745
