There are modified poses to adjust to different levels of flexibility.  Compared to today's yoga dvds, this older tape is fantastic!",1375401600,,264,4.954545454545454
8284916,5,6303893546,"I purchased this tape years ago and loved it.  Why?  because of the salutations - one yoga position flows into the next.  Recently I went to my tape/DVD shelves and could not find it.  I remembered I gave it to a friend to put on DVD for me.  So, I looked on Amazon to get another tape.  I took a chance and bought one that was in excellent condition.  I was very happy with this purchase (condition) and the content of the tape.  Happy salutations!",1312675200,3,449,4.2
