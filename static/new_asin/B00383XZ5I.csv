8391016,1,B00383XZ5I,"Sorry to say I belong to working class people, and when I see propaganda about top 1% class well..you guess the answer. The movie suppose to be a joy, instead it reflect on France upper class in field of love and sex and as I see from movie both of mentioned are in stone age. Once in a while naked bodies in private setting, long conversations about topics, supposedly important like Tantric sex and in reality they shows us nothing giving impression the french know nothing about sex.
Main chick don't have any sex appeal but this is my private opinion.
Music is not bad though.
There are some side stories namely Tantric yoga and  New Age movement and supposedly both are exceptional theories, well, they big on promises and low on delivery.
Other point is this flick supposedly about sex related activities but in reality we see nothing even close to PG-13.",1325376000,,861,4.627450980392157

8391019,3,B00383XZ5I,"When you've viewed as many of these flicks as I have through the decades, the tendency is to be hyper-critical, keep that in mind as you read this. Claudia Udy (an American though the flick is French) was attractive, had a great tan and figure, but had imperfect breast enhancement, so one was smaller/larger than the other, and  were uneven, which proved a distraction for me. It's like looking at someone with a sleepy eye...most of you won't notice or care; this is another of my burdens. Thankfully, they weren't made large, but weren't needed at all on a small frame like hers (remember what I said about being critical).

It's a French version of the 'Emmanuelle' franchise, about a globe-trotting fashion model and her fast-paced lifestyle, made 'thoughtful' by the fact her father left when she was young and never heard from again. All of the characters are superficial and nothing happens for the first 40 minutes, except we see her dress and undress -as stated, she's got a great figure, but...wait, something's about to happen, only nothing does.

So, we watch another 10 minutes, now something's bound to happen; but nothing really happens then either. Wait, a group of seedy guys walk in while she's half-dressed with her male companion, here we go finally, something's about to... wrong again. The Peter-Meter remains motionless.

We're 90 minutes into this film before anything remotely interesting on a sexual level transpires and, at this point, it's not exploitive enough to restore my interest. The Tantric sex scene amounted to a slew of fairly unattractive people having yoga sex while Tabla percussion resonated was a drag - these folks were fugly. The group-sex scene on an over-sized water-bed with oiled-up bodies was somewhat nauseating, and the finale with Joy having sex with multiple male partners while her older boyfriend watched was too brief, showed too little, and lacked the oomph to raise a ""who-gives-a-s#*t"" in me. Man, I've gotten jaded...

That's pretty much it - you decide for yourself based on these disclosures whether it's worth your time or attention - personally, I found the sequel, 'Joy And Joan', with Brigitte Lahaie, far superior though still somewhat lacking (read my review for details).

On the plus side, Severin provides us with a fantastic audio/video remastering - perfect picture with nary a blemish, sharp contrast and great color.  They always do, one of the reasons we love `em - unlike MYA releases, which are usually a travesty. Great job in subtitles as well - sharp and easy on the eyes, like Claudia Udy.

If you're a fan of 80's soft-core erotica or Claudia, you'll want to catch this and you'll probably give it 4 stars; otherwise, there's nothing here you can't find on late-nite satellite, along with some REALLY bad examples of breast augmentation...",1283644800,4,2824,4.980891719745223
