8015742,5,B0001OXPT8,"I have had this DVD for quite some time and I play it frequently. I especially enjoy the Sammy Davis Jr. segments on the Colgate comedy hour section. I think the quality is just fine on the whole DVD and I will continue to enjoy it for years to come. I agree that At war with the army is not the best of this set, but Suddenly and Royal Wedding are terrific as is the Frank Sinatra House I live in.",1300492800,4,398,3.925925925925926
8015743,4,B0001OXPT8,"Cheap Discs are always such a risk, so I'll quickly list my experience with this 2 disc set.

  SUDDENLY is a black & white film noir starring Frank Sinatra.  The print is crisp and surprisingly good, not perfect but still quite good with very good mono sound.  This film alone is worth the price of the set.  Frank looks soooo young in this and was so skinny, this is so different from the buff leading men of today.

  AT WAR WITH THE ARMY also was quite a good print.  I however was unimpressed with the movie I could only take so much of Lewis's sillyness.

  ROYAL WEDDING is a faded color print but still crisp and clear and very watchable.  This movie features the famous dancing on the ceiling routine.

  THE HOUSE WHERE I LIVE several takes of Sinatra singing this song to be used as an extra feature at the theatre, created to sqwelch anti-semitism.

  TV EPISODE of SOME COMEDY HOUR featuring Sammy Davis Jr. which was a fair to poor copy but completely viewable. This is an entertaining look at TV in its early period.",1097020800,20,1031,4.411764705882353
