8359522,1,B002AIRN78,"Being a fan of Juan Luis Guerra and having never seen him live I eagerly awaited delivery of this. Wasted my time and money. About half is live, the rest is videos and the live parts have terrible sound quality and editing. Some of it even looks and sounds like it was recorded straight off the TV with a VCR. Like I said, don't buy this crap. If anyone knows of a good live DVR with Juan Luis Guerra please let me know, because this isn't it.

En espanol; No comprar este DVR, es basura.",1275955200,7,488,4.136842105263158
