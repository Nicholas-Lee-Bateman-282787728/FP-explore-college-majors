174692,5,0988263467,"I got this DVD sets directly from Tony Northrup's website, before it was available on Amazon. Its a must have collection for any professional or layman like me who got his first DSLR recently and wants to learn basics and complexities of SLR photography. Every aspect of photography has been described in details in simple languages and with examples which can be used as home work. I am loving it !!!!

The only thing I didn't like is the price. But then its better to pay some money for a photography class which you can own forever, rather than for classes which charge $100 per hour and bombard you with info, none of which goes in head. With this you can go back as and when you want it!!!

A great DVD tutorial to have with you !!! I am sure it will make you a good photographer, like it did for me !!!",1386979200,13,808,4.240259740259741

This DVD contains a lot of information with great visual examples to assist the learning. That said, the overall quality of the blu-ray did not match the usual quality I have grown to expect from the Tony and Chelsea. The segments lacked a consistent quality in video and audio. It felt like the editor took many videos filmed at various times and places and with different recording equipment. Maybe they were going for that home video mashup? Regardless, the DVD is still a bargain and contains really good stuff for the beginner and a great refresher for the advanced photographer who is still open to learning. I highly recommend it. You won't be disappointed with your results. Spend some time watching the DVD ( or with their books), get out and shoot and try what you learned and you will take stunning photos.",1502668800,,910,4.729559748427673

7795324,1,0988263467,I can't get this to play on my DVD player. It can't read it I guess. I do have a Blu-ray player so don't know why this is a problem. Does anybody else have this problem?  The book is great and I recommend it. I thought watching the video would be helpful.,1482537600,,255,3.9038461538461537
7795325,5,0988263467,I give 5 stars for the CONTENT but about 2 stars for the actual bluray.  There were MANY instances of skipping and strange artifact around the top of the screen.  Maybe I just got a bad disc???  Volume isn't consistent throughout the video--sometimes I had to turn the TV up into 50's in volume only to have my eardrums ruptured when the segments changed.  I'm not sure if that is a production issue or goes back to the bad disc.  The content is very helpful and I have other educational materials from Tony Northrup. I would recommend his material to anyone who wants to get into photography!,1482364800,2,593,4.5046728971962615
