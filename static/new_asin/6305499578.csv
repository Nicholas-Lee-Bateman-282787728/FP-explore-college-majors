1038942,5,6305499578,"""Simply Irresistible"" is a light-as-cream love story that stars the beautiful and talented Sarah Michelle Gellar as a suddenly good chef.  She falls in love with Sean Patrick Flanery's character, and the wonderful  magic begins.  This film is so incredible.  The story is trite, but one can  hardly resist being drawn in and captivated by it.  Watch it with the  person you love.",952041600,,379,4.920634920634921
1038943,4,6305499578,"I wrote an earlier review, saw it on cable, and didn't find anything special about it. well, i watched it for a second time, and taped it, and it actually was good.  maybe this is one of movies you need to see more  than once before you decide whether you like it or not, if that makes any  sense!  it is a cute little romantic comedy, it has a very fairy tale like  quality about it. i would now recommend it!  smg is smashing!",950140800,,428,4.035714285714286
1038944,5,6305499578,This is a really cute movie!  Sarah Michelle Gellar and Sean Patrick Flannery do a great job.  It's funny and very enjoyable and is certanily a must see!  Hope you enjoy it.,949795200,,173,4.34375
1038945,5,6305499578,Well i really liked the movie !  It was a very cute movie and it had my fave star in it !  Sarah Michelle Gellar could make any movie great. It showed the meaning of love and how you work for something that you want you  will get it.,949708800,,233,3.7142857142857144
1039128,1,6305499578,"even if you like farie tales, this may test your threshold for pain; a horrible fantasy that rips off ""Like Water for Chocolate"" and  feels like a lead weight after ingestion; very cloying and devoid of  much-needed whimsy, it's like watching a clown trying to dance with cement  shoes.",966816000,2,286,4.795918367346939
1039129,4,6305499578,"Well Sarah managed to get away from the vampires, but she can't seem to steer away from the supernatural. It's a story about a girl that wants to be able to cook something amazing, and when she buys a magic crab (it  sounds strange but you'll like it!) and really throws herself into it, it  turns out her emotions are being thrown into her food. And when she meets a  great guy that it's hard for her to get, things get really  intresting.
Orginally titles Vanilla Fog (Which I thought was much more  appropiate)Simply Irrisistable is a great story about love. It has it's  funny points (the Men think about Sex this many times a day speach)and it's  romantic points. If you like a good love story. Watch this!",964828800,,711,4.465116279069767
1039130,2,6305499578,"Well, believe me, I am the biggest Sarah fan in the entire world.  But this is not her type of movie.  The storyline made no sense.  I rented this, and then I watched it when it came on HBO to try to figure it out  more, but NO.  I couldnt.  The only funny part is her friend Nolan in the  movie.  So that is all I got to say about that.",963273600,,337,3.647887323943662
1039131,5,6305499578,"Eventhough I love Sarah Michelle Gellar in Buffy and her other the movies.  I would have to say that these is one of her best movies. I'm not saying  that it might be an oscar winner. But it is a really nice, funny romatic  movie. That People should see. It is very suitable for kids, I bought it  and they love it. I recommend this movie for everyone to see. It's actually  nice to see a movie that they don't have to wear g-string or sexy outfit for  once.",961804800,,458,4.089887640449438
1039132,2,6305499578,"The whole way through, I kept on thinking, this is sooo *Like Water for  Chocolate*, a far better tale of the magic of cooking. There is one scene  almost IDENTICAL (a tear in the food causes everyone to cry). I thought  about whether it was a homage or a rip-off, and decided it was a rip-off.  That movie used magic realism; this one simply uses magic. And not that the  magic makes any sense. Where'd it come from? Who knows? There's this cute  wittle crab that serves no purpose. The romance is contrived and rather  unoriginal. It doesn't offer too much in the way of entertainment. At least  by the end of the movie, I had stopped seeing Sarah Michelle Gellar solely  as Buffy (she is very Buffylike in the beginning). There is also a very  sweet camera shot involving lots of mirrors that is the best shot in the  entire movie. Overall, a mediocre movie that doesn't ever rise  above...anything. Well, except the floor, in a couple scenes involving that  ""magic.""",961632000,3,970,4.569767441860465
1039133,4,6305499578,"I saw this on the road. I don't quite understand the bad reviews. Some people just can't tolerate a good, clean, fun, romantic movie. Were you hoping for more skin? Perhaps the script could have been tightened up but I  thought it was just wonderful. Definitely a chick flick, but I have two  teenage daughters in my house and I'm sure they and my wife will love it.",961545600,,366,4.367647058823529
1039134,5,6305499578,"My children and I went to see this film in the theatre because we are all Buffy fans.  We all loved this film, and have bought it, and have watched it over and over again.
I think to enjoy this film, you need to  ""suspend your disbelief"" a bit more than in most films, but that  is not a bad thing.  When we watch Star Wars, we have to believe something  far more ""out there"" than what this little film asks of us.  It  is very true that humans have very few DIRECT rewards in life.  Food is one  of them.  That's why it is such a big thing in religious ceremonies,  celebrations, weddings, families.  To build a film around the concept that  something magical can happen with people and with food is not too much of a  stretch.
And the actors are lovely in this film.  They are funny,  sweet, sincere and believable.  Magical things do happen to people in love;  creativity happens.  This film just brings some of those things  together.
We thoroughly enjoyed this film, and urge anyone to see it, but  please see it with the same mental set that you would give to a fresh  reading of any fairy tale.  Be willing to believe in magic, to believe  people can be more than they seem.  You'll be glad you gave this one a  chance.",955929600,2,1226,4.244541484716157
1039135,5,6305499578,"Simply Irristable is the most beautifulest movie I've seen in a long time.  See it and you'll know what I mean.  Relax and let the magic take you, for it will.",955497600,2,159,4.096774193548387
1039136,1,6305499578,"My husband and I were on vacation.  We were tired and hungry from a mall outing, and decided to go where it was cool, and rest and snack on popcorn.  WELL, that was the only reason that we stuck it out in this movie.  Dumb  and corny; the jokes weren't even funny.  In fact, while the credits at the  beginning were still coming on, we knew we were in trouble.  But what the  hay, we got to rest for an hour.  I wouldn't waste my time on watching it  again at home.",953337600,3,465,3.9565217391304346
1039137,4,6305499578,"I rented this movie recently and I thought it was enjoyable. It was enough for me that I kept repeatedly watching it, four times, until I had to return it to the store. I am actually thinking of owning a copy just in  case I will have the craving to watch it again, regardless of what people  think when their opinions don't matter.",952992000,,332,4.253968253968254
7890500,1,6305499578,"Sorry to those who liked it,but I (a TOTAL romantic comedy lover) thought this was the STUPIDEST plot for a movie. A movie about a magical crab???? Was this serious? I honestly could not get passed the crab to even attempt to take the rest of the movie seriously. The actors were good, as they usually are in their roles, but this crab just made it laughable. I am actually shocked at how many people liked it. Not being sarcastic, just really surprised. My sister and I rented it and were just belly laughing through the whole thing about the crab. We still joke about it as the worst movie we have ever seen. She's a total independent and foreign film junkie. I am a romantic comedy/ big american production type fan. Both of us agreed on this. It was just a really bad premise.",1134086400,5,780,4.386206896551724
7890501,5,6305499578,I loved it!!! I've always like magick and stuff and SMG is a great actress!!! This is one of my two favorite movies!!!,1080950400,,118,4.173913043478261
7890502,4,6305499578,"A cute fantasy love story. If your looking for a sappy happy ending love story, this is the movie for you.",1029196800,,106,4.095238095238095
7890503,1,6305499578,"This is one of those romantic comedies that you will try so desperately to like but will probably come out disappointed.  The plot has Gellar as a chef, taking over a little restaurant but struggling to keep it afloat with her terrible cooking.  However, with the help of a magical crab her love for businessman Flannery starts going in with her food, making the restaurant a real hit with people all over town.  Of course this is one of those deals that sometimes comes off sweet and sometimes comes across as sickly.
Gellar is just about the best thing about this film, playing equal parts naivity and independence perfectly.  She proves herself more than able not only as the layered character of Buffy, or as the vamp in 'Cruel Intentions' but also as the girl next door.  She manages to carry off even the most cringe-worthy scenes, such as where the two are carried into the air on a whisp of blue smoke, with a sort of light-hearted ease that works well.  Indeed, the acting here really isn't the problem.  It's the execution of the magical parts of the movie that don't sit right.  The winking crab among the pots and pans was a terrible idea and the desserts that make the eater horny is an old ploy that fails in this particular movie.
Yet even with these inconsistencies the film is still very dull, and any movie that's dull is surely a failure.  At the end of the day though you feel most sorry for the actors, all of whom are so much better than the material given here.  Watch 'Cruel Intentions', because it's much more enjoyable than this.",1025395200,,1555,4.521428571428571

7890505,3,6305499578,"This movie had an attractive cast and wonderful sets.  I can see why so many people (especially the younger set) give it such high marks.  I thought it was cute, but it really could have been so much more.
There were too many questions left unanswered.  1) Who was the guy in the square?  An angel, a fairy god type. 2) Where did all of this magic come from?  Was it the crab, the fairy god guy, the earrings or her mother? 3) Were the 2 main characters in love because they developed a relationship, or was it the magic? 4) Most of allHow could that crab just keep hanging around kitchens and not wind up in a pot of boiling water?
All of these and many more will still be left unanswered at the closing credits.
Simply Irresistible felt like a cross between The Butchers Wife & Mannequin.  A pleasant way to spend an evening, but I don't want to see it again.",997833600,2,861,4.219512195121951
7890506,5,6305499578,"I am a big fan of Sarah Michelle Gellar and I've seen her movie before where she plays Amanda Shelton who runs the Southern Cross Restaurant in which the movie was filmed on location in New York City and the best part of the movie is Katalina's music video,""Bewitched,Bothered & Bewildered"" in which shown after the movie.",995068800,,322,4.666666666666667
7890507,1,6305499578,"I would just like to say that this was the corniest, stupidest, and most tedious movie I've ever had the displeasure of viewing! There was no chemistry between Sarah Michele Geller and Sean Patrick Flennery and the humor was too dry. The movie was cheesy...you could see a string attached to the fake crab for heavens sake and the viewers were supposed to think it was real! Not to mention the fact that the movie just goes on and on and on...UGH! Sarah Michelle Geller is a talented actress and it's a shame to see her in such a turkey. The plot shows little direction and is of VERY little interest. Geller plays a lovelorn chef who meets Flannery by accident. She chases a crab (one that wouldn't pass for real even to a five year old)under a table and accidental grabs Flannery's leg. Then after that, many ""magical"" instances occur between the two. In short, the movie tried to be something it wasn't; a magical romantic comedy. A can assure you that the movie was neither convincingly romantic or funny and as for magical, it just passed off as annoying and corny. If watching stupid films exasperates and disgusts you as much as it does me, stay away from this movie...IT'S POISON!",981676800,2,1188,4.582159624413146

THERE IS A MAGIC CRAB eh, this movie is  terrible so bad please don't get it i urge you",968025600,,116,3.64
7890509,1,6305499578,"I can honestly say that this is one of the worst movies that I have seen in a very long time.
Sarah Michelle Gellar is a bad chef/owner of her  mother's restaurant until a little magic intercedes.  Suddenly, she becomes  a fabulous cook.  Her little elcair puffs send people into fits of lust.  When she kisses Sean Patrick Flannery, she floats to the ceiling.
The  plot in this book was very weak.  Sarah Michelle Gellars acting job was  tepid at best.  I think that this movie had the potential to be fun, if the  directors had decided to go the ""corny"" route.
Don't waste  your time on this.",966988800,4,594,4.407407407407407
