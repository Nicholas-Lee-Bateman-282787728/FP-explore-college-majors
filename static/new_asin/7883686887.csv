5903084,3,7883686887,"I love Hayao Miyazaki's work and this is an incredible release, however I rather wait out for a legitimate release of a STUDIO GHIBLI box set. There are so many greats films from that studio that aren't from Miyazaki that deserve attention. This is great for die hard fans but I imagine most fans here already own every copy included in this set. So if you must have the extras, go for it, but for the steep price tag of already owned movies, I'll remain hopeful and wait for a release entire Studio Ghibli collection, especially the films not available in the US.",1438560000,28,564,4.485436893203883
5903085,4,7883686887,"Following the Japanese, European, and Australian collections, it is finally time for North America to get their own Hayao Miyazaki box set. Similar to all other releases, it includes all 11 movies directed by the legendary director:

* Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro
* Nausica&auml; of the Valley of the Wind
* Castle in the Sky
* My Neighbor Totoro
* Kiki's Delivery Service
* Porco Rosso
* Princess Mononoke
* Spirited Away
* Howl's Moving Castle
* Ponyo
* The Wind Rises

All box sets differ slightly in what extras they contain (artbooks, interviews, exclusive contents, etc). And this release is almost exactly the same as the Japanese one, bonuses include:

* Yuki no Taiyo (Yukis Sun), a 1972 television pilot based on a manga by Tetsuya Chiba that was directed, storyboarded and animated by Hayao Miyazaki
* Episodes 26, 27, and 41 of the 1972 anime series Akado Suzunosuk (Little Samurai), featuring storyboards by the filmmaker
* Uncut version of Miyazakis Retirement Press Conference
* The Great Dichotomy: Looking at the Works of Hayao Miyazaki by Tomohiro Machiyama (book)

All of this in one package?, you say. ""Then why not rate it 5/5 stars?"" On paper, it definitely should be a 5/5 product. However, the main issue I have here is with the North American Blu-Ray transfers themselves. For movies like Howl's Moving Castle or Spirited Away, the NA versions are the best around. No contest. Unfortunately, movies like Castle in the Sky, Princess Mononoke, and Kiki's Delivery Service only feature ""dubtitle"" tracks. If you don't know what dubtitles are, here's a definition I pulled from google:

""Subtitles are a literal translation of the spoken Japanese dialogue printed as text at the bottom of the screen, timed to coincide with the spoken dialogue. Dubtitles consist of the dubbed script printed on the bottom of the screen during a Japanese language presentation of an anime series, as though the dubtitles were accurate, literal subtitles. Dubtitles are essentially a way to offer an English translation of Japanese dialogue without actually having to literally translate the exact spoken Japanese language. Dubtitles usually will not present an exact, accurate translation of the spoken Japanese dialogue, and sometimes may appear on screen even when theres no spoken dialogue occurring at all because the dubbed version may include English language dialogue during times when there was no spoken dialogue in the original Japanese version.""

To some people, especially the ones interested in watching the movies dubbed, this might not be a big issue. To others, it is quite the deal-breaker (search for: princess mononoke blu ray dubtitle screwup). The movies affected are the three I previously mentioned. As for the rest, the only other two cases of getting the ""inferior version"" are Ponyo (lossy Japanese audio) and Nausica&auml; (burnt-in dub credits). These are not as egregious as the dubtitles in my opinion, but still something to take into consideration.

In conclusion, would I recommend this collection? Depends. If you are a purist and are mostly interested in watching the movies in Japanese subtitled, the best bang for your buck would be to sign up for the Disney Movie Club, order all the ""good"" North American releases, and import the rest from Japan or Taiwan. You would probably end up spending as much as the asking price of this collection. If you are a collector who is interested in having all the movies in a single package + the extra goodies, or are looking to get into Miyazaki's work via this collection, I think it offers great value. You're roughly paying $25 per disc with tax included. In my opinion, even the weakest Ghibli film is an experience worth watching, the level of skill, artistry, and imagination that goes into every single one of these movies is something that can only be rivaled today by a studio like Pixar. These are movies can be watched time and time again and delight its audience every time. This is the main reason why I'm buying this myself: to show my friends and family why I love these Studio Ghilbi so much, also becase as of yet I own none of Blu-Rays.

5903087,5,7883686887,"Personally, the price tag is a bit steep for 11 films IMO, but it's what can be expected from Disney distribution.  That being said, the presentation is fantastic.  The case for the book is beautiful and my kids love flipping through the pages to pick their movie.  For any fan of Miyazaki, this is a no brainer.  The case is very similar to the six film box set for Star Wars that came out about 5+ years ago.  For those who have not seen all of these films and are considering it because they just know a few of them, it's worth the pick up.

Only downside, is there is no digital download, but these films aren't available digitally right now anyway . . . which is why I ended up purchasing the box set.",1518480000,,706,4.192592592592592

I was going to buy the blu rays for my oldest nephew.  But honestly, he loves drawing and music and the lack of extras discs makes this a pass.  And the price of around 20 dollars a movie is prohibitive to me.  I could afford it if I really wanted to, but it doesn't seem to me that at its price point the production values are making it worth spending the money, especially because we own them on dvd already.

His work is inventive, clever, and visually stunning.  I bought this box set for my wife for Christmas as she is a huge fan and I've enjoyed it nearly as much as she has.  The set itself is incredibly well-packaged, durable, and attractive.  The soft-matte style outer box and inner ""book"" is particularly cool, with each page housing a different disc.

Up on my scan. I had not heard of this but went ahead and made the purchase. Yes its pricey but not much more than buying individual disks. Well watching Mr. Miyazaki's work in high-def blew my eyeballs out of my head. It was like seeing his work for the very first time. I cannot emphasize how important it is to see his work high-def. The detail artwork is simply incredible. The Disney packaging is also very well done but there are no extras on the disks themselves and disks are placed naked into the cardboard soft sleeves without a soft fiber envelope as high end releases will do.

The art style, music, animation quality, vision, and story-telling is phenominal. Heck, I got a Porco Rosso tattoo after watching one of the films. I love it.

5903160,3,7883686887,The Blu Ray remasters look great and the packaging has potential but Amazon's poor product protection diminishes it. My collection arrived dented along the spine and the gold paint that was on the embossed lettering and images was rubbed off in many areas. Normally I would not care about these issues but at the price of this collection I expect something of much higher quality. If you can manage to get a collection in good condition it is worth the price but in the condition I received it I cannot give it much praise.,1481673600,3,523,4.574468085106383

Glad to own the majority of his masterpieces but kind of regretting spending over $200 on the collection. $130-$150 is the ideal price that should be place on this in my opinion. If you love Miyazaki's work along with anything Studio Ghibli has released, I recommend this set (although not paying over $200 for it).",1481155200,3,425,4.461538461538462

I am returning this item myself because it is nowhere near what was advertised. All the DVDs do have a Japanese option but none have Chinese. One of them (Spirited Away) is only Japanese or French. There is also Spanish. So there, two languages not even advertised in the description and one language advertised nowhere to be seen or heard. DO NOT BUY THIS. The amount of frustration I feel at this moment cannot be put accurately into words, save mentioning that at this time my roommate is standing over me to ensure I keep this poor review civil and free of vulgarity.",1479168000,37,717,4.480916030534351

For the longest time we couldn't find an English dubbed VHS copy since the town video store went out of business and that was back in mid 1990's.

This was such an amazing find because you get everything at much lower cost than you would if you bought it all separately plus you get all the cool extras! Also it's the original english subtitles so you don't have to deal with the inconsistencies!

Only issue I have is that it's sometimes hard to get the discs out of the sleeves without putting finger prints on it. Actually I haven't had a time where I didn't get fingerprints on it.",1476748800,,523,4.447916666666667

Miyazaki undoubtedly was a genius,  on a league of his own.  the animation is absolutely breathtaking and stunning and the storytelling is heart-stirring and awe-inspiring.

Included in the box set are the following movies, arranged according to, from our most favorite to favorite (i can't say i have any least favorites ;-) :

-Spirited Away
-Howl's Moving Castle
-My Neighbor Totoro
-Castle in the Sky
-Kiki's Delivery Service
-Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro
-Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind
-The Wind Rises
-Porco Rosso
-Princess Mononoke
-Ponyo

Since the Secret World of Arriety was not included in the set, we had to buy it separately.  if you don't have any individual blurays yet for the movies mentioned above, then this is a must have. the price of the set is a steal as buying the bluray discs individually will cost you a lot lot more.  the only thing you will miss from buying the set are the special features, which honestly i don't mind at all, i think it is only a minor downside compared to having to own these 11 animation gems.

5903199,4,7883686887,"A super deluxe, hefty, well manufactured box set for some of animation's finest films ever. Miyazaki's filmography ranks among the best ever, and this set comes close to honoring his work. This set undoes the travesty of these films' previous US Blu-ray release, by including PROPER English subtitles for all films in the set. These are literal translations of the text - not Americanized alterations - and are true to the films' script. For hardcore Miyazaki fans, this is enough of a reason to trade up for this set.

For most people, this will be a perfect 5 Star set. A few things about the set knock it down a star in my book, though. First off - the actual graphic design of the set seems a lacking. I'm not loving the ugly font usage throughout, including the cheesy looking disc book and booklet. The set seems to be going for the same style as the Japanese Miyazaki box set, but it misses the mark. In addition - the filmstrip 'belly band' around the set is impossibly tight on the box - it's impossible to remove or replace on the set without damaging the sturdy box. It's way too snug, so it's essentially useless. My box has marking up the edges thanks to this design oversight.

Other than those minor issues, the box set is a masterpiece - definitely worth the $125 I paid during a Gold Deal.",1468972800,,1306,4.483193277310924

Upon receiving it, I noticed the bonus disc kept falling out of the disc booklet and found that the last page (bonus disc page) was ripped so it wasn't able to hold the disc. Upon looking at the disc I noticed there were some scuffs on the outside edge, which most likely occurred during shipping since the disc wasn't stuck in place due to the ripped page.

They are fantastic and of beautiful quality.  The bonus features aren't amazing BUT they're a nice touch.  The interview of Hayao is funny enough to watch people repeatedly ask ""But really, are you making another film?""  and having him politely respond with, ""No.""  But I wasn't interested enough in the other episodes Hayao helped create.

We must have watched the VHS 1,000 times. Now that they are older we bought the DVD so we can watch it again only to now hear the Fanning sisters as Satsuki and Mae. It's just NOT the same.

5903237,5,7883686887,"I've been a huge Miyazaki fan since I watched Princess Mononoke for the first time ever. The artistry, story and music enveloped me into a world filled with both beauty and strife. Ever since that moment, I searched for who this director was and fell in love with his entire series of movies. There are few animation directors who are so consistent in creating fantastic worlds and characters. When I saw that this Blu-ray collection was coming out, I knew that I would have to purchase it. If you are here, I am sure that you already know of the quality of the films themselves, so I will leave you with my impressions of the Blu-ray collection itself.

Pros:
Beautiful 1080p versions of all the films.
 Sound quality is top notch, allowing the viewer to enjoy the wonderful soundtracks of each film.
The packaging is exquisite! Worthy of the films held within (beautiful art spreads for each movie, in chronological order)

Cons:
 No special features This was huge for a few people but since most of these can be found on the internet, it really didn't bother me.

Summary:
If you want to have a collection of Hayao Miyazaki's films in beautiful HD, look no further. This is the collection for you.

p.s. Be aware that this is NOT a Studio Ghibli collection as it does not contain other Ghibli movies such as ""The Cat Returns"", ""Grave of the Fireflies"", ""Pom Poko"", etc. This isn't a drawback, just an FYI for people who don't read.",1458432000,,1434,4.603921568627451

5903270,5,7883686887,Excellent box set. My only gripe with it is how the disks are stored inside the cardboard sleeve which forms a booklet of sorts for the disks. Repeated use will not only cause damage to the sleeves but I can also see the disks themselves getting damaged. I would recommend backing them up.,1453593600,,289,4.471698113207547

I am not sure if it is worth the price.  Maybe stick to buying the films separately? I usually buy the DVD/Blu-ray combo packs.  I don't see the appeal here.  However, speaking of Miyazaki's films -- all are must-sees!  This collection/set needs to be improved.  Starting with packaging that is not paper thin material.  Could use lots of improvement on packaging material specifically.  I do like the white/gold design.  I just think it needs to be a little more.  Maybe someone else could offer more input on that.  What I would love to see is a collection of these films with digital codes.  I don't know if that is something that's available, but who wouldn't want these with them films wherever they go?

The booklet that accompanies the movies is in no particular format, which makes it pretty fun to read instead of annoying--like a random smattering of factoids on each film. The casing leaves a bit to be desired-- this is cheap yall. Instead of a wrap for each film, it's a little envelope of cardstock...so if you pick up the case the wrong way, all the movies can fall out. Also, Disney added some strange PSAs on smoking to the films.",1453161600,6,476,4.420454545454546

All the remasters for HD are really high quality and make Miyazaki's work more stunning than ever.  My only complaint is the lack of a couple of films in the collection.  I knocked a star for it, but overall it's a very well put together box set, and if you're a Miyazaki fan with some extra cash to invest in this collection I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase.",1453075200,,523,4.416666666666667

I have been a Miyazaki fan for a while and asked for this for Christmas. I hadn't seen a lot of these movies before, but I was completely in love with Spirited Away and Ponyo. My anime-hating boyfriend bought this set for me and has actually watched a couple of the movies with me and has enjoyed them. The animation is beautiful, the stories are excellent and the set is very comprehensive. I do wish; however that this ""complete"" set had included Sherlock Hound.

My great-granddaughter having grown up with these movies on VHS, noticed this right away. Disney has slowly been changing their dubs slowly over time, She first noticed it with Kikis Delivery Service and when I purchased this set for her for Christmas she noticed it right away when she put in My Neighbor Totoro, she is very disappointed that Disney has changed these.

We paid a good chunk of good money for this, and they can't even correct kiki's voice, or give us each of the full movies without taking out funny character development scenes. It's no wonder why Disney's stock is dropping like a bag of smelly balls. Let's hope that Studio Ghibli will come up with an alternate box set that the fans will actually appreciate.

5903295,4,7883686887,"If you're interested in buying this you already know how amazing these movies are. Hayao Miyakazi is a one of a kind filmmaker, and each of his works can be labeled a masterpiece. The set looks gorgeous, and the build quality is excellent/thick.

The reason I only gave it 4/5 stars is because I feel it does have design flaws. The film strip that wraps around the set is an impressive looking touch and I really love little details like that, it's too tight though. Once you take it off you should never put it back on. Not only is it a pain and might cause damage to the package, it's so tight that the ink used on strip will actually rub right off the corners when you're trying to slide it off the set.

I love the way the discs are presented in this set, it's like flipping through a story book, and the images they use for each film are beautiful. I hate how the discs are actually held in; they slide out of the side of each page. Maybe it will be better with bluray discs, but The Beatles remastered CDs use this same design of sliding the discs into a cardboard holder....you literally can't take those out once without them getting scratched up..as stated maybe bluray discs will hold up better than a cd, or maybe this package won't be so rough on the surface, but I feel like I'm just going to end up buying generic cases for each movie. I would be pretty mad if the set ends up destroying itself.

This really is a beautiful looking set, and this will probably end up being a little bit of a collectors item down the line. If you're a fan of Miyazaki, and still have to buy all his films then go for it. If you're thinking about just buying this because it's a new/singular release- only do it if you're ""that"" into collecting. You're not going to get anything new out of this really, but wow look at that packaging.",1451174400,,1829,4.280346820809249

5903301,5,7883686887,"My wife and son gave me this collection recently.  We have been watching Miyazaki's movies since my son was six or seven years old, or at least fifteen years.

Today we watched ""My Neighbor Totoro"" from the collection.  This was the first Miyazaki movie we had ever watched, so it was the obvious choice for our test of the new collection.

The images on the blu-ray disk are astonishingly crisp and clear.  We have watched various versions going back over the years.  The artwork has always been a particular strong point for this movie, so the crispness and clarity was tremendously exciting.

The editing and the dialog were much better as well.  While I'll always like the 'dust bunnies' of our first experience, the 'soot gremlins' of this translation were equally charming.  The charming 'gollypollywogs' word is missing, sadly.  More fundamentally, the logic of the story flows much more clearly in this rendition.  Little connecting bits that had been edited out of the previous American release are back, so now the 'why' is much more easily discerned.  And a number of hilarious touches that were missing in the earlier versions are here (e.g. the small totoro eating the umbrella leaf after the ceremony with the seedlings).

All in all, one of our favorite movies of all time, just better.",1450569600,,1301,4.885844748858448

Don't let the upfront cost put you off: this box set is an excellent value when you consider you're paying the usual $17-22 (the price on this set has fluctuated from $165 to $225) per Blu-Ray, BUT you ALSO get an art book and a GORGEOUS flip book case containing the discs (see my video for a quick demo -- I had trouble understanding exactly what I was getting just from the product images) -- and it all comes wrapped up in a lovely filmstrip belly band featuring images from the included films.

The movies I've watched so far have included English, French, and Japanese audio tracks. Caption options have included English for the Hearing Impaired (dubtitles, I think?) and English subtitles (which more faithfully translate the original Japanese). I prefer watching the movies in their original Japanese with English subtitles, so I was pleased to find the Japanese audio (at the time of my purchase, the product description didn't specify which languages were included).

I've only watched the older movies so far (e.g. Nausica&auml;), and the video quality isn't what I'd expect from a Blu-Ray (these don't seem to have higher resolution than my old DVDs of the same films); I'd assume this is because these older videos simply weren't made with the higher resolutions we expect today, and as best I can tell, they haven't been ""digitally enhanced."" This doesn't detract from the experience at all for me -- in fact, it's endearing to see the unadulterated originals -- but just be aware.

The movies, in alphabetical order, are:
 Howl's Moving Castle
 Kiki's Delivery Service
 Lupin the Third: The Castle of Cagliostro
 My Neighbor Totoro
 Nausica&auml; of the Valley of the Wind
 Ponyo
 Porco Rosso
 Princess Mononoke
 Spirited Away
 The Wind Rises

My only regret is that this doesn't include Studio Ghibli's The Cat Returns, but since Miyazaki didn't direct that film and this is technically a Miyazaki box set -- a superb one at that -- I can overlook it. :)",1450396800,10,2637,5.511166253101737

The box itself is beautiful and has a binder around the front with a still from each film on it, which is a cute touch. The booklet provided contains enough information on each movie to be informative but not content heavy, which is also good, The artwork on the sleeve of each movie also look great and gives you that 'collectors item' feel to it

There are no 'dubtitles' which was my biggest fear. You have two subtitle options, English (for the original Japanese audio) and English for the hearing impaired (for the English dub of the movie). All movies play fine on my Irish PS3 so region doesn't appear to be an issue

The only problems with the collection (which everyone has mentioned)

- No special features for any films. Minus the bonus disc, although nice, doesn't compensate for the missing features

- The English audio for Kiki sounds rather tinny at times. Not sure if this is a problem with this particular set but it does take away from the movie at times

The set was a bit smaller than I expected but that's a good thing for shelf space. The film strip around the box is beautiful though extremely tight (If someone knows how to remove the clip to be able to flatten it [for a frame] without damaging the strip please let me know) which worries me about trying to remove and put it back on time after time. The discs are stored in a great looking sleeve which had quotes and amazing screen shots from the films. However the films contain no special features at all. There is a bonus disc but that appears to be more Ghibli stuff, which I will love I'm sure, but as a person who loves commentaries and featurettes for films this is a big disappointment. A final small negative on the sleeve was that the last few pages had a glue or some other adhesive still present so, even when opening very slowly and carefully the first time, there is now a small imperfection on the pages of the sleeve where the adhesive was. It isn't a huge issue, but for the amount of money we are paying for this set to be a collectible I'm a bit disappointed.

Lastly the included book. It is MUCH smaller than I thought it was going to be however the essays on the films really do make up for it, think Criterion level.

Overall, even though I've written a few negatives down here it doesn't take too much away from my excitement over FINALLY having all these films in one place. I'll be watching them soon, I was playing Battlefront last night, and may update this if anymore Positives or Negatives come to life.",1447804800,14,1630,4.302931596091205
5903320,5,7883686887,"Hayao Miyazaki is one of the most influential animation directors of the past 30 years. His work has been cited from John Lasseter to Terry Gilliam. His work often features strong female protagonists, the duality of nature of technology, environmental conservation, and are strongly anti-war. This collection features 11 of the feature films he directed which is, minus short films and a cult music video, the majority of his work. I'd rate all the films a 5, even the weakest ones are far above average. They're a must watch.

The Castle of Cagliostro
Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind
Castle in the Sky
My Neighbor Totoro
Kiki's Delivery Service
Porco Rosso
Princess Mononoke
Spirited Away
Howl's Moving Castle
Ponyo
The Wind rises

But I'm rating the packaging here, so how is it? Well, in short I love it! But I also recognize that it has limited appeal. Please read on. The package itself is a thick slipcase with a too-tight band  holding it together that depicts film reel-like snapshots of the films. A nicely edited book details some of the themes and elements of his film. Instead of individual slip cases, a hardcover book holds the discs in sleeves. The book and sleeves are made of thick stock, very durable with a glossy finish, and feature impressive artwork from the films. I was afraid the packaging would feel cheap but not at all.

What you're getting here are bare bones, no frills, discs containing Disney's blu-ray transfers. There are no specials or extras (granted, so does the Japanese collection) aside from a bonus disc which contains a short pilot called Yuki's Sun, three episodes of a TV show called Little Samurai, and Miyazaki's retirement conference. The biggest win here is that each film features English and Japanese audio (sometimes French or others) plus subtitles from the direct English script (aka ""dubtitles"") and a more direct translation from the Japanese script. Some movies, like Kiki's Delivery Service, were criticized for their ""dubtitles"" which sometimes made no sense when paired with Japanese dialog although on the other hand the subtitles on the movies without dubtitles would often have issues when paired to the English dub. So now you have the choice to watch a film in English with the literal English script or Japanese with the more direct script and that's fantastic.

Whether this collection is right for you is dependent on how badly you want a centralized collection of movies. Going by the average price of the individual films, the collection is more or less the same as buying each blu-ray (and you'd also get the DVD with it). If you own even a couple of the blu-ray releases then I find it hard to recommend. And while the loss of special features isn't a big blow for me it's still value that this collection lacks. Personally, I was moving from DVDs to blu-ray when this collection was announced and hopped on it. After selling my old DVDs I'm glad I made the upgrade. As a snapshot of a single creator's body of work, especially one that's so important, I can't help but recommend this to those getting into Miyazaki or looking to rekindle that old love.",1447718400,18,3127,4.815642458100559
5903321,5,7883686887,"This set looks incredible! With the current remastering they will look and sound fantastic too.

5903322,5,7883686887,"INITIAL REPORT: THESE ARE NOT DUBTITLES! I only have a few minutes so I've only gotten to check Princess Mononoke so far, but I just wanted to get the word out there.

I don't know a great way to find out if the subtitle tracks were done specifically for this release or if they come from a previous release, but I repeat, these are not dubtitles (unlike the individual Disney releases recently). If anyone knows how to check, here's something to compare from the beginning of Princess Mononoke:

ENGLISH SPOKEN LANGUAGE TRANSCRIPT: ""In ancient times the land lay covered in forests, where from ages long past dwelt the spirits of the gods. Back then, man and beasts lived in harmony. But as time went by, most of the great forests were destroyed. Those that remain were guarded by gigantic beasts, who owed their allegiance to the great forest spirit. For those were the days of gods and of demons.""

JAPANESE TEXT TRANSCRIPT: ""In ancient times the land lay covered in forest. Here dwelt the spirits of nature from time immemorial.""

JAPANESE TEXT TRANSCRIPT FROM THE DISNEY RELEASE IN 2014: ""In the ancient times, the land lay covered with deep forests, where, from ages long past, dwelt the spirits of the gods.""

At least for Princess Mononoke, this is a completely different disc than the one in the individual 2014 Blu-Ray release, which is very very good news! No dubtitles!",1447718400,103,1381,4.7615062761506275

5903324,2,7883686887,"I'm not the type to go all angry consumer but...

This set has NO bonus features on the movies. The problem is that there's no real reason for them to be missing.

From what I understand, all the special features are on one single Blu-Ray disc in the individual releases. Meaning: the movie and the special features weren't on two separate discs but on one. So when I saw the disc count for this set months ago, I figured that they'd be the same discs. At lest with the Marvel Cinematic Universe Phase 1 set you got an idea that the Iron Man discs would be missing, but here...no one would have a clue.

But no...these single discs have, for whatever reason, been simplified to just have the basics: the movie, audio, subtitles, scene selection....

The problem I have is that they (Disney/Buena Vista/Amazon) could have EASILY used the same discs that are on sale individually. But instead they CHOSE to make separate discs just so ""Miyazaki Collection"" can pop up on my PS3?

I'm thankful to have this set, but...all in all...I have to buy these movies again at some point. I just figured for what I paid here...there was no reason to take anything AWAY from the package.

So all in all, considering I'm gonna have to buy all the movies again at some point, I paid $200+ for really nice box (it is nice), a cool booklet (it is cool), and a bonus disc...

I also think it's wrong for them (Disney/Buena Vista/Amazon) to not give any warning on Amazon's page or anywhere that they were making simplified discs. With all the love in my heart, it was a really stupid idea. I'm still gonna enjoy what I feel I OVERPAID for, considering these are lesser discs, but I'm not gonna enjoy paying almost $200 again to re-buy these movies again.

I really hope the ""MCU"" Phase 2 box set isn't like this; I don't think that would make much sense either.",1447718400,159,1842,4.477611940298507
5903325,3,7883686887,"Some brief observations about the set:

-The film strip bellyband is a really nice touch and probably my favorite part of the set, tbh (except for the movies, obviously). It is a snug fit though.

-Considering that it was $200+, I thought that Amazon would use something other than the same cardboard package (that it was shipped in) that they would use for a $7 blu-ray, hence, my copy had some dents on the side.

-The box sleeve and the blu-ray book are nice, sturdy, and have the same matte feel as the Star Wars complete saga set. I don't love the design, but I don't hate it either. The discs come in sleeves most similar to the Indiana Jones set, but they feel prone to slide out more easily in this one.

-The discs themselves are just about the same as the individual Disney releases but do NOT come with any special features. As other users have pointed out, the dubtitle issues have been fixed. It does however come with a bonus disc with a couple of special features [unaired Miyazaki pilot, a few episodes of a show he did, his retirement conference (this guy retires as much as Michael Jordan)].

-The booklet is kind of cheap and flimsy; quality is closer to a CD insert than a Criterion booklet. Great essays about the films and Miyazaki though.

Verdict: Unless you go the Disney Movie Club route, the Disney Miyazaki blu-rays are all still around $20 (some temporarily on sale for $13 online and at most Costcos), so you may save a few bucks and a lot of shelf space with this set. It isn't perfect and decidedly bare bones, but if you're a Miyazaki fan and don't want to buy the 11 movies one-by-one, the Australian version for ~$400, the ugly European version, or the Japanese version for ~$1,000, this is your best option.",1447718400,20,1743,4.5
5903326,5,7883686887,"First and foremost, let me start off by stating this Collection of Movies is not for everyone...but it should be.

For the past 30+ years, Hayao Miyazaki has been the Industry Standard on how the Quality of Animated Movies should be produced. John Lasseter (Toy Story Franchise, Finding Nemo, WALL-E) has stated that Hayao Miyazaki ""...is the most Original Film Maker ever to work in our Medium."" And there are few who would deny that statement.

This Collection is a Celebration of a Film Maker that will never be replaced, never be recreated, and will never be forgotten. This Collection is designated for Purest Studio Ghibli Fans. Sure Studio Ghibli has released amazing films without Miyazaki at the helm, but those are for the 'Studio Ghibli Collection'.

As you can read, I'm not here to explain each and every Movie that is included in this Collection (all are Masterpieces) but to emphasize the importance and Historical Value of the contents in this Collection. This is Original Movie Magic. This is not something 'Just to Have' in your Movie Collection, this is something you Cherish. It is the least we can do, for all the memories and fantasies that Hayao Miyazaki has given us.

If your a fan on Animation -- or Motion Pictures, this is the Box Set for you.",1447718400,288,1271,4.763636363636364
5903327,4,7883686887,"I am in love with this boxset. I'm just glad I am able to own all of Hayao Miyazaki's films in one beautiful, convenient collection. I admittedly only watched 4 of his films in the past so I am beyond excited to have a nice Miyazaki marathon weekend up ahead. The collection is sorted in a nice booklet with all of the films placed in their own individual sleeves. The boxset also comes with a nice bonus booklet containing the creative process behind all of his films. I was lucky enough to receive this boxset a day before it's suppose to be released so I was really happy about that.

Now the reason why I am giving this collection a 4 instead of a 5 is this...the bonus features are extremely sparse. The only extras on here are on a separate bonus disc with episodes from some TV-series Miyazaki directed, and a press conference revolving around Miyazaki's retirement announcement. Usually I am not one to complain about bonus features, but this isn't the DVD era anymore; I am sure Disney could've easily added at least some extras on each of the Blu-ray, especially considering all of the memory space blu-rays have. But unfortunately there aren't any to be found. I probably should've done some more research, but I guess I was expecting too much.

Otherwise, this is a great collection that I am proud to own. Buying all of his 11 films individually would've been a hassle and would've taken up more space on my media shelf (god knows I need a new shelf). At 219.99, this is still a cheaper alternative when compared to buying all individual blu-rays at $25-$30 brand new retail.  At the end of the day, the movies are the reason why I bought this boxset and that is exactly what I have in my possession today.",1447632000,5,1719,4.520900321543408
5903328,4,7883686887,"Why do I love Amazon? They get me my merch early. I'll get to the point: This is a great set. I like the packaging, it feels good and while I'm normally against the cardboard sleeve style, the discs smoothly slide in and out with no issue. The booklet contains Miyazaki's proposal and intentions for each film project, which is fascinating for fans and gives insight to the way a genius director operates.

To those concerned about the ""dubtitles"" issue from previous Disney/Ghibli releases, the options for Castle in the Sky, Kiki, and Mononoke(and every other disc I checked) include two separate English options: English(the direct translation) and English For The Hearing Impaired(transcript of the dub). I tested Kiki, Mononoke and Castle with English audio and English subs. They're different scripts. So, if this was a sticking point for anyone, don't let it be.

On the other hand, the reason I can't give 5 stars is that there are ZERO special features for any of the films, and no they're not all on the special bonus disc. For the price it would have been nice to have a truly complete set, but who am I kidding I wasn't going to watch any of that. Still, for those who are you are going to need the individual releases.

5903330,4,7883686887,"It's nostalgic to think that the last time I ordered a set of Ghibli films from Amazon was the Kiki/Laputa/Spirited Away DVDs that came out so long ago! That said, I'm excited for this box set because I have always been on the fence about purchasing Ghibli's Blu-ray sets but never got around to it - and I imagine others in my situation will find this to be the perfect chance to add the bulk of the studio's films to their collection. This is despite the flaws of the dubtitles, which I am honestly torn about.
But I am much more torn about the exclusion of the fantastic music video ""On Your Mark."" Another user posted the unfortunate circumstances of this piece's absence in a comment on another review, but in fear of it being lost I will try my best to add to that. While Ghibli was in charge of the animation of this music video the duo responsible for the song, Chage and Aska, got into some trouble with the law that made a stir in Japanese headlines. Because of this, Disney (and NOT Studio Ghibli) excluded the film from the original Japanese box set.
Studio Ghibli seems to not have been happy with this and extended a written apology on its webpage. But they didn't stop there: the studio offered Japanese patrons who bought the set to send in their proof of purchase in exchange for a copy of the film on Blu-Ray. I am hoping that Studio Ghibli extends this offer to American and other overseas customers who may want a high quality release of this short film that is as much a quintessential entry in  the works of Hayao Miyazaki as any of the feature length films already included in the box set.
A majority of fans are aware of the dubtitle issue but I hope that receiving a copy of ""On Your Mark"" is also given enough of a push by the community so that hopefully something gets done upon release!",1445644800,8,1814,4.382789317507418

8603857,5,7883686887,"This collection is the best thing I have ever purchased.  It is why money exists, why it is a medium of exchange that permits us to gather up some hours on the factory floor or in an office or in the field and trade them for a man's life work.  Because that's what this is.  Hayao Miyazaki is rightly legend for his masterful animation and directorial skills combined with his deeply insightful approach to human nature and relationships.  But it is not until you see his movies together as a whole that you even begin to grasp the depths of his talent.  These films are like chapters in a man's life, each one building on earlier themes, re-examining them, and then propelling those lessons forward to the next chapter.  And yet each is wonderful and accessible in its own way, often featuring protagonists and narratives that resonate with children and adults at the same time.  Castle in the Sky overlaps with Nausicaa overlaps with Spirited Away overlaps with My Neighbor Totoro in ways that can only really be appreciated if you watch them in close proximity, and it is incredible how doing so with people younger and older than yourself will cause different generations to see different things and give you a deeper understanding of both the films and each other.  When I watch Ponyo with my daughters, we enjoy it from a youthful perspective of exploration, testing boundaries, and young love.  When I watch Ponyo with my parents, we enjoy it from their perspective similar to the retired old ladies in the film as an older, watchful generation that sees change as a force to be appreciated as much as feared.  This is a gift.  That his films can simultaneously resonate with people three generations apart is impossible to the point of seeming like a magic trick, yet occurs as naturally as breathing.  All I can ask is that you trust me on this and buy it.  This is what it is to be human.",1525996800,4,1898,4.613095238095238
