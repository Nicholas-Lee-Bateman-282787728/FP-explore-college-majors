7854650,5,6303890148,I for one thought that this movie was the best documentary yet. I felt it was enjoyable and it tells you much more about the daylight and how it helped us get out of the great depression. The only thing that i felt was missing were the fact that there weren't any subtitles nor did the credits give a good description of the theme music at the ending of the program which is what brought out my childhood days of seeing this engine on video. I've heard so much about it and I'm just so touched right now but other than that they did a good job with this film.,1254441600,,559,4.090909090909091

The distictive ""Daylight"" color and markings of this very recognizable train if you colect model trains or enjoy the real thing are unmistakable. This video must have been made by a true train enthusiast because every aspect of it right down to the railroad sounds (in hifi stereo) are on mark. The actual train trip is very beautiful. This video is an example why so many people love trains. There is a great bond between these rolling tons of steel and the land which they traverse.",1053648000,,544,4.677083333333333
