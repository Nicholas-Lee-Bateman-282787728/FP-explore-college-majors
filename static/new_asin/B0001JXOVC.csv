2005799,3,B0001JXOVC,"This movie is a good one, but it could have been much better. If you go in expecting a period action piece, you will not be disappointed. Those expecting something along the line of ""Braveheart"" be warned. Tom Cruise is enjoyable, but he gives his standard performance. Which is to say that you do not see a character like he is capable of giving, such as Ron Kovic in ""Born on the 4th of July"" or even Lestat in ""Interview with the Vampire."" Instead you get Tom Cruise as an angst-ridden, recovering alcoholic that looks great in a kimono. But the performance still works, it's just shame about the missed potential.
Ken Watanabe is very charismatic as the traditionalist-turned-outlaw who tries to hold on to the outdated beliefs of the samurai. The chemistry between he and Cruise is very good and it's one of the more pleasurable aspects of the film. As well as the much too short screen time of Billy Conelly and Tony Goldwyn. The cinematography and the costumes are also great and are bound to get oscar nominations.
Unfortunately this film buys into it's own granduer, and it falls short on that level. There are some great moments in the film, don't get me wrong. Edward Zwick proves he can still crank out a battle scene and he clearly outdoes himself in the last battle of the film. Even when you know what the outcome will be. But that's where the film should have ended. Instead you get another ten minutes of an eye rolling, very sappy resolution. I'm not sure if this was the product of Zwick or the suits at WB, but does not work.
Another scene I found difficult to swallow was an assassination attempt. Great fight choreography, great action, but awkwardly placed and no justification for it. You can almost hear a studio exec say ""This is Japan. So where are the ninjas?"" If the gunpowder obsessed emperor and cronies sent the assassins, (which is whom you assume sent them) why did they use ninjas instead of rifleman? Thereby proving the effectiveness of rifle over swords. It's because it makes for a great action scene, that's why, and the audience will eat it up.
The film is good and I recommend it. But be warned that at times it comes across as very contrived. I was hoping for an epic, instead I got a really good action flick. Three stars instead four due to studio induced Oscar pandering",1070409600,8,2316,4.583132530120482
2005800,5,B0001JXOVC,"After scanning some of the negative reviews posted here I must say I am shocked to learn that ANYONE could find this movie anything but exceptional. The words ""boring"" and ""tedious"" have no place desrcibing this exceptional film. It's beautifully shot, wonderfully acted, full of humor, poetry and sensuality and considering the fact that it is of course A MOVIE (for those of you overly concerned with real looking sets, etc), I was mesmerized and entertained for the 2 plus hours I was watching this great movie. My wife, who reluctantly attended the sneak preview, fell so in love with this film that she insists on seeing it again on Friday when it makes its full release. There will always be the inevitable haters and those comparing it to Dances With Wolves, etc, but disregard those folks and go see what is sure to be an Oscar Winner. You won't be disappointed.",1070409600,14,870,4.730263157894737
2005801,5,B0001JXOVC,"This film is a must see!!!  Tom reaches deep down for the emotions expressed in this film.  You feel every ounce of his anguish and regret for the terrible things he's done in his war days. I agree with the critics (something I rearely do...) when they say this film is of epic porportions.....  This film moved me very deeply, but it also had a touch of humor here and there..just enough. I can't wait until it's released so I can see it again!!!!",1070236800,11,448,4.309523809523809
2005802,5,B0001JXOVC,"I was able to see an advanced showing last night and i was very impressed.  I had very high expectations going into it, and I was not let down.  Tom Cruise is very good (as usual) and does not just rely on his good looks.  The movie moves along at a pretty good pace and doesn't seem like 2 and a half hours long.  The film is also very beautiful to look at.  One word of caution for some viewers: The Last Samurai is one of the most graphically violent movies i've seen.  If that does not bother you, I strongly encourage you to watch it.  I thought it was an excellent film and the theatre roared with applause after the film was over.",1070150400,14,637,4.088709677419355
2005803,5,B0001JXOVC,"I was able to catch a sneak preview of this movie. This movie is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. It has action, humor, and lots of emotional moments. I don't have time for details. This is a movie that should not be missed! Forget Master and Commander and Timeline, GO SEE THIS MOVIE!",1070150400,10,303,4.066666666666666
2005804,5,B0001JXOVC,"This movie was so great in all aspects. Tom Cruise excelled as the leading role. He brought humor, emotion, and charisma to his part that I really didn't think he could pull off. All of the Japanese Samurai characters were great and you will come to love them as the movie goes along. You can see why Cruise's character would rather live with them than his own people. The action scenes were awesome, but much more gory than even I expected. Those samurai swords can do some gruesome things. The movie is never boring, and it managed to keep my attention for the full 2 hours and 30 minutes. This movie is easily going to be nominated for best picture, music, and set design at the 2004 Oscars. Go see this extraordinary Movie..I guarantee you will be glad you did.",1070150400,12,765,4.4714285714285715
2005805,3,B0001JXOVC,"In The Last Samurai, director Ed Zwick creates a beautiful epic that alternates wildly between almost over the top and just perfect.
Perhaps it was the effort to keep the dark balanced with the light that lead Zwick astray in the opening and closing scenes. Either way, the sad first and last impression we have is of characatures rather than characters.
What a shame that these weak bookends embrace such a solid middle act. Tom Cruise, as a recovering cynical ex-soldier Nathan Algren, does finally triumph, returning a solidly intimate performance. His interactions with the people of the remote villiage where he is kept, half prisoner half patient, are both touching and extremely pleasant to look at. Though almost painfully intimate, Algren's confrontations with and concessions to Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), Taka (Koyuki), and the sons of the village are almost more epic in nature than the great battles that follow. Each face fills the screen just long enough to give us riveting portraits that are at once immediate and deep.
It is thanks to such artistry that when the final battle comes, with its emphasis on process rather than product, we believe and care about what happens.
Certainly this film is worth watching more than once. However, I'm not sure it will be one I'll remember a decade from now, and in that sense, it isn't quite epic.",1070150400,2,1353,4.93859649122807
2005806,2,B0001JXOVC,"I really tried to enjoy this film. I really did. I like Japanese culture and I like Tom Cruise. Unfortunetly both of them were  not good enough to make this film.
The film involves Nathan Algren a US army officer in the 1870's who is tortured by what he did to the Native Indians and is now trying to drown his sorrows in a bottle. Given the opportunity (ie. the chance to make money) to teach the Japanese army. He takes it and moves overseas. Due to a mishap he ends up living with an outlaw group of Japanese Samurai who insist on clinging to the ancient ways. And fights on their side.
To put it simply the film is BORING!!! And it copies almost verbatim from Dances With Wolves. Also I may be affected by my reading of Chinese/Japanese philosophy...but I did not understand why the Sammrai sacrificed themselves in battle when it was more than clear that they were going to loose from the get go. This was not a battle they had to fight.  Their behaviour was very much a sense of ""cutting off your nose to spite your face."" Didn't make much sense comming from such intelligent characters.
One thing I liked about this film was that it wasn't condescending to the Japanese people.  The Tom Cruise character actually plays second fiddle to the Ken Wanatabe character.
It's no secret that Tom Cruise would like to get an Oscar. And he thought that a film like this would make him a shoe in....after all look what Braveheart and Gladiator did for Mel Gibson and Russell Crowe respectively.  But cool sword fights and epic battles a movie do not make. A decent plot would help and it was lacking in this movie.
Better luck next time.",1070064000,14,1633,4.451505016722408
2005807,3,B0001JXOVC,"I went to a ""sneak preview"" tonight and came away a bit underwhelmed.  It's not the worst movie I've ever sat through; I found myself checking my watch only a few times wondering how much more I had to sit through.  A few interesting characters (I liked Ken Watanabe), but nothing really original.  Cliche upon cliche.  A yawner mostly, but it will entertain people who have not seen any other movies.
For me personally, the most remarkable thing about the movie is how fake the sets and special effects looked.  Sailing into Yokohama harbor looks ridiculous.  A street scene at night in Tokyo (where Tom Cruise is surrounded by swordsmen) looked entirely like it had been filmed afterhours at Universal Studios in Orlando.  Many of the entirely predictable battle scenes look like they are just hundreds of actors outdoors pretending to kill each other.  It will be interesting to study these scenes in freeze frame on DVD to see what everybody was doing.",1070064000,6,956,4.822085889570552
2005808,5,B0001JXOVC,"A very promessing film, The Last Samurai talks about something that is sacred to many of us: Honor. The willingness to live in accordance with a code honor in all aspects of life. This is shurelly depicted in the conflict beetwen two very different universes and ages. Tom Cruise's character is ecxactly like this. His niilism and desilusion with the west is replaced by respect and ultimatly union,when he fights the samurai for the first time. Being captured by the enemy he actually finds his peers. All of these men and women become his brothers and sisters living under one of thinking that is juste like his. Looking at the trailer i can garantee a superb blockbuster i tell this.",1068163200,20,686,4.725

2005824,5,B0001JXOVC,"As I was watching, ""The Great Wall,"" I couldn't help remembering just how truly great this movie, ""The Last Samurai"" is. Both movies are different of course, but I do think of ""The Last Samurai"", often in these troubled times we are all in as fellow humans. The clashing of the traditional warrior who lived and died by the code of honor with the new machine guns and canons is so heartbreaking and sadly foretelling of our advancements in modern warfare. To go from fighting man to man to using a machine to destroy man and take away his chance of proving his strength and wit as a warrior is one of the most cowardly and degrading choices for mankind on the whole.

Tom Cruise just shines in this movie; one of his finest ever. At the very end, when Ken Watanabe wants to know...if they won? Cruise delivers one of the best movie lines of all time.

Still a classic; always a classic. This one will always have an important message for everyone. I just hope the right people take it to heart. ""The Last Samurai"" is a Dove's Cry for Peace if there ever was one ~",1517529600,,1063,4.336683417085427

2006137,3,B0001JXOVC,"Quick Story Recap:  A former captain in the US Army, Nathan Algrean (Played by Cruise), is haunted by his help in the slaughter of native americans.  He is approached to be paid very handsomely to do the same deed to the Samurai who are leading a rebellion in Japan.  Being broke, he accepts.  Without revealing to much more to spoil it, he finds his destiny in battle.

I think the acting was pretty decent all around.  Cruise does well. I loved Billy Connolly however small his part he had. I thought Ken Watanabe was good too.

Overall, I enjoyed the movie.  Great action scenes especially the battles.  Not a perfect film, I wish I could change some things about the movie.  The Voice Over at the end would be one as parts of it were cheesy.  The other is the appearance of  that same character (who did the Voice Over)  on the front line of battle just before they will charge, I think they should either cut him out there or had Cruise hand off that item to him in another short scene elsewhere. (Possible Spoilers ahead I guess)  I'd change how much the samurai value Cruise's characters input in a battle.  These were seasoned fighters who defeated his army before and it seems kinda dumb that it was Cruise's decision to send in all troops to a suicide ride to the enemy front lines.  The reason I think it's dumb was the Leader, Ken Wasabe's character, had already talked about wanting to die either by his own hand or in battle many times in scenes prior to this.  He would/should have been the one to want to charge at a machine gun with a horse and a sword.  For some reason, it also bothers me that the whole samurai army is waiting for Cruise to come out of the hut before the ride to the battle.  Why would they all be waiting on just him. Did he not get the memo to be out ready for the ride at 0900 hours?  It felt like they made him to be a higher status than leader and that is just ridiculous.

Some light moments from Cruise really helped out a film that sometimes starts veering into the over dramatic.  But it's a film I'd say is a solid 3 out of 5, but the more you think about the film, the more you question it like, *why was the emperor such an indecisive weakling,*  so please don't bring your brain to watch the movie.",1472169600,,2248,4.26241134751773

2006178,5,B0001JXOVC,"This movie tends to get some hate, probably because of how polarizing Tom Cruise has become. Let it go, forget about Cruise's personal life and take in this beautiful film. Also, take some advice offered in the movie: ""too many mind""; if you're looking for plot holes, you're likely to find them. LET IT GO. This is a classical example of historical fiction.
One can't help but admire the Samurai culture, as Cruise's character mentions, its has an undeniable appeal. I don't like Tom Cruise as a person, but I enjoy his movies in general. I would argue this is his best role outside of Born on the Fourth of July. Watanabe is sublime, I can't get enough of this guy. He's also great in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and Inception, but this is my favorite work from him. Very underrated film.",1467936000,12,792,4.584507042253521
2006179,5,B0001JXOVC,"Occidentals have been fascinated with Oriental culture for centuries. The concept that a noble warrior from a European civilization could be accepted and integrated into the highly structured and exclusive culture of an Oriental warrior caste is a fiction, but one with great appeal to those of us enamored with martial codes of honor and duty. The concept of the noble savage applies here to the uncouth and unwashed European, played by Tom Cruise. With high ranking patronage and much instruction, the European barbarian ascends to join the ranks of the Samurai, including their philosophy of life and death, and culminates in a struggle for cultural and physical survival. It has a strong resemblance to the mini-series Shogun featuring Richard Chamberlain.",1467676800,7,760,5.289256198347108
2006180,5,B0001JXOVC,"While, I bought it mostly for the Hans Zimmer music, the story is very interesting. The scenery is beautiful. The acting and SFX are fantastic. Being an old-fashioned type, I found it very refreshing to see a movie where a couple become passionate about each other, and we don't have to slog through R-rated scenes. This would be so magnificent on the big screen. Alas, I am limited to my computer screen.

Interestingly, the music doesn't stand out in the movie the way I thought it would. Comparatively speaking, music in Interstellar grabs me in just about every scene. I find the music in The Last Samurai to be more subtle. I still listen to it almost daily on YouTube.",1467676800,,674,4.616666666666666

2006208,4,B0001JXOVC,"Japanese Emperor Meiji wants to westernize his country. The Samurai are traditionalists who resist change. Japan has become a civilized country. Lawyers from France, engineers from Germany, architects from Holland, and warriors from America are employed to facilitate progress. These efforts are thwarted by Samurai Matsumoto, who leads the rebellion. Matsumoto does not use firearms but honors the old ways, the Samurai's sword is his soul, an extension of himself. The Samurai are viewed as rebels and savages with bows and arrows that do not have a chance against an army with rifles. Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is a true American hero and one of the most decorated soldiers, winner of the Medal of Honor for his gallantry on the grounds of Gettysburg. Mr. Omura from Japan arrives in San Francisco in 1876. He recruits Captain Algren to teach Orientals to soldier, an army of conscripts, most were peasants who had never seen a gun. Emperor Meiji grants the U.S. exclusive rights to supply arms (specifically the Winchester Company). Their lever-action rifle has a seven-shot capacity and is accurate within 400 yards and fires off one round a second. Captain Algren will take his much larger, inexperienced army to battle the Samurai. The Samurai's way of life, their sole purpose, is to devote themselves utterly to a set of principles. They are disciplined as children to train to use their sword with perfection, practicing an art form such as martial arts. And they master their craft with proficiency as they have for hundreds of years.",1465776000,4,1554,5.07421875

2006253,5,B0001JXOVC,"My favorite historical epic. A beautiful, fantastically-paced film that portrays Japanese culture with respect and even reverence. It's easy to see that Tom Cruise gave his all to this role and it paid off. Ken Watanabe's portrayal of the tragic figure Katsumoto is as nuanced and heartfelt as any character I've ever seen. This movie never fails to make me emotional by the end as it shows a complex, crystalline culture disappearing into the annals of history. A near-perfect film in my opinion. Couldn't recommend it highly enough.",1461888000,4,534,5.079545454545454

2006267,5,B0001JXOVC,"""The Last Samurai"" is Tom Cruise's shining hour. It is his finest performance. This is the kind of role that he is best at because it reflects his own nature: tortured, disciplined , compromised. For him to be among the graceful and masterful actors in this film is to watch the healing process of a wounded giant. Edward Zwick's direction is superb and the cinematography simple and exquisite. Made before the advent of special effects, I thrill to magnificent vistas and major battles. They certainly don't make them like this anymore. And, sad to say, neither does Mr. Cruise.

2006285,5,B0001JXOVC,"The story is told by reporter/photographer 'Simon Graham' (Timothy Spail) from 'Nathan Algren's' diary -
Sickened by the deeds he was a part of 'Nathan Algren' (Tom Cruise) works at a fairground promoting the sale
of the Winchester Rifle.
He drinks far too much, frequently seeing images of the Indians he'd attacked with the 7th Calvary slaughtered
without mercy.
After a performance 'Zebulon Gant' (Billy Connolly) meets him outside the grounds with an invitation to listen
to a proposition made by a former commander 'Colonel Bagley' (Tony Goldwyn) and a Japanese official.
'Nathan' is asked with an offer of a substantial reward to train up the Japanese Emperor's newly formed army.
For Centuries the Samurai have protected the Emperor but times are changing in Japan, though the Samurai
believe change to be coming too quickly, they are a proud people and will resist, in effect becoming the enemy.
Training the green-horn army will not be an easy task, most had never seen never mind handled a gun before.
Well before the army are ready to fight they are ordered to seek out the Samurai warriors who had sabotaged
the building of the new rail-road.
'Colonel Bagley' despite being told by 'Nathan' how unprepared they are orders them to face the fearsome
warriors.
'Zebulon' though told by 'Nathan' to withdraw insists on standing his ground, those that did not run from the
charging Samurai including 'Zebulon' die, only 'Nathan' who fought with great honour survives.
He is taken to the Samurai village where injured he is brought back to heath by leader 'Katsumoto's' (Ken Watanabe)
sister 'Taka' (Koyuki) who's husband 'Nathan' had killed during the battle.
'Katsumoto' wants to know more about 'Nathan's' history as a soldier in America and learn of the new Japanese army
he will one day face.e
They have many conversations if but at first short....
Gradually 'Nathan' learns to admire and respect his captors and indeed becomes eager to learn their skills, eventually
he will also earn their respect.
There also becomes an evident attaction between 'Nathan' and 'Taka'
He will become one with the Samurai and will one day fight a glorious battle by their side.
Surely one of 'Tom Cruise's' finest performances in what i myself consider to be a 'Classic'
A superb film that includes a very well staged battle sequence......well worth a revisit or indeed a first viewing.

2006372,3,B0001JXOVC,"I loved this movie and would give it 5 stars for content.  The reason I have not upgraded my DVD is because this Blu-ray is one of a small percentage of big studio releases that did not bother including an HD audio track.  Higher fidelity audio was one of the selling points for Blu-ray in addition to the improved picture.  At the moment, a Dolby TrueHD Hong Kong version is available if you don't mind paying $25.99 plus shipping from Asia.  It is sad that in the country that produced the content, we are offered the inferior product.  Just a warning that if you buy it, they will probably announce the US HD audio release shortly after.

The forgotten legacy of the Samurai jars with my western sensibilities, it seems at odds with nature that humans managed to forge a society that placed honour and respect above that of our natural survival instincts.

This film, probably my favourite Cruise film (closely followed by Edge of Tomorrow) is a story that may have been told a few times. The film, placed at a key point in time, when a modern country emerges from the shadow of its feudal past must find the balance between the old and the new was really quite moving.",1440720000,,657,4.567796610169491

Set after the US Civil War, Tom Cruise is a retired Army Captain who along with his Irish-American Sergeant buddy, travel to Japan to modernize their military.  But Cruise is captured in a fierce battle and brought into the Samurai culture and life by warrior Ken Watanabe.

 Great movie that depicts the martial arts, and has one of the most accurate portrayals of Ninja tactics and warfare ever made on film.  Based on a true story, but in the real story the Soldier was French and not American.  Either way Japan had gone from a feudal medieval system to a system that had been more modern, modeling their Army after the US & Europe, while modeling their Navy after the British fleet in order to become a world power.

2006631,4,B0001JXOVC,"Why am I writing this? This movie is twelve years old at the time I'm writing this. When I first saw it I liked it quite a bit some something seemed wrong. Something about it irked me. Upon viewing it again it occurred to me what felt wrong. Can a movie be too perfect?

Here's the scoop. Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) was a post Civil War officer haunted by his involvement in the senseless slaughter of native Americans. Now he's on a road tour hawking Winchester rifles for the company. He drinks too much and has terrible nightmares. The Japanese are working to close a trade deal with the U.S. as they become more westernized. The more traditional Japanese are opposing this and will fight for their beliefs. Algren is hired by the government to train Japanese troops to put down the uprising. As Algren gets captured by the opposition, he gets to realize a different destiny.

This is an epic film in all ways. Great, sprawling landscapes. A huge climactic battle involving serious numbers of extras and a big story. But, as I mentioned, it might be too perfect. It were as though they honed the script with a fine tooth comb, laid out every shot and edit and went made it without a second thought. Given the subject matter I would figure it would have more fire but it didn't. Even the beautifully choreographed fight and battle sequences needed a bit more umph. The script looks as though it could have written itself. Once you have the outline it's a matter of filling in the blanks. Don't get me wrong. I liked it....a lot. But again, I needed some surprises. Some something that just wasn't there.

All the key actors, Cruise, Ken Watanabe, Billy Connolly, Tim Spall et al do a stand-up job. For my dollar there is no weak link in this entire film. It just needed a bit more crazy.",1431648000,,1797,4.523076923076923

2006680,3,B0001JXOVC,"Decent costume drama. It tries very hard to be a giant epic adventure of the old school, and though the story is too weak and implausible to quite get it there, there's enough old-school heroism and manliness on display to carry it some of the way. The visual splendor, not just in the big battle scenes but in quieter moments, helps a lot. A better actor than Li'l Tommy Cruise might have helped, too. When he's trying to look deep in thought he just looks zoned out, and when he's supposed to be deeply moved he just looks like he's in physical pain. Watanabe's regal presence adds a lot of the dramatic weight Cruise can't.",1428624000,,626,4.452173913043478

There is so much more to this film, with a powerful message about a turning point in Japanese History told from a Western Perspective.  It shows just how much change happened.  It was engaging from start to finish and really had a beauty to it.

In this day and age of exponential growth and the great road to nowhere, it is refreshing to contemplate another way of life, one that has existed for millennia.  Perhaps this movie is an invitation to learn more about the wisdom of the ages.  It is no coincidence that The 300 Spartans, as well as the Native Americans who numbered in the 20 million before Columbus, are mentioned.

2006743,5,B0001JXOVC,"This one has some parallels that remind me of ""Dances With Wolves."" This movie stands on its own, though, as a brilliant work. It captures the spirit of the samurai warrior class nicely. I especially appreciated the director using a mostly all Japanese cast.

The movie opens with Capt. Algren a down-on-his-luck alcoholic, having seen the injustices by the US Army against the Indians, often killing women, children and old people. His involvement in the campaigns eats at his soul. He is approached by a Japanese agent and asked to train their rag tag army in modern warfare methods. Keep in mind that this is a country who has had a history of military and wars for thousands of years. However, the emperor, and especially one of his ministers, want to modernize Japan. Algren agrees, but is also going to Japan with one of his former superior officers whom he desperately hates; having been one of those that gave orders to kill women and children. The two of them start to train the soldiers. What they are training for is to wipe out the remaining samurai, who hereditarily were a soldier caste which owed their service to their liege lord, and the ultimately the emperor.

The samurai leader, Katsumoto, has a vision of them surrounding a tiger and him fighting them off. Algren tells them he is six months away from having the troops ready, and he is commanded to attack the samurai, who are trying to destroy a railroad being constructed. The Samurai win the battle, and Algren, though wounded, is surrounded by samurai as he fights back with whatever he can grab. As soon as one man approaches to remove his head, Algren kills him with the broken piece of a flag staff. Katsumoto realizes that this is the tiger of his vision and commands his men to stand-down.

Algren has to heal of his wounds and ""dry out"" from his alcoholism. Katsumoto keeps him around to question and to study him. Eventually they become friends, Algren learns the way of the samurai, and he joins them. Algren becomes romantically involved with the widow of the man he killed.

The end comes with a showdown between the army and the samurai, now lead by both Katsumoto and Algren. Awesome movie!",1424736000,,2179,4.696335078534031

2006765,3,B0001JXOVC,"This movies interest lies essentially in its depiction of late 19th century Japan. Obvious efforts were placed in recreating the era, notably in terms of costumes and settings.  Although some computer images appear somewhat basic today, the rendering of a poor, quasi medieval Tokyo and of a superb countryside are noteworthy, yet it is difficult of course for a foreigner to judge their accuracy.

The movies plot is well structured but artificially romanticised and the battle scenes well rendered but excessively lengthy.  Clichs are not pervasive but appear at times as evident as in  The King and I .  As usual, Tom Cruise is not very expressive though, to his credit, he does render more than a few lines in Japanese.

Overall, this movie succeeds in providing a decent level of both entertainment and insight and as such may be recommended.",1424563200,,847,4.971631205673759

Katsumoto (Ken Wanatabe  )  teaches Algren (Tom Cruise) the true meaning of honor, which allows Algren to finally find redemption in this 2 hour and 35 minute film during which not a minute is lost or wasted.  Spectacular scenery and an excellent cast of supporting actors remind the viewers that there is much to admire in the Japanese culture and people.  It is certainly easy to fall in love with Taka (Koyuki Kato '  ''), Katsumoto's beautiful sister and to admire Ujio (Hiroyuki Sanada  ) for his bravery and strength.  For anyone who harbors regrets in his or her life (and we all do), this film will make you want to join the Samurai and ride off into that unwinnable battle to try to exorcise your demons, if for no other reason than to be a part of something greater than yourself.

I wish it were a little more honest to reality about the corruption and ulterior motives of most of the samurai's resistance to change, and I wish they'd given women's lives a little more airtime. (There's one woman in the whole movie and she's a cardboard cutout, though the actress did a pretty good job with what she had. Also, she looked extra caucasian to me. I thought maybe it was on purpose- was she supposed to part Ainu or something? But no- turns out not.)

Oh well. As as story it's pretty entertaining, and some of the cinematography was pretty stunning.

2006952,5,B0001JXOVC,"For me, the heartbreaking aspect of this film is that it depicted in graphic detail the end of honor in warfare.  Gatling guns and cannons do not make an honorable engagement.  It is just slaughter.  In contrast the Samurai culture has its own ancient code of honor which is inclusive and holistic.  A description of this code is included in the special features.

 ***spoilers***  The final scenes were what did it for me in reaching this conclusion. And look where warfare is going today?  Drones?  Robots?  Not to mention nuclear warfare.  War will always be with us (see James Hillman's A TERRIBLE LOVE OF WAR which talks about the archetype of war being an intrinsic part of the human condition) but it currently badly needs the insertion of an honorable way of engagement.

  An additional mention should be made about the very fine acting skills of Ken Watanabe and Hiroyuki Sanada.  Impressive!  Tom Cruise did the best he could but was completely outshone by the Japanese actors including the two adorable little kids.  Amazing!",1414454400,,1037,4.867816091954023

2007052,5,B0001JXOVC,"The Last Samurai is a movie which shows Ancient Japan coming head to head, toe to toe with Modern Japan. Tom Cruise plays Nathan Algren, a burned out officer of the Northern Army of the Civil War. He, along with Col Bagley (Tony Goldwyn) are recruited to modernize Japan's Army.

Algren is charged with training local peasants to be soldiers against the samurai ""army"". During a skirmish, the peasant army, woefully inadequate, are beating soundly. Algren is taken captive to be studied by Katsumoto (veteran actor Ken Wanatabe). An unlikely alliance and eventually a friendship is formed between the two as Algren decides to use his talents to help the samurai keep their ways.

This is a stunning movie. Not being a Tom Cruise fan, I was enthralled enough to forget it was ""him"" on the screen but Algren. I have watched this movie several times and will continue to do so. It was well written, directed and acted.",1410393600,,915,4.748427672955975

Great action, stunning fight scenes, but really the cream in this pic is found in the characters and how well they are portrayed. Tom Cruise carried his bitter soldier's transformation with heart wrenching nuance but also with the ferocity and glee of warfare that you would expect of a man who has been in battle most of his adult life. Ken Watanabe brought the Samurai to life with a power and grace I did not know the Samurai possessed. Having read Shogun, I thought the Samurai were a harsher, more politically/power motivated group but in this story their true beliefs and ideals were clearly drawn. I hope that Tom Cruise and the rest are proud of this film. It's a great work. I will watch it again soon!",1409702400,2,874,4.573248407643312
2007055,5,B0001JXOVC,I cannot say enough good things about this movie.  Tom Cruise gives a bravura performance as a broken down war veteran who finds redemption with a group of Samurai.  Ken Watanabe is outstanding as is the rest of the cast.  There is a real sense of loss expressed as industrialism comes to Japan and the Samurai find they have no place in that new world.,1409616000,,353,4.4

2007122,5,B0001JXOVC,"Tom Cruise delivers a superb performance as Captain Nathan Algren, a Civil War hero who is called upon to go to Japan and train Japanese men, how to be combat soldiers. But, Nathan has his own unseen demons to battle, namely shame and guilt for spilling innocent Native American blood during the Civil War. Miserable and embittered he washes down his feelings with liquor and not until he reaches Japan and is caught by the 'seeming' enemy, a Samurai warrior and is forced to stay within the confines of the Samurai camp, does he finally surrender his inner struggles and simultaneously is freed from his addiction to alcohol. Having regained his lost sobriety he now sees clear enough to know, that friendships can be formed with those he was told to hate. So, will the biased shogun steal the empire of Japan right out from under the Emperor? Or will the Samurai even the very last one, prevail in showing the Emperor that the Samurai are on his side and that Japan belongs to him and the Japanese people. And not, too the shogun and the western world. Ladies, you will cry and guys, it's okay if you do, too! The action shots and panoramic cinematography are first rate. This is an excellent movie about the emerging nation of Japan and the Samurai warrior culture, within. Nina Kish",1407283200,,1286,4.644736842105263
2007123,5,B0001JXOVC,"I have watched this movie several times, and in short, I think it is a keeper.  No, it is not an accurate portrayal of the Meiji Period or Japan's efforts to westernize, as several reviewers have pointed out. (Note: this is not the Edo period as some reviewers have mistakenly pointed out, which ended in 1868; this story takes place in 1876-77, the Meiji period.) As a student of Japanese history for most of my adult life, authenticity is something I've come to value in films depicting Japan.  This lack, however, does not diminish the production's value.  This is a story about values, honor, integrity and redemption told with a engrossing story line--living (and dying) for something greater than yourself. Great actors and acting (Watanabe Ken again delivers a stellar performance along with Tom Cruise; and Sanada Hiroyuki plays an unforgettable role).  For these reasons I think this is a ""must see.""",1407196800,,909,4.9605263157894735

2007285,5,B0001JXOVC,"Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe were excellent choices for the characters they played. While watching the film I was sometimes standing and cheering and at other times I was moved to tears with emotion. The film conveyed the hard work needed to become skilled with the Samurai Sword. Very intense. That's why they used wooden training swords.

The film also conveyed how important family values were to the Samurai as well. The scenes in the villages showed peaceful, loving and respectful families working hard and raising children. I found the final scene in the film very moving.

One message the film conveyed very well is some of the cultural history and values that can be found in ancient Asian cultures. The Samurai believed their Emperor to be a living God. They believed in serving their Emperor with dignity, respect, devotion and honor. The sword that was made and presented to Tom Cruise in the film was inscribed with several Japanese words: ""Now""- or present time, ""Ancient""-the past, ""God"", ""Dignity"" and ""Service""- to serve. There are many ways that the words could be translated, one that I've seen is: ""Since ancient times to the present, God is with those who serve with dignity and honor"". Having studied some of the other asian martial arts I can say that they also include some of these values.

Many of those asian cultures like the Samurai and the asian religions go back many thousands of years. Watching ""The Last Samurai"" gave me a new appreciation of that history.

We westerners...and Christians...like myself... sometimes forget that history. Christian history goes back two thousand years or so. But don't forget....the three wise men that traveled to Bethlehem two thousand years ago....came from the East!",1402185600,,1735,5.013888888888889

2007291,3,B0001JXOVC,"Good news: the Japanese actors and actresses are very good at acting. I appreciated their performances.

Pretty much everything else is bad, in different ways. The script plain sucks. Tom Cruise is himself, occasionally fanatical in an eerily ambiguous way. He's not a bad actor, there's just moments in this film that made me cringe, like at the end when his piety is so strained that we know its contrived, but I think this is also partly because of the pathetic script, so maybe its not him.

Another thing is that the musical score is woefully overblown and melodramatic, and appears too often. I long for the time when music ceases to exist in movies or at least is never again used to flatter the audience's emotions.

I called the movie ironic because the categorically liberal elements responsible for the film's creation end up supporting the existence of peoples that are themselves wholly anti-liberal, under the guise of that most hackneyed platitude, a favorite amongst liberals, 'multi-culturalism'. Here we see once again an example of the eternal contradiction of liberalism; the impossibility of neutrality, to speak in Carl Schmitt's language, or at least neutralization will exist insofar as it can be manipulated by Others and not in its own right.

There's a strong racial element to the film, apparent to the audience only unconsciously, the unconsciousness itself being constantly informed by the uniformly liberal media/entertainment/governmental complex. Tom Cruise is asked by his Indian-bashing, Anglo nemesis, ""why do you hate your people so much""? The answer is that its a set-up; Cruise opposes, at least explicitly, materialist/Capitalist commercialization, as evinced by the opening scene with his Winchester model 1873. Cruise doesn't explicitly condemn the white race, though he is overtly sympathetic to Indians. When asked about General Custer, he says he was a man that fell in love with his own legend. Fair enough, and he responds to a question about scalping with a honest account of the method's brutality, which would seemingly be a mark against the noble-savage idealization of 'Native-Americans', as its something never mentioned by academic liberals or if it is we learn of it in conjunction with equally brutal examples of white domination, so as to maintain the fraud of academic impartiality

Throughout the film Cruise has some flashbacks depicting a surprise massacre of unarmed Indians by American soldiers, lead by the bad Anglo man. This drives him. Its only one scene and, besides its relevance to Cruise's character, I think the over-arching meaning is to enforce in the audience's mind the dominant narrative of Manifest Destiny as reconstructed by liberal academia, specifically that Indians were little nice people living in a magical world of nature and then puritanical, fanatical, sexually repressed and racist white man came over with his 'technology' and deliberately, gleefully committed genocide against the REAL Native-Americans because they weren't white, raised the Cross, continued the enslavement of women and the consolidation of Capital. Liberal academic then forces us to say that since Indians are the real Native-Americans, itself an ironic example of racism, whites are immigrants and so whites can't oppose unmitigated third-world immigration without being hypocrites and so un-American.

In the end, a little Japanese boy close to Cruise asks, ""Are the white men coming for us"". When they come its not white men but bunches of 'civilized' Japanese soldiers of modern technology led by bad Anglo man, so just one white man. I think this question is asked essentially and is where the director decides to explicitly blame whitey, masking the message in the innocence of a cute, persecuted Japanese samurai kid, the thing we've been taught to love.

Its worth noticing that bad Anglo man doesn't specifically 'hate' because of racial composition. Rather he makes his distinctions based on civility versus savagery. Civility is modern technology, uniforms, running water, guns, toothpaste, laundry detergent, etc. Savagery is basically the Old World, what we've so idiotically been calling 'culture' for over a century now. So why does he ask the question about Cruise's ""people""? In this place and context people for him still meant whites, though this is after the Civil War, the madness that ensued after Lincoln's assassination and when so-called 'anti-racism' was really coming into its own in America. Is bad Anglo man merely an unconscious racist white man, a Republican party voter, one who promises liberation for all but the moral authority of which is informed by specifically white scruples? Does he mean the GOP notion of 'American' people? If that were true, Anglo man merely used the wrong word. Why not then say Civilization or Progress instead of people?

Remember the Japanese samurai boy's question; he didn't mean it literally but essentially. Those modernized Japanese soldiers are just racial Japanese subjected to white drab. This very fact of the question, that its essence depends on recognizing Japanese-ness as being based on race alone, is itself an ironic example of racism, ironic because its used for the purposes of liberal emotional code.

Cruse does not respond to these questions in their own language. His ultimate answer comes at the end, when he bows before the Japanese Emperor and offers to commit suicide if it so pleases the Emperor, in the same manner as the Samurai Lord did. Cruise can't tell Anglo man that he hates whites because they're more brutal and eviler than others, as the Samurai Lord Katsumoto himself warmly approves of Custer, beheadings, women in the kitchen and the spoils of war. This is where the multiculturalist fraud is most apparent, but what is Cruise's answer, what does his gesture to the Emperor mean? He submits without question or reason, just because they're right and we're wrong. That's how low white reconstruction engineering has sunk.",1401408000,,5987,5.241127348643007

'The Last Samurai' just so happens to be one of those films! Cruise is excellent here and handles the lead role both physically and emotionally. Not since standing toe to toe with Dustin Hoffman in 'Rain Man' have I believed in one of his performances so whole heartedly.

The film will certainly remind viewers of Costner's 'Dances with Wolvies' as it deals with a similar premise of a Civil War soldier's study of a foreign culture and total turn around of his preconceived opinion of it. I do think that 'Dances with Wolves' edges this one out, but it is a wonderful film all the same.

The film is also beautiful to look with gorgeous scenery and breathtaking battles. The battle scenes are brutal, but never did I feel the graphic violence was gratuitous. There are a few tiny instances where I smelled Hollywood, but they are so tiny, I can't take away from this impressive film about honor and loyalty. It's just a beautiful film!

He is to proud to give it up. The samurai proceeds to beat the hell out of him. You have to see it to appreciate all the emotions.,1391904000,,473,3.6930693069306932

Sure,there is glamorization of the ""old ways"", but you have to suspend your disbelief for points like that .  The acting is unbelievable, especially by the Japanese cast. Ken Watanabe should have one an Oscar for this performance. The clash of cultures is done well, and for a change, the Western observer of the culture is a dispirited alcoholic who has lost his way in life.
The themes have great application to daily life. Instead of succumbing to the materialism that has become everyone's religion, people should seek deeper spirituality in life.
The modern world really makes you wonder if we will ever return to a time where a man's fundamental character is used to judge him - it looks like today the size of the bank account associated with the man is all that matters.

2007463,5,B0001JXOVC,"You know, I don't know why, but I love this movie. There are so many things in this movie that suck me in, that I just love watching this over and over again.

The depiction of Japan during the start of their industrialization.
The bad ass Samurai that charge into battle knowing the outcome.
The beautiful sound track that sucks you into the world and makes you want to visit this idyllic Japan.
The meeting of enemies who come to understand one another.
and the absolutely epic final battle that makes me cry every, freaking, time.

Some might complain that the movie is slow and that a lot doesn't happen. Yeah, I can see why they would say that. But honestly, there's a reason for it. Unlike most movies, this film gives you the opportunity to actually grow and care for the characters. It let's you be a foreigner in a strange land and shows you their culture, their way of life, their values.

It shows you that your enemies don't always necessarily have to be your enemies. Or that tradition is still very important in our culture, even though we so desperately want to modernize.

It's a powerful movie, and notice that I didn't mention Tom Cruise until now? That's because, although he was fine in the movie. I don't watch it to see him in action. Although he is important in numerous scenes, I don't particularly take much notice of him. He's just there to serve as MY avatar, so that I am interacting with these fascinating people. He's there, so that I can see what happens to the Japanese and their way of life.

Sorry, but Nathan Algren will never be as cool as Ujio, who reminded me of Mitsurugi from Soul Caliber.

If you have the time, definitely give this movie a watch. The final battle alone and it's amazing soundtrack is well worth the price of admission.",1387152000,6,1777,4.503105590062112

Still reeling from the horrors of the slaughtering of Native Americans, Algren visits a village in Tokyo when he is confronted by a noble samurai named Katsumoto(Watanabe). Demanding an answer, Algren realizes that he was waging an unjust war and chose to side alongside Katsumoto and his samurai clan against the allied U.S./Chinese soldiers.

2007517,3,B0001JXOVC,"Tom Cruise plays the part of alcoholic ex-Indian fighter, shattered by memories of atrocities he reluctantly participated in while fighting an indingeous people, and a vanished way of life, he had come to admire.

Eventually hired to train Japanese peasants to wager modern warfare against Samurai, he finds himself caught in the same dilemma - he comes to admire the Samurai who cling to thousand-year-old warrior traditions. Whether intended or not by it's producers, this film supplies a resounding defense of time-honored traditions (conservatism), and critiques progressive reforms not founded in morality or tested by experience. The Japanese military men who hire Cruise to wage modern warfare against the Samurai, are driven by ideology - the belief that Japan must embrace Western modernism to survive in the modern world. This ideological drive typifies liberals everywhere, who dream up solutions to America's problem in faculty lounges, utterly detached from the real world. Conservatives, on the other hand, are not opposed to progress, but reject overturning tried-and-true methods until better ones have proven themselves.

2007535,5,B0001JXOVC,"Let me start off by saying, if you hate inaccurate movies that depict a time period, run far away from this movie.  It is not (nor is it meant to be) historically accurate.  It is a dramatization about the conflict between the imperial army and the samurai in Japan.  The fact that the war actually happened was real, but the rest of it is made up and fictionalized.  If you can accept that about the movie, then you will likely enjoy it.  If you cannot, then you won't.

The thing that makes this movie work so well is the acting.  It is, in my opinion the best I have ever seen Tom Cruise in (admittedly I have not seen all of his movies, so I cannot say whether it is his best performance ever).  His interactions with the Samurai leader played by Ken Watanabe, were wonderful.  This is really a film where all the actors from the ""main"" characters to the supporting actors all did their job wonderfully.  Yes, the love story was contrived and (SPOILER ALERT) having Tom Cruise's character live through the final battle was unrealistic, but overall I don't think those things detracted from the film as a whole.

The A/V quality on blu ray is very very good.  What I loved about the movie is that very little was done via green screen, and the little that was, was blended in seamlessly so it did not look fake.  Most of the landscape shots were real, and were really brought out on blu ray.  For those who like the physical discs there are a ton of extras.

Everyone knows the movie and in most ways i love it, it does have its fundamental flaws like the feel good hollywood ending but overall it is an entertaining flick, well if you can stand Cruise it is but if you don't like him don't watch his flicks.

What i am going too talk about is the quality of the steelbook version and the audio and video presentation.  The Steelbook overall is pretty ho hum.  It has a pretty good looking cover but the back of it is lame and there is not artwork on the inside of the item so overall its nice but not necessary.  The Video is of course 1080p and is presented in a 2.4:1 aspect ratio and overall is stunning in both bright and dark scenes, no matter how you feel about the film you have too admit it is pretty stunning.  My biggest gripe is that even though this is a blu ray it is coming with a lossy dolby digital track, no not DD+ or Dolby True HD but a standard DD audio track.  Now it does sound decent but it is definitely missing some definition so be aware of that before purchasing this film on blu ray because as of May 2013 it still does not have a Lossless soundtrack.",1369094400,,1300,4.7555555555555555

2007612,4,B0001JXOVC,"Looking at the bigger picture historically speaking, one would think the Meiji reformers would be the heroes of this movie instead of the samurai. The older samurai system was extremely tyrannical and brutal, and was holding Japan back from technological progress they needed to make to avoid total takeover by Western powers. We ought to bear that in mind as we admire the honor, purity, beauty, and nobility of the samurai way of life in this fictional story.

Yet, there are two sides to every coin. As with our American Civil War, it is fair to say the good guys won, yet it is wrong to view the losers as perfect devils in every way. There were some good qualities to them; some valid points to their arguments. In that spirit I could easily overlook the dubious historical aspects of this film, and take its vision of the samurai as a concentrated, idealized depiction of their better side.

I could poke various other holes in this movie, beginning with them carrying rifles that were still a few years off in the future when the samurai era ended. Also I hope Japanese audiences will bear with us Americans for Hollywoodically inserting ourselves so prominently into their historical moments... almost like Forrest Gump, haha. But as one who had previously lived in Japan for three years and worked alongside ordinary Japanese factory workers for a couple years, I sure enjoyed this movie a lot when I first saw it in 2009. I think it is a great story and very well acted. Don't think it is history, but it does a fair job of illustrating to us outside barbarians some attitudes that really do linger on, for good or bad, in the modern Japanese psyche.",1368835200,,1660,4.662116040955631

It is a timeless story of a lost culture in which dignity, respect and perseverance are honored.  As the severely wounded Captain Nathan Algren is recovering in captivity, he begins to note the serenity and kindness of his captors.  Gaining strength, he walks freely through the village and discovers that each person, every day, is striving to do each task well and to overcome obstacles along the way.  He trains in martial arts with the children, then with the men -- first as recreation, then with a growing respect for their dedication and ability.  When the final threat to their way of life comes from the Japanese elite troops, Algren trains the Samurai and stands with them in their last struggle: ancient weapons against modern firearms including a Gatling gun.  The honor and courage shown by the overmatched Samurai leaves their enemy no ""victory"" at all -- only awestruck respect.",1368230400,,1020,4.734463276836158

2007657,5,B0001JXOVC,"""The Last Samurai"" is loosely based on an actual rebellion in nineteenth century Japan.  In the film, the Japanese government hire a number of U.S. cavalry veterans as advisors for their new army including the highly decorated captain played by Tom Cruise.  The captain however is an alcoholic struggling with a massacre he participated in at an Indian village.  Soon after arriving in Japan the unprepared Japanese regiment is overwhelmed by a highly disciplined force of Samurai fighting to preserve their old customs.  Wounded and captured, Cruise comes face to face with a vastly different culture.  Ironically both he and the Samurai leader played by Japanese actor Ken Watanabe come to respect and learn much from one another; eventually they fight together as allies against a considerably better trained and equipped government force.

Overall I greatly enjoyed the film.  The acting is very good (especially from the Japanese actors but Cruise plays his role quite well).  As usual Hans Zimmer delivers a very good muscial score.  I confess that James Horner is probably my faovrite film composer but Zimmerman does exceptional work as well.  The cinematography and production values are superb (particularly regarding 1870s Tokyo and the main Samurai village).  The Battle scenes are very well coreographed.  There is a memorable scene in which the protagonists face a force of ninja assassins.  The final battle is tragically powerful as the rebels in full armor with katanas and bows face two Japanese regiments armed with howitzers, bolt-action rifles, and gatling guns.

The film is for mature audiences as it clearly deserves its R rating during the violent combat scenes.  Parents should be aware there is some cursing as well (not considerably so for an R rated film though).  The depiction of Samurai culture is very interesting; although generally sympathetic towards their culture the film also shows that it was not without fault.  I would recommend the WWII film ""To End all Wars"" for a far more critical view of Bushido.  For those interested in further reading on Samurai military history, the British military historian Stephen Turnbull has written numerous books.",1362700800,2,2189,5.223495702005731
2007658,5,B0001JXOVC,"I enjoy this film.  I periodically have students view it and research where it is historically flawed.  Being that the film is very creative with it's adjustments to major historical events and figures, it leaves plenty of room for analysis.

If you are watching just for fun, which is probably more than 99.9 percent of viewers, then this is a perfectly good action movie, and to Tom Cruises great credit, his Japanese pronunciation is about as perfect as it should be for the character he plays. He clearly worked hard to learn the skills and words to play the part.

On a less serious not, Cruise recovers so well from repeated serious injury, that this could easily be the Wolverine sequel that we have long wanted to see! (Just add side burns.)",1362268800,,749,4.651515151515151

2007663,5,B0001JXOVC,"I really enjoy this film. Before The Last Samurai, I thought making Tom Cruise a samurai was a terrible, terrible idea, but he actually plays the role of an American-gone-Japanese quite well. Some might find a few of the scenes push the boundaries between powerful and trite, or be offended by the plot of a white American defending the honor and custom of Japan, but these aspects don't bother me. Very solid action, some well choreographed fighting, and it's nice to see Tom Cruise actually performing said choreography.

As far as the Blu-Ray is concerned, the image and audio quality are superb. The very first shot of the film is grainy and looks kind of low-res, which had me worried, but rest of the 2.5 hours are uniformly excellent quality.",1361232000,,749,4.7615384615384615

Ken and Tom keep the audience within the realm of the film with their natural performances. The blu ray conversion sometimes can be faulty because it has a few grainy scenes but overall the spectacle is really a dramatic difference compared to a regular DVD. This is probably one of Tom Cruise's best movies along with Collateral. It's a long movie but the first hour goes flying by as we are intrigued to learn more about Cruise's character development and what strives him to being a valiant warrior. When he is captured by the Japan Samurai rebel forces, the natural scenery and the clash of cultures is perfect. The fighting scenes and the use of nature to drive the story is very effectively done. This director knows what he is doing as he has directed other movies like Blood Diamond, which was also a great story with stunning resolution to the African vegetation and culture. I give it four stars because I feel it's not a perfect Blu Ray, there are few and not very noticeable scenes that are grainy but overall it's a 4 star quality movie.

2007690,5,B0001JXOVC,"A magnificent film. A dispirited decorated American civil war captain who has lost his moral roots in campaigns against Native Americans turns mercenary and accepts a military training post in Japan, a country on the verge of loosing its roots in trying to modernize to Western ways. The captain will help train the fledgling national army. This film pits the captain against a Samurai tribal warrior and leader who, by way of leading a rebellion against the government, is trying to guide in wisdom the young Emperor who himself is unsure of the best way to lead Japan into the future. The young Emperor, inexperienced, is torn between advisers who wish to crush the Samurai and their traditions and the Samurai tribal leader himself who at one time was his mentor. In battle, the American Captain is captured by the rebellion, but is not killed. Instead he is held captive thru the winter at the remote mountain village of the Samurai leader and his people. The captain is free to move thru and observe the village and thru much trial eventually learns to respect their ways. It is here where he rediscovers his roots. He and the tribal leader, who is well educated and actually speaks some English, become close friends learning from each other while coming to honor their mutual ways and values. The Captain eventually sides with the warrior  and is by his side when he dies in the field of his final battle against the national army. The Captain carries his message of honoring the values and traditions of the Samurai and their importance to the history and culture of the people to the young Emperor and it is in death where the rebellion achieves victory. The Emperor decides in his favor and rejects the ambitious policies of his advisers: he will not engage in treaties with the West that compromise the historical roots and traditions of his people.

Japanese purists will find plenty to take offense to, but for the uninitiated this is a unique, beautiful insight to the world that once was, but no longer is.  Tom Cruise and the entire cast did a fantastic job of bringing this era back to life.

That's not my major gripe.  This just isn't much of a Blu-Ray release.

It doesn't LOOK that much better than the DVD did, but it obviously does improve so we'll give that a pass.  The features are, sadly, the exact same as the DVD, and for some reason they decided it wasn't worth it to subtitle the Japanese content in the extras.  So, on one hand, you've got a unique perspective being presented to you from the Japanese actors that you absolutely cannot understand without speaking Japanese, and in the other hand you've got something roughly equivalent to its previous media release.

I rated this as highly as I did because, regardless of the carelessness brought to releasing it on Blu-Ray, it was cheap, and it was a fantastic movie.  It's always disappointing to see Blu-Ray being used so carelessly.",1356739200,,1112,4.604060913705584

2007724,1,B0001JXOVC,"Beautifully shot and scored, this movie is enjoyable, but PLEASE do not think you are ""learning"" anything from it. You are not learning ANY history at all; you are watching a romantic fantasy about an alternate universe.

The message of the movie is that the old ways are better. In some cases, this is true. In the case of feudal Japan, not so much.

The Japanese feudal system has been described as a huge con job on the Japanese people, the peasantry in particular. Watching this film, you would have absolutely no clue as to why anyone would say that. It seems like a wonderful place filled with exotic, Eastern customs, honor, and so on.

In reality, our whole idea of the samurai is largely mythical ... invented by the samurai themselves to justify their existence and stave off their eventual obsolescence.

The whole concept came out of the Tokugawa era, where there was no one to fight. The ""samurai"" were not warriors, but a hereditary, privileged ruling class that imposed tremendous economic burdens on the common people. It was in the 17th century that Bushido was invented out of whole cloth and ""samurai history"" was recast in this fictional light of honor and loyalty.

From the actual documentation we have, such as records from the 14th century, it seems that in real battle, precursors to the mythical samurai mostly used pikes and arrows, not swords.

Loyalty was pretty much non-existent. Samurai switched sides depending on who paid better. Betrayal was a large part of ""military art""; some clans served both sides to guarantee income. Ritual suicide was mostly done when they were expecting to be executed, but even this was infrequent (until later, when suicide allowed you to pass on your property to your heirs, versus execution).

Japan's progress was very much dependent on the phasing out of the samurai. This movie wants to tell us differently.

Other reviews are correct that the idea of the white guy mastering their swordplay in such a short time is ridiculous. Not to mention the insult of wearing the widow's husband's armor.

But it's beautifully rendered, with some nice (mythical) swordplay. One star for that.

If you prefer the fantasy to reality, by all means vote this review down. But the reality remains.",1355184000,4,2249,4.879265091863517

2007751,5,B0001JXOVC,"""The Last Samurai"" is a historical epic with a deep personal and spiritual meaning often not seen in sweeping Hollywood pictures. Unfairly overshadowed at the time of its release by the equally impressive ""Return of the King"", ""Samurai"" is filled with masterful performances by Tom Cruise, Ken Watanabe, Koyuki, and many others. Every person involved in this film obviously brought their ""A"" game and truly bought into its unique vision. Edward Zwick presents a fitting story for our modern times, times that are increasingly driven by technology, greed, and efficiency while often neglecting the importance of true inner peace. The Samurai represent a simpler, more honorable way of life in which honor, virtue and loyalty to a set of moral principles proves more important than mere material success.
The redemption of American Captain Nathan Algren is beautiful to behold. The figure of Katsumoto, last guardian of a rejected worldview, is inspiring. The influences that both Algren and the Samurai have on each other are a pure joy to watch. The battle sequences are awe-inspiring, and truly moving, as the characters are painted with such a delicate touch that one truly feels the personal significane and moral weight of the conflict.
One of my favorite movies of all time, the film left me pondering the implications of committing one's self to a virtuous way of life regardless of the swirling world around us for weeks. A must-see for us all living in a time when life is driven less and less by what is right, and more and more simply by what will make us more ""successful"".",1353196800,,1584,4.958646616541353
2007752,4,B0001JXOVC,Great cast and acting and truly excellent premiss. The one thing missing from this movie is the eye candy and aesthetics that would really sell it. Still worth a view.,1353110400,,167,4.6
2007753,5,B0001JXOVC,"This movie got made fun of a lot, but I don't see why. It's a great story of an American soldier who went to Japan in order to teach their soldiers how to use modern weapons. After the fall of the Shogunate, the Meiji government was having issues suppressing rebellions across the country. Captain Algren was leading the government army in a campaign against the rebels. During the fight he was defeated and captured by the enemy. While in captivity he was introduced to the traditional Japanese way of life. He soon fell in love with the peoples dedication, and spirit of tranquility. He soon takes up the sword and fights along side his new allies to restore Japan to the way it used to be.

I really love this movie. I'm not a Tom Cruise fan, but he honestly did a great job. So did Ken Watanabe, as always. I was moved by the drama, and action portrayed here. There are also some pretty funny moments too, when the cultural barrier comes into play. This is one of my favorite all time movies. I realize there are people out there that don't like this movie, but I think most people will love it. I highly recommend it to anyone out there that wants to see a great film.",1352851200,,1173,4.3561643835616435
2007764,3,B0001JXOVC,"I can't give this four or five stars for several reasons--first off, the absolute love affair that the director has with stylized violence turns this into a bloodbath several times, and we spend tons of times in battle and relatively little time developing any of the Samurai characters (except Katsumoto), which could have led to a much stronger film.  Also, the historical inaccuracies are difficult to swallow, as is the fact that Cruise's character actually survives all of the experiences that he goes through.  It gets old seeing Hollywood ""heroes"" go to different countries and lead people from a different culture in battle all the time.  It's also a bit disconcerting that his character is basically Dunbar from ""Dances with Wolves,"" albeit in a much more violent setting.  I really loved watching the cultural elements of the movie, the acting is very good, and it's beautifully filmed, but this is one that loses much of its appeal as I think about it the next day.

Also, be careful if you buy the inexpensive DVD version--there are no extras at all.  There is a place for them on the menu, but when you try to go there, it tells you that the extras are on disc 2, and there is no disc two (ISBN 1-4198-9324-6).",1351382400,,1223,4.691588785046729

It's only 154 minutes long to be exact! Anyway, Tom Cruise delivers his finest performance as an ex-civil war hero who is hired to go to Japan and train the modern army against the samurais. However, during the first losing battle, he was captured and held as a prisoner at the camp filled with trained samurais. Then he falls in love with a wife of the slained warrior he killed during the first war in Japan. While he is living in the village as a ""slave""; he learns the culture of the samurai people. Then he learns how to fight like them as well. After he is released and returned back to the then modern day Tokyo, he isn't welcomed among friends because he wears the samurai clothes instead of civilian clothes of the 1860's. Then Samurai General is kidnapped and thrown in the dungeon. Tom rescues him from prison  and escapes back to the village. They prepares for the war the following week. The final battle scene is amazing how sword bound samurais fighting rifle shooting Japanese army. And I will not tell you about the ending because you must buy this DVD!

Unfortunately, this blu-ray does not do the film justice.  It's just a good blu-ray when it really could have been great.  The way this movie was shot was just beautiful and the blu ray does not take advantage of it very well.  I felt like this was just a slight improvement over the dvd release.
The audio fares a little better but still misses opportunities especially during the battle sequences.  For example, when cannons fire it isn't powerful at all.
Fortunately, there are a ton of really good extras on the disc.  They are interesting to watch if you want to know more about how the movie was made.

If you want action superhuman Rambo, Bruce Willis style where the hero never dies this is for you. Tom Cruise was hit so many times and he is still alive, unbelievably in arms and legs only! Historically inept, corny mundane Western guy meets new culture and most of all the worn out story of renegade soldier who sympathizes and joins the enemy and becomes traitor then hero.

2007809,4,B0001JXOVC,"This movie is wonderful in Blu-ray and DTS digital surround. These formats were created for movies with great vistas and battle scenes, which abound here.  It's a movie about honor, bravery, nobility and redemption.  Along the way we have subplots including the clash of civilizations in 19th century Japan, a tender, thought-provoking love story, an action thriller and a buddy movie between the Tom Cruise character, Captain Algren and the Samurai warrior, Lord Katsumoto, played by Ken Watanabe, who gives a better performance than Cruise, IMO.

I'm not Tom Cruise's biggest fan.  I consider him to be more of a movie star than he is an actor, yet I keep finding myself watching and enjoying his movies and this is my favorite.  He did a fine job in this movie, however. Not perfect but not much is. It was a difficult part, in that he had to convincingly portray a man going through major changes.  The redemption I mentioned, had to have been emotionally challenging for the actor. He did all his own stunts, btw.

The direction, filming and editing is as good as anything you're going to see.  The Blu-ray transfer was excellent.  The sets, primarily in the Warner Bros lot in Burbank and in New Zealand were outstanding.  The extras were equally outstanding, with the voice-over commentary by director Edward Zwick going more into his emotional journey with the film far more than the usual ""making of"", although there's plenty of that in the extras as well.

I gave it 4 stars.",1311984000,8,1485,4.807086614173229
2007810,5,B0001JXOVC,"Last Samurai is one of my all time favorite movies. It's often compared with ""Dances With Wolves"" set in Japan, and indeed the plots are somewhat similar: Damaged American soldier livea among natives / foreingers, learns to embrace their way of life and stands up for their survival in battle. But that's where the similarities end. Of the two movies (both regarded as classics) I personally think Last Samurai is the vastly superior film.

While it has been billed as an ""action"" film or a ""historical drama"" (both which accurately help describe the movie), The Last Samurai is first and foremost an Epic romance. Not to be mistaken as a romantic love story, the Epic romance is much larger in scope- a simple tale that beneath the surface is actually incredibly ""deep.""

First and foremost, the movie is a romance of lofty ""epic"" ideals: change vs. tradition, friendship, honor, self discovery and self forgiveness, fighting for what you believe in, redemption.

Detractors often argue the movie portrays capitalists and men of progress (such as Colonel Bagley and Omura) as villians who have no redeeming qualities. That is innacurate: YES, some characters who represent modernizaton are portayed as greedy and self serving (such as Omura); however, other modernists aren't villianized at all- General Hasegawa, the former samurai now fighting FOR the advancement of Japan, is certainly no villian- yet he is definitely modernist. The young nameless recruit who orders the machine guns to be fired at the end of the film is also not villianous. Even Tony Goldwin's Colonel Bagley isn't a greedy bastard like Omura- he truly believes that bringing American power to the less civilized nations of the world is the right thing to do. Today we might call such a person ignorant or prejudice, but back in the late 1800's when American globalization was still in its infancy, it was common for people to think the way Colonel Bagley did.

Omura may portray the bad guy, but the true villian in The Last Samurai is the fear of change. The main theme is as simple as it is complex: progression vs tradition, adapting to an increasingly changing world (which is embraced by some and difficult for others). There's the fear of stepping into the unknown- accepting and embracing the necessity of progress at the expense and abandonment of traditions held sacred and true; In Algren's case, the fear of the individual man who has fallen so far from grace that he believes he is damned, beyond redemption and unable to find salvation; the fear of becoming obsolete and un-neccesary; the fear of looking into a mirror and facing the reflection that stares back at you.

The true hero in the Last Samurai is the antithesis of fear, the romanticized ideals of hope, friendship, honor, self discovery- all which can only be obtained through complete self forgiveness and inner redemption.

The character of Nathan Algren (portrayed by Tom Cruise)has participated in an act of genocide against a tribe of native Americans that has left him a ruined aloholic shell of a man. Meanwhile, Katsumoto (Ken Wantanabe)finds himself and everything he stands for in jeopardy of becoming obsolete as his homeland swiftly moves from away from the traditional feudal society he to a new and modern one. At its core, the Last Samuari it is about the spiritual changes that come over two men who fight to preserve the ""old ways"" (which they see as a culture of discipline, respect, beauty, and communal solidarity in jeopardy of being overrun by ravenous forces of corruption and greed).

The acting is amazing, the cinematography breathtaking, and the musical score beautiful. The movie is filled with individual scenes of incredible power that rank among the greatest ever put on film: for example, the scene where Taka dresses Algren for battle is an example of cinematic PERFECTION- not a word spoken, yet so much emotion conveyed. The last line of the film (narrated) is one of my favorites of the entire film with Simon Graham philosophically concluding that Algren may have at last found a small measure of peace ""that we all seek, and few of us ever find.""

Like any movie, The Last Samurai is going to have its detractors, particularly with the last 5-10 minutes or so. It definitely isn't a perfect film, but for some(like myself)it's an immensely powerful film and its spiritual depth and beauty far outweigh its flaws. It's one of the few films that I can watch any time. An all time favorite.",1311206400,4,4475,4.917880794701987
2007811,5,B0001JXOVC,"1876 in Japan, an American soldier named Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) has been hired by the Emperor Meijii to train some Japanese soldiers to fight against the savage Samurai. He does get captured by the Samurai leader Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) while in battle as he is brought to their village, Nathan begins to learn the ways of their life and even becomes one of the people for 2 years as learns to switch sides to fight on their side for honor and love.

An amazing and sweeping old fashioned epic historical fiction drama from the director of the modern classic ""Glory"" Edward Zwick is one of the decade's best pictures. Co-starring Tony Goldwyn, Billy Connelly and Hiroyuki Sanada Koyuki this is a well made and violent adventure film that has a familar old story. Although very similar to films like ""Man Named Horse"", ""Dances with Wolves"", ""Lawrence of Arabia"" or ""Last of the Mohicans"" this one takes the old story of those to Japan instead of being in the western times or the French-Indian war or Arabia. The acting is flawless as is the direction, the action sequences are gory and well made and the photography is just stunning as is Han Zimmer's score.

2007813,5,B0001JXOVC,"I saw this film years after it's release because I didn't think it would interest me. I'm not a huge Tom Cruise fan, but he has impressed me in some of his films. 'The Last Samurai' just so happens to be one of those films! Cruise is excellent here and handles the lead role both physically and emotionally. Not since standing toe to toe with Dustin Hoffman in 'Rain Man' have I believed in one of his performances so whole heartedly.

The film will certainly remind viewers of Costner's 'Dances with Wolvies' as it deals with a similar premise of a Civil War soldier's study of a foreign culture and total turn around of his preconceived opinion of it. I do think that 'Dances with Wolves' edges this one out, but it is a wonderful film all the same.

The film is also beautiful to look with gorgeous scenery and breathtaking battles. The battle scenes are brutal, but never did I feel the graphic violence was gratuitous. There are a few tiny instances where I smelled Hollywood, but they are so tiny, I can't take away from this impressive film about honor and loyalty. It's just a beautiful film!

Ken Watanabe is also excellent in his first starring English role and I think he was nominated for an Oscar if I'm not mistaken.  Being Asian I was entranced by Zwick's sensitive direction and also by the stunning photography.

2007821,5,B0001JXOVC,"I love this movie.  There are few movies I can watch over and over.  This would be one.  I am a fan of Tom Cruise but not a fanatic fan.  He is a very nice looking man and can act fairly well. But I don't see any Oscars in his future.  That being said, I have enjoyed many of his films and look forward to many more.  I think he did a wonderful performance in this picture, however, even if he weren't in the picture, it could have stood on its own.  Ken Watanabe is a superb actor, not to mention a very sexy man who played Katsumoto.  Other actors of note include: Hiroyuki Sanada who played Ujio and might I add another hunk of burning love; Shin Koyamada, who played Nobutada, Katsumto's son and Tom Cruise's first Japanese friend and Maisha Khan, who played Taka, Katsumto's widowed sister and mother of two young boys and Tom Cruise's love interest.  As a little twist to the story, Tom had killed her husband in battle early in the movie, thus complicating her initial feelings for him.

The movie is epic albeit predictable throughout and the ending is a semi-tearjerker.  But that's okay.  You won't feel slighted and you will find yourself wanting to watch it again and again despite knowing the ending.  It is semi-family safe, no nudity that I can recall, maybe some mild curse words, but nothing that is over the top.  I watched it with my family.  But one word of caution: it is very, very violent.  Decapitations, amputations, other bodily mutilations during the battle scenes; these are samurai with very, very sharp swords and they used them very effectively.  So remove all small children and those with queasy stomachs from the room before viewing.",1295308800,2,1667,4.558922558922559

It has beautiful film locations, beautiful music, a good story line and a good cast. I feel this to be one of Cruise's better films and his performance is very credible.

2007838,4,B0001JXOVC,"Critics of The Last Samurai point out its obvious historically inaccuracies, the cheap ending, the tired plot already beaten to death before its predecessor Dances with Wolves stamped on the carcass, and the negative liberal view of the white man's legacy. All of these are valid points, but they lack support in light of the countless historical revisions filmed over the decades. One need only go back before the dawn of political correctness to see evidence of the contrary view of history; God-fearing white folk trying to scrape out a living on the frontier despite the devilish torment of the savage Injuns or white crusaders for Christ bringing salvation to the ignorant heathens beyond our shores. For the older among you who take exception to movies like The Last Samurai, Dances with Wolves, et al, I suggest you watch Birth of a Nation for some needed balance.
Furthermore, this movie never claims to be based on facts, so criticizing it for failing to represent history is the weak tool of conservatives too blinded by their own belief that America can do no wrong. These narrow-minded fools are no better than their self-righteous America-bashing adversaries. Somewhere in the middle lies reality.
The Last Samurai is an epic drama that focuses on the changes in a world, in a nation, and in a man. Troubled by his own violent past, Captain Algren (Tom Cruise in his limited, grinning, wide-eyed fashion) is the man who finds peace and forgiveness within himself through forced tenure among the Japanese in a Samurai village in 1876. The need for Cruise's character is debatable because the story of old ways coming to their end at the hands of dubious progress is worthy in and of itself, but this is a Hollywood movie and the movie never hides from its intended audience. The real treasure is in the sweeping scope of the cinematography, the insight to a way of life dramatically different from our own, powerful performances from the largely Japanese cast, an emotional score, and yes, the message, heavy-handed though it is.
Hollywood and history make for strange bedfellows, be it Jesus Christ or the Roman Empire, Jesse James or Wyatt Earp, Hollywood never takes on a historical character or movement it can't bring sympathy to using self-indulgent poetic license. Were it not morally reprehensible, they'd probably manage to make a compassionate film about the Nazis....if they haven't already.
There aren't a lot of great epic movies made because the balance between grandeur and excess or drama and action is perilous to maintain. The Last Samurai is worth the lengthy investment of time for the stirring emotional outpouring it wrenches from those willing to excuse the flaws and occasional cloying misstep.",1287273600,,2730,5.015418502202643

2007841,5,B0001JXOVC,"Many critics and filmgoers panned Tom Cruise's performance and his lack of believability of being a samurai.  However, his performance is spot on in my opinion.  You can sense his seriousness and issues with the American army's and his own actions of the war.  You can sense his appreciation of Eastern culture and his experience as a Civil War veteran through his eyes, his body language, and the delivery of his lines.  While I thought seeing Cruise dressed as a samurai would be unbelievable, his performance transforms his character so well that by the end of the movie when he dons the samurai outfit, I was completely convinced.  Other performances are great as well, including Timothy Spall (the photographer) and especially Ken Watanabe.  The story is extremely well written and the action scenes are well done, with no extra choreography or special effects that make the action seem less authentic.  Finally, the score by Hans Zimmer.  It's easily my favorite thing about the film, and it's quite possibly the best soundtrack and score composed without being grandiose.  Zimmer uses many simplistic pieces that have two-note melodies but they're so poignant and fitting, that you can't not be moved by many scenes.  While some scenes are overly dramatic (like most of Edward Zwick's films), The Last Samurai is one of my all-time favorite films and deserves to be seen as equally as legendary and epic as similar films such as Braveheart and Gladiator.",1284854400,,1461,5.0

2007852,1,B0001JXOVC,"I first saw this movie in 05 after everyone I knew who'd seen it said it was awesome.  However I had the exact opposite reaction to this movie.  Other reviewers have pointed out many ridiculous things about this movie.  Here are the ones I think are the most prevalent.
1. The historical and cultural reality of this movie is flipped to where the dwindling noble samurai are the good guys and the big mean Japanese government advised by the dastardly US is the bad guy.
2. The time it takes Tom Cruise to learn the ""ways"" of the samurai is extremely short, and the Samurai people he lives among, for the most part, seem to not have a problem with this outsider, despite their history of not accepting people outside of Japan.
3. It is in your face about the Indian Wars and the atrocities the ""white man"" inflicted on the Native Americans, and how US influence in Japan was evil and sinister in nature.  Not to mention it ""corrupts"" the culture that was once innocent in it's lack of industrialization and modern technology.

another stupid thing that others have pointed out is how the samurai are portrayed as only using the archaic sword and bow, while the evil government uses modern mechanized weapons.  This is BS, because the Samurai had been using guns since the 1600s just like much of the world.  This is typical for movies like it.  The poor weak natives who are nice to the earth and use thing that don't do little to no harm to the planet, while the big evil bad guys don't care and whatever they want to the earth.  I'm not necessarily saying they did this on purpose, but it is typical.

In closing, this movie sucks! It's an overly used storyline that is exactly like  Dances With Wolves, Avatar, ect.  The only difference being it's set in Japan. Even at 16 when I first saw The Last Samurai I abhorred it, and five year later I  still can honestly say the same.",1280361600,5,1879,4.45906432748538

2007858,4,B0001JXOVC,"For a picture of life in Japan during the Meiji Era (1868-1912), this movie does an excellent job of showing the division between the two societies battling for supremecy: the traditional Samurai and the new Western-style rule.  Cruise's character allows the viewer to be introduced into this foreign society, as well as see how his disillusionment mirrors some of the frustration that Katsumoto and his follower feel about the Emporer's abandonment of the old ways.  Granted, this is a highly romanticized view of the time period, and the ending may strike viewers as overly sappy, but overall, this is a solid story of adversity, change, and adaption during a tumultuous time.

The extras, however, fail the movie in several different ways.  The commentary by Zwick is ok, if not a little boring, but two features that fall short of comeptency are:

The History Channel: History vs. Hollywood
 - This is a truncated episode (""mini-doc"")that leaves a lot of detail out.  While the Cruise interview carries what there is, the doc hints at some analysis on why one person believes the movie's storyline is very Hollywood.

Japan Premiers
 - Footage of the 2003 premiers at both Tokyo and Kyoto.  Features interviews primarily of the Japanese cast and crew.  However, all of the Japanese interviews are in Japanese and no translation is available.  Since this is one of the only places where the Japanese actors speak at any length about their roles and experiences, not having translation available cheapens the inclusion in this Blu-ray disc.

Considering the above, get this for the movie and enjoy it.  Then, watch the documentaries, but lower your expectations.",1275782400,2,1664,5.069852941176471

(Tony Goldwyn) who ordered it.  When his old sergeant, Zebulon Gant (Billy Connelly), finds him and suggests the existence of a job just suited to him, he's intrigued, but his old Colonel's presence on the team does nothing for his enthusiasm.  The money does: $500 a month to travel to Japan, where the young Emperor Meiji (Shichinosuke Nakamura) has embarked upon a program to unify his country and bring in Western technology, and there help train the Imperial Army to fight a rebellious Samurai lord named Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe).  The Army turns out to be a ragtag band of conscripts that breaks in terror when it first faces the rebels, leaving Algren and Gant virtually alone, and when Gant is killed Algren goes berserk.  Katsumoto is deeply impressed by his fighting, and when Algren collapses, wounded and exhausted, he refuses to permit the American to be slain; instead, he takes him along as a prisoner, hoping to ""understand our new enemy.""  Slowly recovering his strength in the Samurai stronghold, Algren is at first little impressed by the Samurai ethos, but slowly he begins to realize the genuineness of their dedication and spirituality; always a quick study, he learns to speak Japanese and becomes so expert with the wooden practice swords that he fights Katsumoto's best warrior, Ujio (Jiroyuki Sanada), to a draw; and slowly he begins to understand that the Samurai, like the Indians, are fighting for their way of life.  A strange friendship grows up between him and Katsumoto, and Algren also finds himself attracted to his host's sister, whose husband he killed in the battle.  When the Emperor offers Katsumoto a safe-conduct to Tokyo, Algren goes there with him and is ready to leave the country, but on learning that the Samurai has been arrested and condemned to death, he engineers a daring plan to free him, and joins him in one last glorious but futile stand against the forces of modernity.

Algren isn't always a likeable character, but he's very human and comprehensible, and Cruise portrays with sensitivity and believability his slow conversion to the Samuari cause.  (The film is based on fact: curious viewers might want to consult Wikipedia's article on the Meiji Restoration to see how it all began and what effects it had on later Japanese history, including the country's character today.)

He quickly is impressed by the Samurai's skills in battle and unexpectedly drawn to their way of life while in captivity.

2007871,5,B0001JXOVC,"The Last Samurai is an outstanding film that tells the fictional story of Captain Nathan Algren (Cruise), a soldier haunted by regrets hired to train raw Japanese recruits to fight the Samurai, and Samurai leader Katsumoto (Watanabe), who is leading a rebellion in Japan against those who he believes are westernizing the country too quickly. Algren ends up becoming a prisoner of the Samurai, but after spending a number of months as their captive, subsequently finds peace in their way of life. Eventually, he joins forces with the men he was hired to fight against.

Not only is the plot interesting and original, but the performances of the actors are nothing short of amazing. Tom Cruise puts forth an outstanding effort, which I consider his best ever. Ken Watanabe is perfect as Katsumoto, commanding even more attention than Cruise, and all of the secondary characters are equally convincing in their roles. Some of the highlights include Koyuki as Taka, Hiroyuki Sanada as Ujio, and Timothy Spall as Simon Graham.

The execution of the battle scenes was excellent. This can be attributed to a cast full of professional sword-fighters as extras and Cruise and Watanabe doing all their own stunts. As seen in the extras, the progression of Cruise's skills with a sword isn't staged, either. Sanada and others spent hours working with him every day until he could handle a blade with precision.

Having seen this film a dozen times, I can also say I honestly am not able to find many mistakes in the filming and editing, either. The ones I have noticed are hidden well, and none of them take away from the film in any way. There are a few lines in the script that come across as slightly bland or predictable, but overall the script is very well written. Tom Cruise actually speaks Japanese in a handful of scenes, and he does it well.

What really makes the movie, on top of everything else, is the beautiful score composed by Hans Zimmer. Though he often recycles his scores and changes them very little, this one is unique and powerful.

The Last Samurai's historical accuracy isn't as poor as some reviewers would suggest, but it is a work of fiction. On the special edition of this DVD, 2 deleted scenes are included, along with ""the filming of"" one of the scenes, and ""the filming of"" the Cruise beheading scene. There is also a handful of interviews and a look at the real history of the decline of the Samurai in Japan.

All in all, The Last Samurai is an extremely entertaining and convincing film. The special edition of this DVD is well worth the extra few dollars, and it has become one of my all time favorite movies.",1257552000,2,2636,4.707158351409978

And what a life. Every shot of the Samurai village is postcard perfect almost to the point of unintended parody. Like Robert Redford's take on Montana in ""Legends of the Fall"", every view is spectacular, every sunset is orange, every leaf is colorful and falls just so and all the characters are freshly scrubbed and dressed in their Sunday best. You wouldn't be half surprised to see Hobbits pop out at any moment. Of course the old time Samurai are romanticized to the nth degree. Historically the Samurai at this point resembled Afghan warlords resisting a long overdue central government rather than the honorable colorfully armored knights that are depicted. (Samurai no more wore armor in the late 18th century than the British army did.)

Yet the picture despite one or two faults works. The acting, with one exception is uniformly excellent. The battle scenes are plentiful and full of surprise and the pacing is good. On the dark side newcomer Nakamura Shichinosuke plays the Japanese emperor like he was channeling Michael Jackson. The voice and mannerisms of the gloved one is as out of place for a Japanese emperor than it would be for the Pope. His strangely self effacing dialogue doesn't help his cause, yet it truly is his performance that is cringe worthy. In addition the last scene is an awful Hollywood copout. I still recommend The Last Samurai highly however as a thinking mans action movie.",1256169600,3,1830,4.82484076433121

If I can find more depth and meaning each time, I consider it more than just a film, it becomes a teaching about life. Such is my finding for this exceptional movie. It offers up a wide variety of important, even vital, lessons of life portrayed to perfection by everyone involved. The writing, directing, acting, locations, depth of meaning are all most excellent! In today's world we often race by the more subtle and beautiful aspects of life. A movie such as this calls forth pause and consideration of what is being served up for our enlightenment as well as our enrichment. The Last Samurai is about the redemption of humanity as well as the individual- the awakening to a deeper level of life, honor, purpose, self sacrifice, and pure, love. While watching this film for perhaps the 7th time, I fully realized that it is a true masterpiece. I suggest to the viewer, that they treat this film as one would a rare and fine wine. The point is to take your time with this film, sipping it slowly and savoring every drop of it's wonderful bouquet of thoughts and emotions, and in the end become enriched by an understanding what films have the potential of delivering and sadly also, what they seldom do and that is a fuller appreciation of ""life in every breath.""",1253664000,2,1372,4.536290322580645
2007887,4,B0001JXOVC,"This movie succeeds in its primary objective: it entertains.  There is a solid story here that engages the viewer, moves at a smart pace, and never drags.  Nor is this a shallow shoot-'em-up.  There is a fascinating overarching theme here: the transformation of Japan into a modern, industrial nation and the fact that elements of Japanese society, i.e. the Samurai, will not easily fit into the new order of things.

While this film has historical inaccuracies, it is a fact that there were revolts against the Meiji Restoration, which is what this film is about.  The Japanese are portrayed respectfully, and I think accurately, in this film.  The sets and scenery, by the way, in this film are about as good as you will ever find in any movie, and this one rewards the viewer who either sees it in a theater or on a first-class flat-screen TV (as I did.)

Tom Cruise does a pretty good job in this film, and he has plainly matured as an actor over the years.  In my opinion, however, Ken Wantanabe, as the main Japanese protagonist, dominates every scene he was in, leaving the viewer wishing for more.  I have noticed this about Cruise (and other big-star) films--the director seems compelled to place Cruise in almost every scene.  Nothing against Cruise, but a little less would have been more, because the Japanese cast was engaging and competent, and I would have liked to have seen more of them.

For anyone else, especially those with friends or family who may be returning from serving overseas in Iraq or Afganastan, this movie can help give you a small glimpse of the conflict those who fight face.  At it's heart this movie is about a soldier, who was forced into a battle that was against everything he thought was right.  How it took a toll on him, his hate for himself and others.  And his personal road to reclaiming his personal honor, and mental health.  It also shows how we can learn from other cultures if we just take the time to understand them.  Even now in places we consider the ""third world"" there are aspects of various cultures we can still learn from.

2007897,3,B0001JXOVC,"sometimes makes a good movie. The Last Samurai is. Historical? Hardly. Take a few grains: yes, Samurai existed in Japan as an ancient, militaristic culture, a law unto themselves, & Japan was opening itself up to the west at the time of the movie (1876). Aside from that... Cruise is an emotionally damaged hero of the civil & Indian wars. He is contracted to whip the Japanese army into a fighting force. Who is the enemy? The Samurai, who are much admired & feared through-out Japan. They refuse to surrender to modernity & give up their way of life. In battle he is captured by the Samurai. Their leader is played very well by Ken Watenabe. He is impressed by Cruise's fighting skills & spares him. Can you guess the rest? Of course. It's right out of Dances with Wolves but probably less accurate. While a prisoner he adopts the Samurai lifestyle.  Oh the pain, the inner conflict, the over-acting. I said it was a GOOD movie (C+). That's it. The Samurai are doomed, destroyed by time  more than anything else. Well done battle scenes. Lots of really good extras in this two disc set. Cruise is really charismatic & likeable in the extensive interviews he gave. He put a lot of time & effort into this movie. Lots of background & interviews with other principals. They even had The History Channel episode History or Hollywood? about the movie & the ""history"" behind it. In some ways the extras are better than the movie.",1227484800,,1425,4.606299212598425
2007898,4,B0001JXOVC,"The year is 1876, Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) has been hired by the Japanese in order to help the Imperial Japanese Army become more 'modern' and less 'traditional' and ultimately prepare them to fight the legendary Samurai. Events occur that cause Tom Cruise to be a captive of the deadly but extremely polite Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) who is the leader of the Japanese Samurai. This is where the movie really starts to shine and and a beautiful forgotten world that we know little about comes alive thanks to the great director Edward Zwick and the ledgendary Hans Zimmer brings an unforgettable soundtrack.

Tom Cruise has been in the movie industry for a long time and to date in my opinion this is by far his best performance. He discovered after his capture that the samurai are peaceful and as bad as they are made out to be, Cruise's character becomes emotionally bound to them and he integrates himself into their society after working hard to earn their trust. Another special part of the film is that a relationship develops between Algren and a quiet widow by the name of Taka, however this isn't a main part of the film it shows that the film isn't all about power and a disappearing nation but an emotional and beautiful aspect of the film.

The Last Samurai is a deep emotional and violent film which has become a  triumphant in the movie industry. Thanks for it's gripping storytelling, and excellent character design. By far Tom's Cruise's finest hour.",1224806400,,1475,4.75390625

Thank you Hollywood and Zwick and Logan from a 'nihonjin.' I thought Cruise did a great job. I didn't see any of the reckless grinning that he known for, and he did a great portrayal of a disillusioned but fierce and loyal soldier. And this was exactly how many of the samurai felt in that era. This was a great fantasy film about a time of great change in Japan. You have to remember this is a fairy tale, but the Meiji Restoration was a turning point in Japan's history that I am happy that Americans can be better aquainted with. And the love scenes were well crafted, no obligatory sex scene (thats absolutely impossible for a gaijin and nihonjin in that time period!!!)

2007906,2,B0001JXOVC,"If you took Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe out of this storyline, it's really nothing but a Steven Seagal/ Chuck Norris movie.  (The Last Samurai is also a reiteration of Harrison Ford's Witness, minus the charm.)  Invincible American white man goes to Asian country, learns their tradition to perfection in a mere two seasons, and becomes one of their leaders to lead them into war, and survives the battlefield while every Japanese samurai gets annihilated, ending in a scene where EVERY Japanese soldier kneels and bows to the great white god on the battlefield.  When you tell a story where the protagonist has ALL the good cards all the time, it makes you question whether the movie has a message, or is just another advancing notch in  cultural imperialism, creating a storyline where natural selection enables the superior party to continue into the next  generation.  I know entertainment should be treated as entertainment and not historical fact or social theory, but when you have highly questionable circumstances, then it throws the other, more important aspects of the movie into question.

Now I understand that this movie is literally a rice queen's dream come true.  I mean, there are very few places in this world where you can kill a man, say ""I'm sorry"" to the hot widow, and end up hopping in the sack with her.  All this while the dead man's surviving children adore and dote over you, the man who killed their father.  Once we question the realism of a man being able to master a form of martial arts in a few months, we begin to question the success rate of whether we, can indeed go around killing men if we want to sleep with their wives.  And if we can't buy into THAT fantasy, well then what the heck is the point of watching the movie!?

The photography was good and the acting wasn't bad.  At one point I wished dearly that the sentimental soundtrack would halt.  War is a horrific act of mankind.  I think this movie went to lengths to capture the reality and horror of war combined with man against machine, and it came stunningly close.  In independent foreign films, war scenes have often been depicted without any lush orchestration.  I think that, is a responsible decision.  I could not help envisioning the battlefield climax without the soundtrack.  Just the hard reality of men's groans, horses neighing, and screams of terror in the stark afternoon air would deliver the message tenfold.  I felt insulted that music needed to be enlisted to ""help"" me feel that way about something so horrific.

Koyuki plays Taka, the widow, who is curiously mute throughout the movie.  It's the stereotypical form of submissiveness that the West is comfortable with when it comes to Asian women.  Cruise's lack of facial expressiveness is hidden by facial hair, so that helped.

All in all, I thought it had great potential.  I gave it an extra star because it came close to capturing how horrific war is, especially when one side is over-armed, and the other has, only honor.",1208563200,8,2998,4.752417794970986

To imply that there was a group of Japanese Samurai who refused to use fire-arms is retarded. The Japanese have used guns since they first encountered them from the Europeans in the early 1400's, from these they reverse engineered. Japanese Warlords have won the entire country with rifle-men.

Historically, there really were a group of samurai who rebelled against a modernizing Japan. And they really did fight to death. And they really did only used swords.

But not due to a retarded dogmatic aversion to guns, but because they ran out of gun-powder in their last battle.

2007922,4,B0001JXOVC,"For the first hour and forty minutes this is a near faultless film which examines the very heart of the human soul. Cruise plays a brilliant US army soldier, Captain Algren who has seen one too many battles and is haunted by the horrific injustices dealt to the American Indians by himself and his fellow US soldiers.

He is offered a large sum of money to train the Japanese army so that it can fight the last of the rebel Samurai tribes. In the opening battle he is captured by the Samurai and it is then that he can see the parallel with the Indians and eventually switches sides. All this is beautifully filmed and some of the scenes in the Samurai village, when Captain Algren is gradually adapting to the Samurai way of life reminded me of Kevin Costners Dances with Wolves.

I am not especially a fan of Tom Cruise but he is good in this. However it is Ken Watanabe as the Samurai leader Katsumoto who shines throughout the film. In supporting roles Billy Connelly and Timothy Spall are both
very good.

Sadly in the last half hour the film lost a lot of credibility for me, hence I have only given it four stars. Without giving away the ending I can't be specific in my criticism of this part, but suffice to say I wish the writers had come up with something better and more believable!

2007924,4,B0001JXOVC,"I enjoyed watching ""The Last Samurai"" again.  It's one of my daughter's favorites and was under the Christmas tree for her this year.

Tom Cruise is the star.  He plays Nathan Algren, a veteran of wars with the American Indians and is haunted by atrocities committed.  We see numerous black and white flashbacks of women and children being shot by soldiers.  Being part Native American, I found these sequences particularly moving and disturbing.  So for me, Algren's depression that sent him to drink seemed quite believable.  Cruise does seem so determined that his acting at times seems a bit forced and calculated rather than an organic performance.  That said, he was nominated for Best Actor by the Golden Globes.

Edward Zwick directed the picture and won the Best Director Award from the National Board of Review.  He has also directed ""Glory,"" ""The Siege,"" & ""Blood Diamond.""

Ken Watanabe as Katsumoto shined in this picture.  He's the philosophic Samurai who leads the rebellion against technological compromises with the West.  He demonstrates intelligence, compassion and the rarest of all screen commodities, wisdom.  The final battle sequence is incredible.  He well deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination.  Tim Robbins took home the gold in that category for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mystic-River-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B0001ZX0OW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mystic River (Widescreen Edition)</a>.

Tony Goldwyn who is the grandson of movie mogul Samuel Goldwyn (think MGM) plays the role of Col. Benjamin Bagley.  Goldwyn is still most associated as the bad guy in ""Ghost,"" and plays an arrogant soldier who despite his good looks is not sympathetic.

Hiroyuki Sanada plays Ujio, the apparent second in command to Katsumoto.  Sanada has been nominated for five Best Actor awards from the Japanese Academy with two wins including one for his brilliant portrayal in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Twilight-Samurai/dp/B00065GX0K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Twilight Samurai</a>.  He does an excellent job taking an instant dislike to Algren, battling him into the mud in a rainy day duel, and eventually coming to respect him after Nathan battles against the masked Ninja who attack their village.

Smaller roles deserving of special mention are Koyuki's performance as Taka, who nurses Algren to health despite complaining that he smells like a pig.  She was in the Japanese film ""Pulse.""  Shichinosuke Nakamura plays the uncertain Emperor Meiji.  Sosuke Ikematsu does a delightful job as the young boy Higen who tries to be tough like a Samurai, but can shed a tear.  Director Masato Harada makes an acting appearance as Omura who wants to bring railroads and Western weapons to Japan.  Shin Koyamada is a good looking young actor.  He plays Nobutada who takes a number of arrows on his escape on the bridge and brings humor and determination to his screentime.  Billy Connolly who was Uncle Monty in ""Lemony Snicket"" plays the gray-haired Zebulon Grant who stands by Algren and suffers a fatal wound in the first battle.  Zwick does a nice job of creating a good ensemble with his cast.

In addition to Watanabe's nomination, this film was also nominated for Oscars for Best Sound Mixing, Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design.  The Japanese Academy awarded it as ""Best Foreign Film.""  As a piece of fictional cinema, it is a tale well told.  Enjoy!",1201132800,3,3483,5.521739130434782

2007940,5,B0001JXOVC,"Although the breathtaking battle scenes are its centerpiece, ""The Last Samurai"" tries to be more than just a big-budget action flick. While it succeeds at doing this, it has major problems.

The biggest problem for me is Tom Cruise. He's pretty much the same character you see in ""Mission Impossible,"" and while I like him in those types of movies he is completely unconvincing as a gritty Civil War veteran. His performance as a drunk is also an eye-roller, and when I saw ""Maverick"" in Samurai armor it was so silly I had to laugh out loud.

The other major problem for me is the fact that Katsumoto, a villager in rural Japan during a time when Japan was completely cut off from the West, speaks fluent English. Very convenient for American moviegoers, but completely unbelievable.

To its credit the movie makes little pretense about being historically accurate (in fact, one of the extras on the DVD is a mini documentary called ""History vs. Hollywood""), yet still has a strong historical feel. When you examine the costumes, the sets, and the overall ""look and feel"" of the movie, it's obvious a lot of research went into the development and production of this film.

When judging this movie you have to consider that without a Hollywood star in the lead role and other concessions this movie could never have been made. It is a big-budget epic that requires formulaic mainstream appeal in order to have any hope of getting a return on investment. The bottom line though is that this is a movie worth seeing. The cinematography is stunning, the storyline is touching, it is well acted by its Japanese cast, and the closing battle is like nothing you've ever seen before. Just know that the Japan you see in this movie has a lot of Hollywood in it.

I'm giving this 5 stars. While I think this is a 4-star movie, the quantity and quality of the extras included on the second DVD were excellent, hence the 5 stars.",1194220800,4,1918,4.646017699115045

The acting is generally average, with the exception of the usual Tom Cruise faux intensity, replete with the usual faux intellectual/academic post movie interviews...
As for action scenes, the audience get's to watch a slo-mo repeat of one sword-swingning scene presumably to show us how great the fist version would have been had it been properly filmed...and the epic scenes are, well, simply put, NOT EPIC.
The lack of love interest is apparent in the apparent lack of interest in the female character by Cruise - no surprise - which leaves the male viewer with little more than some OK aikido, iaido and sushi.

2007944,5,B0001JXOVC,"After picking up my HD DVD player I've had troubles watching regular DVD movies.  I had heard some good things about this movie but couldn't pass it up once it was in high definition.

The story is pretty good.  This is the story of Captain Algren who has been sent to Japan in the late 1800's in order to help them modernize the Japanese army as they go from fighting with swords and arrows to machine guns and cannons.

After the ""modern"" Japanese army prematurely attacks the Samurai and lose horribly, Captain Algren is taken captive by the Samurai and introduced to their way of life and refusal to lay down the sword in the name of compliance.  In time, Captain Algren finds himself wanting to become one of the Samurai and learning more of their way of life.

The story is pretty good but what raises this up to the level of being outstanding is the high definition quality of the movie.  It was fantastic, especially seeing the colorful Japanese landscape in all of its magnificence.

If you like Tom Cruise action movies, this is one to pick up especially in high definition (whether it be Blu-Ray or HD DVD).  The violence can be extremely graphic (hey, this is war) so if you are sensitive to that you may want to look for something else.  Otherwise, the pacing of the movie is pretty good.  It isn't an all out gore-fest... there is action and then it breaks and lets you relax and catch up a little bit and then goes back to action and so on and so forth.",1192060800,3,1468,4.4

There was a nice transition from languages to illustrate his communication with the Japanese samurai. I still would have preferred Cruise learning the language and seeing it almost entirely subtitled, but that's not a viable approach for Hollywood. Nevertheless, the director did a good job of capturing the culture. Even though I tend to be a purist, it's possible to watch this film and be entertained, despite some inaccuracies.

Browsing through the reviews (there is just too many), I stopped after finding out one reviewer who reflected on why this movie was not that popular in the US and why it it was almost not mentioned in the Oscar (that was my impression at least).. Well, the reviewer said something about the view of the ""whiteman's burden"" made have caused unpleasant reactions.. that could be part of the reason, but my opinion is, the movie was released at a bad political timing and was censored by Hollywood as part of the ""Patriot"" canpaign designed at getting moral support to the invasion of Irak

Now you may label me now as a ""conspiracy paranoid"", but let me deliniate some aspects too see if they are not logical.. in the movie, americans go to Japan as mercenaries with a agenda of opening the big arms trade with imperial Japan.. to make matters worse, an ethical crisis occurs to the character of Tom Cruise.. an actor who is still remembered as a patriotic pilot who shot down those dreaded MICs in ""Top Gun"" ( a movie destined to make the public feel good at their defense expenditure)... talk about a bad timing to reflect and see that your goverment; not only sends you to genocide the american indians, now its time to continue somewhere else!! and what's even worse, he joins the other side!!, not exactly the kind of attitude you need on the troop morale sent to invade Irak under weak grounds.. hell, was it not enough the catharsis done by all those Vietnam movies? (where Tom Cruise did a Nam veteran).. well that was then this is now... lets face it.. why such an epic movie, a superb production and  what I consider Cruise's pass to inmortality in the world of true films, was given a ""foreign movie"" treatment??!!

First of all people who claim there is no difference between this and the SD DVD is either blind, or have bad equipment issues. While it is a definitive step up from the SD DVD I would agree that this isn't among the best I've seen. There is nothing particularly wrong with the transfer, but it lacks that ""3d"" look that some of the best HD DVD titles offer. The goods are very accurate colors and contrast level, black level is also good with ample shadow detail. Film grain is at minimal, and don't see any edge enhancement. Sharpness is where the problem lies, and so is detail is lacking a bit. This movie didn't have the typical big action picture sound, though it had a sweeping score, and some battle related sound, but it won't be your new demo disc.

2 1/2 hours for this film. Drunken, guilt-ridden, Indian War veteran is hired by Japanese government to stamp out  rebellion, gets captured, dries out, and over the course of a few months becomes a disciplined, fierce, Zen-like Samurai warrior. In his spare time he becomes fluent in Japanese. He switches sides, becomes a master tactician, kills countless Japanese soldiers and a few Americans along the way, and lives to tell the tale.

The scenery was nice, the Japanese actors terrific, and thankfully the incipient love affair wasn't allowed to blossom on screen, which would have violated every norm of Japanese culture of the time. Maybe I'm taking it too seriously, but the notion that a Westerner could enter this proud, ancient culture with such relative ease seemed almost disrespectful to me.

2007967,4,B0001JXOVC,"""The Last Samurai"", as mentioned by another reviewer above, has a lot of parallels in movies such as ""Dances With Wolves"". The whole wash-up, has-been hero finds a new sense of self and identity with people once perceived as ""barbarian"" or ""savage"". The theme has been done before and probably will be again.

In ""The Last Samurai"", Capt. Algren is sent to Japan during the tale end of the Meiji Restoration to train the new Imperial Army in modern warfare. Despite the excellent pay, Algren is an alcoholic with some serious personality issues to boot. The new Imperial Army is soon sent into battle with the other problem: a rebel force of samurai led by Katsumoto, (Ken Watanabe). The results are predictably disastrous and Algren is captured alive. The rest of the plot follows a predictable pattern that most will be familiar with.

The character of Katsumoto is actually based, albeit very loosely, on a real person whol live during a similar time and fought in Kyushu. The real man was one Saigo Takamori, who also committed seppuku according to legend. He actually died from bullet wounds sustained during his last stand near Kagoshima. A good book about the man is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Samurai-The-Life-and-Battles-of-Saigo-Takamori/dp/0471705373/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Samurai: The Life and Battles of Saigo Takamori</a>, which is also an excellent read.

Tom Cruise puts in an excellent performance, I have to say, as the dysfunctional Algren. Ken Watanabe is amazing in his protrayal of the samurai rebel leader, Katsumoto, bringing an intensity and depth to the movie that can be lacking in other characters.

There are some small issues of error, such as ferns and so on in the forests. Being shot in New Zealand, the movie has some scenery from that country that is visibly not Japanese. However, these points are very small and do not take away from the spectacle of the film and its location.

The battle scenes are truly amazing, and well shot. There is enough action and some comic relief to keep everyone pretty well entertained. The cultural differences between Algren and his Japanese hosts are a source of some amusement, especially as the younger samurai take a liking to him. This is despite the regular beatings he receives from older samurai he tries to take on.

Despite the predictability of the movie, and the lack of originality in some regards, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I liked the style, the action, and the plot, and came away feeling thoroughly entertained and somewhat moved.

2007971,5,B0001JXOVC,"This turned out to be one of the best films I have ever seen. I knew this film could easily be misunderstood, and whereas I had doubts myself in the beginning, after watching it they had all but removed and I was in love with it. As with all good films, this one had picked the right people to play the characters. This had included Katsumoto, Omura, Emperor, Taka, Simon Graham, the Americans, even the guardian. It smartly blends in the flares and drama in both American and Japanese cultures and anyone who can appreciate both cultures can easily testify to great illustration of both. The film could easily be misunderstood for a few reasons: 1. most audience may appreciate one of the two cultures presented in the movies, but not both, thus appreciation for half of the movies would be blanked out. 2. because the film touches on a historical event, it would most likely be criticized for its accuracy. this is a mistake, however, since audience should realize that this is hollywood after all, and the director had never intended or claimed to make a documentary, he is making a movie. as most movies are strictly fictional, the fact that this is actually ""based on a significant historical event"" is of great educational value.

Having some understanding and appreciation of the Japanese culture before  viewing this, have to say that this illustration of the Japanese culture was absolutely true and beautiful. And whereas originally I had thought the idea of Tom Cruise being a samurai might be tacky, but the sequence of events, the transformation of his character into becoming one, had made it seem surprisingly natural. Though the film is about conflict and warriors, and it was supposed to be heavy with bloodsheds and killing, the story blended in enough light hearted sub-plots to actually allow the audience to breathe and smile at times amist the serious storyline of a part of a nation's tradition becoming extinct. The balance in the movie was very well done. Tom Cruise's character's integration into a part of Japanese culture itself is a success story. There would probably be more countless stories of how this type of integration would've failed, but Tom's character had succeeded. It did so through respect, appreciation, camaraderie, and deep feelings. The references to western cultures on occasion had been also very smart. There is a sense of comfort in that even if the warriors had fought to their death in their cause, they were actually not alone, as other nations, people, in near and distance past, have also fought to death for theirs.

Other than that, as a movie, the cinematography, the music and sound, the the historical illustrations, the traspassing of two cultures that in most people's eyes are largely incompatible, the entertaining value, should make this one of the top movies ever had. The box office did not give it all the credits.

This is highly recommended, and even if certain things in the movie may seem strange at first, it is definitely worth watching. Someday these things that did not make sense might in rare instances come to light. Along with what might come to light though, is the awareness also that this is really a movie, and reality may not be as pretty as it is set out to tell....",1165795200,,3254,4.826164874551972

I have to say that Ken Watanabe is great in this movie. The battle scenes are 'glorious', and the shifts from normal speed to slo-mo are perfect.  Sound also has some zoom effects that don't distract, but add to the themes of this movie. It is a movie I will watch again sometime.  Excellent movie.  You should see it if you haven't yet.

The character development is a bit loose and had somewhat of a rushed feeling. The story sometimes came off as unbelievable or inconsistent, for instance the first battle where Tom Cruise is captured really does not connect to the other part of the story. Tom being wounded defeats several samurai warriors, later his fighting skills were shown to be much more inept compared to the samurai. This did not seem consistent to me. The Japanese Emperor not knowing what to do and playing both sides of the fence seemed a bit unbelievable.

You get the feeling that the reason why Ken Wantanabe's character respects Tom Cruise so much, is because that they both were tortured battle tired warriors. Overall, I did enjoy this film. It does have some beautiful cinematography.

2007980,5,B0001JXOVC,"SPOILERS INCLUDED

THE LAST SAMURAI is one of the best efforts of Tom Cruise's uneven and strange career. Very loosely based on actual events, THE LAST SAMURAI recounts the story of the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877, when the Samurai forced the last stand of traditional Japanese culture against the the modernizing influences of the Meiji Restoration.

As part of his drive to bring Japan into the family of nations the Meiji Emperor hired literal armies of foreign advisors. In the film Cruise plays Captain Nathan Algren, a survivor of Gettysburg who later served under Custer and fought Indians on the frontier. The brutalities he has seen have rendered Captain Algren a nightmare-ridden and viciously cynical drunkard. Recruited to go to Japan and train the modern Japanese Army by his despised former superior, Colonel Bagley (Tony Goldwyn), Algren at first adopts the endemic sneering attitude toward the Samurai shared by the ""modernizers"". However, the more he hears of the Samurai, the more respect Algren begins to accord them, much to the disgust of his fellows.

When his green army is forced into a premature engagement with the Samurai, Algren is captured and held prisoner by the Samurai leader Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). Watanabe is the true star of this film. His powerful but understated performance is electric, and Katsumoto's character expresses the best of the Bushido Code and of Japanese tradition. As Algren observes his enemies (and they observe him), hatred mellows into distrust, distrust mellows into acquiescence, acquiescence mellows into acceptance, acceptance becomes respect, and respect becomes liking, and then true friendship. Algren, the professional soldier, comes to see the Bushido Code and the disciplined lifestyle of his captors as the highest expression of his own art---the Art of War. When battle comes, Algren casts his lot with the Samurai.

Although given a safe passage to Tokyo, Katsumoto is unable to sway the young and timid Meiji Emperor, his former student, who is as much a prisoner of the ""modernizers"" as Algren had been of the Samurai traditionalists. Hostilities flare again when Omura (Masato Harada) the chief of the ""modernizers"" tries to have Katsumoto assassinated. The Samurai withdraw into the mountains and prepare for the final battle. When it comes, the Samurai nearly overwhelm their opponents, but armed with cannons and gatling guns, the modern army is insurmountable. In the end, only Algren survives to bring Katsumoto's sword to the Emperor. Although Algren is spat upon by Omura, the Meiji Emperor is so moved by Katsumoto's reverence for the old ways that he orders Omura to commit seppuku. In the end, the cowardly Omura merely exiles himself.

THE LAST SAMURAI had only a lukewarm reception in the United States. Some reviewers felt that the character of Captain Algren was of the ""White Man's Burden"" ilk, that the film was disrespectful of the American historical experience, and that the Samurai were overidealized. Much of this can be put down to a festering dislike of Cruise in the wake of his divorce from Nicole Kidman. However, the film was wildly successful in Japan, and many moviegoers left the theaters in tears, moved by the powerful depiction of traditional Japanese values in the character of Katsumoto and his fellow Samurai. While it is true that much of the Bushido Code was vastly oversimplified in the telling, the essence of Samurai values permeates the film, which, after all, is a form of entertainment, not a philosophical discussion.

The ""Extras"" disc is an ""Extras"" disc. Once a pastiche of fascinating folderol, ""Extras"" discs have degenerated into a predictable melange of ""The Making Of..."", pointless commentaries, and deleted scenes we wish had stayed deleted. This one isn't much different, though it does have a nice ""Hollywood vs. History"" segment that discusses the real samurai, in truth largely a repressive and regressive elite that had outlived themselves in the 19th century. What might have been very interesting would have been a discussion of how the Bushido Code was institutionally perverted into racist militarism in the first half of the 20th century. The segment barely touches on that subject.

He did okay but a more ""salty"" actor would have given the role a bit more depth.  Cruise plays an Army officer who fought in Civil and Indian wars - not quite sure about both, but in either case, he'd have a bit more crow feet and gray hairs than Cruise.  Otherwise, the pace, character development, etc was good.  The final battle scene was a bit dragged out but I think was done for effect.

2007986,3,B0001JXOVC,"This movie will almost certainly appeal to persons who like action films and quasi historical epics. I found the movie generally interesting and entertaining as a movie. However, as an historical epic it is quite lacking. The plot in the movie and especially the character played by Tom Cruise often reminded me of the ""Shogun"" television mini-series and the film ""Dances with Wolves."" The ending also reminded me of ""The Charge of the Light Brigade,"" starring Errol Flynn. I also think ""The Last Samurai"" tends to somewhat overly romanticize the samurai in Japan of the 1860's.

  People can honestly debate whether a film's significant historical inaccuracies justly merit criticism and/or an overall less favorable review. As an action movie i would rate ""The Last Samurai"" four stars. However, for many of the same reasons why I have considerable reservations about the very unrealistic character played by Kevin Costner in ""Dances with Wolves,"" I will give ""The Last Samurai"" only three stars.

  ""The Last Samurai is certainly worth watching. However, the  army officer played by Tom Cruise detracts from the historical validity in the film of the negative reaction by many of the samurai to modernization efforts in Japan during the late 1860's.

2007993,5,B0001JXOVC,"I'm not throwing off on Tom Cruise, who, despite some bad PR decisions in the past year, I still think has the ability to breathe life into a movie.  Some of his films have been among my favorites (Jerry Maguire, for instance.) But this one belongs entirely to Watanabe who makes Katsamoto a character we empathize with and ultimately understand on an intimate level thanks to Watanabe's nuanced portrayal.

The movie depicts a time of immense change--both for America and for Japan--and manages to tell a story that is much more than that of the dying Samurai's rebellion.  It's a world on the brink of industrialized warfare, a time when America has been torn apart by civil war, only to see certain elements mirrored in the far away Japanese culture.  Against this backdrop two men form an unexpected relationship: Cruise, the war shocked veteran of both the Civil War, and later the war against Native Americans as the US dominated and obliterated without truly understanding the culture that had lived on the soil first.  Katsamoto, a Samurai who had trained and tought the emperor as a boy--a man the ruler admires and doesn't want to combat--but who represents not the new ways of Gatling guns and slick combat.

As Nathan (Cruise) is captured by Katsamoto (Watanabe) the two forge an unlikely friendship, finding more than same than not.  This is the true story of the film--how two men, supposedly so different, can meet on the common ground of experience and honor.

I've seen this movie at least eight or nine times and would watch it again in a heartbeat.  If you love the sorts of glorious epics that Edward Zwick has created in the past (GLORY, LEGENDS OF THE FALL), and even if you don't but simply love a beautiful film with characterization at its center, this is a must see movie.",1151107200,5,1798,4.737179487179487

2007996,4,B0001JXOVC,"The Movie, 'The Last Samurai' is meant to provide an epic story of the corruption (Westernization) of Japan during the Meiji Restoration. And just as Kevin Costner 'goes Indian' in DANCES WITH WOLVES, Nathan Algren, played by Tom Cruise, goes 'Japanese'. While portrayed as a historical character, the Civil War veteran and Indian fighter was a completely fictional character.

The best part of the movie is Ken Watanabe, who gives an excellent performance portraying Katsumoto, the leader of the Japanese Samurai. Of course, Katsumoto is a fictional character as well.

For those of you who are interested, the following is a short survey of the situation in Japan, which the movie attempts to cover.

Katsumoto is based upon Saig Takamori, was one of the most influential samurai in Japanese history, who lived during the late Edo Period and early Meiji Era. As a low-level samurai, he was recruited to travel to Edo, modern day Tokyo, to assist Shimazu Nariakira, daimyo of Satsuma han. He was later put in command of over fifty thousand samurai, a large part of the imperial army.

Saig initially disagreed with the modernization of Japan and the opening of commerce with the West. He did insist, however, that Japan should go to war with Korea because of their refusal to recognize the legitimacy of the Emperor Meiji as head of state of the Empire of Japan. But because the other leaders of the restoration strongly opposed these plans out of budgetary and cost considerations, Saig resigned and returned to his hometown of Kagoshima.

Shortly thereafter, he established a private academy in Kagoshima for the faithful samurai that had also resigned their posts in order to follow him from Tokyo. In 1877, led by Saig, they revolted against the central government (the Satsuma Rebellion), which had just eliminated their rice stipends. The imperial palace had recruited new guards who had previously been rice-growing peasants. They were armed with modern weapons. The samurai, lead by Saig, also being equipped with modern weapons, were able to seriously challenge the imperial army in battle for several months. Badly injured in the hip during the final battle, the Battle of Shiroyama, instead of being killed or captured by the enemy, Saig asked for his head to be cut off by a comrade to preserve his honor. Legend and art show that Saig committed seppuku, a traditional form of suicide.

It is actually unknown what the exact style of his death was. The accounts of his subordinates claim either that he up righted himself and committed seppuku after his injury, or that he requested a comrade assist his suicide. In debate, some scholars have suggested that neither is the case, and that Saig may have gone into shock following his wound, losing his ability to speak. Several comrades upon seeing him in this state, would have severed his head, assisting him in the warrior's suicide they knew he would have wished. Later, they would have told that he committed seppuku in order to preserve his status as a true samurai. In any case, the head was hidden by a retainer and never found. This was unsettling to the government, as it was the head that would prove his death in battle. The lack of closure allowed for many folktales to be created, saying that Saig was still alive and plotting revenge.",1150588800,2,3310,4.912343470483005
2007997,5,B0001JXOVC,"This is a great movie to show in history classes.  It's a great tool of showing how Japan was ""westernized.""

And give you an idea how the samurai and their families lived.

Not only is this a great teaching tool but it's great entertainment.  It's not that bad of a movie.  There's a little humor in it and some serious moments where you can actually learn something about life itself.

The use of horses, bow and arrow, weaving, agricultural lifestyle, respect and honor.  Portrayed romanticized life of Samurai with great action scenes and beautiful cinematography. This movie was easy to enjoy.  No serious criticisms about the movie since it was meant for pure entertainment.  Perhaps there were historical inaccuracies.....but its message was clear: One must not forget who they are, or where they come from.

Highlight was Lord Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), a samurai who envisioned a powerful animal while meditating.  His vision soon materializes following an encounter with Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) in battle.  Similarly, with Native tribes of the Americas, dreams or visions were also very powerful.  As their encounter develops into respect,  Algren becomes a student of Katsumoto's people with curious intrigue, he learns their philosophy, their way of life and a peacefulness that he referred to as a ""deep reservoir of spirit"".

Algren's flashbacks to his battle fought with Custer lends historical accuracy to an important part of U.S. history and occurs throughout the movie until his friendship with Katsumoto reaches a level of trust, respect, and compassion.  Samurai ALSO had to defend their way of life before total encroachment and defeat by Japan's imperial army, as portrayed. Enjoyable movie, wonderful Japanese cast: kudos to a fine actor, Ken Watanabe for putting self into his character that made me believe in Katsumoto, a man of integrity and honor.

2008031,3,B0001JXOVC,"Though set in Japan, ""The Last Samurai"" is an American film for American audiences.  Through emotionally scarred American cavalry office Nathan Algren, we are introduced to Japan's traditional (and completely mythical) samurai culture, supposedly threatened by the country's 19th century industrialization.  Traumatized by his role in the extermination of the Native Americans, Algren redeems himself by joining with surrogate Noble Savages, samurai warriors rebelling against the new modern Japan.

As far as it went, the film was enjoyable enough -- elaborately choreographed action and stunning (New Zealand) landscapes.  I need to remove one star for the painfully forced romance between Cruise and Koyuki.  Another goes for the ludicrous liberties the film takes with history.  Learning about the actual events after seeing this film, I was amazed by the way the filmmakers had completely and brazenly rewritten them.  Their attitude goes beyond carelessness or artistic reinterpretation to downright contempt for reality.

Essentially, ""The Last Samurai"" is pure fantasy that pretends to be historical.  Of course, there's nothing wrong with fantasy -- unless it tries to pass itself off as reality.  In reality, the 25,000-strong rebel army fought with modern weapons and tactics.  Indeed, their first actions were to raid government armories and steal as many guns and as much ammunition as they could, which didn't turn out to be enough.  Zwick's vision of sword-swinging, armor-wearing samurai is as absurd as having the Battle of Gettysburg fought out between lance-wielding knights in shining armor.  It would look pretty cool but be impossible to take seriously.

Perhaps this historical fantasy is the reason the film quite explicitly backs what was by any reasonable standard the wrong side in Japan's struggle over modernization.  It's odd, isn't it, that a film from a country that takes such pride in freedom and democracy should glorify an oppressive, xenophobic, militaristic, medieval caste system and demonize the people and forces that brought Japan such modern plagues as as political equality and universal education.  Indeed, Watanabe's character was the first to call for Japan to invade Korea and expand its Empire onto the Asian mainland, and the government's refusal to do so played a large part in his decision to join the rebels.

""The Last Samurai"", although it pretends to be historical, does its best to avoid unpleasant historical reality by focusing on an idealized myth of samurai bravery, dedication and willingness to die for their traditional (and fictional) way of life.  It does the same thing for premodern Japan as ""Gone with the Wind"" does for the slaveholding South -- invents an idyllic past and covers up all the unpleasant bits that might make one question the value of slavery or feudalism.

An odd thought struck me while watching the final glorious kamikaze charge: are the heroes of this film so different from the reactionary extremists of the modern day?  Will Hollywood in a few decades be putting out a film celebrating the bravery, dedication and traditional virtues of, say, the Taliban?  I would have immediately dismissed such thoughts as absurd before seeing ""The Last Samurai"".  Now, however, I cannot be so certain.",1140307200,9,3280,5.328155339805825
2008032,1,B0001JXOVC,"I thought the film itself was exellent.  Tom Cruise was very commendable is his role, and the action sequences were stunning.  Disregard my one star rating in that sense, and buy the film today!

My problem is the fact that there had to be an American in it at all.  Will a film flop if there isn't a white face on screen?  Being a big fan of ""The Seven Samurai"", I was in awe when I discovered that a modern film about samurai was hitting the big screen.

Why not have a British or Portuguese, or Dutch character (nations that all were thoroughly involved with Japan at the time) if there has to be a caucasian?

This just reflects the shallowness of American audiences, I'm afraid...

This film shows Cruise's maturation as a SERIOUS actor - finally!!  The other performances are also fantastic; the actors are obviously all serious, veteran actors. (They should have an Academy Award for ""Best Casting""; and this film should have won it.)

The film is often graphic (e.g., the final battle scene); but at other times extremely delicate, subtle and sublime (e.g., Cruise's scenes with the wife and children of the man whom he killed in battle). Often not a word is said - but the eyes, body movements, and lighting speak to us in soft tones.

The Japanese actress KOYUKI (who plays ""Taka"", widow of the warrior Cruise kills in battle near the beginning) is BOTH fantastically beautiful and a most subtle and superb actor.

2008036,3,B0001JXOVC,"I wasn't certain what to expect from ""The Last samurai"". The fact that Cruise and long time collaborator Paula Wagner co-produced this film made me wonder if this was just another action vehicle for Tom to flex his dramatic chops. Having seen the film I hav to say I was pleasantly surprised. Cruise shows he has grown as an actor although I must admit I still see Tom CRuise and not the character he is playing.

The plot has been decribed in other reviews so I need not elaborate here. what I will say is that the cinematography of this film was breathtaking. The scenes of rural Japan were gorgeous. I was particulalrly impressed with the recreation of the Japanese harbor circa 1876 with a bustling Japanese port and a majestic mount fuji looming in the distance.

The actors were all particularly great, especially Ken Watanabe who plays the rebelious(?)samurai Katsumoto. His presence on screen was commanding and his ability to be stern and understanding really worked. You cant help but feel for the inner turmoil his character endures.

Overall ""the last samurai"" was a fantastic film with great acting and some great imagery. I felt Algren's inner conflict could have been fleshed out more and we could have a better understanding of why Katsumoto's view of life was preferable to Algren than the viewpoint of the new Japanese government.

2008048,2,B0001JXOVC,"I've been a fan of Ken Watanabe for long time. And, my grand-grand-grand father was a samurai lord of a tiny land in the northern Japan. So I was looking forward to see the movie and was dissapointed very much.

First, amateurish battle scenes.

When I heard Katsumoto's model was Takamori Saigo, I expected 60,000 samurai swarming along the mountain ridge or several  castles filled with cannons and guns, and a series of cunning battle tactics in Sun Tzu style - that was what happened in Saigo's last battle. Very suitable to a Hollywood spectacular.

If Katsumoto was a commoner who imagined himself being a samurai like a Don Quixote, or a poor samurai without education in very far rural village, the story would be acceptable. But a trusted advisor of the emperor? No joke.

Second, failures of exploiting full beauty in samurai culture.

Usually, Ken Watanabe uses kimono very wisely to play a noble samurai role with a very elegant and dangerous atmosphere. In the TV series ""Zankuro"", Ken's role was an executioner and looked like a butterfly in fire. But in this movie, he couldn't show his talent because of very unnatural costume. He had to be in a 13th-century-style armor always (how foolish and tactless to fight in this muggy land). If the costume had been more realistic, the character of Katsumoto would be more complicated, sophisticated and attractive.

In addition, the most profound scene was nearly ignored. It was the fan dance by Hiroyuki Sanada before the last battle. This traditional dance is an essence of Bushido. They performed it only when the death was unevitable in the coming battle, to express their unshakable faith. I don't understand why the scene ended in a blink.

Finally, I'd like to add the plus side. The sets of old Yokohama city was excellent. Even Japanese movie staff cannot create them so accurately and beautifully.

In this movie, Hollywood proved they had capability to create a historical epic set in Japan.  I hope they wouldn't underestimate our history and culture any longer, and would show us a more breathtaking spectacular in the next movie.

A crucial moment in Japan's history, good action, lots of sincere drama. All these are just trimmings, they would have been enough to make the movie interesting but the movie is not an action, or historical drama, or adventure.

The movie is about that sad period of human history when individual values were sacrificed to obedience to orders, personal warrior skill and art replaced with cheap soldier ""cannon fodder"" mass, indiviudal honor and responsibility gave way to the power of human rabble.

It was easier to show on Japan's example but same thing gradually happened in Europe and US as well - it took longer so the change was less stunning, but no less dramatic.

First off, gorgeous scenary.  There is a scene with Tom Cruise practicing a sword kata with the sun setting in the background ... it's beautiful.  There are many wonderful scenes in the movie.

Secondly, the plot is about transformation and self forgiveness.  I don't care if it's been ""done before"", this is a common archetype in all cultures and times and it is well portrayed through this film.  I find it well done, quite emotionally gripping at times.

The action in this film is great, Star Wars eat your heart out.  I grew up in a traditional martial art family, and Tom Cruise did a very solid job with the sword play in this movie.  The star wars films drove me nuts, but maybe you don't need proper body mechanics when you have ""the force"".  Anyways, good work in the martial arena as well in this film.

Finally, I saw this film three times in theatres and everytime people cried.  Seriously.  Everytime the end came around at least one person both men & women cried.

From the code of Honor down to commiting Seppuku. Im not going to get into a brush of History on the Samurai, theres much too explain and learn about those fearsome Warriors.

  It should and definetly leaves the audience in awe about such a war and time when fuedal clans and government corruption brought femine that you would want to learn and research about these class of noble warriors on the web or at your local libary. The Samurai sword Katana has a whole long history in itself.

  But this movie defenitly brings out what the Samurai truly are and what they believed in and fought for, or as Mr. Grahm said it; ""HONOR"". To this day, I believe there is no other warriors who were or can be more dedicated or honorable than the samurai.

2008069,3,B0001JXOVC,"I was kinda disappointed at ""The Last Samurai"".  I was attracted to the idea of an American soldier, as played by Tom Cruise, and a group of samurai.  However, what I discovered was a carbon copy of other works by director Edward Zwick, plus a little ""Dances With Wolves"" on the side.

Let's see: Tom Cruise plays an outcast soldier who finds himself looking for redemption in the company of some samurai, who kidnap him while training some Japanese soldiers to fight against those samurai.  This is like Matthew Broderick, who plays a soldier and finds redemption by training and commanding a group of African-Americans in ""Glory"" -Zwick's best movie.  Also, it's similar to ""Legends Of The Fall"", where Brad Pitt plays a desertor from the Army during WWI and finds redemption with a group of indians.  So, in those Edward Zwick movies, we find outcast soldiers in Broderick, Pitt, and Cruise.  Ah, and let's not forget Kevin Costner, who also plays an outcast soldier who finds comfort with the Sioux in ""Dances With Wolves""; only Zwick didn't direct that movie, Costner did.

However, not all in ""The Last Samurai"" is negative.  I have to admit that I fell in love with LOTR's Ngila Dickson's costumes; the cinematography by, I think, by Caleb Deschanel is truly enchanting; Ken Watanabe's outstanding performance as samurai leader Katsumoto is electrifying and charming at the same time; and, more importantly, Hans Zimmer's eclectic and marvelous music score, which I consider a great guilty pleasure of mine.

In the end, I don't think ""The Last Samurai"" is a classic.  I just wished Edward Zwick had taken a different approach on a film that promised too much.",1128124800,,1667,4.896797153024911

The Last Samurai : The Life and Battles of Saigo Takamori, by Mark Ravina. The real history of the last stand of samurai.

The ideal we have today is rather the same as the ideal of the Authurian knights. I do admit, I really enjoyed the movie, but I wish sometimes history would be presented a little more often, rather than a story passed off as such.

2008096,4,B0001JXOVC,"The Last Samurai shows the viewer a look into the lifestyle of the the ancient ways of the Samurai during the 1800's. It is a world that was slowly dying out as more and more Japanese people turned to living in the Western traditions, and for one US Military Captain, it showed him a world he grew to respect and love.....

Tom Cruise stars as Nathan Algren, a captain sent to the foreign land of Japan to teach Japanese soldiers the way to fight as US troops do in America. The preparation is needed to stop a rebellion of Samurai warriors led by Katsumoto [played by Ken Watanabe] who have been attacking railroads and supply trains.

After being sent to the front lines with troops he believes aren't ready to fight yet, Algren is captured after a battle and is brought to the village of Katsumoto's brother in the mountains. Despite some harsh attempts of getting used to the lifestyle of the Samurai, Algren slowly but surely learns how to love the Samurai lifestyle and how they work day and night.

The movie shows us breath taking landscape shots of the mountains the Samurai live in. It even shows some great rain storm scenes as Algren attempts to prove himself by battling in a swordfight with one of the experienced Samurai and refuses to stay down no matter how many times he is knocked down.

This movie also comes with some great fighting style scenes. With the fog war near the beginning in which Algren is captured after his inexperience troops are cut down by the Samurai, to a Ninja attack on the Samurai village where the samurai sacrifice themselves to save Katsumoto, to even Algren siding with Katsumoto for the climactic battle in the end against his fellow officers.

This movie is great in so many ways: The vibrant color of the scenery, the style of fighting is smooth yet terrifying as lots of men die, and even the dialogue between Algren and Katsumoto is great as they have their ""Many Conversations.""

2008097,2,B0001JXOVC,"I'm a big fan a Japanese period movies.  In all those films, whether they are ""high"" art like Kurosawa's ""The Seven Samurai"" and ""Ran"", or ""low"" art like ""Lone Wolf and Cub"" or ""Zatoichi"", one of the prevailing themes is the inherent hypocrisy and injustice embedded in the feudal society of old Japan.  How the characters manage to get by in this oppressive society is almost always a source, if not the primary source, of the drama in the story line.  Japanese filmakers know this.  They know that ancient Japan, while admirable in many respects, was not a eutopia by any stretch of the imagination.  Women were property.  Peasants were considered sub-human.  If you were born into a certain class you remained in that class until you died.

In ""The Last Samurai"", all these realities are ignored, if not downplayed.  Here the Samurai are portrayed as nothing but completely noble and honorable, innocent victims who merely want to preserve their perfect society.  The Japanese who want to bring Japan into the modern world are all portrayed as corrupt and self-serving, who have no respect for their own cultural heritage.

This is the typical hollywood movie; dumbed down for consumption by an audience that that the filmakers assume is too dumb to understand nuance.

If you want to learn something about Japan and be entertained at the same time, I would recommend the ""Shogun"" mini-series, which gives a much more balanced view, or check out some of the films I mentioned in the first paragraph.",1123286400,6,1502,4.8700787401574805

2008099,2,B0001JXOVC,"As someone who loves period pieces and really anything that explores history, I'm always excited about a director who tries to follow the direction that classic directors such as David Lean made famous. When Edward Zwick made ""Glory"" in 1989, I thought it was the start of a career that would bring us many fantastic films. Looking back, while I still consider ""Glory"" one of the best modern-day historical pieces in cinema, I realize that I probably overrated it and an accurate production design, a top notch score, and superb performances by actors who were relatively unknown at the time such as Denzell Washington and Morgan Freeman probably boosted it more than anything.  I write this because Edward Zwick has continued to go downhill since the days of ""Glory.""  He knows his history and always gives us great sets and a period feel, as well as talented actors to bring out the characters, but something is lacking.  ""Legends of the Fall,"" ""Courage Under Fire,"" and ""The Last Samurai"" were all great exhibitions in beautiful scenery and famous periods and places in history, but something is missing.  Zwick feels like the Michael Bay of historical pieces.  The man does have some talent and sure does make a pretty picture, but when you take into account the screenplay, the characters, the ending... it all seems hollow.  This movie starts out promising but ends up as a mediocre film, in part because it is too long considering the material.  There's nothing wrong with a three-hour movie, but make sure the screenplay deserves that amount of time!  It reminds me of ""The Patriot,"" another historical piece that looked so promising but just didn't deliver.  ""The Last Samurai"" was probably the most disappointing film by Zwick yet and I think I've officially given up on the hopes that he would improve and one day give us a ""Braveheart"" or ""The Bridge on the River Kwai.""",1122595200,2,1882,4.85625

First, it is very difficult for me to believe that the Japanese widow would fall in love with the coarse, smelly, and (worst of all) foreign soldier who had killed her husband. Why love?? Could she not simply have respected him for his steadfast efforts toward reconciliation and his willingness to turn against his own countrymen on her (and her people's) behalf? When otherwise credible story lines start creating unlikely plot twists, especially near the conclusion of the movie, it is time to prepare for that most dreaded of all literary constructions: the ""Hollywood ending"".

Which brings up my second point: I felt that the obviously ""tacked on"" (but predictable...see point one) ""happy ending"" was an insult to all events which preceded it. Out of the ENTIRE Samurai army, guess the identity of the single survivor of the this epic and heroic ""battle to the death"". Tell me this doesn't strain credibility beyond the breaking point. That the (heretofore gutless) Japanese emperor suddenly develops a spine and does the ""right thing"" when confronted by this (unnamed) survivor only further accentuates the absurdity of it all. It is a slap in the face.

The ending was a cop out, and the movie would have been infinitely better if it had ended about 15 minutes sooner, on the battlefield and in a much more final and plausible way. I guess the title would have to be altered, but this might not be a bad thing due to the ambiguity about to whom it refers.

I still recommend this movie for all of the substantial and compelling positive reasons cited above, but see if you don't share, or at least acknowledge, the basis for my criticism after you have watched it.",1121817600,3,1938,4.88145896656535

This movie is about samurai so expect alot of blood and gore.but it still has some good dramatic content to keep you glued to the screen till the end.

Basically if want a good story with lots of beatiful scenes and lots of action then watch this film.but if you watch this film like a movie critique looking for small bits to critique then I am afraid no movie will satisfy you.--because if people can critisize such a nice movie what about the ones which really need help????(i do admit there are some which are extremely disappointing but this one is not one of them)--enjoy this movie!!!",1120608000,3,1527,4.711610486891386
2008104,4,B0001JXOVC,Tom Cruise stars in this wildly entertaining prequel to Nick Castle's THE LAST STARFIGHTER.  Miss this and you'll be searching for a sword to fall on.,1119830400,,150,4.769230769230769
2008115,4,B0001JXOVC,"This epic film demonstrates that the technical competency of modern American filmmakers is complete.  But we already knew that, didn't we.

However, in addition to technical virtuosity, there is undeniably artistic merit here.  In my mind the most artistic and therefore most interesting scene in the film is when Algren (Cruise) disembarks at Yokohama.  The lavish and loving care that obviously went into the creation of this time-piece set is impressive.  One could watch this scene over and over again, seeking new details each time, and enjoy the pastime.

Further artistic inspiration comes from the natural settings provided by New Zealand, and in particular the composite cone of volcano Taranaki, standing in admirably for Fujiyama.  The geology of New Zealand is similar enough to Japan that this setting comes off very well in the story telling.  Also, kudos to the carpenters and design team who created the structures; this is really good stuff.

Also in the positive column is the costumery, especially the Samurai armor.  All visual aspects of this film are superb.

And so is the story line; there is much here to engage the imagination.

This is withal a very good film, but with such elements described above going for it, it could have been a timeless classic of the filmmaker's art.  I acknowledge I may be far off the mark, but it seems to me these modern American filmmakers miss the mark time and again when it comes to where they ought to concentrate their efforts and imaginations, hence my accusation of this being a ""formulaic"" epic.

These days a grandiose and expensively produced climactic battle is de rigueur, but why is this so?  Who decided this?  If you stop to think about it, is such extravagance necessary to tell this story?  In my opinion: no.  Is it necessary to make this film a financial success?  Again, in my opinion: no.  The short list of films I've seen that have ripped my guts out with the intensity of their message have included not a single violent act, which is not to say some violence is never useful in telling a story, but it can almost  always be suggested, instead of graphically portrayed.  For me, these battle scenes are boring.  I submit the correct formula for great story telling is to make such scenes brief interludes, then get back to the human drama, which hopefully will include some inspiring dialogue.

At one point Algren muses: ""I am beset by the ironies of my life.""  Now here could be the beginning of something interesting, but this thought is not developed, and this nicely structured phrase is allowed to just drop.

The heart of this story is the historical nexus of a medieval society attempting to catch up with the recently industrialized West, the dubious wisdom of doing so, and what might be left behind in so doing.  The human drama inherent in such events is truly the stuff of epic tales.  So why are these human dramas developed only briefly, and so much time and effort invested in fights and battles?  Clearly the producers think this is necessary for financial success.  It is not clear they are right about this.

Other formulaic elements seem intended to add depth to the story, but accomplish the reverse.  We have the frontier cavalry as depraved and bad, and American Indians as noble and good.  We have the hatred of the heroically defiant and rebellious member of the frontier cavalry (whom we are prompted to love because he is so wise to be so rebellious; an island of wisdom in a sea of decadence) for his supposedly archetypal superior, with a result that will come as a complete surprise to all viewers who were born, so to speak, yesterday.

I admit I'm nitpicking here, but Taka, played by Koyuki, looks like the modern model she is.  She is as lovely as can be, but an actress of her physical stature must surely have been selected to cater to modern tastes (as decided by casting); a more typically diminutive Japanese actress would have been more convincing.

So, my recommendation is to watch this movie because it has very considerable merit, but my question is: who decided modern American moviegoers are primarily induced to pay money to see gory battle scenes and care little about complex human interaction?  I think they got it backwards, and don't seem about to budge.",1119225600,3,4287,4.783673469387755

2008117,5,B0001JXOVC,"Tom Cruise and Edward Zwick set out to make a film that had great spiritual depth, using the samurai ""bushido"" code as the foundation for understanding the culture of the samurai warriors.

I found myself watching, in my opinion, a great, spiritual film about a Civil War veteran who has lost himself in guilt and shame for actions done during the Indian campaigns.  He goes to Japan to train the ""new"" soldier, and quickly finds himself the captive the samurai.  A reluctant captive at first, he slowly begins to find himself in the disciplines and codes of these magnificent warriors.

Viewers may find some parallels to Dances With Wolves.  This film, in some ways, goes deeper.  One must go deep to truly understand the way of the samurai; brilliant warriors whose job it was to protect and defend.

Those familiar with Star Wars will see how and why George Lucas used the samurai as inspiration for his Jedi.

The word ""Samurai"" means to serve.  The Bushido code is not just a code of action.  It is a code of BEING.  The samurai demonstrated themselves by being loyal, being compassionate, being honest, etc.  This is a way to live, not only in the past, but more importantly, for today when such concepts are becoming more and more obscure.

I thought Tom Cruise did a very good job (although I find myself wondering how much better this film would have been if someone like, Daniel Day-Lewis played the part).  Nathan Algren is taught to face his fears, to put the past behind him, to live and BE in the moment (this he employs during his sword training and first battle in the street).

I will also argue that this film has the best ""love"" scene of any movie I've ever seen.  The subtlety and feeling that emerges as Taka is dressing Nathan in his garments, preparing him for battle, is one of the most poignant love scenes I've ever had the pleasure to see on screen.

One may argue that the samurai were the villains.  They stood in the way of progress.  They tried to ""hold back"" the tide of modernizing Japan.

I find it extremely interesting the most people believe that those who came before us had to have been more primitive.  Scientists and historians alike are quickly finding out that this is not always true...in fact, it seldom is.

The Japanese Emperor sums up the words beautifully: ""...we must not forget who we are and where we came from.""  The ""old"" should never be cast aside for the ""new,"" but transcended...to take those qualities from the past and assimilate them into the future.

This is a great story, and I feel that the Last Samurai speaks volumes to the way of the warrior and to the way of being.",1118275200,7,2634,4.567164179104478
2008118,3,B0001JXOVC,"I think it's fair to assume that the majority of Tom Cruise's fans aren't particularly interested in Samurai movies--and the majority of Samurai movie fans aren't too interested in Tom Cruise.  Personally, I avoided this movie for quite a while because of Cruise in the leading role.  To my surprise-his performance was credible--though there are a few absurd moments-such as an early battle scene where Cruise is fighting off a half dozen or so Samurai single handed (though he does get wounded)  As someone who's lived in Japam twice--I was also amazed by how easily Cruise's character picked up Japanese!

Nit picking aside-I enjoyed this movie--except for the ending which was about as lame as anything imaginable.  IMO--this movie would have been better if it had ended with the climatic scene at the end of the Samurai attack--where it appears all the Samurai are dead or dying--Cruise included.  If it had ended here-I would have rated the move 4 stars--but the ""epilogue"" was a disaster!  Still--if you're like me and have a problem with Tom Cruise as a ""Samurai""--give it a try--the story is enjoyable and entertaining.

Yes, there are battles with blood spilled all over but this is accessory to the plot. The story is what appealed to me. The old Japan is lost and it is a shame. This revives it and exposes people to the Japanese culture. Being able to turn back the clock and achieve this level of realism and show the lost pride of the Japanese is an  amazing feat. Of course there is a touch of Hollywood but that's ok. Cruise is at his best in this movie surrounded by talented Japanese actors.

2008120,5,B0001JXOVC,"When it first came out, i had no interest as i felt after learning of the story, that while tom cruise is a good action film actor, he didn't possess the depth of skill to pull off a film of this nature.

After catching pieces of it on cable, i decided to make an effort and watch it from beginning to end, and did so a second time.  I then bought it and watched it  again.  I became immersed in it more deeply each time, realizing that there is a great deal of subtlety and depth not obtainable from an initial viewing.  From the strength of the superb supporting characters, to the gradual changing of cruise's character, and the details of the time re-created so credibly by the filmmakers, this was an excellent film of substance, not traditionally done by hollywood.

While i have seen Dances with wolves, as others have complained about the lack of originality of the storyline, i feel that not to be completely accurate.  I also feel cruise's portrayal was more convincing than Costner's, and that this film is of equal power and effectiveness.  There are, like all films, weaknesses, such as the lack of exploration of the samurai's rejection of modernity, (a deleted scene on disc 2 touches upon this), and the dialogue can be a bit lacking, such as the exchange between katsumoto and the emperor as to how the situation should be handled, these are minor in the grand epic that is the last samurai.  Watch it with an open mind, and scrutinize the background/secondary characters, all of whom - especially ujio - were excellent.  And imho, it was a better picture than Return of the king, but than again, hollywood picked Titanic over LA Confidential for best picture, so who said hollywood is a place for the intelligent?",1116979200,5,1731,4.627450980392157
2008121,3,B0001JXOVC,"""The Last Samurai"" is a story about a Civil War veteran who goes over to Japan to fight the last pocket of Samurai; he is taken captive by the Samurai, but eventually learns to respect this dying culture and adapt to their way of life.

WHAT WORKS: The movie is beautiful to look at; the cinemtography is magnificent. The story is generally engrossing and it's great to envision how the Samurai may have really lived in Japan hundreds of years ago. Speaking of which, the costumes and sets are outstanding, no doubt about it.

WHAT DOESN'T WORK: I enjoyed the movie, I did, but the plot is obviously taken from ""Dances With Wolves,"" a very superior film. One could also cite ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""Last of the Dogmen"" as films with similar plots. (Although ""Dogmen"" is basically a rip-off of ""Dances With Wolves,"" the story takes place in the modern world, so it definitely possesses its own uniqueness). The scene in ""Samurai"" where the Samurai make their first dramatic appearance is obviously ripped-off straight from a similar scene in ""Dogmen"" wherein the Indians make their first appearance (compare the two scenes for verification).

The score in the film is certainly serviceable but parts of it painfully sound like a watered-down variation of the fabulous score from ""The Last of the Mohicans.""

BOTTOM LINE: Although ""The Last Samurai"" could be subtitled ""Dances with the Last Dogmen of Arabia,"" it's still quite enjoyable. People who have not seen these other four movies that so-obviously influenced ""Samurai"" will likely rate ""The Last Samurai"" higher than I have. If you really like this film and haven't seen these other movies I've mentioned, I encourage you to pick 'em up ASAP -- especially ""The Last of the Mohicans"" and ""Dances With Wolves,"" which are two of the best movies ever filmed, period.",1115596800,2,1819,4.896103896103896

Meanwhile (speaking of beholding....), this is a first class movie.  One of the all too rare ""blockbusters"" that transcends the cliche.  The movie quite sensitively depicts both the clash of East and West and their reconciliation whilst ultimately telling the story of the End of Things, the destruction of a Way of Life.

It is a one of those very rare not-to-be-missed movies.",1115424000,4,643,4.853211009174312
2008123,2,B0001JXOVC,"As most of the previous reviewers pointed out, the imaginary in this film is good and often beautiful. The story line is quite fantastic and somewhat loosely based on historical events, but it does work as a simple adventure film.

  I am surprised that Tom Cruise could make such a film though. One of the main characters is in this film Katsumoto, is based the historical figure on Saigo Takamori. Katsumoto (Saigo Takamori) is depicted as a very moral and even kind warrior who remains loyal to the way of the Samurai, which of course is shown as pure and moral and completely opposed to the materialistic nasty West. At the end of the film he's depicted as a tragic hero who dies a noble death and teaches Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) all about honor and loyalty.

  The film makes no mention of Saigo Takamori's political ideas, which included Japan becoming an imperial power and invading Korea. A later generation of Japanese leaders took this man to be a tragic hero and followed through on his ideas and used his thoughts as a justification and road map for Japanese foreign policy. The result was the invasion of Korea, China, Vietnam, Thailand, and other events, such as the ""comfort girls"" and the Rape of Nanking, where an estimated 400,000 Chinese civilians were slaughtered and some 80,000 women and girls were raped. Saigo Takamori is not responsible for these events, but he advocated such a course for Japan and his successors followed through, often citing his writings. Additionally, unlike his depiction in the film, Saigo Takamori was not against modern weaponry, he thought it a vast improvement over swords and traditional weapons. He also saw how useful they could be in invading other countries. I find it odd that a Hollywood liberal like Tom Cruise could glorify anyone with Takamori's ideas. It's especially ironic that Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is shown having nightmares due to his guilt at having slaughtered Native Americans. Then the film then glorifies someone who advocated Japan doing something quite similar in other Asian countries.

Maybe in his next film could show some ""traditional way of the Aryan"" Hitler Youth boldy invading Poland? yuk yuk.... Tom Cruise and the makers of this film would do well to read ""The Rape of Nanking"" by Iris Chang and think a little more about who they chose to glorify.",1115251200,9,2359,4.8825

And all his Western battle strategies fail, so some of the Samurais want to kill him but there's this one well-respected Japanese Samurai who teaches him to be Japanese, houses him, clothes him, and treats him like a brother.

So in a heat of battle when Tom can't hold his own against the enemy the Japanese Samurai has to step in to save Tom's life thus showing him who's the real deal.

This samurai also gets all the Japanese women and they all hate Tom and treat him like the foreign freak that he is so he's lonely and ends up with Penelope Cruz, who happens to be a missionary teaching the Japanese about Christianity.

But then Tom finds out that Penelope actually loves the Japanese Samurai who saved his life and is just being friendly to Tom out of pity.

Tom is angry about this because he can't get any from the Japanese women or Penelope so he turns against this Japanese Samurai who helped him out through thick and thin and challenges him to a sword duel.

So in the sword duel, the Japanese Samurai out duels him but since the Japanese Samurai isn't a killing freak, he stops short of killing him and gives him the ultimatum to leave Japan.

So wounded, Tom limps towards a boat, then you see him mutter, ""Friggin' Japs...."" turn around and shoots the good caring Japanese Samurai in the shoulder!

Unfazed, the Japanese samurai gets back up and charges towards Tom with his sword as Tom is frantically trying to reload his gun to light the fuse to take a second shot at the samurai. Just as Tom is about to point the gun in the Japanese samurai's face to blow it off, the Japanese Samurai slices the gun in half (fantastic symbolism of Eastern culture defeating evil Western culture) and delivers the deathblow!

if only tom cruises character in this film could be,

Its a good film.  But a few things really grate,

1.  Cheapening of martial arts

learning the art of the sword and unarmed combat in 3 months vs someone whose spent their life with it and he can draw that man in 3 months plz.

wow the actor spent 8 months learning martial arts for this movie, he must be REALLY good in 8 months, like thats almost a year of training in martial arts, sword and unarmed combat.

Silly me it only took me 10 years to study unarmed combat, im living in japan, and i still couldn't take on 5 people with swords. I must just be so stupid.

Fact: guns kill people far more effectively than swords. It doesnt matter how much philosophy and dedication to training as soon as guns came around swords and unarmed combat took second place.

3 months film time 8 months real time does not make tom cruise or his character a ninja capable of taking on 5 trained armed assasins, he being unarmed because he lost his revolver and didn't notice...yeah right.  That scene from Indiana jones comes to mind, sword guy meet revolver.

2. Blatantly ripping off other films,

19th century soldier with deathwish goes native and fights for the other side, man leading horse into pasture at the end, oh plz, and savage warriors charging a disciplined army, cough cough braveheart cough.

3.  The man charges a row of gattling guns,um hello? people don't get up and act heroic after that. They just die, Thats the point, it was the pivotal machine for empire making of the late 19th century to early 20th.

4.  Billy Connolly u cant do irish u might think u can but really u cant just play it real and scottish.

Or is this a historical epic that throws some light on a hidden apsect of the U.S-Japanese relations? My view veers toward the former as all I was left with after having see the film is this feeling: Haven't I seen this before? In a word, what's the difference between Dance With Wolves and this one? Seen as a historical epic, this is positively bad. How those fully armoured warriors could exist in the mid nineteenth century Japan is anyone's guess, not to mention the Ninjya. Isn't this familiar? There was something of a vogue for things Japanese in the 80s when Miyamoto Musashi's Book of Five Rings was a big hit. Well, there were a bunch of Japan bashers too, given the economic imbalance that existed between the two countries back then. Things probably look a bit different now as Japan is positively seen as a U.S. ally or a partner in crime, depending on how you look at it, as the U.S. vows to dust all ""bad"" regimes off the face of the planet.

Watanabe also has a breakthrough role, in which he is part of a group of legendary samurai warriors. This movie is a burrito of action, suspense, and drama all rolled up into one.

2008150,4,B0001JXOVC,"Most people in North America don't know who the Japanese Director Akira Kurosawa is.  Nor do they know much about the Samurai. Many of Hollywood's most recognized filmmakers have been deeply influenced by the Japanese director including, but not limited to, George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese and John Woo. Most of Akira's films were about the Samurai and the complex warrior ethos that drove the development of some very meaningful and artistic storylines.

I think this movie is a very good introduction to the everyday North American (i.e. white) audience of the Samurai and their warrior culture. There are some things that a Western audience may find difficult to understand or accept, an example being the wife of a fallen Samurai who tends to the wounds of her husband's killer. This is hard for a Western audience to understand, but in a traditional Asian culture, if your parents are dead, then your older brother becomes the moral equivalent of your father and you do what he says, no arguments. Not PC I know, but that was reality back then. Plus, I think the wife knew enough about war, being raised in a Samurai tradition, to know that there was nothing personal in what Algren did.

To make a movie with wide appeal, Zwick had to dilute the Japanese culture for wider consumption, kind of like the ""green"" bottle top soy sauce that's less salty then regular  ""red"" bottle top soy sauce. However, this had too much of a ""crowd pleaser"" kind of effect on me, as I wanted to learn more about the Japanese culture at that important time in their history. The makers (and financiers) of this movie decided to entertain first and educate later. However, at least people will get something out of this, instead of just gawking at the natives.

I'm not seeing any more new movies until I see more of the great old ones.  I recently saw Paths of Glory with Kirk Douglas/directed by Stanley Kubrick.

2008152,5,B0001JXOVC,"The Last Samurai is a beautiful film, the kind of epic that David Lean might have made.  The film is true to historical events that happened in Japan during 1876-77.  In particular, meticulous care was taken with the recreation of Tokyo and the clothing that was being worn, traditional Japanese and modern clothing. The clash of tradition versus the influence of the West is sharply portrayed in these contrasts. Like all historical epics, departures and simplifications of the truth have to be made for the sake of a coherent film.  Certainly, there were no Americans fighting along with the samurai but the character of Captain Algren allows us to explore what is going on in Japan from the traditional and modernistic points of view.  What makes The Last Samurai an excellent historical film is what also makes for a great historical novel: sticking close to historical facts, knowing the details of the society your characters are living in and developing a believable and interesting story.  The story of The Last Samurai fulfills all of this for me.

Edward Zwick has captured some excellent performances.  Tom Cruise as Captain Algren has a truly memorable performance, one that he trained for several months to deliver.  I must confess that I was not a early fan of Tom Cruise but his work in recent years has been impressive and in this film he truly becomes the character he is portraying. Ken Watanabe is wonderful as Kasumoto, loosely based on the life of Saigo Takamori, capturing the essence of the duty of a samurai and also the contemplative side of a warrior.  The talk of his writing a poem on a blossom reminded me that prior to the real battle depicted in the film the warriors spent the night before engaged in writing poetry.  The performances by the supporting cast are excellent.  Of special note is Koyuki (playing Taka, Kasumoto's sister) who must care for the man who killed her husband and who gradually finds herself falling in love.  Her sensitive performance is one of the highlights of the film.  Shin Koyamada, who plays Kasumoto's son Nobutada, brings pathos to his character, particularly in the scene where he is humiliated by Japanese soldiers for being dressed as a samurai.

The battle sequences were carefully stage with an eye for authenticity and the village where Algren is kept a prisoner was so meticulously constructed that the Japanese extras were struck by its resemblance to the villages where they grew up.

The cinematography is very impressive and the music by Hans Zimmer beautifully builds the mood.  The DVD has some wonderful supplemental pieces that explain various aspects of the production of the film.

2008154,5,B0001JXOVC,"Set in 1870's Japan, `The Last Samurai' is the story Japan's struggle to come to terms with the modern world whilst at the same time embracing its traditional past.

Tom Cruise gives a surprisingly good performance as the tormented Nathan Algren, a former captain of the US army who is having trouble with his conscience, unusual in a white man in the 19th century but he is haunted by his past, a past which saw him play a role in the slaughter of innocent Native American men, women and children in his own country.

Algren eventually agrees to go to Japan to help train its soldiers in the ways of modern warfare so that the nation's leaders can take on and destroy the sole remnants of the Samurai forces that are still clinging to the old ways.  Algren takes on this task for money and no other reason, he does not care about anything or anyone, death is no longer something he fears and it is partly this lack of fear that saves his life when he is captured by the `enemy,' who take him to their camp and inadvertently bring him spiritually closer to the way of the Samurai.

Algren slowly falls under the spell of the Samurai Code of Honour and he eventually switches his allegiance in battle, ending up fighting with the Samurai against the people he was brought over to train.

He forges a tenuous relationship with Taka, the widow of the man he killed in battle, and becomes a father figure to her two young sons and wins the grudging respect of the Samurai sword trainer who tries to break his spirit and his bones.

The film does to a certain extent become a study in redemption as Algren strives to find his place in the scheme of things and to erase the guilt of his dishonourable past actions.  Eventually though Algren comes to realise he cannot erase the past, he can either live with it or let it crush him.

He chooses to live but only as a Samurai, and that could mean his death at any given moment.

The whole film was a vibrant, violent, passionate look into a past that Japan has never been able to reclaim since the days of the Samurai.  With the western world on the doorstep trying to force their way in, Japan had to let go of some of her ancient traditions to survive and in doing so lost a big part of herself.

The Last Samurai has been accused of being too much on the side of the Samurai, but I think it manages to find a kind of balance, with both good and bad on both sides, and the over all film certainly deserves the five stars I am giving it.

Cruise does well not to fluff the Japanese language too much in the movie, I liked that they used subtitles, it gave the movie considerable authenticity, and the fight scenes as gory as they were, were breathtaking to watch, along with a fabulous musical score and scenery that I can't even do justice to in this critique.

A movie I will be watching again I think, because you cannot honestly take everything in, in just one viewing.

By far one of the best movies to come out of 2003 in my opinion.",1111795200,2,2982,4.32078853046595

Therefore I avoided it, every single time it came on cable I would change the channel scoffing at its very existence. Then with a bout of insomnia I stayed up late and caught the first half...I was hooked there after. I enjoyed the development of the relationship between Mr Cruise and Mr Watanabe's characters and by far Mr Watanabe was the better actor, a shame that his skill was not recognized. It is a story of growth and acceptance in the face of overwhelming odds.

The Last Samurai borrows very heavily from A Man Called Horse (with a hefty dash of Dances With Wolves, Soldier Blue and Braveheart).

Tom Cruise gives us a pretty damn good depiction of the tortured, alcoholic civil war veteran Nathan Algren, exorcising the demons of wartime atrocities by going to Japan to ply his trade, but, once the initial battle is complete and he is taken prisoner by Katsumoto's (Watanabe) luddite army, the constraints of a very limited and predictable storyline become apparent.

It is no surprise that Cruise falls for the widow who tends him, nor that he (in remarbly short time) learns to speak Japanese and fight in the manner of the Samurai.

The battle sequences are undeniably spectacular, and the sets, costumes and audio are always first rate. I very much enjoyed Timothy Spall's support role, and Watanabe was convincingly stoic. No surprises though. No sense of wonder. No sense of danger.

You could certainly do a lot worse than to immerse yourself in this beautiful but undemanding epic for a couple of hours - but don't expect too much.",1108684800,2,1246,4.914285714285715

Of course I happen to be partial to these kinds of stories and I have a great fondness for the Japanese variants of same. Still I didn't expect to enjoy this hybrid eastern-western that reworked Japanese history in order to put a dissolute and despondent American war hero (who's tortured by what he did in the Indian wars that followed on the Civil War) into the era of Japanese modernization. Tom Cruise always seems to me to be too cuddly to play such roles and yet I thought he pulled this one off. The story held together and was absorbing if somewhat predictable while Cruise actually proved to be a somewhat convincing American dissolute. That he takes to the Samurai lifestyle and weapons handling practices so readily is a bit hard to believe though the film does a good job of dragging out the learning process enough so that it doesn't look too precipitous. Of course, the American is only with his captors for a few months so it's a little hard to accept that he manages to become expert in Japanese swordsmanship in so short a span. But the film makes it look convincing and that's usually enough in this kind of thing. The battle scenes are also nicely done and the Samurai lord, Katsuomoto, who captures and ultimately befriends the American Algren is powerfully portrayed. Although there was little that was unexpected, Katsoumoto's escape from his enemies at the emperor's court was probably the high point and the least predictable in the film's repertoire of scenes. I'd see this one again for its ambience and tight storytelling, even if it didn't ultimately swallow me up, which, on my view, is the true measure of a great film.

Custer that he has to constantly drink in order to forget the extremely painful memories.  Unable to keep a job, he decides to accept an offer from a Japanese noble-man.  Along with a few other military officers, including his old Colonel (Tony Goldwyn), whom Algren detests for ordering him to carry out viscious orders, and Algren's friend Zebulon Gant (Billy Connolly), he will travel to Japan to train the imperial army in modern warfare.  Japan is trying to modernize after centuries of isolationism, and there is a rebellion led by the Samurai, who believe that by modernizing, Japan is losing its sense of self.  The Samurai, led by Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), will do everything they can to protect the traditional Japanese values.

After the first battle, the poorly trained Imperial Army is massacred by the disciplined Samurai warriors, and Algren is the only soldier able to actually defend himself.  Sensing his strength, Katsumoto has him taken alive in order to be studied.  While in Katsumoto's village, Algren begins to discover many admirable qualities of the Samurai, including their discipline, their loyalty, and most importantly for Algren, their serenity.

This was a great film; it dealt with loyalty, moral ambiguity, and courage.  The story, while somewhat predictable, was a good one to tell.  However, this story probably is not very accurate, but that can be overlooked.

Some people who watched the film may be surprised by this, simply because of couse if it stars Tom Cruise he must be the title character, right? Nope, not in this film, and that's the only thing that made it bearable for me. The word Samuri had, at the time in history that the movie takes place, a very specific definition. The last Samuri is the man Tom Cruise's character is captured by, whom he develops a respect for and odd sort of captor-captive friendship with.

There are battle scenes and fights aplenty for the action driven, a forbidden and unspoken atraction, and gorgeous scenery caught by the camera in lovely detail. Most people will actually like this movie, weather you like Cruise or not (I'm a ""not"" myself).

It's a story told from the perspective of a westerner in Japan. The British are everywhere, in everybody's buisness, and their empire has not yet fallen; guns are new to Japan despite the presense of gunpowder for quite a long time. Wars are changing, fought not by sword and arrow but by cannon and ranked soldiers.  Cruise is a drunk American soldier fresh from the Indian wars, shellshocked and consumed by memory. He's hired to teach raw Japanese recruits to fight. There's not enough time, and the first battle is a disaster. Cruise is caught, and the story begins...",1105574400,,1358,4.697478991596639
2008174,3,B0001JXOVC,"Tom Cruise appears in yet another film where he rises to the occassion at just the right time, as he has done in many of his previous films, dating back to Top Gun.  It a repetitive, tiresome theme that would have me looking for another role if I were him.  Don't get me wrong; I like some of his work (Far and Away is one of his best works to date).

As for this film, the cinematography and supporting actor roles are it's primary attraction.  It's apparent a lot of research was done to pull off this period piece.  The settings and costumes are beautiful.  Watanabe plays superbly as the Samurai warrior Katsumoto.  He is the real star of this movie.

Unfortunately, the plot is entirely predictable.  Cruise is an alcoholic fromer Union Captain named Nathan Algren.  He is sent to Japan to train the new Japanese Imperial Army to fight off the diminishing Samurai warriors.  He leads his Army into battle against the Samurai and is soundly beaten.  Katsumoto spares Algren's life and brings him back to health (queue the music).  Algren learns the way of the Samurai warrior and earns the respect of his Samurai brethren.  Eventually he has to face the very Japanese Army he helped train, this time fighting on the side of the Samurai.

This is where it goes from unlikely to absurd.  Cruise and hundreds of remaining Samurai face off with the Imperial Army in a showdown copied several times over since Mel Gibson's Braveheart.  Samurai drop like flies as they charge the inexperienced but better equipped Imperial Army soldiers.  As it turns out (no surprise here), Watanabe and Cruise are the last survivors of the battle.  Though severely wounded by gunfire,  Katsumoto squeezes his abdomen tightly to allow a few more pints of blood to nourish his brain while he performs his farewell speech to Cruise.  He dies and leaves Cruise as.....you guessed it!  The Last Samurai.  I heard that Japanese movie audiences were passing out at the very sight.

On a side note, it's rumored that Nathan Algren returned to America and travelled together with Kung Fu through the desert southwest, metting out some pain to those who crossed them.  Unfortunately, Algren returned to the bottle, and in a drunken rage one friday nite, eviscerated Kung Fu at a bar in Tucumcari.  Ironically, Algren died shortly thereafter while drinking numerous Grasshoppers.  He lies in an unmarked grave just outside of Ft. Sumner, New Mexico.",1105488000,5,2421,4.813106796116505

It made me realize that sometimes things have to change but one cannot give up their past because it defines who they are. All the actors did a great job in my opinion.

2008188,4,B0001JXOVC,"I know what you're thinking: Another simple Tom Cruise character in a simple plot. Yes, at first glance the film isn't promising. The plot, although based on some real events, is clichd struggle by a small band against overwhelming odds. After the first glance the outlook brightens, the Cruise character, Nathan Algren, doesn't lead the small band or even effect course of the action much. The result is a Tom Cruise film that doesn't revolve around Tom Cruise and in which Cruise does some genuine acting.

One reason Cruise fairs so well is Algren, traumatized and haunted, doesn't have the usual cocky bluster that Cruise relies on so much. The end result is not a stellar performance but may be one of his better ones. Additionally Cruise isn't the real star here, the rest of the mostly Japanese cast is. The Japanese cast are veteran actors but unknown outside of Japan. The cinematography also really stands out. Beautiful outdoor settings in both Japan and New Zealand where shot with care. The music is mix of John Williams-type orchestral arraignments with a Japanese influence.

The lack of real antagonist is the one major flaw. Enlisted to stand in for one, are several characters proposing to change Japan into a more modern country similar to the US and Europe, but this is never developed well so it seems the small band of Samari are fighting against, well, something. This contrasts with the real events with a real effort to push the Samari out of their powerful influence in feudal Japan. Since this the conflict is mostly neglected the movie is forced the point out the differences in not-too-subtle ways even giving one central character an 'evil guy' goatee.

The Director's Commentary track is good and serviceable but it's just that, the Director's Commentary. Alone the director covers as many topics as possible but the track isn't as broad as commentaries that include other crew members with other specialties. There also isn't any discussion that can make some commentaries so enjoyable. The other special features are a disappointment. Several of the 'documentaries' consist of Cruise and/or the director talking about how great the movie is. The two technical features about wardrobe and weapons are ridiculously short at about five minutes each.

And the overwhelming odds plot? That can end in only one of two ways: The small band manages to win or is wiped out out to the last man.  While you'll have to see for yourself which way this film ends, it does have more going for it than a clichd plot.",1104796800,3,2533,4.881395348837209

Oh yeah! They kick butt in this movie!

Tom Cruise is a very crappy actor these days but I think this has been his best performance in a long time. He plays a Union soldier who slaughtered Native Americans and has flashbacks of the war with the Indians.

Well, he's asked to go to Japan and help train Japnese soldiers to erase their history of the Samurai, and in again Tom Cruise is faced with the same situation as the weak Japanese military he's helping to create has a mission to wipe the Samurai at the request of the emperor.

The story is simple.

Tom Cruise goes to battle with the soldiers he has trained who haven't had really much training, kills a Samurai in battle, gets captured, is held hostage, and his captors treat him as a guest in their village. He is nursed back to health after a battle wound by the family of the man he killed and he goes through several flashbacks of the battles with Native Americans he seems to wonder if it was the right thing or not. He conquers his alcohol addiction and learns the way of the Samurai warrior.

This tale is very touching because of the Zen way of life the Samurai have. He killed one of their own, and then is accepted as one of them and fights along side of them to prove themselves worthy of their honor.

I still can't believe it was Tom Cruise in this movie, if only he could do more similar things to The Last Samurai.",1104537600,2,1442,4.2988929889298895
2008191,5,B0001JXOVC,"I was very impressed with this movie. More so for the costuming and scenery than the acting. Although the characters were very good and the actors chosen to play the roles did fine jobs. As a semi-historical film, it glossed over many of the international politics that affected Japan in that era. But it did a fine job of depicting one result of those politics. Samurai of the ""old school"" saw their way of life slipping away, and being replaced by a style of warfare they felt was dishonorable. They also feared more foreign intervention in the coming years, and saw a gradual eroding of their Emporer's power.

This is one of the few Tom Cruise movies that I felt he didn't try to carry the whole film. It achieved a fairly good balance of allowing the characters to all enjoy an importance in the film that made it more informative and enjoyable to watch.

The acting was better than I expected.  Tom Cruise is a much better actor than many of his big budget action flicks would suggest; on the all too rare occassion that he takes on an interesting script, his performances are quite impressive (e.g. Born on the Fourth of July, Interview with a Vampire).  To some extent, this film is an attempt to mix the traditional action-Cruise with the more intense and inwardly tortured character seen in his better works.  And as a result the film left me with somewhat mixed impressions.  Certainly the film has its moments; there are scenes that are beautifully shot and choreographed.  Unfortunately, however, other scenes are so absurdly unrealistic (I'm sorry, no amount of warrior ethos can begin to match the withering blast of a gatling gun) that I was left feeling a bit flat with the result.",1104364800,2,981,4.915151515151515

Why does Hollywood not trust  people with color with our own stories? The true story without the fictional character that Tom Cruise plays was just as intriguing.

I must admit this was a good movie. It was cinematically lush and rich. The views, scenes, and camera shots were amazing and captures a spirit of Japan that is rarely seen. Hans Zimmer makes a emotionally captivating soundtrack. The costumes were well crafted period pieces. The actors gave commendable performances. I was most captivated by Ken Watanabe's performance. His character was a beautiful balance of opposites. He was powerful yet serene, and a leader yet a servant, a rebel yet was dedicated to the emperor. This was a tumultuous time in Japan's history in which tradition clashed with modernization. The tragic story would have been just as amazing without the fictional character that Cruise plays.  I found it hard to believe that a soldier caught and held prisoner for one winter would be able to master swordsmanship to the point that he could stalemate a samurai who has been studying for all his life. Details like that disappoint me. Even in a story as epic as Last Samurai, there had to be a Caucasian meddling in the middle of it all. Loosely based on the life of Siago Takamori, the movie is overall a good film. My criticism is that the movie suggests that Cruise's character is the Last Samurai. In a final scene the whole regiment of Japanese imperial soldiers bow down to a fallen Kastumoto. Algren holds the samurai, yet it appears that the whole of the troops are bowing to Algren!

The movie also was a labor of love by all involved, the costume designs and background were absolute genius, and  even Tom Cruise was one of the producers for the film.

he did something special with this film.

Watanabe). However instead of killing Nathan Algren, Katsumoto

keeps him alive so he can get info about the Emperor's men

people that hired for the job that are the enemy, from

the corrupt officials in Asia who want to turn the country

He drinks to crush the horrible memories, but even that is failing to calm his tortured spirit.

With little to keep him in America, he joins a semi-official mercenary force that goes to Japan to help the pro-West government put down a samuari backlash

You'd think the new imperial army - armed with rifles and cannon - would be able to easily crush the sword-wielding warriors, but in his first encounter with samurai Algren's green troops are wiped out and he is captured.

He survives and is taken to the last samurai warlord Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) who wants to learn about the West ""to know his enemies better"".

Initially reviled by the Japanese, Algren too is learning from his enemies and begins to appreciate their view on life and honour. When it comes time for his release he realises that perhaps the modern way is no longer his to follow.

That pretty much sums up the basic storyline of The Last Samurai and while it can be compared with Dances With Wolves, it is more action filled.

The fight scenes are superb and the battle scenes will have you on the edge of the couch.

The characters are believable and throughout the movie you will form attachments to them.

Cruise is at his best, while Ken Watanabe is sensational as the samurai fighting for his country's traditions and values. Timothy Spall also plays a wonderful role as a former British diplomat turned photographer.

I loved the movie from beginning to the end and Tom brought to light the disparities of the Western versus the Asian cultures. I loved the landscape scenes, the stillness of the village and home, the Taka character so beautifully portrayed, in skilled and sensuous movements. The forces of nature: The drenching rain, the silent snow, the trickle of the stream, the cool wind blowing on the grass in the fields, the pale sunrise and the calm of twilight...

Everything about this movie made me thrilled.

Concerning the war: I loved the way, the director focussed on the training aspect of Captain Algren, in Samurai methods of fighting. The way the wind blew his hair across his eyes, then a second later, the blaze of fire and determination in his eyes just before he was able to come to a draw with his worthy opponent, (with the wooden sword). The battle scene with the Samurai Lord and Captain Algren and his men was spectacular. The armour, the swords, the horses, the strategies... all marvellous.

In terms of love: I like the way love was portrayed without the use of sex. I loved the way Taka dressed Algren for battle. Her gentle caresses, his tender kiss and the way she leaned behind and embraced him as she rested her head on his shoulder. To me it was absolutely beautiful, her love given to him at his greatest hour of need, without compromising either of them, in terms of their respect for each other. It  made me reflect that was the way a woman should support her man. Although if she were fighting in battle it would be equally pleasing.

On the side of peace: The wild cherry blossoms true to Asian tradition, were revered and loved by the noblest of men. The temples were featured in all the brilliant architectural glory. Statue of Buddha was noticed gracefully poised in the shrubbery. All projecting a meditative mood.

The loss of the virtues and values of the Samurai was particularly impressed upon my conscience. It makes one weep, because one remembers the fall of so many great civilisations as a result of time, and new cultures  which  have infiltrated.

2008219,4,B0001JXOVC,"Started out kinda shaky...Honestly almost turned it off but Cruise's performance held my interest so I kept watching.  Thank God I did because it really is a good film.  Sure there are a lot of bad things some people could say about it just to be mean - I hated a lot of the editing in the beginning and that goofy fat guy from Harry Potter Prisoner From Azkaban is terrible in it (most people I know just can't stand Tom Cruise - which is unfortunate because he is  a MUCH better actor than most people give him credit for).  The whole movie is carefully balanced by tremendous action sequences in the middle and final section of the film and the sympathetic Japanese characters (Watanabe, the love interest, the kids etc...). They are all so believable and easy to connect to.  Some of the negative reviews on here (Amazon) are criticizing Cruise's performance harshly and the role his character plays in influencing the samurai/japanese people etc...Really it is Cruise's character though who learns in this movie and not the other way around which the trailer for this film so mistakenly conveyed...And unfortunately prevented me from seeing it in the theater.  And believe me when I say that I am the LAST person to want to see some movie about a ""white man"" (let alone one of the biggest american movie stars in the world) showing some bada#$ ""samurai"" how its done in the skills of fighting...But the film works people.  It isn't Gladiator or Braveheart but the characters are interesting and compelling, and many of the action sequences are truly suspenseful and entertaining...Even rousing at times.  The biggest problem I had with it was the opening (for awhile it was beginning to feel like a poor man's version of ""Glory"" - a perfect film in my mind which Edward Zwick also directed).  This isn't ""Glory"" but it isn't bad either.  Cruise is one of the best actors out there I've decided after watching this film.  People like calling him a ""vanity"" actor because he's such a major star and that he does roles that are in most cases larger than life...But what actor out there can honestly say they don't want that?  And besides he has done a wide array of roles and is surprisingly transformational...I say ""surprisingly"" simply because more people don't want to admit or recognize it...Think about how different he is in this from Born On The Fourth Of July or Collateral or Eyes Wide Shut or Color Of Money or Magnolia or Minority Report...The guy has some serious range people.  Don't be jealous 'cuz he's rich and good looking and has worked with some of the best directors ever (i.e. Oliver Stone, Kubrick, Spielberg, Scorsese, Brian De Palma, Tony Scott, Michael Mann).  Life's too short for that kinda talk people. Admit the truth...Tom Cruise is a beast of an actor and he deserves all the fame he's received whether you want to admit it or not.",1102636800,,2865,4.704
2008220,5,B0001JXOVC,"When I first heard about this movie I was sceptical. I was afraid that a Samurai movie starring a white guy might end up kind of goofy. But Tom Cruise puts in a strong performance here and won me over by the end of the film. If you love swords this is the movie for you. Tons of training with swords, fighting with swords, and philosiphising about them. The action is spectacular, and the score is stirring. The cinemtography is beautiful. The mountain village reminded me of the shire and made me want to live there. For a movie with some brutally violent action sequences, it also features some amazingly peaceful and relaxing moments in the middle of the film. Anyone who believes in honor and chivalry will find this movie inspiring.

2008222,5,B0001JXOVC,"Many have seen this wonder of a movie.  If you don't have the DVD 2 disk version, then you are missing out on so much more.  The first disc has the movie and right after that they have the full movie again but this time with the directors commentary on every aspect of the film as it plays.  The second disk has special features including interviews with the actors and what I think is worth the price of the DVD by itself: The code of the Samurai.  The meaning and essential core of Bushido - what has guided generations of Japanese - is exemplified in these writings.  We, in America, living in an age of twisted values and dishonor - the Code of the Samurai is a necessary template for our youth.

Ken Watanabe, along with the many Japanese actors, are supurb.  The woman who plays Taka displays the epitomy of feminine beauty and grace.

Warning to all men:  She will steal your heart.

Another especially notable scene is when Tom Cruise holds the 8 year old boy as he grieves for what he believes to be the last time he shall see the paternal figure that Tom Cruise had come to be for him - tears shall flow.  It is very touchingly done - you cannot help but feel the pain - for parents - your paternal and maternal instincts will emerge and highten.  This movie - more than any I have seen - incorporates the Japanese spirit and what we in America must instill in our children if they are to have a chance against the selfish and hedonistic ""values"" and examples that inundate our media.

Love, Courage, Loyalty and above all - Honor....this movie is a shinning example.  The quality of the essentials of movie making are already legendary in this movie.  Buy it for the values that this movie so beautifully demonstrates.",1102291200,3,1729,4.427215189873418
2008223,5,B0001JXOVC,"I loved the movie myself. Great camera work, nice action scenes, and alot of drama. I think many people would benefit from watching the old 70's movie Shogun.

I think Cruise did a fine job. Was he ""striving for an Oscar""? Don't know. Don't care. Why not let the movie and actors stand for themselves? Does he have the same personality in all his movies? Well, yah, sorta. But I'm sorry so do most actors that people think are great. I love Anthony Hopkins myself, but he always seems the same. The only actor (another that I love) I can think of off the top of my head that is actually different in some of his movies is Gary Oldman and that's stretching it a bit.

I liked the relationship between Cruise and the people of the village. He saw them as savages, and they saw him the same way. The ""relationship"" with his hostess didn't seem strained to me. She hated him because he was an unwashed savage that killed her husband, but as time progressed, no one could deny his trying not only to fit in but to not back down (which is something they would appreciate). And, he got on well with her kids. Call me chauvanistic here, but any man that is good with a woman's kids will hit a soft spot. And, there was no ""Take me, Cruise!!!"" scene at all in the movie. I don't see the problem. Also, he never was samurai. He appreciated their culture but admittedly didn't understand alot of it which is... understandable.

As to the final part of the movie being overly done hollywood... I think SOMEONE had to survive. Someone had to bring this to the emperor's face and show it in a personal way. When you think about it, Algren was the only option for this. Was it cliche'? Sure. But, had it just ended with them all dying, there would have been no resolution. Perhaps had the emperor been there to see it... then I would say you could just leave it at all the men dying and the emperor being moved by it, but he wasn't. So, someone had to bring this to him. It couldn't be Katsumoto, because he (and his sword) was the message itself. It couldn't have been the other samurai, because to do such a thing would have been not their place and disrespectful (culture gaps here). The only person who could to this, and get away with it, was Algren. He was NOT a samurai (and don't be confused into thinking  The Last Samurai"" referred to him, because it didn't. It referred to Katsumoto.), AND he represented a third party perspective. That was the clincher. The act moved an ""honorless white man"" (culture gap again) to come before the emperor and even offer to end his life in some accordance to the Bushido code. It WAS moving.

And it wasn't saying that by becoming ""modernized"" the Japanese were doing wrong (as a reviewer put it). It was attempting to demonstrate and correct the attitude: the Western culture is better than ours and we must imitate them like a boy imitates his father. THAT'S what Katsumoto was fighting against. You don't have to sterilize your current culture to move forward. Recognize what you have and are and move forward with pride in those things. Don't become a lapdog to cultures who see you as an oddity of backwards savages. Strive for mutual respect.

Anyhow, I found the movie to be both entertaining and moving.",1102204800,3,3242,4.458684654300169
2008234,5,B0001JXOVC,"It's unfortunate that some people don't see the true beauty of this film, like me if you are a anime fan you should see it. The last samurai is great from beginning to end the fight scenes were great and the story and plot was so perfect it's almost unbelievable. Even though the story is fake the families involved and the events that make this story come to life are all historic facts. These men died in battle and even know they died they died to get their point across and to be heard when they needed to be heard the most. It was a fight that couldn't be won but to these men it was either fight  and die proud  or run and you would be forced to kill yourself and die a coward, they died and the rest of their family lived to fight another day. Tom cruse did a great job in this movie but the awards should go to Ken watanabe or Katsumoto and the other men/samurai who made this movie great. To end this some peolple need to be told that before watching this movie don't mistake it for a fraud because some people expect Tom cruse to be the last samurai and seeing that he is not of japanese descent that might bother some people and it's nothing like that because I judged this movie before seeing it and I was dead wrong and suprised at what saw and loved this movie.",1102118400,2,1275,4.137096774193548
2008235,5,B0001JXOVC,"I don't know how this movie got such a bad reputation.  When it first came out, all signs seemed to point to it being a horrible, tedious, Tom Cruise wants an Oscar, epic flop.  Maybe it was poor marketing, but this is far from true.  'The Last Samurai' is a riveting action adventure semi-epic.  How anyone could call this film tedious I really have no idea.

The movie's premise may be a little hard to swallow at first glance.  Captain Algren, a disillusioned Civil War veteran (who also fought alongside the likes of Col. Custer of Little Bighorn fame) trains Japan's army to fight like Western soldiers, gets captured by the samurai and learns their ways to eventually become one of them.  I laughed at the idea just as much as anyone.  When you see the movie, you won't be laughing.  It's shocking how easily you are drawn in and believe everything you see.  This is how well done the movie is.  With the director of 'Glory' and the screenwriter of 'Gladiator', we should have expected no less.

'The Last Samurai' is also more historically accurate than I would have believed.  Included in the special features of the DVD is a History Channel documentary which shows that pretty much the only Hollywood part of the movie is Tom Cruise's character.  Besides that, almost everything in the movie happened in real life.  The law banning samurai from carrying their swords is true, the rebellion of the samurai is true, and even the Emperor of Japan in the movie was a real emperor who actually did all the ""Westernizing"" of Japan.

So if you've stayed away from this film expecting a disastor of a movie, give it a shot.  I grabbed it from the library, thinking ""Why not, it won't cost me anything"" and it blew me away.  After finishing it, I immediately delved into the special features, needing to know more about the movie, which is rare for me.  I suggest it to anyone who loves a great action/epic.",1101945600,7,1907,4.588757396449704
2008236,5,B0001JXOVC,"The years between 1603 and 1867 mark the final samurai period in Japan, known as the Edo Period. It was in January of the year 1867 that the last Japanese shgun, Tokugawa Yoshinobu, was appointed.  Following the assassination of his closest friend in September, Tokugawa Yoshinobu restored authority to the Imperial House in November to Emperor Meiji and the Edo Period came to an official end.  In January of the following year (1868), forces loyal to Tokugawa Yoshinobu were defeated by Imperialist forces near Osaka, but continued to plague the Emperor's rule.  In May, Emperor Meiji placed Tokugawa Yoshinobu under house arrest, Edo was renamed Tokyo, and in July, the last of the Tokugawa Yoshinobu loyalists were defeated.  Several years later in 1876, Emperor Meiji criminalized the wearing of swords.  Another brief rebellion followed in 1877 that was lead by Saigo Takamori.  Called the Satsuma Rebellion, Imperialist forces crushed the rebellion in November 1877.

It is the man Saigo Takamori who is the basis for the main character of Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) in the 2003 film of ""The Last Samurai"", which recreates a fictionalized version of the Satsuma Rebellion in 1877 that includes the assistance of a captured American mercenary, Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), who is hired by the Japanese Imperial Court to help train their newly-established army.  Created by writer John Logan, the character Nathan Algren is a former U.S. Army captain that witnessed many battles against Native Americans, including a few massacres of women and children.  He turns to alcohol to help him deal with the ongoing nightmares of those battles; i.e., delayed stress syndrome.  In the first battle that the ill-prepared Japanese army mounts against the Katsumoto loyalists, Nathan is captured and taken to the village where Katsumoto and his followers live.  Taken care of by the wife of a samurai that Nathan killed during the battle, Taka (Koyuki), who is also Katsumoto's sister, Nathan slowly begins to understand the people that had been his enemy and develops an interesting relationship with Katsumoto, as well as Taka, her sons and Katsumoto's son Nobutada (Shin Koyamada).  Invited to meet with Emperor Meiji (Shichinosuke Nakamura), Katsumoto, Nathan and a large group of Katsumoto's followers travel to Tokyo. There, Nathan meets again with the man he hates most, Colonel Bagley (Tony Goldwyn), as well as the minister to Emperor Meiji who hired Nathan to begin with: Omura (Masato Harada).  However, Nathan's time in the village has altered his perceptions before the biggest battle of the film begins.

With superb cinematography, as well as excellent sets and costumes that are consistent with late nineteenth-century Japan and America, ""The Last Samurai"" is a beautiful, yet tragic film.  The film earned four Oscar nominations: Ken Watanabe for Best Supporting Actor, as well as nominations for Best Set/Art Decoration, Best Sound and and Best Costume Design.  Tom Cruise's portrayal of Nathan Algren was one of his best performances as he took upon a role that was quite different from his typical arrogant, egocentric characters of past films.  Instead, we see a character that is emotional and more interested in others, something that I would not have expected from Cruise.  Overall, I rate the 2003 ""The Last Samurai"" with 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.  Writer John Logan and director Edward Zwick did an excellent job of creating a plausible story based upon an actual Japanese historical event.",1101600000,7,3523,5.192579505300353

No, it's no way near perfect b/c Hollywood made this film.

Why you'd wannna buy it:

1. One of the best battle scenes ever (at the Lord of the Rings/Braveheart/Glory level)

2. It's an epic; it's something new-no gladiators/american wars

3. Sad as HELL! I'm not gonna blow anything away yet

4. Superb performance by Wantanabe, Cruise-what can I say? The guy can ACT!

Why some ppl. didn't like it:

1. VERY VERY inaccurate. Please don't study for the World History China/Japan test using details from this film. The Saurai are misrepresented as pure good guys and the Japanese govt. as pawns for the US. Not true!

2. Time inconsistency- samurai techniques that took years to master can now be done by Cruise in less than a year

3. First 15 minutes of the movie, a guy kicks Samurai [...]. Later, he can't even touch them in a practice fight! Adrenaline? Go figure...

Overall-despite its flaws, it ranks #9 in my Personal Favorites b/c I'm an epic lover (the Lord of the Rings, Lawrence of Arabia, Braveheart, Gladiator, Glory, Spartacus, Patriot, etc.) It has great costumes, excellent cinematography, solid acting with honorable mention to Wanatanbe, and is just a great movie.",1101254400,3,1203,4.852941176470588
2008239,5,B0001JXOVC,"This movie is excellent in conveying a different and needed perspective about Japan at this period of history.  Much can be learned. Unfortunately, I am reading reviews from people that wanted a typical Tom Cruise action movie.  They were expecting a formula based on action, clever plot twists, and more action.  This does not require an effort to understand the beauty of another culture.  One reviewer complains that the Japanese actors were just being Japanese, and therefore not acting. After so many slice and dice 'em samurai movies, this one is a slice way above the rest.  Ken Watanabe starts the movie in deep meditation and having a vision.  His strong centeredness from meditation is carried through the entire film.  He did not get shaken by even the most insulting behavior from Cruise as Captain Algren.  This chemistry was special throughout the film.  This is a formula that includes real story telling, action, a demand to stretch your understanding, and more action.  Therefore, the reviews cite the action as good and the rest as bad.  I respect Tom Cruise a lot more now after seeing this movie, and knowing it became a personal project.  It does remind me of Kevin Costner and ""Dances with Wolves.""

White man is hired to destroy foreign culture, white man falls in love with culture, white man fights on the side of the culture he was supposed to destroy....same plot essentially right?  With that said, the action scenes are entertaining and I found the character development between the samurai and cruise to be pretty good.

2008242,3,B0001JXOVC,"Good costumes, terrific and brutal battle scenes in a breath-taking sequence which often resembles ""Braveheart"" and a few hints of the samurai tradition, but the final result is rather mediocre, because the story itself has a weak historical foundation and little relation to reality. I can hardly imagne rebel samurais slaying so remorselessly their brethren who serve in the national Japanese Army, and 19th century was certainly not like the 16th century (""the golden age of Japan"") when the rival warlords were fighting each other in an endless series of savage but highly ritual battles. Edward Zwick's work is a good ""modern"" action movie but certainly not a classic. The obvious lack of authenticity leaves the film with only 3 stars.

You have to listen to the narration--no one knows what really happened.  That final scene--in my opinion--is only what the british linguist wants to believe happened to his friend.  As for Tom Cruise surviving, well again the narration points out that many people think he died of his injuries.  He may have made it off that battle field, but he didn't do it easily.  Also, somone pointed out that if he really believed the Samuri code he would have killed himself.  A) I think he owed it to Katsumoto to bring the Emperor his sword, and tell the emperor what took place.  The whole point of that battle was to send a message to the emperor, and it was a message that needed at least one person to drive it home.  B)Anyone who thinks he should have just killed himself misses the fact that he isn't samuri.  He's a melding of two cultures.  Even after all he'd been through, I think that remains true.",1100390400,2,1063,4.28643216080402
2008258,4,B0001JXOVC,"The Last Samurai does many things exactly right, but falls short in a few key respects. It's a great action movie, and passable as a drama. That's a shame, because it could have been great on both counts.

The major problem with this movie is that the main character is played by Tom Cruise. This isn't because I think he's a bad actor; in fact, I think he does a pretty good job with his role in this film. However, a white man was totally unnecessary here -- this movie would have been much better off as a story dealing only with the Japanese. The assimilation that occurs here strains credulity, and certainly Ken Watanabe, in a sterling performance as Katsumoto, could have carried a film himself. The fact that the presence of Cruise is a necessary concession to the target audience makes it forgivable, but not likable.

Things would have been better if Cruise's character, Algren, were better explored by the film. Unfortunately, although Cruise does his best, the writers don't seem to know what to do with Algren. Though his transformation is the heart of this story, we never really come to understand who Algren was at the beginning, and have only a vague idea of who he has become at the end. Even his journal entries, poorly narrated by Cruise, grant us little insight. We are merely left to take for granted that Algren would come to respect, rather than resent, his captors. Why Algren takes a more enlightened approach to other cultures than his American peers is also a mystery.

This lack of insight into Algren should be contrasted with Katsumoto, whose motivations, though convoluted by modern standards, are fully explicated.

In other respects, this film succeeds greatly, and masterfully avoids falling into most of the Hollywood traps. There's no sex scene, no pointless explosions, and in many ways, no happy ending. The battle scenes are wonderfully shot, and the setting is excellently delineated. The emotional interplay between Cruise and his Japanese counterparts is good in most instances, though there are a few moments that falter. And Katsumoto's final scene is powerful and moving, an excellent note on which to end a movie.

Unfortunately, they didn't go straight from there to the film's epilogue. Instead, they tacked on an additional scene with Algren and the emperor, in which the dialogue consisted almost entirely of cliches, and the young Emperor (jarringly) speaks in idiomatic American English. It's crap, and it comes at the end of the movie, where it does the most damage.

If you can convince yourself to forget that awful piece of filmmaking, however, The Last Samurai has some resonance, a moving story, and compelling characters. Katsumoto in particular is one of the most interesting characters to come onscreen in recent years, and I cannot stress enough how well Ken Watanabe plays him. This movie is worth renting just to see his intense performance. If you're a fan of samurai films in general, it's probably worth a buy. It's far from the quality of a Kurosawa epic, but The Last Samurai is a much better film than your average Hollywood blockbuster.",1100131200,,3108,4.899239543726236
2008259,5,B0001JXOVC,"This movie is one of the greatest action movies I have ever seen, with great acting, directing, and a great plot.  It keeps you interested for the full 2 and a half hours.  Nathan (Tom Cruise) is recruited (by his superior officer whom he despises) to train the Japanese army (he was a good warrior in the battles in the U.S. against the ""Indians"") as the Japanese are trying to civilize themselves and be a world power and they want to get rid of the Samurai and rural way of life and customs (including no firearms).  After being ordered to lead the Japanese Army into battle prematurely against the Samurai he is almost killed and captured by the Samurai as the Army gets demolished even with their guns.  He lives with the Samurai and their leaded Katsumoto, who after a while the two take a great liking to one another and Nathan begins to train with them and learn their lifestyle and discipline which he comes to highly admire.  After being returned almost 2 years later to the Japanese Army (which is 20 times larger now) he finds they have new firepower (gattling guns and cannons) and they will destroy the Samurai's in battle.  Katsumoto then turns himself in to the Emporer (who is his friend) only to be told he will die. But Nathan and the other Samurai's rescue Katsumoto and Nathan takes up w/ them in a battle against the whole Japanese Army.

2008261,2,B0001JXOVC,"First off, The Good: The cinematography, though sometimes almost TOO glossy/slick for it's own good, is consistently excellent, but then it is by John Toll (Braveheart, The Thin Red Line) so no surprise there.  Ken Watanabe is fine, noble, strong yet vulnerable and easily out-acts Cruise without breaking a sweat. He does more with a glance than Cruise can do with his whole grunting/straining/scowling arsenal of Master Thespian Acting tricks. In fact most of the Japanese cast is uniformly above average. Some of the battle sequences were intense and well staged, particularly the Ninja attack, but to even begin to compare them with Braveheart, as some reviewers have done here, invites incredulity.

The Bad: Hans Zimmer's music nearly overwhelms several scenes in the worst sledgehammer way, underlining and cueing the audience into what emotion they should be feeling in every scene instead of merely setting and enhancing mood. Contrast this with the same composer's outstanding score for The Thin Red Line (incidentally a FAR superior film in every respect about men in battle/war/self-conflict). Then there's Mr. Tom Cruise...what to say about pretty boy? He wants that bloody Oscar SO BAD you can see him straining with the effort in nearly every scene. Several times I thought that bulging vein in his forehead was simply going to burst right there on screen. At least that would have been entertaining to watch. Cruise can be effective given the right role and a strong enough director to rein in his own worst instincts (this summer's Collateral for example). I'm afraid Mr. Zwick was not up to the challenge.

And, The Ugly: the ending. OH MY GAWD! I saw it coming and still didn't believe it would really go there, but yup, sure enough, Our Intrepid Hero gets to lead the suicide charge, miraculously survive it, help the REAL hero commit sepuku, stare down the emperor into shame, AND make his way back to the picture-postcard lotus blossom village to shack up with the wife of the man he killed! Alrighty then. This may have sunk to a new all time low in over-the-top, ludicrously inappropriate, spiked-on happy endings that completely invalidate everything the film has labored to create, even if unsuccessfully, for the last 150 minutes!!! Honor? If Cruise has indeed learned anything about the Samurai code of honor, he would have disemboweled himself on the last battlefield along with the other guy! But no (and I can see Mr. Cruise's fingerprints all over this) he has to be the defiant hero who overcomes all odds, redeems himself AND gets the girl too. Puh-leeze. Even though I was dissatisfied with much of what had come before, a decent ending could have at least redeemed the film somewhat.

On the plus side, Cruise's acting is more than passable; the evocation of late 19th-century Japan is convincing; the cinematography, peerless; and the battle scenes, gripping and well-wrought.

But . . .

Has it ever occurred to anybody that Cruise's character was fighting on the WRONG side?

I mean, you've got these boring, stuffy guys in the capital who want to get rid of the samurais, then you have the samurais themselves, living in the mountains in manly splendor like a bunch of maurading Che Guevaras.

Except that all those ""boring, stuffy guys in the capital"" are, when you get right down to it, trying to construct a society BASED ON CONSTITUTIONALISM, CONSENSUAL GOVERNMENT, and THE RULE OF LAW, while the untamed samurai simply long for the perpetuation of the swashbuckling, rule-of-the-strongest-type era in which they were ascendant.

In other words, the ""villains"" of this movie are nothing short of the founders of modern Japan:  the heroes, in my book.  Not just that, but they were exponents of everything we as a civilized society presumably stand for.

The samurais of this period -- and in this movie--, though inarguably romantic and daring, were essentially trying to turn the clock back to a time when tribalism, internecine warfare, and general lawless bloodshed were the norm.  In short, these guys were standing squarely in the way of a modern humanistic society informed by values such as meritocracy, egalitarianism, due process, etc.

And we're supposed to sympathize with these guys merely because Cruise's character happens upon them?

I have not enjoyed the few movies Cruise had done just prior to this movie (from Eyes Wide Shut on, they were pretty gross, disturbing, or just awful...and I'm a total Cruise fan).  So, hearing that he was going to be in a movie like this, I groaned and thought, ""Damn.  I wish he'd done this movie five years ago.  He'll probably ruin it now.""  But hey, I'm a total Japanese culture lover, so I figured I'd watch it anyway.

I thought I was disappointed with the movie when it began, because they set up the plot very slowly, and lay out a large amount of information that seems irrelevant.  But, like the quiet slice of sword through air, the pieces began to come together, and I found myself enraptured with the film.

Ken Watanabe (Katsumoto)'s presence on the screen is breathtaking, as were his family and friends.  Taka, the heroine, was beautiful in her silence, and the scene with her and Tom at the end was...well, unforgettable.  Omura is excellent and, like the rest of those mentioned here, enfuses so much emotion in one gesture or expression.  Nobutada (the archer) was, I believe, my favorite character outside of Watanabe.  His final scene had me sobbing.  But I think most impressive is the way that Tom Cruise doesn't dominate this film.  It's almost as if he, like his character, is enraptured and humbled by these people, and he's purposefully pulling himself in, so that THEY shine on screen.

Overall, an absolutely spectacular film.  It's perhaps a bit too intelligent for some, a bit too poignant for others.  It is, however, a film that I hope will inspire others.  Its lessons are vast.

2008278,3,B0001JXOVC,"For many western viewers, this may be the first ""samurai"" film that they have watched with only a vague and rudiamentary knowledge of who the samurai were, what they symbolized, and how they arose and declined in power.  The more one knows about the samurai, the more ""phoney"" this film appears to be.  Make no mistake, this film is more about samurai ideals rather than the actual samurai.  This film romanticizes the samurai warrior class when many people understand the samurai as nothing more than a bunch of sword-wielding bullies who enforced the will of the local warlord or Daimyo.  There's an early scene in the movie ""SHOGUN"" where a samurai instantly sliced off the head of a peasant who simply did not bow in the presence of a samurai.  I watched Kurosawa's ""RAN"" (before watching ""THE LAST SAMURAI"" in the cinema) where the samurai are portrayed as self-destructive powermongers.  ""THE LAST SAMURAI"" looks good visually, but its potential as a great film is compromised by Tom Cruise's egotism and Hollywood's cliches and obligatory plot devices (such as the weak ""happy"" ending).  Nonetheless, this film is a good introduction to the CONCEPT of the samurai to anyone who knows little about this complex warrior elite that have come to symbolize the old agrarian Japan that is now seemingly lost in today's technocratic Japan.

By the way, Japan's new modern army was modelled along Prussian lines.  The sight of American officers training Japanese soldiers wearing Prussian-looking uniforms continues to leave me baffled.  On the other hand, it's a Hollywood film where it is too commercially risky to cast Tom Cruise as a German officer named ""Fritz"" who drowns his sorrows in shnapps instead of whisky.",1099008000,9,1718,5.017605633802817

The premise of the movie is anything but new, even so, it's a unique production. It offers insight into the japanese culture and we, the audience, take it in through the senses of the main character, Nathan Allgren [Tom Cruise]. We learn about the samurai, honor, trust, pursuit of perfection and harmony, discipline and tradition, all adjectives that make Japan what it is today.

There are a couple of things however that I personally would have liked to have seen changed. A bit more action and a bit less philosophy and talk [less gab, more shooting one might say].

The last scenes of the movie could have definitely done well without the typical hollywood dramatic dialogue and action. It was a bit over the top compared to the rest of the movie which was realistic and down-to-earth.

Almost forgot to mention the movie's soundtrack. Absolutely brilliant, the tracks are a combination of japanese traditional music and western music. Beautiful.

The war sequences reminded me of braveheart - large scale and beautiful to say the least.  The movie is basically about the samurai and how they fight to survive and stay true to their culture as the govt tries to move towards a modernization of its military.

The japanese actors were all fantastic.  They speak in japanese and its subtitled - making the film even more authentic.  Tom Cruise is believable as a courageous leader and soldier.  The samurai sword training battles were great drama as cruise keeps on fighting even when he's almost beaten to death by one of the samurai fighting with a Kendo stick.

My only complaint is that tom cruise should not have survived that last battle - far too unrealistic...he was riding in with his sammies and everyone got killed by the gattling gun except cruise...thought that was weird....then all the Modern soldiers bowed to cruise (although the film wanted you to think it was the japn samurai leader)...mistake in filming there.

2008284,3,B0001JXOVC,"I usually hate films that use this formula: ""White guy thrown into a foriegn (non-white American) culture turns into the leader of the people of that culture"".

The White Guy In The Savage Land motif has been used many times before, in Tarzan movies (Hidden movie message: black people=Apes), Westerns like ""A Man Called Horse"" and TV shows like Shogun, Doctari and Johnny Quest. Now the GREAT ACTOR, Yoda-er,um, Tom Cruise, takes a turn at playing the White Savior in the Last Samurai. I'll give this movie points for:

1. The cinematography - very nicely done.

2. The Asian actors - they were very good and were able to do the physical stunt work in a convincing manner.

3. The battle scenes - they were really good.

4. The historical context of the movie - a very interesting period in Japanese history.

The issue that I have with The Last Samurai is that the film does turn into a 'Bwana adventure towards the end. The white guy learns to handle a katana like a pro in a year (ho-ha!), being able to take on Ninjas and trained killers with little difficulty. Then he becomes a general of this rebel army at the same time, due to his vastly superior experience as an American soldier of course. This transition from ""hated enemy"" to ""Bwana"" is always a problem.

If it wasn't for all the good stuff in this film that I mentioned earlier, I would recommend giving The Last Samurai a pass, but it is worth watching at least once.",1097625600,7,1434,4.513513513513513
2008285,3,B0001JXOVC,"The production on this film was very well done, the battle scenes were great and the hand to hand fighting (although a small part of the film) reminded me of some of the better kung fu type action flicks I remembered as a kid.  The acting was decent although I think I'm getting a little tired of Tom Cruise.

I wish the film had gone more into the relationship between the American and his Japanese host (the woman that tended to him when he finds himself captive in a remote village) because I thought there was some decent on screen chemistry there.  In any case, the movie was mostly an action/adventure/war flick, so I can't complain too loudly.

Now as for the slanted history and the obvious anti-American sentiment, it's funny, when I think about a book I just read and reviewed here.  In Alan Colmes' book on liberalism he talks about how liberals are better because they are progressive and being progressive and moving foward are better qualities and it is the ""better"" people that think progress.  However, it's ironic that the left seems to always be against America, or conservatives at least, wanting to bring ""progress"" to other places.  It seems that here in America, things like equal rights for woman should be the law of the land, but in backward places, where it's ""just the custom"" that those rights don't exist, America shouldn't interfere.

I bring the topic up because in this flick the ideal of being a Samurai is so romanticized and the ideal of Americanism is so bashed that it takes away any kind of serious nature the film might have had in an historical sense.  It isn't that America (or better said) Americans haven't  committed all kinds of horrible sins, it's just that so has everyone else on this plant and to deny that is foolhardy.

If you can look past some of the silliness of the film, like an American solider going to Japan in 1876 and learning the language in a few months, while recovering from near fatal war wounds, while falling in love, while learning the martial arts, while recovering from alcoholism and at the same time earning the love and respect of the villagers including some that suffered the loss of loved ones at his hands, then you can probably just enjoy the movie as an action flick, as I did.",1097366400,3,2257,4.603491271820449
2008286,2,B0001JXOVC,"I wish that you could divide the rating system -- have one set of ratings for the story and another for the message.

If this movie were about a fictional man from a fictional place learning about a different culture and finding a new sense of honor in himself, the movie would merit three stars based on the production values, the star power, and the entertainment value of exotic locales, battle scenes, redemption scenes, etc.(the downsides -- the plot is predictable and there is no real depth to the characters)

But this movie disturbed me, perhaps because I had just read a history of Japan, and because it continued this Hollywood self-hatred of America theme that keeps rearing its ugly head.

To view the movie, you would never know that Japan was struggling to overthrow a decadent and stifling shogunate that had basically kept the country back in the Middle Ages.  Farmers weren't allowed to leave their villages.  Samurai weren't allowed to go into business.  Until Perry came, foreigners were restricted access to one trading post.  While the backlash to Perry triggered a wave of ostrich-like denial of technology and the west, a very smart clique of leaders soon realized that the Japanese themselves had to take the lead in modernizing their country.  The samurai who didn't get it, would have made their country more vulnerable to the west by being more backward, if they had had their way.

So the ending is completely wrong, if you are pro-Japanese.  Yes, they chafed under unequal trade treaties, but the future safety of the country was not to go backwards...and they didn't, so unlike China, the Japanese were able to recoup their sovereignty and engage the West on increasingly equal (and if you were Russian in 1905) superior footing.

The ending is also completely wrong if you are pro-American.  The character played by Tom Cruise loathes his country as much as he loathes himself.  Americans were not saints during the 1860s or in any era, but there were plenty of heroes, and it's a tiresome choice to continue this stock theme of self-flagellation so rampant in movies like Dances with Wolves (which this story really rips off -- I'm sure that's how they pitched it -- ""its Dances with Wolves, but set in Japan"").

I bet that the movie would have done much better if the Cruise character had been more noble in the U.S. and if the ending could have been about some kind of reconciliation, instead of the divisive travesty that they decided to show.

At some point, one of the Hollywood studios is going to wake up and realize that Americans like to see positive, heroic portrayals from time to time instead of the diseased anti-heroes that they keep foisting on us, and whichever studio gets this will clean up at the box office.

If you are into Japan see one of Kurosawa's films.  If you are into east-west stories, read Shogun or Tai-Pan.  If it's movie night, and you've seen everything else, this will do for entertainment, but take it for a piece of fiction, don't take its pretensions seriously.",1097366400,14,3033,4.777777777777778
2008287,4,B0001JXOVC,"This film truly captures the essence of the Hagakure, a document written by Tsunetomo Yamamoto in the eighteenth century, and that is the essential dictate for all warriors of the Samurai: to die!

If you are looking for historical accuracy in this film, you'll be disappointed. This is a brushstroke rendering of the Menji regime, a time when Japan sought out western technology and customes in order to `keep up' with Europe and the U.S. during the Industrial Revolution. The film's theme is the conflict between the old ways and the new and if the old culture has any place in the modern world. This film was successful in many ways, communicating the message that basic human values, Samurai values - honour, loyalty, courage, discipline and the essence of service, one's basic duty to one's family, the clan and one's country, holds more value than technological advances.

As has been mentioned many times, the true star of this picture is Ken Watanabe, as the Lord of the clan he displays all the virtues of the Samurai without having to utter a word. This actor has great presence, and for me, made this picture worthwhile. Cruise's character, a professional soldier racked with guilt, drowning his conscience with alcohol, to then be assimilated into a Samurai clan, to learn their ways, managed to pull it off.

If this film should win any awards, it would be for production design and cinematography. Japan's simplistic beauty in architecture, landscape and period costumes appear to be accurate and very beautiful. As a period piece, my feeling is that they captured the atmosphere of the time, making the film a pleasure to view.

The thing to remember is this movie is rated pretty high cause it has intense battle scenes that resemble gladiator in its gruesome display of battle lust (not that I have anything against that). The one part I didn't like but is understandable since it has japenese actors in it is that halfway through the movie they start talking in japenese and you have to read the bottom of the screen to see what they say. Now if its 2am and your tired and sitting far from the tv, that can be a problem but as i said, cruise is in japan at that time so he should speak the language as well. Just in case anyone did miss it, basically cruise is the last man left in his unit when its taken out by japanese samurais. they spare him and hold him captive in their village. soon he embraces their culture and starts to find a little peace in himself.

2008289,3,B0001JXOVC,"I missed seeing The Last Samurai in the theatre but decided to buy a copy anyway because it looked good in the ads and the write-ups I'd read.

Tom Cruise plays the role of Captain Nathan Algren, former Indian fighter in the U.S. Army (bits of this are shown in flashbacks)now a pathetic drunken loser reduced to giving sales demonstrations of Winchester rifles.

He's contacted by a former associate and takes on the job of instructing the newly formed Japanese Imperial Army. The story is set in 1876 or so at a time of great change in Japan, the forces of modernization fast pacing Japan into the modern age. Part of this mission involves rooting out the last Samurai holdouts. Algren leads his recruits into battle, his recruits are massacred and after a valiant fight he is captured by the very man he is supposed to deal with. Taken to the Samurai village as a prisoner Algren gradually learns their ways, even learns to respect them. Algren eventually, after failing to reintegrate with his own people (and the dishonorable Japanese modernizers who I wanted to see get killed),joins with the Samurai in a battle to the death with the new Imperial Army. This is of course a slaughter with swords & spears against rifles & Gatling guns. The Imperial soldiers are so shamed by what they've done that they refuse an order to kill Algren and the Emperor strips the chief ""New Japan"" leader of everything he has.

You never really learn what happens to Algren, it seems he goes back to the stronghold and the lead Samurai's widow, but that is presented as maybe he did, who knows?

I thought the story was interesting, Cruise did a good job, but something was lacking- I'm not sure what. The costumes/ weapons were great, most of the sets/ locations were too ( a real sense of being in Japan)I just needed something more. Some of the extras are very interesting, I liked learning about how things were built or designed.

2008291,3,B0001JXOVC,"The Last Samurai is a movie clearly made by Westerners for a Western audience.  Despite apparent misinterpretations, you can definitely feel that the movie was created with a mixture of awe and respect towards Japanese culture.  So what the movie lacks in realism it does, in a way, make up in heart.

Different cultures and ways of living radiate a distinct feel, or 'vibe.'  Movies like 'The Joy Luck Club' and 'Heaven and Earth' were able to successfully capture the feel of the cultures those films had set out to portray; but for every Joy Luck Club, you get tons of films that fail to capture the essence and feel of Asian cultures.  Being Asian-American, I'm always on the prowl for the next good movie featuring Asian people and cultures.  The Last Samurai, however, doesn't fit in either category.  It falls upon stereotypes at times and doesn't quite capture the feel of Japanese culture, but it approaches the subject of the samurai and Japanese history so reverently and respectfully that it shouldn't be discounted as another clichd film.

The story has been gone over by many other reviewers, so I won't go into it further.  I enjoyed the process of development the main character (Algren) underwent.  I don't agree with other reviewers who criticize the film, saying that it's anti-industry.  Yes, Algren connects closer to the Earth once immersed in the natural style of living the samurai village enjoys, but I believe the message of the film is far more sophisticated than just that of ""nature good, industry bad.""  What I truly appreciated in this film is that it showed the main character finding his peace of mind through developing discipline, humility, and loyalty--all inspired and taught to him by the samurai who become his friends.  The obligatory sex scene was also excluded (thank goodness), which is more consistent with how a Japanese widow would have conducted herself.

The movie boasted strong performances.  Tom Cruise's performance indicated his passion for his role, and if you watch the behind-the-scenes extras on the DVD, you'll see him brimming with enthusiasm over the history of samurai and the code of Bushido.  Ken Wanatabe was a charismatic and dynamic presence and he owned every scene he appeared in.

The cinematography was well done and the scenery was absolutely gorgeous.  This is a film that is very pleasing to the eye to look at.  Whoever oversaw art direction for this film deserves a raise.  The fight scenes were choreographed nicely, as well.

2008293,2,B0001JXOVC,"As other reviewers have said, this film has gorgeous scenery and remarkable attention to visual historical detail such as costume and architecture. Unfortunately, the approach to the cultural history of Japan is far from accurate and in some ways derogatory. It reminds me of the sort of 19th century ""noble savage"" romanticism that today is universally recognized as patronizing and racist.

Anyone who knows anything about the history of Japan knows that the samurai were essentially feudal warlords. Each leading samurai controlled his own territory, and his subjects paid tribute in exchange for safety. The samurai battled endlessly (and bloodily) with each other, in a thousand-year struggle for supremacy and dominance. The so-called ""honor"" of their militant mentality was accompanied by a culture that demanded, among other things, that the wife of a defeated samurai should commit suicide rather than live with the ""shame"" of her defeated husband. The emporer at that time was nothing more than the samurai who managed to become the most powerful and convinced a number of other samurai to serve him (as apparently the lead character was one) ... what the film omits is that before the emporer ended up in a war with his own samurai, he and his fathers had waged a several-century war against all the other samurai, engaging in wholesale slaughter and subjugation of all the other groups. Furthermore, what occurred in the period immediately following the period portrayed in the film is even more telling: once the emporer had dispatched the last of his potential rivals, he created a personal cult around himself and his descendants coupled with a japanese nationalism that eventually lead to the Japanese imperial expansion that brutally occupied much of Asia prior to World War Two (and which America and our allies Britain and Australia expended many lives and much treasure to defeat).

Historically speaking, I don't believe that any of these groups were necessarily something to look up to or find ""noble""... in reality, all sides in this battle were equally vicious and power-hungry. Portraying them as such is misleading and wrong, and does an injustice to those Japanese now who know that their history was anything but this ridiculously romanticized claptrap.

In addition, the historical distortions seem designed to leave one with a moral lesson that is both misguided and disturbing. As another reviewer wrote:

What is the moral narrative of this story? Industry bad, nature good? Those who follow ancient practices good, modern science bad? But modern weapons win and the honor of fighting is lost.

If the film had accurately portrayed the history of the samurai and the rise of the emporer as I described above, could anyone possibly reach this conclusion? You decide...",1096675200,9,2799,5.183628318584071

There is a nice touch in the love triangle between our hero and the wife of his fallen enemy -- and that enemy who ""haunts"" him -- but that he comes to honor.

Then, a proposition is offered that would quadruple his monthly pay and yield him a shred of honor. His commanding officer beckons his services in the elimination of the unruly samurai who oppose American influence on their native Japan. Algren sets sail to the Far East to instruct the Japanese army on how to fight in a Western fashion and how to modernize the outdated methods of the samurai.

Armed with Winchester rifles and superior numbers, though utterly ill-prepared, Algren is sent to engage a seemingly outmatched enemy. However, the combative tactics of the samurai prove too great, as his men are routed and Algren is taken captive by the samurai. Under normal circumstances, it would be taboo for the samurai to hold anyone prisoner, but under strict orders from their leader, Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), Algren is to be kept alive.

In the beginning of the film, Katsumoto mediates atop a mound overlooking a river valley. He envisions an upcoming battle. In this midst of war, while clashing swords with an opponent, he notices a white streak of fury at his flank. It is a fearsome white tiger with eyes very much like his own.

Right away, Katsumoto believes Algren to be this mystical feline that dominates his visions, something the others find hard to believe--particularly, the beautiful Taka (Koyuki), the spouse of the man Algren killed and sister to the fabled Katsumoto; and Higen (Sosuke Ikematsu), a first-rank samurai master.

In the process of winning over the companionship of the samurai and learning their language and discipline in the realm of battle, Algren comes to find his true identity. ""There were times on the battlefield where I came to dispute the existence of any sort of god, but there is a soulful enchantment about this place of which I've never known,"" he says.

Some critics laughed off this $120 million epic as ""Dances with Sushi"" long before its release. Contending that Cruise was not capable of such a leading role and mocking filmmaker Edward Zwick's directorial credentials as brisk-action livestock fodder, there was an unfair critical bias about this picture while it was still in pre-production. I hope those critics enjoyed their decapitation in shame of defeat, seeing as ""The Last Samurai"" is nothing short of resplendent.",1096243200,3,3176,5.094230769230769
2008296,2,B0001JXOVC,"I am dumb  Truly dumb  I wish I had read more about the REAL 'Last Samurai,' Saigo Takamori , before writing this review yesterday. I retract my initial impression, retract a star, and absolutely do NOT recommend this insidious, slyly racist movie in any manner.

I know there are many who will say, ""Well, it's no different than 'Braveheart,' or 'Dances With Wolves.'

Actually, it is. Utterly.

In 'Braveheart,' they took a historical figure and made him the six-million dollar man - faster, stronger, better than before. William Wallace was pumped up to cartoonish proportions, and GIVEN more than he achieved.

In 'Dances With Wolves,' the main character lived with the Native Americans and shared their lives...he wasn't put forth as influencing history and creating supposed historical fact.

In 'The Last Samurai,' nothing gets accomplished by the Japanese without the influence, leadership and direction of a totally artificial, Caucasian character.

History is stripped from those who made it, and placed at the feet of Racism. Remove that White character and his supposed 'accomplishments,' from the story, and nothing would have been done - there would have been no battle of Satsuma, Japan would have entered into a trade agreement with the US in 1876, the Samurai would be wringing their hands in the hills, wondering what to do.

Revisionist History at its sneakiest, and most insidiously damaging, because it is not that overt.

THe Fiction as I the dumb owner of the Crpgroup see it.

Starring a miscast Tom Cruise as an alcoholic, wise-cracking, cocky washed-up ex-Civil War hero and former Indian Fighter who holds the rank of Captain in the U. S. Cavalry, `The Last Samurai' opens with a dream - a white tiger battling shadowy Samurai. The tiger is leader Katsumoto `s (Ken Watanabi) standard in battle, a line of semi-interesting symbolism that is abandoned not long into the story, once it is ham-handedly flapped in our faces that the White Tiger represents Cruise's character.

Katsumoto is one of the Emperor of Japan's last remaining links to the old ways; the leader of the rebelling Samurai and in very real danger of losing his life, either via assasination or suicide. Emperor Meiji (Shichinosuke Nakamura) is hardly more than a teenager, and simply mad for all things Western. He wishes to know everything about the West, and will drag his own people, kicking and screaming if he must, into a trade alliance. The Samurai, being loyal to the Empire, do not wish to abandon the traditional ways of the ancestors. They believe in rebelling, they are doing the greatest service for him they are capable of.

Meet Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), a haunted man who drinks to keep his nightmares at bay, which only works somewhat. Once a celebrated Indian Fighter, he is reduced to promoting the new Winchester repeating rifles at fairs, until he loses his job after his latest oafish, dangerous performance. What is the Captain haunted by? Memories of slaughter, and bullets ripping through the bodies of Indian women and children, under the guise of military ""orders"".

Enter Omura, (Masato Harada) The Emperor's advisor, aka Snidely Whiplash2. He wishes to hire Algren and his dopily evil former commanding officer, Colonel Bagley (Tony Goldwyn) to come to Japan, and teach the army there Western techniques, with Western arms and armament. In spite of the Captain's drunken rudeness, the offer is made and accepted, and off across the Ocean they sail.

Upon arrival in Japan, after a nerve wracking audience with the young Emperor, Captain Algren sets out to teach the 'army,' which consists of mostly farmers and young men, who have never handled Western firearms before. He shows them a thing or two, which leads to the setup for the Captain to lead his raw recruits against the remaining Samurai, who are in rebellion against the Emperor's decision to open to the West.

The Samurai handily trounce the recruits, badly wound, then capture Captain Algren, and whisk him off to the mountains because he's just that cool...this takes place in early Fall.

By early Spring, Algren has become a better Samurai than the Samurai themselves, taught himself Japanese, become the new crush of the widow of a Samurai warrior he killed and become the father-figure to her sons, taught himself Buddhism, cured his alcoholism, and battled a veteran Samurai to a draw in a pitched match-up.

2008297,3,B0001JXOVC,"Wow! I had just seen the trailer for TLS, a month or so before it was released, and was impressed. All previous attempts at a decent samurai film (save the 7 Samurai) had been complete flops but this promised to be a success. Loosely, I think, based on James Clavell's Shogun with close ties to Dances With Wolves. A washed up and aggressive western barbarian is civilized by the natives and comes to the blinding realisation that he is, in fact, the real enemy; then switches sides - Evident in Shogun, TLS and Dances with Wolves. In any case, I patiently waited for the following month to end and my hype to be satisfied.

So, armed with my ticket, a bucket of popcorn and an inexhaustable supply of cool drinks I sat down unprepared for what was about to arrive.

For anyone even remotely educated with regards to Japanese culture this movie would be instantly labelled inaccurate and a misinterpretation of the Samurai warrior.  The movie is fraught with mistakes and a serious lack of understanding of what 'Honour' actually meant to a Samurai. For God's sake, not even the seppuku scene is done properly!!!

The acting, as with most Cruise movies, is about par, the only decent performance comming from Ken Watanabe for Katsumoto. The story is dry and lacks support, even with the special effecs, music and costume (Which are supprisingly good) it drags this movie, kicking and screaming, in to an adequeate 3 stars. The characters lack uniqueness and originality, making the movie a mission to watch, as they all follow the same predictable pattern. The genre is mixed, with no real consistency and tries dismally to blend it's bloodthirsty action/thriller nature with a more dramatic and historical theme.

There is very little to credit this film and it provides itself as another mere supplement for my love of Japanese orientated movies, will there ever be one that is is comletely satisfactory? Kids may enjoy this movie, as will the more bored or ignorant adults - but any educated man will steer clear of giving this excuse for a movie any praise.",1095897600,13,2061,4.794366197183098

2008299,4,B0001JXOVC,"This movie was very entertaining.  Fairly accurate from a historical perspective, the Last Samurai details Japan's change from a old school monarchy to a western influenced emerging power.  Tom Cruise plays a good washed up war hero, but the strongest performance is by Ken Watabe, who plays the 'last samurai.'  Beautiful filmmaking and landscapes dominate this fairly long and intense movie, making it great for a DVD.  Good, entertaining, well worth watching.  Joseph Dworak",1095120000,,477,5.391891891891892
2008300,2,B0001JXOVC,"There are some films that are so obvious and heavy-handed in their political correctness that even if one agrees with the sentiments expressed, one must hold ones nose to do so. ""The Last Samurai"" is a fine example of regard for another culture taken to such a superficial extreme that the result is smelly cardboard.

I suppose that a big budget film starring one of Hollywood's most self-important egos must adhere to the ugly-American-meets-epiphany-and-goes-native formula, but will one of these unctuous tomes please depart from formula long enough to at least follow through on its own logic?

This film is hypocritical in avowing its respect for Japanese culture. At least Kevin Costner created a coherent world in ""Dances With Wolves"". His Union soldier was largely an observer of the events of his time, and when he eventually left the Sioux nation, he had not single-handedly saved them from destruction or awakened them to their ancestral precepts. In ""The Last Samurai"", not only does the white hero receive an oriental spiritual transplant; he actually becomes the saviour of Japan. C'mon--gimme a break.

The Meiji Emperor was not a timid little weakling just waiting for the redeemed American to give him backbone and remind him of the wisdom residing within his own culture. And even if we were to suspend all disbelief and accept that the last surviving soldier on a particularly horrific battlefield should turn out to be our unlikely hero, it surpasses even the crudest naivety that the adversaries he has just decimated would throw down their arms and pay homage to him as the last samurai. That scene left a foul taste in my mouth.

Had this film truly honoured Japanese culture with the respect it professes to feel, the white hero would have died or at least turned out to be less than God's gift to Japan. Even Lawrence of Arabia ultimately failed to create his Pan-Arab nation, and that film could teach this one a lesson or two in how sensitively such themes need to be handled.

This film is not an abject failure. The performances by Ken Watanabe and Hiroyuki Sanada are superb and they do wonders within its shallow arc. Even Tom Cruise puts aside his most egregious excesses and serves up a passably sympathetic character. But even good performances cannot save this film from the consequences of its presumption. This is a do-gooder film that will go down well with historical revisionists and Champagne liberals who simply have to feel bad about the imperialist bits in America's past while congratulating themselves on how enlightened they are. For the rest of us, the falseness at the heart of this movie makes it impossible to enjoy it at anything but the most superficial level.",1094947200,14,2714,4.91703056768559
2008301,5,B0001JXOVC,"In the tradition of the Shogun miniseries, this movie paints a wonderful picture of life under the Japanese Samurai.  This time it is during a time of modernization in Japan.  Railroads and factories are being built.  A Japanese army is being started, armed by some US entrepenuers.  They hire Tom Cruise, an often drunk army captain, to go to Japan and train the army in the use of the new rifles and to learn American war tactics.

He starts training troops that can't hit a stationary target at all.  He is told that there is an uprising against the Japanese emperor by a band of Samurai.  Cruise is to take the vastly inexperience troops to kill them.  Cruise complains that they are not ready but he is told to leave immediately.

Cruise's regiment is easily wiped out by the attacking Samurai and Cruise himself puts up an enormous fight.  He is badly wounded but keeps fighting until he is unconscious.  Just before passing out, he kills one of the most fearsome Samurai warriors.

The head Samurai, fascinated to learn more about Cruise, spares him and sends Cruise to mend at his sister's house.  His sister just happens to be the wife of the fallen warrior.

Everyone in the village hates Cruise, and the woman is repulsed by the foreigner, who has shamed her by killing her husband.  Little by little, Cruise becomes fascinated with life in the village and the Samurai training.  He feels at peace and is cured of his alcoholic addiction.  As he becomes more skilled with the sword he starts to win the admiration of the Samurai and he bonds with the woman's son.

Cruise finally, earns his place in the village by being instrumental in driving back a ninja attack on the village.  Eventually, Cruise will have to face the emperor's army now armed with cannon and fully training in using rifles.

Great directing, action, and a riveting story.  One of the best films Cruise has made.  Just as good, if not better than the Shogun miniseries.",1094774400,4,1951,4.659824046920821

But that is not the only thing that there is plenty of; it combines action, adventure and concepts such as Honor and Tradition, as well as Change and Progress, making this movie one of the best of its kind, thus, resurrecting interest in oriental adventures after a long dormant period.

Tom Cruise, Ken Watanabe, and the rest of the cast, have outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least. The plot, the setting, the dialogues, the battles and the costumes are all wonderful! (Ken Watanabe really should have won the Oscar for his part in the movie!)

History, Honor, Battles, and swordfights are all about.

2008303,2,B0001JXOVC,"Recipe for instant Tom Cruise samurai flick: Take your basic samurai period drama, insert Tom Cruise, and water down liberally. Stir in cliches and do not season at all. The result? ""The Last Samurai,"" a very dull, colorless action flick set in Japan. It's not a good sign when the New Zealand scenery is the most striking thing about the whole thing.

It's the mid-1800s and times are a-changin' in Japan -- the modernization of the west (meaning the USA) is sweeping away the old ways. The Emperor gets an American veteran named Nathan Algren to help train his troops. Algren is an alcoholic, filled with angst because he killed American Indians, and he hates his new job.

Suddenly he's captured during an attack by samurai Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) and dragged back to his village. After going cold turkey, he begins to appreciate the old samurai code and ways, and begins to fall in love with a beautiful widow. Taking the side of his new allies, he sets out on a seemingly doomed attack, against the very people he was sent to help... and his own troops.

Even taken out of the historical context, ""Last Samurai"" is a deeply annoying film. It's laced with heavy-handed political correctness, complete with pointless insertions about American Indians and Custer. It's also  saddled with a surreally optimistic ending. Everying about it -- from Cruise's love interest to his change of heart -- is predictable, cliched and very corny.

While the film is SET in Japan, the actual shooting took place in New Zealand, giving it a lush, almost fantastical backdrop for all the action. Certainly it makes director Edward Zwick's job a bit easier, even if the film is saddled with some very stilted dialogue. (""And though it may forever be obscure to me, I cannot but be aware of its power."") And enough with the ""Bob"" comments.

Tom Cruise shows little emotion, and his character's alcoholic angst is almost laughably contrived. In fact, you may cheer when he gets beaten up. Ken Watanabe is what makes the film -- he has the presence of a future screen legend, and he plays Katsumoto with vulnerabilities and real feelings. This guy deserves to be the lead of such a film. Koyuki also shows incredible expressiveness as the widow Taka.

For a well-acted, well-directed film that happens to be set in Japan, check out the immortal samurai films by Kurosawa. Even merely taken on its own, ""Last Samurai"" is swamped in its own sense of self-importance. Watanabe and New Zealand are the best things about this film.",1094342400,9,2509,4.807424593967517

Cruise's background and personal torment are glossed over a bit - this could have been explored more, and his romance with the widow of the warrior he defeats in battle is left unresolved, but this is a great adventure story. Highly recommend!",1094083200,,521,5.141176470588236
2008305,5,B0001JXOVC,"I can't get enough of this movie. The Last Samurai is a powerful tale that stays with you. I can't get enough of this modern masterpice.

Capt. Nathan Algren(Cruise) is an Army veteran. He's become an alcholic and hates himself and frequently has flashbacks over some of the Indians he's killed. He's falling apart and things don't look great for him until he's offered a job by the ambassador of Japan Umura(Hamada).

The Emperor of Japan is modernizing the country and doing it very quickly. The Emperors former advisor Katsumota(Watanabe) doesn't like the old ways and is doing everything in his power to delay them. He is one of the greatest Samurai to ever live and is well respected and loved by his people. Umura nows Japan can't beat him so he convinces the Emperor that they must modernize so they can defeat Katsumoto.

Algren comes to Japan reluctantly. He hates Col. Bagley(Goldwyn) who is his superior officer in the operation. He's trying to train the Japanese men as fast as he can, but they don't have a enough time. Umura and Bagley order Algren to takes his men into battle against Katsumoto agains his will.

The fight between the armies is quick and very bloody. Katsumoto captures Algren after seeing the passion and fire in his eyes during battle. They take Algren back to their village for winter so Katsumoto can get to learn his enemy better.

Algren is treated fairly well by the people. They help him overcome his alcholism battle. He hates the place at first, but as he lives there and sees the discipline of the Samurai people he begins to accept and love their culture. He becomes friends with Katsumoto and gains respect from most of the village. Winter ends though and he must return to Tokyo.

Upon his return to Tokyo he sees the advance of the Japanese army. Umora has increased the spending of Japan in their arms and it's obvious he has lots of influence over the emperor. Umora is determined to kill the Samurai and Katsumoto. After a scuffle in Tokyo Algren returns with the Samurai to help prepare them in their last stand against the Japanese army.

The acting is phenomenal in this movie. Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe are amazing in their roles as Algren and Katsumoto. Cruise plays the role with passion and intensity. He does a great job displaying the change that Algren takes emotionaly and physically. He really did get cheated by not getting an Oscar nomination. This guy has done a lot for the movie industry and the academy but they continue to not pay him back. Cruise almost didn't do this movie because of his commitment to Cold Mountain. They didn't give the money he wanted so he became The Last Samurai.

 Ken Watanabe really shines in this picture. He isn't intimidated by Cruise at all and is equal if not better to him. He becomes Katsumoto and is amazing. He's funny, brave, charming, and smart all at the same time. He deserved the Oscar nomination he received and probaly should have won it. I'm excited about seeing Ken in the new Batman movie. This guy is great.

Edward Zwick really does a great job with this movie. The Last Samurai is produced by Cruises production company and they were the only man they wanted to direct this. Zwick has plenty of experience in this area of movies with Glory on his resume. He shots this movie well and it's all done in tastes. The fight scenes are shot especially well. The camera angles are great and we really get a good idea of how the Samurai fought. The violence isn't over done and you see the art that is sword play. Zwick has made a masterpiece.

A lot of people have bashed the ending of the movie. They think it's sappy and to happy. It's anything but that. If you pay attention to the movie and realize that Algren didn't fail his mission he has no shame. Algren loved Katsumoto and so did the Emperor so thats why we have that scene at the ending of the well. I found it to be a powerful ending to a dynamic film.

This is a great movie. It's so well made and attention is paid in it to the tiniest details. This movie will stay with you for days and all the good dramas do. If you like dramas or war films than you must see this film. If you love Tom Cruise you have to pick this one up. You won't regret buying this one.",1093996800,4,4236,4.4798962386511025

When Tom Cruise was captured in his village, we saw a kind, innocent and pure boy. When he was helping his father to escape, he became brave and determined. I was sad to see him fighting to his death. The diverse sides of this young man were well handled by the actor. You won't forget this movie after you watch it.

At first I thought this was going to be one of those ""face time"" movies just to get a paycheck for Tom Cruise, but to my suprise it was a great movie. While watching this movie I actually learned something, which I wasn't expecting, and that was that the samurai were alot like the native americans in the ways that they were removed from their own land. This is one of the best movies to come out in the last couple of years and a breath of fresh air compared to those movies like Master and Commander that claimed to be action movies but were really just ""face time"" for their leading man.",1093824000,4,674,4.232558139534884
2008308,3,B0001JXOVC,"In the last few years, epics have seen an amazing resurgence, climaxing in the classic ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy.  And most of the other epics have been staisfying as well, with ""Gladiator"" being but one standout.  But the Tom Cruise vehicle ""The Last Samurai"" it not one of the them.  Problems here start with the films bankable star.  The role of Nathan Algren is a challenging one, with emotional torture brewing behind his eyes and a sullen demanor in his walk.  But moments where Cruise hits these needed traits are few and far between.  Cruise plays Algren as a statue who poses as a heroic monolith for the camera, in other words Algren comes off as other characters Cruise has played in the past.  The only actor who stands out is Ken Watanabe, a Japanese actor who makes his english languange debut.  He brings a sense of dignity and intensity to the character of Katsumoto, a Samurai leader who is the last of a dying breed and a dying code

Perhaps you can blame the films' director, Edward Zwick (Legends of the Fall, The Siege).  Zwick lets the film drag between inspired moments and the whole film seems  overlong and ponderous, not to mention derivative.  Screenwriter John Logan (Gladiator, The Aviator) borrows one too many plot details from other films that came before him, especially ""Dances With Wolves.""  One tries to take the film on its own terms, but the similarities are too glaring.  Logan wanted the film to be a classic, but it falls far short.

That's not to say the film does not have its merits, which why ""The Last Samurai"" is so frustrating to watch.  When it does get good, it's breathtaking.  The $120 million production is a visual feast, with beautiful sets juxtaposed seamlessly with sweeping locales in Japan and New Zealand.  The film's visual pedigree is furthured by the wondrous cinematography of John Toll.  Toll, a two-time academy award winner, is a master at what he does.  The film is gorgeously shot and the hectically edited battle scenes are given a sense of clarity and extra punch, especially when set to Hans Zimmers' muscular score.  One only wishes that the reat of the film lived up to this high standard.  It could have been one of the best epics ever.",1093305600,,2213,4.678756476683938
2008309,4,B0001JXOVC,"I'm not a Tom Cruise fan. Actually the opposite is true. Also, knowing something of the Samurai and Samurai swordcraft, I automatically zoom in on the flaws and inconsistencies in those areas. This doesn't matter in movies like ZATOICHI, which are definitely tongue-in-cheek, but in something more serious like TLS it matters.

So I found myself pleasantly surprised that not only did I not mind Tom Cruise so much (after the first 15 minutes or so, where he overdoes the 'Tom Cruise' bits) and the sword work (bokken and shinken) was handled with an acceptable degree of authenticity. The movie also paid suitable homage to the Samurai, who on one hand carried with them the whole baggage of a feudal repressive culture, but who also embodied much of what one might call the 'spirit of Japan'. It's an ambiguous situation, where nothing's all good or bad, but when it ends like it did end there's a lot of pathos and sadness, no matter WHAT the merits or not.

This was well-handled and the movie made a real impact - on this reviewer anyway.

Aside from some breathtaking photography this film is dumbed down Hollywood trash. An insult to Japanese filmakers like Akira Kurosawa (Seven Samurai) and Hiroshi Inagaki (Samurai Trilogy) who's Samurai films have captured the hearts of audeinces worldwide.
Not only is this film a rip off of those directors but it's also a poor attempt at mimicing Hollywood epics like Braveheart. Probably the worst thing about this film is Tom Cruise's occaisional narration of his diary. What kind of warrior keeps a diary anyway? Isn't that for pansies? Anyway it serves as pointless drivel that mearly point's out the allready obvious. It's like they tried to make this film idiot proof. I think they should have focused on making it average joe/jane pissed off cause they spent 5 bucks to rent this crap proof.
The Characater development in this film was pretty much the same any Jean Claued Van Damme film. Last time I checked ""Kickboxer"" or ""Bloodsport"" didn't get nominated for any Academy Awards. I was just waiting for a training montage.

Amazingly, the rebels are right to despise 'western ways' in their desire to cling to 'traditional' beliefs. Guns, progress and capitalism aren't, apparently, the basis for inner peace.

2008312,3,B0001JXOVC,"Edward Zwick directs this 2003 film on a historical incident involving an American military advisor sent to Japan to modernize and train the ruling emperor's forces in 1876-1877. This is your typical Hollywood revised history where actual dramatic events are diluted with your conventional PC script and mandatory vapid love story.  Although the film has a decent cast with good direction and cinemtography, it's bogged down by a generic Hollywood screenplay and poor script.

Retired Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is fed up with the US Army and the Indian Wars.  Approached by a fellow veteran and nemesis (Tony Goldwyn), Algren accepts a lucrative offer to train the Emperor of Japan's forces along the modern standards of 1875.  Arriving in Japan, Algren's informed that the Emperor's traditional samurai warriors and their leader (Ken Watanabe) oppose all attempts to modernize Japan.  Believing that firearms are cowardly weapons, the samurai hold true to their Bushido code and continue to fight with their traditional weapons.  Disillusioned with his shame of the Indian wars he fought back home and eager to redeem his honor, Algren becomes enamoured with the ethos of Samurai warriors and so decides to join them for a final stand.

This was a good story that just never seemed to soar.  This is mostly due to a generic and predictable formulaic Hollywood script with cliche dialogue.  Does every drama have to conclude with an out-of-place happy romantic sub-plot to the likes of a 90210 episode?  Although a film about samurai warriors, the film only pays lip service to the teachings of the Bushido code with quick scenes of warriors committing hara-kiri and hardened Japanese men sitting stoically on their knees drinking sake. The dialogue is contrived and superficial: exploring only the surface of the Bushido code and Japanese culture.

In conclusion, the film is decent but comes far short of the epic it could have been.  Here, a great story was hampered by the inclusion of conventional modern plots that are at odds with the historical drama covered by the film.  The acting was decent but not terribly memorable due to a rather contrived script.  For a true rendition of the samurai code and feudal Japan, I would recommend films by Akira Kurosawa instead such as 'Ran', 'Kagemusha', or 'The Seven Samurai.'",1092614400,2,2334,5.091863517060368

The Last Samurai is a brave film that reveals the significance of the honor in the Samurai culture .
The script is very related in conceptual approach to Dance with wolves in which nathan concerns . He is an antihero a man committed with nothing except himself . He is a haughty man . A mercenary without scruples who accidentally will discover a new world and will receive a slap in the facewhen he discovers the ancient traditions of this warriors .
The ideological conflict between the ancestral ways of life and the modernity tradition will become in the central nervous of the film .
Ken Watanabe perfomance is the most remarkable character of this film . Filmed as a Sumphony in four moments , retains its interest all along the film except the conclusion , its only fault .
Do you really expect that the hero presence after the battle is necesary ? Do you imagine a hero being interviewed , and telling his old memories for instance? Is the last goal of a warrior to be happy ?

Tom Cruise's character ends up getting captured by the enemy, who are a civilization of samurai warriors who have chosen to uphold the ancient traditions of Japan.

Throughout the movie, there is a conflict of interest between the new and old traditions and it is interesting to see the ways of the samurai throughout the film.

Although he feels his new command is unable to fight, his superiors put the troops to the combat test. As they fail, Cruise is captured and taken captive by the samurai.

 Last samurai's a movie that brings to the western public a point of view very different about the way to live in the ancient Japan, bringing us back the lost proud of honor (with an eastern tonic). But the main message in the movie is not just see how the samurais fought in battelfield, and cut the throats of their enemies, or how the technology crushed the samurais, no this is not the real point or message, the big deal is that we must remember who we are and where we come from. Now if we look around the dressing, make up and efx, we can move into that age in the ancient Japan, and we learn an important message that master Tsu's ever told... Empty and Full, ""Empty is your enemy when he decides to attack you and you are waiting for his attack, so your troops are full and their troops are empty of energy"". The example of the Demopolis attack made by persians in the old Greece, was very accord with the last battle, when it's explained by Tom Cruise (Nathan Algren) to Ken Watanabe (Katsumoto)and he used the word ""million"" and 300, drawing to the samurai that: ""If you only fight because you want to win... you are lost, but if you are commited to die in the intent you will win more than the battle, you will get Honor and you will make that the reason to fight can be heared by those that you wanted to hear you.""

 This film is one of those ones that aspires to show everyone in a politically correct light and ruthlessly employs stereotypes galore to attempt to do it. The noble white man comes to the tiny idyllic remote village and is reformed and turned to the way of bushido by the kind and benevolent natives who come to respect him too. Even gets to fall in love with the demure ""perfect"" widow of the man he killed. And on top of that, he manages to change the mind of the emperor! How far we've come in making films that don't depict Asian stereotypes. -_-

 The historical problems with this film are huge, but then again it didn't claim to be a documentary. The real problems lie in the representation of women, and the romantization of the culture (everything from bushido to the army).

 There are some redeeming qualities, which include Ken Watanabe's excellent performance, and the beautiful and lush scenery/clothing which was relatively authentic. (I know most of this was shot in Canada...but the set pieces were very well researched)

 If you want a film with substance, start checking out films from people actually from Japan. Zatoichi, and Twilight Samurai (both currently playing in select cities) come to mind, or any of the works of Akira Kurosawa.

 Or for a different spin with beautiful visuals, check out China's Hero (soon to be released on the big screen here).",1091318400,11,1485,4.765625

And when I saw the commercials when this movie came out in the movies, I couldn't help but laugh. However after reading a bunch of good reviews, I decided to go see it. I was honestly blown away. It is a solid epic movie, which can drawn comparison to the blockbuster Gladiator (another of my favorites).

 This is a movie based solely around the notion of ideals. And the unique storytelling is what makes it an epic-type. Of course there is the great battle and everything that leads up to it will either make you love the movie or just utterly hate it. But what i found best served the movie was the fact that it didn't try to add any torrid romance to it. Thank goodness Zwick understood that making a movie about the morals of the Samurai and adding a couple extra sex scenes wouldnt work.

A set of characters move around in front of lavishly colored back-drops, say things to one another, asiatics murmur inscrutably and doll-like women tip-toe around like Fred Flintstone at a bowling alley. The only thing missing is the ""plinlinglinglingling"" sound of high piano keys to accompany their movements. What's that? You say I am being unfair? Again, I am not saying this is a bad film, it is just an humorless and a pointless one. It is not a dramatization of historical events, so... what could possibly be the point? It might as well depict some kind of Boxer Rebellion that takes place on the moon, wherin Buzz Aldrin, after being kidnapped by lunar monks, decides to throw in with them as they storm Apollo 11.

I will just say that this epic and beautfully written tale leaves you with a whole new respect for what samurais have done for the legend of Japan.

  Tom Cruise is simply phenomenal! This is his best performance on the silver screen by far. Also, his co-star Ken Watanabe who plays the leader of the samurai is better than your highest expectaions. As for the fighting, there are many great scenes that range from sword training to being raided by ninjas to the final bloody battle that can stand up to any other ever filmed.

I'm not an expert on early modern Japanese history, but as a journeyman I know enough to say with confidence that the story here is preposterous.  The Japanese looked to Germany (Prussia), not the US for army training.  Emporer Meiji, the greatest of their modern monarchs was a strong and decisive ruler (and wasn't referred to as Meiji until after his death, just as Hirohito is now referred to as Shoa).  The dramatizations and interplay of the characters, however, is what was really preposterous.  It may make for decent drama, but this is the sort of film that leads to typical American ignorance about foreign countries and their histories.  Anyone sincerely curious about this era in Japan might well read James Clavell's imperfect, but vastly better, Gai Jin or, better yet, Lafcadio Hearn's memoirs which point out that it was virtually impossible for a westerner to assimilate in late Nineteenth Century Japan.  The producers of this film ought to be profoundly ashamed of themselves over this script which is nearly as bad as the despicably similar Bushido Blade of about 20 years ago.

There are a lot of sword-fighting scenes, they're well-done, and if you enjoy watching them you'll find entertainment value in the movie.  Also, the Japanese countryside is filmed beautifully here, so if you have an appreciation for nature, it's another incentive to watch.
Otherwise, The Last Samurai is nothing special.  The storyline is simplistic; the samurai are all two-dimensional and unquestionably the fine and good people in the film.  They can do no evil, truly.  For Cruise it's one of those self-righteous roles where he gets to look angsty for the camera.  There's one scene at the end for example, where he's kneeling and holding up a sword, and he's trying to look like someone who is under great emotional strain and there are these ludicrous close-ups of his sweaty face - really gratuitous.

The atmospheric element in this movie is stunning; for example, the first charge of the samurai in that misty forest, is unforgetable.  I loved the ninja attack. This is one of the few recent productions in which the masculine is portrayed in a wholesome manner:  the warrior spirit, the camaraderie, the honor, and the respect for the inner peace that is brought by zen meditation practice, are brought out very well.
While the script was IMO kinda clichey & mediocre, Cruise's acting was not bad and rather subtle for a scientologist  :)  Zimmer's music was predictably good (if less conspicuous as in, say, Black Hawk Down) and if you're into kendo or swordsmanship, well, you will want to see this film several times.",1089936000,5,913,4.6397515527950315

2008334,5,B0001JXOVC,"""The Last Samurai"" is a breathtaking, historical, panorama that examines the blending of cultures and the clash of competing value systems. In this film, Tom Cruise plays Nathan Algren a twelve year old boy who has moved from New Jersey to the California Coast with his single mom. While adjusting to his new environment, Algren practices Bushido (the way of the warrior) from an instruction book and from a few introductory classes that he learned at the local YMCA in his hometown.
He also befriends a local girl who, unfortunately is hounded by her ex-boyfriend, an arrogant and aggressive teenager who cruises around town with his friend on dirt bikes. When the ex-boyfriend catches Algren and the girl together a fight ensues and Algren is beaten and humiliated. This prompts Algren to go to the local Bushido dojo where unfortunately he discovers that the ex-boyfriend is the star pupil and the instructor is a sadist.
Fortunately, Algren meets Mr. Miyagi an old Samurai warrior who works as a handyman in Algren's rental unit. When Mr. Miyagi realizes Algren's dilemma he takes him on as his lone pupil and teaches him the way of Bushido. Mr. Miyagi orders Algren to paint his fence, wax his car, and strike girlie-man poses on a post by the sea shore all the while promising that this will teach him how to wield a Katana like no other Caucasian man has ever done before.
And somehow it works. All of Mr. Miyagi's household chores turn out to be magic Samurai conditioning techniques that convert Algren into the Unstoppable White Warrior (UWW). From here an epic battle takes place between Algren and the ex boyfriend and his evil cohorts. I won't give away the outcome of this incredible battle scene except to say that Cruise does a lot of grunting, his eyes puff out during some of the more visceral moments of combat and his beard flutters in the wind like the calm of the butterfly.",1089763200,8,1896,4.748484848484848

The comparison to ""Dancing with Wolves"" is fairly accurate. Both movies argue the thesis that other cultures are inherently superior morally and spiritually to the spiritually bankrupt Western European/United States culture. There was a lot of spurting blood. The fight scene between ninjas and Samurai was good.
The clash of cultures was interesting. I do not know enough about the history of this period to judge its historical accuracy. I know the broad strokes were true. The Japanese Emperor hired Civil War veterans to modernize his armies and the Emperor had to put down the Ronans because they refused to modernize. There are probably far better Japanese movies of the period.

I may hear people complain about a few plot holes, but give the movie a break, guys. This is definitely one of Tom Cruise's best outings. One of his most emotional performances is given here. Ken Watanabe is astounding as the leader of the samurai clan that take Civil War vet Capt. Nathan Aulgren (Cruise) into their clan as a P.O.V. but he eventually learns to like their culture and becomes a samurai himself.

Colonel Bagley: I'm not asking you to kill anybody.
Algren: ""You want me to kill THE ENEMIES of Jappos, I'll kill THE ENEMIES of Jappos... Rebs, The Souix, The Cheyenne... For $500 a month I'll kill whoever you want. But keep one thing in mind, I'd gladly kill you for free."" Really makes you wanna hang around this guy, huh?

The Samurai armor and Katana swords in the film are beautiful, and Ken Wantanabe does a great performance in the film (I can't wait to see him as Ra's Al Ghul in Batman Begins). However, the story is downright twisted and innacurate. In real life, the Samurai were the BAD GUYS. They were arrogant and stuck up, and they were disgruntled because they were loosing their political status with the unification of Japan. The Japanese soldiers were brave, and fought valiantly and proved their worth against the Samurai in battle, and they won. The Samurai thought since they were ""lowly peasants"" they would be defeated without a struggle, but they were wrong. However, this movie completely twists around what really happened. The Samurai are portrayed as brave, moral men who want to preserve the Japanese culture and prevent ""westernization"" (which obviousely is something the director does not like), and the Japanese army is portrayed as cowardly weaklings, who the Samurai slaughter like Orcs from the Lord of the Rings. And for what? The Samurai openly admit that westernization and the extinction of Bushido is un-avoidable, so why do they see the need for a completely wasteful bloodbath that ends in hundreds of soldiers and Samurai dead? Considering how far this film goes out of it's way to be PC, you'd wonder why the Samurai heroes of the film decide to go on a suicide mission and waste hundreds of lives with no real purpose. What they've done to the Samurai in this movie is like if they made an Ivanhoe movie where the Normans are the good guys. It's just dumb.
However, there was the awesome fight scene where the Samurai have to fight with Ninjas. That scene alone boosts this film's score from 2 stars to 3.",1089504000,,1771,4.790849673202614
2008340,1,B0001JXOVC,"This film fails both historically and morally.
  The real Imperial Army was not inept and cowardly as shown in this film.  Every Japanese history textbook I've ever read says that the conscript soldiers were disdained by the haughty samurai, but that they proved their bravery and worth in the battles against them.  There's nothing in this film that shows the arrogance and contempt the samurai had for the ""dirt farmers"" whom they expected to easily defeat, but who stood their ground and shot them to pieces.  The samurai, incidentally, had just as many cannons and muskets as their opponents.  I cannot understand why the filmmaker had to make the samurai's enemies so evil and stupid, instead of portraying the war as a sincere clash of cultures between men who fought for what they belived in.
  Morally, it really hurt me to see Tom Cruise (Algren) wading so cold-bloodedly into the teenage troops he had been training six months ago and butchering them without the slightest compunction.  And there wasn't even any sort of remorse voiced by Cruise/Algren, even in a cliched, off-the-cuff sort of way (""Many brave men on both sides will die today."").  Maybe he hacked to death that poor, scared man he was trying to teach how to shoot earlier in the film.
  This is one of those films that, like ""The Patriot"", gets every cuff button and chin-strap of the costumes right, but fails to capture the spirit of an era and its people by resorting to black-and-white/good-and-evil cliches.

These kind of movies show you how violent and moronic we have grown nowadays, for we truly no longer count on our skills- all we do count on is machines and the accuracy of them instead. But the Samurai were true heroes, because they depended on their own strength and bravery. That's how all our ancestors fought, and unlike nowadays, they fought only for good reasons, such as the defense of their homelands, and their very honor.
I don't care what anyone says, Cruise was a great actor in this movie, but it's cool with Tom, for many scolded him as Lestat in Interview with the Vampire, and look how he excelled in that film. Played as a Civil War hero who you could say sank into a deep depression due to how he achieved his status as a hero, he is sent to Japan to teach the Japenese troops to use modern weapons for war. But opposing this modern weaponary is a group called the Samurai, who prove to be more than a mere group of rebels. Cruise becomes captive to the Samurai, and at first doesn't want nothing to do with them, especially the leader of the Samurai, Watanabe, but then naturally, he sees and learns that there was a whole other world outside of his, and it was a much more stronger and wiser world that his newly built world had forgotten long ago.
Cruise and Watanabe were both spectacular, and they both brung the movie alive. It was another war movie yes, and I've seen so many, but there was a lot more spiritual meaning to this film than with other war films, a much more profound meaning.
This was a truly captivating film to witness, and I recommend it to all.",1089158400,5,1683,4.380191693290735
2008343,2,B0001JXOVC,"I wrote a couple of lengthy reviews of this film, criticizing the romanticizing of the Bushido code and other aspects of this film.  For reasons unknown to me, Amazon declined to publish them.  So I will be brief:

This is a film for all those (and judging by my reading of Amazon reviews: they are legion) who loathe America and love a romanticized and fictitious culture peopled with wise and far nobler folks than we crass capitalists.  It is a false, pernicious, and short-sighted view of the world, history and the achievements and failings of human beings everywhere.  But it has a vast and gullible audience that eats it up. So, indulge yourselves once more.

Every culture and all people everywhere have their glories, delights, and their failings and shames.  God knows that is as true of Japanese history and culture as well as it is of American! The film deplores American cruelty and completely overlooks the cruelty inherent in the Bushido code and what it  meant to the peoples conquered by the Japanese.  This is not only biased, it is downright dishonest.

But, I make too much of what is typical Hollywood romanticized pap!  It looks pretty, it was well-made, the art direction was fine, and the performances were tolerable.  I couldn't get past the underlieing BS, but maybe you can.",1089072000,10,1301,4.8108108108108105
2008344,3,B0001JXOVC,"Ken Watanabe is amazing!! With his laconic ""I like this Custer"" he encapsulates everything that is both wonderful and horrible about the code of Bushido.
The cinematography is great, especially in all the battle scenes.  The scene when the samurai charge through the mist at the conscripts, but at first all you see is their fearsome outlines,  WOW! The scenes in the village when the samurai are training, and later, when the young archer holds off the ambush, are also beautifully shot.
The attention to detail in the costuming is fantastic. Ngila Dickson definitely deserves her two Oscar nominations, and could have won for either Samurai or ROTK.
But Tom Cruise was completely the wrong choice for his character. He is such a modern icon that he simply cannot play a period role. Everything about him (looks, voice, movement) stopped the movie dead in its tracks.
And some of the script was pretty lame, but this was the kind of movie you look at, not listen to. Subtitles over Hans Zimmer's always-great soundtrack wouldn't have been a bad choice.",1088985600,4,1053,4.877094972067039
2008345,4,B0001JXOVC,"As others have pointed out, the storyline here mirrors Dances with Wolves.  So much so that it's a little hard to give the rest of the movie credit for the original parts it does well.  But taken on its own, I feel it merits four stars.
I generally like Tom Cruise's movies, so I didn't have a problem watching him in this role.  Cruise is a talented actor, although he basically plays every part the same way, so he offers nothing terribly new here.  Still, he turns in a fine--if somewhat typical--performance.
The other actors in this movie were well cast.  Much has been made about Ken Watanabe's performance.  I thought it was strong but disagree with others who felt he overshadowed Cruise and everyone else.  Those who were seduced by this romanticized portrayal of Samurai culture were probably left more inclined to gush over his performance.
Along those lines--in the special features of this DVD, there was an interesting comment made by a military historian.  He rightly pointed out that the Samurai were, in essence, the 'bad guys' in this conflict.  They were fighting for a caste system that did not respect women's rights or democratic ideals.  While such a lifestyle may be beautiful to view on the screen, living it is a different matter entirely.  There is much to admire about that culture, but there is much to detest, as well.
[Warning: SPOILERS in next paragraph]
Apparently, some found the ending to be ""maudlin,"" but unless you felt the same about movies like Braveheart or Last of the Mohicans, I doubt you'll agree.  Yes, it's typical Hollywood fare, but no adjective approaching ""maudlin"" came to mind.  Overall, I felt it was a dramatic and appropriate ending in keeping with some earlier themes (not to mention the title of the film).  My one complaint about the ending was the poor battlefield tactics used by the Samurai.  Cruise already knew the Imperial troops had Howitzers and gattling guns, yet the Samurai made no effort to address those threats in the battle (a detachment of cavalry could have swung around and attacked their flank to neutralize them).  This costly mistake was inconsistent with the earlier portrayal of Cruise's character as being skilled in the art of modern warfare.
All in all, this is an entertaining film with some nice cinematography and exciting action sequences.  Enough to warrant additional viewings and justify the DVD purchase in my book.",1088985600,2,2408,4.891625615763547
2008346,4,B0001JXOVC,"I cannot say enough about this movie. A lot of people were turned off before they even saw it because Tom Cruise plays a samurai. I say their loss. This was a fantastic story about a man whose past haunts him. He plays an American soldier who is captured by the enemy whose culture he is supposed to be helping destroy and the experience changes his life forever. The story was fantastic, the scenery was gorgeous, the costumes were exquisite, the acting was phenomenal. This movie is definitely on my 10 best of 2004.",1088899200,3,518,4.5212765957446805

2008348,5,B0001JXOVC,"""The Last Samurai"" is one of the greatest historical epics of our generation. The battle scenes are created with great action and detail, as are the solo sword fights. And while the action is breathtaking, they only help to tell an amazing yet somber story of honor, sacrifice and change. Tom Cruise gives what is possibly the performance of his career, and Ken Watanabe gives an Oscar-worthy performance as Katsumoto (He was robbed at the Oscars). While I haven't yet had time to view the special features, none are really needed, for this film could stand on its own! Any fan of true film will want this epic in their collection! Movie/DVD Grade: A+",1088726400,4,651,4.719298245614035
2008349,4,B0001JXOVC,"Until the ending (which a previous reviewer correctly described as ""maudlin""), Edward Zwick's THE LAST SAMURAI is a magnificent samurai epic, filled with great big emotions but also blessed with more thoughtfulness and intimacy than the usual Hollywood epic. The insights into Japan during this particular time setting---the late 1800s, when the samurai way of life was slowly fading away and Westernization was taking over---are sure to fascinate, and the action scenes are first-rate, as is the widescreen cinematography here by John Toll.
Ken Watanabe got justly deserved plaudits for his authoritative supporting turn here as samurai leader Katsumoto---he really takes the screen by force. A lot of critics, for some reason, weren't so complementary to Tom Cruise, as the American Nathan Algren, here. Perhaps they thought his pretty-boy image got in the way of either the epic's grand ambition or the effectiveness of his own performance. Whatever the reason, I personally didn't have such problems with Cruise in this movie---he seemed convincing enough here, although he certainly is upstaged by the sheer authority of Watanabe's performance.
In short, THE LAST SAMURAI is overall a grand and glorious epic that admirably attempts to be more than just pretty pictures and awesome action scenes, and, more often than not, it succeeds in its noble ambitions. If the ending does come off as too preachy or over-sentimental in the usual Hollywood manner---well, I find it a forgivable lapse, indicative of the filmmakers' desire to function as both thoughtful historical commentary and great entertainment at the same time. I don't think many people will be bored by this movie (like many many people seem to be with LOST IN TRANSLATION). Recommended.",1088640000,,1754,5.31294964028777
2008350,2,B0001JXOVC,"I just recently saw this movie for the first time.  When it first heard about it, I was somewhat sceptical about the movie, thinking that it would simply be another distorted Hollywoodization of an historical event or historical period.  I subsequently read reviews that claimed that it was in fact a great movie, a cut above as it were, and that the movie was sensitive towards Japanese culture etc.  In particular what I found most interesting was the claim that the movie was not the typical Western film where Western values are proven superior--that the reverse is in fact the case here.  But still, I was sceptical, and did not concern myself with the movie until just a few days ago.  All things considered, I think I was justified in my scepticism; while there were aspects that I found to be good and commendable (the majestic landscape, quite stunning combat sequences), for the most part I just did not find it to be a good film.  It is essentially a Hollywoodization, regardless of the unique twist to the story.",1088640000,5,1024,4.692737430167598
2008351,5,B0001JXOVC,"The Last Samurai is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  It was a blockbuster smash in Japan.  It tells the story of the Samurai of Japan and how they became obsolete due to westernization of their country.  Although the last scene with the emperor concerning his decision whether to fully open Japan to the West is pure fiction, the rest is generally accurate.  The director seeks to romanticize the samurai.  The samurai traditions and culture are not that difficult to romanticize.  Everything they stood for is portrayed in the film.  Watching it, you yearn to add these values to your own life, and feel achingly their loss to today's society.  This is the true value of the film - to raise the samurai once again, in their full glory of life, and the strange glory of their deaths.
The climactic scene of the final battle between the samurai and the new army is predictable, yet still horrifying.  You just wish it could end differently.  Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe are glorious.  Watanabe received a Best Supporting Actor nomination.  I feel The Last Samurai should have received more nominations, and at least one Oscar.
In real life, the last of the samurai did indeed perish in a last-stand battle against the new military.  They were led by a samurai general who died in the battle.  He is now a hero in Japanese legend and culture.",1088640000,3,1349,4.637130801687764
2008352,4,B0001JXOVC,"Ray Bradbury once wrote a short story about medieval knights jousting with an oncoming train.  Naturally, they got flattened.  The story was an allegory of old versus new, modernism versus traditionalism.  This movie is that short story expanded to feature length and moved to the Orient.  In the place of the medieval knights is a true historical figure, Saigo Takamori, who led a rebel army to glorious defeat in the Satsuma Rebellion, a futile insurrection against the Japanese government during the early days of the Meijin Restoration.
As far as history is concerned, about the only thing the movie got right was Saigo's last valiant (or quixotic) mounted charge into the murderous firepower of the modern Japanese Army.  Saigo was not the reactionary champion of Samurai privilege and custom that the movie depicted.  He was one of the chief architects of the dismantling of the Shogunate and the dragging of Japan kicking and screaming into the modern world.  For a time, he was even the commander in chief of the modern Japanese Army.
Many are recognized as great decades after their death.  Saigo was that rare individual who was rightly recognized as great by his contemporaries.  It makes for a fascinating story to learn how such a man could end up dying in a futile rebellion against the government he helped to create.  But you won't find it in this movie.  For the real story of Saigo, read ""The Last Samurai: The Life and Battles of Saigo Takamori,"" available from Amazon.com.
While the movie got the sequence of events and the motivations of the protagonists wrong, the scenery, costumes, and weaponry appeared to be quite authentic.  Most Samurai of Saigo's time practiced swordsmanship with cane swords.  This practice lives on in Japan in the sport of Kendo.  Saigo, however, subscribed to a school of swordsmanship that prescribed the use of hardwood sticks.  The movie accurately depicts Saigo's disciples practicing with hardwood sticks.  Watching the movie depiction of that practice readily shows why most Samurai used cane swords.
Another area the movie got right was the archery with the assymetrical bow.  When we Westerners think of Samurai, we think of them as swordsmen.  The Samurai were primarily archers, and the movie accurately reflects the importance of archery to the Samurai.
Notwithstanding the many inaccuracies of the movie, it is a stirring adventure of epic proportions, and quite enjoyable viewing.  To borrow a phrase from another source, it is a movie for guys who like movies.  Just remember as you watch this very good movie, it is not, I repeat, not history.",1088553600,9,2608,5.02093023255814

2008367,3,B0001JXOVC,"First off, let me state that this is an enjoyable film to watch.  It is entertaining and truly worth a watch.  However...
It is basically a rehash of Dances with Wolves (check out the Samurai village and the Native American references): unhappy, unsatisfied white guy finds himself in an exotic (to him) culture and, much to his surprise and everyone else's, he finds his salvation there and goes native.  Not only does he find his salvation there but he becomes their savior against the white people who are corrupting such an idyllic culture.  Apparently, the world needs more white guys to save them (and everyone else) from themselves.
I suppose, in this day and age, American history is being rewritten and our guilty consciences of our ignorance of other cultures leads us to make movies such as this one.  We have misunderstood other cultures for far too long and it is up to the American film industry to make American movies to help Americans understood how wrong Americans have been!
The pretense is that this movie is meant to honor the Samurai.  We see the serenity of the idyllic life of the Samurai, the happy children, the Buddhist chants and all that other stuff that falls just short of stereotyping.  It feels as if someone studied the Samurai in books (and old Samurai movies) and wrote a movie about it, trying to give it a twist.  But it all centers around Tom Cruise.  The Samurai in the end are pretty much props.  In the end it feels a bit, well, pretentious.  And predictable.
The action scenes are fun to watch (though Kill Bill's got this one beat) and fantasize a bit about such an idyllic life.  But it's been taken just a bit too serious.  But still worth a watch.
By the way, The Gods Must Be Crazy covers this ground (what happens when two cultures collide) with a more comical, intelligent and subversive spin.",1088208000,4,1843,4.633846153846154
2008368,4,B0001JXOVC,I liked it. The ending wasn't bad. A lot more of the movie was spoken in English than I was expecting. The swordfights are really realistic and graphic. It's something that Jackie Chan wouldn't have even been able to handle. There was a fairly decent number of parallels with Dances with Wolves.,1088208000,,295,4.6923076923076925
2008369,5,B0001JXOVC,"wow, this movie was great... im serious, everyone should watch this movie. it was brilliant. It's about Tom Cruise, he starts to train a Japanese army and then during a battle between his troop and the saumrai he killed a samurai and then he is taken prisoner with the samurai but they are kind to him and stuff. well eventually, he makes friends and what not with the samurai and he goes to battle on their side. i cryed so hard in so many parts of the movie. it was just so beautiful. and i laughed at some of tom's lines. he really isn't such a bad actor nd this is by far his best movie yet. and the action scenes (being a tru fan of patriot,braveheart, and saving private ryan) were filmed really well.
 it's true, this may not depicted what it was really like but i don't know why so many people are criticizing this movie. alot of people are saying its an insult to japanese to think that an american is the last samurai after a little while of learning. calm down! my best friend is asain and she cryed and loved the movie! it was not insulting to her nor her mother! i wouldnt mindif americans were wiped out in battle and the only one left was an asain who adopted western ways. i'd be proud that soeone survived and passed on the legacy of my people. that whole idea is a bunch of racist crap and stop overreacting!!!!
i didn't think the movie was slow either. every part was beautiful and filled with depth and emotion. there was no way the editor could delete ANY scenes that were in the finished product because they were all necessary and lets face it... BRILLIANT!
and alot of people are saying the characters weren't well developed but cant u see: their relationship with tom says a thousand words.
alot of peolpe don't understand why the wife of the samurai that tom killed and tom slept together either... unromantic fools! didn't u see the tension! omgomgomg... their relationship was an element htat is inexplicable, yes... but still, its there and its beautifula and some things in life are better left alone and unexplained...
in conclusion, may i say again: I LOVE THIS MOVIE... (the dvd contains gr8 special features, too!) and anyone who thinks this movie is anything less of gr8 is an idiot who doesnt know a movie from a mojo...buy it buy it buy it!!!!! NOW!!!

I was pleasantly surprpised. Very pleasantly.
First off, Mr. Cruise did a pretty decent job. His japanese was very good for a non-native speaker, and he seemed to slip into his role snugly. His dialogue was even humourous at times, and he was able to do the fight scenes so that it looked genuine.
However, Ken Watanabe deserves the most credit - he was funny and sarcastic. He was able to deliver funny lines without even a change in his facial features, which makes it all the more humourous.
Overall, the film was very well executed, there was some comedy, which helps you to maintain your sanity while you're sitting at the edge of your seat and biting your fingernails. A movie that truly plucks at your heartstrings as it presents the possibility of the extinction of a beautiful culture.",1087948800,4,973,4.662790697674419
2008371,3,B0001JXOVC,"Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), a washed-up Civil War vet tormented by guilt and swimming in a fug of alcoholism, gets recruited to train and modernise the Japanese Imperial Army. Times are a-changing in the Land of the Rising Sun: in the fervour of the Meiji Restoration, everything Western is very much ""in"" which, sadly, means that the game's up for the country's samurai, who have kept the nation in a vicegrip for the past few centuries. Some, however, aren't willing to go down without a fight, and so it is that Algren finds himself, in command of a motley and ill-trained force, facing-off against rogue samurai leader Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). Suffice to say that things don't go entirely as planned, and Algren finds himself defeated and taken hostage by Katsumoto's samurai band. His captivity, though, proves to be the source of his redemption, as he adopts the customs of the samurai and ultimately joins them in their final stand against the Imperial forces.
It's all a bit Dances With Wolves but, although The Last Samurai isn't in the same league as that movie, it remains an engaging and watchable, albeit flawed, epic. Those hoping for an authentic depiction of pre-modern Japan should look elsewhere (Akira Kurosawa's films, and the recent Twilight Samurai, would be good places to start) - this is samurai culture re-tailored for a Hollywood audience. The samurai are depicted as peace-loving folk, with no reference made to the crushing feudal regime they imposed; meanwhile, Watanabe's Katsumoto, despite being vehemently opposed to the Western forces encroaching on his beloved country, speaks fluent English - a tad ridiculous, to say the least. The idyllic village to which Cruise's character is whisked away looks more like something out of Lord of the Rings - indeed, much of The Last Samurai was filmed in New Zealand; the country vistas look nothing like Japan, past or present.
All of this didn't stop the film from winning-over much of the native audience here, mind you, leaving only us gaijin to scoff at the inconsistencies. When you compare it to the likes of Braveheart and Gladiator, too, it starts to feel a little unfair to chastise The Last Samurai for the numerous historical liberties it takes. Hey, at least the Japanese characters actually speak some Japanese.
If you can overlook the inaccuracies (and I'm sure the average viewer would be happy to), The Last Samurai is a pretty entertaining watch. Cruise turns in a decent performance - moody, strained, with the faintest whiff of trying-too-hard - but it's Watanabe who provides the most compelling screen presence. His Katsumoto is a dignified, commanding figure, whose commitment to the ancient Bushido samurai code (which, with its ""let's rush headlong towards a bloody and unnecessary death!"" mantra, is more than a little unpalatable to Western audiences) seems utterly believable. Director Edward Zwick comes up with some exhilirating set pieces, too: the final battle is well-staged, but it's a ninja assault on Katsumoto's village midway through the film that leaves the most lasting impression.
The Last Samurai is by no means a great movie: it's too long by far, the introduction of a love interest is painfully contrived, and - crucially - it doesn't pack the emotional punch that Kevin Costner managed in Dances With Wolves. The death of the samurai culture was, let's face it, neither as tragic nor as unfair as that of the Native Americans - Zwick and co may try to have us believe otherwise, but it's a disingenuous pitch, to say the least. What you're left with is a handsome and entertaining movie - a bit hollow at the core, maybe, but well worth a watch.",1087862400,2,3674,4.985342019543974
2008372,5,B0001JXOVC,"This movie, was incredible, simply put.  Such a mix of romance and honor, all beautifully blended together.  Tom Cruise does a WONDERFUL job in this film, playing a troubled man who took part in killing innocent indian tribes, who takes a job in Japan training japanese soldiers who would be trained to supress rebel forces led by Samurai Katsumoto, who believed that Japan was progressing into modern culturization too fast, and resisted political advisors that were urging the Emperor to do just that, become more western, and modern.  Katsumoto's tribe of Samurai defeat the  unit led by Capt Algren (Cruise) and capture him.  He is held in captivity with the Samurai, and thrives off the peace that is afforded him there.  He begins dwell in the same way he observes the people do in the village, and learns honor with the help of Katsumoto.  In the battle preceding his capture, Algren kills Samurai Horutoru,  Katsumoto's brother in law, and his caretaker Kata's husband.  During his time in this village, Kata is repulsed by Algren, troubled with the death of her husband.  As cruise learns the ways of these people, and japanese, he gives his formal apology to Kata, who surprises him by replying that he did his duty, and so did her husband, and that the apology was accepted.  As his status as a 'stray dog' is gently brushed aside, he gradually becomes accepted.  When an assassin team of ninja attempt to kill Katsumoto, he refutes his american heritage and helps keep Katsumoto alive.  In the end, as a desperate attempt at saving the village in which Katsumoto's ancestors had worked so hard to build and protecet, Katsumoto and Algren lead an army of Samurai warriors against the rebuilt japanese army.  Witnessing this scene was so sad.  A doomed attempt.  Since Samurai refuse to bear firearms, they were vastly at a disadvantage, against the cannons and the new automatic turrets.  As a final test of honor, the remaining samurai charge the army, only to be vicously mowed down in the heat of battle.  In a final touching moment,  Algren and Katsumoto, wounded, Katsumoto perhaps fatally, contemplate Katsumoto's suicide in honor, only to end in the deed being done and Algren witnessing the utmost peace in death in honor.  He Presents Katsumoto's sword to the emperor,  who realizes that he had been wrong to let his 'advisors' lead him around too much, and that it was wrong to forget his honor.

2008373,4,B0001JXOVC,"This movie is a very interesting look at opportunism, guilt and shame on the one hand and opportunity, pride and honor on the other.  The irony throughout the movie was a comparing of these things within two cultural frameworks.  The clash between the old world being encroached upon by a new world.
The comparison between the opportunism of the US against the native American tribes compared to the resistance of the old world Japanese Samurai was fascinating to say the least.  The characters that were played by Watanabe and Cruise were very much linked through similar issues but from vastly different persepectives.
Cruise plays a US Calvary Captain (Nathan Algren) who is tormented by his past and when he goes to Japan on a mercenary mission to assist the Emperor's minions in defeating the last hold out of the old ways he is forced to see himself and the world he is from through a different lens.
The cavalier versus the discipline and strength of the Samurai are showed over again.  Algren goes through a metamorphasis of sorts.  It is a different look at the issues of east versus west.
At varying points in the film, Algren is seen going through a conflict in his mind that torments him.  He is seen running from and with this scene playing within his psyche at all times.  His torment reaches it's climax in his captivity.  That is where the story changes and a man is free.
The issues that contain the ironies are things to look for, the western ways of expediency and convenience versus the eastern ways of patience.  Katsumoto (Watanabe) has a righteous anger, yet you need to listen carefully to his raging with the Emperor.....
Algren finds himself in a new world and a new mentality.  I was left to wonder if there is a metaphor regarding today's east verse west conflict.  Today, some of the west come to adopt eastern ideology and even side with those in conflict with their societies.  It seems more that Cruise is accepting a cause than anything else and releases himself from his torment.
The movie reflects a full range of emotion from sorrow, to anger to love and deep reflection.  This is rated R yet only for the violence and some language, there is no sex, no nudity and very little language and some of what is spoken is almost humorous.  Billy Connoly looks like John Cleese.  He has a few lines that come across funny to a degree.
Tony Goldwyn plays Cruise's alter-ego who stays in character throughout.
The battle scenes, from the two larger battles to the one small skirmish are pictured very intensely.  I wonder if the scenes showing the battle between the Samurai and the newly formed Japanese army are really a reflection of the American Indian fighting the US Army in the great Indian wars.  It is from the same timeframe and to me it seems possible that the message was easier to get across so that it would be acceptable for those who are resistant to politically correct messages.
The basic story though is well thought out and well presented.  I would have rated it a 5 and many would do so as well, yet the ""BraveHeart"" type violence to me is getting a little worn thin.  The sheer violence of the small battle that ensued in Tokyo was enough to show intensity and bravado. The scene of hand to hand combat was appropriate and realistic.  I particularly was impressed with the intense desire to live shown in that scene.
The sensation of emotion is very intense in this film and sensationalism was not necessary for me.
I will watch this movie again and will add it to my wish list.",1087862400,5,3527,4.6128
2008374,1,B0001JXOVC,"At every opportunity this movie failed in the presentation of its larger themes.  To begin with, the presentation of honor, as illustrated through the statements and military tactics of the rebel samurai leader, demonstrated a grotesque misunderstanding of the term.  The idea that honor somehow requires a military leader to ignore cutting edge military technology, i.e. firearms, or to blindly charge forward at a numerically superior and better armed foe is laughable.  Furthermore, the healing power of love can hardly be demonstrated by a widow who jumps in bed with her husband's killer before his corpse is even cold, even if the killer is Tom Cruise.  On a side note, I could hardly restrain my laughter when Cruise's character appears in the doorway of the widow's house wearing her husband's armor.  Regarding the below comments about the racially insensitive aspects of this movie, I completely agree.  If I was Japanese, I would be annoyed at how Tom Cruise's American character, after spending only a short time in the samurai village, ultimately holds himself out to be the highest exponent of the samurai virtues and then presumes to instruct the Emperor on how to act.  I get hot under the collar when Europeans comment about how Americans should act or vote.  I can only imagine that people of Japanese citizenship or descent would have a similar reaction to the manner in which samurai culture was depicted in this film.",1087862400,13,1438,5.012605042016807
2008375,5,B0001JXOVC,"Okay, first off I want to say that this was a great movie, great acting and directing, great battle scenes and beautiful Japanese scenery. Many people say this is Dances With Wolves, yes the plot is slightly the same, but I watched Dances With Wolves, I have almost never watched such a boring movie, If The Last Samurai is this, it is certainly a much less boring version. And many people complain about how Tom Cruise doesnt die at the end, well 'It was not his time' as Katsumoto explained numerous times in the movie. And the reason the children and Taka fall in love with Tom is that they forgave him for killing their father/husband, they beleived they where both warriors that did their duty on the field, and they certainly believed that their way of life was worth fighting for. I would think that the way of the samurai or Bushido was worth fighting for, especially back then. As Tom said 'What could be more necissary?'",1087689600,8,930,4.541666666666667
2008376,5,B0001JXOVC,"I don't go to the theatre that often anymore.  I don't have to drive, waste gas, have a headache finding a parking space, waiting in line and spend enough for two tickets to buy a DVD (and that does not include the Pepsi and popcorn!).  I won't mention the chewing gum and sticky cola coated floors!  For all that, I can get two DVDs and watch it as many times as I like!  I love to watch a movie several times, study it, what makes it work, what really irritates the second or third time.  Watch actors conjuring magic.  Another reason, I really curtailed my going - PR and hype - I would get all this PR pushing you to go, press and reviewers assuring you what a great movie such and such was.  I would rush to go and ended up feeling like one of P.T. Barnum's suckers.  Not only did I pay the money that would get me two DVDs, I felt the movie was NOT worth it!
So, when all the hype about the LAST SAMURAI came down, Oscar nominations, I held back going, wait for DVD.  Everyone kept assuring me I would LOVE this film, with its historical background that it would be my cup of tea.  However, Tom Cruise was a sticking point.  I was blown away from Tom Cruise stealing the thunder from Timothy Hutton (a talented actor whose work I appreciate) in TAPS.  Cruise was brilliant in the small role and everything pointed to him being a great actor.  Instead, Cruise became a ""star"".  There is a BIG difference between a great actor and a superstar.  And Cruise seemed content to flash his killer smile and coast by, rather than step up the plate and hit ""a home run"".  This has always tarnished his performances - to me - I hate to see great talent not reach their potential.  So I had that reservation going into the LAST SAMURAI.
It was breathtaking to see the film where he FINALLY stopped being Cruise and go for the golden ring.  This film saw him, for once, not playing Tom Cruise, but actually forgetting he was Cruise.  He became Nathan Algren, a mentally weary warrior who was sickened by the aftermath of Little Big Horn, a warrior who has lost all honor, and it's slowly eating away inside him, crippling his whole life.  He is recruited to go to Japan to teach their soldiers how to fight.  Cruise is still hanging on by his fingernails mentally, because he is serving under the very man he hold responsible for Indian Massacres  who once again cares little about lives, and orders Algren to take the unready troops to face the mighty Samurai.  Cruise is equipped with reasonably modern weapons - I say reasonably, because they are still musket loaders instead of the repeating rifles that came out of the Civil War, such as Sharpes and Winchester.  Still, the arrogant commander feels even the unready troops could put down a rebelling from a few hundred warriors with swords and bows.  Cruise unit finds out differently, as they are nearly wiped out.  Cruise goes down fighting as a true warrior and earns the awe and admiration from the Samurai leader Katsumoto - beautifully played by Ken Watanabe.  Katsumoto is not fighting against his Emperor, rather fighting the advisors around him wishing to exploit Japan.
Katsumoto takes Algren back to his mountain strong hold, heals him.  He is a prisoner, but basically allowed the run of the compound.  As he slowly comes out of his nightmares and drunken stupors, he finds a world that is built on honor, something he long ago lost.  The people are gentle, live by a code and do not fear death - if it comes with honor.  He gradually joins the warriors training and earns the love and respect of the Samurai, and comes to love them in return.  They go forward knowing they are out numbered, out gunned, but in the timeless way of the Samurai, they face death with honor in order to make a statement.
It is beautifully filmed, deftly directed with a true understanding of the subject, and Cruise and Watanabe are brilliant.
It just does not get any better than this (though I would have loved to see Viggo have Cruise's role!)",1087603200,2,3986,4.485436893203883
2008377,1,B0001JXOVC,"This is the most upseting movie I have ever watched in my life. I was brought to tears long after the movie was through. And why people like this movie is beyond me. How is it that so many movies follow the same paths? The last of the Mohicans, Dances with Wolves, The hunted, The Mexican...I mean what's up? These movie really do ponder the white man's ego. How is it that at the end of the battle scene Tom Cruise is left alive while the rest of the samurai were massacred? How? Tell me. And how is it that Taka and her children fell in love with the man that murdered the most important man of their lives. And people claim this is such an amazing tribute to the Japanese culture. Thats to someone that is completely ignorant. First off, a person should already be proud of their heritage, and what great tribute is there? Sure they make the samurai seem like peaceful people, but why then is it that a foriegner that learned little in a few months was able to survive and become the last samurai. It was all BS. This was one of the most hurtful movies that I have ever watched in my entire life. And I pity anyone that thought this movie was great. I feel sorry for every culture out there that was ever massacred by the American films. A person will never truly understand until it hits them. How would someone like it if Uma Thurman was the Last Pinay, or Charlize Theron was the Last Indian, or Tobey Mcguire was the Last Mexican, or Eminem is the Next 2pac, etc. No one would like it one bit. I bet if somewhere in Asia they made some Asian man the Last of the Americans, everyone would hate it forever. Everyone would murder those movies. But no one ever stops to think about how hurtful such a ""wonderful"" movie can be. So next time you think this movie is so great and you think people are overreacting, ask yourself this, how would you feel if you were in their place?",1087603200,15,1880,4.26890756302521
2008378,2,B0001JXOVC,"The production values were terrific. Tom Cruise was as always very watcheable, but this is a mediocre movie. It's a Japanese 'Dancing With Wolves', without the originality, dialogue or artistic vision.

The basic theme here is shallow and historically ill-conceived.  In the 1850's Admiral Perry's expedition brought enormous change and the downfall of the traditional Samurai caste system of the Edo period. But the old system was very cruel and arbitrary, and had outlived it's usefulness.

Watanabe's Feudal lord is charming and complex, but ultimately he's an anti-tech Luddite.  His position was xenophobic and short-sighted.  In one sad scene, a young samurai is forcibly arrested & has his hair cut and his sword confiscated..  It's heartbreaking, unless you know that the sword represented the samurai's traditional right to kill commoners with impunity.  That was their ancient birthright - hardly something most Americans would defend.

Another part: The highest ideal in Bushido was loyalty and Death before Surrender. This honor-code and Monarchy-worship would continue, and years later would grow into the proto-Nazi claptrap which lead to expansion before WWII, vast numbers of unecessary suicides during the war to avoid surrender, kamakazees, etc.  It is a philosophy with no flexibility or humanity, and is now thankfully extinct in the modern Japanese mainsteam.

Celebrating these ideas here feels unhealthy, and Tom Cruise's 'going native' into that Samurai version of Shangri La did not impress me either as a spiritual journey or as a safe and practical idea.

We were supposed to root for the guys going into battle against Gatling guns with swords.. These guys were Dodo birds fighting the dogs.  They never had a chance, and their certain demise was not very entertaining or uplifting - it felt more like the unfolding of a preventable tragedy.

I also didn't understand the implicit veneration of the Emperor that is meant to be shared by the audience.  Americans don't agree with this worldview, although they might have bowed to the Emperor out of protocol and custom at the time.

In the end, the emperor shows some remorse and changes his mind.. whoopie.  An 18 year old King reconsiders his position.  The characters cared.  I didn't.",1087516800,9,2265,5.227146814404432
2008379,5,B0001JXOVC,"This movie is an exquisite masterpiece of cinematography and direction. The Academy missed its important message and passed on an excellent acting performance by Tom Cruise.
Filmed in New Zealand it takes on the persona of 19th century Japan. The villages and costumes are so authentic that you are transported back into a beautiful time, with lush vegetation and a purity of living. The film is soothing and spiritual despite the battle scenes.
Tom Cruise plays a civil war captain who has lost his integrity after fighting and killing Indians alongside of General Custer. He becomes a drunk wallowing in drink rather than deal with the guilt and trauma of war. A Shogun, working for the Emperor of Japan, employs his expertise in war to train the Imperial Army. During this time in history the Emperor was trying to modernize Japan and defeat the control that the Samurai had over his land. Because of the heartfelt beliefs of the Samurai's they rejected a modern Japan feeling as though a ""western"" culture would bring too much distance from true integrity. After watching this movie you may think differently about the enforcement of democracy on a culture steeped in ancient values.
The battle scenes are epic and real, extreme attention is given to each and every detail. The warrior costumes appear historically accurate and a tribute to the Samurai culture. Cruise is captured in battle by the Samurai and eventually adapts to the culture that heals his integrity again. The sword fighting scenes are flawless and powerful. His adaption into this ancient society is impressively spiritual and he gains his belief in himself through code of the Samurai: Honesty & Justice, Duty & Loyality, Polite Courtesy, Compassion, Complete Sincerity, Heroic Courage and Honor. We could all use such healing.
Although Samurai's have a place in history as brutal warriors and warlords this movie will give new meaning to their way of life. Is a true warrior someone who bombs individuals without looking his enemy in the eye or is honor to be found only through the way of the Samurai? It is an interesting concept to debate. Sometimes simplicity is the only honorable choice and quite possibly wars should only be fought by the code of these honorable men.",1087430400,9,2250,4.970822281167108
2008380,4,B0001JXOVC,"Forget LOTR. You want an epic that actually delivers, this is it. Best use of ninjas in a serious film ever. Great perfomances by both Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe. Ken was robbed at the oscars, heck this whole film was. It should have had several more nominations and taken best picture too. Don'ty miss this one.",1087430400,4,313,4.508771929824562
2008381,4,B0001JXOVC,"There's a cast of thousands and millions of dollars invested in this epic and it will probably pay off for Hollywood.  The theme is an inspiring one too.  It's set in the late 19th Century, where Tom Cruise, a veteran of the Civil War as well as some cruel Indian massacres, goes to Japan to train the Emperor's army against the Samurai so that Japan can modernize.  That's an oversimplification of this politically correct story for which I have seen no claims of being historically accurate.

Soon, Cruise is captured by the Samurai and, learns to respect them.  Ken Watanabe is the Samurai leader who believes in honor and all that other good stuff as compared to the avaricious Americans.  There's excellent cinematography of a Japan that no longer exists and well-orchestrated battle scenes that are spectacular and bloody.  And, not surprising, I felt no emotion other than to marvel at the great costuming and special effects.

This is the third film about Japan I've seen in the last few weeks.  Clearly, it is the weakest.  It's not that it's not well done.  It is.  But it's basically a genre film that cost big bucks.

It's fine escape fiction though.  The sets are great.  And you'll be entertained.  Mildly recommended.",1087344000,3,1232,4.795238095238095

2008383,5,B0001JXOVC,"The degree to which I loved this film was really surprising.  It is a film of epic proportions.  The viewer is treated to a slice of historical fiction that, thanks to the second accompanying DVD, examines the degree the filmmakers qwent to guarantee the accuracy of the time period through the actors, the scenary, the costumes and more.
  This movie is about a used up war Captain down on his luck who gets the opportunity to make a good deal of money by selling what he has left to offer - that being his lifetime of warring, of making war and of studying war.  He is perpetually haunted by the memories of his time serving under General Custer when he was ordered to murder innocent Native Americans, women and children, who he knew were innocent at the time they were slaughtered.  He became an alcoholic.  So the Captain is provided with this opportunity to go to Japan and train the newly developing Japanese army with the intention of defeating the old Samarai warriors who have been the protectors of the Japanese people for over 1000 years.  The young Emperer is being pushed into the modern times.  As a result, the Captain becomes exposed to the ways of the Samarai.  The story is absolutely captivating.
Though I usualy don't do this, I watched the accompanying DVD with the special features.  I was glad I did because throughout the film I reflected back on what I saw and heard.  During the first 15 minutes I didn't think I'd like the film and I also had a hard time dealing with Tom Cruise as the Captain, but I knew shortly thereafter that I would be purchasing the movie on DVD.  There's just so much to see in this film and from so many different aspects that I want to be able to own and watch this movie whenever I'd want as well as share and encourage my friends and family to see it as well.",1087257600,2,1815,4.430722891566265
2008384,5,B0001JXOVC,"One of history's great ironies is that the machine gun was designed with the goal of making war more humane.  This is an expression of a reality that the makers of The Last Samurai seem to be highly aware of: that ""progress"" is a relative term, and technology brings as much woe as it does improvement.
At the film's opening, ex-Civil War hero Capt. Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is a minion of the world of technology.  Specifically, he works for the Winchester gun company, halfheartedly promoting the high-tech repeater rifle.  One man in the crowd, noticing that Algren is clearly unfit to be a corporate performer, introduces him to Omura, a Japanese official visiting the United States.
In the end, he accepts a well-paying post as trainer for the Imperial Japanese army, which is engaged in keeping down a rebellion lead by Katsumoto (played with genius by Ken Watanabe), former tutor to the Emperor and leader of a small band of samurai who reject the Western improvements which the Emperor is introducing to Japan.
Unfortunately, the Imperial regiment is sent out prematurely, and the samurai have no difficulty scattering it.  Algren is captured and taken to a mountain hideout of the samurai, where he spends the winter as a prisoner.  He is cared for by the widow Taka (played by the arresting Koyuki -- why hasn't Hollywood seen more of her?) and eventually is drawn into a series of penetrating conversations with Katsumoto.  As time passes, director Zwick and his talented cast paint an absolutely enthralling picture of a society governed by discipline, tradition, and a sort of Zen stoicism that Algren begins to love.  I am no student of Japanese culture, so whether this picture is in any way accurate, I do not know.  I feel it is more important as iconography than as history, however.
Predictably, Algren throws in his hat with the samurai, learning Japanese and the expert use of the ever-important katana.  But then, to his secret dismay, he is given safe conduct back to Tokyo and prepares to return home.  But before the end he returns to the samurai village via some incredible swordplay, in time to take part in the final battle.  And by the way, the scene wherein he is armed by Taka in her deceased husband's armour, though completely chaste, is one of the most truthful and moving scenes of sensuality I have ever seen, largely due to the subtle and wordless acting of Koyuki.
Though the movie stars Cruise and, as many reviewers have pointed out, Watanabe ends up stealing the show, I think the underlying protagonist and antagonist of this film are cultures: on the one hand, the old, spiritual samurai culture --i.e. the soul of Japan -- and on the other hand, the efforts at modernization spearheaded by Omura and funded by America.  Since the sympathy is so clearly with the samurai, the film becomes a reactionary piece, perhaps even Luddite.  Clearly, samurai culture was not all about discipline, poetry, and spiritual meditation, nor was America just a merchant nation happy to sell instruments of death for profit.  But as I mentioned earlier, the iconography is much more important than the actual history; the point here is that what we see as progress can often kill the soul and mutilate the body, and the ways and wisodm of those who came before us should not be rejected in favor of technology.
This is, after all, a classic theme with plenty of resonance, so it ends up working very well and not feeling too heavy-handed.  And in the final battle, the iconography is emphasized to the point that it cannot be missed: the machine-gun comes into the forefront as the incarnation of modernity at its deadliest.  These scenes, with their slow-motion machine-gun fire and lack of sound or music, strangely reminded me of a completely displaced Road to Perdition.  Here the cinematography becomes quite stunning, and the power of the symbolism is undeniable.
In the end, this is a classic tale of tradition fighting against the overwhelming tide of modernity.  It correctly identifies the Good Life as something non-material, and then creates a drama out of men fighting and dying to preserve this life.  Since the film portrays classic themes and boasts a cast able to bring the themes to life with a considerable degree of success, The Last Samurai rates five stars.",1087257600,5,4307,4.851296043656207
2008385,4,B0001JXOVC,"I strongly urge the viewers to watch the second disc after viewing the movie itself.  The presentation of the disc is superb and for a movie enthusiast like myself, I appreciate knowing the thoughts of Director, the cast, the process, the location, the designs of costumes and the set, and so forth.  This disc collection has got them all.  It's wonderful to note that some of Japanese actors and actresses in the movie played a significant role by assisting the Director, Zwick in understanding the protocols and behaviours of the past when Samurais roamed Japan.  There's a tremendous respect between the Japanese and the production crew as they assisted one another in bridging the cultural gap & enhancing one another's performances.  I am disappointed to read about people's comparison of this movie with Dances With Wolves.  If people's tendency is to compare this movie with that and so forth, movie industry would have come to a close long time ago as why should people cough out money to watch a movie that is almost identical to the movie that they watched before?  I have enormous respect for Tom Cruise as he's a focused and dedicated actor.  Moreover, he's almost universally known as a generous actor too.  Whilst Tom was shooting in New Zealand location, he had interacted with the local community by calling a local radio station & donating resources to charity.  That's what I call star quality.  Anyhow, this movie is very well-done as the production crew took the best element from their location shots particularly in those old shrines in Himeji & Kyoto, Japan; New Zealand.  Japanese cast is superb namely Ken Watanabe who lost out on Oscar's Best Supporting Actor Award.  He definitely lifted this movie to another level by giving it a much needed weight, presence, & charisma and no wonder his samurais followed him to the shadow of death as long as honour is restored.  The documentary about samurais in the second disc is very informative.  It wanted the viewers to decide for themselves if this movie is pure Hollywood or historical fact.  At the end of the day, it's a bit of both.  The anchor said it well that in real life, the samurais would be considered the renegade, the dinasours that refused to give in to the fact that their time had passed and that they refused to move on with time.  They were supposed to be the ""baddies"" in the movie as they fought against the Government which would like to implement change for the betterment of Japanese society.  Moreover, what about the caste system that they implemented in their own village?  As I was in Japan, I always wondered if the change that the Government enforced is necessarily better for its society?  I also wondered how practical it would be should samurais are still roaming Japan and every time they step into the railway station, all people would kneel down and avoiding eye contact and they would cut the innocents if they get in their ways somehow?  In some ways, I miss Japan of the old as any industrial cities nowadays look almost similar to each other.  Still, we have to come to terms that time changes everything.  Anyhow, a very well-made and touching movie that shouldn't be missed.  Highly recommended",1087257600,4,3208,4.789090909090909
2008386,5,B0001JXOVC,"I did not hear the best reviews of The Last Samurai when it came out. Many said it was a good film, but not up to the epic status it had obviously tried to achieve. My mother is not at all a Tom Cruise fan, so I did not hear much good about him either.
  Then my grandparents glowingly recommended the movie to my whole family, and we decided to watch it with them one night when they came over. What I had seen when it ended was a moving, excellent film which, if not perhaps an epic, is certainly a wonderful tale of a culture and heritage slipping away from an ancient and lasting civiliazation.
  As I said, this movie is perhaps not an epic on the scale of-The Lord of the Rings, for example. It does not contain quite the sweep and grand scale that the latter has in buckets. It is about honor, about discipline, and about a man from a completely different country who joins forces with the samurai. So no, I would not necessarily call it an epic, although it certainly contains some of the ingredients of one. Whether the director and screenwriters intended it to be, I do not know, but that certainly does not keep it from being one of the better films I have seen.
  The hero is Captain Nathan Algren, a Civil War veteran and soldier in the 7th Cavalry who fought in the Indian wars. At the beginning of the film, however, he is not employed in warfare, but in promoting the weapons of the Winchester arms company. He does not come out to perform in time, however, and he is fired.
  Another job comes his way, however, when his commander asks him to accept the offer of a certain Mr. Omura, a man highly ranked in the Japanese government who, in accordance with his and the Japanese emperor's wishes to westernize his nation, is employing American soldiers to train the Japanese army. Algren agrees, although horrible memories of attacking innocent settlements in the Indian wars make him loathe his commander.
  Once in Japan, Algren assumes the responsibility of training the Japanese army, which consists mostly of peasants who have never even held guns.
  Then, before the army is fully trained, a samurai leader, Katsumoto, a man who thinks Japan is changing too quickly, continues the rebellion he had previously begun by attacking the railroad owned by the same Mr. Omura who hired Algren. Algren's superiors insist on attacking, despite Algren maintaining that the troops are unready for combat.
  Despite superior firepower and numbers, the Samurai win a resounding victory at the battle, and Algren is captured. But after several difficult months, he finds himself living among friends, not enemies. He is captivated by the ideals and disciplines of the samurai, and comes to fight on their side in a climactic battle whose outcome will decide Japan's future.
  The directing is certainly very good-Edward Zwick seems to be one of those talented fellows who can have two characters very obviously love each other without commiting fornication. That was one of the most amazing aspects of this movie. The sister of Katsumoto comes to love Algren during the course of his stay, and they actually remain chaste. Wow! What a concept! I am sick of having well-made movies filled with trash that renders it off-limits, and The Last Samurai was refreshingly free of sex.
  A word of warning, though-it is fairly violent, and there is some swearing, so despite it's good qualities I wouldn't recommend it for the younger children.
  The camera-work is also excellent, giving us some views of the wonderful countryside of...New Zealand. I find it a little strange that this movie was not actually filmed in Japan, but the country is so beautiful I can overlook it, and it looked to me like a place that could easily be found in Japan. But I have never been there, so don't take my word for it.
  The acting is good, and having no previous exposure to Tom Cruise I was able to be satisfied with his performance and not have any unpleasant memories from his past films. Ken Watanabe is very good as Katsumoto, and Hiroyuki Koyuki is wonderful as Katsumoto's sister.
  But perhaps the best of all are the values in Last Samurai. Honor, devotion to duty, discipline, and courage to do what you believe is right in the face of danger are all lauded here. I don't think Western culture is being universally blasted here, but I do think the film makers are trying to say that technology is not all that matters; but that values and morals should be honored and practiced. Hollywood does not recognize that Jesus Christ is the only answer to life's questions and that He is the reason that all these morals are held in such high esteem, but they are at least doing something better than their ordinary fare.

The sword fights are wonderful, especially one where Tom's character is set upon by four samurai.  Usually, a Hollywood film showing the hero fighting against multiple attackers looks extremely corny: with each one waiting his turn to charge.  This one looked quite a bit more compelling.

And The Last Samurai, albeit with some reservation, does manage to stand on its own against the likes of Dances With Wolves and Glory.
The Story:
  The Last Samurai is about the cultural and industrial revolution Japan goes through in the late 19th century, forcing some of its most ancient institutions to crumble under the onslaught of western modernization. Meiji (Schichinosuke Nakamura), the young but rather hasty Emperor of Japan is determined to see his country stand against other industrialized nations and believes this can only happen by forgoeing the traditions that Japan held dear for nearly 2000 yrs.
  The first to be sidelined is the very force that was created by erstwhile Emperors and clan chiefs to protect them and Japan. The warrior swordsmen called Samurai. The Samurai (or 'to serve') is in itself a community that adheres to certain strict moral standards of living which it neither changes nor bends. The Samurai are known for their extraordinary loyalty , honour and fighting skill and there traditional sword, the 'Katana', is considered to be the finest sword in the world.
 The sudden change in Japan appalls the Samurai, and it is provocation enough to make them turn against there own master. Their leader Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) believes this resistance to be in the service of the Emperor himself; to make him understand how much the Samurai sacrificed for him and his like and for what values it stands for. However the Emperor, influenced by his coterie of corrupt officials, is unrelenting. He needs a credible force to defeat the Samurai once and for all.
In comes the American connection...
 To support and aid the modernization of the Japanese Army, Captain Nathan Algren(Tom Cruise), a guilt-ridden, alcoholic Civil War veteran is recruited by his
his cold, ruthless and remorseless superior Colonel Bagley (Tony Goldwyn). Landing in Japan only to find himself leading an untrained battalion of 'conscript' farmers with guns, the first battle with the enigmatic Samurai ends in total disaster, with Algren being the only man left behind. Injured and semi-conscious, Algren is held captive by the Samurai until he is fully healed. It is during this period that Algren slowly comes to respect his enemy and learns their way of life. And the community in return learns to admire his transformation.
Slowly but surely, Algren understands the plight of the Samurai and joins their cause, culminating in an epic battle between modernity and honour. Swordsman vs Rifleman. The Archer vs Howitzers.
The movie:
There is no doubt the real strength of the movie lies in lack of any flashy effects. Zwick does well to cover even the final battle in the classic war mold without relying too much on the numbers as against realism. The settings are lavish and completely authentic. The costume design is flawless. Though the movie's story does not do justice to the factual events of Japan's history, it is nonetheless interesting. The cinematography is beautiful and the music by Hans Zimmer is exemplary, wonderfully theme oriented. The overall production value will no doubt, keep this movie in the limelight for quite a few years to come.
The cast:
This movie was supposed to showcase Cruise's acting talent,but it ended up being a Japanese delight. Ken Watanabe should have won the Supporting Actor Award (I'm not taking anything away from Tim Robbins though). He was really compelling, dignified and totally original. Shin Koyamada (Nobutada), Sosuke Ikematsu (Higen) as his sons are superb. However the real star of the movie is the newcomer Koyuki(Taka) as the sister of Katsumoto. She brings a rare and beautiful screen presence to the movie, not to mention her silent but wonderfully conveyed feelings towards Algren. And she is downright beautiful. The rest of the cast including Timothy Spall(Simon Graham), Tony Goldwyn(Col. Bagley), Emperor(Nakamura)and Masato Harado(Omura) does its job commendably.
The downside:
If ever there was any reason for this movie to be a disappointment (which it commercially was, as far as epics go), it would have to be the main protagonist himself. Though Tom Cruise is a great actor, here he is steriotypical and unconvincing. Totally predictable. Part,if not most of this fault lies with director Edward Zwick too. Zwick never really showed how Algren changes when held captive by the Samurai, the most important period of the movie. Not only that, the ending was totally cliched as Algren is left the last man standing (and always an American at that!). Hence the title of the movie becomes even more ambiguous. And this only stifles Cruise's performance and lowers his character from being a champion to a 'has been'. I personally feel Zwick should have invested some more time on Cruise's period of transformation.
And oh before I forget,if you have watched Dances with Wolves, you will say that The Last Samurai is a product of pure plaigiarism. And it's true. You just cannot watch this movie without recalling the Dances With Wolves' theme with almost exacting detail. Just the setting is different. On a face-to-face basis, TLS will not beat the true originality of DwW. That is for sure. Unfortuantely the Producer and the Director themselves were resposible for this movie to reach the level of 'a good..'instead of 'a masterpiece...'.
Conclusion:
Luckily the movie does stand on its own. This has to do with the individual themes in the movie than as a whole. See it for the Samurai. Their way of life and honour is extremely interesting and educative. You would wonder how such a thriving culture was virtually wiped out in less than 10 yrs. The cinematography and music are the movie's other assets. The main battle scene is utterly realistic and in the end, poignant. At over 21/2 hrs, the movie has a laid back feel to it that will ultimately give you your money's worth. Definitely go watch it.",1086912000,3,6162,5.0126953125
2008413,4,B0001JXOVC,"My wife and I originally saw this in its theatrical release back in December.  I'm a sucker for historical epics, especially war epics.  This film's two biggest faults are (1) it is not an entirely accurate depiction of the events of that period of Japanese history and (2) its worldview is more pagan than Christian (and can also be construed as anti-American).  However, I still found it to be an extremely powerful film when dealing with issues such as the brotherhood of men in combat, the virtue of self-sacrifice and the need for personal redemption.  Like ""Gladiator"" (one of my all-time favorite films), it addresses the Christian themes of atonement, the human desire for heaven, and the value of the traditional family, albeit in a pagan context.  There is also a wonderful scene similar to one in ""Gladiator"" that has a main character seeing the beauty of the next world as he dies on the battlefield.",1086825600,5,912,4.82051282051282

2008415,4,B0001JXOVC,"""The Last Samurai"" is a beautifully shot film that everyone seems to have thrown themselves into with gusto, but the movie somehow lacks the ""oomph"" that would have propelled it into the cinematic stratosphere.  The result -- a darn good movie that, with two exceptional aspects, will not be considered a classic (and it could have been!).
Directed by Edward Zwick (of the magnificent ""Glory""), ""Samurai"" tells the story of Civil War hero Capt. Nathan Algren (Cruise, in an earnest performance).  The story's parallels to Kevin Costner's ""Dances With Wolves"" are well-documented, but overstated -- Americans have forever been encountering ""new"" cultures (that have been around for centuries), and it's reasonable to deduce that many Americans (even given our stereotypical egotism, boorishness and hypocrisy that Hollywood loves to play up) would become enamored of these different cultures.
It's 1876.  Algren, a self-hating drunk, blows his last chance as spokesman for the Winchester rifle company, but is offered the job of going to the Orient to ""kill Jappos.""  The first Japanese who speaks is a despicable character, fat and bewhiskered, who has obviously sold out to Western ideals.  He stands in stark contrast to the first Japanese we see, Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe, who steals the movie), the Samurai lord -- we see him in his tranquil village having a vision of a tiger in a scene of stark, lethal beauty.
Katsumoto, an honored advisor to the Emperor, is holding out against the Westernization of Japan.  The Fat Japanese Man, also an imperial advisor, has isolated Katsumoto and has apparently steamrolled the Emperor, a young man clearly not up to his imperial obligations, to open Japan to the West.  The goal is obviously to line the pockets of the Fat Japanese Man, and America is eager to get involved in the Westernization of Japan in order to exploit lucrative weapons contracts.  Can you see where this is going?
""Samurai"" has a very predictable plot, but that should not have prevented it from making a powerful emotional statement.  After all, we know how Hamlet is going to wind up, and it's still an emotional roller-coaster.  ""Samurai"" certainly gets a lot of the visual elements correct -- the early battle scene involving the cavalry charge of the samurai through the mists, as if emerging from their own mythology, is a triumph.  But overall the film lacks an emotional core that is necessary.
Part of this responsibility must lie at Cruise's feet.  It's not for a lack of effort -- Cruise obviously threw himself into this movie with everything he has.  He is just a poor choice for narrator of this particular story.  For one, Cruise does not abandon his anguish at any point in the story.  (In this sense, he's similar to the casting of Leo as the lead in ""Gangs of New York"" -- too surly to be of much interest.)  Contrast Cruise's performance with Costner's in ""Wolves"" -- Costner achieves a stronger emotional connection with the audience than Cruise does (and that's surprising, 'cause I generally consider Cruise to be a superior actor).
The other problem with the movie is that it just moves too darn fast through some important aspects of the story.  For one, the complex problems with the Westernization of Japan should have been given greater depth, as should have the role of the samurai in Japanese society.  We do spend a lot of time with in the samurai village, and we see how important it is to train with weapons.  But we needed to see more about how the imperial advisors favoring Westernization have ""sold out"" their culture.  By making Katsumoto the only hold-out without much further explanation, it's harder to see Hatsumoto has the honorable preserver of traditions and easier to see him as the last desperate man, too eager to hold onto traditions.
Other details seem to have been missed.  At one point, we see the horrible shame for a samurai who has his cherished top-knot hairdo cut off.  But why is it never explained why Katsumoto has a shaved head?  We presume that Katsumoto has the shaved head only because it looks good to the eyes of the Western audience, which is probably not going to find the traditional samurai hairstyle very attractive.  (To be fair, in many other ways the movie gets the look and feel of the period very well.)
Ken Watanabe's portrayal of Katsumoto is the movie's high point.  A complex man, capable of great emotion within his samurai stoicism, Katsumoto is intrigued by Algren and learns much from him.  Eventually becoming brothers in arms, Katsumoto and Algren strive to save the samurai and bushido, the samurai code.  Overcoming diplomatic pressure, official ostracism, and a lethal ninja attack, Katsumoto fights a noble battle to its unfortunate and inevitable end.
The climactic scene, the last battle of the Katsumoto's samurai against the Western-armed and trained imperial army, is awesome.  Set beautifully against a backdrop of falling cherry blossoms, the samurai evoke their own ""charge of the light brigade,"" and their sacrifice and refusal to submit is truly ennobling.
It's sad that the rest of the film doesn't quite live up to its incredible potential.  This movie dared to tackle a huge, powerful story, and in many ways it works.  It just doesn't quite measure up to what it could have been.
The DVD extras are OK -- many interviews and promos, with some interesting details about the art design, but there's nothing to ""ooh and ahh"" over.  A decent DVD for a very good, but not great, movie.",1086566400,3,5501,4.914594594594595

2008447,4,B0001JXOVC,"For a generic-seeming Hollywood blockbuster, The Last Samurai was remarkably true to its subject matter. My main concern walking into it was that the director would confuse the code of the samurai with western ideas about courage and honor, disregarding the more morbid side of the tradition to present some sentimental parable about discovering yourself or being good. In fact, though, the samurai ethos is treated with enough depth, the acting and pacing is excellent, and while there is some sentimental nonsense, it restrains itself more than most films do these days. The final battle is especially impressive - the choreography, the way that deaths of important characters are treated, and some of the images which arouse real pathos.
It's still nothing spectacular, though - it never really risks saying anything that hasn't been said before, or presenting some image which hasn't been seen before - but it's probably as good a movie as we could expect to be produced for a mass audience.",1086307200,2,995,5.073170731707317

But this movie is, in my opinion, good for the whole family, if you don't mind, bloody action sequences. The fighting choreography was brilliant. All the actors play their parts really well, and after each fight, you are left hanging for more. One part I didn't like, is when they are breaking Katsumoto out of jail, and soldiers are shooting the guns, at Cruise and other Samurais, the soldiers hit one person, while the samurai's arrows hit their mark every time. This kind of takes the essence away from stronger weapons. Other than that this movie was spectacular, story wise and action wise.",1086220800,3,716,4.736
2008449,4,B0001JXOVC,"They're Eastern costumes, mostly, but still costume drama. The situation, the final wresting of power from the last of the feudal lords, is historically true. The movie's story, however, involving the American gone native, is synthetic.
It's a good movie. It addresses the Japanese culture with knowledge and respect. It brings to life one of the defining moments of Japanese history, possibly the one moment that marks the start of modern era. The costuming and architecture are beautiful. It presents the bushido, the samurai ethic, as an all-consuming force in the lives of the samurai themselves but also in their families.
Still, I have reservations about semi-historical movies. Takamori's final battle is an historical event, and this presentation of it is fiction. Lord knows that Americans need more exposure to world history and that this flick is an enticing way to present it. Still, the movie blurs the line between fact and fiction, between entertainment and events as documented. As much as I like the movie, I don't think that it serves history very well.",1086220800,,1071,5.1257142857142854

2008451,4,B0001JXOVC,"This is the story of Lt. Algren (Tom Cruise), scarred emotionally by his Civil War experiences, who is coerced into training the Japanese emperor's army in Western fighting techniques as they prepare to fight Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), a traditional samurai who is against the emperor's adoption of non-traditional ways.  In a skirmish, our hero is wounded and rescued by the samurai, who cares for him through the winter.  When it comes time to return to his post, Algren is not sure where his loyalties lie.
My husband and I watched this film, and while I liked it better than he did, I agreed with his criticism that the script was poor -- overly cliched and unimaginative.  The acting was excellent all around, though I had trouble believing Cruise as a Civil War veteran; he is so much a modern man that hearing him utter formal language is a bit jarring.  Watanabe did a terrific job, for which he received multiple nominations as Supporting Actor, and everyone else was great, as was the direction (Edward Zwick) and cinematography.  The script was sometimes painfully bad, however, which detracted from this otherwise enjoyable film.
There are many dvd extras, including a director's commentary and various featurettes about the making of the film.  The film can be heard in English or French, and subtitled in English, French or Spanish.

I was pleasantly surprised.
I thought it was an intesting twist how it took a ""outsider"" to convince the young emperor to make the stand he made at the end. Even Katsumoto wasn't able to do that. I think the emperor was reminded of the Samurai Spirit, ironically by a Westerner.
The scene near the end, with the new machine guns from America, depicts with new beginning of modern Japan. It was sad to see how easily the Samurai was defeated. 1 by 1 like bowling pins, these greate warriors went down. It's as though they saved the ""best"" for last. So to me, those machine guns symbolized the modernization.
I thought Katsumoto's character was great but thought Cruise's character was needed to complete the story.
The ""Seppuku"", or suicide, is not an act of cowardice. It is an act of honor. It was considered the honorable way to die. It depicts the deepest dedication of the Samurai. You see this in the modern world today. Maybe not to this type of extreme. Sacrifice oneself for the love of country isn't so far fetched an idea.

2008454,3,B0001JXOVC,"The Last Samauri is a good movie, beautifully filmed and well acted, yet it really does nothing to make it stand apart.
Tom Cruise is a captain in the US army haunted by his own actions in the wars against the US. native Americans.  He sells his services to Japan to train Japanese soldiers to battle the savage samurais.
Cruise is captured after one battle and his life is spared after Ken Watanabe's character sees Cruise fight bravely and kill his brother-in-law.  The best part of the film is the hour or so that Cruise spends living with the Samurais.  He lives with the family of the man he killed and the kids grow to like him and the beautiful wife learns to accept him.  The Samurais learn from Cruise and Cruise begins to train with the samurais and becomes friends with Watanabe.
Cruise is released and the end of the movie results in Cruise fighting with Watanabe against the Japanese army.
The Last Samurai seems like a Japanese version of Braveheart, with epic battles and valiant characters.  This movie did show a lot about the Japanese culture, including the practice of killing yourself if you are shamed (Which is incredibly stupid thing to do in my opinion).

2008455,4,B0001JXOVC,"Forget the oversimplifications in some negative reviews about ""the Evil West"" and the ""white man playing this part), for many reviewers are so caught up in looking at Hollywood's left or enthocentrism leanings, they are missing the more beautiful aspects of the film. This movie focuses on the positive aspects of traditional views and living pitted against unchecked modernism/materialism. And except for a couple of silly, overly sentimental scenes, the director Edward Zwick, largely delivers in telling the tale of redemption.
Tom Cruise as Capt Nathan Algren brings in his usual performance.  He is neither outstanding or poor, but he is effective and unlike other movies where he has overacted (Born on the Fourth of July), he here is stable and is enjoyable to watch (however, his best performances in my opinion is Minority Report).  Ken Watanabe is simply outstanding!  He provides a strong anchor to carry this movie along.
The fight/battle scenes are exceptional and fall a little short in epic style to Gibson's Brave Hart.  If one can concentrate on the redemption of Cruise's character and the changing of people's attitudes towards each other, then one will come away from this movie with a great experience; however, if one is only their for the action, or to criticize the so-called left leaning message or to use this movie as a propaganda against the West, then they will also miss the most important part of this film:  Capt Algren's redemption.
The film score works very well.  The film does fail in articulating the Bushido code fully, because it relies to heavy on a visual style and the characters should have dialoged about this way of life further.  The ending is, however, sappy.  All in all, this is a good movie with a lot of energy and beauty.",1085961600,,1773,4.926174496644295

The idea is nice, but overly simplifies feudal Japan, which wasn't exactly a peaceful and idyllic place all of the time.
The acting is good, the story is OK, but the ending is downright silly and unnecessary.  I won't spoil it for those that haven't yet seen the movie, but let's just say that the ""true"" ending would've involved Tom Cruise meeting a noble death on the battlefield.

2008469,5,B0001JXOVC,"This movie being categorized as action, pretty much misrepresents what it's about.  Yes, it has action in it (amazing battle scenes), however it's central theme has to deal with honor, the loss of it, and the loss of a way of life in exchange for a more modern society.  On the one hand you have the Japanese civilization in the middle of adopting a more Western style of living, and on the other you have the Samurai, more than willing to die fighting to keep Japanese tradition alive.

  Now, some people say the title of this movie refers to Tom Cruise's character, others (including me) say it refers to Watanabe's character, Katsumoto, who loosely represents the real life Saigo Takamori, the real life samurai who was considered the actual ""last samurai"".  Some reviewers also describe Tom's character, Algren, as the white man who swoops in to save the day.  I say he was simply a bystander caught up in the events of history.  It's not impossible to believe that a white man can get involve with the samurai, since this idea is borrowed from actual history of a westerner who adopts the samurai way of life during the rise of the Shogunate.

  No matter who's name is credited first though, it wouldn't be much of a movie without the cast.  With that said, Ken Watanabe, Hiro Sanada, and Koyuki make this movie.  No offense to Tom Cruise since he was impressive in doing all of his own sword work.

How disappointing that ""The Last Samurai"" becomes dreadful in its last half, because the first half is quite engaging. This movie is what results when a director with left-leaning sensibilities tries to make a liberal-minded ""message"" movie without the courage of his own convictions. So the movie is not content to merely show us the crisis facing the Samurai in the face of westernization and letting our sympathies lie with them....Oh no, fearful that an American audience would not take to a film centered around Japanese characters, we have to have a white, hot-shot Hollywood actor to root for, who sweeps in to be our hero. We get a token Japanese hero to root for as well, but guess who remains living at the end of the film?
Didn't Kevin Costner already make this movie?  Tom Cruise's heart is obviously in the right place. He gives an incredibly earnest performance...and that's part of the problem. He's SO earnest that I never forgot for a second that I was watching Tom Cruise, Mr. Hollywood A-List, feeling self-important for attaching himself to such an important film.  Ken Watanabe received heaps of praise for his performance, but I fail to see what the hype is about. And the obligatory love story is just silly---obviously, the movie makers thought so too, because they make only a half-hearted attempt to develop it in the first place.
I loved the message in ""The Last Samurai,"" but I hated the approach taken to the material.  It's yet one more movie in which the creators give the audience not one single amount of credit for having a brain; emotions are force-fed to us through superficial means like slow-motion and thundering music.  Not comfortable with any amount of ambiguity, all of the Americans except for Tom Cruise have to be evil, and all of the Samurai have to be entirely noble. The film inadvertently makes the point that killing someone with a sword or a bow and arrow makes you a better person than killing someone with a gun, conveniently sidestepping the fact that killing is killing, regardless of how it's done.
My summary: a pretty film with not a brain in its head.

Let's just look at the movie for its own sake and forget the nonsense about comparisons to other flicks, especially DANCES WITH WOLVES.
THE LAST SAMURAI is simply a beautiful story about a man who is able to see the best in his ""enemies.""  Taken prisoner, he is forced to study a culture that is based on honor and simplicity and determines to defend ""what he has come to love."" The movie goes a long way in portraying the end of feudal Japan and accurately depicts a culture bound by spiritual beliefs that permeated everything from the way tea was served to how a warrior honorably ended his own life.  And all without the ridiculous and unnecessary political correctness that saturated DANCES WITH WOLVES! If you watch and enjoy this movie for nothing more than the beauty of Japan and the wonderful way that the makers of this movie put it on the screen you will be richly rewarded.

The director of this movie is best known for directing the classic Civil War epic Glory.  This movie shows a lot of similar aspects of Glory.

Tom Cruise who is a former hero from the Civil War is now broken and destitute.  His past haunts him and he can't seem to find any sort of life outside the millitary.  His character was involved in forcing Native Americans out of lands desired by the American government.  In other words killing any that didn't leave voluntarily.  So he has nightmares of being ordered to kill women and children.  Winchester pays him to do performances telling the values of their rifles, but even they are losing patience with him.  His alcoholism and depression have made him next to impossible to work with.

He is then looked up by a man he used to serve with who has a business proposition.  Japan has decided to modernize their society to keep pace with the times.  So they are hiring people from all over the world to help them out.  Most notably ""warriors"" from the United States.

He is sent to Japan and starts to teach their ""soldiers"", which are conscripts, main farmers who'd never fired a rifle in their lives.  When their leaders inform him of an opponent the the modernization, a samurai that opposes the new ways.  He is told he needs to take his army into battle, their superior weapons will help ensure victory.  He warns them that it is a bad idea to take green soliders into a battle with combat veterans this early despite their superior weapons.

His fears prove justified, the soliders are too frightened to follow orders or even keep rank.  The Samurai rush in and quickly defeat his forces.  He is kept alive because the samurai leader, Katsumoto, is interested in this fierce fighter, and wants to learn of his enemy.  So the Samurai reluctantly let him live and take him into the mountains where he is trapped there by the winter.

This was a well acted, well shot, and engaging.  Some people complain that the plot has been done before, but what plots haven't?  The Lion King followed the story of Hamlet, Resevoir Dogs was about 60% of a hong kong movie ""city on fire"", and Kill Bill is a mix of every major hong kong and japanese action cinema in existence.  The important part is how it is carried out.

This movie has well choreographed action sequences.  Though they were a little inaccurate towards the end on what was known and what they did, it was a minor detail.

The main characters weren't the heroes you would expect them to be.  They humanized so that you relate with them, but are still their own people.  There is a discussion where they talk of Custer's last stand, one that we look at with embarassment.  Katsumoto on the other hand is impressed with their bravery and thinks they died a good death.  Dying in combat against incredible odds was not only brave to him, but honorable.  Didn't matter the reasons, Samurai didn't believe in right or wrong, only duty.

Tom Cruise wasn't that bad, he has matured since Risky Business.  He isn't at the level of Sean Connery or George Clooney, but he is competent and believable in this role.  Which interestingly enough is very close to the Union general Grant, an alcoholic that seemed to be only fit for war.  Only Cruise's character was only a low level officer, not a general.

All in all this is a well made and entertaining film.  There should be elements for all types, so it would be a good date movie.  Action to keep guys interested, and complicated romantic elements that will entertain the women.  It doesn't reach the same levels as Gladiator or Braveheart, but it is worth the price of admission.  As well as being a treat for those who love asian culture.",1085616000,,3932,4.57819225251076

And I love Hollywood because mostly it's all entertaining.  The Last Samurai is entertaining and somewhat historically accurate, but the best thing about this movie to me is the underlying message.  The one about Honor.  Duty.  Bushido and the Samurai way.  If you've ever wondered about the Samurai or heard about them but didn't quite ""get it"", watch this movie.  Then you will ""get it"".  The mind, the culture, the beauty of the Japanese(Samurai) mind.

2008496,4,B0001JXOVC,"MOVIE: This film was one of the surprises for me of 2003. I saw Tom Cruise playing in this Samurai genre film that looked very bad. I was the victim of bad marketing. The trailer does not show what the movie is truly about. This film is a wonderful exploration of interaction among societies and how the world as a diverse planet can learn from one another. The film was excellent because it really showed the audience about Samurai life and built on the characters and their ideologies. We learn through watching how a Samurai grows up trained to obey the emperor and lives by honor. Through the intense character development comes the importance of the ending. Cruise also gave a good performance but as you've all heard, Ken Watanabe steals the show. Hans Zimmer's score also brought the movie to life as does all of his incredible scores for their movies. The Last Samurai does however becomes the victim of Hollywood cinema. The film is not all historically accurate, but then again the purpose of the film isn't really to be a documentary, but more of a character exploration. This is a movie that is a little gem, not a masterpiece, but not something you want to throw away.
VIDEO: The only problem with this transfer is a little grain here and there, but overall a nice effort by Warner. There is also the flaw of some blurring during fast paced scenes.
AUDIO: The disc has a Dolby 5.1 track and is pretty clean but not as good as it should be.
PACKAGING / EXTRAS: The disc comes in a standard two disc Amaray case (I love two disc sets from warner cause they can't put them in snapper cases). The extras include a 13 minute featurette about Tom Cruise and his experience making the film, Edward Zwick's directors journal a 26 minute featurette, a conversation with Zwick and Cruise, History vs. Hollywood a 22 minute special from the history channel, a production design featurette, a costume featurette, two deleted scenes, and footage from the premieres in Japan, and trailers for the film. Overall a nice heft sack of goodies but I wish they had a featurette dedicated to Hans Zimmer's score since it was very well done.

2008497,4,B0001JXOVC,"Braveheart in Japan?
A lot of people have called this movie ""Braveheart"" in Japan, however I don't think there is too much wrong with that, after all I loved Braveheart ;) Yes so the movie does seem to borow a bit from Braveheart, but that doesn't mean it should be overlooked and I believe Tom Cruise was rightfully nominated for an Oscar for his part in this movie.
First of all the character that Tom Cruise portays, as much as he behaves like a complete a-hole, you start to like him after a while, he's a drunk, foul-mouth disobying little rat but still there is something about him that makes you like him, maybe it's the fact that he uses quite a bit of humor in interacting with the local people he eventually ends up staying with.
Even though Cruise is good I believe the show-stealer in this movie is Ken Watanabe, he delivers an amazing performance that will have you cheering for him at the end of the movie and also will make you want to go check him out in other movies, I know one of the first things I did after watching the movie was to find out what other movies he had been in.
Even though the plot of the movie is pretty predictable the way the movie has been shot and the exterior shots are so beautiful that you just keep on watching, for some reason the movie doesn't seem as long when you are watching it for the first time, I believe that to be a sign of a great movie, one that keeps you entertained for hours without it seeming like its taking hours.
Be weary though, the movie does get pretty violent at times, but I believe that if you can sit through the battle-scenes you are going to be treated to one of the better movies of 2003, highly recommended epic movie",1085529600,4,1693,4.277258566978193
2008498,5,B0001JXOVC,"The Last Samurai focuses on the dying days of the samurai.  Tom Cruise plays a disillusioned American army officer who is hired to train the newly established Imperial Army in Japan.  While training this ragtag army, he is ordered to put down a samurai rebellion.  However, his fresh troops haven't completed their training and they are quickly defeated by the samurai, and he is captured.  The leader of the samurai keep him alive so that he can learn about the ways of his American enemies.  Slowly, the army officer becomes acustomed to and accepted into samurai life.
Taken as entertainment, this is an excellent movie.  However, there are lots of inaccuracies in this movie.  Also, the idea that an American army officer would be accepted into the traditional society of the samurai is ridiculous when you consider that it would be impossible even for most Japanese.  In the feudal system of the samurai, there was no social mobility and there were no chances for outsiders to enter the system which is one of the main reasons that samurai society had to be destroyed.  It was incompatible with modernism.  Despite this, if you realize that this movie is just historical fantasy and enjoy it as such, then it's a great piece of entertainment.",1085443200,10,1247,4.839622641509434

The story line is very much like ""Dances With Wolves"" in the way that Tom Cruise makes a transformation from a ""Bad Guy"" in the beginning and becomes a ""Good Guy"" later on in the film as he joins up with the loyal Japanese samurai soldiers.

The direction is poetic and confident.  Cruise is serviceable, but not memorable.  The real steal in the film is the acting by Ken Watanabe.  His character really moves and enlightens you.  There's an effortless grace that he posesses.

2008502,5,B0001JXOVC,"As epic movies go, ""The Last Samurai"" is a superb one despite any historical inaccuracies which is what the History Channel is for.  All of the big named male actors such as Mel Gibson and Russell Crowe had their epic war movies and Tom Cruise was sorely due for one and in this movie he chose very well.  Over the years, like many super stars, Tom Cruise has chosen some extremely good roles and at the other end of the spectrum he's done some very poor movies but with ""The Last Samurai,"" the part couldn't have been better for him as it was supremely suited to his talents.
Along with the superior performance given by Tom Cruise, his co-actors in Timothy Spall, Ken Watanabe, Billy Connolly, Tony Goldwyn, Hiroyuki Sanada and Koyuki and so many others added greatly to the overall feel of the movie through their performances which were all of great depth and feeling.
Over the years, Edward Zwick has directed some of the finest movies to ever grace the silver screen such as ""Glory"" and ""Legends of the Fall"" and ""The Last Samurai"" serves well to his legacy by being added to his library of exceptional films.  Additional credit goes to Hans Zimmer for the score for this outstanding film.
The Premise:
Civil War hero Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) has seen all too well the horrors of war and the policies of the American government in both dealing with soldiers of the south and especially Native Americans.  He is essentially forced into going to Japan to fight for the government against the Samurai that have for so long defended Japan but are now anachronistic in their eyes.  In a twist of fate, he is forced to lead his forces against the Samurai before they are ready and his forces are easily routed and he is captured.
Feeling merciful and wanting to learn more about his new enemy, Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) spares his life and takes him to his village for the winter.  Captain Algren spends that time there and suddenly finds a rebirth...
What follows from there is an exceptional film both in its touching and intriguing story and the extraordinary battle scenes.  I highly recommend this film to any and all fans of films in this genre as they will be highly satisfied with it.  {ssintrepid}

2008503,4,B0001JXOVC,"Despite the gross inaccuracies concering the depiction of the Satsuma rebellion, I very much enjoyed this movie for its likable characters, honest portrayal of human relationships, and laudable themes.  Tom Cruise (whose work I do not enjoy as a rule) appeared to be quite comfortable in his role.  The real star of the file was Ken Watanabe, who walked the fine line between warrior and philosopher.  My only other complaint with the film was that we never really established who the title character, the last samurai, was; perhaps this would've given this film that last vital shove into greatness.
Better luck next time.

2008504,5,B0001JXOVC,"This movie is about the honor of a disappearing culture falling to the ever enchroaching imperial world in both 19th Century America and Europe.  It is about the Samurai who are no longer needed in a Westernized Japan and symbolizes the culture of Japan as it is swallowed up by Western Imperialism in the 19th Century.
The movie centers around Captain Algren (Tom Cruise), an ex-American Civil War soldier and Indian fighter who has lost his honor and is disillusioned about the world he lives in.  Tom Cruise is great in this role and is quite possibily his best role yet.  Algren is sent to Japan by America to train the Imperial Japanese army in the way of Western warfare and weaponry.  This sets up the confrontation between the Samurai, who are defending their dying culture, and Algren, who is trying to destroy that culture.  Algren is captured by Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), the Samurai leader, in the battle.  While in capitivity, Algren learns the way of the Samurai and comes to respect the dying culture.
Many people say this is just a rip off of Kevin Costner's Dances With Wolves.  It isn't.  This is a vastly different storyline with a similiar idea that can be seen in Dances With Wolves.  The two are different stories.
The production values of this movie are great and well directed by Edward Zwick (Glory).  Definitely the a great directed movie.  My hat is off to the crew that made this happen.
Yes, there are historical accuracies in the film, but besides Gods and Generals and Gettysburg, how many films are historical accurate?  Not many and if they were they would probably be rather boring to many.  On this DVD is a documentary about the true story of the Last Samurai by the History Channel.  So if you are worried about historical inaccuracies then you can get the real tale in the documentary on the special features disc.
All in all a great movie about a dying culture and how some people won't simple [surrender] themself to save their life and lose their culture.",1085184000,2,1996,4.681948424068768

How does a non-samurai learn to be such a great swordsman in only a few short months when others spend the lives dedicated to this art and cannot even match his prowess?  Why is Cruise's character spared at the end?  If he has become a samurai, he would have been killed.  He is also a Gaijin, a foreign barbarian, and should be killed for this.

2008526,3,B0001JXOVC,"The Last Samurai is a movie of great action that ends in sadness.  Almost everyone you care about gets killed.
Samurai were feudal lords who occasionally battled the Emperors and those that controlled the emperor.  The fight scenes and the cinematography are at times awesome.  Cruise is very creditable in his role as a disillusioned X-army Captain who had been with the seventh cavalry, presumably with Reno's force after Custer divided his force into three groups, hence he survived.  Cruise goes to Japan to teach the Emperors army how to use modern western weapons, gets captured and ends up sympathetic to his captures cause.  Patty Hurst Syndrome?
It is a little bit like the Last of the Mohicans or the Thirteenth Warrior.  The viewer is left with a an empty feeling and of course the bad guys are the Americans.
Once one gets past the politics of the makers of the movie and the inaccurate historical presentation it's a pretty good movie for those old enough for an R rating.  This is not a sword fight movie to watch with ones 10 year old.  Heads fly, blood spurts and at times the story bogs down into the maudlin and smarmy.
There is probably a 5 star movie inside this otherwise 3 star movie, if they'd let me edit it down to 90 or 100 minutes, removing the moderate use of cursing, the really boring moments that contribute little to the story line, blood spurting and the beheadings.  For a better sword action movie with sharp editing and a great screen play, check out Antonio Banderas in the Thirteenth Warrior.  13th is still not a movie for your 10 year old, but that is more because it creates a scariness and feeling of dread about what the Warriors are up against.",1085097600,,1688,4.596666666666667

Cast:  Tom Cruise, Ken Watanabe, William Atherton, Chad Lindberg, Tony Goldwyn.
Running Time: 154 minutes
Rated R for graphic violence, battle scenes, and mild language.
 Tom Cruise plays the war hero Nathan Algren, who with the support of his commanding officers, is sent to Japan to train the troops of an inexperienced infantry in order to wage a battle against the mighty Samurai Katsumoto.  While in the midst of battle against Katsumoto, Algren is held captive and taken back to the enemy's village.  While recovering from the war and learning the customs of those inhabiting the village, the war hero becomes engrossed with the culture and the intellectual Katsumoto.  Eventually, the two unite to form a bond, striving to fight for the right reasons and uphold the Japanese traditions that the United States are threatening to destroy and reform.
 ""The Last Samurai"" is equivalent to the beauty and eloquence of director Zwick's previous masterpiece ""Glory"".  The film is exceptionally portrayed by not only Cruise, but especially Watanabe as the heroic Japanese fighter that leads his village against the mighty American-influenced infantry.  The battle scenes are gruesome and mind-captivating, with many slow-motion cuts and fast-paced war sequences alike.  Although not a typical Cruise role, certainly one of the better films of 2003 and one that should inspire viewers and congratulate all those who have fought for something they believed in.",1085097600,,1480,5.344827586206897

2008530,5,B0001JXOVC,"I have never been a fan of Tom Cruise, but after watching this movie my opinion of him has slowly begin to change.  Granted, Cruise is a good actor, but there are several others I would place ahead of him in terms of acting ability and on camera congeniality.  Nevertheless, I believe The Last Samurai is one of Tom Cruise's best films, if not his best film ever, because he does an outstanding job of portraying the role of Capt. Nathan Algren;  Algren is a Civil War and Indian War veteran who is tortured over the atrocities he has viewed and committed on the front lines.  These experiences have transformed Algren into a man filled with bitterness and cynicism and driven him to embrace alcohol as his escape mechanism from reality.
Cruise does an excellent job of capturing this particular spirit in the film.  Even though Cruise's performance is excellent, the film is only bolstered by the performances by the performances of Watanabe and the rest of the cast.  Watanabe was simply terrific as the Samurai warlord, Katsumoto.  On screen he exuded a kind of gentle but stern warrior aura, and showed he was a man of astute intellectual abilities.  In his performace Watanabe displayed all the qualities and characteristics that were essential to the Samurai.  Besides the performances the battle sequences and costumes were spectacular.  In addition, the scenery and setting were also very good and captured the atmosphere of a 19th century Japan that was experiencing rapid Westernization.  At several instances in the film it is easy to see vestiges of traditional Eastern Japansese culture stand side by side with modern Western culture.  Last but not least, the musical score by Hans Zimmer is phenomenal. As always, Zimmer delivers a rousing an emotional score that complements the film and actually heightens the sensitivity at certain crucial moments of the film.
My only criticism of this movie is that Tom Cruise was focued upon too much.  It would have been nice if the other characters, Ujio, Taka, and Katsumoto, received more screen time since they were all so likeable and each delivers a great performance.  Slight criticism aside, this is one of my favorite movies of all time and one I would recommend to virtually anyone who asked.",1085097600,4,2256,4.91820580474934
2008531,5,B0001JXOVC,"Let me start by saying that I am NOT a Tom Cruise fan.  That said, this movie is a great movie.  While Cruise is the main character and the story is sort of told through him, there is more emphasis on the character Katsumoto, and Japan as the setting, and the story line.  When we see a Tom Cruise film, he is usually the center of the film and always a larger than life character.  It's hard to feel for him or relate to him.  Here he is portrayed more human, there is more feeling and he is not quite as self-centered in his performance, not as cocky.  The cinematography is beautiful and the story is captivating.  You feel for the samurai and are frustrated with the emperor, and you are actually happy with the way it all ends, in a bittersweet way.  I loved it!  Great movie!",1085011200,2,781,4.222972972972973
2008532,5,B0001JXOVC,"What we should appreciate before we get too deep into the odd story of Captain Algren is that he/it is strikingly similar to John Blackthorne, the English pilot of a Dutch ship that ends up in Japan in Clavell's near genius-like rendition of ""Shogun.""
Without discrediting Tom Cruise who acted brillinatly I thought, the story does live up to general aspects of the ""Shogun"" tale but falls short in  a few other areas. The love affair with Cruise and Taka is sweet but with Blackthorne and Mariko it was detailed, passionate, forbidden and conspiratorial.
Likewise, the transition that Cruise makes into Japanese society is in fact, believable however it seems to happen swiftly. Too swiftly to remain completely credible. The script and Cruise's voiceover explains his love of the discipline and simplicity, which interestingly enough is what seduces Blackthorne. Well. Really seduces Blackthorne. But then again, it is Nathan that/who becomes a true warrior, and I must again give kudos to Cruise who appears believable in the great physicality of the Bushido spirit and the battle scenes.
All in all a nice ride, sufficient enough to take it out of the 'manly men doing manly things' genre and allow you to think.
Ken Wanatabe as Katsumoto is excellent and should have won him a best supporting. Taka is wonderful; the children are animated and innocent. The use of Cruise speaking Japanese was an excellent touch and again, seemed to add credibility. I should also mention that there are similar 'blood lines' in the Indian Rights oriented ""A Man Called Horse,"" less interesting, less fulfilling, but possibly equally provacative.
Good job to all. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury",1085011200,2,1678,5.079710144927536
2008533,3,B0001JXOVC,"To someone who's actually studied a little Asian history, this was an enjoyable but weird film to watch.  Let me present this scenario:

An American of Eastern European descent makes a movie in which a Polish Jew becomes a disciple of Prof. Ernst Haeckel, noted zoologist and early proponent of ideas associated with Nazism: racial war, that Germans were the most superior race of all, and complete suppression of any opposing viewpoints.

Wouldn't that strike you as strange?

And yet that's pretty much what you get with ""The Last Samurai"" - an American movie based on the Meiji-era Satsuma rebellion led by Saigo Takamori, an Imperial loyalist who advocated a return to traditional Japanese values and (incidentally) the military conquest of Asia to establish an all-encompassing Japanese empire loyal to the divine emporer.

Do Saigo's values sound familiar?  They should.  The Japanese role in WWII was founded on similar notions.

So in order to create a viable and sympathetic ""Last Samurai,"" director Zawick and screenwriter Logan created a fictional Katsumoto to replace the historical Saigo.  This way, they were able to focus on a pastoral outlook of samurai life and discipline - which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  In doing so, they created a very pretty film filled with very pretty images and highly sterilized ideas.  What's bad about it is that the film warps history (badly) and is filled with countless cliche's - sakura blossoms, seppuku, calligraphy, etc.

The plot is essentially ""an American faced with the horrible reality of his Western way of life abandons his roots and finds truth in another culture.""  Captain Algren, scarred by his role in the Indian Wars, accepts a commision from a big-business-controlled Meiji emporer to train the Japanese army (recently armed by the US) and to take out a band of rebel samurai.  These samurai are led by Katsumoto, a samurai of impeccable honor who opposes the Westernization of Japan because of its corruptive influence.  Algren is taken prisoner by Katsumoto and comes around to his captor's viewpoint during his captivity.  He joins Katsumoto's rebellion and learns bushido, the ""way of the warrior.""  In a final all-out onslaught, Algren and Katsumoto lead the rebel bunch into a battle against the new Westernized Japanese army.  The rebels are slaughtered, and Katsumoto, mortally wounded, commits seppuku while commenting on the perfection of cherry blossoms.  The young Meiji emporer, on hearing the manner in which this loyal samurai perished, rejects Westernism and gives all of the evil businessman's money to the people.  Algren returns to Katsumoto's village, apparently to live out the rest of his days as in pastoral rural peace.

Could we get any more cliche'?

It's a great piece of eye- and mind-candy - the shining highpoint in the century-long Western infatuation with Far Eastern culture.  It's a lovesong to the romantic ideas of Orientalism - a throwback to the days when American housewives wore kimonos and played mah-jong.  It's the same myopic viewpoint that helped make Bruce Lee the myth he is today, rather than the footnote that he deserved to be.  It's a fable that expounds the ideals of bushido, rather than directly face the full gamut of samurai life.  The rolling shots of New Zealand (why not shoot the movie in Japan?) are gorgeous, the swordplay is gracefully violent, and the natural earth- and woodtones are so peaceful and Zen-like.  This movie is perfectly marketed to an American audience still flirting with Zen, to whom green tea flavoring is trendy, and who buy Japenese paper lamps sold at IKEA.

I can certainly understand reviewer ""minnanouta's"" violent reaction to the film, although I don't share it.  Koreans in particular are bound to hate this movie, given the invasion they suffered during WWII - an invasion once designed and supported by the real ""Last Samurai.""  Americans and Europeans, still in the throes of ""yellow fever,"" will love this flick.  Other Asians will scratch their heads, go ""hmmm,"" and say, ""Oh, Americans made this movie.  That makes sense, sort of.""

This could have been a great movie, had it presented balanced viewpoints from both Katsumoto and the industrial tycoon who opposed him.  Had this film actually portrayed history, it could have been wonderful - the ambiguities and impurities to both sides of a tenacious struggle in which there is no one correct way.  The Meiji Restoration was a tumultuous period in Japanese history, and the struggles of the period were highly layered and complex.

Instead, Zawick and Logan gave us a fable and a fairy tale, and so their historical narrative is severely weakened.  It's a gross over-simplification of something very real and very relevant to modern times - but it's eye-catching and well-photographed, so it gets two stars.  Add one star for the wonderful screen presence of Ken Watanabe as Katsumoto, the one character in the movie anyone cared about.

If you're interested in more accurate portrayals of Japanese and samurai life, I suggest any of the Kurasawa samurai epics.  Jim Jarmusch's ""Ghost Dog"" is an interesting modern meditation of bushido, and many arthouse Yakuza flicks deal with issues of honor and loyalty in grittier, more human terms (check out ""Beat"" Takeshi's ""Brother"").

For great samurai reads get the Dark Horse reprints of ""Lone Wolf and Cub,"" Eiji Yoshikawa's ""Musashi,"" and Yukio Mishima's ""Patriotism.""

[Edit]  An infinitely better depiction of the Japanese samurai spirit is ""Letters from Iwo Jima.""  Sure, there are no pretty sakura blossoms, kimono, or katana duels - but the values so prized by the samurai - loyalty, bravery, and sacrifice - are displayed in a Thermopylae-type last stand by soldiers who knew that they were likely to die in order to buy time for their homeland.

2008555,4,B0001JXOVC,"Sunday, May 16, 2004 / 4 of 5 / Surprisingly good vehicle for Cruise.  Tom brings a suitably tortured mein to the role as a late 1870's army captain fresh off the Indian wars of the west.  Brought over to Japan to ostensibly modernize their army and remove the vestiges of the samurai caste he is quickly captured and spends the rest of the movie going through a `Dances with Wolves' transformation into a gaijin warrior.  Despite the simplistic plot, the movie is delivered with a great earnestness and sense of purpose.  Watanabe is at once fierce and serene as the lead samurai, [was he a daimyo or in the service of one?].  This film hints at the beauty and depth of bushido, trying to make it understandable to the western sensibility.  I have a great love for Japanese culture, history, and aesthetics; and this film managed to mix in some wonderful examples of those.  While it may be decried as a star vehicle for Cruise I think one can watch and enjoy it from period piece point of view.  Recommended.",1084665600,2,1010,4.541436464088398
2008556,4,B0001JXOVC,"In The Last Samurai, Tom Cruise plays a post-Civil War army captain tortured by personal demons who goes to Japan to train imperial soldiers to fight against renegade samurai.  As circumstances would have it, he ends up fighting with the samurai against the imperial soldiers.  In doing so, he shares with his newfound samurai brethren his definition of honor, perserverence and respect...and they in turn share their versions of these concepts with him.
Being a big budget Hollywood film this movie has plenty of big fight scenes and lots of blood.  But the heart of this movie comes down to the interplay between Tom Cruise's character and the samurai he has befriended.  The wonderful interplay by the characters is backed up by the stark realization that, despite the two cultures (American and Japanese) being very different, they also share many things in common.
If all you're looking for is big budget blood and guts there are probably better options out there.  However, if you are looking for a strong story with equally strong characterizations that does a quite respectable job of illustrating the human condition -- especially the warrior condition -- then this probably a good movie for you.",1084665600,2,1205,5.035175879396985
2008557,4,B0001JXOVC,"The enduring spirit of master filmmaker Akira Kurosawa is alive and well in Edward Zwick's gorgeous, moving The Last Samurai. Wait, am I talking about a Tom Cruise movie? Why yes! And what a refreshing, vibrant, and even spiritual film this is. Through the movie's somewhat formulaic plot of the washed-up war hero with skeletons in the closet coming to learn the way of the samurai is a movie done truly in a classic Hollywood fashion. John Toll's cinematography is tear-inducingly brilliant in every frame, Hanz Zimmer's lush score proves haunting, and even Mr. Cruise creates a stunning, believable character arc as Nathan Algren, imprisoned by his samurai enemies, but eventually in love with the beauty and the legend of the art. There were elements of the film I wanted to dislike: Algren's voice-over narration that slides occasionally into cliche, the film's Hollywood ending, and a third act that begins to test patience. But Samurai is such an immensely satisfying experience (especially in its quaint, beautiful midsection where Algren comes to accept his destiny as a warrior) that those things become mere quibbles along the way. I can't say that Samurai is a masterpiece on par with even the slightest of the great samurai films, but it evokes a fondness for filmmaking to which I wish more filmmakers, like Zwick, would return more often. It's long, it's epic, it's a tear-jerker, and the battle scenes are so alive you have to blink twice. Call me a sucker for loving this beautiful, flawed movie, but try to resist it yourself. It's simply futile. GRADE: A-",1084665600,2,1574,4.965909090909091

no problems whatsoever to elevate your blood pressure with all
its furious swords fights, ninja assisnation, bows vs rifles
and the spectacular showdown between two armies with thousands
of real actors(no CG used) filling the entire screen. It is
simply superb in term of visual satisfactions.
As for the story itself, it is reasonably well constructed but
not without flaws. From the beginning of the film, you are led to believe that Ken Watanable is a master of war. In the final showdown, the bad guys with 4 regiments(one battalion has 210
men, according to the character played by Tom Cruise and one
regiment comprising 2 battalions)armed with rifles,machine guns
and cannons come to attack the samurai village, which is deep
in the mountain. Outnumbered and armed with swords, bow and arrow
, this supposedly wise samurai general with 500 fealess samurai,
already occupying higher ground ,decides to come down the mountain and takes on the enemy in an open field. And may I mention that the advice given to Watanable by the American captain is to ""take away the advantage of gun"".

2008562,5,B0001JXOVC,"Comparing Samurai to Nazi's is just plain stupid!  Should we compare the US army in the 1870's to Nazi's?
Is this movie history? I think so.  Not because of the events as depicted in the movie, but for an attempt to capture a people's values at some point of time. It was closer to bringing that viewpoint to life than even Kurosawa's epics which were influenced heavily by Shakesphere and other western themes. We forget that the stories of King Arthur are very large fabrications of the West's transition point to from the time of the ancients to middle ages, that the knights virtues in writing were pure but in reality they were brutal instead of kind.
That is the point of movies, to inspire and build up our view of humanity while being careful not to extoll to heavilly the  villains. Tom Cruise's redemption after massacring Indians is one point of the film. How he finds peace and honor is another. How a society of traditional values finds itself eclipsed by the modern values of greed are clearly evident themes in both modern Japan and the US (whether it is true or not is not the point).  Can something in the Samurai spirit of the film be used to inspire us? Or must we only see this in films about hobbits and dwarfs (partially inspired by the horrors that Tolkein saw in WWI?
Technically the sword tactics were very well done and remain one of the few films that captures kenjutsu correctly. Cruise worked his tail off to make it credible and despite the time it would really would take to do so, it was still done well.
The filming in Japan was fantastic. The Meiji period where foreigners saw Japan as another China full of savages to be conquered is captured quite well. The Emperor who found himself in a position he was not prepared to handle with advisorsthat took advantage of him is also quite well captured. The leader of the Samurai was also well liked by the common people (then named a street after him shortly after he died) may not be the exact historical replica of the man but most of the Samurai following were ""pissed"" at loosing their swords and topknots which represented critical parts of their heritage, not about attacking Korea.
So the question is...do we want a documentary or a movie to inspire us?",1084579200,2,2240,4.564676616915423
2008563,5,B0001JXOVC,"The Last Samurai was one of those exceptionally rare films that I am sure I'll always remember.  The character of Katsumoto was magnificent, and Tom Cruise did a superb job portraying the captive who learned to find meaning in his life from a people very different.  I too became a captive of the discipline, honor, and other virtues depicted in the Samurai culture.  It was a completely absorbing movie...I hated for it to end.  Speaking of the end, I couldn't imagine how it could end well, and thought it a shame to watch 2 1/2 hours just to see the bad guys win.  But it actually had a fantastic ending--very satisfying.  I don't want to spoil it for those reading reviews who haven't seen the movie yet!

2008584,2,B0001JXOVC,"The sheer arrogance of this films is mind blowing. First of all, the thought that the Emperor of Japan needed the wisdom of an American to set things right in his kingdom is absurd. Secondly, aren't we all getting a little tired of Tom Cruise presenting himself as some sort of super man in his movies?  He, like Mel Gibson, has  often cast himself as characters whose bravery and martial skills are of almost mythic proportions.  Additionally, these heroes are frequently disillusioned, bitter men, who, through an orgy of blood and guts discover themselves and learn to love.
Folks, this is cookie cutter scripting. Those moments in this film where we are treated to shots of Cruise looking into the distance, steely eyed and noble are embarrassing. Is this really how Cruise thinks of himself? Is he so hot and so wonderful that the wife of the man he killed can't keep her hands off of him? This is one of many movies made over the years where a white man saves a picturesque but flawed culture. This is Eurocentric cultural insensitivity at its worst.
The script is a series of cliches superimposed on  19th century Japan. Sadly the story could very well be transfered to any other culture with a little tweak here and there. In spite of the lovely scenery and high quality of the cinematography, the film displays a shallow understanding of Japanese culture and suggests to me that its producers don't have a very high opinion of their audiences sophistication.",1084492800,8,1467,4.7637795275590555
2008585,4,B0001JXOVC,"I first watched this film in a theater, surrounded by a quiet group of twenty-something Japanese youths on dates. My feelings were a mix of dread and trepidation, being a North American watching a North American film about Japan in Japan among Japanese. And for this reason, I was rooting for the film to be good. I was not disappointed despite some of the film's drawbacks.
My first impression is that the character of Nathan Algren is predictable. It's all too obvious that he will need to be taught to be honorable by the very honorable Japanese. This is hard to swallow for a jaded Generation X-er like myself. Tom Cruise's acting, however sincere and well researched, struck me as forced and dare I say it, a tad strained. Perhaps this is blasphemous, but maybe another actor would have been a wiser choice? I'm writing this fully aware of Tom Cruise's guiding role in the film.
As for the art direction, the film makes a commendable attempt at creating Yokohama's port life during the Meiji era. Of course, the great volcano Fuji-san loomed a little too close to reflect reality. But anyone who has not been to Japan, wouldn't know that and wouldn't care, I suppose.
The real scene stealers are Koyuki and Watanabe Ken. Watanabe is powerful, charismatic and wholly manly in his role as an impassioned rebel samurai. Koyuki's loaded gazes and effective physical acting gives us a stellar performance and she doesn't even speak a word of English throughout the film.
Lastly, the portrayal of samurai village life with its emphasis on training truly portray the spirit of Bushido, and in a larger sense one of the underlying characteristics of Japanese belief, the pursuit of mastery.
On a side note, the scenes of domestic life introduce a more realistic view of Japanese home life beyond the one-dimentional perspective held by North Americans. There is nary a piece of sushi or teriyaki chicken to be seen on the dinner table.
The film is a wonderful introduction to Japan at that time, and for those familiar with Japanese history already, it's an affirming portrayal of the challenging and exciting times of Meiji. Secondly, it's a first rate drama, gripping the viewer in a coming of age story, and reminding us that even though West and East cannot meet or agree, that Western people and Eastern people can meet and moreover, be worthy of each other. All in all, The Last Samurai would take a rightful place in your home movie collection.",1084492800,,2448,4.803317535545023

2008588,5,B0001JXOVC,"I am NOT a Tom Cruise fan. That explains why I waited until the DVD release to rent it on Netflix. That was a mistake because this epic is all that. Maybe it is my clarity on the context surrounding the participants that caused me to be so engrossed.

I wonder how many of you are aware that the three leading industrial powers at the turn of the 20th century where Britian, Germany and Japan? Isn't it ironic that the US was not one of the elite? What is amazing is the instantaneous metamorphosis of Japan from a feudal society to a major industrial power. The setting  of this movie is about the transition from ""the old ways to the new ways.""

Tom Cruise plays Captain Nathan Algren, formerly of the 7th Calvary, sent to Japan to train the Emperor's army in western warfare tactics. This would be the infamous Custer's calvary. The Custer who opened up ""Thieves Road"" to the Black Hills. The same calvary that went looking for one helpless Native American village too many. The Captain left the calvary before its demise at Little Big Horn. He is imbued with nightmares from the massacre of the Southern Cheyenne. This is the first historically accurate portrayal of Custer EVER by Hollywood.

These two contexts are the heart of this movie and it is amazing to see how a cowboy becomes an indian. Cruise isn't bad in this movie but I'm not raving about it because of him. The Japanese actors are absolutely engrossing in their first film before western audiences. They are credible and believable and there is a complete absence of the overacting ubiquitious in so many films. Ken Watanabe has the key role as the Last Samurai leader, Katsumoto, who is dedicated heart and soul to the code of bushido. He is also the heart and soul of this movie. Shin Koyamada plays Nobutada, the son of Katsumoto and is unforgettable. We are also introduced to a captivatingly beautiful actress Koyuki, who plays the sister of Katsumoto and wife of a samurai slain by Algren.

There are so many great lines and enveloping dialogue but the best is when Cruise character tells Colonel Bagley:

""You want me to kill THE ENEMIES of Jappos, I'll kill THE ENEMIES of Jappos... Rebs, The Souix, The Cheyenne... For $500 a month I'll kill whoever you want. But keep one thing in mind, I'd gladly kill you for free.""

This movie is about duty and honor and being faithful to these principles. It is also about the power of redemption that can be acheived by commiting to these values. This makes a great double feature along with Kurosawa's Ran. It is the first Tom Cruise movie that I've ever purchased!",1084406400,3,2585,4.606521739130435

2008590,5,B0001JXOVC,"""The Last Samurai"" was certainly one of the best movies of 2003.  The main story is a reverent account of the character of the Japanese people and the Samurai in particular, but there's much more to it than simply that.  The film has many subplots and resolves them all neatly without ever seeming contrived.  Everything from Algren's (Tom Cruise) search for peace to his understated yet elegant love story with Taka (Koyuki) is handled as well as it conceivably could be.  Writer John Logan avoids the overwrought melodrama that burdens most war movies; everything is as quietly graceful as the Samurai way of living depicted within the film.
The acting is, on every front, excellent.  Tom Cruise gives an uncharacteristically melancholy performance as Captain Nathan Algren, while Ken Watanabe perfectly encapsulates the quiet honor of Samurai leader Katsumoto.  The actors cast in the supporting roles are equally suited to the film, each giving realistic and powerful performances by turns.
Director Edward Zwick infuses the entire film with the necessary serene feel.  He uses well-placed camera angles to complement and enhance the already magnificent sets, and even cliched choices (such as Algren's choppy, blurred memories) are handled competently.  The only area that Zwick falls a little short in is in his directing of the action.  Despite the R rating of the film, he displays a timidity in his direction which, at times, makes it blatantly obvious that these are stunts.  Even still, this movie is not an action film, and it's appropriate that Zwick kept it from becoming a visceral bloodbath.  This isn't too say that there aren't graphic depictions of violence, but Zwick generally avoids the blatant displays which fill movies like ""Kill Bill"", preferring to quickly cut away from gory moments.
If ""The Last Samurai"" has a real problem, it's that the story is about somewhat immaterial concepts: tradition, honor, and the character of a culture.  It can be difficult to emotionally connect with things of such abstract nature, but even still, it's as elegant a defense of such things as the moviegoer is likely to find.  And the stories of the characters and their relationships within this defense are powerful enough to provide more than enough emotional resonance to compensate.
In a year that saw the release of many excellent films, ""The Last Samurai"" is among the best.  Patient, mature viewers will find much to admire herein, though those seeking a light-hearted action romp may wish to look elsewhere.",1084233600,4,2527,5.116788321167883

2008593,4,B0001JXOVC,"Throw in a wolf and some blue face paint and that's pretty much what you've got: Dances with Wolves meets Braveheart. Civil war soldier thrown into the culture of his enemy mixed with a social class fighting for their right to exist.
Aside from the derivative nature of the movie (and the music; it was at times note for note The Thin Red Line, but they were both done by Hans Zimmer so at least in his case he was ripping himself), it was actually a pretty good film. Tom Cruise carries the film brilliantly and outshines any other cast member by far, partly because his character was the only one that was shown to develop.
The message of the film is a very positive one, that of honor and courage, even in the face of unbeatable odds, a code almost completely foreign to the average American. Even with this, it's a still a somewhat depressing film, watching the demise of an ancient and majestic society, which was traded in for the pop culture of the West.
At times the action was a little overwhelming for this type of film. At one point there was an attack from ninjas that almost degenerated into Kill Bill Vol. 1 - a little too much ninja for the epic journey film maybe. The last criticism is a technical one - while the cinematography was wonderful, the sets were not. There are times, mostly at the beginning when we see shots of San Francisco, and then a distance shot of Mt. Fuji, that it looks less real than a Bob Ross painting. I really wouldn't have expected this from such a high budget film.",1084147200,3,1511,4.4
2008604,4,B0001JXOVC,"I looked forward to this movie for such a long time. Ever since I heard it was being made. There were those people saying ""Tom Cruise as a samurai?"" which was followed by laughter. Myself, I was optimistic. Who though Mel Gibson could play William Wallace? I actually didn't see it till later in its theatrical run. I was, as many others were, engrossed by The Return of the King. But I eventually saw it and again as I watch it on DVD I can't help but love this movie. It is rare we see a Hollywood movie focus on Japanese culture. Everything Hollywood puts out on Asian culture is of course, martial arts.
 Tom Cruise starts as Nathan Algren. A decorated civil war hero, who, as most war veterans will say, is haunted by his past. He is hired by one of the Emperors advisors (Harada) to train the military of Japan in modern warfare. Along for the ride is Zebulan Gant (Connolly) and Colonel Bagley (Goldwyn), a previous superior who Algren detests. Shortly after Algren begins training the men, an incident forces Bagley to send the unprepared troops off to battle. They, of course, lose to the samurai led by Katsumoto (Watanabe) and Algren is captured. As he is being held at the village of the Samurai he learns their ways and befriend Katsumoto. As promised when winter ends Katsumoto returns Algren where he must make the choice to go home or join the samurai and defend what he has come to love.
 Tom Cruise is one of those actors whose good looks overshadow his acting ability. By that I mean that a lot of people don't think he is a talented actor because all the women love him. Group him in with actors like Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio. All three are talented actors, and Cruise shows it with this movie. While his performance here isn't on par with films such as Magnolia and Jerry Maguire, he still gives a powerful performance. He is upstaged though by Ken Watanabe as the Samurai leader. Watanabe brilliantly captures the essence of a samurai warrior. You really want this guy to win, although you know he can't. The ending is something that will bring tears to many people's eyes. The supporting cast doesn't get the same time or emphasis but they pull it off well. We didn't get to see enough of Billy Connolly, but he was good. I really enjoyed Hiroyuki Sanada as Kotsumoto's most loyal friend. He is the true picture as well for a warrior.
 I have enjoyed Edward Zwick movies since I have begun watching them. Glory of course is the best. This movie may not quite live up to Glory but it is sure nice to see them making a film about a subject that I never thought we would see in film again. Although this movie never will live up to Shogun, it comes close thanks to the script by Logan, Zwick, and Herskovitz. They capture the very essence of a samurai in their screenplay. The set designs are beautiful, along with the costumes. Never have I seen a movie about Japan in the 1800's that looked so real. It gave you the feeling that you were there in Japan with them. The score by Hans Zimmer is equally impressive. Gone is the loud obnoxious music from MI:2 and other action score, and is a gorgeous sounding that never overpowers the movie but compliments it.
 Despite the pro's we are given cons. One problem I had with the movie is the relationship between Algren and Taka (Koyuki) are never fully explored. I loved that story line. He kills her husband in battle and she is forced to help him heal. They grow closer and closer. I would have liked more. Also I had a problem with the ending. I understand why they did what they did, but I think it would have been a better ending with the final battle. But those were the only problems I could find with the movie.
 So in the end, I recommend you seeing this movie. It brilliantly captures what life in Japan was at that time period. It showcases amazing performances by Watanabe, Cruise, and a great supporting cast. The cinematography is beautiful as is the set design. While the battles in this movie won't match up to a lot of others we see today it doesn't matter. This isn't a movie about battle but about living. Hence the quotes ""Tell me how he died."" ""I will tell you how he lived.""

Ken Wantanabe is a superb actor. And now in my top 5. He plays the role of Katsumoto whom the Tom Cruise character is hired to flush out and destroy.  Katsumoto is the sort of leader whom rules with a firm yet honorable & compassionate fist.  He is the leader that we wish we had. His faiths and beliefs are rendered beautifully for the viewer yet does not bash you over the head. You easily accept & believe his convictions.
Now for the fight scenes. Great work. The first scene when the troops engage with the Samurai is phenomenal and will surely send a chill up you spine as you hear Samurai battle cry through the morning fog. This scene is a pivotal point in the film as you are taken deeply (as deeply as Hollywood will go that is) into a glorious aspect of Japanese culture on its decline.
And the final battle scene will have your heart beating at top speed and I assure that you will ask yourself.
""Could I do that?""
""Is there anything that I believe in so much?""
And lastly the love interest. What Hollywood flick would be without this element? All I will say is that it is handled in a very graceful manner. Well done.
I am please that I had the chance to see this movie and it has prompted my interest in the code of the Samurai which is called Bushido for ""way of the warrior"". For that I thank all involved.
As for Tom Cruise... he plays his part well enough but you never see him as his character. You see him as Tom Cruise playing this character. I am very much so looking forward to the day when he can lose himself and his image does not block you from viewing and connecting with the character he is playing.",1084147200,,1846,4.209039548022599
2008608,4,B0001JXOVC,"I liked this movie more than I thought I would.  My expectations were for something both violent and saccharine.  Certainly, a beautiful story about the transformation of the Japanese culture without the Tom Cruise character, but the story of Nathan Algren is a nice mirror to that of the real hero of the story, Katsumoto who is portrayed in magnificent fashion by Ken Wantanabe.
At the beginning of the story, Algren is a lost and drunken soul performing as a shill in a traveling sideshow.  He is drawn into a minor program of the American trade delegation to train Japanese soldiers to use Western military weapons and to perform as Western soldiers in the suppression of a band of renegade Samurai.
They are rushed to battle against Algren's recommendations and are brutally defeated.  Algren fights bravely.  In fact, he wouldn't mind dying.  Instead, his bravery interest Katsumoto and he is spared, nursed back to health, and learns some of the ways of the Samurai.  Of course, he is won over to their cause and helps them in their final battle against the massed armies of the Emperor.
That is all I want to say about the story.  It really does work and is filmed very beautifully (and a strong reason for the widescreen version).  Those who want an action film might not like the time devoted to Algren's finding himself and becoming sympathetic to the Samurai.  I am glad to have that part of the story.  It also helps us get to know some of the other Samurai and their values and why they are willing to die rather than simply adopt Western Modernity.  It helps us realize what was being lost and corrupted.
I think it is a very good movie and the violence isn't too extreme and is not there for its own sake.",1084147200,,1721,4.588235294117647

I'm also not a big fan of Tom Cruise and his blockbuster style movie career.  A few of his films are entertaining (MIP, Top Gun, Taps), but not great.
This film is very enjoyable.  Katsumoto and Cruise's character have a very good and interesting relationship.  The scenes between the two have great dialogue...in that they are enemies with great respect for each other.
The cinematography is awesome (Widescreen edition is a must to get the full benefits.  Beautiful.  The clothing and buildings are historically accurate.

2008611,4,B0001JXOVC,"The Last Samurai has all the right ingredients of a modern day masterpiece, it's ultimate flaw however is it's too predictable Hollywood components.  The story revolves around tormented Civil War veteran Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) who is coerced to train the Japanese Emperor's troops in the use of modern western weaponry.  Standing in the way is a rebellion of samurai warriors led by Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe in his Oscar nominated role) who refuse to let go of their honorable traditions despite being at a disadvantage.  When Algren is captured, he learns and eventually adopts the way of the samurai; culminating in a would be epic battle that ends with a whimper.  It seemed screenwriter John Logan had bigger plans, but the Hollywood conventions injected here from director Edward Zwick and Cruise hamper what could have been something really special.  That aside though, the Last Samurai is still a great film, and Cruise and Watanabe are brilliant when both share the screen.

2008612,3,B0001JXOVC,"I enjoyed ""The Last Samurai"" as a piece of epic entertainment, but it misses true greatness by at least a mile. The movie might best be described as a hybrid of ""Dances With Wolves"" and ""Braveheart,"" with maybe a little ""Gladiator"" thrown in. I kept feeling like I'd seen this movie before.
Actually, the movie works best when it's in ""Dances"" mode, chronicling the adventures of a depressed white Civil War hero (Cruise in the Costner role) who adopts the lifestyle and teachings of a threatened civilization and ends up defending said civilization against encroaching white society. This is the most compelling aspect of the movie, even though its structure is borrowed whole from a film that most people now claim to despise because of its ""political correctness.""
Cruise is very good as Nathan Algren, the alien in 19th century Japan, caught in the middle of a civil war of another kind, between ancient Samurai warriors and a government seeking to ""modernize"" itself with weapons imported from the U.S. He's bested by Ken Watanabe as a Samurai tribal chief interested in learning the ways of his enemy. Algren eventually becomes an honorary Samurai himself and fights against his own people, in a climactic battle lifted entirely from ""Braveheart.""
Most of the action scenes are exciting, and there's plenty of Bushido lore and swordplay to keep Samurai enthusiasts happy. The photography is gorgeous, too. But it's still Hollywood's idea of an alien culture, a story told through the eyes of a white man who, by definition, can never fully experience the culture which the movie itself so desperately wants us to understand.",1084147200,3,1630,5.018450184501845
2008613,5,B0001JXOVC,"The Last Samurai was a great movie.  For you negative reviewers who decided to only give this 4 or less Stars instead of the 5, your comments are not really relevant to the quality of this movie.  I don't agree with your negative comments.  Probably the best ""American"" made Japanese movie of all time.  The acting, drama, story, action, characters were incredible.  Being that this was based partly on a true event, this makes this movie even more incredible and remarkable.  Everyone I know enjoyed this movie.  Others including me felt this was the best movie they've ever seen.  I have never been so involved dramatically when watching a movie.  There comes a time when you are watching a movie when you know what you are watching is a great movie.  I felt that way while watching this movie.  Incredible.
  The Special features were incredible also.  So many documentaries were incredible.  And I especially enjoyed the Japan premiere segment and hearing how the actors felt on the opening of this movie in November.  Very interesting comments. I only wished they had also included the other Theatrical Trailer which came out later.  But that doesn't diminish the quality of the special feature DVD.  It was very thorough and very interesting.
  For you reviewers such as Joe Haschka, Geoffrey S. Ryder, and Robert who only gave it 4 Stars, ridiculous.  Your criticisms had nothing to do with the quality and greatness of this movie.  You said it was a romanticized portrayal of the Samurai.  Yes, it was more idealized and positive, but nothing wrong with that.  If you have a problem with that, don't watch this movie.  But that doesn't detract from the movie.  And you keep trying to compare this to Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece the Seven Samurai.  Don't do that.  They are 2 different movies and to compare a movie with another one does not allow you to be unbiased.  You can't make a critical review of the movie.
To Joe Haschka who said this movie was 30 minutes too long.  Ridiculous.  This movie went by so fast and I wished it were 30 minutes longer or more.  However long this movie, I wish it were more because the story and quality of this movie made it incredible.  Nothing disrespectful to Master and Commander....,  but I saw that movie.  If you like it, that's good.  But I felt The Last Samurai was much better in my view.  I felt it was a much better movie and story from my view.  The Slo motion put even more drama on the characters and movie.  It was an incredible technique to use.  And please don't compare it to Dances with Wolves which alot have.  They have some similarities, but are 2 totally different movies about 2 different cultures.  Again, if you compare a movie to another movie, you can't be unbiased and can't make an objective review.
To Robert Graves who made a illogical negative remark that the Ninja fighting made the movie like Kill Bill 1, again not necessary review.  This movie was not Kill Bill and should not be compared to this.  Again, it seems another reviewer trying to find something wrong with this movie just to be negative.  The Ninja fight was just a fighting sequence that had nothing to do with Kill Bill 1.  And to make a ridiculous remark that you didn't like some of the visual effects such as the Mount Fuji Paintings or others as a reason for only giving this 4 out of 5 is again such a little reason to dislike a film.
  Alot of you people were just trying to find one little reason to dislike this movie for whatever reason.  This movie didn't deserve those annoying criticisms.  This was a great movie.  I wish you wouldn't give such negative reviews that weren't necessary.  Even though I say this, I can't make you change your mind and to each his own.  But I felt this was a great movie, and the flaws that you talked about that you felt about this movie don't have much relevancy with the movie I saw.

2008634,4,B0001JXOVC,"I was originally hesistant about watching this film, the main reason being Tom Cruise. I knew that with a larger than life star such as Cruise starring in a movie like this, the focus would be on him and not on the other characters. Guess what? I was right.
Even if I enjoyed the film immensely, I was so disappointed with the treatment of the other Samurai warriors apart from Katsumoto. Ujio particularly should have been given more screen time. Ken Watanabe and Hiroyuki Sanada were exceptional. Actually, all the Japanese actors did great jobs as actors, but Tom Cruise being the mega-superstar that he is naturally became the focus of every single scene he was in. A less popular actor than Tom Cruise would have been so much better for the film, since most of the time I had some real difficulty seeing the character Capt. Nathan Algren and not the movie star Tom Cruise. I thought the title of the film was The Last Samurai, not the Last American Civil War Veteran Who Came to Japan and Pretended to be a Samurai.",1084147200,6,1020,4.548913043478261
2008635,4,B0001JXOVC,"This movie is surprisingly good -- it is an exciting action film and is respectful of Japanese culture.  My friends who saw it liked it, including Japanese people.  That is interesting to know, because in general the Japanese I talked to did not like the TV series ""Shogun,"" which had a similar plot.  The makers of ""The Last Samurai"" clearly had affection and respect for their material, which is evident on the screen.  Some other thoughts I had:
- I liked all of the cast.  Tom Cruise, Ken Watanabe, and especially Hiroyuki Sanada as the supremely skilled warrior stood out for me.
- Director Ed Zwick also directed ""Glory"" (1989), one of my all time favorites.  His handling of the battle scenes in ""Samurai"" reminded me a lot of the earlier film.  The cinematography this time around was even better though.
- As people have pointed out, Akira Kurosawa and others have made awesome action movies about the samurai before.  I recommend ""Seven Samurai"" and ""Ran"" as two of the best.
- The Tom Cruise character makes this story about Japan more understandable and accessible for Westerners.  Some Japanese movies seem to end up on the art house circuit instead of in general release in the 'States because you have to understand a lot about Japan to appreciate the stories.  This movie won't suffer from that problem.
- Many (all?) little boys around the world who play war games with sticks know at least one Japanese word:  samurai.  In general I think they deserve their high reputation as civilized warriors because of their unique discipline and appreciation of the arts, religion, and philosopy.  That sets them apart from fighters of other times who were brutes or bullies without a code of morality.
Still, as I'm no longer a little boy, I have a more critical view of the samurai these days.  As it says on the DVD, they were a class of arisocrats, an unelected government who repressed the majority of the people in Japan for hundreds of years.  Watch Toshiro Mifune's incredibly moving speech about their injustices in ""The Seven Samurai.""  That was in the back of my mind as I watched Ken Watanabe, Tom Cruise and the rest gallop off to a glorious finale.  This film is a romanticized portrayal of the samurai, and I was comforted to recall during the movie's sad moments that their departure wasn't such a terrible thing after all.",1084060800,4,2346,4.738916256157635
2008636,5,B0001JXOVC,"I am no movie critic, just as no one else who writes their own user reviews on this site is but in many ways, we are more important than the world-reknowned movie ""experts"". While the Ebert's and Roeper's are constantly invited to big premiere's and likely never lay out one single dime to view a movie, it is us; the paying customers, whose dimes make or break a film. That being said, I have put my foot in my mouth in the past when discussing certain actors. Up til now, I've always felt Tom Cruise to be overrated and nothing more than eye candy for starstruck females.
As a mere movie fan, I feel as if every actor who achieves greatness has their definitive film that catches my attention and convinces me that they are more than I bargained for. Robert Deniro had ""Raging Bull"". Ray Liotta had ""Goodfellas"". Johnny Depp had ""Donnie Brasco"". Denzel Washington had ""Malcolm X"". Now, after years of consistently maintaining that Tom Cruise had no more acting talent than a dead carp, ""The Last Samurai"" has fully inserted foot into my mouth.
Actually, I should take a small step back. Within the past year, I have come to learn that Tom Cruise had personally help finance films that he saw that were running into trouble in the home stretch. When things began to look somewhat grim, Tom Cruise helped get ""Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Narc"" into American theaters and as a huge fan of both movies, I felt a need to tip my hat to Mr. Cruise for getting those movies attention that they may not otherwise had received. Like me, Tom Cruise was a fan on movies first and I respect that. However, I had yet to see his acting work turn me fully around. ""The Last Samurai"" changed that forever.
In short, Tom Cruise plays a Civil War Captain who has nightmares of murdering innocent Native Americans in battle. These nightmares feed his obvious drinking problem. He is offered a job for 4 times his regular pay to sail to Japan and train an army to battle the remains of the ancient samurai. Despite their inability to perform, the new Japanese army marches into battle prematurely and amidst a stampede by the samurai, he is captured alive.
During his captivity, he meets Katsumoto and through the winter months, he  slowly grows to understand their culture and their respect for life and death. All of this is climaxed in the final battle when he rides out in battle as a samurai with Katsumoto in what ends up being probably the greatest battle scene ever committed to film or at least on par with that of the Lord Of The Rings trilogy.
The acting by the entire cast is superb. Tom Cruise's transformation from tragic figure to hardened warrior is nothing short of flawless. The respectful manner in which the samurai is portrayed takes you back into a period in history where you clearly witness a clash of civilizations. One of the finest ways that this is captured is the poetic and ballet-esque motion of the battle sequences. One can tell immediately that the director went to great lengths to avoid having this film be categorized as merely another ""samurai flick"". It is instead a great, epic film about a culture that was driven into the annals of history and all but forgotten about.
The total package includes a supplement disc containing a virtual well of special features that take you on a stunning detailed ride behind the camera with interviews, historical comparisons, costume and set designs and training for battle sequences. A package this superbly concocted is a crime to ignore.",1084060800,4,3512,4.664516129032258

2008638,4,B0001JXOVC,"What a wonderful movie! In the same tradition as Dances With Wolves and Braveheart, this historical epic really showed me a world of amazing bravery and a beautiful culture that has found itself dying out.
The story is a classic hero's journey of a man haunted by deeds of his past, who finds unexpected redemption through his involvement with a people whom he at first sets out to destroy. Nathan Algren leaves behind his nightmares of his time spent in the American west to take a position in Japan, training the new Imperial Army to fight the ancient samurai who are rebelling against the government's efforts to modernize. Taken prisoner by the samurai leader, Katsumoto, he develops a bond with the great warrior and a respect and love for both the Japanese people and the samurai way of life. Adopting their ways as his own, eventually he finds a way to forgive himself for the atrocities he'd committed in his past and to find the honor he feels he doesn't deserve.
The settings in the movie are beautiful, depicting a bucolic and serene Japanese countryside steeped in mystery and tradition. Yet underneath it all lies the teeming violence inherent in the samurai way of life. Never for once are we allowed to forget that these men are trained warriors. Even in a moment of fun and celebration they are called upon to defend their people against cloaked assassins.
I admit that the ""Tom Cruise"" factor was a bit of a distraction for me. I was never quite able to forget that it was Tom Cruise on the screen, and perhaps if the movie had starred an actor with a lesser well-known resume, I might have been able to lose myself more in the mind of the hero. Still, Mr. Cruise did a wonderful job of showing the inner demons of Nathan Algren and the subsequent transformation that took him from a disillusioned Civil War hero to an honorary samurai warrior willing to lay down his life for a people and a way of life not his own but still worth saving.
I also loved Ken Watanabe, who demonstrated the quiet strength, wisdom and bravery that would have made his character, Katsumoto, a legend among both samurai and the Japanese people.
The only complaint I have is that I would have loved to see the relationship between Nathan and his caretaker, the beautiful Koyuki as Taka, developed. As it was, the love that grew between these two was shown in long gazes and even, eventually, an almost chaste kiss and a few lingering touches. Perhaps it is simply the romantic in me that would have loved to have seen more.
For a great story, this movie really fits the bill. Action, intrigue, a tortured hero and a subtle love story - between an American and the samurai culture - are all blended together to make for a wonderful experience.",1084060800,3,2736,4.608606557377049
2008639,5,B0001JXOVC,"Tom Cruise is a famous actor worldwide. Most of you have seen his work in various films, such as A Few Good Men or Jerry Maguire. However, Tom is back in a new movie, which takes the audience back into an era of the past - one that surrounds us in the days of the Civil War. Tom Cruise portrays a man named Nathan Algren, who is a hero during the Civil War, but is disillusioned of the terrible killings he had to perform under the leadership of Colonel Bagloney against the American Indians. He is hired, by the Japanese Emperor, to take down another rebellion by leading a army of Japanese peasants that never saw a gun in their life. Even though he trains them for a time, the rebels attack and Algren is ordered to track them down and defeat the adversary, despite the fact that more training is needed.
Fighting somewhere in the forests of Japan, his army is easily defeated and the rebels capture him and take him back to their village. Becoming a captive and not having a chance to escape, due to the fact that winter's coming, Algren spends his time with these people, already inspired and intrigued. He comes to learn that these people are ""Samurai"", who serve the Emperor and follow life through a different path and a set of principles that keep their life in balance, using such values as loyalty, duty, and compassion, just to name a few. Only one problem remains - Japan is facing a new modernized world and is seeking to keep up with the times by throwing away the traditions of old in favor of a more-friendly government. The rebellion, lead by a samurai named Katsumoto (portrayed by Ken Watanbe), despies that idea and fight back in order to keep their sacred ways alive. Gaining his sense of honor and redemption back, Algren joins the Samurai and aids them in a fierce battle that decides Japan's history for the rest of time.
The movie does have its dose of action scenes and story moments, but what really make this movie unique are its philosophical moments. The Samurai, as you know, are people that follow the way of the Bushido, the traditional code of the Japanese samurai, stressing honor, self-discipline, bravery, and simple living. It's the type of values that most people wish to live by, but the Samurai go far beyond that. If they are defeated in battle, then it means that they have dishonored themselves and their clan, thus will kill them for disgracing their families and those close to him or her. It's a tough life, to be sure, but it's the principles of their life that stands out. Tom Cruise said it best about the Samurai: ""They are an intriguing people. From the moment they wake, they devote themselves to the perfection of whatever they pursue. I have never seen such strong discipline.""
In order for the movie to display any realism, the movie was shot around various locations in Japan, from a temple located in Kyoto to a small Japanese town called Himeji. Not only the locations needed to be authentic, but also so did everything else, as this movie took place in two different worlds. Everything had to blend in for the movie a sense of honesty into the whole project. Though there is some historical inconsistencies in the plot, since this is based on a certain era in the past, those can be looked past.
The action is wild, but again, had to be realistic. So realistic, in fact, that there was some close calls on the set. Tom Cruise could have died, since an actor's sword nearly beheaded him. That's just one example, but just by checking out the loads of extras on the DVDs, the entire team was committed to the project, making sure that everything went smooth and made the picture look good as a whole. The fighting sequences also add some depth and insight as to how the Japanese and Americans deal with combat, especially in the climatic battle that had both samurai and soldier confronting each other in the end.
Overall, The Last Samurai is worth checking out, especially if you are a student of Japanese history or if you're into everything or anything Japanese. It's also some of Tom Cruise's best work by far. Anyone that's a huge fan of Cruise ought to pick up The Last Samurai.",1084060800,3,4143,4.56989247311828
2008640,4,B0001JXOVC,"The poetic resonance of ""The Last Samurai"" makes it a unique and thoughtful epic where two warriors contrasted by culture are akin in honor. The modernization of Japan serves as the underlying for the collision of differences between Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) and Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). Almost poetically and serenely does the movie converge these two characters as one is seeking his lost beliefs and the other is sustaining his honor from an ever-changing world.
The second act of ""The Last Samurai"" is the heart and soul of the movie as we marvel at the ways of the society from the sword training and disciplined lifestyle. All that is demolished by the third act. I admire the battle scenes and I do find it the source of the problem. Instead, the last scene was not necessary, it was inconsistent with the tone of the movie, and it went against everything the development of the movie. By having the modernized Japanese army kneel for the samurais and having the Emperor suddenly dismiss the arms agreement with the U.S. and becoming tearful for the samurais, it has sugarcoated the entire film. The film was about the honor carried by the samurais and how it is slowly diminishing beneath Western influences. Then all of a sudden, as if to make the audience feel a little bit better, director Edward Zwick decides to make a happy ending where all the samurais died victorious. We already know that the samurais are the heroes who died for a cause, but to have the Emperor suddenly feel apologetic makes him and the movie appear as feeble. It lost its greatness after the second act.

2008641,2,B0001JXOVC,"This movie shuffled along the line between action movie and epic story, and it kept a somewhat uneasy balance between those two styles.  It was beautifully, if obviously, shot, capturing both majestic landscapes and gorgeous detail, and the acting, for the most part, was very good.  Ken Watanabe deserves all the praise he has received for the role, and Koyuki performed very subtly and ably as the quasi-love interest. It also contained the requisite battle scenes, which I found to be effective in communicating the brutality and violence without being overly graphic and disgusting.  The scenes with the young emperor were perhaps the most moving of the entire film, and there was enough attention paid to the individual lives contained in the story without forgetting the big picture, so to speak.
It should have been a better movie... and I'm afraid that my disappointment in it lies mostly with the lead actor.  I don't like Tom Cruise... I don't find him attractive, and I don't think he's a good actor, and that definitely colored the movie for me.  The fact that Tom Cruise was supposed to be the person that carried the movie... well... I guess you can't argue with the box office.  Regardless, a lot of the lines he spoke or the story he represented seemed rather clichd, overdone, or plain anachronistic with the world around him.
As for the moral of the movie... that heritage and national identity should not be forgotten (and should especially not be exterminated) on the way to modernity... It managed to ring hollow while coming across too heavy handed.  However, considering the genre, it was a somewhat complex moral, as far as morals go.  It wasn't a bad movie, but I wasn't swept away either.  I give it about a 5 out of 10.",1084060800,,1746,4.774086378737541
2008642,4,B0001JXOVC,"Tom Cruise playing Capt. Nathan Algren was pedestrian in the visually captivating yet overly lengthy ""The Last Samurai"".  I couldn't shake the feeling that I was watching a remake of the epic mini series ""Shogun"".
Algren, is an alcoholic military hero carrying the emotional baggage of guilt, a result of numerous, senseless U.S. cavalry massacres of Western Indians.  He is recruited by an emissary of the emperor of Japan to help develope a Westernized army in 1876.  Japan is trying to mainstream itself into a modern economy and throw away the yoke of feudal samurai society.
The young naive and impressionable emperor, influenced by the lecherous emissary Omura played nicely by Masato Harada is attempting to quash a rebellious band of samurai lead by Katsumoto.  Katsumoto, the emperor's former teacher, is played skillfully by star of the flick Ken Watanabe.
In an attack by the inexperienced Japanese army, Cruise is wounded and captured by the samurai.  As a prisoner in the samarai village, he is eventually schooled in the disciplined ways of the samurai.  He is lured into their culture and ridding himself of his emotional demons becomes one of them.  He takes his place at the elbow of his mentor Katsumoto in the final battle against modernization.
The battle and fighting sequences were stunning, the way of samurai life enticing but the movie could have been edited to remove about 10-15 minutes of redundant action.",1084060800,,1434,5.0508474576271185

The suppressed emotion between Algren and Taka which turns from hate to love was beautifully done.

2008655,4,B0001JXOVC,"As a fan of the legendary Japanese director Akira Kurosawa, I held rather low expectations for a ""great Japanese Samurai epic"" starring, of all people, Tom Cruise.  Walking out of theater, I realized that the movie actually worked.
That's not to say it didn't have all the fundamental problems I was dreading.  Ninjas and assassins seem to come out of the woodwork so as to make sure the movie has the requisite number of ""Hollywood action-sequences.""  The harsh conditions of late feudal Japan were overly-aestheticized (somehow both the mud the pesands dig in and the blood spurted by slaughtered Samurai seem higher and more beautiful than mere blood or mud).  And while many of the most beautiful cinematography of the movie seemed drawn directly from Akira Kurosawa's films, Kurosawa's ability to show the corruption that can exist even on the ""good"" side of a struggle was sadly lacking.  But despite its simplicity, there was not one moment during the ""epic"" length movie that I became bored.
And, in the end, that is where The Last Samurai shines.  The soundtrack, the cinematography, the surprisingly good acting and the relatively slow pacing somehow combine to present a quiet, breathtaking version of feudal Japan.  It may not make the most profound statements about the world (despite its philosophical overtones), but it does succeed in transporting the viewer into its own beautiful world.

""Dances With Wolves"" in Japan?  Definately.
Amazing film making?  Umm, yeah, okay.
Terrific scenery and costumes?  Oooooh yeaaaaaah.
I'm *not* a Tom Cruise fan, but I *did* like this movie.",1083888000,,386,4.818181818181818

It would have been impossible for a foreigner to learn the japanese language and how to sword fight (japanese style) in such a small space of time as described in the movie. Basicly 6 months?? LOL
The movie is loosely based on the ""Satsuma Rebellion"" which took place in 1876-77 when a bunch of aging Samurai decided to take a last stand against the new Meiji Government. The Samurai fought well but eventually went extinct. The Last Samurai is a good movie though, in a world with a lack of Samurai flicks.",1083888000,2,614,4.491071428571429
2008658,4,B0001JXOVC,"'The Last Samurai' is yet another 'White Stranger in a Strange Land ' story.  The film has many similarities to Kevin Costner's 'Dances With Wolves' (noted by other astute reviewers); the Civil War is major factor in both central character's state of mind.  Both men choose to side with the natives, rather than the exploitative European culture that spawned them.  Like 'Wolves', this film is bloody and beautifully shot, with large battle sequences.
The supporting cast is excellent, with Ken Watanabe simply marvelous as the Samurai Leader, Katsumoto.  I found myself wondering just how this film would have played without the Tom Cruise character- I think just terrific, and would have been solely from the Japanese point of view.  I am dreaming here - Cruise shares producing credits, and the film probably would not have been made without his star power behind it.  Nevertheless, one does get tired of these movies with the 'Great White Hope' leading the way for the natives.
The one area I have real doubts about is how quickly the Samurai were to accept a Westerner into their insular society in the film.  This really stretches the imagination - even today, Japan is not exactly eager to bring foreigners within it's inner circles.  Japan was a VERY closed society in 1876, yet we are to believe that the Cruise character literally becomes one of them in a matter of months!
The film is beautiful to watch, with spectacular action and realistic battle scenes.  In spite of the obvious plot flaws, the film takes the opportunity to teach the viewer about Japanese culture; one sees the impact on future events (WWII and the Bushido Code, for example).  The final battle is inspiring, with the Spartan stand at Thermopylae being used to rally the Samurai against a clearly superior enemy.
All in all, 'The Last Samurai' was enjoyable in spite of it's Hollywood origins.  The whole idea of Tom Cruise as an adopted Japanese Samurai warrior really is farfetched, but somehow I left this film still impressed.  What it really comes down to is the supporting cast - they carried the film.  'Samurai' is really about Japan, and the Japanese actors did themselves and director Ed Zwick proud!",1083888000,2,2193,4.894594594594595
2008659,3,B0001JXOVC,"The Last Samurai is typical of epic Hollywood war-action/adventure films --impressive scenery, musical score and battle scenes, yet bogged down in cliches and contrived situations. Tom Cruise plays Captain Algren, an 1870s war hero who is tormented by memories of brutal battles against Indians. He is persuaded to travel to Japan to train the army to fight against the samurai, Japan's traditional warriors. The Japanese government, motivated by financial reasons, wants to modernize and develop relations with the West; the samurai, who represent Japan's noble cultural and warrior heritage, resist these changes.
Algren is not given sufficient time to properly train the army in the ways of modern warfare; he is forced to confront the samurai, who defeat the modern army with their discipline and ferocity. This is where the film lost me. Algren himself is only captured after single-handedly fighting off something like a dozen samurai warriors. It is of course a cliche of martial arts movies that the hero can take on countless opponents, but this film is more ambitious and attempts to be realistic, and it is absurd to imagine a man untrained in these traditional martial arts defeating all of these elite warriors with their own weapons. At this point, I was resigned to watching a generic Tom Cruise action hero rather than a believable character.
Algren is captured and allowed to recuperate so that the samurai might learn something of their enemy (there had to be some excuse for letting him live). He is even trained in their martial arts, which seems unlikely. Why would they train an enemy combatant? And the time it takes him to learn to fight with their weapons only highlights how unrealistic it was that he was unbeatable in his first battle (where he would more likely have been killed). Algren predictably comes to admire the samurai way of life and eventually sympathizes with their struggle. The film attempts to examine the complex issue of preserving traditions in a rapidly changing world. This is largely expressed in conversations between Algren and a samurai named Katsumoto (well played by Ken Watanabe). A woman named Taka (Koyuki) is the inevitable love interest, as the wife of a man Algren killed in battle. She struggles between her grief and growing fondness for Algren.
Although some of the interaction between Algren and Katsumoto is interesting, the film has a basic contradiction that it never really resolves.  It is superficially a sympathetic exploration of a traditional culture, yet at the same time it revels in the stereotype of the Great White Man who travels to distant lands and saves the day, a book and movie tradition that goes back at least as far as Kipling, where British colonists tamed the ""primitive"" people of Africa and Asia. Again, The Last Samurai seems to be more on the side of the colonized, yet this is belied by the huge role played by the Tom Cruise character.
Perhaps the most effective scene in the film is the last battle, where we see a rapid-firing cannon mowing down samurai warriors. This image is a stark image of modern society mechanically wiping out a less technologically advanced culture. Unfortunately, I didn't find most of the film equal to this theme. I think a better portrayal of a similar story can be found in the miniseries (based on a novel by James Clavell)  Shogun.",1083888000,,3361,4.968028419182948
2008660,5,B0001JXOVC,"THE LAST SAMURAI is for many of us a Sleeper of a movie.  The media mania was so high at the release time in the theaters that it seemed by the trailers that this was another massively expensive Epic riding on the Big Name Star vehicle.  Sadly, I avoided seeing this beautiful film on the big screen: now I wish I had not been so influenced by the hype.  THE LAST SAMURAI is at its core a very tender movie, a story of men overcoming their personal demons, of the power of allegiance to ideals, of forgiveness of the past and holding on to honor, of growth of the human spirit and soul.
1876, and America lands on the beautiful islands of Japan at the beckon of the Emperor to ""Westernize"" the country, and the army in particular, to stamp out the historical presence of the Samurai, a band of dedicated, gracefully trained warriors whose purpose was to defend the Emperor - a man believed to be the earthly manifestation of holiness.  The military men sent to perform this transformation are the guilt-ridden, alcoholic Civil War Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) and his commanding officer Colonel Bagley (Tony Goldwyn).  The two attempt to transform the inept army of the emperor's spokesman but when they encounter in battle the Samurai warriors and their leader Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) they are naturally beaten.  Algren, through his native skills as a fighting man, is captured by the Samurai and is forced to live by their customs in the house of the wife Taka (Koyuki) of a man Algren had killed.  Most of the film is concerned with the gradual spiritual awakening of Algren, his commitment to the Samurai principles of battle and of life and Director Edward Zwick handles this quietly and with great dignity by exploring the growing bond among Algren, Katsumoto, and Taka.  The ultimate confrontational battle between the last of the Samurai and the newly Westernized troops of the Emperors' advisors is not only epic in scale but also mythic in values.
The entire cast is excellent and a large cast this is!  But the kudos that have been awarded Watanabe have for some reason not fallen to Cruise.  They are both excellent as are Tony Goldwyn, Koyuki, Timothy Spall, etc.  The cinematography is breathtakingly beautiful, the musical score is thoughtfully eloquent, and the BIG scenes are a spectacularly Grand as the intimate scenes are extraordinarily tender.  Sometimes a great film passes us by because of the megalomania of the media hype overpowering the actual film.  Give this one a try in your home and see that it is better than you'd expected.",1083888000,2,2565,4.776018099547511
2008661,3,B0001JXOVC,"Reviewing the historical accuracy of Hollywood films is probably futile. What the heck, I do it anyway..
1) Americans had nothing to do with training the Japanese military during the period covered by this film. At the time (1876), America was not the place you would have gone looking for professional soldiers. The training came from Europe.
2) By the Meji period (1868-1912), the Samurai had become an idle aristocracy who could no longer be described as warriors. Getting rid of them was probably the best thing that ever happened to Japanese democracy.
That said, the film is beautifully photographed, and had some nice battle scenes. People get down on Tom Cruise for his limited acting range, but he does a good job here. The supporting cast is entirely watchable and believable.
If you're in the mood for an action flick that doesn't require much in the way of critical thinking, it's worth seeing.",1083888000,,906,4.8896103896103895

There is no commercials on the disc - thank god it goes right to the movie menu just like master and commander.  The movie is just brilliant.  Ken Watanabe is amazing and Tom Cruise gives us just a brilliant performance.  He pours his heart into this role and it shows.  Right down to the expression in his eyes- the emotions of the story show and he shines.  Not to mention the filming of this moving and the editing.  It is just beautiful to watch- the views of the country are breathtaking.  You would not be dissapointed in this one.,1083888000,,716,4.356060606060606
2008663,5,B0001JXOVC,"The Last Samurai is clearly Tom Cruise's best film to date. In the movie he plays Captain Nathan Algren a Civil War veteran who at first arrives in Japan to train the Emperor's army in modern warfare but then is captured by the very Samurai Warrior's he is supposed to be fighting against.
After being captured by the Samurai and their leader Katsumoto, played skillfully by Ken Watanabe he soon learns what the meaning of the word honor is. After being nursed back to health by the recently widowed Taka, played by Koyuki, Algren trains in the ways Samurai and then joins them in defending their way of life against the very army he helped to train. He also develops a romance with Taka, who besides being the sister of Katsumoto is also the very widow a Samurai Warrior that Algren killed.
In this movie you see some great scenery, and of course great action scenes. There is also a solid storyline and you really get to know the characters in this movie. The costuming was terrific and the weapons such as the swords were very authentic looking.

The love story is classy and not overdone as in most epics and the acting is wonderful. Tom Cruise delivers his most convincing role to date and this is one of the few parts I actually liked him in (thats saying a lot!). Of course, as mentioned in numerous reviews, Ken Watanabe steals the show as the Samurai leader and should have been awarded the Oscar over Tim Robbins. The action scenes are brutal and hold your interest, (SPOILERS!!!) but I didn't like the fact that Cruise was the only character to survive the final battle. Very unrealistic and is truly the only part that brings the film down a bit. Great cinematography and an excellent soundtrack as well. I must also mention the fact that very little CGI was used in this film and that just makes the battles and actual locations that much more believable.

2008686,4,B0001JXOVC,"As someone who studies Japanese sword arts, I initially approached this movie with a lot of trepidation... then a number of my colleagues saw it and had nothing but compliments. Well, as usual, I missed it in the theaters but recently enjoyed it on DVD (thankfully, DVDs are now being released just months after the movie is on the big screen!)
I liked this movie a lot. The cinematography was gorgeous. The acting ranged from good to excellent. Yes, the story was the same as any number of other movies, but so what? How often do we see a truly original movie storyline thse days? The treatment of the samurai and bushido was excellent, and the final battle (samurai vs cannons and guns) was truly horrific.
A few negatives - Algren was far too proficient after just a few months of training. But I suppose this is akin to Daniel-san training with Miyagi-sensei for a few months and then defeating the tournament champion... I can stand it. I did feel the ending was a total cop-out, and weakened the horror of the final battle. (spoilers ahead!) Algren should have died with the samurai. It would have been equally believeable to have the emperor decide on a new course for Japan based on reports of the deaths of Katsumoto and the samurai (perhaps after seeing the photos taken) and much more powerful to see the Taka and the villagers mourning the loss of the samurai and their way of life. But then again, many people would have found such a realistic but unhappy ending distasteful and perhaps they have a point - sometimes we need to watch movies to escape reality, not be reminded of it. And I have to admit there's a part of me that likes the idea of the tortured Algren finding peace in rustic Japan.
This is one I will be watching again.",1083801600,,1748,4.534810126582278
2008687,5,B0001JXOVC,"I have to agree with a previous reviewer. This is not Akira Kurasowa. If you want complete accuracy in regards to the Samurai society check out 'Ran'. If you want a great movie with beautiful scenery, great story, and HUGE battle scenes, watch this masterpiece. It fits perfectly in my collection between Braveheart, Glory, Dances with Wolves, and Saving Private Ryan....Epic.
The only thing this movie is lite on is a little bit of reality. As mentioned in previous reviews there are some discrepancies in regards to history which I believe can be written off as artistic license.
The only two parts I took issue with invloved the plot. Algren (Tom Cruise) effectivley neutralizing Samurai, and Ninja assasins. There is not much more dangerous combination in the history of mankind than a Samurai with his sword in hand.
Secondly the end would have been better had the mentally tortured Algren found peace thru death on the battlefield with his newly adopted comrades. I think he may have been the only one to survive to deliver his anti-western message at the end. This shows he had not fully adopted the Samurai way. He should have taken his life on the field of battle as to avoid capture, as Katsumoto did. Honor and saving face were paramount in Samurai society.
Regardless this movie is incredible and is essential for anyone into epic history/war movies. Theres even a little love thrown in for the ladies.",1083715200,,1414,4.847107438016529

2008689,4,B0001JXOVC,"If you loved Dances with Wolves, you'll love The Last Samurai.  The two movies have the same storyline - they even occur in the same time-period.  Just substitute Japanese for Native Americans.
This movie is a good mass-entertainment.  Japanese culture and history is dumbed-down for popular consumption.  Don't quite expect the realism we find in Kurosawa films here.  Like Dances with Wolves, this movie is painfully politically-correct.  I assume that the filmmakers were forced to proceed under the assumption that American audiences might not know what the Samurai - or indeed, the Japanese - are.  The unfortunate thing is that they are probably right.
We stop at all the expected signposts along the way.  The Tom Cruise character forms a growing love for the foreign, yet honorable, ways of the Samurai.  We are treated to the pre-requisite attack by Ninjas.  Fortunately, there are plenty of swordfights, but the level of realism is about the same as in Kill Bill (I know something of Japanese fencings and exchanges - like in Kurosawa films - are brief and deadly).
The film looks great.  Ken Watanabe gives a great performance as the eponymous Last Samurai.  Luckily, through an eye-popping coincidence, his character happens to speak English.  Tom Cruise does a better job than he was given credit for as the lead.
This film succeeds as an entertainment.  I am a sucker for Samurai films so - despite its being quite long - I was not bored.  It's a good, big-budget, action epic.",1083715200,2,1491,4.931726907630522

Others, like Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai, tend to only cover the ideals but twist the images we all have with the word ""Samurai"" by urbanizing it or whatever. This movie is great all around, of course there are things that someone will complain about, but I am completely satisfied with this film. Every actor/actress (Cruise, Watanabe, etc.) pull off each roll so believably, that you tend to either want or plain out give all your attention to this path that the Samurai take. The fighting is great because it shows the actually processes that original Samurai used to both follow, show, and perform in their everyday lives. Some of the images are straight out of a dream or a book about the Samurai. The areas are just gorgeous. The foreign actors, also bring a whole new respect to all others through this film. Overall this film is very emotional for some, but most of all, a tribute to the image and values of the Samurai. Hope you like it just as much as I did.",1083715200,,1088,4.417910447761194

But the story - argh! The story! - such schlock! Such triteness! Such utterly lacking not only in originality, it didn't even try to bother with putting some kind of creative spin on the rehashing of old stories. And of course the ubiquitous ""Man is healed up by the wife of the man he killed and at first she hates him but slowly they fall in love because he shows kindness to her son"" yada yada yada blah blah blah ad nauseum.
And as is typical, Cruise acts about as well as a puppet being controlled by a drunkard with palsy.  Why does this guy continue to get movie roles? Oh yeah, he'll draw people into the movie so the movie will make money. If it were me, and I were making a movie, Cruise would be my last choice. I'd rather havea  good movie I could be proud of then have ""star power"" to lure people into the theater.
And let's not even get into the fact that this story takes place at a pivotal moment in Japan's history - a very sad moment in time - and the film does no justice to significance of the end of the samurai except in a trite cliche way that no doubt appeals to the illformed emotional status of sophomores.
I went into this movie with excitement - in previews, it definitely looked beautifully filmed, and I'd heard that some Japanese historians helped with it to keep it pure and on target historically.  I thought, against the fact that Cruise is in it, it would manage to pull itself up and be something really special.  Sadly, it didn't. It might be historically accurate (in some ways), but being historically accurate is nowhere near the same as being historically relevant and sensitive.
Well, it tried. But it didn't try very much.
Overblown, overhyped, and over-rated sadly acted (except for the Japanese actors - all wonderful!) and poorly written script. And though the cinematography even sometimes tends towards clicheness, it is overall quite excellent and a pleasure to watch.",1083715200,7,1989,4.563025210084033
2008693,5,B0001JXOVC,"The year is 1876.  Tom Cruise portrays Captain Nathan Algren, a Civil War era soldier who is disillusioned with life and is haunted by his dishonorable actions perpetrated against the American Indian nations.  Facing an uncertain and directionless future, he is asked to travel to Japan to assist in training their Imperial army in modern combat using modern weapons.  This comes at a time in history when Japan is attempting to obliterate the Samurai system.
After much training and eventually engaging in an initial battle against the Samurai, Captain Algren is taken prisoner by the enemy and thrust into the unfamiliar world of a Japanese feudal society.  In the following months of captivity, Captain Algren becomes immersed in the Samurai culture where he eventually adapts to and embraces the sacred code of honor known as Bushido.  Using what he has learned and regaining his self-respect and dignity, Captain Algren and the Samurai confront the Japanese army in an epic and final battle that will determine the survival or demise of the Samurai warrior class.
I'm of the opinion that this role is not a career best for Tom Cruise but he does come across admirably and carries himself well.  The rest of the cast also performs very nicely and the story holds together for the movie's duration.  The cinematography, costumes, props, and scenery are all quite appealing through and through.  Open field battle scenes are beautifully choreographed and practically rival those of such movies as Braveheart, Glory, and The Patriot.

Movies that have some soul... movies that make you think and feel, all while keeping you entertained. The effects laden, poorly scripted, commericial marketing schemes that pass as movies these days leave me for one wondering what happeend to the days when movie making was an art and not a franchise.
But then, just as all hope seems lost along comes a movie like this to renew my faith in hollywood's abillity to put together a masterpiece.
The Last Sammuri takes place in the late 19th century, as america is in the end of the Indian wars (just after Custer's defeat at little big horn). At this time Japan is a nation undergoing remarkable change. The new Emperor has begun to modernize the formerly feudal nation at lightning speeds. Thus the stage is set in this oriental land for war between the old ways and the new ways. A rebellion of Sammuri warriors, who reject many of the new western ways has begun. The Japanese are at this time seeking advisors from all over the world to aid in thier modernization, including seeking military advisors from america to help train, update and lead the imperial army. An American Captain (Tom Cruise), a veteran of the indian wars, is hired towards this end - much thanks to the fact that he has experience fighting tribal leaders (the movie draws on the similarities between the sammuri and native american warriors). But Tom Cruise gets captured in the first encounter with the sammuri, and after living amongst these amazing people and learning thier ways, finds his own salvation in thier cause.
The plot isn't very complicated, but is rich in historical context and philisophical themes. All the charcters in the movies are very well done, and the acting in this film with only a few minor exceptions was absolutley fantastic (especially the portrayal of Katsomoto, which was just a brilliant performance).
The last sammuri has a little of everything. This is a movie that you will feel. You'll laugh, you'll be inspired, you'll be anxious, and you may even get a little watery eyed at some of the more tender moment. There's martial arts, humor, sword fighting, ninjas, battles, love, philosophy, drama - you name it. The movie has some great action sequences and battle scenes but these are not over-done - there is much more. The movie feels almost poetic at times, and the cinematogrophy is beautifully done. Many gorgeous shots are in the movie. And, unlike many movies, the slower scenes don't leave you yawning but are very well done. The music and audio too, was top notch, some of the best I've seen in a while.
all in all this became one of my all time favorite movies the moment I saw it. Many of the ellements reminded me of a slightly less gritty version of brave heart. And while Im not sure about the historical accuracy of the plot, the film does an AMAZING job depicting the beauty of japanese culture and the fascinating ways of the sammuri. Context-wise, the film hit it right oin the nose in terms of accuracy and really got it's points across all while being very entertaining.

I understand that this movie is not an accurate portrayal of the history of the Samurai or the history of Japan, but I do not believe that that in and of itself makes it a bad movie. For instance, I enjoyed watching ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" even though I know people can not fly. Even though I knew when I was watching this film that the historical portrayal was inaccurate, I still found the movie a very entertaining story. And it is my understanding that the making of this film was an attempt to honor the noble life of the Samurai that once existed in Japan.
This is a 2 and 1/2 hour movie that for me went by in what felt like minutes! I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie. I avoided seeing it in the theatre because I really didn't believe it would be so good nor did I think that I could find Tom Cruise believable as a Samurai. I'm not sure that I was ever convinced watching the film that Tom Cruise had truly became a Samurai, but none the less the strong storyline makes this film work! As does the great support acting from Ken Watanabe! And the other Samurai characters are developed enough in the plot that you do care what happens to them and feel sad when they die.
I did have a few reservations about the film. Most notable, I was a little disappointed in the ending in that the film had to go completely Hollywood and have the Japanese girl and the white man get together and presumably ""live happily ever after"". I thought a much better ending would have been to have Cruise's character die on the battlefield. If he had truly became a Samurai wouldn't he have wanted this as was the fates of the other Samurai?",1083628800,,1726,4.396875

2008711,4,B0001JXOVC,"Okay! Okay! It's not Kurosawa! It's not some fantastic hard to locate Samurai classic! It's not worth taking your hand out of your laps and getting out of your mom's basement long enough to go and purchase it!!! However, Mr. or Mrs. Purist, it certainly serves as a decent introduction into the Samurai film genre!!! Before I go any further, here's the lowdown:

Story- It really is ""Dances with Wolves"" with Samurai! Admittedly, it also reeked (in essence) of Mel Gibson's ""Braveheart"" and ""The Patriot""!! Shogun lite??!! Nevertheless, it still was a good film despite a lack of originality and the usual ""clich&eacute;'s"" of honor, loyalty, integrity and love. Noticed that I said that it was a GOOD film Mr. and Mrs. Purists, not a great one!!! Its good family fare and I hope will provoke interest in some of the other Samurai films (which usually are poor family fare). In all fairness, it should be stated that the purists are right in the fact that it's not exactly historically accurate and a little more research and a better script would have helped out a lot!
One issue I would like to address is this racist notion that a ""white guy"" running around playing Samurai is a ""bad"" thing. Admittedly, it's not exactly historically kosher but it isn't necessarily a horrible thing. Nevertheless, playing pin the label on the ""white guy"" isn't exactly kosher either!
Action- The action sequences are tightly and neatly done. The Samurai fan in me wanted more!!!  I would point out that I did think it a little over the top for Tom Cruise's character to become such a astoundingly formidable Samurai in such a short period of time! It did kind of remind me of the old Tom & Jerry cartoon skits where Tom learns how to ""Play the piano in three easy lessons!"" and just after hitting three keys he then rips into Chopin!!! Despite this, the fights were still entertaining, just far and few between! Parents should be warned that there is some blood involved but not on the level of ""Barveheart"".
Acting- This is where the good and the bad comes in. The good was the attractive performance Wantanabe gives. He appears to be enjoying the role and that is always infectious! Hey, Hollywood! Here's the guy for an updated version of ""Shogun""! Then, there is Tom. Tom! Tom! Tom! It's not that he's bad in this, he really is not. However, he really didn't fit the role. Most folks won't care and that's not a bad thing but Tom is certainly not Samurai! I couldn't say who would be but I know for certain that it isn't him! The problem really lies at the feet of his celebrity. He's just too well known. Every time he stepped into a scene, his being TOM CRUISE detracted from the moment and his decent performance. I would have to say that a more gruffly someone (the beard didn't sell Tom!) of less renown or an up and comer would have benefited the role a little better. This would have also placed more visual emphasis on a scene as a whole and prevented any celebrity distraction. Yes, Tom! You CAN be too popular for a film's good!!!! Nice try though!
The other actors gave us fine to solid performances but I'm sure that plenty of other Samurai lovin' ""Amazonians"" will try and learn us different.
DVD Quality- Issssss goooood!!! Why on earth anyone would want the full-screen version of such a film is totally beyond me??!!!! Death to full screen!!! Trust me; it's for your own good!!
Extras- The extras are fairly generous. I know that there will be those who will have demanded more but what more could they really want? I never quite understood the desire in demanding that every film have 4-6 hours of extras. I guess these folks have too much time on their hand (I know what I said)!! I would like to point out that the Hollywood vs. History was a slight let down. Instead of expert analysis, we got a fairly informative and slightly inaccurate historical overview on Samurai history. It would have been nicer to see a discussion between a panel of dusty old scholars rather than the movie promo we get. The rest of the extras are informative if a little on the short side.
In closing, Last Samurai is good but not a masterpiece but then it's not the master-piece of ca-ca as the purists would have you thinking. It not without it's faults but only after one devours a few of the films listed below will one begin to see what those faults are.
Next!!- Now then, where to go from here. Obviously, there are plenty of fine Samurai films to watch but not all of them are easy to come by. Here is small but decent list:
Older- Difficult to find comes with a *
Seven Samurai
Yojimbo
Sanjuro

During the movie one just sits there, awed in silence, feeling sadness and tragedy as one witnesses the demise and end of an ancient tradition and lifestyle, bushido (way of the warrior). My older sister, a well-known artist, couldn't stop commenting on the exquisite acting of Tom Cruise, Ken Watanabe, Hiroyuki Sanada,etc. I recommend this movie to people to have an interest in the Orient and its history and to anyone who enjoys a movie with a touching story, rich in sentiment and that evokes emotion.

""Not Real History But A Fun Fantasy Adventure"", is a simple way to describe this movie. I was very excited to hear this movie was coming out. I not only admire Edward Zwick's other movies but I am a Tom Cruise fan as well. Unfortunately I was very disappointed in the movie, Tom Cruise was fantastic and the cinematography is beautiful but the film is almost completely ""factless"". America did open up trade with Japan but French and German officers trained the Japanese imperial army, They at the time had the best Foot soldiers. Also the young Emperor of Japan was not torn between the new and old ways, He instead was the driving force behind modernizing Japan as fast as it did, he saw the Samurai as one of the main reasons Japan had fallen so far behind. The Samurai that rebelled against the Emperor were considered ""RONIN"" meaning Samurai with no master, and sense Samurai means ""To serve"" they were despised by the Samurai that served the Emperor and were perceived as Dishonorable. The rebel Samurai also had full divisions that used Firearms, it was not the Bows vs. Rifles you see in the movie. And most importantly it was not the Honorable Samurai protecting the Peasant people from the heartless new way of the Evil imperial Japanese Government, quit the opposite is true. Japan had been divided for more then a century, the clans had known nothing but war. When the Shogun took power the Emperor was nothing more then a symbol and was never allowed to leave his Palace. The Shogun had the real power and the whole time it was most of Japan, the peasants and working class that suffered under the Samurai, They were Honorable warriors but only to other Samurai, ordinary Japanese were considered Less then Men and could be killed at the whims of the Samurai. It was the modernization of Japan that threatened the rule of the Samurai with the Shogun being forced to step down in 1867 and put the power back in the hands of the Emperor as well as the working class of Japan. Most Samurai saw this and surrendered the old way to the new seeing that The Samurai were obsolete, but the few that rebelled were motivated by Power, status and wealth that they were losing and not for the People of Japan like the film so badly suggests. This is a fun film if you watch it as a fantasy adventure with no basis in history. I give it a low rating because even thought both Tom Cruise and Edward Zwick admit that this is not what really happened but wanted to capture the spirit of the Samurai in a fiction film, I feel this is irresponsible and that this film dishonors The real history of Japan. I would like to add that the Chinese feel Honoring the Samurai and Japanese values is like Honoring Nazis and their way of life and I don't blame them for feeling that way considering there History.",1082851200,30,2859,4.510597302504817
2008727,5,B0001JXOVC,"An excellent movie that I loved.... far, far more satisfying than the only LOTR movie I could sit through without getting bored, distraught, confused, or irritated - which was the 3rd instalment - Return of the King. But even the Return only amazed me with its special effects - among the finest ever.......

Unlike the over-rated LOTR trilogy, where none of the characters really comes alive, this magnificent film if full of characters one admires, and loves - the great Samurai characters, the grieving widow forced to nurse Cruise, and of course Cruise himself. We fall in love with the undeniably romanticized Samurai Japan, just as the Cruise character does, and mourn their destruction.

The issue of Japan's conversion to 'Western' values and the conflicts generated is admittedly over-simplified - Omura the evil vs. the honorable Samurai, and Japanese history distorted -but the beauty and power of the film still overwhelm its shortcomings.",1082764800,,951,5.209150326797386
2008728,4,B0001JXOVC,"The story follows a disillusioned American Civil War hero, Captain Nathan Algren, played by Tom Cruise, as he goes to Tokyo to train the Japanese army, who are embroiled in a battle with the remaining traditional Samurai. The Americans are there for the money, and that money is provided by the Emperor's Westernized advisors who want the Samurai out of the picture so that they may continue be the power behind the Emperor and increases their own wealth. In an early battle however, Algren is captured by the Samurai and held by them for the winter. During this time he learns the way of the Samurai and eventually ends up fighting alongside them - breaking his allegiance to the country he once fought for.

Ken Watanabe in his performance as the samurai leader Katsumoto dominates the screen. Through Watanabe we see that the samurai are noble and intelligent. Hiroyuki Sanada was impressive as Ujio, the tough, brutal, yet loyal and disciplined Samurai.

This film has amazing sets and battles. The sword fights are well rehearsed and the cinematography is well orchestrated. The costumes were striking and good replicas for a period movie. This film reminded me of Dances with wolves, which I also liked. Its not about which culture is more superior, it is about our mutual willingness to listen and learn from each other.",1082592000,8,1327,4.8933333333333335
2008729,5,B0001JXOVC,"Both Ken Watanabe and Tom Cruise did an outstanding job in their perfomrances in this movie, though for Watanabe san it was mere rotuine for him since he has regularly played such roles in his native homeland of Japan. His skills as a Samurai in this movie shined brightly and I was also taken by his english speaking capability. Tom Cruise also did a very good job in adapting for this role unlike other movies of his. After seeing other movies of his I was somewhat disappointed by his perfomrances. After purchasing a book about the making of this movie, it explained very well all the details as to what when into the making of this movie from choosing locations, costume design, history of the Samurai and other details. From reading this it not only shows that Tom Cruise put forth countless hours in preparing for this movie as an actor and at the same time displaying respect for the Japanese culture.
Special mention undoubtedly goes to both Koyuki and newcomer to me Hiroyuki Sanada. Though I have never seen Hiroyuki san myself while I was in Japan for the last eleven years, his performance fell nothing short of spectacular. As for Koyuki san, most of her roles in Japan have been those of Japanese dramas where she obvioulsy speaks her native tounge. In ""The Last Samurai"" she shows that she is able to gain your undivided attention not only by her beauty, but by her presence even if she does not have many speaking roles.
For those who do not understand the Japanese culture much at all, ""The Last Samurai"" can and will shed some light for you in not only understanding but appreciating the culture as well.
I intend not only to view this movie numerous times when I wish to view great perfomrances by these actors, but to also take me back to a country which I fell in love with while I was there.",1082505600,4,1814,4.533536585365853

2008731,5,B0001JXOVC,"I know it appears like Western culture is selfish and materialistic in comparison to the Eastern Asian experience. But, to be bold, I declare that it is so in the context of the time and place. There is good and ill in every social framework, and unlike a Costner film that shall remain unnamed, Samurai doesn't preach such a dogma.
Instead, the film lifts you above it, and illustrates a fundamental truth of the human condition. It does not blunt us over by our shortsightedness; it enlightens us with the truth, and reminds us that we are susceptible to succumbing to inner demons of wealth, power, and accumulation. What matters most are not the tangible treasures that surround us, but the inner intangible treasures that define us. Our pleasure, our pain, our trials and struggles. Our victories...and our monumental failures. They establish who we are, and how we lived, and if at least one person remembers that, then we shall find life again.
Perhaps, in some small way, that's what this movie has done. While not entirely historically correct, and not without it's grandiose notions of good and evil evident in a traditional epic of scope, what The Last Samurai does is remind us of that greater truth, the greater potential inside each and every one of us. Like the blossoms of the peach tree, they ultimately fall, but are born again in each subsequent generation that remembers and chooses to follow a similar path. And, if one looks carefully enough as the light fades in Autumn, one will see that each and every petal is indeed ""perfect.""",1082505600,2,1553,4.798507462686567

Cruise gets captured and slowly comes to realize he's been on the wrong side in a journey of self recovery and honor. Very well acted all-round with some excellent action scenes. The director cleverly does not fall in to any typical clichs, and the plot seems like a history channel biopic rather than an allegory.

Hyped-out to be a story about the last rebellion of the Samurai in 1877, I believe the movie's more profound than that. It's really about the struggle of Captain Nathan Algren (played amazingly by Tom Cruise) and his quest to find peace, after turning to the bottle to combat his tremendous guilt for slaughtering Native Americans in the cavalry raids.

I didn't go into it with any real expectations; I knew Cruise was a good actor; I hadn't read any reviews of the movie.  I found Ken Watanabe interesting, in pictures or snippets I had seen, regarding his nomination for Best Supporting Actor, but didn't know anything about him, and I expected the movie to be more similar to the ""Shogun,"" mini-series than anything else.  I was wrong - it couldn't have been more different from ""Shogun,"" and that's a *good* thing.
Cruise was good - I, personally, have not seen him do a bad job in any movie, yet.  He certainly met the high standards he set quite some time ago.  But, Ken Watanabe took the movie - his character was, in many respects, larger than life - he was intriguing, somewhat mystical, as well as a warrior, a man of honor.  Katsumoto, Watanabe's character, was a man who was doing his best to lead his people, and protect their traditions, as best he could, despite the opposition of his Emperor and the people advising him.
The movie was poignant, wrenching at times, the overall acting was superb, the cinematography breathtaking, the battle scenes drew you in and kept your attention throughout, and were not, I felt, overwhelming.
When the movie was over, both I and my son were left deeply moved by both the story and the wonderful performances of Mr. Watanabe and Mr. Cruise.

2008749,4,B0001JXOVC,"Being that this film is based on actual historical occurences it could've been the typical Hollywood silliness extraordinaire complete with massive innacuracies, tons of cheese and syrup, and a dishwashed script.
Incredibly, most of the above was avoided with the exception maybe of the historical innacuracies but even those coul've been severe and they weren't.
As the plot has been detailed by other reviewers I'll stick to the impression this film leaves you with. The ""Last Samurai"" is actually a pretty cool flick. The theme (encountered in other older films as well) of the westerner who goes over to Asia with the mindset of a clueless brute only to be engulfed by the age-old philosophy he comes in contact with there is well in effect here and it works like a dandy.
Cruise gives his usual very good performance but the show is actually stolen by the Japanese cast headed by the ""Katsumoto"" character (the Samurai leader) who's simply a treat to watch.
There is loads of battling in vast open fields and a lot of gore that accompanies it, and these escenes are absolutely great. The martian arts choreography is excellent and the filming is impeccable as well.
But what makes the film really tick are the sequences where after Cruise has been captured by the Samurai he has long and intriguing conversations with Katsumoto while at the same time he's trying to come to grips with a culture he not only doesnt understand but which charms him to death. These sequences are the top stuff this film has to offer and it does so with style.
While the Last Samurai does remind of the Lord of the Rings when it comes to the spectacular battle scene and it equally reminds of Braveheart with the super-underdogs taking on bravely the hordes of mechanised soldiers sent by the emperor to crush their rebellion it still maintains a life and heart of its own and keeps you hooked till the end which is (sadly)predictable, conventional and somewhat corny.
That, along with the fact that it is probably 20 minutes too long are the only minuses i could attribute to it. Sure, this is Hollywood spreading cliches again, as the Samurai weren't as noble as they are usually portrayed since they mindlessly accepted any order coming from the emperor and that included massacring ""opponents"" at his order regardless of guilt or innocence. But this type of cliche was to be expected.
Overall though, this is a probably unexpectedly cool film. Definately recommended, allthough if you see it on a small screen you'll be inevitably missing out on the great photography and camera work, but most importantly the stunning combat scenes, many of which are shot aereally.",1081296000,3,2654,4.848017621145375
2008750,5,B0001JXOVC,"We are huge fans of Japanese historical films and samurai epics (""Seven Samurai"" being the Valhalla of the genre)so we lined up early to see ""Last Samurai.""  I had seen the reviews with mixed feelings, fearful that Cruise's ""Top Gun"" arrogance would crash through the culture like a Hummer.
As it turned out, the Japanese cast led by Ken Watanbe keeps Cruise under control.  It was a little troubling to see Cruise's character completely master Katana technique and Iai waza in a single season, but I guess he had to to keep the plot moving.  Also, Cruise is a bit like Milton Berle - he has to be the last man off of every scene.  But Watanabe steals the movie and the supporting cast is terrific.  For once, Cruise doesn't seduce the woman who is forced to keep him in her house, and she complains that he smells bad.
In the end, the movie is a spectacular paen to Bushido culture. (I haven't yet asked an old friend of mine who survived Bataan what he thought of this movie).  The movie tackles a tricky and contradictory period of Japanese history, the great inner conflict between modernists (who won) and the feudalists, who probably were not all noble.  But heck, its the action scenes which are worth enduring Tom Cruise, and I sure liked watching him get pummeled by Watanabe's No. 2.

2008767,1,B0001JXOVC,"In the 19th Century Japan became part of the world. For hundreds of years the country was ruled by a prime minister who had the title of Shogun. His rule was backed by a feudal system of armed nobles who had retinues of hereditory warriors called samurai. Samurai were of noble birth and trained in both warrior skills and an ideology of warfare.
The 19th Century saw the Emperor of Japan sieze power from the Shogun and to end the feudal system creating a conscript army and a modern navy. To do this he imported overseas advisors, Prussians to train the army British and French to help with the navy. The change to the power structure lead to a revolt of the samurai class upset at the loss of their traditional privalages. This film is about this revolt.
Being an American film the action is seen through the prism of an American officer. This of course is the first point at which we move into the land of fairy tale. At the time of the events of this film America had a small army of no great reputation. However probably Tom Cruise does a poor German accent.
Rather than being a drama about what happened the film is about the Tom Cruise character. That is a person who has had his soul destroyed as he has been part of a massacre of Indian women and children. This has turned him into an alcoholic who is drifting through life. In this film he is redeemed.
He is captured by the samurai in a battle and then kept prisoner in a remote village for the winter. In his time he becomes a convert to the samurai life style and decides to switch sides in the last epic pointless battle to keep the feudal system going in Japan. In this way he redeams himself and heal the pain of the massacre. He is also able to kill the American officer who commanded him to kill the native Americans.
The film is gratutously insluting to important figures in Japanese history. The emperor Meiji who was responsible for modernising his country is portrayed instead as a figure of self confidence and vision, as a dithering boy who needs Tom Cruise to help him discover the true values of his country. Cruise in talking to his feudal buddies the Samurai immediately takes on a leadership role planning the last idiotic battle and gives them tiresome lectures about the wars between the Greeks and the Persians.
The film is not only laboured and tiresome it is reflective of American hubris and is unhistoric in putting them at the centre of events they had no part in.",1080777600,8,2452,4.463251670378619

2008773,5,B0001JXOVC,"""The Last Samarai"" is one of the greatest films released in 2003, starring Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe.  Its hardhitting impact is intense enough to keep audiences' eyes wide open through the whole movie.  Its written plot of a US soldier changing his life for the better in Japan is brilliant.  Despite the war themes, there are some great heartwarming scenes, namely when the US soldier starts healing his pains from his US war battles.  As he begins learning Japanese traditions, he begins learning more about himself, which plays a crutial part in the film.  As this develops, the drama also develops, which keeps audiences interested.  This allows the conflicts between the two sides to be brought out as brilliantly as it was.  His friends' life stories add an additional unique flavor.  The war scenes are uniquely intense.  Few other movies have thought of such original war scenery.  This teaches audiences that there is no one way to fight a war or to solve a conflict.
Its Oscar-nominated 1870's Japanese setting is flawless.  They prove that they did their research to construct such an elaborate set.  The war scenes are desplicted as brutal as they should thanks to the special effects.  The costumes are accurate from those times.  Such great background offers an improved sense of this masterpiece film.
Tom Cruise's underrated role as US soldier Nathan Algren is his best in years.  His two years of training to prepare for his role paid off.  He never loses his intense sense of emotion for a second.  The pain and agony expressed are as pure as if he actually lived it.  Ken Watanabe's Oscar-nominated role as Samarai leader Katsumoto rightfully places him in the spotlight.  This performance makes acting appear easy when it's actually the opposite.  He proves that he will become a big-name actor in the next following years.  All other actors also performed their roles beautifully.
""The Last Samarai"" is great for those looking for a unique war movie with emotion.  This is sure to please many audiences.  This is destined to be a classic in the following years as it deserves.",1080086400,8,2100,4.886685552407932
2008774,4,B0001JXOVC,"I thought it was going to be awful and I only went to see it because my fiance wanted to, but it turned out to be a film well worth watching and owning.  The acting (yes, even Tom Cruise) is generally good, the soundtrack stirring, the pacing taut, and the battle sequences awesome.  (The fight following the ninja assassination attempt is particularly well done.)  Yes, it's Shogun set later in time and minus Richard Chamberlain, but/and it's excellent.
The only problem worth mentioning is the ending.  I won't give anything away, but the events are improbable, and because of that they're less emotionally affecting than they should be.  I can think of a couple of better ways for the film to have ended. Still, a much better movie than it might seem.  I'll be buying it.",1080086400,2,775,4.661764705882353

superpowers dominations and attemp to change the inner cultures of other nations for the sake of self-centered interests and for the love of control. You'll find those elements somtimes hidden within the storytelling. The battle sequences are very well

2008776,4,B0001JXOVC,"I like this movie, but I found some things about it dissapointing.
First, lets get to the good things - the storyline wasn't anything special but the way the movie was done was amazing - the scenery was beautiful and a lot of the acting was really good. I'm also happy when I see asians in movies where they are actually acting because it's very rare that asians get casted as major roles in major movies in the US.
I was dissapointed, however, by the acting job Tom Cruise did. I understand that his character had been through a lot and this and that, but I found him very stiff and emotionless throughout the movie, and whether this was intended or not, I felt like it took away from the movie.
However, the acting jobs of many of the other people in this movie more than made up for it - more specifically, Katsumoto and his son were very good and the little boy that takes a liking to Tom Cruise was so cute and a very good actor, especially for someone of his age.
I was actually very pissed off when I heard that they nominated Tom Cruise for the oscar for this movie. I know he's famous and this and that, but I think hollywood needs to get over their political technichalities when choosing the oscars and nominate someone who can really act, even if they are Japanese and almost unknown.
This movie was very touching in many ways. I loved the ending and the climatic scene. It was all very well done.
HOwever, I was thoroughly dissapointed when they made Tom Cruise fall in love with the woman who was housing him. I felt that their relationship was much better as passive friends accepting each other, and the idea of that girl falling in love with the man who killed her husband so shortly after he died is highly improbable. I felt like they were adding a love scene to make it more like a typical hollywood success formula - they all need a love scene, don't they? NO. They don't. THis movie would have been much better without it.
Despite it's flaws though, and my personal problems with it, The Last Samurai is a good movie worth viewing at least once.",1079568000,3,2067,4.371428571428571

2008778,5,B0001JXOVC,"""The Last Samurai"" is, without a doubt, one of the finest action epics thatI have seen ever since ""Braveheart""! ""The Last Samurai"" is one of those rare films that combine a sweeping, heroic epic with an intimate, extremely poignant personal story of love, honor, and tenderness. The direction of Edward Zwick (""Glory"", ""Courage Under Fire"") was top-notch and powerful! And the performance of superstar Tom Cruise (""Minority Report"") was unforgettable! Surely one of the best Tom Cruise performances since ""Top Gun""!
The film focuses on Nathan Algren (Cruise), a decorated war hero (from the war against the American Indians) now drunkenly relegated to showing off new gun technology at expositions. Algren is offered handsome compensation to leave the States and help bring Japan into the modern age of guns and to suppress a revolt of nontechnological samurai making trouble in the hinterlands. During a raid that is botched by unready troops, Algren is captured but not before managing to cleverly kill off one of the most accomplished samurai. The samurai lord, Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), is impressed with Algren's magificent fighting spirit and resourcefulness and decides to nurse him back to health so that he might learn more about his enemy.
The premise revealed. I will skip the rest of the plot, saying only that it is inevitable that Algren comes to respect and then love the ways of his captors and becomes himself an accomplished warrior in their disciplined traditions. He soon allies himself against his former compatriots and must learn what true honor is and how both life and death can help one reach his destiny. Essentially, and I do not say this casually, this film is ""Dances with Wolves"" set among the Japanese ""other"" rather than the American ""other"".
The film started like a Tom Cruise movie, stopped being one for a fascinating hour or so, and then returned to its Hollywood roots. When we first see Cruise, he is doing his trademark Cruise acting: slightly over the top in his anger, drunkenness, and overall swagger. However, once Algren is abducted, we get to see some really nice stuff. Thank goodness for the strength and charisma of his co-star, Ken Watanabe as Katsumoto. Watanabe is as focused and economical an actor I have seen in some time and manages to communicate more rage, love, or concern in a steely glance than Cruise can with a monologue's worth of bluster.
It's great watching Algren and Katsumoto (and incidentally, Cruise and Watanabe) learn from each other and settle each other down. Cruise is at his best here when he's 'listening', when someone else is driving the scene. I dare say even that he's better when speaking his scant lines of Japanese than those in English because it forces him most convinvingly out of his element. However, just as we come to admire Cruise's identification with samurai stillness and restraint (and what one can achieve with a ""good death""), the spirit of the movie swings back across the Pacific to Hollywood again, and we have a fairly typical Cruise ending that betrays what we have come to appreciate most about ""The Last Samurai"" -- the acceptance of destiny. I won't spoil the end, but I will say that whether or not Algren survives the climactic battle (between sword-wielding samurai and newfangled howitzer repeating rifles) makes or breaks the point of Algren's spiritual conversion.
""The Last Samurai"" is beautifully filmed, and like two of director Ed Zwick's own definitive films -- ""Courage Under Fire"" and ""Glory"" -- this one asks challenging questions about honor and country from the perspective of outsiders. In conclusion, ""The Last Samurai"" not only has two unforgettable performances by Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe, but also a fine supporting cast including Timothy Spall, Billy Connolly, Tony Goldwyn, Koyuki, and William Atherton. ""The Last Samurai"" is a definite DVD must-have when it's released!",1079049600,7,3904,5.063664596273292
2008779,4,B0001JXOVC,"Meet Captain Nathan Algren (played by Tom Cruise), bona fide Civil War hero, celebrity endorser of Winchester rifles, and drunkard.  During the early years of the American political and cultural incursion into Japan, Algren is hired essentially as a mercenary to train the Imperial Japanese Army in the ways of modern warfare.  Before he has had a chance to do his job properly, he is called upon to lead a well-equipped but poorly trained force against a ""rebel"" army led by the samurai lord Katsumoto (played by Ken Watanabe).  During the initial engagement, Algren's force is routed by the samurai and Algren himself is taken prisoner by Katsumoto for the purpose of ""understanding my enemy.""

Thus begins the gradual transformation of Algren from a highly stereotyped American chauvinist to a member of Katsumoto's community.  The early reception is cold and unaccepting, both by Katsumoto's family and his fellow samurai, but over time a grudging tolerance gives way to cautious familiarity and ultimately to full acceptance and respect.  As I observed this process, I could not help being reminded of ""Dances With Wolves"", in which Kevin Costner's character undergoes a similar rebirth.  This notion was fueled even more by the romantic energy between Algren and the widow of a samurai whom he had killed during his capture.

Algren eventually rises to enjoy great respect and admiration among Katsumoto's people, becoming in effect the samurai lord's right-hand man and deputy commander.  He helps lead Katsumoto's forces in several battles against the Japanese army, including the climactic final engagement where his honor is put to the ultimate test (but I won't spoil the ending for those who haven't seen it yet).

Overall, I found this to be a very enjoyable and moving tale of the clash of cultures, somewhat loose in its historicity, with a strong emphasis on concepts like valor, honor and independence.  The story line was slightly cliche and more than a little romanticized, but hey, that's Hollywood.

2008791,4,B0001JXOVC,"You can read 175+ reviews about what the movie's plot is and what each character did, and about the bloodracing battle scenes. That's cool. In general, the movie is very manipulative emotionally and tangles you up immediately in the plot and especially the character played Tom Cruise. Another big point is that the cinematography and the just plain beauty of the mountains is captured with extraordinary talent and adds much to the ability of the movie to involve us. So go read the other reviews for this kind of information.
I'm interested in the mythos, the usage of stories to build structures of ideas, to support and extent values, in general the use of movies like this to teach moral legends. It is the storytellers art, the Homeric epics that once were passed down around campfires by old men to their grandchildren. Whispers in the dark about the giants of reknown, the heroes of the golden ages, the fighters like the battle of Thermopylae (a tale told in the movie) whose courage saved a nation. But what makes this not history but holy history, not even historical fiction but just mythos is the gap between the truth of what really was history and the storytellers art. In our age, we simply won't even believe it plausible if it doesn't proport to be history, it must be clothed in the rags of historical illusion, no matter about the bones of truth or flesh of reality. All that matters is that the clothing is authentic, the characters are believable to the masses of us who didn't get much out of 8th grade world history, let alone a college history of Japan class. Mythos must appear as logos (thanks to Karen Armstrong for the images), but appearances are all that truely matters. The storytellers art takes over immediately and operates from the beginning to weave a tale, to build a moralizing story that thrills us and challenges us to absorb the morality and those values presented in the movie.
The major value is honor, the battle of the underdog against overwhelming odds, the fight of old tradition and new technology. The samurai are presented as warrior Buddhist monks, ascetic and pure of heart, challenging their faults and getting better every day due to this passion for excellence and practice, practice, practice. And Tom Cruise's character is a samurai born out of place, a real warrior's heart, dismayed and beaten down by the brutal Army murders of native American women and children. Full of nightmares and sweats out the DT's, and falls in love with his real people, the mountain volk, where he learns Japanese in a winter, plus has a satori experience with sword fighting, all the time keeping a journal complete with sketches.
Well, maybe i am a little cynical, skeptical at being manipulating in such a blatant way, cautious at the prospect at going to a movie for entertainment and getting a moralizing message in such a direction and almost hamfisted way. I ask what is the object of the samurai's honor? Towards the emperor? only outwardly. Towards traditional family values? not with all the bloodshed and teaching boys to kill young. Towards life? not with the suicide impulse just below the surface. It appears to be honor for honor's sake, value without a fundamental object, without a big point, but honor simply as a survival value on the battlefield. To have honor motivates, inspires, swings the sword harder and longer, kills without compassion, it the basic utilitarian value of the warrior class. That is what the movie is about, the flowers and poetry, the buddhist chanting and zen archery are pieces tacked on to balance out the blood and glore of the battlescenes. For these humane values are not the ones which motivate the characters, but rather the glory of battle, not the fighting-for-the-guy-next-to-you that is so common in war movies, but the glory for oneself. The bloody sword at the end of the day dripping with the red life of your enemies. And it really doesn't matter who your enemies are: the American south, the cheyenne, the sioux, or the japos, or your ex-commanding officer, or..... It doesn't matter for all is but a stage to demonstrate and display your prowess as a hero, your stamina as a fighter, your perseverance as an honorable man. this is what i object to, value without purpose, utility without direction, heroes without Gods.
It is a gorgous movie, enough battlescenes for the most jaded martial arts afficiado, a little added metaphysics for those of us who like such things in our movies, but most of all a not-at-all subtile honor is valuable for its own sake take home message. I'd just be cautious of swallowing the point without thinking about the greater issues.",1078617600,4,4663,4.822721598002497
2008792,5,B0001JXOVC,"This is, without a doubt, the most underrated movie of 2003. This is Edward Zwick's crowning achievement and would be Tom Cruise's best performance if he hadn't been in ""Born on the 4th of July"". I enjoyed ""Master and Commander"" but it is so 2nd rate to this. This movie is a beautiful story about a civil war captain, scarred by the way he saw the Native Americans get salughtered by his fellow troops, who is brought by fate to these very spiritual people (the samurai), who learn him their customs and heal his psychological wounds. When his old American comrades come to bring down the samurai, he does all he can to defend them. It is similar to ""Dances with Wolves"" and ""Lawrence of Arabia"" in that it is about a depressed man who changes his ways. But I think that this movie is ultimately superior to them. (Another thing, the art and costume design in this movie are breathtaking, another reason to see this movie). This movie deserved the 10 oscar nominations ""Master & Commander"" recieved (including best picture).",1078617600,8,1025,4.668508287292818
2008793,5,B0001JXOVC,"After the opening of Japan in 1853 under the pressure of the US and their Perry expedition, and the restoration of Imperial power in 1867, things went very fast. Japan was modernized at first to the best profit of the USA. But this development brought strong resistance within Japan from the feudal order of the Samourais, and a very agressive expansion on the Asian continent.

This film concentrates on the final push against feudalism and its old code of honor represented by the Samourais.

This change was particularly brutal with imported weapons from the USA, an exclusive contract, and military counsellors. The move was led by some big capitalist families who were ruthless about the change and who violently eradicated all opposition to the final death of it and them. The film shows this very well. The character Tom Cruise embodies here is probably fictitious but it links the wars against the Indians in the US to this war against mountain tribes and villages in Japan.

The same objective : to impose industrial development in an extremely egotistic way : no honor, no real democracy, no concertation. Just change, and profits for a few. The film is short on one issue : this forced change led the new industrial aristocracy to an expansion that was carried out through war and the use of brutal force. Japan needed new markets and new workers.

They found them in Formosa, in China, in Manchuria, in Korea, and they even tried to conquer Siberia. We know what that process led to forty years later. We should never force foreign countries to change too fast and along a ruthless profit-minded road because profit knows no obstacles, and frustration leads to a need for historical compensation, and sooner or later the two come together.

Any country should have the right to change at its own rhythm and along its own logic.

He also comes to embrace the Samurai way of life as well, and trains to become one of them, so that he can fight along side of the Samurai against the Japanese forces that oppose them.
With the acception of ""Mystic River"", ""The Last Samurai"" was my favorite film of 2003. For 2 1/2 hours, I was literally glued to the screen, and loving every minute of it. It has been quite some time since I have been that captivated by a film. The only downfall this film may have, is the fact that the story is almost a complete rip off of ""Dances with Wolves"". However, that does not make the film any less enjoyable. In fact, ""The Last Samurai"" is almost better. The story comes across as being much more dramatic and action packed when dealing with the Samurai. They have a deeper sense of honor, and their fighting style is much more deadly. Director Edward Zick did an amazing job of capturing every aspect of the Samurai culture, from the costume designs and simple way of life, to the weaponry and fighting style. The final battle between the Samurai and the Japanese soldiers is the best I have seen since ""Braveheart"". The Samurai are completely outnumbered, and still manage to put up one heck of a fight. Tom Cruise gave one of the best, if not the best performance of his career. However, the best performance of the film goes to Ken Watanabe. He was flat out amazing as Katsumoto and nailed every aspect of the Samurai warrior. The film's soundtrack and scenery are extremely beautiful as well.
Overall, ""The Last Samurai"" is an amazing film. Every aspect of the Samurai way of life is captured accurately, the performances given by the actors involved were amazing, and the final battle was incredible. Also, please check out the extras listed by Amazon for this 2 Disc DVD set. From the look of things, the extras are reason enough to purchase this film. There are deleted scenes, featurettes on the making of the film, a featurette comparing real life Samurai, and more. This is definately a bonus for myself and anyone else who appreciates the film, and the Samurai in general.
A solid 5 stars...",1078358400,5,2608,4.647186147186147
2008796,5,B0001JXOVC,"I can't find the words to describe this truly amazing movie. I was not a huge fan of Tom Cruise, but since it looked like it would be pretty good from the preview, I decided I had to see it. This movie exceeded my expectations. Tom Cruise really surprised me and delivered such a wonderful performance in this movie. I feel that this movie was a gipped from being nominated for an Oscar. I thought for sure it would have been. If the Last Samuari had been nominated for an Oscar, and if, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King wasn't in the running this year (which truly deserved to win by the way), then I think that The Last Samuari should of been best picture of 2003. I feel that some people have overlooked this movie, and I am not sure why. It is such a beautiful movie, full of emotion, and wonderful performances. This movie is a true masterpiece.",1078185600,6,863,4.2682926829268295
2008797,5,B0001JXOVC,"It is rare that movies with historical perspectives can capture all three sides of a conflict so accurately.  As anyone who's studied Japanese history can tell you, the conflict herein was almost perfectly portrayed on all levels; within the government, within the characters, and within the nation (Japan) as a whole.

Set in the 1890's when Japan's emperor Meiji was trying desperately to ""modernize"" (read ""westernize"") Japan, we get to see an American's perspective on the wars that are ravaging the old nation of Japan.  While many Japanese people were trying so hard to be fashionable and up to date, there were a great many who felt that the country was being robbed of it's heritage and the ideals that were so strongly ingrained in the people as a whole were being tossed to the side all in the name of ""catching up with the rest of the world.""  It's tragic to watch as the young emperor is manipulated by his advisors into betraying the one man whom he should have listened to all along; his former teacher and mentor Katsumoto.

During all of this, however, Tom Cruise is thrown into the mix as Nathan Algren, a retired Civil War hero who won acclaim for himself for massacreing the plains indians in the Nazi-esque style of the time (""I was just following orders at the time, sir"").  Upon his arrival in Japan, his desperation for the sweet abyss of death is just out of reach time and again, but it is his capture by the ""enemy"" where he finds his redemption.
Some people who have reviewed this film refuse to see the Samurai as anything but bloodthirsty and savage (much like too many people saw the Native Americans), which couldn't be farther from the truth.  A peaceful people by nature, but stoic and steadfast in their beliefs of honor and discipline (two words that are unfortunately lost on most Americans these days), the Samurai sought only to keep their country pure from foreign influence (a noble cause, if a bit misplaced and/or closed-minded) out of fear that their own way of life would go the way of the Indian (which it did anyway), and herein lies the true power of this film.

From the beginning of the film, anyone with any knowledge of Japanese history (or even of modern Japan) knows that the Samurai are ultimately doomed to die.  I knew this going in, but found that this movie kindled a hope in me that they could ultimately win and save their country from itself as the samurai way saved Algren (Tom Cruise) from himself.  While Algren succeeds, he and his cause ultimately fail and the emperor realizes this only too late as too much has already been set in motion due to the machinations of his scheming advisors who are only in it to line their own pockets (which is totally historically accurate; the merchant class saw in ""westernization"" a way to finally grow in social stature and the Samurai were standing in their way, so they used their newfound wealth and influence to eradicate the Samurai).

Doomed from the beginning, this film is more about one man's triumph over his own demons than it is about a country falling apart.  Set against the backdrop of the Meiji ""restoration""-era civil wars, there's no way this film doesn't succeed (except, perhaps, for the romantic interest which was unecessary but not to the point that it detracted anything from the film).  We root for the hero to overcome his own personal obstacles while watching him fight a losing battle against a place and time that ultimately implodes upon itself.  And while he comes out on top, and stronger for it, he is now  alone in his new world because those who got him to it have been slaughtered around him.

All in all, the movie is tragic yet uplifting at the same time.  It IS historically accurate (no matter what anybody tells you, take it from someone who used to live in Japan and has studied Japanese history for 13 years), it is worth watching, and it was far more oscar-worthy than that abortion of a film about Japan ""Lost in Translation.""",1078185600,5,3975,4.6476462196861625
2008798,3,B0001JXOVC,"As soon as I could digest the fact that this movie advertised Tom Cruise as a Samurai I became excited by what appeared to be an epic saga about Japans tumultuous transition from millenia old traditionalism, into the modern era.  I figured, at the least, Samurai are interesting to watch; right?  Plus Edward Zwick (the Director) was the dude who also directed Glory...
Gobs of money were spent on the finest talent, set design, musical production, and effects....
....and it all shows.  This movie is beautiful to look at and interesting to watch.  Too bad it has about as much meaning as a plate of dog barf.
Those looking for the substance of Glory (or a South Park episode for that matter) are in for grave disapointment. But before you get all worked up and angry about that, consider the movies basic premise:
War weary mercenary enlists his services to the Japanese Imperial Army (not as some of the reviews contend ""to crush the Samurai"", but rather to modernize the military and keep it competitive with the rest of the world).  A rogue Samurai (Katsumoto) takes up arms against the evil Imperial Army (headed by the Emperor) to defend the ""way of the Samurai"" and the ancient (inarguably beautiful) way of life they preserve.
Ok, a little wobbly, but it gets way more conflicted.  Almost as if they started making the movie before they took the basic philosophical premise to its logical end...Following below are some of the conflicts that made this movie a ""hero agnostic"", conflicted, collage of plot-slop.
The Samurai, as cool as they were, were dead meat.  They used swords!  Sure, they used them well, very well (and some arrows too), but one word ""machine gun"" (ok, two).  Hello?!!  The whole purpose of a Samurai is to defend their masters (typically the ruling class).  With the advent of modern weaponry, their refusal to change with the times negated their worth to ""useless"".  Many of them stepped aside, this story is about one moron who didn't (Katsumoto), and instead caused the death of just about every innocent, selfless, loving person under his guardianship.
Ok, it'd be one thing if ""the enemy"" was real, but the enemy was led by the Emperor, his sworn master.  Sure, the Emperor was being influenced by greedy counsel, but in the movie, at every juncture of opportunity, Katsumoto acted like some hot-headed blood thirsty baby.  Even when the Emperor granted him special audience to to plead his case, he TOTALLY deferred to the Emperors judgment.
Well, the Emperor needed to modernize Japan.  The Samurai were finished.  But I guess that wouldn't sell tickets, so we had to watch Katsumoto lead all those that were sworn to him into a completely futile attempt to fight the machine gun toting opposition.  Kinda cool I guess.  That is, if you're not the kind to be bothered by the fact that this kind of mindless leadership (and more importantly mindless obedience) is the cause of most all of mankinds war and resultant gore, broken bodies, broken civilizations, and broken families.
Hey, I love war movies (Empire of the Sun stands as one of my favorites), and I don't need a ""pure hero"" to root for.  But this movie actually had me rooting for ""the dark side"", at least their position made some sense.",1078185600,2,3236,4.787769784172662
2008799,4,B0001JXOVC,"I thought the movie was good, and the japanese were very authentic. But it is impossible for tom cruise to become a samurai, unless the emperor made an ammendment to the laws passed down for centuries, which of course never happened. The movie is good with a plot, but as I said, the producers didn't think of how historically accurate this movie was. The overall movie had a plot and was very well made, and it seems like they put in a lot of time for every scene, just to make you feel immerssed in the culture. Good movie.",1078099200,2,525,4.313131313131313
2008800,5,B0001JXOVC,"For those who have always believed in being a Samurai, or trying to relive their days in the era that Samurai roamed, the movie in a way gave people that perspective. Of course, it's through the eyes of an American, because as we know it, Americans can't always see things clearly, only through hardships and experience of other people's culture can they truly come to know the differences and traditions of other nationalities. To me, I personally liked the movie for many reasons, the soundtrack was one of the many things, but it was the drama put into the story. It's like that old series, ""Shogun"", about a sailor from the west who was shipwrecked in Japan and brought up to become a Samurai. Stories that involve a learning process and finally understanding the ways of another is what I love to see in my movies, so I really do applaud the movie for what it does.",1078099200,8,870,4.547770700636943
2008801,5,B0001JXOVC,"First I would like to say that ""The Last Samurai"" sadley did not win any oscars tonight. I was very dissapointed. Every single person who was a part of this film brought ""The Last Samurai"" to life. Tom Cruise & Ken Watanabe are by far two of the best actors ever! Edward Zwick directed this film with absolute perfection!! One last person I am going to mention is Hanz Zimmer, the music writer. The whole score is magnificant and stunning. Hanz put his heart and soul into this score and he did not get credit for it. I am truley and absolutley stunned that this brilliant movie did not recieve any oscar awards nor was it nominated for best picture or best actor! The story is so uplifting and groundbreaking! Everyone should buy this DVD when it comes out May, 4th (yes I am counting the days.) Make sure to have the closest person beside you weither it is your martial arts master, your wife, or your best friend because this movie will make you want to hold someone until the very last frame is gone! ""The Last Samurai"" is the best movie EVER!",1078012800,8,1047,4.402061855670103
2008802,5,B0001JXOVC,"Okay, let me just start out by saying this:  THE LAST SAMURAI kicked GLADIATOR's butt.  The film shows a humanity and a passion that Ridley Scott's (undeserving) Best Picture winner did not.  And while that film succeeded mostly as an action film despite its dramatic intentions, THE LAST SAMURAI succeeds as a powerful story of honor, friendship and redemption.
I won't even bother explaining the plot to you, as I always leave that up to the Amazon.com reviewer.  While most people said the plot was too similar to that of DANCES WITH WOLVES (some even calling it a remake), I have to disagree.  Though the two films definitely share some similarities, they are two totally different experiences.  As to which one is better . . . . . . . well, I like them both around the same, probably, if for different reasons.
I should start with Tom Cruise.  This is probably the most against-type role I've ever seen him in.  Though he doesn't give the very best performance of his career, it's probably on the list.  Plus, I always find it fascinating when actors take very different turns in both characters and acting style.  The supporting cast was great, too; Ken Watanabe earned his Oscar nomination, bringing to his role a sense of pride and quiet grace.  You look in his eyes and see the sadness in them, in that he is truly the last of his kind, the last of a dying race of men of honor and heroism.  His world is almost gone, and he knows that his time is near an end, as well.  I hope he wins that Oscar.
I was quite impressed with another character in this movie: the music.  Hans Zimmer has done it again, creating a masterful score that I think is one of his best.  The beautiful landscape serves as a character, too, adding even more to the feel and tone of the movie (I actually think they filmed it in New Zealand).  The production & costume design is first-rate, as well, both earning further Academy Award nominations.
Director Edward Zwick shows the same spectacular epic filmmaking skills as he did with GLORY and LEGENDS OF THE FALL.  I can't wait for his next film, whatever it may be!  Oh, and this reminds me:  I've heard countless critics complain about the ending, calling it a groan-inducing, all-too-conventional Hlooywood ending.  I don't know what the heck they were talking about!  The ending was perfectly fine.  Don't listen to the critics on this one.
It's rare that we get an epic as awesome and well crafted as THE LAST SAMURAI.  Or I should say, it used to be rare.  Nowadays Hollywood keeps pouring out the historical & fantasy epics (the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, MASTER & COMMANDER, and this year's upcoming TROY, KING ARTHUR, and ALEXANDER).  I think it's safe to say that the epic motion picture is here to stay for quite a long while.  For one of the best examples of these, see THE LAST SAMURAI.  This is the film that should be in SEABISCUIT's place among the nominations for Best Picture.",1077926400,5,2927,4.557471264367816
2008803,3,B0001JXOVC,"I dunno, i kinda though the acting was weak and the script was nothing new.  They really made up a lot of history for this one.  I couldn't help but think Americans would be offended if they made a movie about the revolution and put some Japanese guy in it as the hero.  I guess the music was pretty good, and it had some gread scenery, but i wouldn't watch it twice.",1077840000,3,367,4.069444444444445
2008804,4,B0001JXOVC,"Don't get me wrong. I really enjoyed The Last Samurai, but it's complete bull. This is one of the most unlikely stories ever to be passed off as something realistic. I won't exactly go into detail to spare some from spoilers, but just flat out, this offers a very unrealistic attitude of the samurai from feudal Japan. Last of all, how the hell can Tom Cruise survive all that crap?",1077753600,3,382,4.4714285714285715
2008805,3,B0001JXOVC,"This film is a fantasy, pure and simple, beyond just the addition of a white American to the rebel samurai ranks.  This is not necessarily a problem if the movie-goer is seeking out something other than historical drama, but the viewer should keep him/herself more in mind of ""The Lord of the Rings"" than of ""Lawrence of Arabia"" when watching it.
Katsumoto's deference to the Emperor is the driving force for his character, but the real samurai had no tradition of loyalty to him.  In fact, the samurai only came full-force onto the pages of history by, in effect, overthrowing the Emperor in the 12th century and usurping his power.  It wasn't until the beginning of the Meiji Era (the time in which this film is set) that the Emperor regained any real control at all, and it was his choice to ""modernize"" Japan (Army and all) out of a justified fear of European colonization and/or exploitation.  Of course, by this time the samurai had lived under centuries of isolationist peace, and had long since ceased to be warriors.  They had become the powerful hereditary nobles and bureaucrats of Japan, more akin to Cicero than Caesar, and it was not the creation of the Army that bothered most of them, but the new laws forbidding them to wear swords- the symbols of their status- in an attempt at abolition of the (deeply inefficient and unprofitable) nobility system.
Nevertheless, the character of Katsumoto is indeed based on a real person, and the film on real events.  But the those who revolted were, first, a tiny minority of the samurai who continued to live by (or re-adopted) the old lifestyle; and, second, at war over the threat to their accumulated clout, rather than over some perception of Japan ""losing its way"".  Their actions were nothing more than a naked power-grab.
The storied traditions of the samurai largely came to an end (as much as they ever existed) when Tokugawa Ieyasu came to power at the beginning of the 17th century.
(As a side note, the scene with the ninja was the one part of the film I found truly outlandish.  Video games aside, ninja are not readily apparent in Japan.  There is little mention of them in history; they were not, and are not, especially respected or admired; and Japanese people on the whole cannot fathom the young American male's obsession with them.  There is no matching fervor on the other side of the Pacific.  What is common knowledge, however, is that at no time would dozens of them work together or get themselves caught up in an all-out attack, nor would a government trying to 'modernize' employ them.  Since they made their living on contracts against noblemen's belongings, most of decent society looked on them with more contempt than Europeans showed the most fearsome pirates).
The portrayal of Japan and, specifically, samurai ""society"" in this film is the Western romantic version- like Mallory's portrayal of medieval knights and the Chivalric Code in ""L'Morte D'Arthur"".  This does not make the film entirely without merit.  The cinematography is gorgeous, and I would happily watch the film again for that alone.  The acting is fairly strong.  I personally think Tom Cruise is an excellent actor, when he chooses a good role (like in ""Rain Man"", ""Eyes Wide Shut"", and others), and he performs adequately here.  However, it is far from his best work, and I think it was a correct decision for the Academy not to honor him with a nomination this year.
Perhaps part of the problem with the performance was a problem with the characters.  Most were rather typical of the genre known as ""epic"", and I could guess what they were going to say before the words were out of their mouths.  The story itself was easily predictable, but plot twists are not the reason most people will come to see this film.
Altogether, I can best describe the movie as ""fun"".  I find it enjoyable in the same way as I do anything from ""Terminator 2"" to ""Sleepless in Seattle"".  It's entertainment, not art.",1077667200,5,3956,4.754385964912281

He can't sleep quietly since he is punished by nightmares about how he was forced to be and participate in something he clearly saw as wrong but had no other choice. Simply put this character is another poor life destroyed by war.
He is hired by the Japanese to train the Imperial Army in the occidental ways at a time a week emperor allows his advisors to forget tradition an import the ways of ""more advanced civilizations"". In the process, the man gets captured by the samurai and during this captivity he begins not only to learn about their ways and philosophy, but also has peace for the first time in many years.
The Costume Design is incredibly accurate and the cinematography is absolutely superb. The music by Hans Zimmer is just beautiful, like another Gladiator epic. This movie is for people who love those little details. The production is really ambitious and works to deliver an astonishing view.
This DVD is really promising with features like the ""History vs. Hollywood: The Last Samurai History Channel Documentary""

When captured by the enemy, the American is asked to stick around for ""conversations"" with the leader of the samurai, who in turn, teaches the Yank a thing or two about life.
The film is brilliant in that way because it allows us to connect our own tainted dreams, hopes and ambitions to Cruise's journey through the higher mindedness of the Samurai.
talk about an amazing transformation and outlook on life. I always believed that much of that Zen stuff was just plain double-talk, but this film is amazing in both its depth of character interaction and preciseness of dialogue, through which great thought and resonance is placed upon every scene, every word and every action sequence. To that end, consider how almost every person who perished in this film affected me emotionally, during even its most violent scenarios. It's also to note that if actor Ken Watanabe, playing the all-powerful Katsumoto, doesn't receive an Oscar nomination for his part in this film, consider me to be the uncle of a monkey. And did I mention the film's intense and pointed musical score? Yup, Hans Zimmer is back with yet another perfect addition to the film's many strengths and a rousing score that was still buzzing in my head as I washed away the tears of the characters gone by. And before I forgot about one of the film's greatest attributes, consider its all-out sword-fighting, arrow-flinging all of which rival any other action scene from any film this year (which is saying quite a bit) and are pretty gosh-darn brutal to boot.

2008827,5,B0001JXOVC,"""The Last Samurai"" was a story about a man who changes the way that he feels about a certain type of people in Japan. It stars Tom Cruise, but to me he was not the star of the film. I feel that the movie had most of its power from the supporting actor Ken Watanabe. The way that he acted throughout the movie could give him the Oscar in the Best Supporting Actor Catagory. The entire movie could win many different awards, and I'm glad that Tom Cruise was not nominated, because I have seen him in much better roles, like ""Minority Report,"" or ""Vanilla Sky."" His great scene comes towards the end, where he gives emotion and power at once.
Cruise plays Captain Nathan Algren, a Civil War hero who loves to drink. He's recently come from battling American Indians in the west, and often had bad memories of what took place during those battles. But Algren gets a job when Japanese businessman Omura wants him to train the new army, with somebody that he knows Bagley. Bagley wants Algren because of the way that he battled the Indians. Algren agrees when he is able to bring his fellow Army fighter Sergeant Zebulon Gant. When they make it to Japan, they are met by the translator Simon Graham, and they begin to train the troops for battle. But Omura wants them to fight the samurai and their leader Katsumoto right away, and overrules Algren causing him to take his inexperienced troops to battle the Katsumoto. Algren is almost killed during the battle, but taken back to Katsumoto's village, which is ruled by his son. Algren is trapped, and there is no way for him to be able to return back to Japan. While with Katsumoto, he learns all about the way of the samurai and he finds out that there is nothing wrong with the people that Omura wants to kill. But it also becomes clear that Bagley is getting ready to fight. Algren befriends Katsumoto, and the two learn that they have much more in common then they oringally thought, and it becomes clear to Algren what he must do.
""The Last Samurai"" was a beautiful film. It had a beautiful sceney, beautiful action, some beautiful acting, and beautiful direction. I really did love it, and I am including it on the best of 2004, only beause I saw it at the very beginning of this year. This is one of those movies that you have to see in the theatre, otherwise it is not going to be an good. It is a big screen movie, and I have a feeling that I would have been disappointed if I saw it on video first. Try and see it now, before it totally disappears.
ENJOY!

2008828,4,B0001JXOVC,"The battle-hardened, cynical outsider who finds refuge, solace & identity in a strange & alien culture is a theme that has been explored many times by Hollywood. ""The Last Samurai"" offers nothing new in its interpretation of this theme, save setting it in 1870s Japan. Neither is Japanese culture & society of the time given meticulous enough treatment to call it accurate, nor is the protagonist (an alcoholic ex-Indian fighter named Nathan Algren) unique enough to hold your attention for too long.
Well, it may not be new, but it works. This has a lot to do with the breathtaking camera work - apart from the CGI enhanced scene of the port at which Algren arrives in Japan (fake! fake!), the visual impact of the movie is stunning. Eerily masked & armored horsemen charging through a forest shrouded in a ghostly fog, picturesque fields laid out like carpets blanketing the rolling mountainside, minimally furnished houses and buildings that manage to somehow give off an air of warmth, comfort and security... the camera speaks its own lines on every frame. The story of a renegade samurai leader's fight to uphold his & his men's honor in the distinctly samurai fashion meshes well with the visuals of the movie, and the battles are well choreographed, if a little far-fetched.
In all fairness, Edward Zwick has come with a pretty good, mainstream movie. It has enough adventure to supply goose-bump moments at periodic intervals, and while the sight of Tom Cruise mastering kendo in a few short months will have purists of the Japanese fighting arts fuming in outrage, it does give the general public something to cheer on without analyzing too much. The love interest is present, though blessedly low-key. The Japanese cast comes up with sterling performances, and provide a lot of authenticity to some of the interpretations of honor, duty & respect provided by the movie.
Overall, this is a movie that will catch your attention at first viewing. It lacks the staying power of true epic masterpieces like Lawrence of Arabia or the LOTR trilogy, but that shouldn't take anything away from its virtues. Just remember that its only a movie at the end of the day - NOT a documentary on the fall of the samurai in Japan.",1076630400,2,2223,4.852631578947369
2008829,5,B0001JXOVC,"This movie was the greatest movie I've ever seen, it will continue to be my favorite movie for a long time. The war sequences were far better than any other movie like 'Saving Private Ryan'. The Last Samurai had better special affects and a most intriguing story. I loved the relationship between Algren and the Samurai class, the fight for survival in the newly modernized country Japan after 1868 when Meiji's reign as Emperor began. Its quite fascinating how this story, even though the character Algren and the dealings with the Americans were fiction how this story was so well drawn out. The character that portrayed the legendary Saigo, or ""Dai Saigo"" otherwise known as a fictional character as Katsumoto did such a dramatically important role, a role in which it took a strong will and personality to play. The honor and prestige that each warrior felt back in history was shown in the faces of the individuals that gave their time and skills into making this film historically memorable. I love to read about Japanese history, and I can say right now that they did a spectacular job in recreating the nation of Japan back in the times of Meiji. domo arigatou.....ja ne!",1076544000,,1179,4.784313725490196
2008836,5,B0001JXOVC,"It's 1876. Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) has been sent to Japan in order to help the Imperial Japanese Army become more 'modern' and less 'traditional' and ultimately prepare them to fight the legendary Samurai. Events occur that cause Tom Cruise to be a captive of the deadly but extremely polite Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) who is the leader of the Japanese Samurai. At this point, the viewer begins to learn why the Samurai are fighting to preserve their way of life against Western influences and Cruise's character becomes emotionally bound to them and he integrates himself into their society after working hard to earn their trust. However, the film is not solely about the struggle for the Samurai to keep their way of life, another subplot includes the low key and shy love relationship between Algren and Taka, a quiet widow (played with subtlety by Koyuki). Though it isn't a big part in the film, it highlights the emotional aspect of the film and shows that this is not a film about swords.
Positive Points:
In my view, Cruise has been a decent actor with fluctuating performances but in this current effort, he has shown that he is improving and learning how to adapt to different styles of acting. He plays the tormented captain with surprising intelligence and conviction. I was very impressed to see him speaking Japanese - I loved the way this film mixed both English and Japanese toghether because it gave it a strong edge. However, The real star of this film is Ken Watanabe (Tom who?). He played Katsumoto with such a commanding and intense presence that it was hard to concentrate on Cruise or any other actor in the film. Without doubt deserves the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.
Special mention should go to Koyuki and Ujio (played by Hiroyuki Sanada). As supporting roles, they both acted convincingly without saying much but succeeded in showing that there are many more interesting characters besides Algren and Katsumoto.
Great music score by Hans Zimmer and fantastic costume design that will not doubt trigger a trend in Samurai-influenced clothes.
Negative points: While the film was entertaining, it focused too much on Cruise. The supporting characters were great too and people like Taka and Ujio should have had more developed personalities.
What is Billy Connolly doing in this film? A Scottish man impersonating an Irish man? You didn't fool me Braveheart!
But negativities cast aside, 'The Last Samurai' is an enjoyable, violent but immersing cinematic effort that shouldn't be missed if you are interested in Japan, a Cruise fan or if you just love historical dramas.",1076198400,251,2610,4.974828375286041

I am NOT a Cruise fan.
Basically he portrays himself in every film he does. Gee, maybe that is why he has never won an academy award.....has he ever been nominated? I don't think so.......
The only redeeming part of this film was the story, the wonderful scenery, and the supporting cast. I frankly would have loved to have seen more of them and allot less of him......unfortunately this particular film did not develop their character as much as ""Dances With Wolves"" developed the Sioux characters.

2008839,5,B0001JXOVC,"""The Last Samurai"" is a movie similar of plot to Akira Kurosawa's all-time classic - ""The Seven Samurai.""
Through this carefully crafted movie, people (especially non-Asians) can experience the lives of traditional Japanese people. ""The Last Samurai"" shows the way of life and precious traditional culture of the Japanese. Examples of interesting cultural scenes are the art of making green tea, which is complicated and formal, the practice of caligraphy, and the making of poetries.
More importantly, the movie portrays the code of values for the honorable Samurai. Through the flow of the movie, values such as honor, perseverance and dignity are depicted. Unfortunately, these values of which the Samurai had lived and died for are threatened by progress.
In ""The Last Samurai,"" the actors, both Asians and Westerners, did a wonderful job. However, I believe the best actor is Ken Watanabe (Katsumoto). He represented the undying determinacy of the Samurai well. He even is nominated for the best supporting actor of the Academy Awards! As for Tom Cruise (Captain Nathen Algren), who was accepted into the Samurai clan of Katsumoto (some audience believe as a Samurai because he wore the traditional armor of Samurai when he went to battle against his own kin), was a pretty good actor too, he speaks Japanese well.
However, I discovered a racist scene in the movie. At the end of the film, as can be predicted by the title, the last generation of the Samurai entered immortality. And ironicaly, the ""last Samurai"" is Tom Cruise, an American.
In this movie, the existance of the struggling traditional Japanese society is threatened by the future of advancement and technology in downtown Japan. This movie portrays the dilemma really clearly and makes people think about the conflicts of the old versus the new. Is the old ways always bad? Is the new always good? Should old be destroyed in order to accomodate the new?",1076025600,,1924,5.053459119496855

The action is wonderful and there is no unnecessary romantic scenes like it seems many movies do these days. It is such a wonderful movie for the whole family and it's dissappointing to see that it wasn't nominated for an Oscar.

2008841,4,B0001JXOVC,"On seeing Edward Zwick's ""The Last Sumurai"", I had to deal with mixed feelings, good news and bad news. The good news: this is a big, beautiful movie relating an unusual story. In 1876 California an ex-Union officer Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), who has battle scars both physical and psychic, is hired by Japanese diplomats to train an American-style army for the Emperor, conscripted against a renegade samurai Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). Katsumoto hates the Western ways increasingly threatening Japan. (Katsumoto's tragic story is not really that distant: it was only three decades ago that Yukio Mishima, frustrated in his attempt to protect Japan from the sterile corruption of Westernization, committed seppuku.) Algren's campaign to train the Emperor's forces is not too successful (when he orders them to hold fire, they don't), and his first encounter with the rebel forces finds him a wounded prisoner. Algren is taken to Katsumoto's mountain outpost and kept alive so that ""we may learn our enemy"". One aspect of Japanese culture Algren is immediately obssessed with is sake; but as his stay lengthens he becomes more attentive, learning the language, mastering kendo, and enjoying a Kyogen performance. In return, he attempts to teach baseball to the village boys; but they seem to miss the concept, trying to catch the base runner instead of the ball. (They've come a long way.) Cruise is an attractive actor, and this may be his best performance to date. Algren is introduced as a bitter, indeed a broken man; but as his outlook becomes more philosophical there is a sincere depiction of a character desiring to understand the strange world around him. Cruise's scenes with Watanabe, another charismatic actor, are the film's most defining. Eventually, Algren takes sides with the samurai rebel, and when their Japanese forces face the Emperor's Japanese forces on the battlefield, it must seem like dj vu to the Civil War veteran, but this point is not belabored. The climatic battle is strikingly photographed by John Toll, as is the whole production. The world of mid-19th Century Japan is richly reproduced, and there's even a fascinating glimpse of 1876 San Francisco. The bad news: there is a major problem with ""The Last Samurai"" and it's the ending. Why in the name of Chikamatsu did Zwick and his co-scenarists Marshall Herskovitz and John Logan, after creating such a sensitive and arresting story, mar it with such a weak conclusion? All we need is a Henry Mancini coda. But, the ending notwithstanding, ""The Last Samurai"", spectacular and intelligent, was one of the best movies of 2003.",1075852800,,2618,5.104895104895105
2008842,4,B0001JXOVC,"This film has been compared (a lot) to Dances with Wolves due to the fact that they both share similar themes. A Civil War era soldier who finds himself thrown in the middle of a different culture and ends up embracing it and becoming part of it.
However, Edward Zwick's film differs from the Kevin Costner Oscar winner in that the principal character, Lt. Nathan Algren (Cruise) is down on his luck, having become a drunken caricature of his former self, deeply regretful of his actions, who accepts a job as an instructor for an incipient Japanese army that needs to be prepared to fight against the Samurai.
As he arrives to Tokyo he starts training a useless bunch of would-be soldiers who are sent to fight even if they're not ready for it. As a result, the newly formed army gets butchered by the battle experienced Samurai. During that battle, Algren fights bravely and kills one of the highest ranking warriors, getting the interest of the famed Katsumoto, the last great Samurai leader, who orders him captured and brought to his son's village as a prisoner.
Once there, Algren's life is changed forever as he gets to know the real lifestyle of the Samurai and their people. They turn out not to be the savages that the Japanese government makes them out to be. After spending winter with them, Algren ""changes sides"" and joins the Samurai in fighting the Emperor's army.
The title of the movie tells the final outcome. The Samurai lose the battle. Progress triumphs over tradition. New over old. But Algren's past demons are redeemed by his courageous actions helping the Samurai.
The true worth of this movie is its look. You can definetely see where the budget went (other than Cruise's salary). A whole village was built and the attention to detail is astonishing. The costumes are simply amazing, especially the battle armors. The costume designer is Ngila Dickson, who also worked in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings trilogy.
Also of notice are the battle scenes, which are breathtaking. Very violent, but not gratuitous, they serve the story very well.
As for the acting, Cruise does a fine job, and is slowly but consistently becoming a better actor (even if this particular performance was not nominated for an Academy Award), but the movie belongs to Ken Watanabe (who was indeed nominated) as Katsumoto. His presence demands attention. He is the center of every scene he's in. Koyuki's performance as Taka, Katsumoto's sister and Algren's love interest, should also be noticed.",1075766400,108,2502,4.861826697892272
2008843,5,B0001JXOVC,"The part that struck a core and made my soul cry was the brutal slaying, not only of the samurai themselves, but of the old ways of life.

All that comes with belief or tradition is seen as suspect and ridiculed by people with the vision that their way is the only one. All others are to be legislated against or outright destroyed.

Incidentally,in the farming area and the town of New Plymouth in New Zealand where the movie was made,Tom is now a patron saint. He was so generous and forthcoming with his time and himself,the locals absolutey love him.
But I did go and see it and I loved it,every single minute of it. I even liked Mr. Cruise altho I did think he was out acted by just about everyone else in the movie.
But yes I loved it. I'll certainly go and see it again.
That scene where the rebels were attacking out of the mist thru the trees was pure Kurosawa. The Master would have been proud.

They tell you the basic story...an alcoholic Civil War guy...enemy...samurai!  While that is the story...there's a lot more to it than that!  What captivated me and all my friends (17 - 21 years old) was the Samurai...and, all the emotions of the story...an American kills the Red Samurai...who is the Samurai Captains Brother-in-law...he lives in the house and is cared for by the Red Samurai's widow...  Tom Cruise sees the beauty of the Samurai people and understands the honor and respect and culture and discipline of these people and realizes they are not the enemy!  He learns a lot from these people and earns their respect in many ways!  The widow...who knows Cruise killed her husband...offers the Red armor for Cruise to fight with Samurai against the Army Cruise was sent to train!  Beautiful movie in every way!  It is no way slow at any point!  When someone says this movie is ""slow"", it simply means they do not feel the emotion of silence and music and the visuals they see!  The battles are a very small part in the greatness of this movie!  But, the end of the last battle will have you reaching for a hanky!  The Samurai are a beautiful people!  Also recommended are Samurai books and old classic Japanese Samurai movies!  ...unless you think it'll be...slow!",1075593600,,1493,4.714285714285714
2008863,5,B0001JXOVC,"The Last Samurai was certainly a surprisingly refreshing escape from the many senseless movies that've recently been released into theatres. The movie was beautifully shot, paying close attention to detail, plus even the acting wasn't as dreadful as I'd expected it to be. To add to everything, the writers even had the sense to put in little sequences of comic relief, whether you found it remotely funny or not...
I thought the casting was fantastically done. It was interesting to see Tom Cruise playing such a role. Though not the best actor in the movie, he certainly did good enough of a job in developing his character throughout the course of the film. Ken Watanabe was excellent as Katsumoto. Also, I found it rather....different...when I found out that the lead actress, Koyuki, was 28 years old! Given the fact that so many ""young"" actresses are casted in movies these days (unless they are the starring role), I just found that fact interesting...
Another good thing about this movie is that the Japanese characters actually speak Japanese to one another (there are subtitles, of course). There are numerous American films out there where peoples of different ethnicities end up speaking English to one another in the films, as opposed to their ethnic languages. This film, however, failed to follow that trend, which in my eyes made the entire atmosphere of the film much more authentic. Instead of the Japanese peoples speaking English to one another, the foreigner is forced to learn and adapt to the language of the Japanese instead.
Of course, this movie wasn't always perfectly unscathed. Given that it's an American film, you just had to expect its few ""Hollywood"" moments. It's odd how Tom Cruise is able to defend himself from a gruop of samurais in the opening battle, and later degrades himself to a nobody when he fights against Katsumoto for the first time. Then there are the moments when everyone dies in a scene expect, you guessed it, good ol' Tom Cruise. Oh well, what's a Hollywood movie without these moments?
Overall, I'd highly recomment this movie. Unless you absolutely cannot stand the mere sight or thought of Tom Cruise, I'm quite confident that most audiences will enjoy this movie",1075420800,8,2221,4.9411764705882355
2008864,4,B0001JXOVC,"I am not a big fan of Tom Cruise, but, thought that this movie was great.
The story of sacrifice seemed a lot more compelling to me in this movie than in Braveheart (who doesn't like Braveheart). Braveheart was a numbers war and it seemed like maybe the Scots/Irish had a chance, whereas, the traditional Japanese Samurai never had a chance against firearms...It was just extremely moving to see these legendary/respected warriors simply mowed down...in a way that was completely honorless. They were fighting for the good of the country/unity/tradition not just the vague concept of ""freedom"" (Braveheart). I also really enjoyed being familiarized with the history and tradition of the Samurai (from other reviewers, I understand that the accounts are fairly accurate).

I appreciated the authenticity of the characters and how the movie stayed true to the Japanese culture. The negative reviews that I've read are obviously from people who can't appreciate differences in culture. Examples of this authenticity include: 1) No nudity in this movie...traditional Japanese culture was/is extremely reserved (especially women) and throwing in gratuitous nudity would have totally destroyed the feel of the movie. 2) Honor- the movie did a great job of utilizing Cruise to familiarize the movie goer with traditions that we might not have understood by introducing the values of this society through the eyes/values of someone the movie-goer could relate to (Cruise). 3) There have been several critics of the movie who found it preposterous that Cruise would stay with the widow of the man that he killed...I wasn't sure about this either...It seemed like if he posed any sort of threat, Watanabe's character shouldn't have put an enemy soldier in with his sister and some kids...If he didn't understand Cruise's culture, why would he have taken the chance...The treatment of Cruise, however, did fit the treatment that a guest would receive in the Japanese culture at that time regardless of what the host felt about the guest...
The visuals in this movie were excellant. Other movie review sites that break down and grade the different aspects of this movie have reviewers who have given this movie F's across the board...I think these people are idiots. Even if you thought that this movie was horrible, there's no way that the cinematography deserved an ""F."" The visuals were probably the highlight of this film (esp. the sunset scene, flower gardens, and village scenes).
Complaints: Tom Cruise's last line doesn't do the movie justice (it made me cringe)...The movie seemed to delve into something unique up until the Hollywood line that was thrown in at the end of the movie...(""I won't tell you how he died, I will tell you how he lived""). The movie had me hooked up until I heard this spouted from Cruise's mouth...I think that this was one of the few things that I disliked about the movie...The weakling emperor also really irritated me...I recognize that this teenager was probably an accurate depiction of the leaders of the empire, however, it was still irritating to see someone so weak/cowardly elevated above characters that were so much more respectable.

Granted, there are several historial inaccurate items, but that does not stop this from being a great and enjoyable movie.

2008867,5,B0001JXOVC,"Comparisons to ""Dances with wolves"" apart, ""The last samurai"" is a very enjoyable movie. Tom Cruise, maybe in his best performance ever, plays Nathan Algren, a veteran of the Civil War that now lives in oblivion as an alcoholic ad-boy for a weapons company. He's invited to Japan to train the Imperial Army against a bunch of rogue samurai. The Imperial Army represents the new Japan (in 1876), a nation that has turned its eyes to the western world. The samurai represent the old japanese style, fighting without fire weapons, living a life of discipline, simplicity, commitment and respect for the nature, etc.
This clash of so different cultures is what makes this movie interesting. Besides, there are many dialogues spoken in japanese (what helps create the correct atmosphere), the costumes and figurines are excellent, and the battle scenes, that some people found to be not well-represented and slow, caught my attention every time.
Not only Tom Cruise is good, though a little too intense; the girl Koyuki and, especially, this amazing actor Ken Watanabe play their parts with a tremendous ease and desenvolture, giving us, westerners, a glimpse of what japanese culture is (or was).
OK, the script is Hollywood from beginning to end, but, nonetheless, Edward Zwick did a competent job, just like he did in another exceptional movie, ""Glory"". I did not enoy ""The las samurai"" because of its story, but because its very well enacted, colorful and it portraits one of the most interesting cultures in the world. Maybe something that helped me like this movie is the fact that I've never watched (and I'm ashamed to say so) an Akira Kurosawa movie.

2008868,2,B0001JXOVC,"Conclusion: Edward Zwick has displayed himself in the past as a true patriot. Just look at the protagonists in his films, striving for independence, justice and honor: Denzel Washington's characters in 'Courage Under Fire' and 'The Siege', or Matt Broderick in 'Glory'. Tom Cruise, as it turns out, represents the director's patriotism like no other - just watch the sulken way he looks past the camera while riding a horse, battling, or simply conversing with the samurai, who took him hostage to see learn the Americans' techniques. This is a star performance, and never for a second is Tom anyone but Tom - he simply looks more and more ridiculous in different costumes, but with the same facial expression of deep pondering.
 The film is like its star's performance: while glossy and seemingly intelligent, it's in fact shallow and predictable. The film follows a simple structure: Cruise as American - Cruise captured by samurai - Cruise trains - Cruise falls in love with the village and its people (including the wife of a man he killed) - Cruise as samurai. Ken Watanabe is a very Americanized samurai; Cruise's love interest actually fits him in terms of the acting range she displays (tragism has never been so unflichingly boring). And at the end, there is this unimpressive, 'bad version of LOTR' battle, where the two protagonists remain alive just to pronounce the moral of the film.
 Zwick's film isn't apparently flawed, but doesn't break any new ground. It displays little affection/understanding of its main subject. Watch Kurosawa's classics instead - even Jim Jarmusch' 'Ghost Dog' has a more authentic samurai feel than this degrading feature.",1074556800,2,1664,5.069343065693431
2008869,4,B0001JXOVC,"In DANCES WITH WOLVES (1990), Kevin Costner is the emotionally drained Civil War soldier whose life is renewed on the Great Plains by a wild wolf and a band of Sioux when he adopts the lifestyle and values of the latter. He ""goes Indian"".
As this film opens in 1876, ex-Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), formerly of the 7th Cavalry, is an alcoholic Civil War and Plains Indian War veteran reduced to making public appearances on behalf of the Winchester Arms Company, maker of the famous repeating rifle. He's rescued by his old commanding officer, Col. Benjamin Bagley (Tony Goldwyn), who arranges for Algren to help train the Japanese Imperial Army in modern warfare techniques. The pay is $500 per month. Because of an incident in the campaign against the Indians that still causes Algren nightmares, cost him his self-perceived honor, and drove him to drink, Nathan tells his ex-CO that he'll kill anyone in Japan for $500 a month, but would gladly kill Bagley for free. Army camaraderie is not all it's cracked up to be. In any case, off both sail to Japan.
The Imperial government is bedeviled by rebel samurai warriors cranky about the increasing Westernization of society. In the first skirmish between Algren-trained troops and a samurai band led by Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), Nathan is wounded and captured. He spends the winter in Katsumoto's village, where he's nursed back to health by Katsumoto's sister, Taka (Koyuki), whose husband Algren had killed in the recent battle. While a prisoner, Nathan discovers love with you-know-who and personal friendship with Katsumoto, whose life he saves at one point, and re-discovers Honor through proximity with and training in the Samurai Code. In the final confrontation between the samurai and Imperial troops led by Bagley, guess where Algren plants his standard? It's DANCES WITH WOLVES all over again, but without the wolf. The samurai even employ bows and arrows.
THE LAST SAMURAI is a well-acted, engaging story that's shot in some beautiful scenery. Since New Zealand seems to be the location of moviemakers' choice lately (LOTR trilogy, PETER PAN), I wasn't surprised to see in the ending credits that some of this film, presumably that part in the samurai village, was located there. And speaking of scenery, there's Koyuki, a Japanese actress  unknown on U.S. screens, who's exquisite.
Unfortunately, the film is perhaps thirty minutes too long, and the climactic battle sequence is milked for all it's worth - and then some - including some unnecessary slo-mo footage. The term ""maudlin"" comes to mind. And it's this aspect of THE LAST SAMURAI which makes it, to me, inferior to that other action epic of 2003, the more tightly edited MASTER AND COMMANDER.
THE LAST SAMURAI may win some Oscars, such as for cinematography or costuming. But, I perceive it as only one of the better films of 2003 as opposed to one of the best.",1074470400,111,2893,4.9772727272727275

The film concerns an American soldier named Nathan Algren, who fought in the Civil War and later became disillusioned during the Battle of Little Bighorn. In 1876, Japan is in the middle of the Meiji Restoration. The old ways are being cast aside for the new, and the samurai has become a relic of the past. A band of samurai, led by the fictitious Katsumoto, probably based on the real-life Saigo Takamori, believes that the old Japan can be saved. They've been attacking railroads and other constructs of Westernization. Frustrated, Japan has asked the United States for officers to train Japanese troops in modern warfare so they can fight the samurai. Algren, played by Tom Cruise, is asked to go.
Following a brief training period, the Japanese troops are ordered to fight the samurai. This is one of the best scenes in the film. When the troops are lined up in the forest, with mist all around, and there are weird noises off in the distance, the samurai come riding slowly out of the fog, swords raised, clad in intricate armor and horned helmets, looking like ancient death incarnate... It's an enormous thrill. The troops lose the battle and Algren is captured. He comes to learn the ways of the samurai and to develop a friendship with their leader, Katsumoto. The film is more or less about Algren embracing the ancient ways of the samurai.
The film has a decent amount of swordplay. It isn't as graphic as some samurai films I've seen, but blood is shed, heads are chopped off, etc. A few times the film was slowed down so you could see how graceful and skilled samurai swordfighting really is. I have to say that I came away with a slightly greater appreciation for the samurai than I had previously.
But hell if they didn't completely ruin the whole enterprise with over-sentimentalized, conventional Hollywood filmmaking. Tom Cruise is a good actor, but I felt that he was wrong for the role. He just isn't complex enough to be believable for what the film demanded of him. I feel like this film would've been the perfect vehicle for a little-known actor to make a name for himself. And as for the fictitious character of Nathan Algren, well, this is quite obviously an American movie for American audiences, if you know what I mean. For example, we're expected to believe that a U.S. soldier with some scabbard training can become a master samurai swordsman in a matter of months. Yeah...
As for the plot, it's more or less ""Dances With Wolves in Japan."" And there's this tacked on love story - or ""flirt story"" - that had really no reason being in the movie. I personally despise tacked on love stories.
And talk about melodrama! A little melodrama here and there is forgivable, and even expected in most big budget films of this kind, but it was laid on way too thick in this movie - especially at the end. What could've been an emotional finale ended up being 10 to 15 minutes of overbearing tear-jerking. Gag!
Call me sadistic, but I have to say the most satisfying part of the film is when a samurai beats the living crap out of Tom Cruise with a wooden sword. Definitely worth the price of admission.",1074297600,3,3520,4.606687898089172

2008894,4,B0001JXOVC,"""The Last Samurai"" is everything a movie should be - exciting, emotional, and involving. Though I would not go so far to say that it's a masterpiece, it is one of the better movies I have seen in 2003, and without having seen the new ""Lord of the Rings"", it's definitely near the top of the list. It will no doubt draw comparison with ""Braveheart"" because of the epic battles and the emotional climax, but thankfully avoids becoming derivative of other ""battle epics"".
Tom Cruise (who spent two years learning Japanese) plays Nathan Algren, a civil war hero who has fallen off the right path and is now washed up and heavily into the booze. His fortunes change when he is commissioned by the Emperor of Japan to help train his army to fight efficiently against the Samurai who roam the country. His success with that endeavor is short lived when he is captured by the Samurai during a devastating battle. He spends the next several months living among them and adopting their ways, and growing fond of the discipline, skill, and tact that the Samurai display. Knowing of the Emperor's motives to rid Japan of the people and way of life he has come to embrace, he joins them in their battle against insurmountable odds.
There are many subplots and characters, some predictable Hollywood fodder (do you smell a love story cooking?), but most are effective and necessary to the overall story. ""The Last Samurai"" is tempered with humorous moments that help to balance the violence that is peppered throughout. As you can expect, many of the battles are long, drawn out, and very bloody. But the violence is never gratuitous, and it knows it's limits. As far as performances go, Tom Cruise is nothing if not reliable, and his largely Japanese supporting cast all do a great job in hitting their cues and making us believe in them. What really deserves special mention is the cinematography, which captures Japans lush valleys, majestic temples, and overall aesthetic beauty. The battle choreography is also stellar, obviously benefiting for painstaking direction and CGI effects.
""The Last Samurai"" is not a history lesson, so you are unlikely to walk away from it having gained a substantial knowledge of the Samurai customs and traditions. What you will get out of it is a fantastic movie-going experience that satisfies on every level, which is exactly what we go to movies for.",1073865600,4,2376,4.84029484029484

2008896,3,B0001JXOVC,"Set in 1870's Japan, ""The Last Samurai"" is most effective when it sticks to the harsh realities of its blood- soaked battle scenes and avoids the softening effects of its two-bit philosophizing.
Tom Cruise is stoic and stolid as Nathan Algren, a former captain of the United States army who is having trouble coming to grips with the part he played in slaughtering a village of innocent American Indians.  Now drifting aimlessly through life, Algren disinterestedly agrees to go to Japan to help train its military in the ways of modern warfare so that the nation's leaders can take on and destroy the sole remnants of the samurai forces who are still using swords as weapons.  Once he is captured by the ""enemy,"" however, Algren falls under the spell of the Samurai Code of Honor and switches his allegiance in battle, ending up fighting with the samurai (whom he views as the equivalent of ""Indian underdogs"" in the struggle) against the people he was brought over to train.  The film, thus, becomes a study in redemption as this one man attempts to find his place in the scheme of things and to erase the life-crippling guilt of his past actions.
Director Edward Zwick, who made one of the best war films of modern times (""Glory""), has had less success here, mainly because he stacks the deck so shamelessly in favor of the samurai that we can't help feeing manipulated all throughout the film.  In many ways, ""The Last Samurai"" is as guilty of one-sidedness as those old time Westerns that used to portray the Indians as faceless savages and the White Man as noble adventurers and heroes.  Each perspective seems equally unhistorical and phony.  It's hard for us to see much meaning in Algren's redemption when the people he is following spend much of their time garroting themselves and chopping off one another's heads.  And all the talk about ""honor,"" ""shame,"" the beauty of cherry blossoms and getting in touch with the inner self through a zen-type lifestyle don't amount to too much when we stand back and realize that the samurai were basically bloody warriors who often terrorized the general populous with their acts of brutality and violence.  The makers of the film want us to see a vast moral chasm separating the samurai from both the Japanese military and the evil American colonials who support them, but it is, ultimately, a distinction without a difference.  So when we are asked to cheer on Algren and his compatriots in battle or weep over their fate, the movie loses its grip on us in a major way.  The film becomes just another case of glorifying and romanticizing a way of life that we somehow suspect was a bit less noble and honorable than we have always been led to believe by the countless movies on the subject.
Technically, ""The Last Samurai"" is a mighty impressive achievement.  In addition to the eye-catching vistas of rural Japan and a beautifully recreated 19th Century city, the film's large-scaled battle sequences have been stunningly mounted and executed - though the faint-of-heart should note that the body count on screen is enormous and the blood flows generously throughout.  There are, also, some admittedly touching moments scattered throughout the film, though the Hollywood corn is never too far from the surface (particularly in Algren's romantic attachment to the wife of a man he killed).
""The Last Samurai"" is a joy to look at, but its unsubtle approach to its material and lack of evenhandedness make it far less meaningful and moving than, I'm sure, it both wanted and intended to be.",1073692800,20,3540,4.833057851239669
2008897,5,B0001JXOVC,"In 1876 Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is a Civil War hero who became disillusioned with politics and ideals during the Indian Campaigns, and then he became a drunk. An envoy from Japan offers him a job training the Emperor's first modern army, which will be used to suppress an army of Samurai who are rebelling against the Imperial government's modernizing agenda. Mired in self-hatred and disgusted by the irony that killing is what he does best, Algren declares that he'll kill anyone for $500 a month and sails for Japan. Against his better judgment, Algren leads an ill-prepared regiment of novice soldiers against the Samurai, and he is captured. The leader of the Samurai, Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), treats Algren well, ostensibly so that he may learn about his enemy. And Algren grows to respect this imposing man and the ancient traditions of the Samurai that Katsumoto is fighting to preserve in the face of a rapidly emerging modern Japan.
""The Last Samurai"" is a terrific example of what Hollywood does best. It is a epic of legendary proportions. It sets the personal stories of a few heroic individuals against a sweeping and beautifully photographed historical background. It is a great story, but not a realistic one. It's a grandly entertaining myth. The Samurai culture is idealized. The characters speak not as real people would, but in moving and thoughtful monologues. Even when they are speaking to each other, they are actually speaking to the audience. But Hollywood does these larger-than-life tales like no one else, and ""The Last Samurai"" is epic filmmaking at its best.
Tom Cruise is an obvious choice for such a large-scale project that requires that its cast have great screen presence so as not to be lost among the fantastic costumes and sets. Cruise's screen presence is up to the task, but I'm not sure his thespian skills are. Cruise's mannerisms are too modern for a man who grew up in the mid-19th century. But that is a minor flaw since ""The Last Samurai"" does not pretend to historical accuracy in its ideas, only in its environment. Tom Cruise is adequate here, but Ken Watanabe steals the show as Katsumoto, spiritual and military leader of the Samurai. His presence on screen is more than up to the film's epic proportions. I have rarely seen such charisma on a movie screen. He successfully embodies the concept of the warrior-poet in one character. I look forward to seeing more of Ken Watanabe in Western films, as well as Japanese. There are notable supporting performances from Koyuki as Taka, a woman who takes Algren into her home when he is injured and captured, and from Timothy Spall as a British translator.
Much has been made of ""The Last Samurai""'s playing fast and loose with history. This is a film that aspires to bring an engrossing and monumental story to its audience before it aspires to accuracy in detail. My knowledge of Japanese history is sketchy at best. But it appears that the larger events of ""The Last Samurai"" are based in fact, while the details have been invented to serve the story. The rebellion of the Samurai and its great battle with the Imperial Army in the film closely resemble the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877, in which the Satsuma Samurai, led by Saigo Takamori, engaged the Imperial Army. It turns out the way it did in real life, too. The film's Katsumoto is based on the very real Japanese hero Saigo Takamori, who helped usher the Shogunate out of power and restore the Imperial family to power before eventually leading an armed Rebellion against the Emperor on account of the policies of the Meiji Restoration, which instituted sweeping reforms intended to modernize Japan. The Meiji Restoration did make it illegal for the Samurai to wear topknots and swords, as we see depicted in the film. The government's Ministers did have more power than the Emperor Meiji, who served primarily as a symbol of national unity. So I would say that  the political climate and the major events depicted in ""The Last Samurai"" are real, while the story itself is not. Writer John Logan has used this environment to tell a story about the personal journey of an American and the clash between modern realities and traditional cultures.
""The Last Samurai"" has often been compared to Kevin Costner's 1990 epic ""Dances With Wolves"". The two films are similar in that they are both about a disillusioned Civil War veteran who finds redemption and a sense of identity in a traditional culture that is on its way to extinction -or at least assimilation. But the Samurai were not harmless or innocent as the American Indians of ""Dances With Wolves"" may have been. The Samurai were politically influential and militarily powerful. And they were not marginalized after their defeat. Quite the contrary. ""The Last Samurai"" also departs from ""Dances With Wolves"" pacifist themes in asserting that the suppression of traditional cultures, by force if necessary, was necessary for Japan's survival in the modern world.
I highly recommend ""The Last Samurai"" as an excellent example of signature epic filmmaking. It's a well-paced story that holds the audience's interest even at nearly 2 1/2 hours in length. Ken Watanable's performance is thoroughly enjoyable. The battle sequence is breath-taking and utterly spectacluar. It will even appeal to the martial arts crowd; there are lots of sword fights. It's a melange of history and fiction, but I see no reason to sweat the details since ""The Last Samurai"" isn't claiming to be anything more than that.",1073433600,16,5506,4.920430107526882
2008898,1,B0001JXOVC,"Samurai as good, honourable soldier who hold onto traditional value is like sharks in Finding Nemo who are vegetarian.  It is totally FAKE. Samurai are in essense ultra-loyal soldiers for Japanese Emperior.  Chinese and rest of Asia knows very well that these are people who kills civillians, children, women and anyone else if the Emperior ask them too.  Modernise or not is just the weapon they take up, not the mentality they have.
I am so sorry and angry that Hollywood have continued to romantize the 'Japanese value'.  Don't you people knows Japanese soldiers were like NAZI in Asia in World War? Even worse, they never apologize for their wrong during the war. They portrait themselves as survivors of the atomic bombs, victims of the wars when they are the PREDATORS who invade other countries in the first place Why can they get away with this? That's because the West are so impressed by the Samuria code of HONOUR to realize it is exactly this code of unquestionable loyalty that cause so much suffering over Asia.

2008899,5,B0001JXOVC,"When the previews first came out, I was utterly disgusted by the idea of the last samurai. Let me say, the previews do no justice. Nor does the heart-throb image of Tom Cruise.
Yes, Cruise's name sold the movie. However, his acting also carried it. Of all the films I have watched this year (and I have seen most of the Oscar contenders), this was the first time I actually thought to myself ""Wow. This guy is good."" Tom Cruise is amazing in this film, as are the rest of the cast, most outstandingly Watanabe (Katsumoto) and Koyuki (Taka).
To summarize: Cruise plays a post-civil war soldier who is hired by the Japenese Emperor as a battle advisor against the rebellions of the last remaining samurai. However, the American is taken hostage by the Samurai during a battle and soon befriends the Samurai village. The Last Samurai is a story of love, spirit, and, most of all, a sacred honor which guides us all.
The battle scenes, while gruesome (if you're squeamish, you might avoid this one), were amazing. The cinematography is wonderful. However, the actors, the themes, and the BREATHTAKING score carry the film to a superb quality deserving of the highest recognition.

2008900,4,B0001JXOVC,"Former Paramount studios chief Robert Evans used to call his holiday pictures ""Christmas gifts to the world,"" and ""The Last Samurai"" is staged just so: Much of it is handsome, magnificent and morally decent, yet the movie is full of itself, in both solemnity and faraway gaze. Edward Zwick's latest giant is in need of a bit of exuberance to push it over into classic status, and the director never quite gets enough of it, and certainly not from star Tom Cruise, in permanent furrowed brow.
Developed from an interesting story by John Logan, ""The Last Samurai"" concerns Capt. Nathan Algren (Cruise), a drunk, disillusioned cavalry solider in 1870s hired to train a ""modernized"" Japanese army defeat the legendary mountain samurais, whose ""bushido"" code of discipline has long defended the nation. The samurai are led by their last great fighter, Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), fight by sword and bow, and have the fealty of the people. The upwardly mobile Japanese ambassador Omura (Masato Harada) has the ear of the young emperor (Shichinosuke Nakamura).
Bushido code is such that Katsumoto would drop his sword if the emperor wished it so; until then, he leads charges against green Japanese troops. In one battle, pitched in the forest by fog light, he wounds Algren, captures him and ushers the captain to a mountain hideout to study his recovering enemy. The samurai village is beautifully realized; Zwick and cinematographer John Toll (""Braveheart"") purposely create a utopia at high elevation. With a valley in the distance reminiscent of a fertile green ocean, Algren begins to adjust to the mood and practice of the warriors and prove himself worthy of it while kindling a romance with a samurai's widow (beautiful, expressive Koyuki).
While Katsumoto may belong to an ancient order, he speaks English, displays a quick sense of humor and seeks to trade wisdom with Algren rather than merely dispensing it. His philosophy is unbending, but his moods aren't. Watanabe is so good because he plays against the expectation of the stern, authoritarian titan, and, with a smile, steals most of the scenes away from Cruise, who affects the broken man about as well as a naturally expressive actor can.
Inevitably, Algren wins a few mock battles and stands beside Katsumoto during a midnight ninja attack, setting the stage for Algren's conflicted return back to his old post in Tokyo, then his subsequent change of heart that leads to fierce final battle between tradition and guns, played out in the valley we've seen from afar the entire movie.
Four-act films are rare, but Zwick doesn't fight the built-in structure, uses it, in fact to cover all the political bases, punctuating the end of each with a clash of some sort. The ninja raid has a hint of Kurosawa, while the forest sequences echoes the Vietnam movies of Stone and Coppola. The final battle is a close cousin to ""Braveheart"" and deserves to be mentioned with it. Cruise and Watanabe worked the swords themselves, and betray no weaknesses. Zwick is a fabulous combat director, and considering the movie's scope, deserves a mention during awards season.
""The Last Samurai"" never quite reconciles what movie it prefers to be. It forces a romance between Algren and Taka, the widow, when there's no time to develop it. It tacks on a needless, uplifting epilogue to a naturally earth-moving conclusion. The movie errs on the side of being disconsolate, too, in portraying the one-dimensionally evil Omura and Col. Bagley (Tony Goldwyn), one of Algren's former superiors who enjoyed slaughtering innocents in Indian raids. Such stark lines of romance and villainy detract from the movie's underlying elegy of samurais courting death against the machines.",1073260800,4,3712,5.076923076923077

Still, I think the fans of Tom Cruise and the modern Hollywood presentation would have seen this as more of an overwhelming hit than I did, as I plunked down for 150 minutes of what was, after all, the fabled silver screen that had so entertained me as a kid in the 1970s.  What it looked like, more than anything else, was a new entry in the style of shoot-em-up (or slice-em-up) Western movies, as indeed the time setting would make it, at 1876 - 1877.  Cpt. Algren, late of Custer's fame in the post-bellum Indian campaigns, is off to assist the nascently forward-looking empire of Japan, who seems to be having its own trouble with stubborn indigenous folk.  In taking a newly-formed conscript army to the field against the nobly-savage Samurai (are these the same ""Samurai"" I remember there being seven of?), he comes face-to-face with who they really are, under the care of the gracious Taka (Koyuki), who bids him to carry on the tradition of her family's honor, using his ""mind"".  Don't worry, the ""mushy"" parts aren't all that frequent, as in the typical John Wayne or James Stewart classic, so the younger boys won't have to keep their eyes shut long.  I was indeed struck by the immense quality of the cinematography, on what appeared to be a 2.35:1 aspect screen, and the action buffs will be thrilled by all of the assorted combat, both hand-to-hand and (one-sidedly) firearms-related.  Students of Japanese will approve of the dialogue (including by Cruise) in that language, though I had to keep my glasses fully on to read the subtitles.  My overall effect, upon walking back into reality, 127 years later, was one of feeling good.  This is what we earn our entertainment dollars (or Euros, Yen) to buy, and it was well worth it.

2008915,4,B0001JXOVC,"A solid war film with epic battle scenes. A bloodbath, however, with a penchant for excessive violence, this film seeks a portrayal of glory and honor through battle in the name of the Emperor. (On an ancillary note: Cruise exercises considerable poetic license, but this is overshadowed by the sheer framework of the story itself--the way it should be for historical narrative.)
The Framing of the film.
As pointed out in the film, the term 'samurai' means 'to serve' and the eeking out of this fidelity to imperial principles is the backdrop for conflict to be settled in a massive bloodletting--what we have here is an eclipsing of the times. Foreign influences invading and suffocating cultural heritage, advanced weaponry and commercialism strangling the Japanese economic and political powers. What frames this contest of arms vs. honor, of modern vs. tradition, is a mutiny of cultural identity that has turned the government in on its own people. A nation whose own traditions are left to the wayside in favor of a 'costume' of foreign security. This is a country eating itself up--a self-devouring nation ravaging itself and thereby allowing outsiders to ravage it further. This crisis of national identity--the effect of ""wannabes"" donning the latest novelty fad and ""purists"" upholding a cultural epistemology--divides the nation and sets the stage for an unforgettable clash of political ideology.
For those who enjoyed the ""Meiji patriotism"" of the samurai exhibited in The Last Samurai, I recommend Yukio Mishima's classic novel, Runaway Horses, which chronicles the rise of leftist(""purist"") resentment towards invading influences that were growing rampant(cancerous) in the nation's economic and political sectors during the modern era.",1072915200,2,1752,5.4212454212454215

In their first battle they aren't ready and get defeated.  The captain gets captured and taken to a place with many Samurai.  At first, he's their enemy. He then learns the way of the Samurai, and befriends the Samurai.  To tell you anymore would be to ruin the movie.  But I can tell you this much: go see this movie- you won't regret it.",1072742400,8,1139,4.4731707317073175
2008920,5,B0001JXOVC,"A film by Edward Zwick
The year is 1876.  Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is a Civil War hero.  Officially, he is also a hero in the fight against the American Indians, but Algren is tormented by what happened.  He has nightmares and flashbacks of the slaughter of the Indians.  He is selling his story as a stage act (with the intent to sell rifles for the company putting on the show), but is trying to bury his memory in whiskey.
Algren is contacted by his former military commander, whom he hates with a passion because of the Indian slaughter.  His commander has an offer for him from the Japanese.  Algren is being recruited to train Japanese soldiers in modern warfare.  Japan is trying to modernize and step away from some of its past traditions.  To be specific, Japan is trying to separate from the Samurai tradition.  The Japanese military is also trying to put down a rebellion from Samurai rebels who claim that Japan's modernization is happening too fast.  Algren accepts the position (the money is good), and begins to train the Japanese.  Even though they are making improvements, they are not yet ready for battle when they are commanded to fight against Katsumoto's (Ken Watanabe) Samurai rebels.  The Samurai soundly defeat the army in the battle as the army is so undisciplined that they break ranks at the first charge.  Algren is isolated and is fighting for his life.  When Algren can fight no longer, one of the Samurai is prepared to kill him, but Katsumoto decides to take Algren prisoner.  Even though it took some time to get here, this is where the movie truly begins.
Algren is in the care of Katsumoto's sister, Taka (Koyuki).  We are taken on a journey with Algren as he is nursed back into health but still deals with the scars of his past.  Algren must spend the winter as a prisoner because when the snow falls, there is no way out of the village.  During this time, Algren learns about the samurai through conversations with Katsumoto and he begins to come to peace with himself.  There also seems to be a gentle love interest forming between Algren and Taka, but so much of it is unspoken and shown throw gesture and glances.
I thought this was a beautiful movie.  The cinematography was just stunning and while the film may have had a slower pacing, I found it incredibly engaging.  Edward Zwick is the director of the underrated ""Courage Under Fire"" and ""The Seige"", ""Legends of the Fall"" and the excellent film ""Glory"".  He doesn't make bad movies.  ""The Last Samurai"" is one of the year's best thus far, and I would definitely recommend it.",1072742400,10,2576,4.637969094922737

2008932,4,B0001JXOVC,"The Last Samurai, the new Tom Cruise action epic features nice perfomances and great battle sequences.  Director Edward Zwick who made the astounding ""Glory"" along with the fine film

""Legends of Fall,"" makes another epic with powerful direction.
  Tom Cruise delivers a powerful performance as
captain nNathan Algren.  He was a hero during the Civil War, but he feels much shame for a horrible atrocity which he participated in which was a slaughter of Indian women and children.  He feels remorse for the Indians and much contempt in the general who he helped commit the act.  So he flees to Japan to train the Japanese army for 500 dollars a month.  During a beginning battle he is captured by a group of Samurai warriors.  Ken Watanabe is so compelling as the Samurai leader he nearly humiliates Cruise.  Cruise is so amazed by the teachings and beliefs of the Samurai he stays with them and fights for their cause.
  Being a $140 million epic, The Last Samurai truly does deliver.  The battle sequences are spectacular, some of the best since Mel Gibson's Braveheart.  The Last Samurai is rated R for Strong Violence and Battle Sequences.  The battles are not exceptionally bloody but include guns, bayonets, swords, arrows, spears and cannonfire.  They are made to be more intense than actually gory.
  The film has been nominated for 3 Golden Globes. Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor and Best Origianl Score are the nominees. It will probably receive a substantial amount of Academy Award nominations, we'll just have to wait and see.  All in all a fine film worth viewing in theatres and owning on Video or DVD.

There were no cheesy moments in this film.  There were no gratuitous gore, violence, or nudity.  No sex, just the gentle suggestion of what could happen at some other date.  It was fabulously done.  Fully believable, and very in tune with the Japanese culture that I was exposed to while living there.
Clearly a previous reviewer didn't watch the film carefully.  The main character was never officially made a samurai; however, he was exposed to eastern philosophies in a gentle, very authentic, eastern philosophy way.  The main character learned about mindlessness, mindfulness, and other tennants of Buddhism, but overall the main theme of this epic was HONOR.  Honor in living, honor in battle, and honor in death.
Young teens and older children could watch this field, because it lacks the graphic violence and sexuality as I mentioned before.  I am the mother of a 12 and 15-year-old, and I will show it to them  with no hesitation.",1072656000,7,1105,4.835106382978723

2008935,3,B0001JXOVC,"Every year a crop of prestige pictures get dumped out of the major studios in Hollywood.  Every one of these large scale epics is full of wild battles, romance, outstanding performances, and the cream of the crop celebrities.  These are the films that are especially created to win the coveted Academy Awards.  The problem is every year one film is so big, so bloated, and so prestigious it turns into a silly mess.  This year's film is EDWARD ZWICK'S THE LAST SAMURAI.  A fun action film that longs to be SCHINDLER'S LIST.
The Last Samurai stars Tom Cruise (Vanilla Sky) as Captain Algern, a soldier who stood with General Custer as he made his famous last stand.  While in battle he is forced to kill innocent Native American women and children, and it eats away at his soul.  Turning him to drink.
When his old associates give him a job training Japanese soldiers to fight against a Samurai warrior named Katsumoto (Ken Wantanabe, T.R.Y.).  Everything seems okay.  That is until he's captured by Katsumoto and begins to learn the law of the Samurai.
THE LAST SAMURAI at it's best boasts some of the most breathtaking close up battle scenes I've seen in a long time.  I could hardly believe that for once I could follow the battles, because for the first time in a long time the camera stayed pretty steady.  It simply wasn't sound effects and shaky steady cams moving around.  It was real, and true battle choreography.  Now that made me smile.
I also loved the scene in which Algern battles a group of overzealous Japanese soldiers who are attacking his friend.  The scene actually works and is a rare sight.  A modern fight scene that doesn't feature wire effects or CGI.  It reminded me of old Bruce Lee movies.  A scene that was about a fight and not about special effects creating it.
SAMURAI also features a nice relationship between Algern and Katsumoto.  Enemies that become friends, Wantanabe's character is strong because it feels real.  Unlike SONNY CHIBA's silly turn as the proverb spouting sword dealer in KILL BILL.  Wantanabe exudes the feeling of a real Samurai and not of a silly Kung Fu movie reject.  I loved how he could embody this man who is torn between his country and his king.
SAMURAIS real flaw is that it thinks it's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, THE SEVEN SAMURAI, CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON, and DANCES WITH WOLVES, when it's really just a fun battle movie.  It takes itself far too seriously.  You watch it with this feeling that at any moment you'll see a graphic pop on the screen that says ""FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.""
It also gets the award for the silliest and most melodramatic thing screamed by an actor in peril in 2003.  Algern is going through alcohol withdrawal and screams ""SAKI"" at the top of his lungs.  I was sitting next to my brother-in-law, and every time the film hit another stupidly melodramatic moment I would whisper ""Saki!!""  It kept me entertained.
I was also aghast that in front of me a small boy no more than five was sitting there.  There is a pretty gruesome scene in which a man loses his head.  Never have a felt so badly for a little child than I did when he screamed out in terror and then latched onto his mothers shoulder.  LISTEN PARENTS OF THE WORLD, THE RATING SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED SO THAT THIS KIND OF THING DOESN'T HAPPEN.  YOU WANT TO WATCH AN R-RATED MOVIE RENT IT AT YOUR LEISURE.  DON'T BRING A FIVE YEAR OLD TO THE MOVIES TO WATCH IT. (Calming Down) Thank you!
THE LAST SAMURAI is a mixed bag.  On one hand its breathtaking to watch and on the other its kinda of silly.  I'm going to recommend it to those whom like really cool battle sequences.  But for the rest of you why not give THE SEVEN SAMURAI or even BRAVHEART a chance.  They are far better films.
*** out of 5",1072483200,4,3741,4.532835820895523
2008936,4,B0001JXOVC,"First of all, if you want to see the real samurai in film, see Kurosawa.  He is, and will be, the definite master of the genre (or any genre of film) and ""The Last Samurai"" does not change his undisputed status.  Still Tom Cruise's new film has several merits of its own, and to watch the fictional Japan with great Japanese cast is worth a look.
Disillusioned and alcoholic American officer, Tom Cruise's Nathan Algren, is hired to train the Japanese army.  The time is in the 1870s, when Japan's new government is struggling to establish its rule over the country, and rebellious ""samurai"" (techinically there were no samurai at that time, though) are unstable elements in the new-born nation.
After the bloody battle, Nathan is captured alive by the leader of rebel samurai Katsumoto (brilliant Ken Watanabe).  Katsumoto keeps the wounded American within his village, knowing that the coming severe winter will shut down any access from outside.  Moreover, Katsumoto says, he wants to ""see his enemy.""
After the sagging middle part, while the film portrays the gradual understanding between Katsumoto and Algren, it gives occasional actions using Japanese swords (including those of ninjas which tells that Hollywood still do not understand).  Wait to see when it finally leads to the big action scene, of which very authentic and dynamic power is undeniable, even though it is still tainted by Hollywood ending.  All Japanese audiences know (and grieve to see) that the Japanese soldiers would not ""kneel"" that way on the battlefield.
If anything should be recommeded, that is its production designs and Watanabe's acting.  The sets of Japanese village and Japanese town (of Yokohama 130 years ago) are literally perfect.  (Think about they were mostly bulit in the field of New Zealand or the backlot of Hollywood studio.)  Being myself a Japanese who experienced many sad cases of misunderstandings of Western films, I can testify that there are no strange things coming from so-called ""Orientalism.""  Surely they did homework.
And Ken Watanabe.  Watanabe's samurai is far better and rounded than Tom Cruise's rather (cliched - ?) American.  In fact, Cruise is good, but his performance is clearly enhanced by Watanabe's much subtler and more charismatic acting.  In him you will be looking at a new Yul Brynner of ""The King and I,"" with his dignity and slight touch of humor this late great actor so easily had shown.  And many Japanese audiences know that Watanabe once suffered from leukemia, and this fact might have lent his convincing portrait of ""The Last Samurai"" a solemn tone.
To be frank, Edward Zwick's idea about ""Bushi-do"" or ways of samurai looks too ""Westernized"" to us.  The film shows the armoured samurai riding the horse, but actually, this battle style had already been out-of-date around this era.  Any Japanese know that before the Meiji era (which the film depicts), we had a very long peaceful time that lasted about 250 years, and during the period the samurai underwent many changes.  And though Katsumoto insists on using swords, the fact is samurai used early-style rifes back in the late 16th century.  The film is engaging, but just do not take the film as the historical facts about samurai.
Incidentally, there is a book called ""The Last Samurai"" by Mark Ravina about a real-life, well-known historical figure Takamori Saigo, whose life is one of the possible inspiration of Katsumoto.",1072396800,33,3424,5.028318584070797
2008937,5,B0001JXOVC,"""The Last Samurai"" is an excellent film, respectful of its source material even while telling a fictional story.  The ""foreigner joins a warrior culture, taking on their strange dress and winning their respect"" story is well-represented on film and in history, from Bonnie Prince Charlie to ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""Dances with Wolves,"" as well as the Japanese-themed ""Shogun,"" which is based on the life of Miura Anjin/William Adams.  Here, Tom Cruise is the stranger in a strange land, and the Samurai of Japan are the warrior culture.
Being no stranger to Samurai films of Japanese history, I was pleased by all aspects of ""The Last Samurai.""  Both the modernizing Meji government and the past-looking Samurai of the period are well represented, although the Samurai come out looking much better.  The warrior code of Bushido is not explained, and the lifestyle is completely romanticized, yet this is a movie and not a history text.  Emperor Meji is well-played, which surprised me.  He is neither hero nor villain.  And there are ninjas, which improves every film.
In the vein of the big Hollywood epics, ""The Last Samurai"" serves up healthy doses of sweeping score, beautiful vistas and Japan-landscape eye candy.  The country has rarely looked so beautiful, although I bet some technicians spent plenty of time computer-erasing the omni-present power lines.  The samurai armor,while not historically accurate, looks beautiful on film.  There are more than a few scenes that leap beautifully from a Kurosawa flick.  A great looking cast helps as well.
To this day, Japan has difficulty rationalizing tradition and modernization, as can be seen in books such as ""Dogs and Demons.""  ""The Last Samurai"" has some good lessons for modern Japan, and some good entertainment for us all.",1072396800,11,1786,5.141868512110727
2008938,4,B0001JXOVC,"A disillusioned, alcoholic American soldier (Tom Cruise) hires out as a mercenary in Japan to put down the rebellion of a samurai leader (Ken Watanabe), but instead he comes to admire their ways and joins them in their struggle.  This is a deeply flawed film that nevertheless has many fine points to recommend it.  It is a rousing adventure with stirring battle scenes.  The photography, costuming, and production design are astonishing, presenting a convincing and fascinating portrait of samurai culture and Japanese peasant life.  The cast is mostly excellent, especially Watanabe, who should be remembered at Oscar time.

However, there are two things that work against this film.  The first is Tom Cruise himself.  Although he does good work here, he just seems to be too lightweight as an actor to grapple convincingly with the issues of guilt and redemption that torment his character.  The biggest problem is the film's ending, which eschews an honest resolution in favor of Hollywood convention.  Nevertheless, the things that work in this film really work well, resulting in a entertaining and worthy feature./",1072396800,5,1121,5.217877094972067

The romance was refreshing and beautiful as there are no nudity or sexual scenes that hollywood soo depends on to get ratings(or points across).  How powerful it is to just see plain human emotion show by one's ever so slight movement and gestures.  Incredible.  The Asian actors, Ken Watanabe, Hiroyuki Sanada, and Koyuki(gorgeous in all graceful forms) all deserve nominations as I rarely see such inspiring performances.  Everything you'd expect in a grand adventure from director Edward Zweck.  The music by Hans Zimmer is truly deserving.  Though not as ""Japanese"" as some reviewers stated, I truly felt heart motivated through his symphonic composition for the battle scenes.  I'm sorry, should I instead state ""awe inspired""!  So sit back, relax and enjoy something that only comes out once in awhile.  If you like this, perhaps you'll also enjoy a Japanese animation that's called ""samurai X: trust, and samurai X:betrayal"".

First, the fighting parties are potrayed in white and black: not everything was positive and romantic in samurais as well as their enemies weren't so bad always.

Tom Cruise does a wonderful acting job as he plays a soldier divided by his duty and personal values. Choosing between duties and personal values is something most of us can relate to in the everyday world, so this movie will make a personal connection with you.
Also, it's just amazing action! Some of the best battle sequences since BraveHeart, made this a real treat. The casting was excellent and the acting was solid. I was a little skeptical about japan as the backdrop for this movie, but I must say that the japanese environmental atmosphere was fantastic. Shots in the rain, fog or sunset with tom cruises black silhouette

As a movie fan, I can't say enough good about this film. The characters got you involved emotionally on levels of sadness and anger(which is another tribute to fine acting).

I'm not saying the storyline is anything new, because it's not, but these are three-dimensional characters you really come to care about by film's end. That's what modern films need is 3d characters! My only complaint about the movie is that there is one perfect -- and very powerful -- ending but we are spoon-fed two more endings after that.

I was predisposed to like this movie, I love almost anything Akira Kurosawa has done from the Hidden Fortress, to the 7 Samurai to Ran (his masterpiece). However, unfortunately for the Last Samurai it takes more to make a movie, like a plot and characters. The screenplay is pathetic and the message is twisted and sick. Feudal Japan was great, but only if you were a samurai, you had the right of summary execution if you were insulted, (hence everyone is sooo polite), and you didn't have to bust your butt in the rice paddies, nice work if you can get it.  At best the movie, like the repressive society it defends is mysoginistic. Japan is better off entering the 19th century (unified country, modern medicine, less repressive society), and gets into trouble when it takes the twisted codes of bushido into the 20th century, killing prisiones (see the book The Rape of Nanking: The Forgotten Holocaust of World War II for examples of samurai honor), banzi charges and kamakazi.  For a far better, and wittier review go to Stephen Hunter of the Washington Post.

""The Last Samurai"" has been released for two weeks now and I have seen it three times. It is that good!! In my humble opinion; Academy Awards go to Ken Watanabe for best supporting actor, or actor, Han Zimmer for musical score. More awards to costume design. And if there were an award for ""most beautiful woman on the planet"" an award would go to Koyuki. That skin, that hair, those eyes!
The story of ""The Last Samurai"" takes place during the last quarter of the 19th century. Japan is struggling with the notion of leaving behind the old Japan steeped with her many traditions only to embrace the strange and brash ways of a new and pragmatic modern Western world.
For centuries the Samurai has been responsible for protecting not only the people of Japan but her Emperor as well. But the Emperors, Japans living God, desire to bring Japan in line with the 19th century will come at a price. Human lives will be lost, tradition will be cast aside, and, sadly, the fate of the Samurai will follow that of the Carrier Pigeon.
This then is the story of Japans rebirth. A metamorphis wracked with pain and suffering yet one filed with hope for a new and better future. Ken Watanabe (the last Samurai) is excellent, as is Cruise, and Koyuki. You will need to bring at least one box of Kleenex to the theater as crying is welcomed.

2008957,1,B0001JXOVC,"""Not Real History But A Fun Fantasy Adventure"", is a simple way to describe this movie. I was very excited to hear this movie was coming out. I have written several papers on the subject and not only admire Edward Zwick's other movies but I am a Tom Cruise fan as well. Unfortunately I was very disappointed in the movie, Tom Cruise was fantastic and the cinematography is beautiful but the film is almost completely ""factless"". America did open up trade with Japan but French and German officers trained the Japanese imperial army, they at the time had the best Foot soldiers. Also the young Emperor of Japan was not torn between the new and old ways, He instead was the driving force behind modernizing Japan as fast as it did, he saw the Samurai as one of the main reasons Japan had fallen so far behind. The Samurai that rebelled against the Emperor were considered ""RONIN"" meaning Samurai with no master, and sense Samurai means ""To serve"" they were despised by the Samurai that served the Emperor and were perceived as Dishonorable. The rebel Samurai also had full divisions that used Firearms; it was not the Bows vs. Rifles you see in the movie. And most importantly it was not the Honorable Samurai protecting the Peasant people from the heartless new way of the Evil imperial Japanese Government, quit the opposite is true. Japan had been divided for more then a century; the clans had known nothing but war. When the Shogun took power the Emperor was nothing more then a symbol and was never allowed to leave his Palace. The Shogun had the real power and the whole time it was most of Japan, the peasants and working class that suffered under the Samurai, They were Honorable warriors but only to other Samurai, ordinary Japanese were considered Less then Men and could be killed at the whims of the Samurai. It was the modernization of Japan that threatened the rule of the Samurai with the Shogun being forced to step down in 1867 and put the power back in the hands of the Emperor as well as the working class of Japan. Most Samurai saw this and surrendered the old way to the new seeing that The Samurai were obsolete, but the few that rebelled were motivated by Power, status and wealth that they were losing and not for the People of Japan like the film so badly suggests. This is a fun film if you watch it as a fantasy adventure with no basis in history. I give it a low rating because even thought both Tom Cruise and Edward Zwick admit that this is not what really happened but wanted to capture the spirit of the Samurai in a fiction film, I feel this is irresponsible and that this film dishonors the real history of Japan.",1071705600,6,2646,4.514583333333333

2008959,5,B0001JXOVC,"Honor.  Integrity.  Loyalty.  And Bushido (translated to, ""way of the warrior"").  What place do these hold in life and all it encompasses.  Warner Bros. ""The Last Samurai"" attempts to depict the epic and time age tale of traditional norms versus a new and modernizing society.
The story takes place in Japan.  However, not Japan as we know it today, but just as it was emerging from its bloody, feudal cradle.  A feudal bloodbath entailing Japanese ways of life no more than 150 years ago.
""The Last Samurai"" begins with a Japanese empirical advisor who needs the samurai eliminated in order to finish his railroad.  At first the samurai are viewed as imperial rebeliests; ""barbarians"" with no sense of what is right and wrong.  The advisor hires an American Civil War veteran, Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), and for $500 a month he trains a small army of men to fight the samurai.  But when the samurai attack a railroad construction village the advisor becomes impatient and orders Cruise's superior officer Colonel Benjamin Bagly (Tony Goldwyn) to lead the small and unprepared force against the samurai.  The skilled and experienced samurai easily overpower the unpolished army and take Cruise as their prisoner.  Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) the group leader of the samurai, along with other agendas, wishes to ""know his enemy.""
Cruise eventually grows to love the simplicity and stillness of the samurai way of life.  He adopts the concept of Bushido (Japanese for ""way of the warrior""); a theme that flows compassionately throughout the film.  Over the course of a year he learns samurai ways, their fighting methods, and even eventually begins to learn their language. But when his new found life is threatened by the old, he chooses to fight with the men he once considered his enemy.
Tom Cruise plays Nathan Algren, a downtrodden Civil War veteran who douses his troubles in alcohol.  He suffers from flashbacks that give Cruise's character a sense of shame and weariness.  And while Cruise's performance is exceptional even he cannot take precedence over the grandeur and scope of what ""The Last Samurai"" does symbolize.  The death of an era, and the usherance of technological assimilation.
Asian actors Ken Watanabe (Katsumoto), and Koyuki (Taka), play their roles brilliantly; and while their dialogue is not as numerous as Cruise's, their actions speak for more than themselves.  Katsumoto, is a proud, thoughtful, and an integrible samurai leader.  For more than 900 years he and his ancestors have protected the ways and honor of his people.  He and Cruise periodically converse in philosophical meetings sprinkled with humor.  Taka shines as Cruise's caretaker.  However, very early in the movie we find out that Taka is a widow of a samurai that Cruise has killed in battle; an enigma that lends a sense of depth and responsibility to both characters roles throughout the movie.
Perhaps one of the more historical points is the weakness of the Japanese Emperor, Meiji, played by Scichinosuke Nakamura.  At this point of Japan's history, the Emperor became more of a figurehead, controlled by a group of economist advisors only wishing to fatten their wallets.  But this is portrayed in more of a symbolic matter throughout ""The Last Samurai.""
Both the complexity and simplicity of ""The Last Samurai,"" enjoy ubiquity throughout the film.  There is never a moment in which both must not be weighed equally.  With every scene there is a sense of duty and honor, while there is at the same time enjoyment in the stillness of life.  A concoction of artsy filmography and articulating background music allow the plot to encompass all aspects of the movie; never will a moment take precedence over the plot or all that it strives to facilitate.  The facts of the matter are perhaps best but in a quote from the movie:
Algren:  ""Life in every breath . . .""
Katsumoto:  ""That is Bushido""
All in all I would have to say ""The Last Samurai"" will be going on my all time favorite list.  Never have a watched a movie with such compassion and dedication towards one fervor.  Every fight scene is not without purpose, and a message.  And the action does not sway the viewer from the movie's ultimate and undeniable essence.
Several comparisons by other film critics have compared the movie to ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" and ""Dances with Wolves,"" in which the westerner becomes infatuated and then eventually assimilated into the natural culture; I even noticed several parallels to ""Glory,"" which was also directed by Edward Zwick.  And while these aspects may have lended something to the movie, simply enjoy it for what it is; volumes could be written on the parallels to Akira Kurusawa's ""Seven Samurai."" No matter how many similarities there may be, there are just as many original concepts to be beheld.
The only one complaint I have is the ""Hollywood"" ending.  Hauntingly familiar to ""Dances with Wolves,"" it was ending that did not seem befitting of such a cinematic masterpiece.  However, I would have to say that it is worthy of any notable DVD collection.
After the movie was over and the credits began their usual scroll, I noticed that nearly half the people in the audience sat there while the other half stood and enjoyed the music.  I would like to think that they remained in deep contemplation and awe of all that this movie put into essence.  I know I did . . .",1071532800,13,5370,4.899336283185841

He reluctantly accepts a position to train an army of Japanese transcripts to use Western fighting techniques to combat the Samurai. He is ultimately captured by the Samurai, who need him as a source of information about their enemy.

A former comrade (Billy Connolly) gets him a job training the new Japanese Army to fight against the samurai, who are rebelling against moderization. Algren is captured by the samurai and becomes an ally of Katsumoto (Ken Wantanabe), the samurai leader.
I'm not a huge Cruise fan, but I do think this is one of his better performances. He seems to have a knack for displaying self-disgust (MAGNOLIA) and he taps into it here. The film's first act is its strongest part. Cruise is believably decrepit, and the opening battle, where the samurai swoop down on the frightened Japanese soldiers, is haunting. Indeed all of the action scenes are very well put together.
In the film's middle section, Cruise learns how wonderful it is to be Japanese and follow the way of the Samurai. This seems to consist of walking around, meditating, and practicing swordfighting. Cruise and Wantanabe have several metaphysical conversations, and Wantanabe performs with wonderful wit and economy, but nothing happens for far too long.

He goes from the disillusioned American soldier who has lost all meaning of what he was fighting for after killing innocent Native Americans to finding peace with himself and discovering something worth giving his life for.

They are truly wonderful actors and now one of my most favorites..... I cant tell you how great this movie was! It moved me in sooooo many ways... Ways as in the movie having parts that were funny, a lot of actions parts, and the best of all the dramatic parts... I like seriously cried 3 times!!! And I havn't done sooo in a long time when watching a movie!!! That just tells you how more powerful this movie is!!! It takes you there with all the Japanese Samurais and gives you another perspective on that kind of people....

Moreover, the film's main character Nathan Algren seems resistant to the West and its ideals as he is haunted by memories of fighting the ""Indians.""  Through his interaction with the samurai, he comes to realize the rootlessness of the West.  The West seems bent on doing, while the samurai focus on being.  It is through Algren's observations of samurai connection between mind and body that he finally rejects the West and its ways.

2008966,5,B0001JXOVC,"""The Last Samurai"" is one of this year's best movies! It is brilliant and poignant, with emotional and brilliant performances by Tom Cruise, Ken Watanabe, and the rest of the cast. Tom Cruise is Captain Nathan Algren, a man who is conflicted by the past by a very serious incident that happened during the Civil War. He is offered a job in Japan, where he is going to train the emperor's soldiers. But, when they are pulled into combat early, that is when during the soldiers' first attack that Algren is captured by the Samurai and kept alive by Katsumoto, played by Ken Watanabe. That he is where he learns about his enemy and gets enlightened by them and decides to stay with them. Timothy Spall plays Simon Graham, a translator and photographer who is with Algren in this magnificent journey. Billy Connolly plays Zebulon Gant, a dear friend of Algren. Tony Goldwyn plays Colonel Bagley, a comrade and enemy of Algren's. This is a brilliant movie with a powerful story and a powerful word about how you look at things and you think at what they should be. Edward Zwick's directing is brilliant. The costume design by Ngila Dickson is splendid. The production design by Lilly Kilvert is incredibly beautiful. The film editing by Steven Rosenblum and Victor du Bois is excellent. The cinematography by John Toll is brilliant. The music by Hans Zimmer is powerful and brilliantly excellent. The story & screenplay by John Logan, Marshall Herskovitz, & Edward Zwick is emotionally powerful and brilliant. Go see this movie and it might inspire you and make you think about things in perspective. See it before you see ""The Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King"" in theaters everywhere. I enjoy this movie because it was a little different than some people expect. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys these kinds of movies. Even a person who isn't a Tom Cruise fan will probably enjoy it as well.",1071360000,12,1907,4.72972972972973

2008968,5,B0001JXOVC,"Warner Brothers can?t catch a decent break, can they? For the last three years, the studio has had a mixed year based on the performance and public reaction of their films with the missteps outshining the successes. 2003 continues that trend with the poor reception of films like Gods & Generals, Dreamcatcher, Alex & Emma, and Looney Tunes: Back in Action. But what makes this year all the more hurtful was the fact that studio was expected to have had a good year riding the Matrix sequels alone. After the mixed reaction Reloaded received in May, The Matrix Revolutions couldn?t compete like it was expected too and failed to even break the $170 million mark the original film set in 1999. So with those thoughts in mind, what good can Warner Brother executives find in this year? Oscar potential. The studio?s leading Oscar contender is Clint Eastwood?s Mystic River but recently The Last Samurai has emerged to be heading for Oscar gold as well. The film?s leading man, Tom Cruise, hopes this is true in order to redeem the failure of capturing a nomination last year with his role in the critically praise Minority Report. Whether Warner Brothers pushes more for this film or Eastwood?s picture depends on Samurai?s performance but what can be said is that this film will definitely be raising eye brows.

The Last Samurai focuses on the journey of a man from the United States who is sent to Japan to help eradicate a rebellious force but learns more from his enemy then he ever imagined. Captain Woodrow Algren is no stranger to the field of battle. He has seen things that many can?t even imagine. Things that he would gladly like to forget if he could. In the time after the Civil War, Captain Algren takes to the bottle like many generals in the 1870?s America. With the Civil War now over, all that is left is the rebellious Indian tribes that have decreased in number rapidly and have been nearly suppressed. But the captain is surprised to be offered the position of training Japanese troops in destroying the last of the samurai warriors that have rebelled against the Emperor who has forced Western society on the nation of Japan. After he is captured by Katsumoto and his band of samurai warriors, Captain Algren learns that the rebel force is not as ?savage? as was once thought. Eventually he comes to find the true meaning of honor, necessity, and remembrance of where one comes from by joining Katsumoto in preserving the samurai way of life. The story of The Last Samurai has to be quite possibly one of the most thought provoking scripts of the year, even beyond the complex realm of the Matrix sequels earlier this year. The film successfully blends historical content from the post-Civil War events both in the United States and Japan with the exquisite traditions and philosophies of the ancient samurais. The Last Samurai is a positively rare sight in the modern age of big budgeted epic dramas that present dazzling special effects but fail to deliver insight into the human experience.

Though only one member of the film?s cast can be easily recognizable to American movie-goers, it doesn?t really matter all that much as the level of true acting talent goes far beyond the means of one?s star-power. Tom Cruise gives in all honesty one of the best performances of his career, even more so then his critically acclaimed role in Steven Spielberg?s 2002 sci-fi drama, Minority Report. The amount of determination and vivid emotions Cruise brings to the role go far beyond the acting he has demonstrated in the past and showcases a true sense of maturity in the roles he has chosen and will choose in the future. Captain Woodrow Algren is a perfect presentation of the concept of the will to open one?s self to new culture and way of life despite all those who claim in can not be done. Ken Watanabe, who portrays the samurai lord Katsumoto, does a superb job with the material that is given to him and though some may note that he struggles with the English language presented in the script that is the point of the character. It?s a beautiful portrayal of a talented actor learning the language and the traditions of vastly different culture along the same lines as the character he plays in the film does. Though some may have complaints about the limited appearance Koyuki has as the widow wife Yaka, one must look beyond the amount of screen time her character has and concentrate rather on the substance of her material that does exist. Yaka?s conversation with Katsumoto in which she expresses disagreement over her care of Captain Algren demonstrates the prominent theme of the film, one of a battle raging between honoring the traditions of one?s ancestors yet at the same time maintaining a willingness to break free from those traditions and progress in the world.

Overall, The Last Samurai is a rare theatrical treasure that not only successfully presents to the audience a well choreographed Bella-drama of breath taking action sequences and spectacular visuals but intellectuals statements that expresses the idea of expanding one?s mind to a world beyond their own realm. Despite containing an excessively long three hour time length, The Last Samurai does manage its time well although it is to say it does have its points where slow downs are less then warranted but these misgivings can be easily ignored. Many of the concepts that discussed within the framework of the film, namely necessity and ancestry, have already been presented in some degree in the two Matrix sequels earlier this year but Samurai manages to go beyond those films and express those same thoughts on far-less complex level. The way of the samurai is to stick to the traditions of their ancestors and not modernize the way their people have lived for hundreds, if not thousands, of years but as Katsumoto soon comes to realize, modernization, in one form or another, is inevitable in any society. Modernization can be integrated into an already existing culture but not to the extent that all traditions and practices once held by that society are lost forever. The intricate demonstration of certain philosophical practices within the film must be seen to be fully understood by anyone interested by the feature?s premise. The Last Samurai is without a doubt the best, if not the most surprising, film of the year, far exceeding even the extravagantly high expectations set by The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. Though greatly overlooked at this year?s Academy Awards ceremony, those who witness this film?s brilliant achievements and take its message to heart will give this film a far greater honor then any Hollywood awards ceremony could ever give.",1071360000,11,6684,4.851138353765324
2008969,5,B0001JXOVC,"I just got back from seeing The Last Samurai and couldn't wait to share my thoughts. I won't recap the story as that's been done already but will try to capture the impact it had on me.
The concepts of honor & loyalty in Samurai are extremely powerful, especially when shown opposite American/Western ideologies which focus on power & money. I'm not saying that our philosophies are wrong and Japanese are right but I did find a lot to think about in relation to my life and how these principals are carried out. Finding a balance between them would be the best goal.
One critic said that Samurai doesn't engage emotions the way Gladiator did. I totally disagree. I never connected with the characters in Gladiator the way I did with this film. In fact, Gladiator left me a little cold. Samurai, on the other hand, left me with lots of emotions - sadness, satisfaction, & respect, for example.
I went to the movie because my boyfriend wanted to see it and ended up liking it almost more than he did. I plan on seeing it at least 1 more time in order to better grasp some of the more subtle ideas.",1071273600,14,1096,4.430693069306931
2008970,3,B0001JXOVC,"I like Tom Cruise, but I was kind of disappointed.  It's an entertaining movie, but don't try to compare it to classical ones (7 Samurais, braveheart...). The story is unrealistic and box office oriented.  Good job in cinematography and fight scenes.",1071273600,5,250,5.073170731707317
2008981,4,B0001JXOVC,"The story:
Tom Cruise plays Nathan Algren, a Civil War Captain, haunted by memories of Custer's raid, who is hired to train the Japanese army the western way with artillery to fight in combat against the samurai.  But one day in battle, he is wounded and captured by the enemy.  The strength and determination Algren shows in defending himself against the samurai fascinates the leader of the samurai, Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe).  Katsumoto begins speaking with Algren and learning more about him, and Algren finds himself slowly learning the way of the samurai and adopting the lifestyle of the villagers around him.  As the story unfolds, he begins turning more and more into a samurai and eventually winds up fighting for them.
The lowdown:
Edward Zwick, who made ""Glory"" directs this film with the eye of an artist. The entertaining film moves at a brisk pace, and it is always fascinating to watch Algren's character change as he sees another world in a village perched high on a mountain in supposedly ""enemy"" territory.  The film's beautiful colors and long shots, brought to life by the great John Toll (Thin Red Line), takes us to a world of another day.  The other highlight is the score by Hans Zimmer, one of my favorite composers (Black Hawk Down, Thin Red Line, etc.)  These two technical aspects help the film a great deal, and help draw us into the conflicting worlds of old Japan and new Japan; the artillery and the samurai sword.  The vivid imagery brings to mind the great films of Kurosawa; the heavy rain dripping down a thatched roof or two men practicing a duel on a field high on a mountain reminds us of ""Seven Samurai;"" the long shots of samurai colors and soldiers resembles ""Kagemusha"" and ""Ran.""  Tom Cruise does a fine job in the role of Algren, though I think another actor would have been more fitting, as Cruise is more of a modern and contemporary actor.  Even his voice is just too modern to be thrown into the late 1800s.  But still, he makes his character convincing.  The Japanese actors, especially Watanabe help the film a lot.
 With that said, this is a very good movie, but not a great one.  The film panders to  clichs and Hollywood formulas too much at times, and the script is nearly not as deep as the visuals.  At times, Zwick seems to walk the thin line between being an artist and a hack.  The characters and dialogue are adequate, but not profound or heavily insightful like ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (an unfair comparison for any movie) or even recently ""Master and Commander.""  I mention these two films, because these are both grand epics that are as focused on their characters and conflicts as they are with action and battle scenes.  Deep character development is key in a story like this, because there are many conflicts within: A man searching for identity, a battle between an old and new world, a battle between cultures.  The film does not delve deeply enough into these matters, but it is still entertaining and at times even thought-provoking.  The battle scenes are well staged, but those who have seen a Kurosawa movie, specifically ""Seven Samurai,"" ""Kagemusha,"" or ""Ran,"" probably might start thinking of those films upon watching this.  One can't help but think as grand and spectacular Kurosawa's colors and battle scenes were, there lay a heart, a soul, a deep meaning about life and people behind those epic canvas shots of war and blood.  There was a message about life in all of Kurosawa's films, and here a rather straightforward story is told in a clear-cut manner.
 There are quiet, reflective, and beautiful moments, such as Algren journaling his thoughts as he observes the Japanese village around him, or Algren adopting the way of the samurai.  And as I said before, all these scenes are fueled by great cinematography by John Toll and powerful music by Hans Zimmer.
 This is a flawed epic, but not a mess like last year's much anticipated ""Gangs of New York.""  ""The Last Samurai"" scratches the surface of the many great samurai films and Kurosawa's depth and is not as multi-layered as it should be, but there is enough fighting and entertainment to keep mainstream audiences content.  Nevertheless, the film is beautiful to look at, entertaining, well-done, and as I said before, has an amazing soundtrack (see my review of the soundtrack).  This is definitely miles ahead of a lot of garbage released these days and is highly recommended.",1071273600,8,4415,4.779973649538867
2008982,5,B0001JXOVC,"The notion of Honor is as far removed from our current everyday existence than the idea of a beleaguered Civil War Colonel (Tom Cruise) going to Japan in 1876 to train the Emperors Army in the new way of fighting an enemy: that is with guns and cannons and without swords.
In these modern times, we have put ideals like Honor, Obedience to a Code of Ethics and Allegiance to an Ideal in little boxes and placed them on a shelf along with our copies of Lincolns speeches and Aristotles Poetics. They are available but unread.
In the world of The Last Samurai, we see an honorable though innocent world in which a mans word is his badge of honor and to break it is tantamount to death.
Nathan Algren (Cruise) is a defeated man, both in spirit and in health: he has committed untold atrocities in the name of the Union Army which haunt him so much that gallons of whiskey do little to quell the pain. Cruise plays Algren with a heretofore untapped (except maybe in The Fourth of July) reservoir of pain and inner fire. Cruise is so much of a contemporary man that he usually has trouble making anything other than that believable. But here he is simply magnificent: psychically conflicted, physically stooped over by, not only his consumption of alcohol but by unresolved pain and guilt: his Algren has an inner life consumed by self disgust and revulsion that director Edward Zwick shows us in flashbacks of such power that they invoke horror in our hearts.
Algren is captured by a group of contra Samurai, trying to hold onto their ideal world and while being held captive, learns the ways of the Samurai that he eventually adopts as superior to what he has experienced in his life up to this point. His chief captor, Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) is fascinated by Algren and his reputation as a first class soldier, but in the end it is Algren that learns more from Katsumoto than vice versa. Algren experiences a world with the Samurai that he knows is doomed, because of and despite its adherence to a code of ethics based on human and humane principles that he recalls from his life in the U.S. before the Civil War. And in many ways this break from the feudal to the modern in Japan is very much like our break, after the Civil War from an agrarian society to an urban based modern one: from the innocent to the worldly, from keeping things outside our borders to inviting them in.
As a whole, The Last Samurai is breathtaking to watch but the scenes of hand-to-hand combat are thrilling: gruesome yet beautiful. And the last charge of the last battle of the film works, not only on the level of an unmatched fight between the old guard (the Samurai) and the new (an army outfitted with rifles) but on the cosmic level as a symbol of the last dying hope of an honorable world in a last desperate gasp of a conflict with the new, modern world, hell bent on proving its superiority yet obviously lacking in moral fiber and resolve.
The Last Samurai gives us a glimpse into the feudal yet honorable world of the Samurai: a world in which a man was judged by his character, his love of family and friends and his good deeds and not by his bank account or the size of his stock portfolio. And shamefully, it is a world we will never see the likes of again.",1071273600,11,3250,4.4638655462184875
2008983,3,B0001JXOVC,"The Last Samurai proves to be a very entertaining movie although I thought it was bit too long for the story. Tom Cruise does a good job protraying a guilt-ridden American warrior who was reborn as samurai warrior. It probably helped that his co-star Ken Watanabe proves to be a superior actor and he probably pushed Cruise to the higher level of acting once they began to shared scenes together. On the whole, the movie will worked for most people watching it because it gives a very idealistic look at the Japanese samurai culture at its best.
However, most of it proves to be pure historical fantasy at its best. You should never considered that this was the way it was back in Japan of 1876. Outdated armor and thinking are not the way of the Samurai. Samurai, like all warrior types, adjust and adapt to changing warfare. Anyone who even know a thing about the warring period of 1540 to 1615 understand that samurai went from bow and arrow to firearms proficiently very quickly. Where the movie take a major misstep is that while the spirit and teaching of the samurai is tradition based, fighting modes are not.
But this is a Hollywood movie made for American taste and perception. This is how many Americans see the samurai warriors of the old and just the way the many foreigners see American history as one of wars between cowboys and Indians or black folks tipping their hats to the white folks, this movie catered to best of the sternotypes. There is nothing truly historical about this film. The movie was made in the same mode as Mel Gibson's Patriot and Braveheart, all entertainment but no history.
Now this movie have been compared with Dances with Wolves and there seem to be some justice to that comparsion. Both shows how a lone white man surrounded by an alien culture, ""went native"" so to speak and aligned himself with that culture. Both movies introduced these alien cultures through that white man's perception and his inevitable acceptance and entrance to that culture. In both cases, this was well done and it serves the viewers well.",1071187200,4,2060,4.693370165745856
2008984,4,B0001JXOVC,"My favorite moments in THE LAST SAMURAI happened after Tom Cruise's integration into the samurai society. Faced with a fight, he closes his eyes and plays what he feels is going to happen in his head. Then, his Spidey-samurai senses in flux, he proceeds to slice and dice his enemies. The whole thing struck me as, to be honest, sorta amusing.
I mean, Tom Cruise's character, Nathan Allgren, is abducted by the ancient warriors early in the film, then he spends three to six months with them, first as their enemy and then as their friend. He's living in the house of a man he killed, tended to by that man's widow. The man's children, all rather understanding about their father's death being part of ""samurai duty,"" start playing with the American, thinking him a pretty cool guy. And, while all this is happening, Nathan Allgren becomes a FEARSOME SAMURAI WARRIOR. And, eventually, he's able to battle alongside the samurai general against a band of the emperor's invading ninjas. All this in less than six months!
That said, THE LAST SAMURAI is an entertaining, beautiful-looking film. Tom Cruise's character, who alternates between being a rude, drunken Civil War soldier and the sort of man who writes that he's ""beset by the irony of his life"" in his journals, is hard to pin down. But the supporting actors, particularly Ken Watanabe as the samurai general Katsumoto, are uniformly terrific in it, and they make Cruise look better and less wooden in each progressing scene.
The film even, for the most part, escapes being a cliche about the white hero coming in and saving ""savage, foreign"" warriors from themselves.
The ending is a letdown, sadly. This film would clearly work best as a tragedy, yet the filmmakers, for some reason, tack on a happy-ish ending to the film. By not daring to bring the story to its more obvious yet ultimately dark conclusion, the filmmakers instead give us a film that is less than great.
But it's fun, for the most part. It's not going to win an Oscar, except maybe for Watanabe's supporting work, but it's a fun film.",1071100800,10,2060,4.756983240223463
2008985,5,B0001JXOVC,"As a Japanese living in the United Staes, I can say totally, that this film is amazing. There're some critics says Tom Cruise's acting and so on, however, this film sucessfully depicts the history of Japan, and people's traditional lives and the end of samurai era.
This is a spectacular movie with sweeping sword actions and it is based on the true history events in japan, I've seen a lot of samurai movies(made in japan for japanese) but i can say this one is GREAT as the other movies, plus this is not usual hollywood movies that  awfully depicts samurais and even Yakuzas and brush off the truth.
I can say, however, without Tom Cruise, this movie could have also been great as well. But i would guess that it is because of him, this movie gained more attention among people and so typical americans can get the idea of what samurai really is and what they really think.
so overall i gave this movie 5 stars. I plan to go watch it again.",1071100800,179,943,4.419540229885057
2008986,3,B0001JXOVC,"Make no doubt, ""The Last Samurai"" is a sweeping, well-produced epic that is immensely entertaining. Several battle sequences, especially early in the film when Tom Cruise's character is surrounded by armored samurai, are tremendously exciting. I also appreciate Hollywood's recreation of actual events in Japanese history involving samurai warrior Saigo Takamori during the 1870s. But one cannot escape the overall feeling of dj vu throughout this film, with a predictable chain of ""Dances With Wolves"" - like events leading to the redemption of the film's main character. And the ending, as Hollywoodized as any in recent memory, is so unbelievable (and offensive) as to almost capsize the entire film.
""The Last Samurai"" is a tragedy, make no doubt. Film director Edward Zwick (who also brought us the superior epic ""Glory,"" which did not have a tacked on Hollywood ending) details throughout this film that this band of colorful and fluffy samurai warriors, the last of their kind, are headed for a Charge of the Light Brigade type conclusion. This is going to be a final, tragic stand for an ancient way of life. So to cop out (for the most part) is insulting and offensive. Why pull the punch?!
Tom Cruise gives a good performance as a former captain in the U.S. Army. He is haunted by his bloody tenure in Custer's Seventh Calvary, which included the murder of defenseless Native Americans. He is hired on as a mercenary in Japan to train the Emperor's new army in the art of modern/Western warfare. During his first encounter with a samurai rebel force, his men flee and he is captured. Cruise winters in the hidden samurai village, eventually learning their ways and making peace with a dishonorable past. Along his symbolic journey, Cruise bonds with the warrior's leader, wonderfully played by American newcomer Ken Watanabe.
Zwick has gone on record as stating his admiration for the late-great filmmaker Akira Kurosawa, who produced brilliant samurai epics during his day including ""The Seven Samurai,"" ""Ran"" and ""Kagemusha."" ""The Last Samurai"" is not anywhere near as good as those films, and lacks the kind of energy, action detail and eventually, profound tragedy that marks those international classics. Kurosawa touches are evident throughout, and the film does not suffer for it.
""The Last Samurai"" must eventually be termed a too-Hollywood product, possessing the kind of epic detail seen in great films, but lacking the courage to carry through with its tragic vision.",1071014400,2,2488,5.115479115479116
2008987,5,B0001JXOVC,"When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I thought, ""Oh man, another 'artistic' Tom Cruise movie"", but then I saw newer trailers for it and I decided to go see it. Tom Cruise is a really talented actor. I always thought he was an egotistical maniac and played himself in movies. You know, a wealthy womanizer with too much time on his hands, but this time he wasn't. The movie is about an alchoholic Civil War Captain who takes a job to go to Japan, to fight off rebels who are disgracing the Empire. The Captain, (Cruise) is taken hostage by these rebels and he finds out they are samurai. He learns many things about these people and why they stay samurai instead of converting to a regular army. Honor. They believe in practicing their heritage from their ancestors and the Captain becomes accustommed to that. There are then many battles and they were very well done. The acting from everyone in this movie was superb. The movie was alot like ""Dances with Wolves"". It was great to walk out of this movie having liked it, after I thought it was going to be bad.",1070928000,14,1068,4.426395939086294

As far as I can tell, it was rated R for the gore, and nothing else. It only has a few moments of mild profanity, and the romantic side of it would be safe to show to a six-year-old. (Though perhaps some of the viewers would not consider this an advantage.)

2008989,5,B0001JXOVC,"The Last Samurai is a thrilling epic drama set in 1876 Japan,  starring Tom Cruise  and Ken Watanabe.  Cruise plays US army Captain Algren, who has been filled with disgust at the cruelty he and his comrades have inflicted against Indians.  He accepts a post in Japan to train their newly formed army in the ways of modern warfare.  He is captured by his enemy, Katusmoto (Watanabe) and taken to his village, where he comes to appreciate the Samurai values.

This is such a beautiful film.  It has lots of battle scenes, but they are balanced by quiet vignettes where Algren learns the language and culture, and begins to take part in village life.  He comes to admire the traditional values of these people.  The overwhelming sense of honor, duty, tradition, and respect fill the story with grace and elegance.

Cruise is very good here, but I was even more impressed with the wonderful performance of Ken Watanabe, who plays the title role.  He combined ultimate power and quiet elegance to create a memorable character.  The photography and music make a truly lovely epic.  It is a lovely film.",1070928000,28,1097,4.7407407407407405

2008991,4,B0001JXOVC,"Gotta give it up to director Edward Zwick.  This guy can flat out craft a beautiful film--a movie with a solid story, characters in conflict, and cinematic vistas that take your breath away.  His latest epic, THE LAST SAMURAI, is certainly no exception to this filmmaker's impressive repertoire (a little French lingo there).
Enter Tom Cruise as a depressed, hard-drinking Army captain haunted by atrocities he's both witnessed and committed to the plains Indians.  It's hard to like a character who doesn't like himself, and the brooding captain--a restless soul looking to exorcise his demons--has few, if any, redeeming qualities.  Yet the Empire of Japan likes what it sees, as it hires the officer to train a new army to fight the Samurai, the fierce warriors committed to preserve Japan's ""old ways.""
Okay, so the story is predictable:  Cruise (who fights gallantly against such superior swordsmen) is taken captive by the Samurai, led by Japan's ""Most Wanted,"" Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe).  And Cruise, going cold turkey, comes to appreciate--to love and embrace--the noble Samurai culture, to the point he helps defend it against the Emperor's army he's been hired to train.  Sure, everyone in the theater knew the direction the story was headed, but it doesn't take away from the development of trust and brotherhood between the Westerner and his newfound friends.
Shogun and Dances with Wolves would be proud.
The fighting scenes are exciting (and implausible); the visual aesthetics stunning.  While THE LAST SAMURAI may not be Zwick's best effort, it's darn sure worth a trip to the local cinema.

2008993,5,B0001JXOVC,"Reading this may ruin your viewing of the movie, Last Samurai, by forwarning you of what it is about.
The latest Tom Cruise movie, The Last Samurai is a terrific movie-- portraying the role of big business in pushing for and aiding in the elimination of a native culture that was not supportive of trade and commerce, in this case, in Japan. And of course the US was there to provide and sell weapons and military training to kill the simple, less technological natives.
Cruise plays a tortured yet heroic character, asurvivor of the Civil War and Indian wars who stands up to the commercial, US and japanese forces who are attempting to wipe out the last of the Samurais. He stands up to these powers because it is the right thing, the noble thing to do.
Why don't we see American warriors standing up. It is almost impossible for men and women GIs in Iraq to speak out. But where are the veterans who can see that the Iraq quagmire has been a bumbling fraud, built on lies and stupid unpreparedness. Where are the brave men and women who fought in Iraq in 1991 to free Kuwait, who should clearly see what a horrific travesty the Bush administration machinations have been.
The movie was one of the best of the year, with Oscar caliber acting, script, set, and costumes, in a season with a plethora of disappointing films. I left with a glow in my heart and feeling both inspired and disgusted-- inspired by the heroic actions Tom Cruise portrays, disgusted by the way the US government has had a history of helping in the wiping out of indigenous noble cultures.  I write this as a liberal who publishes a liberal news and opinion website op ed news dot com. I'm curious how conservatives viewed this flick.",1070841600,9,1709,4.548701298701299
2008994,4,B0001JXOVC,"I have to admit that I was a bit worried about seeing this film. What, with all the reports of the ""White savior"" and how the trailer seemed to taunt that idea. I have to admit, my preconceptions were blown out of the water!
The Last Samurai reflects several historical perspectives accurately: the American desire for international influence and power, American ignorance that ran rampant throughout the time (directed towards Native Americans and the Japanese), Japan's desire for modernization and the Samurai's struggle to maintain their dying culture in the midst of westernization. In the end, a little bit of the importance for those themes is lost, but we'll cover that in a bit.
The story itself revolves around the personal experiences of Nathan Algren, played by Tom Cruise. Algren, after leading a successful (and bigoted) campaign against Native Americans travels to Japan to help quell a ""Samurai rebellion"" in a conflict between the new and the old. However, captured by his enemies, Algren spends the next several months living with the Samurai, coming to appreciate their culture and atoning for his past mistakes in assisting the Samurai in an attempt to preserve the culture they believe in.
I was wholly impressed with Cruise's performance throughout the movie as his character makes a dramatic transformation from a belligerent alcoholic to  being appreciate and reflective (Note: Although the scene where Algren is dressed by Naka, obviously lacks any nudity, it's highly sensual!) For what could have easily been a high budget potential summer blockbuster with a shallow performance, Cruise wasted no energy in his character, one of his better performances. Howevever, I have to admit that Cruise's performance was dim compared to Ken Watanabe's performance of Katsumoto, the ACTUAL LAST SAMURAI! Katsumoto's appeal as the intriguing, strong, lighthearted and wise leader of the Samurai, certainly earns him the best supporting actor nomination (if not award), in my opinion!
However, the appeal of Katsumoto also helps to highlight one of this movie's two weaknesses. Katsumoto (Watanabe) is so good, that he deserves more screen time than he receives. The same belief is the case with other characters, such as Hiroyuki Sanada as Ujio and Koyuki as Taka. The movie simply centers on Algren's perspective and fails to accomplish any dynamicism by following the storylines of other integral characters whose perspectives and performances certainly command attention. This movie would have been far more moving than it actually is had those avenues been explored.
My second beef with the movie deals with the ending, which is somewhat redeeming, but also corrective of it's initial mistake (I'm not going to ruin it for you). In any case, the director could have taken many different paths with the ending and the product only reflects one. Let's just say I hope the DVD corrects both weaknesses with added scenes and alternative endings.
In the end, you leave a whole appreciation for Samurai culture and beliefs and with a little bit of relief that the delicate cultural themes throughout the movie could have been handled far less sensitively!  The ending is forgivable, but the lack of attention to other characters drops my rating to 4 stars. In its released form, the actual product is very moving, however, its needs a little bit more polishing to make it a masterpiece. This will be a remembered movie, nonetheless.

2008997,5,B0001JXOVC,"Before I start with my reveiw,let it be known that I was never a Tom Cruise fan.  He is just another pretty face in a long list of Hollywood hunks.  Yet I must give Tom my kudos playing the washed up, drunken American soldier who volunteers to live in Japan in the early Meiji era when the whole country was in a big transition to catch up with the Western(Euro) civiliazation in fear that the country may easily colonized, which happend to China and other Asian countries.  I studied Japanese history and the character played by Ken Watanabe is loosely based on Saigo Takamori who led the Samurai rebellion in Southern Kushu, Kuwamoto prefecture. Kuwamoto lord was a strong Shogun supporter and held up to fight back the modernization of Japan.  There were several Shogun sympathisers scatterd around the country, bur Kuwamoto clan was most well known.  In actuality, Takamori joined the Meiji emperor and became one of the most outspoken supporter of the emperor's plan to open the government to the Western world.  Knowing history of Japan helps to understand what the director was trying to bring out to the not-so- knowledgeble audience.  Tom Cruise did a fine job of portraying an ignorant, cocky post Civil War soldier who ended up in the Samurai culture where only way to live was by Bushido.  The movie is all Tom Cruise which is expectd. This is a Hollywood movie with a matinee idol who has star power to attract audience so that the producers will benefit the mega bucks. Do not expect any Kurosawa from this movie.  However the movie is not totally without some messages. A similarity between the American Indians and Samurais in which they were victims of the American conquering and destroying cultures foreign to them.  In Aldren's mind, the American Indians and Samurais had a common thread; honor and loyalty to their tribes, and lived by their unbreakable warriors code. To break the code meant dishonor to their ancestors.  Death to them was never an option. Some reviewers are critical of plot shallowness, cliches, stereo typical portrayals of Japanese women and of course,a handsome white male among the not so handsome natives.  Well this is Tom Cruise's film after all.  A handsome white Samurai was very attractive even those who never seen them before. Asian countries seem to worship handsome white actors anyway. Tom's ability to master the Samurai swordsmanship in the movie is just as good as Japanese actors. Sutle performance by Koyuki(Taka)is so true to the era when the women were second class citizens and did not have any rights of their own. The women were not permitted to speak unless told to do so by husbands. Bushido was a way of Samurai's life.  Takamori's desire to write a perfect poem is contrast to the way Samurai had to live everyday.  Maybe that is why the Japanese culture is very Zen like, existential life which the Westerners are not totally in comprehension.  I strongly recommend the movie, and enjoy it for what it offers to the eyes and senses.",1070755200,17,3003,4.813229571984436
2008998,1,B0001JXOVC,"(...) Haters of Western Culture have no fear:  The Last Samarai is here!  In The Last Samurai,  the Westerners (Americans and Brits) are once again the bad guys, infecting yet another innocent race with Western ways.
The silmplistic plot involves American military officers going to Japan to help modernize the imperial military.  The time of the movie is the late 1870's when Japan was taking to western culture with a vengeance.  Tom Cruise and his men are hired to train the Japanese military to drive out the last exhisting Samarai warriors who are resistant to the new order.
All is going not-so-well, when Tom Cruise ends up captured by the Samarai enemy.  He then falls in love with their culture and their ways.  Cruise then switches sides, eventually leading the Samarai in a final, suicidal assault on the newly equipped Japanese military.
Throughout the flim, the plight of the Samarai is contrasted with that of The Native Americans in  the United States.  Both cultures have been threatened by the destructive effects of modernization (aka the white man's ways).
Such parallels are ridiculous.  The idea of  Americans exploiting the ""nobel savage"" is a Western concept';  such ideas of ""good versus evil""  have never held sway in Japan.  Moreover,  in real life the last of the Samarai simply resigned, and the prestige of the Samarai order gradually decreased over time.  It was not wiped out by a Westernized military machine.
Therein lies the film's irony;  by trying to flatter Japanese culture and history, The Last Samarai insults it.  One example of this is the depiction of Emperor Meji.  He is  depicted as an indecisive, weak- kneed boy who allows himself to be mocked by subordinates.  This is grossly innacurate and just plain shameless.  In reality, anyone who dared challenge the Emperor would have lost his head.

It is worth noting that the Samarai make a ""successful"" last stand only because they have the help of a white Westerner.  This should be enough to make the average Japanese person cringe.  The Japanese would not have taken to Cruise's character so easily, nor would they have needed him to make their last stand.
This film is a big mess that fails to capture the essence of the culture is seeks to portray.",1070755200,15,2248,4.883597883597884
2008999,5,B0001JXOVC,"I'm actually surprised how anyone can bash this film, although when I came to this review section I quickly understood why. The bashers: one, someone who hates Samurai, and knows obviously NOTHING of Bushido! While the other who loves the term Gaikokujin, which is akin to foreigner for the none-Japanese literate, apparently this ""reviewer"" is upset and angry with his own bad luck with asian women and so decides to rant furiously against a great film. It's not a ""cliched notion"" as he calls it. Captain Nathan Algren not only nearly saved her life, but is symbolic to the Zen Way. He killed her husband, and symbolically takes his place as a way of keeping his honour and as a message of karma in the film.
Now, with those two mixed up reviewers tossed out of the mix, I wish to present to you an objective opinion.
The movie was great. I loved it. My favorite film ever, and I can saw that is alot coming from me, as I am a very cultured viewer. That is not to say you might not like it, as much of the film is in Japanese, and you would need to be open-minded to embrace it as I have. I personally, went in skeptically. I don't particularly like Tom Cruise's last performances. In specific, Mission Impossible 2, and all the other movies where it focuses solely on him. It's different in this movie. Tom Cruise contains his ego, and gives other people surprisingly proportionate roles. He was a hardened battle veteran, but still the movie shows that it was not his skill, as another reviewer whined about, that was great, but his perserverance.
I don't want to spoil the movie, so go watch it! It's my personal favorite ever, ""and that's saying a lot"" *quoting Samwise Gamgee* I loved Two Towers, watched it 3 days in a row before going to see this, and still this one tops it off. Purely magnificent. A work of art.",1070755200,11,1823,4.4774774774774775
2009010,5,B0001JXOVC,"The Last Samurai is probably not for everyone. Japanese culture is almost impossible to understand to the western mindset. Feudal Japanese culture is even more difficult. Even though director Edward Zwick does a good job watering most of it down for western audiences, that's just another part of the problem. Now not only do we have a society that doesn't make sense, but now the why's and what-for's are brushed over. One example is the obligatory seppuku (ritual suicide) scene. It was a part of samurai culture, so it is shown, but western audiences are expected just to accept that samurai kill themselves when shamed, and then move on. Fans of samurai lore will be disappointed at this very shallow look into the culture and society.
However, one must remember that this is a 2 1/2-hour film and not a 9 1/2-hour mini-series like Shogun. Zwick makes a smart decision to focus on the story while walking the delicate middle ground of the setting and characters. Even so, the story feels a bit rushed at points, and Cruise turns into a samurai much too quickly. But if we suspend out disbelief just a little, what we get is a mesmerizing, and powerful story about a man who reminds the Japanese of who they are.
Tom Cruise plays Nathan Algren; a washed up, frontier war hero who's committed so much murder and atrocity that he's lost his soul and who's only friend is the bottle. He's hired by the Japanese to train their army in the way of modern gunpowder warfare. When he arrives to Japan, he soon realizes that the Japanese want to use him to erradicate enemy samurai just as his own government used him to erradicate indians.
Ken Watanabe plays Katsumoto; the samurai lord who captures Algren so that he may understand this new enemy and way of warfare he is up against. However, he and Algren form a bond of friendship, and Algren is forever changed by it.
All the acting performances in this film are top notch, and I wouldn't be surprised if Watanabe was nominated for an Oscar. Cruise gives a convincing performance of the transformation from a broken man who cares about nothing to someone who cares so much for these foreign people that he's willing to die for them. The only problem with Cruise is his ""stardom."" He's such a huge mega-star that it's often impossible to forget you are watching Tom Cruise dressed up as a samurai, which is more than a little distracting.
The Last Samurai is a breathtakingly beautiful film that is sure to land cinematography nominations. When the Japanese conscripts armed with muskets face down a charge of mounted samurai you will feal their fear. Kurosawa would be proud.
While the story is not perfect, and we are forced to endure a few cheesy moments of Algren, it is undeniably powerful and moving. Don't miss this film.",1070755200,11,2776,4.690573770491803
2009011,4,B0001JXOVC,"It is a shame that a film with so much potential to be great just missed the sweet spot. The movie had real strengths in the supporting cast and succeeded in convincing you that you were indeed in the middle of 19th century Japan. With what seemed to be ""genuine"" shoji filled spaces and beautiful countryside landscapes it was impossible to dismiss the films charm. Unfortunately the photography, while adequate, seemed to be uninspired and just very bland. The score also leaves something to be desired. During the first battle scene I found the music seemed to detract from the intensity of the battle and what should have been heart-pounding and overwhelming effect seemed more anticlimactic than anything. There were also a few scenes that used computer generated images landscapes/battle scenes which were just below todays standards.
In the end however the film was carried by strong supporting characters and a believeable Tom Cruise. One is left with an even greater admiration of the Samurai way by the end of the film; this is no doubt a by-product of Ken Watanabe's performance and the beautifully intricate armor and weapons.

I must recommend this movie.  It's the best that I've seen this year.  One of my friends who hates when Americans usurp a role that should have been played by a person indigenous to the country the movie was set in refused to see it.  However, Tom Cruise does not and cannot steal the spotlight in this movie.  The spotlight is aptly directed at the true last samurai and the actors that play them (and do so excellently).  The Japanese locales that the movie is shot in are absolutely breathtaking - they reminded me of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon's snapshots of China.  Also, for all you ladies out there who think this is a guy movie: there is plenty of action, but go see it anyway, because the action is not at the heart of the movie.

2009013,4,B0001JXOVC,"Wow!  It's a samurai flick starring Tom Cruise, and you know what: He's turing Japanese, I think He's turning Japanese, I really think so.  ""The Last Samurai"" is a film that tries to take a huge step into this imported-cult genre.  Hey, I like samurai flims and I LOVE 'Seven Samurai', so knowing that a movie like this is coming out in theaters has really got me hyped up in anticipation.  Many people say that an epic film starring Tom Cruise is a lousy gimmick for the movie to bring in the big bucks, and to make Cruise and the WB look good.  When I was checking this out, thought the lousy idea is there, ""The Last Samurai"" actually executes into a well-productive and impressive film to see.
This film start off with the handsome actor as Nathan Algren, a wasted Civil War veteran grieving over his bloody memories of that war, being sent to the land of the rising sun by authorities of two nations in order to train Bigwig soldiers how to fight against the 'antagonists'.  During his first battle of Nihhon Civil War, he lost, and instead of being killed dishonerably by the oppositioners, they took him to their turf, a really nice and solitude turf.  Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), the head village chief and captain of his soldiers, decides to use him to know more on his enemies' new weapondrym and later builds a strong partnership with Algren, that which is Cruise, to stop them.
Since I realized this isn't based on a true story, I knew that this movie would go by-the-numbers and there would be some easy-to-recognize foreshadowing moments. Hey, this is an epic movie; Epic = violence, betrayal, love, and honor. Actually, the formula works in high numbers for this flick.  Knowing how Algren mourned over the massacre in a native-american village his men caused many years ago, and how he was adjust to a Japanese village while he was captured was intriguing, especially when he knows much about the Japanese culture: how the people were respectable though silly like normal people, be spiritually intertwine, understand nature, and aware about life and death, even children must know about it; man, now I can understand why death is acceptable in Japanese animation.  Adding Aldren knowing the hidden samurai spirit within, and the whole plotting structure makes this raw sushi well-done.
Great as it seems, on the less greener side, the movie doesn't  have a certain ingenuity that makes it inspiring and feels like it plays a big role in the movie industry and in our hearts.  The movie is very emotional and breathtaking, but it's not exactly thought-provoking.  Breathtaking is what I like to say the most on the movie's production value: good selection of cast, above-par acting, wonderful musical score, and battles mixed with somewhat-noticeable special effects that really build up an adreneline rush.
'The Seven Samurai', this movie is so not at its league, but ""The Last Samurai"" is a great epic film to watch.  It's not profound, but it's still compelling in many ways.  Samurai films like this should be made more, nowadays.",1070668800,9,3048,4.825335892514396
2009014,3,B0001JXOVC,"I'll leave you in no doubt about the Last Samurai's handsome cinematography, the shots are postcard perfect and reek of a visual epic. But several movies have accomplished this carnival of color and martial arts in recent times so this cannot alone be a movie's saving grace.
Terentino had a tongue firmly planted in his cheek for Kill Bill. Zwick has no such excuse for The Last Samurai, that has all the visual splendour it needed but is a victim of its own flawed mission: the elevation of Mr. Cruise beyond what his borderline comic attire can manage. It ends up falling a prey to the same kind of setbacks that made ""Legends of the Fall"" the draggy, pretentious magnum-opus-wannabe that it had ended up being --
(1) At 144 minutes, it is waaaay too long for its content as an inane romantic subplot is smooshed in, with a cliched notion of the Japanese woman falling for the white saviour, the oh-so-handsome Gaijin. Who surreptitiously stumbles upon a task so significant that he is swinging swords to perfection and speaking Japanese comprehensibly in a matter of a few sweet months.
(2) Some of the samurai/ninja fights are neat, and SO obviously inspired by Kurosawa's work (Seven Samurais, anyone?) that it's embarrassing. Zwick though has missed an essential point: Kurosawa's movies moved.
(3) During the denouement battle scene, you could be forgiven for thinking that you were watching Mel Gibson in Braveheart.
(4) Ken Watanabe, who is topnotch in his role, as he usually is, gets a short shrift in screen time because our enigmatic (oh well) white saviour had to hog so much of it. Some of the most stunning moments of the movie emerge when Zwick tries to hone in on the dilemmas of Ken's character: to stick to the ""bushido"" (Japan's age old soul of honor and inner harmony) or to allow mechanisations and railroads to happen even if they defy the national traditions.
(5) More time is spent on a screenplay that unfolds with a turtle noir-ish pace to give the movie that nostalgically artsy look, than on giving us some basic historical underpinnings. Several issues are left hanging in the air -- for instance, without giving too much away, the direction of conquests for Japan is swayed quite simply based on a very minor suggestion.
(6) Then there is the grating narrator, who could have been skipped entirely without a dent in the narrative. Instead, voiceover gems are inflicted upon us -- ""I am beset with the ironies of life"" or ""There is some comfort in the emptiness of the sea"". Hmm.
Manage your expectations and you may well enjoy this otherwise action packed movie. But despite all its highfalutin accoutrements, one wonders if this is indeed the flaming epic that it is being made out to be.",1070668800,22,2722,4.7690677966101696
2009015,1,B0001JXOVC,"This movie is typical of Hollywood's catering to the lowest common denominators. It's a movie for ignorant, non-thinking Americans who know nothing of medieval Japan and samurai history. It's all surface and no heart. Directed by Ed Zwick, who did a rather great job with ""Glory"" back in the 1980s, ""Last Samurai"" could almost be seen as ""Glory: Japan."" It's not a bad film, but too much Tom Cruise screen time, a lack of substance, and too many Hollywood cliches weight it down. In ""Glory,"" we at least got to know about four or five of the ""minority"" characters, and that we saw them outside of the main, white character's viewpoint, but in ""Last Samurai,"" we don't see any of the Japanese characters from outside of Tom Cruise's character's perspective and as a result, we never really get to know the Japanese characters, their personalities, their motivations, what drives them, etc. etc. Inexplicably, and as is typical of Hollywood movies, the white character is in some position of influence, and far too quickly rises up in the ranks and is practically put on a level with one of the highest ranking ""minority"" leaders. If only we got to know the Japanese characters, from Ujio to Katsumoto to Taka, from outside the confines of Aldren's eyes. As it is, it's merely a visual, superficial flick that leaves the viewer with cliches in mind, as once again, a white character is made the center of action in what should be a story about Japanese (or minority) characters -- rather, they're pushed to the sidelines in their own story. And the movie is almost sunk by unrealistic action sequences which almost border on corny, and a romantic tension that is laughingly unrealistic and unlikely. Lastly, reflective of Hollywood's Eurocentricism, some of the main Japanese characters are played by Asian actors with rather Eurocentric features, especially the actors who play the female lead Taka and her main son. In Hollywood, minorities, in this case Japanese people can't look commonly Japanese and be main characters or sympathized with -- they often must look white.",1070668800,15,2073,4.9426934097421205

2009017,4,B0001JXOVC,"The Last Samurai is a Romantic film starring Tom Cruise as Captain Nathan Algren, a leader in the US army whose experiences in driving out Indian tribes such as the Cheyenne have not left him. Algren is a compulsive drinker, his drinking helps him to forget the Indian massacres of which he took part in, yet he cannot stop his nightmares. When asked to accept a job training the modern Japanese army far across the Pacific, he accepts the offer for money. He accepts, and the poorly trained army is attempted to be taught by the US generals ready to impress the modernity craving japanese emperor, and thus there is a push to attack the rebellious ""Samurai"" culture - those who are standing up for that which is not modern, retaining their old values and traditions and insisting on using classical weapons and not gaudy rifles. Tom Cruise does not believe that the poorly trained modern Japanese militia group can yet tackle the Samurai, and he has not yet learned enough of them. When the fight occurs, most of the modern army is killed or runs away. Algren is left to fight ""flag"" to sword combat with 5 efficiently trained Samurai warriors, who he presently manages to fight off as the flag he holds of a white tiger symbolizes this new white man with a robust vigor and bravery in such a subject. When he collapses, he still manages to kill one more Samurai who was about to end Algren's own life. Right before the other four Samurai exact their revenge, the rebellious leader, Katsumoto, stops them and takes him back to the Samurai village. There he is taken care of, yet throughout this time the story beings to wither. Sentimental and exciting yes, but the culture issue clearly posted a problem which the writers efficiently yet hastily attempted to cover up. During this period of recovery, there is much conversation between Algren and Katsumoto, the only other English speaker. There is much shared between the two cultures, and Algren learns to adapt to the Samurai way of life. Yet this has its weak points; such a brave Samurai reactionary community who stuck to their ideas would not have been so open to Algren; later on in the movie Algren even kisses the wife of the samurai he kills earlier. Of course it is a short kiss, and it takes an interminable amount of time for it to happen, but its sentiment was its only purpose for existing; it was not a realistic idea no matter how paternalistic or subservient women in the culture were. Complements of course to the directors and the writers for the usage of symbolism. For example, Algren stays with the Samurai for almost a year, honing up on his skills and learning Japanese. When he is returned with safe conduct back to the modern area, he is received among a flurry of rapid and liberal changes. The army has uniforms, is extremely well-trained, and in addition has access to Howitzer cannons and 200 round per minute machine guns. Algren realizes what has happened, and stops his drinking, symbolic of finally confronting his problems. After learning that Katsumoto will be killed for such an idea, he rescues him and joins with the Samurai. THe rescue of course is slightly unrealistic. One of the Samurai virtues is shame in losing, causing them to commit suicide as part of their culture. Katsumoto must do so or be killed by the modern Japanese, as they leave him in a room with a knife. When Algren shows up with a witty Bond line, there is little intercourse before the conservative leader willingly gives up his tradition and agrees to escape. Again, good movie, good entertainment, but also great clashing in cultural tradition. There is a nice allusion to Thermopylae later on, as the 500 Samurai prepare to fight the now several thousand modern Japanese troops when safely back in the Samurai village. When they are back, Katsumoto mentions to Algren about a specific blossoming tree while in an orchard with many such trees and many such blossoms. Katsumoto notes that just like the blossoms, the people would slowly die out. As they prepare for the modern Japanese attack, the relationship is furthered between Algren and Taka, the woman whose husband he killed. She allows him to wear her husband's Samurai armor, and they kiss. THAT is an error, a bad direction which should not have been ventured in. From here, the movie becomes interminable as the climax music is played and calmed and replayed, the apparent final battle stretching into more than one; the apparent final scene still an hour from the end. The fighting scenes are numerous, and though they entertain the eyes they bore the mind. One asks, which battle will end the fighting? Finally, there are but less than a score of Samurai calvalry left alive, and the modern Japanese general commands the army to mow them down using the perhaps 5 or 6 new machine guns. THough Algren and Katsumoto heroically ride in front and are shot by the guns last, this scene is EXCELLENTLY done as the director dims all sound during hte firing of the guns and accentuates the ease of cranking the new machines, a slow crank to pump 200 rounds per minute. Of course these 1877 war machines were most likely loud and imperfect, but the director portrays the focus of the ease of turning the cranking and mowing down some of the final cultural remains of Japan to symbolize the ease of supporting modernity and the ease of ignoring the previous culture, the ease in going with the flow. Of course, as soon as Katsumoto goes down, even in disregard to the general, the whole modern Japanese army take off their hats and bow to the dead leader, who decided now it IS okay for him to commit suicide, changing back to his tradition. It is Algren's fate to survive every battle he is in, thus he is the ""last samurai,"" the only man left, and there is a clear disappointment when the army bows down instead of allowing his torture to continue. Yet the movie is not over... Algren must talk to the emperor (and this is where it gets really cheesy) and walk in right before the US treaty is signed and give him insight into the Samurai way of life, causing him to reject the treaty and explain that his country could not ignore their heritage. The end of the story is narrated by a Historian of whom i failed to mention earlier, one who is from England and supports the modern side but helps Algren and other Samurai to get Katsumoto to escape. His role is portrayed as unbiased, and he is given Algren's diary and explanations to write a book. Clearly a Romantic movie about non-conformity and fighting for the conservative and traditional values of an antique heritage, the narrator describes how the ""American Captain's"" history after that was a legend, listing some beliefs. The end of the movie portrays Algren walking back to the Samurai town, where on the way (another excellent job) one of the blossoming trees which Katsumoto points out earlier can be seen in the background - not with a multitude of flowers but rather very few; a dying but surviving culture. As he enters the town, Taka sees him and smiles. So for all intensive purposes, this movie would get a B. It is entertaining, there is a hint of suspense, and there is an excellent use of symbols. Yet, the movie tends to make several errors (such as tense scenes where the reactinary Samurai tradition is forfeited easily for a liberal idea, or when there are unbiased intercultural relations) and it tends to go on far too long. I would reccomend paying 9 dollars to see this movie, especially if you don't analyze everything like I do. The movie makes sense, the plot makes sense, but an intellectual may find him or herself occupied in simply enjoying bloody intense fighting as a sacrifice in place of any thought process whatsoever.",1070582400,,7734,4.6875
2009018,5,B0001JXOVC,"Tom Cruise has moved on to greater things these days.  I've been kind of biased with his roles - I will say this - he's a very savvy actor with an eye for a good business opportunity.  Here, however, we see him taking things one step further.  A great film in a year full of shiny, shallow, stinky films.  By virtue of comparison, this really rises to the top.  Good move on Tom's part, great scenes, a plot that floats, a touching upon the way of Samurai and the art of zen.  Great action movie!!!",1070582400,14,498,4.189473684210526
2009019,5,B0001JXOVC,"While no movie is perfect, and all art can be improved, this effort comes pretty close.  More than an action movie, a story of personal redemption, or the saga of a nation in turmoil, it is a blending of all three.  The film blends the the epic and the personal, the external and the internal in masterful fashion.  No movie except Lawrence of Arabia has done it as well.
Cruise does well in his role, but the finest performances come from the Japanese cast.  Ken Watanabe's portrayal of the Samurai leader is timeless; an oscar-lock in the supporting category.  The technical elements of the film are all impecable, but none distracts from the film.  The part never obscurs the whole, the action never eclipses the drama.
This is a film that must be seen, must be experienced.  It takes an immediate place on my all-time list, blending the power of Braveheart with the feeling and morality of The Mission.  A rare and remarkable achievement.",1070409600,31,942,4.701219512195122
