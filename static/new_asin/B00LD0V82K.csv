6479775,5,B00LD0V82K,"ECHO BRIDGE has gotten far away from their roots: the recycling of beat-up antique b&w theatrical films that were reduced to 16mm 60 years ago for TV broadecast, Also, they no longer put a persistent on-screen watermark at the images' lower right hand corner.

As far as I can see on my old 27"" CRT television, quality of their 6 FILM COLLECTION: Movies of Excellence is top shelf, but more important, the films themselves have great entertainment value.

This multi-picture pack that I bought for under four dollars last week at WALMART is the gift that keeps on giving.

I was thoroughly satisfied when ATTICA (TV-1980) turned out to be totally engrossing, that I had definitely gotten my money's worth. Then, RIPPLE EFFECT (2007) came at a perfect moment in my autodidactic efforts. A terrific film.

The former is a telescoped telling of that tragic event so ultimately crucial to the Prisoner Reform Movement.

RIPPLE EFFECT really got me thinking about a lot of things. It's an extremely adult, but not in a prurient way, examination of life and how the things we do can have major impact on the future, sometimes actually for the better when one imagines the total opposite to be true. It's by writer/director Philippe Caland, whose first creepily unforgettable effort was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BOXING-HELENA/dp/B000059H96/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BOXING HELENA</a>&nbsp;(1993).

THE EXECUTION OF RAYMOND GRAHAM (TV-1985) has the unmistakable videotape look of a television soap opera, but the subject matter goes far deeper. A most realistic glimpse at a Death Row inmate, the killer of a teenager during an armed robbery, who quickly goes from apathy to terror while waiting for a fourth stay phone call, and also of his and the victim's families, who are caught up in this depressing saga, all just hoping for the best.

TAKING BACK OUR TOWN (TV-2001) is yet ANOTHER great drama, based on a true story of how a couple of small town women tried to defeat the invasion by an out-of-country conglomerate that's building a toxic chemical plant practically on their doorsteps. One of them, an elderly woman, traveled to Tokyo to confront the board of directors of her faceless enemy. This one has the polish of a large budget Hollywood movie.

Haven't yet seen the other two titles, one of which, is based on a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/James-Baldwin-novel/dp/B00E320TDY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">James Baldwin novel</a>.
It's also, according to IMDb, the best of this small lot. I'm looking forward to it.
The other concerns the secret discussions that eventually brought down South African apartheid.

Overall, this collection is a definite winner.
