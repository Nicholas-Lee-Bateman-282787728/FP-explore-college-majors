And then two things happened. First, I fell hard for the Academic Festival Overture, and began to listen to other works of Brahms with a more open mind. Second, I listened to this course.

I've said before that Professor Greenberg has a knack for sharing his enthusiasm about a composer, and he purely loves Johannes Brahms. He also has a knack for contextualizing composers and their music in terms of not only their life experiences, but historical events and trends as well. And in this case he does a beautiful job of giving us a young Johannes who was set to play piano in Hamburg brothels when he was just a child. A natural musician and composer, a man who was a puzzle even to those closest to him, and a composer who, in holding to the rigorous musical forms of the past while expressing the spirit of German romanticism, produced work that made him the true heir to Beethoven, Mozart, and Bach.

Brahms had issues. His childhood experiences in Hamburg brothels soured him on women, and though he fell in love several times in his life, he never married. Possibly this was as much a result of his mania for freedom which kept him from taking any real jobs for most of his life, as it was the trauma of those early years. But he led what appeared to be a happy, orderly life, had a great many friends in spite of his famously wicked temper and general grumpiness, made a good deal of money, which he then gave away freely, and not incidentally produced some glorious music.

I admit that the professor has some weird verbal tics. He's often over dramatic (You should see one of his video courses!) and a bit goofy, but his information is top notch and I don't think you could do better for clear, concise, and memorable learning experiences on music and music history. His Great Masters series, of which Brahms is one, is reasonably priced through Audible, possibly a bit less so directly from The Great Courses. But so far I consider them well worth the price. In fact, I sometimes find myself thinking longingly of listening to yet another of Greenberg's courses. They're that good.",1514073600,,2254,4.533169533169533
