8699251,5,B00STZ65KC,Was looking for something to show the kids ages  7-12 in Sunday School class. Was doing a search and this came up. Watched Messiah's promise on Amazon prime video. It was very well done with Stevies dialog with kids who will be watching and the time of apprx 30 min is perfect to show the class. I purchased all the dvds since they all lead into the next one for one great visual presentation showing 1 each week in Chronological order so that the class will get a lot of information in the order of the events. Thanks for a job well done good and faithful servant.,1439683200,,565,4.280373831775701
