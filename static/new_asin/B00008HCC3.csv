7984459,5,B00008HCC3,"I first saw this at the Independent Film Festival in Los Angeles, April of 2001. Any story narrated by a talking fish in hell is intriguing, in my book!
It's a tale of mayhem, guilt, fate and redemption. I mustn't give away too much for fear of spoiling the surprise plot twists and turns. All I can say is get it! Watch it and be entertained. This director reminds me of another Lars Van Trier, without the coldheartedness but with much of the dark vision and humor.
It's good for many repeat viewings as well.",1384128000,,511,4.389473684210526
7984460,4,B00008HCC3,"This is probably one of the more original films I've seen in a long while. The director has clearly drawn influence from the Blue White Red trilogy, but that don't take away it's originality or it's power. It's about abortion, death, love, philosophy, and a talking fish. Go figure, one of the greatest films of the year.",1049414400,,321,4.649122807017544
7984461,5,B00008HCC3,"Right, so if you've heard anything about Maelstrom, it was probably ""Yuck/wow/hmmm, it's narrated by a series of fish on the chopping block.""
Yep, it is.  That's not why you should see it, though.
Bibi is a successful fashion designer in Montreal whose personal life is in a shambles; she can't escape from her famous mother's shadow, nor from the shock and guilt of the abortion she has in the first scene of the film.  She gets drunk one night and kills a Norwegian fisherman in a hit-and-run accident.  From that moment, what's left of her life becomes entwined with what's left of his.
Bitterly funny moments abound: the soundtrack in the abortion scene plays ""Good Morning Starshine""; an obnoxious journalist tries to interview an uncooperative (and hungover) Bibi; she very bluntly declares her love (ok, lust) on an airport runway; she is forced to drink to a toast calling for her own disembowellment; her best friend loses track of how many abortions she's had, and unwittingly sings a gory Norwegian battle song as a lullaby . . .
As the list of ""jokes"" may indicate, this is often a very dark film.  But in the end, it goes a long way toward making you think about the nature of fate, life, death, love, and redemption - and in its odd little way, it's quite uplifting.  The cinematography is breathtaking.
And, hey, there's a talking fish.",1038787200,6,1351,4.7076271186440675
7984462,4,B00008HCC3,"Maelstrom earned best film, best director, and best actress in canada for good reason.  Highly imaginative and original, this is a story about life and death. A story about a young woman told by a 'cronenbergesque' fish on a chopping block.",999216000,,240,4.853658536585366
