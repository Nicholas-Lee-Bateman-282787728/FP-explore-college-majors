2643167,5,B000HT3SA8,"I just turned 21 and I'm a junior in college, basically having been through major changes (like girlfriends, and losing touch with old friends) made me extremely nostalgic. I was a little sad but still generally happy but I needed something to tell me I'd be alright. I heard about an old film called 'Going Back' which was essentially about what ever guy goes through after high school. I watched it and thought that it was truley a great film. If you are curious trust me you'll find it charming. Make sure that no one is home and crack open a beer and relax, you have the rest of your life to live.",1018224000,6,601,4.327433628318584
8141397,5,B000HT3SA8,I am a huge Bruce Campbell fan and love anything he is in. I thought his acting was spot on. If he wasn't in this movie I probably wouldn't watch it though unless I was really high on my couch with no remote then I probably would and then in that case I'd rate this 2 stars without Bruce.,1520208000,,288,3.8983050847457625

8141399,4,B000HT3SA8,"Fun look back at the early career of Bruce Campbell. The commentary with Campbell, the Director and cinematographer makes the DVD worth every penny. Excellent experience.",1466553600,3,170,5.576923076923077
8141400,1,B000HT3SA8,"I bought Going Back, because I wanted to go back with Bruce Campbell!  I got my wish, but the movie was not good. It was too short and their reasons for going back were futile!",1458086400,,176,4.0285714285714285
8141401,4,B000HT3SA8,Worth it for any Bruce Campbell fan. He was so young!,1426464000,2,53,3.909090909090909

8141403,4,B000HT3SA8,"For an early movie in Bruce Campbell's career, he did an admirable job in this film.  It started out a bit awkward, and a lot of the dialogue is stilted and seemingly amateurish, but Bruce's performance made this movie.  It made me wish he'd do a few more dramatic roles.",1358035200,3,271,4.4
8141404,3,B000HT3SA8,"The only real reason anyone will see this movie, and let's be honest, is that it stars Bruce Campbell. I think that anyone who argues this fact is simply not playing with a full deck, because if it were not for Bruce, the film would most likely have been forgotten. But it's a good thing that this movie has Bruce in it. It's a good thing that it has been released on DVD, because the film is actually pretty interesting. It has the basic and overused premise of a few friends pre-college who are going on a road trip before heading to college. After a few years at the college, they have separated, become different men who no longer know each other as well. It's a truth that we all face in life. Friends become distanced. The director does a good job with his shoestring budget, but the real gold here is an early role for Bruce Campbell that has absolutely no blood in it. It's a very interesting movie, and I recommend you check it out.",1302048000,6,941,4.322033898305085
8141405,5,B000HT3SA8,"I was born, raised and still live in the exact area this movie was filmed in. To my knowledge, it is the only movie ever filmed here. I originally got this movie simply because it had Campbell in it and it was filmed here. What surprised me is how endearing, well written and genuine it is. It simply is a moive about 2 college kids coming up North and falling in love with the area and some of the people here. They go back home and years later decide to go back and recapture that feeling and it's not there. Everything has changed. Simple concept, but very few movies do it and fewer still do it this well.",1281225600,3,609,4.169491525423729
8141406,5,B000HT3SA8,"I bought this film as  Bruce Campbell fan, but the story is really heartfelt.  I found it to be a great flick about the passage of time and how things change from our youth to adulthood.",1223596800,6,186,4.138888888888889
