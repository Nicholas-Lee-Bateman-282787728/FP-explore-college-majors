8486364,5,B005TLPNCK,"A good product. May have been enhanced by more  rotational images.
Nevertheless, it is effective and the tonal connection complements
the product. Well done.",1345248000,,157,5.541666666666667
8486365,3,B005TLPNCK,"Hi,
I was pleased to receive my ""The Seven Chakras"" DVD.
But disappointed to find that each video clip was no more than 10 minutes long.

This is simply not long enough to experience a full relaxation period.

Also the Disk didn't seem to have an option to play them one after the other..
So this required you to break your concentration and click the next Chakras icon.

I bought this product because of the Youtube advertisement thinking the clips would be longer.
But they are the same short 8 - 10 minutes as on the Youtube Channel.

I could of just watched the same product online for free.

Almost a complete waste of time and money.",1334275200,6,639,4.427350427350428
8486366,5,B005TLPNCK,"Just great. A magnificent treat for video artists, for those looking to meditate deeply, or just for folks looking to simply relax and chill out. Its great to see Ted's work optimized for the the home screen viewing and it works so well in this format. Highly, highly recommended....",1318204800,2,283,4.795918367346939
