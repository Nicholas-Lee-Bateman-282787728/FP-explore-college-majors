2047866,5,B0001ZX0I8,"It is such a shame only these two films available on region 1 since i'd LOVE to see the british T.V series. I see loads of reviews for Blackadder/Faulty Towers/Monty Python etc... almost none for Steptoe and Son. I can only think it is because the word isn't out. And i say if you like ""Are you being Served' you'll like this because its as understandable to an american-no particular need for a feel for british wit to begin with. Yes the script is brilliant (and british wit-say that again-Cockney wit)).But the dynamics  going on between father and son and their characters are funny enough in themselves. Their two essences are very concentrated particularly the father as cantankerous,leacherous,cunning,manipulative versus his compassionate honourable but rebellious(and cunning)son. Humour can be much coarser than the mainstream british comedies mentioned which is kinda fun. So i'll repeat 'Steptoe and Son' is not out there not because its less funny but because the word isn't out...",1186099200,8,994,5.173913043478261
2047867,5,B0001ZX0I8,"A superb sitcom series and my personal all time favourite comedy series. This double feature DVD containing the only two Steptoe movies made, compliments very well the Steptoe series that were made prior to the films. A must have for Steptoe fans and I'm sure that if you aren't a fan, after viewing this DVD, you soon will be.",1161302400,6,327,4.559322033898305
2047868,4,B0001ZX0I8,Loved both of these films. Highly recommended. Both live up to the standard set by the television series.,1154390400,7,105,4.888888888888889
2047869,5,B0001ZX0I8,"I grew watching steptoe and son in the 70's.  Family moved to the USA in 1979 and we always try to track down and keep in touch with t.v. shows that we remember.  Monty Python, Carry on Movies, Fawlty Towers, Benny Hill, etc.  My brother ordered this and frankly, I couldn't really remember much about this t.v. show as I was only 10 when we moved to the USA. My brother watched the first dvd and said it wasn't that great.  He lent me the dvd and I watched the first dvd (it's only one dvd which is double sided).  I didn't think dvd 1 was that great either.  It was ok.. but nothing special.  I still haven't seen the t.v. show it's based on since 1979 so what am I going to say?? nothing.. right..?  My brother didn't watch side two of the dvd..  I however DID..!  and Steoptoe and Son Ride again is totally FANTASTIC!!!!!!  It's rare when a sequel is superior to the first film.  So if you were around in the late 70's in the U.K. this would obviosly be on your list of films to watch.  and to be honest, the only reason I write this review is to let you know that the second dvd in the collection is a great film that will be important to you.  It's Fu**ing great!  and then after watching the second one I grew a special appreciation for the first.  and now they are both great to me.  So watch it ok?  Order this dvd.. make a hot cup of tea..  sit back in you favorite chair and just watch it.. you'll love it.. not a lot of people have rated this film.  fools.",1137974400,9,1468,4.066433566433567
2047870,5,B0001ZX0I8,"I laughed for hours watching this, just as I did years ago when it was first shown in England, brought back many happy memories of my childhood.  A must see!",1127606400,14,157,4.233333333333333
2047871,5,B0001ZX0I8,"One of the earliest britcoms (1962-1974), Steptoe and Son is about a quarrelling father-and-son pair of rag-and-bone men (ie. junk dealers) who barely make ends meet most of the time.  It was the habit in the 70s to make a film version of successful britcoms.  Sometimes it worked; more often than not it didn't.  Steptoe and Son is, at least in my opinion, a shining example of a britcom that made the transition to film beautifully.  Subtitled ""The Cinema Collection"", this dvd contains two 90-minute films, both of which are really well done and contain lots of humorous (and some downright hilarious!) moments.  Personally, I enjoyed both equally as well, and a familiarity with the series and characters is not a prerequisite.  Also, the quality of the picture is very good--especially considering the films were made over 30 years ago.

For those unfamiliar with the series, I recommend watching the earlier film, Steptoe & Son (1972), first as it illustrates in greater depth the relationship between father and son.  In a nutshell, Albert Steptoe is a frail, scrawny, tatty old man with a peg-toothed grin whose humorous appearance is milked to its full comic potential.  But he is a wily, selfish old codger and a master at the art of emotional blackmail.  His son Harold longs for a life of his own, but for all his frustration with his father's abuses, he really is a victim of his own compassion.  He does care about his father and, being incapable of breaking free, is destined to a life of frustration and emotional bondage.  This film sees Harold at long last falling in love and getting married, but with a father like Albert, the marriage cannot be anything short of doomed.  Indeed, the film opens with Albert and Harold arguing about the reasons for his marriage having failed.  The story is then presented in retrospect, coming full circle to end where it begins.  I'll say no more, as I don't wish to give the story away.  I will just mention (lest anyone be offended or wonder about the suitability for children) that there is a scene with a stripper--whose performance is presented in its entirety.  It's probably quite tame by today's standards; still, I thought I ought to mention it.

The second film, Steptoe & Son Ride Again (1973), opens with the Steptoes going through a particularly bad patch financially, but matters only get worse when Harold gets them indebted to a mobster!  Hilarity ensues as the Steptoes try one thing after another and end up taking a very extreme (not to mention risky!) measure in order to get themselves out of debt.  Frank Thornton (Are You Being Served's Captain Peacock) makes a guest appearance near the end.

In conclusion, these two films (and indeed the entire series) hail back to an England and a way of life that is, sadly, gone forever; moreover, they hail back to an era in British comedy that has, also sadly, long since passed.  If you enjoyed the series even a little bit, then this film collection is a must have.  Personally, I enjoyed it every bit as much as the series (and perhaps even a little more!).  If you're unfamiliar with the series but enjoy the types of comedies that Britain put out in the 70s or are a fan of shows like After Henry or Australia's Mother and Son (which also prominently feature a domineering, emotionally blackmailing parent), I really do recommend giving this one a try.  With a mixture of comedy and pathos, these are not gentle, cosy, relaxing films; rather they can be quite loud and abrasive, what with all the bickering, but they are very funny.  And if you find you enjoy the film collection, by all means get the episodes from the series that are available on video.

Highly recommended!",1105056000,29,3701,4.7421875
2047872,5,B0001ZX0I8,"I was so glad to find both of these classic movies on one DVD.  If you are a fan of British comedy this is a MUST.  I grew up in London with Steptoe and Son and loved it.  I think American viewers may find it a little tough to understand as they use a lot of rhyming slang as well as british coloquialisms.  Still, great fun though and a true tribute to the real rag and bone men I remember.",1101254400,20,391,3.85

I had to buy a special DVD player for him to watch them on, but it didn't cost much.  It was the perfect Christmas present.",1422835200,,256,4.3125
8019122,4,B0001ZX0I8,"I first watched this series on television years a go when I was quite young,

I'm now 60yo and I guess life changes a lot in that time,

I remember thinking it was quite funny at the time that's why I bought the series,

Watching it now realise it has a comical front but an underling desperation which is real life for some people even in this day and age,
this is not a comedy as such but more like a reality check,
and it makes you realise we should be happy for what we have now, things could be worse.

Please don't let this review put you off buying this it's defiantly worth getting for the great acting and sense of tongue in cheek humour all be it somewhat dark.",1383436800,,671,4.099236641221374

8019127,5,B0001ZX0I8,"A wonderful double bill on this DVD: Steptoe and Son & Steptoe and Son Ride Again.  Theatrical outing with stars of the original british comedy series.  The chemistry between Albert & Harold is remarkable!

The DVD is also in widescreen format which is another reason for getting this DVD.

I've had the video set of the series from BHS who were its distributors when it had been released to vhs & I'm now transferring the shows on the tapes to DVD(s).  It'll have to due until someone with a pulse digs this out of the vault & realizes there are a good many fans of british comedy who appreciate its humo*u*r & this series & give us the complete show on DVD.  A good place to cast your vote is over at the TVShowsOnDVD site.  That's a great way to get the ball rolling.  Nothing happens overnight, but it is a good start!

I Highly recommend the Steptoe films & television series to fans of old school british sitcoms of the '60s & '70s.",1212364800,7,938,4.344827586206897
