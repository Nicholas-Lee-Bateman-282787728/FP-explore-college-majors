6074193,5,B00GE9ZVOQ,"It revealed the link between the housing crash of 2008, big government, big oil, and one man's incredible journey. Even the 1% should watch this. If you like fair political documentaries then put this at the top of your list!",1390348800,5,225,4.65
6074194,5,B00GE9ZVOQ,I am so glad I rented this.  It is an entertaining way to get the information about our economy across to all viewers.  It gives a very human experience.  I highly recommend that you watch it!,1390953600,2,192,4.277777777777778
6074195,4,B00GE9ZVOQ,"I've never been in position to have had my mortgage sold to someone else and then someone else and then.....and i'm sort of glad after hearing some of the accounts in this film of how people had their homes taken from them.  I must admit, i'm partial to believe the power and authority of the US government is run by corporations, greed, me me me so I am not at all surprised something like this would happen in America to millions of people.

This account of a man who had a home (a pretty penny of a mortgage), a family and a career lost will leave you sitting back thinking..""could this happen to me?""  The answer is yes unless you, alongside US, do something about it.  And Forward 13 might bring the emotional force to swing the teeter totter in the direction to stand up.",1390867200,,777,4.337931034482758
6074196,5,B00GE9ZVOQ,"I had the privilege of being at the first screening in Park City, Utah of this documentary.  I consider myself lucky that I was able to see it with Patrick and his wife in the house.

Amazed, inspired, scared and awed me! SO glad I saw your work. Honest to the core! You bet I am thinking differently now then I did 24 hours ago. And that is the point, right? Your purpose and passion is making a difference in this world. From one  person to a whole nation. It took so much courage and guts to leave your family, then to travel the nation finding out WHY?
Why on earth big business can own our government and buy our legislators!  From the moment I sat down I was memorized by what was on the screen. How did this all happen?  Will it happen again........... if you watch this and share perhaps we can stop the next wave.  If you watch this movie you can never not know.
Knowledge is power my friends.  Watch and learn!",1390608000,5,920,4.193181818181818
6074197,4,B00GE9ZVOQ,"If you or someone you know got caught in the economic ""downturn"" of 2008, you'll love this film by Patrick S. Lovell. He tells his own story against the backdrop of widespread corruption and an urgent grassroots need for change. Forward 13 is a call to return to our foundational ideals and preserve the American dream for our children.

Patrick got caught off guard and slammed pretty hard.  What I love about this film is Patrick's desire to figure out what happened and take us all along for the ride.  A critic said Patrick was naive.  Perhaps.  But we all are.  We've all been raised on the ""American dream"" myth and what Patrick uncovers is that it's utterly false and unsustainable.

My favorite part is the conversations he has with visionaries who see ways to save our economic base with sustainable solutions.  We can no longer do business as usual.  Patrick has created a great conversation starter on what we can do going forward.  We can get back to our founding ideals (for real) and think about a future that won't bankrupt us all.",1390608000,2,1046,4.635869565217392
6074198,5,B00GE9ZVOQ,"I chose this rating because I appreciate the work that went into this film, the goal behind it, and the way in which vast amounts of information were condensed for the layperson.  Patrick Lovell may be viewed as a little too personal in this film, but he lays it on the line in order to inform the rest of us; the American people. No one has yet bothered, until now, to explain why and how our U.S. government and banking system (overrun by a greedy minority) operate in covert ways. And so I appreciate that Patrick, having the skill and inspiration to create any number of wonderful films, chose to address a topic of import that pervades our American society.  The year 2008 revealed insane greed among U.S. banking families and the government elites who bathe in power.  This is the year 2014 and our U.S. government no longer represents the people. I am inspired by Patrick Lovell's film to man the helm in a more personal way to make a better U.S.of A.  I have the power to vote. We each have the power of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Let's not forget that.  Watch this film and wake up America!",1390608000,,1117,4.455882352941177
6074199,5,B00GE9ZVOQ,"I thought this film was a fantastic look into the way that our economy has changed in one man's lifetime. What used to be easy, isn't so much anymore. Buying a home, providing for your family, starting your own business... they take more than hard work these days. I also appreciated the many experts that were interviewed for this film and love seeing the resolve to move forward, no matter what.",1390521600,,397,4.605633802816901
6074200,1,B00GE9ZVOQ,"Finished watching this on Hulu thinking this was an in depth look at how banks screwed the American public and how we should've been more cautious signing documents we don't understand. Nope. Got an hour forty five minute pity party with holes big enough to suck up entire galaxies. Claiming to be a regular Joe Shmo, he admits to growing up middle class in a nice, happy, homogenous, family moving on to bumming around the mountains and going to college. Read: Sheltered. He says ""following college.."" Did he not graduate? Dad was an attorney. Ok. Doesn't him being an attorney totally kill the integrity of this film in a way? Moving on. Grandad says ""you can be what you want if you work for it"", cut to this guy moving to Hollywood. What happened to being an attorney? He wants to be a producer. Ok. But he didn't go to college for any film degree. In the mean time the film cuts to photos (uploaded from a Blackberry) of him doing things 20 years later (??). ""Life led me back to Utah"" nice way of saying cut and run? (photos of him bumming around again) Hooked up with a girl and ""When SHE brought HER son into the world..."" What? Is Patrick not related to this kid? (bumming around) Still waiting to see this hardcore work ethic (and some info of what he was doing for a living around this time would've been..insightful). BS fortune cookie philosophy ensues. ""Like the founding fathers, I...."" Really. You did not compare yourself to the founding fathers. Moving swiftly along, him and the wife are making ""good money"" (once again not telling us what hes been doing for 15-20 years) and decide to buy a house. He doesn't tell us the price to this house and actually asked the mortgage broker ""how this happened so easily?"" This guy is pushing (or over) 40 and he doesn't know this? Or much less have the 20% down?? ""I had to no idea at the time what that meant.."" And who's fault is that? (photos of him BUILDING a house..interesting) Now he's deciding to start his own business. Doing what??? 2008 comes and he failed his family and is moving out? I must've blinked cause I missed something here. Umm....why? (bumming around crying at grandpas grave) Patrick and his wife get 2 jobs each. Not really understanding why since they no longer have the house. ""I was so preoccupied with my own trauma, I thought we were the only ones going through this."" I believe you believed that. Come to find out, you kept your house. Whoa. What? You showed clips of someone moving out, foreclosure signs and going on about failing everyone. They STOPPED paying the bank and they got a trial modification. So...the bank gave you another chance. They didn't immediately foreclose on the house...like they did to the other millions of people who Patrick thinks he identifies with. Somehow they screw this up for 9 months and the bank has had enough. The wife slips and lets us know their mortgage was $2600!! WTF. HOW MUCH WAS THIS HOUSE?? These two are convinced banks are there to ""help you out"" lol These two then proceed to blame the bank in any way they can. And then America. America is to blame. But Patrick still has dreams dammit. To hell with reality. (bumming around with random guy) Now he's gonna be a filmmaker and take his straight white christian middle class male message to the poor masses. (bumming around with random guy for two months) I'd like to know whos taking care of his wife and kid in this time... Some overweight ex-frat guy makes a statement I'm surprised Patrick included in the film....since it demolishes the entire concept of the film. ""I had to pay that price...and that's ok. I reaped the benefit of what I did right and I paid the price of what I did wrong."" Exactly. He didn't bum around making crap documentaries about his bad choices.
Patrick is not relatable. He was given every shot at life living a charmed existence whilst making crappy decisions and it caught up with him. Something he should've stopped and considered while taking selfies skiing on his Blackberry thinking he was a badass. And even then continues making bad choices making this film. Its an insult to Occupy and to anyone who who has made WISE choices...and yet continues to struggle. Patrick needs to quit bumming around and take responsibility. Decent editing tho.",1390521600,9,4270,4.627140974967062
6074201,5,B00GE9ZVOQ,"Millions of us were affected in many ways by the housing boom and crash. This film takes it a step further in telling the story in how, why and what. Great story telling and compiling of the news stories and facts. It was compelling to hear from industry experts who have a deep knowledge base and perspective. This film takes a slew of complex facts and organizes it in a story that we can all understand and relate to. This is a must watch!!",1390435200,2,443,4.285714285714286
6074202,5,B00GE9ZVOQ,"In the past few years, Documentary Film has become a very accessible, entertaining and powerful way of going more deeply into social, political and economic issues.  This film is destined to join the ranks of other great documentaries such as Food, Inc. and Inside Job, as it puts a very personal face on the suffering of millions of Americans as a result of the Financial and Housing Crisis that struck in 2008.

The film does an excellent job of blending factual data and graphic illustrations with the arc of an everyday guy from Utah losing everything, discovering that he was not alone, and shifting his own pursuit of the American Dream into an effort to expose the Corrupting Force of Money in Politics, the Revolving Door between Washington, Wall Street and Big Energy, and the dangers of growing inequality and political disenfranchisement.  The beauty of the film is that the story ends with this guy still believing in the American Dream, despite all the powerful forces actively working to destroy it for most people, and who nearly destroyed it for him and his family.  The film is ultimately uplifting and hopeful, rather than just another expose on what is wrong, with no real ideas or solutions to present.

This was 90 minutes incredibly well spent, and the ideas expressed in the film are relevant to all of us, and especially those who suffered in any way as a result of the financial turmoil of the past few years.  It will be interesting to see what the filmmaker does to follow this up, and whether the millions of Americans that comprise a silent majority that has no voice in Washington, and has been run over by the greed and arrogance of so many of our industries, can band together into a cohesive movement to change the nature of our political discourse and institutions.",1390435200,7,1799,4.75
6074203,5,B00GE9ZVOQ,"Easy for even the non-political types, such as myself, to follow and understand the financial crisis in our country and the struggles of those trying to pursue the American dream.",1390348800,,179,5.0
8622436,2,B00GE9ZVOQ,"Disappointing; I expected better from all the positive reviews.  I thought this film more showcased the subject's reckless and irresponsible decision making (he brags about being shocked at being able to take out a signature loan for a $2500+ mortgage with no asset verification, can't pay it when he loses his job, and we're supposed to feel sorry for him?).  This guy KNEW what he was doing, and did it anyway.  The financial meltdown was a horrific example of greed and the worst excesses of a predatory and out-of-control financial system, and there were for sure lots and lots of victims.  This film, unfortunately, didn't demonstrate many good examples of that.  There are much better choices out there.",1451865600,,709,4.97457627118644
8622437,1,B00GE9ZVOQ,"""Bashing Capitalism"" should be the title of this documentary.  Who invented and manufactured Patrick's Blackberry?  Obviously it was not him if he couldn't understand a mortgage contract.  Umm...so who SHOULD make the profit from the sale of his Blackberry...him?  The twenty-year-old girl who just gave birth to her third child and has no idea who the father of any one of them is?  Maybe it should be the thirty-two-year-old man who dropped out of high school and trades his welfare benefits for illegal drugs, forcing the woman he lives with to make weekly trips to the food bank, while relying on the school system to provide taxpayer funded lunches for his children...just asking.  I realize this sounds cynical, but understand I held a position in the social work field for five years, eventually resigning out of frustration.  I saw these cases up close and personal.  Oh, there is greed in the world, absolutely, both at the top AND the bottom.  From the Wall Street CFO and his three multi-million dollar homes down to the Section Eight housing recipient who has never held a paying job but wants a free cell phone, greed runs rampant.  It's the middle-class that's being squeezed into non-existence with taxes to support this greediness.  As it was once famously said, ""...the trouble with Socialism is that eventually the government runs out of other people's money.  And make no mistake, a Socialistic Government is Patrick's not so hidden agenda in this documentary for all the ills in the U.S.  Take no responsibility for your own actions.  Then if you fail, let someone else rescue you...the government (i.e. the taxpayer.)",1451692800,3,1638,4.974264705882353

He did a good job laying out what happened to this country in the last 15 years and what led to our financial destruction.  Deals with the greed behind it, how we got Citizens United, and how it finished the theft of our elected officials and our votes by Corporations, the Kochs, and our beleaguered poor and middle class' failure to use our votes to rid ourselves of our Representatives who don't represent us.",1401580800,,546,4.913043478260869

Forward 13 is more than just evoking empathy for those blindsided by the 2008 economic downturn, it is about removing self-imposed veils of ignorance to reveal the shocking truth behind how and why it ever happened in the first place. On a mission to learn and understand, while refusing to abandon his faith in the American Dream, Lovell uncovers a history of blatant corruption and unfettered greed that has been hiding in plain sight for decades. Unlike other documentaries covering similar topics, Lovells story is one of hope, empowering us with applicable knowledge and a genuine desire to take action toward meaningful change.
