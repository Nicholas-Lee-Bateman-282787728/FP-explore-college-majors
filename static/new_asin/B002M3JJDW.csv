3950837,5,B002M3JJDW,"Information + humor.  A pretty wide variety of weapons is covered: for example, helicopters get an episode, pre-gunpowder weapons get an episode, and machine guns get two episodes. I hope there's a second season.",1280793600,,212,5.235294117647059
3950838,5,B002M3JJDW,"R. Lee Ermey comes through again!  A very informative visual aid to guns, ammo and all things that go bang!  A good companaion piece to the History Channel's Mail Call.",1279065600,,168,4.566666666666666
3950839,5,B002M3JJDW,"Good, light-hearted history of armaments throughout the ages. Even though it isn't a serious, determined history I still felt it was informative and gave a good overview of weaponry from differing eras. The so-called tests aren't scientific but R. Lee Ermey puts them across in a way that resonates with the common man. ""That thing hits harder"", or ""this is faster therefore better"" aren't expressions that the more 'data' minded would like but they tell it as it is and that's good.
Overall a good watch. Informative without the technical clutter. Nice, easy watching.",1277424000,,569,5.0638297872340425
3950840,4,B002M3JJDW,"I want this guys job as a tv host for badass shows like this!!  Where the hell do I sign up?  Anyway, the Gunny provides some good education on some big guns and the history of said guns most non-infantry (or non-military if youve never served) people wouldnt know about.  Awesome show.",1275868800,,286,4.461538461538462
3950841,5,B002M3JJDW,This set is very informative from a great narrator and Marine. The episodes are good and I can't wait for his new season to come out.,1272067200,,133,4.153846153846154
3950842,5,B002M3JJDW,"Interesting information for everyone (you don't have be any particular type) presented at its entertaining best.  Weapons -  and other components of ordnance designed to ensure their delivery and effectiveness - are a fact of life and denying their existence is as futile as all other forms of blinkered denial.  R. Lee Ermey's enthusiastic presentations nicely intereweave how history has generated needs for weapons of defence/offence and how technology has evolved to meet those needs.  It is a sheer delight for those who appreciate the aesthetics of form following function in weapons manufacture and beautifully augmented by superior computer graphic images of the internal mechanisms and explanations in plain, but not patronising, terms of the mysteries of Ballistics and  Trajectory in the continuum of Target Identification, Acquistion, Engagement and Effect.  This is not simply a ""Gun"" show.  I have become a fan of the Gunnery Sergeant and any who are unable to relate to the show's content and his style are unlikely to read this anyway.  No problem! Semper Fi! Carry on! (PS: I hate melons - water-melons - too.)",1271203200,2,1127,5.222222222222222
3950843,5,B002M3JJDW,"This is not some actor playing a role; Ermey is the real deal.

When this old guy spoke about some people doubting the stories of one man firing a water cooled machine gun that was supposed to take a four man crew, he made his point in a very convincing way.  He walked over, picked the machine gun UP, and blazed away at the target with it.

Don't mess with Ermey.
He is for real.

And the information in Lock and Load is really great!  Historical, topical, up-to-date, accurate and entertaining.
What more could anyone aski for?",1268697600,13,530,4.422680412371134
3950844,5,B002M3JJDW,"Wow!  If R. Lee Ermey wants to retire, sign me up!  What a great job-just running around acting crazy and shooting off reallllly big boom sticks!  Did I mention that he gets paid too!
The gunny- direct from History Channel's ""Mail Call""- presents the first season of ""Lock N' Load"" complete with no commercials.  This big hit from the History Channel is a must view for anyone interested in firearms and military technology.
It comes packaged in a tidy four disc unit in a format that actually does not allow the discs to fall out on the floor, an apparent technological breakthrough.  Great!
Provides historical data without being boring, with animated graphics to demonstrate functions from really primitive firearms to the latest explosive delivery system.
Buy this set, and watch R. Lee blow stuff up! Enjoy.",1267315200,10,812,4.9411764705882355
3950845,5,B002M3JJDW,"Even though I have not bought the DVD season set, I've seen some of the shows on tv.  I think they are great. Not only are they very descriptive, they are also entertaining!  He goes in depth and shows slow motion and cut aways and all the stuff you would need to see in order to learn how a gun, tank or whatever he is using works. It really helped me learn about the different parts of a gun.  It also is fun to watch when he tries them out.  For example, in the machine gun show, he tries to cut down trees with one or shoot a letter G in a wall with another.  He goes in order from the very first gun of that kind all the way to the latest.  In the machine gun one he starts out with the gatling gun and ends with some rapid fire chain gun on top of a humvee.  In the pistol show, he starts out with one from the 1500s where you have to crank it up every time and ends with a Glock pistol that can switch from semi-auto to auto.  I think they're pretty cool and if you like guns, tanks, or anything to do with war, you'll probably like this show.",1257120000,8,1050,3.8738317757009346
3950856,5,B002M3JJDW,Best series by The Gunny!,1432944000,,25,4.2
3950857,5,B002M3JJDW,"Gunny truly rocks in this series, unleashing his artistic genius on enemy canvas (shooting paint balloons), gumball machines, water melons, cow bones and canned vegetables seemingly without mercy using every modern weapon known to man. Each video handles a specific topic, like shotguns (my favorite) and starts with the early history right through to the state of the art equipment. I believe this series was the predecessor to Top Shot, which is basically the same show with the historic evolution element replaced with the reality show competition (if you liked Top Shot buying this series is a no brainer). This video series really needs to be released in Blue Ray (are you listening History Channel?), it was also broadcasted in an HD version on cable which is much more entertaining (especially when they replay all the shots in slow motion, the colors really pop). I still refuse to delete the previously broadcasted episodes from our HD TiVo considering. A must have video collection for any historic or modern day firearm enthusiast.

3950892,5,B002M3JJDW,"It's hard not to be envious of Gunny, as he travels all over, explore the history of ancient and modern weapons, from tanks to full-auto shotguns....and then gets to use them!  I think that is what makes this show partially so successful, is that while many documentary shows on weapons (and other things for that matter) highlight the history, they almost never show them live-firing, the true test of what they are capable of. Chances are, if it's featured in the show, it is used, even hundreds of years old weapons.  It's like the classic car that stays in a garage, never driven...if you've got it,  use it!  The private owners of these weapons are an eclectic bunch, and it's cool to get a glimpse into the various subcultures of collectors such as tank owners.

Of course, the main reason the show hits it out of the park is Gunny. He's genuinely enthusiastic, humorous but serious as well, appreciative of the historical value and power of the weapons (like a kid in a candy store), and at the end of the day, a capable host, by which I mean effective on all levels.  It's one thing for a host to talk about a gun - it's another for him to pick up a foreign or ancient weapon and shoot tight groups at decent ranges. Gunny is the real deal, and while sometimes the zaniness is turned up to 11, knowing that he is going to hip fire a tripod mounted machine gun or full-auto unload an M16 (not to mention hit a target with a smooth bore musket at 50 yards) gives him all the credibility a host needs.

That, and he positively scares the crap out of just about everyone else on the show. From mousey collectors, who are clearly nervous, to trained professionals who always defer to him, to even military who outrank him but clearly give him reverence, he commands that type of respect that you can only get by being genuinely who you are.  This is what ultimately makes the show so good, and makes it even more unfortunate that one season is all we got.",1325721600,2,1958,4.419444444444444
3950893,1,B002M3JJDW,"Of all the weapons named, not a single foot note or referance to more information. Some don't even state the manufacturer! Not worth the money when it's in re-runs!",1306713600,,164,4.689655172413793
3950894,5,B002M3JJDW,"Tried forever to find the episode of the M-16 vs. Ak-47 for my cousin who fought in the Vietnam war. Turns out the History Channel doesn't sell that individual episode, but does sell Season One for somewhat more. So this was a great gift for him, he enjoyed watching that episode as well as all the others. If your into war machines this make a pretty good present.",1301184000,2,365,4.382352941176471
