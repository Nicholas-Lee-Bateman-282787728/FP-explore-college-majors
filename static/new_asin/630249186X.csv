472646,5,630249186X,"Edmond O'Brien made several fine Westerns for Paramount Pictures prior to his epochal role in THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE. DENVER & RIO GRANDE may be his best outing until that 1962 classic. Starring O'Brien and Sterling Hayden, DENVER & RIO GRANDE is a classic railroad film, one of the best ever made, with a spectacular crash that even today is considered amazing. The film is beautifully shot in Technicolor, with an excellent cast, solid plot and action, and great production values. Although Paramount Pictures tended to make fewer Westerns than other studios in the 1950s, the ones it did make---with Charlton Heston, Alan Ladd, John Payne, and O'Brien---were always superior, no expense spared.  DENVER & RIO GRANDE is very entertaining and repays re-watching.

Olive Films has been licensing and releasing a number of Paramount Westerns, including SILVER CITY (with O'Brien), PONY EXPRESS (with Heston), THE JAYHAWKERS (with Jeff Chandler and Fess Parker), RUN FOR COVER (Jimmy Cagney' best of his three Westerns), THE NIGHT OF THE GRIZZLY (with Fess Parker) and THE HANGMAN (with Robert Taylor). Let's hope that this very fine series of releases will continue with such excellent Westerns as WARPATH (also with O'Brien) and FLAMING FEATHER (with Sterling Hayden), both superior entertainment and in need of the professional release that Olive Films can give them.

Highly recommended.",1339113600,18,1399,5.292792792792793
472647,5,630249186X,"Pop your popcorn and settle in for a 1950's-style Matinee Western that from an acting point of view is just barely a B-movie, but railroad enthusiasts will watch this VHS over and over again.

The true stars of this flick are the old Denver & Rio Grande narrow gauge from Durango to Silverton, and the Colorado scenery.  Rio Grande enthusiasts will also be totally intrigued by the rare opening footage of Rio Grande ALCO PA's in silver paint for CZ duty, and many FT and F3 covered wagons still in black paint fresh from the EMD factory erecting floors.  There is even a short cab ride through Glenwood Canyon, and an interesting long shot at Dotsero.

Engines 268 and 315 are in bumble bee makeup, and while the story line is both campy and corny, the many action shots of these fine machines are truly outstanding.  There are also great shots around the yards in both Durango and Silverton, as well at Hermosa bridge.

If you love the Rio Grande, and the Colorado mountains it ran through, you will love this movie!  I would give it 5 thumbs up, if I had that many.

472648,3,630249186X,"On the VHS they recorded it super long play using a small amount of tape. This ruined the beautiful Technicolor. Still worth buying for the price, or cheaper, unless they redo it another way. Sound was not ruined. Picture clear enough to watch, but the details, such as leaves blowing in the wind, and the overall brillance of technicolor do not show through like they should.",994550400,2,376,4.712121212121212
472649,4,630249186X,"This film is about the rivalry between two railroads to build a route through the Rocky Mountains.

472650,3,630249186X,"it is dynamite enhanced as every car explodes in a fire ball just after  the locomotives touch. It's neat but not believable. The story line overall  is fair to fairly good. If you're a rail fan or like dramatized history,  this is a good show. There's great footage at the beginning of vintage  diesels and passenger trains running through the mountains.

472945,5,630249186X,"Yes a fun video to watch.  The story is a bit exagerated, but the filming of the Denver & Rio Grand Western trains on the Silverton Branch in south western Colorado steals the show.  The views are as beautiful to today from the Durango & Silverton tourist train as they were in the days the film was made.

473129,3,630249186X,"The story is very loosely based on the actual conflict between the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad and the Santa Fe Railroad over the right-of-way through the Royal Gorge in Colorado.  The train sequences were filmed using the Durango & Silverton railroad which made the scenery unlike the actual scenery at the Royal Gorge (which is near Canon City).  It broke my heart to see the studio wreck two narrow-gauge engines by ramming them together head-on.  It did make for a spectacular scene, though.  The costuming was typical B-western and not authentic to the period of the 1870s.  I enjoyed the photography and the train sequences and feel thiese are the film's main assets.  Don't watch it with the idea that you will learn anything about the ""war"" between the D&RG and the Santa Fe over the Royal Gorge.",1375142400,2,805,4.755395683453237
473130,5,630249186X,I used to watch this on TBS back when they showed classic movies before TCM. These are the type of movies I have been waiting for on blu-ray and it doesn't disappoint comparing to what it used to look like on broadcast television. I won't give any extended review except to just say that it was worth the price for a good old-fashioned oater and I look forward to purchasing many more for my library. The scenery was gorgeous and there was plenty of action all of which was deftly handled by director Byron Haskin.,1372723200,3,514,4.421052631578948
473131,4,630249186X,"I have seen this movie and wanted to own it and add to my collection.

473133,4,630249186X,The history is a bit dodgey and there is a fair amount of 'corn' included but  generally the story-line holds up well. The digitization of this film confirms it a classic of the western railway genre.,1353974400,,200,4.555555555555555

The history of that railroad is well documented and the DVD follows most accurately the difficulties portrayed in the movie. It was sure great to see it on DVD since I do have it in VHS format.

473138,4,630249186X,"Edmond O'Brien was always good.  At his worst he was good, at his best he was great.  In Denver & Rio Grande he's somewhere in the middle.  The movie, directed by Byron Haskin, is always entertaining, and always holds your attention.  It's got a fair amount of action, and that's well played.  It also has a solid plot and some good characters.  The cast is good from top to bottom, and the location footage is really nice.

Olive Films' Blu Ray release of Denver & Rio Grande is solid as well.  There are a few shots that are soft, but most of them are fairly crisp and clean.  There are a few instances where there is a lot of dust and debris on the print, but that doesn't happen too often.  This is a solid encoding of a good (but not great) print.  Both the picture and sound are very good for a film from 1952.

If you like Westerns or movies about railroads do not hesitate to buy this blu ray.  It's a fun movie and a very good blu ray release.",1341878400,4,952,4.136612021857924
