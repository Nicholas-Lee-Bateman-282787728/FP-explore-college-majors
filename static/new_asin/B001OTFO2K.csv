8361771,5,B001OTFO2K,"As a Revolutionary War buff, I looked forward to watching this mini-series. I wasn't disappointed. Given the constraints of a made for TV production, it was a very good presentation and did a ine job of transporting the viewer to the time of the American Revolution. The entire cast turned in excellent performances. Barry Bostwick and Patty Duke were very believable as George and Martha. Lloyd Bridges added a touch of humor as the scout Caleb Quinn, James Mason was the imperious General Braddock, Jaclyn Smith was beautiful and just a trifle seductive as Sally Fairfax and John Glover was excellent as the mercurial Gen'l. Charles Lee.
The series was generally faithfull to history including episodes such as Washington's altercation with Alexander Hamilton and his angry rebuke of Gen'l. Lee at the battle of Monmouth, that may not be familiar to some viewers.
On the negative side, I thought too much was made of Washington's infatuation with Sally Fairfax and the conversation with Washington and his staff involving Gen'l. John Stark, played by Robert Stack, was historically inaccurate. There was also an occasional tendency, as with many historical dramatizations, to teach history through the characters' conversations.
The series covering the war was followed by another covering Washington's presidentcy. It lived up to the standard set by the first production and I would recommend it also.",1371686400,,1404,5.2444444444444445
