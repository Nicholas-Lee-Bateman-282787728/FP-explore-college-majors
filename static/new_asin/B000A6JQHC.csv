2365395,5,B000A6JQHC,Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing in this vampire movie. This is an average film for these 2 and that;s ok for me,1341792000,,113,4.181818181818182
2365396,5,B000A6JQHC,"This is a must have for Cushing and Lee fans. I don't agree this is better than House of Long Shadows and not as good as The Wicker
Man which Lee stars in alone. But it's a lot like the Wicker Man except it's more of just a mystery movie than horror and a few scenes
kinda of slow it down but whenever Cushing or Lee is on the screen the movie never gets boring and the ending is very good.",1325030400,19,390,3.8271604938271606
2365397,3,B000A6JQHC,"This is a film I had not seen until I ordered it from Amazon. It is not the best film by Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee. but it is definitely not the worst.
Nothing but the Night is more of an occult mystery story. Lee and Cushing are both involved in the investigation of several murders the story evolves from these killings. It has a solid premise and the two stars equate themselves quite well as always.
I definetly recommend the movie for Hammer horror fans and fans of Lee and Cushing. I enjoyed the film and will be viewing it again in the near future.
The transfer is good on this dvd and the sound was what one should expect from a film made in the 70's on a budget.
The price is reasonable at under $15. Give it a try as it was Chris Lee's attempt to set up his own production company. The company may not have done any more movies but it did well with this one it is a good film.",1320364800,57,894,4.0852272727272725

2365429,4,B000A6JQHC,"Can't go wrong with both Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, and this is well worth seeing. The story is a bit slow, but is filled with murder, fog, a beautiful black cat, and old manor homes filled with candelabrae. And terrifying British teeth. Are there no dentists in the UK? It is fun to see the old cars and strange, awful women's fashions, too. Lee and Cushing carry the plot and I just wish their talents were better used during their lives. Thank goodness for the Hammer films for their legacy. You will enjoy the bonfires and cliff jumping, for sure.",1451779200,,559,4.544554455445544
2365430,4,B000A6JQHC,It is unusual to see Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing both working together and both not at odds with each other. This is a good thriller and never boring. Good solid acting throughout. Give it a look and you won't be sorry.,1451088000,,225,4.380952380952381
2365431,3,B000A6JQHC,"This was a pretty good movie, but I am partial to any movie with Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing in it.  The concept was unique regarding reincarnation into children.  The Diana Dors, character was pretty vile and her crawling through the countryside in mud and eating on the run did not endear her character to me.  I have seen this movie twice and would see it again.",1448236800,,371,4.507462686567164

2365438,2,B000A6JQHC,"As expected, the movie was dated in every aspect.  I enjoy the nostalgic feel when watching 70's horror films, so in this respect, it was okay.",1426723200,,143,4.5
2365449,4,B000A6JQHC,"Fun movie reminiscent of The Wicker Man ... always fun to see Lee and Cushing acting off of each other. And the kids - especially the lead girl - are excellent. And it does build some suspense as the storyline plays out - and keeps you guessing until the climax. My only negative comment is the poor use of Diana Dors and her character. While she starts out great, her character almost becomes comical and insignificant - which you're lead to believe she is a critical character when she first appears. I found myself laughing at times at her during the latter part. And I love Diana Dors but feel she was wasted in this movie. But overall - fun and very much a movie of it's time. If you view it from that perception - all is good.",1425254400,2,732,4.273381294964029

2365451,5,B000A6JQHC,"Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing two of my horror favs star and Diana Dors another favorite of mine playing Ana Harb mother of Mary a troubled young girl. This is a brilliant film and masterpiece the plot is outstanding with plenty of twists and turns throughout there is also plenty of suspense drama and some horror as well. . The reason I'm not going into a detailed review is because there are already so many, but I will say this it is a wonderful old movie and a timeless classic",1423008000,,486,4.411111111111111

2365453,5,B000A6JQHC,I bought this because I heard it was pretty good. Not every Cushing and Lee film can be great but there are usually pretty good. Both give strong acting performances in this film as usual. The story was interesting and entertaining. It was a little slow to get into but it was one of the more exciting and greatest endings to a film I've seen in a long time. If you like Cushing and Lee you will like this film. I thought all the child actors in the film gave great performances. All the supporting characters were good. It was a good mystery movie that keeps you guessing and keeps you engaged. I recommend for rental first. Cheers and enjoy!,1420329600,,643,4.366666666666666
2365454,2,B000A6JQHC,"Not one if the best Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing movie I've seen. The main characters acting is on par but the story falls short. The climax is disappointing as well. Was not worth the wait.

2365456,5,B000A6JQHC,This is one fine movie. The best of Christopher Lee. As for that matter all the main players acting is very good. This is a movie that keeps you on the edge of your chair from start to finish and what an ending. The movie is far better than the ad and that almost never happens. The plot does not come full circle until near the end and it is nothing like you are expecting. A great movie. The picture and sound is as good as you are going to fine.,1414800000,,448,3.934065934065934

2365489,4,B000A6JQHC,"This is not a Hammer Film although it stars Hammer regulars Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing and was directed by Hammer regular Peter Sasdy. This is actually a murder mystery with supernatural undertomes where Lee is the Inspector in charge of solving a series of brutal murders with the help of hospital pathologist Cushing. Even though it is rated PG, don't let that fool you, because it's a 70's PG, where adult films with plenty of blood and a hint of nudity were allowed. I'll let you uncover the murder mystery on your own, but this superior DVD from Scorpion Releasing in its original OAR is the best way to experience the film. Try it. You'll like it!",1396915200,7,660,4.601694915254237
2365490,5,B000A6JQHC,"I was very pleased when I saw this movie. I love the older Hammer and Amicus films with Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing. I will watch just about anything with that duo in it.

Enter Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee as Doctor Mark Ashley and Colonel Charles Bingham respectively. They team up in an attempt to get to the bottom of the deaths. After another murder, a prostitute w/ a violent past is the prime suspect. Her daughter, Mary, now in an orphanage, witnessed two of the murders. Now, mum will stop at nothing to get to Mary. More murders occur when 5 orphanage trustees are blown up! In fact, all of the victims were trustees. That is, until one of the orphans is found dead.

2365494,5,B000A6JQHC,"The opening murders are really well filmed. I was enjoying the film but then (SPOILER HINT) they followed the main suspect for way too long, but the story was redeemed with some clever red herring action and bam! what an ending!",1375315200,3,228,4.585365853658536

2365497,4,B000A6JQHC,This film had a confusing plot line especially at the end.  Lee and Cushing in straight roles (somewhat disappointing). Chubby Diana Dors past her prime in a dumb red wig.,1356220800,,171,4.7
2365498,2,B000A6JQHC,"Starring Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing, it's not surprising that 1973's Nothing But the Night was the only film made by the production company set up by Lee and veteran Hammer producer Anthony Nelson Keys to try to inject some new life into the then-as-ever failing British film industry. You can see that on one level it's a vaguely ambitious attempt to do something a bit different, but it's not a terribly compelling mystery and its horrific undertones are played down for most of the running time, with director Peter Sasdy doing a professional but rather flat job of it.

For much of the film it's a fairly ambling investigation into a fatal coach crash that may have been intended to kill the rich trustees of an orphanage on a remote Scottish island who have recently been dropping like flies but which instead ended up killing the driver and hospitalising one of their charges who turns out to be central to the would-be mysterious goings on (Gwyneth Strong, who would grow up to marry Rodney in Only Fools and Horses). Keith Barron's doctor thinks she's too psychologically disturbed to be returned, Lee's pompous and obnoxious semi-retired detective thinks she's just collateral damage, George Brown's confrontational reporter thinks her nightmares may hold the key to it all and Cushing's pathologist is largely just there to listen to everybody else's theories while suspicion is cast heavy-handedly on the girl's ex-prostitute natural mother (Diana Dors) who helpfully has already done time for murder.

Yet the threat is rather vague for much of the film even after a couple of dead bodies turn up and there's no-one to really root for thanks to cardboard characterisation and misjudged performances. The two leads are both on grumpy form that allows neither to shine and Brown's aggressive turn isn't going out of her way to win over any of the audience either: at times it's as if all three are trying to win a Who Can Be The Most Unsympathetic competition. As a result the film leans far too heavily on a shock ending that's slightly Wickerish, involving as it does Christopher Lee and another deadly bonfire, but to preserve the surprise (which was given away anyway by the film's alternate US title) the screenplay goes out of its way not to introduce any of the more interesting ideas until the last 15 minutes of the film despite one pretty big early hint on a hospital door. Nor is the journey to those last 15 minutes particularly interesting, not helped by the attempt to inject some tension by intercutting Dors evading police helicopters, a small army of search parties and the obligatory unobservant sentries as she makes her way to the orphanage in a bright red coat that sticks out a mile. Even the final potentially shocking image becomes absurd because, while you can understand why one character does what they do, there's simply no logical reason for the others to follow suit.

A few interesting faces pop up in the supporting cast, like Duncan Lamont, Fulton Mackay and a debuting Michael Gambon among the Scottish constabulary, and one-time TV Professor Quatermass John Robinson and Black Narcissus' Kathleen Byron among the orphanage trustees, but the end result is definitely a lesser and uninvolving slice of Seventies British horror.

While the UK PAL DVD is extras-free, Scorpion's US NTSC disc offers a decent widescreen transfer that also includes the original trailer, production notes and a fairly informative introduction by wrestler Katarina Leigh Waters as well as trailers for The Devil Within Her, Humongous, Final Exam and The Incubus.",1346803200,12,3590,4.9783333333333335

8074888,3,B000A6JQHC,"Almost but not quite a mystery.  Almost but not quite a suspense thriller.
The trustees of the Van Traylen fund start dying in peculiar circumstances.  These trustees are in charge of an orphanage on an island, cut off from the real world, left to their own devices, allowing no interference from anyone especially the police.  But the police are brought in when there is an accident involving a bus that the orphans are riding.  One girl is injured and taken to hospital.  A doctor becomes suspicious and involves the orphans real mother, a reporter, another doctor (Peter Cushing), and a police officer (Christopher Lee) who is becoming increasingly alarmed as the violence escalates and a seven year old orphan suddenly goes missing.  Who is killing off all the old geezers of the trust?  Why are all the children weird especially orphan Mary Valley (Gwyneth Strong)?  What are they hiding at this orphanage?

Not quite as absorbing as it should have been.  The main problem with this movie is the slow pace.  That, and the way they stingily dole out the necessary information required to piece the puzzle together.  Things don't become apparent until the final few minutes.  In between theres a lot of chatter, a few odd incidents, a lot of suspicious people acting suspicious, and some minor violence.  If not for the presence of Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing this would have been just another humdrum pseudo-crime flick.  They made it watchable.",1475452800,,1455,4.9300411522633745

8074891,3,B000A6JQHC,"This film, from January 1973, was introduced almost one year before The Wicker Man (December 1973). And while there are similarities: lost girl, remote island, this one has more of a police procedural feel. And that feel is what makes the ending, even all these years later, quite a shock.

What keeps it from being four stars is that the director isn't always sure how much of the actor spigot to leave on and some of the performances veer to the ""gee, that's out of character.""

If you like gorenography, this isn't for you. But if you like wondering just how they're going to wrap this ditty up without messing it up, you'll probably enjoy it.",1466899200,,646,4.560344827586207
8074892,4,B000A6JQHC,Not a bad older movie. You can't go wrong too much with Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee in the same movie. Diana Doris was a little over the top but not terrible. It's only hour and half long and worth it while its on Prime.,1466294400,,226,4.044444444444444

8074895,3,B000A6JQHC,"Bumping up to 3 stars due to the Lee & Cushing pairing:

Based on the novel by John Blackburn (which wasn't one of his stronger books anyway, in my opinion) this cinematic approach is actually rather lackluster. Comparisons to the Wicker Man? Not even close and is a rather far stretch. This film does not share one-millionth of the brilliance that is the Wicker Man! The film transfer is stable and solid enough, but the muffled audio is a real distraction and didn't help matters (made it much more difficult to sit through, straining to hear what was said).
Slow pacing coupled with a not very engaging story results in one of Peter Cushing & Christopher Lee's lesser collaborations. 2.5 stars rounded up to 3 for the Cushing/Lee star power.",1462320000,,744,4.723076923076923
