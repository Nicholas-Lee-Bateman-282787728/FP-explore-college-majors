8375297,3,B002NPY65A,This was a Christmas present for a Grand Child.  I wouldn't have purchased it and certainly would not listen to anything on the recording.,1402444800,,138,4.75
8375298,5,B002NPY65A,"Ok first off this is a good DVD and they did a good job on it.  As someone that was there and saw the show live,  i was a bit disappointed in this DVD.  First some of the songs were not shown in the order that they played it.  and there are some songs that were not included in the DVD that they played live at the show.  i mean they edited the list and shuffled the songs around.  36 CFs set lasted close to 2 hours, give or take like 10 mins.  What i remember from being there live at the show was that most of the songs they played was from A Snow Capped Romance CD.  I was hoping like everone else that it be the full show it wasn't, unfortunatley.  the good thing about this dvd is the lil videos in between some of the songs about the band and stuff, those moments were great.  It shows a side of them that not many people have seen.

ok on to the actuall concert footage from the dvd.

Since i was there, i remember the energy that you felt when u got in the building it,was electricfying.  People were just excited to be there.  Alaskans love 36, and it shows in the dvd and being there live.  and they made it known for like months that they were going to film a live dvd here in Anchorage everyone was pumped and ready for it.  i remember waiting outside to get in the weather was below freexing.  it was a cold spell in that january of 2009.  But as soon as 36 came on everyone went crazy and the show so much full of energy it was non stop.

if u wanna know more about what the show was like in person feel free to message and i will tell u more about it.

so for this review i must say that they should of made it longer and added some extra features and stuff.  all you get is like 60 mins of concert and like 20 mins of home footage and behind the scenes stuff.  this is a good dvd to have if you are a 36cf fan or not or jsut like the style of music.",1260576000,,1866,3.8680738786279685
8375299,1,B002NPY65A,"I am a huge 36CF fan, but this dvd blows. The band sounds terrible, Brocks voice sounds terrible. Dont waste your money.",1259452800,,120,4.5
8375300,2,B002NPY65A,"Before this dvd came out, it said that there was going to be a full live show, all of their videos and a ton of bonus footage spanning their whole 15 years as a band. While the bonus footage and interviews were well done, there are no videos in sight. The setlist was so short and the last song listed on the back of the case is not on the dvd. The All Night Lights was played for close to 5 seconds, then it cuts to the studio track and shows abunch of fans while it says the band member's names... just like in the beginning. Since this is my fav. 36 song, I was really looking forward to it. I don't understand why they would have paid to have it filmed and the sound taken off the soundboard and mastered, and not use it. It makes no sense. This product just seemed rushed and poorly put together.",1256774400,2,801,4.075949367088608
8375301,3,B002NPY65A,"So I bought this dvd today, I am a huge 36 fan and I have been waiting for this dvd since it got announced to be released a few months ago. Bought it and expected so much more, since this band has dropped 5 albums and has been around for 15 years. The content on the dvd is a single snow featuring 9 songs, the back of the dvd lists 10 but that not true, ""The All Nights Lights"" which is the last song listed is not the actual live performance, it starts off as a live song, then cuts into the studio version and displays a 360 camera view of a bunch of fans then starts announcing the band members/credits then the music fades and it shows the band playing beer pong. I understand the fans want to see the band doing other things other then the live show on a dvd but when you cut away from the show that is listed I believe it is wrong, the track list is misleading. I felt as though I was slightly ripped off cause I paid for something and didn't get the full product that was being promised. so to sum it up, this is a single show with 9 songs with a small amount of interviews and band history, like what was mentioned in the prior review to mine, this basically is like a bonus dvd you would find along with a cd. If you are a fan of 36 Crazyfists, you will enjoy this dvd, just don't expect lot, the dvd only spans 78 minutes, and there are no specials features, only one selection from the menu. Overall, I say it is a decent effort for their first dvd.",1256601600,,1461,4.024054982817869
