472159,4,6302424887,"Roman Polanski's notoriously violent film of Shakespeare's notorious ""Scottish play"" doesn't quite satisfy as it should.  His bleak modernist interpretation is ultimately just too limiting, still it's  certainly a bruvura piece of moviemaking and can be best appreciated as  such.  After all, this is not really Shakespeare per se but a Polanski  film: the prevailing themes of witchcraft, rampant paranoia, and finally  triumphant evil pick up right where ""Rosemary's Baby"" left off.  And life is certainly nasty, brutish, and short in this  movie--Shakespeare's poetry takes a backseat to a surfeit of excruciatingly  detailed mutilations with plenty of blades slashing through jugular veins,  culminating in a truly epic decapitation. This ""Macbeth"" is a  relentless homicidal debauch: Polanski displays the same technical  virtuosity and gruesome inventiveness in staging the numerous murders here  as he did in ""Repulsion.""  All of Shakespeare's famous metaphors  (e.g., ""is this a dagger I see before me?"") are garishly  literalized and deliberately engineered as part of an escalating series of  spectacular, cathartic, bloodier-than-hell set-pieces.  Visually, the film  is rich and vivid: the forbidding images of rain-swept moors and twilit  horizons possess a spellbinding primeval quality.  And there are a few  brilliant, inspired moments such as when our murderous Scot, whilst lying  in his bed-chamber, broods ""I am so stepped in blood..."" and the  whole room is bathed in an eerie crimson light.  But the scene that truly  stands out is when he visits the witches in their lair and is shown his  fate: it's a gorgeous, thrilling, and strikingly imaginative surrealist  reverie.  The actors--nearly all British stage pros--are solid and  reliable.  As Macbeth, morose, dark-eyed Jon Finch is really quite  good--and he certainly does have the diction for the role.  But Francesca  Annis's sickly nymphet Lady Macbeth is a glaring (and oh-so-characteristic)  lapse in judgement on the director's part.  Weak-voiced, pasty-faced, and  generally irritating, this petulant little urchin has neither the skill nor  the presence to adequately bring off one of Shakespeare's most formidable  women.  Annis's feeble performance renders the basic psychological premise  of the play--Lady Macbeth's manipulation of her husband to fulfill her  delusions of grandeur--unconvincing to say the least.  Finch just looks  uncomfortably stricken while Annis acts coy and childish.  All in all,  Polanski's ""Macbeth"" is a decidedly thorny piece of work: since  it was his first film following the murder of his pregnant wife Sharon Tate  and friends by members of the Charles Manson cult, he seems to have had too  much to prove here.  By dispensing with the Bard's customary knot-tying  closing speech and ending instead with an abrupt silent scene suggesting  basically that the cycle of treachery and murder will spiral forever  through the ages, Polanski overstates his case.",916531200,22,2977,5.558295964125561

My rating is based on my receiving a dirty, used, copy of this production, and the jewel box was previously opened, the spine was cracked, paper torn, and there was dirt in the outer sleeve where the insert went, dirt on the inside of box and dirt on the CD which also had finger smudges.  So I can't comment on this version of Macbeth, which I was looking forward to seeing and now will have to rent because I do not want another copy like this one.

472204,5,6302424887,"As a British Literature teacher, I have been trying to find a good version of Macbeth to show in addition to the reading in class. This is by far the best one I have found. The cinematography is amazing and is a great source for the Common Core Standards (CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.11-12.7). One disclaimer I would give, though, is to be sure to send a permission slip home for parent approval to view the film. It is Rated-R, so this is usually required anyway. The rating stems from lots of blood and murder, nudity (non-sexual), and references to rape. My students cringed and gasped for most of the bloody scenes, but they definitely enjoyed it.
Analyzing and interpreting the director's choices for the cinematic effects is actually a lot of fun. For instance, there is one that really stood out to me which was after Malcolm is announced as Prince of Cumberland and Macbeth is leaving the castle. He walks through a hallway with columns which produces shadows on his face as he passes through. At the same time, his soliloquy is being played as if he is thinking it to himself. The contrast of the words (contemplating killing for the throne) with the light and dark images on his face highlights the good and evil dichotomy and is breathtaking. Though I am a major movie buff, I have never really been into cinematography; however, the assignment coupled with this movie has definitely sparked a new interest.
Even if you choose not to show the movie in its entirety (or you get push back from your district), showing different scenes as you read the play would greatly enhance the students' interest and comprehension.
If you cannot tell, I loved it. :-)",1490745600,5,1657,4.737024221453288

Because of the witches and their prophecy, this movie can stand along side fantasy medieval movies that a younger audience might like, with the benefit of knowing that you're watching a classical play.  I like how the witch's prophecy go from coincidence (being promoted to Thane) to a doubtful and fearful act of becoming king, to using the prophecy and altering the future (trying to kill Banquo and his son), to Macbeth's final full acceptance of the prophecy when surrounded by his enemies he yells out, ""I AM MACBETH!""

472215,3,6302424887,My expectations were low for this production. I was pleasantly surprised. I haven't found a Macbeth on disc that I like. This one was nearly watchable.

472217,5,6302424887,"This production is brilliant.  I used to show it to my seniors during the  years I taught Macbeth.  Polanski popularized it to some extent, and the film benefitted from the cinematography, which was great.  I like to think that Shakespeare would enjoy what some directors (like Zeferelli with Romeo and Juliet) have done with his works.  Shakespeare wrote to appeal to the penny audience as well as the royals, and he succeeded.  So when beginning students of Shakespeare can truly enjoy a production, with prior reading and instruction, I think that the director has succeeded.  In this production, the viewer actually sees Macbeth's face turn from that of an innocent brave young soldier's to that of a psychopathic killer.  Good to evil written on his face.  Lady Macbeth is no old hag, but a young vibrant woman, and her disintegration into madness is done with drama and even some sympathy.  But Shakespeare was always great with character complexity.  And when Macduff cries ""All my pretty chickens? In one fell swoop?""  I see more despair and anguish in this production than in any other.
And finally--the last scene.  Chilling.  Bone chilling.  Polanski here takes his greatest license, and damn!  it works!  He adds one more scene, just one more, but it tells all.  Watching this entire play is worth it, just for Polanski's take on the future.  Enough said.",1473379200,8,1367,4.916666666666667

Polanski excelled with his movie directing skills in this Shakespearean masterpiece.

Polanski directs brilliantly, the supporting cast is great with special applause to Ms. Annis and Martin Shaw as the betrayed Banquo who just won't stay dead.

472249,1,6302424887,"Roman Polanski did the best he could to adapt to cinema this overrated play.

The die is cast by witches from the beginning of the story so there is simply no suspense. The viewer must without any belief watch at the insipid cariere of a king who's fate is to be quickly overthrown.

If only Shakespeare had nevertheless managed to superimpose a beautiful love story, to compensate. While striving to make the most presentable as possible Macbeth, Lady Macbeth alone carries on her shoulders all the horrors of their situation. Only sometimes the look of this woman lights up as when there is the killing of a bear before her eyes.

Still more annoying is the end of the story. The fearful puppet easily superstitiIious is actually a great knight when it is time to die. It is as if all his accumulated inaction throughout his kingship paradoxically increased tenfold his forces at the hour of death. Polanski has fortunately taken care to mention introductory acts of bravery from our hero, although it is shown through a very thick fog.",1448668800,,1038,4.7555555555555555

Hard core Shakespeare fans could easily pick this adaptation apart pointing out what is missing & what is not word for word Shakespearian, but it is almost impossible to make a movie without a lot of editing  of Shakespeare's prose if not the movie would be 3 to 4 hour's long & rushed at that!  This movie will please fans of Shakespeare & fans of period pieces alike.  It is visually stunning & stays true to the original story.  I blanche at the idea of so called ""Updating"" the works of William Shakespeare changing his words to more modern speech, to that I say grab a dictionary and expand your vocabulary if you don't understand Shakespeare's word's.  Basically you don't change perfection for the uneducated you educate them to appreciate perfection.  And translating the works of William Shakespeare to the big screen cannot be done without making changes.  This leaves the person making the movie trying to perform a balancing act and in this case Roman Polanski pulls it off quite nicely in my opinion anyway.  Even if you don't care about Shakespeare Roman Polanski has made a movie that fan's of Sword & Sorcery, Period pieces or action adventure would like to add to their movie library.",1443052800,2,1374,4.636363636363637

472306,5,6302424887,"1971 is a year director Roman Polanski will never forget. For it is that year, in which he made this definitive version of William Shakespeare's Macbeth. 1971 is also the year in which the infamous murderer and cult leader Charles Manson got a life sentence in a California prison for the grisly murders of Polanski's pregnant wife Sharon Tate and several family friends in 1969. It is hard not to imagine that this intense personal tragedy did not influence Polanski's craft. The timing of the film speaks unspoken volumes. The film is brutal, harsh and unrelenting. According to Shakespeare, the characters are full of sound and fury, but signify nothing and that is exactly how Polanski films Macbeth. Polanski's adaptation of Macbeth is most likely the closest to The Bard's original intention of the play. A tale of lust and revenge where prophecies and lies mix with shallowness and false bravado. Hallucinations and ghosts are commonplace, while honor and courage are in short supply. This is the medieval world of Macbeth, Macduff, Duncan, Malcolm, Banquo, the three witches, and Lady Macbeth. Daggers are in the character's minds, meanwhile the audience's eyes feast upon stunning cinematography, their ears fill with Shakespeare's dialogue, and feelings of relief come over the viewer that such a world existed only in the past. In addition, a feeling of despair and sorrow arises once the viewer makes the connection that such brutality also touched the life of the director.

The imagery in the film is unforgettable right from the opening long shot that introduces the witches in the misty plains. The visual imagery has done full justice to the period that this tale depicts in Scotland. The visuals are superb. The casting is excellent with a strong direction by Polanski. It is a masterpiece. I have not seen a better Macbeth.
The film leaves a powerful impact on you. The dream sequences introduced by Polanski are beautiful and his use of the narrative makes a strong psychological impact on the viewer.
Jon Finch is a powerful Macbeth and Francesca Annis is better than him as the power hungry wife,Lady Macbeth. Nicholas Selby plays King Duncan. The whole tale is about plotting to murder Duncan when he comes over to Macbeth's castle in Scotland as a guest. They usurp the throne and Macbeth becomes the King of Scotland as per the prophecy of the witches but this is short-lived as he is avenged by the families of all those he destroys and they take the help of England to get even with Macbeth
The locales for the castle have been perfectly selected and the typical Scottish weather has been shot with finesse. The bloodiest play of William Shakespeare is given a chilling face lift by Roman Polanski.",1428105600,3,1407,4.770491803278689

To my mind the best performances in my experience are Ian McKellan and Judy Dench a Royal Shakespeare Company stage production. This is Shakespearean acting of the highest caliber. However, it would be grossly unfair to contrast Polanski's film version with the stage version filmed. Polanski's film is a triumph, but for very different reasons. First, the location shooting in Scotland is thoroughly atmospheric, adding a special dimension not available to Shakespeare and indeed most productions. Polanski's colors are muted by fog and overcast with the ocassional shaft of light cutting through the air. SO FAIR AND FOUL A DAY indeed!. The acting is vividly Shakespearean and believably medieval, with the two principals bringing their youthful passion and commitment to these amzing roles. I do not hear the sheer poetry of blank verse; to my ears it sounds like rhythmic prose, which describes the mature Bard in a nutshell. In this age of Quentin Tarantino and even Games of Thrones, I won't even comment on the graphic violence, because it is relevant to the play. Enough said. Polanski and his team re-wrote the ending - We are led to believe Malcolm has won a decisive victory and Scotland will be at peace. Then, we see Malcolm's younger brother arriving at the witches' cave. Macbeth predicted by murdering the King WE BUT TEACH BLOODY INSTRUCTIONS.

472352,5,6302424887,"In my opinion, Polanski's version of Macbeth is the greatest film adaptation of any of Shakespeare's work.  Dark, gritty, and violent, with beautiful scenery and a superb soundtrack by Third Ear Band.  I'll assume that if you're looking at this you're probably familiar with the film itself.  I've owned this film before on laser disc, but have been looking for a higher quality version and when I saw that Criterion had released a remaster on Blu Ray I decided to jump on it.  In my opinion the picture quality is excellent.  Not the best remaster I've seen, but a far cry from the worse.  The audio quality is wonderful.  I haven't had a chance to check out any of the special features yet but I'll update my review when I do.  I didn't really price compare anywhere else, but I feel like the price is very fair considering both the quality of the remaster and of the film itself.  Also, unrelated to the film, but Amazon's shipping was much faster than expected.  I was originally under the impression that I would receive my order on the 4th of November, but actually had it in my mailbox on the 1st.  I wouldn't say that my experience with getting my package so fast will be typical, but I felt like Amazon deserved a thumbs up for that one.

It may not be the most loyal to the original play, but it still manages to do everything right and provide a new experience for the viewer. I was thrilled to see that Criterion picked it up and gave it their famous restoration.

The blu ray picture and sound quality is stunning. It doesn't matter how many times you've seen it before, 1080p this perfect makes a world of difference. I don't think I've ever seen such dark tones pop so vividly. Ominous clouds and chainmail armor dazzle the screen with unbelievable clarity. The audio is rich, immersive and foreboding. The whole experience is surreal and fantastic. Shakespeare would be proud.

OVERALL: Just because this is an 'older' movie doesn't mean that a fine HD restoration is pointless. Obviously the original film quality provided excellent material for Criterion to transfer onto Blu Ray. The outcome is a home video release like no generation has ever seen before.

To all the people who have stated that this film is not what Shakespeare intended, or was just what Shakespeare intended.......how do you know this?  Time travel?  A conversation via seance?  Did you obtain a hair from Shakespeare's beard and clone yourself a new Shakespeare?  Did Mister Peabody and Sherman tell you?  Even the most eminent Shakespeare scholars probably won't all agree on what Shakespeare intended.  Twenty-first century schoolkids who saw this in their senior English class are, of course, going to find this film awkward and antiquated, because even the live action films they're accustomed to are full of cartoonish CGI.  Try putting on a heavy suit of steel armor and bashing away at each other, and see if it looks as cool as it did in those Thor or Iron Man flicks.  The only other thing I would like to say is that if anybody says ""I'm no prude, but""..........be prepared for some industrial-strength prudery.  And oh, I almost forgot......this is an excellent film in the 70s vintage style, and believe it or not, young persons, it was quite cool and exotic in its time.  I think it still is, but that's coming from another relic of the 70s.

472381,5,6302424887,"First of all, to everyone who rated it low and complained about the bathing scene - you are so whiney. There's something wrong with you to think that that scene was in any way wrong. He's a child, times were different. It was symbolic. And the naked witches, really? You got upset over that? You barely see anything and besides, that is how old women look. For some reason, Americans tend to blow sky-clad-ness out of proportion and turn it into some weird perverted horror. In real witchcraft, that is very much accurate. Most of the rituals are performed sky-clad. And no, it isn't sexual.

Anyways, the only thing I disliked were the special affects. The acting was really not that bad. I myself am a huge fan of Macbeth and have seen many adaptations. This one, I found most realistic. I found the aesthetic incredibly historically accurate as well. It seems Polanski focused less on the performing of the words, and more on the atmosphere (which I am perfectly fine with, though I know a lot of people disliked this).

It was a little violent, but nothing compared to the violence shown these days. The scenery was beautiful, and a perfect place to have been filmed. I really enjoyed this. It was a little dry at times.

To fault him for failing to do so is to create a straw man. Polanski's chosen theme is the graduation from fear to paranoia to schizophrenia (see Replusion, Rosemary's Baby, The Tenent, etc). Macbeth is a wonderful vehicle for him to explore this theme.

His genre is film, more specifically the horror/suspense film. Voice over is the obvious method to translate the soliloquies to a non present audience. The spoken soliloquy is a limitation of the stage, and there is no need to impose the film with it. Likewise, Polanski did not limit himself to hokey stagecraft for the murder scenes and the scenes involving the supernatural. He achieve a wonderful, horrific hyper reality using film craft. If you want to see the unadorned play, go to the theater.

472459,4,6302424887,"Roman Polanski's MACBETH, a movie that really doesn't seem to fit as a great Shakespearean tragedy but rather as a grab for power in a den of criminals. If it hadn't been for the large army & the inclusion of the English as a party of interest you would never know that this involved a king & a kingdom.

The lords are mainly ignorant & subject to their perceived lusts. Macbeth himself appears as a weak fool that latches onto augury as an excuse to perform his evil deeds. Having then done even one his mind breaks as he piles misjudgment on misjudgment on further augury. His wife, again a person of weak character & mental fortitude, basically piles shame on her husband's weakness only to snap suddenly and disappear into madness.

There's no hero here, no divine justice or claim to honor. A bad man seeks & obtains that which he is unfit for. He is brought down by his enemies banding together as one would expect. The language is that of Shakespeare but the characters speaking them do not seem to be. A good king is destroyed by an evil & ambitious man who is destroyed by the good king's people in defense of their homes & selves. Still, there are some great lines such as ""by the pricking of my thumbs, something wicked this way comes."" The storyline is Shakespearean but the movie doesn't convey it well.

It is interesting to note that the only characters in this story that get what they want are the witches. They wanted Duncan gone & whiz-bang, he is removed without them lifting a finger. I give it 3.5 Amazon stars for Polanski's direction & the wonderful dark images used throughout. Macbeth is not Hamlet but it is an OK told tale in this case.

I settled on the infamous dagger speech, and got No Fear's Macbeth so I could understand it, because, frankly - it goes over my head.  Also rented Polanski's movie from the library and popped that baby in with the subtitles on, yes, because it goes over my head, and watched that for maybe my third time in 20 years.  And it was terrific.  But then a funny thing happened.  As I started to research the piece, I began to crave the film.  I started watching it again and again, and the more I researched Macbeth, the more I fell in love with the film!!  I have become obsessed with it.  And it is because of the QUALITY of the filmmaking.  The locations, all of that - mood, ambiance, tone...sure.  All said, all great...but boy, do I love the actors!!

When they say ""They don't make them like this anymore,"" they mean films of this caliber.  I've gone over the Shakespeare movies since this film, and frankly they stink.  Too much lighting, too much editing, no mood or tone or even realism or real passion.  I can't stand them.  Give me Polanski's version, any day.  This is so much better than any Shakespeare film adaptation that it is ridiculous.  Folks, honestly, there's the Romeo and Juliet and Macbeth from the late Sixties era, man, and then it all just sucks.

But he understood MacBeth -- the play whose title none dare speak while in production --  understood how dark and subversive a play it is down at its core, and understood how to present the play to a modern audience while retaining its original setting.

Produced following Rosemary's Baby and the death of his spouse Sharon Tate in the Tate-La Bianca murders, the film loses none of its impact since its release. Elements from these two events informed the stark atmosphere of this version. What made Rosemary's Baby such a spine-tingling thriller was Polanski's ability at transforming seemingly ordinary events or people into pure evil. Here, rather than presenting the play in stilted, theatric, posturing, Polanski translates the dialogue as it would have occurred in an ordinary setting. There are plenty of supernatural elements to this version. These elements are brilliantly presented as the result of MacBeth's natural ambition, not supernatural at all.  The close proximity to the Tate-La Bianca murders certainly contributed to the graphic depictions of killings and violence which permeates the film. Some reviewers have taken issue with these portions of the film. However, life in Mediaeval Scotland was indeed ""brutish, nasty and short,"" as well depicted in his version.

Maybe because it was a rush job - as there are no extras, no commentaries, no nothing accompanying the release of this magnificent but much maligned film.

Polanski's take on the Bard is bloody original, outhouse outrageous, darkly comic and visually, viscerally exciting in a way that too few films based on Shakespeare's plays are.  Poetically photographed, concise in conception, visually captivating and for the most part wonderfully acted, this MACBETH grabs on and won't let go until its final gory end - and, actually, not even then.  It lingers.  It lasts.  It is worth the price of admission a hundred times o'er.

Some have said that the final clash twixt Macbeth and Macduff is somehow comedic in its cumbersomeness.  They miss the point.  It is supposed to be awkward and silly.  When the beheaded body of the armored Macbeth tumbles down the stairs like a crumpled tin can, it is supposed to be funny, stupid, the way the fate of all who grab viciously for power ultimately is.  Polanski lived through Nazi-occupied Poland - and as evil and destructive as the goose-stepping Germans were, they were also as utterly ridiculous as their mad mentor Herr Hitler. As is Macbeth in this blood-and-thunder telling.

Some complain about the nudity.  Why is Lady Macbeth naked in her sleep-walking scene?  Why is the coven of weird sisters naked on Macbeth's second visit to them?  Why not? Nakedness is part of the natural order - but shown here it also emphasizes the psychological states of those bereft of clothes.  Lady Macbeth has lost her sanity - and the absence of clothing merely heightens this vulnerability.  The hag witches are grotesque in their birthday suits as they whip up their disgusting potion which Macbeth then disgustingly drinks - but their hag bodies merely emphasize the dark, dangerous flip-side of Creation itself, mad motherhood in the mire.  The young naked boy bathing - and soon to be bathed in the blood of his killing - touchingly makes us confront innocence in a total, even shocking way that a shot of a cherubic face just couldn't fully convey and command.

Some have said that the gore is gratuitous.  It isn't. And even though it may have been somewhat cathartic for Polanski to have made this film (his first after the Manson-mandated murder of his beloved wife Sharon Tate and unborn son Paul Richard) the violence tells a tale within a tale, all its own.  It is a statement about a large part of the way of the world and not in any way excessive for a story as soaked in blood as this one is.

The credits of the film, by-the-way, are accompanied by no music but by the sound and fury of a battle, signifying...nothing, as battles mostly do.  And the first person to be seen post-credits is a soldier who approaches one of the fallen enemy.  Realizing the fallen man is still alive, the other beats him down and to death with a spiked ball and chain.  The killer looks very much like Manson at the time of the murders.  I don't think it was an accident on Polanski's part, not at all.  Perhaps just one more way to deal with that with it is ultimately impossible to deal with.

If there is anything that might be considered a flaw in the film, it is much of the interior and exterior set-bound lighting.  Some of the courtyard scenes reminded me of the phony exteriors to the Cartwright ranch on BONANZA.  This is such a dark and gloomy film in its essence, that the exteriors seemed to counter this.  But...perhaps that was the effect Polanski wanted to achieve:  a dichotomy twixt the outside and the inside of things.  He may also have been trying to merge film and better-lit theatrical experiences in his take on Shakespeare.

Ultimately, however, this version of MACBETH is not a tale told by an idiot.  It is a movie made by a genius.",1354924800,6,3970,4.62
472553,3,6302424887,"I teach ""Macbeth"" to remedial-level seniors.  It wasn't my choice of play and I don't enjoy the story much.  That said, this film does help to get the students through--more because it gives them something to laugh at than anything else.

The film isn't a straight adaptation.  It takes some liberties with the order of the scenes, removes some scenes/characters, and moves some dialogue around, especially when it comes to converting spoken lines to voice-overs.  The acting is average at best, as are the sets and costumes.  The fight scenes are laughably slow.  More than anything, some of the dialogue is obviously overdubbed, especially with MacDuff.  Much like the play itself, it doesn't do much to convey the passage of time and its effects on Macbeth's mindset.  Over than a little make-up to make him older, that is.

When I show this, I don't censor the nudity of the witches or of MacDuff's son.  It's truly gratuitous nudity--and not in the way most filmmakers would do it.  My students are 18-19, so I let them watch it.  I wouldn't do that if you have younger students.

Because I use this while teaching the play, I only watch part of the film at a time, as the students read it.  For this, it serves well enough to help students understand the gist of the action.

472588,3,6302424887,"It must certainly be a daunting task to adapt a Shakespearean play.  In this 1971 production, Roman Polanski chooses to show very explicitly many events that occur off-stage in the theatre, for instance Macbeth's  stabbing of the king and in the end his own beheading.

Was the intention simply to be more cinematographic or, given the movie was produced by Playboy, to shock the audience and stir up publicity?

In any case, 40 years later, these elements fall a bit flat as viewers are now regularly exposed to much more violence and nudity.  Compared to say `Titus', a more recent adaptation of a work by Shakespeare, this `Macbeth' appears almost mild.",1307404800,,656,4.873873873873874

This dvd is an authentic, true-to-the story and almost word for word version of Shakespeare's bone-chilling tale of power, corruption and murder. Amazing costumes, scary witches, great scenery and wonderful acting by a very talented (but mostly unknown) cast. Teenagers love it, too. Probably too violent for younger children. If you are a fan of this bloody tale, I highly recommend it!",1299542400,2,546,5.0777777777777775
472590,4,6302424887,"This 1971 movie is simply a magnificent filming skill demonstration. Polansky takes a 400 years old drama, written in the most anti-cinematic language you can imagine, and he manages to generate a solid, powerful, dark film, which resists nicely to 2010 standards comparison. He also uses the filming industry resources at hand to make us believe we are in Middle Age Scotland, with its rainy skies, muddy roads, armored knights, stone castles and barbaric violence. No silly transposing to modern time, this IS what Shakespeare surely had in mind. Macbeth is a play of shocking bloodshed, and Polansky shows us all the blood scenes that happen off-stage in the original, thus adding a stunning realism. No matter how many miles of filmed violence are there since 1971, Duncan's murder here is still a terrifying thing to watch, believe me.

Polansky players are very good. They are much younger than those we usually see on stage, because cinema requirements are different, so we can see true-to-story aged characters. Jon Finch is quite convincing, as all the rest of the male cast. Beautiful Francesca Annis lacks (completely) the dark, choked, evil voice Lady Macbeth needs (Kate Fleetwood in the recent Macbeth PBS presentation has that voice, wow!), and Annis ""Hollywood look"" may seem frivolous to some purists, but she is cleverly directed by Polansky, so finally makes it.

I have no trouble with some non-original issues, like Ross unmoral collaboration with the tyrant and Donalbain visiting the witches: they distract, but don't spoil the whole picture. I think the film soundtrack, by The Third Ear Band, is quite poor: I miss a heavier, richer instrumentation on some scenes, according to the all-time masterpiece we're dealing with.

472592,4,6302424887,"Bizarre, but then when has Polanski been otherwise? Bizarre but effective. Finch is good but not startlingly so. The exquisite Francesca Annis is frighteningly real as Lady MacBeth. Locations are perfect and complete a compelling film.",1287878400,,235,5.555555555555555
472593,4,6302424887,"By removing parts of many scenes, the overall result was more concise and less confusing for those not already familiar with the play or the Elizabethan dialog.  As far as I could discern, no dialog was changed.  This abridgement also made it possible to depict events which are only reported to the viewer in the full play.  For example, the execution of Cawdor was witnessed by King Duncan rather than just reported to him.  And MacDuff's final fight with MacBeth was depicted quite realistically with regard to medieval weapons and amour rather than taking place off-stage with MacDuff reappearing with MacBeth`s head..
.
Set in a starkly bleak landscape with dreary weather along with highly accurate and minutely detailed depictions of everyday life in the castles, the the film set an ethereal and even fantastical atmosphere.
.
Many of the soliloquys were done by voice-over rather than directly spoken.  This invited the listener into the mind of the character, and was more realistic when in the presence of others since this removed the need for a hard-to-hear mumbling sotto voce.
.
The director put in some additional plot twists which were latent in the original, and indeed I wonder if Shakespeare did himself or expected other producers to so tamper with his script..  These were accomplished without altering the basic story and dialog.  I describe two of these below but there might have been others that I missed.

Donalbain, the younger son of King Duncan and disinherited brother of Malcolm, has no function in the play except that his conversation with Malcolm after the murder of Duncan explains their flight from Scotland.  (But this explanation could have been done just as well with a soliloquy by Malcolm.)  Donalbain tries to suppress an angry snarl when his father announces that Malcolm gets everything.  Malcolm's speech terminating the play by proclaiming the restoration of a ""kinder gentler"" Scotland under his rule is omitted.  Instead, the final scene of the film is a lone rider in the rain dismounting and carrying something (perhaps an offering) to the place where the witches can be found.  He is recognized only by his slight limp as Donalbain.  This of course sets up for a sequel, which would hopefully resolve the as-yet unfulfilled prediction that Banquo's line will be kings, for which his son Fleance is conveniently available.  There is a great opportunity for Donalbain to become a sort of Scottish Richard III.  Rosenkrantz and Guildenstern are Dead is one such exploration of Shakespearean loose ends; are there any others?

Another interesting touch accomplished without change in dialog is the transformation of Ross.  At face value in the play, he is a loyal and honest servant of the new king MacBeth until he can no longer stomach the tyranny, slaughter, and corruption, then defects as a patriot to join other disaffected Scottish lords under Malcolm in England.  In this film, he becomes a self-seeking and willing accomplice of MacBeth.  Ross is the mysterious and unexpected third murderer of Banquo.  [III:3]  (It almost seems that this inclusion is some sort of ""gateway"" put in by Shakespeare for just such a character.)  A nice touch learned later by organized crime is that the hired murderers are themselves killed by being thrown into an oubliette in MacBeth's castle.  New murderers are then hired for the MacDuff purge.
.
Ross' unexplained visit to and comforting of the wife of MacDuff is merely a ruse to throw her off guard and to get the postern to open the castle gates for the murderers. [IV:2]  (This is analagous to a well-planned Stalin era arrest in which a collaborator appearing to be friend visits the victim for a few hours prior to the arrival of the NKVD in order to prevent flight, suicide, and destruction of evidence.)  The playwrite sets this up when Ross seems suspiciously in a hurry to depart MacDuff's wife before the murders arrive:
  I am so much a fool, should I stay longer,
  It would be my disgrace and your discomfort:
  I take my leave at once.
Ross only defects when Macbeth awards his ill-gotten estate of Cawdor to another lieutenant, leaving Ross unrewarded for all the evil deeds he has done on behalf of Macbeth.  Ross is welcomed as a partiot by Malcolm and hypocritically reports the death of MacDuff's family.  The tale of his treachery dies with Macbeth.",1286496000,,4364,4.932876712328767

472595,5,6302424887,"In his inimitable style, Polanski has turned a classic play into a great film, brilliantly creating an atmosphere, adding action, and rendering the characters vividly alive.

All too often, Shakespeare comes off as staid and too high brow, like you have to read and then hear the play to really get it.  Of course, when you make the effort, it is as beautiful as opera, which requires a similar preparation to fully appreciate.  What Polanski accomplishes is simply astonishing:  without dumbing it down in the slightest, he makes a very complex play completely understandable in a single viewing.  It is one of the best such adaptations I have ever seen.

What Polanski emphasizes is the horror of what Macbeth does, a witness to his corruption and psychological deterioration from the inside, making it into a psychological drama.  That is one layer that is there in the original play, but it is harder to feel - at least in my viewing experience - than when Polanski does it.  The work really becomes in part that of Polanski, while respecting the language and forms of the original.

The backdrop, as shot in Wales I believe, is fabulously vivid.  You really feel as if you are there, from the gate guard urinating in the courtyard to the fires that heat the rooms.  Though the actors were not well known, they are perfectly cast, especially the phenomenal Francesca Annis and Jon Finch.

Warmly recommended.  Just be prepared to dream about it once you turn off your DVD player.  Note:  I got the British version of this new for $5, though without commentary.",1276819200,,1564,4.7835820895522385
472596,4,6302424887,"I'll close out my trio of reviews concerning cinematic adaptations of Shakespeare from my college years with one of the most notorious film versions of all, Roman Polanski's adaptation of MACBETH. His first film after the murder of Sharon Tate was heavily criticized for its excessive violence although it's all right there in the text. The film was co-financed by Hugh Hefner which led to two very controversial scenes, naked witches and a nude sleepwalking scene for Lady Macbeth. Now that the shock effect has worn off (Julie Taymor's TITUS is far more explicit), what we are left with is a quality adaptation that really brings out the supernatural elements of the play. Yes, this Macbeth is ambitious, but in this version his choices are the result of dark forces working against him rather than active choices on his part.

Jon Finch and Francesca Annis head a cast of solid but lesser known British supporting players who bring the various characters to life. John Stride's duplicitous Ross is especially memorable. When I first saw the film I thought the two Macbeths were perfectly cast from a physical point of view but that both were somewhat underwhelming. I still think that today but then this version is all about atmosphere. It's Hammer Horror meets Shakespeare and I don't have a problem with that. Gilbert Taylor's stunning cinematography (captured on this DVD in the proper aspect ratio) of various locations in Wales, the haunting music by the The Third Ear Band (released as a soundtrack album), and the omnipresent feeling of death and despair make this MACBETH a remarkaable if not especially pleasant experience. Incidentally, I don't know if Sony knows the difference, but that's Banquo on the DVD cover not Macbeth.",1276560000,,1741,5.003448275862069
472626,5,6302424887,"Polanski is surprisingly sensitive in filming novels(Tess,Rosemary's Baby,Oliver Twist The Ghost);here he is, turning Shakespeare's drama Macbeth, into Polanski's Macbeth. Like a medieval sequel to Rosemary's Baby,it's filled with necromancy,murder,evil and witchcraft. Dark,dank,muddy and dangerous,filmed in appropriate locations(shot in Wales and Northumberland).The vision of a pagan,nihilistic universe full of death, revenge,superstition and prophecy. The mad ambition of Macbeth, galvanised by the witches and Lady Macbeth,sets him on his vaunting path from warrior virtue, as the Thane of Cawdor, to the murderer of Duncan, to become king. Polanski somehow guts the play(assisted by Tynan) of rhetoric(soliloquies filmed as thoughts),films an imagined blade as a real one,earths the verbal gymnastics in a kinetic narrative,so that pacing,momentum of set-pieces,rich visualization,fluent editing,create an atmosphere of dark nightmare and momentous terror. Gory,bloody,brutish and scary,this primeval world leaves nothing to the imagination,limbs lopped off,decapitations,the murder of McDuff's wife and children in their home,the ripping of babies from wombs is visualised,Banquo's ghost looks freshly murdered,Duncan is savagely stabbed while asleep. Weighed down by guilt and sleeplessness,Macbeth seeks out the witches for reassurance that he will not be defeated and to protect him from despair.

Distraught with guilt,Lady Macbeth walks(nakedly) and talks in her sleep,betraying the secret of Duncan's murder. The images of the film take the place of Shakespeare's language with spectacular realization and a modernist interpretation, using a rhythm and pacing that is Polanski's own,filmed as it was 2 years after the brutal murder of his wife Sharon Tate. This real experience bleeds into the raw and nasty feelings of dread. Jon Finch as Macbeth has a dark,lean energy and ferocity,Annis as Lady Macbeth,captures the fragility of madness rather than manipulative eroticism. Martin Shaw is superb as Banquo. The ending suggests the whole cycle of betrayal and murder will begin again. Shakespeare,in making a sympathetic Banquo(legendary ancestor of the Stuart kings),intended some flattery to James I;the play also appealed to his well-known interest in witchcraft.

472627,4,6302424887,"I'm no Shakespeare junkie; let me get that out of the way right quick. I've only read a few Shakespeare plays and I've seen only a few Shakespeare film adaptations, none recent enough to tell you what I thought. Having recently read Macbeth and seeing that Roman Polanski (whose name has been a lot more prominent lately) made a film version, I was intrigued and that's why I'm here now. Having never seen another screen adaptation of this famous play, I have no standard to hold Polanski's Macbeth to. However, I can tell you that Polanski's controversial adaptation is an unsettling, challenging film that has been hated by as many as those who have loved it.

A synopsis of the story from me is not necessary; while Polanski does not follow the play verbatim, he maintains the spirit of Shakespeare's play enough that the story is still the same. The script was written by Polanski and Kenneth Tynan, with Hugh Hefner as the executive producer, but rest assured...This is not another Caligula. Polanski uses virtually anonymous actors to tell this timeless tale and what a wise choice it was; it allows us to see the character's onscreen rather than the actors that portray them. Despite their anonymity, all of the actors are credible and believable.

I was shocked watching this film that it hasn't received more acclaim. The three witches are rendered perfectly in the physical sense and are creepy without being campy. Moving on, while Polanski and cinematographer Gil Taylor give Macbeth a monotonous look, adding to the somber tone of the story, there are moments however where the imagery here is picturesque. Not a single review I've read mentions Jon Finch as Macbeth and I was greatly impressed by him. The actor really does take Macbeth through a complete transformation over the course of the film. Polanski's Macbeth is not a perfect film and there are aspects I feel Polanski could have handled a little better, particularly the scene of Macbeth with the dagger which felt somewhat campy to me.

This is not the film version of Macbeth you're likely to stumble on in a high school classroom. Lady Macbeth sleepwalks in the nude (which I think may have something to do with the name on that producing credit) and many have commented on the violence in Polanski's Macbeth. I don't think that Polanski has made Macbeth violent as, written by Shakespeare, Macbeth is a violent story and Polanski has simply refrained from sanitizing the violence in Shakespeare's work. Yes, the murder of Duncan was not shown in Shakespeare's play while it is shown in the film. One gets the feeling that Polanski was still reeling from the violent death of his wife Sharon Tate at this point and I think that many of the more violent scenes were a way of showing the animalistic nature of humanity. There is a scene where Macbeth has a vision in the witches' lair and I think there are few who are familiar with Tate who will not be inclined to bring her to mind. I got the sense that Polanski was not in the happiest of moods while shooting this film.

Macbeth is an underrated, overlooked, very well-made adaptation of Shakespeare's work. It's a challenging, dark, pessimistic film with a haunting ending (one that differs from Shakespeare's). It's not the most accessible film whether you're a Shakespeare junkie or a Shakespeare virgin, but it is a terrific film worth of praise and attention.

472628,3,6302424887,"The most commendable aspect of this adaptation is the filming. It should be seen for the opening act alone.  The witches' spell on the shore, Macbeth's castle on the hill, the bleak shots of the landscape - all truly remarkable!!

The acting is another story.  Its not bad - but its not particularly effective either.  The actors do not attempt to engage their audience.  In fact, they ignore their audience altogether.

All of Macbeth's solo speaking parts are portrayed as thoughts.  Therefore, Finch doesn't have to actually act (or even memorize) much of his role.  He simply has to ""look"" thoughtful while a prerecorded track narrates the lines for him.  Not only does this approach come across as cheap, but it also removes that vital bridge that needs to be built between the hero and his audience!  These are times where the character is, more or less, speaking to the audience, to draw them in.  That bond never happens here.  I don't believe Polanski really grasps how Shakespeare is supposed to work.

Otherwise, the costuming is fine - most of it is 14th to 15th century period, rather than 11th, but Shakespeare, himself, was as guilty with anachronisms.",1247875200,16,1167,4.833333333333333
472629,5,6302424887,"What can I say....this is a great Macbeth. It's all good.

My favorite thing is Polanski's concept of the witches. They do much witchcraft but no magic. They act like Medieval witches we are told acted. They bury a severed hand with a dagger in it....and a battle takes place there. They hand Macbeth a beaker full of goop with psilocybin mushrooms floating on top and he hallucinates the 8 Kings. They chant and spit and hop and laugh at naked sabbats....it's great!

Speaking of nudity....
This seems to be a problem (along with the graphic murders) for those one and two star reviewers. None of this is gratuitous however. The blood is there, prompted by the script itself ( Who's have thought..... And it can never be washed away) and by the very environment and culture. The nudity is easily explained. Lady Macbeth sleeps nude and so when she sleepwalks....she's nude. Now in ""reality"" a queen might actually sleep in a bliaut or some kind of chemise, but her nudity is also symbolic. She is after all exposing herself and, for the 1st time in the play, being openly honest. I think it's perfectly justified. The witches are all naked because that's what supposedly happened at sabbats, as they raise a demon or the devil himself to have intercourse with (Like Rosemary's baby, y'know)

It's funny, I remember when the film came out the main complaint was Macbeth's and Lady Macbeth's age. ""They're supposed to be middle aged!"" my professors lamented. It says nothing about that in Shakespeare that I can find.

Perhaps they are disappointed that Polanski chose to put his own mark on ""The Scottish Play"" and it isn't ""by the book.""

It seemed to me that they didn't care at all about what they were doing. If you want a version of Macbeth that goes basically hand in hand with the play than this is it. I enjoy movies better when directors put twists and change up how things happen instead of leaving them exactly how they are in the play. Another thing, they stuck exactly to the text in the play. They didn't adapt it into any sort of modern English or put a twist on it or anything. All in all, this movie was a disgrace to Shakespeare's play and to directors everywhere.",1228953600,2,720,4.421052631578948

  I think that  this movie version of Macbeth just did not live up to my expectations.  I thought that Polanski's version was quite boring to say the least. Not that it depicted the play badly but the characters were poorly picked and didn't act very well. I did like the bloody fight scene between Macbeth and Macduff in the end. However, it sort of made me laugh more than anything. Although, the acting wasn't quite up to par, the motif of hands was still used just like in the play. I think Polanski followed Shakespeare's metaphorical use of hand imagery well here by showing the scene with Lady Macbeth sleep walking. Maybe I am to young to judge such a old classic but overall i thought it was pretty cheesy.",1228953600,3,750,4.525925925925926

Unfortunately, I was greatly disappointed. The movie turned out to be just as lackluster as the play itself. I am pretty sure that every single line of the original play is said in the movie, with no substitutions or additions. This lack of originality very nearly put me to sleep. The only spin the film had on the play was during the last 20 seconds when Donalbain is seen searching for the witches. The movie also pulled away much of the symbolism that the original play contained. The acting was terrible as well. On a more positive note however, the acting was so bad that at one point, during Macbeth and Macduff's battle I was very amused. I feel sorry that Shakespeare's work has been turned into a less than half decent film. He is said to be one of the greatest writers of all time, yet filmmakers destroy his play.",1228953600,4,996,4.538888888888889

This film adaptation of William Shakespeare's timeless tragedy, Macbeth, has been crafted in such way as to transform the ancient text into a movie that flows and progresses with such ease that even the most outspoken of Shakespearean critics will come to enjoy it.  Each individual element is portrayed crystal clear as the playwright would have wanted.  The darkness and violence shown in the play is perfectly captured in the film and does justice to the original motifs and thematics.  Such an example are the witches, shown so evil and conniving in the film that the viewer can't help but feel as if the written work were the sole screenplay for the movie.  It is very much refreshing to see a film adaptation match it's creative origin so closely in the age of hollywood blockbusters that strip books of their original context and power.

The scene with the naked witches was really disgusting and vulgar. If it wasn't for the hilarious fight scenes with Macbeth vs. Siward(And his men) and Macbeth vs. Macduff, I would have given it one star. Those fight scene where meant to be huge action packed moments that had the audience on the edge of their seat, but instead they had me laughing myself silly. My English teacher made the comment, during the Macbeth vs. Macduff fight, ""It's like watching two brothers fighting in a basement."" I think his description of the fight is spot on.

Such a great story, and such a poor rendering...Although I'm not the fan of action-packed Hollywood box office hits, this movie was unbelievably boring even to me. The terrible setting (when some character was looking out of the window, it was so obvious that the sunset and the countryside are not real) and even worse special effects (the scene where Macbeth stabs young Siward into the throat and the ""blood"" is running off - I know it's 70's and that I can't expect it to be totally authentic, but people, please, that wouldn't scare even a small kid) made this movie more of a comedy than a tragedy. And the fighting scene...if you need to cheer up, then certainly watch it and you'll be rolling on floor laughing as we were in class, but otherwise it's terrible and scene like this should have no place in tragedy. Unlike in the play, where one action followed another and the events seemed to progress pretty swiftly, the movie was kind of long-winded. But not to be totally unfair, there are some positive aspects to this movie. The actors were pretty good - at least Macbeth and Lady M - and I liked that Polanski used the original lines from the play.

I struggled to pay attention to the movie not only because of the slow tempo, but also because the actors where overly dramatic making the film seem more like a comedy than a drama. The fighting scene only emphasizes my point.  I think the scenery and location of where the movie was filmed was the best part of the movie, but burnham wood I pictured to be a forest, not three pine trees.

One warning: If you show this to young people in school, you may have to skip over the nudity in a couple of places.  It is not pornographic at all, but some parents could disapprove. Polanski takes advantage of what film can do, so his Shakespeare comes alive and does not appear stilted.

472668,5,6302424887,"Roman Polanski's screen adaptation of the Shakespeare classic was well received by some and loathed by others. On a personal level I thought the film was not only extremely well done but beautifully shot. Filmed on location in North Wales in England, Polanski not only researched his subject well but spared no cost in the production of the film. The actors costumes and the sets were lavish for its time and it provided a rich and colorful tone for the viewer. The tragedy of MACBETH, one of the Bard's greatest and toughest plays to understand and come to terms with fared remarkably well on this film version. As an English Literature major in college years ago, my professor required the we choose one of Shakespeare's plays and do a complete and thorough analysis on the work, I chose Macbeth and I found it not only challenging but quite difficult to understand the exact meaning of Shakespeare's beautiful old english language. It was a blessing that Polanski's film was available in the college library and I checked it out and saw the movie a couple of times before writing my paper on this complex character. I found the movie a lot easier to understand than the play itself and it helped me tremendously when I started to write my paper.

Although this version is quite bloody and shocking it doesn't diminish from the striking elegance and beauty that the film clearly shows. The movie has a bleak, dark and morbid feel to it and that is exactly as it should be I think. This is not a happy and sappy tearjerker or a comedy but a frightening, compelling, chilling and almost horror story of obsessive power, deceit and overbearing jealousy by Macbeth himself when he kills the King of Scotland so that he can take the crown and throne all for himself which is when his troubles begin and it consequences lead to his eventful downfall. I recommend this film adaptation not only to Literature majors but to everyone who has ever had a love of Shakespeare. The acting is splendid and the cast is first-rate and the language which Polanski adpated from the play makes it failry easy to follow and understand the plot and what each character says. That said this version of MACBETH is not for the faint of heart but then again the other versions of the play are not either. It was clearly to see that Shakespeare never intended for his Macbeth to be a subtle and forgiving character. The grotesqueness of the film is I believe an indispensable ingredient in understanding the complexity and darkened soul of this disturbing and unremorseful king. I recommend that you read the play before watching the movie just so that you have a general understanding of the plot and therefore will appreciate the film all that much more.",1214697600,3,2731,4.701461377870563
472669,5,6302424887,"As a high school English teacher, I have shown many different versions of Shakespeare's outstanding play to my classes.  Of all the versions I've used, this one seems to capture my kids' interest the most.  I love the fact that all of the dialogue is almost word-for-word from the play, and the acting is first-rate by everyone in the film.  (I do wish someone could tell me, though, why all the ""Scottish"" characters speak with a British accent? :))

While the other reviews point out some obvious areas for concern, such as brief nudity and some blood and gore, I believe this adds some realism to the film, and 17-18 year old students (this is usually included in the senior-level curriculum) should be able to view it objectively if warned of the adult content.  (However, I fully understand and respect any students' wishes not to view these scenes, and only show them if there are no objections.)  That being said, it is a fine adaptation of the classic play, and a very good enrichment activity if used after, or even during, the reading of the play.

BTW, I also recommend the Unabridged Audio CD version of ""Macbeth"" by the Arkangel Company-- I found that here on Amazon as well, and it really helps the kids understand the dialogue if they hear it as they read.  The actors even use a Scottish accent, which adds more realism to the reading.

Overall, Polanski's sweeping film is a very useful and interesting accompaniment to the play itself.  (One last thing-- that's Banquo on the cover, not Macbeth.  Just an observation....)",1212192000,3,1539,4.726591760299626

In my view this is the single most powerful film adaptation of any Shakespeare play.  Though much too intense for children or even most teens,  Polanski's artful direction captures the insanity, mysticism, jealousy, hate, and horror of the playwright's most brutal work perfectly. The settings are gloomy but realistic and the acting is uniformly excellent.

If Polanski never made another film, he would still be remembered for vividly capturing the complex intensity of this play.  Even jaded modern audiences are emotionally exhausted at the film's end- which is not easy to do in this age of ubiquitous violence and sex.

There is absolutely no sound reason for nudity in either of these scenes. Because of the nudity, I cannot show these two scenes to my high school students.

472717,5,6302424887,"This is a fierce and visionary interpretation of perhaps the most deceptively simple of Shakespeare's major plays.  The elements of bloody ambition, weak kings with wills overborne by steely women, unjust slaughter and revenge are perhaps the most elemental ingrediants for classic tragedy going back to the Greeks.  The atmosphere is haunted, half-waking and half-sleeping; the key dialogues brutally simple.  The witches' songs linger in your mind from first reading and never go away over your lifetime, like perverse versions of nursery rhymes.  Yet most directors who tackle the play, even some of the greatest, come at it like a car hitting ice and go into a careening skid.  Bad or also-ran Macbeths just don't cut it, anymore than fakey Halloween costumes.

Truth is, the play is a garden for the imagination, on paper, but a minefield of hidden traps when someone has the audacity to attempt to film it  -- something more than even that rare audacity is apparently needed to carry it off.  It is possible Polanski's reaction to his wife's own horrific murder provided the extra here, who knows?  Perhaps it gave him ""eye of newt""?  Then toss into the cauldron some $$$ from Hugh Hefner, trying to launder himself from soft core porn king into a major cultural figure ... toe of frog?  Well, something exploded in this cauldron, for sure.  Its scary as hell and hardly because of the blood.

On a more mundane level, a workmanlike and intelligent actor like Jon Finch, in his prime and with something to prove, delivered a damn lot to the title role.  His middle of the road, quasi-Everyman interpretation of the murderous anti-hero adds the real potent element to the brew -- something that leaves you saying, ""this could have been me.""  Francesca Annis, also in her prime, delivers splendidly too, and with all the keen reserve of a confident beauty -- sort of reminds us English speakers of what kind of face (and body) likely launched a thousand ships. Plus add Polanski's guts to show real old crones for the witches, naked as diseased old birds on a winter day.  He hardly cared whether your English teacher would laugh. And don't forget the audience -- make the dagger real and palpable, to Lady Macbeth and to us.  Just a figment of the imagination?  Well, that's just another second rate professor's sorry excuse.  This play was not constructed as closet drama, either, and every kid in the English speaking world needs be taught to understand the difference. Macbeth rather was and always shall be a body blow to the mass audience, when delivered properly.  Your professor should have told you too that Shakespeare himself freely altered his texts from performance to performance -- one can only imagine what his molten genius would have done if he ever had a camera in his hands.  Finally, the majestic use of scenery raises everything to the level of dreamscape worthy of Salvadore Dali, and better than anything any surrealist filmmaker (usually rather closet academic types, finally) ever accomplished.  Here, the wedding of waking and sleeping is seamless --just as in Shakespeare's semi-mad, quickly dashed off accidental masterpiece -- perhaps an artistic response to personal tragedy of his own.

In sum, this film has well stood up to the test of time.  The contoversies about nudity, Hefner, the Manson gang, and bad boy Polanski are very old news, by now, and ought finally be buried.  They never should have mattered anyway, but unfortunately the film was launched in this climate wherein it provided an easy mark to the chattering classes.  Nor does Polanski's genius require any excuse -- see his Tess and his Chinatown.  The real news is that this is the best Macbeth on film to date.",1166054400,12,3717,4.896166134185304
472718,5,6302424887,"This is a first-class FILM based on a Shakespeare play. As always, there's heavy pruning of the lines, but what we're left with is well served by the actors, the authentic medieval setting, and the medium of film itself. This MACBETH is gorgeously staged and performed. Is it violent? Sure -- but so are a lot of other films these days. Why should this be different just because it's Shakespeare?

Let's face it: Macbeth is a dark, bloody and -- at its heart -- nihilistic story. Can we really believe that Scotland will live happily ever after just because the usurper is dead? Shakespeare raises that question at the end, very subtly, and Polanski picks up on it. What I particularly liked here was the emphasis on how quickly ambition can poison the mortal mind, and how one's fate can turn in an instant. There's a thin line between good and evil, between the real and the unreal.

My Shakespeare professor back in college ridiculed certain details of the film, such as the mysterious dagger witnessed by Macbeth actually appearing on the screen for the audience to see. The idea, as he believed it, is that the dagger is a merely a product of Macbeth's fevered imagination, therefore WE shouldn't be able to see it. But I like how Polanski makes one wonder what the dagger really is. Is it a hallucination? Or the product of some darker force? Polanski's whole take on the story balances on a question -- what is the true nature of evil?

Finally, I want to address all those affronted viewers who have been shaken to their core by what seems to be the most horrific sight of all: the images of naked older women. Please. Get a grip. Those are just bodies. Maybe if Hugh Hefner had really been in charge we'd have had nubile Playboy bunnies standing in as the witches but, alas, he was just the money man, not the director.

Polanski's witches were actually another authentic detail -- even back in those days, the idea of old women going ""skyclad"" was a sure sign of evil. Nine hundred years later, people's perceptions haven't changed a bit.",1161734400,6,2048,4.602739726027397

Let me confirm that I am an avid fan of Shakespeare and love many of his plays as well as many of the movies that are based on them. In this one, however, I rather felt that Polanski took the play and ran wild with it. Yes, Macbeth is disturbing and depressing, so the fact that these elements turned my stomach may be considered by some as a success on the movie's part, but there are plenty of other things the play didn't include that the movie had unnecessarily. For example, the nudity. I'm no prude, but there was plenty of unnecessary and uncomfortable nakedness in this film and the majority of it seemed to add to the idea of the characters taking advantage of each other (maybe this was the intention, but I doubt it). The scene with Lady Macbeth wandering naked and mad around her room wouldn't have bothered me if a male ""doctor"" hadn't been standing there oogling at her. I wanted to smack him, as well as Lady Macbeth's maidservant, who stood there letting her mistress walk around naked in front of a man; how many of the notoriously prudish and protective lady's maids back then would have allowed such a thing? The inaccuracy of this scene made me think it was really just an attempt to prove that Lady Macbeth was just as attractive without her clothes on. What really disgusted me, though, was the scene showing a woman bathing her eleven-year-old son. He wasn't sitting in a tub, either, but standing and baring all from all angles in front of the camera. Gee thanks; a mother's intrusive treatment of her kid wasn't supposed to be the topic of the film, but who remembers these things? The kid's nudity perse didn't bother me, but considering his age, there was no need for a woman to be washing him like an infant and the scene had a very invasive feel to me. For the record, I don't have any problem with the naked witches. Unlike the people in the aforementioned nude scenes, the witches were fully grown, mentally sound and willing to be sky-clad, so I didn't feel like they were being disrespected or taken advantage of in any way.

On another note, some of the violence was a little too much, too; I did not need to see the perspective from the eyes of a decapitated head or a man getting a sword in the groin. The movie altogether gave me a feeling of dirty depression. Shakespeare may have been partly to blame for this, but it was definitely Polanski's additions to the story that decided me against a second viewing. This would have succeeded as a moving film without a great deal of the additional nastiness that it contained; substituting gratitious shock-value junk for quality always fails. Next time, try relying a little more on the pathos of the story. And please, let's keep parents out of the room when their big kids are taking baths, shall we?",1156204800,10,3013,4.54696132596685
472771,4,6302424887,"It is always refreshing to see new twists on Shakespeare as each generation of directors gives its take on the Master. While this adaptation drags near the ending and sometimes the dialogue is diffuclt to follow, for the most part this MACBETH works. Polanski has cast the Macbeths (Jon Finch and Francesca Annis) as younger than many directors do, has Lady Macbeth do her famous sleepwalking scene in the nude and portrays the coven of witches naked as well. Every critic has commented on the bloodiness of Polanski's version. There is blood everywhere; the death of Macbeth will make you gasp.

All the scenes with the witches are quite wonderful. There is a naturalism about the filming that is particularly good. One gets the impression that these people do actually live like this and may not smell good at the end of the day. These just might be real people rather than actors who strut and fret upon a stage. Having the actors do their soliloquies as internal thoughts works much better than the usual artificiality of talking to an imaginary audience. Annis as Lady Macbeth gives a stellar performance as the ambitious force behind a sometimes reluctant husband.

Polanski remains one of the great contemporary directors.",1153958400,2,1229,4.932367149758454

I cannot think of another Polanski film that I remember as vividly, and Polanski has made many great, great films.

Many remark on the violence in the film by saying it's over the top, but it isn't really.  It's a pretty gruesome but realistic depiction of warfare and the machinations of kings and politicos.  I find the film visually awesome, musically fine (a band called The Third Ear Band provide the music), the performances are excellent, and the overall attitude of the film is provocative without resorting to cheap shock value.  Seeing this film in a widescreen DVD (Polanski's framing is wonderful) is really heartening.  This is one of the finest adaptations of Shakespeare ever, and it's a shame that Polanski hasn't made anymore since.",1153872000,,923,4.909677419354839
472773,4,6302424887,"No true middle ground exists for this Roman Polanski-directed 1971 filming of Shakespeare's MACBETH; people either love it or they hate it.  Such often happens with provocative movies like this, whether it's Shakespeare or something else entirely.

But in bringing this most hard-edged of the Bard's plays to the screen, courtesy of Hugh Hefner's Playboy Enterprises and noted British critic and playwright Kenneth Tynan, Polanski not only stayed faithful to the play's dark, gothic, and tragic tale of betrayal and murder, he took many elements of the story that usually are done offstage and put them onscreen.  It is those elements that a lot of the derisiveness towards his telling of MACBETH is directed at.  This is clearly not a repeat of Orson Welles' 1948 version, nor Kurosawa's THEATRE OF BLOOD, by any stretch of the imagination.

Working with an all-British cast, notably Jon Finch (later to achieve notice as the beleagured innocent man of Hitchcock's FRENZY) as Macbeth, and Francesca Amis as Lady Macbeth, Polanski drips his version of the play largely in blacks and grays, with plenty of supernatural imagery--so much so that this could easily be classified as a horror film.  That incredible feel is enhanced by the first-rate cinematography of Gilbert Taylor, who worked with Polanski on his 1965 horror opus REPULSION, and with Stanley Kubrick in 1964 on DOCTOR STRANGELOVE.

There is no denying it, however.  Even now, thirty-five years since its release in late 1971, MACBETH remains an incredibly violent and graphic piece, very much in keeping with the Bard's intentions, and that violence, which includes several instances of severed body parts and much blood, placed it alongside two other notable 1971 films (Peckinpah's STRAW DOGS; Kubrick's A CLOCKWORK ORANGE) as a touchstone for the impact that graphic cinematic violence could have on the world at large.  And quite a good bit has been said about how much impact the horrific 1969 murder of Polanski's wife Sharon Tate at the hands of the Manson clan had on the director's storytelling.

Much of the latter, however, remains in the end a sidebar to this lengthy but compelling dark story.  In the end, like Zefirrelli's superb 1968 filming of ROMEO AND JULIET, this version of MACBETH stands out as perhaps the best example of cinematic Shakespeare sans either Welles or Olivier, and still remains intriguing.  But be advised because, again, this is definitely NOT a film for the younger set, or people with a low tolerance for extreme violence.",1151712000,3,2527,5.092009685230024

472775,1,6302424887,"This movie has a record in my book: THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!  It starts out laughably funny, and goes on to be such a horrid excuse for ""filmmaking"" that I wished it over.  Being a fan of the Bard, with Macbeth being one of my favorite plays, I looked forward to seeing an adaptation from the Famous (or infamous if you like) Roman Polanski.  What I saw was a hack job by someone who thinks he has talent.  And I'm trying to be nice.
the worst parts of the movie consisted of the monologues, which consisted of Macbeth and others make pensive faces while their voices were heard, like they're trying to remember what they had for dinner, and of course, the disgusting nudity of the witches.  I don't need to see that.  It seems to Mr. Polanski that naked equals insanity, because once Lady M finally goes bananas, she leaves her clothes in her room.  Or perhaps the nudity was necessary in order to get Playboy Pictures to endorse the waste of film this movie was, with some nude women closer to Hugh Hefner's own age.

The one thing I can say about it is that I met my now wife while watching it, and we both hated it so much we became friends.",1144022400,5,1154,4.261467889908257

This is a film that desperately needs to be made again...Lady Macbeth does not give even a lackluster performance, Macbeth is stoic and doesn't give the character any depth.

Though this movie is no Lord of the Rings, the movie was directed well enough that I was interested to see what would happen next, which is something no ShakesSpeare story has ever done so succesfully.

472780,5,6302424887,"Here we have an example of film enhancing the quality of the written word rather than degrading it; which is, unfortunately, all too often the case with popularizations. This version of MacBeth, the product of the vision of Roman Polanski and the late but outstanding writer Kenneth Tynan, does justice to a play that is perhaps the finest in the English language. The movie accomplishes a great many things such as giving viewers newfound respect for Hugh Hefner who was its executive producer. This is literature that speaks and bounds with the edge of man and the blood of centuries.

Macbeth captures the mood of the middle ages and the blackness present, at some level, within us all. In its gore and violence, it is a distinctly Mansonesque take on the classic. This should not be surprising given the unhappy recent events which befell Polanski and his wife Sharon Tate. We are given a concrete reminder of that hellacious crime with the visual revelation of MacDuff being hacked out of his mother's stomach before she could give birth to him. If you ask me, Jon Finch is the perfect Thane of Cawdor and Francesca Annis makes a maniacal and breathtaking Lady MacBeth. This is a study of madness, guilt, and the true results of man's lust for power. Yet, unlike real life, here, the wicked end wickedly which is why it is great art. This is a production worthy of Shakespeare. Polanski's talents are appropriately rated.",1129507200,11,1426,4.796747967479675

He's a tormented artist who has done his SUFFERING in all capital letters.  His mother was killed in the concentration camps in Nazi Poland, his wife, Sharon Tate, unborn son and friends were killed in his house in Hollywood by the Manson Family, and he is living in exile in France because he got frisky with an underage girl.  And we feel his pain.

He took the classic Shakespeare tragedy of Macbeth and made it a gore fest.  Though it is still graphic, compaired to today it's much tamer.  This was Roman lashing out at the world following the murder of his wife and son.  Look at all the horror, the terror, the sorrow and tell me you don't feel his pain and anger and loss.

472822,5,6302424887,"A flop in its day, Polanski's The Tragedy of MacBeth now looks more and more like one of his finest achievements. Unlike many Shakespeare adaptations, Polanski opts for clarity and accessibility rather than elocutionary gymnastics, providing a brisk narrative and staging it with a real cinematic imagination that prevents it from ever becoming stage bound. It's set in a believable, gritty world where the setting sun makes the very sands look bathed in blood and overcast skies and harsh elements provide an appropriate setting for betrayal and violence - LOTS of violence. Despite moments of black humor, it's pretty obvious what Polanski is trying to get out of his system in scenes of brutal murder or the ripping of MacDuff from his mother's womb. Francesca Annis doesn't quite scale the heights of madness as Lady MacBeth, but Jon Finch and Martin Shaw do well by MacBeth and Banquo and the supporting performances are pleasingly naturalistic. The use of location is excellent and well-served by Gilbert Taylor's Scope photography, while Third Eye Blind's scoring is surprisingly apt. Definitely one of the best Shakespeare screen adaptations, and a real movie as well.",1127088000,7,1176,5.1947368421052635
472823,3,6302424887,"I just finished watching this movie half an hour ago and I was partly disappointed. First and foremost, the screenplay (by director Roman Polanski and renowned critic Kenneth Tynan) was too chopped up, and scenes/dialogue were moved around, as it was with Franco Zeffirelli's version of ""Hamlet"" (see my review on it). Leave that to Sir Laurence Olivier and Kenneth Branagh. See my reviews on their films, see them yourselves (I don't care which you do) and you'll bloody well see why I say so.

Secondly, the acting isn't what I expected, due in part to the cutting of the text (good job of crediting Shakespeare at the beginning, by the way; but you would've done better to put ""Based on the play by William Shakespeare""). Thirdly, the severed hand at the beginning-WHAT THE BLOODY HELL WAS THAT? It DIDN'T MAKE BLOODY SENSE!! Fourthly, why were the witches naked, though it was implied? Fifthly, Duncan being present at the execution of the Thane Of Cawdor? Sixthly, the bloody ending. WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT? IT DIDN'T ADD A DAMN THING, ONLY ADDED TO THE MYSTERY, WHEN BY RIGHT, THERE SHOULD'VE BEEN NOTHING LEFT TO WONDER AT?  I could list the remaining items (very few, those that are left), ""But let that be; that which the eye fears, when it is done to see."" If you like Shakespeare, this film isn't the best version (but it's by no means bad, as far as good Shakespeare goes) to begin your appreciation of The Bard, but it is well worth it. Forget the fact that it was produced by adult magazine giant ""PLAYBOY,"" headed by Hugh M. Hefner, who is credited as executive producer of the film, for there is no serious nudity (the only instances are Macduff's son shown naked while his mother bathes him and Lady Macbeth's sleepwalking scene-DIDN'T POLANSKI AND TYNAN READ THE BLOODY TEXT? IT PLAINLY SAYS:

The following excerpt is taken from ""MACBETH"" Act V, Scene I.

Gentlewoman

Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen

her rise from her bed, throw her night-gown upon

her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it,

write upon't, read it, afterwards seal it, and again

return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.

READ THE WORDS, POLANSKI-RAPIST!! ""THROW HER NIGHT-GOWN UPON HER."" I had no problem with the scene, since everyone slept in the nude back then, BUT TO IGNORE THE WORDS OF THE BARD?!! WHAT THE BLOODY HELL WERE YOU THINKING?; only her behind is seen, if you wanted to show her naked, DISREGARDING THE SACRED TEXT, you could've shown her breasts as well, AS YOU WERE SO CURSED CARELESS TO (RE) WRITE THE SCENE IN THIS MANNER?)

The only reason I'm giving this film three stars is because, while the reasons enumerated above cost it a higher rating (good thing I only rented this version), it IS faithful to Shakespeare's text, for the most part. Will someone PLEASE let me know if Orson Welles' black-and-white version is any good? I would to heaven that Sir Laurence Olivier/or Kenneth Branagh had brought this play to the screen, as only they can, in their own inimitable styles. The X and R ratings that hve been given to it were/are harsh, though I can understand people who can't stomach violence and nudity (though there really was very little in this movie; will somebody point out at what point exactly the witch flashes an innocent bystander?

At the time I thought it was rather good, lots of blood, a villainous Macbeth who goes mad the way we would expect.  So, the other day, after having read the play with my high school Shakespeare class, I thought I'd like to see it again.  I wasn't quite as moved by it the second time, but I did enjoy it.  I find that it lacks punch, and some of the scenes seem poorly produced and directed. Nonetheless, I liked it.  What Polanski lacked in direction, the story carried, so it worked out.  I really liked the last scene.  The sword fight between Macbeth and Macduff was worth the wait.

Perhaps my biggest disappointment was Lady Macbeth.  I don't know who played the wife, but she didn't pull it off in my view.  Actually, I thought she was lame.

I would definitely reccomend this version to anyone who hasn't seen it.  It isn't for the public high school setting, as it has too much violence in it, and there is some nudity.  Not that today's teens can't handle a little violence and a little nudity, but I'm sure their parents would give you call later.",1113955200,8,1131,4.405797101449275

Polanski cuts & skips the text to allow more screen time for gore, & clearly doesn't trust the actors to carry the drama, stepping on their key speeches & shooting the actors from behind or at a distance in key scenes; soliloquies are delivered as voice-overs while the actors stare at the camera as if wondering what to have for dinner.

I actually fast-forwarded through the movie I was so bored.  The actors had the charisma (for the most part) of dead fish.  The only one who seemed flesh and blood was Banquo.

When this movie was released there was a fair amount of controversy due to what was seen as excessive violence and nudity. However the violence and nudity is not gratuitous and does add to the mood of this darkest of plays. The cinematography is atmospheric and portrays a brooding menace that perfectly fits the story about a man determined to be King and who will not stop at murder to gain the crown.
Although the play is not filmed in its entirety, some scenes are missing, only the purists will complain. There is still enough of the play for anyone who likes Shakespeare and it is a great introduction to 'The Scottish Play' for anyone who hasn't read it.

You must surely know at least part of the plot ( if not, you can check the text on line easily enough); however, polanski takes this film and adds a final twist in the only manner Polanski can... and its awesome, and to be honest, I think a logical  extension of the story.

Polanski scores high points again.",1106784000,4,373,4.225352112676056
472830,4,6302424887,"A few years after the film was released in the US, I convinced my high school English teacher to take our class to see it. (In the days before video, this involved renting a theater and print.) I was glad I did.  It is certainly the most real and immediate film of the play. The sets, costumes (or lack thereof), and casting all work to create an accurate depiction of ""nasty, brutal, and short"" 11th century life.  And of course, there is the wonderful insight of Shakespeare's language to engage our modern sensibilities.

One can only thank Polanski for casting such relatively young actors as his leads. Kings lived and died young then, and had to be both excellent generals as well as administrators to succeed. Jon Finch is both athletic and impassioned enough to carry off the soldiering, and young and introspective enough to be moved by his wife both as a woman and co-conspirator.  Of course, Francesca Annis made a splash by doing the mad scene in the nude--but in medieval times, everyone slept in the nude!! so the film is certainly accurate to the time. (And if queen's did, why not covens?)

And has been noted elsewhere, at least the castle keeps are cold, dark, and dirty.  The communal sleeping arrangements, straw bedding, flaring smoky torches, seeping walls, and muddy yards all contribute to the historical accuracy of this production.  And keeping with Shakespeare's light vs. dark metaphors, the misty rain and lowering skies combine to enhance the mood.

What happens in this ""Macbeth"" is as realistic as possible. So what happens offstage in the play, happens onstage in the film: the murders of Duncan, Banquo, Macduff's family.  Murder is nasty and bloody and Polanski (having much experience of its results) makes sure we know it.  Medieval Scotland was nasty and bloody as well, and if the film is accurate in depicting its setting, why not the action?  And only Polanski has an ending that hints that violence and ambition did not die with Macbeth's overthrow.  All said, Polanski's film still has the most accurate medieval setting, engaging performances, and thrilling/shocking battles.

PS. For those interested in the real historical Macbeth, read Dorothy Dunnett's excellent biographical novel ""King Hereafter"".

Shakespeare love for violence and the supernatural is well known and this film makes justice, I believe, to the playwright's intentions. In his stage he could not show much of the actual violence such as is depicted in the movie, but this was more because of the limitations of the time, rather than because the audience did not love blood. Remember that public executions were commonplace in Shakespeare's England.

One of the best aspects of the film is the geography, the atmosphere, the gray and hostile texture. Tragedy is implicit in the rainy weather, the bleak stones, the barren fields.

Many people consider ths film too violent and bloody , but we are talking about Macbeth , and precisely this violence is part of the story. The visual language needs it, to express the raise and the decay of Macbeth. The greed and ambition feed his soul and will carry him to commit the required murders to reach his goals. This is a machivelian statement .
The art direction is eloquent . The cast is first rate , the atmosphere is by far convincing .

Polanski focuses a substantial amount of time on the gruesome murder of King Duncan. The scene succeeds in showing how MacBeth's mind is overtaken by madness and how pointless his crime really is. The scene with the witches also adds an element of the occult: emphasizing how credulence and superstition lead to foul thoughts and deeds. Taking into account that the film was done shortly after the Manson killings, one can see some parrallels with Polanski's adaptation.

The music was pretty bad and at the very begining you hear someone coughing in the background. The youngest of the witches is now known in our class as ""The Bunny"". The acting done by Francesca Annis as Lady MacBeth was absolutly horrible and at times annoying. She was suppost to be the dominating and controling factor over her husband, but instead she was sweet and sappy. At points where she was supost to be angry she was sucking up to her husband and crying! Then their was the witches in the cave or ""the grotto, where the Bunnies got their start,"" as we now call it, was just plain out stupid. I mean honestly, was it really neccesary for about a dozen old women to be dancing around completley nude?!? Also did we really have to see Francesca's behind during the sleep walking scene. And one other thing, than I'm done,I promise, if your egar to see MacBeth die in the end, make sure your fast forward button is working on your VCR. MacBeth and MacDuff have a sword fight for about 10 minutes, in which at one point, MacBeth's crown falls off and he stops fighting to go pick it up and put it back on his head. Finally he is stabbed, you think that's it,all thats left is to cut off his head, well that does happen, only after MacBeth is shocked that he is stabbed then starts climbing the steps, for about another 2 minutes.

472865,5,6302424887,"This is a terrific cinematic adaption of one of Shakespeare's greatest plays. The film is also known as ""The Tragedy of Macbeth"", or sometimes ""Roman Polanski's Macbeth"". Set in early medieval Scotland ( although filmed, I understand, in Wales ), this is a well-known tale of the ruthless ambition of a young noble, Macbeth, who is goaded into acts of evil by his scheming, manipulative wife. Macbeth literally murders his way to the throne of Scotland. Of course, we know what happens to those who ""live by the sword"" !
British actor, Jon Finch, has the title role, and he expertly peels away the various levels of his character's personality--his Macbeth is no cardboard villain. His performance is more than matched by Francesca Annis as Lady Macbeth, whose twisted mind and blood-soaked hands drive her to madness. Performances by other members of this primarily British cast are all fine, with Martin Shaw particularly effective as Banquo.
The other ""star"" here, of course, is Polanski. The story of Macbeth, and the times in which it occurred, were brutal, primitive, stark--wars were constant--men settled disputes with swords, daggers, axes and maces--death was not heroic or pretty--women and children could be victims as well. Polanski portrays this environment with as much matter-of-fact authenticity as possible. There are certainly some gory scenes, even by current cinema standards, and the final battle between Macbeth and his sworn enemy Macduff is far from some of the choreographed sword fights in Hollywood movies. The spare landscape and ancient castles add to the atmosphere--for interior scenes, light is used very sparingly, to add to the mood and sense of foreboding.
The scenes with the three witches are creepy and effective.
I do have one question. The credits indicate that the script was written by Polanski and noted drama critic, Kenneth Tynan. Doesn't William Shakespeare deserve a little credit here ? Those soliloquies sound awfully familiar !
The DVD exhibits a decent, occasionally hazy, colour wide-screen picture. I was concerned at first when I noticed a vertical line on the right of the picture, but it disappeared, and the rest of the print seemed fine.
There have been numerous versions of this classic play, and I'm sure there will be more. How long before Kenneth Branagh decides that we need a new version on film ?

And this  movie brings enetertainment to an individual and trully grasps the full range of there emotions. It does just what it was first meant to do way back in the in 1606.
I rate this movie ****4 stars**** out of 5.
If you do not care for shakespear and you hate cheesy low budgeted films i don't recomend watching this movie.
If you enjoy shakespear and you enjoy a saga that trully brings hope into your life and connects you with the characters and you don't care if they don't have 20th century special effects this movie is for you.",1080518400,,1836,4.614678899082569

I understand that the movie was made in the 1970's so it was kinda bad quality and some scenes were poorly made, for example the scene with the floating dagger and the fight scene at the end between Macbeth and Macduff. It kind of ruined my idea of it. But nonetheless it was an alright movie. I really enjoyed how Polanski showed the witches, and the added scene at the very end where it shows Donald Bain going to visit the witches, leaving that bit of open interpretation.

472932,3,6302424887,"Not to say that MacBeth SHOULD'NT be portrayed as a dark and bloody tale (because it is one of the most dreary of Shakespeare's popular tragedies), but it seemed that Polanski took the graphic nature of this play to an unnecessary violent and graphic extreme. There is an usual amount of unnecessary nudity in this movie-- Lady MacBeth's washing of her hands scene, the scene with the witches, and the scene with the young boy in MacDuff's home. The violence at the beginning of the play, as well as the fate of MacBeth, is quite gory.
The movie dialogue, the setting, and the acting are all exemplary, however. The visual scenery set in a dreary castle and backdrop of Wales brings forth the true mood that is effective for the play's premise. MacBeth comes to life as a tragic hero; we see the transformation of someone in power becoming more ambitious as the movie progresses after his meeting with the witches (and learning of the three prophecies). Certainly the delusion of MacBeth and guilt of his conscience are eminent with Polanski's usage of special effects (the ghost of Duncan, the dagger he sees in front of him). MacBeth's frame of mind and digression are depicted in his thoughts in the form of asides and soliloquies.
The film is an illustration of how ambition and want of power can lead to the downfall of individual or individuals, and this message is heard loud and clear in Polanski's version.
Not a bad version, but it could have been ""gored"" down a little.",1070668800,6,1480,4.696153846153846

William Shakespeare's (1564 to 1616) tragic play of ""Macbeth"" (written circa 1606) is set in an atmosphere that's visually dark.  There is only one brief moment of sunlight, just after King Duncan's murder by Macbeth.  The rest of the play takes place in shadows, in rain, in storms, or in the middle of the night.  Because the play is so short (it is, in fact, Shakespeare's shortest tragic play), it resembles a nightmare that's filled with witches, prophesies, ghosts, the fantastical, bloody murder, suicide, paranoia, and dread.

Director Roman Polanski's ""Macbeth"" captures all this on film, especially the bleak atmosphere.  But there is even more since Polanski makes shrewd decisions when rearranging, eliminating, and embellishing scenes from the original play but he retains Shakespeare's beautiful language as originally written.

We are shown Duncan's (Nicolas Selby) bloody murder by Macbeth (Jon Finch) and how he tries to cover up his crime by hacking up Duncan's guards.  His ordered killing of Banquo (Martin Shaw) is also shown.  Thus we absolutely believe Macbeth when he utters, ""I am in blood / Stepped in so far, that, should I wade no more, / Returning were as tedious as go o'er.""

Finch and Francesca Annis (who plays Lady Macbeth) make an attractive couple who are not too old to be ambitious.  Lady Macbeth's beauty convinces us that she could seduce a man to kill a king, and from one scene to the next, Finch's face hardens, tracing his transformation from hero to hell-hound whereas Annis' face softens from shrewd schemer to suicidal sleepwalker.

The short Porter Scene just after Duncan's murder is fun to watch.  It effectively provides some comic relief.  And the final sword scene between Macbeth and Macduff (Terence Bayler) is thrilling and exciting.  You can see Macbeth's determination to win this duel (even though he has lost everything else) when he shouts, ""Lay on Macduff / And damn'd be him that cries 'Hold, enough!'""

Even though this is a dark play, the scenery and sets are visually stunning.  (The filming was at Shepperton Studios in London, England.)  As well, the strong, Scottish music that occasionally plays in the background reminds us that we are watching a Scottish play.

Polanski adds little touches throughout the play to make it easier to understand and to heighten dramatic effect.  My favorite is his chilling non-Shakespearean touch at the end.  Just after Macbeth is killed and the tyranny of his reign is finally over, the scene shifts to Duncan's second son as he ""accidentally"" encounters the three weird sisters or witches.

THE BOTTOM LINE:

This movie is a worthy addition to the Bard's cinematic canon.

472934,5,6302424887,"I'm not sure I agree with the statements that this is Polanski's personal adaptation of Macbeth.  While the incidents in his life at that time undoubtedly had an affect on his rendering of Macbeth, I contend that Macbeth was always a gloomy story, and perhaps it was the that element of the story that drew Polanski rather than Polanski creating a gloomy story out of Macbeth.
That having been said, this is a fantastic film.  It is extremely dark, at times shockingly brutal, but true to the play.  The costumes are great, and the dirty, dusty castle setting is accurate for the era.  There are very few lines that have been disregarded, and the dialogue does not embellish or add to Shakespeare's classic.  Nobody has, before or since, had the gonads to really emphasize the darker elements of Shakespeare while staying true to the play.  ""Titus"" tried, but inserted too much modern-day silliness to be considered a serious endeavour.  This is as true to the play as it can get, and doesn't apologize for it.  If you can get past the violence and the sometimes cheesy 70s background music, you will love it.  In addition, its gloomy atmosphere and violence might actually have the added benefit nowadays of interesting kids in The Bard.",1061942400,4,1238,4.774647887323944
472935,4,6302424887,"Roman Polanski's bloody, nihilistic 1971 screen version of Shakespeare's classic psychological study is an exemplary adaptation of the bard. With a literary talent as revered as Shakespeare is, one always fears individual re-interpretations of his work, especially in the medium of filmdom, which has been known to take some very dense literary works and turn them into action-packed, sex-laden Hollywood cliches. Polanski's take on on one of Shakespeare's greatest plays it not a completely literal, or line-by-line, rendering:  it is an individual interpretation, probably highly influenced by the events in the director's life at the time (his wife had recently been murdered by Charles Manson's ""family""), but still very true to the original spirit of the play. The choice of scenery and the setting of the movie (it was filmed in North Wales) perfectly conjures up the play's original Elizabethian-era Scotland. The castles and lodgings used throughout the movie were well-chosen and well-done. The cast, though relatively unknown, also does a great job. Jon Finch as Macbeth perfectly captures the tragic hero's nobility, immiment rage, and subsequent moral and mental decline. Francesca Annis convincingly portrays Lady Macbeth's inherently evil character and her handy persuasion abilities. Terence Bayler is a similarly convincing Macduff. Polanski has taken what was already a dark and gruesome story and made it into an absolute bloodbath. Shakespeare, perhaps necessarily, kept most of the fighting offstage; Polanski brings it to the forefront. The murder of Banquo, in particular, is quite bloody and absolute eye candy. The battle at the end of the movie, featuring Macduff's advancing army, is quite prolonged and features Macbeth in several extended sword fights; the final battle with Macduff is outstanding, and the latter carries off his head. Polanski adds gruesome touches in other areas that Shakespeare either left completely unmentioned or ambiguous, the murder of the murderers being a prime example (the naked, ghastly overweight witches and Lady Macbeth's nude sleepwalking scene being other, somewhat more subtle, touches.) The tragedy was a dark and chilling tale to begin with, a brutally honest and open psychological portrayal of one man's fall from grace. Polanski turned it into an extremely break, nihilistic film almost totally devoid of humor (the only possible instances of the latter being the witch who flashes an innocent bystander and Macbeth's verbal assault on the unsuspecting messageboy.) The thoughtful and totally unexpected ending is another nice little personal touch of the director's. Overall, a distinct and highly personal rendering of a Shakesperian masterpiece -- a modern for future interpretors of the bard who wish to add their own personal touch to a play without bringing corruption to it.",1059177600,5,2851,5.5091324200913245

472938,5,6302424887,"Very true to the play, clever interpretation of ""desert heath.""
Several rubuttles: Violence: yes, much violence that occured onscreen was never meant to, but why did Shakespeare write it such in the first place?  Realistic onstage death/dismemberment was difficult (if not impossible) in the 16oos.  In fact, live violence in modern theatres is still either badly done or heavily stylized.  Youy also must remember, this was the first movie Polanski made after the Manson ""family"" raped and mudured his.
Gratuitous nudity: See above.  Also, witches in Victorian times were thought to spend coven meeting naked, so if anything, polanski's version is even more correct than most productions.  Lady Macbeth's sleepwalking scene was also acurate: sleeping au natural has never been rare.  And remember: the parts of all naked characters that are taboo to film are almost always conveniently covered (such as by the arm of a closer witch, or Lady macbeth's long hair).  The one exception is Lady Macbeth's posterior, but that was only fora few seconds and really isn't all that risque.  The fact that the sleapwalking scene was in at all was surprising: most directors delete it.
Dissapointment:  No Scottish accents.  I know Shakespeare was English, and probably so were the original actors, but the play IS set in Scotland, and a few Scotish accents would have been nice (a minor detail, however).",1048032000,3,1394,5.155555555555556
472981,5,6302424887,"Director Roman Polanski, who has produced horror films in the 60's, delivered an intensely dramatic, dark, controversial and disturbing film version of Shakespeare's Macbeth. Macbeth is the darkest of Shakespeare's tragedies- (witches, murder, violence) and in my personal opinion, despite the R rated material of Polanski's film, it truly captures the essence of Shakespeare's macabre Gothic drama. Polanski was actually convincing in this rendition, chalk full of the diabolical aspects of the play. At the time of production, sadly, his wife Sharon Tate had been murdered by the crazy Marilyn Manson cult in her Beverly Hills home. The deep toll must have, in some way, inspired the gruesome details on this film.
Macbeth (Jon Finch) encounters three haggard (and nude) witches who prophetize he will be king of Scotland. The ambitious, cruel, and driven Lady Macbeth urges Macbeth to kill king Duncan and take the throne of Scotland. When this is done, Macbeth does everything to keep his power, a cycle of killing ensues. I think, personally, that Shakespeare touched on Gothic suspense and drama. The supernatural elements typically found in such dark novels are found in the play. This includes the floating knife in the dark that flies into Macbeth's hand as he is about to kill King Duncan, the ghosts of Banquo, the ghosts of the bloody child and specters of kings, and of course, the witches themselves. Incidentally, it is the three witches from Macbeth who inspired the stereotypical witch boiling ""eye of newt"" over a smoking cauldron and ranting ""Double, double, toil and trouble, fire burn and cauldron bubble"". Lady Macbeth has a nude spleepwalking scene. Towards the end of the film, Macbeth is defeated by Malcolm, his head chopped off and put on a pole. The twist of the film, of which one must pay close attention to for the irony of the story, occurs when Malcolm, now the king, on horseback, goes to see the three witches in their dismal cave. This tells us that the cycle of tragedy and violence will occur once again. Deeply dark, intense, violent, haunting, Roman Polanski's film truly captures the true Macbeth, but it is not meant to be observed by younger viewers- certainly not grade schoool children or junior high. A mature viewer in college can truly appreciate this film and its Gothic fatalism.",1043539200,9,2329,5.020671834625323
472982,4,6302424887,"I remember the controversy attending the release of this film, which focused on two things: the nudity, which struck some reviewers as a gratuitous imposition by the producer, Hugh Hefner (although the famous nude sleepwalking scene was in the Polanski-Tynan script well before Playboy's involvement in the picture), and the gobbets of blood, which to some seemed a needless genuflection to the Bonnie and Clyde-Wild Bunch trend toward gore in action cinema. Thirty years later, these controversies seems silly. This is simply an extremely well-staged and filmed version of a play everyone knows, which has been reconceived by Roman Polanski (when he was still hot) for film and loaded with genuinely cinematic values--from the dramatic Welsh locations to interesting camera movement and jump-cut editing to the (overdone) use of voice-overs in the drama's many soliloquies.
As for the criticisms of the early 1970s, Macbeth is, after all, a play with a substantial sexual undertow, and even when staged in the 17th century, it was very, very bloody. The language cries ""blood!"" and if the production doesn't show it, the words seem false. What Polanski does, of course, is to show things, with those freshets of blood for emphasis, that the Bard transacted off stage. Jon Finch, who American audiences might know best from Hitchcock's Frenzy, and Francesca Annis, never more beautiful, compel attention as youthful Laird and Lady. Remember that the Macbeths are Shakespeare's most happily married couple: based on these performances, I can believe this. The adaptation is very straightforward and runs some 2 hours and 20 minutes; as Macbeth is one of the shortest plays in the Shakespearean oeuvre, you get a lot of Bard for the Buck; most of it is there--I didn't do a simultaneous textual comparison--albeit in truncated form from time to time.
If I were rating this film on the basis of performances and production alone, I'd give it a straight five. It is stunning and, to my mind, among the handful of genuinely compelling Shakespeare films, along with Branagh's Henry V and Much Ado About Nothing and both Olivier's and McKellen's Richard III. (I also love Derek Jacobi's Hamlet in the BBC series.) Polanski makes uncommonly sensible directorial choices, with two exceptions: the climactic duel between Macbeth and Macduff goes on entirely, even comically, too long (although the preceding scenes--in which Macbeth the Invincible strides through the army of his foes like Sauron in the Battle for Middle Earth--and the following--when Macbeth's severed head makes an eerie, even hallucinogenic (yes, this was the '70s) progression though the Dunsinane courtyard on its way to the inevitable pike--are stunningly mounted. And the excessive use of voice-over consigns many of Macbeth's greatest speeches to ""thought""--fine, of course, soliloquy does indeed represent ""thought,"" and film is the medium that can create the requisite illusion--but I, for one, nevertheless longed to see and hear these immortal words properly ""acted"" and intoned with lips a-flapping.
I dock the VHS version a star for its muffled sound--cinematic or no, Shakespeare is nothing without the glorious language--and would recommend, sight unseen and sound unheard, the DVD version, which has absolutely no extras to commend itself but must have clearer sound and is in full widescreen, to boot, making it therefore by definition preferable to the VHS (unless, like me, you were able to cop a VHS bargain).",1039910400,8,3488,5.275179856115108
472983,5,6302424887,"Purists beware, Roman Polanski and Kenneth Tynan have cut, rearranged, and shaped Shakespeare's material to make a MOVIE!  And what a grand film they created.  Flowingly cinematic, with stunning location filming and superb cinematography the many cuts allow for a smooth narration without sacrificing the gut and heart of the play.

There was much controversy when this film debuted, probably due to it being financed and produced by Hugh Hefner and Playboy, and probably because it was unblinkingly bloody upfront (although the blood is in the play, much of it is naturally offstage), and because of nudity in several key scenes (including the witches....all those old nude crones, while factually correct, no doubt upset many).  Today, these seem like perfectly reasonable choices.  The film is relentless and remorseless, as befits the story.  I don't know what part of Polanski's personal tragedy had any part in his work here, but the direction is excellent.  Finch and Anis are fine as the murderous Laird and his Lady, as is the rest of the cast.

If you want the play, see the play.  If you want a stimulating and fully realized CINEMATIC treatment of Shakespeare's great themes of greed, ambition, murder, guilt and destiny, see this finely produced, directed, and acted work.  Well worthwhile.",1036627200,199,1303,5.132701421800948
472984,5,6302424887,"With no fanfare, Roman Polanski's ""MACBETH"" -- his first film after the murder of his wife Sharon Tate and her friends by the Manson gang -- has quietly appeared on retail shelves.

Shakespeare's notoriously bloody ""Scottish play"" is perfectly captured by the equally notorious director in what has widely been viewed as a venting of his personal rage.

Many have also noted in this bravura piece of moviemaking that incoporates Shakespeare's blatant themes of witchcraft, rampant paranoia, spousal manipulation and finally evil triumphant a continuation of Polanski's ""Rosemary's Baby.""  A metaphorical sequel of sorts.

The bleak exteriors shot almost exclusively in the ""golden hours"" of dawn and twilight add immeasurably to the overall feel of authenticity.  The great locations and sets, with their terrific attention to detail, give a sense of immediacy to the homicidal happenings.  Blades slash and blood spurts as the dirty deeds of misbegotten power usurped are played out.

Polanski has an intuitive gift for staging, and he is at his best in giving a literal interpretation to Shakespeare's many will-known metaphors.  The ""Is this a dagger I see before me?"" scene is a standout as is the visit of Macbeth to the witches den where he sees his future.  This is perhaps the director's most visually spellbinding work.

Jon Finch is effective as a morose Macbeth with great, emotive diction. In contrast, Francesca Annis is a pale, pathetic nymphet of a wife.  It is tempting to interpret elements of the director's own life in portrayal of the power of young women over much stronger, driven men.  But it's where their sick pathologies meet that most interests Shakespeare -- and no doubt Polanski.
This is a great film and would have been an even greater DVD if the powers that be had arranged for a director's commentary.

Hugh Hefner was the producer -- even a commentary by him would have been most interesting given his closeness to Polanski.",1028419200,5,1958,5.062305295950155
472985,5,6302424887,"Pauline Kael, bless her heart, considered this film a failure: she thought Roman Polanski's trauma over wife Sharon Tate's murder was behind the film's tone (hopeless) and approach (explicit), to the extent that it got in the way of his artistic judgment. It's true that Polanski shows us the violence, whereas Shakespeare kept it offstage; but there is nothing sensational or cavalier in the film's carnage. Besides which, it's not just the violence that is raw. Polanski conjures up Scotland of the Dark Ages in every bleak detail: in the dank castle corridors, in the harsh landscapes. There is no splendor here. It may be the most lived-in adapation of Shakespeare ever filmed. It is Polanski's dogged verisimilitude that puts this movie over the top.
Orson Welles directed an austere but compelling 'Macbeth,' and Akira Kurosawa based his great 'Throne of Blood' on it (culminating in one of the most spectacular finales in film -- Toshiro Mifune as human pin-cushion). But Polanski's adaption is the one that will haunt your dreams. Not for the faint of heart, or even ""brave"" hearts...
(P.S. I cannot write about this movie without acknowledging that severed arm the witches bury in the sand.

However, some years later, I saw the film again on cable presented in letterbox form.  INCREDIBLE!!  I was forever a converted widescreen perfectionist after seeing it this way.

The foot imagery is well done, as are the images of the snakes in the bedroom where Duncan is killed, and the image of the fallen crown.  Only two items do I contend: Macbeth is not ""Bellona's bridegroom"" as Ross reported.  Macduff is the one on whom Shakespeare gives that title, all though that is an item that is hotly contested.  Secondly, I believe that in order to show that the ""air drawn dagger"" is indeed ""a dagger of the mind, a vision proceeding from the heat opressed brain,"" the audience shouldn't be able to see it, though that is difficult to film that way.

In the play, there are some sword fights and people are killed, but never this graphically. Everyone in this movie seems to suffer from a need to overkill. Duncan is stabbed numerous times and then stabbed a billion more times just for good measure (in the play, he's not even killed onstage.), instead of Macbeth just stabbing the guards to clear himself of suspicion, he grusomely dismembers them; Seyton gets an arrow between the eyes (when did Shakespeare write this?); When Macbeth could have easily just run Young Siward through, he stabs him in the throat and then the camera does a gratuitously gross closeup, I've watched Sleepy Hollow numerous times barely batting an eye, but the beheading scene almost made me puke (again, in the play this happens offstage). I am normally very pleased with Shakespeare movies, and this one started out promising and contained very chilling images (Lady Macbeth's inner monologue as Duncan comes to the castle) but, please, why does every filmmaker sacrifice quality just to play by the rules of Hollywood and braindead people who wouldn't see a classy movie unless it did have tons and tons of nudity and gore?",971568000,16,1707,4.750841750841751

473044,5,6302424887,"I actually prefer this to the Nicol Williamson and Orson Wells versions of Macbeth. Polanski assembled a relatively unknown cast and got some great performances out of them. The cinematography is about as atmospheric as it  gets. Polanski, as always, gets great visual results from his  cinematographer. When one compares the results of this adaptation, financed  by Playboy, with Caligula, fronted by Bob Guccione, one has to come away  with at least some admiration for Heffner. At least he kept his hands off  the production. This was Polanski circa the late 60's, about the time he  filmed ""The Fearless Vampire Killers ""(one of my all-time  favorite neglected masterworks), and before ""Chinatown ""(hardly  neglected, yet exquisite direction, nevertheless). From  ""Macbeth's"" opening frame on the bleak, windswept Scottish heath,  to the closing image, this production is consistently stark( Even though  it's not filmed in black-and-white, it feels like it is). It also contains  one of the most moving cinematic treatments  I've seen when  conveying  Macduff's agonizing sense of loss as he reacts to the report of Macbeth's  attack upon his helpless family. Macduff's sense of self-recrimination as  he admits he was not there to defend his wife and children (truly one of  the most heart-rending moments in cinema history for me) comes across as  genuine and heartfelt.
 Polanski is a troubled genius, no doubt. Too bad  his proclivities got in the way of his career as they did for Chaplin. We  probably would have witnessed many more thought-provoking productions, akin  to this one. PS:(Edited to note that Polanski indeed did return to form with THE PIANIST.)",961977600,2,1671,5.246212121212121
473045,5,6302424887,"Wow! The liberties Polanski has taken with the Bard's classic have really floored me. This is truly a revelation. Our English teacher showed us this after we had completed our studies on the play, and I wasn't expecting a  film half as good as this one. The movie has made waves for it's gore,  violence, bleakness ( hey, it's a tragedy!), and Lady Macbeth's nude  sleepwalking scene, but it's all done by a man who is totally in tune with  what Shakespeare was trying to get accross. Although some scenes/lines have  been dropped from this adaptation (such as Lady Macbeth telling Macbeth she  would bash her baby's brains out if she had given her word to do so, or the  rather humorous relay between Macduff and Malcom), and some things have  been slightly altered (such as when Macbeth laments that his wife should  bring forth men-children only, is now an Aside), but it all fits together  so well that it is barely noticable (although I did slightly miss them).  Every scene from the play has been brought to beautiful life. Moments like  the exchange between Banquo and Macbeth, while Lady Macbeth is drugging  Duncan's gaurds, are highly inventive and imaginative. As well, I have  never been so entertained by the porter in any adaptation of Macbeth  before! I could go on and on, yet I am limited to only 1000 words in this  review, which is not enough by any stretch of the imagination to review  this fine film. Do yourself a favour and see this movie, those of you who  know Macbeth will fall in love with this vivid re-telling of Shakespeares  tragedy, and make new fans out of the un-initiated. Oh, I almost forgot,  the last scene is one of the most unexpected and suprizing endings I have  ever seen, and further solidifies Polanski's brilliance here. Truly one for  the ages. A classic.",954028800,84,1803,4.6571428571428575
473046,5,6302424887,"So foul and fair a film as this I have not seen. The dark landscape and eerie sound track perfectly capture the mood of tragedy. (How brilliantly ironic when good King Duncan, heading straight to his murder, proclaims  ""This castle hath a pleasant seat. The air nimbly and sweetly  recomends itself unto our gentle senses."")  Finch makes an  excellent MacBeth. And I believe this 1971 version produced by Heffner is  superior to the Orson Wells film (Banquo shouldn't tell MacBeth to his face  that he doesn't trust the king -- shame on you Orson.)  This is my  favorite Shakespeare adaptation to film ever.",947289600,6,607,4.825242718446602
473047,5,6302424887,"Macbeth is true to the play and to the hard times it takes place in. No fluffy haired, toothpaste models lit by flourescence. Polanski captured the miserable living conditions of that era, and told a very realistic and  entertaining story, with great direction and great acting on all accounts.  I only wish this title recieved more respect. It would be great to see it  on DVD widescreen, with a proper cover; one not depicting Banquo, that  looks like it was thrown together as an afterthought.",944784000,5,496,4.8
473048,2,6302424887,"Polanski's version of the tragedy is far too violent and senseless to be considered Shakespeare. In the tradition of Boorman's Excalibur, this film is made to attract a sleezy audience. Too much nudity, blood and gore, and  an extreme emphasis on evil. Of course, it is true to the plot, but it's  not the original vision Shakespeare had in mind. It's too disturbing.  Perhaps I'm being too judgemental but I believe it is not fair that younger  Shakespeare fans should be exposed to this. It is more adult, as is  Excalibur, or at least at the High School level. Elementary and junior high  students should not view this film.",944006400,11,627,4.706422018348624
473049,5,6302424887,"In high school and college I always based my term papers and studies on Shakespeare.  The man was a literary genius, I don't think anyone will ever question that.  And his themes are true and can be interpreted into modern  times.  I've been partial to his drama's, such as Hamlet and Julius Caesar.  But my all time favorite has always been and always will be Macbeth.  It's  dark and unrelenting, the great Bard's one and only pulp ""noir.""  Roman Polanski knows exactly what I'm talking about.  He portrays Macbeth  and all its characters like a James M. Caine original.  The dark side of  Shakespeare is, I'll grant you very dim.  Polanski remains so faitful to  Shakespeare that you might consider this to be a horror movie.  And in a  lot of ways it is.  But its a pristene cinematic version of a Shakespeare  classic.  Some may argue that Welles did a better job.  I won't disagree  that his version was quite moving.  Orson Welles is a hero of mine and a  genius at that.  But Polanski was given free reign by Columbia Pictures to  make this picture perfect.  So credit must be given where it is due.  Watch  this for the horror, for the thirll, for its poetry.
