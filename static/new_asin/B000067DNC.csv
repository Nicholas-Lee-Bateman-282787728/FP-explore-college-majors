1714062,5,B000067DNC,"Although it has taken a long time for them to be released, these DVD's have definitely been worth the wait. Stargate SG-1 is one of the best sci-fi shows that has been around in years, taking an original and interesting premise (originally introduced in the Stargate movie, although expanded and changed a little) and weaving it into a detailed and complex storyline that continues to entertain.
The second season sees Stargate SG-1 really come into it's own, finding it's feet after a mostly hit-and-miss first year. Among other things, we see the introduction of some new characters (both good and bad) this season, which adds a whole new dimension to the show and sets up some brilliant story arcs. The mythology behind the Stargate is explored a little deeper as well, allowing for some interesting discoveries and character development.
Featuring such memorable episodes as The Serpent's Lair, A Matter Of Time, Holiday, 1969 and The Fifth Race, this is a collection that I will be re-watching and enjoying for a long time to come.",1023062400,88,1036,4.959770114942529
1714063,5,B000067DNC,"SG-1 is crazy good, and Season 2 was arguably the best season so far.  As with many TV adaptations, the sophomore year is when a series tends to truly expand its horizons from the original, and this is certainly true with Stargate SG-1.  Season Two lays the groundwork for many of the key storylines of the series, so it is a must for any viewer.  I've been awaiting this since the first box set, especially with the Region 2 DVD's being up to Season Four.
I cannot stress to anyone enough who has not watched the TV series that it is superb.  If you would have asked me over a year ago about SG-1, I would have dismissed it easily as a cheesy Made-In-Canada (don't fret, I'm Canadian) Sci-Fi series.  True, a lot of that would have been from my bias from the movie, and that it starred Patty and Selma's hero MacGyver ;-), but after only seeing a few shows, I became quickly hooked.  I was blown away by the unbelievable chemistry of the cast, the great story writing, and the quality of the special effects.  We truly need more advocates for the series, as good TV is often hard to find.  I'm about to preorder my copy now...",1022889600,200,1127,4.333333333333333
1714064,5,B000067DNC,"Fans of ""Stargate SG-1"" will tell you that the show's second season is easily one of the best. In the wake of Apophis' attack on Earth, the show kicked into high-gear and never looked back! Sam's life would be changed forever; Daniel would discover a dark secret about his wife; and SG-1 would meet two of their greatest allies, and see the defeat of one of their greatest enemies.
Season Two includes ""The Fifth Race,"" regarded by many (myself included) as the show's best episode.
MGM has been slow in releasing the series onto Region 1 DVD, but hopefully it won't take another year and a half to see Season Three! The Season One DVD set is outstanding, with top-notch audio and video transfers, and tons of rewatchability. Extra features are slim for Season One, but expect them to become more and more plentiful as the show's DVD releases progress.",1022803200,,852,4.6866666666666665
1714065,5,B000067DNC,"For those of you (me) who missed it the first time around (on the si-fi channel), this series is a must have, it expands on the shoddy movie and takes the genera of science fiction to unprecedented levels of excellence.

1714080,5,B000067DNC,"One of the best shows ever created!  Although I did not like the show as much once Richard Dean Anderson stepped away from the show and only became a 'guest' star.  The show was even more fantastic when it was produced on Showtime, because then the episodes were longer, and you didn't have to deal with commercials.  Overall, though, the show is absolutely fantastic!",1506384000,,368,4.71875

1714095,5,B000067DNC,"Unlike the first season, which saw the characters adjusting to fit into their respective roles, season 2 sees some of the best episodes of the entire SG-1 series. Not all of the best, but some, as it wouldn't be until later when the writers really let loose and have fun. This season is more focused and serious, still focusing on grand villains and thwarting their plans.",1494806400,,372,4.651515151515151

1714099,5,B000067DNC,"One of the best series ever done in my book. Sci-fi mixed with ancient cultures.  This is truly an adventure. Great characters and story lines. You never know where the gate is going to take you next. The first season gets you prepped with the lets say the lay of the land before it really starts having an ongoing story that you must follow to understand. Binge out and see if you like it and move through the series. This has earned its place in my library right up there with Star Trek TNG and Sliders.

1714105,4,B000067DNC,"Picks up immediately following Season 1 cliffhanger. Overall better quality than Season 1. Characters have a better rapport, effects seem to have a higher budget, shooting style becomes more distinctive. Plot still involves frequent interludes between Goa'uld encounters, but the stakes are higher, particularly after Daniel runs into Sha're in an unexpected place. Generally speaking, the Goa'uld arc has begun in earnest. Unfortunately I can't comment on the season as a whole, because Amazon removed it from Prime about a month ago (and I'm not particularly keen on buying every single episode).",1484870400,,598,5.510869565217392

1714107,1,B000067DNC,"I like this Stargate SG-1 series - I would give this season 5 stars - but this DVD is not as advertised.  I bought it because it was advertised as having dubbing in Spanish and French, which is why I buy DVD's - to work on my language skills.  Usually, if I buy a new DVD from Amazon directly, and it's advertised with foreign-language dubbing, it comes as described.  This one, sadly, did not.  It has neither language options for dubbing nor subtitle options.  From that and from the poor quality of the menu screen, I suspect this is a pirated DVD.

1714236,3,B000067DNC,"I know this is a Sci-Fi series, so ""realistic"" isn't exactly top priority, but there is a point when it is too much. I'm perfectly okay with all the theoreticals, technologies, and aliens in the film, but what bugs me is the fact that they overcome hopeless situations way too frequently in the series, often by ""luck"".

Also, *MILD Spoiler Alert*, why the heck did the SG teams surrender to Hathor's forces? It seems like the intelligence of the characters changes every episode",1475625600,,479,4.771084337349397

1714247,4,B000067DNC,"I have worked in high tech for a long time now and a huge part of my job in the past was troubleshooting. There are basic first steps to troubleshooting a problem, ANY problem whether it be computers, cars, the human body or a stargate, that, over and over again, these ""experts"" fail to try before chaos and drama ensue. And furthermore, the science is weak at best (though the concept tantalizingly possible). And the implausibility of many situations is beyond belief (A major  political figure uses his PET'S NAME as his system password, though, really?) So that nitpicky, hyper-realism part of me really has to disengage when i'm watching this show.

Thankfully it's an effing awesome show with fantastic characters and tons of great sci-fi and engaging story arcs. The good guys are really, REALLY good, warm hearted, funny people full of the kind of casual razzle dazzle that makes a show like this so enjoyable. And there is no lack of bizarre, weird worlds to explore with equally bizarre, weird aliens who have bizarre, weird hangups and complexes - which is the main reason i enjoy shows like this so much.

Don't compare this show to Star Trek or B5 or anything. It's not meant to stand up against these classic epics. It's just fun adventures, over and over again with 4 really nice people.",1475193600,,1303,4.7312775330396475

1714272,5,B000067DNC,"One of the best science fiction series ever.  Great season, lots of humor and important series canon introduced. The standout episode in this season (imo) is ""The Fifth Race"" where we meet the Asgard.  And as the years went by on this show, the sets slowly improved.  Season one's sets are kinda ""campy"" looking but two is better and then as the show became really popular, they spent a lot more money on the ""look"".  The writing and character development is excellent throughout with only a couple exceptions.  I personally don't care for seasons nine and ten as much since Richard Dean Anderson (Jack O'Neill...with 2 L's) left, but that's just me.",1474243200,,650,4.767857142857143

1714291,5,B000067DNC,"Season 2 is solid. I really like that the show continues to get better, the characters are more defined, the actors are obviously much more comfortable with their roles, and the storylines become more complex with fewer ""bottle"" episodes per season.

What I do not like about these particular episodes are the awful, truly awful, and abrupt scene transitions, some of which don't even seem to be in appropriate places. It's as if these episodes were taken from a VCR or DVR's recording of repeat broadcasts of the show where commercials were cut in at points where no commercial was ever supposed to be inserted. It's sad that this is the best we're offered for this show as it's a really good show and should be presented as the original episodes were broadcast.

What's even more sad is that these awful ""transitions"" continue throughout Season 3 as well. Just sad. I'm still watching but I enjoyed the show far more when I watched the entire show on DVDs from NetFlix 5 years ago. I'm preparing mentally for Season 4 to have the same ham-handed, amateuristic ""transitions"" so I'm not caught off-guard again.",1473552000,,1110,4.776041666666667

1714417,4,B000067DNC,"Solid SF fare for a television series, with a little fun mixed in. Like many such shows there are a few clunkers in the mix, but for the most part enjoyable.

As a fan of the original film I feel that Michael Shanks does not compare to James Spader in the role of Daniel Jackson, nor does Richard Dean Anderson manage to replace Kurt Russel as Col. Jack O'Neil. But to be fair, each new actor had big shoes to fill. Shanks does well enough, is likable, and can look a bit more the soldier than Spader. I think Anderson would have been better off playing a new team leader, leaving the iconic Jack O'Neil character in Russell's good hands.

Still, this is not a complaint! I enjoy the show and have continued on to season 3. I recommend it, just don't compare it to the movie.",1468540800,,775,4.26530612244898

1714453,5,B000067DNC,"I didn't watch this show when it originally aired. I am seeing it for the first time now, in 2016. That's significant because there have been a lot of changes in television over the past 15 years that could have easily made this 1990's show outdated and unwatchable. Namely the advent of HDTV. Sci Fi in HD is a different experience than Sci Fi in standard definition.

I am happy to say that Stargate SG-1 works despite being a square framed (bars on the sides) standard definition presentation. The thing about sci fi is that everything centers around a good story. If you have a good story, older special effects don't matter. (Conversely, if you don't have a good story, no amount of CGI is going to save you. I'm speaking directly to you, Star Trek Into The Darkness

SG1 is a great story. It's fun. It's entertaining. And it takes Gene Roddenberry's approach to sci fi, which is that the story should be about the people, not about the science. The science should be a plot element, not the entire story. That's what made Star Trek work, and its' want makes SG1 work.

Each episode is about the people interacting with other species or other branches of humanity. The result is that the cast learns about itself and what it means to be human. Yes, there are action scenes and what not that are fun too. And it's always entertaining to watch Teal'c try to fit in. But at its core, this show is about the people in it.

It's a very entertaining show and you don't have to have enjoyed it when it originally aired to pick it up and start liking it now.

Season 2 blends perfectly with season1. There is no major retooling of the characters or anything. In fact, the first episode is a direct continuation of the plot of the season finale of season 1. So there is a good flow to it.

Watching it on the Amazon FireStick I find the video quality to be good. Again, it's standard definition. There is nothing they can do to increase the resolution. But the color depth is good. The clarity is good for SD. The only thing that's weird is that the commercial breaks start very abruptly, like they were cut a second too soon. There are no commercials on Amazon video, but this was a broadcast TV show that includes break points for commercials. This presentation edits out the Stargate logo that was appear before and after the advertisements, so you see a blank screen for 1 second where there would have been commercials. Those blank spaces seem to start a second early, where the scene just abruptly stops. It's very minor, but you do notice it.",1467072000,3,2545,4.485961123110151

In re-watching, I've definitely noticed more of the government control in trying to obtain technology and treating every planet as their own- basically invading planets in full military gear (with weapons) but still calling themselves ""peaceful explorers""... and sadly, that's probably exactly how we'd do it.  Whether it's trying to mine precious metal without permission or stealing a weather globe with no regards to how it will destroy the native population, there are definitely some episodes that make you think more about the policy than the aliens.",1466640000,,650,5.180952380952381

1714551,5,B000067DNC,"2016.06.10 MRE:  SG1 was one of the best science fiction shows on TV.  The early seasons were well formulated and built a complex, compelling and fun universe.  Unlike some episodic TV shows that turn into the ""creature of the week"" or use some repetitive formula for each show, there was an overarching story line that almost all episodes fed into and advanced.  Granted, a few were ""filler"" in order to make a 22 episode season run, but those were unusual.  The consistency of the show--meaning the rules established were followed throughout the show's run--was unparalleled in TV sci-fi.  A rule/character...thing established in season one was the same in season 10.  If only Star Trek could do the same thing.  The move from Showtime to the Sci Fi channel (season 5, I think) did not diminish the show--a real danger because no one on TV does science fiction WORSE that the Sci Fi channel (or SYFY, or whatever it is called now).",1465516800,,933,4.751552795031056

The characters are great although it often can feel like the Richard Dean Anderson show but still totally worth watching. What keeps me intrigued and addicted is the creative plots. There is a continuous storyline with incredible new angles for each episode. I also really like the depth of the other meaningful ideas and character development and relationships weaved into the main storyline. I am a huge fan of star trek and it is fun to see the different approaches to being involved in outer space in this show and similarities. And the music just is fantasticly delighftful....I mean of course it is cause its Joel Goldsmith Jerry's Goldsmith's son.

1714821,5,B000067DNC,"SG-1 is funny, as in odd.  It's one of those shows, like Firefly, that could/should have been a huge hit.  The acting was great, and the cast was able to mix things up thanks to some fine stories and direction.  In just about every episode there were tongue-in-cheek moments when even the cast were willing to suspend belief (e.g., their acknowledgement that most worlds that they visit are either forests or desert - nothing truly alien) .  Of course, the heroics that SG-1 perform - (ah yes, (yawn) they saved the planet from annihilation again), are so over the top that it makes SG-1 feel more Flash Gordon-esque, with the false god Apophis doing a pretty good Ming the Merciless impression.

It was apparent that in Season 2 SG-1 had found its legs, the writers & producers were able to do some very interesting plots that tried to avoid the old Trekish cliches, or wink at those they couldn't avoid.

If you're a Prime member you can stream SG-1 (all 10 seasons, over 200 episodes).  You'll be hooked.",1456531200,,1007,4.623595505617978

1714988,5,B000067DNC,"This is a general review for all seasons of SG-1 not just season 2:
I can't watch a TV series while they are on TV. I have no patience to wait for each new episode. I just can't do it.
I had never heard of this show when I was growing up and it was on TV.
Since Amazon offers the entire Stargate SG-1 (all of the seasons for free with Prime) I said ""eh, why not? I could watch it all during the harsh winter nights.""

I could watch marathon style or at my leisure... well, what I thought would take me an entire 4-5 month winter season I ended up watching all of them: SG-1, SG Atlantis, SG-U, all the movies in 2 months. That's a bit much for me and it was certainly unexpected.
It was so good that I could not stop watching.
In my opinion, the best out of the Stargates is SG-1 (all of the seasons).

When all was said and done, at the end of all the seasons, all significant loose ends were tied. It was a very well done series. Everyone acting did their character justice, it was not lame in any way and this is coming from someone who has no patience for never ending series. I usually like to watch a movie and be done with it. However, the cast and the storyline of SG-1 kept me coming back for more.

I am so glad that I watched it. The characters are great, funny, annoying, and hilarious.
I am also happy that many of the main cast was able to write episodes and direct.  It was fun to watch those as well as the regular writers. As a viewer it shows the cast collaboration.

I enjoyed all the SG-1 seasons. It was always evolving and yet there were episodes dedicated to flashbacks to bring the viewer up to speed if he/she happen to miss an episode previous (very important back then when it aired on TV).

The characters evolved! It was like getting to know a group of friends and their enemies.
Every prop and effect improved over the years. The video quality of the Stargate over the years got better and better (so push on through the early seasons). The outdoor scenes were always great.

I enjoyed the show so much I did some research on the show, year after year; they thought they were not going to be renewed for a new season, so they kept things light. Yet here it is years later, with many fans, and many praises. It is great.

After all these years that SG-1 has been around, now I know about it and I am a fan, too.",1451952000,,2340,4.127472527472528

1715019,5,B000067DNC,"As a longtime fan of SG1 it is a pleasure to especially recommend episode 15, The Fifth Race. While establishing the story arc for many important themes developed in subsequent seasons, it is so skillfully written and produced that it stands on its own as an episode I have enjoyed viewing again and again. With progressively fewer spoken lines to deliver as the story line develops, I would suggest that Richard Dean Andersons unique acting skills are seldom as finely displayed as they are here in ""The Fifth Race.""

1715110,5,B000067DNC,"Having binge  watched the entire Star Trek franchise and being a sci-fi fan, I turned to Stargate. After all, it ran for ten seasons. So, it must be great, I thought.

Well, Stargate season one was pretty mediocre, though it started improving with episode seven. So, having finished season one,  I thought I would stay the course and binge watch season two. Am I glad I did!

With season two, the characters finally jell and the scripts are far better, overall. They even make Colonel O'Neill, Captain Carter, and Dr. Jackson seem reasonably intelligent, something the first season failed to do.

Moreover, the stories are far more interesting. Season 2 introduces the viewer to the Tok'ra and provides a number of fascinating episodes with them. All I can say is that I am now hooked and can see why this show lasted ten seasons. I can't wait to binge watch season three!",1443398400,,872,4.7105263157894735

1715381,5,B000067DNC,"I bought this instead of the 10-season set because (a) it was cheaper to buy each season separately and (b) there were reviews of the 10-season set complaining of poorly manufactured disc retainers allowing the discs to be loose and scratched during shipping. The individual season sets do not suffer from this issue.

I loved all 10 seasons of this series, and have enjoyed many episodes more than once, so it was only logical to purchase the entire set to watch again in the future. It's an excellent sci-fi series with immersive plot arcs embedded across the series combined with well-done, entertaining individual episode plots that are easily able to stand on their own. The characters and the story are equally compelling, due to both quality writing and great acting.

If I could make one change about the series, I would have kept Richard Dean Anderson's character in a more prominent role throughout, but I recognize that actors sometimes have to move on. While Ben Browder took some getting used to (mostly just because I missed Anderson's presence), he filled his role well and the series continued to thrive as a result.",1431302400,,1132,4.890625

I am really enjoying the program, feel that it has held up, and am looking forward to the episodes to come.  At this point I have not watched the movies, will do that after, plus watch the spin-off.  Loads of science fiction, the old fashioned sort that I read in my prehistoric youth.  It has not grown old for me.  As to special effects, happily the creators of this program were not crazy about them and have held them to a minimum.  What there are seem to fit into the story lines.  And story is all.  I do not recognize the names of the writers, some night I will write them down and look them up.",1424563200,,687,4.151515151515151

The writers must never have graduated elementary school. Almost every episode I'm asking ""Why would you do that??"", ""How do you miss that??"", ""This is supposed to be an astrophysicist??"", ""How does Danial not know what EM means when talking about electricity??"". Also, every episode I am thinking to myself, ""Man oh man, our military is dysfunctional at times but I'm sure glad they aren't this stupid.""

If you are of average or greater intellect, I highly suggest passing on this series. There better ways to kill your brain cells, like binge drinking.",1422316800,3,718,4.790322580645161

1716225,5,B000067DNC,Loved it!,1417564800,,9,4.0
1716226,5,B000067DNC,"Season 2 is one of my favorites, because its when we really start to get a more complicated sense of the imperialistic undertones that run throughout the show.  Season 1 gave us the SGCs mission parameters: to recover alien technology and resources to help humanity defend Earth against the Goauld  but season 2 begins to complicate this mission statement when we are introduced to the idea that, in order for humanity to make these acquisitions, it has to take from somebody.
 This idea is best captured in episodes 13 (Spirits) and 14 (Touchstone), both of which approach it in somewhat different ways.  Spirits focuses on the idea of land and mineral acquisition, and on the rights of indigenous people, drawing heavily on the theme of European/Native American relations in order to do so.  Touchstone, on the other hand, presents us outright with the corruption of the SGCs agenda, by showing us how rampant acquisition, without care or fair-dealing, is ultimately destructive.
 Episodes like this are part of what makes Stargate SG1 a good show.  It works in layers.  Its a show that, at its surface, is about a group of U.S. soldiers going to alien places to spread their ideals and bring home wealth, and one would expect it to be all chest-thumping and imperialistic arrogance (and it has that in spades), but it also challenges those sentiments with a strong current of self-awareness.  It reminds us that imperialism might be fun for the people doing it, but it is frequently (or always) destructive to the people who are on the other end.  Episodes such as these are good examples of when the show really starts to take off, when it becomes self-critical and self-reflective.
 I would definitely recommend this season to anyone who enjoys shows that are smart, funny, and packed with action.",1417392000,,1802,4.894736842105263

1716268,5,B000067DNC,"When this program, the first of the Stargate programs, came out, all I had to view it with was a color television set in the living room. Neither the picture nor the sound were very good and there were lots of interruptions and noise. Now I have a 1080P HD monitor and can stream the program on my schedule. I have headphones that limit outside noise. I still get interruptions but not as many as before. I can watch and listen to the program as never before. When the program was being broadcast, I was suffering from cataracts and couldn't see clearly. I had to watch the program at the times it was broadcast, sometimes an impossible undertaking, and I would miss episodes.

Stargate SG-1 explored the idea of instantaneous transport to other worlds to explore. After the first few seasons it degenerated into a series on war with extraterrestrial aliens but the first few seasons showed some creativity. It's a pity that spark was lost as the series aged. The initial team of explorers was a good fit: an alien, an anthropologist, a geeky officer, all headed up by a rather confused, almost-retired Air Force colonel. I followed the program for years after it became something more ordinary and I followed the many offshoots that developed.

I can see clearly once more. I can watch episodes in sequence on my schedule. Much that, years ago, I missed has been restored to me now, due to modern technology. I am enjoying the program even more than the first time.",1415836800,,1466,4.656370656370656

You never know what you are going to get when you do(but conveniently they all speak English). This group of explorers I love, there is humor, adventure, and excitement. This was a long running show so the first in the series are not as well produced as later ones, but to get the story of how this motley group came together, you must see the beginning episodes. This series was before Stargate Atlantis and there is a handover from one Lieutenant Jack O'Neil to Colonel John Shepard in the beginning of Stargate Atlantis, which I love just as much and more as this one. So settle in for some long exciting hours of exploration and adventure with these folks. There is humor too.",1402617600,,828,4.563758389261745

""Secrets"" episode was one of my favorites,but there should have been better research on the Air Medal that they almost got from the President...After saving the Earth they should have been awarded the Medal of Honor or at least the Distinguished Flying Cross.  The Air Medal, while nice to have, ranks below the Bronze Star, and it would never be presented by the President.  I know, because I have six of them.

They were tryng so hard to show the public how great theshow is, that they wen't a little overboard; jumpig from galatic threat to Galatic threat. I believe the later seasons were so much better because the writers (and SciFi) took the time necesssary to fully develop their story lines about the Ori, and the Ancients.

I Love SG1 I also have watched Stargate Atlantis and that was a good series as well but I have to say SG1 is better! The chemistry between the characters is amazing! Amanda Tapping as Capt. Samantha Carter- very good acting-not just all action- yes it has plenty of that...but is so much more...the show has a solid story line with all the plot twist you could want while remaining true to the characters and building on them throughout the seasons. At first glance you may think this is just another cheesy low budget bad acting scifi show..but if you give it a shot and watch you will be very surprised! The special effects are also way better than you would expect from a tv series like this. But yet again SG1 comes through with a perfect 5 star rating on all aspects!

1717448,5,B000067DNC,"OK, I'll admit it.  I LOVE Stargate SG1.  I love the characters, the story lines, the actors, the effects, and I can even overlook the fact that most of the planets visited look like Canada(where the episodes were filmed).
I own the complete set of all 10 years on DVD, and wouldn't part with it for anything.  That said, watching the entire series for free on Amazon Prime is more convenient, and it's easier to scan through episodes to watch the ones in which I am most interested.
Sure, there are a few silly episodes, but even those are fun.
In general, the production standards, quality of the stories and the acting stand head and shoulders above tun of the mill si-fi.  The proof of that statement is the fact that this series ran TEN YEARS, and spawned two movies (not counting the original), as well as two additional series.

I'm sure most people would disagree, however almost every episode addresses an interesting theoretical religious and/or scientific topic, bringing them all together into an epic story of human existence. Stargate is nothing like the new Battlestar Galactica, which is really just a soap opera in space, addressing a single, played out theme of humans vs robots (which is also covered in Stargate). Stargate is sci-fi for nerds and will most likely not appeal to the simple minded. The cool thing about this show is I regularly finish an episode with a new perspective and a more enlightened outlook on life, not too many TV shows can offer this. I recommend watching all the Stargate movies and TV series in order, until you get to Universe, which is crap and not worth waisting time beyond the the first episode.",1387670400,,874,4.87248322147651

If you haven't bought any Stargate box sets check out the price of the complete series to see if you might save some money by buying them all at once. It was just a hundred for all ten and then today it looks like it's just sixty because of a sell probably. I wish I had waited to buy them all at once. I know better now to wait till it gets around ten bucks before buying a season or wait till I can buy them all together. If you've never seen stargate well it's awesome and you should definitely check it out maybe catch it on hulu to see if it's your kind of television.

1717525,5,B000067DNC,"5 STARS on all episodes from the beginning to the end :(
SG-1 has to be the only FIVE STAR TV series ever produced (in my opinion)
Every episode is directed as 'good' as any movie and generally even 'better' then most
The best episodes are of course with Richard Dean Anderson (Col. Jack O'Neill) '6 Star Rating'
The episodes that followed the 'less seen' Gen. O'Neill were also excellent but just lacking the '6 Star' rating the 'O'Neill' episodes had. All-in-all still the BEST action/adventure, Sci-Fi/Fantasy ever made for TV.
Well made, a lot of 'thought' went into each episode, great 'bad guys', ingenious. The Hi-Tech 'bugs' have to be the most logically thought out villains ever thought of, very clever and if you think about it... probable (? ya think?).
It literally 'shot down' Star Trek' episodes by a ling shot (I still watch Star Trek which remains one of my favorite TV eps. even though they may be number 'two' they still hold my interest.

1717587,4,B000067DNC,stargate was one of my favorite series. it is rarely shown on tv.  I am happy that I can stream to my kindle and its free. the picture is clear and the sound is excellent. I am very happy.,1383436800,,188,3.8205128205128207

1717590,5,B000067DNC,"Season 2 of this classic science fiction series gives some small details about the origins of the Stargates, and also escalates the main conflict between the Goa'uld and the SGC. I feel specific mention needs to go to the episode ""Holiday"", which involves body-switching and has some great acting from the main cast, especially Christopher Judge, who gets to loosen up considerably. This season definitely made me want to know more!",1382659200,,432,5.098591549295775
1717591,4,B000067DNC,Nothing exceptional in this Season. It's just another season in the Series of 10 that you need to view to complete the whole set. You need this Season to understand what the next season will start out with and so it goes with all of them including the 5-Season Atlantis Series & the remaining 2 Evolution Seasons. Several of the separate movies entwine themselves among the various seasons too. I own everything SG-1 made. I honestly believe that all of the money that I paid out to accomplish my complete collection was money well spent for the HUGE amount of enjoyment involved with almost 245 hours of watching time.,1382400000,,619,4.6880733944954125
1717632,5,B000067DNC,"As always, excellent show!  I wish there were longer descriptions of the episode on the menu.  All it has is the title, not always helpful if you are looking for something specific and don't remember the exact title.",1382400000,,216,4.657894736842105

1717638,5,B000067DNC,"Every season is great, with few throw away episodes. I even love the seasons with Jonas. I can appreciate his contribution better now, than I did when those seasons originally aired because I was so angry then that Daniel was gone. Daniel is still the best, but Jonas was a great Jonas!

1717640,5,B000067DNC,I loved watching season 2 of SG-1. I look forward to watching the other seasons that come after it. I love the dynamic of the characters. The only thing I wasn't so crazy about in season 2 was that it seemed they were always imprisoned!,1380412800,,236,4.266666666666667

The video quality is excellent, the characters and actors are outstanding, and the special effects and story lines are entertaining.  As others have said, you don't have to be a sci-fy fan to enjoy this season or all the series.

If you enjoy good acting, great character interplay, and good story lines, you will enjoy this season 2 video set.  There are many and varied episodes and some will become your ""fav's"".

1717747,5,B000067DNC,I have watched this series when it was first on TV and now I am watching it again. I love the concept and the stories of this TV series. Dean Anderson's sense of humor and the other character's unique qualities makes the stories entertaining and exciting. You never know what each episode will be about or what twists and turns the story may take. I was hooked from the pilot episode and I am not surprised the series lasted for over ten seasons.,1378166400,,446,4.385542168674699

1717786,5,B000067DNC,"I love the canon that has developed throughout the years. I started
watching the show and movie in the mid 90's and loved the character
development that ensued.

SG-1 has a really engaging storyline that pull you into the action and tells
a the story very well. I would recommend it a hundred fold over the reality TV
garbage that seems to perpetuate television these days.",1376956800,,373,4.651515151515151

1717792,5,B000067DNC,One of the alltime best scifi series out there. This season was fun as you watch the cast and crew explore more of what they could do with the series as a whole,1376265600,,160,3.878787878787879
1717812,5,B000067DNC,"The concept of Stargate SG-1 is unique (notwithstanding the movie on which it was based) in the Sci-Fi genre. I love that they can laugh at themselves and at their genre, and still be taken seriously as a series and storyline. Season 2 is essential watching for Stargate fans because so much of the foundational principles are established in this season,  Nearly every episode is referenced in a later episode in a later season.  I'm re-watching the entire series and enjoying the ride.",1376179200,,486,4.843373493975903
1717813,5,B000067DNC,"Often overlooked by many sci-fi fans, the SG-1 series was a solid mix of science and mythological folklore. With a great cast and excellent plots, it was a great show that ended long before fans were ready. The second season was the beginning of the series finding its footings in exactly what it wanted to be and how to get there, especially with the addition of new bad guys and new allies. I've enjoyed watching the old episodes again and often long for a new and good sci-fi show rather than the stuff that's out there today.",1376179200,,529,4.463917525773196
1717814,5,B000067DNC,"Yes its the Air Force prancing around on other planets, but its also MacGyver. This is one of the few shows I have no trouble watching. This is my second time through the seasons and the episodes don't get old.",1376006400,,210,4.275

1717816,5,B000067DNC,"I love this series.  It if filled with metaphors to current life, but done with good storytelling, great characters and FX.  But what makes this a great series is the use of world history as a basis for the stories and characters.",1375574400,,230,4.4523809523809526

1717819,4,B000067DNC,"Overall, I rate the entire SG-1 series at 4 stars or higher for multiple reasons, the chief of which is that it is just good clean entertainment. The characters are largely likeable and the villains are easy to root against, and you wouldn't have to cover your  6 year-olds eyes and ears because of something unseemly.",1375056000,,318,4.678571428571429

1717843,4,B000067DNC,"Good show if you are looking for hours of Sci-fi TV.  There are like 20+ episodes in this season. I've never been an avid watcher of space shows, but I like this one so far.  Characters are good and the premise is interesting. It feels a little dated, but I realize this show started 15 years ago, so that is to be expected. I would recommend it.",1374710400,,346,4.149253731343284

1717845,5,B000067DNC,"Just like the other seasons, this has a great story line. The only down side at all is you have to like war stories, because they are constantly at war.",1374451200,,152,4.1
1717846,4,B000067DNC,"This is a great show.  One of the things that I like most about SG-1 is how the writers let things change.  I.e., at first it was all about the Stargate.  But as time passed they introduced new elements like space ships and the melding of human and alien technology as illustrated in the building of the jet fighters later used in the show.",1374364800,,340,4.28125

1717861,5,B000067DNC,"At first this started off a little slow. I wondered why they made so many seasons.
But boy did I get hooked. Story lines were over all excellent. You really get involved in the characters relationships with one another. Nothing can compare to Star Trek series and movies, but StarGate Universe is up there in my opinion.",1373328000,,320,4.631578947368421
1717862,5,B000067DNC,This series seems to have a lot of repeats from season 1. But I just skip past them to see new shows. I enjoy this type of show and like the actors and the characters that they portray.,1373328000,,185,3.8947368421052633

Of course I didn't understand what was going on in some of the series, for instance double jeopardy until I watched seasons 1&2. Than everything started making sense. Love Stargate, the humor, seriousness, and the scientific approach to the show. I only wished the show expanded the idea of the retu alien instead of the orei.",1372809600,,451,4.65

They managed to do that without her losing her attraction as a woman when it is appropriate and would be expected.

Received package today, nothing wrong with it, shipped in nice tight box, dvds have no scratches on them.
Watched a couple episodes.  Audio was great, the video quality was a little lacking; like the quality you see when you copy a DVD on computer and compress it down to make it fit to a certain size.

The main bug I have with it, is the compression may be too much.  While watching the episodes the video will do a freeze for a second or two, the audio will keep playing but the video has paused.  All the episodes I watched had this issue, some episodes did this over 20 times.  I even watched it in 3 different dvd players, and they always froze in the same spot...

So I know its nothing physically wrong with the discs, but whoever copied and compressed them down from the masters, is not a hero.",1354060800,3,980,4.316939890710382

1718180,5,B000067DNC,"I grabbed this because after reading about a scene in this episode, I realized that of all of the seasons of SG-1 it was an episode I either missed, or at the very least, completely and totally forgot about.

It's hard to review an episode of a tv show that's been out for over 10 years....It's been reviewed to death already.

The summary of my opinion of the episode.

I laughed, a lot. I enjoyed it. End of

Most SG-1 fans have probably seen it (at least 2-3 times) but if you are new to the show, I recommend starting with Season 1 Ep. 1 Children of the Gods(Part 1-2 here on Amazon) and watch them in order. Take a couple of weekends(or your days off if they aren't on a weekend) and watch a season or 2 each weekend. By the time you are done watching, you too will feel empty inside, knowing there are no more awesome stories to come from Stargate SG-1. Then you can start watching Stargate Atlantis(5 seasons) and then Stargate Universe(2 seasons) plus the 2 SG-1 Movies Continuum and Ark of Truth.",1350691200,,1005,4.329787234042553

1718182,5,B000067DNC,"This one is worth it just to see the costumes that our regulars wear in 1969, but also adds to the character of General Hammond and the team as a whole. The episode uses the trope of self-fulfilling prophecy in an endless loop more than once in the episode, but I suppose that shows at least a consistent philosophy. My only complaint is that we didn't get to find out, even as exposition, what happened to one of the characters in 1969 in the future and that would have been a nice touch as the guest actor did a good job in making the audience care. A highlight episode of SG-1.",1349827200,,580,4.2342342342342345

O'Neill was just as bad, constantly acting arrogant towards the leaders of the indigenous population which is unacceptable for one an officer of his rank who shows so much respect towards General Hammond. Instead of acting cooperative, they were hostile which made everything sour.

SG1 are supposed to be the good guys, the best America has to offer; yet in this episode they acted arrogant towards others which really made the episode weak!

However, I did enjoy watching O'Neill relive his past and struggle with the death of a friend.  Daniel Jackson's experience gave the viewer new insight which ultimately did not have anything to do with the conclusion of the episode.

1718286,5,B000067DNC,"When we last left Our Heroes, they were on Apophis' ship, facing the impending destruction and/or enslavement of everyone on Earth.

So unsurprisingly, the second season of ""Stargate SG-1"" can only get better from there on. In fact, this is when the clever, innovative sci-fi series really started to gel together, with more intriguing storylines, character arcs, and some new alien allies -- basically, it all blooms.

Intending to blow up Apophis' ship, our heroes get captured by the Jaffa and thrown in a cell -- only to be unexpectedly rescued by Bra'tac (Tony Amendola), Teal'c's old teacher. As Earth mounts a pitiful defense against the Goa'uld, SG-1 joins with a small band of rebel Jaffa to stop Apophis' invasion -- but they may have to leave one of their number behind.

Obviously the Goa'uld make things awkward throughout the season, with the second episode featuring Sam (Amanda Tapping) being possessed by a Goa'uld during a rescue mission -- but it seems that it's part of a rebel Goa'uld faction called the Tok'ra. Teal'c's (Christopher Judge) son is kidnapped and brainwashed, and Daniel (Michael Shanks) finds that his beloved wife is pregnant with Apophis' child.

And of course, SG-1 has to deal with lots of other stuff -- insectile transformations, black holes, prison planets, Native American ""spirits,"" invisible bugs, hostile alien orbs, reliving their most traumatic memories in a VR world, and time traveling to 1969. And O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) gets an ancient repository of knowledge downloaded into his head -- and he'll die if they can't reverse it.

""Stargate SG-1"" really got into its stride in the second season -- the basic Air-Force-versus-evil-headsnakes story gets expanded out into a bunch of arcs. We get new villains, some surprising new allies, hints about the true origins of the Stargates and the human race, and corrupt factions on Earth who use the spare Stargate for evil ends.

The writing gets even steadier and the alien worlds more interesting -- even stuff that sounds goofy, like the planet of singing mushroom-people, somehow works. The drama is stronger, and the sci-fi usage of the Stargate ever more creative, such as when a black hole's gravity well keeps the gate open, and is slowly sucking Earth through the wormhole. Good, tense stuff.

Of course, all the action and sci-fi is heavily tempered with comedy. Even in grim situations, there's usually at least a few funny moments, such as Daniel's tour of the custodial closet. And of course, the dialogue is priceless -- most of the good stuff comes from O'Neill (""That's between you and your god. Oh, wait a minute! You are your god! That's a problem""), but Teal'c (""In my culture, I would be well within my rights to dismember you"") and the others usually get some good ones as well.

Of the main cast, Amanda Tapping gets the juiciest role in this season -- Sam deals with the impending death of her father, becoming a Goa'uld host, and trying to deal with the feelings it left behind. Including a cute Tok'ra boyfriend. Yet when we see Sam's vulnerable sides, Tapping never lets her character be anything but a strong, capable military woman.

But the other actors aren't neglected -- Shanks' Daniel grapples with the news that his wife is pregnant with Apophis' baby, while Teal'c faces losing his entire family. Anderson is brilliant as the quirky, capable O'Neill, but he really gets brilliant when Jack's brain is being overwritten -- he has to emote and communicate without a comprehensible word.

The second season of ""Stargate SG-1"" is where the story began to really get great, building up a series of strong story arcs, funny dialogue, and strong characters. Definitely a must-see.",1237939200,,3714,4.975806451612903

Therefore, I eagerly ordered the first three seasons in the ""Thinpak"" edition from Amazon only to find that each of the seasons included episodes that pixelated and or were otherwise unwatchable (e.g., no sound for one of the characters or, in one case, a disk that would not even load). I reported the situation to Amazon and they promptly sent me replacements for all three seasons. Unfortunately, the same disks had the same problems in the replacement sets. I reported the situation to Amazon again, and received (in part) the following reply:

""As it seems that the problem with this item is more widespread than we originally thought, we are not able to send another replacement. We are returning the defective items to our suppliers.

Due to recent back surgery, I decided to buy season 1 from iTunes, and immediately fell in love with it. Once I finished that season, I could not see spending $40 on a low quality digital version of season 2 when I could buy it brand new on DVD here for $25. And I have decided to go back and purchase season 1 from here, as well as seasons 3 through 10, to have it in higher quality.

If you have not seen this series, it is good, solid story-telling. No, it will not win any Earth-moving awards, but it will keep you going while telling a good sci-fi story set in the modern day with current technology.

Season 1 may have began the series, but this is where the show really gets going and explains about some of the bigger issues for all the main characters and the supporting cast. Fans who had seen the later seasons need to watch the core of the show and that begins with the first half of the series and the first 2 seasons.

1718322,5,B000067DNC,"When we last left Our Heroes, they were on Apophis' ship, facing the impending destruction and/or enslavement of everyone on Earth.

So unsurprisingly, the second season of ""Stargate SG-1"" can only get better from there on. In fact, this is when the clever, innovative sci-fi series really started to gel together, with more intriguing storylines, character arcs, and some new alien allies -- basically, it all blooms.

Intending to blow up Apophis' ship, our heroes get captured by the Jaffa and thrown in a cell -- only to be unexpectedly rescued by Bra'tac (Tony Amendola), Teal'c's old teacher. As Earth mounts a pitiful defense against the Goa'uld, SG-1 joins with a small band of rebel Jaffa to stop Apophis' invasion -- but they may have to leave one of their number behind.

Obviously the Goa'uld make things awkward throughout the season, with the second episode featuring Sam (Amanda Tapping) being possessed by a Goa'uld during a rescue mission -- but it seems that it's part of a rebel Goa'uld faction called the Tok'ra. Teal'c's (Christopher Judge) son is kidnapped and brainwashed, and Daniel (Michael Shanks) finds that his beloved wife is pregnant with Apophis' child.

And of course, SG-1 has to deal with lots of other stuff -- insectile transformations, black holes, prison planets, Native American ""spirits,"" invisible bugs, hostile alien orbs, reliving their most traumatic memories in a VR world, and time traveling to 1969. And O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) gets an ancient repository of knowledge downloaded into his head -- and he'll die if they can't reverse it.

""Stargate SG-1"" really got into its stride in the second season -- the basic Air-Force-versus-evil-headsnakes story gets expanded out into a bunch of arcs. We get new villains, some surprising new allies, hints about the true origins of the Stargates and the human race, and corrupt factions on Earth who use the spare Stargate for evil ends.

The writing gets even steadier and the alien worlds more interesting -- even stuff that sounds goofy, like the planet of singing mushroom-people, somehow works. The drama is stronger, and the sci-fi usage of the Stargate ever more creative, such as when a black hole's gravity well keeps the gate open, and is slowly sucking Earth through the wormhole.

1718357,5,B000067DNC,"There have over the years been a number of great shows that followed a good first season with a great second one, including THE X-FILES, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, and FARSCAPE. There are a variety of reasons for this in each case. With STARGATE, it is the increasingly complex storyline about the relations between various races and cultures with access to stargates. Season One was basically your stargate-of-the-week format, each week an individual adventure with no real connections with any other episode. This is the format usually preferred by network executives, since it allows new viewers to join a show without much background. Serious fans, on the other hand, vastly prefer the complex storylines, where each week's episode does not stand on its own, but is embedded in an ongoing saga, almost like a chapter in a huge novel. This has been and probably will continue to be an ongoing struggle between the creative talent and the network bureaucracy, though my own hope is that the success of shows like LOST will pave the way for more complex formats.

Season Two does not tell a single unified story the way that FARSCAPE or BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER did, but it does start spinning out a largely political struggle about the five races (only a few that we have met by the end of the season) aligned against the Goa'uld. The STARGATE story by the end of Season One was still a relatively simple affair; by the end of Season Two it was already sufficiently complex as to make following the details difficult for a newcomer. But it was not only the season long arc; the individual episodes improved in quality as well as the writers came to know the characters better. All in all, the improvement in the show from Season One was not unexpected, but it was delightful nonetheless.

The only sour note in Season Two was the season finale. Most shows try to build up to a dramatic season-ending episode that both sums up everything that happened in that season and propels the show into the next one. The season finale for Season Two of STARGATE has to be one of the lamest ever devised. Most of the problem is that most of the episode was constructed of segments of previous episodes that were simply replayed. STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION used this method a few times. My guess is that the latter show used it as a cheap way of creating a new episode. If 20 minutes of your air time consisted of clips from old shows, then you had dramatically lowered your operating budget. I do not know why STARGATE employed this method in the season finale, though perhaps they were over budget and had no choice but to go cheap. Nonetheless, it was a surprisingly false note in an otherwise marvelous season.

As with Season One, the story largely focused on the four members of the Stargate SG-1 team, with all other character functioning as supporting characters. We are introduced to a number of characters who reappear in subsequent seasons, the most important being General Jacob Carter, Samantha's father. His importance to the show is cemented in the two-part episode that introduces the Tok'ra, a group rebel Goa'uld opposed to the regular Goa'uld, only entering as symbiotes in willing hosts. Since Sam's father is dying of cancer and the Tok'ra Selmak's host is dying, he is approached to become a host, since Selmak can cure the cancer. This is also a wonderful resolution to one of my favorite moments of the season, when Sam's father pulls strings to get her admitted to the NASA space program as a potential astronaut. Not knowing about her work with the Stargate program, he can't understand why she has no interest in going into outer space.

All in all, this is a remarkable season for one of the finest Sci-fi series that television has seen. Although I've never forgiven the Sci-fi channel for failing to renew FARSCAPE, keeping this fine show alive has at least partially redeemed them in my eyes.",1152144000,3,3915,4.736070381231672

1718400,4,B000067DNC,"The second season of STARGATE SG1 produced a series that is starting to mature. The plot lines do not rely so much on finding old earth civilization scattered all about the universe. New and creative ideas are introduced. The season also matures in that there are many plot lines begun and left for later episodes to be resolved. Some of these are not even resolved during the course of the season. The show makes for entertaining television even if a lot of the science is hokey. Personally, the science does not bother me near as much as the linguistics. Practically everyone in the universe speaks English.

Synopses of the episodes appear below:

The season starts off with a bang and resolves last season's cliffhanger. The SG1 crew had violated orders and transported themselves to the location where Daniel suspected the invasion fleet was leaving from. They found themselves on one of the ships participating in the invasion of Earth. The episode opens with the fleet's arrival. Bumbling politicians on Earth don't realize the threat and it is only a matter of time before the invasion begins. The only hope is the SG1 team who will have to recruit allies, destroy both ships and give up any chance of surviving themselves.

In the Line of Duty - While evacuating some refugees, Capt. Clark gets infested with a ghoul. The SG crew manages to capture her before she can wreak too much damage. Her ghoul makes a startling claim. It claims to be part of a ghoul resistance. Still, no one trusts it. They think she is part of a plot to wreak destruction on Earth and other happenings seem to bear this out. It seems another ghoul is on the loose. Clark's ghoul claims that the other one is an assassin sent to kill her. There does not seem to be much chance of the captain surviving no matter the truth of the situation.

Prisoners - The SG1 team makes its way to a world that seems deserted at first. Soon, however, they encounter a man who asks them for help. Not knowing what else to say, they offer their help and are then caught up in a bright beam of light. The next thing they know, they are before a tribunal charging them with trespassing and helping a prisoner to escape. Both charges carry life imprisonment and the transportation to the prison planet is by way of another stargate. The prison is very hellish and is an environment of ""might makes right"". They are aided by a mysterious old woman.  With her help, they manage to get the local gate working and with her, return to Earth. There, she learns all about the SG program and they learn they she was called ""the destroyer of worlds"". This genie won't go back into the bottle.

The Gamekeeper - in a rather silly episode, the SG1 team finds themselves on a seemingly deserted but otherwise lovely planet. Besides the park like environment, all they find are a bunch of strange pods with humans in them. While investigate the pods, they are captured and find themselves reliving their worst memories. They are actually present in the tragedies of their own lives and, worse, they have a strange audience. Part of the audience is the gamekeeper is seems devoted to forcing them to explore the endless variations inherent in their tragedies. The crew just wants out.

Need - The team investigates a planet that seems to be inhabited by ghoul slaves. When Daniel rescues a princess, they learn that the planet is not inhabited by ghouls. Instead, they are humans who managed to throw off the ghouls several centuries before. They maintain their independence by continuing to mine the stargate mineral and sending it through to the ghouls who assume that everything is operating normally and have no idea that the humans are free. Things get complicated when the team is sentenced to labor in the mines and they get worse when the princess falls in love with Daniel. She uses one of the healing sarcophagi to fix him up after he is hurt and repeated exposure gets him addicted to this unhealthy process. In the process, he begins to lose his mind.

Thor's Chariot - Stargate command gets a message from the planet protected by Thor last season. The ghouls have invaded and things look grim. Since the ghouls were only able to get a foothold because the SG1 team destroyed Thor's hammer, they feel a responsibility to go back and help. While part of the team tries to hold the ghouls off, the others go off in search of the legendary Thor's chariot. They are hoping it is a weapon to fight the ghouls. Instead, it turns out to be substantially less...and more. They have a new ally.

Message in a Bottle - The SG1 crew explores a world that shows evidence of a highly advanced civilization which has been extinct for millennia. They bring back an artifact in order to study it. Expose to energy activates it and it begins to reproduce and take over the complex. They think of it as a disease and treat it as such with limited effect but they are fighting a losing battle. It turns out that it is not just a disease, it is an alien intelligence and the problem is how to communicate with it before everyone dies.

Family - The SG1 crew gets word that Teal'c's son has been abducted by Apothis. Everyone realizes that this has been done so that Teal'c can be lured back and captured. It's just not that simple. Teal'c finds that his wife has been remarried to an old friend and jealousy rears its head. What makes matters worse is that the rescue attempt on the son does not go off as planned. He has become an agent for Apothis and he has a larger goal than just capturing his father. He wants to destroy the Earth.

Secrets - This is a two story episode. Daniel and Teal'c head back to Abydos to keep a 1 year reunion promise and see that the stargate there is not buried. When they get there, he finds his long lost wife, pregnant by Apothis. It seems that the ghouls go dormant when their hosts are pregnant. She is due to deliver in several days and then the ghoul will awake again. Meanwhile, another ghoul, an enemy of Apothis, wants to kidnap the child. Back on earth, Col. O'Neill and Capt. Clark head to Washington to receive the air medal for their part in defeating the ghoul ships. While there, a reporter tries to confirm rumors of the stargate's existence. He knows too much and there has been a leak. The consequences of that are deadly.

Bane - When the SG! Team investigates a new planet, they find signs of a high civilization but which is completely devoid of anyone. Then they are attacked by the ""mosquitoes"" from hell; giant things, about the size of bats with scorpion-like tales. Teal'c is bitten and the crew makes a hasty escape through the stargate. The damage is already done. Teal'c gets sicker and sicker. He's dying and even the ghoul inside of him cannot help. It seems that the organism laid some eggs and is feeding directly off of his body. When he ""hatches"" he will spread the bugs and humanity will be doomed. Meanwhile, Teal'c is driven by powerful instincts to hide and tries to do so by escaping the mountain facility and fleeing into the city.

The Tok'Ra Part 1 - Several episodes back, Capt. Clark became the unwitting host of a ghoul. It turns out that was not a run of the mill ghoul but a member of resistance movement. That ghoul gave its life saving hers. Ever since, she has had strange memories and thoughts. They are the leftovers of her former ghoul. Now, SG1 has gone in search of this resistance movement called the Tok'Ra. They wish to form an alliance. The Tok'Ra, however, are suspicious. They are doubly so since the earth party evinces a reluctance to serve as hosts. Since the alliance looks like it will not take place, the Tok'Ra are also reluctant to let the stargate team return to Earth, lest their secret be revealed.

The Tok'Ra Part 2 - As the last episode ended, the Stargate team was being held by the Tok'Ra to keep their secrets safe. Captain Clark had just received word that her dying father was nearing his end. This gives rise to an idea which may just save his life and cement the alliance. Tok'Ra and ghouls both heal their hosts. The former is a mutual symbiote and the latter is the parasite but both heal the body of the host. With that option before them, their lies hope for the Captain, her father, the alliance and the war against the Ghouls. They just have to get it done before the ghoul invasion ships arrive.

Spirits - The SG4 team is overdue back from a planet where they were supposed to be mining a special mineral for use in war against the ghouls and the SG1 team is dispatched to find out what's going on. They find a Native American culture which seems exceedingly friendly but adverse to the idea of mining their mountains. When asked about the missing team, the locals tell them that they are ""with the spirits."" Fortunately, this does not mean they are dead. They literally mean with their spirits. These take the form of wolves, ravens and others to be expected in a Native American culture but there is more to these spirits than meets the eye. They are not who they seem and they are very powerful. They also don't behave well when some of them are brought back through the star gate.

Touchstone - Some time back, the Stargate Command encountered a piece of technology used to control the weather on another planet. A little free time gives SG1 an opportunity to go back to that planet and try and study the device. When they get there, they find a chilly reception from the natives who believe that SG1 stole the ""touchstone"" device. It seems that people dressed like stargate teams came through and took the device. As a result, the planet is freezing. The SG1 teams tries to investigate this strange happening but they hit a brick wall in their investigation. Then it turns out that politics are involved and that the Antarctic gate has turned up missing. The rest of the mission takes place on earth as competing agendas come to light.

A Matter of Time - As one of the Stargate teams tries to flee back through the gate to safety on earth, something goes terribly wrong. They never make it through and the people earthside have a hard time figuring out why they do not and an even harder time figuring why the gate will not close. Then they start to notice strange things. Everything near the gate seems to slow down. When they finally get an image, they see that the planet where the far gate is located is too near a black hole and time dilation has become a factor. Time is slowing down near the hole. This is a problem because the gravitational field of the black hole is being transmitted through the gate to earth. That is why the gate will not close. Time dilation is starting to affect things on this side as well. This is a good episode if your knowledge of physics is particularly weak. That is true of most but especially in this one. Still, it is a good story.

The Fifth Race - When Daniel Jackson is working on deciphering the writing, found in one of their explorations, he finds evidence of another advanced race. When the team goes to investigate further, they find themselves in a high tech but abandoned facility. The colonel inadvertently activates some sort of ray and is knocked out. He seems none the worse for wear at first but he starts adding bits of a strange language to his speech. As time progresses, he speaks more and more in the new language and begins to loose the ability to speak in his own. As a partial compensation, he becomes a genius. He also feels compelled to build strange objects that nobody, including the colonel himself, understands. Eventually, he jury rigs the gate to transport himself to a destination much further than any they have ever traveled to before. When he goes through, he encounters the race of Thor and learns...much.

Serpent's Song - Stargate Command gets what seems to be a communication from the Tok'Ra and SG1 heads out to meet them at the assigned coordinates. Instead of finding the Tok'Ra, they find something very different. A ghoul ship crashes near them. It crashes because it is being chased by more ghoul ships and they are firing on it. When the team looks for survivors, they are surprised to find Apothis, their arch enemy. He is dying and seeks asylum. He wants a new host and offers knowledge. It is a tempting offer but the temptations diminish when it is learned that Apothis is wanted by a much more powerful ghoul who wants him as a prisoner for torture and retribution. Things get difficult because of the human moral code. It does not seem right to hand over even the most despised enemy for a fate like that but humanity's survival may dictate that they do just that.

Holiday - The SG1 team visits a new planet and finds lots of high tech goodies and a single, doddering old man. Teal'c recognizes the old man as a long time enemy of the ghouls who has in his time caused them much trouble before being captured, tortured and escaping. Now, he seems a harmless old man until he and Daniel both touch one of the devices at the same time. Doing so makes Daniel act strangely and the old man loses consciousness. They all evacuate through the stargate and all seems strange except for Daniel being exhausted. The old man doesn't get a say since he is still out of it. Daniel is taken home to get some rest and all seems well. When the old man comes to, everyone is in for a surprise. He is Daniel. Their minds have switched bodies. While search teams are sent into town to retrieve the body of Daniel, Teal'c and the colonel go back to the planet to retrieve the mind transference device. While doing so, those two get switched. This leads to some laughs as the colonel acts the straight man and Teal'c gets to play it up for laughs. When they finally capture the alien with Daniel's body, he is not willing to switch back. He figures that he has given enough to fight the ghouls and that humanity owes him a new life.

One False Step - The SG1 team investigate a pretty amazing planet. It is amazing primarily because its humanoid inhabitants DO NOT SPEAK ENGLISH. Based on the progress of the series thus far, such places are rare in the universe. The natives of this planet are fairly primitive and seem to have very little in the way of vocal skill. Not long after the team arrives, the natives start dropping like flies. There are all sorts of theories explaining this involving the transmission of disease. A cut finger here, a sneeze there and the like... Things get more frightening for the team when some of its own members start to feel ill but their symptoms are different and the epidemiology does not seem to work out for it having a common source even after alien physiologies are taken into account. The real cause of both diseases is fairly unexpected when it is discovered. This is not the best episode by far but it is refreshing to find one that doesn't depend on English as a universal language.

Show and Tell - Stargate Command is startled when their gate is activated by parties unknown and then, somehow, their iris defense is bypassed. When the intruder finally comes through, they are even more startled to find that he is a human child. The child bears a warning. Members of his ""mother's"" species, extremely non human, want to eradicate humanity and all other species that can serve has hosts for the ghouls. Later, it is learned that a member of that same species who issued the warning has come through the Stargate weeks before. They are going to be tough to defend against because they are invisible. The help of the Tok'ra are needed. This is a good episode even though it plays even more loosely than normal with modern physics.

1969 - Sooner or later, it seems as if every Sci-Fi series has to make a try at the grandfather paradox and try the idea of time travel. SG1 got to that point with this episode. The team accidentally goes back to 1969 and are arrested by the military. They manage to escape and must find their way to the stargate and get home. Explaining this episode further would be fruitless but ponder the implications of the SG1 team posing as hippies on their way to Woodstock. Ponder it especially with Teal'c in mind.

Out of Mind - End of season means retrospective time. This episode opens up with Col. O'Neill being revived from suspended animation. He has been out for over 70 years. He is told that he came through the stargate in a state of frozen, suspended animation. The rest of his crew came through dead. It is only now that the technology has been developed to safely revive him. Everyone wants to know, however, what happened. They use some sort of mind probe to play back his memories and we have the ""benefit"" of watching portions of previous episodes. The problem is that things are not as they seem. The others are alive and they too are being revived and having their memories probed. This means more flashbacks. The actual situation is even more complex. Teal'c is the only one not to find himself in this strange situation. He is at SGC and time has not progressed. Everyone wants to know what's going on. Hathor knows. Besides being a retrospective, this is also the end of season cliffhanger.",1136332800,6,17132,4.540479274611399

Also, we meet the Asgard and the Tok'ra, who will play major parts on later Seasons.  Season 1 set the rules, gave us a detailed setting and even ideas for future plots. Now Season 2 has mined those ideas and taken them farther, making a foundation for Season 3, 4, 5 and so on.  Nothing stays the same in this series - everything changes.  The balance if power is always changing and Earth is always in danger.

With episodes that are funny, intriguing, and introducing a whole variety of new characters and races, this season is hard to beat.

If you're new to Stargate SG-1, I'd suggest getting season 1 first, as it'll clear up many of the plotlines for you. Nonetheless, I watched season 2 first, and only after that went on to season 1. Season 1 only explains details that might be go for you to know in season 2.

This show is better than other SciFi on TV for two main reasons (and a myriad of smaller ones): 1) a great cast who make you believe that they really do care about each other and what happens to their characters and 2) the stories are set in the present without altering reality outside the ""series universe"" more than necessary.  This lends an authenticity to the show that gives it more grit and brings you into the stories deeper than if the story were set as pure fantasy.  The military setting also gives added tension.

Season two has some great episodes including ""In the Line of Duty"" which adds to the mythology for the rest of SG-1. The season finale leading into season 3 will have you on the edge of your seat!  This is a must buy for SG-1 fans.",1093132800,2,780,4.315068493150685

1718458,5,B000067DNC,"The first season of Stargate: SG-1 was very good.  It had good stories, but it also had great potential to become something better.  Season 2 has begun to realize said potential.  Many of the episodes this season expanded on ideas and arcs from the first season, as well as introducing new ideas, characters, and locations.  For example, we meet Thor (in his true form), as well as some of the other Asguard, a powerful alliance with the Tok'Ra is formed, the NID storyline is taken in new directions, and we learn about the builders of the Stargate system as well as the origins of the intergalactic U.N. from the first season episode, ""The Torment of Tantalus"".  We also meet some new Goa'uld system lords, as well as see the destruction of an old enemy.
The actors (Richard Dean Anderson, Michael Shanks, Amanda Tapping, Christopher Judge, Don S. Davis, and Teryl Rohtery) all grew in their roles as Col. Jack O'Neill, Dr. Daniel Jackson, Capt. Sam Carter, Teal'c, Gen. George Hammond, and Dr. Janet Frasier.  Not only did they prove their worth as their own characters, some of them got the chance to play others as well in the episode, ""Holdiay"".  I'm sure that Judge liked that one because he got to play O'Neill, who is Teal'c's polar opposite.
The storylines were improved this year (not that they were bad last year), with some great examples being: ""The Serpent's Lair"", ""In the Line of Duty"", ""Prisoners"", ""Thor's Chariot"", ""Secrets"", ""The Tok'Ra, Pts. 1 and 2"", ""Spirits"", ""Touchstone"", ""A Matter of Time"", ""The Fifth Race"", ""Serpent's Song"", ""Holiday"", ""1969"", and ""Out of Mind"".

1718460,5,B000067DNC,"As I noted in my Season 1 review, I had to watch this series in bits and pieces until (a) these DVD sets came out and (b) SCI-FI Channel picked up the series and delivered it to the masses.
Season 2 REALLY reveals a lot more of the important plot lines which, thankfully, have been faithfully carried through Season 7 (or 8 -- SCI-FI really messes with season numbers).  You will absolutely benefit from watching this set from start to finish, as it will reveal the To'kra relationship from the beginning, including the introduction of Sam Carter's father (who takes on a To'kra as a carrier).  The episode from the 60s is great too (EVERY sci-fi series has a time travel episode or two, right?!).
I have not yet had a chance to look over the DVD featurettes, but I can tell you that having 5.1 surround sound on this set is MUCH BETTER than with Season 1.  I tried out Season 1 on my new Sony HTIB system (5.1/DTS/Dolby Digital -- nothing fancier than a standard HTIB), and I was really hating the fact that it didn't have surround sound.  The Season 2 set has Dolby Digital compliance, I believe, and it sounds much richer.
I will note that the 5.1 effects are NOT ""woosh - bam - whizz"" sweet like in recent DVDs like T3 or Finding Nemo.  You really cannot HEAR the effects of bullets or staff weapons moving behind you.  I've checked all the discs and my HTIB, and it just seems to be that the DVDs are encoded 5.1 but without any tremendous directional effects.
Ain't it great that the content makes up for the lack of sound effects?  On to Season 3!",1075766400,,1554,4.375
1718461,5,B000067DNC,"StarGate is still one of my favorite shows. But don't confuse ""letterboxed"" with ""wide-screen"". I've been watching SG-1 since it first started on Showtime. It wasn't produced in wide-screen, so it wasn't ""broadcast"" in wide-screen. The current letterbox fad is nothing more than that--a bar at the top and a bar at the bottom of a full-screen format, chopping off the top and the bottom of the original picture to make it look like a wide-screen format. You're actually losing original content.  That, however, doesn't change the quality of the show itself; it's still great.  The DVDs are excellent in both picture and sound quality.",1065744000,8,634,5.0285714285714285

I watched both sets whenever I had free time.

The problem is that if I find I title, I would like also to see immediately if there is also a version for my own language (Italian). It is very hard in Amazon to find the right language for DVDs.

1718464,5,B000067DNC,"Season Two delves deeper into the character of each player and furthers the story of the battle against the Goa'uld. The overall story arc is advanced, as well. While still skimpy on ""special"" features, I was less interested in these than in the fact that this series is available on DVD. And it is presented in the ""letterbox"" format, or mor correctly, the now increasingy popular (in preparation for HDTV dimensions) 16x9 aspect ratio. So, yes, there are black ""bars"" at the top and bottom of the screen. They ""disappear"" as you watch the shows and are not an issue with me. I like letterboxing. The images are crisp and clean to my eye. A more picky person will probably find flaws in the transfer and digitizing of the images, but they are hard to satisfy to begin with. The sound is good, too (though I do not have 5.1 surround to test that feature). If you have Season One, the layout here will be familiar as they have remained consistent in presentation menu screens to access the episodes. If you like the series, support it and buy these to let them know they are doing something right.",1061164800,,1096,4.540404040404041

1718466,5,B000067DNC,"When last we left our heroes SG-1 was on a Goa'uld warship heading for Earth and with that rather dramatic cliffhanger we begin Season 2 of ""Stargate SG-1.""  Adding insult to injury, the ship is commanded by Klorel, the ""son"" of Apophis, who possesses the body of Skaara (Alexis Cruz).  By the end of the DVD it is clear that the series that had the best first season in the history of science fiction television is going to be even better:
Episode 1, ""The Serpent's Lair"" (Written by Brad Wright, Aired June 26, 1998) the SG-1 team is now on a suicide mission having planted explosives on the warship.  Unfortunately, there is more than one Goa'uld ship on its way to Earth.  Then they are captured by Bra'tac (Tony Amendola), Teal'c's Jaffa mentor who also wants to free his people from the control of Apophis (Peter Williams).  Bra'tac has a plan to stop both warships but the SG-1 crew will still end up just as dead and Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) still wants to free Skaara from Klorel's control. Meanwhile, back at Cheyenne Mountain there is a frantic effort to save part of American culture by sending people through the Stargate to an Alpha Site.  General Hammond (Don S. Davis) is also preparing to defend the base as long as possible and is finding lots of subtle ways of telling Lt. Colonel Samuels (Robert Wisden), ""I told you so, you arrogant jerk.""  Just because we have ever reason to believe the Earth is not going to be conquered at the end of the episode does not take away from the fun.  4.5 Stargates.

Episode 2, ""In the Line of Duty"" (Written by Robert C. Cooper, Aired July 3, 1998) introduces a major new element into the series.  SG-1 is sent to Nasya to rescue survivors of a Goa'uld attack.  When she resuscitates a wounded man Dr. Carter (Amanda Tapping) is taken over by a Goa'uld and the only one who notices when SG-1 gets back home in young Cassandra (Katie Stuart).  Eventually O'Neill catches on and we learn that the Goa'uld in Carter is Jolinar of Malkshur, a leader of the Tok-ra Goa'ulds, a group in rebellion against the system lords.  The threat, he tells them, comes not from himself but from an assassin who will kill him by killing Carter.  Clearly in this second season there is an emphasis on expanding the show's roster of good Goa'ulds.  An above average episode involving paranoia at Stargate Command with long-range implications for the season and the series.  4.5 Stargates.
Episode 3, ""Prisoners"" (Written by Terry Curtis Fox, Aired July 10, 1998) are exploring a planet when a frantic fleeing man begs to be saved from his pursuers.  However, the man turns out to be a murderer fleeing justice and by helping him the SG-1 team is judged guilty of the same crime and receives the same punishment: life imprisonment on the prison world Hadante.  Oddly enough, the person who appears to be in charge in this brutal environment is Linea (Bonnie Barlett), an old woman who actually strikes fear into the hearts of the prisoners.  Linea is a scientist and if she can power the Stargate with a cold fusion power source, then SG-1 will help her escape with them.  This certainly sounds like a good deal, especially since General Hammond is making little progress in negotiating the team's release from their captors.  However, things just do not add up and the question is whether SG-1 can rework the math in time.  Hopefully down the road there will be a sequel to ""Prisoners,"" but even if there is not it will remain a classic episode with a great payoff at the end.  5 Stargates.
Episode 4 ""The Gamekeeper"" (Written by Jonathan Glassner & Brad Wright, Teleplay by Glassner, Aired July 17, 1998) offers the comic relief on this volume with guest star Dwight Schultz who plays the Keeper.  The SG-1 team travels to P7J989 where they find a beautiful garden and a dome containing metallic chambers housing unconscious humanoids.  While inspecting some empty chambers the team is ensnared.  The next thing we know O'Neil and Teal'c are reliving a mission Jack had in his younger days where he lost a man.  One of the members of his team was Captain Kawalsky (Jay Acovone).  Meanwhile, Dr. Jackson and Captain Carter relive the accident that killed his parents.  As soon as each scenario ends it restarts as if nothing had happened.  Both O'Neil and Jackson try to change ""history,"" but nothing works and eventually they both decided they do not want to play this sick game anymore.  That is when the Keeper (Schultz) shows up and explains they are being given a chance to make things right.  But the more the Keeper explains the situation and the rules, the more it becomes clear he is hiding something.  I can only imagine how many times they had to reshoot scenes because the cast was breaking up at Schultz's vocal affectation.  Even the most innocent lines become a real hoot with that voice he created for this character.  There is a slight hole in the episode in terms of the inability of O'Neill and Jackson to save these lives (O'Neill's soldiers apparently do not know how to do a standard reconnaissance of a building they want to attack), but Schultz's performance redeems such problems.  4.5 Stargates.
One classic episode and three above average adventures is pretty good for a single volume of ""Stargate SG-1"" episodes, but if you have been working your way diligently through the first season and beyond then you should be completely hooked on this intelligently crafted science fiction series.  I am most impressed by the effort to work in new elements right from the start of Season 2 to set up some important moments down the road.  You also have a pair of excellent guest stars in Barlett and Schultz.",1059696000,3,5673,4.692929292929293
1718467,5,B000067DNC,"This second season gives the viewer more insight into the SGC, and the characters as well. We get to see more of some of the races that were introduced in the first season, such as the Nox, and the Asgard, and even the Tok'ra, the latter two races being sworn enemies of the evil Goa'uld, although they fight them in different ways. The Tok'ra do their thing in secret while the Asgard fight openly in huge battleships, which by the way are really COOL to look at.
My personal favorite episodes of the season are Thor's Chariot and The Fifth Race, both epsisodes dealing with the Asgard. I like the Asgard because we learned that the aliens picked up at Roswell NM in the 40's were Asgard. Cool, huh?
This season could be a stand-alone, meaning, even if you don't own any of the other season dvds, you could pick this one up and understand what's going on, and enjoy the new material. Many of the episodes have moral messages. In one episode in particular, the message is 'Don't judge a book by it's cover', just as an example.
I enjoy TV that has a message. It makes me feel like the time I've spent in front of the tube has gotten me something tangible for my time.",1059004800,,1167,4.3577981651376145

1718479,5,B000067DNC,"I saw Stargate the movie and wasn't very impressed, but from the first time I saw an episode of SG-1, I was hooked. Stargate SG-1 is one of the greatest Sci-Fi TV series of all time. In my book the only thing that could beat it is Star Trek TNG. And this DVD series is much more affordable than it's Star Trek counterpart.
I was so excited when I found out they had the first two seasons of this on DVD. I went out and bought them immediately. All the tiny little nitpicks I had about the Season 1 set were solved in this one. Season 2 is a great season and the DVD set reflects that. I love the extras. The featurettes are all really interesting, although a couple more wouldn't have hurt, and we're still waiting for a Jack O'Neil one. I also think an audio commentary track on these episodes would be really great, but I can understand that that would be a huge undertaking. These DVDs are terrific and I'm counting the days till Season 3.",1053129600,2,942,4.238888888888889
1718480,5,B000067DNC,"Okay, basic premise: we find an alien space portal that lets us dial up a gateway to travel to planets all around the galaxy. Once you're over that hump, it's pretty simple.  As Gene Roddenberry once commented, Star Trek was a western TV set in outer space.  The same can be said of Stargate SG-1.
This series does better than much of the Star Trek franchise in considering the ethics and morality of our decisions.  Plot lines raised in one episode may come back unexpectedly in others.  Kevin Dean Anderson manages to suffuse his character with less of a MacGyver - but more of the Joe Everyman quality that makes him appealing.  The writers clearly love writing their characters, and there are very few two-dimensional characters.
Stargate may wind up as much a circus side show as Trekkers in the future.  But for now, this is an enjoyable romp with some hidden, if not too subtle, messages on morality and fairness.
Still, the series does feature a fair amount of violence and several series characters have been killed off, only to rise from the dead.  It's not a good choice for the small kids - but for us a big kids, this is definitely a great choice for late night and big bowl of popcorn.",1052352000,3,1199,4.5488372093023255

Richard Dean Anderson takes the role of the Kurt Russell character, and plays it in a superb manner.  Just the right ""bad attitude"".  The James Spader character is also here (I forget the actors name, sorry).  Added are Samantha Carter (A beautiful Amanda Tapping), sort of a ""science officer"", and a character who is one of the ""soldiers"" of the enemy, with the wolfs head armor type, who is now allied with the humans of Earth.  This makes a team of four....""SG-1"".  There are other SG team.  They explore the universe and battle to defend Earth and other planets.  I have been in scifi since 1960.  This series is superb!

1718482,5,B000067DNC,"Five great episodes on this DVD develope some of the existing story lines and explore new territory.
Ep. 5, Need, is about chemical dependancy and overcoming a god-complex.
Ep. 6, Thor's Chariot, is a great episode and further developement of the story of the alien race that protects Earth. One of the 2 episodes that make this disk worth buying.
In Ep. 7, Message in a Bottle, the team brings home an ""artifact"" that decides to take over Earth.
Ep. 8, Family, revisits the planet Chulak in order to save Teal'C's son. Unfortunately he doesn't want to be rescued, and endangers the team and the planet Earth.
Ep. 9, Secrets, is a double plot episode that brings back  Daniel Jackson's wife as he attempts to save her from the Goa'uld that has taken her for a host. At the same time Carter & O'Neill are off in Washington to receive a medal for what they did in Ep. 1, The Serpent's Lair. While there O'Neill is confronted by a reporter who threatens to blow the cover on the Stargate program, and Carter is confronted by a dying father who wants her to quit what she's doing to pursue her dream of becoming an astronaut. Key points of this episode are the introduction of Jacob Carter who plays prominently in later episodes, and Daniel finally getting to see his wife again. This episode is THE reason to buy this disk.
I highly recommend this DVD for anyone who wants some good basic episodes for viewing, or for those who want to revisit the history behind some of the current season's stories.",1049155200,,1498,4.548148148148148
1718483,5,B000067DNC,"Another great set of episodes from the 2nd season. The Serpent's Lair is of course the 2nd part to first season's cliff hanger finale. You'll love this episode even if you didn't see the first half of it. They also do a terrific job of filling you in on the previous episode so you don't feel lost.
In the Line of Duty is the introduction of the Tok'ra and specifically Jolinar who is mentioned repeatedly throughout the duration of the series. The episode itself it kind of thin, but it introduces and lays a foundation for later story lines.
Prisoners is more intense & will keep you guessing until the end. The crew is stranded on a prison planet because of crimes they unknowingly committed. They manage to rescue themselves by befriending another convict who was also seemingly misconvicted. Exciting end and lots of potential for future plots.
The Gamekeeper episode is rather shallow & not up to usual Stargate standards. Once again I felt like I was watching a take off on an old Star Trek episode. Still a couple of good episodes and one outstanding one make this DVD well worth the money!",1049155200,,1098,4.635897435897436

I go from about level 38 for convesations to 18 for guns and explosions.  Otherwise, it's either to quite to hear what they are saying or to loud during action. Also the MGM lion roars REAL loud when you put in the disk.  Thought it was just something wrong in my sound system, but a friend's wife mentioned it somewhere and got a bunch of replies saying they thought it was just them too.  Both Season One and Season Two are like this.  Still going to get the other seasons when they come out though.",1047168000,2,665,4.238095238095238

I am one that puts himself in a movie when it's worth it and let me tell you I had a few wet towels. I am glad to see Dean instead of Kurt as lead roll because of the humor differances between the two actors. I too would like to see a movie or two come out of this in the future but please no spinoffs unless they are as good or better.

1718486,4,B000067DNC,"Too cheap to pay for Showtime during it's original run, and unimpressed with the Stargate motion picture, ""Stargate SG-1"" didn't make it on my radar until the SF Channel started to broadcast reruns. What a pleasant surprise this series turned out to be. In spirit Stargate SG-1 reminds me powerfully of the original Star Trek, but set firmly in the late 1990s. Mankind is brash, flawed and out there exploring the universe, often before it's really ready.
Noteworthy is the series creators' careful attention to detail and continuity. Important ramifications from past episodes are not simply forgotten about, but are revisted in future episodes. Most importantly, this show has a great cast. Our four intrepid explorers of SG-1 have wonderful on-screen chemistry, and the support personnel back on Earth feel much like NASA mission control. Then there's the starring piece of hardware, the Stargate itself, as awesomely cool as any spaceship.
If I had to level a criticism, it's that most of the plots are less than original and will be familiar to most SF fans. I also sometimes wish that the writers wouldn't  pull their punches (there are times when I wish they'd gone for the throat like ""Babylon 5"" sometimes did). But these are fairly minor quibbles. This is simply wonderful SF entertainment.
As for the DVD set, some fans who've already seen all the episodes may be disappointed by the lack of special features.",1044748800,2,1420,4.991561181434599

You feel the connection between them even though in the back of your mind you know it's just Richard Dean Anderson talking to a puppet.

The only thing that really [makes me mad] is how slowly each season is being released on DVD in the US.  Seasons 1-5 (1 and 2 in boxed sets, and 3 being released 1-27-03) are already available in Europe!  Seasons 4 and 5 are available via 5-6 CD's, each containing 3-4 episodes...  Well, it stems from the fact that every cable channel on the planet (practically) is trying to make advertising dollars off of re-running the episodes.  They're not even smart enough to run them in order for God's sake.

The Serpent's Lair: A slam-bang, take no prisoners action-packed follow-up to Season 1's cliffhanger finale.
Prisoners: SG-1 are imprisoned unjustly and must escape with the help of a kindly old woman who is not what she seems.
Thor's Chariot: SG-1 returns to Cimmeria, and must try to contact the fabled Asgard to stop a Goa'uld invasion.
Secrets: A reporter threatens to expose the Stargate project to the world, Sam tries to reconcile with her estranged father, and Daniel reunites with his Goa'uld enslaved wife Sha're.
The Tok'ra: An epic and moving two-parter that introduces the Goa'uld rebels called the Tok'ra.
Touchstone: Someone on Earth is stealing valuable relics from other worlds, and SG-1 is blamed.
A Matter Of Time: Earth is in danger of being sucked into a black hole - through the Stargate!
The Fifth Race: After an alien encyclopedia is downloaded into his brain, Col. O'Neill undergoes a strange transformation that leads to contact with new allies.
Serpent's Song: SG-1's archenemy, Apophis, seeks sanctuary on Earth, but one of his foes will stop at nothing to retrieve him.
Show And Tell: A mysterious, invisible alien race threatens the destruction of all human life in the galaxy.
1969: A lighthearted romp through the Summer of Love ensues after SG-1 is thrown back in time.
This set should be at the top of any SG-1 fan's wishlist. With first-rate writing, acting, and special effects, Stargate SG-1's  second season is TV science fiction at its finest!",1037145600,8,1720,4.993031358885017
1718542,5,B000067DNC,"This is perhaps one of the most original series in science fiction history, and in its second season setups the events that drive this show for the next 2 seasons. I have a theory that most shows have their best or one of their best seasons their second season. Usually because they have already given a full season to introduce the characters to the public, and can expand them without undermining the basic characters. Such events take place when Sam becomes the Host of Jolinar, Daniel gets addicted to the sarcofagues, we see Col. O'Neill's dark side of rage and anger when Aphopis attempts to get help from the Tauri, and Teal'c dealing with issues of a long-distance father.

Every episode show great creativity and imagination, far beyond what most series do (some of which burn out even before they complete one season). Look beyond the fact that every world looks like Canada (the series is filmed there, a TV budget wouldn't allow for world travel)and everyone always seems to speak English (too hard to come up with a new language eac week)this is one good show. I think one of my personal favorites is the episode ""1969"" with it's time travel aspects but all of them are good.

Acting is pretty impressive, though sometimes they take themselves very seriously and go for oscar moments, but it's minimal. After watching the 2'nd season (in a few nights), I purchased the 1'st.

1718561,4,B000067DNC,"Stargate SG-1 is one of the best sci-fi series ever created, perhaps even one of the best TV series *Period*. Yes I know it's a bold statement, but it has merit. Season 2 is where the series really starts to take off, and lay ground work for some of the series key storylines. (Thor's Chariot, The Tok'ra, The Fifth Race, etc.) Argueably one of the best seasons, Season 2 packs a startling number of high quality episodes into one short 22 episode season.
Quality: 4
  Almost all of the episodes are high quality, must see episodes, and those that are not are at the very least decent.
Video: 3 1/2
  Picture quality is great, Wide Screen, very little distortion.
Sound: 4
  Boasting Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround sound, these DVDs sound great. Crisp and life-like, the sound is superb.
Packaging: 5
  The Box Set comes with a very attractive and useable case, each DVD is seperatly boxed with all of the information you need on the episodes, and more.
Special Features: 3
  Perhaps the DVD's biggest weakness, is lack of special features. If Special features are what your in it for, this may not be the box set for you. All DVDs come with Promotional trailers, and 3 of 5 DVDs come with a special featurette on a cast member or Producer.
Overall: A Solid 4
  Lack of Special features keep this Box set from getting a perfect 5, other than that this set is very very good, and I reccomend it to ANY SG-1 fan, new or veteran to the series.

1718591,5,B000067DNC,"WARNING!  SPOILERS.
Season 2 has it all man!  With ""The Serpent's Lair"" we see the conclusion to the 4-part conclusion of Season One's last 3 episodes.  And it's a doosey, let me tell ya.  And if you recall, the cliffhanger introduced us to a quite unique Goa'uld weapon commonly known as Zat Gun.  The first shot incompacitates, the second kills, the third disentagrates.  Well, Season 2 sees extended use of this weapon and it becomes an exciting new special effect.
But anyway enough of the Zat gun talk.  Season 2 sees SG-1 come into its own.  Lots of good episodes in this ste and I haven't even watched half of them yet.  Lots of good Goa'uld episodes.  In the episode ""Thor's Chariot"" we once again see the Horus-type System Lord Goa'ulds.  We also find out that these are Apothisis' mortal enemies.  We are also first introduced to the Asgard named ""Thor""  in an interactive hologram.
In Season 2 lots of loose ends are tied up from Season 1 as well as several new plot elements are revieled subtletly.  The existance of the 6th Season's Prometheus battleship program is revieled in the Season opener.
In the episode ""Secrets"" we find out what happened to Sha're, Daniel's wife from Abydos.  This discovery results in another confrontation with the Horus group System Lords.
We also discover the Tok'ra in this Season.  The Tok'ra are a group of Jaffa who are in rebellion from the evil System Lords and the Serpent Gods.  We see the Tok'ra in many up-coming episodes in later seasons.
So all in all, Season 2 has become known as one of the best seasons of the series and I can see why.  There really isn't one bad episode in the bunch and we see a lot of new plot arcs starting and other getting moved along from earlier.  The humor is still there and so is the episode ending ""oh boys"" (as in they've just let a bad guy get away) as the credits roll.  So if you like SG-1 in anyway, or are wondering just how good this series is, pick up Season 2 and if you hadn't already Season 1 as well.  Season 2 will show you just how good the writing is on this show.  I rate SG-1 right up there with Babylon 5 with story telling.",1031270400,2,2130,4.407692307692308
1718592,5,B000067DNC,"obviously if you are reading about stargate sg-1 SECOND season you are undoubtedly familiar with the ""THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH"".
  so i will tell you about the dvds themselves.when i reviewed the first season i lambasted M.G.M for screwing their customers.
after watching the entire second season in two days (i'm addicted) i want to apoligize to M.G.M ....RARELY DO YOU GET THIS KIND OF QUALITY FOR THIS KIND OF PRICE. there are inferior television series out there that sell for double and triple what M.G.M has made this available for..........BRAVO M.G.M.
now for the show...
  as i mentioned i bought the show on tuesday afternoon and had viewed all 22 episodes by thursday evening...(YES I WENT TO WORK) i kept telling myself ""just one more"" they're so good have another. maybe a 12 step program is in order....NAH!!!!!
 it's easy to call this ""SCI-FI"" and cat-hole it but even though the basis for the show is SCI-FI this show is more a mixture of.....okay hold your breath..... (science,action,drama,comedy,philosophical and theological fiction masterpiece!)
every episode continues to feed off previous episodes and yet each episode can do in 45 minutes by themselves what alot of feature length movies fail to do in 90+ MINUTES.....(that's entertain if you didn't get it)
  alot of the later seasons refer to events that happen in this season and only in this season.....SO BASICALLY IT IS NOT TO BE MISSED!
  if you have watched a couple of episodes of stargate sg-1 in a sporadic order on the many channels it has played and thought to yourself ""this shows pretty good i don't know what the fuss is about"" i encourage you (you are now encouraged)to pick up both season one and two and watch them in order you will look at stargate sg-1 with a whole new light.....

Season 2 is where Stargate finds its legs and really begins to get interesting. I live in Australia, and have had all of Season 2 since last year, so I can review this...
The Serpent's Lair -  Very cool episode, great way to start a season.
In the Line of Duty - BIG episode. Sets up many future events.
Prisoners - Interesting episode with consequences that reach into Season 3.
The Gamekeeper - Before there was The Matrix, there was The Gamekeepers World, although this one is more traumatizing!
Need - Michael Shanks, who plays Daniel Jackson, really shines in this one. That guy can act!
Thor's Chariot - Follow up to Season 1's ""Thor's Hammer"" and the introduction of the true Asgard, a very important race. Excellent ep too.
Message in a Bottle - Maybe not the greatest ep in the world, but has a great suspenceful begining.
Family - More with Teal'c family.
Secrets - Another big ep with far reaching consequences, even in Season 5 & 6!
Bane - More Colonel Mayborne antics!
The Tok'ra Part 1, The Tok'ra Part 2 - Important, if not terribly interesting eps.
Spirits - Quite a funny ep. Sees Captain Carter in command for the first time.
Touchstone - More Colonel Mayborne antics!
A Matter of Time - Very cool ep, introduces series semi-regular Major Paul Davis, played by Colin Cunningham
The Fifth Race - Another biggie as far as plot arcs go
Serpent's Song - The death of a great adversary!
Holiday - Funny ep. Quite nice with Shank's acting again coming out on top, and not just as Daniel Jackson this time!
One False Step - Interesting plot, great Jack/Daniel interaction
Show and Tell - Although the writers haven't latched onto this plot thread since, it's a great set up and a great episode
1969 - Time Travelling SG-1!!
Out of Mind - You'll never guess who shows up this time around. A great set up for Season 3's ""Into the Fire"" season opener!
Get this Boxed set, even if it's just to avoid having to buy the DVD's from the UK (which cost almost twice as much).
