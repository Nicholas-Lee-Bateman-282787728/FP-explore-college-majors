5448126,5,B00AKOMGZ8,"A friend sent me the website about this movie because she knows that human trafficking is a cause that is very near and dear to my heart. I watched the trailer and thought that it looked amazing but was disappointed that there would not be a showing in my state. I was thrilled when I found out that not only could I watch it on Amazon on Demand, but that some of the proceeds would go to organizations that fight human trafficking, like the Polaris Project.

This movie blew me away. The acting was superb and the portrayal of human trafficking in the US was dead on. The movie did not try to sensationalize anything and the violence is not too graphic. The movie tells the story in a very dignified way without resorting to shock tactics. ""Eden"" is a very entertaining, suspenseful thriller. Even if Human Trafficking is not a topic that interests you, I urge you to see this movie.",1367366400,24,884,4.45679012345679
5448127,5,B00AKOMGZ8,Well done all around. It deals with the difficult topic of human trafficking without being salacious. Not for the squeamish.,1366848000,4,124,5.25
5448128,5,B00AKOMGZ8,"""Eden"" tells the story of a young Korean-American girl who is kidnapped and sold into slavery by human traffickers. The movie follows her on her terrifying ordeal as she ascends the ranks within the organization and tries to plot her escape. ""Eden"" takes a very real subject that is little talked about here in the USA and turns it into a highly suspenseful and riveting movie that is both entertaining and enlightening.

The acting is phenomenal across the board, with Jamie Chung especially shining in the lead role. Beau Bridges and Matt O'Leary also turn in excellent performances as the villainous leaders of the trafficking ring. Also deserving of mention is the superb direction by rising female director Megan Griffiths, who brings a level of emotional sensitivity and realism to the film that is often lacking in most mainstream movies. All in all, this is an emotionally exhilarating movie will leave you on the edge of your seat while still delivering an important message about this very real issue that plagues our world.",1366675200,19,1034,4.976878612716763
5448129,5,B00AKOMGZ8,"Based on the real life events of Chong Kim, the action in Eden starts from the opening scene and moves right up to the dramatic finish.  Jamie Chung really showcases her broad array of talents in the lead role as a kidnapped teenager, for whom mere survival becomes a struggle on many levels.  Director Megan Griffiths deserves kudos for her work in bringing this film to life.  You will never view the ""adult entertainment"" world the same after watching this movie.",1364428800,3,466,4.728395061728395
5448130,4,B00AKOMGZ8,"I think the first half of the movie is very interesting and engaging.  The second half when the main character Eden is allowed to partake in assisting the business, the story became a little less real for me but still kept my interest.  The story ended without us knowing if the criminals behind the kidnapping, human trafficking, forced prostitution and baby selling were caught and brought to justice. We also do not know what happened to the main character.  I didn't think the kitten scenes were necessary.  Movies should not use or promote breeding of animals.  Towards the end, when the main character spikes the pipe, it seems doubtful that such a small amount of aerosol could kill immediately.  And the needle she used to kill another would only work if injected into a vein, I would think. It would be interesting to know how much of this was true.  Whether true story or not, it is still worth watching as human trafficking and forced prostitution do happen here in the U.S.",1524355200,,985,4.691860465116279

5448132,4,B00AKOMGZ8,"Good film, sad but potent. It's the type of film that makes one question whether the human race deserves to survive. Kidnapping, sex trafficking, sexual assault, child rape, torture, murder...all in the name of profit. Well cast film with a overall good script. A bit conservative avoiding more grisly details except for the nom nom head scene but the restraint is appreciated here. Otherwise, Eden becomes torture porn which is becoming too popular these days for all the wrong reasons. I recommend this film with the warning for viewers to be aware of the grim subject matter and the reality that similar situations presented in the film are happening all over the world as we sit reading and typing about them.",1517875200,,713,4.900826446280992
5448133,4,B00AKOMGZ8,"I thought this was another exploitation film where there was a desolate warehouse holding the women,where guys would visit and um sha lalala.  But instead the women spend more time outside the warehouse than inside and are farmed out to sex parties,  Wich didn't make since of the amount of people they killed to cover up the warehouse.",1517443200,,336,4.775862068965517

5448135,5,B00AKOMGZ8,"Excellent movie! One reviewer said all older teens should see this, but younger ones should too because they are also at risk. It's not uncommon for this to happen to girls (and sometimes boys) as young as 9 or 10. This particular film does not have the extreme graphic violence that many movies about trafficking do so it's not too much for kids to handle.",1515888000,,357,4.507692307692308
5448136,3,B00AKOMGZ8,"the acting was great.  SPOILER: I've watched video interviews with Chong and I watched the film, does anyone know why she just didn't call 911? It doesn't make sense. She knew where all the places were and who was involved. She knew where her friend was....so instead of calling mom, why not 911. This makes me believe that maybe the allegations against her are rue. She seems very smart, so why be dumb in that moment. This is why I gave 3 stars",1514678400,,446,4.373493975903615

5448145,5,B00AKOMGZ8,"As a Millennial lifelong learner, I always seek out activities that I can learn something from such as watching movies of interest on Amazon Prime Video that expand my horizon. This particularly film caught my eye initially because of its movie poster and premise, but after watching it was the story that will stick with me for the rest of my life. Why do I say this? The film's production on a real life human trafficking event showcased how injustice is present around us it's just that we are so focused on living our own individual lives that we can't notice much else going on. In this way, I believe this film's message is that individuals have the choice whether to do good or bad in life depending on what they focus on. What choice drives you in life? Watch this film and see how you react to it. I think it'll tell you a lot about yourself and what you value most in life.",1495065600,3,883,4.357575757575757

5448152,4,B00AKOMGZ8,"This movie was about human trafficking.  Eden was a young Chinese girl living with her father in a poor community.  Over weekends, she went to a local bar socializing with Mr. Right.  A natural way of life.  However, mobs joined in and extended a terror effect.  The behind-the-scene boss was not revealed.  A high-rank police officer acted as a supervisor of this daily human trafficking business.  He hired a baby-face killer and seducer, some bouncers, a Mexican old woman and various underground drug-sellers.
The plot was simple and straightforward.  Eden was seduced, drugged, raped, chained and forced to sell sexual services.  She was just one of these abducted girls, living in a farm-like warehouse.  Hey, they were not prostitutes.  They were sex-slaves, treated like dogs or pigs.  The journey moved on with the supervisor and a bouncer killed as commanded by their boss.  Eden later found out a Spanish speaking pregnant woman was also kidnapped.  The intention was obvious and cruel: To sell the new-born baby.  Really sick stuff.
To the end, Eden got two chances to kill her seducer and a drug-seller on a single day.  She even helped free the baby-loss woman.  Feeling safe
from being seen or chased, Eden called her father, ...  A happy ending for Eden though illogical as it was.",1482105600,,1297,4.925925925925926
5448153,4,B00AKOMGZ8,I'd say it was a pretty accurate depiction of the sex trade. Having a cop running it with a drug addict was infuriating.

5448162,5,B00AKOMGZ8,"A True Wake up Call for all young women,men,teenagers,and parents. This story was directed very well,but i have to say,i was completely horrified to think this type of evil exist. I have seen some films about human trafficking,but never including the raw details. It made me sick to my stomach,and terrified for those who will,or have encountered such evil beings. This movie was real, raw, vicious,but truthful. Traffickers do not look the way you think in appearance. These monsters actually look like real human beings,or sometimes the average Joe next door. This movie, and the reality of what is going on out there,is seriously scary. It makes me wonder about having children in a world like this. Honestly,i know this idea may sound like a crazy suggestion,but i think every parent or grandparent who has teens or young adults around them,should let them see this. No matter how brutal it may seem,i guarantee, this will make them think before doing something stupid. The movie can be an eye opening lesson to teens,and young adults. Perhaps,the ones whom feel like being destructive, because life may seem boring,or their parent may be too strict. This can be a lesson of comparison of what goes on and how evil people are out there awaiting an opportunity to steal their innocence. Now, i am not speaking about a young child or teenager who might be going through abuse by a parent or guardian,but the ones that feel their parents are too strict,or that life is just boring. l pray for all young girls and women, whom do not fully comprehend the world we live in. It is a much higher market in selling women than men, which is why the focus is on girls. Girls,and women have to be smart about where they go,and whom they go with..Be alert, no matter how sweet the face. I am in my 30's, and i am still careful. It is good to be optimistic,while not wanting fear to paralyze you, but still you have to be aware and conscious of the time we are living in. Be safe everyone!",1471996800,,1979,4.625
5448163,5,B00AKOMGZ8,As much as I am sickened by the content I have to give this 5 stars. This could have been hard to watch. This could have been disgusting and cringeworthy but it was done in a way that I didn't feel as though the actors and actresses were abused in the process of filming and the making of the movie as I sometimes do. I don't feel that I need to see the repulsive underbelly to know how disgusting it really is. The director tastefully and effectively gets extremely delicate messages across in a manner that leaves the viewer feeling educated rather than victimized themselves.,1470182400,,578,4.514285714285714

5448175,5,B00AKOMGZ8,"I have vivid dreams for 15 years now of this concept.  I am sure they will censor or label me as crazy or what ever for what i will say.  But often (at least once a month) i have vivid reoccurring dreams.  Where i observe someone's process of eradicating with extreme leathal force the people involved with the operations of sex slave.  I watch them locate and remove men and women who are foot soldiers in this underground abduction and trafficking.  I watch them study the targets.  And plan the right time.  And go in thru stealth and force.  Attacking the working hands of these operations and when the last one is dead.  They pull out a cell phone and dial 911 and leave.  Crocked and criminal are given the kind of justice suited for a evil wolf by these sheep dogs fighting to return what has been taken.

In whole.  Movies like this are important.  Because in a world when the mindless masses are brainwashed by american idel and sports.  They tend to forget there is someone's daughter crying alone begging to go home to an evil that needs to yet be conquered.

It is my only shame that when i wake.  They are yet just vivid dreams.  And; not a reality that i am helping to fix.  Wwwww",1463097600,,1194,4.35

Or perhaps I have watched so many silly flicks that I've become jaded.  This movie is a bore.  The acting sucks.  It runs in circle and it is too familiar.

p.s. for those who claim that this tale is based on the true story of Kim Chong (a.k.a Eden), check out Wikipedia not IMDB.  She is a fraud who told fantastic tales to our very naive and generous society.  She is a sociopath and a pathological liar.

Still I tried to watch this movie for the fiction that it actually is.  I was fast-forwarding and dosing off.

I watched the regular DVD first and was disappointed that there was no regular Blu-ray for the english market but the Dutch market seemed to be big enough to make it for them.  The BD quality is great.  I will add that it is lighter to show the detail in the blacks but at times this has the whites blow out or have no detail.  If I was the colorist ( digital video adjuster ) I would have lowered the contrast but they want to keep it high to show the grain in the film which will give a sharper impression.  There is lots of detail.  The description said ""SPECIAL FEATURES: Interactive Menu, Scene Access"" but I couldn't get to them during the previews or the main movie & no interactive screen appeared as it usually does after the previews.  So, I had to watch it with the english subtitles.  If anyone knows how to access the interactive screen please let the BD buyers know.  I tried every access button I had on my controls with no luck.

I understand that things can move and change very rapidly in the sex-slavery scene, but I found it hard to follow some of the cuts.  That said, the story was believable though horrifying.  I have read an interview with the woman on whose own experience the movie is based, and the movie follows her story pretty faithfully, with a few exceptions, no doubt intended to up the film's commercial success.  I think this film would be a great one to show in 7th grade Social Studies--no, I am not kidding--to show the kids what can really happen, not so much as a cautionary tale as a consciousness raiser.  Girls need to be careful not to fall for a ""lover boy,"" boys need to develop compassion for the condition of being a girl.

5448198,4,B00AKOMGZ8,"The Abduction of Eden was a film with heavy content overall, but it still manages to bring an important message to light.

If you've been skimming over the reviews listed here on amazon, you may have read how this film is supposed to be based off of the true story of Chong Kim, who was abducted in the mid-nineties. However, some people claim that she may have been lying about the incident, due to inconsistencies in her story over the years. In any case, I'm not going to make a judgment on whether she was telling the truth or not.  The situation in the film is nothing to make light of.

In the film, Jamie Chung plays the role of Hyun Jae, a high school student who gets abducted one night after she goes out, on what she thinks, is a romantic interlude with a sex trafficking predator. She's driven off to a remote facility where she and several other girls are held against their will. They are then forced into the sex trade. The girls in the film range in age. Some are supposed to be as young as 12 while others look like they may be in their early 20s.

First, Jamie Chung is forced to make an S&M video where she and another girl are cuffed and then whipped by a dominatrix. Eventually she's forced, by her handlier, to see Jon's. It's a pretty disturbing situation overall and pulls at your heart strings, but that's the purpose of the film. You eventually begin to follow Chung's plight and the details of her daily life. The film takes some thrilling twists and turns until it reaches a conclusion where Chung eventually escapes from her whole ordeal.

I have to say, this film does a good job of depicting the horrors these young girls face once they get abducted into this life. Jamie Chung, in particular, did an excellent job of conveying her emotions at times without using any words. There were several scenes where she had no dialogue at all, but her expressions and demeanor communicated how she was feeling. I can see why she was recognized as an up and coming actress after this role.

The film doesn't spend much time on how cruel this world can be in graphic way though. It does however, depict how some girls move up through the ranks to try to get more control over the situation they're in. Jamie Chung's character does this to great effect, as she gains the confidence of her pimp. It gains her access to easier jobs that don't include relationships with the Jons.  I guess that's something to strive for, when you're in a bad situation, not of your own making.

The other aspect in the film, that I found interesting, was how the sex traffickers justified what they were doing to the girls. The idea that the girls are better off in this lifestyle is mentioned once by Matt O'Leary, since many of them come from bad backgrounds. Such as parents who are drug addicts. Of course that's not a justification, but the way they convince themselves of this is eye opening. The film also shows how volatile this lifestyle can be for the traffickers. Between the drug use; the worries over being backstabbed by others in the organization, and the fear of being caught by authorities, there's plenty for them to worry about.

In the end I gave the film a four. The four is mainly due to Jamie Chung's performance, which made the film engaging overall. I also thought the director did a good job presenting this material without being too pushy and off color with the details. But this is not a film to take lightly. It's a film with heavy undertones. It also reveals how vulnerable young women can be if they are picked up by the wrong guy. It could serve as an example for young women to be very careful while they're out and about. And about who they're hanging out with. I believe that was one of the intended messages here.

A well-made film, but I'd only recommend it if your have an interest in this story or about how terrible things can be for these girls. Having seen several other films staring Jamie Chung is what brought me to this movie. I was interested in her acting here, since she was recognized for her role in this film. But this is in no way a family movie, nor a good date movie. It's more of an informative film about sex trafficking that still manages to create a thriller-esque type atmosphere along the way. If that's what you're looking for, you can give it a try. It's kind of like reading a heavy book. So just know that before going in.",1405382400,7,4388,4.446517412935323

You can't just watch this movie as if you're just some viewer watching a movie...you have to imagine yourself in it and think about your own family and loved ones.  So many people live in their own little worlds and think ""nothing can happen to me"". When we think of these victims, they seem to be subhuman or a world away from our own, but they are our brothers and sisters.  Everyone is related to each other, and is vulnerable to the same things in life.

There are many sides to human trafficking that this movie does not go over.  There are many situations that lead to someone's abduction, and there are a variety of ways that the crime groups can go about things and a variety of things that could happen.

5448214,4,B00AKOMGZ8,"Based on a true story Eden is about a Korean American girl of nineteen who is abducted one night by a criminal gang and is forced into prostitution. They are aided by a corrupt policeman in the shape of Bob Gault played with the right amount of self righteous, brooding contempt by Beau Bridges. The abductee is Jamie Cheung (actually 30 years old) who had me convinced she was an innocent nineteen year old. The prison master and uber pimp Vaughan is played by an eerily threatening yet at the same time, vulnerable Matt OLeary in a performance that is full of conviction.

The action takes place at a make shift prison in the desert where these girls are farmed out until they are of no use and then its game over. Eden is the stage name given to Cheung by her captors and she realises that her one avenue of escape and/ or survival is to gain the confidence of her gaolers and become, in all but name, one of them.

This is a surprisingly good film, despite the subject matter there is no gratuitous sex scenes or indeed nudity, it is mostly done off screen or in such a way as to let your imagination do the work, so this is not a soft porn film by any stretch of the imagination.

It is well acted and directed (Megan Griffiths) and tackles a dark and unsettling subject with a lot of care. There are a few plot holes (check out the IMDb page) and some of the on screen antics leave a few questions unanswered, however this is not a history lesson and I feel should be judged as a piece of filmatic entertainment and on that score it rates quite highly indeed.",1384041600,3,1565,4.2983050847457624

5448216,3,B00AKOMGZ8,"To me, films like this are the true definition of horror, because they really happened. Anyone can look up the graphic details on Wikipedia and see that not only did it happen here, but it happened fairly recently. Hyun-Jae was just a typical California teenager, who went out to party one night. She met a man, left with him, and quickly learned he wasn't what he appeared to be. Hyun-Jae is sold into prostitution and has no other choice, but to be a sex slave for the next three years. The film was very well done, in that it didn't go over the top. Abduction of Eden showed us, what we needed to see, in order to understand and be shocked by what happened, but it didn't go so far as to desensitize us to the story. Jamie Chung, A.K.A. Stu's wife from the Hangover, stars as Hyun Jae, and her performance was really key to how the audience would react to what was happening. Equally as good, was the jailer, Matthew O'Leary. It took me a while to recognize his as the kid from Domestic Disturbance and Spy Kids 2, and it was shocking to see how quickly he grew up. He was this horrible guy, doing terrible things, but there was a part of you that saw him as trapped as the girls were and you couldn't help but feel sorry for him. The cast makes the film, it's as simple as that. Abduction of Eden was a story that was fast moving and somewhat graphic, but ultimately predictable. Films like this one could go either way, it all comes down to just what they show and who they cast, and the producers of this film did an outstanding job of both.",1381017600,8,1547,4.26530612244898

I once lived next door to a cat house in New Orleans, where, according to a neighbor, the girls were paid in drugs. At night, there were so many cop cars parked there, at first I thought it was a police substation. The ladies all looked to be in their twenties or older. Drugs and poverty seem to be the main driving forces. Pimps who addict their stable of women to drugs are every bit as wrong as sex slavers. The movie highlighted the fact that this business goes on right under our nose. Legalizing prostitution would bring it in the open and get rid of the dark forces that parasite on this antiquated trade. Having sex with a minor is a serious crime with long prison sentences attached. As a 12 year old girl who ran away from home and became a prostitute, said on TV. Among her customers were lawyers, judges, cops, businessmen and a wide variety of citizens who all knew how old she was.

As you've probably surmised, ABDUCTION of EDEN is not entirely ""fun"" to watch, but it's no more disturbing than it has to be. It's also utterly rewarding in its revelation of an often-ignored problem in this country via a well-detailed and riveting story-line. Director Megan Griffiths did an outstanding job of treading a very thin line, making the film as tasteful as possible considering the subject matter--i.e., no gratuitous nudity--without sugar-coating the story. The level of empathy the audience attains with these poor girls is quite extraordinary. ABDUCTION of EDEN remains convincing despite several unlikelihoods and plot-holes. While this film may appear predictable at first glance, there are some truly unexpected developments here.

Though a bit larger-than-life in places in what appears to be a very hopeless situation, Jamie Chung is just hypnotic as victim-heroine ""Eden."" The script is similarly believable and carries a lot of weight in developing Eden and the other characters. The mistrustful alliance she builds with one of her abductors(well-played by Matt O'Leary) is as immediate as everything else in this film and is one of its realest aspects. The supporting cast who play characters we never get to know that well, particularly Tantoo Cardinal as ""The Nurse,"" also contribute a great deal to ABDUCTION of EDEN's success.
