He's not only a great artist, but he has an exceptional ability to use his immense talents to visualize someone else's dream.  This video shows every step of a commissioned art piece, from the first letter to the scanning and delivery.  I'm a rank amateur as an artist, but I learned a tremendous amount the first time I watched this lengthy video.  I watch it again every few months, and as my skills (such as they are) grow, I am able to see new tips and techniques with each viewing.
This is basically a chance to sit at the elbow of one of the best artists of our time, and listen to him explain his thoughts and decisions as he creates a beautiful masterpiece.  I'd pay a lot more than the price of this video for that chance!",1447718400,,787,4.29054054054054

While the content may be best suited for intermediate to advance artists, beginners have A LOT to gain from this tutorial.
