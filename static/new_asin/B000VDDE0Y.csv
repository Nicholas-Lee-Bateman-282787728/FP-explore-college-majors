Edit: Ok, I lied, I love this season, who am I kidding? I just rewatched some episodes and it really is a matter of perspective whether you enjoy some episodes or not, theres always 'good stuff' hidden in Frasier, you just have to be ready to find it! lol..The episode Star Mitzvah had me in stitches! My favorite episode was Roe To Perdition! Also Fraternal Schwinns was hilarious! I may be guessing that I said that it wasn't one of the better seasons since there was some emotional heaviness due to Niles' illness and all but they did approach it in such an endearingly sweet and smart way.",1449360000,,750,4.39568345323741

2937795,5,B000VDDE0Y,"I was attempting to try and think of another sitcom that was as good, so I might try to have something to compare Frasier.  I tend to like to compare and contrast with another series. It took me a while comparing almost anything that there was. Cheers would be a good second or perhaps Friends, might come close.

Frasier is delightfully written and the cast fits perfectly with the other and yet it was adult enough to attract adults. It is rare that a sitcom can fit into many viewers outlook and be entertained. Maybe the next most realistic show might be Everyone loves Raymond,but did lack Raymond growing up at least with slow steps. I would have felt sorry for any woman that had to deal with Raymond and I hope children do not grow up thinking that what they had was a ""normal"" life?

Frasier I have seen several times and the only real oddball of the bunch turns out to be Frasier. His brother, Niles at least knows he is not capable of doing thing, but at least does not brag, telling people he knows what he is doing. Dad seems to be the anchor to keep things going, a star in his own right.

One thing for sure, tv shows do not last 11 years for the most part. Once in a greet while a show comes along and is close, but even at the end, you wanted to have the show continue for another couple of years? That is how good the series is.",1409616000,,1346,4.185328185328185

2937843,5,B000VDDE0Y,"The series is indeed an adult comedy which flourishes under those who participated in it. With a knowledge of Kelsey Grammar's nightmarish real life, I am amazed at the performances he gave over eleven seasons. This alone makes it a classic. The character of Niles has gone on to broadway and in many ways the others involved have created an undisputed comedy series that will top the charts for decades. I save the last comment for the character of Roz. As I told my wife, the writers surely took a man and put him into a woman's body... unbelievable princess of comedy. Finally I must note that I recently joined Prime. Without Amazon's program I would never have been able to enjoy the last two seasons, most of which I have not been able to enjoy before... and without commercials!",1389139200,,785,4.614285714285714

I am so glad I ordered the 9th, 10th and final seasons on DVD.  I had seen most of season 9 in reruns but none of 10. I have never laughed so hard in my life at some of these episodes. I just laughed out loud so hard that I cried and how often does that happen especially with the supposedly sitcom comedies we have forced on us now.  If you are a fan of Frazier and have never seen season 10 be sure to order it.  It is a treasure. I can't wait to watch the Final Season.

A lot of yelling and anger in the later seasons after David Angell died.  This season however has some good Daphne and Niles episodes.  With Daphne's mother written in to rant and rave, as Frasier has been doing for the last few seasons, there are still too many angry episodes for this to be considered a comedy anymore though.",1380844800,,455,4.392857142857143

2937863,5,B000VDDE0Y,"'Frasier' is the wittiest, most highly developed sitcom in television history. The delicate balance of intellectual, high-brow, affluence and self-depricating, non-assuming buffoonery was an eleven year tightrope extravaganza like none witnessed before or since. The character development of  a ""post Cheers"" Frasier (and Lilith) was beautifully orchestrated in a manner that caused the show's viewership to simultaneously idolize and jokingly jeer at this lovably irritating Seattle-soaked shrink.

Week after week, month after month, and year after year, the writers, cast, and crew of 'Frasier' delivered more than quality entertainment. They created a half-hour 'sigh of relief' for an ultra-stressed American viewing public that related to the story lines of divorce, strained family relationships, and the desire to make today better than yesterday. What would have merely been scripted story lines of hollow, 'hollywood hope' was masterfully transformed into a shared experience the viewers could invest emotionally in. And they did. For eleven years. To the creators, writers, directors, cast and crew of 'Frasier' I extend a well deserved ""Bravo!"" and heartfelt ""Thank You!""",1376006400,,1183,5.832369942196531

2937872,4,B000VDDE0Y,"Even the fashions seem current. I love it as adult comedy, but that is also my point of restraint. Their treatment of totally adult themes (like sperm motility and boy/girl sleepovers) is contrary to my Christian values. I watch nonetheless because of the rich laughter in other places. This deserves a spot near the top in the category ""best writing on TV"". Some of the routines are extraordinary. I think in particular of a scene where Niles ius trying to iron out a wrinkle in the seam of his pants,. and winds up - well, I won't spoil it for those who have yet to see it. This is among the best, if not THE BEST, slapstick routines since Abbott and Costello did ""who's on first"".

Frasier was a show that was one when I was growing up, so I had not really seen it.

Once Niles and Daphne get together at the end of season 8 the show quickly goes from the usual humor style to more of a soap opera feel. I mainly bought it because I have the first 9 seasons and wanted to complete the set.

If you're not a huge fan, I would recommend buying season 6, or one of the earlier seasons (excluding season one, which I also believe was just not as funny). But if you're like me and want to have the complete series, this is worth buying.",1323043200,,533,4.125

Most of the episodes are still enjoyable and some are pretty good, but here and there throughout the season there are moments or episodes that seem kind of embarrassingly uncomfortable compared to past seasons. In a number of cases, the characters don't quite seem themselves. I also wasn't terribly fond of the character of Daphne's mother.

2937917,5,B000VDDE0Y,Frasier has managed to be funny without profanity and without a political agenda.  The first season was hilarious and every season since has been better.  I'm sorry to see the series stop after 11 years and I hope something comes to take its place as a comedy series that the family can watch.,1207440000,,293,4.509433962264151
2937918,1,B000VDDE0Y,"I'm giving this one star because of the vague ominous disclaimer ""some episodes may be edited from their original network versions"" stated in bold letters on the back of the packagaing.  Come again?  What does this even mean?  The fat cats at Paramount apparently love to do this often - in researching online exactly WHAT has been censored or edited in the DVD versions, it seems they did this with the ""Wings - Fifth Season"" boxset as well.  And notice how every other season of Frasier except 9 & 10 say ""The COMPLETE xxth Season"" on the cover""?  Why does Season 10 omit the word ""complete""?  I smell conspiracy.  That's why I gave this crummy hack-job only 1 star.  Every episode is brilliant, and if you liked the other seasons there's no reason you shouldn't like this one too.

Only the first disc has the previews/ads that you have to 'next chapter' through, the others go right to the menu; thank you Paramount.

2937922,5,B000VDDE0Y,"Carrying on from a strong Season 9, television's best sitcom delivers another fine dose of intelligent, well written humour.
Season highlights include a Bar Mitzvah blessing spoken in Klingon, Crane (attempted) dictatorship over the Condo Board and shady dealings in the Caviar underworld.
Not to mention another visit from Lilith, and a cameo by Dr Phil.

The Niles and Daphne relationship remains a focal point throughout the season, with their wedding(s) and the couple's dealing with Niles' health crisis. A nice shift in focus here as one of the story's longest running subplots is allowed sufficient screen time; something which was somewhat lacking in Seasons 8 and 9.

The three parter (Bristle While You Work, Rooms With A View & Don't Go Breaking My Heart) at times resembles more of a Drama than Comedy, however this is to the show's benefit.

As usual, excellent performances by the entire cast and plenty of the superb writing we've all by now come to expect with each episode. A season not to be missed.",1202515200,4,1017,4.935672514619883

The arc of the season is uneven, even taking us to a particularly serious storyline of Niles' heart condition. There are bright spots - episodes Father and Sons (featuring David Ogden Stiers as a family friend whose similarity to Niles and Frasier has Martin doubting he is their father) and Door Jam (where Niles and Frasier try and move up to the gold level of an exclusive spa) are two of the best in all eleven series.

2937934,5,B000VDDE0Y,"Frasier was/is my favorite show and season 10 was the last installment to be released. It took a while but it was well worth it when I finaly got it! Frasier is one of the series that never lost its edge during it's entire (11 year) run. The stories were always fresh and while there were running story lines, individual episodes never repeated themes, the charachters were always consistantly funny and the dry intelectual humour was easily understood by everyone. If I had to pick favorites I would say the relationship between Niles and Frasier provided the most consistent laughs although all the other charachters were funny too. Niles's low key dry wit and physical humour and Frasiers straight man sarcastic dry comments cannot be surpassed anywhere else on TV. This season of Frasier was consistantly excellant as were all 10 of the other seasons, it would be hard for a Frasier addict like me to pick a favorite. I would HIGHLY recommend this entire series to anyone!",1200096000,5,976,4.815476190476191

I have waited years for Niles and Daphne to get together too so it all comes together in the last few years.

2937938,2,B000VDDE0Y,"Very desappointing beginning of Season 10th, despite such a long wait for the DVD.... the story between Niles and Daphne since they are a couple is losing its main interest, and it seems that the actors are just engaged in a routine, and too much pathos (Niles and his heart surgery) is spoiling the fun... Funnily enough the 11th season is much better , but as any Frasier fan, you will buy it whatever, since a bad Frasier is still better than anything else on TV in the comedy range....",1199232000,7,489,4.444444444444445

2937940,4,B000VDDE0Y,"Well it certainly took long enough, but we finally have the 10th season of Frasier to enjoy.

A marked improvement from Seasons 8 & 9, winning episodes include ""Fathers & Sons"", ""Daphne Does Dinner"" & ""Fraternal Schwinns"" which has some wonderful visual gags of Niles & Frasier trying to learn how to ride bikes. While the physical timing of many episodes (""The Ring Cycle"" for example) is rather off it's better than most series could ever hope for.

Once again there are no extras but at least we don't have to suffer through previews on Disc One as you can choose to go straight to the main menu.  Compared to the Seinfeld DVDs, I have to wonder why Frasier gets such a poor treatment. This is one of the great sitcoms of all time, can't we at least get some bloopers, commentary, or at least a list of Emmy wins? I suppose not unless we get a Blue Ray ""Ultimate"" edition.

We have quite a few guest appearances this season; unfortunately none of them are particularly memorable.  Dean Cain, Brent Spiner, Bob Hoskins & particularly Nana Visitor who spent seven years starring in Star Trek: Deep Space 9 only to be regulated to a few minutes in ""Daphne Does Dinner"". I wonder just exactly why she took this job since she doesn't even get a close up, not to mention any memorable lines.

Also, if you look at the small print on the DVD box, you'll see that some of the episodes may be from the syndicated run instead of the original full length versions. I would think that if CBS Video had the original masters for the previous 10 DVD releases, why do they not in this particular season? This is rather disturbing, especially since they do not indicate which episodes are from the syndicated run.

Having said all that, I have enjoyed this DVD edition and would recommend it to all Frasier fans.

Tidbits:

- The final tally of spine photos is as follows: Eddie 4, Frasier 6, Eddie & Frasier 1

  -  Dr. Phil once played football for the University of Tulsa...and he was a linebacker when  Houston scored 100 points on them back in 1968. Interestingly enough, Larry Gatlin was a wide receiver on the Houston team.

- Yes, that is Elvis Costello (""Farewell Nervosa"") who is called a ""young man"" by Frasier even though he's actually a year older than Kelsey Grammer.",1199059200,6,2267,4.535626535626536

2937942,1,B000VDDE0Y,"I awaited today's date to arrive anxiously and rushed to the store today to complete my Frasier collection...and before opening the package (which I still haven't), I noticed in tiny print, ""SOME EPISODES MAY BE EDITED FROM THEIR ORIGINAL NETWORK BROADCASTS.""  I am livid!!  I frantically got out the other seasons to be sure they hadn't said the same thing! None did.

Not only must we expect that ""some"" of the episodes in Season Ten ""may be"" edited, we aren't told which ones or even how many, and are even led to believe that they only ""MAY BE EDITED"". I feel ripped off and furious.

Somewhere lost in my collection of thousands of unwatched VHS tapes are the original network airings of this season, which I'd never gotten around to watching, and which were taped after I'd moved across the country and was using only a rabbit ears antenna that year on the lowest signal station in town, which came in completely snowy and sometimes the reception was so bad that even the sound was screwed up.

I bought these DVD sets to have complete, perfect versions of a show that I watch over and over every single day. This is a slap in the face and I want to know WHY they did this.

2937943,5,B000VDDE0Y,"I would say that I speak for myself but after reading most of the reviews, I believe that most feel as I do. The ""Frasier"" TV sitcom has got to be the all time Classic of the century. The writing was superb, the directing was flawless and the acting was non other than brilliant. I have never enjoyed a sitcom as much as I have this one. I did not watch the series prior to re-runs as I was taken by the movies that Lifetime aired on cable and had no knowledge of ""Frasier"" at that time. But when I finally did come across the series, I was totally hooked. The actors, every single one of the main actors, gave brilliant performances and in my opinion, all seemed to have bonded with one another as a true family. Their feelings for each other surely showed with each episode. They have all gone onto something new and will be an asset in any venture they choose but, I believe that ""Frasier"" will always be the crowning glory of their careers. I have all the other seasons encluding the Eleventh and Final season and when the Tenth Season arrives in the next few days, I will have the complete series. I could not be more pleased with my purchase because I truly enjoy each and every episode time and time again. To be completely honest, there are not that many programs on TV that I would classify as really good programs. Some may make you laugh now and then but ""Frasier"" not only makes you laugh, it makes you feel good. There is an episode or two that will put tears in your eyes and that is good as it touches your heart and allows you to express heartfelt feelings. For anyone who may be thinking about getting a ""Frasier"" DVD, do not hesitate, as you will not be disappointed. I watch these DVD's quite frequently and can speak each actor's part and I will say that I do not get tired of seeing them. Even knowing when a certain line is sure to get me laughing, the anticipation gets me laughing before the actor has spoken a word. Kelsey Grammer, John Mahoney, David Hyde Pierce, Jane Levees, Peri Gilpin, Moose (Eddie) and Anthony LaPaglia are fabulous, brilliant, perfection and irreplaceable. Anthony LaPaglia who played Daphne's brother, Simon, was truly brilliant in his character portrayal of someone always consuming beer, outspoken, loud at times and his accent was none other than perfect. 10 stars to Mr. LaPaglia.  Watch Mr. LaPaglia in ""Without a Trace"" and you can clearly see how his portrayal of an English speaking beer drinking brother is such gifted actor. To all the directors, writers, crew and especially the actors, ""thank you"" for bringing laughter into this world, episode after episode.",1197244800,16,2621,4.552966101694915

I think they got too focused on how many special guest stars they could get and let writing quality go down.  However, all seasons of the show are worth your while.  Overall, when you buy the complete series you will buy the finest writing and acting seen in the history of television.  The best part is even though the writing is high brow, it's still very funny.  Season 10 also has a clever little episode that's near and dear to me called ""Roe to Perdition""  which is the sole episode I was in the audience for the filming of.

I see some titles here by Andrew Bullock who wrote a lovely review, but would like a list of all of them, please.

It would be greatly appreciated.

To anyone debating buying any or all of the Frazier series. These are truly a 'treasure' to be enjoyed, dusted off and enjoyed again throughout your life.  Comedy doesn't get any funnier or more insightful for we 'humans' than this incredible series. Highest production values, amazing writing staff and a cast of character that is as endearing as they come.  Worth every penny whether you buy new or used.

Such a delight to view commercial free and when watched in order a sheer delight to see the progressions in their lives as well as the results of their choices.  Fun and sassy story arcs as well as stand-alone episodes.  I would rate this as one of the absolute must-have series for anyone who has enjoyed an episode of Frazier.  They will be as funny 20 and 40 years from now since they are character-driven humor.

If anyone is looking for a hilarious series who owns all of Frazier, I would recommend 3rd Rock from the Sun. Which is deliightfully zany and hilarious.

The following list is compiled based on kowing Season 9 titiles and the Final Season (11th)

Season 10 Titles by alpha  (assumed to be accurate based on year of episode listed on tv)

Daphne Does Dinner
Door Jam
Enemy at the Gate
Fathers and Sons
Lillith Needs a Favor
Roe to Perdition
Trophy Girlfriend
We Two Kings  Christmas episode

Am looking for the other 6 titles.

This would account for 9 of the 16 episodes (assuming same # of episodes as previous box sets.  I do try to catch that season's episodes when on tv until the box set is released and I've noticed some episodes are appearing on cable channels and channel 56.

Now I must vent ~ ~ I am NOT happy, however, that even though I and others have seen every episode, sometimes you tend to forget which ones will be on the new DVDs and you're surprised all over again when the DVD set finally arrives at your door. Why do some reviewers have to carry on and on about each episode and spoil it for those of us who forgot which are missing? Some of us like that tiny yet still fun element of surprise of what's coming when we haven't seen it in a while.

2937951,4,B000VDDE0Y,"The release of ""Frasier: Season 10"" is a pleasure in itself simply because it allows the ""Frasier"" fan to complete their collection. Despite being only the penultimate season of the show, its successor season 11 was released before several of its forerunners - most probably due to the hype at the time that it was to be the last ever year of ""Frasier"".
Season 10 is yet another ingenious run of episodes. It is the season in which the show-makers pick up the pace again after slightly flatter 8th and 9th years. The anticipation that washed consistently throughout seasons 1-7, charting the saga of Daphne and Niles, which finally came to a head in the season 7 finale/8 opening, left the ""Frasier"" audience satisfied to see the pair together at last; and although it was different, interesting and enjoyable to watch the couple glide into their newfound relationship, the show lost a touch of its sparkle.
The 10th season steps things up again, as ""Frasier"" heads towards the looming climax, just 2 years away. It concentrates on being funny above all else and allows itself several one-off stories that only need to last the duration of a single episode but which are brilliant in themselves: ""Enemy At The Gate"" sees Frasier stand up for his rights, when he refuses to pay the $2 fee that is incurred when he enters a parking garage only to change his mind and attempt to exit again; ""We Two Kings"", the Christmas episode, sees the Crane brothers battle it out over who should host the holidays, resulting in Martin making the decision to work on Christmas Day; ""Door Jam"" is the wonderful episode in which Niles and Frasier join a ridiculously decadent health spa, only to become obsessed with their desire to enjoy the privileges of the most exclusive members; ""Roe To Perdition"" is another ""Door Jam-esque"" encounter, with its carefree Frasier/Niles craziness (this time, they get involved in the distribution of illegally imported caviar); ""Daphne Does Dinner"" sees Daphne and Frasier's attempts to muster up an event in which Niles plans to unveil a newly acquired painting, which, unbeknown to him, Alice has drawn on; and ""Fathers And Sons"" witnesses Roz convinced that Frasier and Niles' mother's ex-colleague is actually their real father.
Season 10 has its steadier continual plots too - each equally as entertaining. It begins with Niles and Daphne finally tying the knot - three times! In order to have the wedding they want, the couple get married in secret, only to have to act out a second marriage to please Frasier and Martin (who express that they would be distraught if the pair were ever to get married without them there to see it). However, when Daphne's mother insists that her daughter be wed in a church, a third fake-wedding must be performed.
Other plots involve the slightly more serious situation in which Niles has to undergo heart surgery, and Frasier's love/hate interest of the season, Julia (played perfectly by Felicity Huffman), whose presence causes a sexual harassment case at KACL, scandal with Frasier's accountant and a blazing dispute between Frasier and Roz, culminating in Roz demanding Frasier to choose between her and Julia in the Season Finale.
And this is where Season 10 leaves us...but fortunately we have Season 11 to go to immediately, as the release of ""Frasier: Season 10"" marks the final part of the collection to be made available on DVD.
Proving to be a nice run-up to the forthcoming end of ""Frasier"", the 10th season combines, as usual, witty writing with superb acting. It brings along new characters, provoking enjoyable stories, whilst developing the established regulars even further than its previous 9 years has done already. Daphne and Niles' relationship evolves even more, both endearingly and humorously, whilst we witness more of Frasier's unvarying closeness to his brother, and the difficulty he faces when a contemptible lover clashes with his best friend. Ever-constant is the comedy, provided largely by classic ""Frasier"" ingredients - misunderstanding, the continuous Frasier/Niles battle to be elite, and the exaggeration of the characters' already extravagant and embellished personalities...including the ever-winning Eddie the dog.
Despite not being the final season, season 10 is an enchanting finishing piece of the ""Frasier"" puzzle, flawlessly embodying the nature of an established, intelligent and successful sitcom in its golden years.",1188432000,75,4426,5.106206896551724
