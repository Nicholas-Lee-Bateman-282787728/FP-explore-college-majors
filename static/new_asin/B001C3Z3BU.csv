Shirley MacLain, Piper Laurie and Sandra Bullock turn in excellent performances in supporting roles as well in this poignant and beautifully crafted film. It's perfectly paced, funny, thought provoking, frightfully true and so heartbreaking it should have swept the Oscars in 1993 in IMHO!

There is not one false note in it's 2 hour running length and the music score by Michael Convertino is one of the best I've ever heard. I urge everyone to search for this gem of a movie (on VHS) and the out of print soundtrack! This is pure lightning in a bottle and I have never seen any of these actors turn in a better performance!

The film is full of beautifully understated scenes, one where Duvall's character learns his waitress friend is moving away and the subtle look and expressions used by Duvall will just rip your heart out! Both actors have so many good scenes, that you just don't want the movie to end! Not only the main actors, but there isn't a bad performance in the entire film. Harris and Duvall's antics will have you laughing one minute and reaching for the tissue box the next!

I can not recommend this film enough! It's that great and it fit's easily into my top 10 favorite films of all time! Search for it, buy it and be prepared to see and hear how movies are supposed to be made! Absolutely fantastic and it gets better each time I watch it as I discover something new with each viewing. I give it my absolute highest rating!

I had to find the VHS used and burn it to DVD, but I can only hope that this will make it to DVD some day soon. If this came out on Blu Ray I would buy a Blu Ray Player immediately! Am I making myself clear my buddies??? It's an awesome film with no action, no gimmicks or Hollywood flair, just great actors, playing regular people, doing regular things......sometimes life is interesting enough, without all the hoopla!

****DVD UPDATE****
WARNER ARCHIVES HAS RELEASED A NO FRILLS DVD OF THIS FILM FOR $19.99, BUT THEY DO RUN SALES AS LOW AS $12.00. THE TRANSFER LOOKS VERY GOOD AND CERTAINLY A UPGRADE FROM VHS.

Give us a break and do the descent thing. No disrespects  to the current distributor but I feel more confidant in buying the movie without a Swedish title - it's just not the same. If anyone has seen this version and can give an honest opinion, particularly if all the dialogue is in English as originally released please post a review. Much appreciated.

PS - August 12th - I've just watched, at last, this movie on DVD released by Warner Brothers Australia. For some reason Warner's have released this superb movie throughout Australia & New Zealand and I can tell you it looks great on a 42"" wide-screen TV. I've bought my copy 'downunder' so no doubt it will be available via Amazon in due course - with an English title! The movie is just as I remember it, better, because I now have it in DVD format and can watch it again and again.",1217203200,5,1010,4.367021276595745
