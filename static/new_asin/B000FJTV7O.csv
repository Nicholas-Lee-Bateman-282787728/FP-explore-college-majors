8123756,5,B000FJTV7O,"Thank you for this video. Although this isn't Master at Arms Jim Webb's previous knife fighting series from PANTHER PRODUCTIONS. It's still very informative. You learn not only how to knife fight, but to defend against the knife! And why you should never knife fight in the first place!!!!",1449792000,,289,4.918367346938775
8123757,3,B000FJTV7O,"This video is  NOT a ""Learn how to knife fight"" video. It's more of an ""Extras"" for people who have already studied knife in their own martial art. There are very few techniques taught here. The only time he shows a technique is when he's trying to prove a point about something, and never says this is the way you should do something. He always says ""Some people like to do <this>, and that's O.K., but other people like to do <this>"". Mostly it's a lot of prep talk for people about to fight for real. ""Remember, there is going to be a lot of blood. Blood is slippery. Knives move fast and furious, so don't train with just one attack. The knife is going to be going INTO something when you Thrust, so remember you have to PULL, to get it out again. Train with some force on the knife so you use force for real (you'll most likely be cutting through clothing)."" It's filled with Info like this, but not the A,B,C's you were probably expecting from a knife DVD.

James Webb may be awesome at what he does, but the DVD screams Cheese. His long, burned-out, 80's-Rocker hair, his constant caressing and gazing fondly at the knife, and the fire effect dissolves, are a bit much.
He never says ""Um"", or ever gets stuck mid sentence, so he comes off as knowing his stuff, but it could have been more professionally done.

If you get this DVD, get it as an addition to you library, not as your key to learning knife.",1251244800,5,1411,4.316981132075472
8123758,1,B000FJTV7O,I was very disappointed with the video especially after I had read all the 5 and 4 star reviews.  I felt this DVD was not very well put together and the instructor jump around a ton in this movie.  It seemed more for students of his who have been taught under him for quite sometime.  I would not recommend buying this DVD!,1244592000,4,323,4.17741935483871
8123759,4,B000FJTV7O,"James Webb's street blood Knife fighting for self Defense. Is a worthwhile dvd. I did learn from it. I have ordered James webb's material before. I didn't agree with everything, especially the unarmed against the knife had some parts I didn,t agree with. But overall I was pleased.",1238544000,4,281,4.875
8123760,5,B000FJTV7O,"I have purchased several other DVD's covering this topic, and James Webb's is the only one who conveys the information in a very simple, practical down to earth way. He comes across as an easy going surfer dude from California kind of guy, that you would love to just hang out with, yet obviously has a very long and varied self defense back ground, and knows what he is talking about. According to statements made during the DVD, he has not only been involved in knife encounters, which he says he has the scars to prove, but has served in the military, and trains the military. Too many so called knife experts have never seen real fight time, only pretend practice, so some (a lot) of their fancy, frilly moves are just that, things that you would never do in a real life situation. James Webb shoots them all down, and shows you why they won't work, and practical methods that will work. But the thing I enjoyed hearing the most, as he comments to it throughout the DVD, is first off, try not to get into a situation where you would need to use a knife, and to try to evade, distract and make a get away if at all possible. He also covers all degrees of force, from perhaps only trying to do just enough to remove you from the situation, to final lethal force. Knife fight wounds are very, very nasty brutal things; just look them up on the internet. This is something you do not want to happen to you, unless there is no choice given you. Put more practice and effort into being aware of your surroundings, and not getting yourself in the situation in the first place. I rate this video as a must see, it could save your life, or the lives of your loved ones. A+. Thank you James !",1205193600,6,1686,4.30503144654088
8123761,4,B000FJTV7O,"This DVD is pretty good. It does a good job in describing, as an overview, the basic knife fighting skills. Grip, posture,footwork.
It is quite amusing, and Master Webb offers some real life examples, as well as his experience as instructor in the Iranian forces.
What I felt it was missing was more on the actual knife strikes: slashes and thrusts. The defensive positions, techniques were explained with more details,following the 5 zones of attack system. The offensive part was a bit ignored since only some ideas of attack are given.
Overall a good work, but needs to be complemented with more offensive oriented works.",1200355200,7,624,4.9523809523809526
8123762,5,B000FJTV7O,"I have to say MR. Webb's Dvd was a great teaching dvd on knife fighting . He really goes into great details on many great styles of fighting. He also mentions that you will most likely get cut during a knife fight. All the other dvd never say that and never prepare you on what to do about it.
Mr. Webb covers almost all aspects of knife fighting in a real and easy way for anyone to learn. I highly suggest everyone who wants to learn about knife fighting get this DVD.",1182211200,8,470,4.119565217391305
