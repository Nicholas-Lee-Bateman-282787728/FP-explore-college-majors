8195732,3,B000QD0SRG,"I rented this through streaming it via vimeo.com. for 2 dollars, and even that I felt somewhat cheated.. like another reviewer said, it's only 30 mins long.. for a so called documentary, I just feel that with a little more time, we could have learned more etc.. overall what was presented was ok, however, I feel they needed to expand on several things.  definitely isn't worth buying the dvd, streaming it for 2$ is really all it's worth.  Short informative piece but not a ""movie"" or real documentary.. more like a dateline special etc.",1509235200,,538,4.712765957446808

This is not the best material available.",1415145600,,263,4.387755102040816
