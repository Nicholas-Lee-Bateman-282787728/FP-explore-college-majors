8344410,4,B001ULHPR4,"Not bad Mexican-made, Spanish-language (no dubbing or sub-titles) mid 60's horror film.  The story is in the grand tradition of Mystery of the Wax Museum and House of Wax.  Women, both floozies and good girls, are being abducted by a creep with a horrifying mask and converted into wax figures.  Watching the film it's no secret who the culprit is.  Has at times great spooky atmosphere.  The Coleccion Mexico DVD is excellent quality.  Recommended for Mexican horror movie fans.",1455321600,2,479,5.0
8344411,5,B001ULHPR4,"Museo del Horror - Museum of Horror draws heavily from the all time classic Mr. Vincent Price's ""HOUSE OF WAX"" of the demented killer turning his victims into wax figures at an old abandoned creepy museum. Yet this 1963's black & white Mexican classic horror film manages to make the story its own specially under the masterful direction of Mr. Rafael Baledon (my very favorite directed by Mr. Baledon ""HASTA EL VIENTO TIENE MIEDO"" - ""EVEN THE WIND IS AFRAID"" EXCELLENT GHOST STORY!!!!!) Also a great cast of popular & talented actors during Mexico's second Golden Age of Cinema: Mr. Julio Aleman, Mr. Joaquin Cordero, Ms. Patricia Conde, Ms. Olivia Michele and in a small role Ms. Sonia Infante. The black & white cinematography & use of fog & shadows lend to the atmosphere of dread & horror. A nightmarish sequence of the dead rising from their graves is something worth of Mr. George Romero's 1968 classic ""NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD"". GREAT ENOUGH TO WATCH ON A DARK STORMY NIGHT TO GIVE YOU GOOSEBUMPS!!!! The picture & sound transfer are clear. If movies like this one could have english subtitles they would definitely reach a wider horror fan base like me. Still the plot is easy enough to follow HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!",1425340800,2,1227,4.7924528301886795
8344412,4,B001ULHPR4,"Veteran Mexican horror film director, Rafael Baledon is masterful as he helms this Mexican Gothic horror film.  This was his last horror film and he pulls out all the stops. Baledon's masterful ability to create atmosphere sets this modestly-budgeted film apart from others made in the 1960s. Baledon used actual locations and lighting to create the gothic look and save money. The villain is cloaked in shadows and his visage is ghastly.  There is a creative dream sequence and the film score is quite effective.

I have a special place for Museo del Horror and place it among my top 10 Mexican horror films.  In truth, I own about 30 such films and can truthfully rate it a very good but not great film. It is in the tradition of the 1960s Italian horror film genre and borrows heavily from American horror films of the late-1940s and early-1950s.",1387324800,5,849,4.716216216216216
