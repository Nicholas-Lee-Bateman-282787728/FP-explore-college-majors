4655438,4,B005D0RDRU,"Take note that the DVD jacket of this movie is very misleading in terms of the romantic aspect. The male characters on the box do not play the roles you might think they do. Regardless of the cover art, open the box and enjoy your time with this sweet holiday chick flick. Christmas has very little to do with the actual plot other than the fact that the movie is set during the Christmas season. Basically this is a story about a woman whose life is upset by unexpected change. She has to learn some lessons about herself and the people in her life - new and old relationships. Along the way, romance comes into the picture, even though she didn't want it to since she's been hurt before. There are some good laughs, very sweet lines quoted, tear-jerking moments and romance! I like it overall. And, have to add, the character of Dillon was yummy! I recommend this to anyone who wants a chick flick with a happy ending that takes place during winter/Christmas. It's worth the $7.",1329004800,,980,4.4804469273743015
4655439,5,B005D0RDRU,I have been looking for this movie for years. I knew that Joanna Garcia from Reba was in it and bits and pieces of the plot but that was it. Now that they're finally releasing it on DVD I grabbed it. As with one other reviewer it didn't end the way I thought it would with her falling for the son but I saw it coming. He was obviously a jerk. And she did end up with someone who was much better for her. Merry Christmas.,1326931200,,420,3.895348837209302
4655440,5,B005D0RDRU,"This was a Christmas present for my Mom, she loves to watch Christmas movies. I haven't watched any of the movies that I've bought off Amazon yet, but she hasn't complained about the quality of them yet so all is good in the world!",1326585600,,231,4.2727272727272725
4655441,1,B005D0RDRU,"I would agree with Jan that this movie was a waste of money.  To help others I would like to point out one or two things.  The story line is mother and daughter run a bridal shop. The mother goes to Paris for ONE WEEK on business.  She comes back with a fiance.  The daughter is not pleased, she has only cooked dinner for two.  Herself and her mother.
 After dinner the daughter is loading the dishwasher and 'Jack' the fiance has gone up to the bedroom.  Mother says to daughter,""what is wrong?""  daughter says you don't even know what his faults are.  Mother says I know he snores, daughter says you'vw slept with him? Mother says more than once, daughter says okay that's more than I need to know.
I will tell you now that I am a Christian and I don't believe in fornication. That said I don't think even today's modern 56 year old women would normally jump into bed with a man in a strange country after only knowing him for a week?????????  Or should we say less than a week.!!!!!!!
They are really too mushy and yucky altogether.  They are always kissing at the table and forgetting everybody else.
I just wouldn't consider it a romantic movie and there was nothing funny either. Yes I have a very good sense of humour.
I good Christmas movie and one with a little humour is ""A Christmas Romance"" starring Olivia Newton-John.",1325980800,56,1332,4.418032786885246
4655442,4,B005D0RDRU,"I like holiday movies and I thought this one would be funny and a love story...  I was expecting the recalcitrant daughter who disapproves of her mother's holiday marriage to fall in love with her partner in crime to attempt to break them up, the fiance's son...  but that is not how it ends.  The fiance's son remains a negative character and the daughter falls in love with someone else.

It was still a good movie and ends well...  I would have liked to see the son turn his attitude around...  oh well...",1325376000,,508,4.408602150537634
4655443,5,B005D0RDRU,"I really enjoyed this movie, I think it's one of the best Christmas movies that I have watched on Lifetime channel. The writing is funny, the acting is superb (for the most part) and the Christmas backgrond is charming.  Also, I have to agree with one of the other reviewers, the actress Joanna Garcia that plays the main characher is under rated, she does a fabulous job.
