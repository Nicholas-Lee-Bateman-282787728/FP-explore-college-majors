305478,5,6301024435,"One thing you've got to hand to Gerry and Sylvia Anderson. Not only were they on the forefront in terms of creating excellent science fiction with wonderous costumes, sets, and the like, they also create science fiction with an excellent, if not bizarre twist to it. Much like 2001 and Planet Of The Apes. They would go on later to create Space:1999(another science fiction classic).
I first saw Journey To the Far Side Of The Sun at my grandmother's on a Saturday afternoon, watching it on the Saturday afternoon movies portion on one of the local television stations, and I must say that I was totally blown away by its plot twist. A mirror-Earth on the far side of the sun. And the explosive ending where astronaut and U.S. Air Force Colonel Glenn Ross(played by the great Roy Thinnes)tries to make an emergency landing in his spacecraft. The film was definately a quantum leap in science fiction. Especially with a plot twist that would have made a good Twilight Zone episode. Everything about this movie was great. From the plot to subplot, to the acting, etc. It is truly a cult classic among fans, especially those of the Andersons.
Roy Thinnes, as always, does an excellent job with the material he is given. From an astronaut that has marital problems, to being in a weird and bizarre situation, he does an excellent job of playing someone who is in the most strangest of circumstances. The other actors also do an excellent job as well. The soundtrack by the late Barry Gray, very powerful and moving. Especially in the scene where Thinnes is in front of a mirror in the space center administrator's office, putting the pieces of the puzzle together.
If you enjoy science fiction with a twist, be sure to check out this film. Man has gone to the moon. Now take another extraordinary journey!",971136000,98,1801,4.7025316455696204
305479,3,6301024435,"The plot of JOURNEY TO THE FAR SIDE OF THE SUN could have been the subject  of a good sci-fi novelette but is too weak for a 100 minutes movie. The  idea is the following : there is a symmetric earth behind the sun. So why  not go there and see what's on this planet.
Actors are very serious, the  clothes very 1970 in an action set at the beginning of the 21st century I  presume. But what is truly a surprise in this movie is the quality of the  special effects ; in my opinion, they are the best I have seen, except for  2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY of course, in a movie of the sixties. You have to see  the final explosion to understand what I mean.
Special features reduced  to the minimum : english subtitles and a scene access.

The idea of identical earths and some reversal of things is pretty weak. You would think that the space ships and the two astronauts would be antimatter on another planet, but this was not mentioned. On copycat Earth people drive on the other side of the earth, language is backwards, and clocks run backwards, plus organs are on differing sides of the body.

It isn't merely a SciFi movie.  It gave me a scientific quiz.
I first watched the movie about 40 years ago on TV.
The cause of the destruction within the story is okay, but there is a scientific contradiction.  ""What is it?""  Finding it meant to me that the scary epilogue would not occur.  The quiz is not difficult for those who has the primitive knowledge of atoms.  I find an answer, and created my own story.
It is still a fun, but there is also something different in 40 years. It challenges me with another question: ""What did he see in the mirror?""

305700,4,6301024435,"The other night I watched ""Journey to the Far Side of the Sun"" again, for about the fourth time since I first saw it on its theatrical release in 1969. Every time I watch it, I get frustrated.

Oh, the special effects are great for its time, of course. Credit Gerry Anderson, of Supercar and Supermarionation fame, for the superb models of the spacecraft, launch facility and industrial structures that really look fantastic on-screen. I don't know how the crew made scale explosions look so realistic, but they did. The film's production values and visual style are outstanding, and, indeed, possibly not matched very often even by modern CGI techniques.

My frustration comes from the fact that ""Journey to the Far Side of the Sun"" starts out with a promising story line but never really goes anywhere with it. The idea of another planet in the Solar System that shares Earth's orbit but remains perpetually hidden from view behind the sun is not new. Nor is the notion of a spacecraft launched from Earth to visit that ""doppelganger"" planet. For some reason, though, this movie does not seem to explore those plot elements in depth, with consistency or in a coherent way.

I won't reveal any spoilers here, but I'll just say that I lost track of who was doing what to whom about halfway through--and that's something you need to know to understand the ending. If the action or dialogue makes that clear, then I've missed it despite watching it multiple times. Also--and this may be a bit of a spoiler--I was disappointed that the movie never takes full advantage of the ""eye camera"" plot element that we see in the first few minutes. Like much of the rest of the movie, it's a neat idea that doesn't really go anywhere.

So my overall rating for ""Journey to the Far Side of the Sun"" is a solid four stars. Obviously I like it well enough that I re-watch it every few years. But the frustration I experience every time I do so keeps it equally solidly out of the ""I love it"" category.",1394150400,2,1986,4.601694915254237

305702,3,6301024435,"Robert Parrish's JOURNEY TO THE FAR SIDE OF THE SUN (aka Doppelgnger) (1969) looks and feels like a '60s 007 picture, especially when Herbert Lom removes an eyeball that's been converted to a mini-spy camera.

Clearly, the UK release of this sci-fier showed an unconcern for plot spoilers, as anyone who knows or looks up the meaning of 'doppelgnger' has the plot twist nailed.

They crash land home far too soon after launch and only pilot Col. Glenn Ross (Roy Thinnes) survives.

305736,3,6301024435,"This movie was originally called Doppelgnger in it's original British release (American distributors wanted the title changed thinking we wouldn't understand the title reference). It it the first live action project Gerry and Sylvia Anderson (creators of the Thunderbirds) had done, and it paved the way for more of these projects with shows like U.F.O. and Space: 1999. Journey to the Far Side of the Sun is mostly a reflective kind of film geared more toward showing the technical side of space travel in a muted dramatic way. While the premise is pretty interesting the film ultimately doesn't do anything with the revelations they created. And I mean that literally.

Journey to the Far Side of the Sun is set in the year 2069, and we are already sending manned missions to Mars and have an international space agency. An unmanned sun probe reveals that there is another planet just opposite ours on the other side of the sun, and plans are made to send a manned mission to it. This film is pretty much divided into two parts. The first half is all about the process of putting together a manned space mission. There is a little espionage, a little astronaut training, a little political maneuvering, and a fair amount of technical jargon to fill out this segment of the movie. I can tell this film was capitalizing on the Apollo moon mission that happened soon after production was finished. Much of the preparations and rocket launch segments seem to come straight from details from NASA. It's all interesting to see and the level of detail put out on the preparations for space flight is impressive, even if modern day hindsight does notice some flaws.

The second half of the film gets a little more trippy and involves landing on the newly discovered planet. It is revealed that the planet is an exact copy of Earth, but with many things reversed like images, writing, placement of objects and controls. They even make a point to mention driving on the other side of the road. While this does go more into Twilight Zone territory the way it is handled feels much more like the scientific and philosophical analysis made on films like Escape from the Planet of the Apes. A lot of potential was to be had with this little plot twist, but unfortunately the film flops from there.

Essentially after all this new stuff is revealed and the opportunity to explore it come up the movie abruptly ends in a spectacularly hail of explosions and fire killing off all witnesses to the plot twist aside from the director overseeing the mission, who is given a brief scene where he goes mad and dies too. What the hell happened here? There was so much potential to follow up on. The astronauts could have returned to Earth and there could have been more of that scientific speculation and thought. They could have met their mirror image selves, which could have made for even more interesting discussion. Heck there was a whole mess of ideas that could have been explored, but instead the whole experience is wiped under the table as if it never happened. What a way to ruin such and eclectic premise.

Aside from the ending that ruins the movie from a story perspective there is a lot for sci-fi fans to enjoy on this film. The tech is interesting and fun to see, even if you have to gloss over some stuff like the idea that in 2069 they are still using reel to reel tape for data storage. Special effects are on the higher end of a Gerry Anderson production with some impressive model work. The model wirework seems fine most of the time until you start messing with atmospheric flight. Then the limitations show. There are a couple segments that seem to try and replicate to a lesser extent the psychedelic worm hole scene from 2001: A Space Odyssey, but it's an obvious ploy to just have something in front of you to represent the passage of time. It did feel out of place. The music is classic Century 21 production with a bit of elements that sound like they come from Thunderbirds and the yet to be produced Space: 1999. Acting is 60's TV acting. Subtly over the top with lots of understated emotion elsewhere.

The DVD is pretty much a bare bones affair. The video and audio are a bit better than the Image Entertainment release, but not by much. The audio is dubbed Dolby 2.0 mono (which makes the two channel in 2.0 rather pointless) and is very clean with no distortion. There are no extras, which is a shame because this film has an interesting history what with the conflicts between director Robert Parrish and the Andersons, potential deleted scenes, and production stills that must be out there somewhere. This bare bones release only has language options (English and French).

Journey to the Far Side of the Sun is a thinking man's science fiction so if you are more visceral and want more action or drama you may just want to pass.

305741,4,6301024435,"I like Gerry Anderson.  I liked Thunderbirds.  I like his beautiful models, his expansive animations, and truly 60's era design motifs.  The man was a genius in his own way.  Journey to the Far Side of the Sun is a thinking man's movie.  Lots of dialogue, except when there isn't any.  Then we are treated to long beauty shots of his models and designs that are supposed to build dramatic tension.  I don't think full-length features are really Gerry Anderson's forte.  His hour-long episodes of Thunderbirds, Space Precinct, UFO, and Space: 1999 all work fine.  But his feature-length movies feel like hour-long episodes stretched out to 2.  You have long periods of dialogue, followed by long shots of models and dioramas, and occasional scene-setting shots that go on forever.  Journey could have been a 60 minute TV special and it would have been twice as good.  That having been said, the man was very good at what he did.  The models, as I've said, were excellent, the dioramas and sets were well done, and the special effects were movie-quality - while not as exciting as Star Wars, they were certainly better done.  I will happily add Journey to my Gerry Anderson collection.  If you are a Gerry Anderson fan, then this movie is a must-have.  If you are an old, campy, sci-fi fan, then you will enjoy this flick.

305775,3,6301024435,"I rather liked this old science fiction movie (made in 1969) about the discovery of a completely new planet in our solar system and the attempt to send a manned mission to its surface. Although technologically this film is very aged, it has its charm and the costumes, vehicles and the general visual aspect certainly reminded me (a little) of Gerry Anderson's later series, ""UFO"" and ""Space 1999"".

I found extremely interesting and also quite amusing the idea that in the XXI century European Space Agency (based in Portugal!) is the leader in the space exploration, with NASA being its junior partner - well, we all know how that turned out... The vision of the XXI century Europe is also quite a sight. We learn for example that in towns there will be silent but powerful electric cars, but farmers will still use chariots tracted by half starved donkeys...)))

I will not say much about the plot, but it is rather clever, with the exception of the last five minutes, which I found rather unsatisfying. The ending can have however its charm, if you like the atmosphere of those old ""Twilight Zone"" stories, which insisted on mystery rather than any definite conclusion. The unsettling atmosphere of mystery is quite typical of those movies from 60s and it is one of the stronger points of this film.

Roy Thinnes is the main star in this film and I found his performance excellent. There are also two very beautiful women, Lynn Loring and Loni von Friedl, who are a very pleasant presence on the screen. Which makes things even more interesting, Lynn Loring who plays Thinnes's unhappy wife, was also in this time Mrs Roy Thinnes in the real life...

However it was Loni von Friedl who made the greatest impression on me, although the kindness, warmth and generosity she seems to radiate with, are in contradiction with the nature of job her character is supposed to do. She plays here the role of chief of Security Service for ESA, an organism autorised to make extrajudicial killings in case of a security breach...

All that being said, I believe that for people who are not too much into science-fiction this film can seem rather too aged and even a little bit boring. I liked it, but I would not pick it to see during an evening with my friends (not all of them are geeks).

First Impressions:

The amazing model work is the first thing that strikes the viewer.  This movie was in some ways an inspiration for Gerry's later Space:1999 with excellent rocket and space sets.  The film starts with an interesting James Bond/spy thriller with some interesting ocular spy equipment and some politicial intrigue -- is the space program worth the expense?  (Sounds familiar, but I digress).

Roy Thinnes (later starring in another great sci fi show, The Invaders&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Invaders-Seasons-1-2/dp/B001HUHBBS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Invaders - Seasons 1 - 2</a>), is the plucky American astronaut along with the astrophysicist John Kaine (played by Ian Hendry -- acting was not too bad -- the guy gets pretty beat up and is not fully developed in this film) are exploring the possibility of a new planet on the other side of the Sun!

Landing on a Counter-Earth (after much cool music and psychedelic lava lamps -- pass the Bogart, dude!) our good corporal believes things are not as they seem -- his wife is still a grouch, the woman security girl still has a crush on him, but the poor guy can't read a newspaper -- it's backwards!

The plot gets really thin after this and the ending is rushed.  But hey, it's science fiction!

See this film for a decent tale of ""earth on the other side"" kind of story.  This idea has been done before (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Land-of-the-Giants-The-Full-Series-The-Giant-Collection/dp/B000P5FH2Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Land of the Giants: The Full Series (The Giant Collection)</a>;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Another-Earth/dp/B0055C6YQM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Another Earth</a>) but not with such cheesy finesse!",1314316800,,2498,7.430508474576271

Normally, I don't mind slow pacing, but the characters aren't all that interesting, and the plot twist is all but wasted. I mean, he gets to the mirror earth, finds out what happened, and then dies. The end! I can't imagine what Planet of the Apes would have been like if it had played out similarly and you only saw about 15 minutes of the new world before the main character died and the movie ended.

Having the twist be a mirrored, yet identical, world is clever, because all that is required is to flip the film horizontally and voila! you're on the mirror Earth! No extra props or actors required.

Clearly, the UK release of this sci-fier showed an unconcern for plot spoilers, as anyone who knows or looks up the meaning of 'doppelgnger' has the plot twist nailed. Not that this one's such a mystery, for the first time we see an instrument panel with all the words spelled backwards, or ink pens in a right breast pocket or men's shirts that button from the left, us 'with-it' movie-goers pretty much know what the deal is here. And so we wait for the folks on-screen to figure it all out, too.

To synopsize, when a planet is discovered orbiting the sun on the same path of and directly opposite Earth, two men are sent into space to investigate. They crash land home far too soon after launch and only pilot Col. Glenn Ross (Roy Thinnes) survives. Denying that he aborted the flight and turned around, Ross soon notices that everything is backwards: writing, car steering wheels, the interior of his own home. While Ross ponders this conundrum and his examiners wonder why the colonel's heart is on the wrong side of his chest, we yawn, then get up and go buy a box of Milk Duds and another soda.

It's fun seeing neat antique special effects in this Technicolor fantasy adventure and if you've nothing more pressing to do you'll probably watch it to the very end. Not 'required viewing' by any means, but still a decent movie.

Alright, fans of the worlds of Gerry Anderson, like me, are used to such physical impossibilities and scientific lapses.  However, even if you accept the conventions of this ""world"", you are still left with a hugely annoying plot complication - - while the astronauts are in a pre-programmed state of suspended animation during most of their ""journey"", in the course of post-landing interrogation, one of them is accused of having turned the ship around mid-mission.

305832,3,6301024435,"This movie was released on 10/1969, but started filming during 1968.  It generated a great number of the miniatures and props that would be used just months later in Gerry Anderson's UFO TV series (which began production in 04/1969). Additionally, a few of the actors joined that production. Thus, it's easy to make comparisons... but I think that is unfair, because this is a movie--not a series episode. A different kind of focus and treatment is done. In a general way, it is a better work than the UFO TV series because of that. UFO had a couple of key problems, mostly with the script dialog, mostly flat acting, and very abrupt endings.

The most glaring problem with ""Doppelganger"" is the idea of a mirror version of the Earth, in the exact opposite orbit. It is physically impossible as there is no gravitational lock to prevent 'drift'--one planet catching up to the other. Anybody with just a little knowledge of astrophysics would know this. Even if we accept this preposterous idea, certainly we could send a more advanced communication probe so that we might communicate with them? This idea isn't even explored... even if they dreamed up some kind of ""solar blockage"" issue preventing it from working, there's no reason why two probes could be sent out to solve that problem. Since it is an ""opposite"" world, they'd send the probes in opposite directions, thus their paths would never cross (as what happened to the astronauts). This is of course ignoring the fact that speech is exempt from being spoken in reverse... obviously this would be much harder to enact. Anyway, if you can overlook these glaring faults, the movie is enjoyable.

**SPOILER ALERT**

""Doppelganger"" did have a fairly abrupt ending that left me unsatisfied. From a logical standpoint, it was highly flawed. Even if the polarity of electrical systems was reversed and ""shorted out"" radio communications (but not the rest of the systems--curious enough, as the vehicle could still maneuver), any vehicle capable of remote control would have a physical cut-off switch for full manual control. Even if we assume that they goofed and it is fully electrically driven and that control unit is fried, the fact is that remote control requires communications to receive and process signals. No doubt the radio communications would leverage the same system, so he should still be able to communicate with ground based control. Then... if they find they can't communicate and the re-entry vehicle is not responding properly to controls (it is coming in at too steep an angle and speed), why continue the forced remote control? Even still, they have radar imaging and can see how fast the vehicle is coming in... the rocket tower shield should have been closed as a measure of precaution. But no, these glaring faults are left to force a particular ending... the spacecraft crashes and destroys the entire EUROSEC installation.

If I had the chance to author the ending, it would go like this: Ross is able to communicate enough information to EUROSEC about the 'complete reversal' he witnesses at the Phoenix, so the suspicion is confirmed. But then, he docks and doesn't realize the danger of reversed polarity--his communication system is then shorted out. Ross decides to return to Earth and makes his descent. He repeats requests for telemetry for a proper trajectory, but he gets no response. He continues on a previous path he assumes will be correct. As he comes within range, the strength of the tracking station signal manages to get through and automatically takes computer control of his vehicle. Because of the previous damage, it doesn't function properly... Ross has only moments to disengage and go to full manual, which he does--but it's too late. The vehicle is out of control and crashes into a fiery mess, taking Ross with it. EUROSEC survives, but Webb remains disturbed about the whole incident. There is a meeting to discuss another mission, but it is scrubbed due to insufficient funds. Webb gazes at photographs of the solar system, frustrated that he'll never learn anything more about the ""parallel"" Earth. At least with an ending like this, we're left being able to see the characters consider what they've learned but remain unable to do anything about it. The mystery will prevail.

**END SPOILER**

This story did have a lot of potential and some of it was handled well for its time.  Despite the obvious signs of miniature models and sets, the production values are excellent (""Doppelganger"" was nominated for an Academy Award for special effects, unjustly losing to the movie ""Marooned"").

Character development is relatively weak, despite some excellent actors in the cast (like Roy Thinnes).  The space scenes seem desperate to emulate the production values of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", which would be an impossible task (not only budget-wise but for the talent required).

Overall, to watch it is a fun trip back in time to classic late 60's sci-fi productions.  It does hold up well in that regard.  But after watching it once, one gets the feeling that it will be placed in a box and not watched again for many years.  So, overall I'm giving this production 3 stars (***).  Worth watching for the sake of the genre, but not worth buying new (buy it used, rent it, or borrow it).

Great special effects, weightless scenes, that cool actor from The Invaders, pretty girls in skimpy dresses, neato cars, and, best of all, big juicy explosions. What's not there for a kid to love?

I'm not a kid anymore, and this movie is showing it's age, badly. The plot reads like a sci-fi short story from the period - long on ideas, but sketchy on any ""deep"" thoughts on the premise. The characters are paper thin, and there are some puzzling interpersonal developments that largely appear to have developed off-screen. The awesome effects are reduced to some pretty shakey model-work.

The movie was produced by the same people responsible for all those marionette series - Supercar, Thunderbirds, Fireball XL5, etc. There are FX sequences in this movie that would not have been out of place in a Thunderbirds episode. (For example, when the American astronaut and his wife [played by Roy Thinnes and his then wife Lynn Loring] land, we are treated to a lengthy sequence showing how the plane comes apart into a separate vehicle that conveys the passengers to the arrival gate, exactly like a Thunderbird's vehicle transformation sequence.)

Like 2001, this movie has a couple of ""psychedelic"" sequences, and long scenes showing off weightlessness effects, and so on. The movie has some big ambitions, betrayed largely by the british tendency towards cheapness of prop-construction - the old gaffer-tape, dryer hose, and tin-foil approach to props as seen in other british sci-fi shows like the old Dr. Who series. It's not quite that bad, but when compared to 2001, this movie really does come across as a ""second best"" effort. There is also a set in the film (the interrogation room) that is recycled right out of the ""Prisoner"" series.

More time is spent on procedural sequences in the film than they warrant, and very little time is spent on actual character development, to the movie's detriment. I wonder if a lot of the ""good"" stuff got left on the cutting room floor, in favor of the longer, but ultimately information-free procedural sequences. We'll never know. One troubling scene devolves into domestic violence in a way that is sure to alienate some audience members from the ""hero"" of the story. An odd choice to be sure.

Overall the DVD presentation is only adequate - there are no special features to speak of, the video is a bit noisy with badly chosen black levels (there are a couple of dreadful space FX shots that could have had their bad matting fixed by a black level adjustment).

I like this movie because of my fond memories of watching it as a child, but it really doesn't hold up all that well these days. It's a bit of fun to watch, but I can't recommend it to new viewers.",1236470400,5,2878,4.723107569721115
305834,3,6301024435,"In a nutshell, JOURNEY TO THE FAR SIDE OF THE SUN concerns a team of astronauts scheduled to take a rocket trip to a newly discovered planet, located on the opposite side of the sun, and in the same orbit is the planet earth. We see preparations for the flight, with excellent footage of typical training routines for the astronauts. Some of the characters are not particularly likeable. The head of the space agency is gruff, unpleasant to look at, and his voice his harsh and grating. The wife of one of the astronauts is a beauty, but she is mean to her husband, and she provokes fights.

Eventually the rocket takes off. The flight contains a short psychedelic sequence, which is pleasant enough, and very similar to light shows common at rock'n'roll shows during the late 1960s, for example, as found at the Fillmore Auditoreum in San Francisco.

The crew members decide to land, but for some reason, the shuttle rocket crash lands in a rocky desert. They are picked up, and brought to civilization where, it turns out, the people and characters are exactly the same as at earth--the gruff head of the space agency, the mean-spirited wife, and others. But one thing is different, all the writing is reversed, and clock faces are reversed. An astronaut who was killed in the crash landing was found to have his organs reversed in his body (reversed compared to what is normal for people on the twin planet). Roy Thinnes (the main astronaut) is shown at his home (actually his duplicate home on the twin planet). At this point, the movie depicts that he is a hot-head, as he smashes things when he discovers that writing on a perfume bottle is reversed.

Much time is spent in unpleasant interrogations, where Roy Thinnes is accused of aborting the mission after only 3 weeks, and returning to the planet. Roy Thinnes eventually develops the theory of the two twin planets, and convinces the head of the space agency of his theory. Roy Thinnes is sent up in a shuttle (of similar design to the one built on planet earth). But when it tries to dock with the mother ship orbitting the twin planet, there is an electronic failure.

Roy Thinnes returns back to the twin planet where he is killed when his shuttle rocket crashes. From this point on, the movie draws to a rather pointless ending. With the crash landing, the entire rocket launching facility is blown up. Then, the time frame quick-forwards, and we see the head of the agency in a nursing home. He rolls his wheelchair into a mirror and kills himself. To repeat, this ending seems arbitrary. It is no wonder that this movie did poorly at the box office. The characters are unpleasant, especially that of the head of the space agency. Moreover, this movie came out one year after 2001 SPACE ODYSSEY. 2001 SPACE ODYSSEY set the standard for special effects. But JOURNEY TO THE FAR SIDE OF THE SUN has special effects more like those of a movie from over 10 years earlier (THIS ISLAND EARTH from 1955). THREE STARS.",1234656000,,2975,4.650190114068441

Memory is a tricky thing, sometimes. The film wasn't nearly as good as I remembered it. Gerry Anderson is the same guy who made the British ""puppet"" sci-fi, such as Thunderbirds. The sets and model spaceships have the same toy-like look. Video quality is pretty good, but for sci-fi buffs, it's about cool special effects and believable production standards.

305836,2,6301024435,"I was incredibly disappointed in this movie.

I can vaguely recall seeing the trailer at the theater back in the late sixties as a teen and being intrigued, but never actually getting to see the film. Therefore, it was with a great deal of anticipation that (nearly forty years later) I finally sat down to watch.

BORING!

There is absolutely no story here whatsoever.

 SPOILERS: A heretofore unknown planet is accidentally discovered in earth's orbit but the sun is always between us and this planet. Now anyone with even the most rudimentary understanding of astrophysics would realize this was impossible, but it's just a movie - suspend disbelief and keep watching (same as Space 1999 - the Moon breaking away from Earth orbit and traveling apparently past the speed of light into space? Well - OK I can turn off brain for a good yarn).
Unfortunately... NOTHING HAPPENS... The movie is an hour and 42 minutes long and we spend at least 70% of that time watching painstakingly slow scenes of Gerry Anderson's vision of futuristic preparation for space travel. Yes that's right - preparation. Now admittedly, were I not jaded by CGI and was watching this in 1969 on the big screen, I would be properly impressed. But this is billed as a drama - not a documentary. My remote-control finger began to cramp from fast-forwarding thru mind-numbing minutes long scenes of technicians flipping switches and saying ""Space Mission Control-like"" dialogue like ""Fuel? Check. Blue Team reporting all systems Go"" etc etc... I just kept praying for something, anything really, to happen. Oh finally about 3/4ths of the way thru the movie - Astronauts Thinnes and Hendry reach the hidden planet. And of course it is a mirror image of our Earth (It looks like Anderson reversed the shots once we switch to this doppelganger planet). The reversed writing is evident in some of the first on-planet scenes - patches and machine labels are backwards - and the ""surprise twist"" is immediately evident to those still awake. But that's it. Mirror Image Hidden Planet In Solar Synchronized Orbit. Ok, so.... oops massive explosions - end of movie.

It was if they came up with what they thought was a really keen idea and then made a movie about the keen idea with contemporarily awesome special effects and sets, but figured movie-goers would be so wowed that they wouldn't notice that there was no actual plot - the whole shebang was just an excuse to build all these ultra-clean sets prevalent in the 60's visual science fiction.

I give this 2 Stars in homage to Anderson's model work and attention to visual detail. If I was going on story alone, it would be a 1 Star.

If you want a thinking person's Science Fiction movie - look elsewhere...",1231632000,13,2728,4.814102564102564

It's a wild idea that is well-executed, and a worthy relative in the family of films that include: ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Countdown"" (both released in 1968), that involve travel beyond Earth.  See it.

The only downside is that there are no extras on the DVD.  This is not the first DVD release, which went out-of-print a few years ago.  Imagine my joy when this gem re-appeared.  It would have been cool to have something else to view about the film.",1229644800,,633,4.548672566371682
305838,3,6301024435,"Originally titled ""Doppellganger"" (meaning twin or double) in England,
this has got that special ""look"" of typical films from the mid-to-late
1960's:  namely brilliant lighting and beautiful saturated color.
The miniature special effects were by the puppeteers of the British TV
series ""Thunderbirds"" who also co-produced.  They may seem primitive to
today's CGI-saturated audiences but I personally loved them (I despise
CGI as well as underlit, monotone-colored films that haven't got the
guts to go ahead and commit to filming true black-and-white), but I digress.  Back to our film at hand.
The director was Robert Parrish, a fine journeyman director who I had a
brief correspondence with a few years before his death in 1995.  As an
editor, he was an Oscar-winner.  A protegee' of director John Ford,
Parrish gradually moved into directing in the early 50's thanks to
actor/producer Dick Powell, who gave Parrish his 1st job as director.
Over a 25-year career, he directed nearly all the great actors (Mitchum,
James Mason, Michael Caine, Jack Lemmon, Anthony Quinn, Gregory Peck,
Rita Hayworth, just to name a few) but he never developed a distinctive
style although his work was uniformally good.
What I remember about Robert Parrish was his great humility and generosity
of time to an emerging filmmaker and I gave him a special ""thanks"" in the
closing titles of my first feature, ""Attack From Outer Space"".
""Journey to the Far Side of the Sun"" is late in Mr. Parrish's portfolio
but is a well-done briskly-paced film, the plot of which may not surprise
anyone but is certainly worth a look for the film-goer desiring nothing
more that 100 minutes of fun escapism.",1229385600,4,1672,5.065454545454545

There's also a guest appearance by the wonderful Herbert Lom in a brief but pivotal role.

The basic idea of the film is great; an automated solar probe orbits behind the Sun for the first time, and brings back proof of the existence of an unknown planet, in exactly the same orbit as the Earth, to an astonished EUROSEC, the European space agency. The scientific and military potential of this discovery is incalculable, and the no-nonsense CEO of EUROSEC, ""Jason Webb,"" played by Patrick Wymark, browbeats the board, made up of the other European spacefaring members, into accepting the need for a manned mission. That is until he drops the cost of the project on them, Three Thousand Million Pounds Sterling; after much politicking and arm-twisting he convinces NASA to cough up a measly one billion Dollars, which forces everyone else to fall into line. This allows said ""Journey..."" to proceed, but the mission then seems to fail in the most spectacular fashion, and it is during the resulting inquiry that the real adventure begins!!!

First, the good stuff; the main actors are more than serviceable. Wymark dominates the early part of the film as the head of EUROSEC, alternating between arrogant British smugness and scenery-chewing tirades, Thinnes and Hendry, as astronaut ""Colonel Glenn Ross"" and astrophysicist ""John Kane"" respectively, do all they need to make their characters believable in the context of the film. The fantastically, almost fetishistically, detailed models and miniatures of Derek Meddings and his team are a joy to see; no terabytes of CGI here, these are real, solid, they have a sense of weight, of mass, the way they move, but they are ALWAYS ""models!"" However in spite of this they do manage to pull off a couple of wonderful scenes; there's a shot of the ship in orbit with the sun rising over the planets rim that, given the technology available at the time, is astonishingly beautiful. Then there's a crash landing on the planet and its immediate aftermath that is incredibly well done, a wonderful mix of Meddings' model work and live action on full-size sets, with some incredibly eerie and atmospheric lighting effects and music! Then there's a scene that many other reviewers disliked, the main journey to the planet itself, where Ross and Kane are put into a kind of suspended animation, and you get a very dreamlike, expressionistic version of the trip and time passing; I thought that was exceptionally well realized!

And now to the bad; the execution just doesn't live up to the premise, from the recycled, and sometimes jarringly inappropriate, musical themes, to dear old Sylvies wince inducing ""Century 21"" fashions; dear viewer, if you are of delicate disposition try not to gouge your own eyes out after seeing what they forced poor Ian Hendry to wear for the ""airport"" scene when we're introduced to Thinnes' character for the first time!!! Then there's the aluminum foil spacesuits, the sometimes shaky model work, the F.A.B. groovy, ""futuristic"" cars and run-a-bouts that were recycled into UFO, and the most ludicrous photo-developing process known to man; this is so bad it's wonderful!!! And as for the ending, oh my GOD, what WHERE they thinking?! But hey, at least there're no Moonbase babes wearing silver micro-mini's, purple wigs, and glitter eye shadow!!!

And bizarrely, in amongst all of the above there's a much darker edge that moves the film away from purely kiddy-fare into much more adult areas. There's the brutal extra-judicial execution of a spy ordered by a snarling Jason Webb, and a scene where Ross' wife viciously taunts him about his ""manhood"" and their inability to have a child, that made me wince when I watched the film again after all these years.

Well, what can I say, I've watched this twice now since it arrived, it may be cheese, but it's wonderful! Highly recommended for Anderson fans, and lovers of the kitsch and the camp everywhere!!!",1219708800,5,6466,5.512096774193548

And although the model work may look a bit cheesy--the launch sequence, especially, would give true space fans fits with the cheese factor--that is one of the movie's most endearing qualities.  The Dove, the Doppelganger landing craft, and the Eurosec facilities (in Portugal!) are, to me, better for this type of movie than the fancy CGI computer work.

While the movie itself is wonderful, and takes me back to my first time seeing it, on a TV station that showed it without commercial interruption during broadcast tests, Universal should be ashamed for the lack of extras on this.  There's no scene selection menu, no movie trailer--nothing that would add to the viewer's experience.  (Universal also committed the same blunder with another one of its classic movies, the disaster thriller ""Earthquake"".)

Some futurisms have clearly passed us by (computer punchcards?), but the earnestness carries one past such elements.

The premise is a stretch (best enjoyed with your Twilight Zone cap in place) and the acting is overwrought at times. Gerry Anderson's first move beyond marionettes often brings a marionette-like feel to its mise-en-scene - this is unquestionably a geekfest for gizmos, with a wacked concept as the centerpiece.

305868,3,6301024435,"A minor science fiction classic from 1969, ""Journey to the Far Side of the Sun"" has a nice O. Henry twist that occurs midway through the film taking it in unexpected directions. I'd suggest NOT reading the product description because it has a major spoiler (why copywriters do this is beyond me).

Universal has created a new anamorphic transfer for this DVD. It's a nice transfer that looks sharp with nice color reproduction. Audio sounds good as well although the only audio options are for English (English for the hearing impaired and French subtitles are included).

 Clearly timed to coincide with the release of the classic TV series ""The Invaders"" (also starring Thinnes), it's a pity that Universal chose NOT to add any extras. It's clear that Thinnes would probably have been willing since he just did an extensive interview for the first season of ""The Invaders"" and episode introductions for each first season episode. Also, I'm sure that there are featurettes out there that Universal could (and should) have licensed about the Andersons and their prolific work during the 60's and 70's producing TV shows and films. Unfortunately, we don't get anythng in the way of extras not even the original theatrical trailer.

Roy Thinnes plays an American astronaut Glenn Ross put in charge of an expedition of a planet in orbit around the sun on the opposite side. He an Dr. John Kane (Ian Hendry)go through the necessary training prior to their flight but, suddenly, find the time table for the flight moved forward by the director of Eurosec Jason Webb (Patrick Wymark)because he has concerns that some of the countries participating are going to pull their funds. The three week journey will require the astronauts to be in suspended animation. During the process of landing on the new world their lander crashes and when Ross awakens he finds himself back on Earth not knowing how he ended up there nor why it only took him three weeks to fly to the new world and return.

**SPOILER**

The original title overseas of the film was ""Doppleganger"" which hints at what we eventually find out about Ross' journey to the far side of the sun.

**END OF SPOILER**

The script has merit and the performances by Thinnes and Hendry are terrific although Wymark is a bit over the top he also does a solid job. THe visual effects are nicely done (although you can barely make out the wires hoisting the Phoenix as she lifts off from Earth)particularly those that take place in space. In fact, Stanley Kubrick had considered Gerry and Sylvia Anderson's (the writers/producers of the film) 21st Century Productions to do the visual effects for ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" before he elected to supervise visual effects technicians Douglas Trumbull, Con Pederson and others on the film.

The main flaw with the film is the direction by Robert Parrish (""The Twilight Zone"", ""Mississippi Blues"", ""Casino Royale"") which telegraphs too much. Perhaps some of that flaw is due to the script written by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson (who created/produced/wrote episodes of ""Thunderbirds"", ""UFO"" and ""Space: 1999""), regardless the film has held up remarkably well and is still very entertaining particularly the second half of the film when Ross returns to Earth. The pacing of the film is a bit choppy suggesting that much was cut out (for example we learn of the death of a major charactr in a dialogue scene and the reaction of all involved suggests that they already knew he had died).

Although flawed, this is an entertaining minor science fiction classic from the 60's. Thinnes gives a sterling performance and the script hints at deeper aspects of his character making him very much a flawed hero (for example his wife at one point complains that he has hit her on more than one occasion and can be violent). It makes the film richer although many of these points are glossed over they do add to the overall impact of the film.",1214352000,,3912,4.851574212893553

305870,3,6301024435,"""Journey to the Far Side of the Sun"" has such a great premise that it's a real disappointment that they makers didn't do more with it. The film actually comes to a close just when it should get going. Handled correctly it could have led to a spin off TV series!

If you are unfamiliar with the plot, let me fill you in on the good stuff. A planet is discovered on the far side of the sun, in exactly the same orbital rotation as the earth but on the opposite side, which explains why it has never been seen from earth before. A spacecraft is sent out to investigate it, with two astronauts on board. The long journey ends with them crash landing on the new planet, and what they find there is beyond their wildest expectations.

What you will see straight away when you watch this film is the trademark style of a Gerry Anderson production. Filled with miniatures models of groovy buildoings and spacecraft, it brings to mind a TV episode of Thunderbirds or Joe 90 on the big screen. This is a mixed blessing as Gerry Andersons miniatures always looked a bit like toys - very detailed and beautifully crafted toys, but when mixed with live actors appearing on full sized sets, the differences start to become noticeable. However this is science fiction from 1969 so be grateful that they are of a quality as high as this. The rest of the film looks great too, space fashion in all it's 1960's glory litters the screen, beautiful women, snappy gadgets and gaudy dcor are present in abundance. The camera work in the film is great, everything looks crisp and colourful, again in the same way the the TV puppet shows always appeared. The acting is pretty good too, from the two male leads Ian Hendry and Roy Thinnes (for the US audiences) and the supporting cast too.

I had great fun watching this but my main gripe is the huge disappointment that I experienced after the film revealed it's ""twist"". The twist itself is great but from that point onwards the film has nowhere to go, and nothing to do with it's trump card. The ending seemed ridiculous to me, because it basically puts a stop to so many intriguing ""what if's"" that could have been dreamed up, but instead they chose a really bad pay-off for all the build-up that had been so wonderfully laid down.

You should have a great time watching the first 80 minutes of this film, but the last 20 might well leave you unsatisfied. It looks so good and the pacing of the first hour is fantastic. I just wish things had been taken somewhere more exciting instead of thrown in the trash, which seem to me how the scriptwriters decided to end the story.",1207699200,2,2603,4.473684210526316

I'm leaving most of the plot for you to discover on your own, let's just say we're talking astronauts and jaw-droppingly cool vehicles -- always an Anderson trademark -- a mysterious planet and some mind-bending discoveries across the gulf of space... After Journey, Anderson continued his quest to deliver live action via TV series such as UFO -- probably one of the best cult series EVER, featuring many cast members from Journey -- and Space:1999.

If you grew up during the sixties on a diet of afternoon syndicated sci-fi matinees, you probably already know Gerry Anderson. He's nothing short of a cult legend. If you haven't discovered his live action work, you're in for a treat. The Oscar-nominated special effects in Journey to the Far Side of the Sun are simply phenomenal! Make sure you've got your seatbelts fastened!

Among cool sci-fi acting icons, star Roy Thinnes is probably one of the all time best, certainly one of the most underrated. In addition to this gem, he's appeared in the X-Files and many other fantastic films. And it's a great time to be a Roy Thinnes fan, because The Show of sixties cult shows that made Thinnes imortal --&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Invaders-The-First-Season/dp/B0012Z36EO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Invaders - The First Season</a>&nbsp;-- is also coming out on DVD on May 27th! If you've never seen that one -- you are in for something truly special. A Roy Thinnes character will go where few others dare to and look trouble right in the eye. In sci-fi from this era, he was the definition of cool.

Sure, it's fashionable and fun to poke a little fun at sci-fi from this era -- with hard-drinking, nehru-jacket wearing astronauts and psychedelic production design, you may think you're on a journey to the ""Far Out"" side of the sun -- but this is one sensational era in the evolution of modern science fiction and Journey to the Far Side of the Sun showcases the talent and vision and pure command of entertainment that makes Gerry Anderson a pure treasure.

305894,4,6301024435,"""Doppelganger"" a/k/a ""Journey to the Far Side of the Sun"" was the Andersons' first live-action production. It's an atmospheric, moody, well-produced piece of science fiction, unusual for its day in that despite the (relatively) high production values and excellent special effects, it focused on feelings of alienation and isolation rather than on action. It has a rather leisurely pace, especially compared to films which cater to the attention-span-deprived audiences of today, but I didn't find it slow or boring at all (with the exception of a spaceship sequence which lasts three minutes but feels like an eternity).

Fans of the Anderson's live-action series ""UFO"" (whose production immediately followed this film) would get a real kick out of ""Doppelganger."" There are plot similarities (the head of a multinational space agency has to struggle to get his missions funded), and 11 of the actors went on to appear in ""UFO,"" including series leads Ed Bishop and George Sewell.  Interestingly, many of these actors fill roughly the same function in ""Doppelganger"" as they do in ""UFO,"" including Sewell as an operative who gets a lot of the dirty work done, Vladek Sheybal as a somewhat sinister doctor who works for the space agency, Keith Alexander as a communications operative/announcer, and, amusingly, Norma Ronald as the agency head's receptionist/secretary (she played exactly the same part as Miss Ealand in ""UFO""). Also making their first appearance in ""Doppelganger"" are ""UFO""'s life-size futuristic cars and jeeps (they were given a new coat of paint for ""UFO,"" but I must say they look better in ""Doppelganger"").

The plot is fairly simple.  In the near future (I don't recall if the year is specifically stated), Jason Webb (Patrick Wymark), the agency head, is proposing a mission be sent to investigate a newly-discovered planet which matches Earth's orbit but exactly opposite the Earth, on the other side of the sun. After initial resistance from the member countries, and the discovery of a spy, Webb is able to convince the American representative (played by Bishop) to kick in a billion dollars, which gets the ball rolling so that the other countries eventually accede.  The rocket is launched with two astronauts aboard -- the agency's British chief scientist John Kane (Ian Hendry), and an American astronaut, Glenn Ross (Roy Thinnes, fresh from his success as the lead in the U.S. series ""The Invaders"").  The astronauts crash-land on the planet, and then the plot thickens...

It takes about half the film to get that far.  Much time is spent showing the skullduggery involving the spy, the preparations of the astronauts for launch, the launch itself, and the crash landing, but there's plenty to keep the viewer interested. There are several small touches which add depth to the film and help to create a believable world.  Webb is the same kind of driven, borderline-obsessed leader that Bishop plays in ""UFO.""  Ross is a rather stereotypical macho U.S. Air Force kind of guy, but his wife (played by Thinnes' real-life wife) is an unpleasant character who is rather cruelly manipulating him. Some reviewers here have criticized the film by saying it's very Twilight-Zone-like.  It's a bit of a superficial, easy-to-make criticism, but in some ways it *is* rather Twilight-Zone-like in the way the plot unfolds and in its distinctly uneasy, shadowy, sometimes downright creepy tone.  After a surprise twist is introduced following the crash-landing, the film seems to take a sharp left turn, and progresses to an even more surprising, completely unexpected ending.

I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the screenplay (by the Andersons, with help from Donald James). It seemed to me a step above the Andersons' TV shows, even the ones (like ""UFO"" and ""Space: 1999"") that were specifically geared for adults. Every line of dialogue had a specific purpose and helped either to drive the plot forward or to establish the mood, often accomplishing both simultaneously.  My only real complaint about the script is that I think the Andersons were a bit too taken with both ""2001"" (which had premiered the previous year) and the Bond films.  The business towards the beginning with the spy (played by famed character actor Herbert Lom) played out in a very Bond-like fashion, and the seemingly endless spaceship sequence alluded to above is reminiscent of ""2001,"" but without Kubrick's filmmaking genius to keep the viewer interested.

Much as I enjoyed the plot and the dialogue, I have to admit that my primary pleasure in watching the film was from the production values. While the Andersons were reportedly unhappy with Robert Parrish's direction, I thought it was a well-directed film.  There's a lot of very stylish camera movement, and the camera work dovetails nicely with the extremely satisfying sets.  The sets of ""UFO"" and even of ""Space: 1999"" can feel somewhat cramped (although this is logical given where the shows take place), but in ""Doppelganger"" the added resources allowed for vast, expansive sets which really helped create a believable future world. The camera glides around and caresses the sets and actors in a very effective way.  There's also very good use of fast cutting to increase the tension in certain scenes. The film is so well-made that I was able to watch it twice, hardly ever losing interest. I particularly liked the opening credit sequence (I assume Parrish was responsible for it) which shows computer tapes and punch cards, ironically juxtaposed with Barry Gray's soaringly emotional music. Parrish was an Academy-Award-winning film editor, and I don't understand why he didn't have more success as a director. He only directed three other films after this one.

As with the Anderson's TV shows, the model work is absolutely brilliant. The models are so well-done and well-shot, they give the illusion of great mass, even when you know it's just a model. During the rocket launch there are several shots of the rocket on the launchpad which are are astoundingly realistic. I simply am in awe of the care and attention that the model-makers must have put into their work. Once in space, the shots which include the visibly-spinning Earth are simply stunning, with the atmosphere visible as a soft white glow surrounding the planet.  Then we come to the unfortunate sequence where the astronauts leave their command module and transfer to the on-board landing vehicle. I timed the sequence and it was three minutes, perhaps not that long after all, but the film just grinds to a halt.

The best effects sequence is the crash landing of the landing vehicle.  It's very impressive, in fact it's quite hair-raising.  It looks as one might imagine an actual crash landing would look, with point-of-view shots showing the rocky landscape zooming by and the ground coming alarmingly closer.  I don't think any subsequent film's crash-landing sequence has surpassed this one. The actual crash and subsequent explosions are also impressive.  And there then follows possibly the eeriest moment in the whole film, when Ross sees a round light like a spotlight hovering above the crashed lander. We have no idea what kind of life, if any, is on this planet, and out of the night and the mist and the smoke from the crashed lander, a spotlight shines through... it gave me goosebumps!

Another common criticism for this film is that the acting is wooden. Again, this is a criticism often made of the Andersons' live action productions and sometimes I think people say it just because they've heard other people say it, and it sounds clever given the Andersons' previous marionette shows.  I thought the acting on the whole was excellent, particularly Patrick Wymark as agency head Webb. An intense actor, I do believe that while not as handsome as Ed Bishop, he could easily have played Straker in ""UFO."" I was surprised to discover that he was only 42 when the film was shot (he looks much older). His career really seemed to be taking off at that time, he shot several films in the 1968-70 period, but sadly he died in 1970.

It's interesting how different some of the actors look between their appearances in ""Doppelganger"" and ""UFO.""  Ed Bishop looks handsome but not exceptionally so in ""Doppelganger,"" but I think it was ingenious of Sylvia Anderson to put him in the blond mod wig for ""UFO,"" because it makes him look quite striking.  And George Sewell, who is a stocky and friendly presence in ""UFO,"" looks almost sepulchral in ""Doppelganger,"" with his hair darker and slicked back.  Ian Hendry as Kane did a good job.  I liked Thinnes but I wish he had been given a bit more to do, perhaps some more interaction with his wife. His character is a bit blank and cold, we never really know much about him.

And of course no review would be complete without mentioning Barry Gray's wonderful music. In fact, except for the production values, I would say the music is the best reason to watch this film.  It's Gray at his best, a truly cinematic score which takes full advantage of the bigger budget compared to TV. The already-mentioned opening title sequence and the scene where the spy develops his photographs are standouts. Much effective use is made of the Ondes Martenot, an electronic instrument similar to a theremin, to produce eerie sounds.

I'm baffled that the film world didn't sit up and take notice of this supremely talented composer.  Unless I'm mistaken, Gray didn't compose any films after DOPPELGANGER, and based on this score alone, I would have thought film producers would have been breaking down his door to get him to score their pictures.

I have to say, I don't really know how I feel about the ending. On the one hand, the unexpectedness of it is quite intriguing. It also has a certain cold elegance and logic.  But my problem with it is that the events at the ending occur not because of anyone's character, not because of what anyone does.  Thus, the ending seems a bit calculated and forced, and pointless as well, because no one learns anything, no one grows or develops as a result. Here, the Twilight Zone criticism does perhaps have some merit, because this kind of ending is really more suited to a short story or a half-hour episode of an anthology TV series, where the ideas are more important. But perhaps it's less appropriate in a film, where we've invested two hours in the plot and gotten to know and (to some extent) care about the characters.

All in all I found it a fascinating film and quite enjoyable.",1156636800,24,10518,4.950028392958546
305895,2,6301024435,"Journey to the Far Side of the Sun (1969)
This flick supposes that there is another planet in the same orbit as our earth, but on the opposite side of the sun. As such, that seems interesting, and while this film does have some merit, it is just plain too slow.
The Andersons' plots were just plain boring, and all the mechanical complexity in the world could not help. Not one of their series lasted more than two seasons, because anything the Andersons' ever toutched relied upon mechanical intricacies rather than plot or interaction between characters. If only they had not spent so much time showing the spacecraft being positioned for launch, or the elevator going down the shaft, or the sections of the rocket being assembled, their productions would be worthwhile. But for the same reasons that UFO, Stingray, the Thunderbirds, Space 1999, etc were boring and hence, short-lived, this is boring. The fact that they only provided the special-effects for Director Robert Parrish, did not help much. This film was clearly a full half-hour to forty-five minutes too long. Hooray for the DVD player's next chapter button, because fast forward is not fast enough. If not for such drawn out boredom, this would certainly merit 4 of 5 stars. However, its extensive use of mechanical processes as time-killers ruined an otherwise decent flick. Watch the first fifteen minutes, click next chapter until you reach about an hour into the film. Resume viewing at the point where the guy lands on the other Earth, watch it to the end, and you will not miss anything worthwhile, but you will save yourself 40 - 45 minutes of drudgery.
Synopsis:
The premise is that our earth sends a spacecraft to the other earth; however, it returns in only half the time it should have taken for a round-trip flight. Yet, what if our astronaut hero IS on the other earth? If so, how would he know the difference? Like I said, watch the first 15 minutes, and skip the next 30 to 40 minutes. What you will miss contributes nothing to the plot.

Roy Thinnes and Ian Hendry are the two astronauts who discover the parallel world and soon become entangled in it.  The visual effects work of Derek Meddings still holds up surprisingly well after more than three decades of cinematic advances; and while the uneven dialogue means that JOURNEY cannot really compare to ""2001"" or the more recent CONTACT, this is still well worth watching for its premise, as well as a fine score by Barry Gray.",1012348800,2,842,4.833333333333333

It is an important first step in their transition to live action productions and I think maybe they were trying a little too hard because some of it is a bit over polished, especially the soundtrack.
Barry Gray's film score is very lush and spacious, overwhelming at times.
Gerry Anderson's child-like love for gadgetry and technology is just as obvious here as in all the 'marionation' marionette puppet TV series and films he and his wife produced. This is not a bad thing, it's all done very well on a cinematic scale, but not as well as Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey.
I can see some of that film here as well as Truffaut's Fahrenheit 451.
The concept of this film is a bit weak, it's pretty much typical Sci-Fi pulp or Twilight Zone fare, not very plausible but still fun in a naive sort of way.
A parallel mirror imaged twin, literally, of planet Earth on the opposite side of the Sun.

Visual design is very good in a decently stylish way, but the abstract stream of consciousness segments could be more imaginative. They look a little budget conscious and tedious, we see a number of close-ups of Roy Thinnes' eye.
The early sequence featuring Mr. Herbert Lom (Chief Inspector Dreyfus of The Pink Panther fame) removing a false eye that is a spy camera and going through the actual process of developing the 'film' it contains is deliriously entertaining!
Rube Goldberg himself would have been impressed!
A truly delightful performance by the pleasantly quirky Herbert Lom.
A Great Talent indeed and very much missed.
All of the other actors give very good performances but the characters they portray are a little indifferent towards each other.
I consider this a sign of an overdone production, too much emphasis on story or concept, not enough on Human development. Too much efficiency.

I think the filmmakers of Journey To The Far Side had sincere intentions but not the most original idea to work with.
It feels like a 'B' movie with 'A' movie aspirations, I think it reached its limited potential.
Not a bad thing at all, after this came the UFO TV series and then the pinnacle universal (and ephemeral) masterpiece Space:1999.
The Andersons' obsession with technologies and gadgets were a bit tedious at times but they understood perfectly what was fun and it shows in their work.
They have left us an enduring legacy, something that I still enjoy to this day.

The DVD release has very good video and audio quality despite being Mono 2.0., also has English subtitles.
