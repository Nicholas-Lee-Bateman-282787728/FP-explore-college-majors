7848549,5,6303464440,"I gave Ageless Fitness 5 stars because it is such a great exercise video.  I have used it for a number of years.  It doesn't take very long, maybe 40 minutes or less to do all the exercises.",1388707200,,190,3.973684210526316
7848550,5,6303464440,"I had done step aeorbics about 15 years ago.  I thought I would start right back up, but at 69 years it was way to fast.  This brought it down to my speed and endurance.  I do it all standing up, but the warm up is shown as performed on a chair--The instructor does a great job of helping you with posture which we all need as our shoulders begin to droop.
great fresh start!!",1208563200,,376,3.986666666666667
7848551,5,6303464440,"I exercise at least 5 days a week to this video and yet I don't get bored with it.  Part of the reason for my non-boredom is that I look at one of the participants in the video and tell myself that I want my body to look as good as hers.  What an incentive that is!  I walked into a party a couple of nights ago and three people commented about the way I look.  So I told them, ""start to exercise with Dian!"" I also use an old Richard Simmons exercise video which I like, though at age 69 I cannot keep up with Richard as well as I used to.  So Ageless Fitness came into my life at the right time. Fresh Start is great.  It took awhile for me to master some of the steps, but I have no difficulty now.  I enjoy the workout, it's varied and fun.  Dian's instructions are good, easy to follow.  I especially like the fact that the workout can be done at one's own pace.",990662400,22,867,3.9085714285714284
7848552,4,6303464440,"It seemed so easy the first time. But on the third day, I really felt it! No jumping around, in fact a lot is done from your chair. Warm-up, strength  building and cool-down are all incorporated into thirty minutes. Highly  recommended.",941328000,59,236,4.7317073170731705
