8028999,4,B0002M4GRY,"I only gave it 4 star as it is missing my favorite ""Pudding a l'arsenic"", sung in the original animated movie. ;-)

This version managed to marry modern/contemporary issues with the bande dessin by Goscinny and Uderzo. They would be proud of this one.
The actor playing Asterix is the best of the 3 who have currently played the character. Gerard Depardieu plays Obelix with just the right amount of naivet and bonhomie.

The downside: no English dubbing/subtitles so I cannot introduce my American friends to a ""classique de la culture francaise""",1379116800,,547,4.934782608695652
8029000,3,B0002M4GRY,"Asterix and Obelix remind me of Monty Python.  Much of the humor is visual, so even without subtitles the DVD will give you the giggles.  I would have rated this movie 4 stars if it had subtitles in English.  Watching it is an excellent way to practice your French if you have studied it.",1333756800,,288,4.296296296296297
8029001,5,B0002M4GRY,"An outstanding comedy, Asterix and Obelix: Mission Cleopatra, is the second film based on the ever popular French comics.  The two Gauls, Asterix and Obelix, are sent to Egypt to help Queen Cleopatra build a palace and so win a bet against the Roman Emperor Julius Caesar!

Gerard Depardieu, Monica Bellucci (who is GORGEOUS!), and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs.

The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor (!!!), and the music are all wonderful!

In short, Asterix and Obelix: Mission Cleopatra is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!",1135987200,4,913,5.0198675496688745
8029002,5,B0002M4GRY,"I first saw this while I was living in France.  It makes my day every time I see it.  Jamel Debouzze is hilarious as Numerobis.  The special features are top notch, especially the ""Director's Cut"" by Alain Chabat (director and Jules Cesar) and the shots of Jamel singing along with James Brown.

""Le mec, il s'appelle On, et c'est son phare, alors c'est le phare a On.""",1116979200,4,369,4.462686567164179
8029003,5,B0002M4GRY,"I saw this movie on video so I don't know about extra features, but the film is fantastic and appropriate for all ages.  I originally watched it with my French host mom's grandkids, who were 5 and 7, but I giggled right along with them.

Of course you'll understand the movie if you watch it with subtitles, but it's even better for people who know at least a little French and can catch some of the jokes that don't translate.  Still much of the humor is physical, so it would work well in a French classroom where the kids won't get too frustrated if they don't understand everything.  I definitely recommed this movie.",1093305600,15,621,4.469026548672566
