8507109,5,B006ZMDY96,"I like ""Dark Relic"", unfortunately the DVD I ordered will not play on any player I own not even the multiregional player. I like the storyline and the way Sir Gregory was decisive and always looked for others input before he made a decision. He was honorable and treated others well including others some in his group felt were their enemies. I won't spoil the story for you, just to say it's a nice Sci-Fi version of historical fiction after the Crusades.",1457395200,,456,4.573170731707317
8507110,3,B006ZMDY96,"This is a grade B sci-fi horror film about a group of crusaders in 1099 returning from Jerusalem from the Crusades with a cross that they found, a relic that they want to bring to the Holy Father. They are convinced that the relic is part of the actual cross upon which Jesus was crucified. Curiously their proof is that the cross has words on it in Latin that the man hung on it was a king. They do not realize and the film does not note that the Jews of Jesus time spoke Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek, but not Latin. A second proof is that the wooden relic continues to bleed. They are joined on their trek by a Muslim and his wife who are two warriors, and an atheist female to whom the lead crusader is sexually attracted.
Despite the holiness of the relic, the presence of the cross brings all kinds of horrors to the group. Many die. There are appearances of the devil breathing fire like a flame thrower, possessions by demons where eyes become whitish and teeth sharp as in a vampire, plagues, starvation, thirst, storms, and destructions.",1422576000,,1043,4.409326424870466

Why is it that I expect SyFy Channel Original Movies to be good? Decent, even? By now I have seen so many examples of crappy Sci-Fi (now SyFy for some idiotic reason) Channel Original Movies that you'd think I'd know better. And yet I keep watching them. Case in point: Dark Relic, a period piece from first-time director Lorenzo Sena and written by SyFy veteran Andy Briggs (Rise of the Gargoyles).

The basic idea: a bunch of Templars find a piece of the One True Cross and head back to Rome with it, picking up a few stragglers along the way. Some of those stragglers are Arabs, which leads to a good deal of infighting, tension, and prejudice from the locals. This in addition to various supernatural evil beasts trying to kill them because they possess a piece of the One True Cross and took it out of Jerusalem.

It's actually not an awful concept, but the execution is pure SyFy. Throw in a couple of attractive folks (Clemency Burton-Hill is the female lead, and is classically cute, playing against True Blood's ruggedly handsome James Frain) and some low-budget special effects and you have a movie, right? Well, kind of, if you want to overlook such niceties as script, costume design (you've never heard me rag on costume design before, it's true, but cloth painted to look like chain mail? Oh, come on now), plot, etc. These actors, who are actually not half bad, do the best they can with what they're given. But that isn't much at all. * ",1363305600,3,1486,4.59622641509434
8507112,4,B006ZMDY96,"I originally viewed this movie on the SyFy Channel a few years ago.  Lucky for me it just reaired and I was able to set the DVR.  Atleast I have this on DVR until Region 1 is released.  If you care for the genere then I recommend it.  Its definently a ""B"" movie but its better than most attempts.",1356825600,3,296,3.9661016949152543
8507113,4,B006ZMDY96,"For the genre, I've seen worst. Computer graphics are a bit cheesy but the story line was OK. A bit slow over all. The idea behind the story was good, a relic from the Holy Land being brought back to Europe and it turns out the relic is evil. It could happen... It was originally created for the SCIFI channel and the budget restraints are obvious. I await its release in the US for region 1 players so I can add it to my collection. Currently, the DVD is only available in Region 2 United Kingdom. I've seen others who have viewed the movie and advise not to buy it. To encourage the film industry for better films of this kind of subject matter, I'm willing to buy it instead of the other muddleheaded overrated films Hollywood pours millions into.",1344470400,2,750,4.364285714285714
