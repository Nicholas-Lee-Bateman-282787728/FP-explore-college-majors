8091598,1,B000BRQOOI,"...the worst movie ever made.  I am POSITIVE that the previous reviewer was either being sarcastic, or was the original director of the movie.  Holy Cow, how do some producers in Hollywood get this crap made is a mystery to me.  I haven't seen John Travolta's Battlefield Earth, nor do I plan on doing so, but this movie has to be right up there with some of the worst acting/directing/producing ever made.  Also, all the action heroes all sport the same fraternity-boy haircut.  Jesus Christ, I'm disappointed I even devoted minutes out of my life to watch this crap...absolute garbage",1119744000,,586,4.82
8091599,5,B000BRQOOI,"This movie just blows too many action movies out of the Box Office, in my opinion. It's absolutely one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I would have given it more than five stars if I was allowed to. Its worth three billion. Fight Scenes are Exquisite, Shoot Scenes Kick Ass. Its Definitely a Movie that I could watch over and over again. Watch and be amazed...",1075507200,7,373,4.267605633802817
