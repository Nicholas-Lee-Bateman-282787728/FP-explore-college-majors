8684814,1,B00OU20THI,"I love lots of 'B' horror films and troll around for a nice find.  This one had high reviews here and on imdb so I purchased it.  It has to be some of the worst film making I've ever seen in my life.  The sound quality can be likened to some of the early 80s adult films where you get lots of background noise that often muffles out the speakers.  The story lines are horrible, the acting is horrible,..and for special effects, I really can't imagine that more than $20 was spent in the entirety of any of these films.  At the risk of having my reviews listed as unhelpful, which often happens when you post a negative review of something, it honestly doesn't get much worse than this.",1462320000,4,685,4.27906976744186
8684815,5,B00OU20THI,"Haven't yet seen the all films in the Scared Stiff Collection, but if The Wrath of Steph is any example of the quality and entertainment value, then the entire collection will be more than worth the price. As you can guess, I thoroughly enjoyed The Wrath of Steph.

8684816,4,B00OU20THI,"I've seen two of these flicks and enjoyed both, well ok...I worked on Scary Tales so of course I like it. Loverboy is the other film I've watched. It has surprisingly good production value for a low budget movie. The movie is well written and the editing is tight. No, I did not work on or have anything to do with the film Loverboy and I really enjoyed it. The other two I have never seen so I can't really do an honest review of them. It's all low budget stuff but fun to watch. I imagine the other two are of similar quality. Worth checking out for the money.",1415923200,2,562,4.118181818181818
8684817,5,B00OU20THI,All four of these are great.  The Wrath of Steph shows two strong female protagonists which mixes demonic possession and Carrie.  Scary Tales is a great and fun anthology of horror like Creepshow or Tales from the Crypt (the movie).  Loverboy is a lot like Fear and follows the exploits of an obsessively horrific relationship and Phantom of the Woods follows two main characters trying to determine what strange activity is plauging their small town.,1414108800,3,451,4.986666666666666
