8479035,4,B005M2AKOC,The package came on time but the case was sticky (I just put it into another case that I had). Other than the case it was great. It was a present for my boyfriend since he loves the first one. He liked the movie but it's not as good as the original he missed the actual kangaroos.,1494288000,,280,3.9298245614035086
8479036,2,B005M2AKOC,"It was OK OK. It's nice to see some references from the first movie. I'm disappointed that this movie has no subtitle or closed caption support, I barely understood the whole plot. I replied on lipreading and my best guessing on what they said. If it included CC/subtitle, I might rate this movie three stars. It's pleasure to see Kevin Smith again. Rest in peace.",1487376000,,364,4.615384615384615
8479037,3,B005M2AKOC,"I like the movie.  It is spellbinding.  It is not as good as The Chronicles of Narnia, but it is fun to watch.  If you like movies about parallel universes, evil villains and heroes then this movie is for you.  Also if you miss Kevin Smith who was the villain in the movie considering he died right after it then you should watch it.",1403740800,,333,4.15625
8479038,5,B005M2AKOC,It was nice to see some martial art action for once!!!! I loved seeing Bruce Lee in Action back then.,1393372800,,101,4.1
8479039,5,B005M2AKOC,"While not exactly a sequel to Warriors of Virtue, it is still very good and I liked the characters as they were portrayed. In the end, everything was made right...",1392076800,,163,4.466666666666667
8479040,3,B005M2AKOC,I have no idea where they were going with this one.  The budget was super low and they all but eliminated the 'Roos of Old.  This wasn't worth anything as far as the connection to the original Warriors of Virtue goes.  This should have been marketed as a different movie entirely.  In that regard I was highly disappointed.,1388793600,,323,4.517241379310345
8479041,4,B005M2AKOC,the warriors of virtue return to tao is ok not the best it like a made for tv movie the orginal warriors don't appear was a let down but decent movie,1382227200,,149,3.838709677419355
8479042,1,B005M2AKOC,Movie was boring and too long and drawn out.  My children (and even I) missed the Roos from the first movie.  We had high hopes and were disappointed.,1360540800,,150,4.321428571428571
8479043,3,B005M2AKOC,"Produced five years after the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Warriors-of-Virtue/dp/6305236658/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Warriors of Virtue</a>&nbsp;but not released in North American until almost a decade afterwards, ""Return to Tao"" is the remarkably low-key sequel to one of the more exotic mid-'90s nostalgia classics that no one was expecting. The fact that it was indeed made but under considerably weaker financial backing is even more surprising, not to mention disappointing. The original was a minor fantasy epic, rich with puppetry and special effects, most of which were not able to be recreated for the sequel. But you know what? - not being a huge buff of the original, I actually like this one more. It works better as an action movie, and that's what I'm about. I can see this one remaining undiscovered by most people, but personally, I'm glad I saw it for the sake of comparison.

The story: now a martial arts practitioner, 16-year-old Ryan Jeffers (Nathan Phillips,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wolf-Creek/dp/B000EOTVU2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wolf Creek</a>) is transported back into the world of Tao to do what the Warriors of Virtue could not and defeat a new evil overlord (Kevin Smith).

The DVD cover may have given you a hint, but here's the fact, people: the Warriors are no longer anthropomorphic kangaroos. They're completely human now, a fact that the film explains by them having ""reached a higher level"" but which is clearly a matter of the filmmakers not having the budget to afford the costumes and effects of the Ronny Yu production. With that said, director Michael Vickerman - who helmed the original's screenplay - deserves credit for recreating the rest of Tao with surprising accuracy: it's a little under-populated with few returning characters, but the forests and the Life Spring village in particular look a lot like they did years ago, and a familiar soundtrack and multiple character references really make it feel like the same world. In this sense, ""Return to Tao"" is a more faithful sequel than, say,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Return-to-Oz/dp/B0000DZ3EN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Return to Oz</a>&nbsp;was to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wizard-of-Oz/dp/B00000JS62/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wizard of Oz</a>.

It should be known that Kevin Smith - stalwart fantasy villain from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Xena/dp/B0007DA3VG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Xena</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hercules/dp/B000NQFRU4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hercules</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Riverworld/dp/B0002Y4TWE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Riverworld</a>&nbsp;- died as an indirect result of his involvement in the movie, which automatically gives it some gravity that is simultaneously diminished by the fact that he really doesn't deliver a good performance for this one. The rest of the cast, however, does alright: save for one, the Warriors don't contribute actively to the movie until the last 13 minutes, leaving the dramatic weight to be carried by Nathan Phillips, along with Nina Liu (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Secret-Life-of-Us/dp/B004FOOZ58/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Secret Life of Us</a>) as the queen of Tao and Shedrack Anderson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fat-Albert/dp/B0007N1A36/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fat Albert</a>) as Ryan's returning buddy Chucky, and between them, they make things work. On the martial arts side of things, Nathan and Nina do surprisingly well, though not without much help from stunt doubles. I vastly prefer these fight scenes to the original's offerings: foregoing that annoying reduced frame effect, the sequel offers eight creative wushu encounters, highlighted by a weapons-filled match in the forest and a fast-paced stickfight between Nina and Kevin. The overuse of wirework is clearly derivative of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crouching-Tiger-Hidden-Dragon/dp/B00003CXR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</a>&nbsp;and can easily get on your nerves, but I deem it forgivable.

I'm not sure what kind of budget the filmmakers had to work with, but it seems to have been utilized well enough, since the CGI is limited and it more or less looks like everything that was attempted was pulled off and didn't have to be fudged. Occasionally, the production has the feeling of a TV movie, but this too is overlookable. Cumulatively, what we have here is a flawed but overall decent fantasy martial arts feature that just happens to be based on a cult favorite. Liking the original is no guarantee that you'll like this one, but offhand viewers can watch this one and make what they will with it. Grant it consideration on a slow night.",1326326400,5,5136,6.684131736526946
