8027292,3,B0002ERWS2,"Rave Master Volume 1 - The Quest Begins is a single disc DVD release that contains the first four episodes of the anime series, Rave Master.  The episodes included on this DVD are: ""The Rave Master Part 1,"" ""The Rave Master Part 2,"" ""Release the Beasts Part 1,"" and ""Release the Beasts Part 2.""

This DVD is a dub only release.  In addition, there are also no bonus features on the set, and no trailers of any kind are included.  Tokyopop definitely put this disc together as a ""bare bones"" set, and seemed to only put a very minimal effort into the content of the disc.  When it comes to the episodes themselves, there are no chapter marks included on the set.  If you try to skip ahead, you'll be taken straight to the beginning of the next episode of the disc.  However, I do have to give Tokyopop some credit for including the episode previews at the end of each episode.

The DVDs that Tokyopop released for Rave Master are now out of print, although used copies can still be found and purchased.  In March of 2010, Tokyopop had made the entire series available ""on demand"" as CD-Rs through CreateSpace; however, it appears this only lasted for a short time, because six months later, the CreateSpace listing was gone.  So, Rave Master fans who want to legally own any episodes of the series on DVD have to track down the three DVDs released by Tokyopop that contain the first twelve episodes.  While I wouldn't normally recommend such a ""bare bones"" and incomplete release, this is a case where I have to, since this is the only way that any episodes of Rave Master can be obtained legally.

I wrote this review after watching a copy of this DVD that I was given as a gift.",1290470400,3,1679,4.450980392156863

8027294,5,B0002ERWS2,A totally riveting show.  I could watch it over and over again.,1171065600,,63,4.25
8027295,5,B0002ERWS2,"I've seen about 43 episodes from this anime AND I LOVE IT! This is one of my top anime, it has tons of strange characters, and has a great story line too! It may start a little slow....But its full of surprises!",1106697600,3,211,4.0476190476190474
8027296,3,B0002ERWS2,"Well, since the DVD is coming out on October 12'th, (I am writing this on October ninth, mind you) Im not really sure abouy it. The Manga of Rave Master is very awesome though I would recommend to get the manga before watching the anime though, so you get what's really happening. I've also watched some of the anime on Cartoon Network. The anime is okay, but not some of the best that I've seen. But, if you ever noticed, this is Hiroshimas'(The creator of Rave Master) first anime and manga. The Manga is alot better than the anime though. But over all, the anime is pretty good too.",1097280000,2,585,4.376146788990826
