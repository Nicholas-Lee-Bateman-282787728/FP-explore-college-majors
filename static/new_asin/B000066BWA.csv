1713581,5,B000066BWA,"After using Noelle's Powerhouse I have seen results in that spot that's almost impossible to get flat and toned (the lower tummy)!
This video is perfect if you are short on time.  I use this in the morning becasue the stretches really get me geared for the day.",1019692800,15,261,4.4375
7962375,5,B000066BWA,"I dropped a clothing size just from doing this video, which I didn't expect.  It really helped tone and shape my hips, butt and abs far more than weight training ever could.  It will give you a long, lean dancer's body instead of adding bulk.  And it's only 26 minutes so it's easy to fit into your day.  Buy this video!",1205107200,,320,4.19672131147541
7962376,4,B000066BWA,"Although I would not call this a ""complete mat workout,"" Noelle does put together a well rounded 26-minute program that targets the core and compliments other body parts.  She could emphasize posture a little more than just a few cues she gives (such as how to hold the body on a daily basis).  She goes at a good pace and is pleasant to listen to.

Noelle's introduction of the Powerhouse is decent and her transitions from exercise to exercise are safe.  The breathing technique is explained and she reminds her audience of it throughout the video.  Sometimes modifications are noted.  She misses a big warning during the Cobra stretch (need to note low back issues/pain).  The neck position in several movements also needs to be addressed so the viewer does not strain the neck.

Noelle suggests to follow this DVD twice a week.  In addition to this workout I would add cardio and some weight training because this video should not be one's only form of exercise.  Because this video is short and no progressions are shown, the audience may get bored.  However, for the money, this DVD is a good value and is great for taking on vacation.",1171756800,,1141,4.683417085427136
7962377,5,B000066BWA,"I just finished this routine a few minutes ago and I thought it was really effective! I have Noelle's (Noelle Stumpf is her full name) ""Pilates In Your Pocket"" and ""Focus On Abs"" and they are excellent as well.

Another reviewer, already gave an excellent detailed breakdown of the exercise sequence so I'll talk about other aspects of the program.

I found this program to be about the same level of intensity as Ana Caban and Hilary Burnett's Intermediate programs. Noelle's program is a bit shorter than those two in that it's under 30 minutes. They all follow the Pilates Intermediate series for the most part with some differences between them both in the exercises chosen, the pacing and the execution of the exercises.

There are also some unique versions of exercises, such as a bridge type exercise where you lift each side of the hip one at a time in the full bridge position. It is a very interesting variation on a bridge that really warmed up that area in a way that I've not encountered before. Another unique exercise (at least to me) that Noelle does is a lower leg lift type exercise called ""Figure four"". To do it you bend one leg, place your heel of the opposite foot on the knee of the bent leg (which you eventually straighten), scoop up and then do leg raises. I have about 33 Pilates programs and I've never seen either of those exercises before.

I found the side series on this DVD particularly challenging, my hips were burning by the end of it. Noelle places a lot of emphasis on side lifting and inner thigh movements rather than front to back (though there is some of that as well)

Noelle has a lot of energy but is not overly peppy. She keeps the practice fun while making it quite challenging. She gives enough verbal cues without over instructing which helps the practice flow really nicely, you're never idle.

I also like the way the program is presented. It's in a brightly lit studio with a class full of students. Two of the students show modifications of the exercises. One shows simpler modifications while the other shows more advanced versions of the exercises. Noelle stays somewhere in between in terms of the level of difficulty. I like this because you are given plenty of options yet it's done in a way that is easy to follow. Some DVD's try too hard to explain every modification and get extremely verbose and distracting (Jillian Hessel's Beginning program, which is a solid program, nevertheless does fall into this trap)

The music is also very subtle and non-distracting which I like a lot, it creates a relaxed atmosphere without bringing attention to itself.

If you are looking for a pretty challenging intermediate level Pilates program, either as your first intermediate program or as an additional program to mix things up a bit, I highly recommend this.",1162771200,2,2812,4.701219512195122
7962378,5,B000066BWA,"I bought this video on the advice of others on Amazon, and I must say I have been very pleased.  This is a great everyday workout, with a nice mix of exercises to leave you stimulated.  All parts of the body are worked.  I have tried some other Pilates videos as well, and I think this is the best.",1097452800,2,298,4.016949152542373
7962379,3,B000066BWA,"The following is a list of the exercises included in this workout.

Hundred

Single leg stretch

Double straight leg stretch

Crisscross

Pelvic tilt/glute squeeze

Bridge, raise one leg, then the other

Lower ab crunches with one leg crossed over the other, which is straight and pointing to the ceiling

Pendulum (drop bent knees to one side, then the other)

Scissors (lying on your side)

Up and down

Outer thigh leg lift

Side stretch

The set is bright, with a white floor that has concentric circles painted on it. Noelle lies in the center. One modifier shows an easier version throughout; another shows an advanced version, and Noelle does the intermediate version. The production values are high, with no odd camera work or other distractions.

I would rate this workout as intermediate, because while Noelle gives form reminders (keep your legs glued together, pull your abs in, etc.) she does not really explain each exercise enough that a beginner would be able to understand how to do it. Also, I noticed that Noelle didn't put her legs in the traditional position when doing the leg work lying on her side, so this would not be a good workout from which to learn proper Pilates form and techniques.

This workout does not include some of the traditional Pilates matwork exercises, such as the seal, neck pull, saw, etc. I must admit, I missed those exercises. I've been doing a lot of Pilates lately, and while I can't reliably do a full teaser every time, my abs have gotten pretty strong. So, while I appreciated some of the different exercises this workout includes, none of them seemed to really work any part of my body quite enough.

I really liked Noelle. She's warm and encouraging, and seems more like a ""real person"" than other Pilates instructors who sometimes seem superhuman. She looks a little like Jennifer Jason Leigh, and is wearing a red top and cropped pants. She reminds you to have proper form throughout the workout, and makes some other comments (like about one movement being ""small but mighty, just like me""). She doesn't really talk to the other exercisers at all.

One odd aside-I searched a bit, and couldn't found Noelle's last name anywhere. The credits simply say ""Noelle,"" as does the bio on her website and some other sites online.",1093996800,8,2561,4.814220183486238
7962380,5,B000066BWA,I have been doing Pilates for over a year now.  I have tried many different Pilates DVD's.  I have also taken several Pilates classes.  Noelle's Powerhouse Complete Mat Workout is by far the best I have seen.  I know of several ladies in my class that have ordered this after trying it in class.  It gives you a workout that tones almost every part of your body.  Most Pilates DVD's I have tried only target a particular area.  This is an overall workout.  I have seen the results!,1090454400,5,481,4.386363636363637
7962381,5,B000066BWA,"I have done some Yoga in the past, but was looking for something that was a bit more challenging.  Noelle's Powerhouse Pilates workout is definitely that!  I love her cheerful, encouraging style and feel that her comments about some of the moves are entirely appropriate. I was a bit leery that she would lean toward the new-agey kind of talk and thankfully she does not. Her cheerful tone keeps me motivated to push on, and the instructions on each position are very clear and concise. This is one of the few tapes I didn't have to rewind to see a position repeated before I could do it. The workout is tough but fun.(Yes, I said fun!)  I've noticed quite a different already in my muscle tone and strength since doing this terrific 26-minute workout just twice a week. I'd do it everyday if I had time, which is amazing because this is *exercise*!",1052092800,19,849,4.5359477124183005
7962382,5,B000066BWA,Noelle has a friendly down to earth presentation. She doesn't waste time between exercises. Her instructions are simple and to the point. Noelle makes Pilates so easy to understand. The exercises don't require acrobabic ability to perform but you can really feel them working. I am thrilled with the results. I have a smaller waist and more flexibility than I have ever had despite years of weight training and I am 58 years old. I highly recommmend Noelle's Powerhouse to everyone. I have tried several other Pilates workouts and this is by far the best.,1036022400,27,555,4.852631578947369
7962383,5,B000066BWA,"Owning the Orchid Pagoda Pilates studios in the Washington DC area, I have searched for a video to recommend to our clients when they can't make it in for lessons.  Most of the ""popular"" videos are not true to the integrity of Pilates and many of the teacher videos are too technical.  Noelle fills that void perfectly.
In 26 minutes this challenging workout will simultaneously strengthen muscles and build flexibility.  Pilates is great for abdominal work and will also improve posture.  Noelle gives very clear, concise cues and the tape is easy to follow.  She also demonstrates modifications to make the exercises easier.
I know it sounds too good to be true and IT IS!  Pilates is not like other programs so you do not work to exhaustion.  Pilates will energize you and because it requires concentration it is impossible to stres about work or the kids while doing these enjoyable exercises.
Thank you Noelle for bringing out a Pilates video with substance!",1028937600,35,963,4.871165644171779
