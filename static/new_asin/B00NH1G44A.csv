8678145,5,B00NH1G44A,"We are hooked on Pawn Stars/Pickers/Counting Cars & Resto! We are frustrated that History/A&E will NOT release any other DVDS as we're stuck on 2011's (Season 4) with Pawn, Only Season 2 with Pickers & Season 2 of CC. This is a 2 Disc set but not complete. NOW there are no new Episodes. Rarely on History. FYI shows a few on Sundays but that's it. Sad. We can only hope the Show will return. Time will tell.",1433116800,,408,4.243589743589744

8678147,1,B00NH1G44A,they do not work on anything anymore. in fact it sometimes feels like they have stuff still laying around from previous restorations and say hey we just restored this. like that apple peeler. it is just scripted tv now. no restoration. bought every dvd set. now i am done with the show. i used to love it. now it is unwatchable.,1429228800,,328,4.39344262295082
