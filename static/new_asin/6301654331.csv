to  take  a  job  working  for  a  North  country  Antiquarian.  Oh,  it's  an interesting  job.  At  least,  form  time  to
time.  But,  Heather's  being  nipped  at  the  heels  by  an  old  friend:  She's  home-sick.  The  High  holidays  are
coming  on  fast,  and  she  wants  to  be  with  them,  and  her  best  friend.  But,  there's  a  slight  problem.  Her
elderly  car  has  crapped  out  on  her  -  and now,  she  is  -  as  we  say  -  in  the  market.

She  spies  a  really  nice,  clean,  silver  Jaguar  Mk II  sedan.  After  some  haggling  with  the  car lot  hijacker  -
I  mean,,,,,salesman....  she  gets  the  keys,  and  spins  off  in  her  new  pre-owned  Jag,  back  to  the  office.

But  -  back  at  the  car  lot  -  the  salesman  is  having  some  second  thoughts  about  the  whole  deal.

Then,  some  fairly  creepy  things  begin  to  happen  to  her,  after  she  picks  up  a  stranger,  a  beautiful
girl  -  and  then  -  a  guy.  And,  believe  me.....he's  not  a  guy  you  want  to  bring  home  to  meet  your  Mum.

As  for  the  creepy  things.....someone  is  watching  her....and  he  has  a  little  investment,  too !!
Get  ready  for  some  understated  chills  and  thrills.  This  is  an  independent  film,  one  of  the  very  best  made
in  the  modern  era.  There's  not  a  frame  of  wasted  space.  You'll be  thinking  about  this  amazing  little  film,
long  after  the  storyteller  has  finished  with  this  fine  little  gem  of  a  screenplay.

Now....you're  on  your  own.

Dark of the night boast a few eerie moments and a pretty good script but unfortunatly has its share of flaws as well. Heather bolton (sporting some ronald mcdonald hair) purchases a used jag and and is quickly regretful after some spooky noises and unsettling premonitions she has while driving it. These moments in the film are pretty effective unfortunatly what could have been sheer terror veer off into heathers ability to act like someone who would actually expeirence this unnerving phenomenon. She talks to herself and yells at the car ""your not going to scare me your just a car""! also the music in the film is kinda corny taking away from the atmosphere of dread that the story is trying to deliver. On the plus side the movie is pretty good at telling its story and with a running time of 80 minutes won't try the viewers patients. Overall not a bad movie to curl up with next to a loved one on a stormy night (or if your like me alone with a half pint of hagen das)lol....tear.",1317081600,,1092,4.465

7813463,5,6301654331,"Just to let that ""EUROPEANS"" as you state in your review had nothing to do with this film. Were you alsleep during this film. You state that you can only see a trunk opening and a window roll down. So you missed the part where mary carmichael appears in the car and gets her revenge, or the part where you hear her being strangled in the back.

Okay, its not gonna get an oscar, but the acting is good, especially david letch, and heather bolton. The film is quite old, so its not going to compare to todays horror flicks where you have screaming bimbos with blonde hair running in to dark rooms with no weapons, being chased by a killer in  a mask (YAWN).

You review was unfair to people who might want to purchase this movie, also you might want to get a geography lesson, as NEW ZEALAND does not come under Europe. Thank you.",1250208000,,829,4.267515923566879
7813464,5,6301654331,This movie is a wast of time I had written a good review without seeing the whole film and based it on recomedations. Its crap all the car ever does is roll down its window ot unlatch the trunk that's it then in the last 5 minuites it drives by itself and crash for no reason. I can't understand all the hype I got from people. Europeans must have differnt ideas on what makes a horror movie because this is one stinkaroo,1081296000,,421,4.146341463414634
