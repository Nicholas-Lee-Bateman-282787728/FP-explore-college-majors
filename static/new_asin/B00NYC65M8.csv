6685394,4,B00NYC65M8,"It's certainly not without cliches and occasional narrative problems, but Jurassic World is a fun diversion that really deserves to be seen in theaters. With everything going for it, this dinosaur flick is practically tailor-made for the silver screen rather than a laptop monitor. That's thanks to the terrifying spectacle of hungry prehistoric creatures (duh) and a surprisingly colorful visual atmosphere. It delivers where The Lost World & Jurassic Park III came short: a Jurassic Park sequel that's actually worth watching.

But please, don't go in expecting complete scientific accuracy or an original plot. This kind of critique is a waste of time for a movie that's obviously not invested in reinventing the wheel. Instead, it proudly serves its niche as an updated callback to the themes and epic visuals of the first film that wowed us all. I won't spoil much in this review, but it's nice to see a connection to the first movie's actual park, seen about midway into the Jurassic World.

To be fair to moviegoers on the fence about seeing this film, the plot is practically another version of what unfolded in the original Jurassic Park movie. The premise is what was essentially laid out in the trailers and marketing, so there are no immediate surprises here: an experiment to create a new dinosaur, the Indominus rex, backfires as she manages to run loose and provide another reason why a dinosaur theme park is a bad, bad idea (more on the film's attempt on commentary later). Her hobbies include eating siblings, provoking a Hitchcock-ian attack on the park's busiest area, and being an all-around clever girl.

Parents should be aware that the violence and sense of panic are reminiscent of the first film, and it's rated PG-13 solely because of that. The blood and chaos continue to escalate towards the ending, which completely justifies the buildup and price of admission. Intense by every summer popcorn movie standard, Jurassic World sends itself off with a climax that us moviegoers were really wishing for in the back of our minds. If you caught what Dr. Wu (B.D. Wong) says in the main trailer for this film (there's even some subtle hints in the film itself, but I won't divulge them), then you might be able to guess what the last solution to handling the Indominus rex is...

The humans of Jurassic World come up short, as most of them, with the exception of Chris Pratt's raptor tamer Owen, have little to no depth. It's a disappointment for me to write this, because the cast is stacked with proven talent; the problem is that their characters are written in such a cardboard fashion. For example, by the time we get to Vincent D'Onofrio's character as the park's security chief, it becomes almost painfully obvious that his disposition to weaponize the creatures is merely a box the film checked off to provide some not-so-subtle social commentary we didn't really ask for. Luckily, this isn't the pure focus of the film, and we're certainly not spoonfed constant dialogue the entire runtime. I'm not so bothered by it if it weren't for the fact that this and its sci-fi/action film cliches (ex. romance between the two leads, emotional connections between man and animal, etc.) causes the film's poor screenwriting to really stick out in this case.

Surprisingly, though, despite all of those issues, I still recommend Jurassic World for the energy and thrills it creates in an impressively paced and natural way. The dinosaurs, not surprisingly, are the stars of this movie, much as it was in the very first Jurassic Park. Whether you love or hate the CGI, there's no denying how enjoyable it is to see each creature come to life onscreen as the havoc unfolds. They might be the only reason for enjoying Jurassic World, or any of the 3 films that preceded it. The filmmakers seem to know that all too well, so why wouldn't it be?",1434067200,2,3861,4.843939393939394
6685395,1,B00NYC65M8,"The Jurassic Park franchise joins the ranks of the Paranormal Activity, Final Destination and Saw franchises in completely wearing out its formulaic plot until it's threadbare. The original directed by Spielberg with its story adapted from the Crichton novel was a creative achievement. Number four is neither creative nor original. It does nothing whatsoever to advance the original premise or further the story. Pull out the original script, list its major plot points, characters and plot devices used, put new window dressing on it for a screenplay, crank it out in time for a Summer release, and wow audiences with a spectacular display of current technology visual and sound special effects. The strategy is keeping the action and special effects at a continuous breakneck pace so the audience can't see that the emperor has no clothes. I'm dismayed Spielberg is one of the executive producers. I would have washed my hands of it until there was something creatively original to further the JP story line.

The first two sequels were weak compared to the Spielberg original, and now there's a third JP sequel? They've been completely formulaic including this one: dinosaurs on the loose dramatically munching up the people left and right who deserve a gruesome end for one karmic reason or another, all because a clueless moron ignores all the likely consequences for personal scientific glory or greed and does something incredibly stupid that eventually turns them loose. Let's not forget about the kids who need to be rescued, an estranged couple that need to be reconciled with each other, and an ending that has an obvious setting for yet another JP movie. Compare the JP franchise to the Sam Raimi Spiderman trilogy, or the most recent Christopher Nolan Batman trilogy, or even the series of Resident Evil live action movies. All three of those franchises have sequels that continue the story with original, creative development. Just like its behemoth dinosaurs with pea-size brains, Jurassic World has magnificently impressive special effects and ADHD non-stop action on a gargantuan scale, with pea-size originality.

Rent any one of the first three, or buy it used, and watch it instead (I recommend Spielberg's original). Afterward you won't need to see this one; you'll have already seen it. If I could give this 1/2 Star I would. I'm extremely disappointed in the JP franchise. All three sequels have been great opportunity badly squandered.",1434067200,8,2460,5.1475
6685396,5,B00NYC65M8,"Aside from terrific acting and visuals, the main thing that makes Jurassic World superior to both of the previous Jurassic Park sequels is indisputably its ability to stand on its own two feet, while also hearkening back to the theme of man vs nature started in the original film.

The original 1993 Jurassic Park was, in many ways, a futuristic retelling of the Mary Shelley's classic novel, Frankenstein. In both Spielberg's film and Shelley's novel, we see the march of human progress for good or ill, and the inevitable contest between science/man and nature/god, in which (spoiler alert) man loses. In both stories we see human's attempt to harness primal forces that they cannot hope to control, and in the end wind up paying the price.

Picking up years after the events of Jurassic Park, Jurassic World in a sense tells the same story. Not in the overly-derivative way that the previous sequels did, with talking dream-raptors and cheesy Godzilla parodies, but with a fresh story that continues with the next logical step of the original theme, that is, human beings playing god. Only now, instead of bringing dinosaurs back into a world that isn't ready for them, they've used genetic modification to take it to the next level, creating super dinosaurs, but without taking the responsible precautions necessary to ensure safety.

The film isn't perfect (I think the subplot about weaponizing dinosaurs has been cliche since Alien 2), as I believe the original Jurassic Park to have been, but all in all it's much more grounded and clever, as well as honest to Spielberg's original vision, than its two predecessors. The film is able to bring the original into the background via the musical score and some callbacks to the first set, without allowing itself to be overshadowed. For example, the scene in the control room with the old Jurassic Park shirt and the subsequent conversation was an excellent callback to the stunning use of practical effects in the first movie, without coming off as apologetic for the use of CGI in the new movie.

All in all I think Jurassic World is an excellent way of (hopefully) closing the circle that started more than two decades ago now. The final shot of the film, the T-Rex roaring over the island while the classic song plays, is an excellent shot to end the park's fated saga on.",1434067200,9,2330,4.846733668341709
6685397,5,B00NYC65M8,"Brothers Gray and Zach (Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson) are being shipped off to spend part of their Christmas vacation with their aunt Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard).  She runs Jurassic World, the theme park that has been built over the bones of the original Jurassic Park.  Gray loves dinosaurs and is thrilled at the idea, but his older brother Zach isn't really that interested.  When the brother arrive, they quickly get passed off to others since there is much Claire needs to take care of, including the new Indominus Rex and the enclosure that needs to be finished so its exhibit can open in a few short weeks.

Meanwhile, theres Owen (Chris Pratt) and his work training the Velociraptors and Hoskins (Vincent DOnofrio) who thinks these trained beasts will make the ultimate weapon.  Owen keeps warning that the Raptors are completely unpredictable and should not be let outside the cages, but Hoskins won't listen.

When the unthinkable happens (as you know it will), chaos ensues with Gray and Zach in the worst possible location.  Will they be okay?  On an island full of tourists, will anyone survive?

This is essentially a high tech monster movie with the dinosaurs and the special effects as the real starts, but thats nothing new for the franchise.  Still, its fun.  And thats what truly matters.

The beginning does a great job of setting things up, introducing the characters and the new dinosaur.  Once things begin to fall apart, the action is non-stop.  There aren't many jump moments, but the thrills are still real and fun.

Being a monster movie, the plot isn't completely original.  A few plot points caught me by surprise, but others I saw coming a ways away.  Likewise, the characters are just developed enough to make us care about the outcome.  Thats no real surprise, and it hardly dampened my enjoyment.

The actors do a great job bringing their characters to life and making us believe their terror.  Likewise, outside an early establishing shot, the special effects are magnificent.

This is easily the best since the first movie in the franchise.  Its fun, mindless entertainment.  Sit back, and enjoy the rush.",1434067200,,2142,4.888888888888889
6685398,4,B00NYC65M8,"Fans of dinosaurs have had it pretty rough in popular culture these past several years.  Aside from the scattered release here and there, we haven't had a tentpole event celebrating our favorite extinct beasties, but after thirteen years away from the big screen, the granddaddy of them all, Jurassic Park, is finally back with a new release that satisfies our cravings for all things dinosaur related.

For a series that's been going on for over 20 years, it's impressive that Jurassic World manages to make such a good impression - especially after two sequels of arguable quality - by returning to the original idea of the series: having a theme park filled with living, breathing dinosaurs, and actually have it fully up and running.  In this timeline, Jurassic Park came back after the original incident, rebranding itself as Jurassic World and successfully running for years without a single incident.  But, as you might guess, that's about to change in a catastrophic way.  Much like the first film, Jurassic World returns to the ethics and impossibility of trying to control nature, and how our desire for bigger and better things in our entertainment can and does have catastrophic consequences, something the previous two movies largely passed on.  The much-mocked motorcycle raptors, for example, are shown that while they can be trained, they are not tame by any means, and will happily munch on anyone given half an opportunity.  And Indominus Rex, the super-intelligent, nearly unstoppable big bad of the film, is the perfect embodiment of man meddling with things he shouldn't, and is a terrific addition to the series.

Even with the ethical debates, however, there's no doubt that this is the most dinosaur-packed ""Jurassic"" film yet.  The movie knows we're here only for the dinosaurs, and gives us exactly what we want.  You want dinosaurs?  You get lots of them, from Triceratops to pterodactyls, velociraptors and the ever-classic T-Rex, and all the scenes you could ever want of them running around causing lots of chaos (or not: the petting zoo is absolutely adorable).  The film's also smart enough to nestle character development revolve directly around the dinosaurs, such as having them joke with each other after narrowly escaping death, or when trying to deal with the fact that the Indominus Rex is somewhere nearby.  In short, everything in this film revolves around the dinosaurs, instead of people trying to repair their relationships or other cliched ideas that have nothing to do with dinosaurs.  In fact, the best character moments occur with humans and dinosaurs (both carnivores and herbivores alike) directly interacting with each other, including a very moving moment that echoes the Triceratops encounter from the original film.

Speaking of nostalgia, I loved the winks and nods to the prior movies, as well as sequence that will put a T-rex sized grin on the face of anyone who loves the original film.  And while I do miss Grant, Malcom, and Ellie, it is nice to have Dr. Wu back, along with a quick cameo from Mr. DNA, but I especially adore that they brought back the same Tyrannosaur from the first movie: she doesn't show up much, but absolutely steals the show when she does.

But while while Jurassic World succeeds as a fast paced dinosaur adventure, there are a few weak spots: there's a subplot of InGen trying to militarize the dinosaurs, but I never bought into it: yes, raptors are dangerous, but they're still weak against bullets and rockets and the like.  Compared with tanks, drones, and other current weaponry, the idea of utilizing dinosaurs in war sounds like it belongs in an Asylum mockbuster.  I was also surprised that, while the visual effects are great all around, the CGI dinos in Jurassic Park still look, move, and behave more believably than the dinosaurs here.  But my biggest problem with Jurassic World is the climax of the film; while it is undeniably amazing (I'd actually put it as the most awesome moment of the entire series to date), the way it ended ran counter to what it was building up to, and left a sour taste in my mouth.

But Jurassic World's missteps are far outweighed by what it does right:  Give us all a dinosaur theme-park that's believable, and then have lots of dinosaur-focused action when all hell breaks loose, and humans that don't slow things down with unnecessary and unwelcome personal problems.  Jurassic World is a great installment of the franchise, and with a few loose threads hinting at a sequel, I can't wait to see what comes next.",1433980800,2,4544,4.926605504587156

I liked the fact that the movie came with a BluRay disc, a DVD disc and a digital copy. I love to use the digital copy and I stream it to a high resolution digital projector into a 12 foot diagonal picture. Backed up with a 7 channel stereo system the movie seems like you are watching it at the theatre.

The BluRay picture and the audio track were just excellent. I liked that the film was constant action and people were fighting to survive. Like most movie series you don't get the wow factor like you did in the first film.  This is still a very good film and I rated it at 4 stars. Had it been the first film, with the expected first impression wow factor, it would probably have been a 5 star rating.

6685523,2,B00NYC65M8,"I didn't expect this movie to be as awe-inspiring as the first, but this was worse than I expected. It's always stunning to me that producers and directors will make films with a huge budget for special effects (which turned out really excellent in this film) only to create something with shoddy writing, a flimsy, boring plot and bad acting. Well, sadly, I guess this is the state of American cinema today. It's no wonder we now look to TV series to fill the void. The one bright spot in this film is the special effects, which really were entertaining. Unfortunately the great special effects could not overcome the other flaws. The acting was bad, with the exception of Omar Sy, who they foolishly kept hidden for most of the film. In all honesty, the film would be much better if they axed Bryce Howard entirely (how did she get this role?) and gave Omar Sy more screen time. But even with better acting it would be hard to overcome the lackluster writing. The characters were one dimensional, boring, stereotypes and the plot was predictable. Bottom line - don't pay to watch this movie.",1532217600,,1093,4.639175257731959

I think that someone is playing a joke and the truth is, there is no Customer Service Department at Amazon. One is expected to use one of their suggested problems and if yours doesn't fit, well too bad. I guess I have all evening to rant since the movie I have paid for won't load. And it appears that there is nobody to complain to, so I will go ahead and use a different movie service. I've been using Amazon for a while, but actually they have failed the be able to deliver on one order three different times. It might be a case of being too large to manage the company effectively.

6685584,5,B00NYC65M8,"I really liked this movie. None of them will ever be as good as the first one, though. Still, this was a solid movie that pays a lot of homage to the original. There are lots of easter eggs for fans of the original movie. There is plenty of action and it does a good job of entertaining old fans and bringing new fans up to speed on the dangers of creating a dinosaur theme park.

I really didn't know how I felt about the new direction of the plot at first, but I'm made my peace with it. Basically, it centers around the old idea that humans will exploit something that should be wondrous and special for personal and financial gain. Also, the old adage about when anything new is created the first thing some people ask is how can it be used for war.

After watching the second movie in the new arc, I've come to like it a little better. Also, since I heard what they're planning for the series. They're opening the world and trying to get away from just retelling the same story with new characters. While I loved the original and want to see more of it, and I'm sure many of you do too, I also understand that we'd eventually get tired of it and we'd be comparing it to the originals and they wouldn't hold up.

What I am really worried about is them leaving the island. My least favorite part of the entire franchise is in the second movie where they take a few dinos to LA. I loved the first part on the island where they're in the wild, but not when they're in the city. It just turned into godzilla at that point. So I hope they handle that aspect better, going forward. I see a few possibilities that i'd love to see explored.

This is a good movie, though, that I think new and old fans alike can enjoy.",1531440000,,1714,4.169184290030212

6685718,1,B00NYC65M8,"Jurassic World is a very dumb movie with an unbelievable premise and generic characters that make idiotic decisions. I have so many concerns with Jurassic World. Why is there another Jurassic theme park after the first three movies? Do people never learn anything? How many more of these movies will audiences have to endure before a new story line appears? Why weaponize raptors? Why endear raptors when they are the main scare? Why hybridize dinosaurs? They already have T-Rexs and raptors which already terrify people. Bigger does not always mean better in the case of Jurassic World.

This movie falls into largely similar territory as The Lost World. Namely, the CGI is ugly and aged poorly very quickly. The environment is ugly and the setting is not explored in an interesting way. There are too many characters, so no one gets any character development. I could not even name you 5 character's names from Jurassic World. The John Williams theme to Jurassic Park is heavily underutilized and Michael Giachinno's score is pretty bland unfortunately.

Furthermore, the acting is atrocious. Chris Pratt is not convincing as a leading man. Pratt is no Sam Neill or Jeff Goldblum. He lacks charisma and realism. He makes me cringe hard. Bryce Dallas Howard is a good actress but gets to do nothing but be annoying like Julianne Moore's character from The Lost World. What a waste of Vincent D'Onofrio, Nick Robinson, BD Wong, Irrfan Khan, and Omar Sy. All capable actors given nothing to do and nowhere to shine. Terrible writing, dialogue, and story lead to absolute failure.

Now to get the two sequences I enjoyed out of the way. I genuinely liked the underwater dinosaur scene that felt like a Seaworld show. It was thrilling and fun. I also appreciated the neat Gyrosphere set piece. It was a nice original sequence for some cool scares. I can admit when something works and the Gyrosphere certainly felt fresh.

On the other hand, Jurassic World is a 2 hour movie that feels like a 3 hour movie with about 1 hour of actual content. It is slow, long, and stupid. I hated it aside from the 2 aforementioned scenes. Proceed with caution.",1530144000,,2142,4.8283378746594

6685791,3,B00NYC65M8,"Honestly even the second one of the original trilogy is better than this movie, the saving grace of this movie is Chris Pratt and he gets less screen appearance. They opted SPOILERS in the end to do an action fight of big dinos just because overall the movie was more wow than content and storytelling. I say this to see if the second new movie is worth while but now I have my doubts even just renting for $3 feels expensive for what I watch here. I know these movies will never capture the magic of the first original one but still this feels like any other generic CGI fest hollywood movies with special effects spectacle and little drama to make me care about the characters and the dinosaurs. pretty disappointed except for Chris Pratt he saved this movie in my opinion",1528761600,,774,4.457746478873239

6685830,4,B00NYC65M8,"NOTE: I recommend watching the first 2 first.  Jurassic World does not stop to explain anything fans already know.  It jumps right into things.

I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this.  Didn't think I'd like it.  I liked the first 2, but thought this looked like JP3.  Previews made it seem like dinosaurs would do ridiculous things, just because.  Well, that is exactly what we've got here, TBH.  Everything about the ""Indominous Rex"" is stupid.  It has insane abilities and does the impossible whenever the movie wants.  Even the reason it exists seems dumb.

But here's the thing:  The made a good movie around all that.  It's got good jokes and the relationship arc b/w the brothers, the one I didn't care about, was actually really good.  The other big character arc, with Claire learning to care about living things, was also pretty effective.  They try to make her romantic relationship with Owen some sort of metaphor for that I think, since he's literally telling her to care about living things.  But it doesn't even need that to work.  The character interactions and arcs are what work here, and that's why the Indominous Rex stuff is easy to forgive.  It moves the plot forward.  Thing's doing it's job.  Also, if you're worried about the trained raptors thing, it's way less dumb than it looks in trailers.",1527897600,,1323,4.719298245614035

6685994,3,B00NYC65M8,"Warning Spoilers ahead:

This movie did a lot of borrowing.  Mainly it borrows many themes and scenarios from the 1st film.  Let's see: 2 kids who have special access due to an influential relative, kids put in harm's way inadvertently, containment breach, super-predator eating people, velociraptors versus super Rex, the Villan getting eaten, Isla Nublar, Dr. Wu (played by the same actor aged 20+ years with expanded role).  It also borrowed from Hitchcocks ""The Birds"" with the pterosaur attack and even gave a nod to ""Jaws"" when Zara met her end.

Aunt Clair steals the show!

In some respects it is more of a re-imagining of the original film rather than a sequel to the series.  Perhaps the series needs to move on to other themes.  The fate of the pterosaurs is unknown.  Perhaps they will fly off and land on the mainland for fun & games in the next installment?

2 stars off for being a bit too predictable and unoriginal.  However, it gets 3 stars for superior CGI and Animatronics that add up to a grand dino romp!",1523750400,,1026,4.644444444444445

6686086,3,B00NYC65M8,"After I went to see this, the one question almost everyone asked me is: Is Laura Dern in this? When I said no, there is just another annoying, ineffective twit as the lead female character, most expressed no interest in seeing this. Why could the creators not learn from the third movie? I think Bryce Dallas Howard's character is the Jar Jar Binks of the new Jurassic World series. There is a lot worth watching if you dial down your expectations. Super cool dude/animal trainer who works with raptors. The fact that they actually OPENED the park so you get to see thousands of people being hunted by dangerous animals. Super cool raptors (I love Blue the raptor though I wouldn't want her as a pet). And SPOILER ALERT: the token African American escapes being eaten this time. Nice kids (you will hate the older one at first, but like him when the dinosaurs are loose and he becomes the protector of his little brother). If they could only erase Bryce Dallas Howard entirely from this movie I would watch it again. I mean this isn't the 1960's, do we still need to have a heroine who whines and nags through the whole movie and needs a cool dude to save her designer clad butt over and over? And poor Chris Pratt, I kept hoping they would find a more deserving love interest for him, maybe another naturalist or animal trainer like himself, but no he gets Miss Corporate Dumbdumb. Most of the other characters are unsympathetic. B.D. Wong makes another appearance, but he is kind of a douche in this movie. I had hopes for the geek and geekette in the control room. I thought they would do something heroic together and then get together so I would have a couple to actually root for, but geekette bails when things start getting dangerous leaving the geek on his own to help the heroes from the inside. So there are really no heroic women in this movie at all. And now I guess I should mention the dinosaurs. The effects are great, they look more real than ever. But the new dinosaur is only a little bigger than the T Rex and frankly not really that scary. The raptors are amazing, each with their own distinct personality, forming their own alliances, yet they are bonded to their trainer who raised them. Nothing is as scary as the original movie though. Those raptors that could open kitchen doors still give me nightmares! So enjoy the action, dream of riding a motorcycle in the midst of 4 lethal raptors, just don't expect a rational plot or great character development with a few exceptions. I only hope the next will be better. I'm sure i will pass if BDH is in it (no disrespect to the actress, just the character she plays).",1520035200,,2638,4.509394572025053

6686248,1,B00NYC65M8,"***SPOILERS BELOW***

I'm always willing to give sequels a chance and not assume they are merely being churned out as cash cows.  Of course, no film could have matched the awe and wonder of the original, but Jurassic World fails even if we try to set the bar a little lower.  I think CGI is part of the problem - people nowadays get so wrapped up in the amazing visual effects that we forget to evaluate the substance of movies (writing, acting, whether it touches us emotionally or makes us think afterward, etc.)  Things I don't like:

1) There is no tenderness in the film.  Yes, even Jurassic Park had those moments where humans were able to appreciate and be humbled by the beauty of the natural world being recreated in the park.  This film is more nonstop terror and destruction.
2) On the point of humility, compare Neill's breathless reaction in the original (""It's...it's a dinosaur!"") to Pratt's casual ""You just went and made a new dinosaur?""  Yes, the characters in this film are already aware of the park, but it makes Pratt's character much less heroic.  Indeed, there's irony in the few scenes when he seems to show concern for the raptors.  That's not consistent with his employment background (a guy who apparently answered an ad on Craigslist for ""dino trainer"" with no moral reservations about where the raptors came from).
3) This is too much a film about animals (dinosaurs) being made to shed blood in the service of humans.  While perhaps that was the only option at some points in the story, well why write a story like that?  I suppose that is part of the warning message we presume is always wrapped up in the Jurassic series (that arrogance breeds suffering and death), but I'm not sure it was presented very well here.  Ironically, I think more people left the theater thinking, ""Cool, they turned dinosaurs into weapons to kill other dinos"" rather than, ""So part of the lesson is that even if people are saved in the disaster, a great many other creatures will be made to suffer and die.  Let's never make dinosaurs in labs!""
4) When he mentions the I. Rex hunting only for sport...what genes are those from?  Aren't people the only animals that hunt for sport?
5) Speaking of hunters, I would think any professional hunters would look down on this film.  When the special forces group rolls up with the raptors in the lead to kill the I. Rex (a dinosaur the size of a small building), why are they carrying relatively small caliber weapons?  What good are 5.56 rounds (or even .308 for that matter) in this situation?  Expecting to come upon a giant horde of fairly large wild pigs?  (Sure, one guy has a rocket launcher, but he misses.  How do you miss with a rocket launcher?)  Shouldn't everyone have had grenade launchers and Javelin ATMs?  I know I know, then we couldn't have advanced the plot...
6) And going back to a previous scene, how do you miss with a minigun?  I know I know, then we couldn't have advanced the plot...
7) The ""'Little brother, you're an idiot' turns into 'I love you and will always protect you' after near death experience"" cliche.
8) The ""predictable massacre of super evil greedy company man"" cliche.
9) End scene with the raptor and T. Rex.  Seriously!?  After all that carnage, they throw in a completely illogical ""warm fuzzy"" moment?  I'm surprised the Dirty Dancing soundtrack didn't start playing.

This list can go on, but my time would be better spent re-watching the original Jurassic Park.  I should have just done that in the first place.",1516406400,4,3514,4.642394822006472

6686289,4,B00NYC65M8,"Jurassic World is very entertaining, and a fun way to spend two hours.  I think reviewers who nitpick it need to keep in mind what it is: a movie about a dinosaur amusement park, and why it's a bad idea.  This movie is NOT intended to be Citizen Kane, people.  Lighten up.

I found Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard entertaining enough.  By movie's end, I wanted Vincent D'Onofrio's character to get eaten, so he accomplished his task in making his character thoroughly unlikeable.

My only gripe with this product (and why I only gave it four stars, since I truly love the movie itself) are the extras.  It seems to me like there could have been a lot more put into them.  What's there is interesting, but too brief for my tastes.  And there's no commentary track, which I HATE.  I often find commentaries to be almost as entertaining as the films themselves.  For there not to be one with this movie is really unforgivable.

So, a five-star movie that gets docked a star for extra features that are less fulfilling then they could/should have been.",1515369600,,1052,4.566844919786096

Too few humans are consumed, none of the humor of the original is present and it's half the movie it could have been with a better screenwriter (rather than the corporate committee you can tell sat in on the ""development"" meetings).

To me, this one with a few secret surprises, made the movie impossible to miss. It was like watching a horror movie though. I would NOT let children watch this movie at all. This is not a family movie. Not by my standards. I would never go on an island with these horrible creatures. Challenging enough to sit through another time. My husband wanted to watch it.

The first will always be the best, but this film does a wonderful job of both paying homage to the original and giving us something modern. It continues to ask the questions that Crichton was concerned with - just because scientists can do something, should they? The second and third films were mediocre in my opinion, but this one really stepped back up. The acting is decent, the plot is fast paced, and the characters are likeable. It falls short only in a few small ways: a couple characters are needlessly killed off, the character development feels a tad rushed at times.

Typical Hollywood thinking they have to up the ante every release with a bigger dinosaur. This one being the Abdominalrex or something equally dumb. It's part poison dart frog, part Chameleon, part ninja turtle, part t rex, and it's pretty stupid. In fact, the coolest dinosaur in the entire movie was the giant fish in the pool that had only a 4 second cameo. Jurassic park, but underwater with Submarines, trying to escape from that thing would be so much better than two kids on Vacation at a resurrected Dino-theme park.

6686447,2,B00NYC65M8,"Big spoilers ahead, also spoilers for the three other movies in the series.

I wanted to like this movie, its got the traditional music, theres a new cool dinosaur or two, the concept of the park actually opening to the public is a good one, the special effects seem solid, Chris Pratt is entertaining in Guardians of the Galaxy so he should be able to headline this movie just fine, right?
Wellit doesnt work. The story is full of holes, the movie was miscast (or their roles and script are weak, maybe both). I don't really care about what happens to anyone in this. Theres some really dumb stuff in this, enough that it takes me out of the movie. Actors are mumbling their lines constantly  or is it the sound FX that drowns them out? This seems to happen in a lot of movies these days

On world-building-
Ostensibly the characters know what happened in previous incidents on the island(s) so they should be ready to deal with any issue that occurs, but when they create a military-experiment hybrid dinosaur and keep it next to a theme park next to thousands of helpless people and have no way to contain or kill or even slow it down if it breaks out, I start questioning the believability of the script. After the Lost World massacre  a hundred armed experienced hunters butchered by tyrannosaurs and raptors, they should know better than to send only a dozen men into the jungle with something WORSE than a T-Rex waiting for them. They KNOW whats out there, they're on its natural turf, what are they thinking? Its a worthless plot that they expect people to swallow because they know people just want to see CGI dinosaurs crashing around and don't care about the movie surrounding them. The original movie put a ton of thought into the world and the park, like it was a real place. This didn't feel real at all.

Why do they not have tanks and gunships and artillery and hundreds of soldiers ready for anything, given the danger of the animals the park is hosting? They put literally the smartest, most dangerous creature that ever walked the earth (besides humans, that is) right next to a huge banquet of tourists. Why is there not a Great Wall of Isla Nublar, complete with literal minefields and heavy machine guns and mortars and bunkers and all the trimmings, standing between the military experiment dinosaur pen and the park? A real facility, like the one they designed in the original, would have done exactly that. They repeat the mistakes people made in all three of the other movies, AND start making all new ones! 1. No backup systems/defenses (Jurassic Park). 2. Light troops with no support (Lost World). 3. Cloning pterodactyls (III). 4. Giving dinosaurs super abilities (Jurassic World).

The velociraptors being trained like dogs does not fit with the original or Lost World or even 3 (Grants raptor-skull whistle does not count), these are utter monsters that live to kill, they cant be reasoned with by people. This inconsistency throws rationality out the window in favor of cool imagery like a guy driving a motorcycle alongside a group of raptors and its just stupid. It really IS stupid though because the Super-Rex mind controls the raptors into turning on their handlers. Also stupid is the T-Rex and the raptor teaming up to fight the Super-Rex and doing everything but high-fiving each other. Why would they do this?! They don't even know each other, much less have any natural inclination to assist one another against a larger predator. The raptor *might* have picked up some team skills from being trained, but the T-Rex would not. This MAKES. NO. SENSE. Its fan service by people who want to trot out the old familiar faces from the original and turn it (for a minute) into a buddy cop movie starring dinosaurs and no doubt call it paying homage to the final encounter in Jurassic Park.

On casting-
I like Chris Pratt  when hes doing more humorous parts (like Guardians). As a serious actorI dunno. His character was justthere. Is he supposed to be a combination Dr. Grant/Muldoon analog? Of course, hes competing for attention with rather a large group of people. It felt like maybe there were a few too many. The crowds walking around the park are huge! The named cast with speaking lines is huge! People we don't know deliver dramatic dialogue and then leave and we learn nothing about them. Bryce Dallas Howard is a Stepford Wife in a corporate suit. Im sorry to say that, I really am, but its true. She is a terrible follow-up to Laura Dern. The two kids roles are just a lame retread of the roles from the original movies. The tech guys are nonentities, not like Arnold and Nedry from the original. The scientists are nonentities with lots of lines about stuff thats ultimately pointless, unlike the original (even though BD Wong reprised his role). The corporate guy, Masrani, mumbles a lot and gets in the helicopter and tries some heroic stuff and crashes and burns, and I did not care. I cared about Hammond, the CEO in the original. The military and dino trainer people all talk a lot and its not really important what they say. Unlike the game warden in the original, Muldoon had presence and his lines were relevant. (I like the original, can you tell?)

On music-
The soundtrack was alright, but not really memorable beyond the traditional main theme that we all know and love. Seems like most people didn't like The Lost World, but I love that movie, and it had a strong, unique soundtrack that still fit with the Jurassic Park tradition. Jurassic World needed some more individual character, more stand-out, to its music.

On story-
Its just a retread of oh no, what hath science wrought?! and oh no! the military and shady contractor people have created something they cannot control and also they're up to something were only going to hint at in this movie! and were repeating all the mistakes the previous park CEOs made because we are CEOs, corporations are bad and uncaring and care only about quarterly profit increase (true, but boring). Also, there were a lot of scenes of crowds of people walking or driving around the park. Maybe if they cut those bits and focused more on a stronger story itd have been better. Feels like that type of scene tends to be a filler for something more important lacking. We don't need to see them, we already know where things/people are. Its like in TV sitcoms where they show the house or wherever before cutting to the inside and the cast.

Final thoughts-
I cant blame the people who put this together. They did what they did, and people ate it up and it did really well, why should they change anything for the sequel? If I were them, I wouldnt change anything either. But it was still a pale imitation of the first movie. Please try for a smaller cast of stronger characters next time. And a actual story.",1507852800,,6807,4.659450457951707

'DINOSAURS!""
""That raptor trainer's hot. I'm texting Shelly.""
""Hey, those kids look familiar. So does that guy. That's... what's his name.""
""It says InGen That's, like, from the very first Jurassic Park.""
""No! Don't go in there! It's --""
""Stop the spoilers, dude, we haven't all seen this twice!""
""Ewwwww, gross, it ate him?""
""Idjit shoulda seen that comin'. Just like a big old gator. It's in their eyes.""
""Dinosaur motorcycle!""
""I think they're running alongside the bike, honey, but that does look fun.""
""GO, DINOSAURS!""

There are some gross moments that may upset younger kids (Intermission/potty break exercise: Depict a guy getting munched by a 14-foot carnivore with more political correctness). There are sufficient dinosaurs, a cool raptor/ATV scene, interesting raptor/trainer bonding (awwww), and the ending of course leaves potential for a sequel.

Pull on your comfy sweats, pop a bowl of popcorn, and settle in for more cool dinosaurs. This one wasn't as uber as the first few, probably story line fatigue, but it's still a fun way to pass a lazy weekend morning. Set your brain in neutral and pretend you're a four year old watching COOL DINOSAURS IN YOUR VERY OWN LIVING ROOM.

Honestly, I'd only buy this one if you need a complete set. Stream it otherwise. If you're just looking for any dinosaur movie, get the first Jurassic Park or Lost World. Still, cool dinosaurs, eh?",1501977600,,1452,4.991735537190083

Holy moly! Total 100% non-stop action with some humor, the very hot Chris Pratt and giant insane dinos. The treacherous military guys were there and a little bit of lecturing on saving extinct species and greedy and indifferent capitalists, but mostly 90+ minutes of OH MY GOODNESS! And in 3D!

6686697,1,B00NYC65M8,"Terrible.  I was by no means expecting a good movie, but I thought it was going to be so bad it's good,  a typical cash cow B movie.  There is not one redeeming quality.  Not even Chris Prat's adorableness.

After nearly two hours it became one of those sci-fi versus movies people keep making.  The CGI was so corny.  The plot didn't flow,  it was predictable,  acting was crap.  Shark vs Mecha Shark was better.

Wait,  I just came up with a good thing to say.  This makes the second and third Jurassic sequels look amazing.  I always liked them but they never came close to the first.  This movie was so bad it makes them better.

Hell,  Sharknado is a better movie than this. It gets worse...they set it up for more sequels.",1500249600,,728,4.313432835820896

It worked just fine without any glitches.  The 3d elements on this movie are OK.  I have seen more engaging 3d composition but this has definitely become a staple in our 3d collection.

The lab where corporations can sponsor the creation of a new dino species (gene splicing). One of the three sponsors is the rep from Verizon (cellphone svc provider). During the film the characters repeatedly experience dropped c-phone calls. As a results people are eaten by the ""you know what"". Who is the c-phone service provider? Is it the Big V? Could it be AT&T? Well at least cellphones do not beat you up (UAL and American Airlines).

One thing about the dino species in the movies. They are all bigger than life. This includes the Velociraptors and the Mosasaur, but this is Hollywood so who is counting.

I, like many others, wonder how on earth she could run across an island full of dinosaurs wearing those ridiculous heels. This movie is not realistic at all, which is ok. If you can suspend your disbelief then the film provides a very worthwhile distraction! Pratt really makes the film and his relationship with the CGI raptors is fun to watch.

6686984,5,B00NYC65M8,"Very good follow-up to the first three Jurassic Park films.  This time the persistent, money-loving INGEN corporation has followed through on their original plan and built and improved on the proposed park on the island Isla Nublar (from the first film).  They come up with a Disney-type theme park but they get above themselves.  The not-mad but god-minded scientist create a hybrid beast with a mulligan stew mixing of dino genes and DNA and end up with a monster that is smarter than the average human.  Naturally havoc ensues.  At one point pteradactyls and pteranodons fly loose and hit the park at full steam.  They even have a Mosasaur that looks bigger than a present-day Blue Whale.  In the end a T-Rex and Velociraptors save the day (but not before giving humans a few hair-raising moments).  Hopefully survivors will sue the heck out of INGEN, but if they do the, no more movies.  I believe a fifth film may be in the works.  The ending, with the scientists removing tons of embryos and other equipment will provide the next film.  I liked this film, highly entertaining.  Very highly recommended.",1489276800,,1108,4.804232804232805

6686996,5,B00NYC65M8,"This is a fantastic movie and a worthy successor to the original Jurassic Park. It does what is says on the tin: It shows you a lot of amazing dinosaurs. It helps you live the excitement of going to a theme park featuring real dinosaurs. It has an interesting (if somewhat formulaic) plot. And it has fun and loveable characters and dinosaur danger drama. It even tries for the same philosophical profundity that the original Jurassic park tried for (and also failed to achieve).

In many ways, this movie is better than the original, mainly just because the special effects are better and the sense of going to a really cool park is cooler because the park is cooler, and it's full of people. The plot isn't as good as the original. The bad guy in the original was more hateful and it was easier to cheer against him. The tension and drama were better in the first one. I actually like the characters better in this one. The main dinosaurologist was cooler in the first one, and the kids were more likeable, but I like the main lady in this one more, and supporting characters are cooler. For example, I hated that stupid chaos guy (Jeff Goldblum) and the lawyer. I didn't like the first park owner as much as I like this park owner.

Be aware that there are going to be a lot of people who are going to be harshly critical of this movie and they're not going to tell you the real reason why they're being critical. They'll think of some bogus film critic reason for criticizing it, when the real reason is that they are offended that the high-powered executive lady is also the comic relief. If you're a feminist, you may be offended at this. If you're not, I think you will not care.",1489104000,,1686,4.418006430868167

I enjoyed it in spite of the problems with editing, such as (1) why did they insert the boys' parents' impending divorce? Was this a plot line that they decided not to pursue in the end? (2) When they are in the paddock of Indomitus Rex, there are only two men, then suddenly there are three men there. I presume they decided to add the third guy at the last minute so the dinosaur would have someone to catch and crunch on. (3) Why was the instructor vomiting in the grass after the helicopter landed? (4) Why was the helicopter's rotor still turning after everyone had left? (5) What happened to all the workers who had been raising the walls around Indomitus's paddock? One minute they were there, the next, they were all gone. In spite of these problems, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.

The characters are emotionless cardboard cutouts inserted into what is laughingly called the plot.

Sorry but so Many really stupid moves by the Characters, one right after another it was like a B horror film no C. There were two-three nice spots that makes you smile The T- Rex for one, you'll know what I mean if you rent this. When you have a women running through the jungle in high heels and still wearing them once out (hello ) you don't break off the heels at least so you could run, of course you would kick them off. I won't go on, I wanted to like this, I just couldn't get past all the stupid moves. Though the Irrfan Khan character was likable.",1481846400,,646,4.126984126984127

I was very disappointed in the content of this movie. Nowhere near the interest factor of the previous movies.

It seems that they have had plenty of warnings on this subject from previous history (earlier movies). And, the acting was really bad.",1481846400,5,480,4.5813953488372094

6687564,5,B00NYC65M8,"This review is for the Limited Edition gift set, and does not review the movie itself.  I don't pretend to be a film critic, and obviously I like the movie or I wouldn't have bought an LE.

The box itself is sturdy, with a large clear plastic display showing the figures posed.  I like the attention to detail in giving the inside of the box a background, making the box into a diorama.  The figures are detailed, with good textures and crisp shapes and edges, even on small features like the individual teeth.  They have individual bases and could be posed nicely on your nerd trophy shelf if you choose to unbox them; that's clearly what they had in mind, and it's a nice reference to the existence of exactly such a trophy shelf in the movie itself.

The disc set included is the same as the Limited Edition without the gift set figures.  It's a round tin with the Jurassic World logo on the lid, each disc in separate paper sleeves; the sleeves aren't so bad actually, it's better than a complicated booklet where the discs have to be taken out in batches.  It comes with a flimsy paper ""base"" to give it a flat bottom, but it appears that this is just a leftover of packaging for displaying the LE in shelves, as it really doesn't affix to the tin in any way and would be practically useless for shelving the round tin.  Fortunately the boxed set just has a nest for the tin on one side, so you don't have to remove the figures to watch the movie, and it can be replaced and stored/displayed that way.  The special features are there, and not particularly disappointing, but it's standard disc release stuff.

Of minor note, the marketing on-disc is mildly obnoxious.  I remember when DVDs had no previews, and it seemed skip functions had buried them for good, but this one has so many the trailers have chapters!  Not only that, but the disc menu has a marketing ticker enabled by default, though this can be disabled in the setup menu.  This is starting to tread dangerous ground with intrusive marketing on products you paid to own, and I do not approve.

Despite those gripes, the figures are impressive enough and amazon is listing this at a price comparable to regular 3D releases of many movies so that I can't help but be happy with it.  If you like fancy boxed sets, this is a nice one.",1481500800,,2301,4.442857142857143

6687656,3,B00NYC65M8,"Jurassic World was a little too unbelievable to accept, but the special effects were good. Hey, using Velociraptors as blood hounds chasing after some mega gigantasaur that threatens to eat all the paying customers at Jurassic World while the hero is joining the hunt on a dirt bike along with paramilitary troopers on 4 wheel ATV's was a little over the top. Then there is the scene where the aviary for the Pterodactyls gets broken and they all escape and descend on the people eating and carrying them off. Of course mere shoulder weapons were no match against the gigantasaur, so in a final desperate attempt, the heroine opens the paddock to the T-Rex cage and the last 10 minutes or so involve an epic battle of the Gigantasaur, the T-Rex and the Velocipraptors.",1480464000,,768,4.7388059701492535

6687709,4,B00NYC65M8,"The latest and greatest installment of the Jurassic Park film series, Jurassic World finally brings to life the theme park that was supposed to open in the first Jurassic Park film, and for that reason, Jurassic World is the best one of the series. Another highlight is the creation of a genetically modified/hybrid dinosaur (i.e. Indominus Rex) and the introduction of the sea dinosaur, Masosaurus.
However, the film has some ridiculous/unbelievable scenes/concepts such as Owen's ability to train dinosaurs. That's just not reality. Despite that, the film has the same concept of the other Jurassic Park films (i.e. dinosaurs break loose on an island, eat people, and then roam free, etc.). It was refreshing to have new characters in Jurassic World, and it would be awesome if, in reality, there was a theme park filled with real dinosaurs.

6687712,1,B00NYC65M8,"True disappointment to the JP series. I reluctantly watched this movie after cringing at the trailers. I was hoping that the film would be better than it appeared in the trailers. Wrong.....the CGI in the 1993 film is by far BETTER than the cheap graphics utilized in this one. And the amazing thing about the original film is that LMI had to basically write their own software and programming for the CGI effects. There wasn't anything like it available at the time. The original film took over 3 years to produce.....this one was done in only 78 days, and it is noticeable. The acting is  awkward and very corny. Throw in a plot that doesn't flow very well, is excruciatingly predictable, and has numerous cheesy archetypical references to the original production, and you have yourself a ""C-"" film, in my opinion. Don't waste your money if you are a diehard JP fan. Big letdown....I want my $13 back",1479859200,9,902,4.708860759493671

6687785,4,B00NYC65M8,"Steven Spielberg,the director of Jurassic Park and The Lost World:The Jurassic Park, returns as the new executive producer of the Jurassic Park film series in this new film known as Jurassic World. This is the fourth installment of the series that presents a cast that includes Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard with Colin Trevorrow taking over the movie's director.

Twenty-two years after the events of the Jurassic Park,a theme park that has cloned dinosaurs was made at a fictional island called Isla Nublar,which is located off the Pacific coast of Central America. The park has successfully operated for the last ten years. But things go wrong when a genetically created dinosaur known as Indominus rex escapes and breaks lose causing extreme danger into the park. All breaks lose as the people try to manage to survive the event.

The fourth Jurassic Park film was definitely nostalgic in the sense that it tries to provide more scares and violence coming from the newly cloned dinosaurs. It was a good idea to have an operational theme park as a setting since this was probably the main purpose of having this cloned dinosaur in the first three films. At least,they finally found a way to have an operational theme park and have achieved that objective. Since the sequels The Lost World:Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park III ,the viewers are once again treated to a darker film that focuses on the danger presented by the cloned dinosaurs as compared to the characters involved despite having Claire's transformation from a corporate woman who hates dinosaurs into becoming a warrior-like woman who is more appreciative of animals in the end. Terror film lovers will surely appreciate this film. No wonder it earned more than a billion dollars when it was released world- wide.",1478822400,,1785,4.9865771812080535

6687968,3,B00NYC65M8,"My opinion on this flick is divided.  On the one side, the special effects are magnificent.  The idea of adding a seagoing, aquatic reptile is certainly well inspired and imaginative. It rounds out a franchise that already includes terrestrial dinosaurs and aerosaurs and it had it's menacing moments.  The other side however includes two leading actors: Bryce Dallas and Chris Pratt who both have all the character development and emotional range of two rocks.  With Sam Neil, Laura Dern, Sir Richard Attenborough, Jeff Goldblum and BD Wong there is a greater range of emotion and character development wheras with Pratt and Dallas, they have the same flat, deadpan countenances throughout the entire movie.  The two brothers far exceeded those two. Add to that, Chris Pratt as a ""dinosaur whisperer"".  They should have named the raptors Fido, Rover, Spot and Snoopy for all the stupidity this exhibited.  I wish that Amazon's ratings included  acting ability, plot and special effects.  Please leave Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas out of the next installment and bring back the original crew.",1476835200,,1092,5.159090909090909

6688047,5,B00NYC65M8,"In an ever growing catalog of Blu-ray titles, only a select few releases stand out as being superior and above the ""norm"". In my opinion, This offering of Jurassic World meets that superior standard. Contrary to the Amazon Product Details which shows an aspect ratio of 2.20 to 1, this Blu-ray actually delivers a seldom used 2.00 to 1 picture image. This rare aspect allows your television display to light up far more pixel real estate than the commonly used 2.40 and 2.35 to 1, but DOES give an added element of theatrical widescreen effect versus the full frame 1.85 or 1.78 to 1.  Universal has done an outstanding job not only with using this unique aspect ratio, but also with contrast, brightness, color saturation, etc. This disc release offers razor sharp clarity with great consistency, and shows tremendous quality both in long shot cinematography as well as close up event scenes. On a scale of 1 through 10, the picture quality is definitely a solid ""10"". The audio soundtrack is just as brilliant as the picture image, offering a wide and intricate dynamic range with finite crystal clarity and thundering loud effects when appropriate. Beyond the entertainment aspect of the movie itself, this disc release offers a great visual and audio experience. I viewed this disc using an inexpensive Sony 4K Upscaling BD player, and 55"" Hitachi 4K Television. While the movie played, I snapped a few digital camera pictures in order to be able to show real world results of the offered picture quality. The images will be added to the bottom of this review. Take note of the unique 2.00 to 1 aspect ratio, as well as the overall picture clarity.

Regarding the movie itself, . . . it is spectacular. Jurassic World does an excellent job of providing a fresh and vibrant approach to the ""Jurassic"" theme, including an all new cast of characters, while also paying direct tribute to the very first Jurassic Park film. Some of the memorable props from the original movie are even used in a unique and creative way. The story flows well and pacing is very swift, you definitely won't be dozing off during this one!!!  JUST GREAT.

This Blu-ray / DVD Combo is easily purchased either ""new"" or ""used"" at a very low price. At the time that I ordered my copy, I was able to place a nice used copy in the mailbox for about 6 dollars (different site with colorful 4 letter name). GOOD LUCK!!!

Hollywood picked this woman, Ron Howard's daughter, Bryce Dallas Howard has lots of fleckles on her face and she just wasn't right in this Jurassic Park film. The side plots, the nephews: one kid is upset because his parents are getting a divorce. The other kid is a young teenage boy, who stares at girls, really lame. The only one worth watching was the guy (Chris Pratt), who tames the dinosaurs. I heard that Bryce Dallas Howard said she wasn't going to wear high-heel shoes, on the sequel to this movie. Why can't Hollywood get someone like Laura Dern or Ta Leoni to play in the next movie of Jurassic World sequel? In the first three Jurassic Park movies, they ALWAYS cast a different leading woman so why would Hollywood hire Bryce Dallas Howard again? I can't stand her and definitely won't watch the sequel if she's in it.",1475798400,,928,4.529761904761905

The trainers and owners of the park want to create dinosaurs for capitalist reasons and make money off of them, while the army wants to use them as trained biological weapons and killing machines for the military.

So Annoying Kid #1 and #2 go to Jurassic World because their mother happens to work there.  And they go alone.  Their aunt couldn't even be bothered to look after those two little brats and neither can their mother so they go alone on the tour by themselves.... WHAT CAN POSSIBLY GO WRONG?!

Raptors are nothing but housecats I guess because there's this guy who's the ""Dinosaur Whisperer"" and he understands their hearts or some such silly thing.  In the other movies, raptors were these frightening monsters that'll rip you apart as soon as look at you but in this movie they're completely tamable if they know who's boss.

Of course there's a generic bad guy that wants to send raptors to the army.

I tried multiple blue-ray players and tried other blue-rays which still played fine.  When I looked on the blue-ray disk I noticed that the material on the disk itself started to deteriorate.  Maybe that's not the problem why my disk doesn't play anymore, however, I have quite a collection of blue-rays and none of them have this problem.

6688389,2,B00NYC65M8,"Well, figured I'd write my thoughts on Jurassic World (and heads up, it's a long one). WARNING I will be revealing spoilers so if you don't want to hear them then do not read this.

Okay, so to start, I'll say I did not like the film. I probably made the unfortunate choice of watching the original (Jurassic Park) right before me and some friends left to see the new one. That gave me some unrealistic expectations for the film that otherwise I would not have had. And just so you guys know, I tend to be exceptionally hard on movies, especially if the film is a sequel to one of my personal favorite films of all time. I was hard on The Hobbit trilogy (which shouldn't have been a trilogy, just saying), and I'll be just as hard here.

I started to worry about this film when I saw the trailer. My first tell-tale signs that the film wasn't going to hold up was 1.) they didn't use the original theme music in the beginning of the trailer 2.) the screenplay just sounded drab 3.) the story line (creating a new dinosaur hybrid), although bringing some themes back from the original film, seemed almost to obviously bad and 4.) the whole raptor scene seemed like an overly-dramatized version of what we were actually going to see, effectively only there to ensure ticket sales.

All of those issues ended up having some serious relevancy when I watched the film, with some exceptions.

I'll start with the music. Yes, they had the original theme come into play. No one's denying that. However, I tend to listen to the Jurassic Park theme all the time, and I realized that the very song I listen to that you can buy off of Amazon MP3 was literally copied and pasted in the beginning of the movie! Thus, the composing of the film, primarily in terms of the original theme, was not really ""composed"" by any means. Then for the rest of the film, we listen to random bits and pieces essentially unrecognizable to anyone, fans of the series and non-fans. This is partly because John Williams did not come on to compose the film which was a darn shame, especially for those that loved the original soundtrack. What, does Universal just not have enough money? Is that it? Either way, what we got was a mediocre-in-comparison soundtrack that no one will ever remember again.

The screenplay, and this is primarily in terms of dialogue between characters, was by no means bad. The messages they wanted to get across, got across. There were some funny jokes that I genuinely laughed at (though nothing compared to the ferocity of jokes from Age of Ultron). Where the screenplay falters is in it's cliches. It almost seems like the writers didn't know which cliches to use, so they threw every single one known to man in! This includes:
- Punk teenager that hates life, is disinterested by everything, and who doesn't seem to care about his brother in the slightest, but who eventually manages to rekindle their relationship by the end of the film.
- Parent (in this case, Aunt) that works to much and doesn't have enough time to spend with children.
- Ex-military guy (in this case Navy) that holds the lead role and is BA in just about everything he does.
- Obsessed military general guy who's only goal is to make and create new weapons for war.
- Divorcing parents (which, I might add, took up maybe five minutes of the entire movie, and otherwise was a complete waste of time for the audience and the characters).
- Obsessed scientist who'll do anything to make sure his work progresses and he gets the funding to do it.
- That one funny character who cracks the majority of the actually funny jokes, and then somehow by the end has some important role that helps save everyone.

If I missed one, I'm sorry. In the original, you had:
- A paleontologist who doesn't like children, an interesting character personality you don't see very often.
- Geeky girl that know's the most about technology, which now-a-days are Asian males.
- Womanizing scientist that says all of the more philosophical lines throughout the film.
- Nervous lawyer, one who you dislike in the beginning of the film, but then kinda feel bad for him later on when he gets eaten.
- Determined yet refined, cultured, and kind rich man.
That last one actually is in Jurassic World, and he is probably the most diverse individual of all the characters in the film. The amount of cliches compared to the diverse personalities from the original that you just don't see as much today is staggering, and made me face palm every time another cliche presented itself.

Overall, the story line actually surprised me. While yes, everything that goes wrong, goes wrong (I mean, what did you expect), they do make a worth wile and respectable point about how society, their audience, continues to only want bigger and better attractions to entertain them (something I think the film incidentally and ironically tried to achieve vs. the originals more up close and personal approach). They made several points about animals in captivity, which I liked, using unpredictable items as full blown weapons, and, of course, the dangers of progress. These philosophical points were the strongest aspect of the film for me, and my only wish is that we had had Jeff Goldblum return for his single, iconic line ""your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.""

However, and warning guys, this is a big spoiler for yall's, one bigger point was this big deal about ""the food chain."" They kept hammering about how the new dinosaur was going to realize where he sits on the food chain, that everything else is beneath him, that these creatures live based on the idea of the food chain, that the food chain is dependent on the species etc. etc... Except when they had they chance to demonstrate this said ""food chain"" they didn't take it! To give you background here, we're at the end of the film, the T-Rex and the... uh... other one, the bad one, are battling it out, but it is obvious the T-Rex is losing. That made sense to me, as, after all, the... other one, is faster, stronger, smarter, and just overall better then the T-Rex. Well, right as the T-Rex is about to get KO'd, out of the ""blue"", one of the raptors return and distracts him, giving the T-Rex time to get up and fight back. After the fight and the creature is dead, the T-Rex turns around and looks at the raptor, the two of them staring at one another. Here I was going, ""oh heck yeah, time to show your dominance and take him out, here we go."" Now, it's not like I wanted her to do it, knowing the raptor saved her life and all, but it wasn't about what I ""wanted,"" it was about what I knew was going to happen. These creatures run on instinct, not moral dilemmas. They kill anything that moves, or at least the T-Rex does, and so here was a perfect chance for the writers to demonstrate that said ""food chain"" as well as the lack of care or knowledge these animals posses. But WHAT HAPPENS!? The T-Rex turns around, and leaves. This was a shocking scene for me. It's like the creators wanted to make a movie about dinosaurs to appeal to dinosaur fans, then slap all of them across the face so that they don't have to represent nature on the television screen. When this happened, I just shook my head and said no to myself. This was a wasted opportunity to bring back everything we know about dinosaurs and the danger therein.

As for the raptor scene, this maybe took up about five minutes of the movie. They ride together after the creature, the creature communicates with them, and then the raptors turn on the humans. It was so short that I face palmed for roughly the millionth time. It was clear to me that the whole scene was meant only for the marketing aspect of the film, nothing more, nothing less. So if you go into the film excited about that scene, don't be. It doesn't even really happen.

There were other scenes that simply didn't make any sense, or smaller problems that had they changed would've made the film significantly better. This includes:
- Children's decision to ride away from the safe zone and into danger territory after they received a clear warning sign to turn back and return home.
- Jimmy Fallon's terrible cameo that initially made me laugh but then cringe at the product placement.
- Scene in which casual conversation between people is occurring and then a raptor jumps into the room out of no where, providing no tension.
- The idea that raptors could actually be used as a weapon in war.
- The fact that the owner of the park had no idea as to the genetics the new dinosaur that he invested millions into had come from.
- Very little use of animatronics, something I was crossing my fingers in the hopes that they would make use of (and every time they did make use of animatronics, they made sure that they had the actors touch them, making it seem all to contrived).
There are many more, these are just one's that stood out glaringly while I was watching. Note that these issues are mainly just nitpicks and only caters really to people who care as much as I do about the film's story and cohesiveness, as well as production/set/costume design and direction.

To end this, review of sorts, I'll say this: what made the original so good was it's mystery. You're thinking, wait what? There's no mystery in Jurassic Park! We know about dinosaurs. We know what they look like. We don't need a movie to inform us of that! Well, yes, you do. Even a movie can be different then reality (shocking I know). Vilociraptors are actually about three feet tall, not six! In any case, think back to the opening scene of Jurassic Park. Roughly fifteen men are all standing around, eyeing a container with very dangerous cargo. We can assume that it houses some kind of dinosaur inside, but we don't know yet. They lock it into place, then open the container's door. No exposition is given, we don't know anything about these character's, nothing. All we know is that whatever is in that container is something we don't want to meet face to face, and is dangerous enough to warrant fifteen men with shock poles to prevent an escape. Suddenly, the creature manages to free the container loose, causing the man who opened the door to fall half in and half out of the container. The creature grabs hold, and he begins to yell in fear, grabbing anything he can to prevent himself from being pulled inside with the monstrosity. Technically, we all know what's inside, but no one says it. Everyone scurries about, trying to shock the creature into submission, but none of it works. One of the later recognizable characters is Robert Muldoon. He grabs onto the man, desperately trying to pull him free of the animal's grip. The last shot is of the man's hand, slowly being pulled through Muldoon's hold, and Muldoon yelling ""shoooock heeeeer!"" ""shooooock heeeeeer!""

Now, you're thinking, ""okay, but what does that have to do with mystery?"" Everything. We never saw the creature, but all we know is that she is terrifyingly dangerous. This built unimaginable tension, which was all but gone in this new film. What we don't know about this animal is it's capabilities. It's a great opening scene as it hooks you in, curious to know more about the animal, yet know before hand that she is dangerous beyond anything you can imagine. Indominus Rex is so powerful, I never questioned what she was capable of. There was no mystery. In fact, the best part of the movie for me, the best scene of the entire film, was when the owner of the park is visiting the new dinosaur for the first time. It's near silent. You never see the creature, only slight movements. All you get from the creature is represented in the owner's face. He is genuinely terrified, shocked, surprised, horrified. By this point we really know nothing about the dinosaur, except that she is dangerous beyond anything else they have made in the park. In one of the better lines, the girl scientist Claire asks ""Do you think that it'll scare the kids?"" and he responds without looking ""Scare the kids... Why.... this would give adults nightmares."" Now see that is a great tension builder, and it is what was needed in Jurassic World for it to be an Academy Award winning and critically acclaimed movie. Mystery and tension goes hand in hand in the Jurassic Park, yet are virtually non-existent in Jurassic World. Another example of this in the original movie are the silent booms from the T-Rex's steps it makes. The kids watch the water, which shakes at each step. Or when the children are at the dinner table, and their jello moves slightly at the steps of the raptors. They turn around, and you see the silhouette of the raptor's moving slowly past the tapestry. Your heart starts to beat faster as this happens, and it's scenes like these that gave me nightmares later that night... nightmares I enjoy remembering when I wake up.

In the end, everything else is forgivable: the music, the cliches, the plot holes, all of it, so long as the magic from the original movie, the mystery and tension it had, was there. But it wasn't. What we got was more of a Godzilla sized film, and less of a Jurassic one.

Watch ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf"" or ""Child 44"" or ""Out of Africa.""  But leave my dinos alone.

For me, in these movies, people make for a target rich environment.

I just bought a brand-new blu-ray player (literally today) and it is telling me that this is a FAKE COPY and refuses to play the audio.  Do not waste your money - buy a legit version.  Not sure why Amazon is selling this, but I guess by the time you pay your money and get what you think is a legitimate DVD it's too late?

Instead of letting the T. Rex loose, the smart thing would be to go into the T. Rex area and *close the door behind you.*

If the door is strong enough to keep the T. Rex in, it's probably strong enough to keep the other dinosaur *out*.

You might get chased by the T. Tex, but that was going to happen anyway if you set it loose, and at least you'd be running from one dinosaur instead of two.",1468972800,,537,4.144230769230769

It features a human dinosaur trainer who serves as something like the military Team Leader of several dinosaurs.  Of course, his ability to lead these dinosaurs and react like a true leader when they abandon him for an Alpha reptile, allows him to save the world (or at least a significant portion of it) from destruction.

As is common in Hollywood movies about the military, the military is shown as too self-important and careless to be the proper custodians of a world where the greatest threats to the planet are climate change and capitalists, rather than kinetic enemies.",1468540800,,766,4.876923076923077

It makes many pokes at the original movie while giving some backstory throughout the movie.

6688734,3,B00NYC65M8,"I was like 4yrs old when the first Jurassic Park came out, and I still remember the excitement of seeing the T Rex for the first time on the huge screen at the drive in. All the kids went nuts. I loved that movie. My friend and I played with the toys, and played the video game on the Sega Genesis. Jurassic Park was a big part of my childhood. I saw the second one in theaters too and loved it as well (though now that I'm older and wiser, its not all that great, but still enjoyable), and I also saw the third one when I was 12, but wasn't very impressed. So after all these years hearing that they were going to make a fourth, I was kinda excited. Maybe, just maybe, after making a bunch of disapointing sequals, they could recapture the magic of the first one.

Nope, this one sucks.

This is all action and special effects with no substance. Instead of a intelligent story with compelling characters, we are treated to a week plot with characters thay are lame and cliche.  One of the main characters runs from dinosaurs in high heels no problem, and doesnt serve much more purpose than sex appeal. Chris Pratt is your typical movie tough guy who happens to be a raptor trainer, which is just stupid. I mean, in the other movies raptors were cunning, vicious creatures that inspired terror. In this one they are relegated to the status of pet dog. Also, in the third movie the Spinosaurus made quick work of the T Rex, but in this one T Rex holds his own against super dinosaur Indomitus Rex. Huh? The raptors get in on the fight, and after the demise of Indomitus Rex, the T Rex looks at the raptor for a few seconds as if to say ""Thanks bro"" and goes its seperate way. Who wrote this crap? The presmise of the movie doesn't even make sense. People are getting tired of the dinosaurs, so they make Indomitus Rex to bring back the crowds. People don't get tired of zoos, why would they get bored with something as exciting as dinosaurs? About the only thing I liked about this movie was the throwbacks to the first one.

Its watchable as mindless popcorn entertainment, but nothing great. Just save your time and money on this cgi fest, and watch the first one.",1467072000,,2166,4.340740740740741

The only thing keeping me from giving it a perfect rating Is the lack of the surviving raptor at the end, i mean s***, The raptors were more interesting and more fleshed out than most of the characters. I'm not saying the ending was bad by any means, I'm just saying Chris Pratt definitely should have kept Blue as a lap dog or some s***.",1467072000,,360,4.1571428571428575

I am a child of Jurassic Park, I grew up being totally enamored with that movie...but I just felt like Jurassic World took it to a whole new level. Maybe I'm the type of consumer that caused the need for the Indominus Rex but this one just felt bigger and badder, with more teeth. Chris Pratt's wit is funny, the budding romance between he and Claire is cute, the back story with the young boys is sweet, and the dinosaurs are fierce and clever.

I was very skeptical at first about this movie and the trailers and how they indicated that they made up a new dinosaur and for that reason I did not see it in theaters. However, I did rent it from Amazon to see what all the hype and billion dollar earnings was all about and I was BLOWN AWAY!!! This movie is amazing the CGI, acting, storyline, its all great and Chris Pratt is fabulous. Since renting it on amazon I have probably watched it no less than 20 times. Its a great, great movie and much better than prior sequels. A must watch!!",1465948800,2,571,4.1909090909090905

6688860,2,B00NYC65M8,"Low sound comes out awful right from the beginning--starting with the movie trailers--usually movie trailers come out extra loud & strong, but not in this time!--first time ever.  I had to higher the sound over 80 & beyond even with the movie.  This is not a TV issue--see my review of my brand new TV, but it is a problem with the manufacturing of the DVD & interface--they probably use some software to do the sound or something.  I got this at Walmart, but the quality is the same as if I had bought it at Amazon.  I was disappointed with the quality of the pictures themselves.  Close-ups are great, but background people were not that crystal clear.  The main character woman in high heels that is expected to be on the field many times is plain ridiculous!  She should have been wearing slacks & boots & a safari hat at the very least.  She's always on her cell phone!  Don't we have more than enough people attached to their cell phones?  I believe they didn't put much effort into this movie or production or something went wrong--who knows.  I am not talking about the effort in the art/technology for the critters, no!  Just the movie.  Too much gunfire at the poor giant critters--leave it up to the dinosaurs to eat a few people, but it is not necessary to have a Godzilla type movie--too much human violence.  I don't get disappointed often, but I did get disappointed with this movie. I had to higher the volume to almost 100 & it still wasn't enough.  When there was lots of action, I could lower the volume to normal range.  What a ripoff!  So frustrated so frustrated!  I liked the idea of a fake shark.  That I liked very much instead of the real cow in the original.  That was my only complaint in the original move.  Only one.  I still choose Lost World as my second favorite to the original Jurassic Park.  Can't you manufacturers get it right with the production of quality sound?  I am so sick & tired of this interface!

The sci fi movie ""Dune"" came in so strong, I had to lower the volume of my TV to 30 all the way thru!  Good grief!  Sorry I invested $20!

Many people have sound bars, but that shouldn't be the answer.  Good quality manufacturing at the beginning is what is needed!",1465776000,,2210,4.400990099009901

Again, there may be a color code that lets you know who will be eaten and who will escape. This was also a very male oriented movie.

6688960,4,B00NYC65M8,"When I learned that yet another 'Jurassic Park' sequel was being released, I couldn't resist a nonchalant eye roll.  Hasn't this franchise been exhausted already?  How many times can we watch characters run (screaming) from out-of-control technology?  I made it a point not to darken the door when JURASSIC WORLD made its theatrical run.

But then I caught this film on cable.  Oh what nonstop, hair-raising fun!  With a cast anchored by relatively unknowns Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard (wolf howl)--with the only cast member from the original being BD Wong as Dr. Henry Wu--JURASSIC WORLD is a roller coaster ride of thrills and chills, as a genetically engineered ""mega"" dinosaur escapes from captivity and wreaks havoc on the JURASSIC WORLD high-tech theme park.  And I really liked the respectful homage this film pays to the original in the franchise--particularly when the two young nephews stumble across the original Jurassic Park resort, now in its third decade of decay.  That's vintage Steven Spielberg!

The special effects are amazing, as dinosaurs of land, sea, and air are brought to spectacular life, and the action and suspense start early and stay on the gas throughout.  Maybe the franchise needed a twenty-plus years hiatus to recharge its batteries; JURASSIC WORLD serves notice that running for one's life from terrifying dinosaurs can still be one terrific ride.

It couldn't even finish the disk, so quite honestly I'm not sure what I paid for.

The two main characters clearly have nothing in common and they have gone for the common trope of ""rebel, bad boy meets uptight good girl, and she loosens up so they fall in love."" YAWN. The parents' marital troubles are randomly brought up mid movie and don't further the plot at all and could have been skipped entirely without changing the movie. If you can skip this, skip it. If your kids are making you watch it, make it a drinking game and it will probably be better. Also at the time of writing this, it is available on HBO go.",1464652800,2,610,4.267241379310345

6689031,5,B00NYC65M8,"This is a fair and interesting sequel to Jurassic Park. The premise is surprising, but logical. The acting is excellent, the script high quality, and the direction is right on. It is amazing to see how much special effects have changed and improved in twenty years. People like Steven Spielberg advanced the art with their first movies (think Jaws) and the industry has done it's best to push the envelope to beyond what was expected. If Jurassic World 2 is as good as this film, it will be well worth seeing. Jurassic Park was followed by The Lost World, a poor sequel at best. Jurassic Park III was only slightly better than The Lost World. Let's hope this new set of films will continue the initial high standard. The PG 13 rating is a good one. Young children would be frightened.",1463961600,3,784,4.567375886524823

6689043,5,B00NYC65M8,"I love this movie so much that I have to force myself not to watch it every day.  The depiction of the dinosaurs gets better and better in these movies.  The two main characters, Chris Pratt, and Bryce Dallas Howard truly shine; their relationship blossoms realistically, slowly, and almost by surprise.  The real stars here are the two young nephews of Howard's character.  The older brother is dismissive of his younger brother, but as they are exposed to increasing peril that they have to work out for themselves, it is wonderful to see the older brother start to have real feeling for his little brother.  The dinosaurs are great, very realistic, except I think the raptors are a tad too friendly.  Seeing Vincent D'Onofrio in this movie was a nice surprise.  He is a good actor, and I have always admired his work.  This is a good one, don't pass it by.",1463961600,,859,4.605263157894737
6689044,4,B00NYC65M8,"Believe it or not haters, this was the 4th highest grossing film of all time (adjusted for inflation) raking in $1.66 Billion!  My wife and I loved the original and the book by Michael Crichton.  Sequels two and three weren't nearly as engaging.  So, when this sequel appeared last year 22 years after the original I was skeptical.  Well, the good news is that this a pretty watchable popcorn movie, lots of action, amazing CGI/FX, and an interesting enough story to keep you going.  The director could have used Chris Pratt better, he's got great comedic chops (as proved in ""Parks & Recreation"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"") and the original JP had some humorous moments but here Pratt plays it straight.  His Owen character is a Navy vet turned dino-whisperer who's trained the dreaded velociraptors of the earlier films to follow his lead.  The new park leadership keep trying to boost tourist interest now that (like the space program) people have become jaded by seeing the same old dino's again and again.  So, they invent a genetic mutant super dino, the Indominous Rex, with powers and intellect nobody predicted...what could go wrong?!  Bryce Dallas Howard is the other lead, she's Claire, a corporate bureaucrat who's only focused on the bottom line.  When her two young nephews come to visit the park she pawns them off on a self absorbed personal assistant.  No surprise the kids go missing right when the Indominous breaks out.  She's got a stylish haircut Rachel would have loved on ""Friends"" a few decades back and runs around the jungle in a white gauzy outfit that looks terrific but takes almost the whole movie to get dirty and torn.  The issue of her wearing heels has been much discussed but made sense for her role; still I wound up liking her by the end.  Overall it's an entertaining journey despite some silly moments (how the kids find, fix up an old jeep from the original park to include a working battery, and drive a stick shift even though the oldest doesn't even have a driver's license yet) that shouldn't dampen one's enjoyment.",1463875200,,2064,4.76123595505618

6689046,5,B00NYC65M8,"Bought to go with my Jurassic Park Ultimate Trilogy... No doubt next year that will come out with a 4 pack!  In any case, I know that ""world"" got panned in reviews, but I really liked it.  The some of the special effects were awesome - my fav the clear balls you ride around in, in the park.  Wished I were in it.  Until the bad dinosaur got loose of course... It's worth owning if you own the others.. I happen to be a brice howard fan and she was very funny in this movie.  Just my humble opinion... but then I am not a movie reviewer, just a movie watcher.  I would say that these movies are good for 8-10 years old and older... there is quite a lot of scary violence... a few words...but no sex or nudity.  Too busy trying to survive the escaped dinosaurs to think about a roll in the hay.  :)",1463875200,25,797,4.031847133757962

Different than I expected... I saw it in 3D opening night & the nods to the original... omg we were all cheering... hell the end had me in tears.

6689069,2,B00NYC65M8,"What a crap movie. I think I've seen the other three and although average I never remembered the other three being as lame as this one. Talk about style over substance, I wasn't sure CGI had regressed over the past 20 years but clearly it has this looked like a video game.

 The storyline is so weak I wanted to turn it off after 20 minutes. No, Indominus Rex isn't interesting nor are the crappy reasons for creating it. The writing is just terrible like a hodge podge of music video ideas spliced together and the acting so wooden from all involved if I didn't know any better I would've assumed this movie would've flopped at the box office. Whoever was in charge of the marketing campaign of this deserves a significant raise.

 Aside from an 'okay at least not terrible ending' pretty much all this had going for it was staring in fascination at how fat Vincent D'Onofrio has gotten he's clearly eaten one too many velociraptors.",1463702400,,935,4.5476190476190474

Also, the movie is creepily sexist. It's so blatant that the kids I took to see it noticed. For example, the female lead runs around in high-heeled shoes (outrunning dinosaurs too!) throughout the whole movie.
It's also scientifically inaccurate to the point even kids notice it.

The disaster destined park has opened again, and an all business PR woman has agreed to let her sisters kids spend some time with her at the park to see all the dinosaurs and exhibits. Apparently, she did not see the other films. Badump-pish. They have a new exhibit- a genetically engineered Dinosaur. I was not at all surprised when it escaped, and now its up to a trainer who has been working with a group of raptors since they hatched to save her, the kids, and the park. But you haven't seen it all yet.
Although you can see it coming a mile away, the action still delivers and the twist at the end was fantastic. The best of the series since the first film. Definitely worth getting.",1462233600,2,750,4.522058823529412
6689220,2,B00NYC65M8,"Overhyped. I was looking forward to this for a long time before I saw it in theaters. So much so that I fangirled and bought the shirt and wore it to the premiere. I've never done that before, and did it in spite of JP3. I still remember the fear I felt during the kitchen scene of the first film as a little girl. The first film was one of the greats.

In this reboot, the plot had too many holes, the characters had no depth. Since we've seen all there is to see with dinosaurs, characterization and human interest has to grab our interest. Why do you think Marvel does pretty well with superhero movies?  They've learned the value of a human interest story, and they're playing that angle. They know that you can't substitute cgi for everything else.

The raptors that lunged at Starlord (great characterization, successful movie) the day before now miraculously trot by his motorcyle, now tame hunters???

Female protagonist out runs dinosaur???? IN HIGH HEELS???

Cardboard child stereotypes with shaky acting ability?? Cardboard/ weak/ underdeveloped antagonist....

I was disappointed about halfway through the film, and so was the person with me. Sure, it's just a movie. But I don't think it gave homage to the first.

When I found out this director is getting the reigns for the next star wars in 2017, I knew I wouldn't be seeing the film on opening day, if ever.",1462233600,,1374,4.676348547717843

6689310,3,B00NYC65M8,"Just like the Galatic Empire with its fatal obsession with Death Stars, so too the owners of the Jurassic dinosaur DNA continue fatefully building theme parks. This particular incarnation sees the dinosaurs genetically enhanced, partly to create bigger, more dangerous, more compelling attractions and partly to create weapons for the army. Unsurprisingly, it goes wrong and the humans in the complex are in deadly peril  again. Look, dinosaurs are always awesome. It seems hard to believe that the first film (and brilliant concept) has been around so long. It truly was groundbreaking. This effort has some interesting features but it is largely a remake of the first, without the wow factor. Indeed, those first dinosaur representations appeared to be better? Its certainly serviceable but aside from introducing the concept to a new audience, it doesnt invite a repeat viewing. 3  stars.",1461456000,,891,5.3120567375886525

The filmmakers didn't even attempt to make it believable (at all!). The dialog was horrendous. The plot was nonexistent. Because of the direction and dialog the acting was annoyingly over and under done and ultimately insulting to the viewer.

6689321,3,B00NYC65M8,"I don't have to write a long review because in a couple days my review will be pushed far enough away due to the staggering amount of reviews for Jurassic World being submitted everyday, so nobody will read it anyway. I'll just say I felt Jurassic World didn't quite live up to the hype.

The complaints are true that it doesn't look like the dinosaurs are really chasing after the characters.  I figured with today's technology a more realistic representation of a chase between the dinosaurs and the humans would occur but rather surprisingly, the dinos in Jurassic Park look just as realistic if not more so.  Remember in the early 90's watching Jurassic Park for the first time?  We all thought these kind of amazing effects were the wave of the future, and technology would only continue to make dinos look more impressive.  Over 20 years later and... not really.  At least not according to this film.  A little disappointing there.

Really odd decision to have Vincent D'Onoforio of Law & Order fame play the arrogant meanie who wants to wipe the dinosaurs out in vicious style.  Never seen him portray such a character before!  He even changed his looks (or maybe he's just getting old).

The storyline makes us initially think it's going to be about the two teenage brothers (Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins) alone in a forest and battling/running away from dinosaurs (the older one can't stop looking at girls by the way- seriously younger bro, slap some sense into him!) but actually it's more about Chris Pratt's heroic and tough character with the help of the two teenage boys aunt (Bryce Dallas Howard) trying to stop the humongous dinosaur from killing thousands of people.  The aunt's in charge of the biggest dinosaur in existence- the indominus rex, created genetically by combining multiple species and trapped in a high-walled enclosed area.  One day he suddenly break free by using his brain, which makes him more advanced than the other dinosaurs.  It's up to Chris and Bryce to make sure the huge dino doesn't end up attacking the thousands of people attending the luxury resort called Jurassic World.

Some of this stuff is rather odd such as the two teenage boys in a protective glass ball rolling through fields as a way to admire the dinosaurs.  Love when they encounter the indominus rex and how the rex reacts to the boys inside the ball by crushing it.  Also some of this stuff is rather violent!  Not at all appropriate for children.  First of all there's some sex jokes when Bryce first meets Chris which should have been omitted.  But also when the pterodactyls are freed and fly around Jurassic World scooping up people and flinging them around like insects.  REALLY creepy!  This is what nightmares are made of.

At least watching the smaller dinosaurs communicate with Chris' character is interesting because we're never sure if they're going to turn on Chris (who's been spending a long time training them) or not.  Also whenever the dinosaurs attack each other, or when people are brought in to try and stop the big rex- these are fun action scenes.  The big rex's special camouflage abilities and smarts to sneak around and detect people by picking up on their heat signatures makes bringing him down a rather difficult challenge.  So the movie has its moments.  We'll just ignore the cliche of the two teenage boys having to jump off a cliff and into the water to avoid the big rex's huge bite.  Yeah we all saw this obvious one coming!

Otherwise this movie's okay.  I realize it drew humongous numbers at the box office on its opening weekend, and that it's considered one of the biggest movies of 2015 if not of all-time.  Pretty big achievement.  But quality-wise, I think I prefer the first Jurassic Park.  Jurassic Park told a better story if you ask me, and the suspense factor was higher.  The storytelling was better too.  In Jurassic World the suspense felt somewhat watered down perhaps because we knew what to expect, and what kind of action it would have because there's not really a lot more you can do with giant killer dinosaurs.  The story was told decently in the beginning but nothing really amazing.  The CGI dinosaur appearances are a lot like the ones used in King Kong.  I'd like to give this movie 4 stars but I expected more given its popularity.",1461369600,,4308,4.732885906040268
6689322,2,B00NYC65M8,"Once again we have children in danger of being eaten. Even though Spielberg had little to do with this one, it still hews to the standard Spielbergian formula. It's got better production values and the acting is perfectly fine. But other than an occasional good line, there are no surprises. Once again we have kids in a small vehicle under assault by a dinosaur who's somehow escaped her paddock. It's OK for a Saturday night at home, but you'll forget it as soon as it's over. As far as franchise reboots go, it's much better than the execrable Star Wars: The Farce Awakens. But they should have left it alone.

6689328,5,B00NYC65M8,"Finally a movie with Dinosaurs that is holds all the excitement as the first one from my own childhood! I remember the first time Jurassic Park hit theaters..... my siblings and I went to see it over and over again. It then hit the dollar theaters and we spent near a week straight in the front row of that theater enjoying the loud amazing T-Rex seemingly come to life, and eat a man of the toilet!

 I wanted that awesomeness for my own children and we finally got it. They adore Jurassic World, the wonder, the love of science, the understanding of corporations putting money before safety, and the sheer fantastic depictions of animals long past and some that only exist in fiction but ""could be"" if someone was stupid enough to make such a creature. You can't tell me if they brought back a T-Rex that you would get a ticket to see it!

 I think the plot is over all believable and very well done. It made some of my kids scared..... not just the dinosaurs either. The idea of parents getting divorced! My kids are homeschooled and it isn't very common in our communities. No we are not religious nutters, we are a military family that moves a love and knows the kids educations would be in tatters others wise. We have a deep love of science. Still, I will admit, our kids are some what sheltered from those with ""poor social skills"" and things like divorce, it is a rare topic for them. I am glad this movie brought it up as too many kids face it and it is truly something we can all fear in a very real way. Thankfully it was a chance to remind the kids how solid we all are.

 Anyway, this movie to me could hardly have been better. Don't ask me how a woman runs in heels, heck, I can't explain how they walk in them personally. There are other issues and I can see why some people don't adore the movie but it gave my kids the thrill the first movie gave me and I am thankful.

Pretty interesting in 3D... if you are the lucky owner of a DLP projector... the only home video display type I've ever seen that produces 3D perfectly over the entire length of a movie.

6689350,5,B00NYC65M8,"I found this movie to be thoroughly entertaining and the premise invites discussion about ethical science and what man's relationship with nature is and/or should be. I also liked the character arcs of the brothers and the messages about family were generally positive. At the same time, it's a movie about dinosaurs. And it's the 4th movie in the series.

6689356,5,B00NYC65M8,It's a great movie. A little different from the others because of the hybrid man made dino and the end was weird with the dinosaur fight but it's action pack with a slight bit of humor.,1461110400,,185,4.166666666666667
6689357,5,B00NYC65M8,Great movie! Full of the usual dinosaur goodness and mayhem and wonder. They even ret-con a little sense into the inaccuracy of the dinosaurs. Chris Pratt the velociraptor wrangler is not to be missed!,1461110400,,201,4.9411764705882355

6689368,1,B00NYC65M8,"Terrible, where to begin, Owen, the zoo keeper equivalent was not aware of a 6 story secret dinosaur only feet from his office.  Claire the lead female was dressed for work in high heels then felt compelled to run through the jungle in those things.  Never broke a heel.  Patrons can be seen aimlessly wandering around this theme park with apparently no where to go.  These and many other inconsistencies and phony scenarios made this film hard to sit through and at the end when you though it might get better...  I felt that I wasted 2 hours of my life.

6689388,4,B00NYC65M8,"I was a bit worried after watching a bit of Jurassic World, as the movie makes the unfortunate choice of relying on characters who are written to be stupid in order to get things going. That said, the movie does manage to be very entertaining once things really get going, with some of the action that occurs late in the movie being pretty intense, albeit very stupid in the best way possible. It's not as good as the original, but it's a hell of a lot better than any of the other movies in the series.",1461024000,,503,4.25

6689394,3,B00NYC65M8,"Just watched it via iTunes. Not bad, but the story was not very creative regarding character development, dialogue or story/plot. It's basically a lazy rehash with a few new twists. For me this franchise has become, or always has been a vehicle for great special effects; dinosaur designs and animations etc. So it has that in spades, the visuals of this movie are top quality for modern CG but the story just isn't in depth enough and by the end of the movie it feels a little empty.

I've noticed some people really hated the concept of training the raptors, but if you think about it it's not much more advanced than trying a pack of hunting dogs. I'd place it above Jurassic Park 3, but barely. It actually had some nice new ideas going for it, mainly the lead character using his trained raptors as a team with the alpha leader, they could have utilized that with some cool sequences other than what they did.",1460851200,,914,4.506024096385542

I saw this movie in the theaters when it came out and I just had to have my own personal copy as this is a movie I can watch over, and over very easily and I have already as I have also rented it on Net flix too. I really recommend this movie to anyone who is considering purchasing it; it will keep you entertained throughout the whole movie!!!",1460764800,,435,4.069767441860465

6689402,4,B00NYC65M8,"As a huge Jurassic park fan I was so excited to see this movie (didn't hurt that Chris Pratt was in in it either ). I was unable to make it to the theaters to see it, but it was definitely worth the wait to be able to purchase it via Amazon. It was nice to see John Hammonds dream portrayed in the original Jurassic park finally happen. Seeing the Park in its full glory ,full of people, all the amazing and terrifying dinosaurs on display really showed the potential the park had but never got to realize in JP1. This movie is full of twist and plots that keep you wondering. Though I really liked the movie I was a bit disappointed in the ""NEW"" dinosaur. Seeing the previews I thought he/she was going to be a lot scarier. Though some of its abilities are new and scary  it still felt like an over pumped up T-rex.  All and all I really enjoyed this movie and was not overly disappointed when I finally got to see it.
I bought this movie at full price with no intent on giving a review. I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in purchasing it.",1460678400,,1056,4.197044334975369
6689403,5,B00NYC65M8,"So many years later, we pick up the theme again. This time, there's no mention of the former disasters, except in terms of ""we know what we're doing this time,"" and no cameos by former cast members. Dino cloning is now a business, commercialized and treated like any other commodity...give 'em bigger and better models every year.

Of course it all backfires...and total mayhem ensues.  In this one, the velociraptors get a change to be the halfway ""good guys"" as they follow their human alpha in pursuit of an escape super-dinosaur wanting human h'ors doerves. There are sea-dwelling giants as well. One shot of a mosasaur leaping out the water, dolphin-style, to seize a pterodactyl who has a human in its beak, is...WOW!!!

As usual, the kids in the show are almost more resourceful than their adult counterparts. The romance between the two leads is cute but not distracting.

The final scene sums up the entire four movies: Keep trying puny humans. You can't keep a good dino down!

(I'm still waiting to find out where those pterodactyls from Jurassic Park III landed. Hey, Amblin Enterntainment!  NOTE: Danger doesn't have to come from the ground.)

What aggravated me about the movie is they took many of the plot elements from the first book that were left out of the movie and added them to this one.  The product placement was in no way subtle and the plot.... oh that poor plot.  I hope they find the person who poked all those holes in it.

Chris Pratt basically just did the same thing he does in movies it seems.  He is the dorky manly guy who comes to save you.

and unless you are daft not paying attention or under the age of 10 you see the end coming a mile away.

save your money until it is on prime.",1459382400,,724,3.8513513513513513

6689556,3,B00NYC65M8,"A dinosaur movie isn't exactly made to appeal to critical thinking. Even knowing that most of these creatures were from the Cretaceous period, had feathers and didn't actually live at the same time period, the most difficult thing to digest is that they act like cartoons. At some points in the movie you can figure out what they are saying or trying to communicate. It's a pretty silly device to make the plot move on and it shows how weak the whole story is compared to the thrills of the original movie. Just like the main dinosaur villain in the movie, Jurassic World is just bigger, more expensive and created exclusively to attract new costumers. It goes out of control and ends up killing its audience.",1459209600,,709,4.634920634920635

Don't think it quite measures up to the first Jurassic Park but easily in the running with the other two.  Found some of the scenes somewhat predictable but then again that might come from having the first three movies of the JP series several times.  I would definitely recommend it.

6689768,4,B00NYC65M8,"I found this entertaining and fun.  If you're a fan of all of the Jurassic Park movies without the obvious criticisms, then you'll enjoy this.  It's a popcorn blockbuster flick and not intended to be an intellectual piece, otherwise you'll find that you're picking at every little line that is uttered.  The most apparent criticism would be who in their right mind would think that creating an amusement park full of real Dinosaurs is a smart idea.  Once you get past that reality check and accept this to be a Hollywood fantasy, then sit back and enjoy the adventurous spectacle without judgment.  It doesn't compare to the first Jurassic Park movie, but none of the sequels do.",1457308800,,679,4.769230769230769

It was full of action and had me on the edge of my seat. You really didn't have to see any of the Jurassic Park movies to be able to follow this movie, even though it did have some referrals to the old movie in it. It is about a new age park with dinosaurs, which two brothers are sent to, to visit with their Aunt who works there. Things get out of hand when people get greedy trying to create a hybrid dinosaur. Chris Pratt is a trainer and does a great job. I would highly recommend this movie to any Jurassic Park fan or someone who likes action movies.",1457308800,,725,4.112676056338028

As long as you enjoy it at the surface and don't look too deep, it's a great movie. It doesn't hurt that Chris Pratt is in it and pleasing to the eye. Ron Howard's daughter does a good job as well.

6689853,4,B00NYC65M8,"As a really big JP fan and a newly established JW fan I decided to check out this set. Personally I really like it. The figures are really well made and would be great for any collection, The Indominus sculpt looks really really nice and detailed, along with Rexy, scars and all. The circle container for the DVDs (that I've seen EVERYONE complain about) isn't actually that bad in my opinion. Yes it doesn't line up well with other cases on a shelf. I have mine on the card board stand with the figures on either side as a little display type of deal. The certificate is nice, though I wish it was numbered, but I can't complain. All in all I really like it, I do collect JP/JW stuff so it is a welcome edition.",1456876800,,712,4.242647058823529

I was a bit worried it would delve too far into a romance, or have too much drama. Fortunately it really didn't, and even if it had there was plenty of incredible action to make up for it.

The dinosaurs were awesome, which is really the big importance. Definitely worth a watch if you're a fan of the originals, or curious about it at all",1456531200,,557,4.245283018867925

6690047,5,B00NYC65M8,"When I realized how much I was rooting for the raptors and t-Rex, I said this movie is amazing. I knew that before hand but feeling the way I did when blue got slammed my Indominous Rex just sealed it for me. Everything they lay on you concerning the raptors works entirely. For me I recall them communicating in part 3 I think. In one of the sequels it was said that if not for the dinosaurs extinction the velociraptor may have evolved to become the dominant species on the planet. So knowing all that and seeing how they are used in this movie just adds so much to it.
Here is my biggest thumbs up though. The movie took time to explain things. For example, they mention Indominous' captivity, his relationship to the crane that delivers food. All that could have been left out and it would have changed the dynamic of the new Rex entirely. And not in a good way.

The acting was great. Bryce Dallas Howard runs around in high heels all movie, and T. rex is still king.",1455753600,,972,4.311475409836065

From the opening scenes to the epic nod to the original in the ending climax this movie kept me on the edge of my seat. Chris Pratt was masterful, truly embodying his character and the spirit of Jurassic Park. While the romantic portion of the film felt a little hurried and thrown together I really hardly noticed as I was too busy watching the masterful CGI & action sequences. The cinematography was without flaw, the CGI blended seamlessly with the live action and aside from the romance the story-line was very engaging and really drew me into the world.

Cardboard cut out characters with as much depth and charm as a cardboard are never ever truly in danger, and you know it. I'm not sure I can even remember any of them. Not even the Starlord. Oh, not that movie? Well, I am more inclined to believe that sheer fun coolness of Chris Pratt himself would be enough to tame those raptors in real life. At the very least, that guy IS fun, laid back and smart and they should have just called him Chris. The character he plays, well, Indiana Jones did it before... Ultimately, you don't care what happens to anyone or anything.

Hard to even comment on the story or anything else since there isn't much of it. Not to mention the stupidity of the formulaic plot devices. Shouldn't have happened. Any of it. Success based on nostalgia rather than anything seen in this movie.

6690135,1,B00NYC65M8,"DO NOT LET THE BOX OFFICE FOOL YOU, AVOID THIS MOVIE. This may sound stupid, but I hated everything in this movie except the dinosaurs. Every character in this film is an absolute moron. And every plot line is forced. There is a love angle that has no logical reason or romance to it and even less chemistry. There is another plot line with the two children in the movie and their parents. I won't say what it is, but it's obvious. It's mostly there to make you care for two kids who are given nothing to do otherwise to get to know their characters. They are nothing more than audience avatars. Vincent D'onofrio's entire inclusion in this film had no purpose. Before that, he is giving you hints to one of the stupidest ""let's militarize it!"" plots lines I've ever seen. Bryce Dallas Howard's character should have been eaten alive twice. I won't say what those moments are exactly, but this movie would have been better off with her character's death being a rallying point for the survivors. And saved the viewers from that awful romantic angle. I am a massive Chris Pratt fan, but his character is a tool in this movie. For the most part he was not given much character. What we do know is that he knows all sorts of things about raptors. Except how to spot one. One of the biggest plot lines in this movie is what animals is this newly man-made dinosaur made with. And it isn't just dinosaurs. When you see the creature dubbed Indominous Rex the first time you immediately can tell he is part T-Rex and part one other dinosaur. That other, very obvious, specific dinosaur is a major plot point in this movie. Why can I, the guy who knows very little about dinosaurs, figure out what that animal is and Chris Pratt the raptor expert can't? This movie's script and plot lines make every character look stupid. To the dinosaurs. They are the only reason this movie gets one star. I know I can't give zero stars, but I would have tried my best to make it clear if it wasn't for these dinosaurs. Their fight scenes were awesome. At a certain point the fight is dinosaurs only. And that is the best part of the movie. When the human characters are not involved at all. This movie would have been better if the scientists placed an Indominous Rex on the island to take out all the other dinosaurs that broke loose. It would be an hour and a half of pure dinosaur rampage. The entire plot line of the Rex being sadistic would still come through and this movie would have been just awesome.

  Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Irrfan Khan, Vincent D'Onofrio
  Colin Trevorrow (Director)

  Yet again we visit the law of unintended consequences, to wit: MORE genetically engineered dinosaurs, plus ANOTHER hubristic theme park creator, plus MORE kids on the loose. What could possibly go wrong  AGAIN? Well, (again) you know the rest. The aforementioned formula, for me, was not as enjoyable the FORTH time around, but it still had its moments. See the other reviews for more detail and/or other opinions of the movie's plot.

VIDEO: 2.00:1  Color  1080p  MPEG-4 AVC (29.7 Mbps)

  The movie's image is reasonably sharp (without any obvious edge-enhancement), has very good contrast and has decent shadow detail (as seen in the dark and shadowy areas, such as the dark control room, the night scenes, and in the dark turtle-neck worn by the B.D. Wong character). Also, fine detail is frequently (though not always) evident in the brighter scenes and in many close-ups. Lastly, there are no obvious artifacts such as specks, white dots, hair-lines or color fluctuations. Overall, this movie's presentation on blu-ray has very good picture quality, and should satisfy all but the pickiest viewers.

AUDIO: DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1

  The sound quality of the DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 soundtrack for this disc, while very good, is NOT amongst the best examples of the art. In fact, in my opinion, it is NOT even as good as the soundtrack of its much older predecessor: Universal's own&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jurassic-Park/dp/B00TPL8DO0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jurassic Park</a>. While dialog is clear and well placed, and the rear and side channels are active and fairly directional  with deep bass that is often present in BOTH the sub-woofer AND the three front channels (and, even on rare occasion in the side and rear channels). It still never gave me that deeply moving 'you-are-there' feeling that I frequently got from listening to Jurassic Park  a movie, might I add, that is twenty-two years older than this movie! Don't get me wrong: this soundtrack is very nice, but it, in my opinion, (particularly after hearing Jurassic Park) could have been better!

6690159,2,B00NYC65M8,"Aaahhhh, I wanted to like it. I mean come on, Jurassic Park was phenomenal, the movie not the book, the book was full of plot holes and hollow characters. But, Speilberg is a master of making his audience aware there is a monster without showing you until the right moment (think Jaws). However, Speilberg was just one of many producers of this atrocity. It saddens me he had any involvement.

This movie failed right from the start. It's as if we're told not to like anyone: the older brother is insensitive and moody, the younger brother is over-sensitive and hyper, Claire is cold and ignorant, the park-goers are bored and want more than just extinct dinosaurs, Henry Wu has turned into a greedy corrupt engineer. I didn't root for anybody except Jimmy Buffet running with two margaritas in his hands from pterodactyls.

I need more from a movie than a pretty boy riding through a swampy jungle on a motorcycle in a pack of raptors, a pretty girl tying her shirt in a knot and running through a swampy jungle in heels, two kids getting a jeep running that's been out of commission for twenty plus years, and military guys salivating over raptors being used as blood hounds.",1455235200,,1177,4.653846153846154

6690193,3,B00NYC65M8,"Twenty years after the failed attempt at opening a dinosaur theme park with actual dinosaurs (in the original Jurassic Park), they've finally developed a thriving attraction, Jurassic World, that draws tens of thousands of people each day. The park is a big hit but it always needs something new, much like any other park that adds new rollercoasters or movie-themed rides. So the scientists and businessmen behind Jurassic World have concocted a new dinosaur to swell the attendance numbers--Indomitus Rex. It's mostly T-Rex with some other genetic material thrown in to make it bigger, scarier, and have ""more teeth."" Investors aren't 100 per cent confident the new dino is safely caged. They have the park's dino-taming expert Owen (Chris Pratt) inspect the pen of I-Rex, which of course isn't sufficient to hold in the creature. Pandemonium ensues with 20,000 tourists on the island, two of which are the nephews of Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), a director of the park who is too organized and busy to show the kids around. She has her assistant keep an eye on them while she deals with park management, including persuading corporate investors to sponsor exhibits. It's a race to reunite family members and keep people from dying.

The movie has some amazing special effects and exciting action sequences. Owen's main job (apparently) is taming raptors which he is pretty good at. The dinosaurs look impressive (no difference between animatronics and CG). Fights between humans and dinos are exciting as are those between the dinosaurs themselves.

Thematically, the movie is all over the place. Owen has a good working relationship with the animals, unlike Claire who looks at them as numbers on a spreadsheet. There's a brief flirtation with an animal rights theme but this movie is a big summer blockbuster that needs to get on with the action. Another character mocks the corporate sponsors of the new exhibit, which is funny until you realize the rest of the film is chock full of product placements, the motion picture equivalent of corporate sponsorship. The scientists are sort of depicted as bad guys, but fade out in the shadow of the ""corporate security"" people (led by Vincent D'Onofrio's character Hoskins) who want to use the dinos for military applications. They are the sort of one-dimensional baddies you expect to see on a poorly written Doctor Who or Star Trek episode. The movie is a big summer blockbuster, so there's no real need for that sort of depth.

I found the movie entertaining but light-wieght. It's like cotton candy--pretty to look at and sweet-tasting but no nutritional value whatsoever. The occasional sweet treat is perfectly fine.",1454976000,,2673,5.070454545454545

6690218,3,B00NYC65M8,"I loved Jurassic ParK and its Sequal the Lost World. I like to pretend the third movie didn't happen. This one I feel was a hell of a lot of missed opportunity. This was more of a commentary on corporate greed than a good movie. Don't get me wrong Jurassic Park is somewhat of a commentary on ""asking if they could"" rather than should but it was put together much more beautifully than this movie. The first movie still gives me an OMG this is amazing feeling, even the second movie makes me feel that its totally cool plus its a good storyline, this movie it lost that effect for me, i neither thought this is cool nor did i think this is amazing. The story line for the most part isn't dissimilar to the original movie. add in corporate greed vs. crazy rich old man doing what he wants because he wants to (granted in the book there was more of that corporate greed issue than the movie which maybe why i prefer the movie much more likable character in the movie). I guess that is my problem with this movie, It added in so much of that corporate greed bull that it took away from what the original made a great story. A crazy rich man deciding to make a theme park of cloned dinosaurs that tremendously backfires due to circumstances he didn't understand and some outside of his control is by far more charming than a corporation that new better but did it anyway to make as much money as possible and leaving most if not all ethical, moral and human responsiblity in the dust especially when it came to creating a new headline with a hybrid super predator. This was part of what irritated me in the last movie. they created a new dinosaur just for the hell of it, and much like the corporation in the movie, the script writer did this for the sake of ratings. After all the audience might be bored with more Trex and Velociraptors being the major problems. There were other dinosaurs that where larger than trex and probably equally as terrifying. after all lost world brought on the compies. and holy moly those things were scary when they attacked the russian guy.

Over all not a bad movie, just not what i was hoping for. I was hoping this recapture the awe of the original or at least make up for the lack of awe with a well written script and story line. The performances were fine. although, i personally could always do with a little Ian Malcom even if its just a little bit.",1454889600,,2387,4.352017937219731

6690221,5,B00NYC65M8,"Somehow, I managed to snag Jurassic World for about $10 here on Amazon, and at that price, this movie is a definite buy, provided: A) you like the original Jurassic Park, and B) you aren't expecting a Shawshank Redemption-level film here. For me, it's just a fun, eye-candy kind of movie.

That said, I did get a bit more than I'd bargained for; specifically, the version of the Blu-Ray that I expected at the $10 price (which, as I write this, is no longer available), was the Blu-Ray-only version (third option under ""Additional Blu-Ray options"" *after* you select the ""Blu-Ray"" box), but in reality, I somehow got the version that's Blu-Ray + DVD + Digital HD. I'm not complaining, of course - it was actually a nice surprise - but I'm just describing it here so that people are aware that Amazon may have their SKUs a bit mixed up here.",1454889600,,840,4.562913907284768

6690240,4,B00NYC65M8,"When I saw the trailers, I thought 'Dear God, not another Jursassic movie'...especially because in the ending of the original book, the island was destroyed...but this one was really entertaining.  That first movie/book gave me nightmares and I still think about it (and the original Godzilla movies) when I'm in crowded areas or stuck in stand-still traffic 'What if a dinosaur came busting through here?  What are my escape routes?'

I could have done without Bryce Dallas Howard's character.  She really didn't do much to add value and the romantic story seemed a silly waste/add-on to a move that didn't need it.  Was this a ploy to maintain a date's interest in the movie?  There's enough going on that it wasn't necessary.  And I was distracted by her shoes and clothing.  Skinny kitten heels wouldn't last two minutes under those conditions, but somehow she kept going.  And her silk shirt never got a single run.  Her clich reactions and behaviors were pointless.  And she made me feel uncomfortable- and stupid that I'd have kept boots, hiking pants, and shirts that wick in my trunk for these occasions if I worked on this island. But now I know I could wear a ball gown and the worst that could happen is a little mud.

It was a hard thing for me to deal with the rex getting out of its pen.  It was pretty lame as to how that happened.  Plus, you could immediately tell who would get killed.  Like the folks wearing red shirts in Star Trek, they were really obvious.  But if you forgive all of this and go with it, the story was entertaining.

I'm a big dog lover, so of course the loyalty of Blue got to me.  I almost wanted a velociraptor to take home, feed it treats, and cuddle with it on the couch.  I have dogs and cats that it probably would have eaten and there was also the issue of it stalking me in the dark, so that would not have worked out.  Of course, the whole time I'm thinking 'I'd NEVER take my kids to a park like this no matter what' and kept asking my husband 'Who in their right mind would take their children to something like this?  That's so STUPID'.  But, again, go with it and you'll have fun.",1454716800,,2133,4.415384615384616

I miss Jeff Goldblum although Chris Pratt, Vincent D'Onofrio and B.D. Wong were okay in the movie. I wish Wong had more of a part.

6690396,2,B00NYC65M8,"I don't understand why so many have rated this movie so highly. The storyline was implausible with everything that goes amiss being caused by and compounded by the complete incompetence of the leads. No back-ups plans in place if things going wrong? No chain of command? No procedure for evacuations? Emotional decision making??? A damsel in distress leader who is incapable of carrying responsibility and a dino whisperer???? The entire movie hinges on a chaos that, realistically, should never occurred in the first place (I mean seriously...going inside the cage to inspect before having a positive identification that the animal was out?? and not having the ability to override the hamster wheels to make them go back home automatically?? - it just boggles the mind). Personally, I like my movies to have a plot line that isn't dependent on chaos expanding without good reason.

Maybe the poor storyline would have been more tolerable with good acting, but that was also in short supply. I really didn't care whether anyone lived or died - nor did I feel chemistry between the two leads. There wasn't a sense of urgency, fear, or expectation throughout the movie - just a general sense of, ""Oh look, they're running around now and lots is going on, but somehow nothing is going on"". The few parts of the movie that weren't so bad (the raptors parts) could have been great given the right setting, but they ended up feeling stilted in the context of the rest of the movie.

In gist, if the original Jurassic Park movie had not existed, I don't think this movie would have stood on its own. It would have made a few bucks like similar action movies do, but it wouldn't be held in the esteem it currently is. If you are looking for a mildly entertaining movie that you can watch while simultaneously surfing the internet, this movie fits the bill. Just don't expect too much.",1454198400,2,1876,4.751533742331288

6690413,5,B00NYC65M8,"I saw this movie in the theater and knew we would have to buy the DVD. My kids and I really enjoyed this movie. The beginning, where we see the grand overview of the theme park, is breathtaking and truly makes you want to visit. The action keeps you on the edge of you seat throughout. Much of the violence and brutality is not directly show on the screen. It is mostly implied with sound effects and cut-a-ways. In a fun twist, the raptors aren't just the bad guys anymore. They also do a great job of bring in pieces of the original movie while still moving forward with the new story.

It also opens up bigger deeper ideas by looking at how the park is creating bigger, fiercer, unnatural creatures to try to keep the interest, and the money, of the easily bored humans.

So this movie has it all - fantasy, beauty, action, suspense, thought-provoking ideas and more teeth.",1454198400,,876,4.434782608695652

6690418,1,B00NYC65M8,"It's amazing to watch a film be simultaneously thunderously successful and have zero redeeming value. Ugly to look at, hobbling on nostalgia crutches, and shockingly and blatantly misogynistic, 'Jurassic World's success is frankly embarrassing, even more so than making the seventh entry in the 'Fast and the Furious' franchise one of the highest grossing films of all time. Chris Pratt stars as Not Leading Man Material, handed every action man cliche in the small book and proving he really does need the Andy Dwyer with Pecs stylings of Gunn's Starlord to pass as someone who can lead a movie. Bryce Dallas Howard stars as Women Should be Moms, absorbing Alan Grant's 'hero-saves-the-kids-and-gets-paternal/maternal' arc from 'Park', only with tasteless outdated sexism and being treated as a secondary prop to Pratt's gun toting hero, slicked conspicuously head to toe in cleavage highlighting artificial sweat. The effects are ugly, swapping the grand animal weight of the first film (and even, to a lesser extent, the second film) with the muddled fan-service destruction of the Transformers franchise. Despite being a blatant remakeboot, it is difficult to even properly compare 'World' with it's inspiration: since the premise of the film is literally built on the ironic self-awareness of the mystique of the film's dinosaurs having been worn away, there isn't any mystery, only references. Picture 'Jaws', if it had been set in an aquarium where you spend the first half of the movie watching the shark in full view with little to do but tell us in dialogue how scary the shark is. It's not just a bad film, it's a film that makes me feel gross as a filmgoer seeing this be elevated to financial godhood, especially with in light of it's disturbingly blatant sexism. Still, in the end, the dollar won. Thank god 'Force Awakens' saved the day in the end.",1454198400,3,1863,5.0519480519480515
6690419,2,B00NYC65M8,"More of a cartoon than a real film.  Other than the first one, the entire series has been almost unintentionally laughable and this one was no different.

I've been a big fan of the Jurassic Park series since I was a little girl who hid her face behind her hands during the scary dinosaur scenes and slept in her parents bedroom because of the nightmares I got (and still do get) from the movies. I liked the first two Jurassic Parks, however really just hated the third. I was looking forward to this one being different. When I first heard of it coming out, I was like seriously!? They will never learn that life cannot be contained! Then I saw this film and I was blown away. I WILL admit I wasn't a big fan of any of the characters besides Chris Pratt's character, Jake Johnsons character, and Omar Sy's character. They are the only ones who made any kind of sense throughout the movie. I didn't think that Bryce Dallas Howard's character was very well developed. It definitely could have been better. I loved getting to see a different side of the most feared velociraptors. I found myself cheering loudly from my living room at the end scene when the raptor turns on the indominous Rex and goes back to being Owen's beta. That was pretty neat. Also found myself heartbroken when the other two raptors met their demise. A movie that makes me cheer like that yet also breaks my heart and holds my attention throughout the entire movie- however, definitely gets a good review from me.",1454112000,2,1353,4.545081967213115

6690443,3,B00NYC65M8,"Fun movie, loved the special effects and of course the dinosaurs. I give it props for having a strong female character, but I'm docking it a full star for harping all over that strong female character and making every other scene with her about her lack of a man and a family and then chopping her off at the knees with her nephews. This was supposed to be the follow up to Jurassic Park that we all craved and it dismissed the 2nd and 3rd movies entirely, but after Jurassic Park went so far to make a point of the strength of its feminist female characters, this was a sorry follow up. They set it up well, they just dropped the ball on the follow through.",1454025600,,658,4.23015873015873

6690576,2,B00NYC65M8,"I love the actors in this, but I HATE the premise. A serial killer dinosaur. It could have been so much more thoughtful and creative than it was. There was so much going on, and one death scene that I found completely disturbing for a somewhat minor character. There are plot holes and improbabilities but that is assuming you're watching the movie and hoping for some context. What Jurassic World really is, is a fright fest of hiding and giant Dino's peering slowly around the obstacles our protagonists are trembling behind. Is that all dinosaurs are? Eating machines? Would they really flock to people and start chomping? I don't know, I just had higher hopes for this.

If Mystery Science Theater was to show this movie, they would have more than sufficient material to bring humor to a bad movie.

Training dinosaurs like they are common dogs and giving them personalities, seriously that was funny. Special effects, so-so,acting, so-so, plot, total BS. The franchise showed potential but now a sale out to mass media for the mighty dollar. Maybe another director/producer will put the next version back on trac, I doubt it.

6690633,5,B00NYC65M8,"This is a movie that does a lot of fan service but this imagining of what Jurassic Park would be as an actual park was great. High stakes, great graphics, fun story.",1453334400,,165,4.1875
6690634,5,B00NYC65M8,"There is plenty of talk these days that people have grown tired of remakes and sequels. For the most part its hard to disagree with the complaint that many of these movies are being made with the sole intent of trying to capitalize on something great while providing a shoddy film that bears little resemblance to the original or previous films. But on rare occasion a good movie is the result. Such is the case with JURASSIC WORLD.

The movie takes place years after the first film on a new island where scientists have been genetically bringing back dinosaurs found encased in amber. Having failed in the past they, of course, feel certain that theyve prepared themselves for the worst case scenarios possible. Pterodactyls are kept in an enclosed building, the predators are kept in their own secluded areas and the tamer ones are kept close to the viewing public.

Thats the first major difference. This time around the island has succeeded where the previous effort failed, making Jurassic World a viable tourist destination where people come to play with the tiny or baby dinosaurs and look on in wonder at the full grown creatures. What could go wrong?

Well of course its inevitable that something will indeed happen. Even more so when a young head executive for the company that owns the island has her nephews come to spend a weekend. Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) is centered on all things Jurassic World. So much so that when her nephews arrive she passes them off to her assistant to take care of while she handles a few minor problems as well as a major investor in the resort.

This is coupled with two other threads in the story. The first is Owen (Christopher Pratt), a soldier of fortune of sorts who has been working with the worst predators of the first film the raptors. Owen has several of these raptors trained to a clicker command system. While they still aren't ready to roam free or be controlled completely with these commands his work is coming closer to that reality. Unfortunately an unscrupulous military type named Hoskins (Vincent DOnofrio) views this as a potential weapon to be used against any enemy, something Owen disagrees with.

The last thread of import involves a new creation the scientists of the island have come up with, a hybrid of several dinosaurs. While they won't share just which dinosaurs it becomes apparent that their choices may not have been the best thought out. But their goal was to make something dangerous that will draw in more vacationers. The problem is this one is the most dangerous of all, smart and able to conceal himself. When Owen is called in to check over his enclosure the new creation escapes and is let loose on the island.

At first unwilling to shut down the island and get everyone off before something happens, Claire finds herself in the midst of a reign of terror as the new killing machine not only takes out after anything in its path but sets loose many other creatures. Whether or not Owen can find a way to save the day, whether Claire can find her nephews and get them to safety, whether or not the military will be able to weaponize the dinosaurs and whether or not the thousands of tourists will survive is something youll have to watch the film to find out.

The movie works on all levels. The acting is such that a single performance doesnt stand out. Everyone involved has brought on their A game and does a great job. Pratt is showing why his status as a new leading man is taking hold and Howard stands as his equal here.

The special effects are as amazing as they were when the first film was released. Each moment where we see a dinosaur walking the planet again seems real and breathtaking. Keep in mind its been 22 years since the original film was released. There is an entire generation that has never been exposed to this tale on the big screen that could now take it in. That they can watch it at home now makes it even more special. It will also boost the interest of youngsters in the original films.

While the age old story of man messing with things he shouldnt has been done time and time again, it remains in a film like this as something that feels fresh. Yes, if you saw the original film and its two sequels this isn't new but it is still quite entertaining. That it offers youngsters a chance to be exposed to something this amazing story wise and effects wise is a big bonus. The fact that it is the fourth film (with more sure to follow) and that it can still be fun to watch speaks volumes about how good it is.",1453334400,,4529,4.540441176470588

6690710,5,B00NYC65M8,"I really liked this movie.  I think what made it more enjoyable is the fact that they didn't try to be another Jurassic Park, trying to cash in on the original.  While the premise might have been similar (dinosaurs on the loose), the plot line was different enough to make it its own story.  The action scenes were thrilling, and real.  I like how they did sneak in a few homages to the original, like at the end,which I thought was great.  Chris Pratt did a good job and made his character believable.  All in all, a movie I will watch again and again.",1453161600,,553,4.269230769230769
6690711,3,B00NYC65M8,"CONS:
1. We (my family & I) were expecting more, but in the end, we liked it well enough.
2. Chris Pratt is the epitome of arrogance and NOT one of my favorite actors. I truly believe they could have made a much better choice.
3. Director Colin Trevorrow is a Spielberg-worshiping wanna-be, and he will never be Spielberg.
4. (Tiny Spoiler) Should have made better use of the ""bad"" dinosaur's exceptional abilities.
5. Dinosaur-wrangler Pratt, not believable as having magical training powers over creatures from millions of years in the past.
6. Three second love scene was ridiculous and did not fit with the content of the movie, whatsoever.

PROS:
1. CGI was exceptional.
2. Suspense was better than average, but not to Spielberg level.
3. Better than Jurassic Park 2 or 3.
4. Story line keeps the viewer riveted.
5. Quite a few edge-of-your-seat moments.

Overall, for us, it was just okay.
For it to have been better:

1. Find a different male hero other than Chris Bratt.
2. Focus more on the park visitors.
3. Get rid of the stupid love scene that did nothing for the movie, except uncomfortably deter the viewer from the story line.",1453161600,,1141,4.695

6690810,4,B00NYC65M8,"I should have paid a bit more attention to the description when I ordered this item from amazon, this past Christmas! I was focused more on the price that the packaging and contents. I guess I got very focused on the $9.99 price tag, and didn't realize that the actual steel case that this product came in is a ROUND tin! Doh! How am I supposed to store that? It rolls all around if I place it vertically, and if I lay it flat on the top of my other Blu-rays, I can't see if from the floor. Shoot! I hate round packaging on products! It makes them so much more difficult to store!

I really enjoyed this movie - even if you sort of need to turn off your brain while you watch it. It has a lot of neat spectacles and good action and I like the child actors that they chose to play the main kid roles in the film. It was definitely one of the best movies that came out in 2015. I'm glad I own this movie to watch, repeatedly, but I wish it were is a rectangular case instead of a round one!!!",1452643200,,990,3.9748743718592965

6690812,4,B00NYC65M8,"Years after Jurassic Park went under, man's hubris and insatiable greed launch Jurassic World - bigger and better and more of a splash than its predecessor and, as is later disclosed, more terrifying. This time, the dinosaur theme park is nestled on an island off Costa Rica. We're introduced to several point-of-view characters, or, as I'd rather refer to them, some annoying people and Chris Pratt. There's the smug, bossy executive (Bryce Dallas Howard) who sort of oversees the joint. And there are her two mopey kid nephews given VIP passes to the park. The one likable figure is ex-Navy man Owen Grady (Pratt) who has transitioned into the revolutionary post of raptor wrangler.

DNA tampering and jaw-dropping disrespect for nature dictate that things will soon take a turn for the worse. The impenetrable head scientist (B.D. Wong) is tasked by the financier - the 8th richest man on the planet - with creating a monster feature attraction, is mandated to ""make it scarier and cooler."" Ergo, the Indominus Rex, 50' long when fully grown, a mutated hybrid what's part T-Rex and part classified (And why is it exactly classified? Who the hell knows?). It dawns on the theme park's horrified think tank that the Indominus Rex is an intelligent entity, as it turns out, a super-predator what relishes killing for sport. It's inevitable that it gets out of its paddock and proceeds to run amok. What's so frightening is that it tricks its way out. So, twenty thousand people trapped on an island... Yikes.

Jurassic World annihilated the summer box office, its way of thumbing its nose at its naysayers. For sure, this movie has got flaws, some of 'em serious flaws. But this is the best sequel to the original film. At its heart, Jurassic World is awesome fan service. Unlike the most recent Godzilla - a movie that for most of its running time mercilessly teased us with mere glimpses of its feature creature - we get to eyeball the behemoths in Jurassic World from jump. Sure as tootin' there'll be a sequel; it made too much money for there not to be one. And I wouldn't mind at all if Chris Pratt were there and also that one raptor (""You my boy, Blue.""). I WOULD mind terribly if anyone else from this movie showed up because I couldn't stand anyone else.

In a way, it's a shame that CGI technology has advanced to this state. Nowadays, we take all that dazzle for granted. But you can't deny that the dinosaurs look amazing, that the Indominus Rex looks menacing as sh--. What I didn't like? I didn't like whenever Vincent D'Onofrio graced the screen as that dickish front man of that private security firm, although, at some level, I did appreciate his smirky, c0ck-of-the-walk Brian Dehenny impersonation. I wasn't as appreciative of Bryce Dallas Howard's doing her impersonal best as the theme park's most dedicated company (wo)man. Here's a drinking game: take a slug whenever she mentions the word ""asset.""

The best moments are reserved for the occasional nod to the original film and for whenever Pratt is hanging out with his dodgy pack of velociraptors and, also, for near the end when Pratt and company attempt a last-ditch effort to take out the Indominus Rex. That entire showdown - of old school vs. new school - is dope and, in fact, is worth the price of admission alone. I am basically sold on Chris Pratt as an action hero. He's effortlessly charming and his humor works and he's solid in the action sequences and I'm willing to give him a chance should he land the Indiana Jones role.

More nitpicks off the top of my head:

- Hey, concerned about the island's most dangerous experimental predator what's kept isolated in a paddock? No worries, we hired one fat security guard to keep an eye on things.
- Who thought it was a good idea to have the CEO, who also happens to be an inexperienced chopper pilot, fly on that do-or-die mission?
- The movie wants us to believe that a woman in high heels can outrun a T-Rex.
- Anyone catch the scene where Pratt gets off his vehicle just in time to run into a woman with, coincidentally, two rifles, one of which she casually hands off to Pratt in passing?
- So, let me get this straight, Jurassic World's upper management - those directly responsible for running the theme park - doesn't have a clue as to what hybrid bits the Indominus Rex is made out of? That seems like an egregious lapse in safety protocol and good judgment.
- I got seriously invested in the kids' parents getting a divorce... Bwa-ha-ha-ha! Man, I really disliked these kids and their unnecessary sub-plot.
- What does it say about the character work when the strongest emotional connection is between Pratt and his velociraptors?

My favorite line? It's Pratt's retort when he's asked to track some missing kids: ""I was with the Navy, not the Navajo.""

We were so excited to go see the move at our local theater because during my childhood and as much as I've allowed, my son has loved the Jurassic Park movie series. Anytime it comes on our local AMC we record it to our DVR so we can watch them for the next few days together. This is no exception. When we went to see the movie it was myself, my son and 2 of his friends and I was very pleased with the outcome of our trip. First off, I was a tad bit worried about the scare level because the previews always make the movies look super scary. There wasn't a bunch of kill scenes and the ones that were in the movie were not too bad. I personally hate scary movies .. I just at the smallest things .. it is kind of pathetic. But watching Jurassic World I maybe jumped once so it was great for me. My son loved watching it so I knew that it would be one of his Christmas presents (included in his ""Santa"" basket. Needless to say, we have watched Jurassic world at LEAST 20 times since Christmas and it is still just as good as it was in the theater.",1452297600,,1145,4.004366812227074

6690891,5,B00NYC65M8,"Chris Pratt on a motorcycle riding through a jungle alongside velociraptors...WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE?

In my experience sequels seldom live up to their originals so I'm usually highly skeptical of them as their hype builds.  Jurassic World, however, gelled quite nicely.  The casting, the storyline, and the CGI were all top-notch.  Of course one could argue that it was largely just a reboot of the original...genetically engineered dinos, a theme park that is always looking for bigger and better attractions, Murphy's Law that states that whatever can happen will happen, and then you toss in a couple of kids who are related to the boss...viola - reboot.

Even so, I found this tale to be fun, exciting, and well worth my investment of time and money.  It had plenty of plot twists to keep things interesting,  As someone old enough to have watched Jurassic Park when it was a new release, I especially enjoyed the shout-outs to that movie and plotline as well.

I found it a sad but true commentary that sometimes unregulated science can be allowed to go a step too far (no spoiler - you'll just have to watch the movie.

And this movie though not quite as fun on the small screen as on the large screen is well worth adding to our movie collection.

5 solid stars - good fun and good entertainment, though some scenes will definitely be too scary for young children.",1452124800,,1368,4.686192468619247
6690892,1,B00NYC65M8,"What a shameful disgrace of a film this was. Terrible story arc, outlandish plot, awful character development, and 2-Dimensional, cartoon actors. I laughed at them a lot. Whoever wrote their lines should be forced to seek employment elsewhere. Spielberg should be ashamed for even putting his hand on Jurassic World. You could actually take the actors out the the film all together and it would become instantly better. I would grant it 4 stars any day.

One thing that makes me laugh out loud is how nobody seemed to notice how fake and ghastly the special effects were with the dinosaurs. The original Jurassic Park mastered the use of animatronics by building small-scale models, converting them into movable life-size models which they then brought into the computer. That's how they looked so organic and life-like. And this was back in 1993, for Pete's sake! What excuse does Trevorrow have for how unnatural his final product is? Jurassic World slaps the original in it's glorious, groundbreaking, and alarmingly beautiful face.

I'm baffled this film scored terrific reviews and became the THIRD biggest box office earner of all time. Just goes to show you how dumb and mindless movie goers are these days. If your goal is to be entertained by cheesy and overdone CGI ""pyrotechnics,"" then this film is definitely for you. Put it at the top of your DVD rack. And of course, if you don't want to have to think, then this is the finale for you---complete with a hilarious climactic ""Dino-fight"" in the end that is sure to have smart and mature movie lovers everywhere shaking their heads in amazement and embarrassment for having sat through it.",1452124800,2,1650,4.910394265232975

6690898,1,B00NYC65M8,"I grew up with Jurassic Park. The memories I had when I was younger watching the movie for the first time were easily some of my all-time favorite moments in cinema. I had a lot of the t-shirts and action figures from the movies growing up and I even was a velociraptor for Halloween when I was younger... If that doesnt set the tone for how much of a Jurassic Park fan I was (and still am) I don't know what will.

There were still those magical moments a few times throughout the movie that brought me some nostalgia. But the issue that this movie has for me is that the acting sometimes was downright painful to watch. A huge glaring example would be from Ty Simpkins, who was the little boy that played Gray. Basically everything he said in the entire movie made me cringe. (When it gets to the scene where he talks to his older brother about their parents getting a divorce, I almost completely turned my back on the film entirely. That is easily some of the worst acting I have ever seen.) But throughout the movie there were certain parts where every main cast member had their share of over-the-top, corny lines. And the overall acting in general just did not seem real or genuine. It almost seemed like everyone in the film was forcing their lines and forcing an emotion of some sort that just wasn't there.

And the whole training the raptors was downright ridiculous Holding your hand in front of a raptors face would most likely get your hand bitten off instantly. The fact that the raptor helps save the cast at the end of the movie and then looks at them and leaves is probably the stupidest thing I could have imagined happening.

I don't understand how anyone could sit there and explain that this movie somehow does the series justice when every single character is a complete idiot. The aunt made horrible decisions, the older brother was an unnecessary prick, and the younger brother was a whimp (and a horrible actor). Their mom whines the whole time shes on screen and all of the park employees were practically brain dead.

It felt like I was watching a Disney Channel show trying to be a Jurassic movie.

The movie was exceptionally well-done for a movie of its size. Of course, don't expect an Oscar contender, but given the lackluster, embarrassingly directed blockbusters these days, this movie stands out as being one of the best of 2015. The movie is very well-balanced with its own share of memorable moments, albeit not as great as the original movie. But this one is definitely the best one that's been released so far. The action, drama, and monster rampages were well-balanced, and the character and plot development was above average, given the scope of this film. Watch it once in the theater and watch it once at home, and you should be good. Unfortunately, like many blockbusters these days, the rewatch quality is very low, so plan ahead.",1452038400,,880,4.98639455782313

The movie was better than I had hoped and certainly will be rewatchable several times over. There are aspects about the movie that I am certain others will complain about, but for me, the biggest negative for the movie was the dinosaurs themselves. Somehow, the dinosaurs in this movie looked worse than the ones in the 1993 movie, especially the velociraptors. The original is so memorable because the dinosaurs looked real, and despite their limited screen time (15 minutes), they were the stars of the movie. I feel that this movie lost that concept a bit, and for that, it gets 4 stars rather than 5.",1451952000,,706,4.656

Dazzling special effects (to be sure), a great score by Michael Giacchino (I had to buy the original soundtrack), lots of action (eventually), but.....  There was way too much made of the impending divorce (a plotline that went nowhere).  And then there was Bryce Dallas Howards attempt to simulate a real person and not succeeding.  At times I was convinced she was a CGI fabrication, she didn't even blink, just that vacuous stare (the holograms showed more life!).  It also didn't help that there was one villain too many (Vincent DOnofrio or BD Wong, take your pick).  But.  There were all those fabulous dinosaurs and so much wonderful mayhem.  Still, I could have done without Colin Trevorrows heavy-handed screed against corporate excess and consumerism.  According to Trevorrow, Indominus rex was meant to embody humanitys worst tendencies.  Were surrounded by wonder and yet we want more, and we want it bigger, faster, louder, better.  Theres something in the film about our greed and our desire for profit.  MMMM-yeah, this from the guy who purposely made a blockbuster so they could make a lot of money.  And hes scolding us for wanting a halfway decent movie from him!?

6690960,3,B00NYC65M8,"What happened? The original Jurassic Park was an excellent framework for the Jurassic series. It had very emotionally engaging characters, there was enough character development and background, very succinct build up of the potential hazards of the dinosaurs and provided a very beautiful Jurassic Park experience also. Jurassic World for some reason seemed to focus on the visitors center and all those visitors 90% of the time and then they tried to squeeze in everything else. There was eventually too little time spent on Chris Pratt's emotional bond with the raptors, too little time spent on the youngest child's infatuation with dinosaurs and there really was no believable rapport established between Chris Pratt and the female director lady to really believe they would fall in love. And the worst part of all is the whole Jurassic World experience became more of a very limited piecemeal part of the movie. To me they needed to cut out some of the storylines that they had going like the parents about to get divorced which not only was irrelevant but there was no conclusion at the end. And to me the survival part of the movie between the brothers was very engaging and should have been much longer. To me that was the best potential storyline of the whole movie. I loved the ending of the movie but overall it was like trying to squeeze too many storylines into one movie and it didn't work for me. I would have cut out the whole part about Pratt being a raptor trainer, dumped the potential relationship between Pratt and the coordinator lady and focused more on the park experience and built more into the brother's survival storyline.",1451779200,2,1650,4.833922261484099

6690985,4,B00NYC65M8,"I really liked this movie.  It is an action movie that I didn't find boring or drawn out.  A couple of times I was yelling at the characters for being stupid, and I highly doubt Bryce Dallas Howard's character could wear heals that high, that long, in real life, but I think the movie was fun.  The movie could have sucked like so many movie series' have, but it didn't.  I don't think it is appropriate for young children, however, because there is a bit of blood and bites and bullets.
I would watch this movie again.",1451606400,,519,4.319587628865979
6690986,3,B00NYC65M8,"Rating: A solid 2.5 but you can't give half a star ratings.

I loved the homage they pay to the original Jurrasic Park movie all throughout.  I thought the main story was good with using the velociraptors to hunt down the hybrid was a great idea.  The love story and about 60% of the dialog was over the top.  I guess most of the budget went into the CGI which was really good for just about everything except when the birds attack.  I was highly impressed that Owen was able to ride his motorcycle through the woods at night and never hit a stump or anything the guy is truly amazing.

This will not be a movie I would watch twice, but I have wasted 2 hours on stuff that was worse than this.",1451606400,,693,4.134328358208955

SO, yes, the movie isn't perfect and there are a few minor things in the plot line that could have been improved, BUT, it was AM-A-ZING!!! First of all, I love how early in the movie, they reference the tragedy of Jurassic Park and tie into how this big new park came about. I love the animation of the dinosaurs and the cinematography. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are gorgeous and play their roles well! AND, so I don't spoil anything (this is on the cover), I love that Chris Pratt rides his motorcycle with the raptors.

We first met him as the dumb jock in the TV Series Everwoodall brawn and no brain. He gets to show off his size and muscles here but also gets to show he has a mind as well. Of course the real stars are the critters and once more they chew through the scenery and the people on their island home.

They're made of a medium-hard vinyl, like what the Papo Dinosaur toys are made of, and are absolutely brilliant. Nice, weighty base, great paint apps, and movie accurate sculpts! A perfect molting of milk chocolate browns on the T. rex and a great layering of chalky white and limestone grays on the iRex. The mouths have a little bit of paint that leaks onto them, suggesting the figures are air brushed, but this can be easily fixed with the right application of a pink Sharpie. I'd suggest keeping out of reach of toddlers and babies, though. The teeth and claws are a tad sharp and soft skin may find itself easily scratched.

The standard for American movies is obviously in the toilet. I truly wish this were as good as Jurassic Park, or the great movies of the 70 - 80's, like Alien. Unfortunately, no. Besides the predictable plot, junk science, and the idiot/unlikable characters it was very difficult to stomach watching the women in the movie being cast as sex pots or insipid morons. I counted women crying helplessly in this movie 5 times. Seriously? Micheal Crichton must be rolling over in his grave. All his books had strong female leads, like Ellie from the first movie...a real scientist wearing construction boots and kicking butt with a shotgun. Here the hero's love interest was totally ridiculous, running around in a silk outfit with 5 inch stiletto heels (still on at the end of the movie), and she was a complete idiot to boot, and so despicable and unlikable I wanted her to get munched. In addition, I am a wildlife biologist so I could not get past the totally far-fetched science and behavior of the dinosaurs in the movie...it was so laughable, I ended up laughing through the second half, rooting for the dinosaurs every time they got somebody. Made up science drove the story; I guess their on staff-biologist quit 5 minutes into writing the screen play or something.

6691120,2,B00NYC65M8,"I need to start out by telling you that the original Jurassic Park is my absolute favorite movie of all-time, but Collin Trevorrow let me down with this movie and it is my least favorite of the series.

Where to start? First, the largest problem I have with the movie are the characters themselves. They are 1 dimensional, and as an audience member you hate almost all of them. You have Chris Pratt who basically just plays Chris Pratt like he does in every movie he's in, Bryce Dallas Howard plays an operations manager in the park, and a terrible family member, and then you have 2 children who are the operation manger's nephews, one of which is just a whiny kid, and the other one is a Justin Bieber look-a-like. You already know how much you hate Justin Bieber and you will equally hate this character just as much. If his Bieber look isn't bad enough for you, the director decided he needed to be addicted to his cell phone during the entire movie. I'm assuming the director was trying to make some kind statement about cell phone addiction or something, but it does not fit into the movie at all, and it just feels extremely out of place. No one would be staring at their cell phone that much at a place like this, I don't care how much of a mook they are. As an audience member you just couldn't care less if these characters live or die, which is the complete opposite of the characters in the first movie, which were some of the best characters to ever be put on screen. Spielberg is a film making genius, Trevorrow is not. I'm not even sure what Trevorrow is. I'm going to go with completely talent-less for now.

Secondly, a huge problem I have is the entire plot of the movie itself. The movie should not have even happened in the first place. After the events of the first 3 Jurassic movies another park would never be allowed to exist. Ever. So somehow in this movie the park is in existence and then the entire plot of the first movie happens all over. Dinosaurs break free and people die. Its pretty obvious that the only reason this movie happened in the first place is because it was a huge cash grab for Universal Studios.

The movie does offer some good dinosaur fun, although I think the idea of having trained raptors was the most terrible idea to be put on screen in a Jurassic film. The end battle with the Indominus Rex vs the T-Rex and Raptors was kind of entertaining, but at the same time very cringe worthy. The movie does look pretty good in 3D I will say.

At the end of the day, if you are a Jurassic Park fan I'm sure you'll at least see this because it has dinosaurs and has Jurassic in the title. Unfortunately it doesn't live up to any of the previous Jurassic films. I gotta say I'm pretty terrified to hear Trevorrow is directing Star Wars Episode IX. If this movie is any indication, he doesn't understand character development one bit, and I'm worried what he'll do with Star Wars.",1451088000,2,2922,4.385608856088561

6691125,2,B00NYC65M8,"Jurassic World is fine if you're looking for a more lighthearted 'disaster' movie with a lower body count. While I personally saw Jurassic World as an insult to the original film, I cannot give this film a exceedingly negative one-star review simply by comparing it to the original. My biggest complaint against this film would be the fact that it ignores the rules and themes of the original film and novel. That is all I can really say without spoiling the events of the film.

Other downsides would be the inclusion of simplistic dumb humor and too much quirky humor for the sake of trying to emulate other humorous 'action' films like Guardians of the Galaxy. Another big flaw is the fact that the CGI dinosaurs look worse than the animatronics and CGI of the original film. Which came out in the early 1990s. The previous films succeeded in both blending the dinosaurs with the environments they were in and having them move and 'act' realistically. The dinosaurs in Jurassic World do not blend with the environments, they stick out harshly and perform in outlandish ways that break the feeling of immersion.

By and large this film was a horrible disappointment, especially since it works so hard to place itself in the same universe as the original three films. Had Jurassic World been a clear reboot of the franchise and not attempt to link itself to the original films, then the only true problem with this film would be the poorly done dinosaurs themselves. Otherwise it would have been a simple summer action movie that would have been as forgettable as the characters and plot were.",1451088000,2,1594,4.771739130434782

6691174,3,B00NYC65M8,"This movie doesn't top the nostalgia wave or writing of the original Park but it told the other sequels.

Pratt and Howard do great as the leads even as they are cookie cutter protagonists, the fun guy who knows his dinosaurs and the stuffy director who needs to chill out a bit.

This movie is full of references to the original Park and basically I'd say it's a remake of the old movie in the guise of a sequel. This is not a bad thing as it coasts by on a nostalgia wave at all.

For me, a fan of meta in entertainment, this movie has interesting things to tell the viewer. It has some commentary to explain why the dinosaurs in JP look different than the real ones (most notably raptors being big in the franchise and small for real). I liked that and also the way the film tried to explain how blockbusters try to get bigger and bigger at the risk of audiences getting bored until something bigger and badder comes along. This part was kind of interesting to me but I feel like World relies on being as cgi and schlock heavy as any modern summer film. These dinosaurs and the film simply don't look as nice as the first one. It is a problem with most movies these days.

This movie also has weird editing. For example there's a scene at the Mosasaur feeding and the older brother asks the younger if he wants to see something cooler, though he hasn't cared about the park. The divorce storyline was also unnecessary as it had no outcome on the final product.

Overall this film is capable and worth a watch or three. It just doesn't hold up like the original.",1450742400,,1564,4.3061224489795915

I was also taken aback after watching it to know that this was being shown to my children's classmates, I found it far too graphic for that audience and will not be sharing this movie my my children for many years.  I am likely to share the first Jurassic Park well before this one.  The plus side was the brotherly bond depicted in the movie, the older brother did a great job acting like he probably does in real life, so not much a stretch there, but he portrayed an indifferent sibling turned protective well and in a way that felt real for brothers, so that was fun to watch.

Lake Stevens is always proud of Chris Pratt, and this movie does not change that.  He does all the things a handsome and funny leading man in a mega blockbuster should do, and does them well.  The problem, as always, is the material that actors and actresses are given to work with, but then that would not be the point of a movie like this.

It is not that this movie is not good entertainment as this is a great popcorn fare type of movie with great special effects and beautiful scenery which to me makes the movie.  The biggest issue I have with this movie is the story has basically repeated itself since the first Jurassic Park movie and with the exception of the new special effects hasn't really brought anything new to the series.  With the exception of Pratt, the acting for the most part is fairly mediocre.  Combine that with the weak plotline that is predictable and formulaic to a fault and is essentially a repeat of the previous movies, you get an average popcorn movie.  Granted though I do understand the appeal and for purely an action movie that you can just relax and enjoy, then this will do the job as it is entertaining in its own way.  And definitely if you are a fan of the series, you will enjoy the movie flaws and all.  For me, it is an average flick that kept me entertained for two hours.

6691238,2,B00NYC65M8,"And I went into this movie knowing that it would never compare to the first, but I put all of my nostalgia and bias aside and tried to enjoy the movie without comparisons.

Things that really bothered me:

- The terrible characters. I don't so much blame the real-life actors themselves but the terrible scripting. The only decent character was Chris Pratt's and even he was flawed because  ...
- ...he was training raptors. Yes I know, it was no surprise by the time that I finally got around to watching this movie that I had discovered this ridiculousness. You can also look at the cover of the movie and make some inference to this.
- Speaking of the raptors, they looked so computer-animated. While I realize that we really don't know exactly what raptors REALLY looked like, I'm sure they didn't look like they were pulled out of the Lego Movie. CGI is ruining movies and producers are becoming entirely too over-reliant on it.
- I couldn't help but notice when Pratt was speeding through the dense jungle with the raptors in lead, his hair and clothing were barely blowing in the wind and his motorcycle suspension must have been the most amazing in the world, unless the jungle floor was as smooth as concrete. Seriously, I would expect this in a movie from the 60s (actually, they probably would have just filmed a man riding a motorcycle outside in one of those movies instead of on a contrived device in a studio) and not in a release from 2015.
- While I realize that in reality most of mankind are a bunch of total idiots, it would have been nice to have people in charge of an entire island full of lethal prehistoric killers not be total idiots themselves. Nearly every worker at the park was either clueless or power-hungry (think corporate-type).
- For all of the killing going on (and there was a lot of blood-letting), the movie was entirely too silly. One aspect in which I cannot help but compare this disappointment to the original JP is that while JP1 had its funny lines and moments, it was overall a very serious and believable movie. Jurassic World was literally like it was pulled from a (cheesy) comic book. Actually, I'm sure that most comic books themselves are more serious than this movie.

This film is the epitome of an example of how you can throw piles of money and computer graphics into a film, shine it up with as much polish as you like, and still result in a pretty terrible movie. I would rate it one star, since by the end I neither cared at all how it would end nor if I even finished watching it, but due to a few references to the original film, I'll spare it with two stars.

I rented this movie for free, and I will not watch it again. However, I do own the original and it'll continue to be a favorite forever.

First JP2, then 3, and now Jurassic World....this series is officially EXTINCT. Please, please Hollywood, let it rest in peace.",1450483200,,2888,4.491428571428571

6691247,4,B00NYC65M8,"Saw it in the theater but the 3D Blue Ray adds a whole new dimension.  The 3D is well done but not overdone.  One word of warning: Watching people getting gobbled up like Gummy bears and resulting blood spatter is a little more un-nerving in 3D.  With Active 3D glasses format the movie is bright and natural. The 3D adds to the experience and body of the movie and the dinosaurs are the stars here. The 3D effects are 5 star for sure and this sequel is very good, entertaining and worthwhile and better than most of it's predecessors, but not the original.",1450396800,,557,4.388349514563107

6691274,1,B00NYC65M8,"I went into this movie with an open mind. I wanted desperately to like it. But lord almighty it is packed to the gills with the corniest film writing tropes of all time. Chris Pratt's talents are completely wasted. The two brothers were a complete waste of screen time. The InGen ""Baddie"" was so one dimensional I'm surprised they didn't give him a name like ""Warlord McGreed"".Yeah, I get it, it's a silly action film. But the original was able to avoid a lot of these problems while still being just that - ORIGINAL. The ending was almost unendurable. ""We need more teeth""  Are you kidding me with that writing? ***SPOILERS**** The dinosaurs end up saving the day, again. But wait, it's different because the raptors were good. But then they were bad! and then they got good again. And, uh, thrown in a T Rex. Yeah. And the water monster. They all team up and give each other a nod of approval afterward. Cool!

I love Chris Pratt, he is in such goodsape for this movie, his acting made the movie better. The chick in here is a bad actor. I personally thought this movie was mild in scare factor compared to the original Jurassic Park movie and this one is supposed to be ""world"" so bigger than just a park and yet its not as scarey.

The Indominus Rex had me on the edge of my seat in anticipation, fear, and excitement all in equal measures. I definitely recommend it!

The original JP was something akin to a religion for me as a kid, and I think JW has come the closest of any of the last few franchise entries to recapping that vibe. I will say, however, that they tried way too hard to smash references to the first two films at a minimum of once every ten minutes. I appreciate the fan-service, guys, but lets try to make a new movie here. Also, a lot of the action and plot will have you spinning your eyes like the tires of an interstate semi, but none of us are legitimately watching dinosaur sci-fi for the bullet-proof logic. Despite that, its certainly entertaining and makes decent use of the PG13 rating. Also, that Bryce Dallas Howard is pretty cute in this =) Looking forward to the next entry, and it'll be interesting to see where they take it from here!",1449705600,,902,4.34319526627219

6691411,4,B00NYC65M8,"This is actually a pretty good film, but it has plot-holes and illogic galore... so if you can't just turn off your brain, you may not want to watch it.

The basic plot picks up some twenty-plus years after the first film.  As far as  I can tell, it ignores, utterly, the two prior sequels.  It also neglects the characters from the original films (except for a statue of John Hammond which you never really see at all, and one minor bit-part character who works in the lab)

The new characters are all reasonably likable (except for those who you're not supposed to like!).  Chris Pratt plays... well, Chris Pratt.  He's not much of an actor, as he always plays every character the exact same way, but he's fun to watch, and it's quite evident that he's enjoying himself in this film, which helps bring us along and helps us enjoy it too.

I almost got the impression that Bryce Dallas Howard's character was originally intended to be Hammond's granddaughter from the original film...  and would have preferred that, honestly... but she was good in her own way, anyway.  ""Opie's daughter"" (or is that ""Richie Cunningham's daughter?"") is a lot better looking than her dad, and has a level of charm that most people find really appealing.  But...  the high-heel thing was just stupid... and in real life, would have led to her being eaten pretty quickly!

The film played with the same ""should man play god?"" questions, but in a much less thoughtful way than Michael Crichton's original novel.  There was never any ""more ambiguity"" present here... we all KNEW that creating the ""Indominus Rex"" by combining ""top secret mixtures of Dino-DNA"" would be a bad thing.

On the other hand, at least they explained in a plausible way WHY the I-Rex was so hostile...  even if the biological explanation for it's ""new gifts"" was less than plausible.

The film plays with the idea that dinosaurs are simply animals...  not good, or evil... not MONSTERS.  That was very well-handled, especially as related to the team of velociraptors.

The ""disaster"" which occurs is remarkably poorly handled by the park...  you'd think that they'd have run ""failure mode effects analysis"" over scenarios in which a sizable portion of the island's 20,000 or so visitors might get EATEN...  which was beyond believability to me.  At the very least, you'd think that they'd have underground bunkers and tunnels, like DISNEYLAND has, where they could evacuate the visitors if necessary, huh?  But... nope... the guests just have to stay outside and get picked off by pterodactyls, huh?

So... I DO recommend this film, especially if you like the series prior to this, but don't expect a serious story... expect to see a lot of fun sequences which don't necessary make sense, expect to see Bryce Dallas Howard look cute but harried, expect to see Chris Pratt look smug yet charming, expect to see a ""black hatted bad guy"" who you can root against in good conscience, expect to be banged over the head with some preachiness, and expect to see some really cool sequences involving dinosaurs.

If that sounds like a good time to you, this is a great way to spend a lazy evening.  But, don't expect this film to bring anything really exciting or new to the table for you.",1449705600,,3235,4.750896057347671

And so what if I'll never touch the 3D, the two dinosaurs alone are worth the price !  I was searching for a realistic figure of the Indominus Rex, but all I could find was the ""kids' playtime version"" for lack of a better term.  Once I saw this collectible I was hooked and rushed to get this set, and the T-Rex is just as good, both figures are very detailed and a great addition for any fan of the film.  And by the way, as the package advertises you can use the two dinos as bookends if you so desire.  All in all, this is a top notch item !",1449446400,,670,3.8970588235294117

I miss Jeff Goldblum although Chris Pratt, Vincent D'Onofrio and B.D. Wong were okay in the movie. I wish Wong had more of a part.

The island scenes were beautiful especially on Blu-ray. The special effects with the dinosaurs was top notch as always.

6691489,4,B00NYC65M8,"SPOILERS

After reading the rave reviews from people who liked the first and not the sequels but loved this I rented it for the night.
PRO:
It was very entertaining CGI action.
Nice plot twist on the V-Raptors (the real stars of this iteration)
Good suspense of never seeing super-dino UNTIL ......
Good choice of the hero rifle: Merlin 444 Magnum with Leopold Scout Scope (critical for shooting the 'side of a barn' target)
CONS:
Being former Army I have to imagine the OPORD to the Blackwater-Clone unit and the J Park response unit:
Enemy: Highly mobile, size of three tanks, armor of an APC, rapid killer, impervious to a Dillon (7.62 chain gun).
So what do they take? Small arms, body armor and helmets (didn't think the OPORD said anything about ""grenade shooting"" dinosaurs).
They DID think to take ONE AT-4 but used the ONE napalm round (I'm being funny. No such thing as a napalm warhead. Anti-Tank warheads are for....YES! Tanks and bunkers.)
Our super-dino can outrun a EC-135 helicopter yet two boys running through jungle terrain are a bridge too far.

Suggestion: If you are wanting to get really scared then watch the Amazon series: Man in the High Castle. Ridley Scott produced scarefest. Free on Amazon Prime!",1449360000,,1226,4.805687203791469

When ""Jurassic World"" hit theaters, I was there right away.  I loved the film, and I hoped that there would be a Blu-Ray set similar to the collection I had gotten of the earlier movies.  I was excited when I saw this set available for preorder, and I snagged it right then.

The set doesn't disappoint.  The movie itself needs no review, as it's been reviewed hundreds and hundreds of times.  The dinosaur statues that this set comes with are awesome.

The T-Rex and the I-Rex come apart so you can effectively use them as book ends, or DVD/Blu-Ray ends if you will.  The detail on them is great, and they really fit well on a shelf in your media room dedicated to Jurassic Park.

Overall, I'm happy with this collection, and really glad I added it to my collection.

Directed by Colin Trevorrow [Safety Not Guaranteed] and Executive Produced by Academy Award Winner Steven Spielberg, one of the biggest movie franchise of all time, gets even bigger with JURASSIC WORLD 3D. Twenty-two years after the events of Jurassic Park [1993], that was originally envisioned as a dinosaur theme park by John Hammond, where guests could experience the thrill of actually witnessing dinosaurs. Today, Jurassic World welcomes tens of thousands of visitors, but something sinister lurks behind the parks attractions: a genetically modified dinosaur with savage capabilities. When chaos erupts across the island, Owen [Chris Pratt of Guardians of the Galaxy] and Claire [Bryce Dallas Howard of The Help] race to restore order as a day in the park becomes a struggle for survival.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: 22 years on and Jurassic Park is once again open for business and though it can't capture the magic and awe of the original it still makes for solid blockbuster fare. On the island of Isla Nublar in Costa Rica, theme park goers enjoy their stay at the Hilton Isla Nublar hotel and enjoy all the educational activities, where get to see Mr. DNA, dig up dinosaurs, and feed the Zuniceratops, plus and the water park shows that the theme park has to offer. Simon Masrani [Iffran Khan], the owner of JURASSIC WORLD, realises a vision of the parks success rests on inventing newer dinosaurs that are terrifying even in nightmares to parents let alone children. Scientists are working hard with the advent of genome splicing to deliver monsters that are bigger, scarier, and which reinvent the wheel in terms of gaining global admiration from theme park goers who now view dinosaurs like the T-Rex as mediocre according to data research. Dr. Henry Wu [BD Wong] and his team of geneticists engineer a new breed of dinosaur that is more than what anyone has bargained for. Initially brought on-board to evaluate and critique the safety of this new Indominus Rex, Owen Grady [Chris Pratt] reveals and informs that it is perhaps not a good idea to Claire [Bryce Dallas Howard], operations manager of JURASSIC WORLD. With her nephews being on the park, Claire cannot afford to have a dinosaur on the loose in terms of what even the company cannot comprehend. What ensues after the Indominus Rex escapes is a film that is filled with wonderful full on chaos, adventure, and a sense of purpose throughout the plot. But even though the plot line of JURASSIC WORLD for the most part is entirely predictable, it is still a jolly good rollercoaster romp. Despite this, Jurassic World does keep a charm about it purely with its visual splendour and deep rooted concept to the original films.

While JURASSIC WORLD is entertaining largely due to the fantastic brilliant visual splendour on screen. The main story revolves around the separation of the two boys, an aunt that does not have a close relationship with her nephews due to her busy work schedule, a military man seeking to use dinosaurs as a weapon, a love interest between Owen and Claire that is entirely void of any detail, a teenager that cannot control his glares at other girls despite already having a devoted girlfriend in his life back home, and the bond between man and Raptors that leaves more questions than it resolves by the end of the film due to its erratic nature. At the end of it all, you get the sense that you have been through an adventure with a group of very shallow characters that did manage to reap some entertainment value in their sequences with attacking dinosaurs and chases, but despite this aspect of the film, I still found it very entertaining.

JURASSIC WORLD has totally splendid visuals experiences that deserve a mention here for the most part. In 2D of the film is stunning and the lush jungle and whole design of JURASSIC WORLD as a theme park on a remote island with various parts captures the nostalgia from the first film franchises. But to me the 3D is definitely the only way to view JURASSIC WORLD, as the layers of 3D and screen depth are apparent, and help to really sell a larger-than-life image of the park that simply cannot be missed.

JURASSIC WORLD ends up delivering a lot of brilliant action sequences that encompasses fights between many different dinosaurs on a large backdrop, most notably the classic T-Rex and the Indominus Rex in an effort to pay homage to the contrasted nature of the classic films vs the newer one. You get a sense that you are actually at a theme park, but a bulk of the movie feels rather underwhelming for many portions and all the characters feel hollow and underdeveloped. Chris Pratt acts totally excellent throughout the course of the movie with some light comedic moments which are more than appreciated, but it does not do the film enough justice. Colin Trevorrow, the films debut director, takes the helm from Steven Spielberg in this latest adaptation to the dinosaur thriller and it is clear that he definitely had somewhat of a hard time trying to recreate a classic and enhancing on it further in a more meaningful way other than to really up his game in producing some awesome totally stunning CGI effects and providing a straightforward plot as a bonus.

JURASSIC WORLD is a really memorable film in its own right, and is easily the best of the series since the original. It retains that same magic, that sense of scope and awe, that feeling of novelty and adventure, even as it's little more than that first film repurposed, jazzed up with better visual effects and a mild reworking of the core story. It also has larger-than-life spectacle and CGI razzle-dazzle. The 3D effects are a fantastic three-dimensional video and reference-quality audio that's sure to make owners feel like they're in the middle of the action. JURASSIC WORLD is an undeniably entertaining movie, but not one that will stay with the viewer very long after its done. But if prefer only to like viewing it in 2D, you will still have a great ride throughout the whole 124 minutes.

3D Blu-ray Video Quality  Universal Pictures JURASSIC WORLD 3D has the dinosaurs unleashed and run rampant on this 3D Blu-ray with a fearsomely awesome stunning 3D 1080p encoded image with great effect, that nicely adds to the film's wow factor. Some of the shots are with a combination of 35mm, System 65 and digital cameras, the elements terrifically lend themselves to the format. Separation between the foreground and background objects is excellent, often creating a realistic 3D world with a great sense of distance and space, especially during the many sunny exterior shots. In a few scenes, however, the illusion isn't quite as effective, such as when the two nephews roam the visitor centre where we see more of a layered, pop-up book effect, as if some of the kids were paper cut-outs. The faces and shoulders of the actors have a believable roundness to them while the snout of the dinosaurs can occasionally feel as though protruding from the screen and not quite at reference quality, but despite this, overall results are nonetheless very impressive. As to the 2D Blu-ray disc, which again has a terrific 1080p encoded image, especially with the blending of the various locations with CGI extensions that are completely believable, so giving us an overwhelming amount of CGI effects that is startling in how realistic it all looks.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  JURASSIC WORLD 3D is presented in a monstrously spectacular 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack that will leave your house trembling in fear of the Jurassic battle. Simply put, the track easily ranks as one of the best audio presentations of the year, and as would be expected from an action on this magnitude, the rear activity satisfies on every level and surrounding the listener with totally fluid movement and panning, and the sounds mix delivers a variety of subtle ambient sound effects in every scene with the hybrid dinosaur stealthily moving among the trees and the eventual mayhem it wreaks, such as the pterodactyls descending upon unsuspecting visitors, creating a stunningly immersive 360 sound field. As usual with the Jurassic films in the 7.1 DTS-HD sound mix, happily fills all the channels with atmospheric sound and especially Michael Giacchinos score, with several cues built from the original 1993 John Williams score. The subwoofer is also very active here, especially with a fantastic spacious soundstage, and the bass astounds with deep, unrestrained palpability, adding tremendous depth and weight to Indominus Rex's every stomp, the explosive action and the final clash for the king of the dinosaurs. Irrespective of whatever package you pick up, the JURASSIC WORLD 3D Blu-ray release always provides the same equally impressive and similarly reference quality audio in all the Jurassic films.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Deleted Scenes [2015] [1080p] [2.00:1] [6:08] Here we have seven deleted scenes, totalling just over 6 minutes. Theres nothing particularly crucial, just some extra fillers that could not be included in the film, as I suspect they felt it slowed down the film. One bit of grossness is when Owen and Claire have to cover themselves with dinosaur dung. One nice factor with these deleted scenes is that it is presented in 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.

Special Feature: Chris & Colin Take on the WORLD [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [8:56] With this feature is really a mutual Question and Answer session between Chris Pratt and Colin Trevorrow on all aspects relating to JURASSIC WORLD, which apparently conducted in February 2015 as part of the international promotional push for the film. There are no major revelations here, although Chris Pratt does get noted for having called out the idea that he would be doing this film in footage from the set of Parks and Recreation which you see in a personal video. Watch carefully at the beginning of the promo and you will see that they have pulled footage from two different features with Colin Trevorrow in the montage that starts everything; there is a shot of him wearing a different shirt. What I liked about this feature is the nice banter you got between Chris Pratt and Colin Trevorrow, plus you get some behind-the-scenes on the set of JURASSIC WORLD.

Special Feature: Welcome to JURRASIC WORLD [2015] [480i/1080p] [1.33:1/1.78:1] [29:52] Here we get a mutual interview with Colin Trevorrow and Steven Spielberg about the previous Jurassic films and we also get excerpts from the original Jurassic Park and also behind-the-scenes of JURRASIC WORLD. Colin Trevorrow actually admits that he broke a grounding punishment from his parents and sneaked out of the house to see Jurassic Park in 1993 as a teenager and yes, you read that correctly, he was a teenager when Jurassic Park came out, doesnt that make you feel old. We find out from Colin Trevorrow that he wanted a different slant on the film where the humans to react with the some of the dinosaurs. We also get to see some location shots and 50% was shot in Hawaii, especially at the Honolulu Zoo and the other 50% locations shots were done in Louisiana, especially at a Theme Park. We also get loads of contributions from people like Derek Connolly [Co-writer]; BD Wong [Dr. WU]; Jake Johnson [Lowery]; John Schwartzman A.S.C. [Director of Photography]; Daniel Orlandi [Costume Designer]; Edward Verreaux [Production Designer]; Chris Pratt [Owen]; Bryce Dallas Howard [Claire]; Ty Simkins [Gray]; Nick Robinson [Zach]; Omar Sy [Barry]; Irrfan Khan [Masrani]; Patrick Crowley [Producer]; Vincent DOnofrio [Hoskins]; Frank Marshall [Producer]; Lauren Lapkins [Vivian]; Chris OHara [Stunt Coordinator]; John Robert Rosengrant [Puppeteer] and Jimmy Buffett.

Special Feature: Dinosaurs Roam Once Again [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [16:28] This in depth feature gives another aspect of the behind-the-scene shooting and also covers the awesome dinosaur special effects that seen in the new film. Most of this work was done with CGI, of course, but the one lovely scene done is with a puppet on set and is given some good focus on the subject. We again get quite a few contributions and they are from Chris Pratt [Owen]; Colin Trevorrow [Co-writer/Director]; Dennis Muren [Sr. VFX Supervisor, ILM VFX Supervisor for Jurassic Park]; Chris Moore [ILM Data Wrangler]; Steven Spielberg [Executive Producer]; Ty Simpkins [Gray]; Bryce Dallas Howard [Claire]; Chris OHara [Stunt Coordinator]; Tim Alexander [Visual Effects Supervisor]; Glen McIntosh [Visual Effects Animation Supervisor]; Kalie McGrath [Zara]; John Schwartzman A.S.C. [Director of Photography]; Phil Tippet [Dinosaur Consultant]; Vincent DOnofrio [Hoskins]; Frank Marshalls [Producer]; Patrick Crowley [Producer] and Geoff Cambell [Digital Creature Model Supervisor]. One nice bonus is that we get to visit Industrial Light & Magic in San Francisco in California to see how they bring the dinosaurs to life in photo real and we also get to see quite a few of some of the ILM Motion Test Shots of the dinosaurs, plus some really nice Concept Art of the dinosaurs.

Special Feature: JURRASIC WORLD: All-Access Pass [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [10:10] This feature feels like a holdover from the older Take Control or U Control interactive features. Its designed to allow Chris Pratt [Owen]; Derek Connolly [Co-writer] and Colin Trevorrow [Co-writer/Director] to show the viewer moments from the film and immediately discuss how those moments were accomplished via on-set footage. We also again get to see some more Concept Art of the dinosaurs, plus you also get to see actual scenes from the film.

Special Feature: Innovation Center Tour with Chris Pratt [1080p] [2:01] This is a very quick look at the visitors centre for the new SAMSUNG Innovation Center park, with Chris Pratt providing some up-close looks at various bits of the interactive playback on the New Orleans set, as well as some of the set dressing. There are a few nice items we get to view, including a bronze statue of John Hammond [Sir Richard Attenborough] in homage to his first appearance in the original Jurassic Park film. We also get some contributions from the likes of Colin Trevorrow [Co-writer/Director] and Edward Verreaux [Production Designer]. One thing is very clear, Chris Pratt is a bit dumb when it comes to explaining some of the information display boards that gives information on all aspects of the prehistoric period and especially the creatures that roamed on the earth millions of years ago.

Finally, Universal Pictures JURASSIC WORLD 3D delivers on its promise of satisfying in telling us to ""leave your brain at the door"" because they have given us a larger-than-life spectacle and total CGI razzle-dazzle. But with the brilliant cast of Christ Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard giving us some spectacular moments like when they round up all of the wild dinosaurs, the 3D film comes into its own, and offers easy, uncomplicated entertainment with hints of self-awareness, and especially adding a bit of tongue-in-cheek comedy as a bonus. The Blu-ray arrives as a brilliant 3D and 2D two-disc set and especially the 3D Blu-ray is a fantastic three-dimensional video extravaganza and with totally reference-quality audio that for sure gives you the impression you are in the middle of the action packed film. Plus with a substantial amount of brilliant collection of special features that will give you a fair amount of a decent informative assortments of entertainment, so giving you an overall package that is of massive good value for your money that will give you 100% total satisfaction. One bit of information about this particular Universal Pictures UK Release, because it is in fact a French Release, as when the Blu-ray disc loads up and you get all the languages displayed that you have to click on for your particular language, because at the top it is for the French language, and you get this young lady asking if you want to watch the film in the French. Highly Recommended!

Bad dino escapes.

Tyrannosaurus wins the day.

6691528,2,B00NYC65M8,"Predictable and uninspired rip off of the other Jurassic Park movies. Two kids, visit their Aunt (Grandfather in Jurassic Park) at theme park. Bad dinosaur escapes pen (easily outwitting the supposed dinosaur expert, hero and pretty boy star) and picks on aforementioned kids in glass hamster ball (Jeep in Jurassic Park), which you know will always be okay. Nasty In-Gen guy, horrible death for him of course, and those annoying Velociraptors. I was hoping their appearance was minimal, but yep, they're in there and now even smarter too! So much in fact, that they can even have a little chat with naughty dinosaur to try and get him to lay off the hero while he tries to kill it in a well planned night attack (on an animal that has thermal vision). Obviously, it's a bad dinosaur (which incidentally, turns out to be a distant relative of the 4 Raptors, who knew!) and won't listen.
Aunt has brain storm and sets the pet T-Rex on it, not really anticipating what would happen once the other one won, if they run off in different directions or even became best buddies.
Honestly, the story is that ridiculous. What does elevate the review slightly is the disc itself and Universal have scored again. Benchmark audio video presentation with multiple format options, which put the other movie studios to shame.",1449273600,,1311,4.8053097345132745

6691541,3,B00NYC65M8,"Jurassic World from beginning to end pays homage to the original movie, and thats not necessarily a bad thing. The first movie made us feel the euphoria of tourists going through an unprecedented park, filled with the wonders of dinosaurs initially enclosed and then through certain circumstances set free, setting the plot towards harrowing encounters and eventual evacuation. Jurassic World follows the same formula, right down to the concluding T-rex roar punctuating its status as both apex predator and savior. This also means Jurassic World inherits the same critical flaws from the original.

Were introduced to new characters who basically fulfill the same purpose as before. There is Navy veteran Owen Brady (Chris Pratt), who like Alan Grant must survive, a pragmatist so insightful he has an aura of immunity (better stick close to him). His female counterpart is Cleare Dearing (Bryce Howard), a heroine so capable that she can give a T-rex a run for his money, heels on and all (I believe the first movie mentioned 35 mph). There are youths again, this time two brothers, Zach and Gray Mitchell, who must survive with Owen and Cleare in order to give a family feeling to the film. John Hammonds successor is Simon Masrani (Irrfan Khan), a younger and more hands-on type of leader, although this will prove to be his fateful undoing. And then there are the side characters - some good, some bad - regardless they serve as collateral-damage-entertainment.

The plot, like the original, is Jurassic World's shortcoming. The trigger point for catastrophe makes little sense. Before it was a disgruntled employee who disabled the entire park just to get to the dock undetected - anyone else would have simply called in a ""family emergency leave"". This time, its Cleare who decides to track a missing dinosaur *after* people are inside its enclosure, why didn't she do this the first time it was undetected? And Jurassic Parks primary safety was anchored by just one level of protection  vulnerable electric fences. Jurassic World replaces electric fences for a task force equally as vulnerable, called the Asset Containment Unit (ACU), a group so inept that they might as well be known As Completely Useless. Correction  they do serve as dinosaur food. Its bad enough that they approach a hostile 6-ton dinosaur with nothing more than cattle-prods. A chance at redemption with a machine-gun-mounted helicopter queues the obligatory outrun-the-bullets-right-on-the-heels scene, but the target is not an agile James Bond. It is a 40-ft long dinosaur, how could you not hit it?!? Well, maybe they did, but it doesnt matter. If they had learned anything from the previous Jurassic Parks, they would know that large dinosaurs are impervious to bullets regardless of caliber.

Despite the plot, Jurassic World does have its moments. I enjoyed the park as a spectator, and the film wisely plays on the reality that the audience is past the wonderment of the original dinosaurs, which might explain why I was bored with the velociraptor scenes. One of the best scenes from Jurassic Park 3 involved flying dinosaurs, many of them flying through a feast full of terrified tourists. The climax of the movie has a predictable outcome, the savior coming back from the brink, victorious with some help, and the survivors retrospective and relieved. Yes, much of Jurassic World seems oversaturated and over-cg-ed, but it comes together in ways that only this franchise can deliver.",1449187200,,3474,5.109154929577465

I really wish that I would have seen it on iMax but at home isn't too bad just not the same scale! I don't think I'll buy the blu-ray until the set comes out, but definitely worth renting!

6691686,3,B00NYC65M8,"After watching the first 3 movies, I was not sure what I was in for. I had not seen the trailers, and just thought it would be a fun movie to watch in 3D.

First the movie :
It was nice to see they went back to more ""Passive"" Dinosaur shots, and not the standard run of the mill killing action spree motif. The plot was quite predictable, not really giving you that edge of your seat twists and turns. This made for a somewhat relaxed movie, with bits of action. I was not overly impressed with the cast of the movie, a lot of the emotions and scenes seemed forced, and unconvincing. The cinematography on the other hand was outstanding. The scenic views were breathtaking, and the Details on the Dinosaurs were amazing. I did find the score for the movie to be excellent, really giving the movie the punch it needed. The movie did however really excel in bringing back the classic Dinosaurs that you would expect from a Jurassic movie.

Second the 3D :
I was honesty expecting a lot more. This movie screams for ""Out of the screen"" effects, which sadly were just not there. The movie was filmed in Stereo D, and then post process converted to 3D, which is why it seemed somewhat flat in that way. I will say that the scenic depth of the movie was doing extremely well. When looking out over the vistas in the movie, you really get a great deal of the landscaping depths. I would have to put this as one of the top 10 in terms of depths, though as I said, they dropped the ball with what could of been an amazing out of screen movie.

All and all it was a fun Saturday afternoon movie.",1449014400,7,1585,4.259136212624584

Yeah, the optics  were great and there were moments of real excitement, but not enough to carry the film past the first forty-five minutes.  I stopped caring and started
hoping this  Jurassic Godzilla  would hurry up and devour these two insipid kids.  But alas, no such luck: formulaic flick to the end.  All in all a waste of time and money, a lot of  ""sound and fury signifying nothing"".

I realize that many critics have accused this sequel progression as being tread worn, but the film makers did the very best they could with the legacy storyline and limited scope of the Jurassic Park concept and the monster on a rampage cliche, which was handled very intelligently and realistically. Most viewers who like this genre realize that it is not ""Gone with the Wind"", so we don't expect as much as Roger Ebert or Rex Reed in terms of though provoking metaphorical content, although we do like our monsters, and this movie delivers the goods and then some. Having said that, the human cast is very attractive and well balanced, with intriguing male and female leads, although their love interest takes a back seat to the dinosaur action. Nice to see that digital effects have been perfected. The dinosaurs have incredibly realistic eye and skin detail, and the special effects photography has the exact same attributes as live action photography in terms of motion blur and camera movement. Will definitely please prehistoric monster fans, although probably too scary for younger kids.",1449014400,,1188,5.035532994923858

Is it a renter: definitely. It's a fun movie with surround sound and again helps bring dinosaurs to life.  It could have used more dinosaurs in my opinion.

I love how the main female character had her business attire all ripped up and dirty yet was still running around in her high heel pumps... Running from faster dino's all the way to the end of fhe movie. Come on man!

If we have another movie in this series it would be great if someone put some actual thought into the storyline to make it somewhat original...  Overall, I give this a two star rating because I like the series but that is its only saving grace. Everything else was a waste of time and money...

6691774,4,B00NYC65M8,"I will be honest...I enjoyed Jurassic World for what it was: a Summer Popcorn flick.  The CGI was ok, the acting was decent and the story was basic.  I remember going to see Jurassic Park back in the summer of 1993 and it still blows me away. The film was well done and the Dinosaurs were very believable...mostly becasue the CGI was used only when needed and they relied on Anamatronic Dinos, and thats the key.  Anyone can spot CGI, but the real life looking creatures fooled you...and Stan Winstons Studios really did a bang up job with the realistic skin and eyes and sounds.  You really think these prehistoric animals were alive on the screen. With Jurassic World, just about everything was computer generated, and its not that believable. Sad to say, the special effects in 1993 were better than what we got in 2015. And you think it would have been the other way around. Jurassic Park holds up, even after all these years.

As for the Jurassic World Limited Edition Gift Set, well I am impressed. The Model T-Rex and I- Rex are very well done and I feel they are better than the Hasbro toy line released back in May.  The sculpts are well done, paint job is good. Packaging is lovely and I am happy to add this to my Jurassic Park Collection.",1449014400,,1250,4.4605263157894735

6691792,4,B00NYC65M8,"I liked this movie better than I expected to.  The action was great and it reminded me why I liked the first movie, especially since it had a few nods back to the original.  Once again, we are reminded that we can't control everything as the dinosaurs that were re-created (or in the case of the main dinosaur, a conglomeration of several dinos with a few other quirks thrown in) get out of their cages and run amok.  Even knowing that was going to happen, this movie still had a few surprises.  The special effects were terrific, the characters were (for the most part) interesting, and the bad guys get what's theirs in the end...the fools who think they can use their creations for their own ends, rather than treating them as real, living creatures.

As usual, a bit of blood and maybe too violent at times for the little kids, but an enjoyable romp overall.  I'd certainly watch another one.",1449014400,,896,4.53416149068323

6691837,4,B00NYC65M8,"I don't understand how anyone could dislike this movie. I mean MAYBE if you come into it cold and have never heard of the franchise, you hate dinosaurs, and you hate Chris Pratt, but that's crazy talk. I don't understand how anyone could hate either. Anyway, I digress. My son and I have counted down the days until Jurassic World was released. We watched for Facebook posts, explored the website, and followed the Easter Eggs online every time there was new information about the film available. When we finally went to the Drive-In to see it, we were beyond excited! The action starts pretty early-on in the film and pretty much doesn't stop. I enjoyed the pacing of the film a lot. Although almost 100% of the effects are CGI, it didn't annoy me. I did notice that there is very little blood. If you're concerned about it being appropriate for kids, I don't think it's any worse than the original, although plenty of people seem to disagree with me. You had more blood AND gore in Jurassic Park, and minus one spray of blood into leaves (from violence you don't see), there is barely any blood in Jurassic World at all. In Jurassic Park there's one particularly brutal/out in the open death (the lawyer) and there is a death that mirrors that in JW. There's also a pretty gnarly severed arm in Jurassic Park (Laura Dern/raptor scene), but there's nothing even close to that in Jurassic World. I think the T-Rex/Jeep scene in Jurassic Park is by far, the scariest scene of either movie. The moral to the story is, if you let your kids watch Jurassic Park, then don't worry about allowing them to watch Jurassic World. They'll be fine.

SPOILERS BELOW -

The *only* two things that were even remotely off with the movie had nothing to do with the dinosaurs. The first thing that I thought was 'off' was Chris Pratt and Bryce Howard's first kiss. It was weird. It was like watching two happily married people pretend to kiss (which is exactly what it was). The other was Vincent D'onofrio's death scene. It came off fake and kind of lame. I didn't believe it.

Other than that? Love it. It's a fun movie just like Jurassic Park was. Don't pick it to pieces. It's a dinosaur movie, not The English Patient.",1449014400,,2205,4.563131313131313

6691875,5,B00NYC65M8,"After reading all the 1- and 2-star reviews, I'll admit I was prepared to be disappointed with this movie. I've seen Jurassic Park at least 100 times (easily - it's my favorite movie of all time), and I thought there was NO way this movie could live up to the first one. I was sure the over-use of CGI would ruin it (like many movies today). I was on the lookout for all the ridiculous things other reviewers pointed out - the high heels, the ""trained"" raptors, the annoying kids, the scenes lifted right out of the first movie, etc. Honestly, I went into this thing trying to be hopeful...but deep down I knew I was going to hate it.

And you know what? I LOVED it. I loved just about every minute of it. And this from someone who can almost recite the entire first movie by heart(seriously). This is one time that I'm SO glad I ignored the nay-sayers and bought the Blu-Ray. Here's WHY I loved this movie:

As soon as the music started (the same score from Jurassic Park) and the camera panned across the island and park - it was like coming home again. I KNOW how ridiculously cheesy that sounds, but it's the truth. The music is absolutely GORGEOUS throughout the movie - kudos to them for sticking with the iconic theme. I loved that it's set on the same island, with many of the iconic settings from the first movie. And, there's the dinosaurs. They went back to the original movie for the look and feel of the dinosaurs, so much so that when ""Rex"" finally makes an appearance I SWEAR it was the same fella from the first movie. Everything about the look Jurassic World felt authentic to Jurassic Park, and as a long-time fan I was completely moved.

And this movie was FUNNY. Once the action got going, I was laughing and cheering the whole way through. Sure, parts of it were unrealistic, but overall it was HUGELY entertaining. There aren't many movies lately that I've truly just enjoyed for pure entertainment value, but this was definitely one of them. The CGI completely blends into the movie, so much so that I couldn't tell what was real and what wasn't - and as a result those dinosaurs were awesome. The entire movie felt like this wild roller coaster ride - and as soon as it was over I immediately watched it again. It was just...FUN.

At the same time, I also loved that Jurassic World had the same 'questioning science' theme as the first movie. My favorite quote of all time comes from the first movie (""your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should."") - and that's carried over into the new movie (""These people...they never learn""). Science without ethics is a dangerous thing, and Jurassic World definitely reopens that debate, as well as raising interesting questions about animal rights. A lot of it is straightforward, like the obvious stupidity of creating a hybrid dinosaur based solely on ""wow"" factors. But there are also a lot of subtle scenes that make very powerful commentaries on our society today. The amusement park in the movie may seem like something completely over the top - except that I can totally see kids riding saddled baby dinos as something people wouldn't think twice about. Or the comments about the detrimental effects of raising animals in isolation (and other not-so-subtle digs at SeaWorld). So while Jurassic World may be a sci-fi action/thriller on the surface, underneath it has the same intelligence as the first movie. VERY well done, IMO.

And...the acting wasn't nearly as bad as I was led to believe. I actually liked Bryce Dallas Howard's character because she's exactly what I would expect a corporate exec to be in this situation. The teenage boy was annoying - because he's a teenage boy. But the two brothers together were endearing, and on the whole I think they did a better job than the kids in JP two & three. Vincent D'Onofrio and BD Wong are fantastic as the morally bankrupt bad-guys, and the supporting cast all did a great job of making me actually care whether they got eaten or not.

On the whole I loved this movie. It's a fantastic tribute to the original Jurassic Park (which is STILL the best of the bunch), but at the same time it's a wildly fun ride all in it's own right. Don't judge this one based on the bad reviews. See it for yourself - you may end up unexpectedly blown away like I was!",1448841600,3,4346,4.551150895140665
6691876,3,B00NYC65M8,"I thought the story could have been waay better. That's why i didn't like the movie.
The dinosaurs escaped because of incompetence and that bugged me. The first jurassic park movie made sense because it was plausible. The bad-guy wanted money from dinosaur eggs and was willing to risk the lives of people for that money. This movie failed the plausibility test for me because the dinosaurs out smarted their cages. Silly. Also, too many good guys were eaten for my personal taste.

IMO, here's a better plot: The park is setup and is running well, blah blah. But some for-hire criminals are paid millions by a mysterious person to steal some dinosaurs from the park. They break in at night with high tech bad guy equipment and because of this, some dinosaurs escape their cages, some bad guys get eaten, good guys use dinosaurs cleverly to defend themselves. One or two bad guys escape for sequel setup.",1448841600,,904,4.7215189873417724

It's a bit of a shame that they don't *really* explore the whole deterministic/fatalist nature aspect that Crichton got to in the books.  The dumbed-down pop psych nature/nurture stuff is ok I guess for the mass-market audience, but I am highly skeptical that a behavioral psychologist from the Navy would be the go-to choice.

While I realize that you can never recreate the awe and originality of the original Jurassic Park, I expected more than this.  I imagine that the writers were a bunch of 15 year old boys who said, ""let's remake the first one, but with lots of graphics and a SUPER T-Rex""! Anybody who thinks this was a 5-star movie has no taste. They are simpletons who are easily impressed by CGI.  (Maybe the writers were trying to appeal to today's over-stimulated youth.) The acting is mediocre and there are way, way too many ""oh, come on!"" moments. The central premise of the movie is that they are COMPLETELY unprepared for a genetically engineered SUPER T-Rex to cause problems. Oh gee, what do we do now..... Who could have foreseen this?  And then, the final fight scene is completely ridiculous.  (And a minor point I just thought of is the cost of this park. If Disneyland costs $100 a day per person, this park would have to charge like $10,000 bucks a day given all of the stuff they have...

Really this is about the dinosaurs and getting to see fragments of Jurassic Park. That alone makes it worth while to me.",1448668800,,473,4.314606741573034

6691977,3,B00NYC65M8,"Jurassic world is visually stunning. I think of it as a reboot of the Jurassic environment with Hollywood saying ""check out what we can do now that technology has advanced quite a bit since the first was released.""

The storyline is the basic Jurassic experience. Invite a bunch of people to an island to see the dinosaurs. A sea world type park is opened to the public. After no incidents, things begin to become stale so the park's leaders up the ante. They genetically modify a dinosaur to be more powerful than a T. rex with camouflage abilities and intelligence far surpassing other dinosaurs. As you would imagine, it escapes and begins destroying everything and anything in its path.

One of the trainers is sent out to save two lost guests and take down the new dinosaur. With the help of velociraptors he trained, they work to take the new breed down. It is tougher than anyone realized, which puts everyone on the island at risk.

The movie delivers a quick, action packed ride that keeps you interested. It falls way short with the ending. Spoiler: during the epic final battle, a T. rex teams up with a velociraptor to take down the new monster down. After they win, the two monsters go about their business away from the attack. Why? We don't know. They do not kill for sport, which makes sense. But why wouldn't they attack each other or the humans out of hunger? Or to prove dominance? This huge gap in the ending seemed like an incredibly lazy way to end the movie. Why try to explain things when you can brush them under the rug and hope no one notices. Almost insults the intelligence of the viewers. They went 99% of the way, and fell flat at the last minute.",1448582400,4,1678,4.5131578947368425

Not only that, it was just so much fun, especially with Chris Pratt. I also liked Bryce Dallas Howard, once she got over being the over-ambitious park director.

Then there was good old Vince DOnofrio, or as I still think of him, Gomer Pyle from Full Metal Jacket. No matter what he acts in, he cant rid himself of his trademark mannerisms, which were in full bad-guy glory as one of the mysterious corporate goons. Its hard to even imagine him as a good guy like he played on Law And Order.

I became completely absorbed in the story and didn't mind or even think much about plot holes, illogical science, or what have you, even in the end with the blatant cues for a sequel. A lot of critics panned the movie. I can see why, but you know what? I could care less. I don't go to movies to be either educated or to get my art fix.

Well, I had hoped for more than this. But what we received is basically a remake of Jurassic Park 2. It starts off with the traditional screeds.....Anti-corporate, anti-capitalist, and anti-military. Toss in some naturalist themes and this is what you get...

Our characters are without any charisma, they are introduced with the classic memes. Angry, abusive dad, with over-worked and sensitive wife send their kids on a trip to the new Jurassic World Park. They get there and the themes are laid on heavily. Let the games begin!

Our Hero:  ""so, you are only doing this for profit?""....
Our Corporate villain:  ""It's what the people want! Do what ever it takes to make the money!""
Our Hero:  ""Life is more than that, we need to treat humans, and Nature without worrying about profit"" (camera pans low as our hero walks towards a shiny new Mercedes benz...slow pan....freeze frame on Mercedes Symbol...reverse camera...pan again..slow....low angle.....wait, wait, wait...)
Our Hero: ""It's not about money!!"" (sips a can of coke...close up....hold frame with can)
Repeat this throughout the whole movie.

Odd that a film made by for profit by a huge corporation, featuring product placement as a prime ingredient,  is preaching against exactly that.

Don't forget to throw in the ""we need to use dinosaurs as military weapons"". And all of the drama about a conspiracy to do just that. Blah, blah, blah.

Anyway, if you are under 13 years of age, you will love the action sequences....they are well done. But the original Jurassic park was able to get the same theme in with some subtlety. And the original had a stellar cast. When they created part 2....they spent the whole movie selling Mercedes SUVs. That is exactly what you have here....Oh, and shame on you for being greedy!",1448496000,10,1831,5.013201320132013

The detail is outstanding. They are some of the best representations of a JP T-Rex and the JW Indominus I have seen. They are made of the same type material as the Papo and Safari dinosaurs, and look good next to them. They are not connected, so they can be displayed together or separate. The Indominus is slightly bigger than the T-Rex, which goes along with the movie depictions.  Over all I am very pleased with the items.",1448409600,,590,4.514018691588785

I hadn't read any reviews or seen any trailers (because I like a surprise), but I probably should have. This is not a detailed re-imagining or a heart-felt character drama written within a veiled backdrop of a sequel, nor is it an imaginative premise, like the world 50 years after the last movie, in a war against Jurassic monsters run amok, it's just the same old story; they've engineered dinosaurs, created a theme park, invited family who are conveniently in the wrong place when something goes wrong.

6692090,3,B00NYC65M8,"Oh, where to begin without giving away the story.  If you've seen the first three, you probably already know the story.  The reason I watched it?  I'm a sucker.  Plus it has the dude from parks and recreation and guardian's of the galaxy in it, so... that was a plus.

*SPOILER ALERT** (sort of)

WHY do they keep creating Raptors?  Didn't they watch the other three movies?  Its always the raptors that cause trouble.  Always.  Now, I will admit, it was nice to see a different twist on that particular part of the story right there, but still - WHY?

Any place with dinosaurs is not a place for children, people!  Stop bringing your kids to Isla Nublar or where ever.

How did they even get that place open again?  I mean wow... Six flags has a ride that kills someone and no one wants to go to Six Flags any more.  But people are flocking to the very place where so many people died being eaten by dinosaurs.

I guess after 3 of the same movie its a bit hard to continue to suspend my disbelief and really get into it.  Was it a good movie?  Sure.  Was it more then that?  No... the first one was spectacular (but the book was still better).  Then... it started to lose its luster.

Oh, and I can already predict where the *next* Jurassic movie is going (Yes, they did leave it open for yet another sequel).  Here's a hint, INGEN has gone military.  You're welcome.

My favorite line from the movie is:  ""Watch your six, Raptors have a new Alpha"" - because NO ONE saw that coming *sigh*.",1448409600,,1490,4.2888086642599275

6692100,1,B00NYC65M8,"Let me state that a film such as this should be thrilling and entertaining but also possess a degree of believability. That is to say that the people in the audience after being handed the science fact jargon from the on screen scientists experts. That the audience then has a sense that what they are seeing on the screen has a chance of actually happening, under certain circumstances it could happen.  NOT the case here!  First of all the so called experts in this film on creature behavior in this film, offer their theories on how these creature behave in the wild.  Yet multiple gross misrepresentations appear on the screen in this film.

The truth is!! Predator creatures with sharp fangs and teeth have a distinct respect for each other, they try to keep a distance from each other, unless their young are threatened. But this film hands us the idiotic belief that two huge T-Rex dinosaurs, one even larger would charge at each other for no reason is pure moronic nonsense! The Producers of this film should learn about the behavioral patterns of species not just make up their own stupid scenario of what would happen.

The absurdity of this film goes even further , a scene where a six foot Raptor attacks this fifty foot super T-rex. While the hero T-Rex is fighting with it. Oh, then we have Owen the hero if this film unload a dozen rounds or more from his high powered rifle directly at this super predator without it even flinching is all out hilarious stupidity. The creature is made of flesh and bone, its not made of steel and concrete. A few well-placed shots would bring the creature down.

Then to add to the moronic story of this film a military character Hoskins wants to use the Raptors as the ultimate fighting machines to attack enemy soldiers and then sell the Raptors to military leaders. First of all the Raptors would not obey the humans dumb enough to try this. Secondly an enemy soldier with a machine gun could take out a dozen charging Raptors with ease. Today its about high tech war fare!!
Like I said this film has the believability of a Looney Tunes cartoon, not to degrade the Looney Tunes cartoons, for at least they are not attempting the pull the wool over the audiences eyes and manipulate them into believing that what they put on the screen could remotely happen like the producers of Jurassic World have done.",1448323200,6,2356,4.610978520286396

6692188,3,B00NYC65M8,"Good special effects and action,but no character development.  The  actors playing the children were  adequate.

6692189,5,B00NYC65M8,"One thing that the previous Jurassic Park movies did, which I feel hurt their overall quality in my eyes, was attempting to stick to a serious, keep you on the edge of your seat story line.  It's a movie about DINOSAURS killing a bunch of people (most of whom have it coming); to me there is no way to make that a totally serious topic without losing the audience.  They made claymation dinosaur-eat-man movies back in the day which I enjoy watching more than Jurassic Park II & III.

This addition to the series kept all of the suspense and thrill of Jurassic Park and intertwining that with over the top, often ludicrous, yet engaging scenes and plot twists.  The plot progression was fairly predictable, which was to be expected, but what came out at the end was a vastly entertaining use of 3 hours of my life.",1448236800,,814,4.47972972972973

6692197,4,B00NYC65M8,"Maybe it's my memory but I did not think this movie was that much more sophisticated (special effects) than Jurassic Park in the 1990s.  It's not what I consider worlds apart in any major aspects, including plot.  But there was a difference in casting.  The male lead roll (Chris Pratt) is considerably better than his counterparts (look-wise) in the Jurassic Park series.  However, the female lead roll appeared considerably less attractive as far as her wardrobe and hair was concerned in Jurassic World as compared with her counterparts in Jurassic Park.  For a big budget movie like this they should've done a better job at casting and appearances.",1448236800,,652,5.0

The sequels were not bad, wasn't a huge fan of Jurassic Park 3 though. Jurassic World on the other hand was pretty disappointing compared to the others. I don't mind some CGI if done right, but compared to the original Jurassic Park the effects stunk. Sorry, but to me the dinosaurs looked pretty dang real in first 2 movies. In Jurassic World they just looked so fake and poorly done. The raptors looked blue to me for some reason; maybe its the lighting in the movie? I will say the scenery was beautiful in this movie. The environments looked great and nice details on the theme park. I was surprised by the violence in this one as well, quite a bit of blood in this for PG-13. Wasnt a huge fan of the story or the characters, but I did enjoy a few moments. I do think its better than Jurassic Park 3 in some ways. I was not a huge fan though, Im glad I rented it. I can see now why stores had 50 unsold copies for sale. Its an ok entry, but nothing compares to the original. Id say rent it.",1448236800,2,1164,4.109649122807017

The plot was trite (corporate greed created out of control super creature), and the acting was just about as flat as the acting in the Star Wars prequels.  If I hadn't been watching it with friends, I would have watched something else, however after a while, I got used to the luke warm acting/plot, and managed enjoy the effects and sound track.  Of course the visual effects are first-rate, state of the art from ILM, and the sound track effects are really good, made more interesting because I have a tactile transducer attached to my sofa.

Chris Pratt did a very good job.  Being an old person, you get used to the 'old' actors but some of these young actors are pretty darn good.  I bought the movie for ME.

6692302,3,B00NYC65M8,"It's easy-enough to imagine an office-floor full of computer-animators, each specializing in a texture, or illumination, etc.,...and sipping green teas and lattes', and trying to finish on-schedule. I'm glad for these actors that they had work. And i'm a big fan of Irfan Kahn ever since 'Life of Pi'.
~also a fan of Vince Dinofrio. But not enough to ignore the need for good writing. Good writing gives us the reason to care about the kids in this story who're trying not to be eaten by dinosaurs. Simple-enough. But this story puts them in clear, plastic bubbles and rolls them like giant bubble-gums onto the grass where the escaped super-mean, super-hungry, super-saurus is LOOSE!  This new chapter tells us that genetic experiments with these dinos has made them EXTRA smart. Oh, and the raptors are now hunting WITH their human trainers on motorcycles.
Hey, why not? The next chapter will have the Terminator, an Alien, a Predator, the Expendables, an Avatar, Elvis,...and a hologram of Gene Kelly

Some people said shows women in poor light but then again, if a man was a workaholic and couldn't tell the age of his nephews no one would be surprised.  Ladies (and I am female) you can't have it both ways, if men and women are equal then they may be equally self-centered.

To be sure, it's a great movie for that target demographic of people with short attention spans. I am always impressed to see directors and writers so well define their target of the lower market. Certainly, they deserve entertainment as much as anybody else. As usual, the directors take a shot at the military, and employers (corporations),  Remarkably, and to their credit, they don't throw in the obligatory homosexual relationships, the race baits, or the omnipresent pornification of children. They throw in plenty of vilography as their principal titilating component. Lots of great CGI if you are into that....remarkable in many regards.",1448064000,5,809,5.271317829457364

6692388,5,B00NYC65M8,"I hadn't seen this in the theater when it first came out early in 2015 so I really didn't know what to expect. I had only seen one of the trailers. So basically, I ordered the 3D Blu-ray based on that and the hype the movie had generated. Given the quality of the other sequels (II & III), my expectations weren't all that high.
Let me tell you: This one has almost as many suspenseful moments as the original ""Jurassic Park"", but a lot more action and the special effects are waaaaay better. The original was great but after 20 years it looks somewhat dated. I was blown away by the quality of the 3D; sometimes I thought the creatures were going to leap out of the TV! I'm surprised that it got a PG-13 rating because some of the scenes were a little intense due to their graphic (not gorey) nature . Movies of this genre aren't usually my favorite but this one was definitely worth it!",1448064000,3,888,4.291666666666667

6692408,5,B00NYC65M8,Loved this movie personally. It reminded me when I was a kid in the 90's and seeing the first one for the first time and getting goosebumps of how epic it was. Had my doubts at first but pretty much went in blind watching the movie. I think the homage they pay to the original is perfect. Some of the logic is sometimes flawed but not out of this world. Overall if you go in thinking about the original version with that same 90's mentality but with 2015 CGI and directing I think it can be a great flick. And Chris Pratt.,1448064000,,522,4.127450980392157

6692489,3,B00NYC65M8,"When the first Jurassic Park came out, it was totally unprecedented and totally amazing. By the third movie, it just wasn't that amazing anymore. Once you've seen CGI dinosaurs you can't un-see them. Even though it's been something like 14 years since the last movie, I found this movie to be really boring, and in many ways a ripoff of version #1. You had the DNA lab, the ""educational"" content and dialog explaining in painfully little detail what the science was about, the little kids in harm's way, the really cool guy and the really neurotic geeky chick who turns out to be Indiana Jones' female counterpart.

If you are going to base your like or dislike for this movie solely on special effects then it's totally amazing, dude. But if you're looking for any kind of depth of story or depth of character, forget it. It's about as deep as Honey Boo Boo.",1448064000,3,859,4.577922077922078

6692519,5,B00NYC65M8,"Jurassic World did not disappoint! This has all of the out of control action that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The Jurassic formula is: People with the wrong agenda, people with a conscience opposing them, bean counters trying to make money, with innocents caught in the cross-fire. The formula works, so they did it again.

The park Jurassic World is running smoothly, but losing its edge. The owners decide to get Dr. Wu to create something, bigger, meaner, and more teeth, so they make a hybrid T-Rex, who has attributes of T-Rex, Raptors and other carnivores, only bigger. The only thing is that this animal is hyper-intelligent. and soon breaks out of containment. Chaos ensues, and yes, the beast eats people. This has some interesting twist that you will love, but I won't spoil it for you. I loved this one as much as any of the others,",1448064000,,851,4.635761589403973

6692532,2,B00NYC65M8,"Bryce Dallas Howard spends the entire movie in high heels!  She's running from dinosaurs in high heels!  High heels that she still has on by the end of the movie!

Holy cats, can they make a more unlikeable character?  And they killed her assistant who the kids ditched, like they were killing Saddam Hussein.  The pterodactyls grab her and tear at her and she almost drowns in the pool (how deep is that pool by the way?) and then that huge sea monster eats her.

Her boss, BDH, behaves essentially like the bad guy in some movies, she's the selfish incompetent uncaring corporate drone, whose negligence gets hundreds of people killed--what happens to her? A life lesson learned and a hunky new boyfriend--her heels on her shoes don't even break.  Her underpaid assistant, who she forces to babysit her terrible nephews who she can't even stand, gets ditched by the kids--so she's a horrible monster and has to die in the worst way possible.

I mean Vincent D'Onofrio doesn't get it that bad and he was trying to weaponize the dinosaurs and got a bunch of people killed(which doesn't that seem like something Vincent D'Onofrio might be doing in real life--trying to weaponize dinosaurs--he gives off that type of vibe.)

This is clearly a message from the makers of this movie to their personal assistants and nannies--don't you dare ignore our spoiled children we left in your care because we have to ignore them to make terrible dinosaur movies so that other parents can take their kids to them so they can ignore their terrible children.  And so the cycle continues!

It's the careless assistant who has to suffer the worst!  Her horrific boss (I'm sorry any person who wears an outfit like that is a monster) gets a fat pension and some navy seal dinosaur trainer as her boyfriend.  Navy seal dinosaur trainer--adorable.  They just make any character they want to glorify and not have to explain their impossible skills with back story an ex military guy.

Also, wasn't it hilarious that everyone just ditched that guy in a tree trunk in the middle of the jungle in the middle of the night with all these killer dinosaurs everywhere?  Awesome.  He didn't even have a flashlight,  Good luck getting home, jerk.  I didn't see him in the warehouse at the end.  He's probably still sitting in that tree thinking, they're going to come back for me right?

Was the younger kid on the spectrum?  Was that what they were trying to convey?  Or was that kid actor just high all the time?

Didn't it seem like an infomercial for the resort at the beginning of the movie?  These grand shots of the boat arriving and of taking the tram through the gates and going into the hotel room and going out on to the balcony with that crappy theme blaring. Was this movie just an ad for a new theme park Universal is developing?

Not to mention-- Is it too much to ask from these jerks in Hollywood to kill a few kids every once and a while?  It's torture from the beginning of the movie with kids as main characters because you know NOTHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO THEM.  So there is no suspense, because NOTHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO THEM.

I give this movie 2 stars because there were a few kind of fun scenes of dinosaurs attacking imaginary people.  Keep in mind I would have given 4 stars to the movie that just showed all of the actors and producers and writers and directors pushed down a flight of stairs.  One at a time, not a steep terrible staircase, but you know 12 to 15 stairs, preferably no carpet.  I don't want anyone to die or break a bone, just a little bruised and battered and upset and humiliated.  No dinosaurs necessary.  Who knows--maybe for the sequel?",1448064000,2,3661,4.555895865237366

6692566,4,B00NYC65M8,"I know I've heard quite a few people say they don't love this movie, and I didn't think I would either. I loved the first Jurassic Park (as we all did), hated the 2nd, and didn't care much for the 3rd. When I saw the previews of Chris Pratt ""riding"" WITH raptors, I thought for sure I would hate this one. I mean, I know it's an unrealistic movie, but working WITH them just seemed ridiculous. However, when I saw the movie, it seemed to work with the story.
As far as the personal relationships in the story, I wasn't a huge fan. The whole divorcing parents storyline just didn't flow with the story. It really did nothing to develop the boys' relationship - the Indominous Rex was the one who helped that relationship. And the romance between the main characters was also unimportant to the storyline. But this is a big-budget movie - there has to be some sort of love interest story in there. I did like the supporting cast in this - I think they actually helped the storylines a bit throughout. Other than the assistant/babysitter - she was pointless.
Overall, I like the movie. The special effects were great. The dinosaurs were amazing (as they always are!). The personal storylines were subpar, but this is not the movie that you expect to bring an Oscar winning performance or storyline with it. I think most of us just expect an entertaining, over-the-top, special-effects laden movie. And it definitely delivered on those aspects.",1447977600,7,1440,4.650980392156863

6692576,5,B00NYC65M8,"While it is not the only Jurassic Park sequel, I think it is definitely the best of them. Part of the appeal is that it goes back to, and actually opens the original park. So there are a lot of tie ins to the original movies. Some subtle (like the t-shirt worn by the control room guy) to not so subtle (like going back to the original visitor's center).

This time around the park is running and functional, and run by Bryce Dallas Howard's character Claire. We learn that as a part of keeping the park fresh new dinosaurs (attractions) are being created, and this time engineering dinosaurs that did not really exist. Of course exactly what could go wrong does go wrong, and the typical action that has accompanied all the movies ensues. Of course the Raptors are central to the story line again, which is where Chris Pratt's character Owen comes in. In a nice tie back to the original movie BD Wong returns as the head scientist making many of the same mistakes he made (and more) in the original film, and the movie definitely teases a larger role for his character in the eventual sequel(s).

While the chances are good that many reading this review will have already seen the movie, I will not spoil it for those who do not. What I can say beyond what I already have is that the dinosaurs are the main characters of the movie, but it is very well acted by all the actors involved. Chris Pratt has really cemented his leading man status that started in Guardians of the Galaxy. He is able to do a complete 180 degree switch from his doofus Parks and Rec character and be a stern action hero, but still bring some quick witted snark to the film as well. It would not worked nearly as well if he and Bryce Dallas Howard did not play their characters as well as they did, and the two did not have (or were not able to fake) the chemistry they seemed to have.

While I do think the movie fell into the trap of trying to get too cute with matching the story from the first movie (Claire's nephews being out in the park alone in danger, the large unstoppable dinosaur that gets loose etc) it did a lot to stand on its own too. And I do think that going forward the movies will be a lot less like the original movie and more of their own thing.

For those who get the blu ray, the movie looks and sounds great as you would expect. There are quite a few behind the scenes and making of features, as well as some deleted scenes and a ""close shaves"" feature which shows some of the near death experiences from all 4 of the movies in the franchise. Probably a couple hours worth of extra material in all, which is not bad for a 2 hr movie. If you get the limited edition version it comes in a circular tin case that sits on a cardboard sleeve. It is not the best packaging ever, and is more meant to actually sit on its own on a shelf than be stuck sideways with a bunch of other DVDs.

If you are generally a fan of the franchise I think you will enjoy this movie too. Especially if you were enjoyed Part III, because I think this is a lot better than that installment. It does suffer a little from copying the first movie, but it is not a blatant shot for shot ripoff. I would definitely recommend it.",1447977600,3,3197,4.2344262295081965

I could not wait,  and although I was in awe when I saw this, and to not spoil anything, I was just not a fan of the last 30 minutes. The models included are fantastic, I have yet to take a closer look at the included model, but so far I really like them; the packaging is really nice as well. I won't be opening the box just yet, but if I do, I will update my review on everything else.

The plot is void of any substance, and full of annoying conveniences... It gets to be too much. Also, I know they wanted to pay respect to the original, but it stops being an Easter egg if it's not hidden and a plot driving device. Ugh...

Other than the addition of Chris Pratt to the cast, what is really the point of another CG dinosaur movie...other than to make the movie studios lots of money? This seemed more like a set up for the WWF of digital dinosaurs: In this corner we have formerly extinct T-REX & in this corner we have a superior enhanced genetically spliced ultimate dinosaur that can also blend in with its surroundings...what could possibly go wrong?  I saw this at the theater opening night & enjoyed the time I spent at the movies, but it's pretty much the same movie as its predecessors with slightly different scenarios.

6692688,4,B00NYC65M8,"I have seen all 3 previous Jurassic films and this is reported to be the best.  In my opinion the best ones was the first one and the third one.  The
second one was entertaining but I like the others better.  This fourth one I rate with the second one; it is entertaining but nothing new had been
added; or at least nothing pronounced.  There is some new twists but the basic theme remains the same: a Park with a bunch of re-created animals
of the Jurassic age, but then some get loose and start munching the people.  There are the sweet Raptors who just love to terrorize the people;
maybe ISS will get some weird ideas. Anyhow there is a hero and some cute ladies and lots and lots of action.  The special effects are superb,
with a slightly new ending which was good.  No, I won't tell, some people think I blab too much (and I do!) so I won't say more.  But there is not
enough to make me give it more than Four Stars.  Those who know something about Dinosaurs know that they could not survive in our atmosphere because the air (oxygen) is much thinner than it was in the Jurassic Age.  Still; we can dream can't we?  The thicker air is one of the reasons the
beasts were so big.  Six footDragonflys!!  This is  a good movie, very entertaining with splendid special effects one should enjoy.  And not  the
excessive violence or gore  we see in ordinary films.  It has been said another sequel is being made; Hell, if it makes money, why not? But I
will wait for the DVD.  I got the complete set with the standard, blu ray and 3D DVDs in it. (From Amazon).  FOUR STARS. Enjoy!",1447718400,,1580,4.255892255892256

An example writing element that is crap: stories have to have reasonable bad guys.  Like, guys you can imagine doing what they are doing.  You can totally see a nerdy tech dude stealing some embryos and accidentally breaking the park, as was done in the first movie.  How about a random security guard that thinks velociraptors have significant military value and unleashes some that are clearly not fully trained on a situation that clearly does not call for small predators?  Not so much.  Hollywood hates the military enough that they assume they can write a character that makes no sense whatsoever as long as they associate him with military.

6692789,3,B00NYC65M8,"[This review is for the 3D version with a Sony Passive 3D 4K TV with DirecTV.]

I've probably seen every ""Jurassic Park"" film, including the 20-year anniversary post-production 3D version, which actually looked really good.  So, I was to some degree looking forward to watching this ""reboot"" or ""remake,"" or whatever-you-want-to-call-it, although I was pretty skeptical at the same time.  I just knew that, most likely, the story would be pretty lame, but the special effects would be great.  I was mostly right.

It is hard to be picky with this film, because the 3D does look pretty terrific, and the dinosaurs look oh so much more real than the ones created back in 1994.  The image was a little bit on the grainy side, however, and I have seen some other 3D movies with the same hardware setup that looked really good.  But it's just that this film ""borrows"" from the previous movies too much, and the ""cute"" jokes just don't quite work the second or third time around.  Why don't they come up with something new?

Instead of a car going up and down on a couple of kids here, you'll see a gyroscope vehicle -- or whatever it's called -- go up and down on a couple of kids instead.  And you'll see dinosaurs chasing cars; and relatives going out in the field to save some children, although of course, at key points, the children are smarter than the adults to appease the 12-year-old-boy audience.  It's really just the same old, same old, and I just think that the writers were a little lazy on this film.  But what's worse:  some of the dialog.  I was rolling my eyes more than some of the dinosaurs, especially at the beginning of the film.  The dialog just isn't very believable.

What would be really nice to see:  how about if this technology were used to create a really good documentary about dinosaurs instead, something that is believable, something that doesn't involve humans?  Perhaps the average audience member wouldn't be interested, but I would pay to see something like that.  Either that, or create a dinosaur park where the you-know-what DOESN'T always just hit the fan?  That might be worth a peek.

Well, I'm sure this series isn't over yet, but it probably should be.  They just keep recycling material over and over again, and you'd think that, after 75 million years or so, somebody could come up with something new.  You'd be wrong.",1447632000,3,2362,4.6521739130434785

6692830,5,B00NYC65M8,"The product was everythings id hoped it would be :) The movie itself (which I saw in IMAX on opening weekend) brought a tear to my eye when the music swells and your overlook the new park for the first time as I saw the stories i grew up on come back to life. Its a perfect combination of the new and a love letter to the old. My only critisisms would be romance arc between Clair and Owen taking up too much screen time. But I came for dinosaurs and was not disappointed. This time the dinosaurs are more than threats to drive human protagonists, they're their own characters. Especially the velociraptor Blue, Indominus, and [spoiler] the T-Rex making her triumphant return from movie legacy at the film's climax. Included is a (relatively small) certificate of authenticity.

The product itself is a great additon to any collection. The shiny metal case for the disks is eye catching. But of course the statues are what you want me to talk about. Theyre not quite as detailed in person as they look in the photos but are still awesome figures. Indominus is, true to canon, the larger statue in every way and therefore more detailed. But careful her tail when handling the product! It juts out from the rest of the statue even more than it looks in the photo and could catch on something, especially if you're not keeping her and Rex together. These are resin statues, so while surprisingly hardy (and with minimal flex in smaller parts of the statue) they should still be handled with care and kept up & away from pets and children.",1447632000,,1535,4.541516245487364

6692844,4,B00NYC65M8,"It's been almost twenty years since Jurassic Park and now we have a new park. Let's start with the fact that in order to enjoy this movie you need to suspend all reality. It is science fiction after all so for all those who comment that it is not factual and this could never happen...of course not-that is why it is called science fiction, for now. The musical score is breathtaking, far better than the first. There is also a far more human element especially when the brontosaurus dies...I must admit I cried and now I have to skip that scene. The four key principles do a stellar job in their portrayal of each character (Pratt, Bryce-Howard, Robinson and Simpkins). Pratt is exceptional in his portrayal to play it almost borderline ""cartoonish"" but stops just short that he is a ""bad ass"" as Zach (Robinson) describes him. Visuals are astounding and the action is fairly non stop. There is one issue that I really have an issue with and I am going to contradict myself about suspending reality. I watched Jurassic Park after watching (again) Jurassic World. In JP, the Velociraptors are seen as the primary enemy--they are, according to history, one of the more aggressive and fearsome of all dinosaurs. In JW, the Velociraptors are treated like a trained pack of dogs---a ""family"" pet as if they wish to snuggle with you on the couch. These creatures have gone from one of the most harmful to being domesticated. No sense of disbelief can make that believable in any way-and in my opinion, and again it is MY OPINION, that is what makes the movie falter. I am willing to buy into all other suspension of belief but that one, at least to me, is over the top and made me far more critical of the film.",1447632000,2,1706,4.5602605863192185

6692897,3,B00NYC65M8,"All I can really say is it's another just okay movie. Some the action scenes were fun to look at but there was awkward, almost video-game like quality to all the dinosaurs and some of the environment. I can very clearly see that what I'm looking at was made in a computer. In alot of ways, I think the original Jurassic Park clear back in 1993 had better dino-effects, especially that scene were the T-rex escaped and ate the lawyer, then what we get with Jurassic World.
The story was largely just one contrivance after another to get characters I didn't really care about from dino-chase scene to chase scene. They did kinda try to give these people a little depth later on but to me, they were more or less just serviceable for this kind of movie. Not saying Jurassic Park characters have ever been all that deep either, but at least they were memorable enough that decades later I can still remember their names, at least from the original.
This is another one were I say rent it, enjoy the dino-chaos and fight at the end, but it's not one that I would think about buying until it's on the discount rack. Better then JP 2 and 3, not as good as 1.
Oh, and apparently it still never occurs to anyone in this bazzillon dollar high tech animal theme park to dig some blasted moats around the animal enclosures to keep the things in, you know, like every other zoo does! Sheesh...",1447632000,19,1380,4.415686274509804

Verified that 2 different BD players, one LG and Pioneer, both have current firmware installed  Tested the Blu ray disc in the replacement set in both players, and it has the same flaw as the BD from the first set. No problems viewing BDs of movies of recent, new releases from other studios.

2 blu-ray discs in 2 different sets, delivered 2 weeks apart indicates a bad production run by Paramount.

Blu-ray disc was flawed.

You have to watch every preview to get to the actual movie menu.  Selecting ""Play"" merely played the menu trailer repeatedly without ever starting the movie. When trailer repeated, no menu was present.  Selecting other options menu, like language or subtitles didn't return to the movie menu or play movie after making a selection.

It has great actors and actresses playing the roles of the characters such as Chris Pratt and B.D. Wong, and even a Jimmy Fallon cameo, which I was totally geeking out about. I just feel that the CGI doesn't exactly cut it compared to the amazing use of animatronics in the first movie.  Also, I think that the whole Tyrannosaurus deal destroys the premise of the first movie, with it just walking away and getting in its cage, I guess. Another concern is that I feel the pterodactyl scene was a bit rushed and not thought through. So, Owen gets attacked by a dinosaur, Claire shoots it, they kiss, and all the big bad dinosaurs go away? It just was over way too soon. Another thing is that the product placement really catches your eye in this movie. I know that this movie must have been really expensive to make, but seriously? It's impossible to miss that Claire says ""Verizon Wireless presents the Indominus Rex."" Seriously. But don't let me give you any second thoughts on watching this movie.

The characters are useless and I still don't know why the two boys were in the movie. Their story line is pointless and contributes nothing. And yes, their Aunt really is running from raptors and beyond scary dinosaurs in heels for 2 hours. Chris Pratt is the saving grace but I just ended up continually asking why he would agree to be in this movie. Such a shame because had the script just been better this movie would have been great.

It did NOT have the AWE factor that only Jurassic Park had. The series got progressively worse after the original Jurassic Park movie. If I had it to do over again I probably would not purchase this movie. The advertisements built up a lot of hype, but the movie was a definite let down. Your opinion may be different. I buy movies from Amazon rather than seeing them in a theater full of rowdy patrons smoking cigarette's, talking on cell phones and drinking beer. And, for the price of a couple of theater tickets you can own the movie on Blu Ray. Amazon has great prices on DVD's and Blu Ray's.",1447459200,,772,4.398601398601398

I always felt like the original Jurassic Park was one of the best home theater experiences, and after buying the original in 3D and being impressed, I had a good feeling about this one. While I don't like the story to this movie as much as I do the classic, it was a fantastic experience. Another 3D movie I thought came out great as a 3D experience, and much to my surprise, was Pacific Rim. I'd also recommend that movie if you want to have a great immersive experience.

Also, if you haven't upgraded to at least 5.1 digital surround sound, you're missing out on a lot. I bought my Sony Bravia Home Theatre system on sale at Walmart for only like $400, many years back to compliment the 40"" Bravia XBR I'd bought way back then (that TV, a whopping $2,700 at the time of purchase, still has the best sounding built-in speakers I've ever heard on a TV, even better than my new one), but now I have the home theatre system hooked up to my new 70"" Bravia XBR UHD 3D TV, and I don't even see a reason to go to the movies anymore.

The action is amazing and it seems realistic in the idea of the whole storyline. Had Great graphics and animation of the dinos.

The action was great for me and my husband and the storyline the whole way was interesting and new.

I should have known that it would have not been the classic, but I was also disappointed by the size exaggeration of the Mosasaurus. It is ridiculous to think there could have ever been an organism this large, even living in an aquatic environment. I try to tell myself that it's a movie, but it's just kind of silly. I would probably give the movie three stars, but honestly I'm still a very loyal fan of the original move. All in all, it's worth a watch but don't expect the original.

Did anyone else realize that the female lead role ran in high heels the entire time? Also absurd.",1447200000,2,675,4.2734375

6693159,5,B00NYC65M8,"Full of action, loads of dinosaurs, some not-the-usual characters. Loved the visuals.

However, some plot devices were overused, the kids are sent by inattentive parents, then get into mischief which leads to danger! Sound familiar? It should. The leading man who is rebellious and defies the female boss which makes her love him in the end. Sound familiar? Yep. Also, those heels should have been kicked off in the first five minutes and I know it's a tiny detail but I just wanted to slap her for them. Although I liked the actress other than those stupid heels. She wasn't totally useless or helpless. That was nice.

Contrived things... too many. The protaginist dinosaur was too ridiculously overpowered with all it's powers. All it needed was to be half-elf and it would hit every ""Mary Sue"" mark. Even to the special pets if you count the raptors. Even to the special colors. Even the super intelligence! They should have toned some of that down. The explanations given were not just weak, they were certifiably stupid.

But even with all those issues, it was easy to enjoy the film and be excited and wonder if someone would get eaten(more main characters should have gotten eaten, just saying). The tech stuff was 'wow cool!' but not so outlandish to seem not real. Also, I'm a huge fan of T-rex so I was both sad and elated.

Watch the movie. Rent it at the very least.",1447113600,,1379,4.662551440329218

6693217,1,B00NYC65M8,"Cliche, predictable, and in the end nothing happened.  Film stops short of a ending.  Characters are entertaining but stale and static. The Jurassic Park series has always included an element of unbelievability but plausible, if you don't think about it too much.  Elements of this movie are just; weird.  Leaves the same questions unanswered and followed the identical plot line of the first movie.  (Scientist goes too far, park too afraid to act to save people)

Save your money, rewatch 1 or 2, or even 3!

Oh and the product placement in this film is disgustingly obtrusive.

Fans of the old films will appreciate seeing some familiar sights in one or two scenes, and will essentially be watching Jurassic Park 1 with a new cast and less of a plot

The movie ends two hours later with a feeling that nothing really happened, nothing was resolved and nothing was wrapped up.

6693323,5,B00NYC65M8,"If you don't take it too seriously, JURASSIC WORLD is surprisingly entertaining and fun. Visual effects have come a long way since JURASSIC PARK was released to get ready for some amazing dinosaurs and a visual taste treat on the island of Jurassic World.
The JURASSIC WORLD has overcome the Public Relations disaster created in JURASSIC PARK. Visitors can now safely enjoy the wonders of the dinosaur world. But, alas, people get tired of the run of the mill dinosaur and the same old thing so the owner urges scientists to create a super dinosaur to woo the tourists (seriously bad idea).
In JURASSIC PARK, our heroes are Sam Neil and Laura Dern, attractive in a normal way and believable as scientists. Finally, the heroes go beyond the hunk and babe clich. Unfortunately, JURASSIC WORLD takes us back to the Jurassic period for women. Chris Pratt is the hunk and an unrecognizable Bryce Dallas Howard is the babe in skirt and heels and an awful red wig (I first thought she was a Young Julianne Moore). There is a strong chemistry but for some reason never explained there is a tension from the one date they had. Needless to say, as the danger becomes more intense, the two realize their attraction and all is good in the world of love as long as the dinosaurs don't get them.
Back to our story, Super Dinosaur escapes and has been genetically modified with skills and defenses from all sorts of animals. He is a killing machine about to destroy the island and everyone on it. Will our muscled hunk and high-heeled lady save the day? Well, once the heels and jacket come off, our heroine's new anthem becomes, ""I am woman. Hear me Roar!""
Even if the story is clichd, JURASSIC WORLD is a stunning visual treat. Never mind the story, enjoy the visuals and just have some fun.",1447027200,3,1778,4.61198738170347

While the original concept of theme park gone bad stays true and is excellent, the remainder of the plot was just too out there. The militarization and hybridization concepts really blew the whole thing out of the water, that combined with an almost comical sense of predictability really were the downfall of this film. This isn't to say that Jurassic World was all bad, in fact there a few things that kept me entertained. I loved the way the park was conceptualized, the ""rides"" and attractions were all very visually pleasing. I also loved the tie ins to the original movie.

6693402,5,B00NYC65M8,"The original Jurassic Park was, and still is, one of my favorite movies of all time. The second JP was alright... not great though. With the abomination that was JP III, I was skeptical of Jurassic World, however it was exactly what it needed to be to revitalize the franchise and smashed the nail square on the head. Looking forward to seeing where they go now with the franchise - or they could simply let a hit be a hit and leave it alone... but who does that anymore?",1447027200,,471,4.303370786516854
6693403,5,B00NYC65M8,"I know that there were quite a few people that gave this movie subpar reviews and I'm not sure why. Compared to JP 2 and 3, this movie was light years better in storyline and graphics. Since purchasing this movie on release day, I've already watched it a couple of times and it still keeps my heart rate elevated and on the edge of my seat. I'm a huge Chris Pratt fan and this movie does a great job keeping his humor intact while still giving us an action filled movie. It was nice to see the writers pay homage to the original Jurassic Park and I do hope that there is a 4th movie in the works.",1447027200,,596,4.059322033898305

6693417,3,B00NYC65M8,"There are a ton of reviews of this film already posted and most folks are in the I liked it camp.  The CGI was great, the scenery outstanding but to me the acting was a bit on the silly side.  For example, the lead female not only wears high heels throughout, the point is made that she is doing so.  In these high heels she sprints at great speed (outruns the beast???) through a jungle setting with its presumed rough terrain.  Later, still in high heels (undamaged) she outruns a T-Rex ---- just not plausible.  I know this is not meant as great art and it does provide pretty fair entertainment but something as silly as that just bugs me (probably just me).",1446940800,,662,4.349593495934959

This film had such great potential with the stellar cast they had in it, but it was absolutely horrible.  The writing and directing was absolutely terrible and, hence, the acting was just as terrible.

The dumbest, most ridiculous movie of the whole series.  It's about a hybrid dinosaur on a killing rampage.  It kills for sport.  No real scare factor.

The ridiculous attempts to allude to some of the best scenes from the past movies in the series are also a really stupid move the way in which they did it.  The attempts at humor were just as bad.  Once again, really horrible writing, directing and acting.  And that's really difficult for me to say because I love several of the actors in this movie, especially Bryce Dallas Howard.  I blame the bad acting of such great stars on the writer(s) and director first and foremost!

6693577,5,B00NYC65M8,"Critics can say what they want about this latest chapter in the Jurassic Park franchise - and many of them have been very unkind - but they cannot argue with the fact that Steven Spielberg and his crew know how to make movies that keep their audiences on the edge of their seats.
""Jurassic World"" is not a Bergman film, laden with deep messages: It is entertainment, pure and simple, and because it does not suffer from any pretensions I think it succeeds as an action/adventure movie that is certainly a worthy addition to the franchise.
The cast, headed by Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard, is not asked to stretch their acting muscles very much throughout the movie but that's not really a negative. The real stars of the film are - as they  have been in all the previous Jurassic Park movies - the dinosaurs that constantly outsmart the sophisticated technology designed to keep them captive and escape. Once they are free they raise a little hell with the humans bent on exploiting them before, in one way or another, they are rendered harmless. That formula has worked in the past and it does in this latest installment as well.
Excellent special effects, exotic locales and a fast-moving script combined with an appealing cast make ""Jurassic World"" a winner.",1446854400,,1268,4.737556561085973

Because they feel that the public is getting bored with the normal dinosaurs they decide to make their own, the Indominus Rex. And of course, it get's loose and that's when sh*t hits the fan.

And from my research flixter and vudu might be however alot of reviewers used them but many complained that they had to have internet to play downloaded movies.  I would try them but i cant switch retailers and even tho i emailed (no phone #) ultraviolet and asked them to switch mine there customer service not only took 3 days but all they said was that amazon wasn't an option as a retailer and did not respond to switching to flixster like i had asked.

6693621,3,B00NYC65M8,"Despite the attempt to make some of the dinosaurs warm and cuddly this was still an enjoyable escapist film.  That being said please leave your I.Q. at the theater door.  Hard to imagine a real world scenario in which the hero would substitute a lethal force weapon for a non-lethal weapon as people are literally being torn asunder by rampaging dinosaurs. Worse yet the ""Corporation"" is so worried about their $26,000,000 asset that they overlook the tsunami of lawsuits coming their way from all those killed and dismembered by their genetically altered assets. In earlier iterations of this franchise there was always at least one character with an elephant sized gun.

6693632,3,B00NYC65M8,"Definitely not Jurassic Park. The plot was thin and predictable. Star Lord, I mean Owen (Chris Pratt) and Corporate Woman (the stunning) Bryce Dallas Howard were negligent, self-involved and responsible for every death on the island... and also stock character archetypes we see in most action films - props to Howard for doing it all in heels. Far too many 'establishing/scenery' shots - we know you're on a beautiful island. Most of the movie felt disjointed and blocky. The owner of the park didn't seem that interested and more of a 'pet' project. Not enough actual science, far too much vague/implausible science. Not enough scare moments. So many interesting side plots that were not explored because of Star Lord and Corporate Woman whiny issues and 'tension'... Laura Derns character in Jurassic Park was so much stronger and empowered.

However - ALL the dinosaur scenes were AWESOME!!!... which is really the only reason we watch these films. To fill our imaginations with fantastic imagery and watch huge creatures battle it out and eat people.",1446768000,4,1055,5.098265895953757

6693646,4,B00NYC65M8,"It was good, it was entertaining.  Hence 4 stars instead of 5. Unlike the first one, this one did not convey the edge of your seat cunning and intelligence that the first Jurrasic park had. It attempted to convey it, but it was too easy to figure out and was not quite as suspenseful as it could have been.  A lot of reviewers seemed to think it as good or better than the first, but I don't think so.  I like a little bit of ""meat"" so to speak that creates thought and ""aha"" moments much like the first one did.  ""Life will find a way"" is one line that comes to mind.  The how of what they did to create the dinosaurs (true to science ability or not) was thought provoking as well.  At any rate, it isn't the worst, but not the best.  Is it worth a rental at home?  Sure it is.  I am glad I didn't pay the big picture price.  At one point it became something like Godzilla and mothra in a way lol.

6693656,5,B00NYC65M8,"While some subplots seemed pointless or even rushed, i understand why they were in there. The Divorce of the parents will probably be developedi into something over the course of the trilogy and obviously using the dinos in other fields such as war will be explored. Jurassic War is a concept theyve been trying to push since Jurassic Park The Lost World and i think they're really going to go forward with that along with a full immersion of Dinosaurs to the planet. Why else would this be called Jurassic WORLD.
As for the rest of the movie, Its beautiful, nostalgic, visually stunning, it gives me goose bumps. When i first saw the park my jaw dropped. i could watch an entire movie just showing the park and it's attractions.
The acting had some weak/cheesy points but for the most part it was solid.
The i-Rex. Wow. What a powerful and inteligent creature. She just causes mass destruction from her escape to the final battle scene, which is pure bliss.

6693744,2,B00NYC65M8,"This movie tried desperately to recreate the magic of the first film. Often, throughout the film, it often played on the same story line theatrical points. Often I found myself waiting on Sam Neill to come out from the shadows and show us how to really handle the dino situation. In the end I was seriously disappointed in the (spoiler alert) end where the big bad T-Rex and the Raptors were the ""good"" guys. Weak weak weak. This in the end was a sad remake of the original with the only crowd pleasing aspect given to the original dino characters from the first film - which due to the ""lack of"" DNA manipulation we are led to ""love"" over the monstrosity that we humans create. In the end, a pathetic film not worth the 2+ hours I devoted to it. Poor film. Watch Jurassic Park and leave it there.

6693773,4,B00NYC65M8,"Jurassic World, although unbelievable at times, was a very entertaining film. For someone who watched the previous films time and time again, this movie had very large shoes to fill. Jurassic World did just that, it fits right up there with with the other three films. I really enjoyed Chris Pratt's more serious roll. It was very different from his usual comic relief character that he plays. This film took all of everyone's favorite parts of the other movies and emphasized on them very effectively, such as the raptors. I really enjoyed that these animals were not shown as witty insatiable monsters, but as highly intelligent, twice as leathal, wolf-like pack animals who look to a single dominant leader to make their decisions as a unit. All in all I found several things that i really enjoyed about this movie. When i speak to others about my personal opinions about a film, i always give the ""would i buy it"" question. Yes, I already bought it and its in my movie collection right now right beside the other films in this series where it belongs.",1446595200,,1055,4.708108108108108

6693780,4,B00NYC65M8,Great job Trevorrow!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's not the original Jurassic Park. What you have here is a solid new chapter of the Jurassic Park story.  It brought back a lot of the feels from the first movie and added in a lot more dino action. If you're on the fence about renting or buying this flick. Go for it!  In my opinion it's a much better take than the previous sequels. You won't be disappointed.,1446595200,,437,4.178571428571429

This entire movie didn't make sense to me. Who decides to custom build a dinosaur and not tell anyone how you built it? Or more importantly, how about telling the people responsible for creating the containment for the custom build dinosaur some of its enhanced abilities that may directly effect your ability to contain it?  Between certain holes in the plot that even a very liberal suspension of reality can not overlook and a major character who spends the majority of the movie running full speed in high heels (I mean, wth?!!) with the grace of an olympic runner, this movie eventually became more about the pretty explosions than trying to figure out what was going on.

I'm a big action fan, and by the time the movie was over, I was pretty happy with how it looked and sounded in my living room with the surround sound blasting. Overall a fun movie, that didn't scare the crap out of my sons like Jurassic Park still does.

*possible spoiler*
Not sure that many people will care about this aspect, but there is a section of the movie talking about how the parents divorce is affecting the children in the movie.

Monster gets loose, but because of the cost they want to save the animal.. While they are working on that, monster eats it way thru the forest.. They give up on the saving part and kill the animal .. All the damage and dead people, park must close again.. Story love interest predictable also.. End of story.. Just glad I didn't pay to go to the movie to see this. At 5.99 for Prime streaming it really was 4.99 more than what it was worth.. The acting was good, and so were the special effects.

I see the point of it but it's been overused and it's just plain depressing. lastly I've always found the level of nemesis intelligence that can sometimes surpass even humans unbelievable. They took it to the top this time because apparently an animal that's a mix of animals has all the combined intelligence of them rather than a variation of them. I was waiting for a scene where the big dino and all the raptors were discussing philosophy.

It was how you imagine Jurassic Park to be if it actually opened to the public. The CGI was on point, some of it was over done and looked too real (fake) and some of the genetic manipulations like putting a smaller T-Rex head on a Pteranodon body (to scale) was a bit over done. The movie is a fun nostaglia packed ride and I'm actually looking forward to the next Jurassic World if Hollywood decides to go down that road.

6693956,2,B00NYC65M8,"I kept hearing how great this movie was, and being a big fan of dinosaurs and the previous Jurassic Park movies (especially the first one), I had high hopes. But this movie was absolutely ridiculous. The animal behavior made no sense, not to mention the behavior of the people. I am willing to suspend disbelief when watching a movie, but this movie asked way too much from me. Without giving away any spoilers, I can say that almost everything that happened in this movie had me asking if the director/writer had any idea how animals actually behave, or how anything in the world actually works. Just to give you an idea how ridiculous it was, Bryce Dallas Howard's character goes through the entire movie wearing high heels. And that was one of the least egregious issues. The only reason I watched it to the end was because the special effects were excellent and it did have a lot of exciting action... as long as I was willing to overlook how ridiculous most of it was.",1446422400,2,973,4.565714285714286

6694050,2,B00NYC65M8,"Various CGI dinosaurs violently murder other CGI dinosaurs and, also, a ton of CGI people. It's a good thing that nobody really cares. Ass-pulls and silliness abound in this film, which goes on for at least 35 minutes too long, far past the emotional climax and even further beyond the point of incredulity. I'm a Chris Pratt fan (he does OK here), but aside from him and the films central brother characters (who are at least two-dimensional characters) the confused scenes, and awkward ironies make it close to unwatchable.

If you like the modern trend of 80% action-scene movies made by programmers in a warehouse, you'll probably think this one is just fine; for the rest of us here's a tip, please: don't try to sell me a 'bigger, scarier, more violent' movie which attempts to tell an aesop about the evils of 'bigger, scarier, more violent'.",1446336000,,849,4.775510204081633

You get light character development, you get an extremely easy story line to follow, you get stunning CGI and most importantly, you get straight to the point: loud action and dinosaurs.

Its extremely refreshing to see dinosaurs on the big screen again and I look forward to the sequel!

Now - Onto the Blu-ray and packaging itself...

First off, this blu-ray comes with a lenticular slipcover with some pretty cool cover art. The 2D picture quality is superb with vibrant colors and nice black levels, the 3D on the other hand leaves something to be desired. It's not terrible, but could of been much better. Sound quality wise, your looking at DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 lossless soundtrack which really gives your foundations a run for its money if you have a decent set-up. Special features consist of a few featurettes and deleted scenes, nothing you won't ever watch more than once - but then again, that's not why you bought this film!",1446336000,,1076,4.652631578947369

6694066,5,B00NYC65M8,"Jurassic Park has been one of my favorite movies and series. This is a great edition. A new story with a little surprise of something old here and there. Chris Pratt does a great job as do the other leading/supporting actors and actresses. The build up of different characters was good also. The new ""exhibits"" were great. You build emotional attachments with the people and the ""animals"" in a way. A bit of fun, a bit of fear, a bit of action, what more could you ask for?",1446336000,,473,4.386363636363637

6694079,2,B00NYC65M8,"This movie had potential, but it was ruined by bad writers. Groan inducing moments that made no sense. For example, the main characters were racing to save the kids, but they stop and spill tears over a bunch of dying dinosaurs. Really? Excuse me? They just forgot they were racing to save the kids? So much for an emergency. The main female character was like a bad copy of Pepper from the Iron Man movies. Why? Couldn't she just have her own look and personality? They had no means to evacuate the people off the island. Why? How did they get people there in the first place? Why did they have to go after the monster dinosaur by foot and with tiny guns and they could not use airplanes and helicopters? They only had one helicopter, really? It all leads to probably the worst ending ever, where the characters don't do anything useful and it's some random event that solves the problem. Come on! The only reason I give it 2 stars is because the kids did a great job. They saved the movie, otherwise it would have been impossible to watch.",1446336000,,1041,4.427083333333333

6694087,4,B00NYC65M8,"Well you pretty much knew what you were going to get with Jurassic Park 4 (just called World instead of 4) before watching it.  You know which characters are going to survive, and which ones won't after the first couple of minutes, so what you really want to know if deciding to get this or not is if reaching that obvious ending, will it be entertaining, will it be fun and will the dinosaurs, especially the interactions with human actors look real?  Unfortunately the latter part of the question, the answer there are some obvious actor in front of a greenscreen moments, especially the scenes revolving around the DVD cover image.  Part of the success of the original 1993 film was, that at the time it was using special effects that audiences hadn't seen before, it was making history, it was a must see in cinemas to see it on the big screen.  Jurassic World does granted have better technology CGI than Jurassic Park, but it doesn't have better CGI than every other movie released in 2015, or 2014, 2013 and other recent years.  Does it have a better story.  Well it's pretty much using the same one, and it lacks iconic memorable for decades to come scenes the first one provided like the lawyer being eaten on the toilet, or the cups of water shaking with the weight of the dinosaur's steps.

To say to audiences that this is not a remake it's a sequel, World's setting is the 20th Anniversary of the original park's opening, which obviously had to close due to the events in that film and does pay a nice homage to the original film. As it has a few scenes such as the actor from New Girl wearing the first park's t-shirt and being told of that it is in bad taste due to how many people died, and the kids discover a lost Jeep garage from the first park and drive one of those jeeps for a little while.  But the latter scene doesn't really make sense, I mean surely current staff would have used anything that still works in there as parts and since we know the t-shirt from that park costs hundreds of dollars surely the original maintenance uniforms and stuff would have been sold off.  On the park employees not knowing things exist on their island, it was also ridiculous that the top dinosaur ranger never notices a massive enclosure being built or a massive dinosaur growing up inside it.  Having worked in similar parks with animals, wildlife rangers talk to each other all the time, they are a close group, if there was a new animal, everyone would know about it.

Another homage to the original is when you think of Park, you remember that Newman (Wayne Knight) from Seinfeld was in it.  World has not one but heaps of typecast actors who play characters from TV shows in minor roles who will likely disappear from the screen once their shows come to an end.  As I've mentioned you've got Jake Johnson (New Girl), beside him as another camera monitor you've got Lauren Lapkus (Orange is the New Black). BD Wong (Law and Order SVU), Vincent D'Onofrio (Some other Law and Order spin off that I think may have been axed a fair few years ago), Omar Sy (Fishn 'Chips), even the main adult hero, Chris Pratt you'll probably haven't seen before unless you watch Parks and Recreation, or watched Everwood or the OC.  The main female lead Bryce Dallas Howard you've probably never heard of, but she's the daughter of Ron Howard who's of course a director now, but got famous from the TV show Happy Days.

Jurassic World is worth watching, I mean who doesn't like dinosaurs, and likes seeing them cause a lot of destruction and eat people? It isn't the greatest film in the world, but you didn't really expect it to be did you? People always die in a fun non gory realistic way too, so it's kid friendly, as obviously your biggest dinosaur fans are kids.  That's what this film basically is, a remake of Park for a new generation of kids who will of course want their parents to buy the toys and other merchandise that also hit the market in 2015.",1446336000,,3956,4.481223922114047

IT can be summed up with with one line from the move- bigger, with more teeth. Really, if you like watching CG dinosaurs run round while people try to shoot them then this may be alright for a fun rental. There are major problems with the script- in this version they still used genes from other species of animals, but it was not to bring an extinct dinosaur to life, it was to create a new animal, which just happens to have military applications. And the whole meme thing with Chris pratt facing off the raptors was seriously overblown. It was built up in the media and in the script, but never amounted to anything useful. Really I fell asleep halfway through the movie, and was disappointed at the end. So there are again, flying dinosaurs on the loose with no repercussions, and a T rex on the loose, but everyone is not concerned as long as the villain dinosaur is dead. There is a weak subplot that is used to set up yet another sequel, but it does not add anything to the story. Really wish they would stop making these. Really wish I could stop watching them.",1446336000,,1222,4.317391304347826

Good action but very predictable. The use of the Marlin 1895 was excellent its acting was very real and for a second made me forget this was a moving picture...deserves an award.

This movie should've been called ""Giant lizards have personalities too""

The follow up movie should be the trial and inditement of the ownership for irresponsibly tampering genetics. Maybe they can have the t-rex testify on how it was treated after it wasn't the main attraction. A thorough explanation of its feelings and why it turned to drugs for an escape.

I suppose to each his own but for me, I loved it...2 and 4 are my fave movies in this series now.  (of course one will always be the first :)
I thought this was exciting and they spun it to a really entertaining updated version with some fun new ways to the story.  ( ""the hamster ball"", the theme park effect like sea world, the classic t rex victorious) Just a fun film. I liked that there was not an excess of blood and pretty clean language, I appreciate family fare.  Ok so there were a few things in the story that did not need to be there and should prob of been cut, but isn't that every film?  The excitement and dino fights like classic monster movies far out shined the few miswrites.  The only glaring thing I hated was Bryce's character running around in heels so bogus...they'd of broken she'd of been bloody footed and eaten.  (The whole movie was fantasy and fun but the heels just stood out couldn't let that one go LOL). Over all I just thoroughly enjoyed it.  Maybe the fact that there just are not many block buster good films made anymore and without smut and f bombs, maybe I was craving a good fun film I don't know, but I liked it!

Should be called ""stereotype World"" ---- every predictable character from the moppet haired genius 12 year old white boy to the crafty Asian guy who genetically designed the ""new"" dinosaur to the bitchy red haired female executive to  the deep thoughts multimillionaire East Indian park owner.

The big secret dinosaur has all the traits of a Predator (of a Predator vs alien) character except it's afraid of water. And the military/evil contractors want to use raptors on the battlefield, and we all know how that will work out .
And now park guests are being eaten by flying dinosaurs -- just like in the old Hitchcock ""The Birds"".  Good.

So much of this is just dumb and boring, worse than San Andreas movie, so I won't bore you with the details except to say they even stole a scene from Sharknado.

I must say that it seemed completely unbelievable that the character played by Howard would ever be selected for any management position, let alone to be the boss of Dino Disney.

6694314,4,B00NYC65M8,"The thing that's lacking when comparing it to the original is the sense of awe, but how are you going to recapture that? In fact, that's part of the plot: people are already bored with dinosaurs. But the dinosaur action and the sense of terror and excitement are there.

Is it Oscar worthy? Of course not. But I would assume most people know what to expect when they go see a summer action blockbuster movie and this movie delivers on that. Let your brain disengage, try not to over-think it, and have some fun.

My biggest criticism is not the script (okay) or the acting (good), but that all of the ""background"" dinosaurs (not the stars) are the same dull grays and browns. Would have loved to have seen a little time taken in the CGI to make the supporting cast of dinosaurs (triceratops, stegosaurus, apatosaurus, parasaurolophus, ankylosaurus) more colorful.

Hoping that this film does what the original did: create a whole new generation of dinosaur scientists.",1446249600,2,968,4.7844311377245505

6694422,5,B00NYC65M8,"The excitement in this movie builds and builds.  Chris Pratt has an engaging humorous personality, but has the weight to pull off the action hero role.  After ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", Pratt established himself as the next big name in action movies.  Bryce Dallas Howard is perfect as the control freak manager of the park who fills the obligatory strong woman role.  She runs the whole park but is clueless about life.  There is real chemistry between Howard and Pratt.  She has another talent that struck me during the movie.  I have never seen a woman do so much flat out running in heels.  As with Jurassic Park, the film follows the adventures of two children who require rescuing from the real villain in the movie, a genetically engineered super-saurus  who is portrayed as having a high IQ, who kills everything it meets and has many abilities that would make Batman envious-like the ability to disappear. I loved this movie.  It does everything Jurassic Park did only bigger.  Or, as they said in the movie, ""It has more teeth."".",1446249600,,1039,4.748603351955308

Very disappointed when i first watched it, simple one dimensional characters, obvious bad guys who get it in the end, and the ending was on the other side of stupid!  It had the usual Hollywood situations (running down the middle of the street while being attacked by flying monster instead of ducking in building on either side or the machine gun on the chopper MISSING the huge dinosaur in front of them).  It was a wast of some really good actors time and effort.  Special effects were very good but any logic or story development when right out of the window.  This should have been called Jurassic Park 4 - more of the same!",1446249600,,760,4.478260869565218

One would think after all the disasters created by messing with nature in the previous movies in the series that they would have learned their lesson, but no, they decide to create a genetically enhanced dinosaur monster that is huge, fierce, intelligent, and nearly invisible when it wants to be.

As you might expect, this is not a good idea and leads to the monster eating all kinds of people.

I can only take so much of this kind of nonsense, even with the good special and sound effects. The lead actor and actress should be ashamed of their performances. I was rooting for the dinosaur to eat them they were so bad.",1446249600,,672,4.455284552845528

I know it must have the same basic premise, and that almost all movies have a happy ending, but the sequence of implausible events escalated to the point that it became totally unbelievable, and ruined the ending to an otherwise decent movie.

I really wished Laura Dern or Jeff Goldblum could've made a quick cameo appearance but none the less, we loved it.  Hadn't really seen much of the actors before but we kept an open mind.  I wish the female lead would have been a stronger character like Julianne Moore but once again, we thought we could give it a little wiggle room. The scenery was fantastic and there were  amazing dinosaurs.  The movie made my teen scream twice so I knew it had to be good lol.  The raptors in this depiction were super cool and we loved that they weren't just thirsty human hunters as in past movies.  It wasn't quite as gory as the earlier ones but it did not lack in pure out of your seat excitement.

6694443,5,B00NYC65M8,"It's difficult to follow an act as original and successful as Jurassic Park with sequels that are not too similar to the last. Having enjoyed all three movies I already feel biased; I knew whatever issues I could nitpick out of this film wouldn't change the fact that I'd still love it for what it does best. What I never expected was to find this movie was my new favorite of the four.

It's many things, the usual warnings about technology inspiring greed to misuse it, examining people in disaster situations, and of course, ""Wow, dinosaurs!"" Yeah the plot is pretty predictable and there's cliches; the visiting youth, the naive park management, the rampage of our new dinosaur villian, etc, but it is so much more than the token thrills we've come to expect.

My favorite thing is I didn't feel like you had to have seen the last movies to feel like you're experiencing seeing a dinosaur park for the first time. There are many homages and without spoiling anything I'll say previous characters do make appearances, but the movie provides great new characters to follow and feels fresh. Really hoping Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard reprise their roles in a sequel.

I saw the first when I was five and this was still a scary show. It's PG-13, but it's not obvious, it's intense and interesting. Hardcore dino fans may despise the lack of attention to scientific compliance, but since they explain from the start the dinosaurs are genetically altered to even be able to live at all, it doesn't seem to matter.

If you've liked any of the previous films I think you'll love this one.

Oh, and did I mention trained attack raptors? Yeah.",1446163200,,1644,4.674740484429066

The story is a mix of stories told over and over, but the special effects were so good, you can ignore the boring and weird plot.

6694481,4,B00NYC65M8,"It's been so long since I've seen any of the Jurassic movies that I can't really remember the details but I think this one rates very well with the original Jurassic Park. In my opinion the CGI dinosaurs look very good (on my TV - I missed it in the theater) and ""act"" well too. The humans are more cardboard cutout but did a pretty good job as well.
The biggest creatures ever to walk the Earth and the containment guys went after them with weapons that would barely put a man down (Indominus Rex did get grazed with an antitank missileone Velociraptor killed with a rocket grenade or something).That was the weakest bit of the movie, the undersized weapons.
Claire never lost her high heels, realistically she would've broken them off, thrown the shoes away, or diedquickly.
I've read complaints about the CGIit looks very good.
The boys restarting a 20+ year old jeep?, not very likely but at least they used a battery from a nearby ""new"" wreck.
One of the biggest criticisms is ""It would take 50 years to grow a Dinosaur that size!""here it's said (for the Indominus at least) that they were grown at an accelerated rate.
I think there's a hint of a hoped for sequel in one character sneaking off with some embryos, some group wanting to weaponize them. I can't see that movie, if it's ever made, being nearly the success this one was.
Jurassic Park may be better but on the whole Jurassic World is a good movie even if it is loaded with cliches.",1446163200,2,1449,4.492424242424242

6694494,3,B00NYC65M8,"it was meh.....nothing special.
I really was disappointed as it felt very paint by numbers for a movie, and lacked the excitement that the other movies in the series had.
Plus it was a little too far fetched in some of the things that happened.  Dont get me wrong, I understand its a movie and you are supposed to suspend disbelief, but with some of the things chris pratt does with the dinosaurs in this movie...i just felt like ""really?"".
Its hard for me to review a movie without giving a lot of detail because I don't want to spoil it for others, but essentially this was just like the first movie, with different actors, different plot lines, but same outcomes and same things happening in certain parts (for instance kids on their own trying to outsmart a dino).

worth watching for free on cable (although you're paying for the service so not really free), but if you are lookign for excitement and something new....nto for you

UNLESS......you have kids who have never seen a JP movie and you are into their excitement, (kind of like living through the star wars prequals and hating them while your kids loved them)",1446163200,,1123,4.605

6694496,3,B00NYC65M8,"Fun movie, though if you saw Jurassic Park I, you saw the same plot...
But a warning for those with some older Blu-Ray players without BDLive (I have a Pioneer Elite BDP-05FD - high end player when it came out, and fully updated to 1.74 firmware):

Either the Jurassic World Blu-Ray is not compatible with older players, or BDLive is needed to access some features. None of them work, it just plays the movie.

Also, and the big reason for only three stars: you cannot bypass the 10 trailers by just hitting ""top menu"" or ""pop up menu."" Those are both disabled. You must use chapter skip 11 times to get to the main menu. This occurs on my news cheap Sony player as well, though it plays the menus and special features correctly (it has BDLive).

Acting was more than adequate and the special effects were better than the original ""Jurassic Park"". Here's where I split though: It was so similar to the original that I don't think it could be called a sequel, just a remake and it's far too soon to be remaking Jurassic Park.

6694610,5,B00NYC65M8,I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was very entertaining and had my attention for almost every minute.,1446076800,,103,5.117647058823529
6694611,5,B00NYC65M8,"I remembered WATCHING Jurassic park growing up,so HAPPY finally this came out and my children watch it with me. So they wanted to know more, watched every movie made by far this is the best yet!!",1446076800,,195,4.444444444444445
6694612,3,B00NYC65M8,"The acting, action, and over all portrayal was significantly dulled down. Like a knock off low budget flik. May be somewhat entertaining for kids, but definately not a cool movie for adults.

And the scene(s) where he is using the clicker as a training tool is so far from actuality it's embarassing. The producers should have done some more research in the animal training field before letting that upset come out.",1446076800,,415,4.845070422535211

6694617,3,B00NYC65M8,Really not worth it. Very predictable. The only thing that saved it from 2 stars were the special effects. I noticed it came down from 19.00 bucks for purchase to 4.99 rental fairly quickly if that's any indication. Kids may think it's good but not this adult.,1446076800,,260,4.553191489361702

6694637,4,B00NYC65M8,Really good movie. I liked how they tied some things from the original together with this one.  I liked Chris Pratt's character.  Effects and action were great also.  Glad some of the less than desirable characters became dino food!,1446076800,,232,4.897435897435898

6694658,3,B00NYC65M8,"I finally saw Jurassic World last night and I can't say I was too impressed. I'm not a fan of horror movies and I suppose the intent was to make this one scarier than the previous ones. Certainly it was gorier. But in order for something to be scary, there needs to be some kind of suspense, there was none of that here. Every character that died might as well have had a giant target on their forehead from the moment they walked on screen. Every death was telegraphed way in advance, but almost all of them were far gorier than they needed to be. There was one in particular that went on and on for what seemed like several minutes, and it wasn't some evil character getting what they ""deserved"", just some poor schmuck who is shown dying in a drawn out, horrific, lingering scene. I realize there are people who love that s***, but I'm not one of them. I can't see someone who is essentially a bystander horrifically murdered and enjoy that.
And what's with kids? Every Jurassic Park movie has had a kid at the center of it, why is this necessary? Do they think kids won't go see a dinosaur movie without a kid in it? They aren't going to die, they aren't ever in real danger because you know they are not going to die a grisly death, so why spend more than half the movie revolving around them? At least the kids in this one didn't save the day, unlike SOME Jurassic parks I could think of (""This is a unix system, I know this""...""They cut you from the team?"")
And finally, yes, the effects were pretty good, though cartoony in some spots. I don't know if a Stegosaurus could run, but I find it hard to believe they galloped quite that way.
Anyway, I give it 3 pizza slices out of 5...",1446076800,,1689,4.28125

6694665,3,B00NYC65M8,Not nearly the edge-of-your-seat suspense of the first two movies...and it has suffered from the modernizing and tendency to make everything high-tech. The woman running the park is totally unbelievable...runs around the entire movie (through jungles!) in a white suit and stiletto heels. The whole movie feels like so much more of a stretch than the others.,1446076800,,358,5.298245614035087

6694670,2,B00NYC65M8,"Everyone said it was great but it's just not so. More out of control, dinosaurs and another cheesy theme park. Steven Speiberg should have stopped after Jurassic Park.

6694672,2,B00NYC65M8,"I saw Jurassic Park in theaters when I was 12, I already had fostered a love for dinosaurs before the movie came out. It was the epitome of a dinosaur movie; it had the thrills, the laughs, the story-line and the sounds to immerse you in the action. Let's be candid here... This movie though is only MARGINALLY better then Lost World and Jurassic Park 3 which were disgraces. I'll buy it on disc, but only after it hit's the bargain bin for under ten bucks.

***Spoiler Alert*** Shoulda fed the red headed hussy to the dinosaurs as the first live sacrifice, absolutely no reason she lived to the end of the movie. None.",1446076800,,619,4.4298245614035086

6694679,1,B00NYC65M8,"HORRIBLE movie.  If you're interested in watching some special effects, I guess I'd say you could forgive yourself for watching it, but in this day and age, special effects have sort of plateaued to the point where we've already seen it all before.  This movie really offers nothing new in that respect.

Where it really loses it is with an essentially nonsensical plot line ( ""Tourists are no longer impressed with normal dinosaurs which is causing our Q4 sales figures to decline.  To hedge the losses, we've developed a dinosaur with a portfolio of exciting powers which is sure to impress the unwashed masses while in no way elevating the risk associated with a dinosaur theme park"").

Predictably, the thing escapes and ""chaos"" ensues.  Enter our cast of one-dimensional characters to save the day.  They play into every single cliche imaginable, while working in lame references to the first movie lest we become so wrapped up with this 2 hour turd that we forget it is the descendant of what actually WAS a cutting edge movie for its time.

A couple explosions, a few folks get eaten, a repeat of the last dinosaur fight scene from the original, and we arrive at the painfully predictable ending.

This is one of those movies that makes you wish you'd have just spent the past 2 hours exfoliating your eyeballs with a green Brillo pad.",1446076800,16,1342,4.75

My first impressions were before I even put the disc in my Sony 3D system was...Is the 3D going to be mediocre, or blah blah? I was disappointed in my 3D copy of Guardians of the Galaxy, I felt it should have been better...the movie was fantastic, but left me lacking in the 3D department. My new 3D glasses by Sainsonic also came yesterday, and it worked perfect with my Optoma HD33 projector after i charged it for close to 2 hours. OK, 10 minutes into the movie, I was floored at the depth of the 3D in this movie, it was like I was at the movies again, I was amazed, the quality was beautiful. Let me warn you about the sound...several times, within the first 30-50 minutes of this movie, I found myself looking around, and to the side of me...I kept thinking let me turn the sound down, this can't be coming from the movie...they mastered this movie in a fashion were it completely surrounds you...scared me once lol I was like this is what they meant by totally immersive. If you are on the fence about buying this movie for your 3DTV, or projector, ""BUY IT""...remember how you felt looking at the 3D of Avatar? Well this is on par or better, BUY THIS MOVIE...you will not regret it...easily the best 3D movie I have ever seen besides Avatar.",1446076800,,1413,4.335849056603774

If you like that sort of colorless thing it might be great but I prefer something functional or at least with color.

Fortunately for me one of my sons got two DVDs for the Great Grandchildren and he disregards all artwork.
I already had a double BluRay case from a damaged one I had purchased and the vendor told me not to send it back.

As for 3-D  what could have been a ( You Better Wear A Diaper ) best ever was a disappointment to a fan of the Technology.
This is not just opinion but fact even though most of the last 20 minutes fit the bill, Hype, and Awe.

I have been into 3-D since I got my first View master in the 50s so I know it is about being in better than there.
Totaly sucked into the veiw !
This means no artistic soft focus or hard blurred background to draw your attention to the foreground.
Directors need to face the fact that on none HD this could still make or break a film but in HD and always in
3-D it will do exactly the opposite of what they desire and all you can do is be distracted from what they want
you to focus on.
Unfortunately this is a case of some not having the skills or correct control over their Ego to allow the technology
to speak for itself.
Over all they did the 3-D makeover of the first Jurassic Park better than this.

I can say more but not without a spoiler so I won't and please don't think that I do not enjoy the film because I do.
I will be watching it on the DVD most likely though !",1445990400,,1521,3.957516339869281

This was my first time buying a blu ray + DVD + digital copy film, so I carefully followed the instructions for the digital copy. You can use the code ONCE, so I highly recommend you use your code on your laptop (itunes), if that's where you'll be watching the film the most. It's easier.

You need to follow 3 Steps:
1) Go to UniversalDigitalCopy.com
2) Enter your code
3) Choose your retailer

Once you choose a retailer, you can watch the film on any of your devices.

I chose Flixster as my retailer. I downloaded the app on my MAC and Kindle Fire HDX. Thankfully, it was easy. You do need to make an account and it'll link to the account you made on UniversalDigitalCopy.com, so trust me, it'll be easy to watch your film.",1445990400,,1004,4.268421052631579

6694842,5,B00NYC65M8,"I recently rented the latest Jurassic Park sequel ""Jurassic World"". All in all it's a pretty good movie. Lot's of action and edge of your seat suspense. This is an updated version. The crazy scientists have gone and made a proto-type dinosaur that is sort of a cross breed and it communicates with the Lasaraptors and steals control away from their alpha control. Turns out this mega female dinosaur not only kills for food but starts killing for sport. It's a good movie, lots of cool special effects, and leaves you with the impression that Steven Spielberg is most likely going to come out with yet another sequel after this one. If you like Jurassic Park, you'll like Jurassic World. I recommend this movie though maybe not suitable for younger kids that may be prone to nightmares about being chased by big gnarly dinosaurs.",1445990400,,829,4.763888888888889

That man is not happy with bringing back the animals that already wrecked havoc on the islands three times while proving that it was a bad idea to begin with. They want to build them bigger, scarier and better so far as box office draws at the park go's. It was a fun adventure for a Saturday night at the (Home) movies.

6694938,5,B00NYC65M8,"I received this movie expecting it to come with Chris Pratt as indicated on the screen.  However, to my dismay, Chris Pratt was not part of the merchandise.  It was just a cunning ruse to get me to buy the movie.  The movie was of good quality, the Disc was a Blu-ray, which to be honest, wasn't too blue.  I was worried about that.  The other Disc was a silverish color called a DVD.  It also came with an ultraviolet copy of the movie.  The Blu-ray movie was super impressive.  They had a huge actor training raptors, which from the first movie in the series you would think was impossible.  There was also a non-existant love affair, just like in the first movie.  Then there was a fight between this created dinosaur and the mother f-ing T-rex.  It was great, a thrill ride to the end.  The DVD version disappointed me, It was like I was watching the same movie all over agin, but in a lesser quality.  The Ultraviolet version did not work.  I stuck it into my PS4, my XBONE and my Blu-Ray player, but nothing happened.  Maybe there is a special ultraviolet player that I need to get.  I would recommend getting this, but no need to get the package with the DVD, it's boring compared to the Blu-Ray version.  And don't expect it to be delivered with Chris Pratt.",1445904000,,1266,4.364806866952789

6695101,1,B00NYC65M8,"Contains plot spoilers. This movie left me feeling depressed and angry. I loved the original Jurassic Park. It created such a sense of awe at the sight of those magnificent creatures of the prehistoric past brought back to life, even after things started to go horribly wrong. Jurassic World rehashes and expands the theme of human arrogance and stupidity at continuing to think that we can control and contain nature's force. The people who run the park refer to the animals as nothing more than resources to be exploited for commercial gain. Chris Pratt's character is the only person in the whole film who appears to have any sense that even genetically modified and artificially created dinosaurs are still thinking and feeling creatures worthy of respect. This could have been a great follow up movie. The CGI is better than ever. The dinosaurs continue to be magnificent and the scenery was gorgeous. There is a really cool scene where Chris Pratt is thundering through the forest alongside his trained pack of velociraptors. Unfortunately the plot is no different than the original. Wondrous theme park for extinct creatures is created at astronomical expense. Said creators of park have no clue at the power of the animals they think they control. Deadly and intelligent dinosaur escapes the confines of its supposedly impregnable paddock. Dinosaur causes death and mayhem. Park is destroyed, everyone flees island. Seriously? Is this the best the writers and producers could come up with? At least in Jurassic Park most of the dinosaurs got to live. Jurassic World is just one big dinosaur slaughter. Literally. The villain dinosaur who has no social skills because she was raised in isolation kills everything she can just for fun and decimates all the sweet herbivores. The pteradactyd type dinosaurs have the great misfortune to have their aviary destroyed and as a result are all blasted out of the sky. I had the sense that the poor mosasaur might be the only survivor, and he would be doomed to starve in his pool. The movie is predictable, shallow, tiresome and hopeless. Oh wait, there is a scene at the end that is supposed to let us know that ""in the end, family really matters"". Just in case you didn't know that already.",1445904000,4,2241,4.915567282321899

6695114,1,B00NYC65M8,"One star for this ""collectible packaging,"" the movie itself was pretty much exactly what I expected it to be and is worth a purchase. If this truly is a limited time offer, wait to buy until it's in a regular Blu-ray case! Whoever thought it was a good idea to design a case that won't sit on a shelf with the rest of your media should be fired and never allowed to work in the entertainment industry ever again. What a stupid idea. The circular tin comes off of the smaller, thinner cardboard base and doesn't really fit back onto it without the cellophane, even if you save the base. There is a perforated flap on the back of this cardboard backing, so it can be displayed awkwardly (and very much top-heavy) in an easel-style on a desktop, which is great for a week or two and then you'll probably want to file this title away along with the rest of your movies, only it won't sit on a shelf without rolling off unless you set it on it's bottom, which gives it a huge footprint with a large surface to dust off for years to come. So you are left with a weird case that doesn't fit anywhere and can never sit neatly on your media shelves with the rest of your movies for easy browsing. It will be in a drawer someplace. The discs are also placed in individual cardboard envelopes inside the case, and you probably hate sliding the highly sensitive surface of your discs against a rough paper envelope every time you want to watch or store them as much as I do. I seriously have no idea why this is a thing. Plastic cases are nice and were designed the way they are for a reason. Feel free to be creative, packaging designers, but please give us a smooth plastic tray with a secure holding tab and an outer case that is as tall and deep as my other media and has a squared bottom so I can shelve it. Thanks a lot for the burden of dealing with this stupid effing case for the rest of my life. The consequences of early adoption. Wait until they press a second run and put them in conventional cases (though this may be your only chance to grab the 3D version as they may not press another batch), you REALLY don't need this useless tin.",1445904000,4,2137,4.240196078431373

6695136,2,B00NYC65M8,"I found it rather boring. The story was dual, and very predictible. Their was nothing new. The cgi looked a little better. Their were a few new dinasours but mostly just redos from the old ones. It was a redo of the first one. From all 4 movies, all the actors were the same, all the save tricks, just really nothing new. I don't get how anyone could call this a good movie. It's pretty much a repackaged first one. The first one was good because it was new, a fresh idea on disnasours. The second one was dumb, the third one was better, but suffered from the problem that bigger is not always better. This seems to be the problem with movies in 2015. To quote a fav song of mine, ""it's all the same, only the names change"". A repackaged star wars, grandpa star wars, a repackage ghost busters, and a repackage back to the future.

Who would have thought a movie about rampaging dinosaurs could be this bland and ho-hum? Watch this one if you must, then go straight back to the original and see what I mean.

6695157,2,B00NYC65M8,Chris Pratt is always fun to watch. Ron Howard's daughter on the other hand... Let's just say nepotism is alive and well in Hollywood. I thought the dialog was infantile but the effects were pretty sharp. Overall I couldn't wait for it to end.,1445817600,,243,4.545454545454546
6695158,5,B00NYC65M8,"I saw this movie in the theatre in real-time 3D.( I don't like IMAX 3D, there's too much to take in). I purchased the collectors edition which has DVD,Blu Ray and Blu Ray 3D versions packed in a miniature film reel can. I haven't seen the 3D disc yet. I bought it in anticipation of my purchasing a 3D TV. Surprisingly, this movie is just as good in 2D! CGI has developed to the stage where I can't tell where the computer imagry kicks in. There has always been one basic plot for this sort of movie, not just for the Jurassic Park series but for dinosaur movies in general, going back to the silent version of THE LOST WORLD. Take a group of people, isolate, them, introduce a seemingly unstoppable threat, and spend the rest of the movie killing off second string characters and finding a way to eliminate the monster. The challenge is in the execution. On this level, Jurassic World triumphs! The fully realized theme park is a wonder to behold and I could have spent all day just looking at the exhibits. The Mososaur and the Gyrosphere, for example, are fascinating! The Direction is flawless and the resulting film looks as though Speilberg had directed it himself. The dinosaurs are the real stars of the movie,but they would be uninteresting without people to terrorize. This is not Shakespeare, but remember, these actors are reacting to nothing more than a blue screen. Chris and Dallas are good looking and worthy successors to Harrison Ford, Sam Neil and Julianne Moore. The actors who play the teenage brothers are appealing and believable. Vincent Donofrio, paunchier and grayer, than I remember, has reined in his quirky acting style and is quite good here. BD Wong, from the original movie, is back again, still handsome but no longer boyish. His role here is actually larger than it was in the original. The movie has constant visual and scripted references to the earlier trilogy, some overt and some subtle. They weren't distracting, in fact ,for fans of the earlier movies like myself,they are endearing and they sustain the link to the past. I picked up references to the first three movies and Alien, Aliens and even Jaws!. This movie has sold a lot of popcorn and tickets, so I guess we can look forward to Jurassic Park Five. I, for one, can hardly wait!",1445817600,,2278,4.669154228855722
6695159,2,B00NYC65M8,"""Just because we can, doesn't mean we should.""  Steven Spielberg utters these words during an interview found in the bonus content on the main disc.  He's speaking of the use of science to make dinosaurs without regard for the consequences.  Ironically, the same quote applies to the use of CGI to make a movie without a script.  Jurassic World combines great CGI with a weak, juvenile script populated by hollow characters.  Most of the plot points arise from stupid behavior or convenient occurrences.  The whole premise of the film is based upon a scenario where an abomination created by the genetic scientists, which I've dubbed Psycosaurus, is able to get out of its paddock simply because both methods of tracking the creature are not used immediately after it goes missing.  Communication devices work or crap out whenever it's convenient.  The two adolescent protagonists are able to wander into the depths of the park simply because there are no mechanisms in place to prevent them from running amuck.  The characters are stock and 2-dimensional; meandering through a CGI world and interaction with CGI dinosaurs while searching for the right time and place to have their special defining moment.  The only character that the director even attempts to develop is Claire.  She's in charge of park operations and culpable in the deaths of dozens of people as a result of her refusal to order an evacuation but ultimately devoid of all accountability.  On the other hand she's also super talented and super capable and super independent as is evidenced by her ability to slog through the jungle, Gymkata a Pterodactyl and outrun a T-Rex all while wearing high-heels.  So to summarize - Bad Script + Poorly Developed Characters + Great CGI = Not Worth Your Hard Earned Dollars.

UPDATE:  This is apparently the best movie ever as the global box office revenue has reached over $1.65 billion.  Ignore my entire review.",1445817600,,1923,4.981191222570533

I'm a little disappointed in the packaging of this blu ray. The metal tin is cool and all but as soon as you take it out of the packaging you're left with a metal tin and a paper ""stand"". Good luck fitting the tin plus the cheap paper ""stand"" on your bookshelf with the rest of your Jurassic collection. It'll no doubt fall over faster than you can say ""Clever Girl"" and the tin will roll away faster than the gyrosphere.  Inside the metal tin the blu ray and DVD are in cheap paper sleeves stacked on top of each other. Every time you take them out you'll risk scratching them. It looks like they just threw them in the tin and off to shipping. Good grief Universal. Save yourself the headache and buy a ""regular"" plastic sleeve copy either that or wait a couple of months and buy a super-special edition set with all four movies which will, no doubt, come out in a couple of months.",1445731200,,1045,4.225

The filmmakers are totally in on the joke, but treat the audience like they are too stupid to get it.

I promised myself that I would see the IMAX 3D version, but I didn't get a chance to make it while it was still in theaters, so I made sure that I bought the 3D DVD. I'm sooo glad I did. It was amazing. As soon as the action set in it didn't stop until the very end. My favorite part from the original was the velociraptor scene in the kitchen and just as before, the most tense scenes involved them in Jurassic World, too.

The CGI was so good at one point I had to remind myself it was CGI because it was so perfect I wasn't even thinking about it. The ONLY complaint I had was I thought it ended a little abruptly- not time wise but just in the storytelling- so I suppose that means there will be a sequel - which is fine with me- and Chris Pratt - he's a joy reminds me of a young Harrison Ford- hunky but mildly comedic.,1445731200,,535,3.8727272727272726

6695386,1,B00NYC65M8,"Update: after watching this abortion of imagination again I've realized something - this was never intended to be a good movie, or even a logical story with logical characters, it was intended to be the beginning of a new franchise meant solely to milk small, ignorant children of their parent's money. I regret ever giving this movie the benefit of the doubt, and Colin Trevorrow should be ashamed and embarrassed to have been paid for his work on this garbage. This is definitely the most thoughtless, inconsiderate, moronic, and illogical movie I've ever seen. No, I'm not being too harsh - no decisions made by the characters or filmmakers makes any sense(by the way, it shouldn't take four people to write an incoherent screenplay). My only hope is that eventually this movie will be considered one of the worst of all time, as it should be. The lack of humility is astounding. The first Jurassic Park was well-received for so many reasons, not the least of which is the sense of wonder and awe it imparted to every viewer, not just the small and feeble-minded. This dreck is offensive to anyone with the ability to parse even the simplest of ideas. Everything I've written that comes after this sentence is merely a rant to vent my frustrations and reading it will only serve to anger fans of this boring spectacle and enrage people with the sense to hate it as much as I did.

I was 13 when the first movie came out, and I have never been more scared of something I knew was not real. That's the power of the human imagination, and possibly the only thing which separates us from the beasts. The beauty of movies, or any story, or music, or artistic creation of humankind, is that it can transport us without moving an inch. I love movies for this reason. I don't take lightly their capabilities.

Let me first say that I went into this movie with the intention of loving it, and the expectation that you couldn't mess up a formula this winning. I never expected it to be high art, or Oscar worthy. All I hoped was that it would be something new, or different, while retaining the thrill of the original, or in the very least the understanding of what the original was. I'm sorry if you disagree with me, but you are not me. And can say whatever you want in the comments section of this review.

That there are so many five star reviews is depressing to me as they represent the lowest common denominator, and that, I suppose, is ultimately what the point of this movie was - to make as much money from as many people as possible. So, with that in mind, on to the review.

Jurassic World attempts to be an exciting summer blockbuster, and succeeds at busting blocks, but little else. Chris Pratt is reasonably good and, after you've seen the movie, you'll understand why that isn't saying very much, as Chris Pratt is normally extremely charismatic, fun to watch, and for him to be so poorly utilized is a shame. His role is slightly flat, not his performance, but his role, having not much to really do. He swaggers. He smirks. He saves lives. And he is honestly the best part of the movie. This is where the faintest of praise ends, unfortunately. For the amount of time, money, and minds (raised on the first movie, no less. So they should have a general idea of what made the first movie work so well) that went into it, it's remarkably thoughtless, having only built a house of cards upon the ruins of Jurassic Park, both literally and figuratively. (How something that is the product of such a thoughtfully produced movie - Jurassic Park - is so thoughtless is beyond me. All of the references to the original are shallow lip service to fans. None of the movie makes sense, and none of the main characters - not performers - apart from Pratt, are remotely likable.)

They took something and built on it without any thought or consideration. It's almost as if lack of humility was a prerequisite for writing this drivel.

To quote Dr. Ian Malcom from the original, ""...it didn't require any discipline to attain it. You read what others had done and you took the next step. You didn't earn the knowledge for yourselves, so you don't take any responsibility for it. You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish something as fast as you could, and before you even knew what you had, you patented it, and packaged it, and slapped it on a plastic lunchbox, and now [bangs on table], you're selling it, you want to sell it.""

Even adding a character from the original in an attempt to tie the first movie to this mistake was sheer gall. The scientist from Jurassic Park who developed the original method for cloning the dinosaurs learned nothing from his mistakes in the original. So he returns in this movie as a egomaniac who will create whatever he wants for the sake of money, having not grown or learned at all. He escaped death in the first movie solely to be used as nostalgia here. This is a mechanic they repeat over and over and over, to no effect. They show the night vision goggles from the first, and after 22 years the batteries still work? This is done solely to see them light up and nothing more, for nostalgia. Pathetic writing masquerading as a clever nod to the original. This continues throughout the entire movie. This trend of referencing JP is completely thoughtless and only serves to highlight the fact that no one had an original idea during the production of Jurassic World. Apart of course for coming up with new dinosaurs to amaze, none of which actually succeed. It's like they tried so hard they lost sight of what the original was actually about. But, unsurprisingly, they didn't try. Not really. What they did was select images for the posters and clips for the trailers, then built a movie around that. As if audiences are so slack-jawed as to accept anything with enough action as exciting. John Hammond, the creator of the first park is said to have given the new proprietor his blessing to create the new park, and he is rightfully killed in an insane and pointless way. Thankfully Hammond dies off-screen in before the events in this movie so Richard Attenborough's ghost doesn't haunt the production.

Ultimately, you don't care whether anyone in the movie lives or dies, and as a result, you don't care about the movie itself. How can we watch people be slaughtered and come out having felt nothing? Well dear reader, that's because we have been desensitized to the concept of the value of human life. At least Jurassic Park was made before a time when cgi mass death was even possible, and each life lost on screen was required to be played by an actual person close up enough to be forced to feel for them. It's sad, really. And while it's better than both of the sequels which came before, it isn't a movie you will want to rewatch repeatedly. The first movie succeeded because of the story, and to a slightly lesser extent, the technical achievements. I have no problem with the concept of sequels or reboots or extensions of an original story, but for this to be considered a 5 star movie is absurd, and depressing. There's nothing more I can say about this without ruining it for you, so I'll warn you now, there are spoilers ahead which will truly spoil nothing. If you can't see the telegraphed plot points then you're not paying attention.

***SPOILERS***

These are but a few of the almost endless list of things wrong with this movie. There is no structure to the movie, therefor there is not structure to this section of the review.

Why even introduce the family at the beginning? Bc it's a cheap way to get you to feel for a kid whose parents are getting a divorce. That's almost offensively simple minded. Unfortunately the great Judy Greer is saddled with the task of being the only grounding element in this movie, and her limited screen time, thousands of miles away from the action, isn't remotely enough. Why isn't the park built in such a way that if the worst was to happen (a catastrophe of dinosaurs) that the visitors would be safe? Because massive body counts for the sake of supposed excitement are what the filmmakers thought would be the most intriguing part. (The original was excellent for the opposite reason. Each death was felt, and not wasted.) Why don't the gyrospheres self right themselves? Bc they need to get the kids upside down so they could escape, not bc the gravity suddenly disappeared. Why does all of the technology such as the walkie talkies and cell phones suddenly not work when they're needed most? Not bc there is a problem with the technology, but because they couldn't think of a better way to separate the characters and get the plot moving. Why does the owner of the park follow directly in Hammond's footsteps and create an unsafe park that couldn't possibly contain the dinosaurs in an emergency? Not because he was a considerate man, but because the writers weren't very good. There is nothing learned from the original Jurassic Park, either the movie or the fictional park from the film. In fact, the park in Jurassic World is somehow less well engineered and thought out than the original. There is nothing about this movie that endears it to you, or you to it. Do you want to care about what happens to the characters? No. It's almost as if the writers want you to root for the dinosaur's role in the deaths of innocent people, bc they certainly didn't want you to root for the random bystanders to escape and survive. Even minor characters die brutally solely for the sake of the death, even though you know nothing about them to cause you to care if they die. There is zero humanity in this... Thing. I hesitate to call it a movie at this point.

Ultimately the solution of the only remaining management alive (Bryce Howard), who has no knowledge or expertise of anything but management, is to unleash a T. Rex to clean up the mess, and to fight the genetically engineered Indominous Rex (which it does with the inexplicable help of the raptors which were just explained to have a connection with the newly ""ingeneered"" Indominous Rex bc the Indominous Rex was created with raptor DNA, so that makes no sense), but it was really so they could recreate another of many iconic scenes from the original (the T. Rex bellowing in his hero pose while destruction and devastation settle in around him) in a vain attempt to curry what little favor there is left, or that you are willing to give them. Ultimately all of the references to Jurassic Park were used to save their own butts.

And what's worse, after 22 years they haven't even made the CGI dinosaurs look more convincingly real than the originals. The main draw, the dinosaurs, are no more convincing than two and a half decades ago. Yes there is better lighting on the skin and more rippling muscle and sinew under it, and since the environments are cgi the dinosaurs tend to fit better into the virtual world they themselves come from, but they hold no more realism, no more impact on the viewer, unless the viewer is a small child with no experience of moviegoing. Not to mention the fact that 22 years ago it was a technological achievement, and now it is a simple fact of moviegoing life, so cgi dinosaurs for the sake of cgi dinosaurs is not exciting in and of itself. There needs to be something more, perhaps an actor's performance, maybe, to move the viewer to feel something.

I have to repeat that so I'm clear, after 22 years of technological advances in computer graphics, even the actual, real world advances in technology haven't improved or made more real or interesting the dinosaurs in the movie. I'm seriously at a loss. How this movie got to the point of production would be a mystery if not for the fact that human greed is a very real thing.

I don't want you to think that the performers are so terrible that they ruin the movie. No, they are at worst, fine. What ruins this movie is the scale of the gall. The immense and unforgivable ignorance of the filmmakers.

For all the references to the original they've completely missed the point. If the world wasn't filled with truly disgusting acts, this would be vile to me.

Even the filmmakers admit to coming up with ideas by saying, ""What haven't we seen? What new thing can we do? Well, we haven't seen a dinosaur in the water, so let's do that."" Hey, directors, Jurrasic Park didn't succeed because of the dinosaurs, it succeeded because of the fact that characters are developed and experience something horrific and terrifying, having been written and directed and performed by talented people, not because the budget was $200m.

I feel genuinely bad for Spielberg as he sits next to Colin Trevorrow, the director of this farce, during a taped interview, as Trevorrow extols the virtues of the ""amazing"" sequel he's created. Spielberg just looks dejected and sad, his arms crossed, slumped down in his producers chair. And so he should. For him to be proud of this would be even more depressing. But I understand that a property as valuable as JP wouldn't be left to sit on a shelf when it could be milked for everything it's worth.

This witless cash-grab is almost without redemption. Thank god for Chris Pratt, without whom this would fail entirely, even though he so poorly written for that it should be a crime. He's impossibly charismatic and his part was written as flatly as you can imagine. Yet, he still makes this abomination nearly watchable in the moments he's on screen.

I won't even get into the pointless subplot about the military using InGen to develop Dino-weapons. It's so tacked on and unconsidered as to be in a movie mocked by Mystery Science Theater.

You know what I wanted to do after watching this movie? Watch Jurrasic Park and Guardians of the Galaxy back to back, which was ultimately what I did. if you're on the fence about watching this you should take my advice and rewatch the original, then watch Guardians of the Galaxy, because at least that will capture the sort of fun a summer blockbuster should be. I really wish I had paid attention to the myriad negative reviews and stayed away. But I was convinced the combination of Pratt and Jurrasic Park would be impossible to mess up. I've never been so wrong. In a world of remakes, reboots, and revamps such as A Good Day to Die Hard, Terminator Genesis(I refuse to spell it the way it's stylized), and the various others I can't even see fit to name, this is depressingly at the bottom of the barrel. Only Die Hard's last sequel is less interesting. If it's true that we are genuinely out of original ideas and that everything is just a rehash of some previously existing story, then this is the tombstone on the grave of originality.

If you have any love for the original then this will probably (almost surely) make you mad. If you've never seen the original bc you don't like watching ""old movies"", you might think this was a clever and well thought out movie. If so, I'm sorry.",1445731200,5,14923,4.604362542309139

I know that's a cold thing to say, but if you all saw the same movie I did, there might be someone out there that felt the same as I did. At least Jurassic Park(which I compare this movie to, after all, I believe that movie received just about the same amount of hype and DIDN'T disappoint.) had colorful characters, which made me want to root for them. Alan Grant, Lex and Tim, Dr. Robert Muldoon, Dr. Ian Malcolm, Dr. Ellie Sadler, Dennis Nedry, John Hammond, and last but certainly not least, Dr. Alan Grant(played beautifully by Sam Neill).

All that is required is special effects, CGI, a computer geek at the helm and product placement marketing corporate person in a suit to run the show.  I have loved dinosaurs since I was a kid in the 1960's/70's.  I have seen ALL The Dino movies. The flicks made today do not tell a story.  They are an unplayable video game and that is it.  Jurassic World is a rip-off of Jurassic Park.  Can't anyone use any original imagination anymore?  I would suggest that Universal Studios goes back to original source material on what made Dino's in movies cool in the first place.  Do some research.  Show a great battle between a T-Rex and a Triceratops.  Or an Allosaurus vs an Apato/ Brontosaurus.  Use more puppets and less CGI.  Study Ray Harryhausen.  Get rid of the over-used raptors and introduce other dinosaurs.

The acting was not as good. Parts of it were fun like when the boys rode around in the bubble and then had to escape. I don't think the two lead actors had great chemistry which we saw in the first films. They just didn't gel. Some of it was a copy not as good like the scene in the lab when the one scientist was messy in his desk area. We already saw that in the first film.

6695463,4,B00NYC65M8,"Jurassic World  Universal Pictures  2015  PG-13 Blu-Ray special edition

This is one of the blockbuster films for 2015.  My review is written for those who have NOT watched it and are still undecided whether or not they will.  As one of the special features commented, this was a sequel for a new generation, who may or may not have watched the first 3 in the series.  In keeping with that, and considering that the original actors are 20 years older, this series unlike the Star Wars sequel uses an almost all-new cast for the story.
The setting however is very much like the first movie.  Story-wise its on the same (hypothetical) island somewhere off the coast of Costa Rica.  In fact at one point you get a glimpse of the now jungle-overgrown rooms where the first park was located.
Despite the tendency of life not to follow externally-imposed rules, which doesnt end up so good when it involves the worlds largest carnivores and human beings as their hors de ouvres, the lure of continuing and expanding genetic recreation work (for profit) was irresistible and now we have a NEW!  BIGGER!  BETTER! Live dinosaur theme parkkind of like Disneyland with triceratops, stegosaurs, T Rex and, lets not forget, our new, largest-ever carnivore, dubbed Indominus Rex.
Call me jaded, but I just didn't see truly memorable moments in this film like there were in the first (or even in the second): the dinosaur close behind in the rear view mirror which helpfully observes that images may be closer than they appear; the ominous shaking of the ground and droplets shaken off leaves as an unseen T Rex approaches; the truly scary scenes with a pack of velociraptors on the hunt (although yes, we do again have velociraptors on the hunt, as well as ground shaking, droplets dropping, jeeps driving in reversesadly its TOO MUCH like the original to be really groundbreaking: in other words, the studio played it safe as they usually do with mega-million dollar sequels).  And I miss the original cast too: the enthusiastic but misguided Hamilton who ran the first theme park; Jeff Goldblum as the chaos theorist; even Laura Dern and Sam Neill as the archaeologist couple.
I duly noted the controversy over the somewhat anti-feminist images in this movie: the heroine seemingly running through the jungle for much of the movie still dressed in high heels; the rascally, smelly, muscular alpha male rescuing her and sweeping her off her feet, (a contemporary, scruffy knight in shining armor) and all of that.  And I didn't really care.  In some ways I felt it satirized the tendency of our society to still work much like it did in the early 20th century, despite our protestations to the contrary.  Anyhow I became too engrossed in the overall action to even notice whether or not she still had her high heels on after the heroine finally (literally) rolls up her sleeves and gets serious.

Notice what I just said.  Despite all my comments about the shortcomings of this film I still became engrossed in the action.  Whether the story is derivative or not, this film tells it with unrestrained enthusiasm and somehow manages to fairly well-balance sheer survival, good guys vs. bad guys, a romance story, and the heartwarming kids reconnecting with each other and their parents theme used in somewhere around 50% of PG-13 films.  Speaking of which let;s speak about that rating too.  This continues what I feel is a misguided ratings policy in which people being eaten alive, blood spattering into the camera and bullets flying is PG-13 material, but don't dare show too much of the human body in a tender setting, or it has to be labeled R.  Seriously?
Bottom line: its probably impossible to re-tell a Jurassic World story and make it top the original.  But translating the story for a younger generation, the film did a decent job.  In part they had good luck as they cast Chris Pratt in the lead male role before he became famous in Guardians of the Galaxy.  As for the lead female, Bryce Dallas Howardwell shes no Merryl Streep or Cate Blanchett.  Or maybe Im just suspicious of any female with Dallas in her name...I give this a B.  PS-there are naturally multiple flavors of this film in disc form.  Mine came with a circular metallic case with the blue-and-silver Jurassic World logo stamped on the top cover.  Inside were the Blu-Ray and DVD versions, plain and simple.  No ""digital"" version,  No separate chock-a-block special features disc, and I didn't get the 3-D version.  2-D seemed plenty real enough for me.",1445644800,9,4518,4.80595084087969

6695546,2,B00NYC65M8,"I own the first three Jurrasic Movies, so was excited to watch this one.  What a huge disappointment.  This seemed more like an old Saturday afternoon TV movie, with some CGI.  The acting was mediocre at best.  Early on it became hard for the story to convey any believability at all when the lead female character ran around in 5-inch pencil thin heels, not just at work, but also running around in the woods, on muddy ground, and then outrunning dinosaurs in those heels.  Was this a joke nod to women refusing to wear heels to the Oscars recently?  C'mon, it's the year 2015.  The majority of women are smart enough not to torture themselves in extreme heels, especially at work. At the minimum, women keep a pair of comfortable shoes at their desk for the commute.  Later in the film, after a bunch of implausible running in circles right near two dinausaurs that are battling, the woman is shown lying on the street in a contrived Victoria's-Secret-like pose...ridiculous and cheesy.  Makes one think, ""Who writes this stuff?"".  The soundtrack in the movie was also a disappointment, not tracking well with the action.  It seemed to repeat a few short themes from the original movies' soundtracks over and over again.  I wish I could say that the plot line was interesting and evolved, but plot it seemed predictable and dull.  Characters behaved in complete ignorance of anything substantive that happened in the past movies.  If that was supposed to be the point, it was lost by the lack of any compelling new direction to the continued story. There was no appreciable buildup of suspense in this movie and when there was a little, it was totally predictable.  What did I like about this movie to give it 2 stars instead of just one?  Well, who wouldn't love to have a few velociraptor buddies... completely ludicrous in the movie, but a fun, kid-like thought.  They made the dinosaurs look pretty cute in this one.  None of that really enhanced the film, but made it a little less painful to watch.",1445558400,3,2006,4.699140401146132

6695562,5,B00NYC65M8,"I would recommend this movie to anyone who asked (and even some who didn't)! If you didn't like Jurassic Park, you should still see this movie. It's not as horror-filled as Jurassic Park; Jurassic World is about bravery, loyalty, determination, and (obviously) fighting the bad guys, not about people getting butchered in an evil park. It has a perfect structure (e.g. a beginning intro to the characters, then a presentation of the problem in a thrilling way,and some twists and turns, as well as some funny parts, and a satisfying conclusion) and just the right touch from the script and acting. The actors fit into their roles very well, and the dinosaurs look amazing! The dinosaurs also have a uniquely humane touch (except for the big, evil one); there's a touching personality in each of the raptors. Overall, this is definitely a five star movie!",1445558400,,854,4.896551724137931

Boy was I disappointed in the 3D effects and there were so many parallels to the original movie that were done much better in the original that the new movie was kind of annoying to watch. I turned it off before getting to the end.

The next day I wondered if I had put the 3D version in my player. I pop the disc from the player, put on my reading glasses, and discovered the first disc in the package is the DVD version, oops! Disc 1 is actually the third disc in the package. Having now watched the 3D version, I have to say this is the only way to watch this movie. You will be so engrossed in the 3D effects that you will forget about the parallels to the original movie.

The film seemed to be just a rehash of the first Jurassic movie with better CGI effects.
I felt that the plot was weak and the actors were uninspired.  Perhaps, it's like the heroine in the film stated, ""Dinosaurs are just old hat"".

I loved the special effects and thought they seemed very realistic and seamlessly wove throughout the movie.  The dinosaurs seemed as real as the actors!

6695615,2,B00NYC65M8,"If you want to see state-of-the-art computer-generated dinosaurs, ""Jurassic World"" won't disappoint. And, if you're a big fan of product placement and continuity errors, the movie is a must-see, too. Hardcore fans of the original ""Jurassic Park"" will recognize lines of dialogue, scenes and characters that pay homage to the 1993 sci-fi thrill ride. I have grown weary, though, with how sci-fi flicks so often play the secret-military-weapon angle. I guess the ""Jurassic World"" screenwriters couldn't resist that temptation. There's more on-screen chemistry between Chris Platt's character Owen Grady and his raptors than with his love interest, Claire Dearing, played by Bryce Dallas Howard, daughter of film director and actor Ron Howard. It was good to see Vincent D'Onofrio, who portrayed bad guy Vic Hoskins (and the alien Edgar in ""Men in Black""). Having said all that, ""Jurassic World"" isn't nearly as bad as critics believed, in my humble opinion. It's a fun flick to watch. The pacing is brisk. The special effects are awesome.

The packaging of this product is horrendous. I pre-ordered this movie months ago before they had images of the actual item up, it was just basic image saying jurassic world that I saw, with a statement saying more details would follow closer to release date. Even just looking at the main image that is posted now, it looks like a normal disc case.

When I got the actual item in the mail the other day, I was quite disappointed and annoyed. The case for this thing is a round tin with the discs inside. Without the plastic wrap, the case will not stand up and just keeps tipping over. It will not fit on the shelf with my other movies, as it is thick and bulky. It will not fit on the dvd/blu ray tower i have. So basically it just sits on the table, annoying me, because it will not fit anywhere. With all of the cook things that could have been done with the packaging, a crappy, bulky, oddly shaped tin is lackluster.",1445558400,7,1050,4.245

The dino's do not look any better or more realistic than they did in the original!! However, they looked good even back then, so...... Another problem I had was that this movie implied that ancient reptiles give off a detectable heat-signature, as if dinosaurs were ""warm-blooded"". This is just to continue the narrative propaganda for evolutionists that want to ""prove"" that dinosaurs turned into birds over time. I consider this as a ploy to brainwash youngsters, and gullible adults, so they will more easily believe this unproven theory.  Anyway, I enjoyed it but probably won't watch it again. I still think Jurassic Park 3 was the best, except for the ""feathers"" they put on the velociraptors, which the fossil record doesn't support.",1445558400,,868,5.06993006993007

On my newer player, I have a good Internet connection and made sure the player's software is up-to-date.

I'd just like a replacement DVD, but don't see a way to request that.  Amazon allows me to get a refund or a replacement of the entire package, but my Blu-ray version plays great, and I already redeemed the Digital version.

6695729,3,B00NYC65M8,"minuses:
The sound quality was poor.
The dialogue was poor, when you could hear it. They mumble a lot. And when you could hear it, who cares?
The plot is almost an exact copy of the first. With a little Aliens thrown in. Science vs nature, progress vs caution, etc.
The fact that the poor babysitter apparently got swallowed whole didn't seem to faze the kids or the heroine at all.
Apparently, the raptors can run full speed for miles. In reality, most predators (cats, crocs, etc.) have that short burst of speed, but these raptors can sprint for hours!
What happened to all the flying dinosaurs??
The hero carries his gun around everywhere, but never remembers to use it when the dinosaurs attack.
The hero can ride a motorcycle full speed through a jungle at night, and he never even wobbles or leans or even turns the handlebars. Wow!
How come, with 20,000 people on this island, all the meat eaters always focus on just the four main characters?
Man, these dinosaurs have appetites! The super tyrannosaurus ate his weight in humans, and never choked on the guns, etc.
pluses:
The idea of a trainable or loyal raptor was interesting.
The references to Disney and SeaWorld type parks was interesting.
Lots of action. Everytime the heroes stop to catch their breath, they look behind them and, yep, there's another dinosaur!",1445558400,10,1327,4.748917748917749

There is nothing to recommend this movie except perhaps the special effects, which actually aren't much better than the first Jurassic movie. It was without a doubt, the most shallow, insipid, badly acted and scripted, waste of time I've encountered in quite awhile. The dinosaur's footprints were deeper than any of the characters in this movie. The prior Jurassic movies were so much better on all levels.

(Why not show some of the training that the bond producesThe other story line that would have been interesting is the genetics of the new dinosaur.

A dino-land is developed, things go awry due to a genetic miscalculation and havoc ensues. Same movie, different dress, except this one is tattered. The only thing that recommends this at all is the special effects.",1445472000,8,499,4.940476190476191

Most of the characters seemed like extreme stereotypes of each one they played, kind of lacking in anything that caused you to like them as people.  Chris Pratt was good, but the role didn't quite have enough too it to let him really fill the screen, except for a few moments when he did.  The kids were so all over the place with their behavior that you really didn't want to identify with them.  Their parents probably needed to get a divorce.  And the Aunt never really convinced me that she'd be someone who'd be a good match for Pratt's character.  The whole fixation with the Raptors is getting old.

The CGI was equally good with the exception of the scene with the creature that jumps out of the water and engulfs the shark bait. In a later scene (near the end)it exits the water and in that scene it looks much smaller in size than the first scene. In my opinion, that first scene as seen in the trailers, I have felt was out of scale in relation to the supposed depth of the water. It bugged me so much I did not go see it at the theaters, and it placed into doubt the other scenes probably would be similar or uncharacteristically unreal in regards to previous movies. The raptors following Pratt's character as a Alpha also was a hard nut to swallow as well. Despite these shortcomings  it was still entertaining and worth the streaming rental. Seeing it in the theaters at theater prices, maybe not.",1445472000,,863,4.427672955974843

If the producers had a little bit of imagination, the big monster-intelligent-mean beast would have been REALLY big, like three times the movie's size. And he would have eaten stupid kids just for fun. And, no matter what, you just don't tame velociraptors and don't conquer them with love. Oh, but what can we do? Only few of us would have loved an R-rated film. We would have requested that it would have lots of gore and blood, and the superfluous groomed women in high heels and all stupid kids be eaten in a horrible way by the 30 feet tall monster animal so the prevailing lunacy would stop once and forever.",1445472000,,903,4.7215189873417724

6695955,5,B00NYC65M8,"Jurassic World is the fourth movie in a franchise that makes dinosaurs the stars. The perfect summer film, it features action all the way through with few slow spots, mostly because director Colin Trevorrow keeps assorted dinosaurs on screen most of the time.

The island off the coast of Costa Rica that first saw the rebirth of dinosaurs in Jurassic Park, Steven Spielbergs 1993 megahit, has gone corporate. Now a massive theme park along the lines of Disney World, it attracts tourists from all over the world. The attractions operations manager, Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard), is highly organized and prides herself on running a tight ship. So thoroughly focused is she on every detail of the parks day-to-day workings that she has delegated the job of looking after her visiting nephews (Nick Robinson, Ty Simpkins) to an assistant.

To keep the customers coming, the research branch of the corporation has been genetically engineering new species. Indominus Rex, a hybrid of Tyrannosaurus and other secret ingredients, will be the parks newest cash cow.

Animal handler Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) has been training a quartet of velociraptors to respond to simple commands. His success at this endeavor has caught the attention of Hoskins (Vincent DOnofrio), a military contractor who sees the potential of the animals use in warfare. When the parks dinosaurs start acting up as we expect and other characters are panicking, Grady uses his knowledge and instincts to deal with the crisis. Pratt has an Indiana Jones aura about him  down to earth, knowledgeable, sensitive, and ready to step in when his know-how and guts are most needed.

Among the remarkable visual sequences, some are surprisingly tranquil, such as a park ride in which two people enter a contraption much like a hamster ball that travels through open grassland filled with gigantic herbivores who amble by, unconcerned by the occasional intrusion of these humans rolling by in bubble containers. There are also numerous ghost-like holograms throughout the park, heralding various exhibits. These look especially cool with the films 3D enhancement.

But when it comes down to what this picture is all about, its the dinosaurs running amok, rendered more realistically than ever. One terrific sequence after another builds to an exciting climax. Folks who come for the dinosaurs will leave satisfied. Although the plot recycles some of the elements of Jurassic Park, such as children in peril, science versus commerce, and humanitys arrogance at attempting to control nature, it also addresses the issue that the dinosaurs are living creatures and deserve to be treated as such rather than as mere profitable attractions.

The plot echoes the challenge of real-world Hollywood studios who have to freshen up franchises with whats bigger, better, greater to keep audiences coming. Rated PG-13, Jurassic World delivers those thrills with exceptionally well crafted sequences of prehistoric animals gone amok in a modern world.

The 3-disc 3D Blu-ray Combo Pack contains three formats: 3D Blu-ray, 2D Blu-ray, and DVD. Bonus features exclusive to Blu-ray include Closest Shaves, a series of clips from all the films in the franchise showing scary encounters with dinosaurs; Chris Pratt and director Colin Trevorrow discussing key moments in the film supported by behind-the-scenes footage; and a making-of featurette. Bonus features on all formats include deleted scenes and the featurettes Dinosaurs Roam Once Again and Chris and Colin Take on the World.",1445472000,,3530,5.291071428571429

If you are considering watching this out of an interest in actual paleontology... it's going to be painful at times, but it is still a pretty fun film.  All in all, it is not the hideous waste of time I had braced myself for.  The children in this one are less annoying than any of the previous, that was a nice change.  The cliche corporate staffers, boss, and nefarious goons all got to be the bad crappy actors cast to fill a cliche this time around.  I think this was better than any of the other sequels, possibly better than the original.

That said, I hated so many things about it.  Pterosauria attacking people, was sort of ridiculous.  Flying predators do not attack things that outweigh them, period.  Hollow bones light enough to fly demand the trade, height, view, and mobility, but you eat smaller prey, which is fine because body weight versus body size are so different for flyers than walkers.  They made the flying dinosaur sort of Mothra/Rodan instead of actual animals.  That was the only part of the movie that just straight up sucked.  Made me sad that kids without specific knowledge or guidance watching this will in some ways be dumber for it.  I do wish American media did not have that annoying trait constantly.",1445472000,,1281,4.541484716157205

Overall, I thought the acting and script was good but there were a couple scenes that made me scratch my head but other than that the acting was good. 100% loved the raptors in this movie! In fact, these raptors are my favorite raptors in the entire franchise and Blue is my all time favorite raptor. I had a love hate relationship for the Indominus Rex because she was such a bad ass but she was also so mean. But of course, Rexy (original Jurassic Park T-Rex) was my favorite in this movie. I just about balled my eyes out when Claire realesed her, when she was about to die, and when she climbed the mountain and roared. This movie does have some issues but the Jurassic Park franchise (yes even the third one. That was painful to say.) will always be my favorite franchise until the day I die. Buy this gift set!

great purpose: to remind me of the difference between an Artist (Spielberg) and a hack (whoever directed this crap, I don't even want to know). This
was one long, boring, loud CGI video game. I couldn't care a whit about a single character.  The story... story???  Huh???  Ummm.... and was that

6695988,5,B00NYC65M8,"First of all, this was a great movie. It does not take long to become engrossed in the film and be on the edge of your seat. The CGI is very good and creates very realistic looking dinosaurs. There are also some great behind-the-scenes type special features if that's your thing (it's definitely mine).

I was a little afraid that this might end up horrible like all the other remake movies/sequels of old movies that seem to be coming out lately. It by far out did the 2nd and 3rd movies and is on the same level as the original in my opinion. If you liked any of the first 3 movies, this one is a must buy!

As far as the limited edition packaging, I'm not a big fan. Since I pre-ordered it, that's just what I got. It is a sort of metal circle that has the 2 discs inside 2 little cardboard sleeves. The rest of the case can be turned into a pedestal type thing where you can place the metal can. As nice as it looks, I prefer as normal case where I can easily just put it in with the rest of the movies on a shelf and easily pulled back off the shelf without fear of the metal can falling off.

6695997,3,B00NYC65M8,"Jurassic Park has reinvented itself with the investment of some Muslim billionaire and calls itslef Jurassic World. People I suppose have forgotten the past as they vacation there like Disney Land. Two people are divorcing so they ship their kids off to Jurassic World for a week as the wife/mother's sister is the head of marketing of Jurassic World. In order to ""stay relevant"" and ""keep them coming back"" they strain themselves to create something new and awe inspiring for the crowds. So this time they have ""invented"" a dinosaur. But it is a secret what the scientist made it from. They know it is part T-rex. But he won't say what the other parts are. I'm sure you can guess that this thing gets out and starts eating people and smashing cars. People run around from it but trying to kill it.

This is just Jurassic Park . . . what do they say . . . rebooted. Same plot. Same predictable plot. Different characters. And this time just like last time Spielberg's liberal ambitions of villainizing corporations as inhumane is front and center. But given the proclivities of liberals these days so-too is the anti-military gun movement. It is sad. But predicatble, sickeningly.

The acting is stilted. Dry. Boring. I wills say that Chris Prat looks like a normal man instead of some fuzzy faced man boy. But his clothes are again too little for him. And he has an attitude that is supposed to be attractive. I just find it stupid. And that lead actress is so emotionless so stone faced she is like a robot instead of an actress. Just no chemistry.

Of course the minority parade is brought out. A blue-eyed mom and dad. A blue eyed mop headed younger brother. But some hispanic looking older brother with dark features, dark hair, and dark eyes. Yeah, OK. The Indian masquerading as the Muslim. And the Indian IT guy named ""Larry"". Not very appetizing for the eyes, mind or ears.

And what? The very first emotional death scene of a dinosaur? Lawdy, lawdy. The tears. The agonizing slow death. Just like watching this movie.
I found myself able to recite the lines at the same time as the actors. And no, I'm not clairvoyant.

6696005,5,B00NYC65M8,"""Jurassic World"" is a well paced movie with excellent acting.  The fact is that genetic manipulation is the real monster in this movie while the created dinosaur is the symbol of what happens when Man tries to play God.  Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are very believable in their parts as a raptor trainer and a park executive who, apparently, had been on a ""date"" once and eventually get find themselves having to overcome their egos in order to survive. The two young actors who play the brothers work together very well.  Ty Simpkins, who plays the younger brother, starts out as a hyperactive innocent and the bane of his older brother, played by Nick Robinson, but by the end of the movie their bond if sealed.  Unlike in ""Jurassic Park"", the raptors are sympathetic in this film due to Chris Pratt's conditioning of them.

6696013,5,B00NYC65M8,"I didn't get to see Jurassic World in the theater, so my first experience was watching the Blu-ray version when the DVD release came out on October 20, 2015.  The film is non-stop fun from the first frame to the last, with only a few predictable moments where it lapse into the ""who dies next?"" syndrome of horror-survivor flicks.  Mostly the filmmakers checked their political baggage at the door, avoiding a persistent flaw in Hollywood releases in the past couple of decades.

There's a hint of ""evil corporation seeks to maximize profit"" but even that silly theme is presented more as the far more factual and realistic ""sometimes people are really idiots!""  (I worked for NASA for several decades.  Trust me; sometimes people in positions of authority can be complete idiots despite having hundreds of experts advising them not to be.)  In this case, the idiocy is gene-splicing critters to make a beast even more scary than any dinosaur that ever walked the earth; and then, of course, losing control of it.  There is none of the tedious preaching about silly philosophies that spoiled Jeff Goldblum's performance in the original Jurassic Park movie.  And perhaps best of all, Jurassic World's writers correctly use personal pronouns!

There did seem to be a missing element that I couldn't quite put my finger on until I'd watched the film and all of the fun extras that came with the Blu-ray release:  There's no moment of the Grand Reveal.  A movie as grand and expansive as this really needs that glorious moment that played so well in the first movie, where after the first encounter with a brontosaurus, Richard Attenborough says ""Welcome to Jurassic Park!"" and the camera pans to a grand vista of all the dinosaurs gamboling on the savannah.  Sure, it's been done; but if you're going to make a movie like this, do it again!  It's a grand moment that sells the entire film to come.  Jurassic World does have a moment of Grand Reveal, but instead of seeing the wonders of the natural world, we see a sprawling man-made theme park.  Cool, but hardly as engaging as all those critters in their natural environment.

Never sit next to an engineer at an SF movie:  Although I thoroughly enjoy these dinosaurs movies, I do have to work to suspend disbelief when I accept the notion that, if we really could clone these huge beasts today, that they could survive in modern world.  The issue that haunts my mind the temperature.  Earth was much hotter during the 300 million years that dinosaurs roamed the planet, and those high temperatures might have been what was necessary to support gigantism.  Immediately after Earth cooled down, presumably because of a screen of dust created by a big meteor impact, all the megafauna suddenly disappeared forever.  So our cloned beasties just might not be able to live on Earth today, even if we carefully groomed a whole island near the equator just for them.  Rats.",1445385600,,2915,4.799599198396794

A few more things DIRECTLY in one's face make for even MORE fun--- and do not scare the kiddies TOO much.
As good as the 3-D disc is, the 2-D is its equal, even better in many respects.  Interesting extras complete the package.  This one is a real trip for the whole family (except maybe the littlest ones.)  Have fun on the ride!!
The round-can disc case is a mixed bag here.  It looks great, opens easily (unlike some others of this type!) and houses the discs themselves in individually-printed sleeves.  It's an attractive package but should be a bit difficult to store.",1445385600,,817,4.541095890410959

Of course I'm talking about the T-Rex and Indominus Rex statues. These statues are a great size and well detailed. Two things I was worried about given the price tag, but after seeing them it was totally worth it. They come with a ticket of authenticity but they aren't numbered so it doesn't care much weight. Going back to the movie it comes with several versions of the movie which is great if you have friends that want to borrow it or have access to them ( 3d/blue-ray/dvd). I would highly recommend the movie to fans or the original movies or those who are just looking for a good action movie. I could talk about this movie for ever but to sum it up its a fun movie that can be enjoyed by all age groups.",1445385600,,825,4.294871794871795

6696031,5,B00NYC65M8,"As a fan of the first three, I welcomed Jurassic World; embracing the fact its set in an operational park for the first time, the occasionally cheesy dialogue, and Bryce Dallas Howard running in high-heels. Here's what we get with the Blu-ray:

Jurassic World is presented in an uncommon 2.00:1 ratio. The framing features small black bars on the top and bottom of the image. In my opinion, its pleasingly reminiscent of 65mm (i.e. West Side Story, 2001: A Space Odyssey). Quality-wise, it's everything you'd expect from a modern release. Lush and vibrant. Detail really shines in the crowded park and jungle scenes.

Sure, the sound is not Dolby Atmos, but we do get a lively DTS-HD 7.1 track, sporting great directionality in the obligatory action scenes. Other lesser-moments, such as Owen's ""raptor-training"" scene surprised me as well, with the sounds of chirping raptors in each corner.

Among the extras not listed on the back, we get Jurassic World: Presented by Barbasol  A montage of close shaves characters encounter throughout the series (its obvious from the editing its just a cleverly-overblown ad). And thats basically it. I wouldve liked to have had a commentary, but I guess Universals saving it for the inevitable double-dip when this new trilogy clocks out. Honorable mention goes to the Deleted Scenes - There's a rather funny one involving Owen, Claire and ""one big pile of s---"" that pays homage to a similar scene from the first film.

I also checked out the DVD. While I don't plan on watching it as much, I was a little surprised that image quality was rather mediocre for a 2015 film. It could be that Im spoiled by HD, but while the image is generally clear, fine details, like signs from distances are hazy. Even the end credits were so blurry, they reminded me of my last eye exam. The only extras on the DVD are what is listed under Additional Features on the cover.

On a side note  Its interesting to see how Universal has started using Vortex-cases (like Sony and Disney) with their current releases.",1445385600,3,2034,4.810888252148997
6696032,1,B00NYC65M8,"I regret that there are not enough negative stars to give this movie.

So lets start from the beginning.

I am currently watching this movie on a 4k tv and a 1080p blu-ray ... I can see the pours on peoples faces with such clarity I had only wished they didn't zoom the camera in that close.

Pro Tip - if you want to survive in this world do the EXACT opposite of what any of the non Chris Pratt characters recommend and you will make it. As all they do in this movie is make terrible after terrible decisions that anyone with 1/2 a functioning brain would say ... lets not and never said we ever though of it.... ever.

Also Pro Tip - No children die, no matter what .. So if a dino is after you just immediately shield yourself with children and you will be fine.  Be advised, if at any time you put the child down you will be immediately offed by the come-uppance-asauras so DON'T PUT THE KIDS DOWN.  Get one of those Back and Chest Baby harnesses to help protect yourself!

Story - It is all over the place trying to do a retro throwback to the original.  Raptors for military use. Kids in danger. Work-alcoholic mother ignoring her kids. Civilians in danger. Evil scientists secretly working for Ingen.  This movie has it all and its one giant cluster.  I wonder if How it Should of Ended will just make a scene where the Dino breaks out and immediately is met with a 2nd wall .. YOU KNOW LIKE ACTUAL PRISONS HAVE.

Characters - Outside of Chris Pratt ... you are wishing the rest would be eaten.  Not a single one has a redeemable quality.  What you say? what about the guy who channels Jeff Goldbloom from the very start heroically staying behind to help?  Yeah, he doesn't add anything beyond the tried to kiss the nerdy bug eyed girl next to him only to find out she has a boyfriend and isn't interested.  He later opens a door ... that I am sure like EVERY door in the movie had controls next to it ...  What about the head of the park? I hear you sarcastically saying ... you mean the guy who A-Ok'ed a single walled fence with a tiny metal door that had the dinosaur actually jumped or bumped into it would of breached ... or after it got out he made sure all the civilians didn't evac? or the fact he didn't actually send out a force capable of taking down the dino even though ON THE MAP you could clearly see how fast it was traveling towards the civilian center.  Yeah he was such a redeemable character.

Music - They straight up ripped all the music from the 1st movie that you loved and put it in at laughably the worst time ..  you have no further than to wait for the part where the kid has to try and run thru a CGI set piece and open the door to reveal the park (so many things wrong with that moment).  To say the least I do not hate the music, it is the 2nd best thing in this movie ... I hate how it was used as a cheap callback to a better movie.

Edits - My god they are bad.  The worst involve the boss and the helicopter.  Like when he takes off and to show he was new they had the a shot of the copter jerking around above the pad.  Then the very next shot it straightens out and flys normally AND THE VERY NEXT SHOT the cut back to the inside cockpit view and alarms are buzzing but you can see from previous shot and inside the cockpit the chopper is flying normally with no issues.  A few minutes later they show him pretending to take the chopper down.  Cut to external shot .. chopper flying straight and level .. .cut to inside the chopper and Bryce Dallas character is faking like she is being pushed into the roof of the chopper... external shot ... flying normal ...  Best edit mistake ... Chopper WAS crashing and there were no alarms in the cockpit ... THE TIME THEY WOULD ACTUALLY SOUND.

CGI - it goes from cool to bad ..

Just bad moments (Birdemic bad) - Watch the scene where the comically bad looking pterodactyls attack - I kid you not there is a scene at the riding zoo where a person has to fake struggle to take their child off the back of one of the ride animals and can't manage ... and the scene hangs on it so long your brain catches up and you realize you are watching one of those ""Tired of"" commercials where people struggle with simple tasks.

Next best bad scene is EVERY armed person in the movie.  Yes every scene ... Hey guys, dinos are loose and you need to stop them .. GOT IT BOSS I WILL NOT TAKE A 50 Cal or better firearm I will take a severely underpowered 223 (556) that will not penetrate much of anything to stop an armored target ... HOOHAH!!!!

Yes this movie made a billion ... because the marketing team did a phenomenal job with all the callbacks to the good Jurassic Park.

6696033,5,B00NYC65M8,"""Jurassic World"" is great! This is how the story goes: Twenty-two years after the events of Jurassic Park, Isla Nublar now features a fully functioning dinosaur theme park, Jurassic World, as originally envisioned by John Hammond. After 10 years of operation and visitor rates declining, in order to fulfill a corporate mandate, a new attraction is created to re-spark visitors' interest, which backfires horribly.

The cast led by Chris Pratt (as Owen) & Bryce Dallas Howard (as Claire) is great. The directing by Colin Trevorrow (who also co-wrote the screenplay) is great. The story by Rick Jaffa & Amanda Silver & the screenplay by Jaffa, Silver, Trevorrow and Derek Connolly is great.

The music by Michael Giacchino is great. The cinematography by John Schwartzman is great. The film editing by Kevin Stitt is great. The casting by John Papsidera is great. The production design by Edward Verreaux is great. The costume design by Daniel Orlandi is great. The art direction by Doug Meerdink & Christa Munro is great. The set decoration by Ron Reiss, set designs by Ernie Avila, Lorrie Campbell, Todd Cherniawsky, David Chow, Forest Fischer, George Lee-McDonnell, Kevin Loo, Masako Masuda, & Randall D. Wilkins, set dressings by Ty Jones Jr., Paul Mugavero, Luigi Mugavero, John McElroy, C.W. Beliste, John Hill, Genelle Ciccarelli, Mike Murray, Paul Penley & John Tedlie is great. The stunts coordinated by Chris O'Hara is great. The special effects supervised by John Rosengrant (also did the creature design as well), Mark 'Crash' McCreery & Michael Meinardus and coordinated by Cole Taylor & Chris Brenczewski is great. The visual effects supervised by Tim Alexander, Martyn Culpitt, Joseph Kasparian, Katherine Jones & Philippe Theroux and coordinated by Martine Losier, Karina Mariano & Sheldon Smith is great.

This is a great, well-done, well-made and entertaining sequel that is in just about the same company as its original. It is also better than the last two ""Jurassic Park"" movies in the series. Chris Pratt & Bryce Dallas Howard are both solid as usual as Owen & Claire. Colin Trevorrow makes a great impression behind the directing lens, in line with Steven Spielberg (who also executive produced on the film) & Joe Johnston. This is (or was) one of the best movies of the (recently done) summer season and also one of the best action / sci-fi thrillers of the year (also of the recently done summer season), as well, too.",1445385600,7,2442,5.069651741293533

6696038,3,B00NYC65M8,"I'm really sorry, I so wanted to love this movie especially after the rave reviews from the big screen & was so excited when it was finally released on DVD. I was so disappointed, I kept waiting for it to get better & it never did.
I'm old enough that I read the book in the 90's before the original  movie was even thought of. I've seen that original movie many times in the last 20 some years & this one is a poor wannabe.  The characters in the original & follow-ups were believable & likeable, you could develop a relationship with them & root for them during the movie. The people in this one were actors,  period, they had no real personalities & there was no attachments, they were playing their parts. It was an action movie that left a lot to be desired & really left me wanting much more.
I also may have received a defective blu ray disc, got a message on screen ""not support!"". Have started the return process thru Amazon, so easy.
Update: Returned the original & received the replacement today & it plays perfectly. If your disc gives you problems return it, there seem to be several reviews mentioning issues.",1445299200,,1123,4.415458937198068

6696041,4,B00NYC65M8,"Overall, I really enjoyed the film in theater on top of having just re-watched it as a rental again. The original JP was something akin to a religion for me as a kid, and I think JW has come the closest of any of the last few franchise entries to recapping that vibe. I will say, however, that they tried way too hard to smash references to the first two films at a minimum of once every ten minutes. I appreciate the fan-service, guys, but lets try to make a new movie here. Also, a lot of the action and plot will have you spinning your eyes like the tires of an interstate semi, but none of us are legitimately watching dinosaur sci-fi for the bullet-proof logic. Despite that, its certainly entertaining and makes decent use of the PG13 rating. Also, that Bryce Dallas Howard is pretty cute in this =) Looking forward to the next entry, and it'll be interesting to see where they take it from here!",1445299200,9,902,4.34319526627219
6696042,5,B00NYC65M8,"Just arrived today, early evening in perfect condition.
We saw this movie in the theater but not in 3D, and enjoyed it so we decided to pre-order the movie for the little ones who love dinosaurs.
there are a few parts in the movie that are a bit suggestive, but that's the price we have to pay for todays irresponsible movie rating system, its all about the $ and the WOW factor brings in the $. There is also some swear words, but that's one thing I feel our kids hear everywhere anyway, so at least Im around to react as I see fit as a parent. Wouldn't it be great if they also did just a little editing to make a children's version? I know, I know....
The action is slow going in the beginning, but builds up nicely IMO, and middle to end is very cool and exciting and keeps you engaged in the life-like dinos. The new additions are just plain awesome, and the story line along with the bigger than life actual ""Park"" feel really help make this film spectacular. I do not want to place any spoilers in here, so I'll just say, if you're REALLY NEEDING to kill something that's very dangerous, and you have it all lined up and fingers on the trigger(s), as ""Tuco"" says ""just shoot, don't talk"".
So the main actors are a mix of good, to just completely over rated. Howard is a beautiful lady, and does an ""ok"" to good job (except when she sees her NEPHEWS and the way she says ""whoa"" about the older boy sounds like shes at a night club with her hoochies and sees a potential 1 night stand, yeah very creepy and sleezy),  Vince D, Khan and Sy are good as well. Wong comes back and does a great job, very smooth and convincing in his delivery, and even the youngest star Simpkins does a good job with his character. Even the 1000's of extras seem terrified during the appropriate times in the scenes, that was cool to see and really adds to the realistic effect that's there is actually dangerous Dinos trying to eat you (that are not really there), good jobs extras!! lol
But sorry teens, pratt , as always is just another over-rated ""actor"" thats painful to watch. He was a good fit in park and rec as an awkward uncomfortable with speaking his lines without sounding robotic, goofball that just skimmed the script five minute before the take, aka just being himself, but this role could have been played by just about anyone apparently, because the movie still ROCKS.
It was a good purchase, and comes with the BD, DVD, and downloadable version on your pc, tablet, ipad etc.
there are some cool extras as well, everything is on the BD which is nice, so no extra disc to keep track of and store for the ""extras"".

6696054,3,B00NYC65M8,"Jurassicworld was basically mindless scenes of dinosaurs running around and chasing people. In the original Jurassic Park, there was a theme. Basically a warning to men who try to play God with nature. This is the problem with sci if movies nowadays that they have no heart and soul.
It's just mindless CGI with no depth. No theme or morality play that makes the movie a passionate movie.
There was nothing innovative in this film.
Dinosaurs chase people......seen it.
Big bad genetically manipulated dinosaur.....seen it.
One Dino fights another......seen it.
The characters were very bland in this movie. They were there just there to be there. Chris Pratt's character was the only one you cared about. Everyone else was just there to be there and had no real connection and character development. They were like cardboard cutouts inserted to meet their checklist, bad guy, kids, screaming woman etc.
On the plus note it wasn't boring. There was enough action for the dinosaur enthusiast. The dinosaurs looked great and were pretty spot on how they would look in life.
As I mentioned earlier, Chris Pratt was the best character in the movie. He felt the most genuine in the movie. He respected that they were living animals and had a right to live. You believed him. Everyone else was just a clich. The special effects were very well done, it didn't look cartoony. This is such simply a turn your brain off and enjoy kind of film. That works with some films like Pacific Rim but not a sci if masterpiece like Jurassic Park which had depth, heart, soul, great character development and a theme.

The reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because of the packaging. This is without a doubt the stupidest idea for DVD packaging ever.
Ok, so I get the coolness factor of the tin disk. But instead of packing it with something it can actually sit inside, to sit on a shelf, it just sits on top of this little cardboard and flops around. It has a fold-out on the back, so you can display it like a picture frame. Really?

The sculpts of the dueling statues are pretty stellar for a blu ray collectible. Far better in quality over the Rex that came with the Jurassic Park collection a couple years back. The special features are so-so but lack any real insight into the process of creating the movie or any look at the phenomena of the franchise. They're your typical ""here's how we used a computer for this, here's the actors talking about their fun jobs, here's Steven Spielberg looking really, really, really Cryptkeepery old"". The packaging is exceptionally piss poor, however. The discs come in cardboard sleeves that are housed in a circular tin that you can't just slip into a spot on your shelf. It looks nice, it's just not functional. If you're not in love with the idea of dinosaur bookends or lack the overwhelming desire to maintain a complete collection (I have the previously mentioned gift set with the T-Rex statue breaking through the Park gates, so I needed this to maintain some nerd sanity), stick to the cheaper, standard options and save yourself a decent chunk of cash.

Unfortunately, where this sequel fails is in the characters.  Each one is surface deep and some depth would have caused more of an investment into their fates/adventures.

I will mainly speak on the Contents of this Edition & not the movie cause as most of us know its a fantastic film.

 The Boxing is done well & very sturdy no flimsy box/cheap packaging.

 The Statues are very sturdy & attached well to their platforms unlike other movie & Video Game statues ive purchased & have cheap plastic that breaks or comes apart from platform easily. They are separate aswell so if u have a smaller shelf you can split them to fit them where u can. There is a Certificate of Authenticity included with the statues aswell.

 The Discs are in a nice Tin Case in sleeves of their own i would have rather the sleeves be something other than paper cardboard style sleeve but thats my only complaint.

 It also comes with a Digital Copy that gives you a Copy for your iTunes account & Ultraviolet account which pleases me alot cause most movies now only include Ultraviolet copies which doesnt help those of us that are on smaller plans & don't have wifi access always.

As flawed and not good as the first movie as they are, they still had their own awesome moments that made them fun, worthwhile watches. Having said all thatJurassic World puts the previous two sequels to shame, and theres no doubt in my mind that this is the worthy sequel to the classic original that most fans had waited for. Michael Giachinnos score is magnificent, the writing is solid, the pacing is nearly perfect, the acting is great, the dinosaurs are as gorgeous as ever, the climax takes the word kickass and cranks it to 11there is just too many noteworthy things of what this movie got right.

The movie exceeded my expectations after The Lost World: Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park 3. Although those two sequels got better with the CGI than the first, as to be expected, the stories lacked in depth and character. Jurassic World brought back the awe from Jurassic Park.

What I am truly amazed at are the statues that came with the set. They are great in detail for their size, (Approximately 4""h x 2.5""w x 12"" long each without base) The are nicely weighted and solid. The sculpts are movie quality and show a lot of personality.

6696105,5,B00NYC65M8,"Let's face it: JURASSIC PARK rocked, the sequels were...meh. THE LOST WORLD was fun, and the third was essentially a waste of 90 minutes, despite Sam Neill and William H. Macy somehow being in the mix. So my expectations for JURASSIC WORLD, the continuation of a franchise that shaped my childhood to an unhealthy degree, were admittedly low.

Well, I sat in the theater for two hours...smiling and cheering. Well, internally. Is JURASSIC WORLD a ""good"" movie, per say? Nope. But then, neither was the first, really; fun, exciting, awesome--but it was never gonna win Best Picture. And neither will WORLD. But what it does is capture some of the excitement of the first--partly through a ton of throwbacks, mostly via its fun, thrilling, wryly humorous atmosphere. This is helped in large part by some incredible CGI, and Chris Pratt as the lead: a wisecracking, macho man with a vest and a rifle and a pack of raptors. Yeah, that's right: his own pack of raptors. And it actually makes sense, as much as anything in the JURASSIC universe makes sense.

The plot is largely inconsequential: a ""fake"" (get it? as opposed to ""real""?) dinosaur gets loose, wrecking havoc on a theme park. Come on; you aren't watching this for the plot. You aren't watching this for Bryce Dallas Howard to run around the entire film in heels and somehow never trip. You aren't watching this for shallow character development and improbably action scenes. You're watching this for the thrills, the laughs, the feeling of being a ten year old chugging down Diet Coke and popcorn and grinning ear-to-ear. And JURASSIC WORLD delivers this in spades.

it seems the release in the U.S does not have the same issue, should be the same package surely ? )
22 years ago 'John Raymond' had a vision of creating a Jurassic-World in which the public could interact with
Dinosaurs that had been re-created using DNA from remains of the ancient-giants found.....however, called
'Jurassic Park' it all went horribly wrong, too many mistakes were made.
On the same site they have now created the dream once envisaged, thousands of visitors are now able, in pods
to roam among the herbivores, and view many carnivores from behind a protective shield....all seems to have
one to plan.......except, the public's need to see bigger and fiercer creatures has led to a new Dinosaur being
crated, part 'T.REX' and part....you'll discover what later during the film.
Brothers 'Zach' (Nick Robinson) and 'Gray' (Ty Simpkins) are sent away on a vacation by their parents who are
having difficulties, they are to stay with their 'Aunt Claire' (Bryce Dallas Howard) who holds a key-post at 'Jurassic
World' ....the boys are about to spend a week or so around Dinosaurs....quite an adventure.
However, 'Claire' is a busy woman and at first has hired someone to watch over the brothers, who now set out on
a tour of the site, however, the Genetically-Modified Dinosaur has broken loose from the restricted compound in the
North of the site, it is soon realized that the Giant is somewhat more intelligent than that of a normal Dinosaur of it's
kind, it is also realized that because it had previously not been around other creatures or indeed humans it was killing
not only for food but for sport.
A call goes out to call all the pods back in, however boys will be boys, ''Zach' and 'Gray' ignore the call and wander into
danger.
With the help of 'Raptor' habit-researcher 'Owen' (Chris Pratt) a desperate 'Claire' goes in search of her nephews
fearing the worst.
The whole park is at risk as things spiral out of control, it's a fight for survival.
This has far-more 'bite' than those that ad gone before, it's exciting and visually-stunning, those watching will be delighted
that they decided to move forward from the Jurassic-Park series.
This is quite a watch in both 3-D and indeed pretty impressive on the Blu-ray format......you'll have to make sure yu are not
bitten if watching in 3-D......",1445126400,,2426,4.834134615384615

The dialogue, the plot, the typical romance injection, the typical characters you would find in these films, and the high-octane special-effects packed action sequences just create this overly-formulaic film.

On one hand, I get why people may like this movie, but for those expecting and wanting more out of the movie then you will be disappointed.",1445040000,2,526,4.910112359550562

This movie reminded me of those, but with somewhat better acting and slightly higher CG budget. The plot line of ""using dinosaurs in war"" was laughable and it was hard to connect with any of the human characters. I found myself more concerned with the obviously faux dinosaurs than the people trying to escape the park.

Sorry, but I am a huge Jurassic Park fan and I find it amazing that a movie made with 20-year-old technology to be more life-like than this movie made today. I'll probably watch this movie to provide background noise while I work from home, but this will never be held in high esteem like the original.",1444953600,10,746,4.643939393939394

6696194,1,B00NYC65M8,"First up: if you've seen the first movie in this franchise, then you've seen this one.
There is not a scrap of originality, freshness or anything different at all in this ponderous, over-CGI-ed tedious self-indulgence.
You always know where it's going, ...and it doesn't even excite you as it follows the well worn path to tedium, .....with brief stops at ennui and predictability.
The story?
Bright shiny happy people go to ""Disneyland"" , then the exhibits get loose and kill people, but only the ugly ones of course.
The casting here has all the main characters played by quite attractive actors, and the disposable ""dino-fodder"" played by far less attractive or even fat ones. (One guy who has ""raptor-lunch"" written all over him wears the most obvious ""fat-suit"" false gut you'll ever see; ...and he's given a very tight shirt to make it even more plain!)
This dubious method of casting makes it all too easy for the audience, or at least those with even the slightest intelligence to predict which ones will survive and which will not.

So here we have two rich (and supremely snotty) little brothers, sent off to visit the latest dinosaur park, ....didn't anyone learn anything from the three(?) previous versions?
Of course they have an aunt there who manages the place, so of course it's VIP passes for them. None of that hours of queuing for these two precious little twinks.
The aunt is a smug, dressed in all white, uptight, terrified she's out of her depth control freak that even I wanted to kill in the first three minutes. Yes, she's THAT annoying!
(Do watch her wig. It's dead straight for the first half, then for some inexplicable reason she gets a curly one for the second half of the movie.
And she manages high heels while being chased through the jungle, never missing a step!)

I hoped like hell she'd end up as a T-Rex T-bone really soon, but no, as I mentioned above, all the ""beautiful"" people here carry some special immunity from being eaten by any of the genetically ramped-up dinosaurs.
Naturally there is also the token Afro-American too. He's given a few inconsequential lines but nothing really to DO. He's not there to actually ""do"" anything, only to satisfy the racial quotient you understand? Of course he survives! You needed to ask?
It's the Muslim looking bloke who gets it in a helicopter crash, ......courtesy of a close encounter with a swarm of released pterodactyls!

Now I happen to love fantasy movies, but this one I loathed right from about the three minute mark, and it just never did anything to restore my interest or appreciation.
Everybody is just SO stupid, (and unlikeable) it's beyond belief. They constantly do the dumbest things....all with THE most predictable results.
I haven't seen a collection of dumber people making more idiotic decisions since the crew of that spaceship in ""Prometheus""!

Of course we have the handsome ""Indiana Jones"" character who is, ....wait for it, yes a velociraptor ""trainer"", ...and yes, you read that correctly.
He has FOUR of them. Count them. They have FOUR names, ... which we are told.
Later in the story in another dumb decision and for reasons I will not go into here, the FOUR are released from grey-hound type starting boxes!
We see the FOUR race off, accompanied by ""Indiana"" riding a motorcycle.....amazingly free from any bumps and vibrations considering he's riding through rough jungle.
Frankly I was surprised at this stage that he wasn't riding on the back of one of the velociraptors!

Now of course mayhem ensues, and in a very prolonged battle we see at least seven, (maybe more?) of the raptors killed...and I do mean DEAD.
However despite that, come the final showdown there are STILL at least three of the damned beasts left!
Obviously the CGI wizards couldn't resist showing the various messy ways in which the raptors could be disposed of, and either lost count of how many they'd did in, or assumed the audience was too dumb to realise they'd killed far more than they ever released.
(I was somewhat reminded of those old westerns, where the SIX-shooters seemed to hold an inexhaustible supply of bullets and the cowboys could just bang away for ever.)
This is strictly movie making by number folks......and even the numbers are all borrowed from what's gone before.
I was surprised that anyone would be so bold as to have their names credited as being ""writers"" for this completely plagiarised, re-heated heap of T-Rex coprolite!
Proves just one thing.
You can take a s--tload of money and throw it at CGI, hire a few marginally capable actors, ride in on the coat tails of what was at least an original movie, have a fascinating subject like dinosaurs that have almost universal appeal, ....and yet STILL turn out one of the worst pieces of boring, unexciting crap imaginable. It's not even ""scary"" if that's what you're looking for, and the actors are all so unlikeable that you just want them all to die....and SOON!
Unless you have the mind of an eight year old kid, this movie will totally bore the bee-jeezus out of you!",1444867200,11,5043,4.798619102416571

Original was novelty and - don't get me wrong - extremely well done (I loved Richard Attenborough). but the plot in this was better thought out than - ooh there are dinosaurs and oh shoot they are going to eat us. This one had realistic views on dinosaurs - they are critters, not walking decoration but if they become dangerous then blow them out of existence: sensible stewardship . Also continued with the Ian Malcolm idea of - just because you can does not necessarily mean you should (Frankenstein theme). The bad guys were more three dimensional in that they had some good arguing points though they were ultimately proven wrong. Even the small parts like the owner who took over for Hammond - were well fleshed out in just a few scenes. Anyway - and it's in the trailer so I'm not giving anything away - any movie that can have a credible scene with a guy on a motorcycle hunting with raptors has got my vote!!!!!!!!!!",1444867200,,988,4.5251396648044695

The child actors were annoying and most scenes with them were the worst. Nothing like the child actors in the 1st film. The main actress was attractive but really a unlikeable character. ( The scene where she goes to get the T-Rex to save them all from the Hybrid Rex was so lame I almost turned it off) Although the fight between them was pretty cool. The scenes with the dinosaurs were all very good and exciting. It had potential for sure. But, I was disappointed with the network TV type writing, acting, and plot. In my opinion the worst of the four films.",1444867200,3,798,4.580419580419581

6696371,3,B00NYC65M8,With all the Hype I must say I was expecting a little more from this movie.  It was good but certainly has the feeling of the studios capitalizing on a successful movie franchise without taking the extra effort to make this as good as the first movie 20 years ago.  Chris Pratt was great in his role but overall the moview was lacking a little substance in my opinion.,1444694400,2,368,4.318840579710145
6696372,4,B00NYC65M8,"I really did enjoy this movie. It was a lot of fun to watch but it's amazing that Claire, with all the running, jumping and hardships she faced in the story never even considered ditching her stiletto heels! She shows us that if you are going to face danger, it's best to face it in fashion. I only mention this because I think the majority of women would have made ditching the shoes priority number one, especially if you are running for your life. Anyway, I thought it was a decent story and great fun.",1444694400,,505,4.326315789473684
6696373,5,B00NYC65M8,"I watched this movie in the theaters and enjoyed it. To be honest there were some things that I didn't like about this movie. When they first introduced the sea dinosaur I quite literally thought to myself that somehow it was going to be the ""savior"" of the movie based on how the other movies went. I just rewatched the movie and felt like it was even better than it was when I first saw it... Afterwards I went and read a lot of reviews, especially the one star reviews... And I have a lot of things that I want to comment on them... yes, some scenes how super awesome amazing cgi that suddenly transitioned into bad cgi scenes in the blink of an eye. Well even the best well funded movies and tv shows have this issue, so get over that... Then there is the obvious hate on the whole training the raptors thing, well what they forget is that humans are nothing more than instinct driven animals that quite literally can be trained by their own pets. So you can totally train a raptor to follow orders. Then the next most common complaint was that the raptors turned on the humans... Hello, raptors are just as if not more intelligent than humans, so when the really giant dinosaur that speaks their language appears, your probably going to listen to your instincts who would be saying that you turn on the humans or your going to die. There is also the simple fact raptors are the most socially advanced creatures we know of to ever walk the planet, surpassing even humans... I honestly think the only scene that is even clich at all is the whole bit with the t rex, they already used that scene In the third movie where the spineosourus out manuvers the t rex and breaks its neck... Mr. Indominus rex gets ahold of the t rex and its the whole scene again only the clearly far more intelligent dinosaur doesn't kill the t rex, makes a rookie mistake, tries taking on a half dead t rex and a half dead raptor and loses by the means of a water creature that is clearly the most dangerous thing in the park. That is the only bad thing I can say about this movie as the rest is solid with the way humans actually do behave... What this movie portrays is one of the darker sides of human nature... In fact I love these movies because the idea of resurrecting these animals for profit and entertainment is very much a real idea that is being investigated by companies around the world. now, lets get back to the movie... Excellent cgi, a decent storyline, fairly accurate human portrayal, probably accurate dinosaur portrayal?, the obvious clich man and woman fall in love through tragic events, and of course The best stars any movie can ever have (Dinosaurs) make this a great film for those who can appreciate it.",1444694400,7,2712,4.426
6696374,2,B00NYC65M8,"Worst Jurassic Park movie yet. Copycat of JP1. Acting was horrible. What a waste of $19.99. Who runs through the jungle all day in high heels? And who thinks they can talk to the dinosaurs and train them as pets? Ok, in all fairness...I have seen worse. That's why I gave it 2 stars. Plus, the CG was believable. The dinosaurs acted better than the actors.",1444608000,4,356,4.409090909090909
6696375,5,B00NYC65M8,"So i thought it would be as boring and uninspired as the 2nd and 3rd movie. Thought because of other reviews that there would be too much human romance and drama. It is here.. again, BUT in small quantities. Just enough good action and changes from other movies that make it all interesting. Well-done mix. Things don't seem out of place.",1444608000,,338,4.557377049180328
6696376,4,B00NYC65M8,"Overall, I liked the movie; however there were inconsistencies.  Some things present in the movie did not make sense.  A few superficial scratches on a 12 to 13 ton dinosaur will not kill the animal.  And pre-historic birds did not swoop down and pick up to eat persons!!",1444608000,,271,4.604166666666667

It was entertaining and had good action, the special effects were pretty good (same company that did the original).  In a lot of these movies, the CGI can be overdone, but it didn't seem too bad here.  As a true fan of the original, parts of the movie harkened back to the first Jurassic Park.

There are a few places where people are graphically eaten, but mostly it's the visions of blood spatter that are alluding to the demise of a character.  If you liked the first three, you will like this one.  If you only liked the first one and tired on the sequels, then you might be happier with another video.",1444608000,,471,4.306818181818182

Really? Then the dinosaurs and Chris Pratt basically give each other a tough guy head nod at the end. It would have been just as believable for the mutant dinosaur to be killed by a Sharknado. Awful, just awful.",1444521600,11,586,4.288288288288288

6696408,2,B00NYC65M8,"The film fast forwards to a point where the public seems to have forgotten about the catastrophic events surrounding the first three parks and the T-Rex stomping around San Diego, and looks like a mixture of Sea World meets Islands of Adventures on steroids. The Heartless Park Manager (HPM) believes visitors need ever bigger and badder dinosaurs to keep returning (oh, the irony) so has created some giant super dinosaur that's a composite of the terrifying features of the others. Naturally, park security wasn't high on the priority list that the HPM was working from and chaos ensues.

As soon as the new dinosaurs escapes from the enclosure - and you won't believe how that happens - a variety of lazily written plot mechanisms kick into place. The new Benevolent Park Owner decides to fly his own helicopter, dangerously, for no apparently reason and that doesn't end well. Our hero, Chris Pratt, believes he can talk to the Raptors while Vincent d'Onofrio as the Evil Corporate-Slash-Military Rep tries to weaponize them. Everyone with the gun has forgotten both basic training and common sense and it becomes a massacre caused by egregious stupidity more than a poorly designed dinosaur zoo. Once we get dumped into Act 3, it quickly draws on horror sequel devices with dinosaurs fighting each other and the human either becoming food or learning not to mess with nature.

The main problem with Jurassic World isn't the illogical plotting, inconsistencies with the first film, unlikable characters or lack of originality, so much that it just isn't really very entertaining. The most scary element of the movie was the half-billion box office haul, meaning we'll have to suffer through many more sequels. Compared with the original, JW replaces tension and implied terror with mediocre CG and dino-fodder characters that limp from action sequence to action sequence. I never thought I would say this about a Jurassic Park movie but frankly I was bored.",1444521600,10,1961,5.049382716049383

6696453,1,B00NYC65M8,"Actually, this film is beyond disappointing.

Unlike the previous films in the series, this was not about people who fell victim to their fascination with dinosaurs and faced the consequences. This movie was about people who are selfish and stupid, who make stupid choices from beginning to end. After a while I felt like I was looking at the work of people whose entire message is that our species is dumber than dinosaurs.

I can't believe this is remotely how we would behave when faced with real dinosaurs. I remember the scene in the first film when the paleontologists see the brachiosaurus for the first time. That was a powerful scene and we all understood it. This movie shows our selfish need to create bigger, badder, meaner, more wicked dinosaurs for fun and profit, or turn them all into a pack of trained Dobermans who see us as the Alpha. Every dinosaur in the film was made to perform like a trained dolphin at Sea world, or a trained elephant in a circus. Even the hero guy in the movie was guilty of this. It showed the worst of us in the way we deal with nature.

Scenes I would rather forget include the field of slain brachiosaurs and the pteradons attacking the little Shetland pony style ride- on dinosaurs.

The entire movie made me feel like I was wearing a t-shirt that read, ""I'm with stupid."" Or maybe, because I paid twenty dollars for this movie, I should be wearing the other shirt.

I know we live in a time where big hit movies are nothing but a whole series of fights, fights causing disastrous crashes, fights causing disastrous crashes and toppling buildings, but I'm amazed that this movie, which has no heroes, only survivors, succeeded at all.

I wish I could go back in time and tell myself not to watch it. It's that bad.",1444262400,8,1762,4.542586750788644

6696456,2,B00NYC65M8,"I was disappointed but then again, it's what was expected; same story, just different packaging.  Everyone's excited, then the dinosaurs get out, and then start killing the tourists. The acting was weak, story lines more than obvious, and some sub plots (using Raptors as weapons) were simply stupid. The original was great because the concept was something different.  Now with better technology, film makers think they have to do it all again.  I wish Hollywood would get off these reboots and remake trains and come up with new ideas that would have the same impact as the original Jurassic Park.",1444262400,,599,4.97

Dallas Bryce Howard is perfect as the ""suit"" who has to deal with Pratt, who would rather not. He plays the Dino behaviorist whose friends on the island include the pack of four velaciraptors. He is asked to evaluate the latest hybrid: a nasty tempered mega Dino who can disappear. Great. Not a good thing on a tiny island filled with tourists. Alot of good action. For teens and above.

This movie is BEYOND amazing, I wasn't disappointed by it for not even one second. From the T-Rex dinosaur battle (T-Rex is KING) to just how truly clever and smart this dinosaur was. I think that this was a great way to expand the Jurassic Park franchise and leaving viewers itching for more.

The plot was perfect creating a new bigger and better dinosaur was genius. Introducing the world to new dinosaur such as the dinosaur that looked like a whale but making it relate-able like Shamu at sea world. This leaves me wanting more.

In the first series of Jurassic movies I had that sense of awe when you first saw the dinosaurs walking freely and saw the panoramic view of the whole beautiful park. I did not have that same sense with this movie. It seemed to have somehow removed that majestic feeling.  It did have great effects and great chase and fighting scenes. A few times I was feeling anxious for the characters. All in all a good movie just not a fantastic movie. All in my opinion of course. I just expected a bit more.,1444176000,,578,4.254545454545455

I didn't much care for the others that came after, but Jurassic World was fantastic! I know some people don't like it, saying it was ridiculous or over the top. I, however, think that dinosaurs are over the top anyway, so who cares? I was entertained the whole time. I love special effects and crazy action scenes. Also, I obviously love Chris Pratt. He's gorgeous and hilarious. I liked the throwback scenes to the original movie as well. I'd recommend this movie to most, but I know some will still complain about it somehow.",1444176000,,641,4.582608695652174

the kids did nothing to progress the story.

worse Aunt ever - it's like she's literally never been around a child.

Despite all the unnecessary tangents, weak dialogue, and poor story structure, It was nice to see the dinos again, especially dinos with a higher body count than previous movies.

6696728,2,B00NYC65M8,"I have to confess, I'm not that big a fan of the original Jurassic Park. The concept was clever, and the effects were ahead of their time, but in the end it basically just felt like watching a couple with no chemistry and two annoying kids getting chased around by dinosaurs for two hours.

But apparently the formula worked, so if that's your thing, you can now watch a couple with no chemistry and two annoying kids getting chased around by dinosaurs for two hours...again.

Presenting Jurassic World, starring Some Kid and Some Other Kid as Potential Dinosaur Snacks #1 and #2, Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire ""The 90's Called, They Want Their Poorly-Written Strong Female Characters Back"" Dearing, and Chris Pratt as Himself. Or Star-Lord. Take your pick.

I'm normally fairly lenient toward films that sacrifice depth or character development for spectacle, so long as they still turn out to be fun in the end. But Jurassic World's flaws are ultimately too glaring to ignore, and definitely don't leave the viewer with much reason to watch it more than once. It's a spectacle, but little more than that. Viewed with a critical eye, it feels disjointed and awkward. For example, the death of one minor character attracted much attention in film-making circles due to its ""unearned"" length and severity. Perhaps we were given more reason to hate, or care about, this person in an earlier draft of the film? Who knows? Plus, we are yet again assaulted by stereotypical child characters - the Hormone-Drenched Teen and the Genius Little Brother - who give us no reason to actually care about them beyond the brief implication that their parents might be getting a divorce. Any subplot of brotherly bonding between them is quickly stomped into the dirt by the giant foot of a genetically-modified hybrid dinosaur, this film's Big Bad. As for the adult characters...well, while I'm usually the polar opposite of a political-correctness Nazi, even I have to admit that Howard's Claire was badly handled with regard to her gender. Chris Pratt's Owen was perhaps the most interesting character in the film, in theory, but so little time was devoted to fleshing him out that he still wound up feeling like a clone of Star-Lord.

I suppose, in the end, Jurassic World lives up to the legacy of Jurassic Park. It gives us action, excitement, eye-popping visuals, a touch of humor (if dark at times), and that sense of childlike wonder we all used to get from the very thought of seeing a dinosaur in the flesh. But it's a shame that this final quality is in such short supply, overwhelmed by high-octane chases and people-munching peril. Frankly, I think that by now we've established all the various ways that a dinosaur theme park can go horribly wrong. It might be fun to see it go right for a change. Then we could get more than a quick glimpse of the dinos as they rush off to either eat or be eaten. It feels like the longest shot in Jurassic World of a single dinosaur holding still is when a peaceful plant-eater, felled by a vicious predator attack, slowly dies.

Kind of a shame, really.",1444003200,2,3088,4.753731343283582
6696729,1,B00NYC65M8,"Unfortunately bad.  This film had pointless characters and no charm.  Half way through I wanted to turn it off but having paid $20, I watched it through.  How is it even possible that the CGI is worse in this film than in the original?",1444003200,6,235,4.295454545454546
6696730,5,B00NYC65M8,"When I was nine years old I watched with a child's awe the stuff of my childhood fantasies come to life with the first Jurassic Park. Back then there was minimal computer graphics and they had built actual props of the T-Rex for the movie. When it came out it was released on VHS. I had asked my parents to buy me the film for my birthday. I must have watched it a thousand times. I look at my movie collection today and I can still see the old VHS there, in the original box I opened way back when. The T-Rex was the king of the land, and for the next twenty years, the image of Spielberg's creation at the end of the first film ran away into my imagination. Today was like walking into the theatre for the first time. I, now an adult, have seen a movie that  still fills me with the same memories and since of amazement as the first one, all those years ago. the subtle nuances scattered throughout the movie: the escape of the Indominus Rex mirrors that of the T-Rex in the first movie, and the whole of the film has cues and hints from the first one. I must admit, seeing a 1992 jeep run from a t-Rex in 1992 was amazing, seeing a 20 year old jeep still going, well that just makes me smile.
Its hard to believe its been 20 years since the first movie and its nice to see that the old T-Rex is still the king. It was my favorite dinosaur then, and it still is. Its nice to see that life, has found a way. There are few films that have the power to bring back those memories, fewer still that do that with powerful and faithful renderings of the classic that they have come to embody. Jurassic World comes full circle. It may be a new film but it retains the soul of the first Jurassic Park, the characters are different, the park is built up, and there are new dinosaurs but its still Jurassic Park and in many ways, I get the same feeling of exhilaration as I did when I was a boy.

whether or not you have seen the first one, I would highly recommend this film. in many ways it brings a exciting new twist to the whole ""you shouldn't play with nature"" theme. excellent movie. very highly recommended.",1443916800,4,2106,4.146699266503667
6696731,3,B00NYC65M8,"I wish I could give this a better rating, but I just can't.  It was more like a family movie, but with blood (not a whole lot) and didn't leave you with that feel good ending--more like, yeah okay.  The story line--as with most sequels--was weak.  I've read dozens of great stories online, they aren't that hard to find.  I'm not sure what the problem is in Hollywood, but they really need to expand their horizons and stop hitting the replay button.

The acting was okay, but it felt really forced, very little attachment to the characters ... except maybe the dinosaurs.  I really don't think I'd hold it against the actors though, to me it just just seemed like a poorly done script, but that's just my opinion.

Far too many camera shots with the lead male character looking overly macho and tough standing square in the camera frame, it just got ridiculous and annoying--like, a throw back to super heroes or something, but he wasn't wearing a cape.

Anyhow, my 2 cents.",1443916800,27,975,4.563218390804598

2) raptors listening to humans is unbelievable

6696747,4,B00NYC65M8,"""Jurassic World"" is a review-proof movie. No matter what any review says, the movie will make money.

So, it's a relief to say that the film is actually pretty good. A worthy companion to the original classic.

The two most notable things about ""World"" are the director and lead. Colin Treverrow, a San Francisco native, directed his first feature film ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" for $750,000. Someone, somewhere apparently liked that film. Liked it a lot. Because his follow-up is ""World"", with a reported budget of $150,000,000. I haven't seen ""Safety Not Guaranteed"", many haven't, but how does someone make a jump like this? It is virtually unheard of. What is even more miraculous is that Treverrow handles the leadership of this monumental colossus well and gives it the respect it deserves while injecting some fresh and exciting bits. It is a good mix which is making the film appeal to even more people than expected.

Treverrow clearly knows how to handle the conventions of a monster epic.... Read more",1443744000,,1010,4.964497041420119

Enjoyed the action just as much on the small screen as at the theater.  However, the HD digital edition that I purchased from Amazon has about 20 seconds of difference between when the captions appear and when the dialogue is spoken.  Since my husband and I are both hearing-impaired, we depend on the captions a lot.  Because of the 20 seconds advance on the captions, we had to wait to see the spoken word occur.  This made it difficult to enjoy the movie and we actually turned off the captions and missed a lot of the spoken dialogue.  A little disappointing for a $20 investment.

A little flawed with some of the character development--and the story itself is really nothing new (same story on a bigger scale), but it was entertaining. A great escape. The Jurassic franchise has a pedigree that endures nostalgia and excitement for the future of it. You get that here.

I do miss the robots of the original films. The CG was nice in this one, but the tech behind the old robots warranted a greater appreciation for what they accomplished in the end (visually).

6696787,4,B00NYC65M8,"Gone is the mystic fascination of the first movie with these ancient resurrected creatures of nature... by Jurassic World the ""dinos"" are basically relegated to familiar old hat circus attractions- so much so that when they actively aren't trying to eat the main characters, they barely merit their passing attention.
The usual Jurassic Park movie rules apply:  Plant eaters are GOOD, almost cuddly creatures something like walking stuffed animal toys.  Never mind the obvious fact that bison for instance are far and above the most dangerous animals you could ever encounter at Yellowstone, and likewise a cranky Triceratops would quite probably charge trample and gore you to death on sight.  Would you walk up and pet a wild rhino?  You've got to be kidding.  An irked giraffe could easily break your back with a flick of its hind leg and lord knows what a 35 ton Apatosaurus might do if you came between it and its youngster.  That is if it didn't just step on you by accident.
Meat eaters as usual are bad, and we mean BAD- basically hell bent on harassing, wickedly sniffing, attacking chasing and killing with unending enthusiasm.  [spoiler alert] This is taken to almost comical levels with for instance the flying reptiles, which immediately upon release from their holding pens appear to want nothing more than to make a beeline directly toward humans- only humans- with the single obsession to kill, kill, kill with every last dying flap and breath.
What in the world made these creatures so angry?  Who knows.

The raptors of course must make their reappearance but by Movie IV their hunting prowess has been exaggerated to the point that they are no less than perfect killing machines- this is hilariously demonstrated by 'Hannibal Lecter' type hydraulic headgear into which they are placed for safekeeping, until say a button is pressed deploying them something like guided missles.  The Indominus Rex killdozer is somewhat more believable given the fact that it was as explained deliberately engineered as a killing machine (for entertaining tourists?)- again, never mind that in the book Dr. Wu chief geneticist was the one who explicitly wanted to breed tamer dinosaurs.
Nevertheless we are forced to dismiss any kind of logical conclusions as to how 4 raptors face an entire island full of occupants- many of them armed with machine guns- bombs, explosions, moving vehicles, not to mention attacks by Indominus himself- and still manage to be everywhere and I mean everywhere, full of boundless energy and killthusiasm and simply unkillable themselves.
I mean seriously, you're going to tell me one single machine gun couldn't mow all four of these critters down in 10 seconds?  Or at least wound one of them?  One??  Eh well.

There is some decent acting- Chris Pratt plays his role very well, and Vincent D'Onofrio coudn't have been better casted, he seems as natural for the part as if it was himself.  Irrfan Khan as billionaire park owner plays his own role as a new character we don't even know what to expect from, so how can he fail?  Bryce Dallas Howard does pretty good as Claire, though she seems a bit young to have risen to such a lofty position as manager of the entire park.  Not to mention her amazing ability to keep up appearances given being relentlessly chased by man eating death machines through mud, but hey.

I watched it twice, so I have to say it has entertainment value.  As for accuracy or believability, scores are pretty low, though it gets points for pushing this so far it becomes fun to watch almost as a parody of itself.  But this is Hollywood so what do you expect, right?",1441929600,11,3626,4.846029173419773
6696788,1,B00NYC65M8,"How does this movie have such a high rating? Have people lost their minds or have we just been polluted with bad movies for so long that we can't tell the difference?

What's good:
The scenery is incredible, the technology is interesting, and how they came to finally resurrect building the park after the disasters is engaging enough. Simply put, at the outset, it is a good LOOKING movie, but that's where it ends.

What's bad:
Pretty much everything else. The human/raptor team up is absurd, the dinosaurs themselves look fake. The characters are cartoony archetypes of real characters, and the story itself is beyond stupidity.
For one, the story of everyone eventually getting bored with dinosaurs to the point where the zoo has to begin genetic manipulation is absolutely ridiculous. Do modern Zoos have to do this to attract crowds? Not in my area. I'm also pretty certain that much of what they're doing is in direct violation of the Geneva Conventions which would be pretty difficult to hide.
Dr. Henry Wu's (B.D. Wong's) character assassination, turning him into a behind the curtain villain is absolutely laughable, especially to those of us who READ THE BOOK and know how he died during the first Jurassic Park. To then have him become an unscrupulous quack is just really insulting to the intelligence of the audience. Since they didn't put his death on screen, it would have been better to let him fade into obscurity.
How the indominous rex broke free strains credulity to the point of fracture as the park staff were shown to be incredibly incompetent.
The whole subplot about raptors respecting Pratt is also insane. They may be smart animals, but they are still animals. Look at dolphins, they are super smart as well, but still heavily rely on instincts and have been known to get violent with humans.
How do they escape these problems? By saying that the dinosaurs are genetically enhanced and look NOTHING like what actual dinosaurs would have...
WHAT!?!?!?!?
This is supposed to be a survival movie involving dinosaurs! You've taken an awesome premise from the first movie and essentially turned it into a freak show! I personally went to the theater to see the dinosaurs, so to hear that really bothered me.
Finally the comical insanity of the movie can be summed up by the T-REX chase at the end. Fleeing a T-Rex with heels on... not running the MOMENT it made an appearance? In the first movie, that woman would have been the Rex's meal.

Settling for JURASSIC WORLD is like wanting to watch JAWS and ending up with SHARKNADO; sure, I guess there's some kind of charm to the so-bad-it's-bad filmmaking, the lazy storytelling, and the schlocky effects, particularly when you're with children who don't know any better or drinking with friends, but it's still ultimately unsatisfying as anything other than a cheap laugh.",1441929600,4,680,4.82051282051282

What can I say; I was a typical geek boy. I also loved Michael Crichton who wrote the book Jurassic Park and I consider his books to be among the best Sci-Fi I have read. I also loved the original film so I just had to see this one.

I found the film to be entertaining and full of action and the acting was solid and the CGI was perfectly done. The film animation of the dinosaurs was amazing.

6696793,5,B00NYC65M8,"I'm so glad that, finally, someone has been brave enough to produce a documentary on the disaster that took place at Isla Nublar. The work begun by John Hammond has obviously not been tested safely, and this film shows that fact. DON'T LET THE TALKING HEADS ON TV TELL YOU OTHERWISE. The mainstream media tried to suppress this important film and I am just grateful we are now allowed to see the tragedy that ensues when man tries to play God. Along the lines of one of my other favorite documentaries, Titanic (RIP Jack, I wouldn't have let you go), this film is substantially important for the world.

Several lingering issues are highlighted by the end of this documentary. First, Dr. Wu must be brought to trial, preferably before the United Nations, for his crimes against humanity. Dr. Wu knew full well what he was doing, yet did it for his own selfish reasons. Second, the American government MUST intercede and protect the Mitchell boys. There is currently a petition circulating to have the Division of Child Services step in and take these children away from their very dangerous circumstances, as their parents knowingly shipped them to a cruel, uncaring, wanton aunt working at an experimental center masquerading as a theme park (she pawned off nephews she hadn't seen in years to an incompetent assistant, FYI). Lastly, all these creatures that were created were abandoned on an island. I don't see a commercial overlaid with a sad Sarah McLaughlin song when I'm watching repeats of the Beverly Hillbillies crying for these animals to be taken care of. Where is the ASPCA when you need them? Dinosaurs are humans, too!

I highly recommend this documentary to anyone looking to be informed and updated on the REAL circumstances surrounding the tragic day when we had to learn our lesson to not play God. Don't listen to the pundits on Fox News or CNN, this is what really happened and you deserve to be informed. By buying this video, you will be joining the prayer avalanche for those poor souls lost through the manipulations of the evil John Hammond and Dr. Wu.",1441497600,6,2078,4.7855153203342615

6696795,5,B00NYC65M8,"Amazing summer blockbuster! Jurassic Park has been replaced by Jurassic World, owned by the Masrani Corporation. The corporation believes that in order to keep public interest, it must not only recreate the past, but also innovate. Therefore, its lab (lead by Dr. Wu from InGen) creates a hybrid dinosaur, the Indominus Rex, which is kept alone in a high-security pen after showing early signs of being a killing machine. Later in the movie, the audience learns the corporation has another motive for creating such a dinosaur (I'm not going to spoil it!)
As the safety precautions surrounding the new dino are being tested, Claire, the busy park operations manager, is visited at Jurassic World by her two nephews. Chaos ensues when the new dino learns how to trick her captors and escape her pen just as the two nephews decide to go off-roading from an exhibit.

So, it's a relief to say that the film is actually pretty good. A worthy companion to the original classic.

The two most notable things about ""World"" are the director and lead. Colin Treverrow, a San Francisco native, directed his first feature film ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" for $750,000. Someone, somewhere apparently liked that film. Liked it a lot. Because his follow-up is ""World"", with a reported budget of $150,000,000. I haven't seen ""Safety Not Guaranteed"", many haven't, but how does someone make a jump like this? It is virtually unheard of. What is even more miraculous is that Treverrow handles the leadership of this monumental colossus well and gives it the respect it deserves while injecting some fresh and exciting bits. It is a good mix which is making the film appeal to even more people than expected.

Treverrow clearly knows how to handle the conventions of a monster epic.... Read more",1441324800,2,1010,4.964497041420119
6696798,3,B00NYC65M8,"After just seeing Jurassic World in the Theater I found the film good but not great.  I still think the first film is the best one in the series followed by Jurassic World, JP3 and finally The Lost World.  Jurassic World had a lot of hype and publicity going for it.

When I saw the opening teaser preview I thought well this movie looks promising.  Watching the Great White dangling over the water I instantly thought of Steven Spielberg it was a dead giveaway.  I liked the idea of having the dinosaur park open and successful, sprawling with tourists part Disney Land/Sea World with real dinosaurs instead of animatronics.  But as more and more previews came out they practically showed the best parts of the movie in the previews giving way too much away. All the studio had to do was just flash the logo and people would come out in droves to see it, the franchise practically sells itself, no need to give away the whole movie.

The film gets off to a good start the park looks like it is doing great with lots of people everywhere ""merchandising"" ""merchandising"" like Mel Brooks would say.  the atmosphere and views of the park look stunning.  The director wanted to make the audience believe the staff has learned its lesson from the mistakes at the previous park and we buy it.

The park staff put tracking devices on each dinosaur and used security teams to subdue any wayward dino's.  Simple things like flares used to feed the T-rex seemed smart.  The teenage staffer who seemed bored to death at the controls of the herbivore dinosaur pod ride seemed very realistic.  The operators in the control room seem a little clichd but you end up liking the guy with glasses enthusiasm for his job in the park down to the toy dinosaurs at his desk.  To him it was probably the best job in the world.

The film was a little unclear how the dinosaur beacon for the Indominus Rex was out of the pen and then suddenly back in before making his escape. I found that kind of confusing.  You would think the island would have a fleet of helicopters and pilots to see all the dinosaurs from above and in the air. Kind of silly to think the billionaire owner is the only one who can fly the only helicopter on the island. Especially for a park trying to make more money.  And why is boat travel the only way off the island you can't tell me they could not put a small landing strip somewhere to get small aircraft on and off the island.

The lead actor Chris Pratt does a good job.  I thought Bryce Dallas Howard overacted quite a bit.  No way in hell would she keep those high heeled shoes of hers on if a dinosaur was chasing her.  She would either ditch the shoes and go barefoot or put on a pair of tennis shoes once she reached safety.  Just a small detail but the moviegoers I went with also mentioned it in several scenes. Case in point when she ignites the flare to lure the T-rex udderly ridiculous running in those dress shoes.

We never get to see the cruise ship or ferry boat taking tourists off the island.  With massive dinosaurs on the loose I am surprised not to see more casualties near the harbor.  There would have been panic, fist fights and mass hysteria by the human travelers to get off the island.  The Indomenus Rex would have been drawn to all the screaming crowds and noise from the people or the Raptors for that matter.

You could easily guess which characters would be eaten and not survive the movie.  The brothers in the film seem mildly interesting and made smart decisions for the most part.  At least they were not screaming at everything or holding on to 20,000 volt electrical fence wires like in the first film (C'mon that kid's brain would have been fried chicken).

I am not going to give the whole movie away I am sure hundreds of other people will summarize the movie better than I can.  it seems to me that they spent way too much time on the Raptor dinosaurs.  JP3 covered the raptors in great detail, it just seems like overkill on that single species.  With so many different dinosaur species they could have come up with another type of predator that would have been just as interesting like the Allosaurus or Giganotosaurus for instance.

Jurassic World succeeds in being the best sequel so far.  I felt both prior sequels were inferior to the first movie.  I hated ""The Lost World"" I nearly walked out of the theater when the girl doing the high bar routine did not get eaten with the raptor below her, and was disappointed in ""JP3"" which had an abrupt ending with marines with M-16's landing on the beach.  Like those little guns were going to do anything to those big dinosaurs duh. Also it is hard to believe that Laura Dern's character had that much clout to call in a military unit half way around the world in just a few short hours I'll call BS on that one.

I would rate Jurrassic World 3 stars it has some good moments but could have used some new species of dino's and less running in high heels.  Not enough tourist were eaten as well.  I was hoping to see T-Rex run down Main street Disney there and munch away. or see a herd of herbivores rampage through the guest hotel with a predator dinosaur chasing them like in The Lion King.  There was lots of things they could have done.",1441238400,2,5237,4.413541666666666

I agree with another comment I read about the parents divorce. Unnecessary. Another comment said something about the raptors following orders was too unbelievable (basically). Apparently they missed the part where it was explained that they imprinted at birth, & he was their Alpha. It's quite plausible.

(shakes head).

Ok ignoring that as well ... The titanic had better evacuation procedures then an island full of dinosaurs that is being used as a theme park. Could they not find someone that worked at a zoo to consult with about different evacuation procedures? Anyone that worked at a zoo (Catering staff, Ticket takers, ANYONE) could have told them that their policies and procedures were lacking. or how much access people should have with the animals?

It's a fourth helping of the same meal.  It's not a huge disappointment, but it IS rather unremarkable.

The original ""Jurassic Park"" in 1993 hit all the right notes.  The sequels, however, had little new to offer.  Had ""Jurassic World"" followed closely on the heels of ""Jurassic Park III"" I think ""World"" would have been largely ignored and dismissed as ""just another tired sequel"" that strained to be relevant.

Yes, the dinosaurs were great and the t-rex and velociraptor sequences are exceptional, but most of the rest of the movie was average at best, even forgettable, although Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum and Ariana Richards were effective.

The second film (1997) and the third film (2001) were serviceable, but forgettable and somehow a letdown, which brings us to this fourth film in the series, a whopping fourteen years after the previous sequel. So how does it stack up?

While Jurassic World is better than the two previous movies its not as good as the first one. In fact, the plots pretty much a retread with marginal changes. The big difference here is that its 22 years later and the original Park is now a Disneyworld-like tourist attraction called Jurassic World owned by Masrani (Irrfan Khan) and ran by an all-business woman named Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard). Chris Pratt plays the male protagonist, Vincent D'Onofrio the bad guy, Omar Sy the token black dude and BD Wong the token Asian scientist. Katie McGrath is on hand as the boys hired quasi-nanny at the park, Zara, but shes not fleshed-out as a character; flesh-eaten maybe, but not fleshed out.

Actually, thats the main problem with this movie. The characters have little depth, although Bryce shines as the preoccupied-with-work Aunt and Pratt has the gravitas for his role. Unfortunately, the two kids (brothers) are decidedly dull. My wife thought so as well, so its not just me. The writers shouldve worked-in the older brothers girlfriend to spice things up or, at least, some other girl at the park.

Nevertheless, there are a few effective sequences or concepts, like the Pterosaur attack on the tourists, the rousing Indominus/t-rex fight and the earlier revelation about the former.

The movie runs 126 minutes and was shot mainly in Hawaii, but also California and Louisiana.

Although you can enjoy this film at home or in the 2D/3D movie theater,
I strongly recommend you watch this in the 4D theater if possible.
Otherwise, you may not completely understand all that you can experience in this film.
Moving seat, flashing light, sudden air, and water splash will take you to the wonderful world.
I hope someday we will be able to experience such 4D effects at home.

For my review, I enumerate the commons and the differences between Jurassic World(2015) and Jurassic Park(1993).

Have in common:
- Describes crisis by co-exsistence of humans and dinosaurs
- Place (the same island)
- Family love story
- Regeneration dinosaurs by genetic engineering
- A company scientist

Jurassic World:
- After open the park
- Disaster film taste
- Add romance
- Revival of original species
- More vivid, realistic, and spectacular (mainly due to 3D/4D effects)
- A little bit longer
- Respects for prequels

Jurassic Park:
- Before open the park
- Focus on a few characters
- Clear and concise storytelling
- Creation of novel species
- Scarier and more humane plots
- Better acting

As you see, what suprises me is the fact that Jurassic Park still bears to watch.
Anyway, you had better watch this film to enjoy comparing them
and to witness the Hollywood evolution including partial degeneration (like from dinosaurs to humans) in these two decades.",1440028800,,1454,4.991735537190083

6696825,1,B00NYC65M8,"Horrible.

Chris walks around with a ""Who farted?!"" expression on his face for the entire movie.

The plot holes are ridiculous and near-constant. When the dinosaurs are the ONLY believable part of your film, you've done something stupidly wrong as a filmmaker. The characters, sequence of events and major plot points are so idiotic that Michael Bay's Transformers flicks appear Oscar-worthy in comparison.

Had those two obnoxious kids been eaten early on, I would've given this five stars. But alas, they just whine, cry and bicker with one another the whole film. It even goes as far as stating that a kid hitting puberty is going to be more distracted by random chicks, rather than, Y'KNOW DINOSAURS WHICH WERE BELIEVED EXTINCT BUT HAVE NOW BEEN REVIVED AND ARE WITHIN TOUCHING DISTANCE?! No could would act like a bored snot-bag when you've got a T-Rex just inches from your stupid face. This brat's constant need to be a little emo became so grating I wished he would've just been crushed to death in that little orb. And about that orb--what kind of theme park would allow underage children to pilot vehicles that are given free-driving reign amidst hundreds of uncontrolled dinosaurs?! Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot I was supposed to not think about the movie when I watched it because that's all the filmmakers wanted viewers to do.

Everything in the movie was purely done to progress a nonsensical story from point A to B without nary at logical thought on how to get there. Nearly every single scene is completely flawed if you just take a millisecond to think about it. Oh, the Indominus Rex can communicate with Raptors because it's half raptor? Why doesn't it communicate with the T-Rex since it's half Rex? Oh, because then you wouldn't have a DERPIN' showdown at the end. God bless.

I loved Jurassic Park 1 and 2, but it's as if the filmmakers tossed those gems out and instead used Jurassic Park 3 as an outline for their endeavor.

Though, that brutally prolonged death of that one chick was pretty entertaining as it was the only moment that the director tried to do something different with the direction.",1439769600,16,2122,4.784153005464481
6696826,4,B00NYC65M8,"Director: Colin Trevorrow

Screenwriter: Rick Jaffa

Cast: Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Vincent DOnofrio, Irrfan Kahn, and B.D. Wong

Dinosaurs have appeared in films before. Some good, some bad. Chris Pratt has appeared in films before. Most good, one bad; Im talking to you Movie 43. So, in the spirit of Jurassic Worlds genetic scientists, why not get these two crazy kids together and see what happens? Just like in the film, the result is a new dinosaur  bigger, faster, and more teeth.

Thats right, twenty-two years after the chaotic events of Jurassic Park, an actual park called Jurassic World has opened on the same Costa Rican island. The trouble is, people have already grown bored just seeing a dinosaur nowadays. Or at least thats what director of operations, Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard), says as she tries to entice investors to sponsor a new attraction. The new attraction? A new hybrid dinosaur nicknamed the Indominous Rex, genetically engineered by Jurassic World scientists. Simon Masrani (Irrfan Kahn) was entrusted with Jurassic Parks legacy by former owner John Hammond with the stipulation that the focus remains shock, awe, and amusement, spare no expense.

Accordingly, Claire has been killing it for Masrani. Park attendance spikes every time a new attraction is unveiled, and Inominous promises to be the most impressive attraction yet. When questions about proper containment of the Indominous Rex arise, Masrani asks Claire to bring in former Navy recruit and current Velociraptor behavioral researcher, Owen Grady (Chris Pratt). Claires history with Owen is a bit rocky due to a rough first date a while back, but Owens success training Velociraptors makes him vital to identifying any faults that may weaken the containment of the new dinosaur.

Since discussing the rest of the movie hinges on this point, I don't think Im spoiling anything when I say that, yes, Indominous Rex escapes. And what makes matters worse, Claires young nephews Zach (Nick Robinson) and Gray (Ty Simpkins) happen to be visiting the park when all hell breaks loose. Soon enough they, along with thousands of other visitors, are stranded in the park as Indominous Rex wreaks havoc. What follows is a terrifically entertaining prehistoric version of Predator.

I loved almost every minute of Jurassic World. Of the three sequel films, this one comes closest to capturing the majesty of the original. In an early scene, composer Michael Giacchino masterfully echoes John Williams iconic Jurassic Park theme to tremendous effect as Jurassic World is revealed for the first time. This film (wisely) distances itself from the Jurassic Park sequels and effectively reinvents itself, but not without a few welcomed references to the original film.

Jurassic World, at its core, is a standard creature feature, but it is extremely well executed. The effects famously pioneered by Steven Spielberg for the 1993 film have evolved to something even more outstanding this time around. Furthermore, a sense of fun noticeably missing from Jurassic Park: The Lost World and to a lesser extent Jurassic Park III, is back with Jurassic World.  I grew up loving the novels of Michael Crichton, and Jurassic Park was the novel of his that sparked my obsession with his books.  Crichton would only live to write one follow up novel to Jurassic Park, and that was The Lost World, which was a great book but cinematically butchered by Steven Spielberg.  Thankfully, writer Rick Jaffa and director Colin Trevorrow seem to have the same esteem for Crichton as I did and have made a film more in the spirit of his writing.

I mentioned that I loved almost every minute of Jurassic World. As with too many summer blockbusters, some of the dialogue is cringe-worthy, despite good acting overall from the cast. Also, Jurassic World crams in so much product placement, you will feel like you are at an actual theme park. When Owen sips from his cold, glass bottle of Coca-Cola, I half expected the screen to freeze and a jingle to play. There is also a weaponizing subplot involving Vincent DOnfrios character that I feel falls short. Id normally take this with a grain of salt, but I worry that this subplot is what will likely pave the way to any future films in the franchise. Nonetheless, Jurassic World works in its own right. Its a technically strong film, and one with a climax that can truly be described as dino-might. B+

Jurassic World is rated PG-13 and has a running time of 2 hours and five minutes.",1439769600,8,4506,5.00668449197861
6696827,2,B00NYC65M8,"The plot was basically Jurassic Park's, rehashed for 2015's technology and with some characters tweaked to fill marginally different roles. I wasn't bored, but I wasn't very engaged either. Over and over, a lot of the scenes kicked off to a strong start, but fizzled out into something tepid.

But, let's all be honest: Jurassic Park isn't about the plot. The plot's always been as thin a water.

Jurassic Park is about watching people get eaten by dinosaurs in gory and inventive ways. This movie does not deliver. The first movie has a guy get sticky acid spat in his face, and a dismembered hand drop out of nowhere. The second movie features a guy getting yanked out of an SUV by a T-Rex, and then swung up and ripped apart by a second T-Rex. The third movie shows us a rotting corpse tangled in a parachute, and a guy getting his neck snapped by a clever raptor.

Jurassic World has none of that. There are plenty of fake-looking CGI blood splatters, and brief scenes of CGI dinosaurs biting people (in a manner that is not at all vicious or bloody), but that's about it. There was even one scene that would've been perfectly gruesome: the one where that lady gets dropped in the water tank. I expected her to be bitten in half as she struggled in the water, then the camera cut to the tank's side windows to show us her dead bits slowly sinking as a plume of blood billows upwards. Something worthy of the first JP.

But nope, she gets swallowed whole, along with the stupid CGI pteradon that dropped her in the tank in the first place. It was a scene worthy of Sharktopus.

Cheap rehashed plot, not enough gore. Avoid, unless you're a diehard JP fan.",1439683200,,1657,4.473509933774834
6696828,1,B00NYC65M8,"First things first.  I'm a dinosaur nerd, I've read both Jurassic Park and the Lost World books and I've seen all of the movies.  I had high expectations for this movie.  I was let down so many times.  First the dinosaurs were all wrong.  After 22 years of scientific discoveries they couldn't update the look of the dinosaurs which was disappointing.  The cya move about the genetics being crossed with other animals makes them look different is a hollow excuse.  The first film gave me goosebumps when they saw the brachiosaur and the other dinosaurs. This movie just made me shake my head. The mosasaur was way too big.  This animal would have to have an incredibly large area to swim around in and the whole island would have to have an underwater enclosure just to make sure it could not get out and wreak havoc in the ocean.  The Indominus rex was ridiculous.  Lets make a dinosaur and start throwing in DNA from whatever animal we like to make it awesome.  The ability to camouflage is lifted from the pages of The Lost World where the Carnotaurus pair is camouflaged.  Not an original idea.
Now let's get to the part where we have to toss out any reasonable thinking to enjoy the movie.  The Indominus camouflages itself and nobody can see it.  GPS trackers are installed in every dinosaur so they know where they are at all times.  No one thinks to check the tracker when they can't see it. The sheer incompetence only grows from there. The fact that the geneticist created this animal with the approval of the director of the park and then the director talks with him and questions his morals and ethics is ridiculous.  The director approved of the project.  The task force that is supposed to take the Indominus down are ex-military and they can't hit the broad side of a barn, yet they somehow are able to hit a velociraptor with a rocket launcher and can't hit the Indominus with the same weapon.
You then have the guy who wants to use the raptors for military purposes.  What other animals besides dogs and horses are even used in the military?  The very idea defies any credibility of rational thought. Then of course we have the lady who runs around the jungle in high heels and a skirt.  Absolutely laughable. I don't care if she trained to run in these for the movie the idea is just silly.
The I.rex only has a taste for humans as it goes and kills half a dozen apatasuarus which measure in at over 80 feet long and weigh 20+ tons.  These animals wouldn't go down easy.  The I.rex doesn't even bother to eat one of them.  This flies in the face of what Owen Grady says about the animals in the park following there natural instincts.  I get the plot device but it is incredibly weak and contradicting.
The kids on the run find a Jeep that has sat for 22 years in a jungle habitat and they give it a new battery and it starts right up.  There are so many problems with this.  The tires are fully inflated, all the fluids are like brand new and there has been absolutely no corrosion of any part of the jeep in over 20 years?  Yeah that's totally believable.
 Then we have the showdown between the I.rex and the T-rex.  Once either animal takes a bite of the others neck the fight is over.  The T-rex slams into the I. rex and bites its neck.  The estimated bite force for a T-rex is enough to crush a car so how does the I.rex survive? It shouldn't.
I know this movie is a sci-fi flick but good sci-fi movies establish some credibility with good story telling so that what happens in the film makes some sense.  This movie doesn't do that on any level.  In my opinion this movie is at least as bad as Jurassic Park III and maybe even worse in terms of plot.",1439596800,18,3675,4.373156342182891

Basically the plot from Spielberg's original is redone with the resulting special effects mayhem. If you think I'm being too harsh consider this (and I won't give away specifics) - two main plot points are redone almost exactly. First; just as in the original we see a cold and calculating corporation, lead by an arrogant billionaire who is convinced that he can control nature and the dinosaurs and of course rake in handsome profits while doing it. Secondly, at the exact moment they find they might need to rethink the first part some adolescents will wander off and find themselves in peril. And sending the kids off in a giant hamster ball car with 75 foot dinosaurs lurking everywhere is just plain stupid (that's shown in the trailers so I'm not giving anything away).

You get the picture, dinosaurs running, flying, and swimming around killing each other and eating grandma who still has a few good years. In the beginning they hint that the audience wants action with bigger and badder dinosaurs, so they do that and sacrifice any aspect of building or creating memorable characters. I would have been happy just to see Jeff Goldblum, as an extra, getting eaten by a dinosaur.

The dinosaurs aren't any better than they were 20 years ago. The characters were bland. The film had a loose plot and I kept waiting for it to engage me.

6696841,4,B00NYC65M8,"So finally, the fourth installment of the Jurassic franchise arrives, with Steven Spielberg as producer. Though he does not direct this time (Colin Trevorrow of Safety Not Guaranteed does), Spielbergs touch is everywhere: roller coaster ride of action and suspense with stock characters and bit of humor and romance.

The film is largely set in a theme park created on the same island of Isla Nublar where incidents of Jurassic Park happened twenty-two years ago. Young brothers Zach (Nick Robinson) and Gray (Ty Simpkins) are among the visitors (more than 20,000 every day) traveling to the island.

The brothers are to be taken care of by their aunt Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), but she is too busy for that because of the parks new attraction, a genetically modified dinosaur Indominus rex. Well, and will the new dinosaur escape?

Of course, and the rest of the film is about those two irritating kids who do not listen to adults say; people in charge of the theme park who are mostly incompetent; one guy (Vincent D'Onofrio) who wants to use the parks dinosaurs as weapon; and one heroic dinosaur trainer Owen (Chris Pratt) trying to stop the chaos.

Jurassic World is a pure popcorn movie with stunning visuals and (for some viewers) a bit of nostalgia.

I liked the film but let me explain a couple of things. Since I was a child I have been fascinated by dinosaurs and I knew their names and statistics before I knew the names of all of my cousins. What can I say; I was a typical geek boy. I also loved Michael Crichton who wrote the book Jurassic Park and I consider his books to be among the best Sci-Fi I have read. I also loved the original film so I just had to see this one.

I found the film to be entertaining and full of action and the acting was solid and the CGI was perfectly done. The film animation of the dinosaurs was amazing. The film started a bit slow while it was trying to build up the character profiles and start the storyline. After the action started it was nonstop and it keeps your attention.

Chris Pratt playing Owen Grady and Bryce Dallas Howard portraying Claire Dearing both did excellent jobs. How much did I like the film? I will definitely get the DVD and add it to my collection. It is a good film. It is not perfect though. The side plot of the military trying to weaponize the dinosaurs was just stupid. It could have been left out of the plot and the film would have been just as good. I also felt the character build up at the start of the movie was too long and could have been shorter. After all, the real stars of the film are the dinosaurs!

I still gave the film 5 stars as I enjoyed it and I would pay to see it again. I was entertained and the action and CGI of the dinosaurs made the film worthwhile to see.",1438732800,,1630,4.040247678018575

I hadn't beeen inside a theatre in many years, so when my friend Chris dropped in for a visit from out-of-town,  we decided to go downtown during a heatwave to watch this movie in an IMAX 3 D theatre and cool off at the same time, I didn't realize that 3 D stood for Triple Deafening sound. Even Rock Concerts in my younger days never got this loud. The price of admission for seniors was $13.50 - some bargain, that's just about the price of owning the DVD itself. And then a SMALL popcorn and a SMALL drink cost another $12+, that's double the price of a walk-in medium pepperoni pizza at any local PIZZA restaurant.

Before the movie even started, we had to sit through 40 minutes of COMMERCIALS and PREVIEWS, just what you want to get away from when you're going to a theatre. Some of the commercials were so annoying, they were set up as quizzes, trying to sneakily grab your attention.

Finally we got to see the movie, I found that while the 3 D glasses helped the effects, the darkness was like watching a movie with sunglasses, so the brightness of the scenes was taken away. Overall, this was a very enjoyable movie, the only thing missing that I would have liked to seen would have been an American dentist big game hunter being eaten by one of the dinosaurs, maybe that'll happen in the next sequel.

Almost better than the original film due to the stunning advancement in computer graphic capabilities over the last 20 years.  No more animitronics as in the original.  Hard to top the original film with the introduction of Velociraptor answering circa 1995 type questions ""what's a Raptor"" and ""Is it tougher than a T-Rex?"", Alfred Hitchcock style T-Rex paddock scene (""Where's the goat?""), T-Rex tiny forearms tearing through multi-stranded steel cables like they are cob webs (""Boy, do I hate being right all the time""), T-Rex vs. Jeep Wrangler (""You think they'll have that on the tour?"") and classic Raptor indoor man hunt and Grand Finale.  I love the tradition of Jurassic Grand Finale surprises and Jurassic World does not disappoint in this respect.  The Lost World scenes also holding their own in comparison: T-Rex parental skills and ""that's not a Grizzly Bear outside the tent, it's T-Rex"".

I won't talk a lot about sequences in the film here as not to ruin it for you, but just one nit.  SPOILER ALERT! A single criticism: even if you think an animal may have escaped its enclosure, you don't casually decide to do an unplanned inspection.  Not often that the hero makes this kind of error in judgement precipitating all of the unfortunate events which follow.  Our hero was at least culpable, he did casually enter the enclosure of Indominus Rex right along with the mindless caretakers.  Usually its a hapless extra that makes this kind of error all on their own. Jurassic World still gets five stars from me and suffice it to say I will be buying a copy of this movie and pick up a copy of the first trilogy whilst I am at it.

I'm glad the approach was to do a re-boot of the series.  Hollywood and the general movie going public finally understand this concept after comic books pioneered it for 50 years.  It's good for the industry and movie quality.  Jurassic World is a case in point.",1438560000,2,2443,4.7035294117647055

So this doesn't work out, and a bunch of people die. We get to SEE them die. This one girl gets pecked by these reptilian pelican CGI things, and then swallowed by a giant fish! Other people get dropped, smashed, blown up, but mostly eaten. It is magical.

Chris Pratt saves everyone with the help of some other people, and we basically get the notion that there will be a sequel. Because movies with strong openings but zero value after two months totally deserve sequels. Regardless, watching people get eaten and blown up was pretty nice, so it deserves one play.

Description: A new theme park is built on the original site of Jurassic Park. Everything is going well until the parks newest attractiona genetically modified giant stealth killing machineescapes containment and goes on a killing spree.

*Source IMDB:[...]

Indominus rex was pretty cool! But in the end even he was too weak! Maybe if he had lasers or bazookas attached to him it might be a different story, just kidding (well no not really). The movie wasn't that bad, it had some little parts that were cool and exciting, but most of it was ""Come on! Really!""

SPOILERS! BEWARE!

I'm no actor, far from it, but man they were not afraid of the dinosaur at all! I liked the sweaty fat cop guy, especially when indominus rex was like NOM NOM NOM! CHEESYPOOFS!

Pros:
1. I really enjoy the movie in its form. I love the fact about the scientist from the first move, was in this one. Bringing back the original first movie and 4 together. Same island, just time went by.
2. I really like the fact about how large organization who first thoughts, (more like the dark side of organization) how to make money and what they will do to make it. Who to say this don't happen today...
3. There was a few side stories, one I enjoy picking up that there a point where it comes to what is important. Family or work. It a good topic and many people will choose work first before family, but that's another topic and its a pro and con to many people.

Con:
1. What's with the side story about the two brother family divorce. Its a pro or con for a movie but personally I thought it was just a waist of time. Should have focused on other stories.
2. Ending was interesting. There was no mystery on how this movie going to end. I fig out the ending way in the beginning of the movie. Still, this movie have few different endings that brought a new level that was either great ending, or just plainly funny to me.

Either pro or con:
1. If you think this may be the last of the movies, nope lol! I love how this movie ended. It left a mystery that could lead to other things! To me its a pro, and just let my imagination fly! There no need to make other movies! But if there others, I hope its more to the dark side and not another organization trying to make another park.

Over all I would give this movie 5 star. But I gave it a three.
-1 for predictable ending.
-1 for unneeded side stories.",1438214400,,1647,4.108695652173913

6696855,5,B00NYC65M8,"Jurassic World brings back iconic elements from the original 1993 film but thrusts us forward into uncharted Jurassic territory.

Jurassic World, a 2015 American science fiction adventure film, is the fourth installment of the Jurassic Park series and directed by Colin Trevorrow. The screenplay, written in a harrowing three weeks, is written by Rick Jaffa & Amanda Silver and Derek Connolly & Colin Trevorrow. The film stars Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Vincent D'Onofrio, Ty Simpkins, Nick Robinson, Omar Sy, Irrfan Khan and B.D. Wong, who is the only actor to reprise his role from any of the previous films. Trevorrow did a great job directing the film, however, a more Hitchcock style might've added more thriller aspects giving it the edge of your seat feel that would be hard to top.

The film is set twenty-two years later on Isla Nublar, the original location of the Jurassic Park film, with a thriving theme park complete with various rides, stores and hotels. The park looks like it has been thriving for quite some time without incident until a genetically created dinosaur, the Indominus Rex, escapes its containment area and creates havoc across the island. This premise is unique in that the audience is immersed into the world quickly. The beauty of the island is breathtaking. The production design is elaborate and should be commended. While the film was shot with Panavision lenses, a Cook lens might have givenit more depth of beauty to the long shots and the landscapes.

Jurassic World falls nicely into the timeline created by the first three films and the theme of this film also resonates with the original as well. It is a matter of showing respect to every living creature and what happens when you don't. The character arcs were typical for this type of film as we see Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) go from strictly business to appreciate the animals in the park, and realizing the family she's missed out on all along. Some missed opportunities were utilizing Jake Johnson's character, Lowery, in a more comedic role and the villain, Vincent D'Onofrio's character, Hoskins, could have been more conniving, something to the effect of how D'Onofrio played Wilson Fisk on Daredevil (the Netflix series).

Jurassic World is quite the paced action-adventure beat by beat and with a sequel already in the works, it will be worth the wait if it's anything like this one. In the meantime we'll take Owen's (Chris Pratt) advice:
Claire: So now what do we do?
Owen: Probably stay together. For survival.",1438128000,184,2527,4.966903073286052

6696859,3,B00NYC65M8,"Jurassic World is an exciting chase-n-chomp action thriller that gives the Jurassic Park franchise some scary new teeth.

The setup is tremendously exciting and so obvious a continuation of story from the original that you wonder they didn't film this version twenty years ago.  Two brothers, Gray (Ty Simpkins) and Zach (Nick Robinson) are sent off by their divorcing parents to spend some quality time with their aunt Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard in icy career-girl mode), who happens to be the director of the worlds most exciting zoo, Jurassic World.  The visual design of this park is utterly believable, a mashup of Disney World and high-tech Sea World tropes, complete with petting zoo attractions where kiddos can ride little triceratops, a massive Sea World like show with a huge megaladon as its star (watching it rise from the lake-size tank to snap up a great white shark is a park highlight) and rafting excursions where you can paddle right beneath the long necks of the vegetarian river denizens.  Most excitingly, theres a gyrosphere ride (a 2-person, stabilized hamster ball) that puts you on the plains where the herding dinos roam.  And of course the main park village has gift shops (all those tee shirts and mugs from the first movie finally get put to use here), an IMAX, Starbucks and a Ben & Jerrys.

The behind-the-scenes control room, lab, and holding pens are where we learn the set up; Dr. Henry Wu, the geneticist (B.D. Wong, the only actor from the original movie) has been serving up a fresh new world of dinosaurs and was charged with creating an ultimate dino mash up to scare up new parkgoers and sponsors.  Hes done his job all too well, and the Indominus Rex is being tested out in his jungly paddock.  Claire brings in their resident Velociraptor-whisperer, Owen Grady (Chris Pratt), who immediately assesses that the creatures containment is not good enough, and that the thing is just too unpredictable to be safe for tourists.  And he has an InGen guy, Hoskins (Vincent DOnofrio) pushing him to move his training of the creatures to military use.  It isn't long before the overly developed I-Rex makes its highly intelligent moves, throwing the park into chaos.

The effects are fairly seamless, the CGI not too overwhelming, and the action sequences have mounting thrills.  The final dino smackdown is probably the best yet presented in this franchise.  Director Colin Trevorrow keeps it well-paced, offering frames filled with both wonder and tension.  There are obvious homages and references to the original without being too kiss-uppy.  The score by Michael Giacchino preserves the swooping notes of original composer John Williams iconic work.

As is true of too many action flicks, character development is a bit lacking; we get one-dimensional strokes from our two leads, though they are likeable.  Chris Pratt (Guardians of the Galaxy, Zero Dark Thirty) again proves he can carry a summer blockbuster playing an ex military type who decided to train velociraptors (the scenes with him and his charges are fun), but we want a little more backstory on this guy.  Bryce Dallas Howard is the show runner whos been out of touch with her sister and nephews, driven to make Jurassic World a huge success, but why?  Dialogue alludes to her not having kids of her own, and she initially treats her nephews like another chore to be handed to her assistant; a little more exposition would have been good.  The imperiled brothers Gray and Zach are believable as siblings (why do the Jurassic Park movies have so many parent issues?) and receive some terrifying nose-to-teeth action.  Some kids might find a scene or two a bit too intense.  Neither of the boys have the charisma of the originals precocious young dino expert, Timmy, but they prove to be resourceful and carry the kids POV duties well.  As the parks billionaire owner and wannabe adventurer, Masrani, (Irrfan Khan of Life of Pi, Slumdog Millionaire) steps nicely into John Hammonds shoes, a carpe diem visionary who takes his dream a bit too far.

Many will want to see Jurassic World as the rightful and only sequel to Steven Spielbergs groundbreaking 1993 Jurassic Park.  The Lost World was truly Spielberg at his worst, but Jurassic Park III had good story and action sequences.  Jurassic World fits nicely into the fold and opens up some possibility for new directions, because we can never get enough of a T-Rexs roar and velociraptors that sneer like Elvis.

CLICHES: Why does the military always take over and screw things up terribly?  How did we win so many wars?
SURPRISES:  The scenes of Chris Pratt on his motorcycle running with the raptor gang made me laugh, but somehow it works.
KID FACTOR:  Definitely intense, so smaller kids or those averse to fangs might want to skip this one.  Mild bad language, no sex other than the teen brother leering at all those young girls.  If your kid handled any of the other Jurassic Park flicks, they're good to go here.",1437609600,8,4972,4.882142857142857

6696863,1,B00NYC65M8,"You can't say I didn't warn you.

I don't get why this movie is breaking all box office records. Maybe I need to see it in 3D, but the story was absolutely ludicrous. It was basically a remake, not really a sequel. Instead of 2 kids lost in a park, they're lost in a BIGGER park and chased by a BIGGER T-Rex, with a name (Indominus Rex) that sounds like it came straight from a Transformer movie. And the adults go rescue these stupid kids with the aid of TRAINED VELOCIRAPTERS! Yes, trained velocirapters! ""Hey...I told you to seek them, not eat them!""  Did I say it was ludicrous?

There's a little subplot about an evil military dude who wants to take away the trainer's velociraptors to use as weapons on the desert battlefield! That makes a whole lot of sense...animals that are accustomed to tropical weather, plopped down in the middle of the desert. Oh, and did I mention that these beasts are on the verge of eating their trainer every second, like lions in a cage at a circus? Well, yes, one false move and you're a dino-bite. For the life of me, I can't figure out why the Pentagon isn't using trained lions in the war on terror! Betcha can't guess what happens to evil military dude.

Near the end, we get flying dinosaurs doing their best impression of Hitchcock's, ""The Birds"" and then, lo and behold, who comes to the rescue? It's our old friend T-Rex coming for a smackdown! For the grand finale, it's the battle of the Rexes...T vs Indominus!

With human body parts and blood strewn throughout the place, there's lots of hugging and kissing by all. Hey, after all, they just saved a fortune on raw meat for the dinosaurs. Plug in the spare deep freezers! Now that's a billion dollar movie. Sheesh!",1437264000,22,1714,4.498392282958199

6696865,3,B00NYC65M8,"It's setting records at the box office and is the most talked about film in years, Jurassic World, the thrilling true sequel to Jurassic Park. I loved Jurassic Park and felt that both sequels didn't do justice to the original, so when they announced that this film would go on the premise that the two sequels never happened, I was extremely excited. Like everyone else, I rushed to the theaters to see, the exact same film I saw twenty years earlier. The tech is better, the effects are better, but the story is almost identical, to the point where each character has an equivalent in the original film. In Jurassic Park, the T-Rex escapes while the kids are in a car, touring the park. In Jurassic World, the Adominus-Rex escapes while the kids are in a sphere, touring the park. This is just one example of literally dozens of parallels to the original film. The only real difference is Chris Pratt, as he is a hell of a lot more believable than Sam Neill was, and his infectious personality makes him the type of guy that everyone wants to be friends with. From his simple start on the WB's Everwood to becoming a Guardian of The Galaxy, Chris Pratt has established himself as one of Hollywood's brightest future stars, but aside from his performance, this is the same film! The Jurassic franchise has the benefit of being created by one of the greatest science fiction writers of all time. It is produced by perhaps the greatest Director of all time, and once again it introduces moviegoers to some amazing new special effects, but none of it matters when the story just isn't there. With this film people were hoping for something new and exciting from the franchise, a turn in a whole other direction, instead they got a film that is little more than a remake of the original, and a disappointing one at that.",1437264000,2,1816,4.590769230769231
6696866,4,B00NYC65M8,"I have to admit I came into this movie with sky-high expectations. Which ultimately let me down a little bit. Jurassic World is the forth installment of the Jurassic series. Having watched and loved of the previous movies I was super excited for this movie.
  The movie centralizes around Jurassic World a new and ""improved"" version of the original Jurassic Park located on the original island that Ingen began making dinosaurs on. The new park is run by Masrani Corp. but still maintains Ingen interests. It is the belief of the Masrani Corp that people are bored with regular dinosaurs and must engineer new more dangerous dinos to maintain attraction levels.
  The story line follows Claire Dearing the park manager played by Bryce Dallas Howard. She invites her nephews to the park for a fun time, but as expected all hell breaks loose. Owen Grady is the main hero of this movie portrayed very well by Chris Pratt. In a whole sense it is similar to Jurassic Park with a few new additions such as the raptors being led by Owen as their alpha.
  All in all this is good movie. The graphics are done as well as you could hope for and very believable. There is plenty of action and chaos. The dinosaur scenes are beautiful I was truly pleased with them. All of the actors gave great performances especially Pratt. I would recommend this movie for just about anyone.

6696874,1,B00NYC65M8,"Let me first say that I think the idea behind a Jurassic World does lend itself to the possibility of some seriously good ideas when writing the script. My question would be after seeing it, What happened? I'm not going to say one bad thing about people who gave it 5 stars because if you honestly enjoyed it that much, I'm seriously very happy for you and you got what you wanted from this long awaited sequel. But on the other end of the spectrum, you have people like myself that feel like we must have been shown the wrong movie. I had very high hopes for this movie and restrained myself from watching the multitude of spoiler trailers. I went in fresh wanting to see them reboot this franchise after the Jurassic Park 3 train wreck. But this movie was disappointing on all levels for me. I would go so far as to say it is my least favorite of the franchise. And here is why I feel compelled to say this.

The CGI through this film was VERY hit and miss. Sometimes the dinosaurs looked really great, then all of a sudden it was just painfully obvious from there movement that it wasn't correctly polished. Number 2, The introduction of the two boys leading to the ""Bubble Car"" scene and through out was disturbingly bad. The actors chosen for these roles were totally inept with no acting skills to speak of. Any 2 boys could have played those roles. Now we get to the bubble car itself. Oh dear, this was  just a totally ridiculous concept. Lets have people of all ages enter a steerable bubble vehicle that can roam free amongst 200 ton prehistoric animals!??? You're kidding right?

Now let us enter the truly ridiculous zone with ""Training Raptors"" to behave as if they were dogs. Are you seriously trying to sell that idea??  Raptors that are trained by humans?!? We're supposed to buy that raptors will allow numerous vehicles to travel with and around them while chasing down this new ""Frankensaur"" that was created in a lab? Later as these ""trained"" raptors eventually hunt down and make contact with this genetic freak, the raptors actually make a decision to switch sides and go after the humans based on the fact the Frankensaur has a splash of Raptor DNA in it. Then after switching sides and going on a epic killing spree, The raptors switch sides yet again by just making eye contact with the lead character whom they have a soft spot for in there little Dino hearts. They proceed to turn, and jump the mighty beast out of loyalty to there human trainer with whom they bonded!!! WOW!! Good grief that is terrible writing! Not remotely believable to an audience on any level. Really cheesy type of SYFI Channel B movie garbage.

I could EASILY go on but I prefer not to bore you with pointing out the ocean of nonsense that this movie provided. I will wait patiently for what will probably be another sequel to this franchise while keeping my fingers crossed. Please take the time to seek out a director next time with the credentials to handle such a huge undertaking. In my opinion, beg Speilberg on your hands and knees to write and create something that at the very least makes sense with good characters.",1436659200,29,3127,4.537234042553192

6696878,4,B00NYC65M8,"""Jurassic World"" is a review-proof movie. No matter what any review says, the movie will make money.

So, it's a relief to say that the film is actually pretty good. A worthy companion to the original classic.

The two most notable things about ""World"" are the director and lead. Colin Treverrow, a San Francisco native, directed his first feature film ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" for $750,000. Someone, somewhere apparently liked that film. Liked it a lot. Because his follow-up is ""World"", with a reported budget of $150,000,000. I haven't seen ""Safety Not Guaranteed"", many haven't, but how does someone make a jump like this? It is virtually unheard of. What is even more miraculous is that Treverrow handles the leadership of this monumental colossus well and gives it the respect it deserves while injecting some fresh and exciting bits. It is a good mix which is making the film appeal to even more people than expected.

Treverrow clearly knows how to handle the conventions of a monster epic. He does a really smart thing, replicating the reveal of the T-Rex in the original ""Jurassic Park"". In ""World"", the brain- trust running the park creates it's own dinosaur, the Indominous Rex, a meaner, badder, bigger relative of the T-Rex. As in the original, it takes a while for us to get our first glimpse of the beast. We get fleeting glances at specific areas, giving us a preview of the size and ferocity of the beast, making us anticipate and leaving us wanting more.

And it also seems like a stroke of genius to cast current It-Boy Chris Pratt as the lead. Pratt plays Owen, a large animal handler who has been working with the raptors on the island for so long they recognize him as the Alpha Male and follow his lead and command.

As Owen, he captures our attention almost as quickly as he commands the raptors. An anti-hero, Owen jumps into action when things start to go haywire.

Pratt is extremely amiable but not gorgeous in a Brad Pitt or George Clooney way - he looks like an ordinary good-looking guy. This, combined with his natural magnetism and good nature make him someone everyone can identify with. So far, he has also been cast as the smart-alecky anti-hero, someone who isn't necessarily ready to save the world, but will answer the hero's call to action.

Pratt is a good actor and helps to make each of his big-screen personas amusing and slightly off-center. In ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", his insistence at being called ""Star-Lord"" created some funny exchanges and showed how the hero was more than a little full of himself. In ""Jurassic World"", Owen is less sarcastic, but he does manage to utter a few terse words, causing laughter.

Given Pratt's background in television comedy, it's not really a surprise that he can add levity to the roles he is playing. What is a surprise is that he is quickly becoming the Action Hero, cast in just about every high profile movie project. There are rumors that he will be ""Indiana Jones"" in a reboot. This would be a logical next step for the burgeoning A-lister. Pratt has the type of persona that makes him watchable - this, and all of the other attributes discussed seem to make him destined to become the next mega star.

Bryce Dallas Howard plays Claire, the workaholic who lives, breathes and eats her job as the administrator of the park. She is equally comfortable trying to get a corporate backer for a new exhibit as she is talking to the technicians behind the scenes. But when her nephews Gray and Zach (Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson) show up, she enlists her assistant Zara (Katie McGrath, the British TV show ""Merlin"") to watch after them.

Howard has been around for a while and it seems like she has never caught on with the pubic at large. At the start of her career, she was in a number of high-profile projects, none of which made her a star, then she disappeared for a while. Now, she is back in ""World"". But does she add anything to the role? Not really. Her portrayal of Claire is easily eclipsed by Pratt and they never really build any of the required chemistry. Pratt tries hard, Owen flirts with Claire  from the beginning, but it almost seems like Howard's Claire is completely unaware of this attention and they are never able to create the necessary romantic tension.

The best part of Howard's character? She runs in high heel shoes throughout the film. It's pretty much a requirement of this genre to have a woman running in high- heels. And it fits that her character, the upwardly mobile business-woman would feel it necessary to wear such shoes in a humid island environment, to show her dedication to the job.

The rest of the cast is filled with recognizable character actors, all of whom do a good job in their limited, serviceable roles. Irrfan Khan (""Slumdog Millionaire"", ""The Life of Pi"") plays Masrani, the new owner of the company that owns the new, larger Jurassic World. He is dedicated to upholding the legacy of John Hammond but also a bit too full of himself. Jake Johnson (TV's ""New Girl""), Omar Sy (""The Intouchables"") and Lauren Lapkus (""Orange Is The New Black"") are various members of the staff.  BD Wong returns as Dr. Henry Wu, the geneticist behind the dinosaurs. And Vincent D'Onofrio (TV's ""Law & Order: Criminal Intent"", ""Full Metal Jacket"", ""The Judge"") plays an obsessed black-ops type determined to use technology from the island for shady government purposes.

There are a lot of nice touches to ""World"", that help to make it work on a larger, bigger scale. Much like the Disney and Universal counterparts, Jurassic World has a huge complex of shops, restaurants and hotels greeting visitors as soon as they arrive. Every mall has a Ben & Jerry's, a Starbucks, a Sunglass Hut and this park is no exception. Every movie has product placements. ""World"" is no exception. So, this is a creative way of building in this obligatory bit of business. It's also fun to watch these places actually play into the action.

Trevorrow has some fun creating scenes throughout that pay homage to some of the classic moments from the original. While they are similar, and it is easy to spot them when they happen, they are distinct enough to be new and create some suspense. There is also a bit that revisits the original film in a very overt way, providing a very real link to the classic.

There are a number of reasons ""Jurassic World"" is such a huge success. First and foremost? Pratt and his undeniable charisma and likability. Trevorrow seems to have a lot of fun playing with all of the different toys in this tool box. And he has some fun creating new dinosaurs and new suspense. All of this helps to create a fun, exhilarating experience.",1436486400,8,6663,4.69580119965724
6696879,3,B00NYC65M8,"It was fairly clear, even from the trailers, that this was not so much of a Jurassic Park sequel as it was a quasi-reboot of the franchise. True, it wasn't actually a reboot, but after 20+ years, this movie tried to do what Mad Max did and reignite the spark of an old franchise. I can't speak to whether or not Mad Max was a good film, I haven't seen it yet, but I will say that Jurassic World only succeeded in a very small way.

I have heard people say over and over that the plot is simply the recycled plot of the original film. I don't feel that this is really a fair statement. World picks up where, essentially, the first movie left off. I disregard the second and third movies because there is really zero reference to them and they almost feel like the Highlander 2's of the franchise...fans and audiences are better severed pretending they never existed. Thusly, the park has actually been open and in operation for what we the audience must assume has been over ten or even fifteen years. Why? Because through exposition of one of our leads, Bryce Dallas Howard, we are given to understand that people have actually started to get over the fact that dinosaurs once again walk the earth and have actually become bored with them. Now this particular plot point is actually rather interesting and isn't really so far fetched. If scientists were able to ""resurrect"" dinosaurs and put them into a giant zoo/park, how quickly would people living in the age of Internet attention spans become bored with even the very idea of dinosaurs and look for the next cool/hot thing? As such, the people at Jurassic are pushed to come up with new ideas to reinvigorate sales. This new idea comes in the form of not bringing another yet-unseen species into the fold, but creating a brand new one from scratch utilizing multiple DNA traits from multiple dinosaur (and other animal) sources.

This is my first bone of contention with the film. The people at Jurassic create a brand new hybrid dinosaur, and yet we find out that not a single person at Jurassic/Ingen has a single idea about what this new dinosaur can do. Apparently, because of the multiple DNA chains utilized in its creation, this dinosaur can drop its body temperature to avoid detection by thermal sensors as well as adapt it's skin tone to create perfect, undetectable camouflage. Even going on the assumption of the ""rapid growth"" Dr. Wu describes later in the film, I find it insulting to the aduience's intelligence that it is presumed this animal never displayed these abilities before the movie's timeline nor did any scientist thoroughly examine this dinosaur just to see what all of this DNA fusing did to the animal. We're just supposed to accept the fact that everyone working there, including the top scientists, are complete morons.

The sub-plot we are treated to would probably have actually been a far better main plot than the existing one. The concept of using dinosaurs as biological weapons could have provided us with a very interesting movie that not only has action, but a moral dilemma of using animals (despite the fact that they were created in a lab) as weapons for some corporation/government. Unfortunately, it was regulated to the sub-plot category and only served to create some action scenes as well as a mysterious, unexplained deal between two of the main characters.

On the heels of this sub-plot, however, comes a rather interesting concept. I am referring to Chris Pratt's character working with and partially training the velociraptors. I thought this was actually a very interesting idea and I was pleased to see that they were doing it in a rather realistic way. When Pratt first appears on screen, he is using a clicker as a tool to train the raptors. I thought this was an excellent idea, as just about every wild animal in existence that is trained in some fashion or another has had the clicker and food rewards utilized to facilitate it. Because of that, when I saw Pratt using it on screen, as well as the food reward, I didn't think it was hokey or outrageous and being done to foster some kind of ""raptor whisperer"" persona. I thought, ""You know, that's actually how they would probably do it if raptors existed."" It also helped that the raptors hadn't turned into some kind of stupid lap dogs that had this otherworldly connection with Pratt. They were still vicious, lethal hunting machines that wouldn't hesitate for a moment to eat someone, including Pratt if he let his guard down. In a fantastical movie about dinosaurs, I actually liked this small part of injecting a bit of realism into it.

Now, the raptors. Regardless of the fact that the CG was used to death in this movie (I thought the T-Rex looked and sounded terrible), I was actually very pleased with the raptors, particularly in the way their movements were done. In all of the other movies, when you see the raptors running, they are doing so with their heads up and their forelimbs partially extended. In World, see the raptors running was a true treat. Instead of the other three films, these raptors ran with their heads and necks straight forward or even low to the ground so they could try and pick up scent and their forelimbs tucked up against their bodies to minimize wind resistance. It was very serpentine and predatory in nature and I thought it fit them perfectly.

Now, let's talk about the Indominous Rex, or I-Rex as I've seen it nicknamed. As many people have already said, this thing was nothing more than a giant raptor. That's it. Oh sure it had the camo ability from the cuttlefish and could drop its body temp because of tree frog DNA, but this was really nothing more than a big raptor with some extra spikes on its spine. How is this a game-changer? It's not any different, just a bigger version of the regular raptors. I suppose creating a T-Rex sized raptor could cause several raised eyebrows since raptors are considered almost as smart as apes in this franchise, but there isn't that 'wow' factor one would expect from Jurassic Park.

The rest of the movie was pretty much a cookie-cutter monster survival movie, with the one exception of the big three-way I-Rex/T-Rex/Velociraptor battle. I did enjoy that, though again I was sorely disappointed in the rendering of the T-Rex. Out of all four films, I think this one really did it worst, I know the production company said they used animatronics for the most part for the dinosaurs, but it was CG'ed so badly I couldn't even tell.

There's more to say, but I would be here all day discussing it. Overall, I would say don't waste your $13 paying for a theater ticket, or even spending the same kind of money or more the DVD. This movie makes for a decent rental and that's really about it.",1436486400,,6747,4.673400673400673
6696880,3,B00NYC65M8,"Not a great movie.  Pratt was good, although not nearly as good as Guardians of Galaxy.  He did not make this movie in the same way.  And Ms. Howard was bad; very stiff and not a believable character.  She makes me wonder if she is much of an actress.  I liked her previous stuff but she was a poor actor in this one.  The characters just didn't develop.  We think the kids are upset because their parents might be getting a divorce but then there is nothing more about that, so why was it included?  No sense of who these characters are, so I really didn't care if they lived or not.  Truthfully I only enjoyed the workers in the control/security room, they were funny.  Most of the acting was below average in this film, maybe because it is hard to get going when everything is computer, I don't know.",1436486400,5,803,4.293333333333333
6696881,3,B00NYC65M8,"I got exactly what I expected from this movie: a lot of dinosaurs, characters I could sort of care about, and an air conditioned room to sit in for a couple of hours.  Really, if a movie title starts with ""Jurassic"" you're going to get dinosaurs running around doing terrible things and people trying to stop them.  Hasn't it been this way from the beginning?  Only this time it's more dinosaurs, more different kinds of dug-up dinosaurs (even petting zoo dinosaurs) and even dinosaurs that never even existed because the mad scientists at Jurassic World have combined DNA from all kinds of dinosaurs and other critters to make dinosaurs that are unique ""assets"" at the theme park.  I loved the line about corporate sponsorship for dinosaurs: ""Pepsi-saurus"" ha ha ha.

The only other thing I'll give away is that I remember a scene when the Asian geneticist was drinking tea in the laboratory.  The scene started with a shot of some little critter encased in amber, and then the camera panned over to the tea drinking scientist, and the tea was almost the exact same shade as the amber the critter was encased in.  Ewwwwwww.

And why is it now that whenever any hero character gets in trouble in any movie they always say, ""Oh no no...no no no no no...no no no...

But there's humor in this movie too; at least a little bit.

This is one of those movies that's great as long as you don't break the bank to see it.  It's one thing to spend fifty bucks to take your wife and two kids to a theatre to see it once, and another thing to wait and spend three bucks sometime in the future to see it streaming into your home.  I recommend the latter.  Then of course you have to wonder if you'll ever want to see it again in which case there's the DVD purchase decision.  In my case the answer is no, but it was two hours of Jurassic fun that I don't regret investing in.",1436486400,,1863,4.393586005830904

6696883,4,B00NYC65M8,"My mom and I saw this movie today.  I had read nothing about it.  So, I really did not know to expect.

The movie is about a park.  It is Jurassic Park.  It has living dinosaurs walking around for all those who come to the park to see.  There is a lady who works there.  She is totally into her job.  She kind of has nothing else to think about.  Her mind is 100% on the park.  Her sister lets her two kids go to see their aunt.  The aunt is busy and sends the kids to see the park with one of her helpers.  Something happens.

Now, as dangerous as dinosaurs are, there are things at this park that seem to have the possibility of being even more so.  What theyve done is create their own dinosaurs.  They took DNA and mixed it all up.  One of these they have created seems to show signs of being violet and much smarter than they thought it could be.

I do not want to give it away.  But things happen that require them to close the park.  The problem is, the park is full of people.  So, what can they do?

They have a man who works there.  He seems to have a connection to some of the creatures.  He is trying to help them.  To make things worse, the two kids who were sent to be with their aunt, are stuck outside, right in the open, allowing the creatures to get to them when they wish.  Now, the man, with the aunt, has to try and save the kids, while surviving themselves and getting away from the danger.

To make things even worse, there is a man who seems to want to use the creatures as military weapons.  At a point, he starts making his own rules and just taking things over.  Him and the man who has the connection with the animals do not agree on this.  So, you have all of these conflicts happening.

The graphics look great.  Everything was beautiful and blended well together.  The actors all did a great job.  There didn't really seem to be any that was above the next.  They all just fit together.  I was interested the entire time in seeing what was going to happen.

So, what did I not like?  Well, firstly, the story just kind of happens all of a sudden.  There really was no build up.  It was almost like they had another part that was the beginning that was taken out.  You just were dropped right into everything. Dont get me wrong.  Things are good, then stuff happens and good turns to bad.  It just seems like they could have give it a bit more time to get there.

Also, there were things that happened that really went nowhere.  They give you a few scenes with a man flying a helicopter.  You learn about him flying it.  I told myself that this was going to be important later in the film.  It was not.  Stuff like that happened throughout.  Just this and that which had no point.

Then, ok so all this stuff starts happening in the park.  They really didn't do that great of a job showing you how serious it was.  People did come from off the island to help.  It just never seemed that important.  Seems to me that there should have been hundreds of military arriving.  They should have put more emphasis on the danger and the need for help.

In the end, I am glad I saw this movie.  It was entertaining.  Good acting and great graphics.  But I am not sure if I would buy this or not.  The story just seems to be lacking some stuff.  No build up.  No planning.  Not showing how bad things were and could get.  I would actually give this a 3.8 out of 5.  I just rounded it up.",1436313600,,3406,4.102290076335878

I heard 3 years ago about the making of Jurassic World and my heart jumped for joy!! The wait for this movie felt like a life time but it was totally worth it! I I was worried at first that the movie world not live up to my expectations because Dr. Grant would not be in it, but put those thoughts out of you mind, because Chris Pratt has made up for it!! Also the special effects on the dinosaurs took my breath away, I'm a huge dinosaur nerd and I was in awe at it all <3

Special effects were of the same or better quality than the other movies in the series.  It is an exciting adventure that keeps you on the edge of your seat - the entire time.

I'd have to say that the notion of taking the 'Jurassic Park' concept and making into an amusement park is pretty brilliant - I especially loved how the Mosasaurus came up and chomped down on the Great White Shark!  Sure, in the end, you knew that the primary characters would survive, and in fact, the ending was very reminiscent of the other three movies; but if you just take this for what it is - pure entertainment - then this won't matter.

6696899,5,B00NYC65M8,"To my eyes, the 3-D technology is quite seamless in this picture, and it's nothing short of the fun that a good summer adventure movie should be. I am not a big supporter of CGI abundance (although I realize we live in an age when it's going to be used often and without restraint), and yet the computer work done here is nothing short of sensational. I also saw ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" (which at times appeared to be a great blur across the eyes), but it was in no way as seamless and as right as this movie. I suppose we should credit director Colin Trevorrow (interesting name, this one) for guiding the summer theme park and thriller movie back to its roots as a cliffhanger serial.
Now, don't get me wrong, this is not a perfect picture, but it's not supposed to be really--some of the dialogue is corny (or just plain unnecessary), some of the characters are wasted, and some of the plot is a bit silly as it should be (I mean, no one would reopen Hammond's park project without thinking that SOMETHING has to go wrong, but if you are caught up in that logic I suppose you are no movie fan of any stripe). Even when the silly Indominus Rex character broke out (sorry for the spoiler!), I wanted to get up out of my chair, throw my popcorn off my lap, and stand up and applaud right there in the theater. Why? Because finally a movie has come along that understands the perimeters of the cinematic medium's scope. Not everyone likes dinosaurs (and there are some poor souls who find this picture ""scary"" or something), but if you do love movies you are obligated to witness the splendid action and thrills of ""Jurassic World"" in a theater. I saw it in IMAX 3-D and I'm still awed and amazed. And mind you, the original ""Jurassic Park"" was not perfect. I could see the CGI carpentry in the early dinosaur scenes in that movie. And it took far too long to get into the action. And it was softened in many ways, especially the scenes of death and violence. ""Jurassic World"" isn't overly gory, and it moves a little too quickly at times, but it raises the level of violence (some scenes of which I suspect had to be trimmed for the PG-13) so as to actually give dino fans more of the bloodthirsty action that they (and I myself) crave. Great raptor scenes in this picture, and that alone makes it more fun than most other pictures this year. Most movies try to pay attention to the niceties of plot, story, and thematic nuances, but ""Jurassic World"" goes right for the jugular and it doesn't take too long to get into the exciting parts, and then it just goes up from there. And, most importantly, there is a great dino fight at the end of this picture that more than makes up for the recent ""Godzilla"" movie travesty (what a dark and depressing picture that one was), a fight that restores the action to such outlandish adventure pictures as this one. It goes over the top because it has to. And sure, it is juvenile and it is yet another installment in a familiar series...but it's also a great deal of fun, something that sadly cannot be said for so many other pictures that just try to damned hard and end up nowhere in the end. Personally, I enjoy smaller scale pictures (and lower-budget ones) than these major Hollywood effects fests, but in this case I have to give credit where credit is due, so I'm putting out the word that ""Jurassic World"" is one ride worth taking. I still am not convinced that producers understand exactly what the 3-D format is capable of, but this is a smart use of CGI and I enjoyed it.
Chris Pratt is convincing as the masculine Indiana Jones-type character, and Bryce Dallas Howard (Ron's daughter) is cute and tough minded as the slowly turning executive who soon realizes that her dream of working at the ultimate theme park has become a major financial and public nightmare. I hate reading reviews about this picture in which people are squawking about the scientific inaccuracies and boohooing about the body count. This is clearly not the movie for THEM. But if it's one for you, see it, feel it, hear it, and enjoy it in IMAX 3-D before it's gone!
Fun cinematography, too, by the great John Schwartzman. A+",1435708800,2,4146,4.456578947368421
6696900,4,B00NYC65M8,"It sure is a great time to be a fan of films like this. I didn't expect much from Jurassic World, certainly not for it to be on par with the original masterpiece. All I hoped for was a fun sci-fi movie with dinosaur action. Jurassic World advertised itself to be that and it was just that. The dinosaurs made this movie.  Fan favorites such as the T-Rex and Raptors return and they RULE, it was awesome seeing them again as great as ever. The new hybrid creature Indominus Rex, which serves as the main driving point of the plot, is certainly a sight to behold. The last 20 to 30 minutes of this epic dino movie brought me back to my younger days, certainly one of the most satisfying final acts in a film such as this. I felt I got my money's worth off that alone. The story and script... yes it is cliched, the characters (aside from Chris Pratt's and Bryce Dallas Howard's character) are nothing special, and there are some downright ridiculous things that happen (for example.. POTENTIAL SPOILER AHEAD>>.... the park has a glass orb ride that lets you roam freely around potentially dangerous dinosaurs.... with no safety restrictions at all... really?... END POTENTIAL SPOILER)

But anyway, I felt the story and script was flawed and they could've been better... but they were good enough for a film like this. The visuals and sound tech used to fully realize this new movie are top notch. Though it is amazing to see that they aren't much of a big step up from the original in 1993... Makes you think how amazing the technical feat was for it back in the day... Wow.

To conclude, if you want to see a fun movie with satisfying dinosaur action above all else... Jurassic World is just that. You like movies like that go see it. If you're looking for something else it may be best to look elsewhere. I'm happy it is doing amazing at the box office, I love giant creature films like Jurassic Park, Godzilla, Pacific Rim, and King Kong. To see JW rake in this much money should definitely make the producers at Hollywood feel good about bringing back the giant creature genre. I'm definitely adding Jurassic World 2 to my list of highly anticipated future giant creature (or kaiju to some) films alongside Kong: Skull Island, Godzilla 2, and Pacific Rim 2.

6696904,5,B00NYC65M8,"i absolutely LOVE this movie!. i've seen it, now, in theaters three times. it is By Far the greatest Jurassic movie Ever. last week, i saw it in 4D and it was such a BLAST! it was like riding a roller coaster while having a theater movie screen in front of you the whole time. i definitely recommend going to see this movie. if you go to the Plaza 14 Cinemas in Oxnard, you can see it in 2D ( regular ) for $5 on Tuesdays and Sundays and you can see it for $14 in 4D. it is Definitely worth going to see it in 4D. i honestly believe that the pairing of Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard together as Co-Stars Totally surpasses the original Co-Stars of the other three Jurassic Park movies by a Long shot. i'm going to see the movie for a 4th time tomorrow and in 4D. So, now i'll be able to say that out of the 4 times of me seeing it: two will be regular and two will be in 4D. Now, if that doesn't say how good the movie is, i don't know what will lol. Also, another reason why i really, really enjoy this movie so much is that there are a lot more dinosaurs in it per screen time than the other movies. For example, in the first Jurassic Park, the only time you get to see Triceratops is one sick on  the ground whereas in this one, you actually get to see them happy and healthy and running around which, to me, helps give a deeper appreciation of just how perfectly created these dinosaurs were. When dinosaurs were alive, for real ( about 6 to 10,000 years ago ) they were marvels of creation and really, they still are, despite not being alive anymore. Bottom Line: Go See This Movie while it's still in theaters.

Update: i found out the release date for this movie. Target has a release date of October 13th of this year for the DVD to come out. Also, today i'm going to the theater to see it for the 7th time lol. i've also seen it three times on youtube because if you search for the right video, you can find the whole movie to watch. grant it: it's usually not the greatest video as far as picture quality but, still, it is possible to watch Jurassic World in its entirety on youtube. so, if you count that, then today will be my 10th time overall of seeing the movie lol Today is the last day you can see it at Plaza 14 Cinemas for 5 dollars. Tomorrow is the last day at regular price of 10 dollars and then it moves on to Century 16 Theater in Ventura. So, the movie will have been in Plaza 14 for about 5 weeks. That means this movie is SUPER popular because A Lot of people have gone to see it in order for it to stay showing for that long. if anyone wants to chat about this movie, just leave me a comment and i'll get back to you when i can.",1435536000,,2661,4.0283553875236295

I totally get the sexist comments too. Most importantly, DON'T waste an extra 10 bucks on 3D. There was only one actual 3D moment and it was fleeting. A total waste. Hats of to John Cameron for being just about the only director who knows how to make it work (Ang Lee gets a B+). The Regal Theaters promo was awesome and shows that 3D does work! Sadly, with HD, all of the model helicopters looked just that...toys. The story was so old and the real truth is that it didn't even come remotely close to the original Jurassic Park, which then and now is terrifying and awesome. Quotable lines and all: ""Must go faster!!"" when the etching on the rear view mirror says ""objects in mirror are closer than they appear!"" I screamed once or twice in World but it wasn't scary and every other 'scary bit' was so staged that you knew exactly what was coming.

6696906,4,B00NYC65M8,"A whole new frontier has opened up. We have our first genetically modified hybrid. Twenty-two years after the Jurassic Park tragedy the bugs have been worked out and the park has finally opened. Things are going great until attendance begins to drop. Wanting to make things exciting again the geneticists have created a new type of dinosaur. Once again the lesson of 22 years ago is forgotten, man shouldnt tamper with nature. I have been a huge fan of this series since I saw the first one in theaters. They are movies that are exciting to watch over and over. This one is no exception. The story of this one is almost secondary to the action, but it works. The movie is tense and exciting the entire time. Nothing is more exciting than seeing dinosaurs interacting with people and it really makes me want to visit a park like thisas long as the events that take place are different. If I had to knock the movie for anything it would be the same problem I had with the Star Wars prequels and Maleficent. When you watch the original movies Darth Vader and Maleficent are evil and scary but the new ones humanize them and make you look at them in a different light, this takes away from the originals for me. The same thing occurs in this movie in regards to some dinosaurs. That however is a very minor complaint and isn't worth skipping this over. Overall, a rare sequel that has a ton of hype behind it that isn't a total disappointment. I really enjoyed this. I give this an A-.",1435536000,,1481,4.448529411764706
6696907,4,B00NYC65M8,"The first question people ask me when they find out I saw Jurassic World is whether or not it was better than the original. In my opinion, Jurassic World isn't better than the other movies in the series, but it stands on its own pretty well and was just as much fun to watch as the others. I saw the movie two days in a row and can acknowledge that there are some plot issues. While the plot wasn't as tight as some of the previous ones, this movie was certainly just as entertaining to me.

In this movie, Jurassic World is a successful theme park on Isla Nublar, the site of the original Jurassic Park. In order to continually attract visitors, the theme park comes up with new attractions every couple of years. The latest attraction is a genetically modified dinosaur called Indominus Rex, which was created to be bigger and badder and scarier than T Rex.

The only character from any of the previous movies in the series to reprise his role in this movie is BD Wong as Dr. Henry Wu, the scientist who created the Indominus Rex. The new cast includes Zack (Nick Robinson) and Gray (Ty Simpkins), two kids taking a vacation to Jurassic World to visit their aunt Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), the park operations manager. Chris Pratt plays Owen Grady, the trainer of 4 velociraptors who think Pratt is their alpha (this comes into play later in the movie).  Rounding out the cast is Vincent D'Onofrio as Vic, the security head, Jake Johnson and Lauren Lapkus as control room employees, and Irrfan Khan as Simon Misrani, the owner of the park. Misrani wants Owen to evaluate Indominus' enclosure to see if he sees any safety issues that everyone else is overlooking. The action of this movie kicks off (and never stops) when Indominus escapes her cage and begins to run rampant on the island.

This movie was full of action and so much fun to watch. I rewatched Jurassic Park about a year ago when they re-released it in theaters and I was impressed by how decent the dinosaurs and special effects were, even 20 years later, but I wondered at that time what the dinosaurs could look like in today's movie-making world. World obviously answered that question for me. Not only were the dinosaurs pretty amazing, but the island and entire theme park were visually pleasing as well. The futuristic elements of the theme park were pretty fun to see.  There was also a fun, nostalgic nod to the first movie when they come across the original park, although I wish the original park would've been a bit more recognizable.

Overall, the movie was incredibly fun and I absolutely loved it. I loved the choice of casting Chris Pratt as the male lead, I found Jake Johnson to add some great moments of comic relief, and I really enjoyed Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins as the two kids in this movie. There were some ridiculous parts of the plot (one of them being the fact that Claire wears heels throughout the ENTIRE movie, while trekking through the woods and running from dinosaurs). There was also a weird subplot I didn't care for because it didn't seem fleshed out enough that involved Vic wanting to use dinosaurs as weapons of war. However, I didn't go into this movie expecting total realism. I wanted a fun, sci-fi escape with some cool-looking dinosaurs and some great action, and that's exactly what I got. I saw this movie two days in a row, and the action and excitement continued to hold up  (and even the weak plot points were fun to watch and amusing to make fun of on repeat viewings).",1435536000,3,3492,4.5776

JW is what you get when you use a worn out story, paired with a bad director, and very poor actors.

From other reviews, sadly most people are easily pleased, and entertained.  That is why we get crap out of Hollywood, because it is completely unnecessary to make a good, quality movie.",1435449600,5,536,4.489583333333333

Vincent D'Onofrio plays the human antagonist like Brian Dennehy and has a plan to adapt dinosaurs to military use. Bryce Dallas Howard provides our hero with a love interest because all the best films are love stories. You get the picture, dinosaurs running, flying, and swimming around killing each other and eating grandma who still has a few good years. In the beginning they hint that the audience wants action with bigger and badder dinosaurs, so they do that and sacrifice any aspect of building or creating memorable characters. I would have been happy just to see Jeff Goldblum, as an extra, getting eaten by a dinosaur.

The dinosaurs aren't any better than they were 20 years ago. The characters were bland. The film had a loose plot and I kept waiting for it to engage me. The kids weren't even as cute as the first film. Oh Yeah. Chris Pratt runs with dinosaurs, which is apparently a big deal.

- cute kids trying to cope with divorcing parents
- dismissive relatives in whom crisis awakens love
- handsome men and women who resist their attractions until peril gets the hormones flowing
- a hard-bitten, profit-driven corporate stooge turning her beautiful eyes away from humane concerns
- brilliant scientists running morally amok
- evil government operatives in secret cahoots with said brilliant scientists
- a quirky low-level employee who is the only one in the evil corporation with a moral compass
- and loads and loads of mayhem unleashed as all the above factors come together to put the cute kids in peril, the beautiful people in heat, the evildoers momentarily on top . . . with all being resolved in a 5-minute wrap-up where the kids are saved, the monsters are vanquished, the evil scientists and government operatives get their come-uppance, and the beautiful people ride off into the happy sunset together

And, by having it all, this movie has nothing.  It is really just a platform for showing off special effects with a script that is nothing more than a thin rewrite of dozens of scripts that preceded it to produce a genre of film that could be great but almost never rises about mediocrity.

Of course, it didn't help that the theater tried to cover its costs of licensing this movie by running 40 minutes of ads and previews before the feature attraction.

6696913,2,B00NYC65M8,"After viewing ""Jurassic World"" at the theatre, I believe it is nothing compared to the first three ""Jurassic Park"" films.  ""Jurassic World"" came across as a ridiculous monster movie.  In the film, Owen Grady (Actor Chris Pratt), Velociraptor expert & trainer confronts four Velociraptors in containment after saving a fellow park employee that has fallen from the catwalk above.  Pratt faces the Velociraptors, telling them ""Easy,"" and to ""Stay.""  He than tells the employee to leave as the Velociraptors obeys Pratt's commands as if they were trained, domesticated animals.  Such a situation in the Jurassic period is highly unlikely.  Velociraptors do not take commands; they are pack hunters and act instinctively in their natural environment.  Pratt would have been eaten alive because that is how these carnivorous creatures behaved over 65 million years ago, and that is what made the movie ridiculous.  It is unfortunate that authors, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver wrote such ridiculous story the inaccurately depicts dinosaurs that were once living and breathing creatures.",1435449600,7,1080,5.425149700598802
6696914,5,B00NYC65M8,Awesome movie!!,1435363200,,15,7.0
6696915,4,B00NYC65M8,"Positives are the excellent fast pacing, some grand scenes of chaos and destruction, fabulous locations, excellent simulation of the amusement park feel (except the guests at Jurassic World are the best groomed, best-dressed, healthiest looking amusement park guests you'll ever see - not one Affliction T-shirt, no tattooed necks, and nary a grotesque beer belly or giant butt in the whole park), top-notch special effects, and fine performances by the actors in the main roles.  Everything was of a quality befitting a mega-million dollar action movie.  And who doesn't love Bryce Howard, and if a scene with Chris Pratt on a motorcycle playing Alpha Dog to a herd of raptors doesn't get your attention, you may be unconscious.

The negatives are the ""no surprises here"" plotting we've come to expect from any Spielberg product, characters that struggle to be even two-dimensional, and the incessant, completely unrealistic roaring the dinosaurs constantly emit in what I am pretty sure is Spielberg's way of making them more exciting.  In Jurassic Park movies, the dinosaurs roar while attacking, which as anyone who has ever watched Discovery Channel or Animal Planet knows, real predators stalk and attack silently, saving the roars for challenging a rival, dominating smaller predators or mating rituals.  Lions, grizzly bears and tigers don't roar at their food, so why would a dinosaur?  These dinosaurs roar while running, attacking, flying - the mosasaur even roars underwater without a trace of an air bubble.

Plus, every dino is HUGE.  The mosasaur seems to be about two hundred feet long, which is many times larger than the real beasts were.  Ain't dinosaurs big enough without expanding them to grotesque sizes?  Don't get me started on the one-every-ten-seconds bass-driver thumps the T-Rex makes while walking - boom... boom...  boom... - except when it's on screen.

One of the more amusing Spielberg touches probably traces its roots back to ""Jaws"", when Spielberg had to write a script about a beast that could only hurt you when you were in the ocean.  All it took to not get eaten was stay on shore, so Spielberg had to keep victims in the water. This is also seen when the pterosaurs attack the crowd in the main street of the park.  As the pterosaurs swoop down, the panicking guests run up and down, back and forth, seemingly unaware they can duck into the numerous shops and attractions that line the sides of the street. There are a couple of cuts to other parts of the island, and each time we return to the pterosaur scene, the same people are still running back and forth out in the open, screaming their heads off.  In all the scenes where dinos attack park guests en masse, the same thing occurs.  This poor escape strategy keeps the streets full of screaming victims - by intent, of course, since a scene of monsters attacking a rapidly dwindling crown would quickly turn into a scene of dinos wandering around on deserted areas hopelessly looking for someone to eat, and would fail to excite.  But you just have to know real people would have known to head to cover, not just run up and down the same street out in the open over and over so we can see them get eaten.

It's a fine fun summer movie, so bring a few bucks for popcorn and Raisinets, but leave your brain at home - you won't be needing it during this one.",1435363200,2,3353,4.791666666666667

Once you see this movie, you will notice this set is missing the raptor. Even to the end of the fight scene, the raptor was integral to the outcome.",1435363200,10,478,4.085106382978723

Less detailed graphic violence (not much blood, people mostly just dissapear) and less language than the original which made me one happy mommy!  This film is action packet fun!

My 7 year old is ALL BOY and LOVES dinosuars.  Honestly, if he was 6 I probably would not have taken him.  Even without the blood the action can be a bit intense.

6696924,5,B00NYC65M8,"This fantastic film is a wonderfully made throwback blockbuster. Its simple, its fast, its fun. It hits familiar beats, but also offers a few surprises and twists along the way. And unlike other reboots/remakes/sequels that fail to honor the ideas and qualities that made the originals so good, this movie not only pays proper respect to the basic core of the franchise  rampaging dinosaurs! - it appropriately evolves the Jurassic Park premise for the modern era with its grander scale and scope.

I suppose the common clich&eacute;s of nonstop roller-coaster thrill ride combined with other hokey sayings invoking popcorn and summer are all applicable here, but this film is not afraid to utilize those old-fashioned building blocks from a simpler era of Hollywood past, as everything is skillfully designed and executed for maximum entertainment. The characters are straightforward and clean, without convoluted back stories and/or needlessly dark edges. The children actors are not insufferably cute or goody-goody. The film deftly mixes sly touches from all genres, so that while it is ostensibly an action/adventure, its also light sci-fi/fantasy with sly touches of romance, comedy, and suspense/horror for both kids and adults. And it certainly delivers of the simple sequel philosophy of bigger, better and more.

One of the key elements of the films success is its perfectly realized and immersive world. Far better than even the first film, this one shows what a fully operational resort for such animals would truly look like. From holographic presentations to waiting in line for the rides as a guest, the film even goes behind the scenes of the actual experience to give viewers VIP-access to the functionality: from the R&D labs and upper executives, down through the trainers, marketing and security. So even the product placement helps to reinforce the v&eacute;rit&eacute; of the settings, since of course giant mega-brands would be decorating the different cars, food and shops with their gratuitous ads. This careful attention to detail makes the film even more lifelike and enjoyable, even on a subconscious level.

The film is unabashedly about spectacle, with beautiful technology and nature from its set design up through the magnificent creature FX, which even uses some old-fashioned puppetry in a few scenes. Lots of dinosaurs was all that was ever really needed here, but after including every one imaginable and then inventing more to toss into the mix, the filmmakers even added a plethora of wild vehicles and heavy weaponry to build some wonderfully chaotic free-for-all fights with relentless attacks, battles and chases between man and beast. The action and plot constantly build in scope and intensity to explode in a wild finale that delivers upon everything one could ever want to see at a real zoo filled with dinosaurs. The events of the film are a perfect representation of taking the ultimate bonkers trip to that fantasy world from the safety of make-believe.

While modern films often feel the need to subvert such simplicity by adding some grim complexity, or theyll got out of their way to connect the lone story to a bigger universe or franchise, this movie shows that delivering well on familiar elements is not unwelcome, and can even be quite refreshing. Perhaps more cynical or jaded filmgoers can complain about the corny setup and predictable plotting, but then theyd be blind to the awesome visual pyrotechnics of a theme park filled with out-of-control dinosaurs.",1435276800,3,3517,5.2176991150442475

Jurassic world has saved the franchise. it officially the highest grossing film in the Jurassic park franchise. if that doesn't show that it went the right way i don't know what will. this is the best Jurassic park movie so far. keep up the good work universal.,1435190400,,571,4.777777777777778
6696926,3,B00NYC65M8,"Possessing neither the industrial significance nor the inherent majesty of the Spielberg original, it was always going to be a tall order for this modern revival to stack up. It's wise to do its own thing for the most part, though nudge-grin-wink references to the first film appear shamelessly (and, often, charmingly) around every corner. And while it's fun to point and smile at the familiar scraps of a 22-year-old film, at some point it feels like the new effort is too frightened of its own merits to cast them aside. At root, it's a simple mindless summer disaster movie with the spice of CGI dinosaurs thrown in where the earthquakes/volcanoes/tidal waves would usually go. Measured against that standard, it's still an awfully dumb bucket of over-familiar plot churn, but it feels more understandable and appropriate. Long gone are the delicate ruminations on nature, humanity and our impending role as technological gods, tossed in favor of more sizzle and fresh dino gimmicks. For all the trailer's promises that the new big bad is meaner, faster and - most importantly - smarter, it really doesn't seem to do all that much beyond stomping around the park and killing anything in sight. The new cast, helmed by Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard (who, impressively, manages to dash through jungle and mountain in a pair of stylish heels), doesn't seem much brighter. A fair enough way to kill a couple hours at the cinema, but be prepared for a healthy dose of eyeball-rolls and manufactured drama.",1435190400,5,1510,4.948818897637795

6696930,5,B00NYC65M8,"So I saw this movie twice on opening day, once in 2D, then in 3D and was surprised that (in my opinion) it has lived up to its hype. Yes, the movie has it's flaws, a few characters are two dimensional, the chemistry wasn't really there, could have used more animatronics but on a whole, I feel these flaws are extremely minor. There wasn't a moment when I was watching it either times where I was bored or found myself distracted, I was always immersed in the stunning scenes.

I've always been a massive fan of the Jurassic Park movies, since I was only a toddler and they have always remained my favourite movies. I was somewhat scared that this movie would fail to live up to my expectations but the constant nostalgia provoking moments within this movie brought the inner child out in me, even just the small things such as seeing Ian Malcolms book pop up a few times, or the Jurassic Park t-shirt.

I really felt like the park was real, being able to see the attractions but best of all, we got to finally have an emotional connection to the dinosaurs which I loved - the velociraptor pack were possibly my favourite characters - I felt more of a connection to them than say, Bryce Dallas Howards character. Bringing back Rexie from the original Jurassic Park book/movie was also a nice touch, however I feel it's a tad unrealistic, somewhat cruel that the poor thing would have been on that island, free, only to be recaptured and put back into an attraction 20 years later.

This gift set is perfect for any Jurassic Park/Jurassic World fans, the Indominous Rex and Tyrannosaurus Rex statues are gorgeous and you have all medias covered, however I would suggest just watching it in 2D - the 3D effects of the movie are extremely gimmicky, lacked potential but this again, is only a minor downfall.
I can't wait to show this movie to my nephew in the comfort of my own home!",1435104000,3,1880,4.507331378299121
6696931,4,B00NYC65M8,"Surprisingly good. Did not disappoint, I was very satisfied with this film's outcome.  BUT the human characters do fall a little flat.

Warning: JW is similar to the first JP, but unlike the very first masterpiece book & movie there is little scientific or intellectual insight into JW, thus basically in a nutshell the movie is a big special effects summer time monster fest.

After seeing the first previews & hearing they were making yet another in this franchise I had been concerned that the plot line seemed way over the top & even border line ridiculous. But how ever I was relieved that they made the story some what believable & added I believe positively to the theme & ideologies expressed in the very first book / movie by both the late Dr. Crichton & Steven Spielberg.

The main question must be asked, why do we as human beings love dinosaurs as much as we do? Especially children? The only answer I can give is that dinosaurs were indeed some of the most remarkable and spectacular creatures to ever walk this Earth, their power & intensity matched few to none. Seeing them brought to life so well in the first JP with modern special effects had made movie history, & today in the 2010's we see that CGI technology enhanced even more so. But one critique I will give is we see less of the original animatronics & puppet motion made perfectly by the team at ILM & the late Phil Tibbit. These creatures today are all CGI.

Unlike the other dreadful sequels, the first movie-book is respected well in ""JW"", we see clearly the spirit of the John Hammond character & the underlining deep debate between him and Jeff Goldblum's Dr. Malcolm is ultimately brought up over again on a much grander scale because this movie has a lot more dinosaurs in it, with a theme park three times larger then the original (the debate is not spoken of in the movie but for true fans who pay attention the underlining element of Jeff Goldblum's warnings are there). We as fans see shadowy ghosts & are hinted at imagry from the original film we all love. It was touching emotionally as a fan seeing the movie makers place a picture of the late Michael Crichton in the background during the movie.

Plot: Two youthful boys are sent on a super Christmas time vacation down to the first island, Isla Nubar, which has been rebuilt & recreated into a super ""Disneyworld""-""Seaworld"" on steroids titled ""Jurassic World"". None of the original problems occur on this super technological marvel park, and ultra laboratory where genetic engineering technology has advanced light years since the 90's.

Actor Chris Pratt plays a US Sailor who is hired as a professional animal trainer for this super park. His character has made the break through in successfully communicating & training wild dinosaurs. He understands the scientific nature of these powerful creatures more then the experts do, & he shows the animals respect. The only character from the original 90's book-movie is Dr. Wu, we learn that Hammond has just died (as did the real actor) recently and has placed a billionaire from India in charge of his company. Dr. Wu is now the top scientist in the company, & leads the world in cloning and genetic engineering, but there is a dark and sinister plot afoot on the island. A new hidden conspiracy regarding Dr. Wu's work that has placed ""JW"" & all of the guests and employees at serious risk.

We have all of the dinosaur heroes & villains we loved from JP one, & a few new creatures that were never featured in the first or second film, but were in this one such as the giant Brontosaurus.

Not to give too much of the movie away but I was satisfied unlike the first couple of movies that they finally were realistic in this film where the heroes this time are packing some serious heat, with military grade fire power when they have to take on history's most deadly predators (& a new one monster created by the evil schemes of humankind that defy mother nature's will). These heroes use guns, and I was happy to see that.
Some plot holes do exist in the movie: Like ""Why would the Pterodactyls suddenly just attack people just because they are free from the avory? And why would they swarm people all at once? Like birds one would think they would fly all over the place, but not purposely attack anyone especially if they have eaten all ready.

Another element I didn't really like was how easily the Raptors kept changing sides.

Over all I give this movie an A-/B+ with thumbs up, even if it is still not as good as the first classic JP.",1435104000,6,4536,4.587654320987654
6696932,5,B00NYC65M8,"this movie blockbuster delivers far above the expected hype!!! Jurassic park is no more and now the new Masrani Corporation has taken it over and turned it into Jurassic World. some of the remnants from the other Jurassic park movies can be seen in parts of this movie which was a real treat. the Misrani corp needs to wow people because they became tired of dinosaurs so they make a hybrid dino (the Indominus Rex) which becomes a big mistake. I am not going to spoil the movie so that is enough for that subject.

the story is very familiar to the first Jurassic park as Claire, the busy park operations manager, is visited by her two nieces and is not spending much time with them as they wonder around the park. then a catastrophe happens and everyone runs for their life's because of the newly created dino. it is everything you would expect from one of the Jurrassic Movies and then some more.

the dinos in this movie are so realistic I felt like I was actually watching real dinosaurs. the acting is phenomenal and the movie was just an all around success. this is a must see for anyone.

the 3d is really awesome and I would suggest it for anyone above the age of 4 as my 2 and 4 year old did not care for it but my 6 year old loved it.",1435104000,,1245,4.244725738396625

This latest installment was just a huge noisy mound of CG. If you liked the intense tangible animatronic closeups of the T-Rex in the original get ready to be disappointed. Never once does the movie generate any claustrophobic biting scares or make you feel as if the dinosaurs are a real tangible threat. The characters are completely forgettable even making Chris Pratt somehow boring to watch. The raptors have been turned into glorified hunting dogs that kill every once in a blue moon. The intelligence they once exhibited is non-existent. And the main villain Indominus Rex spends most of the movie off-screen. His mouth is more the focal point of his scenes. So ultimately, just an airy daytime summer action junk movie. I'm not sure when they're going to realize Pterodactyls aren't scary. They don't even have teeth.",1435017600,14,992,4.841176470588235
6696936,3,B00NYC65M8,"How to make The Jurassic Cocktail:

Ingredients:
-Heavy Dilution of the first three films
-50ml of Chris Pratt
-20ml of a mustache-twirling Vincent D'Onofrio
-Sugary Spielberg-esque family bonding
-A Shot of Absurd Dino-Threat
-Beats by Dre
-0.002ml of a Tyrannosaurus Rex
-Human/Dino fodder
-Love Story Syrup

Best Served Lukewarm in an Embellished yet Familiar Glass:

Step 1) Start off with a base of the first movie, establishing children in familial dire straits as well as a main character who dislikes the idea of family, but throughout the course of the film will learn to appreciate and love family (aka the biggest box office draw). Keep the rim of your beverage sugary with moments of brotherly bonding throughout. The base should stay nice and predictable, with a few garnishes of newer dinosaurs as the only variant thus far.

Step 2) Shake things up a notch! Introduce the shot of an absurd big bad dinosaur to your drink in order to shake things up in a nonsensically excessive manner! Just make sure you buy the Deus ex Machina brand [the one with super intelligence, multi-linguistic, camouflage-able, etc etc]. Now splash some of The Lost World into it with mercenaries hunting the dinosaur, as well as a zesty pterodactyl garnish from the third film. Make sure you're shaking the cocktail throughout this process, as otherwise the drink will get dull fast.

Step 3) Strain into a Contrived Glass: Discard the hammy Vincent D'Onofrio at this point from your beverage; Include the adults/kids being chased by raptors as well as the raptors fighting the Rex in the entrance building. By this time your cocktail should resemble heavily Jurassic Park which is a good thing! Remember; we want to take NO RISKS when contriving this cocktail (think of how expensive those ingredients were). Time to start mixing the drink together; some parts, such as the velociraptors, T-rex, and Chris Pratt well blend nicely together. However the shot of big bad dinosaur will not mix well with the rest, but luckily the drink will be excessive enough that you'll stop caring about how mind numbing the Jurassic Cocktail is. Through various plot straining the cocktail will be finally done, with a nice sugary finish.

Best enjoyed while driving a Mercedez-Benz.",1434931200,4,2260,5.029411764705882
6696937,5,B00NYC65M8,Jurassic world is the best seqaul out there today i mean if your a fan of the Jurassic park movies this is a must see for you. Now this movie should be watched in 3D i mean it's awesome they way they used the 3D in it especially when i saw the 20 th anniversary 3D plus the fight scene at the end was something not seen in a film for a long time you'll see what i mean anyway i saw this film the first day during a early show and the parking lot was empty and when i came out it was packed full of cars and this film is so good it they said it made about a 1 billion dollars at the box office anyway forget about the lost world even though it's good to watch now and then but Jurassic park 3 is something that should be thrown out. Because it's not worth watching.,1434931200,,764,3.811320754716981

6696939,4,B00NYC65M8,"I  went into  this  movie  with  mild  expectations  lets  just say i was  cautiously  optimistic.  Lets  just  start  with  the  negatives  immediately,  there  is  in  my  opinion  way  to  much  going  on  plot  wise.  Family  drama  does  not  belong  in  a  jurassic  park  film  Subplot  number 1.  mom  and  dad  are  getting  divorced.  There  is  no  resolution to this subplot and it  is  mentioned  for  the  sake  of  making us  feel  sad  for  the  main  kids  in  the  film  and  it  is  forgotten  immediately  at  least  i  almost  did.  Sublot number 2. (  which  might  evolve  into  something  larger  in  the  future  sequals  we'll  just  have  to  wait  and  see)  we  should  militarize  the  dinosaurs. Which  didn't  so  much  bother  me  if  anything  i  kind  of  saw  potential  for it,  but  this  is  a  Jurassic  park  movie  stick  to  simplicity  please?  and  the  final  one  essential  being  a  story  arc  for  bryce  dallas  howard's character  she  is  a  workaholic  and  doesn't  want  kids  right  now  and  she  also  had  past  history  with  chris  pratt's  character  for  me  personally  this  movie  feels  really  unfocused through  most of  the entire  first  half.  The  characters  are  terrible  they  just  aren't  super memorable  they  come  more  as  stereotypes  i  honestly  thought  that  the  best  performances  came  from  Chris pratt  and  Judy  Greer  i thought  she  was really  great  but  honestly  most  of  the  characters  came  off  as  two demensional.

Now  the  Positives.  The movie  is  an  absolute  technical  marvel!  the  Cgi  is  incredible  to  look  at  everything  feels  like  it  has  real  physical  presence  to it.  The  movie  also  doesn't  waste  your  time  within  the  first  10  minutes  we  are  on  the  island,  it  just  really  nails  the  idea  of  jurassic  park  being  a  real  thing.  The  Indominus Rex  is  terrifying,  every  time  it  was  in  frame i  was  oh  crap  we're  screwed,  even  the  I rex's  first  scene  was  frightening,  i'm  not  talking  about  the  first  attack which  were  all  scary  i'm  speaking  of  the  scene  in  which  the  i rex  is  peaking  through  the  trees  and  all  you  see  is  it's  eye,  the  i  rex  scenes  are  so  good  they  are  almost  as  well  executed  as the  T Rex  intro  scene  in  the  original  film. This  film  also  did  a  really  great  job  of  nailing  the  horror  vibe  of  the  original film.  Overall  this  is  a  fun  film  not  a  great  film,  but  it  is  a  ton  of  fun  and  i  cannot  wait  for  it  to  come  on  Blu-ray 3D. See it!",1434931200,,2625,4.347619047619047
6696940,5,B00NYC65M8,"Jurassic World is a great addition to the Jurassic set and perfect summer fun! It will remind you of the heart and humor of the first film and it is full of excitement with great new dinosaurs and absolutely jaw-dropping special effects (see if you don't jump in your seat to 'avoid' them!). Chris Pratt will get a lot of the attention, and he is perfectly cast and does a tremendous job but, he's also surrounded by a stellar supporting cast, without which it wouldn't have been half the movie it is.

If you want to see an excessive CGI spectacle, and pony up the thirteen plus dollars for it, this is the flick for you.  If you demand solid acting, a plausible plot, or any form of unpredictability, then avoid this like a T-Rex in heat.  And this is coming from the quintessential Pratt fanboy who firmly believes Star-Lord needs to keep this cinematic faux pas-asaurus off his resume.  This story doesn't jump the shark it leaps over the plesiosaurus like Superman on Meth.  And, to think, they were worried that a human/dino hybrid story would be a silly plotline, at least that would have been more original and believable.  All of the authenticity of character development, wide-eyed wonder, and refreshing creativity from the first installment has been completely diluted as this dino dynasty unremarkably continues.  I mean at this point, someone has to realize making prehistoric pups is a really bad idea, right!  To believe that level of ignorance is possible, let alone plausible, requires any common sense to become quickly extinct.  However, the movie is making millions, so it is obvious to me that sadly there is a legitimate public appetite for mounds of dino dung as long as it is computer generated and hyped up enough.  For the love of all that is holy, let this franchise go the way of the dinosaurs it continually disgraces.",1434931200,16,1460,4.780876494023905
6696942,4,B00NYC65M8,"It's not without it's flaws but it's sure better than the first two sequels. I saw a user complaining about the lack of realism. I'm thinking this must be the first Jurassic sequel they've watched because quite frankly it was overall more believable than it's predecessors.

That said you have to suspend your disbelief to sit through this. Just put your analyzing brain on hold and enjoy the ride. It is a beautiful sweeping CGI blockbuster. Perhaps the most visually stunning movie since Avatar. I do recommend seeing the 3D version (something I rarely advise). The raptors are back with an unexpected twist plus there are some new dinosaurs to meet.

The plot itself isn't that far off the beaten path from Jurassic Park so don't look for a lot of originality there. It's basically a neat idea being exploited by the ambitious with devastating results...again. the exact players and motivations have of course changed.

Gripes:

I didn't like Howard as Clair but that may be more I just didn't like Claire. I just found her... almost robotic? someone commented it's highly unrealistic for Claire to have even held her position at the park. I disagree it's not that uncommon for people to be placed in positions they aren't suited for that's why businesses don't always do well and sometimes have major crisis as in this film.

I also had a hard time stomaching the interactions between Claire and Owen. I will simple say it's cliche'd from start to finish.

I went to see this wanting to see a visual stunner with some cool dinosaurs and a plot that didn't put me straight to sleep. JW delivered and I will be buying it when it's released (it will sound great on the surround sound).

Note: I watched Jurassic Park again after seeing this and found it a bit hard to sit through. It really shows it's age when put up against JW. It still has a better story line though and as a whole better acting.",1434931200,,1900,4.636904761904762

6696944,2,B00NYC65M8,"I tend to agree with some the lower raters. The redhead running the place had no business there what so ever. In fact Chris Pratt should have been running the place instead with his understanding of the creatures. Made no sense a billionaire (with what apparently John Hammond left to him) (The island of dinosaurs) would put a daft young businessmen manager there to make such drastic decisions regarding the park, the animals when she had clearly no understanding of what she was doing, and then there's the mad scientist creating what ever the hell he wants to in the lab and no one seems to know what he doing ??!1  Right !!
The CGI was goo, Pratt did good, the rest of the story was dribble any 6th grader could have written. I do see a number of people that loved the moved, having spoken to my teen daughters and their friends, they also loved the movie, This movie was obviosly not made for anyone thats held a job with any responsibility or anyone with some kind of education.
This was definitely made for the teenagers and kids, their the only ones that don't have a clue how ridiculous the circumstances and scenerios are.
Listen, we all know its a fantasy movie, that's fine I love fantasy movies, but for God sakes, if we're going to be pretending that dinosaurs are running wild on this island amusement park, at least make the story, plot and characters as close to real life as possible.",1434931200,5,1403,4.5236220472440944

6696946,3,B00NYC65M8,"I would target 3.5 stars if that were possible. It was overall an enjoyable movie for me, but nowhere near the incredible-ness of the first film.

I should say it was better than i expected it to be, the trailer looked like typical hollywood junk, but the more-than-decent reviews came out and i forked over the 18.50 (seriously, 14.5 regular in NYC now, and the wife wanted 3d, and i was out of costco tickets)

Spoliers: i will red flag when i go into spoilers.
I'll be pretty in depth, if you're looking for a short review, sorry, not this one!

The premise is that 20some years after the first film this park has been opened and everything is peachy. Except that it's become a caricature of itself and marketing. They apparently aren't doing well enough for the investors and need to keep raising the bar. The new bar is full on genetic manipulation to create a superbeast (RZ reference). As can be expected, something goes wrong. At this point im on board and OK with that plot.

****
SPOILER PARAGRAPH:
But all the pseudo-science and 'logic' from the characters is really just silly. Setting aside that we're watching a movie about human created dinosaurs, there are some things the characters do which makes zero sense.  They are training raptors. Why? apparently military reasons. The lead dude of which is so super excited when he sees chris pratt prevent the raptors from making a meal out of an intern. But seriously: what we see are barely controlled raptors that are an inch from tearing apart their own trainer. But to the eyes of the military dude, they're totally under control and should be used immediately as a field test to take down the newly escaped superbeast dino. Wait.. what??? Yea, that's the solution the military guy forces on them after the first weak attempts at containing it fail: send a team along with 4 raptors to take down the equivalent of a t-rex with huge arms and claws. Fight fire with a couple match sticks? yea i can't get on board with that suspense of disbelief.
****
END SPOILER

Seeing the raptors hunting along with chris pratt in the trailer was cool, and in the film the dynamic between him and the raptors was probably the most believable relationship the film had.

The sub plots are also rather poor. You have the two brothers wandering around, looking at girls, doing things they're not supposed to be doing, etc... I get it, we needed some kids to get in trouble, but wasting screen time with them waiting in line and looking at girls?

Then we have the love banter between the two leads, and it would be fine if they didn't stretch it. Let's make a direct comparison: in the first film J1: a lot of the subplot chatting happens early in the film while the characters are traveling, in the helicopter, in the jeeps, etc... Action is occurring during the idle chats, we're leading towards something going to happen, it's active, it's dynamic. In JW, it;s idle, for instance: one character goes to the other's bungalow to ask for his help, and much of their non plot related love chatting is completely removed in every way from anything we care about. They're just standing around.  It may not seem like a big difference, but it's the little things that separate the OK movies from the good movies.

The comic relief was probably the most well constructed thing about the film, the control room guy gets most of the gold for this and it is well played.

One of the things i appreciated the most were the elements of J1 brought back, and i won't spoil any for you, but they are on the same island (but a different area) and you can imagine things left behind from J1 and the possibility of characters in this film coming across them.

***
SPOILER PARAGRAPHS:
I should mention i'm a film production person, and i see details which the average person probably doesn't. It's these details though which make or break moments in a film. Let's draw again a comparison to J1: one of the most iconic moments is the slow beat of the walking t-rex. As the raptors are failing to take down the superbeast in the climax of the JW, the girl goes to open 'paddock 9', we all sense what is coming, and im relieved they didn't just out and say let's go get the t-rex. (i HATE when films spoon feed) But the opportunity they had to bring back to life that J1 magic was lost on them. The door opens and t-rex right away is thump thump thumping right towards her. no slow buildup. though it was absolutely awesome to see, the glow of the flare in the t-rex's eye when it appears. Compare those two scenes between movies of the t-rex appearing, and JW loses by a furlong. They also had the t-rex bust in all badass through some dino skeleton to announce his presence to the crowd. i feel it would have been far more intense for her to slowly step in and roar a challenge at the superbeast.

The final insult: raptor saves the day. When the lead raptor gets tossed aside by superbeast, and we think he's done. The t-rex is being bested by superbeast and its looking very grim. NOW: let's pause a sec and go back to J1: it's the climax, they characters are cornered on all sides, by the raptors, brown stuff is about to hit the fan. The lead raptor lunges and BOOM: out of nowhere the t-rex snatches him and saves the day. Back to JW: t-rex is down, brown stuff about to hit the fan, what happens next? an over the top style dramatic head on shot of the lead raptor running in to save the day. cheesy-as-#&$!. It would have been 10 times the awesome if the superbeast was going for the kill stroke on t-rex, and out of nowhere the raptor lunges at it.  (i won't give it away but no the raptor doesn't single handedly take down superbeast)

Conclusion
I could get into a lot of nitpicking about more things that are a super stretch of reality, but that would be dissertation in length. Needless to say, i feel its stronger than either of the two sequels, but falls far short of the original. I feel there's a better movie in there, and some editing could weed out a number of issues. It's yet another film i wish to heck i could sit down with the director and empty my brain to them, as if they would consider the opinions of a no-name amazon reviewer.",1434931200,,6200,4.459841129744042

6696949,1,B00NYC65M8,"Horrible movie. It starts off fairly well, then turns into a comedy of errors. Bryce Dallas Howard almost ruins the entire movie with her terrible acting and ridiculously written character. It's clear she has no business running Jurassic World or even being an actress to begin with. Chris Pratt, Vincent D'onofrio and BD Wong are pretty much the best actors in a movie full of clowns, and even D'onofrio is starring in a role that honestly, he could have outright refused because the character could have been written out of the film and no one would have missed them, and it was just stupid to begin with. Chris Pratt's role in the movie doesn't make sense, seeing as he is trying to train and control raptors. D'onofrio's character wants Pratt to train the raptors for military purposes, but Pratt wants no part of it, which makes no sense because why is he there to begin with? Furthermore, Bryce's character and the park develop a new dinosaur but refuse to consult anyone professional, like Pratt, on how to handle it.

I would say that about 30 minutes in, the stupidity of this film just snowballs, one scene after the other to the point that most intelligent people should be shaking their heads and heading for the exits. It literally is one of those movies in which you just want to scream to the characters and tell them they are complete idiots. Several characters suffer bizarre and unwarranted deaths, like Zara infamously did, like, for instance, Sharif Khan's character and the two soldiers who survived Afghanistan and Iraq but then tragically crash to their doom minutes later with the billionaire after taking the joyride and dozens, possibly hundreds of tourists attacked by the pterodactyls, which will have you checking your phone to see if Spielberg initially considered making this R-rated, consulting with Eli Roth on upping the shock factor. What could have been preventable if Bryce's character had just evacuated the island immediately turned into a national tragedy and presumably a very profitable day for a lot of lawyers.

The person next to me in the theater and some friends of mine on social media all agreed with me about the utter stupidity of this movie, but for some reason, other people love this movie, which is just strange. I don't know, some people don't like to watch movies sober, that's the only thing that could explain it.

Save your money, if you've ever had any sort of responsibility in your life or managed a hot dog stand, you will not be able to stand this film. It's a joke. It's better made than the last two movies, but the writing is without a doubt, absolutely terrible, done by committee as well as toy companies.",1434844800,24,2675,4.773218142548596

It was so good I will be going back and watching it in 3D at least another couple times! Character development and plot were spot on. Well acted and true to the original.

6696952,4,B00NYC65M8,"Michael Crichton, who passed away in the fall of 2008, may not have realized the kind of goldmine he struck when he published his dinosaur novel ""Jurassic Park"" in 1990; but with director Steven Spielberg's help, that goldmine was open for business with the original 1993 film version, and then with its 1997 sequel THE LOST WORLD.  Due to Spielberg being heavily involved in making A.I.: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE in 2001, the third ""Jurassic Park"" film was left in the hands of director Joe Johnston, with Spielberg staying on as executive producer.  Incredibly enough, another fourteen years would pass until the move-going public got the fourth in the series, JURASSIC WORLD.

Twenty-two years after John Hammond's experiment at producing an innovative theme part with genetically-created dinosaurs on an island some 200 miles off of Costa Rica came crashing down with the dinosaurs consuming several people, now that same island, Isla Nublar, is now home to Jurassic World, a highly innovative theme park with bigger and better dinosaurs, and, hopefully, with greater controls.  One of the workers, an ex-Navy seaman (Chris Pratt), has become especially attuned to a number of the raptors in the park, and has managed to earn their trust.  At the same time, the park's principal supervisor (Bryce Dallas Howard) has been overseeing the creation of a super-dinosaur, made up of the DNA of the previous species of dinosaurs, including velociraptors, and tyrannosaurus rexes, that has guaranteed an up tick in revenue and park attendance.  But as with anything involving the technology used in creating creatures that have been extinct from the Earth's surface for sixty-five million years, soon everything turns upside down.  This doesn't stop the park's main security chief (Vincent D'Onofrio) from seeing a way to use these dinosaurs as a weapon of war, over the vehement objections of both Pratt and Howard, as well as one of the original scientists (B.D. Wong) from the original Jurassic Park.  Upping the ante still further are the fact that Howard's two nephews (Nick Robinson; Ty Simpkins) have come to the island to be with their aunt; instead, they find themselves having to behave like responsible adults in the most horrible way possible when the mayhem created by the ""super-dinosaur"" allows all the other species out of their enclosures.  When D'Onofrio's megalomaniacal ambitions result in his death, it is up to Pratt and Howard to destroy the super dinosaur with all the weapons at their disposal.

As with JURASSIC PARK III, Spielberg's involvement in directing another film (in this case the Cold War drama BRIDGE OF SPIES) led him to taking the role of executive producer, allowing Colin Treverrow, whose only feature film credit before this was the romantic comedy drama SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED in 2012, to direct it.  With help from co-writers Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, and Derek Connally, however, Treverrow managed to cobble together elements of the first three films into a coherent, if not necessarily letter-perfect, science fiction/suspense thriller that, in some interesting twists, pays homage not only two its three predecessors, but also to Spielberg's 1975 classic JAWS (as the super-dinosaur eats a Great White shark to the amazement of the 20,000+ people in attendance), and to Alfred Hitchcock's 1963 horror classic THE BIRDS (as the avian dinosaurs attack the park visitors from the air with sometimes bloody results).

It is not a mark against either the film or Treverrow to say that the film misses the verve and panache of the first two movies that were directed by Spielberg in masterful fashion, though one sometimes wishes he had concentrated as much on characters as he did on the mayhem.  Nevertheless, Pratt (ZERO DARK THIRTY; GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY) and Howard (LADY IN THE WATER) do really good turns as a pair, despite the rather clichd bickering they do at the start; and Robinson and Simpkins make for as appealing a pair of kids as Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards did in Spielberg's original.  Michael Giacchino's score is impressive as well, and he wisely interpolates John Williams' themes from Spielberg's first two films while also incorporating some of his own ideas.

The final verdict when it comes to JURASSIC WORLD is that, despite its tendency to fall into predictability in terms of the dinosaur attacks and some cardboard characters, it is far better than most summer CGI film fare, with enough Spielberg influence to keep it from being just another blockbuster.",1434844800,2,4531,5.145578231292517
6696953,2,B00NYC65M8,"If the intention of the filmmakers behind Jurassic World was to create a film that would remind viewers of how great the original Jurassic Park movie was, theyve certainly achieved that goal, but not in the way they had intended. For Jurassic World is the worst film in the franchise, making the previous two efforts (The Lost World: Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park III) look like Citizen Kane in comparison.

Set 22 years after the original film, Jurassic World takes the viewer back to Isla Nublar, where a fully-functioning dinosaur theme park, as originally imagined by John Hammond, with over 20,000 visitors coming to the site per day. However, attendance to the park is steadily declining, and fascination with the attractions at the park is beginning to fade. So, to spark interest, the scientists behind cloning the dinosaurs created a brand new attraction: Indominus Rex, a genetically-altered hybrid. However, as things usually go in these movies, the best laid plans of men, no matter how stupid they are, fail miserably. Indominus Rex escapes from his paddock, and goes on the rampage. To make matters worse, the person running the park, Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) has visiting nephews who find themselves lost in the park after nearly being killed by Indominus, and asks Owen, a former Navy man (Chris Pratt), to help find them. This man also goes on the hunt for the Indominus with several military personnel from InGen, and help coming from four Velociraptors that he personally trained himself.

If all this sounds like the plot of a SyFy original movie, it certainly has that feel to it. The script itself is so full of clichs, silly moments, and over-the-top antics as to render the film nearly unwatchable. Moments that should inspire fear or excitement, such as the fight between the Indominus and the T-Rex, or the chase after the Indominus with the Raptotrs, fall flat on their faces, and come off as either silly, or just completely uninteresting. Director Colin Treverrow and his crew do nothing to bring a sense of fear, wonder, or even originality to the table, instead making a movie that would have been great if it had been released in 1993.

The cast is given little to do, and the performances are all over the map. Chris Pratt, fresh off the success of the fantastic Guardians of the Galaxy film, gives the films best performance, bringing his wit and humor to the forefront on occasion. However, as great as Pratt is, even hes given little to do but argue, and occasionally perform an action stunt of some kind. Bryce Dallas Howard gives one of her weakest performances as Claire. Its obvious that shes doing her best with the script given to her, but even she cannot do great with something so bland and uninteresting. And of course, theres Vincent DOnofrio as the former military man who wants to use Raptors in combat. His performance is so over-the-top as to be laughable. As good as DOnofrio is, this ranks amongst his worst performances. The rest of the supporting cast is hit-or-miss. But, given that they're not given much to work with, they do what they can.

Now, the film isn't without some merit. The CG work is the best done for the franchise so far, making these dinosaurs even more realistic looking than ever. And the scene where Claire and Owen come across Brachiosaurus that have been killed by Indominus, which he just did for sport, is a powerful moment. And of course, the few times that Michael Giacchinos score incorporates the wonderful themes created by John Williams back in 1993 are welcomed reminders of a film that was truly great, making the viewer long for that film even more so.

In closing, Jurassic World is not the worst film ever made, but is definitely the worst film in the Jurassic Park franchise. The great visual effects cannot make up for the weak script, and hit-or-miss performances and silly and uninspired action sequences. If you're looking for a great summer blockbuster, or a great sequel to the 1993 classic, then this isn't the film for you.

6696954,5,B00NYC65M8,"Finally! I've waited too long for a definitive sequel to the first film. As much as I enjoyed the Lost World and JP3, this one actually holds to true the original way Jurassic Park needed to be continued. I'm hoping Colin Trevorrow considers directing the sequel to Jurassic World, even though I heard he may not in the future. Either way, this is an amazing Jurassic sequel! This movie is loaded with plenty of references and nostalgia from the first movie. Plus, for anyone that remembers the story from the original book, you'll find this sequel much darker and serious. Two thumbs way up for such a successful film and a return to the Jurassic Park franchise. Thank you very much Universal and Legendary Pictures for my new favorite Jurassic Park film.

6696955,1,B00NYC65M8,"I am a big fan of jurasssic park, and I have been watched >50 times ever since when I was 17 years old, I almost changed my career path for this movie, so you can image how excited I was when I heard there would be a jurassic world coming out.
I went on the first vez with my friend and sat through the whole movie with my anger grew bigger as each second passing by. let me make some comparison with these two movie: jurassic park and jurassic world/
1. actors in Park were doctors, they demonstrated their intelligence by abundant background knowledge, reasonable logic argument and sometimes, of course, a little taste of sacastic humor. They were top scientists in their own field, they were titled with ""doctor of philosopher"". whereas actors in world were musclular zookeeper and bussinesswoman, they can show us how to kiss or bulky muscles.......boring, i can watch it anywhere.
2. the story line of Park is very well orgnized, fast pace twisted with scientic style of horor, whereas in world, the woman can ran over dinoasaur with 6 inch high heel? are you serious? it is not SF, it's illusion.
3.  I don't know how many ppl actually read the book of jurassic park, i did. and from the very frist page, the author stated his ground cystal clear: be cautious about gene engineering, be cautious about where you use it, and he disapproval science mates with capital ventur/bussiness. he also question: where is the boundary of scientific research? that's why the auther wrote the next books but never mentioned about rebuild jurassic park, because via the mouth of the mathamatic guy: chaos theory proves the failure of jurassica park already, but in jurassic world, the editor totally ignored the message,  greedy is so obvious, the operators of the jurassic world abuse tech to obtain profit without boundary and stop sign.( so is the firm maker)
the editor of this movie stole the idea of the author but distorted it to a mediocre movie with a glorious title and boring story, no wonder they did the movie after the author passed away.

6696956,3,B00NYC65M8,"This is not a terrible movie........but I cant help to feel that this is not so much a sequel as it was a poor remake of the first Jurassic park film. The lady who ran the park had two kids who had nothing really to do with the plot and were not all that interesting just like the first one (though I did kind of like some of the kid interaction in the first film). We have already seen the previous installments of the films and so the park in the movie is not all that interesting-To me, the new dinosaur and its habitat are like the original Jurassic Park where the raptor expert is summoned to evaluate and....what do you know, it hits the fan and everything goes awry. Some things are a little different (in that they have been exaggerated for seasoned Jurassic Park viewers), but the plot itself seems to be a complete ripoff of the first film. In the end, instead of a T-rex coming in and ""saving"" the main characters, its a pack of raptors, a t-rex, and predator X.

I thoroughly enjoyed some of the action, but I left the theater a little irritated out of principle. To me, the first film had better acting, a nice philosophical viewpoint, and a darker and deeper feel to it.",1434758400,,1184,4.309417040358745
6696957,3,B00NYC65M8,"Jurassic World is set 20 years after the incident with Jurassic Park. Dr. Hammond finally got Isla Nublar under control, but didn't trust InGen to manage his vision; he transferred his authority to the Masrani Corporation to keep his dream alive. Driven by profit, the park's profits spiked whenever a new attraction was featured, but as they are running out of potential dinosaur DNA, they resorted to gene splicing and created the Indominus Rex. In between, the Mitchell brothers are sent to visit their aunt, Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard), the park's operations manager, to be under her care. As she was too busy to look after them, the boys explored the park on their own. Claire was working with Owen (Chris Pratt) to observe the I-Rex when it escaped and is now on a killing spree to establish its dominance over the island while over 20,000 visitors are still on site. Claire and Owen must now rush to find and rescue the brothers while figuring a way to stop the I-Rex's rampage.

Overall, I wasn't impressed by the story. It was essentially similar to part 1 with extra graphics, witty lines, and a I-Rex on the loose. It's almost like a Michael Bay movie. I've watched all the Jurassic Park movies, but the first one had a sense of wonder and amazement as you were excited to see the dinosaurs. With this one though, it was all about the CG dinos and a heavy focus between the raptors and I-Rex. With all the genetic material they used to create the I-Rex, they didn't even feature the dinos they used to make the I-Rex besides the T-Rex and raptors. The introduction was bad, the brothers served as a means to carry the plot, the ending was anti-climatic, no Spinosaurus nor Stegosaurs, it didn't make you want to see more; Chris Pratt's character was the only thing redeeming about it. It's a shame that they didn't bring more of the original stars of the movie back as it would establish more continuity. It was nice to see BD Wong (playing as the original geneticist) though, it was a pleasant surprise to see a non-starring actor come back to reprise his role in a bigger way. I'd say watch the original, you'll be a lot happier and you'll realize exactly how recycled this movie was.",1434758400,5,2206,4.6132315521628495

Alas, my companion insisted on keeping me more or less awake throughout the entire turgid experience. There's not much to say about this utterly uninspired formulaic nonsense except that it seems to have been written and directed with the sole intention of including every stale cinematic clich possible - with the disappointing exception that no one says ""Let's head them off at the pass."" I have no idea why this was omitted except perhaps to imagine that it ended up on the cutting room floor in the interests of saving time.

There is nothing positive to say about this movie, with its obvious shots, trite ""characterization"" and dull dialog. Except, perhaps, that eventually it does limp to its tired end and mercifully stops.",1434672000,7,932,4.753086419753086

6696960,1,B00NYC65M8,"The new Jurassic Park movie Jurassic World is a massive disappointment.  The only thing that saves the movie from being given a failing grade would be those few, fleeting moments where  the movie is enjoyable to watch, and it has been made with a medium degree of competence, which means that it could have been worse.

The original movie was a huge box office success and also a milestone in movie special effects. The first half of Jurassic Park is very deftly handled and thrillingly directed, up until the scene where the raptors attack the children in the kitchen, after which the movie slowly deflates. All of the characters are well cast, especially the character of Ian Malcolm who was played by Jeff Goldblum in a genius stroke of casting. Goldblum steals every scene in which his character is given dialogue. The crowning achievement of the original film is undoubtedly the sequence where the Tyrannosaurus Rex escapes its enclosure and attacks the kids in the Jeep.  It's a brilliant scene, filmed without music on a dark an d stormy night. I would give the film a B.

The second movie, thought to be somewhat lesser by most fans of the franchise, is actually a better overall film. There are more characters, and a richer, more interesting plot. The final sequence of the T-Rex running amok in San Diego is worth the price of admission for anyone who wants a monster movie. There are some silly moments, and it is by no means a great movie, but it's one that I would prefer to sit through again if I had to choose one movie out of the franchise. I would also give The Lost World a B.

The third movie is generally regarded to be a failure, and it didn't attain nearly the level of box office success as the two films previous. Sam Neil returns as the hero, same hat and everything.  The movie features a dinosaur larger and more dangerous than the TRex, and we are treated to a fight between huge carnivores.  The movies effects are somewhat poorer and cheaper looking, possibly owing to the fact that the script wasn't good enough to attract as large a budget. On the whole, the third Jurassic Park is a decent monster flick and I would recommend seeing it to anyone who likes the first two: just don't expect it to be as good, and be prepared for some really irritating characters. I personally give it a D.

This brings us to the fourth and long awaited latest entry in the series, Jurassic World. The movie alternates between being boring and aggravating. Chris Pratt plays the heroic male lead in the movie. His character is underwritten and Pratt is insubstantial. He doesn't bring enough swagger to the role, and the writers damn sure forgot to write any for him. He has a good chin and a fine set of shoulders, but that's about it. Playing Katharine Hepburn to Pratt's Bogart is Bryce Dallas Howard, who is far too baby-faced and lightweight to be suited for her role as an operations head honcho. It's as if a powerful billionaire decided to leave Diane Chambers from 'Cheers' in charge of Dinosaur Island. Her character, the only character with an arc and the true lead of the movie, deserved a more adult actress, someone like a Kate Beckinsale or Rachel Weisz, someone who looked like they crushed at least one pair of testicles each day at work, however that woman would probably make mincemeat of Chris Pratt, who comes across less like the Fedora'd adventurer his character aspires to be and more like the defensive coordinator for a college football team. Romantically, Pratt and Howard have little on-screen chemistry.

The effects in the movie were undoubtedly expensive and are of top-quality, but still manage to fall well short of the mark when it comes to creating believable, flesh and blood dinosaurs onscreen. Most of the film is computer animation, and the dinosaurs don't look like they're on the screen with the actors. The original film used robotics and stop motion, along with CG, to bring actual tangible models of dinosaurs to life on the screen.  The effect wasn't always perfect, but the dinosaurs looked and felt real most of the time. In this film, there are entire shots that are completely computer animated, and what you are seeing onscreen is much less impressive as a result. Furthermore, the scenes of dinosaur action are quick-cut edited so as to prevent the audience from really getting a good long look at any of the dinosaurs, as opposed to the nice closeup shots of real models used in the first movies. I can barely remember what the huge carnivore looked like in this movie because it was only observed obliquely, a la Cloverfield, only without Cloverfield's found-footage conceit as a reasonable excuse.

Finally, there is nothing interesting in the story in terms of set-pieces.  The first movie had the benefit of merely having to introduce dinosaurs. The second movie added the element of a squadron of armed hunters/researchers who were on the island to exploit it, as well as the urban T-Rex ending sequence. The third movie showed us flying dinosaurs from the aviary and treated us to a battle between the huge Spinosaurus and the fan-favorite TRex. This movie recycles sequences that we've already been treated to. The big carnivore attacks two boys in the plastic bubble the same way that the TRex attacked the kids in the Jeep in the first movie, and it was done much better in the original. Also recycled is the sequence where a group of armed men track a dinosaur and are killed. Also recyled is the final sequence when the new big carnivore fights the TRex. Talk about wanting to go ahead with a movie without actually having anything different to add. The only novel idea is having a group of raptors that Pratt trains to ride out with him on his motorcycle (which he rides at night through the jungle at a high speed) in order to track the big predator, but this is an extravagantly silly sequence. Further insulting the intelligence of the audience is the the TRex fight at the movie's climax.  In the third film, the Spinosaurus kills the TRex, or at least leaves it for dead. In this film, the Indomitus seems to kill the TRex, only for the Rex to make a suprise fan-service comeback and rejoin the fight. And wasn't it convenient that the TRex paddock was just down the hall from the hangar where the Indomitus was about to kill Pratt and the bored child next to him? So close in fact that Bryce Howard was able to walk over and release the TRex, who immediately gave chase but was unable to catch her (in heels, I think?) as she skipped back to the fray. I think the term for this is 'T Rex Machina'. I almost broke my neck shaking my head so hard.

I give Jurassic World a D.",1434672000,13,6658,4.6305084745762715
6696961,4,B00NYC65M8,"Before Jurassic World even begins to get going, we see the familiar E.T. production banner for Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment ride across the screen. Amblin, known mostly for its light-hearted kid-friendly adventures of the '80s and '90s, pretty much defined how most people look at that particular genre of film. 1993's Jurassic Park took that to a whole new level, inspiring awe and wonder in the middle of a deadly thriller. While subsequent sequels may have dropped the ball, the first film got the tone just right. Jurassic World, which takes us to even greater dino-theatrics than before, captures the magic of Jurassic Park while employing a whole new bag of tricks to stand firmly on its own.

Directed with surprising blockbuster-sized chops by indie filmmaker Colin Trevorrow (Safety Not Guaranteed), Jurassic World is at times terrifying and wondrous, yet never stops being just plain fun. No small task given the franchise's rich backstory, which Trevorrow and co-writer Derek Connolly (along with Amanda Silver and Rick Jaffa) weave in seamlessly without bogging us down in details. Twenty-two years have passed and now Jurassic Park is fully operational on the isolated Isla Nublar, and has been running disaster free for years. But this being such a huge corporate venture, the need to create bigger, flashier, more dangerous dinosaurs is constant. Audience interest needs to be ""refreshed"", or so we're told by strict operations manager Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard), putting the needs of corporate shareholders over more immediate concerns like safety and morality.

In pursuit of these greater profits, the team of geneticists led by Dr. Wu (the returning B.D. Wong) has taken to splicing together hybrid dinosaurs to create something new. This isn't exactly a new idea as the first wave of created dinosaurs used DNA from other creatures...but how did that turn out last time? Not so well, and we know it won't turn out so well here, either. Their greatest triumph, the 50-foot-tall Indominus Rex, is a gigantic killing machine with the traits of a Tyrannosaurus Rex and other unknown (at first, anyway) creatures. It's meant to be their biggest draw. It will turn out to be something far worse. We don't have long to wait before the Indominus breaks free and is loose upon the park, which we would call an utter disaster but they blandly call a ""containment anomaly"". Can't scare away the public!

And it's that sanitized corporate nature that proves to be the greatest threat in Jurassic World; well, that and our insatiable need to play God. Chris Pratt, more action hero-y than ever, plays Owen Gracy, an ex-Marine now an animal behaviorist who trains velociraptors. What for? Who knows; but he's formed a bond with four of them (naming one ""Blue"", which is like naming a Gremlin ""Stripe""), becoming their alpha male. That's piqued the interest of an evil military contractor (all military contractors are evil in movies) played by Vincent D'Onofrio, who hopes to make a profit using them as weapons. When the crap hits the fan he sees it as an opportunity for a field test rather than a ""holy sh*t""-level disaster.  Unfortunately, the day all of this goes down is the same day Claire's nephews Zack (Nick Robinson) and Gray (Ty Simpkins), who she hasn't seen in years, are visiting the park.

Trevorrow clearly has affection for the original film, but at no point do we sense that he is a slave to it. There are some moments that feel like vague homages; the trembling ground with every stomp of the Rex's feet, or a scene in which visitors are surrounded by stampedes of herding dinosaurs. One moment in particular that recalls Jurassic Park involves a dying herbivore, slaughtered by the Rex for sport. It also happens to be the film's most touching moment. As Pratt's Grady points out; these creatures don't realize they were bred in a lab somewhere; their natural instincts remain. Some just want to live while others only have the urge to kill. So you've got complicated family dynamics, kids in danger, romantic entanglements, corporate malfeasance, and Godzilla-sized chaos all going on at the same time, yet Jurassic World never feels overstuffed. In fact it breezes along nicely and the action sequences are thrilling and often jaw-dropping. While not the technical breakthrough Jurassic Park was, there's still something astonishing about the sight of a thousand pterodactyls flying overhead and attacking the defenseless crowds (look out for funny cameos at this point), just as it's chilling to see a mammoth Tyrannosaurus Rex charging into battle against a foe of equal stature.

Basically, the film looks great, the score is spot-on, and the cast does a terrific job of making you care about the characters. Pratt is the obvious centerpiece here as the Sam Neil-esque hero, and Howard makes the best out of a slightly underwritten role. Irrfan Khan is predictably good as CEO Simon Misrani, the spiritual and literal successor to park founder John Hammond, while Jake Johnson, Judy Greer, and Omar Sy provide laughs and a few dramatic touches. This is definitely a scarier movie than prior efforts, though, and parents may be forced to shield their kids' eyes when they aren't covering their own!

Jurassic World had a tall order ahead of it, but with engaging drama and enough excitement to rattle the raptor cages, it works as a worthy companion to Jurassic Park.",1434672000,2,5419,5.021134593993326

6696963,3,B00NYC65M8,"After the worldwide phenomenon that was Jurassic Park, following up that classic with a worthy sequel was a tall order.  Jurassic Park: The Lost World was, if successful very much (unfairly, in my opinion) maligned by critics and Jurassic Park III didn't fare much better due to the unforeseen circumstance of it appealing to those who disliked the previous one and hated by those who liked the previous one.  Neither of those sequels do anything monumentally wrong, but they both suffer from problems that are made apparent when compared to the original film.

So, is Jurassic World the film that finally brings back the franchise to high quality entertainment?  No, no it isn't, sadly.  In fact, this might even be the worst of the bunch.  Now, since this IS still Jurassic Park, that still doesn't make it a bad film.  Unfortunately, that might actually play against it.  More on that later.

Now, if we're going to make a mathematical analysis of what each of the sequels did right and wrong and made a list of pros and cons based on raw data as if we were computers, this movie might be considered the best.  More set pieces, more dinosaurs, more special effects, more deaths, more villains, etc.  But, since we're not computers, and we analyze entertainment based on its ability to, well, entertain us, this film doesn't reach as high as the previous three.  One example is that the film really wants you to laugh at a guy who can't fly a helicopter very well.  The problem is that it's just not that funny.  It's OK for a mild chuckle, but the film clearly expects you to laugh out loud at it.  It's as if they feel like the more they shove it into your face the funnier it will be.  And that's just not how entertainment works.

Anyway, the basic plot is this: a couple of decades after the original film, John Hammond's original dream has come true, and Jurassic Park is now an attraction open to the public.  Just like in the original film, though, hubris starts to creep in and once the executives in charge of Jurassic World don't feel their earnings are good enough, they decide to attract more people by genetically engineering their own dinosaur: a beast called the Indominous Rex, a monster created to look bigger, badder and cooler in order to appeal to the general, short-attention-span public.  The ""Michael Bay's Transformers"" from the dinosaur world, if you will.  Meanwhile, some other higher-up at InGen decides to try the plot of Alien but with velocirraptors.  Carnage ensues.

Let me make the problem with this film clear: it's so average it makes soap operas blush.  You'd think the story behind the Indominous Rex's origin is a parody of paint-by-numbers Hollywood blockbusters, but this is, ironically, precisely what this movie is.  It doesn't even attempt to be self-aware of it: it just picks up a checklist of all the necessary story elements for a Jurassic Park film and ticks them, without bothering in adding anything new or interesting.  All of it we've seen before, if not in the previous JP film at least in other monster movies like Jaws or Godzilla.  In The Lost World, there's an interesting interchange at the beginning between John Hammond and Ian Malcom, where Hammond tries to reassure Malcom by saying ""Don't worry, we won't make the same mistakes"" to which Malcom responds ""No, you're making all new ones"".  He was right, of course, and the film succeeded in being different from the previous one because of that.  Here, they're making THE EXACT SAME MISTAKES ALL OVER AGAIN.  There's no way to feel sympathy for people who not only not learn from previous mistakes but they can't even see the hilariously obvious problems in front of them.

On top of that, the film follows the same basic aspects of the other ones and expects us to be surprised by them.  The raptors killed for sport in the other movies, but when the Indominous Rex does it it's treated as a shocking revelation.  The main guy and the main girl are an ex-couple.  A no-prize if you can figure out what's going to happen to their relationship at the end of the film.  The bad guy claims he is in control of the raptors.  I give you one try to see if you can guess what happens to him.  Worse, the film eschews realism in favor of fan service.  People didn't like how the Spinosaurus beat the T-Rex in JPIII, so here they go the opposite side so they basically turn the T-Rex into a superhero.  And don't even get me started into the magical properties of DNA splicing.  I guess genetic manipulation is the new ""radiation"".  And there's a guy who's clearly supposed to be the comic relief, but they overdo it and he ends up being annoying right from the beginning of the movie.

Now, see, if this film was bad, it would be more interesting.  Because when a film is bad, it generally means that they tried and didn't succeed.  Here, they didn't really try, it's all generic blockbuster writing with a fancy frosting.  Still, most of the scenes with dinosaurs are entertaining to watch (they ARE dinosaurs after all), Chris Pratt is always a fun presence, and, like I said before, there's nothing this film does that's technically BAD, it's just nothing you haven't seen before, specially if you've seen the previous three films.  This is the rare sequel that benefits from you not having seen the previous movies.",1434585600,5,5327,4.674543501611171
6696964,3,B00NYC65M8,"My family greatly enjoyed this, but I felt that it firmly grasps the middle ground of mediocrity. The plot is pretty much the same as its predecessors - Man's best laid plans to control nature go awry. Lots of near misses and not so near misses with rampant dinosaurs ensue. My family saw this in 3-D, with Muvico D seats, and for me, even with those two extras the movie was wildly average. The rest of my family, however, really enjoyed it, especially my older teen daughter (thank you Chris Pratt) so your mileage may vary.

Despite the improved special effects and presence of the excellent Chris Pratt, there is nothing here that you haven't seen before in the franchise. The movie plays it pretty safe and follows the template established by its predecessors. I don't want to elaborate too much because we all hate spoilers, so I will just say that the resolution of major plot points is so predictable that you can set your watch by them. I'm not saying that means the movie is bad, I mean it's obviously a light-hearted summer action movie, but it could have been so much better with even a bit of originality.

If you love dinosaurs you should probably see this on the big screen. If you only like dinosaurs, this is the perfect rental for home viewing. If you hate dinosaurs, I strongly encourage you to watch Mad Max:Fury Road instead.",1434585600,6,1346,4.580912863070539

6696966,3,B00NYC65M8,"The last ten minutes are what gets this a 3. A fantastic 'brawl' that more than makes up for the meh fest the rest of the movie turns out to be.

Not well written and at times, not well acted (looking at you B.D. Wong), it is a movie that is the result of spending all those years in Development Hell. The CGI is terrible for the most part, made especially so by the dumb 'fantasy' color grade they implemented. There is hardly any tension and the characters are all forgettable and unnatural. At times it can be fun, but it is mostly just a bore to sit through.",1434585600,3,562,4.155963302752293
6696967,5,B00NYC65M8,"Lost Word: Jurassic Park had the elements, the feeling of Jurassic Park but the script just fell short. Jurassic Park 3 tried to do its own thing but it ended up bland. Jurassic World however managed to grasp the concept of JP and embrace it while using new elements. Director Colin Trevorrow did an exceptional job forming scenes and managing actors. What surprised me the most was that I didn't hate the child actors. They were actually a plus to the film.

The only ""Negative"" about this movie is it is much more action than horror. The first JP had quiet moments with intense raptor/rex scenes. Due to them having limited use to the Raptor/T-Rex CGI. JW however is much more action packed. You won't be in a scene with the I-Rex without music.

Overall I love this movie. It has it's nitpicks but it's still a spectacular film. Can't wait for the sequels.",1434585600,,859,4.571428571428571
6696968,5,B00NYC65M8,"The Good-  Chris Pratt does a solid job in the leading role and is likeable.  Bryce Howard is also good here.  The human characters are interesting and developed enough where you aren't asking 'Where are the dinosaurs?'. The movie adds some depth by exploring the relationship between the dinosaurs and the humans, giving the dinosaurs personality.  The Indominis Rex is an extremely frightening villain.  The action scenes are creative and exciting.  Most importantly, it builds up the action leading to an excellent finale.  There is also an interesting sub plot I would have never thought of. There is one character in the film who is the comic relief and just about all his jokes hit. At times, the special effects are scary good.

The Bad- there are a couple of minor faults: there are brief instances where you can see the outlines of the dinosaurs when they are in a pack and when the dinosaurs are flying (I can't spell the name of them).  Also, the kid who played the older brother really couldn't express fear.

The Deal-  This is everything a summer movie should be.  It's a fun movie with very good pacing, action,and humor. Not only are the people interesting as characters, the dinosaurs are even more interesting as characters.  Despite the dinosaurs snacking on some people you can take the kids to see this movie.  Everyone can enjoy this one. I can't recommend this movie enough. Fantastic.",1434585600,2,1408,4.8125
6696969,4,B00NYC65M8,"The first thing I want to say about Jurassic World is that it was much better than I expected it to be. Much. I liked Jurassic Park well enough but the sequels were... well, they were less than good. None of it inspired high expectations from a movie that has the appearance of being nothing more than a car on the Chris Pratt star train. Which is nothing against Chris Pratt, because I've been a fan of his since season one of Parks and Recreation.

Since we're already talking about Pratt, let's just continue to do that. Pratt was fine. Good, even. But it wasn't a part that called for Pratt, and he didn't do anything to make it his, not like with Guardians of the Galaxy. Peter Quill is inseparable from Chris Pratt, because Pratt made that part his. The most that the part of Owen Grady called for was for Pratt to be ""a badass,"" or at least to look like one. He pulled that off, but it didn't take any particular acting skill.

Bryce Dallas Howard, on the other hand, does show considerable skill as the aloof Claire. It's not a role I've seen her play before; though, to be fair, I haven't seen her in a lot. Still, I think she did a good job as the woman trying to be in total control. Of everything.

The one I was really impressed with was Vincent D'Onofrio. I kept looking at him and wondering where I'd seen him before and just couldn't put my finger on it. I had to look up that he's the Kingpin in the current Daredevil series from Netflix. The two roles are widely divergent and, while I think he is the weak link in Daredevil, I now think it's because of some combination of the writing and directing rather than him just being a poor actor.

For Jurassic World, the kids prove to be the weakest element. Neither of them are completely convincing, though I think it's due at least in part to weak writing. Like the scene where Gray unexpectedly breaks down comes out of nowhere and is included just to make explicit something the writers had failed to be previously explicit about. Also, Zach's interest in girls. Which isn't odd except that they firmly establish that he has a girlfriend then repeatedly show him checking out other girls but that doesn't go anywhere have any impact on anything. It adds nothing to the story other than to muddle his personality.

Beyond that, the issues are only details, though there were two that bothered me more than the others. The first was the eggs hatching during the opening credits, which was completely wrong. Things that hatch from eggs hatch with their beaks and, if they don't have beaks, they generally have an egg tooth. Sometimes, they have both. The other thing was the kids getting one of the abandoned cars started, a 20 year abandoned car. I don't know much about cars, but I know enough to know that 1. car batteries don't hold a charge for that long and 2. even if they did, gasoline actually goes ""bad."" The idea that the boys, who had only ever helped work on a car once, could get one of those jeeps working was pretty much ludicrous.

BUT! Overall, it was a pretty decent movie and certainly worth seeing on the big screen. Despite Pratt not really being in a role that called for him, he was good, and his character was certainly the most interesting. Besides, the scene where he rides his motorcycle along with the velociraptors is almost worth the cost of the movie.",1434499200,3,3348,4.4535073409461665
6696970,5,B00NYC65M8,"Movie is great, has a good plot and plot line, pretty realistic and logical, humanity b is working with gene splitting so something along these lines are probable.

The thought of trying to use the raptors for military purposes makes since, governments are constantly trying to get an edge on the others.",1434499200,2,442,4.5375
6696971,5,B00NYC65M8,"my little brother and i, follwing in the footsteps of the prior three jurassic flicks, went to see jurassic world, and i will say this: it was thoroughly awesome and out of control. i love dinosaurs, i love king kong (don't get yer hopes up; the big guy aint here, just that the movie is structured a lot like the original kong), i love the first three movies, and i really, really love seeing people get, um, eaten i guess would be the right word. and boy, do they get gobbled up in jurassic world.

like jaws 3 demonstrates, there are just some animals that shouldn't be kept in theme parks; a freaking awesome genetic amalgamation of several varieties of dinosaurs and other animals sprinkled in for complete bada$$ery tops the list. she escapes. totally satisfying carnage ensues. i mean this from the bottom of my heart: it couldn't have been better.

oh, sure, the movie is loaded with questionable decisions, choices, and actions. how on earth could a theme park allow visitors free-range control of ride vehicles in dino paddocks? why on earth, after the fiasco of every movie ever made, did the designers of jurassic world not build a giant bunker to house guests in the (inevitable, inexorable) event of a dinosaur jailbreak? it's also just possible that the makers of jurassic movies have oversimplified genetics. i could go on, but why bother? these are not issues for me. would i mind a little bit better science, both for my own paleontological satisfaction and to elevate the ""plot""? no, i wouldn't, but i still got what i came for: heavy doses of dinosaur action!

we get this new dinosaur, we get velociraptors, we get all manner of awesome pteranodons, ankylosaurs show up, and many, many more. it couldn't have been cooler. the dinos interact with people, fight each other, run, fly, swim, and as mentioned earlier, dine heavily on homo sapians. there were a couple of scenes of discovery, of people interacting peaceably with or around dinosaurs that could have been extended, to build up the feeling of awe and love that many of us have for dinosaurs, but what the hey? predation is pretty darn cool, too. the velociraptors get a little advancement in their behaviors, and are all chummy with trainer owen, played wonderfully by chris pratt.

like in guardians of the galaxy, pratt shows himself an able leading man of blockbusters, and i'll go ahead and cast my early vote for him to take the reins as the next indiana jones. like harrison ford, pratt is the right combo of funny, physical, and compassionate. the latter point is on grand display in jurassic world, as pratt forges believable bonds with his raptor crew, and really sees the dinosaurs as individual beings, with their own needs and desires (i think he might say exactly this). owen groks dinosaurs, but he doesn't grok all of these people who see them as a meal ticket, people like...claire, who is played really entertainingly by bryce dallas howard. she also gets to be physical and engaging, and she carries her part ably. her character is yet another uptight, ambitious business woman, but she thaws and becomes a real character who loves children (yay!). it's alittle tiresome to see a women stuck in this particular trope once again, that of being all business or all nurture, with little in-between, without balance. ty simpkins and nick robinson are great as the brothers, who have a anne darrow-jack driscoll kind of experience in jurassic park, excuse me, world, recalling more than once the former pair's experiences on skull island. and of course, they wind up better brothers for it.

the special effects were great, some of the best cgi i've seen. i think the original really showed us the best way to use cgi, to mix it with models and puppets, to use each to their strength, but jurassic world looks beautiful. the dinosaurs have heft and texture, and i didn't really question at all that they were there. like the original lost world (1925), king kong (1933), or even the valley of gwangi, my dinosaur needs were met, exceeded, and chewed to bits. i think willis o'brien and ray harryhausen would have enjoyed them.

going forward with the series, i would love to see amblin take a page out of george romero's book: enough with controlled parks. let the dinos out, let them reclaim the world, let's move forward into...a dinosaur apocalypse and see pathetic humanity attempting to survive, developing appreciation for our small, mammalian forebears who towed the line for 30 or so million years, waiting for the dinosaurs to take a fall.

jurassic world exceeded my expectations by a lot. i knew it would be fun, but i didn't realize how satisfying it would be. let's keep this dinosaur train rollin!",1434499200,9,4705,4.794081381011098

6696973,5,B00NYC65M8,"*The most intense thrill ride of 2015 is undisputedly the highly anticipated Jurassic World. In this sequel to the classic Jurassic Park movies, the park on Isla Nubar has not only opened, but has come highly successful.

At first, we get to experience the park through the wide-eyed wonder of brothers Zach (Nick Robinson) and Gray (Ty Simpkins), whose aunt Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) is an executive at the park. Theyve got all-access passes to every area of the park. We see the holograms in the Visitors Center that introduce us to some of the marvels ahead. We get to see the Mosasaur feeding in the aquarium, and the seat that move ride-like to a subterranean window to watch her in her watery habitat. There are public T.Rex feedings, a petting zoo of some of the more gentle creatures, and even Triceratops rides pretty much like pony rides at other attractions. Although Claires assistant Zara (Katie McGrath) is supposed to be acting as tour guide/babysitter, the boys manage to elude her, and ultimately get themselves in trouble.

The always fickle ticket-buying public, however, only comes to the park in droves when a new animal is introduced into the mix  the scarier the better. So the geneticists were tasked with creating a new, never-before-seen super predator. Unfortunately  they succeeded with Indominus Rex. She not only wields deadly force, shes super-intelligent, testing the bounds of her human captors. She also has the ability to camouflage herself to the point where she doesnt even show up on the heat sensors. She identified the tracking device the humans put in her, and tore it out of her own body.

Meanwhile, Owen (Chris Pratt)  is working with Velociraptors  he has imprinted on the ones in his study from the time they hatched, and sets himself up as the alpha male in this wolf-like prehistoric pack of predators. He and the animals have a mutual respect and even kinship. Impressive and fascinating! Although the relationship may look to an outsider as training  the Raptors are still highly intelligent wild animals, and are therefore unpredictable.

Now, with all these elements in place.imagine some of the head-honchos at iGen  the company that engineered the resurrected dinosaurs in the first place  are negotiating with the military to possibly use both the Indominus Rex and trained Raptors as weapons to go into war zones instead of human boots on the ground, weve got a recipe for disaster.  Leading this charge is Hoskins (Vincent DOnofrio).

And disaster is indeed what we get, starting when the Rex finds a way out of her captivity and is roaming loose on the island.

Paleontology has long been one of The Crowgrrls hobbies, and one of the beasties that had always most terrified me was the Mosasaur (and Liopleurodon  very similar aquatic creatures). Let me put it this way  Jurassic World did nothing to calm my fears of this ancient entity  in fact, Im more grateful than ever that they no longer share our world. I recently read a CNN story where paleontologists were interviewed, who lamented that with all the newly acquired knowledge, the Raptors shouldve had feathers. The Pterosaurs shouldve been furry. And the Mosasaur shouldve had a sleeker body with a more shark-like tail. Excuse me?! In the 3-D showing of Jurassic World, I can guarantee NOBODY in the audience was looking at the monsters hindquarters. No, we were all focused on those TEETH that came at us in all-too-alarming 3-D!

Also in response to those scientific party poopers, the animals in the Jurassic Park/World universe were recreated with incomplete DNA  they literally had to be re-made. The DNA was manipulated using strains from other creatures to fill in the blanks. Going with the Jurassic Park mythos as laid out by author Michael Crichton, there is no way to recreate these animals as accurately as they were when their ancestors ruled the Earth. If these scientists are still using the same DNA strains as in the previous chapters of this storyline, of course the beasties will look more like they did in the previous films in the franchise instead of more accurate versions based on new knowledge.

Another highlight of Jurassic World  is a guest appearance from Animal Planets star of River Monsters  Jeremy Wade! Im a huge fan of that show.

That said, I personally enjoyed the Hell out of this movie, and would love to see it over and over again! I cant wait until it comes out on DVD/Blue Ray so I can add it to my personal library!",1434499200,3,4480,4.86578947368421

6696978,5,B00NYC65M8,"Jurassic World shows us John Hammond's vision as a reality.  The park is open with attractions similar to any other zoo or theme park only with state of the art gadgets and security systems.  ""Spare no expense"" was Hammond's motto but when you have investors to answer to, the corporation and scientists are pressured to come up with even bigger, scarier dinosaurs to draw in the public - Indominus Rex -  she's a made up dinosaur, genetically fused between a T Rex and...well that's top secret.  When it was revealed the theater was gasping, ""Oh shizz!""

The story follows two brothers, the younger one excited about the park and the other a surly teenager, headed to the park without their parents but with the supposed guidance of their Aunt Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), who is the uptight COO of Jurassic World.  She's awkward with kids and pawns them off to her assistant.  It's through the boys' eyes we see the different attractions.

Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) is the ""Raptor Whisperer.""  He's raised the four sisters from birth and has them tentatively trained to see him as their Alpha.  Realistic?  Who knows.  But it was cool as heck.

But, as with the other movies in the franchise, they underestimate the power of their newest creation and all heck breaks loose.  I thought the plan to bring down Indominus Rex was clever and it was exciting to watch it play out.  The ending was brilliantly left open for further movies and I, personally, can't wait.

6696980,4,B00NYC65M8,"Jurassic Park...two words that've become a household name, right up there with Indiana Jones and Star Wars. Love it or hate it, the first movie is a classic that stunned audiences around the world with its realistic dinosaurs, and became a mainstay for an entire generation. It's effects still hold up, even today, but after two so-so sequels, the prospect of a fourth film made me cautiously optimistic. Would this new movie be just another mediocre sequel, or would it breathe new life into the franchise? I'm happy to say it exceeded my expectations.

At an unspecified point in the future, the park that John Hammond dreamed of opening is finally a reality. People from all over the world can now come and see dinosaurs, to the point that it's as common place as going to Sea World, or to the zoo. Brothers Zach and Gray head to the park to vacation there, as well as visit their Aunt Claire, who's the park's operations manager. To maintain the park's attendance, the geneticists have created a new, genetically modified dinosaur, to which a raptor trainer named Owen is called in to review the new enclosure and exhibit, before it goes public. But when the new dinosaur escapes and begins to wreak havoc, it's up to Claire and Owen to save not only Zach and Gray, but an entire park filled with thousands of tourists.

The characters in all these movies have been kind of a mixed bag. They're all fairly likeable, and of course we don't want to see any of them get killed, but the creators seem to know that the audience really just came to see the dinosaurs. So the one and only nitpick I have with this film is that it takes a while before we see any dinosaur action. But it's understandable, considering all the set up they had to do in explaining how InGen finally got their act together and got the park up and running. At more than a few points, certain scenes were shot in a way to sort of mirror famous points from the first film, as an homage of sorts. Other times, the references are right in the open, such as the cartoony DNA character, or a sequence where the kids come across the abandoned ruins of the original park. All of this makes this movie feel like a true sequel to the first film--it's called ""Jurassic PARK"", not ""Jurassic people run from dinosaurs that were supposed to be used in a park that never came to pass.""  This film finally takes the next logical step that the other two sequels SHOULD'VE done--we FINALLY see what the park would be like when everything works out.  Granted, there were a few questions left to the wayside, like how InGen recaptured all the dinosaurs and built the park (or found a backer, after all the chaos from the previous films), or why the ruins of the original park were left abandoned and not utilized. But one can just assume they got everything sorted out as the years went by. I'm probably just nitpicking here (or if they did explain this, I didn't fully catch it--I'm writing this after having JUST seen it).

But getting back to the characters, they're all pretty decent. The two kids aren't annoying, and hit the right balance of being appropriately scared, but also being able to take care of themselves in a realistic fashion (unlike the kids in the first film who just scream and make things worse, or the second and third film where one kicks a raptor in the face, and the other miraculously survives an island full of dinosaurs just because he was an Eagle Scout  **eye roll** ). The brothers start off semi bickering and detached, but grow closer and stronger as time goes on. Their Aunt Claire starts off as a busy body, who's too married to her job to give the boys any proper attention, but eventually learns what's more important in life, and that even thought the dinosaurs were born in a test tube, they're still living, emotional creatures to be respected, and aren't just numbers on a page. The fan favorite, of course, is Owen (played by Chris Pratt), who enjoys his job as a raptor trainer, but understands the forces they're dealing with, and that there's some things in nature that just can't be tamed or controlled.

Which brings me to the plot. On the surface, it's pretty much like the other movies, where the dinosaurs get loose and eat some people, before the characters realize the park idea is too dangerous (with a subplot about a guy trying to weaponize the dinosaurs thrown in). But this time around, beyond the ""nature always wins"" and ""humans shouldn't play God"" messages, a new moral also presents itself here. At this point in the future, the general public isn't amazed by the ""generic"" dinosaurs anymore, which results in the scientists having to splice and create entire new breeds of creatures to keep the masses entertained. At certain points, even the main characters lament how society never seems to be satisfied and always want more, and aren't happy with the fact that there's living dinosaurs, period. And in trying to please everyone, they end up creating a virtually unstoppable monster. This seems to take a stab at not just the entertainment industry, but people in general. No matter how much we consume or get, it's never enough.

But with that in mind, it makes me wonder...for all the technical achievements we've made since 1993, and all the fantasy and sci-fi films that've come out since then...for all the aliens, monsters, robots, and other creatures that've been created...why does this franchise still hold up? Why is a movie about ""ordinary"" dinosaurs breaking box office records, when we've arguably seen things even more fantastic? If I had to hazard a guess, it's for a  few reasons. One, because dinosaurs are a creature that actually existed. Even if their exact appearance is up for speculation, the fact still remains that they once roamed the planet. Secondly, this is also probably the closest in real scientific accuracy. Considering the breakthroughs in cloning animals today, it's not too huge of a stretch that we could someday recreate dinosaurs with just a bit of DNA. And third, on the nostalgia side of things, the first film was one of the first, most realistic depictions of dinosaurs on screen (with any of Ray Harryhausen's output being the only other notable example). The film stuck with an entire generation, and even to this day, when you ask someone about dinosaurs, they'll inevitably mention ""Jurassic Park"" as their go-to for imagery.

Plus...it's hard to describe...but there's just something inherently cool about dinosaurs.

So, if this review was any indication, yes--you should definitely go and see this. It's a kick in the pants the franchise needed, while also not forgetting its roots and paying tribute to it. As the final dinosaur fight in the film symbolizes, there's no school like the old school.",1434499200,,6770,4.728813559322034

I know that many consider the first to be  a classic, but while it does have the advantage of being the first to present convincing CGI dinosaurs, the last act of the movie really drags and the the deus ex machina appearance of the T rex from nowhere is inexcusably shoddy screenwriting.  Jurassic World has a little deus ex machina of its own, but it is set up much more logically.  Chris Pratt solidifies his status as his generations Harrison Ford.

I even kept the hopes up for the first part of the movie, all the up until after the big bad dinosaur predictably escapes (there wouldn't be a movie without this happening). It starts off with some parts that were witty and funny enough that I thought maybe the filmmakers knew what they were doing. I was so terribly wrong.

Why couldn't it be interesting and creative? Why couldn't it have evoked a semi challenging thought process? Why couldn't they have made me at least a little more fearful for the well being of the thousands of visitors at the park or, at the very least, the main characters? Why did they have to make a supposedly bloody, scary, and violent movie mentally accessible to a two year old? And WHY did they have to make the cute dying brachiosaurus sound like an wheezy old man?

I wanted to see ultimate carnage, why else would you have an entire park filled with expendable characters??? When the first one came out I was NOT allowed to watch it because it was way too scary. What I witnessed last night was a borderline family film with about as much blood as Dracula-Dead and Loving It.

I can however say that I felt genuinely connected to Mr. T-Rex at the end. All he wanted was to come out of his cage to check things out,  gets the s*** kicked out of him, and then defeatedly limps back to his hole to wallow in misery.",1434412800,5,1387,4.323076923076923

6696985,4,B00NYC65M8,"***This review may contain spoilers.***

I knew it, I just knew it  or at least partially knew it.  In my Amazon review for Jurassic Park III (which I admired very much, by the way, so there!!!) I predicted that the follow-up movie would involve some kind of dinosaur DNA manipulation and creation of new dinosaur hybrids.  Lo and behold, the movie Jurassic World (hereafter JW) introduces a hybrid, christened Indomitus Rex (I-rex) which is an amalgam of T-Rex and raptor DNA, plus non-dinosaur DNA such as from the tree frog and the cuttlefish (which is a type of gastropod or squid with chromatophores that allow it to camouflage itself by changing colors).  Thats why, in addition to its extra knife-like teeth, robust arms, and Wolverine-like claws, I-Rex has the Predator ability to blend seamlessly into its surroundings. Basically, it looks like the Spinosaurus from JPIII without the spines. I-Rex came into being, because, according to JWs operations manager Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard), the InGen-owned dinosaur theme park was suffering diminishing attendance as people were getting jaded and blas about ordinary dinosaurs, (which I found hard to believe) and needed a brand-new, better dinosaur.  InGen and JW succeeded beyond their wildest nightmares.

As my title suggests, originality and social commentary are not high on JWs agenda.  Even as it borrows and copies scenes and concepts (sometimes almost wholesale) from all three of its Jurassic Park movie predecessors, JW doesn't bang you over the head with the ethical implications of cloning and exploiting dinosaurs for human amusement.  Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), and Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) are not present to poke at our consciences.  No, JW borrows from yet another movie source, the Godzilla films, to scare both park and movie audiences with a terrifying, practically invincible monster attacking everything in their path, sometimes (as with the apatosaurs) just for the thrill of it.

Actually, there is one person who does disapprove of JWs hybridization program.  That would be rugged, good-looking, military veteran Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) who for some inexplicable reason is serving as surrogate mother and whisperer to a pack of raptors who imprinted on him upon hatching (as implied from the movies beginning).  But for whatever reason he attempts to tame and control his charges, he has no intention of allowing InGen security head Vic Hoskins (Vincent DOnofrio) to use the raptors as military weapons a la the Alien franchise (I was thinking how Vic would do such a thing; despite their speed and ferocity, raptors cant fire guns and aren't bullet-proof  oh well). Therefore, besides the distracted, workaholic, ex-girlfriend Claire, Owen has to constantly butt heads with Vic.

Anyway, before long, the I-Rex uses his chameleon powers and cunning as well as brute strength to escape from his remote enclosure and make his deadly bee-line for the theme park.  To complicate matters further, Claires nephews, dinosaur geek expert Gray (Ty Simpkins) and his hormonally-charged older brother Zach (Nick Robinson) are simultaneously visiting the park. Therefore, the plot simply involves stopping the I-Rex before it destroys the park, kills off or frees the other dinosaurs, decimates the customers, including Zach and Gray, and, horror of horrors, sinks InGens latest investment!

In some ways, besides having similarities to the movies already mentioned, JW resembles Independence Day in the way that it is engrossing, exciting, and involving, just so long as you don't think too deeply about it.  Otherwise, you will notice the nagging inconsistencies and foolish, nonsensical behavior like
  - the I-Rex crashing through walls
  - a security guard hiding behind a car that the I-Rex can flip like a Tonka toy
  - Claire running in high heels
  - the raptors switching loyalties back and forth between Owen and the I-Rex
  - Vic sticking his hand out to pet a snarling raptor
  - Claire (still in high heels) going to a secret enclosure to summonguess who to take on the I-Rex
  in a pulse-pounding, earth-shaking climactic fight,
  - the mosasaur (the colossal water creature) demonstrating both the deus ex machina principle and the Chekov gun principle,
  if you know what I mean (if you dont, you can look up those principles on Wikipedia, as I did).

But, hey, its summer.  Who thinks during the summer?  JW is the perfect example of the Summer Monster Dinosaur movie.  Send your brain to bed and let JW treat you and your emotions to an immensely rollicking good time!",1434412800,2,4606,5.154986522911051

6696988,5,B00NYC65M8,"Jurassic World has accomplished what only a few short months ago seemed an impossible feat--besting Marvel's Avengers' record-breaking box office opening weekend. At $208, 806,270.00 it has barely squeezed into the number one spot (Avengers made $207,438,708.00). Does it deserve the top spot? See it for yourself and decide!

The fourth film in the Jurassic Park franchise may not have the same sense of awe the original gave audiences more than twenty years ago (hey, it was the first time we got to see genetically engineered dinosaurs!), but the special effects are far better, the park itself is much more high-tech, and this film has Chris Pratt, who in my opinion is the new alpha of action stars. He reminds me in many ways of Harrison Ford. 'Nuff said.

I disagree with the reviewers who say the film lacks character development. It may not have as much as I'd like, but I believe action reveals a great deal about character, and if there's one thing this film doesn't lack, it's action. Pratt's dino-wrangler Owen Grady is a Navy man who has a vaguely-referenced history with Bryce Dallas Howard's Claire. He's something of a swashbuckler, living in a ramshackle trailer (at least I think there was a trailer under that mess) and riding an old motorcycle. Claire, on the other hand, is a polished corporate professional who ends up looking pretty silly trying to escape rampaging dinosaurs in her high heels. What could these two possibly have in common? Hmmm....

John Hammond, who first conceived the idea of a dinosaur theme park is gone now, having left his dream in the hands of the very wealthy Simon Masrani (Irrfan Khan), who shows more concern for the welfare of the dinosaurs than anyone else in the movie with the exception of Owen. Sir Richard Attenborough, along with Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum and Laura Dern are sorely missed, as well as Julianne Moore from Jurassic Park: The Lost World.

The requisite villains in this installment are Dr. Henry Wu (BD Wong, who appeared in Jurassic Park), the geneticist who's missing the conscience gene, and an InGen security chief named Hoskins (Vincent D'Onofrio), who has plans of his own for the dinosaurs--specifically, Owen's team of raptors. Owen doesn't trust him, and with good reason. I kept hoping one of them would eat him.

You can tell the Jurassic movies are geared toward a family audience, because there are always kids in them. This time around, the kids are Claire's nephews, Gray and Zach (Ty Simpkins, who was Tony Stark's young sidekick in Iron Man 3, and Nick Robinson), who were sent to Claire for a visit while their parents dealt with an impending divorce. As always, the kids are bright and resourceful.

But to me, the real star of the Jurassic films has always been T-Rex, and when he finally does make an appearance, he delivers. There's a saying in Hollywood: never make a movie with kids or animals. Making a movie with a scenery (and actor) chewing T-Rex could be added to that caution!",1434412800,6,2980,4.821917808219178
6696989,2,B00NYC65M8,"Did Apple Pay to Have Samsung Phones Featured ?

Every mobile phone I noticed in the movie was Samsung. In the movie, they usually had a bad connection, dropped calls, or a broken screen.

I was wondering if Apple paid the producers to show Samsung phones in such a bad light.

Similar situation with Mercedes.  There was a good view inside a Mercedes SUV.  It showed how the navigation screen was done incorrectly, (having the screen ""pop up"" in the dashboard rather than ""built into"" the dashboard).

The movie itself was pretty good. But the product placement aspect of it was a distraction and somewhat confusing.",1434412800,,617,4.773584905660377
6696990,4,B00NYC65M8,"And so we return over 20 years later (I recognize there were two more movies, but for me any Jurassic Park movie is going to be measured against the original).  The set-up is straightforward.  With their parents preparing for divorce, teen Zach and pre-teen Gray are shuffled off to go visit their Aunt Claire.  Who happens to run Jurassic World, now20-years later in movie time as wella full-out amusement park hosting 20,000 people a pop that sprawls across the island.  Teenager-y Zach and dinosaur-obsessed Gray get shuffled off (again) to an assistant with skip-the-line passes.  Claire is busy closing a deal with Verizon to get their name in the movie because phones aren't big enough (yet) to slap a Mercedes star-sized trademark on.  She wants Verizon to sponsor their newest attraction and help them become more relevant (my PR professional-wife let out an involuntary cheer at that point).  That attraction?  A genetically-engineered new dinosaur they call Indominus Rex.  Rounding out the main cast are Owen, an experimental Velociraptor trainer and former Navy man, and Misrani, the oil-and-telecom tycoon who owns the park.

In the least spoilery-spoiler I could possibly give, the Indominus Rex is where things all go wrong.  Who could have thought that giving a T-Rex long arms would be a bad idea?  Who could imagine a 50-foot long dinosaur climbing a 40-foot tall wall?  The Indominus Rex keeps coming up with new surprises, each somehow gained from another little bit of DNA spliced in (e.g., cuttlefish, tree frog).  I didn't stick around for the stinger, but I can only assume it was Professor Xavier offering the Indominus Rex a spot with the X-Men.  Everything about the Indominus Rex screams that it is a terrible idea.  It ate its sister.  It grew to be much bigger than expected.  The people who run the park seem to have no idea of the source of its genetic material beyond a T-Rex base.  Apparently while the park owns the attraction, the intellectual property remains the proprietary property of InGen, which contracts with the park.  The corporate structure is unclear (the story of my life).

But its good that everything goes wrong, because were all here for the dinosaurs, right?  We get a lot of them.  The Indominus Rex may be unoriginal (again, T-Rex with long arms), but its still a dang cool monster.  And after some Godzilla-Cloverfield style teasing, we get to see plenty of it in its full glory.  There is also Owens pack of Velociraptors (and the Velociraptors were the real stars of the first movie), a Mosasaurus (the whale-dinosaur featured in the trailer), Pterodactyls and other flying dinosaurs, my personal favorite the mace-tailed Ankylosaurus, and of course the T-Rex makes an appearance.

Jurassic World is not a perfect movie.  Nothing InGen does makes sense.  Its horribly unsubtle.  Characters spout ethical arguments without engaging in the context and without interest from their purported audience.  The movie sometimes beats you over the head with callbacks and references to the first movie (and presumably the other two) and fourth-wall bending responses to complaints (the dinosaurs aren't designed realistically because Rule of Cool).  Much of the magic of the original was always out of reach, but its sad to see the scientists take a back seat (the only scientist who shows up is one of the bad guys).  The characters are facially a-character-with-trait-x.  Zach is the teen who doesnt want anything to do with his parents or his kid brother.  Gray is the annoying kid providing a constant feed of facts and figures (I was that kid; I still am that kid.)  Claire is the impersonal workaholic.  Owen is the animal whisperer who you know is cool because he uses the s-word, like right off the bat.  Misrani is the eccentric billionaire.

But it works.  Zach and Gray may be archetypes but those are archetypes for a reason, and the poignant scene where they discuss their parents impending divorce gives emotional heft for the terror of the rest of the movie.  Claire is the weakest link early on but really comes into her own in the second half of the movie (the trick was rolling up her sleeves and tying her shirt off in the front).  Owen keeps being awesome but its a good thing they didn't ask him to carry the movie.

I was worried that with a full park, now with its own paramilitary force, that it wouldnt work as well as a horror movie.  Nope, its legit scary.  The action scenes, whether dinosaur-on-man or dinosaur-on-dinosaur are well done and the special effects are top-notch.  A quiet scene with a dying Apatosaurus does more to establish the dinosaurs as real animals that all those lines of dialogue on the front-end.  The plot holes are Velociraptor-sized, not T-Rex-sized (this is all you can really ask).  It can be very funny, mainly courtesy of New Girls Jake Johnson.

Production budget: $150 million (Wikipedia dot org)

Domestic grosses: $649,860,516

Foreign grosses: $1,009,470,082

Worldwide:  $1,659,330,598

6696994,1,B00NYC65M8,"When does it end?  When is enough enough?  When will bloated, gargantuan, grotesque movies go on a diet?  When will the cliched, cartoonish, CGI enslaved crapola of current cinema cease? When will minds be fed as well as eyeballs?  When will the dumbing down stop before fatally crashing to rock bottom?  When will words and genuine human emotion matter again?  When will movies be the measure of what is best in civilization and creativity and not be fueled by the greedy popcorn-and-circuses mindset of the harlot Hollywood?

Before the main attraction, there were the previews.  FANTASTIC FOUR and then SUPERMAN VS BATMAN (or was it BATMAN VS SUPERMAN, not that it matters!).  Both previews went in one eye and ear and out the other.  Both previews I have seen countless times before. Explosions and phony special effects and macho guys and sometimes even more macho gals and everyone with an attitude and a big weapon on hand. Laughter and smiles are as rare in movies anymore as is melody in its music. Movies anymore don't want to be good as much as they want to be badass. Movies don't want to be meaningful, they want to be mindless. In subconsciously trying to be cathartic to ""help"" us better control our worst fears - of explosive, anonymous, apocalyptic Death - by making the fireball explosion the trope of today's entertainment, the collective mindset of the movie-going public is slowly but surely using fantasy to accept a potential reality and,like a self-fulfilling prophecy, the apocalypse is slowly becoming more and more acceptable and even... darkly desired. Feeling so helplessly insignificant and out-of-control anymore in this madhouse world, people need to imagine themselves powerful enough to survive the ultimate blast - and one way to do so is through our comic book gods, our Greek myths courtesy of Marvel and DC. Less entertainment anymore, however, these movies are more akin to inoculation! But on a simpler level, when did Superheroes stop being fun?  Now they are lugubrious, lumbering, ponderous and pontifical odes to the Other.  And all overwhelmed by CGI and explosions and kick-ass violence and a seriousness that is sickening.  'Do you bleed?' Batman asks Superman in one clip.  And the music to these movies?  No more love songs that soar or powerfully composed action sequences of genuine music a la John Williams, but all Zimmery death knell percussion, notes like body slams, chords like karate chops, racing rhythms piston-fueled by anger and more anger and...sound and fury, signifying...nothing.

So now the main feature!  Part four of the Jurassic Park saga.  And what a stupid film unfurls itself like a proud flag of ignorance across a screen dulled to sensitivity, blank to genuine feeling, dead to any semblance of reality.  Not a single character in this story is more than a cliched concoction sprung from some smarmy scriptwriter's witless brain.  Not a moment's pause is given to the poetic promise of the story's premise. The one scene that could have elevated this flick just a smidgin is a blink and miss it shot of folks kayaking down a lazy river with the gentle giants, the veggie dinosaurs, meandering about - but it is over before it begins. Other than this there is not one visually and emotionally memorable moment in all of the endless action that doesn't exit one eye as fast as it enters the other.  Not one set-piece that will survive the summer and become iconic. The first JURASSIC PARK had genuine thought and feeling intermixed with the action - and it had its share of memorable moments.  This risible redux has none of that.  And the storyline itself is complete comic book, without a believable moment whatsoever.  One example: are we to believe that the ruins of the old Jurassic Park would still be left on the island?  But, alas, this is worked into the paltry plot just so the boys can find themselves a twenty year old jeep and stunningly get it going once again. There is also nothing truly new or original in the entire film.  We've seen it all before - in the three previous installments.  I'm raptored-out by now, big-time. Come on!

6696997,5,B00NYC65M8,"Jurassic World is not only for the diehard Jurassic Park fans, anyone interested in an adrenaline rush in terms of ones movie watching interests, this may be the film to provide a double dose of energy.  For viewers that began their tour of Jurassic Park with the first two films, Steven Spielberg directed family enjoyment and a step back in time a billions of years by reviving the land of the dinosaurs in the form of a natural theme park of Jurassic Park.

Four films later, the last two Jurassic films, were not under the tutelage of Spielberg,  Jurassic Park III was directed by Johnston (The Rocketeer, October Sky, Captain America) and Jurassic World by director and screenwriter Colin Trevorrow (Safety Not Guaranteed).  However, all has not been lost but regained in terms of the Jurassic series.  Over twenty years later after the first film, many things have changed in terms of cinematography, graphic design, and technological advancements in the special effects department.  So not to spoil the film for viewers wanting to experience the excitement that the film began in 1993 and the fascination with dinosaurs in the modern world, there are two things (but one may find more) in the film that will strike a bit of nostalgia or if it exists in sci-fi films and for fans of the genre, a slight touch of sentimentalism that offers a tongue in check elements  quirkiness and off the cuff moments.

 Jurassic World, regardless if it had Spielbergs stamp or not it is one of those films that meshed extreme curiosity and excitement and horror in over two hours.  And although it is not meant to be a thought-provoking film, some aspects may simply arise when it comes to the long argued theme of man against nature.  No doubt, the film shows the battle of the strongest with much brutal and graphic detail that appeared so realistic.  Nevertheless, it is a highly recommended film, especially seen in 3-D (IMAX) if one enjoys things up close and personal and simulated much like an amusement ride.",1434326400,2,2008,4.805232558139535
6696998,5,B00NYC65M8,"I wish words could adequately explain just how much I loved Jurassic World. Now, I will come out and open and say that the 1993 original is still my favorite, but this movie did the original justice.

The cast is absolutely terrific. Chris Pratt obviously does an amazing job, but so did Bryce Howard (park Manager). She was fabulous and you were right along with her in her strength that turned to terror as she realized her nephews were lost in the park. She is the perfect amount of American businesswoman that is too distracted with her work and number than to look at the bigger pictures. She is relatable. (Except in the one of the ending scenes when she is running in heals.)

What I think is compelling about this story is our desire, especially as Americans, to create new bigger and better consumer products. In terms of dinosaurs, this obviously leads to something crazy. This is a relatable story line that draws the audience into the movie. (Spoiler) Paired with this is the military undertow of wanting to have control to use them in the theater of war. This is where we end up paying the price. This is a fresh story that allows us to be taken into a new version of this story.

What I appreciated most about this Jurassic World was how it connected back to the original movie. There is talk about Hammond leaving the park to the new owner, they take us back to some of the old scenes that are now over grown with vegetation. I felt that this was a perfect integration to talk about how the Park has grown in the time since the first movie.

There is also a slight love story that is simple enough that it does not take center stage ever, but keeps a nice little extra spice in the movie. The one thing that I wasn't fond of is that there is a lot of room for a new movie to come and I think this would have been a great ending place, so I hope they don't make another.

Overall, I loved the story. It was not predictable and it left you with enough turns that you didn't know how it would end. It did the series justice and I will watch it again.",1434326400,4,2062,4.276923076923077

Spy is a must see thanks to a script that perfectly matches the talent, physicality, and quick witted personality of Melissa McCarthy.  She turns in a winning performance making this send up of James Bond movies a delight since she is so likeable.

See it.  I hope you like it as much as I did.

As for the best Must See Blockbuster to date, you gotta see Jurassic World.

You will relive the pleasure of seeing the marvels of the original Jurassic Park but now rebuilt spectacularly and with monsters that have been gene-spliced bigger, stronger, faster, and with lots more teeth.

You'll meet the expected two youngsters who will be in peril, come to like the humor and know how of Chris Pratts character, and  figure out which guys are misguided or bad.  There is even a spunky, smart, and courageous woman who cancels out any blather you might have read about the movie being retrograde or demeaning to women. You'll see a replay of Beatrice and Benedict, potential and squabbling lovers who will eventually click and kiss.

Everything in the way of magic made believable via CGI is present and dazzlingly so. The makers even realized that their major monster should not be fully seen; so our imaginations expand its terror as we did that briefly glimpsed passing image of Jaws eyeing the chum casting Roy Scheider.

The script is well crafted.  Small scares break up a leisurely introduction of JW so you can enjoy the park, get to know the characters, and actually feel connected to them before their ordeals begin.

From about Minute Thirty on it is thrill after thrill and then moments of apparent safety shattered by big frights which are then exceeded by still bigger frights.

So here is a caveat: While JW is gripping and thrilling, it might also be too intense and terrifying.  While the producers made efforts to dampen the rawest mayhem and death by dino, parents might want to give thought about taking their youngest to see JW.

(Its been a day since I saw JW and I still feel some adrenaline sloshing about and what was a hoot for me might be nightmarish for the very young.)",1434326400,9,2154,4.643799472295514

The second and the third sequels are ok until 22 years later a fourth film was released. This film is scary because of one dinosaur; the mighty I-Rex. In this film, the scientist from the first Jurassic Park (B.D. Wong) is back. This film takes place 22 years after the first film, two brothers (Robinson) and (Simpkins) were sent to Jurassic World to visit their aunt (Bryce Dallas Howard). The brothers had a blast in Jurassic World until the Indominus Rex or I-Rex, a dinosaur made from multiple carnivore dinosaur DNA, had escaped. It is up to a raptor trainer (Pratt) and his 4 raptors that he raised, to save Jurassic World and the visiting brothers or it will be too late.

6697004,3,B00NYC65M8,"I just got done watching the premiere of Jurassic World in 3D. It is not a bad film, but it falls short in many places.

Let me get something out of the way first. It is an absolute waste of time to watch this film in 3D. It did not add to the viewing experience at all. Basically, if there are 2 people talking in the movie, one of them is in 3D. Wow. Also, there are not enough dinosaurs popping out of nowhere to scare you. I think that only happens about twice in the film.

So, basically, the story is about how they have made Dinosaur Island into an amusement park. There are petting zoos and other attractions to attract visitors to the island. Not only are there cute herbivore dinosaurs. They also have grown vicious carnivores. Why? Because they never learn. In fact, they have created a genetically modified dinosaur which is bigger than a t-rex and is spliced with all the best characteristics of other dinosaurs. It can change color like a chameleon and more.

So the premise is that this dinosaur escapes from its sanctuary and causes havoc throughout the park. There are 20,000 people on the island and they are in big trouble. Most of the film is about trying to kill that big dinosaur before it kills everyone.

Why did I rate this film three stars? One does not care for the characters in this film. They are too annoying to care about or to like. Also, the story drags in certain places. I would not call this film boring, but it is not entertaining enough. There just is not enough in this film to keep you captivated.

I definitely would recommend this film as a one time viewing experience only. After that, it is not worth the time to watch again.",1434326400,3,1670,4.391585760517799
6697005,4,B00NYC65M8,"Jurassic World (2015)
 22 years after the opening of Jurassic Park the fourth film in the franchise rumbled and chewed its way into the darkened theaters and into our terrified imaginations.  For this iteration the writers invented a new, bigger, more dangerous dinosaur than even the ferocious T-Rex of the first film.  The genetically manipulated, sword toothed chomper has a few tricks up his claw that the designers did not take into account when they built her, bit by genetic bit.  Terrifying.
 And terror totally fits the bill when we go to see a film like this.  The story, simplified, has two siblings cast loose in the theme park just as a series of events lets loose a gigantic predator with catastrophic results.  People get chased.  People get eaten.  We remember the story line and we have no trouble remembering how things will turn out.  No surprises trouble us.  And no heroic acting efforts trouble us either.  But do we care?  Not a bit.  The huge predator loose in the Park holds our attention.
 The special effects driven film delivers scares on demand.  People like this sort of thing at this time of year.  The film cost some $150 million to make with the help of dozens and dozens of clever computer programers.  The happy producers, Steven Spielberg among them, report a stunning $519 world wide gross over the three day opening week end.  I thought the movie lacked the charm of Jurassic Park and the best of Spielberg's other work, but that carries no weight.  A huge predator is loose in the Park!  Watch out!
 A strong cast spends most of its time running to and fro attempting to stay alive, find the lost kids and keep the paying customers from being snacked on by the monster predator like a collie with kibbles.  Chris Pratt plays a properly heroic hero never mind that we know him best for his comic efforts on the long running TV show Parks and Recreation.  This makes his second mega successful outing as the star of a huge block buster after his role in Guardians of the Galaxy.  We count him solidly in the movie star ranks now and expect to see much more of him in coming films.  His supporting actors include Brice Dallas Howard as the suit in charge of the amok running carnivores.  Famous actor/director Ron Howard fathered Brice.  Brice Howard acts, directs, writes and produces from time to time.  She has done good solid work in the past and does so here but her character elicits little sympathy from the viewers.  Her corporate stance gets in the way of her more human side as the aunt of the lost kids or as the possible romantic interest for star Chris Pratt.  Not her fault, she acted exactly her character as written.  Comic actor Jake Johnson could have done much more if asked in his slightly written role as the computer guy, a la Wayne Knight in the first film. Judy Greer supports as the distant mom of the wandering boys.  Among the supporting actors Vincent D'Onofrio stands well out as the security operative who wants to use the beasts for his own purposes.  We know him best as an Emmy winner for his TV show Law & Order: Criminal Intent.
 Writer/director Colin Trevorrow has never before handled such a big project.  His only other feature film had a tiny budget of under a million dollars and a tiny box office of about four and a half million.  The film, Safety Not Guaranteed did feature Jake Johnson, who also appears in Jurassic World.  After the tremendous success of Jurassic World we expect to see more of his work in the future.
 Funny man Jimmy Fallon appears in an instructional video, a function that he also fills in the theme ride.  Jimmy Buffett also has a cameo as a paying customer dodging an attacking pterosaur.  Judy Greer and Brice Dallas Howard also worked with each other on the very odd but interesting The Village.
 Jurassic World carries a mild PG-13 rating for people chomping.  The film runs exactly two hours.  I found the three saw blade pop corn churner to have decidedly less innovation, snap, imagination and heart than the original but so it goes.  People love it and you will love it too.
 Did I mention the giant predator loose in the theme park?  Oh boy.",1434326400,2,4153,4.5953678474114446
6697006,4,B00NYC65M8,"Chris Pratt: Dinosaur Whisperer

Before I get into my thoughts on Jurassic World, I think it's relevant to know about my relationship with it's great-grandfather, Jurassic Park.

In 1993, as a 12 year old, I was not able to go to see Jurassic Park in theaters because some kid down the block went and had to be taken out of the theater because he was 'too scared'. Thanks, kid - this was a real bummer to a person who loved dinosaurs as a boy. We got it on VHS about a year later and I was mesmerized. Spielberg had created a masterpiece. I've seen it at least 20 times by now (the last being when they re-released it in theaters in 3D a few years ago) and it still holds up today. The dinosaurs had to be amazing to sell that movie, and they were. I LOVE Jurassic Park.

Now surprisingly, I have never seen the two sequels. I remember seeing the trailer for The Lost World, seeing dinosaurs out in New York City or something and thinking, ""Nope, I'm good."" The third went back to the well, but I was already out by then. I didn't feel I needed to get back to that world, I mean...Jurassic Park was just so perfect.

22 years later, Jurassic World was here, and I decided it was time to get back to that world. I was excited for two reasons: Colin Trevorrow and Chris Pratt.

Everyone knows who Chris Pratt is by now - he was in two of the best and most popular movies last year in The Lego Movie and Guardians of the Galaxy - but I've been following him since 2009 as the lovable loser Andy Dwyer from Parks & Recreation. He's charismatic and hilarious, and I can't help but root for him. Trevorrow is a bit more under the radar. I became a Trevorrow fan after seeing his first (and only) feature, Safety Not Guaranteed. It's a fantastic little film about time travel that deserves to be seen. He has talent.

Anyway, on to the movie. The setup is that Jurassic World is an evolved version of the original - more attractions, more dinosaurs, and more money. In an allegory to the series, the people who run the park know that they need bigger, scarier, cooler dinosaurs to keep audiences coming back, so scientists on the island create a hybrid dinosaur. Predictably, things go wrong. It's up to a park manager and a dino-trainer to help save the day.

We follow a child through a crowded monorail as it approaches the park, introducing us to Jurassic World. He nears the window to see the monolith and the classic Jurassic Park theme song swells...it was amazing.  I felt like that kid, coming back to the park. The following 90 minutes were really great. The dinosaur effects were brilliant - particularly the I-Rex - and blended in with the scenery. There weren't any eye-rolling CGI moments like in San Andreas. The actors did a fine job with what they had to work with. The climax is thrilling.

The movie isn't perfect. The 'military' aspect of the movie is uninteresting. The writing is awful and some of the setup is just plain weird (you're telling me that a giant sea dwelling dinosaur can jump stories into the air to snatch a shark off of a string, but it can't turn a bit to the right to eat all of the people watching it?). The characters are very one dimensional, have weak dialogue, and are almost weak carbon copies of people in the first Jurassic Park (person who doesn't like kids but realizes how cool they are by being surrounded and responsible for two of them...Claire from Jurassic World or Dr. Grant from Jurassic Park?). I thought that a raptor was the most well written character - YOU'RE MY BOY, BLUE! My wife said the most unrealistic part of the movie was not that dinosaurs could be cloned...but that Claire could run around the entire movie in high heels. Yes, this woman ran through jungles from DINOSAURS and kept her heels on the entire time.

Story stupidity aside, it's a really fun movie and I'm glad that I saw it. Pratt is charming, the effects are fantastic, and there are plenty of put you on the edge of your seat moments. If you love Jurassic Park like I do, you'll really like Jurassic World.

6697007,5,B00NYC65M8,"FINALLY! Finally a REALLY GOOD sequel/reboot of a franchise, something I didn't think I will live to see. After years of avoiding remakes/sequels/prequels/spin-offs/reboots and of suffering mightily through those to which I (stupidly) gave a chance, I was finally treated to a REALLY GOOD sequel/reboot film.

24 hours after seeing ""Jurassic World"" I am still under shock, partly because this VERY, VERY GOOD movie really took me for a helluva ride, but mostly because of all a sudden a substantial part of my system of beliefs was shattered and obliterated. It was for me an article of faith that Hollywood is nowadays only able to produce pathetic copies of great successes of its past. In fact Hollywood in past 10-15 years was functioning as a huge ruminant in a luxuriant orchard - swallowing tasty fruits created by efforts of devoted masters, chewing them noisily and messily and then producing gigantic smelly piles of excrement And now this world as I knew it ended, because lo and behold, Hollywood took a mightily good and much beloved thing from the past and, with much care, effort and creativity build upon it a continuation tale, which is in the same time a respectful, faithful tribute to its venerable ancestor, an original and innovative thing and also a DARN GOOD FILM!

I will not say anything about the story, to avoid spoilers but also because it is also more or less clear what this film is about  even for somebody who somehow managed to avoid the trailer))) The only thing that deserves to be said, is that if the second and third movies of this franchise are completely ignored by the scenario of ""Jurassic World"" (and a mighty good thing too!), the first ""Jurassic Park"" on another hand is still very much present in this film. The action occurs on the original (and very fictitious) Isla Nublar near Costa Rica coasts, remains (some buildings, some equipment but also merchandise) of the original Jurassic Park figure prominently in some scenes, Dr. Wu (B.D. Wong) still is the chief of genetics lab, John Hammond, albeit already deceased, is very much revered by some important characters  and of course music frequently returns to the original, legendary John Williams score. HOWEVER, there is absolutely no question that ""Jurassic World"" (both the film and the park) is a new creation, with its own identity, it just that there is a thread from the original ""Jurassic park"" woven into it and its separate colour and texture is repeatedly visible  and because the weaving was so skilful and precisely measured, its presence is a very pleasant thing, a nice and gentle gesture, which in no way diminishes the originality and creativity of the whole thing.

The most important thing in ""Jurassic World"" are of course the dinosaurs and they were EXTREMELY well done  and I am not talking here only about the technical aspects. There is much more ""character development"", especially in the case of raptors, which in this film have been raised by a handler, Owen Grady (Chris Pratt). Grady, a tough no-nonsense ex-soldier, managed to gain some measure of control over them  but the good thing is that from the very first moment we are aware that it is a fragile achievement at best and he is as careful around them as humanly possible. Still following on ""character development"" and also in reference to the sequence with the sick triceratops in the first movie, there is a very, very moving and powerful scene of very close contact and an exceptional understanding between some humans and a gigantic Apatosaurus  I am quite certain that some people around me in the cinema had tears in their eyes at that moment and I don't blame them for that

There are some amusing details about the diet of predatory dinosaurs  the T-Rex is still on a goat diet and the gigantic mosasaurus feeds exclusively on sharks from ""Jaws"", reminding us that Spielberg, albeit not directing in person, is still behind the whole project as executive producer))) Another great idea was to place some young dinosaurs in a petting zoo for kids  those scenes were actually not only fun, but quite touching

But the most important dinosaur is of course the ""new attraction"" which we meet quite soon in the film, in fact in the opening scene  when it hatches... The ""new attraction"" is not really a dinosaur, but an artificially created hybrid. This first glimpse indicates immediately that ""new attraction"" is mostly based on a large theropod, but we quickly learn that because Jurassic World's board of directors asked for a ""bigger, badder dinosaur, with more teeth"", it was heavily modified and ""upgraded"". I will not give more precisions here, suffice it to say that ""new attraction"" offers many surprises, some of which are revealed only in the final chapters of the film. THE IMPORTANT THING is that ""new attraction"" is a real bad@ss  it is one of the most impressive, original, surprising and DARN TERRIFYING screen monsters I saw in a long time. Creating a really good monster for an action/adventure movie, especially today when people mostly saw it all, is a real challenge and here it was met with full success. All jaded and spoiled by countless action/adventure movies that I am, I was nevertheless IMPRESSED by ""new attraction""  even more incredibly, there was one scene, when it actually SCARED ME!

Characters were quite well done in this film, on the same level as in the first ""Jurassic Park"" and actors interpreted them well too. Chris Pratt plays quite well Owen Grady, in a very masculine (definitely NOT metrosexual) way, as a kind of dashing, hunky warrior/cowboy with a heart, who is attracted by vicious, competitive, cunning, carnivorous, cold-blooded, predatory creatures - and also by raptors))) Bryce Dallas Howard plays even better a park executive named Claire, a competitive, cunning, carnivorous, cold-blooded, predatory creature, but who ultimately is NOT ENTIRELY vicious  which may be the reason why she and Owen never went beyond a first date)))

Bryce Dallas Howard was particularly well suited to play Claire as we must not forget that this girl is used to play VERY DIRTY in real life  let's not forget that after she shyamalaned her career almost to death, she used her powerful dad's influence to steal the role of Victoria in the third ""Twilight"" from Rachelle Lefevre That being said, I must admit that she aced her role in ""Jurassic World"", playing a very conceited but not really evil creature, who just needs some.. ahem loosening by the right kind of guy ))) As the film progresses, Claire lets her hair down a little, then gets dirty and finally performs an act of absolutely astounding quasi-sacrificial heroism in a wonderfully filmed, totally jaw-dropping scene All that being said, I must here confess with no little shame, that during all the film I was convinced that Claire was played by Jessica Chastain  no, seriously, I am not kidding, when the credits started to roll I had such a ""OMG, no way!"" moment, that I had to pick my jaw from the floor)))

Like in the first film, it becomes quickly easy to bond with the children characters. Teenage Zach and his younger brother Gray, the two boys who come to visit Jurassic World in the beginning of the film, are very different from Tim and Lex, but once we get to know them a little, we start to care for them. The screenwriters did a good job on those characters and young actors played them well.

There is only one character that is weaker and this is, by the way, the only weakness I could find in this film. Vic Hoskins, played by Vincent d'Onofrio, who is the annoying security guy for the company running the genetic lab, is completely unnecessary for the action of the film and everything of what he says and does simply doesn't make sense. Thanks God his screen time is not very significant  and really, deleting him completely would only make this film even better and the time so save could be devoted to show some more cute baby dinos

The scenario is quite logical, people mostly act rationally, action scenes are very good, special effects are of course wonderful, the pace of action is fast, there are many surprises and twists which are rather hard to anticipate long in advance, the ratio of ""people eaten/people not eaten"" is satisfying, there are many scenes so original and beautiful that really breath-taking and then of course there is the great finale, which is simply AMAZING!

It is such a pleasure to be finally, finally, finally surprised and impressed by a really good, original, creative and yes, ambitious action/adventure sequel/reboot. I watched this film with genuine pleasure and writing this ecstatic review (after so many one and two star ones) was even more pleasant. Kudos to the whole team who made this film and many happy returns  let's hope that Hollywood will learn something from their success. GO SEE IT WHEN IT STILL PLAYS IN THEATERS - IT IS REALLY WORTH IT!",1434326400,,8908,4.843421052631579

There are plenty of dispensable bumbling zoo keepers and army guys as well as unfortunate dinosaurs and park guests that get taken out, but even though there were many more killings these were not so gory as the death and dismemberment of Jurassic Park.

6697011,4,B00NYC65M8,"""Jurassic World"" (2015 release; 124 min.) opens ominously with several dinosaur eggs cracking open. We then get to know two brothers, Zach and Gary, who are about to leave on a one-week vacation on Costa Rica's Isla Nublar, the island home of Jurassic World. Their mom teases ""if something chases you, run!"", ha! Their aunt Claire is the Operations Manager, who had promised their mom she'd take good care of them. It's not before long that the first signs of troubles pop up. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the long-delayed fourth movie in the Jurassic franchise, stuck in ""development hell"" for years and years. If only all movies could be delayed this long, given the pretty close to brilliant results of ""Jurassic World"". One of the biggest surprises must be writer-director Colin Trevorrow, whose only other previous full-length feature was the excellent 2012 indie movie ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" (budget: less than 1 mill; box office: $4.5 mill). There is nothing that I saw in in ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" (other than talent, I suppose) that could've indicated that Trevorrow could make the jump from such a small movie to the major leagues of a mega-budget summer popcorn movie. The visuals throughout ""Jurassic World"" are sumptuous, to say the least. The movie is visual eye candy from start to finish. And the dinosaurs are bigger, stronger and louder than ever before. Beware: this movie is rated PG-13 for a reason; there is quite a bit of violent death and carnage, obviously. I would not advice to take kids under the age of 10 to see this, frankly. Oh, and there are even human actors in it too! Chriss Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, etc., but they are secondary at best to the real stars of this film (the dinosaurs). One more thing I really enjoyed in this are the subtle visual references to the very first ""Jurassic Park"" movie. Very classy.

The buzz surrounding ""Jurassic World"" has been strong, and when the initial box office numbers came in ($82 mill. just for Friday evening), jaws dropped. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was COMPLETELY sold-out, down to the very last seat. With all due respect to the comic book hero action movies that seem to overrun the theaters these days, ""Jurassic World "" is the type of summer popcorn movie that I really care to see. It's big Hollywood at its very best. Whether you've seen any of the previous Jurassic Park movies is entirely irrelevant, so head on out and enjoy ""Jurassic World"".

6697012,4,B00NYC65M8,"Well, everything.

That oily lab chief declaring that DNA composition is ""classified"", even to the park owner - doesn't that raise a handful of red flags? Then, I had to wonder about the slipshod safety procedures around the mighty predators. And, if that tranquilizer in an early scene was so good at dropping a huge beast in its tracks, I would have thought they'd use the same stuff ion an armor-piercing round when it came to the huger and much less tranquil beasts. Then there are the high heels - but we're so used to that inanity that it doesn't even call for comment any more.

There. I picked some nits. It's still a pretty good flick. Well of course they'd turn the baby dinos into kiddie-park rides. I would have begged for that when I was of kiddie-park age. And of course they'd have bean-counters dealing ion marketing-speak, and the guy who wants to turn everything iinto a weapon, and ... well, once you buy into the improbable premise and a few other bits of silliness, it really does move pretty well. Nice action, nice heroics, and great CGI dinosaurs.

BTW, it seemed like a glaring error. Yes, I can imagine the dinos being a genetic patchwork, filling in gaps in the DNA and making them ""cooler,"" but it seemed like slipshod work. Even real-life genetic engineers are pretty good at picking specific genes for specific purposes, so why were these guys getting all kinds of strange side-effects in their nucleic acid collages? Once the movie shows where loyalties lie and why, I think that objection gets answered very nicely.

And, there's plenty of sequel-bait.  But you'll see that for yourself.

6697013,5,B00NYC65M8,"To begin with, Ive never hated/disliked the previous two Jurassic sequels, not even the third movie, even though popular consensus dictates that I should. As flawed and not good as the first movie as they are, they still had their own awesome moments that made them fun, worthwhile watches. Having said all thatJurassic World puts the previous two sequels to shame, and theres no doubt in my mind that this is the worthy sequel to the classic original that most fans had waited for. Michael Giachinnos score is magnificent, the writing is solid, the pacing is nearly perfect, the acting is great, the dinosaurs are as gorgeous as ever, the climax takes the word kickass and cranks it to 11there is just too many noteworthy things of what this movie got right. Im even so far as conflicted as deciding whether this movie is possibly even better than the first movie, but Ill need more time before figuring that out.

One of the things I liked best was that the dinosaurs were back to being portrayed as the animals they were in the first movie, rather than monsters with exclusive thirst for human flesh. Based on the trailers alone people didn't seem to like how the raptors would be depicted, but ask this fan and I would tell you the raptors have never been more interesting. They had way more character to them than they ever had, and their story alone takes exciting turns. Even the hybrid beast itself, the Indominus Rex, wasn't a monster for the sake of being a monster. They very clearly explain that it was raised solely in captivity and alone, which has been known in real life to drive animals raised like that to go crazy. But when that insanity is mixed with the Indominuss size, ferocity and intelligence, altogether it adds up to a deadly mix that sends everything to hell. And anyone who wonders why they would foolishly make a dangerous beast like this in the first placeas it turns out theres a real reason it was created beyond simply making a new attraction, and reason that not all the characters are privy to. To reveal any more than that would be telling, but all Ill say is that this movie takes a very scarily realistic approach as to how and why a park like this would be created in the world as we currently know it.

Of course, its not 100% perfect. But what flaws are to be found really amount to nitpicks. For one, it was totally unbelievable to watch Bryce Dallas Howard to be running around in high heels. If shes not going to take the time to put a pair of boots on, the least the writers couldve done was have her kick them off. Sure, running around barefoot would hurt like hell in its own way, but it still wouldve been more plausible. And even though the movie is well-paced and editedI couldn't help but feel like there was way more to the story than what made it onto the screen, that it was almost a little too fast-paced. Its certainly my personal hope the blu-ray will have an extended directors cut. Im sure there may be other minor nitpicks to have, but those are the prominent ones from the top of my head.

And yes, it very clearly sets itself up for a sequel, even though this movie ends on the most perfect note imaginable. Colin Trevorrow did such a phenomenal job, its genuinely disheartening that hell have a different director take on the next movie (although he himself will remain involved, thank goodness). Either way, Im genuinely intrigued of the new direction this franchise might be taking.

Thats all Im saying. Trust me when I saysee this movie in IMAX 3D when you have the chance, if you haven't already. There are plenty of summer movies that are entertaining to watch in that format, but Jurassic World is one of the handful that actually earns it. So long as you're not a cynic looking for nothing but whats wrong with something, this is the kind of epic blockbuster that makes one feel like a kid again.

Aside from that, the new dinosaurs, old ones & the theme park and rides were all a great new way to incompass the story.

6697017,4,B00NYC65M8,"Twenty-two years after Steven Spielbergs groundbreaking Jurassic Park, and fourteen years after the less-than-stellar Jurassic Park III seemed to have killed the franchise, Jurassic World comes to restart the franchises motor.  Does it succeed? Quick Answer: YES!  This film's ending alone had the '90s child inside me jumping and screaming and I'm sure it'll be that way for many of you who grew up with the 1993 classic and was more than enough to make me ignore most of the film's short comings.

Right off the bat, Jurassic World is the first film in the franchise to show audiences what John Hammonds theme park might have looked like if not for the first films disaster, and its hard not to be impressed by what director Colin Trevorrow and his crew have put together a very impressive park. The attention to detail in Jurassic Worlds theme park setting is first rate and isn't afraid to poke fun at elements of Universal Studios own parks.  Every attraction seen in the film feels like it would be present if this were an actual place, and I wished I could buy tickets.

For the dinosaurs we have our favorites such as the T. Rex and Velociraptors from the original, and a good mix of new dinosaurs as well as ones previously featured in the series, as well as a genetic monstrosity that serves as the films antagonist.  This leads to an OUTSTANDING 20 minute dinosaur showdown that is certain to leave fans leaving

A Jurassic Park sequel would be nothing without a sweeping score, and composer Michael Giacchino does a magnificent job providing the necessary gravitas to John Williams classic theme while also making it his own.  Giacchino he manages to sprinkle some notes from Williams The Lost World score in for good measure (say what you want about Spielbergs original sequel: it had an amazing score worth calling back, especially how its used here).

Now that Ive waxed about all the reasons Jurassic Park fans need to go see Jurassic World Im going to spend a moment on those negative qualities that hold it back from a perfect rating.  Please keep in mind that I say the following critiques as a fan and that I'm still giving Jurassic World a full recommendation to see in theaters.  Okay?  Okay...

What do you think of when you think of Jurassic Park?  Aside from dinosaurs your probably think of the amazing special effects that still hold up 20+ years later.  While I do love seeing dinosaurs back on the screen, Id be lying if I said I was very impressed by Jurassic Worlds special effects. This is sadly yet another film that uses computer generated effects as a crutch rather than a tool.  As is, Jurassic Worlds effects are servicable, and do provide two or three great scenes (especially the jaw dropping climax), but overall these are the sort of effects that'll feel dated within five years (and a few such as helicopter crash already seem spotty even at release).

Another weakness in Jurassic World are its characters.  Dont get me wrong, no one gives a bad performance.  In fact, most every actor, even the two kids, do remarkably well (Chris Pratt especially continues to prove himself as one of Hollywoods new leading men), but the script doesnt provide emotional moments that resonated with me half as strong as those in Spielbergs original.  When the film does go for emotions it feels forced and made me yearn for it to cut back to the dinosaurs.  These subplots don't take up much time, so they don't detract too much from the fun, but I still left feeling a handful could have been cut without negatively impacting the film.

Theres also a subplot featuring Vincent DOnofrio as a gung ho we go weaponized these dinosaurs villain who seemed to have walked out of a Saturday morning cartoon was especially distracting for me as a viewer.  Basically, this mercenary group that is a part of InGen from the original films wishes to create these genetic hybrids for military application, but Chris Pratts character says its a bad idea and- who am I kidding?  Weve all seen this plot before and I sincerely hope this isn't going to become the primary narrative in Jurassic Worlds sequel honestly, this entire subplot with DOnofrio and Dr. Wu (returning from the first film as a sort of mad scientist) makes me fear that the human-dinosaur hybrid script we heard was scrapped 5 years ago is going to return.

Do these flaws (or ""nitpicks"" as I'm sure many will call them) kill Jurassic World?  Of course not!  Jurassic World's a blast to watch for any fan of the original and is certain to be one of the best popcorn films of 2015 if you go in with the right expectations.  If you go in expecting to have your mind blown the same way audiences in 1993 were by Spielbergs original OF COURSE you're setting yourself up for disappointment.  The original is one of the greatest blockbusters of all time and even Spielberg himself wasn't able to recapture the magic of the original.  But, if you just want a fun film that caters to your childhood obsession with dinosaurs and the first film Jurassic World is certain to entertain!

I recommend you spare no expense, buy a large popcorn, and enjoy the ride that is Jurassic World.",1434240000,,5155,4.681818181818182
6697018,5,B00NYC65M8,"I wish I could give more stars. This film really took me by surprise. Had some insane twists & turns. You have basically a monster in the water, a monster hybrid on land, your raptors, and of course, the BIG T. I was glad they brought some of the first original film back into play. I was mostly amazed by the raptors and the role they took for this film. Imagine being able to control an animal that hunts for sport, and is so fast, and lethal. What took me by surprise was towards the last chapter or so of the film as far as the cover of this film is concerned. I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen the film yet, so get your ass to a theater asap. :D

Chris Pratt is an amazing actor. His role for this film was spectacular. I am surprised Jeff Goldblum didn't have a cameo or anything though. Overall, I was in tears of joy. Nature sure is full of surprises, but this movie proves that nature is awesome. I actually hope that they improve attractions around the world to teach us more about dinosaurs, & to understand their Jurassic World. :)

6697020,5,B00NYC65M8,"Amazing summer blockbuster! Jurassic Park has been replaced by Jurassic World, owned by the Masrani Corporation. The corporation believes that in order to keep public interest, it must not only recreate the past, but also innovate. Therefore, its lab (lead by Dr. Wu from InGen) creates a hybrid dinosaur, the Indominus Rex, which is kept alone in a high-security pen after showing early signs of being a killing machine. Later in the movie, the audience learns the corporation has another motive for creating such a dinosaur (I'm not going to spoil it!)
As the safety precautions surrounding the new dino are being tested, Claire, the busy park operations manager, is visited at Jurassic World by her two nephews. Chaos ensues when the new dino learns how to trick her captors and escape her pen just as the two nephews decide to go off-roading from an exhibit.
The special effects are so excellent in this movie, I felt like I was watching real dinosaurs. I've heard  some critics have posted negative rewiews about this movie and I really can't understand why- this movie was a hit for me and worth the wait.

There is no small brain in this giant T-Rex like Dino as it out-thinks the humans at every turn, sparking lots of dinosaur chaos one more time in the theme park of Dinosaurs. Chris Pratt, a Raptor trainer, gives a convincing performance in his urgent goal to stop the new dinosaur at all costs.

6697023,4,B00NYC65M8,"As a moviegoer, one has to truly appreciate the spectacle that is the 1993 film Jurassic Park. After numerous production delays, Jurassic Park 4(as it was then called) went through different rewrites and directors; as director Colin Trevorrow eventually would be the director of the film. After a decade of rumors and production delays, it is safe to say that Jurassic World was well worth the wait.

A plane ride and later a boat ride to the familiar island of Isla Nublar just off Costa Rica's coast, takes the two brothers Zach and Gray to Jurassic World to visit their Aunt Claire who just so happens to be the manager of the park. Later we meet Owen Grady a guy who trains the 'Velociraptors, and Claire later meets with Owen to convince him to look for vulnerabilities in the 'Indominus rex. Upon arrival however, it seems that the 'Indominus rex has escaped.

Chris Pratt has become a very popular celebrity and rightfully so. As Owen Grady, Pratt brings his usual humor and charm; while also making Owen the guy you root for throughout the course of the movie. Bryce Dallas Howard also does a really wonderful job in Jurassic World as the operation manager Claire; she's not only easy on the eyes but she shares some good chemistry alongside Pratt. Ty Simpkins(who you may remember as Harley from Iron Man 3) and Nick Robinson star as brothers Zach and Gray and do a nice job(especially Ty Simpkins), while Omar Sy stars in a supporting role as Barry alongside Vincent D'Onofrio who plays Vic Hoskins.

In terms of story, I really enjoyed how Jurassic World feels like a sequel to the other movies; while also having notable references to the original. Not once did I get bored during the runtime of Jurassic World, and while I won't call this one better than the original, Jurassic World proves to be a worthy addition to the Jurassic Park trilogy, thanks to the actors/actresses, the direction of Colin Trevorrow, how well Jurassic World is able to be its own movie while still acknowledging the original, and the humor and thrill of the story. Take your kids, take your friends, take your ENTIRE family, GO SEE Jurassic World because it is

6697025,4,B00NYC65M8,"The Jurassic Park franchise  while beloved, doesnt exactly have the greatest of batting averages. While it started with one of the greatest action-adventure films of the 90s in 1993s Jurassic Park, the installments which followed have been less than stellar, 1997s flawed The Lost World: Jurassic Park and 2001s abysmal Jurassic Park III.

Fourteen years later, Universal Pictures has brought us a fourth installment of the dinosaur franchise, and Im very happy to say that while imperfect, Jurassic World is an absolute theatrical thrill ride, and a joy to watcheven if it doesnt stand up to analysis afterwards.

Set twenty-two years after the original film (and apparently ignoring the events of the two sequels), Jurassic World sees the dream of the late John Hammond realized. Funded by billionaire Simon Masrani (Irrfan Kahn), Jurassic Park has become the full-blown Jurassic World, an immense theme park located in Isla Nubar. Overseen by Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard, not Jessica Chastain) the park has been an incredible success  but attendance has started to stagnate. In turn, the park, alongside genetic manipulation partner InGen, decides to develop a brand new dinosaur  a fierce creature called an Indominus Rex.

Of course, since this IS a Jurassic movie, things go terribly wrong  and its on the same day that Clares nephews, Zach and Grey (Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins) are in the park! Our only hope? Ex-Navy dinosaur trainer Owen Grady (Chris Pratt, who continues to have the coolest career path ever), who, along with his team of trained raptors look to stop the I-Rex and save the day before thousands are killed!

The stakes are high  and thankfully for Summer movie fans, the action completely delivers. Jurassic World, perhaps more than any other installment in the franchise, is build entirely around incredible dino action, and each set piece is more and more fun, silly and ridiculous than the last. Youll pop out of your seat, youll laugh, and youll cheer as Pratt and co battle their way through sheer paleolithic pandemonium.

The movie isn't without its bumps and bruises of course  certain characters feel completely inessential to the film, and there are a good two or three plotlines that are left open or unresolved. Heck, even the main cast isn't as fleshed out as the cast of the original film, with most actors admirably filling the shoes of different archetypes, such as Alpha Male, Overworked Strong Female, Cool Older Brother and Weird Younger Brother. The notable exception to this is New Girls Jake Johnson, who plays a Jurassic Park fanboy who also doubles as one of the parks operators in a sarcastic, silly version of Samuel L. Jacksons role in the original Park.

In other films, this archetype heavy structure would be a problem, but it may be a part of the overall meta-commentary of the film, which seems to point a finger at movie audiences thirst for sequels from frame number one. Corporate felt genetic modification would up the wow factor. is a quote which probably describes both the movie-making process for Jurassic World and the plot-line here, but even with that self-awareness, Jurassic World excels as a thrilling, Summer romp.

Director Colin Trevorrow may only be making his second film with World, following the quirky-indie film Safety Not Guaranteed, but he proves as a solid not-quite-Spielberg here, with the movie feeling large in scope, but personal in nature. You can really feel the majesty of the park in each shot, and you are thrust into the fear of our heroes when things break bad.

Starting with many corporate sponsors, a little bit of back story, and then a whole bunch of excitement, Jurassic World fits perfectly as an amusement park ride of a movie. The film may not be as great as Jurassic Park was (the movie even seems to agree with this idea during its third act), but its certainly worth taking a trip to.",1434240000,2,3903,4.957120980091884

so-called film critics tore the movie down. Anyone going into any movie with the intent to tear it apart can easily do so. I went in with no pre-conceived ideas and just sat back and enjoyed a great summer blockbuster.

Whats it about?

A theme park filled with living dinosaurs has put its chaotic past behind it and has been open for years, but their newest creation may be more than they can safely contain.

What did I think?

Its impossible to measure up to the original Jurassic Park. It showed us movie monsters that wed never seen before that reignited interest in the field of palaeontology. This script tries to out-do its predecessor with some truly absurd concepts. The strangest thing is that they all manage to work. The characters make some dumb decisions but the universe logic is tight and the action thick and visceral.

6697030,4,B00NYC65M8,"Theatrical review.  Potential spoilers.  It's been over 20 year since ""Jurassic Park"" (1993) opened and this park, now called Jurassic World, is the replacement.  The filmmakers essentially ignore the events provided in the first and second sequel.  I suspect that might stretch credibility even further as to why this idea is still viable, given the death and destruction afflicted in ""Lost World: Jurassic Park"" (1997) and ""Jurassic Park III"" (2001).  And perhaps that was my problem going in.  Why would they create this idea and park again?  Not from a movie making perspective, mind you.  Dino's have proven to be dangerous.  But here we are back on Isla Nublar near Costa Rica.

The new park has been opened 10 years without incident, but the vacationers are getting bored with the dino petting zoo, the live dino kiddie rides and looking at giant sea creatures leap out of a large pool, ala Sea World.  They want something bigger, meaner and ""with more teeth.""  And so do the owners, not to mention the potential for the military industrial complex.  The latter is especially interested in velociraptors which are being ""trained"" by dino-rounder, Owen Grady (Chris Pratt).  The park is being run by Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) who once had a brief affair with Owen.

Claire's 2 nephews, Zach (Nick Robinson) and Gray (Ty Simpkins) show up for a tour under Claire's wing, but she's too busy and outsources the job to an underling.  Remember when I mentioned the idea of creating a bigger, meaner dino.  Well, they have.  She's part T-Rex and part secret ingredient that isn't revealed until the final act when she, Indominous Rex, escapes her pen.  This was the first problem I had.  Using the old Spielberg ""Jaws"" trick, we only get glimpses of Ms. Rex early on.  And she appears to be Godzilla size, not just another T-Rex on steroids with crooked teeth.

Considerable time is spent with the 16 and 11 year old nephews.  The filmmakers remember who their audience is.  They get lost and in the wild.  So Claire must reluctantly get help from Owen to find them.  I would have liked to see a bit more humor in the film but this couple play it pretty straight.  I did chuckle when Owen and Claire are on the run from Indominous, and run through a door that is separating them from the oncoming dino.  Owen holds out his hand to ""help"" the slower running Claire, but she just runs right past him.  Jake Johnson and Lauren Lapkus play characters who work in the control room and they get in a few funny lines.

So what makes the film worth a ticket?  Well, the dinosaurs of course.  They all look great.  In another great scene right out of Hitchcock's ""The Birds,"" a bevy of Pterodactyls get loose wreaking havoc on the unsuspecting tourists.  The final act really gets going with some suspenseful chases and a big dino battle.  ""Jurassic World"" honors the great original, but is no competition as a movie.  Still, it is certainly better than ""Lost World"" and more than the equal to ""III.""  See it.

BLU RAY UPDATE
I took another look at this blockbuster from the summer of 15.  This time on a 3-D Blu ray disc.  My original comments remain germane including the criticism I had about the lack of humor between Clair (Howard) and Owen (Pratt).  Interestingly enough included in the Special Features are several deleted scenes.  And wouldnt you know they include several between the two.  All cute and all humorous.  There is another deleted scene where an explanation is provided regarding Indominous Rexs camouflage abilities.  In the original film, I think it may have been mentioned once then ignored.  I never quite understood how the fleeting comment applied.  So yeah, these additional scenes, which probably total a minute or two, should have been in the original cut.  The 3-Dness of the disc is just how I like it.  Reserved and used primarily for added depth.  Like all 3-D films, it appears a little darker than what I would like but is certainly watchable.  My other complaint about 3-D films has to do with the handling of near-the-camera objects.  This can include stationary object or people.  I only noticed one scene where a vehicles tire took up a quarter of the screen.  It was brief and not repeated.  The transfer comes with a 1080p video resolution and an unusual 2.00:1 aspect ratio.  The visuals are top-notch with excellent black levels, great color and skin-tone appearance.  Excellent imaging including plenty of up close and personal dino detail.  Nearly perfect as is the great DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 track.  There are numerous and thunderous dino stomps throughout the film which is to be expected.  But Ive noticed these better audio tracks make the sounds more inclusive to the overall soundtrack.  I guess what Im saying is that while they standout, so does the entire mix unlike earlier efforts.  Demo quality.  There are subtitles available in French, Spanish and English SDH.  The package includes a 2-D disc, a DVD and a digital copy.  Here are the extras:

6697031,2,B00NYC65M8,"Nine Things About the Movie ""Jurassic World""

1. This is what I call a recipe movie. It blindly follows a predictable and overused formula without even trying to hide what its doing, or attempting to spice things up. This is a blatant cash-grab, capitalizing on bored summer kids and the tendency for parents to want to show their children things that they liked growing up. The fact that the movie was written and directed by a guy (who nobody has heard of) that has only made one film before this (which nobody has heard of), just makes my point.

2. Lets jump back in time to 1993: Jurassic Park is about an island that was turned into a cloned dinosaur theme park by a millionaire. The millionaire wants to make sure everything is safe, so he gets a couple of experts to look around. The millionaires grandkids are there; one of them knows a lot about dinosaurs and talks too much. Theres a subplot about an employee that wants to take dinosaur embryos for a corporation. The dinosaurs are smarter than the humans realize, and they escape. The kids are stranded in the park, and the dinosaur expert has to go rescue them. Theres a pack of velociraptors that chase them, get into a building, and have a fight with a T-Rex. The T-Rex roars at the end.

Now come back to today (if you are really worried about spoilers, skip to #4): Jurassic World is about an island that was turned into a cloned dinosaur theme park by a millionaire. The operations manager wants to make sure everything is safe, so she gets a dinosaur expert to look around. The operation managers nephews are there; one of them knows a lot about dinosaurs and talks too much. Theres a subplot about an employee that wants to take dinosaurs for the military. The dinosaurs are smarter than the humans realize, and they escape. The kids are stranded in the park, and the dinosaur expert has to go rescue them. Theres a pack of velociraptors that chase them, get into a building, and have a fight with a T-Rex/velociraptor hybrid. The T-Rex joins the fight. The T-Rex roars at the end.

3. As if just repeating the plot of Jurassic Park isn't enough, when the movie isn't sure what to do, they actually go to the original Jurassic Park. Literally. Luckily, the young teenagers know how to fix an abandoned 1992 Jeep, so they can drive a car from the original movie around the island.

4. There are a few differences between the movies. In the original, they were just cloning dinosaurs. In this one, they are creating new ones, hybrids that have never actually existed. This is useful for the filmmakers, since they had no intention of following science, logic, or reality.

5. In the first movie, the soaring theme music reaches its peak when the kids see real live dinosaurs on the horizon. In this movie, the same soaring theme music reaches its peak when the kids enter a Hilton hotel and look out the balcony to see the rides on the horizon.

6. Chris Pratt is actually a good actor. But in this movie, he has the emotional range of a dinosaur egg. Seriously, the computerized velociraptors show more feeling than Pratt does. It seems like Pratt is only in the park (and in the movie) because hes getting paid.

7. There are cheap, meaningless scenes where characters struggle with romance and divorce that don't have anything to do with anything. I think they were supposed to be there for character development, but they were clearly added in just because the films recipe said add character development.

8. Not only is the climax unoriginal, its actually stupid. It breaks all the rules it set up for itself previously in the film. It makes no sense. I actually, physically, facepalmed myself.

9. There are a few clever and funny moments in the movie. And its kind of a game to catch all the references to the first movie hidden throughout this one. But bad cooks can ruin good recipes, and thats what happened here.

However, it doesnt matter. There are plenty of people that will like this movie just fine. After all, it has all the necessary ingredients - even if they're stale.",1434153600,31,4058,4.5911602209944755

It's very action-packed, suspenseful, has the right amount of comedy and some great nostalgia for fans of the original. Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard and Jake Johnson made great new characters. I became very invested in the characters, and even some of the Dinosaurs. Throughout the majority of the movie, I kept thinking they were missing a great opportunity, and when they hinted at it and it finally happened, I was almost in tears because my wish came true, but I won't dare ruin it for you. Let's just say the final battle is incredibly epic!

22 years after the events of Jurassic Park, it has been renamed to Jurassic World and is finally a fully functioning theme park with Dinosaurs, which was John Hammond's vision. The visitor rates are declining, so they make a new genetically modified dinosaur called the Indominus Rex. Indominus is probably the meanest toughest smartest Dinosaur throughout the entire Jurassic Park series. Owen Grady (Pratt) tries to hunt it down after it escapes her enclosure.

6697035,4,B00NYC65M8,"It's twenty-two years since Jurassic Park, and the reopened dinosaur theme park on an island off Costa Rica is full of tourists. The owners think it needs something new to keep it fresh. Why don't the scientists mix some DNA in the lab and create a big new crowd-pleasing predator, a T-Rex on steroids? But what happens when the new predator, the Indominus Rex, turns out to be smart enough to get out of its special paddock, in a park that is supposed to be totally safe?

That's the familiar premise of Jurassic World. Fortunately, it is an exciting adventure story that manages to be more than the standard Jurassic Park special effects. Dallas Bryce Howard is Claire Denning, the Park's busy operations manager, who happens to be hosting her two nephews Gray and Zach at the park. Chris Pratt is terrific as Owen Grady, ex-Navy and trainer of raptors for a military experiment about to go wrong. He and Claire will have to team up to save her nephews and try to contain Indominus Rex.

""Jurassic World"" has all the elements of a classic monster flick, including hubristic scientists messing with nature, some exciting chase scenes (Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins do a nice job as the two nephews, loose in the park), and a decent little danger-driven romance between Claire and Owen. No intellectual heavy-lifting here, but the movie is fun and entertaining. Recommended.",1434153600,4,1374,4.817796610169491
6697036,2,B00NYC65M8,"Director to Chris Pratt:  ""Remember what you did for Guardians of the Galaxy?  The audience liked it.  Do that again.""

Chris Pratt just confirmed his one-dimensional acting ability, he's the new Ryan Reynolds.

This film was completely over-saturated with pointless subplots.  The military's weaponization of velociraptors was just about the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen.  There was no mention as to how order was restored to the original park.  The characters of the film were completely forgettable.  In fact, after viewing the film, I couldn't recall any of their names.  The only reason the children were necessary in the film is because you can't make a Jurassic Park movie without clich children that obviously are going to live.  Other than that, they were meaningless.

The setting of the film was all wrong with most of it taking place during broad daylight, then in the blink of an eye, it was instantly nighttime with absolutely no transitional period.  The character's cell phones and radios worked perfectly when it didn't matter, but then for no reason, transmissions were scrambled or cut-out at the precise time when the director needed to build suspense.  What's even worse than this abomination of a film is that grown adults are giving it great reviews.  Do people not pay attention to plot anymore?  And because the general audience is too dumb to know any better, this movie will make a boat-load of cash which will only queue up sequel after sequel.",1434153600,4,1480,4.979591836734694

6697038,3,B00NYC65M8,"It is rare that the fourth in a series measures up to the first, and with JURASSIC WORLD this saying still holds true. Twenty years ago, JURASSIC PARK set the tone, theme, and tenor of a dinosaur theme park.  The second and third did not materially improve on the first and now with JURASSIC WORLD, the primary difference between it and its predecessors lies in giving the dinosaurs a distinguishable personality. We learn that after the debacles of the first three, dinosaur island has somehow amazingly stayed open for business as a sort of petting zoo.  But after nearly two decades of watching dinosaurs up close and personal, the entire concept of a Jurassic beast has become rather ho-hum.  Into this void of human dis-interest comes the bottom line; there is a need for more boffo dinosaurs, and genetic re-splicers led by B. D. Wong (from LAW AND ORDER) are only too willing to oblige. Wong cultivates a hybrid Indominus Rex monster, one that was crafted from a variety of carnivores.  We are told that Indominus is a highly intelligent beastie that is quite capable of laying a trap to divert more intelligent humans. Unfortunately, Indominus still behaves like any other T-Rex.  And it is here that JURASSIC WORLD cannot distance itself from its predecessors.

Essentially, the closed universe of dinosaur island plays out like a rerun from JURASSIC PARK I, II, and III. We see dinosaurs free to roam an impossibly large island.  The scriptwriters wisely chose to ignore the needs of carnivores that would otherwise necessitate an island as big as Australia to house sufficient herbivores to serve as food. The script adds little to viewer interest.  Many of the plot devices of the first are herein re-used, even to the point of a faceoff at the end between the hero and children and a trio of raptors. The director adds the novel idea of creating a sense of loyalty and obedience in these raptors between obeying the orders of the hero (Chris Pratt) and eating him. In all four of the series, the dominant theme is human beings may create killing machines but not control them. This, of course, fits it with a variety of other films that center on Things Man Was Not Meant to Know.  For fans of the series who delight in seeing the many ways that carnivorous dinosaurs escape from their cages to devour victims, JURASSIC WORLD is worth the price of admission.  For those who seek a new vision of human/dinosaur interaction, they must wait for a film that may never come.",1434153600,3,2482,4.751162790697674
6697039,5,B00NYC65M8,"Where do I begin with this awesome movie? It's AMAZING! And I never thought I'd say it, but I enjoyed it more than the original. The CG is awesome, the casting is awesome, the plot is the best and it's climax is not predictable at all. Also, in response to many one star reviewers, this is NOT a remake. It's a sequel. I don't get why people keep saying that. The Raptor Squad is so badass and epic, the T Rex is better than ever, the Mosasaur is AWESOME, the Indominus is even more deadly than the Raptors, the whole thing is just AMAZING! If I had the money, I'd see it ten times at the movies!

Don't listen to any bad reviews, this is an AMAZING movie that beats Jurassic Park 3, The Lost World and yes, the first original classic.",1434153600,,735,4.176056338028169
6697040,5,B00NYC65M8,"JURASSIC WORLD is set 22 years after JURASSIC PARK, and the park is finally open. John Hammond's vision became a reality, but since public interest in the dinosaurs start to decline, INGEN needs a new dino that will attract attention with the phrase ""BIGGER, LOUDER AND MORE TEETH"", with them creating the hybrid dinosaur INDOMINOUS REX. Things start to go wrong when the I-REX break out causes havoc around the entire park. The film stars Chris Pratt as Owen Grady a ex-military NAVY man working in the park's Raptor Paddock, just out of Guardians of the Galaxy Pratt is outstanding in this movie and will become a even bigger star after this. Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire the park's manager, and her nephews are visiting the park for the weekend, BDH is great in the movie, and it's probably the best movie she's ever done. Owen and Claire had a relationship at first, but now they must put that aside to save Claire's nephews and get the park's visitors to safety. The movie also stars Jake Johnson (who very good in this movie), Vincent D'Onofrio, Omar Sy, Judy Greer, Andy Buckley, and B.D. Wong as returning as Dr Henry Wu.

JURASSIC WORLD is the most action packed of all the JURASSIC PARK movie, with a perfect mixture of practical and special effect. When the nephew arrive to the park, the movie is playing John William's original score which was perfect. The movie also references the original JURASSIC PARK heavily and there's a great part of the movie that will give you nostalgia. And the INDOMINOUS REX is full of great surprises that I won't spoil, including amazing finale.

If you loved the original JURASSIC PARK you'll deeply enjoy this movie, and it's way better than THE LOST WORLD and JURASSIC PARK 3

6697042,2,B00NYC65M8,"Excellent visual effects = one and a half stars, but Amazon doesn't allow half stars so I generously gave it two! Beyond that there is nothing to recommend this movie. This is a really dull near identical clone of the original Jurassic Park but without the original charm, believable characters or story development. In fact, its almost a parody or the original movie, and would have worked better as a parody! You can recognize all the characters from the original movie (two young kids lost during a ride though the park and being hunted by dinosaurs. Trying to save them is the distraught aunt (park manager or something, not sure what her job is supposed to be but she seems too incompetent and ditsy to run a lemonade stand let alone a theme park). The guy trying to steal the frozen embryos (Yawn!). The hero who frustratingly keeps losing his gun at the worst possible moment and never actually uses it when the opportunity presents itself, thus delaying a simple resolution of the plot to allow for another 30 minutes of scurrying about hiding beneath cars and behind tables. All the original elements are there without any cohesive or developed story line this time round. I.E. Every moment is predictable! It's as if the director decided that well you all know the original story so lets just take it as read and just have 90 minutes of people being chased and eaten by dinosaurs!! By the time the audience realizes they have been coned it will be too late! My 12 year old son loved it! My wife and I were bored stiff! The baby behind us cried all the way though the movie (who brings a baby to a movie theater)? The old guy next to me laughed hysterically all the way through!

6697046,4,B00NYC65M8,"What Jurassic World lacks in character development and plot; it makes up for just by being fun. I didn't care if the two brothers bonded or if the Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard characters got together. What makes this the best of the sequels; is the fact that it finally offered some fresh ideas to the franchise. As well as new cool dinosaurs that weren't in previous films.
  You have a dangerous new spliced DNA big bad dinosaur named the Indominious Rex, trained raptors and Vincent D'Onfrio (Full Metal Jacket) as a warmonger who wants to use raptors as a weapon of war. D'Onfrio also wants to run the park so he can especially have control over what's done with the Raptors.
  My only problems were that Bryce Dallas Howard having no time for her nephews reminded me of Hammond in the first film with his grandchildren. Henry Wu (BD Wong) feels like an evil twin of his character in the first film. He created the Indominious Rex because his boss wanted something big and bad to get more guests. Which he delivered with no guilt that it escaped and is killing people.
  Despite those minor problems I had with it and the kids being kind of annoying. The line ""Let them Fight"" from last year's Godzilla is more fitting for this movie. Since it doesn't shy away from dinosaurs battling it out or pan away from the action like Godzilla frustratingly did. The dinosaur action is at it's best and you don't have kids killing raptors with their gymnastics ""like in Lost World."" So in closing I strongly recommend this movie.",1434067200,,1530,4.586080586080586
6697047,3,B00NYC65M8,"Jurassic Park is one of my favorite books and the first movie is a beloved classic for many reasons. The second two movies were trash. We bit the bullet, fell for the hype and spent real cash in the theater for the first showing at the 1pm matinee today of Jurassic World. I wasn't sure if this was just a reboot of the original movie or some mish mash of that and some newer special effects for the 3-D audience. The plot is the same as the first movie - two kids lost in the park, rowdy big predatory dinosaur on the loose, man & woman with loose romantic connection trying to rescue them before big dino or raptors get them. There are a couple of very minor changes and new dinosaurs. There was plenty of very bad acting throughout - primarily from the very stiff leading lady,  Bryce Dallas Howard. Chris Pratt was fine, but watching him try to salvage scenes with her was almost sad.

Had the plot centered on Pratt and his work with the Velociraptor pack, leaving out the entire romantic subplot with the Claire character and the ridiculous, go nowhere InGen military secret weapon subplot entirely, this would have been an awesome movie. As it was, we and others in the theater were groaning out loud and laughing at some of the more preposterous ""abilities"" of the newest dinosaur in the park. Additionally, entire scenes were almost direct replays of scenes from the first movie - that felt like a loving tip of the hat the first time and just weird the third time. Honestly, don't pay premium theater prices to see this. The special effects and CGI are worth the $7 matinee price, but no more.
