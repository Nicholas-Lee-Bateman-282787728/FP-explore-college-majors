841984,5,6304304218,"This is an example of semi-historical Dr Who at its best.  There is a grown-up and interesting storyline, the appearance of a famous character from human history (in this case George Stephenson), the setting is charming and realistic, and the sets look great.  The scenes between the three Time Lords (the Doctor, the Master and the Rani) are well-written, the bickering between them providing touches of amusement, and there is a genuinely gripping cliff-hanger.",972518400,12,463,5.243243243243243
841985,4,6304304218,"The Rani, an exiled time lord scientist, has quietly been infiltrating humanity over millenia:  Trojen wars, Luddite Riots, America's Independence  War, et cetera...  she becomes involved in the Master's latest attempt to  kill the Doctor as the Master is blackmailing her with a vial of fluid she  has been collecting.
The master is back and is in production-continuity  order.  (the last 4 years of the show, the Master comes back and nobody  wants to explore the idea that the Master could have died at one encounter  but thanks to time travel the Doctor can meet him before he dies!)
There  are some historical dating problems, but history itself is usually falsely  written anyway and this is *entertainment* and *science fiction*.
The  Doctor is arguably at his best here and somehow is a more interesting  adversary for the Master than the 5th Doctor.
The Rani is cool and calm  and pokes great fun at the Doctor/Master rivalry and it's brilliant.
Get  some wine and sit back, it's not an action piece but does indeed  entertain.
Oh, and check out the Rani's TARDIS interior.  Definitely a  highlight given the show's low budget...",963532800,9,1138,4.9

A shame some  people just don't 'get it' but they probably weren't around for the hey day  of the show anyway and preferred the more MTV style added into the McCoy  adventures.

842180,2,6304304218,"Sigh... Maybe if it was a different writer... or only one episode long... maybe 'The Mark of the Rani' could have succeeded. This story is one with a lot of mixed opinions on it. Some love it, some hate it. I fall into the latter category. The plot is interesting enough, and the Rani has some wonderful potential as a villain. The production is great, the direction is surprisingly brilliant, and there's a terrific atmosphere. But the one problem with 'The Mark of the Rani' is this: It's. So. DULL! The script and pacing just cripple any potential this story had for being good. The entire story just feels like one 25 minute episode stretched out to two 45 minute episodes, and - gosh, this story is just so boring! I can't even think of one noteworthy event from episode one. It's padded beyond belief! But I could forgive this if the script were any good. But it wastes its great premise and potential on unnecessary plot points and introducing characters that have no effect on the story whatsoever. I could go on and on, but suffice it to say that 'The Mark of the Rani' is a boring, plodding, direly written story that I do not recommend. 4/10",1398124800,,1152,4.516746411483253

I started watching the old Who stories and decided to start my dvd collection with the Sixth doctor.  My wife and I and the kids had so much fun watching this serial.  The Rani and the Master are at the top of their acting game.  The story is fun and the Doctor has some great one liners.  Peri is terrible, but it really doesn't matter.

842288,5,6304304218,"Again I buy a DVD of the Sixth Doctor, & again I'm surprised how underrated I find him to be.  This is even better Vengeance On Varos.  He's not my favorite Doctor, but he will be in my top 10 Doctors at least.  He may be a little arrogant at times, but you see how he really wants to help, especially when he put himself at risk by going undercover.  However, I found Peri to be probably my least favorite companion.  Whining & trying to get the Doctor to leave, that was annoying.  But apart from her this was a great story.  Any episode with the Master is good, and this was no exception.  And the titular Rani, an exiled Time Lord- er Lady, was great.  Her arguments with the Master had me laughing out loud.  Oh, and I loved how the Doctor manipulated them a couple times.  He reminded me of the Seventh Doctor, a favorite of mine.  And the bombs that turn people into trees may sound silly, but it's actually a pretty creepy concept.  I once had a dream about people being turned into flowers that was a little graphic so it really struck a chord with me.

That's why I bought ""The Mark of the Rani"", but unlike ""Time"", ""Mark"" is very boring to sit through. The actors are excellent - even Colin Baker through most of the story. The special effects are pretty good. The production values shine, and even the plot is good. It's just the script itself. It's very much lacking in action and excitement. I had a hard time sitting through it. And part one's cliffhanger is a joke. But still it does have things to offer as I pointed out earlier which is why I'm giving it two stars instead of one.

Although rumour has it that Anthony Ainley was put out at having the villian Rani be percieved as having the upper hand, it was an absolutely great script, well acted by all.  It has wonderful historical elements, and is among the best overall Who episodes.  A funny sidebar:  watch for the scene in which Colin rubs dirt on his face to blend in with the workers.  In real life, the crew had placed ""clean"" dirt down for him.  While during a break, one of the dogs relieved himself in it.  Colin rubs dirt combined with dog pooh on his face.

I just wish that john nathan turner didn't take over as producer for doctor who in the early eighties perhaps colin bakers potrayal of the doctor would have lasted longer without all those problems at the bbc.,1191974400,2,581,4.290909090909091
842390,5,6304304218,"In most Doctor Who fandom quarters, Colin Baker as the Sixth Doctor is revered as the least favorite incarnation of the time traveling Gallifreyan. I am not of that opinion.  His obnoxious, demeaning attitude reminds the viewer that the Doctor is not human and as such will not have human characteristics.

I was waiting for this one to come out for a long time.  It was top on my list of Colin Baker stories to get on DVD and I picked it up on the day it was released (although I am reviewing it a year later).  The idea of yet another renegade Time Lord like the Rani skirting around the Universe appeals to me. Kate O'Mara makes the role her own.  And to top it all off, she teams up (reluctantly) with the Master.  So now the Doctor has two enemies to fight and this one is in a 19th Century setting. The Historical Whos always look good.

I love the Sixth Doctor's incredulous reaction to seeing the Rani for the first time while he's strapped to an operating table. For some reason that scene always makes me laugh.  Then there is the final scene when the Doctor and Peri disappear into the vast unknown.  ""What do you do in there?""  Doctor: ""Argue...mainly.""  What a kick.

The extras aren't extraordinary on this DVD but they're still enjoyable, particularly the ""Making of"" documentary.  I also enjoy the Then and Now location pieces that find their way onto these DVD's like in this case.",1187913600,,1398,4.478260869565218
842391,5,6304304218,"As a story, ""Mark of the Rani"" is all over the place. Well, in a way. Every bit of the action takes place in or around a single coal mine in Killingworth, England, some time during the early 1800's--the very cusp of the Industrial Revolution. And the plot is fairly straightforward, too: The Rani, a renegade Time Lord scientist, is going about her own business performing unethical medical experiments on Earthlings when along come the Master and the Doctor, the one trying to force her into an alliance, the other trying to stop her after discovering her cruel if clinically efficient work. And yet, given such a unified setting and uncomplicated premise, all the characters involved seem to wander here and there, back and forth, around and around, endlessly criss-crossing the mine's environs--as if the writers would get dizzy if they tried to pen a straight plotline. In this case that's a plus, though, maximizing the incredibly authentic and historically accurate location shots to great advantage. ""Doctor Who"" has often benefited from BBC expertise in historical dramas, and they've done so here in spades.

Which means of course that this storyline is a pseudo-historical, an unusual genre highly characteristic of this show throughout its long and (now) continuing run--you could almost say unique to it--with a futuristic science fiction premise set in some interesting time in Earth's past (okay, more often than not England's past, but you know what they say, write what you know). ""Mark of the Rani"" is a prime example in fact, including as it does an actual historical figure as a character (George Stephenson, self-made man and engineer responsible for innovating the public use of steam locomotives on railways) and skillfully incorporating aspects of this time frame into the plot. Also characteristic of the show, this storyline includes the obligatory unconvincing special effect puzzlingly superfluous to the plot but without which the show would lose some of its charm (the tree. You'll know it when you see it).

As for the Doctor, Colin Baker is in top form in this story: wittily sarcastic and yet almost boyishly curious, benignly arrogant and yet profoundly ethical without being a boring prig about it. His rapport with Peri almost seems plausible here too, though Peri is still, well, Peri--annoying and unconvincing. The Rani on the other hand is a great character, a formidable opponent and a believably complex villain--in her own mind and according to her own standards she's doing nothing wrong and feels no more guilt about harming humans in her scientific experiments than we do about mice. Kate O'Mara gives a wonderfully superior performance here and totally brings this interesting character to life. And her Tardis is a masterpiece of design and craftsmanship (more than making up for the tree effects-wise)--funny how it follows the same basic structure as the Doctor's Tardis and yet seems like the Gallifreyan equivalent of the latest model of a Lexus to the Doctor's old beat-up '66 Dodge. Breathtakingly beautiful and yet decorated with disturbingly preserved pickled specimens--the perfect symbol of her personality. As for the Master, though, my, how the mighty have fallen. Anthony Ainley does pretty well here, not hamming it up so much as sometimes, but we've degenerated from Roger Delgado's suavely sinister mastermind and even from Ainley's scheming cackling villain who inevitably reminds me of the overdone bad guys in the early silent films to...comic relief! It's all over for you as an arch-enemy and nemesis when you're mainly there for the laughs. But there he is, the constant butt of the Rani's derisive remarks and sarcastic jokes, and by this point in the show's history the part that really stings is that she's pretty much right. He's a bungler throughout the story, and every time she's about got the Doctor and company up a creek, he screws it up somehow--making it even more comical that he persists in wondering why she doesn't want to be partners in crime!

In short, what we have here is a very Doctor-like Doctor along with his (diminished) arch-nemesis and a new renegade Time Lord (just how many are out there anyway?) in a finely crafted and well-written pseudo-historical sci-fi adventure with lots of wandering around in realistic outdoor locations and highly creative and/or authentic sets, all topped off with one really fake special effect as if to say, hey, nobody's perfect. This without doubt is quintessential ""Doctor Who""--watch and enjoy!",1186272000,4,4527,5.123139377537212
842392,4,6304304218,"I've often felt that one of the failings of ""Doctor Who"" in its later seasons, and certainly with the new series, is the lack of what are called ""historicals"". These are episodes that don't feature aliens. They don't have monsters. They just have the TARDIS Team (tm), going back in time and dealing with real people.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Aztecs/dp/B00007G1U8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who - The Aztecs</a>, ""The Romans"", ""The Highlanders"" are all examples of this.

There were many of these to start with. After the Second Doctor there aren't very many at all. There was one with the Fifth Doctor (I don't recall the name), but that's all.

""The Mark of the Rani"" is not a true historical. It does feature alien baddies (The Master and the Rani in her first of two appearances), but otherwise it's as close as we can get to a historical.

The story centers around the Luddites. They were people who saw technology as something to be feared, because it was take their jobs and leave them destitute. Nowadays we refer to such technophobes as... well, technophobes. They are well-known in England but generally not known in the rest of the world.

The Doctor and Peri arrive in the middle of a minor uprising by these good folk. The Rani is there causing trouble in her own little amoral way. The Master is there... because... er... well, why the heck is he there? Best guess: Anthony Ainley had a contract. On the plus side the Rani gets in one good, swift kick that might go a long way to explaining much of the Master's attitude later.

The story is good, the acting is good (I've always admired the chemistry between Peri and the 6th Doctor, who I feel is VASTLY underrated). The sets are very good. You really get the feeling of being in 19th century coal country.

The extras are interesting, particularly the commentary (wherein we hear Colin Baker bemoaning the fact that his children had no interest in ""Doctor Who"" until the new series).

Overall, this is a very high-quality DVD, like much of the rest of the ""Doctor Who"" DVDs. I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the series. Even if the 6th Doctor isn't your favorite, this one is worth seeing.",1181260800,2,2236,4.868421052631579
842393,5,6304304218,"In another review, I said that I thought The Two Doctors might be the best story from the Colin Baker era and of the DVD's I have I still think that is true, this story is a very close second.

Everything about this production is cracking, even the pantomime trees work.  Even the Master has an added dimension not seen in other stories where he is the main villain due to having to play off of Kate O'Mara's Rani character.

I suppose we see two faces of evil, the Master who relishes in committing fiendish acts for the pure joy of it, and The Rani who is a much more banal evil, only concerned with her own ends lacking both compassion and empathy for those her pure science steam rollers over.

As I said the whole story just moves at a cracking pace and the viewer is left with a feeling of satisfaction when it's all done.",1180310400,,828,4.254777070063694
842394,3,6304304218,"While this is one of the better stories from the Colin Baker era, it's subpar Doctor Who.

842395,5,6304304218,"Mark of the Rani stands out in the Colin Baker Doctor Whos.  It's direction, music, writing and acting are all superior to most of what we saw in the sixth Doctor's sadly short reign.  Colin Baker actually behaves like the Doctor in this one.  For instance, rather than strangle Peri, he is above all concerned with her welfare.

Add the Bickersons, also known as the Rani and the Master, and you've got a rollicking adventure with strong science fiction as its base.  Pay close attention to the dialogue and you'll see another hint from the Master, in his very precise insult, that the Doctor's half-human.

Extras are numerous informative and inventive.  The DVD transfer is astounding.  The audio quality is meliflous.",1171670400,3,721,4.900826446280992
842396,5,6304304218,"The final two Doctor Who DVD releases for 2006 feature the fourth and sixth Doctors in stories first broadcast in Britain in 1976 and 1985 respectively, both starring rare examples of a female `baddie' as the Time Lord's adversary. The Hand of Fear is certainly an appropriate release for this year as it neatly ties in with the most recent series of new adventures aired on the BBC this past spring. The Mark of The Rani comes from the ill-fated twenty-second season of the long running show and is certainly one of the highlights of that year's much maligned canon.

The Hand of Fear was the second story of six from season fourteen, possibly the most lauded and certainly (in terms of ratings) the most consistently popular season from the show's original twenty-six year run. It was the third to star Tom Baker as the fourth Doctor under the Production of Philip Hinchcliffe and Script Editor Robert Holmes. Joining the Doctor for the start of her fourth year in the role was Sarah-Jane Smith, the feminist journalist portrayed so brilliantly and convincingly by Elisabeth Sladen. However, Sladen only appeared in the first two stories in this season, this being her last. The script comes from Bob Baker and Dave Martin, two veteran writers on the show who generally contributed at least one script per season from 1971 to 1979. I'm not a great fan of their stories, possibly due to a personal prejudice arising from their horrendous Three Doctors script that marked the series' tenth anniversary. But The Hand of Fear is certainly strong, but for me it's one of the weaker efforts in such a stand-out season. What makes this story so memorable and perhaps so fondly remembered is that it features the departure of Sarah-Jane, at the time, the longest running consecutive companion.

Sladen is given the key role in the early episodes of this story and plays a wonderful, possessed villainess who creates havoc in a nuclear power plant. Alas though, and she admits this herself in the commentary, when not possessed, Sladen goes completely over the top and hams it up as Sarah-Jane in the rest of the story. Perhaps due to the pressure of the situation, her performance becomes quite irritating. This is redeemed almost completely in the closing moments of episode four, when having threatened to leave the Doctor, he in turn `evicts' her from the TARDIS. Their final farewell (largely scripted by the two actors themselves) is touching and moving and well worth the price of the DVD alone. The real villain of the story, Eldrad of Kastria, is played for almost two episodes by Judith Paris, and it has to be said that she pretty much steals the entire show, both in her performance and the quite fabulous costume and make-up.

Another female baddie show's up almost nine years later in The Mark of The Rani, the third story from Colin Baker's first full season as the Doctor, broadcast in the spring of 1985. Kate O'Mara takes on the role of the Rani, a villainous Time Lady, interfering with the Luddite period of Earth's history in order to carry our scientific experiments. O'Mara had worked with Baker before on the hugely popular BBC drama series The Brothers, and the chemistry between the two actors is wonderful, although alas, they spend precious little time on screen together. The supporting cast is strong in general, but alas, the two leads (Baker and Nicola Bryant) are just not suited to their characterizations, and their on screen bickering is tiresome, as is Bryant's phoney, whiney American accent and Baker's bullying Doctor. Also here to spoil things is the desperately hammy Anthony Ainley as the Doctor's other Time Lord enemy, The Master; a pantomime villain who was well past his sell-by date by this time, but was contracted to appear in all Doctor Who seasons in this era. It's a shame that the three lead performances from the regulars are so weak, as the story is certainly strong and the wonderful location filming gives the show a very much needed senses of reality. O'Mara makes up for a lot and was so successful in the role that she was invited back two years later to help kick-start Sylvester McCoy's ill-fated run as the seventh Doctor. She plays the part with conviction and humor, and is compelling enough to forgive the weaknesses of the scripting.

Both of these stories have been wonderfully restored to their original broadcast quality (or possibly even better), which in the case of The Hand of Fear is possibly not such a great thing as it now becomes a little obvious how the some of the effects with the hand are done; nuances that were missed on the lower grade video tape. The extras included on both discs are fantastic - as the Doctor Who extras always are. There are behind the scenes documentaries, interviews with the cast and crew, out-takes, deleted scenes, continuity announcements, Easter Eggs, and features from other BBC shows related to these two stories. The only minor criticism would be that the ""Changing Time"" documentary included with The Hand of Fear covers a lot of ground that isn't necessarily relevant to this story and might have been better used with other releases. But it's a great little piece regardless. The commentary from Tom Baker on this disc is completely hysterical and the actor is at his comic best, even though he recalls precious little of the actual story. He is joined by writer Bob Baker and for some episodes by Sladen, Paris and Hinchcliffe. Colin Baker, Nicola Bryant and Kate O'Mara provide an entertaining commentary on The Mark of The Rani. Alas, in both cases, a lot of the on screen production notes and the behind-the scenes documentaries cover a lot of the same ground, so there is much repetition.

With Elizabeth Sladen returning to play Sarah-Jane Smith soon on British screens in her own TV series, following her much lauded re-appearance with David Tennant's tenth Doctor earlier this year, her final story from her original run is a great reminder of the bridge between the two. It's wonderful to see her in the role again and hopefully her new adventures will be as popular as her original run.",1163203200,5,6109,4.819828408007626
842397,4,6304304218,"For fans of Colin baker's portrayal of the Doctor,having two sixth doctor episodes released on dvd in one calender year is pure joy. This episode,Mark of the Rani,is like the other five from season 22... a guiltty pleasure. With Colin Baker at the helm, doctor who was heading in the opposite direction from the previous era. It was gearing more towards an American audience;story lines were darker, the Doctor was brash and moody and clearly had issues,and ofcourse we had peri's larger than life.....""attributes"". Even today,twenty years later, I still don't understand why The Sixth Doctor did not work out.

  As for this story, Its a great period peice. the costuming is fantastic. We get to see the first meeting between the master and the sixth doctor,and we are introduced to a new time lord villian,The rani, magnificently played by Kate O'Mara;eat your heart out Joan Collins.",1153958400,3,886,5.01360544217687
842398,4,6304304218,"England, 1826--the toil and drudgery of the coal miners is emphasized with the opening elegiac music.  Jack Ward and his companions go to the bath house to wash, but suddenly, gas seeps through the walls, sending them to unconsciousness.  They reemerge alive, but with red circles under their ears, and acting violently.  They kick a food stand, knocking down its contents and a young boy.
The Doctor and Peri are en route to Kew Gardens, but the TARDIS is pulled of course to 1826.  There, they try to find the source of the time disturbance and trace it to the Rani, who like the Master is a renegade Time Lord and an old classmate.
This is a semi-historical story, as they meet George Stephenson, the engineer whose Blucher locomotive hauled coal from Killingworth colliery.  The Doctor tells Peri:  ""How would you like to meet a genius?""  She says, ""I thought I already had.""
The Rani, who has been taking the brain fluid enabling men to sleep throughout history, treats humans as ""walking heaps of chemicals.""  ""There's no place for the soul in her scheme of things.""  Result:  the men become restless and violent.  When the Doctor argues that humans haven't done any harm to her, she counters with:  ""They're carnivores.  What harm have the animals in the fields done them, the rabbits they snare?... Do they worry about the lesser species when they sink their teeth into a lamb chop?""  Point to the Rani there.  She's so callous, the Doctor angrily tells her ""They should never have exiled you.  They should have locked you in a padded cell!""
The Master is also here.  Not only has he improved his compressor so that its victim totally vanishes, he wants to use the Rani's skills to continue his feud with the Doctor.  The Rani has nothing but contempt for the Master and even mocks the rivalry between them:  ""It obsesses you to the exclusion of all else."",  ""You're unbalanced--no wonder why the Doctor always outwits you.""  She even says of his schemes:  ""It'd be something devious and overcomplicated.  He's be dizzy if he tried to walk in a straight line.""  Indeed, the Master is a bumbler here compared to the clever and efficient Rani.  I wouldn't want to tangle with the Rani.
The interior of the Rani's TARDIS alone is worth watching this episode, as is a feature of it revisited at the end of The Two Doctors.  Let's see, goofs and other things:  The cliffhanger to Part 1 is effective, there's a small added scene when the cliffhanger is repeated in Part 2, which elicits a ""Oh, come on!""  Peri has a nice apricot dress, but as for that yellow top... urgh!  And the Luddite riots ended in 1816, a decade earlier.
Kate O'Mara makes the Rani more formidable than the Master and easily carries this story.  Other honors go to Gawn Grainger as Stephenson and as Terence Alexander as Lord Ravensworth, head of Killingworth.  One of the Sixth Doctor's best stories, with the harsh 1820's replicated remarkably well.",1031443200,20,2927,4.702755905511811

But that is no excuse for the third party sellers to hike the price up to $100. Mark of the Rani is a great story, worthy of praise from Doctor Who fans. I hope the BBC re-releases this DVD, so I can get it for a reasonable price. I recently purchased a new VHS copy and it's well worth it because the story is one of Colin Baker's best and introduces the Rani as a regular villain.",1489190400,,491,3.92

7867920,5,6304304218,"I mark this story as one of Colin Baker's best.

Now mind you. One of the best of an era plague with terrible writing. So don't think you're getting ""City of Death"" here. During other eras of Doctor Who this episode would have been medicore at best. But The Sixth Doctor and Peri have a wonderful chemstry here as do The Master and The Rani.

Now this isn't a thoughtful episode by any means. It's a Sci-Fi romp. I won't ruin my favorite scene. But all I'll say is watch the landmines.",1433980800,3,485,4.260869565217392
7867921,3,6304304218,"Mark of the Rani introduces us to the Rani, an exiled Time Lord bent on extracting the hormone that allows humans to sleep which turns Ludites into very violent Ludites. She needs the hormone to regain control of a planet she controls. The Master arrives to take advantage of this and lure the Doctor to his death and take over the minds of geniuses key to the Industrial Revolution.

The story's weaknesses are painfully obvious. The Doctor and the Rani are both villainous time Lords and don't have a decent plan between them. While watching this, my wife looked me at me and held up a bottle of melatonin and asked if the Rani was trying to steal this. It might not have been exactly that, but it does seem this is a pretty silly thing for a chemical genius to steal. There are some rotten accents, and a few silly plot turns like the Master and the Rani hoping to destroy the Doctor's TARDIS by throwing it down a mine shaft.

However, the strengths of the story still make it a winner, even it's by a narrow margin. The location shooting is very nice. For about 20 minutes, we see Colin Baker in a different coat. And then there's the interplay between the Rani and the Master. The Master is practically cartoonish at this point in his obsession with the Doctor throughout the Davison years. The Rani is a true scientist who doesn't care one iota about the Doctor and the Master's silly duel but is made to care by the Master.

The Rani is a great concept for a character, and may have gained more prominence with a better introduction story.

Colin Baker once again turns in a superb performance. This story highlights the moral nature of the Doctor as exemplified when he risks his life to save a group of miners headed for disaster. Still, you do have a reminder this Doctor is not one to fool with when he gets his hands on the Master's weapon and when he's ordering the villains around, they listen.

I also have to praise the Rani's TARDIS design. Aside from Season 14's wooden design, this was the best looking TARDIS in the classic series to-date.",1426636800,,2060,4.482666666666667
7867922,5,6304304218,"Classic episode of; the oddest doctor, out of all his iterations. The RANI was a classic villainess the female Master essentially. The contemporary doctor CAPALDI should have gone up against her instead of THE MASTER turned female by regeneration. It would have made more sense to just include another regeneration for THE RANI; keeping her female since the doctor never regenerates to the opposite sex. Also the RANIs back story is she harvests chemicals from dying individuals it WOULDA made waaaaay more sense to have her harvesting corpses to ""turn them into"" CYBERMEN and not The MASTER. It's more of THE RANIs M.O than anything THE MASTERs ever committed! It's just more aligned to THE RANI.  I suspect that while THE RANI made more sense this generation currently does not know who the character is from the mythology because THE RANI is only used in 2 episodes that many deem forgettable. But I do not! I encourage all whovians great and small to learn of the character.",1421539200,,978,4.8562874251497
