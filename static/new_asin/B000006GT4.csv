When I was a teenager I must have watched this movie at least 25 times on my old VCR and to this day it still affects me like it did back then.  Before the time of ""Romantic Comedy"" there were plenty of movies dealing with the issue of ""love found,love lost"" and the only one of them that even comes close to this one, during the 80s, was ""About Last Night.""  Yes ladies, guy can cry at the movies too and this one just made my heart ache.  A great movie to watch if you have just lost that ""special someone"" in your life, it gives you some time to dream about happy endings and the possibilty that what you let go may someday come back to you.  Check this one out, that is if they EVER decide to release it in another format other than on ""dead"" technology.",1212883200,9,888,4.080459770114943

1195723,3,B000006GT4,"Set in Chicago, a group of characters, now in their thirties, examine their earlier lives for what might have been, but wasn't. It sails along pretty well until the end, which is a total disaster--utterly tacky and unreal. What a shame.",1110412800,3,236,4.780487804878049
1195724,5,B000006GT4,"I too saw this movie several years ago and it still ranks among my  favorites.  I would describe it as being about childhood friends who have  grown apart over the years.  And although their neighborhood loyalties  cause them to stay in contact with each other, they struggle to stay  ""friends"" in a contemporary way.  Yet, despite their adult  diversities, a tragedy brings them together in a beautiful and meaningful  way.  The movie shows me that although old friends follow their own life  paths, the friendships are real and can be counted on regardless of  seperation.",962582400,19,574,4.926315789473684

It both captures the feel of 1980's Chicago and presents a compelling love story of a man and a woman who meet when it's not their time, search elsewhere for what they think they want, then by chance re-meet and recognize that life gave them what they needed in the first place, just not the vision to see it. Life is like this on many levels. Admittedly, the sailboat scene when Sol is dying is borderline corny, but what good thing isn't flawed? The bookstore scene at the end more than redeems it. Along with About Last Night, which parallels this plot, two of my favorite 1980's films.",1477872000,,731,4.462686567164179
7904533,5,B000006GT4,"This is one of my all time favorite movies. Love the story, so very poignant. The thread throughout the movie is about friendship. For me, it had a spiritual meaning, even tho the people we love are not on this earth anymore, somehow, they are looking out for us. It was a comfort to me after my best friend died.
Cried thru most of the movie every time I have seen it.
Wish it was on DVD.",1463529600,,389,4.064935064935065
7904534,5,B000006GT4,"Just watched an old, made-for-TV movie again. Netflix never picked it up. It was made in 1984, and it really affected me. It's dated, somewhat cheezy, and not really slickly produced, but it's bittersweet, has changes of seasons, a dog, great friendships and a love-story in it. Whaddya' want for nuthin', rubber biscuit?
I was so glad to be watching it with my wife. It affected me again like it did thirty years ago. The thing only gets one star on ""Rotten Tomatoes."" Buncha' snobs. Some people have no soul. What I love about the movie although most people find the ending a ""happy"" ending, it leaves a bit to the imagination. I call it a ""hopeful"" ending, which I'll take over a slimy happy ending any day.

7904537,5,B000006GT4,"An old movie that didn't make a big splash, but it's about lifelong friends facing a crisis with one of the characters, also about friends getting back together after years to help the person with problems a very poignant movie, not just a girl flick, my husband turned me onto this movie, had been hunting for it for years well worth the money we both loved it and he tears up and I just outright cry when watching it.  A definite keeper give a 5 star rating",1348790400,2,459,4.275862068965517

7904539,5,B000006GT4,"I ONLY SAW THE LAST PART OF THIS MOVIE.  It obviously was a very good movie, as it held my attention from the first moment I saw it.  I made a point to see it because one of the actors was later to star in my own very favourite TV show of all time.  This actor is ERIC PIERPOINT, who plays the handsome newsman in the show....who sadly has his news-coverage range rather down-graded towards the end of the movie.  But his character, (if I remember correctlu_. fared better than some of the others.....

It's intereting to note, too, that, in real life, actor ERIC Pierpoint is the son of NEWSMAN ROBERT Pierpoint!  That's right -- he sort of had his own dad's job in this one movie, ""WINDY CITY"".  Some of the stars here are better known....but anyone who has ever seen the wonderful, ""ALIEN NATION -- THE SERIES"", (available here on Amazon in DVD format....  They made some TV movies, too....and there's a theatrical-movie pre-quel, (this one without Mr. Pierpoint) -- but as far as I can tell, the SERIES itself, is the best.

Anyway, 'WINDY CITY' is a fine, heart-felt movie.  And with the additional treat of seeing ERIC PIERPOINT in it, this movie is totally irresistable!  A slice of life film NOT to be missed by lovers of great drama -- and acting!",1301875200,3,1256,4.488986784140969
