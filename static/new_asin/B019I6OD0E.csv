7575885,4,B019I6OD0E,"Lost in Hong Kong is an entertaining movie - although it's main focus revolves around a dream that Xu (main character) had 20 years ago, the movie is sort of all of over the place.  Xu and his family takes a vacation to Hong Kong (as a lot of mainland Chinese do) and has a chance to fulfill his dream..I'll leave it to you to read the description of the movie from Amazon....
The extras - Bloopers was terrible, nothing good there.  But the trailers were great, IP Man 3, Beauty Inside, and Assassination (already got this one, but now just went and pre-ordered IP Man3 and ordered Beauty Inside).  As of this writing Amazon currently has Ip man 3 preorder unavailable, but you can hit up Target as it's 12.99 there as well.

I thought though, that the main entertainment came from all of the insides jokes on Hong Kong Cinema and Music.  Fans of the HK music/movies will enjoy all of the jokes, in my case, it made me want to listen to some of the music from the 80's/90's. :)

Spoilers-
I probably didn't get all of jokes, but it'll be good to know that a lot of inside jokes are related to some of the following:

Music: famous songs from Alan Tam, Daniel Chan, Leslie Cheung, Beyond, Francis Yip -- Ironically the ending the song was performed by Wong Faye, who is a mandarin singer but got her start in Hong Kong.

Movies:  Comrades almost a love story (Leon Lai/Maggie Cheung's dream of going to HK), Shanghai Tan (extremely famous TVB Series that made Chow Yun Fat famous), 2046 (wong kar wai film), ChungKing Express - some glimpses of movies starting Anita Mui and Leslie Cheung...

hope you enjoy it!",1457222400,2,1611,4.448979591836735
7575886,5,B019I6OD0E,"This movie is actually the third in a series, but you don't need to see the first two to follow along at all.  There is lots of action, comedy, and romance.  You won't be disappointed.  If you like this movie, then I wholeheartedly recommend you watch the first two of the series: ""Lost on Journey"" (if you can find it anywhere), and ""Lost in Thailand"" (currently on Netflix).  I have seen many of Xu Zheng's movies and I have enjoyed them all.",1457136000,,444,4.378048780487805
7575887,3,B019I6OD0E,"Lost in Hong Kong takes place in the mid-1990s. University art majors Xu Lai (Xu Zheng) and Yang Yi (Du Juan) fall in love, but Yang is transferred to the Chinese University of Hong Kong and Xu hasn't seen her since. Nearly twenty years later, Xu  now a brassiere designer  has long forgotten his dreams of becoming an artist, but he can never forget Yang even though he enjoys a comfortable life with his wife Cai Bo (Zhao Wei). Their only problem is their repeated failure to conceive a child. During a vacation in Hong Kong with Cais family, Xu plans to secretly visit Yang, but Xus aspiring documentarian brother-in-law  always carrying a camera for his documentary project  tags along, ruining the rendezvous.

This is an odd hybrid of a movie. With elaborate stunt work, slapstick, picturesque photography of Hong Kong, and romance, it tries to be an all-purpose flick geared to attract the widest possible audience. As a result, theres a scattershot feel to the movie, with plot tendrils in too many directions. With Xu Zheng credited as writer, director, producer, and star, Lost in Hong Kong is largely a one-man effort.

The movie has an often frenetic, desperate pace. A cartoonish performance by Bao Beier as the wannabe documentary filmmaker is so broad, its reminiscent of silent screen comedy when actors had to exaggerate body and facial expression to put a point across or get a laugh.

The movie contains a lot of in-jokes that fans of Hong Kong filmmaking will get. Others may react blankly to these references. The soundtrack consists of upbeat pop songs from Hong Kong cinemas heyday of the 1980s and 1990s. The film is in Mandarin, with English subtitles.

Bonus extras on the Blu-ray release include a making-of featurette, blooper reel, and trailer.",1456444800,5,1773,4.886666666666667

8745340,5,B019I6OD0E,"An extremely fast paced, interesting, well shot, well acted dramatic comedy or comedic drama, one of the two.  It's a classic film in that there are tons of misunderstandings, comedic prat falls and physical comedy, but it all works.  The story of a man searching for his lost youth and coming to realize the importance of his present day life is well told.  The film builds upon itself moving from one crazy situation to the next in an organic and satisfying way.",1490745600,,464,4.634146341463414

8745343,4,B019I6OD0E,"Not as good as Lost in Thailand, but is still worth watching if you like slap stick, unexpected humor. Like the Mermaid movie, same director, Quirky Funny, silly, but this one had a over all ""point well made"" moment to make you see what all of it was about. I was right there with the main character the whole time, ""just push the idiot off the bridge camera and all!"" and he will no longer annoy you.... but, keep in mind, he won't be there to sort all the rest of the stuff out in the end if you do push him off.",1472860800,,514,4.0

8745346,5,B019I6OD0E,"Although it is in Mandarin, and the subtitles can be difficult to read in English due to the fast pace of the movie, I had no problem keeping up.  The movie is riveting.  It is a very funny comedy with some serious moments, also some edge of the seat, finger biting moments.
There are some twists and turns along the way as well..
The things they say and the moments the main character shares with his wife's family are hilarious, his adventure and the mishaps he encounters were well thought out.  It could have stopped at that and the movie would still  be good, but add the scenes with the movies director, and a murder plot, the artistic appeal and it becomes a brilliant and multi faceted movie worth the watch.",1463270400,,716,4.442748091603053
