3851228,2,B00264U0OE,"THE MOVIE ITSELF: (Some SPOILERS)
Well this is your standard 'B' rated SCI-FI movie.  But honestly, this is movie presents itself like a piss poor SCI-FI channel original movie.  It stars Bruce Boxleitner (of TRON fame and the only one worth mentioning), Jennifer Rubin, Shane Van Dyke (written by), and some other unknowns. Like some sci-fi movies that feature some sort of robotic theme, this movie uses the Roswell Arc; the alien technology we found at the crash was used to reverse engineer today's technology. HDTVs, cellphones, cars, you name it, came from this alien incident! Turns out, everything we were building, is the capable army of these Transmorphers.  Then plot disintegrates from there and you just wasted an 1:25 of your life.

Well this was obviously a low budget film in all aspects; the acting (at least Boxleitner did an OK job, he was the only VET actor after all), the effects (oh boy, I am not about to start), and the direction.  Some would argue that even some low budget films (like the ones done by Magnolia) have a great story at best, but there is nothing that saves this film.  The pacing and presentation are just INCOHERENT complete with laughable effects and a gratuitous sex scene.  All in all, the movie as a whole will not grab you.

VIDEO: (1.78:1/MPEG-2/1080p)
I think ASYLUM actually took some sort of time with transfer.  Presented in an 1.78:1, this MPEG-2 is actually pretty clean for the most part.  There are no notable signs of dirt, spec, or noise, but it does have some signs of Macro Blocking (yeeesh).  The detail is fine, it would kind of remind you of a really good HD broadcast (that is being a little generous).

While the detail for the most part is intact, I can not say the same for the color.  This entire movie is covered in some sort of yellow filter. It is everywhere and in every scene.  At first I thought someone messed with my TV settings, but nope, IT IS the transfer.  Not pleasing to the eyes, and definitely not a DEMO-worthy video transfer in the slightest.

AUDIO: (DD 5.1 @ 448kbps & LPCM 2.0 @ 1.5mbps)
Hmmm where to start.  Well for one, the case is labeled as DTS-HD.  This in actuality is mis-leading.  This movie is encoded with two audio options; your standard 5.1 DD (that sits a steady 448kbps) and a LPCM 2.0 (1.5mbps).  I should note that even earlier Blu-ray movies were encoded at 640kbps for standard 5.1 DD. BUT NOT THIS MOVIE!

Ahem that aside, the 5.1 audio projection terrible in all the speakers.  There is barely any rear surround use and the LFE is joke. To be short, this is a front heavy (FL, C, and FR) movie minus the LFE.

Basically you are better off leaving it on 2.0, because truthfully that is what it is, but not much better.

EXTRAS: (Presented in 1080i and 1080p)
I guess when you work on a set or if you are an actor in any movie, you have fun either way, because it seems like everyone did while I was watching the extras.

*NOTE: This movie does not support POP-UP!

In conclusion, if you want to watch a SCI-FI movie with a terrible story, laughable effects, sub-par video presentation, poor audio, or you are a blu-ray collector like me, then you may want to pick this one up.  Otherwise, I would avoid this one for you may lose an hour and a half of your life.

you know why  ???

1- Low budget movie .

2- Failure copy of Transformer .

3- i don't know how they choose their actors , they don`t know anything about acting .

i really don`t know how this movie released on blu-ray its a disgrace for all blu-ray movies .",1247356800,3,312,3.967741935483871

Get all that ""Bad Juju"" out of your head when guessing what you're about to watch.
This go-a-round is much better than original? TRANSMORPHERS !
Wanted Shane to resemble his granndfather(Dick Van Dyke),But actually half way thru noticed a definite Michael Bay slanted appearance,Not to be outdone female lead could pass for Megan Fox,And mayor of town resembles Obama.
Special effects are great and explosive,You'll never look at a cellphone,SUV or Pacemaker the same way without squinting.
Jennifer Rubin returns to movies and We haved missed her eyes and allure.
Bruce Boxleitner is great as the seasoned hero and has a wonderful moment witha CGI helicopter.",1245888000,3,722,5.342105263157895
8351899,3,B00264U0OE,"Believe it or not, this is far form the worst movie I have seen. It will seem way to simple for millennials who were raised on mind-blowing cgi, but of older viewers it is reminiscent of made-for-TV. Kind of like Terminator, kind of like Aliens, kind of like Transformers. Definitely not big budget but not awful either. Worth a watch if you like this genre and have an hour and a half to kill.",1527984000,,394,4.337837837837838

8351901,2,B00264U0OE,"A small California town is annoyed by alien/domestic/ancient/modern transmorphers, RPDs, AVDs etc. It seems what they are is part of a confused plot point where we get to choose. While the government knows about it, it takes a core group of civilians to save the planet, or at least for the sequel, which magically had been made years earlier.

Jake (Shane Van Dyke), hub-cap aficionado, is ex-military and is an expert on these devices which allows him to blindly shoot at them like anyone else.  His girlfriend ""mini-dress"" Maddy (Alana DiMaria) can run real fast and give us panty flashes (I love Blu-Ray quality). While her dad (Bruce Boxleitner) is the chief of police busy investigating phone cell murders.

I noticed the opening fonts had slanted letter ""A""s except for some names like Cano and Michael which had upright ""A""s. I tried to work that secret code into the film, i.e. like most coded Asylum films, but alas, could not. The film had elements of ""Red Dawn"" as our small band attempt to save the planet.

For the most part the film was boring.

8351902,2,B00264U0OE,"I wasn't looking for anything in particular when I stumbled onto this low-low budget rip-off.  It stars former fashion model Jennifer Rubin (semi-star of A Nightmare on Elm Street 3), costars (and written by) the grandson of Dick Van Dyke, Shane Van Dyke, and poor Bruce Boxleitner who has maintained a long interesting career (this movie notwithstanding).
This lackluster production is hampered by brief uninvolving scenes, a limited use of FX, sappy dialog, and negligible acting skills.  Everything's a clich.  The story is populated with manly men and macho women (everyone is just so gosh darn plucky).
They were trying too hard to make an epic on a shoestring budget.  They even managed to throw in a brief romance while the world is coming to an end because there's always time for sex.  The moral here is don't drive killer cars or talk on murderous cell phones.  As for pacemakers.........",1404777600,,898,4.953333333333333

When a super species of deadly robots begins to wage war against the planet, Humankind fights back.
In a movie this bad you are cheering for the Robots to end it all.....Quickly!

This a B movie. Definitely struggled with a limited budget and bad script. A few of the performances are not terrible but when you surround it with amateur looking special effects and a lot of bad acting it gets kinda funny. This is a movie you just goof on and enjoy the moments of the final director cut and wonder to yourself.....""Does he know how bad this is?""

Its kinda funny for a pretty bad movie. But I KNEW that going in and I did get a few laughs out of it . So not all bad.",1356307200,,692,4.195488721804511
8351906,2,B00264U0OE,"""Transmorphers: Fall of Man"" is a prequel to the original ""Transmorphers"" movie.  TFoM feels like two different movies.  The first movie is an apparently successful repelling of the rise of the robots.  Of course, the alien robots that control the drones do arise, and that is the second half of the movie.

The special effects are nothing to cheer about, but they do work.  The script is tight and coherent for an Asylum movie.  Bruce Boxleitner supports the first half of the movie.  The movie kind of falls apart after that, but it moves toward the logical conclusion.

Yes, TFom is a bad movie.  It is more of an action movie than its predecessor, and it is better made in all respects.  It is worth watching just to see what happened before Transmorphers, if that means anything.",1279411200,4,784,4.656934306569343
8351907,2,B00264U0OE,"This movie was so bad its funny.  The acting, special effects, and story was so awful I enjoyed it.  Some of the highlights are as follows.

1- The military members buttoned up their BDU shirts all the way and had no rank, name, service lables, or hats.  Anyone who has served in the armed forces will get a huge kick out of the airman in this movie.

2-Watch the background when the characters are driving around.  You'll see the same background over and over.  You would think at least if they were going to do that they'd use something neutral but instead they had them driving past a globe.

3-They showed what was supposed to be a safe heavily guarded.  Instead they had a cabinet with no lock and a horrible excuse for an airman guarding it.

4-The transmorphing was stupid lol.  Everyday items such as your cell phone ""transmorphed"" into stupid looking creatures that killed you with lazer beams.

If you like to laugh I encourage you to purchase this movie.  I have watched this with many of my friends and everyone laughs hysterically.  Apparently the director of this movie is famous for rip off films.  I look foward to watching more of his movies such as the day the world stopped and the pirates of treasure island lol.",1276473600,3,1232,4.536363636363636
8351908,1,B00264U0OE,"Better than ""Transformers 2""... at least this was supposed to be cheesy. This movie is done in the tradition of camp. I wouldnt even give ""Transformers 2"" one star, if they would let me.",1262822400,,186,4.5
