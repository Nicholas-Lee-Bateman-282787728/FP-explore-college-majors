It looks great sitting on my desk or shelf.  The only thing was I wish it was a bit bigger, but you have to realize this is part of a DVD set so it's going to fit inside of a large DVD case, which means, it's not going to be the size of your head!!! Lol it's a good paperweight though it's roughly about the size of a 6inch action figure, maybe just a little shorter. Aside from that it's awesome!!! The card inserts are a nice touch but they small, imagine the cover of a DVD and that's what you get.  All in all I still love it",1387584000,,677,3.927007299270073
8213552,5,B000UJLRSK,"The ancient warrior Hellion would have enjoyed the brutality, warrior credo, and undying loyalty to country and nobility under threat - in the epic, graphic masterpiece ""300"". Written by Frank Miller; directed by Zack Snyder; starring Gerard Butler (as King Leonidas), Lena Neadey (as Queen Gorgo), voice-over narrative by David Wenham (as Dilios). and Rodrigo Santoro (as Xerxes). Premise: King Leonidas leads 300 Spartans against an army of one million soldiers, who seek to ravage and enslave Sparta and Greece. Themes: freedom & tyranny, sacrifice on the battlefield, extreme heroism that has inspired warriors throughout the centuries, and a just cause to defend one's own home country from invaders. Our empathy runs strong. Our catharsis is assured. We care what happens.

We can identify with these warriors on many levels. Their sacrifice of life itself ennobles their place in history. This film has high-end epic drama-type acting & physicality, Shakespearean dialogue, horrific battle scenes, deceit, betrayal, treason underfoot, treachery, seamless & robust film editing, fierce as possible close combat scenarios that deserve repeated viewing, and early on sensuality - prior to the first battles between the 300 Spartans and their adversaries at the Hot Gates (Thermopylae).

This film has fire & death, shield & sword, true heroism pitted against impossible odds - the likes of which warriors - tamed and untamed, trained, seasoned by uncommon valor & combat, worn thin by hypocrisy, glad for battle to freshen the senses and sharpen one's fighting prowess - can draw from the well of battle history in order to remain a true fighting unit under one commander. An exceptional action movie. All unities adhered to. The crescendo ran like a jolt of electricity from the opening scenes where King Leonidas sends the messengers of Xerxes to their death in the pit until the 300 Spartans face their final battle unto death. It struck a chord throughout the world, echoing universal themes that are held dear. These words from the only warrior left alive from the original 300 Spartans rings true to this day:

Dilios:  ""This day we rescue a world from mysticism and tyranny!""",1333756800,,2186,5.219373219373219
