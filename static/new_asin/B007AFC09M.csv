8513371,1,B007AFC09M,"This is a biased view of history. It's actually propaganda for one point of view and therefore not good for children. Graphics are poor also. Sorry,but as a teacher I cannot recommend this for anyone.",1484438400,,200,4.742857142857143
8513372,5,B007AFC09M,Definitely geared towards Christian principles.,1478390400,3,47,8.6
8513373,2,B007AFC09M,I was so hoping for an unbiased dvd to actually teach my grandson about the democratic process.  This dvd is so skewed to the Republican Party.  I am glad I watched it.  I threw it out before it could ever be accidently played for any children or grandchildren of mine.,1477094400,,269,4.34
8513374,3,B007AFC09M,"Very ""right"" sided, but it does explain the electoral college",1473724800,2,61,5.2
8513375,1,B007AFC09M,"Beyond the bad CGI and sub-par story telling, Learn Our History is conservative biased. That's not so much of a surprise since they have Mike Huckabee's name promoted with the series, but the it tends to use anyone that appears liberal (example: hippies) as antagonists to its storyline. In the episode, One Nation Under God, the plot is centered around how a teacher was being investigated for reciting the Pledge of Alligience and allowing students to participate to their own consent (sound familiar? If not watch God's Not Dead 2). Generally speaking, the series is biased and using hippies, athiests, and anyone considered liberal as scapegoats, not unbiased and unfiltered as Huckabee claims.",1471996800,3,698,5.185840707964601
8513376,5,B007AFC09M,"Like all of the other Learn our History DVDs, this one was engaging for both my 2 year old, my 8 year old and me too!",1388275200,3,117,3.5384615384615383
8513377,1,B007AFC09M,"In looking for a Godly, History program, we discovered this series.  We signed up for the initial DVD, not realizing it was a continual DVD subscription.  We received 2 DVDs before we cancelled.  Sadly, these DVD's give education a very bad name!  Our family sat down to watch them and even our 4 yr old asked if we, ""have to finish this bad movie?""
The graphics are just flat out embarrassing for todays standards.  The ""History"" lessons are so lost in the drama of the ridiculous ""cast of characters"", that it totally detracts from the lessons in history.  They actually reinforce why this country is in the state it is in, because of the tripe and drama portrayed.  One of the DVDs we watched was on Christopher Columbus.  One of our son's birthday is on October 12th.  We figured he'd at least get the date out of the program.  Nope!  At age 8, he was so overwhelmed at the ""horrible History lesson"", that he couldn't even tell us the date that Columbus discovered America.  This series does such a disservice on so many levels.  First to say that our kids are inundated with so many highly graphic media forms today, and that this is so very dot matrix.  Any History to be learned is lost in such poor quality graphics as well as story lines.  I need to add that we did not purchase these from Amazon, and a disclaimer should be made voiding Amazon from any consequences causing nightmares you or your children will have from watching these.  On a positive note, we had a fantastic hour of pant-wetting laughter at just making fun of these.  If you have money to waste, and need a lesson on what not to produce for education, please spend away!",1381795200,13,1649,4.498316498316498
8513378,5,B007AFC09M,"Yes, it is a little cheesy and has it's own story line with some history thrown in there.  However, it keeps my kids' attention and they're learning something...that's all I care about!!",1379376000,6,186,4.8125
8513379,1,B007AFC09M,"this was a total waste of time and money. the story line is awful, the way they try and bring in the different kids is really lame. You have the sassy black girl, nerdy white boy, farm boy, and the sarcastic white boy. I thought this was supposed to be about history, not a stupid story line that adds in history here and there.  Don't waste your money",1358208000,9,352,4.176470588235294
