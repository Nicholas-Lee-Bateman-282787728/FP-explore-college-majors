7896924,5,6305889570,"I bought this because I'm a fan of Eric Roberts - but John Ritter really impressed me, since I'd only seen him (and loved his comedy!) in the old TV series ""Three's Company"" - believe me, this movie is no comedy!  It's not as violent as they could have made it, but it's a great story and a great movie - moral: don't mess with quiet guys!",1392508800,,339,4.059701492537314

I WATCHED IT ON A PAID MOVIE SITE AND LIKE IT SO MUCH I HAD TO ADD IT TO MY COLLECTION.  GREAT CAST.",1358812800,,150,3.6875
7896926,5,6305889570,"I bought this movie because Rachel Hunter is in it. I will still buy anything that she stars in. OK, so the plot line is a little silly, but Eric Roberts was still convincing as a villian and again, you have Rachel in it.

7896927,1,6305889570,"This movie was just plain bad.  It's amazing how far Eric Roberts sank with this film, it is amazing he was ever considered Oscar worthy.  The late John Ritter was a good comedic actor but drama was not his thing.  I prefer to remember him in better days like in Skin Deep. Rachel Hunter is a still beautiful model but as of yet I have seen no proof she can act.  As far as Tripfall goes, Ritter and Hunter are a married couple on vacation who are abducted by Roberts, who is now type cast as the late night cinemax bad guy.  The scheme is to force Ritter to withdrawl cash from the bank and well.....that is it.  If you are a fan of any of the leads in this film I would not even recommend renting this.  It will only lower your opinion of them.  On a side note the extra's on the dvd include a trailer.  It is hard for me to imagine this made it to theaters.",1195430400,,860,4.011764705882353
7896928,3,6305889570,"While Eric Roberts performed admirably in this film and John Ritter did his usual great job for what he had to work with, the story was dull and they really wasted the beautiful Rebecca Hunter.

The late John Ritter did a good job but the producers could have given him more. I see one reviewer compares this to Breakdown. Breakdown with Kurt Russell was much better, more suspenceful and they kept you wondering what really happened to his wife.

In Tripfall, the beautiful Rebecca Hunter spends the first half of the movie following Ritter around like a lost puppy and has at best about 2 speaking lines. In the whole second half, we see the beautiful Rebecca Hunter bound and gagged in the back of a van with her two children. I would think that she could have had a bigger role than this!

Eric Roberts was great in his part and played the villian admirably right to the end.

Not a bad movie but not even close to Breakdown. And directors, consider using Rebecca Hunter a whole lot more. She has talent, but you would never know it by this movie.",1095638400,,1051,4.458333333333333
7896929,2,6305889570,"Only the talent of guys like John Ritter and Eric Roberts can keep you interested in this slow-moving attempt at a suspense drama. Ritter and family are on vacation when they are conned, kidnapped, robbed and terrorized. With Eric Roberts as a villain it sounds like it would be good. Unfortunately Roberts isn't as intense as he was in The Specialist. What's even worse is instead of being scary they make him talk with a twirpy voice that gets obnoxious really fast. What were they thinking? John Ritter is good as always but there isn't much for him to work with. It would've been nice to see him get more revenge than he does in this movie. The premise of is very similar to the far superior Kurt Russell movie Breakdown which I recommend checking out instead. If you are a die-hard fan of Roberts or Ritter though, it should keep your attention. Keep in mind it's a low-budget direct-to-video movie and you get just what you would expect.",995241600,5,943,4.585798816568047
