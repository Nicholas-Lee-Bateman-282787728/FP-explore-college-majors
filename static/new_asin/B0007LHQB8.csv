According to Tv legend it was initially approved for a 2nd season,then dropped for an historical drama that was canceled after a few episodes. There was a reboot planned for the early 2000's,unfortunately the pilot was not picked up.",1350432000,,315,4.851851851851852
8048317,3,B0007LHQB8,"With so many fans of the hit TV series ""The Time Tunnel"", you'd think they'd get around to offically releasing it on DVD!  The crappy NTSC VHS versions are such a let down in terms of quality. I won't be buying anymore of these primitive VHS cassettes, I can't bare to watch such dismal resolution in the year 2005! Bring on the DVD's I say!!!",1117929600,2,343,4.276923076923077
