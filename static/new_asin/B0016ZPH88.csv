8306637,4,B0016ZPH88,"Informative segment with Soros on world- economic- crisis. Soros knows a great deal  even though his political views are off the wall, and out of the ballpark.
He has a bit of a know- it- all manner.
But he does point to realities i.e. the declining power of the dollar: the flight from currencies: the commodity bubble: the crisis in the housing market: the foreclosure crisis: the need for more regulation on the part of the Fed: the fact that the U.S. is already in a recession: His claim is that the world is in the largest economic crisis since the Great Depression. And he also claims the situation is going to get worse before it gets better. He recommends somehow limiting foreclosures and allowing as many people as possible to keep their homes.
His attack on monetarist doctrine and his advocacy of the control of the growth of credit are his standard stuff.
However he does not point to a clear way out of the crisis , and makes few 'positive recommendations'.
In other words he seems not bad on diagnosis but on cure he is not really there.",1208908800,,1052,4.536842105263158
