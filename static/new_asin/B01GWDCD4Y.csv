8764061,5,B01GWDCD4Y,"I have this 3 disc set which contains the original BBC adaptation of LeCarre's book.  The adaptation is superb.  George Smiley, played by Sir Alec Guinness, is called out of retirement to bury a possible scandal in The Circus.  Smiley is world weary and still a bit aggravated at how the government treated him and his fellow ""old school"" spies after the Bill Hayden scandal described in ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"".  You follow Smiley  as he plods, almost literally, his way through London, the English countryside, and Hamburg, West Germany, slowly pealing back this onion, layer-by-layer, as he uncovers the clues and circumstances, which lead him to believe that he can finally have his revenge on Karla, the Soviet spymaster, and George's nemesis during the Cold War.  The scene switches to Bern Switzerland for the burning of Tricky Tony, and then the East Berlin/West Berlin border for the final victory.

Along the way you meet some very interesting and colorful characters, all of them, Smiley's people. ..the alcoholic Connie, Klaus, the Hamburg strip club and brothel owner, and devoted family man, Tricky Tony, the Russian diplomat and inept spy, the Baltic emigres, and of course, Toby Esterhase, the Hungarian ex-spy who has finally given up trying to act the part of an English gentleman, and many more.

The supporting cast is superb, especially Bernard Hepton, as Toby Esterhase, who gets the best lines in the film.  ""George, he's Russian, okay?  The Russians think the butterflies are spying on them."" or  ""...and she's driving.  Most likely they die before they get here.""

The plot twists and turns, and someone who has not read the book might get a little lost at the beginning.  The viewer should also understand that this is not a shoot-em-up spy thriller.  In fact, the only shooting occurs near the beginning and is off camera, and a firearm is never in sight in the rest of the film.  Obviously, it is pretty pricey by now, which might lend itself to second guessing about whether to purchase the set, but that is for you to decide.",1498521600,,2062,4.882183908045977
