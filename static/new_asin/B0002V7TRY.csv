8032334,2,B0002V7TRY,"As a fan of cheesy horror movies made from the late 50s through early 70s, I was looking forward to viewing this collection - the more so since many of these films are hard to come by.  I particularly liked the distributor's concept of placing two trailers, a cartoon and two movies on each disk, just like the good ol' days when I spent Saturday evenings at the local drive-in.  Alas, when I received my DVD box I was sorely disappointed.  The movies are in terrible shape - purveyors of bootleg DVDs would be embarrassed to sell this junk.  The color is washed out, the dialogue is frequently unintelligible and the sound, in general, is full of hisses and pops.  I'd have happily paid the asking price of $26.99 if the films had been remastered, or at least copied from good prints; as it is, I feel that the two bucks I spent to buy the used box set was wasted.

For the record the films included in the set are:
Attack of the Giant Leeches (1959) - A cuckolded bar owner forces his wife and her lover into the local swamp where they are eaten by the titular leeches. The creatures develop a taste for human flesh and soon a number of trappers go missing.  (Dir: Bernard L. Kowalsky)
Beasts from the Haunted Cave (1959) - Gangsters trapped in a remote cabin by a blizzard are menaced by a gigantic spider.  (Dir: Monte Hellman)
Blood Creature (1970) - A mad scientist trying to turn a panther into a human has his plans disrupted by a shipwreck victim.  (Dir: Gerry de Leon)
The Brain That Wouldn't Die (1962) - A surgeon keeps the decapitated head of his beautiful fiance alive while searching for a suitable body to reattach her head.  (Dir: Joseph Green)
A Bucket of Blood (1959) - A crazed sculptor enlists the help of a busboy to make classic art by covering dead bodies with clay.  (Dir: Roger Corman)
The Giant Gila Monster (1959) - When a giant poisonous lizard attacks a remote Texas ranching community, it's up to the local teenagers to save the town from destruction. (Dir: Ray Kellogg)
Lady Frankenstein (1971) - Dr. Frankenstein's beautiful daughter graduates from medical school and returns to her old castle to resume the family business. (Dir: Mel Wells)
Tormented (1960) - A man pushes his former lover off the top of a lighthouse, but her ghost returns to haunt him. (Dir: Bert I. Gordon)
The Wasp Woman (1960) - A cosmetics manufacturer fearful of losing her beauty creates a potion from wasp poison that keeps her young and lovely.  There's one side effect, though - she periodically turns into a bee creature that goes on murderous rampages. (Dir: Roger Corman)
Werewolf in the Girls Dormitory (1962) - Police investigate murderous attacks at a reform school for wayward girls.  After first investigating the dubious alibis of the staff, the local constabulary confronts the possibility that the killer may be a supernatural beast. (Dir: Richard Benson)

The box set includes five Popeye cartoons from mostly from late in the canon:  Private Eye Popeye (1954), Shuteye Popeye (1952), Spree Lunch (1957), Taxi-Turvy (1954) and Tops in the Big Top (1945).",1220745600,,3078,4.695167286245353
8032335,3,B0002V7TRY,"MADACY's KILLER CREATURE is much more than ten 'B' horror flicks on five DVDs. Each disc simulates a night at the movies, circa 1960. There's a ""Coming Attraction"" ad, a trailer for the next feature, and a cartoon between films, followed by the second feature trailer, and so on. As for the movies themselves, you'll see such delights as a living head in a pan of blood, an overgrown lizard, a wasp-waisted gal in a hornet suit, statues made from dead things, and more!

So pick up a box of Milk Duds or Jujubes at the Snack Bar along with a cold drink and some hot-buttered popcorn, and brace yourself, cuz it's time for... KILLER CREATURE!
