You even get to see Johnny Chang, Andy Bloch, and Richard Chen in team play. The excellent advice offered by Ian Andersen and Andy Bloch alone is more than worth the price of the dvd.",1219104000,5,300,4.472727272727273
8058780,3,B0009A5KME,"The potential of this movie was enormous ,however it doesnt quite live up to its expectations considering the ""actual counters/authors"" involved
Not a must-have but certainly not a complete waste of money.",1195948800,3,205,5.4375
