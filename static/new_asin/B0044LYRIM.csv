8416213,5,B0044LYRIM,"Agree with prior review. Felt like I had stumbled inadvertently on a ""gem"" after watching this 2-CD set.  While the dramatic DVD cover and ""UFO TV"" production might cause one to look a bit askance at first glance, it was a reminder not to be be taken in by appearances!  There is some solid Buddhist teaching in these presentations and an opportunity to gain some insight into aspects of Tibetan Buddhism which are not necessarily part of the ""normative"" Western experience.  Especially delightful was the DVD on Mongolia & Kalachakra initiation by HHDL. Kudos & thanks to David Cherniak for producing these!",1434844800,3,608,4.9411764705882355

8416215,5,B0044LYRIM,"This is an excellent set of documentaries, since the second DVD is a completely different piece of work: ""Sleepwalking in Mongolia"" -Kalachakra initiation ritual by the Dalai Lama, which documents the historical, human drama, group dynamics, politics and Buddhist teaching in Mongolia. The first DVD shows an unprecedented access to the ""oracles"" (spirit mediums) in Tibet, which includes lengthy interviews with the Dalai Lama about the subject. A rare jewel, for those interested in the subject of Buddhism, spirit posession, dissociation, magic and ritual.",1299974400,17,559,5.666666666666667
