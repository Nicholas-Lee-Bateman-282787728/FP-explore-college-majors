4717194,2,B005KG4DWU,I watched the movie after I read the book. Almost nothing is the same. They didn't do anything by the book at all. And skipped very important parts of the book. I know movies aren't going to have ever last detail of the book but it wasn't even really about the book. It was mainly focused on 2 girls in the present and when they do go to the past it is very short and no details or anything. If i didn't read the book then it would be an ok movie. But it sucks. Get a new director for this movie,1321228800,3,495,3.8627450980392157
4717195,4,B005KG4DWU,This is a great story of Laotong - Sisters forever from China.  The book is a great read if you haven't seen it and the movie is almost as good.,1321056000,,144,3.8
4717196,5,B005KG4DWU,"The movie is quite different from the book.  I enjoyed the movie I liked what they had did with it.  The book of course is better, but they always are.",1320537600,,151,4.0
4717197,4,B005KG4DWU,"Director Wayne Wang had a different vision for the story than is depicted in Linda See's book about the reversal of fortunes of two laotong or sworn sisters (self same), two women in the 1800s who were bound as sworn sisters, secretly communicating in a women's-only written language placed on the panels of a fan. When fortunes reversed, the formerly last daughter who becomes the mistress of a wealthy family worries and is sad for the former higher born daughter who becomes the wife of a butcher. Wang uses a parallel story of a modern-day set of sworn sisters in the same circumstances. The details and history -- even the fact of the secret language and the secret fan -- are glossed over, as are -- quite fortunately -- the details of the foot binding. The heart of the story is the love of the laotong for each other, the loyalty, and the sacrifice one makes to alleviate the suffering and worry of the other. Wang uses the parallel story to allow the viewer to understand this ancient relationship in the modern context. I have to say that I liked it. It evoked enough of the book for me to get the same sense of history that I had while reading it and the modern story drew me in with emotion.",1320364800,5,1203,4.447963800904978
4717198,5,B005KG4DWU,"Let me begin by saying I have not read Lisa See's book upon which this film is based, hence I'm not in the category of other reviewers who disliked this movie primarily because of its deviation from the novel. Translating a work of art from one medium to another is a difficult task at the very least and it comes as no surprise to discover that a person who loves something in one medium is seldom pleased with its appearance in another. Personally I think a film should be judged solely on its own merits, like it or dislike it for what it is, not for what you thought or hoped it would be.

Having said that I would like to convey how much I loved this film. Director Wayne Wang instilled `Snow Flower and the Secret Fan' with the same depth of emotion and sensitivity that made his `Joy Luck Club' such a moving and memorable viewing experience.

The storyline moves neatly back and forth between two sets of Chinese women living in different times (Lily and Snow Flower in 1829 China, Nina and Sophia in present day Shanghai). Though time and place differ, the shared cultural and spiritual bonds formed by their mutual `vows of sisterhood' are identical and timeless. Bingbing Li plays the parts of both Lily and Nina and Gianna Jun the dual roles of Snow Flower and Sophia. Both story lines are engaging but clearly the Snow Flower and Lily tale is the more important of the two. Nevertheless the present day friendship between Nina and Sophia is essential to the intent of the film, providing not only context to the earlier friendship but a cultural bridge between past, present and future. In other words, while everything around us is constantly changing what's really important in life remains the same.

I strongly recommend this film; the storyline, dialogue, soundtrack, visuals and cast all make for a well spent evening of viewing entertainment. The only warning I would level is to say that this is, like `Joy Luck Club' a chick flick so gentlemen view at your own risk.",1320364800,73,1988,4.626062322946176
4717199,4,B005KG4DWU,"I love Lisa See and her books. This movie is based off her book with the same title. I actually have not read Snow Flower and the Secret Fan but I love everything else I have read of hers and wanted to see this movie really bad.

I just finished the movie and I can not even believe the other two reviews gave it a one star. Maybe they were so disappointed that it wasn't exactly like the book but there is NO WAY this movie deserves a one star rating.

If you like her other books or if you just like learning about Chinese culture and traditions you will enjoy this movie. It's a great movie for friends and sisters to watch together.

I highly recommend this movie and I am sure if I had read the book I would feel the disappointment of others. BUT, you need to look past that and you will still see a beautiful movie with a great story. (it has it's downfalls believe me but i still give it a 4 out of 5).",1320364800,,909,4.011049723756906
4717200,1,B005KG4DWU,"I just watched the movie, and I want my money back! Not only that, I want the time that I wasted watching this horrible movie back as well!  This movie is NOT based on the book, the book is pretty good, but the movie is truly an insult to the story in the book.  The movie tries to tell the story of the story of making a movie about a story... and has a really lame ""present day"" story in Shanghai, and a few ""flashbacks"" to the story told in the book.  The ""present day"" story characters are rediculous and totally unbelievable, and the present day story line consumes more than half the move.  As for the minute part of the movie where you actually see the original characters and the story in the book version of this story, well they obviously did not spend much time, effort or money on doing justice to the events portrayed.

If it were possible to give a ""less than zero"" review, this movie would get a negative rating.  It truly is insulting to call this movie by the same title as the book.",1320364800,4,1000,4.2368421052631575
4717201,1,B005KG4DWU,"This movie was a disappointment.  I was expecting to see a movie version of the book.  This is not it.

4717225,4,B005KG4DWU,"I read the book and loved the story. The movie is split into two....ancient and modern China with a parallel story going on. I would have liked the film to be strictly ancient China because so much of the story from the book is left out, unexplained, un-developed. I woul have liked an epic movie made from the outstanding original book.",1503273600,4,337,4.540983606557377

4717228,3,B005KG4DWU,"After having read and and liked the book, I found the movie lacking.  I realize a movie cannot cover all the details of a book, but I expected a richer and more heartfelt presentation and depiction of what it was like to grow up female in China.  The movie skimmed through the highlights of the book, and I think if I hadn't read the book I would have found the movie disjointed and lacking continuity.  It was completely unclear why and how certain events took place, and much of the book's meaning was left on the cutting room floor.",1499644800,3,535,4.383838383838384
4717229,5,B005KG4DWU,"A slow film about two sisters, well maybe not blood related but nonetheless two sister types.
Nice camera work, and the movie shows some of the traditions of the orient. I doubt if I'll watch it again, but on a good def television it was nice.
It isn't easy to follow but the general idea of the movie is that of ' a close love between two sister types endures in life' is sufficient.
Some English language in it, and some others that I wouldn't know but fortunately subtitles appeared when the other languages happened.",1498262400,,520,4.484210526315789

4717232,2,B005KG4DWU,Ugggh.  I made it halfway through.  Allow me to summarize:  Traditional Chinese culture sees women as cattle and only a quasi-lesbian relationship will provide a glimmer of hope.  The end.,1493164800,,188,5.166666666666667

4717234,5,B005KG4DWU,"I read the book AND I love the movie! As a writer of seven novels, I know not every book translates well to the screen and needs adaptation. These are two different mediums and readers would complain that the movie was dull if it followed the book too closely so movie makers cannot win! Watch the movie. Try it for yourself.

I bought the DVD in hopes that it would at least slightly live up to the book... and it did not. It completely disgraced the book! While the book is written from the view of an 80+ year old woman reliving her struggles in and around the time of the Taipang Rebellion,  the DVD shows snippets of these struggles, most of them in no way related to the book, and it is told from a present day setting of the descendants of Lily and Snow Flower, who are going through a ""similar"" struggle.

4717264,2,B005KG4DWU,"As a woman that is truly intrigued by Asian cultures like Japan, China and Korea and adored the movies ""Memoirs of a Geisha"", ""The Joy Luck Club"", and ""Now and Forever"", this movie was very disappointing.

I thought ""this movie is directed by the same person that directed ""The Joy Luck Club"", it must be just as good considering the book is very well written"". Unfortunately this movie was very hard to follow and the dialog was emotionless at times. It jumped around so much between the past and present I couldn't keep up without having to feel like I needed to watch the movie again to understand the plot. What really bothered me was that the movie was spoken in English but then subbed in English (they were speaking Chinese) a lot of the time in the same sentence. It was very frustrating. Most Asian movies I've seen are either dubbed or subbed the entire movie with only the main character speaking their own language during their narration.

I was really interested in the book and thought the movie would give it praise but I can't help but feel the movie does the book injustice.",1463616000,,1091,4.561224489795919

I loved the Joy Luck Club so much and thought it was a beautiful film perfect in every way but this story really should have been a mini series on HBO because you have some graphic stuff here but to understand the times and what these women went through you would need to show this. I am glad I saw the film but it's lacking so much that was in the book.

That being said, unless you read the book this movie is a little hard to follow. Even having read it, it wasn't the easiest thing to follow. There wasn't a lot in the way of explanation as it just went through scene to scene and made you guess as to what was going on. It had very little dialogue to help you figure it out. Having read the book I was able to correlate certain things, all backwards or wrong, to figure out what was going on. I honestly got 2/3 of the way in and could not finish it, it was so terrible.

My sister who is just getting into such touchy topics was flabbergasted; though she liked the movie she was clueless about foot binding and the 'arranged ' marriages and just what impact it can and does have on the life of the woman.

4717299,5,B005KG4DWU,"I loved this book.  I got it because I love Lisa See and Chinese history and was interested in the process of footbinding.  This practice went on for over 1,000 years and I wanted to find out why women would voluntarily cripple themselves in such a tortuous fashion.  I found out that and much more.  In fact, I learned Chinese terms that my modern Chinese friend didn't know, so I was teaching her historic Chinese culture, which we both found very amusing.  There is a movie made from the book which I ordered and so far have not finished watching.  It added a modern counterpoint to the 1850's storyline of the book and I found that disappointing.",1439769600,,650,4.512820512820513

Some viewers didn't like the contemporary storyline and the jumping back and forth but I didn't mind. I liked how the two stories related to each other and demonstrated how strong bonds endure over hardships and time. It showed the sacrifices we make, the joy that comes from knowing someone and caring for someone outside of your family. I was fascinated how communication took on a simple creative expression and held two people together over their lifetimes.

The movie, however, completely misses what makes the movie so magical. And I think even if I hadn't fallen head over heels with the novel, the movie still would have left me missing something. The story is not about Lily and her laotong. It's about two modern women. Which is fine and all, the actresses are talented and beautiful and physical fit the roles relatively well. But I don't think people purchase this movie because they want something modern. So I don't know. I'm just so heartbroken over what this movie could have been.

Extremely loosely based on the book. They spent half of the movie in the modern day, which they pulled completely out of their...noses.
They seemed to think that they could make up for the lack of detail in both stories by providing the viewer with very drawn out shots of women with their heads close together. This is your cue to feel emotion.

They communicate via a secret code written on fans  they exchange whenever possible.  Their daughters continue the bond, up to the present day.  The narrative jumps abruptly back and forth through these generations, which is confusing til you realize it is  all one story.

What, for me, singles it out as great is that their story is told with such understatement that it compels you to fill it out--to complete  the story in your own heart.  That's a technique rarely found in Western art forms.  You may find yourself crying without quite being sure why; there is grief enough, surely, but sometimes your tears are of relief, sometimes of a deep awe at the power of this bond and its endurance over time.

The book allowed the laotong friendship to develop slowly over time, thus revealing the bond between the girls.

It gives the viewer a glimpse into the depth of women's friendship. Living in  Korea in 1991, I was both curious about and pleased to see that Asian women held hands in the streets; perhaps some of these Korean women were in the special friendships the movie shows us.

On the other hand - the chilhood foot-binding scenes were difficult to watch.

The process of the foot binding is gruesome in detail, but it was accepted by the girls as just a fact of their lives.  They were hobbled.  Purposely crippled.at a very young age.  I couldn't get past the ""modern"" part of the film, so I don't know if it even told the story of the escape from invaders via climbing the mountain path.  Many women's ankles broke from the weakness of bone due to the binding process.  So they were  left behind on the mountain path to die.

If you haven't ready the book I think it would be a good movie. They did do a nice job of merging themes from the book into the modern day setting of the movies main storey line. But what I missed most from the book are the intimate storyline, relationship, families and personal details about lily and snow flower that are shared with the reader, giving the two girls a very real and complex relationship. I feel the movie could have fit more of these elements in if it had not tried to merge modern and old storey lines.

All in all, I didn't hate the movie but was upset with the change in story line. I can appreciate how they tried to mirror the two story line (modern and olden day) and brought in some subtil details only people would read the book would recognize, but was very disipointed over all.

4717414,3,B005KG4DWU,"I'm glad I scanned reviews prior to actually watching the movie. If I hadn't already known about the parallel storyline added to the movie (which was not in the book) I would have been rather confused upon seeing the movie for the first time. I'm actually still confused as to why the movie didn't revolve solely around the story told in the book. I'll say this: if you read and loved the book, and expect the movie version to remain true to the book -- even for the most part -- then you're going to be disappointed. In addition to ""flashback"" scenes of parts of the narrative derived from the book (which takes place in 1800's China), there's a new parallel story as well with the same two actresses who portray Snow Flower and Lily portraying best friends in the second (new) modern day China storyline (Nina and Sophia).

Having read (and loved) the book I was disappointed to learn that only part of the movie was based on the actual book. As far as the actual scenes based on the book, I admit it was a bit maddening watching some of them. I know movies frequently differ from the book, and you can't fit everything from the book into the movie, etc. But even some the scenes they showed did not seem to be fully realized and true to what actually happened in the novel. So many times while watching some of them I would think, ""Well that's not how that happened!"" or ""This scene is out of order - that didn't happen until..."" or ""They totally skipped over what else happened during this part. Why?? It's so important and ESSENTIAL to that part of the story!"" or ""Totally misleading! That conversation didn't even happen in the book!"" Maddening, I tell you...

Ironically I actually felt as though the movie devoted more time and development to the modern day storyline than that of Lily and Snow Flower, the characters around whom the book is actually based. I admit - I actually liked the modern day storyline. But, as I saw little relation between it and the novel (besides the general themes of friendship and loss), I thought it would have done much better as a stand-alone story or movie of its own. That way each individual story would not have felt so rushed and forced into trying to form a parallel to the other story being told within the limited ""space"" allotted (the 2 hour movie run time). If each had been allowed to stand alone as its own story/movie there could have been more time for actual story and character development, etc. for each narrative. The frequent scene/story switching got annoying at times, especially when I wanted to connect with the characters more. Surprisngly, as the movie progressed, I felt more connected and interested in the modern storyline than to the Lily/Snow Flower story line. Partly because, I admit, I was being critical of some of the Lily/Snow Flower scenes (expecting so much more from those scenes, comparing the scenes to the detail I had read in the novel)...and partly because not only, as mentioned, did I feel more time was devoted to the modern story but it was a new story -- and as a result I became a bit more intrigued in trying to figure out where that particular story was going.

So I'm a bit mixed on this one. I don't hate the movie or think it's as bad as others make it seem, but I will say whether you like it or not is really based on (1) whether or not you have read the book AND (2) what you expect of the movie. As for me:

Having read the book and critiquing the movie's job in falling in line with the book (even for the most part)= D+

Taking the movie for what it is = C+

I would have probably given it a B if the movie had been devoted 100% to just one of the stories, namely the modern one as I really felt more intrigued and moved by that story (strange but true).

I will no doubt watch it again at some point. At least now I know what to expect, so that will help with my incessant need to pick apart the Lily/Snow Flower scenes as I did the first time I watched it!

But by all means if you haven't read the book, READ THE BOOK!! I can't recommend it enough.",1373673600,,4054,4.374501992031872
4717415,5,B005KG4DWU,"This is a beautiful film, and not at all difficult to follow; the changes in hair styles and clothes (those in the past are gorgeous) are sufficient to immediately communicate whether the scene is past or present.  And that it is said to be two ""parallel"" stories is an overstatement, and perhaps even something of a misperception: if one watches closely one sees it is actually one story, and told chronologically; it almost doesn't matter which scenes are past, and which present.  This is made clear in the final scene: there is change in everything -- except for the deep-hearted love of ""laotong"" sisters; that never changes.

Wayne Wang is a ""genre""-hopping director with an unusual catalog.  It includes such films as ""Chan is Missing,"" the fascinating ""tour"" of San Francisco's Chinatown; the fully American/Hollywood ""Maid in Manhattan,"" with Jennifer Lopez, and a film with Queen Latifah; and ""Chinese-American"" films, ""Dim Sum: A Little Bit of Heart,"" ""A Bowl of Tea,"" and ""The Princess of Nebraska"".  (There is useful, illuminating interview with him in the documentary ""Hollywood Chinese,"" not to my knowledge available via Amazon, it is available from an independent distribution site.  Well worth the price.)

The only other film in which I've seen Li Bingbing is ""The Message,"" a good film in which she is very good (also includes the wonderful Zhou Xun).  In this she is excellent (and essentially has the lead role).  Also notable in a smaller role is Vivian Wu (excellent in ""The Soong Sisters,"" though the film is stolen from her and Michelle Yeoh by a phenomenal Maggie Cheung.)

A moving film, powerfully emotional, almost from the very beginning.  And it is not a ""chick flick"" for men who are fascinated with and appreciative of mother-daughter relationships (Wang's ""Joy Luck Club""), and (especially) sister-sister relationships (regardless whether the sisters are ""blood"" sisters).  Or for anyone who appreciates unique historical storytelling, with an Asian/Chinese philosophical ""core,"" and excellent writing, acting, and cinematography.

Recommended for those who would make up their own minds instead of relying on the misleading negative reviews.  But be certain to watch the extra, ""The Sworn Sisterhood of the Secret Fan,"" before watching the film, as it includes important backstory.",1373414400,6,2317,5.260869565217392

cuz the film had to switch between the two stories - it didn't have enuf time to delve into the characters and culture - especially in the modern tale which went for a faster pace with short exchanges of dialog within very brief scenes

another annoyance for me is the use of the moody color palette that's often used in western films - on the other hand - the visual moodiness is matched - effectively in my opinion - by moody cello music - reminiscent of CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON's soundtrack

it's obvious that the modern segment - which i have just learned was not in the source novel - was introduced to appeal to attention-challenged Westerners since much of it was in English - the excuse for that being that one of the two women was half Korean and lived in Korea and couldn't speak Chinese very well

at least the two talented Asian actresses speak excellent English - Korean star Jun Ji Hyun - aka Gianna Jun - plays Sophia (and Snow Flower in the 1800s) - and Chinese star Li BingBing plays Nina (and Lily in the 1800s)

also present are Vivian Wu with her distinctive voice appearing as a friend - and Hugh Jackman - who has about 3 scenes as an Australian entertainer & businessman - and Chinese Americans such as Russell Wong who are quickly recognizable in their brief scenes by their American accents

Loosely.

It's completely baffling to me as to why anyone would think to butcher Ms. See's powerful story like this in a movie like this....seriously, WHY?? The book is so beautiful, and this could have been a great movie too! Basically, the story is about two girls in MODERN Shanghai who are sworn sisters.  It's superficial at best and neither storyline- the modern one or the flashbacks to the old story- are properly developed.

I read and completely loved Snow Flower and the Secret Fan, so I went into this movie with some expectations. Knowing this is a movie, however, I was ready for the artistic license.  I was a little confused by the modern setting, but hey, let's get past the first 10 minutes before I start judging.

I actually liked that they paralleled the two stories of the women, modern and past.  I suppose if you hadn't read the book the film would seem jumpy, so I see this as a visual supplement to the book in some ways.  I can see where others may get confused with the relationship between Snow Flower and Lily (friends? Lovers?) but this is from a different era. They didn't enter the relationship that way and it is not described that way at all. They were each others comfort and in so many ways soul mates, but they were not sexual...

Anywho, read the book, enjoy it. Watch the movie...realize it is NOT the book verbatim, enjoy it too.  It's not a travesty of an adaptation, it's an interesting, tear jerking, new take on a wonderful story.",1341360000,23,1241,4.318965517241379
4717461,5,B005KG4DWU,This was for me an easy to read book. Each word written drew me into the story. The 'laotong' theme of the two lovers introduced me into a new world of loveship and relationships. The stories that Lisa Lee writes are unigue and marvel of interests that keeps me reaching to read all of her books.,1340841600,,296,4.303571428571429
4717462,1,B005KG4DWU,"Let me start by saying that I haven't read the book, and no, it's still not a good movie. I am from China, and I happened to have received a university grant to study Nu Shu in Hunan Province over ten years ago with one of my best friends at the time - it was sort of our ""laotong"" experience, though we have since grown apart but that's another story. Just like ""Joy Luck Club,"" this movie is made for non-Chinese viewers and has little to no authenticity and the characters were based so much on stereotypes. When I studied Nu Shu at the time, there was only one and a half people alive that could write Nu Shu - one woman and a male scholar who counted as a half person because Nu Shu was invented by and for women. So there is NO WAY that in modern days two high school girls could be writing notes back and forth in Nu Shu in Shanghai! And what is that aunt person who supposedly knew so much about Nu Shu and had the girls formalize a contract??? No, average people in modern Shanghai don't know anything about Nu Shu or laotong - it's something that is much more well-known outside China unfortunately.

Also, a note to the creators of the movie - CHINESE PEOPLE DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH TO EACH OTHER! Yes, Li Bingbing, who played one of the main leads, spoke English in that Jet Li and Jackie Chan movie ""The Forbidden Kingdom"", but that movie was at least set in America to begin with and has an American lead, so it's kind of understandable. But honestly I was thinking ""WTF?"" when the nurse called to tell about the accident in English. China is not India - we weren't colonized so that English became the official language. Some authenticity of Chinese people speaking Chinese would be nice!

And what drab dialogues! It felt like the English dialogues were written by Chinese people who just learned English in an ESL class! There was no depth to the dialogues. And the supporting actors all felt like real amateurs because when they spoke Chinese their accents weren't even very good. In the setting in Hunan, the people all spoke with a Shanghai accent. They just don't sound like trained professional actors. And I agree with another reviewer: what's with Hugh Jackman playing such a minor and ridiculous part in the movie? Gianna Jun is wildly popular in China, but she is not Chinese. No, Koreans are not Chinese! During the 19th century part, her role had to be dubbed because she clearly did not speak Chinese. It's like having a Spanish actress trying to act American - again, no authenticity.

Also some background knowledge on Nu Shu: Yes, the movie did it justice by portraying how it was embroidered into fabric and how it was always done in a poetic format. But, to think that a traditional match-maker would be the one to teach the girls Nu Shu was again, ridiculous. Writing and communicating in Nu Shu was meant to be a rebellious and secretive act amongst women at the time who couldn't go to school like their male counterparts. It was in no ways taught in public. A traditional match-maker would have been horrified to even acknowledge such act existed, since it would make the girls much less desirable by men.

It's sad when such movies are made about China for non-Chinese audience, because things in the movie can be taken as true about China, and they are not. I don't know if this movie was even released in China, but I know for a fact that the Chinese would have no patience for such a pretentious tale.

There have only been a couple of movies made about China that are authentic and non-judgmental, including Ang Lee's amazing ""Lust, Caution"" and the classic ""Red Violin"" which has a segment about the Cultural Revolution in China, a difficult topic, that was well developed and truthful. ""Snow Flower and the Secret Fan,"" as a movie, is just a wanna-be!",1340755200,16,3792,4.52992700729927
4717463,3,B005KG4DWU,"I hate the book after reading it.  I rented the movie because I grew up in Hong Kong watching Chinese dramas and movies and I watched Li Bing Bing's other TV dramas and movies and loved them.  She played Lily in this movie. As someone who hates the book, I find the movie much better than the book, even though it's not one bit as good as the other historical dramas and movies played by Li Bing Bing before.  The movie edited the plot in the book where Lily and Snowflower were teenagers and were writing Nu Shu on their naked private body parts.  In the movie, Lily and Snowflower were writing Nu Shu on their shoulders and they were little kids.  I played the same game with my sister when I was a little kid in elementary school.  She wrote Chinese characters on my back and I would guess what characters they were. I then did the same to her.  The movie improved this  rather perverted and wierd Nu Shu body writing from the novel into an innocent and normal child's play. So I have to give the screen play writer my thumbs up for changing that, and accurately depicting this game, probably played by lots of little Chinese kids.  May be the author in the novel is American and tried to Americanized this game too much into something that can sell to the American readers.

When the movie incorporated modern day life as a parallel to the ancient fictional story written by Sophia, the entire Snowflower and Secret Fan story becomes much more logical and sensible than the novel.  In the movie, Sophia was incorporating her real life experience and also her knowledge about the Nu Shu to write the Snowflower and the Secret Fan novel that has yet to be published.  Her best friend Nina uncovered the manuscript after Sophia's traffic accident and by reading it, she came to better understand what her best friend Sophia was going through.

I have problems with the novel quoting the Nu Shu writing on the fan into some stupid low intelligent and shallow English translation that totally got me scratching my Chinese head.  But the Nu Shu messages recited by the characters in Mandarine in the movie are totally logical and culturally accurate.

The novel centers the story too much on foot binding.  To me, the novel blows the foot binding part of the Chinese women's life in that period of China into much bigger proportion and is totally misleading. The only thing I don't like about the movie is that the movie picks up 100% of the inaccurate foot binding tradition from the novel.  But since Sophia in the movie is from Korea and she only wrote a manuscript and not a hugely successful best seller, I can forgive Sophia for being misinformed.  Small feet and small shoes were high fashion for wealthy family.  Poor families needed their daughters to raise kids and do chores in the house, and sometimes work as maids for wealthy people, so they couldn't afford to bind their daughters' feet.  I know because I read enough Chinese books about foot binding and I happened to have a great great grandmother who worked as maid in the late Qing Dynasty. Her boss's daughter's feet were bound so she was hired to serve the wealthy family's daughter, to be her walking stick.  My great great grandmother, her mother and her sisters never had their feet bound because they needed their feet to make a living and to take care of themselves....My grandmother told me that my great great grandmother was able to survive the Japanese Occupation because her feet were not bound and she was able to run.  Women whose feet were bound had huge difficulties in walking and often needed help to even move around the house.  They were totally dependent on others' assistance.  It's crazy to see how Lily was poor and yet she could afford to have feet that were 3 inches small.  At least the movie tells the audience that the Snowflower and Secret Fan story was just the manuscript of a novel written by a Korean girl and it was really fictional...  But when I was reading the  novel that claims to be telling a Chinese story from that period of time, poor Lily's marriage to a rich family and her bound feet were flaws that became too disturbing, too illogical and totally ruined the story's credibility to me.  Given the cultural restriction and the cast system at that time in China, Lily should have married the butcher and Snowflower should have married the wealthy family.
I can accept the movie even though I feel it's a little too bored and lame compared to Li Bing Bing's (the lead actress) other works.  At least Lily and Snowflower in the movie are talking sensible and logical Chinese instead of some weird English translation that don't make sense to me.  I find the movie okay, even though not great.",1340496000,,4703,4.590909090909091
4717464,1,B005KG4DWU,"Lots of reviewers have talked about this movie, the good and the bad. I will, therefore, talk about my experience alone, based on someone who LOVED the book.

I do not overstate that I cherished CHERISHED the first time I read this book. It TOOK YOU to a place, a time, an experience, a friendship. The intimate details of pain and heritage that comes with foot binding. The lack of motherly love. The friendship that got 2 girls through their horrible food binding and their tumultuous childhood. Their secret language.

The movie was, let's just say, weird. It focused on the foot binding for...oh, I'm going to say...three minutes. And those scenes were spread apart. The intimate childhood friendship that started and made us want to cheer them on? Not found in the movie. Just a bunch of modern-day friendship comparison. What? I know! So sad.

This movie was such a disappointment. If you loved the book, for the love of goodness, rent the movie. Don't buy it.

If you have not read the book..please, please do not let this stupid movie dissuade you from reading what is one of my very favorite books of ALL TIME. As a matter-of-fact, put this movie totally out of your mind when you read the book. Don't even imagine these characters in your visions while reading the book.

I would not recommend this movie for anyone. Sorry to be so blatant and tough, but the book was beautiful and detailed and compelling. The movie is NONE of these things.",1339977600,7,1451,4.65234375
4717465,2,B005KG4DWU,"Compared to the book, this film is missing the substance of the girls' close relationship. Sweet and loving moments shared between the girls as well as painful traditions they endure in the novel are glazed over to make way for the modern storyline taken on in the movie. The combination of the modern and ancient narratives sacrificed the quality and detail of both stories. I know people always say the book is better than the movie, but in this case, the movie plot is so different from the novel that I'm not even sure you can call this film ""Snow Flower and the Secret Fan.""
  Without comparing it to the book, this movie tried to follow two very deep-rooted and complicated relationships and I didn't feel emotionally connected to either due to a lack of detailed exploration. However, if you're into Asian female dramas, although this film ranks far below the likes of ""The Joy Luck Club"" and ""The Vertical Ray of the Sun"", it may satisfy your itch.",1339718400,,956,4.650887573964497
4717466,2,B005KG4DWU,"After loving the poignant, sad, wistful story contained in the book, I was eager to see how the movie measured up. I'd hoped to see the beautiful story on the written page come to life on the screen.

I was utterly disappointed.

The movie is split between what occurs in the book (the story of Snow Flower and Lily) and a modern parallel story that never occurs in the book at all. I didn't want to see a ""modernized"" version of this amazing story. I wanted to see the story itself! The constant interruption between the past and present stories was irritating and disruptive to the beautifully sad tale of Snow Flower and Lily.

In addition, and perhaps because the movie writers decided to massacre the book by making the movie a half-modern parallel, there isn't enough time to tell Snow Flower and Lily's tale at all. Scenes are short, abrupt, jumping years ahead within minutes of each other. It might have been more effective if there'd been some narration by Lily to explain what was happening in certain scenes, and why. Someone who hasn't read the book won't understand entire portions of the story, especially if they know nothing about Chinese culture and history. Gripping sections of the book, such as the foot-binding of the girls, which is described in agonizing detail, in the movie is just a short 30-second glimpse that reveals nothing of the prolonged agony these children suffered (2 full years of being confined while their feet ""healed"" from the mutilation). The scenes where the families flee from the rebellion are brief, showing nothing of the horror, death, starvation, and struggle for survival (except one brief glimpse of a child dying). Lily's first meeting with her husband is completely different from the book (in the book, he was shy, polite, and kind). Lily's pride and naivety, and eventual self-examination and humility, are never portrayed at all.

Bottom line: just read the book. The movie is like someone took the book, chopped it into pieces, then tried to superglue it back together, and in all the wrong places, with half the pieces missing. The book is beautiful. Whether it's historically accurate or not is debatable, but I found it fascinating, sad, and moving.",1338940800,,2210,4.86968085106383

This is a real and touching story and is in fact quite different from the book.  But it's not a book folks.  IT'S A MOVIE.  A movie is a director's realm and the director has the creative license to create an entirely new story or to adapt, create, or change from a novel, an idea, a short story, a painting or any other art form. Please, try to remember that a film is not a book.  It is a photographic creation.  To criticize a film because it is different from it's literary inspiration is as ridiculous as criticizing a movie based on historical events if it deviates from historical facts.

4717468,4,B005KG4DWU,A truly beautiful movie but please do not miss reading this most incredible book (available on Amazon of course) by Lisa See.  The movie was a joy to watch but so much was just missing from the book; and having to parallel the story with a modern story was tedious at times.  But worth seeing just for the visuals of China--a beautiful period piece.,1336953600,,349,4.4375
4717469,2,B005KG4DWU,"I will admit two things right off the bat: First, that I am an unabashed history nerd and inordinately fond of beautifully portrayed historical films; second, that I am of the camp who has actually read Snow Flower and the Secret Fan by Lisa See and fell in love with the moving story of Lily and Snow Flower and their deep and complex bond. While this movie wasn't terrible, this was not the beautiful and heartrending story told in the book. I openly admit that I was hoping for a visually stunning, dramatic, epic, and emotional film portrayal of a story that had the potential to be all of those things and more. Those who have not read the book might very well enjoy the movie, but I was just too disappointed to do so.

As with many other reviewers, I was pretty let down by the addition of Lily and Snow Flower's supposed modern-day counterparts, Nina and Sophia. I get where they were trying to go with it, but it just didn't work. If it had been just an intro, maybe... but it wasn't. And it got really old, really fast. They bounced back and forth between the two different stories, and the end result was that neither got the attention it deserved. As they were entirely created for the film, I would have liked to have known more about Nina and Sophia and their friendship. I would have liked to have seen more of a connection between the two stories (aside from using the same actresses); the provided thread was awkward and tenuous at best. I would have liked to have seen more of Nina's struggle to redeem herself to her family and recover from her setback. I would have liked to have seen a few more examples of Sophia's supposedly unwise life choices. I still don't quite understand what Hugh Jackman had to do with *anything.* I feel the two stories would have done better just made into two completely separate films.

Also, many of the details that made Lisa See's story so gripping and special were completely lost. Most of the most dramatic and haunting events from the book were almost completely cut out of the movie if not flat out missing, including Lily's ultimate condemnation and public betrayal of Snow Flower. Even if they had included it, no one would have understood why it was so devastating for everyone involved. We never understand why Lily was so desperate for love. Snow Flower's undeserved descent into poverty and shame is barely touched on. The foot-binding and typhoid epidemic are glossed over, and the highly traumatic and life-altering escape from the Taiping rebels? If you go by the movie, a couple dozen folks hustled to a field about a mile or so down the road, spent one night outside under multiple quilts and a very light snowfall, there was one death, and then they were all magically back home again not even worse for wear. No sense of serious danger, hardship, or horror whatsoever. It isn't even emphasized why that singular death was as pivotal to the story as it was. If I hadn't read the book, I would have wondered what they were even doing out there in the first place.

In conclusion, the movie is not un-watchable. It does have some touching moments. To me however, it just was not Snow Flower and the Secret Fan.",1336780800,,3178,4.562171628721541

4717477,2,B005KG4DWU,"Oops, I meant 'tres chick.' The movie cuts back and forth between pairs of friends centuries apart, one in the time when Chinese women's feet were bound, the other in the current day. Back then, social norms very nearly created segregated worlds for men and women, especially in the upper classes. As a result, friendships between women had a special closeness.

Despite the lovely actresses, especially Bingbing Li, the story came across as inert. I didn't gain insight from comparing the two friendships, and that's really all the movie tried to offer. If you love ""relationships"" movies, then Snow Flower might suit you. I'm a guy who likes guy movies, though, and this was too chicky for me.

4717482,3,B005KG4DWU,"My sister and I watched the DVD recently. She never read the novel. I have. Twice. She enjoyed the movie but several times asked the significance of things taking place in the Snow Flower/Lily story. When the movie was over she asked me if the book jumps back and forth so much like the movie did. NOT AT ALL. She then said she understood from the film that the modern day girls (who are not part of the novel) were very close friends but that with the way the film lingered on Snow Flower and Lily are we supposed to wonder if they were lovers. NO.

I found the film a real disappointment. I understand that film cannot follow novels. But I have read many books that have film adaptations that I have loved just as much as the novel. If you've not read the book you will probably like the movie. If you have read the novel be prepared for disappointment to say the least. Snow Flower and Lily maybe get as much screen time as Nina and Sofia (modern day story line characters not in the novel). But Snow Flower and Lily's ""laotong"" story are so smudged and fingerprinted by the modern day parallel that they almost seem erased. I do not think the modern day parallel was necessary to bring Snow Flower and the Secret Fan to the big screen. It did not really do any justice to the ""laotong"" relationship the story is centered on.

I would suggest that if you have not read the novel but liked the movie then by all means be motivated to actually read (or listen to) the novel. With just the movie all you got was gravy with some gravel thrown into it. (Glad you enjoyed the gravy.)

4717486,5,B005KG4DWU,"My wife, 12-yr old daughter, 21-yr old daughter and I just watched this film.  My wife and older daughter read the book and both proclaimed it ""fantastic.""  When we watched the movie they both mentioned that it was not like the book in many ways.  This does not mean, however, that it's a bad movie.  On the contrary, I found it to be both compelling and worthy.

I was particularly interested in watching this movie because I have lived in the orient and I was eager to see how it would be depicted.  There is something that most Americans do not understand, and that is that oriental cultures have histories and deep-seated traditions that Americans have a difficult time imagining.  This movie is about one such custom - a custom where young women bind themselves to one another in a life-long mutually supportive relationship.

These relationships were vital to the happiness of many Chinese women, especially those of higher social status.  Marriage for them was almost always a matter of an arrangement for social status, wealth, alliances between families, etc.  They were seldom marriages of love, at least initially.  The primary role of women in that society was to provide their husbands with social status and sons.  Since this is the case, women of status relied heavily on female-female relationships for emotional support.

This film depicts this sort of relationship, and involved three interwoven story lines - one set in early 1800s China, one set in modern Shanghai, and one set about a decade or so earlier than today.

As you watch the film you will see parallels between the story lines, and the same two women play the main characters in all three story lines.  I found that to be a memorable part of the film.

I found the cinematography, the acting, and the story lines to be compelling and meaningful.  The flow of the movie would be seen by some viewers as plodding, but I found the pacing to be extremely appropriate for the story being told.  I thought that the settings of the stories, the relationships portrayed, and the overall experience were memorable.

I am extremely glad I watched this film, and I would be happy to watch it again.

If you are looking for gunplay, explosions, and lots of special effects...keep walking.  If, however, you are looking for a meaningful story, a piece of historical fiction, and a memorable experience, then this film may be for you.

5 stars!  Thanks for the story!",1324252800,20,2435,4.786570743405276

I missed the theatrical run, and so waited patiently for it come out on DVD. Unfortunately, this is a terrible adaptation of a heartbreakingly beautiful work, taking too many artistic liberties, and butchering the story in such a manner as to render it incomprehensible to those who read and loved the book. If you watch this movie without having read the book, then it might appeal on some level, but to those who savored the detailed descriptions of traditions in 19th century China, and the close bond between the two central characters, i.e. Snow Flower and Lily, this movie seems such an aberration and I truly felt let down.

The movie takes a different approach than the novel in that it has two parallel story lines - one set in the present featuring two young women who are kindred spirits, but whose friendship is eventually strained by conflicting ideas regarding relationships, lifestyle, etc. On the same day that she receives news that she has a job opportunity in New York, Nina (Li BingBing) receives news that her estranged best friend, Sophia (Gianna Jun) has been in an accident and is in hospital. As Nina goes through Sophia's things at the hospital, she comes across a manuscript, parts of a story of two women in 19th century China, whose friendship mirror Nina and Sophia's own close bond.

The trouble is that this parallel storyline does not work - by dividing the story up into two disparate timelines, not much time is spent in developing the central characters. The most affected here is the story in the present - viewers are given brief glimpses of Nina and Sophia bonding over music etc. but their friendship is meant to be an unbreakable bond and this is not credibly portrayed. The story of the two laotongs or ""old sames"" (sort of like sisters of the heart) set in 19th century China is much more credibly portrayed, ironically played by the same actresses playing the parts of Nina and Sophia in the present.

Lily and Snow Flower are the laotongs, coming from two very different social classes. The poorer of the two, Lily, has her feet bound to perfection under the supervision of a zealous mother. The scenes of foot binding are rather uncomfortable to watch, but they are nowhere near as gruesome as the graphic descriptions provided by Ms. See in her novel. Lily's perfect lotus bud feet eventually garner her a very advantageous marriage, but poor Snow Flower ends up being married off to a butcher despite her rich beginnings.

In the novel, readers are given a deep insight into the secret language of women, i.e. nushu which provides an intimate glimpse into the lives of women in 19th century China (historically nushu was the language used by the women of the Yao ethnic minority). Reading between the lines, readers get the idea that it is Snow Flower who has a more interesting sex life than Lily, but in the movie, viewers get a brief glimpse of this, not through nushu, but of Lily playing peeping tom. It just completely put me off - such short cuts when it was completely unnecessary, not to mention detracting from the very essence of the novel.

Then there's the disaster in the form of Aussie actor Hugh Jackman (it begs the question, why did he stoop to such a role in the first place?). Any actor could have played his role, but I guess the filmmakers thought they could get the movie more exposure with a star presence? Jackman plays Sophia's on-off lover and his most 'memorable' scene here is him serenading Sophia at a party and indulging in some serious liplocking. Sigh...need I continue?

Final verdict - fans of the novel should steer away from this disaster of an adaptation, and those who haven't read the book will probably not miss much, though I'd recommend the book over the movie anytime.",1322784000,48,4110,4.992700729927007

4717498,5,B005KG4DWU,"Is it a book?
I was once a purist and thought art only belongs to the artist then I discovered that without an audience to interpret - it isn't art. So I also once thought that symbol based runes called words shouldn't be subverted by some visual/auditory medium called a movie. Then I discovered an interview between the author of a book and the director of it's movie interpretation.  The author was pleased that the movie provided what the book couldn't - the visuals, sounds as well as a more complex character and more of the plot and settings for which words were inadequate. The director said that the movie by it's nature couldn't be just another book but it actually is a unique creation and experience. So, my response to those that didn't like the movie because it wasn't a book is to just not watch the movie.

Is it a love story?
Yes, it's about Laotong which is the life long bond and support between two girls that is equivalent to being sisters forever. The storyline for this ""forever"" is found in the lives of two girls in feudal 1850s -'60s China and in parallel two girls in 2010. In both periods the girls come from different socio-economic families and in both periods they end up as women with a reversal of those statuses.

Is it about oppression?
Yes, the girls are shown being prepared to be married and I paraphrase from the movie,""There is no purer ambition for a woman than to be a better wife.""
By magnificent scripting we find one of the 2010 woman preparing an exhibit on China's outlawing of foot binding where a girl, usually around the age of 10, has her feet broken and bound in cloth so that they fit within a 3"" lotus shoe. A practice that is shown taking place with our 1850s girls. Seeing that pain makes the movie better than the book and to further the story we cannot help but see how our 2010 women seem to be painfully bound to their high heels. In feudal CHina (Some say it's still down in a few rural areas.) it not only helped to restrain the female to the house but to increase her sexual attractiveness. Sound familiar!

Overview:
I commend the actors for their excellent portrayals; the script writers for their timeless blending and contemporization of both the life-long love and the oppression that women face in this world; to the director for the flawless editing/blending of the lives in these two time periods. Also presented was a sub-story of the brutal Taiping rebellion which would have separated the sexes; outlawed foot binding, Buddhism, Confucianism and imposed Christianity.",1322006400,,2541,4.62749445676275
4717499,4,B005KG4DWU,"SNOW FLOWER AND THE SECRET FAN is the cinematic adaptation of Lisa See's popular novel by writers Angela Workman,  Ron Bass and Michael K. Ray and director Wayne Wang.  The film unveils parallel stories between 19th century China and present day Shanghai - the tales of two women joined by laotong - a binding vow and contract to be eternal friends and share each others lives - communicating with a secret women's language called nu shu, carefully inked characters placed on the folds between the spines of a silken fan.  By using the same actresses to play the parts of the girls two centuries apart adds a mysterious beauty to the films alluring flavor.

In 1826 Lily and Snow Flower become laotung and though they are from opposite ends of the social stratum they become devoted friends, undergoing the ritual of having their feet broken and bound to remain  very small as adults - apparently a desired attribute for physical attraction as a potential bride.  The poor girl is chosen for marriage by a wealthy family and the rich girl is promised to a butcher, an extreme reversal of roles in society and it is the manner in which each adapts and aids the other that demonstrates the depth of the bond of laotong.  Concurrently in the film we meet Nina and Sophie in contemporary Shanghai: Nina has gained education and stature and is due to move to New York as part of an important business.  Sophie is in an accident and only slowly do we realize that Sophie had the promise of moving to Australia to marry an Aussie singer (Hugh Jackman), more because she is pregnant than for love. Because of the laotung between Nina and Sophie the two make sacrifices that overcome all else to prove their loyalty. There are many parallels in the two stories that show a bond between the two sets of girls and to capture this bond securely the two girls form centuries apart are played by the same actresses: Lily/Nina become the roles of Bing Bing Li and Snow Flower/Sophie are portrayed by Gianna Jun.  The supporting cast is carefully chosen and uniformly fine.

The sets and costumes and music enhance this film significantly.  It is not a great epic of a movie, but it has a tender and touching story that is very well told by everyone involved.  Grady Harp, November 11",1321747200,,2268,4.628428927680798
