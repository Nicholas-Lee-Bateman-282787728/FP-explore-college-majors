2894751,5,B000T5MP7C,Adult audience gut-busting humor to offend everyone with realism and perspective. Highly recommended for attitude adjustment and mindless entertainment value.,1319328000,,158,6.95
2894752,5,B000T5MP7C,"If you like Bill Maher, you will love DL Hughley.

I will watch anything with DL, even if it is just an interview.  He is funny of course, but his social commentary is needed.  The fact that he can make you laugh your butt off while speaking truth, logic, and reason is just genius.
This video is great.",1318032000,,303,4.189655172413793
2894753,5,B000T5MP7C,"DL Hughley is a comical genius.
He has the timing of one of those expensive grandfather clocks or a rolex.
Impeccable , and worth listening to on repeat, even after i'm dead i'm gonna have some 22 inch speakers on either side of my grave to play DL Hughley.

2894754,5,B000T5MP7C,"This had me cracking up throughout the entire thing! DL is quite intelligent and aware of current events and he makes it quite evident in his comedy. We need more comedians who can find humor in everyday life and who also enlighten the audience about politics, religion, and the like. This is absolutely great and well-worth the money!",1256256000,,335,4.793103448275862

2894756,5,B000T5MP7C,"I thought his previous show on HBO a few years ago was hilarious, but this one topped it. Having seen DL's bit on Comic View years ago, I never thought he was very funny. His part in the Kings of Comedy was so so, to me. His TV show was good, but his last 2 HBO Specials have convinced me that this man is brilliant. His appearances on Bill Maher's show on HBO shows a sample of his comedy and intelligence (yes, he's intelligent along with being funny), but this show is over the top funny. I've encouraged co-workers to watch the show and/or buy the DVD every chance I've gotten.",1191283200,21,581,4.243243243243243
