8417757,5,B00031V21W,"I watched ""Late Night Shopping"" one night, then put it on the next night, and the next. Ridiculous plot lines and endearing characters make for quite a funny film. I love the idea that you could be living with someone and never see them. I love the questions posed (which happen to be quite pertinent to twenty-somethings, or anyone working a dead-end job): ""And then what?"" ""So, what now?"" Well, if you don't know the answer to those questions, you can at least put on this film and have a laugh. Highly recommended. Enjoy.",1110931200,3,524,4.585106382978723
8417758,5,B00031V21W,"""Late Night Shopping"" is done in the style of movies such as ""Swingers,"" ""Clerk's,"" and other sorts of generally chatty films, except these people have great British accents.  However, there is most certainly a plot, and a charming one at that.  The scenes in the film all connect somehow, bringing together the lives of the characters in a very fun, and smooth, way.  The four main characters are friends who initially bonded over the fact that they all work graveyard shifts at thankless jobs.  However, a deep friendship has blossomed between the four, which is even more evident by the end of the film.  One of the characters, Sean, is trying to save his relationship with his girlfriend -- a storyline that ends up entangling the entire group.  The film is funny, bright and delightful.  I thoroughly enjoyed ""Late Night Shopping,"" and I recommend it highly.",1109030400,2,863,4.86986301369863
8417759,4,B00031V21W,This may not be a great film as many reviews suggest. But like the charectors in the film it is a good company. a warm and charming film that touches your heart and lingers in your mind long after you have seen. in my case it has been more than two years when i saw the film in a european film festival in India. And i have been wanting to watch the film for long.thankfully i can now watch it again on dvd. i recommened this film strongly especially for some of those lonely nights that don't seems to end. happy viewing.,1096588800,3,522,4.127450980392157
