4406383,5,B004LWZWFQ,"You should probably know ahead of time that Spider-Man's origin has been altered in the film. Several things have been switched around including how Peter Parker becomes Spider-Man, his parents, Uncle Ben, and Gwen Stacy. The interesting part is that it kind of feels necessary for a film like this. Telling the exact same story again would be completely redundant. They've kept the big events the same, but altered the little ones. It's like taking a different path you haven't taken before to reach the same destination.

As soon as the film begins, you can already feel the chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone. They say so little at first, but their body language, facial expressions, and that never ending gleam in their eyes lets you know way ahead of time that the spark between them is already starting to grow. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is very much a human story meaning the characters and the story take a front seat. There's still a ton of action, but it's really only to help progress an already engrossing story.

Andrew Garfield is particularly spectacular in the role of Peter Parker. He's completely different in comparison to Tobey Maguire; both in appearance and performance. Garfield is more slender and taller than Maguire. This version of Spider-Man seems to actually embrace the smart mouth aspect of the character in ""The Amazing Spider-Man."" The car thief with the knife scene is the best example. It also seems like Garfield's Peter Parker goes through a hell of a lot more in one movie than Tobey Maguire did. It feels more emotional and more tragic. You don't even see anything remotely resembling the Spider-Man suit for nearly an hour.

The special effects are pretty astounding, as well. Oscorp's technology is as impressive as Tony Stark's is in the ""Iron Man"" movies. The Lizard looks pretty fantastic for being mostly CG. Rhys Ifans does a phenomenal job as Dr. Curt Connors. He has this sequence in the sewer after he's already transformed a few times where he's arguing with himself that is really impressive.

The 3D is also the best to come along in quite some time. It mostly comes into play when Spider-Man is web slinging through the city (as his feet or webbing jump out at you) and during credit sequences, but there's also an endless amount of debris that flies into the camera. The first person Spider-Man sequences may visually be the best thing about the movie. All those little kids who have dreamt of being Spider-Man now have a visual aid to back it up.

The superhero blockbuster packs a lot of brains into its 136-minute runtime. The amount of science crammed into the film including the cross species genetics stuff is very interesting. But the way Peter incorporates natural spider-like qualities into his abilities is also really cool; Garfield certainly deserves a lot of credit for that. When Spider-Man is trying to find The Lizard, he makes a spider web in the sewer and waits for something to come to him.

Does it bother anyone else the way Peter Parker seems to throw his secret identity around like it's nothing? Maybe it's because the comics played up the importance of it so much and Peter wasn't taking off his mask in public six times in the span of two hours, but it just feels like everybody knows who he is by the time the movie ends.

""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is pretty extraordinary for a reboot of a beloved franchise. In fact, it's better than it really has any right to be. The 3D isn't a complete waste, the special effects are fantastic, the action sequences are extremely impressive, and the entire cast keeps your eyes glued to the screen. The battles between Spider-Man and The Lizard are pretty breathtaking.

But is it better than the original trilogy? It's difficult to say. This is like discovering a new formula to reach a similar result. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is slightly darker in tone and less campy than the ""Spider-Man"" films. Visually incredible, intimate, emotional, and intelligent; ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a sensational entry in the superhero genre that lives up to the Spider-Man name.",1341014400,4,4098,4.844285714285714
4406384,5,B004LWZWFQ,"Warning, there's a few spoilers!

 I'll admit I was a tad skeptical about the movie. Not in a bad way, but I was unsure if the series really needed a reboot. Sure the third movie sucked, but to have seen a follow-up to it would have been a good idea. However, after seeing an advance screening of this movie in IMAX 3D tonight, I Rescind all my doubts.

No, really. This movie is spectacular. Everything about it was just... Awesome. In fact, if anything, the Raimi movies don't really interest me anymore, no matter how much I loved SM2. I know that's a bold statement to make, but seriously, this film fixes everything wrong with the Raimi movies, and is definitely more than just an apology for Spider Man 3.

For one, it all starts with the tone. From the opening scene where Peter gets ready for a game of Hide and Seek, there's shades of Nolan's Batman movies in it. Throughout the movie there is an air of neo-noir, in a similar fashion to ""Drive""- even the score hints to a bit of a film noir feel. It suits the film because if anything this is an origin story before a superhero movie. The dark and gritty tone still stays consistent throughout, even in the action scenes.

The story might not be totally original but it all comes down to how they handle it, and they sure handle it well. How Peter finds the clues to an unfinished experiment in Uncle Ben's flooded basement, and how he manages to piece the algorithm together with Curtis Connors. They do a good job of balancing out the origin story and the action, I dare say! And the chemistry between Gwen and Peter was very believable too. They didn't devote too much time to the love story, which is always a good thing. The contrast between Peter and Curtis is fantastic as well, and if anything is one of the better hero/villain chemistry works in recent years.

As for the action scenes? INCREDIBLE. I must say, I love how they kept them grounded and realistic,saving the epic sweep until the big finale. They scrapped the campy and over the top feel of the original movies and give us rough and brutal fights, just how we want it. Garfield handles the action well and you can tell he did a lot of his own stunts too. The fight scenes between Spider Man and Lizard were fantastic, especially the grand finale in the Oscorp tower at the end!

And the acting. I must say the acting was fantastic. Garfield KNOCKED IT OUT OF THE PARK, here. MacGuire was too much of a metrosexual pansy for me to take him seriously. Garfield is a total nerd, and as a result, he gets the role right. He even looks nerdy, and it helps as well. The way he manages to hold back his British accent is extraordinary as well, and his humourous kick he adds to the character works too. Emma Stone is fantastic as Gwen Stacy and adds real depth to the character, in an almost unexpected way. Her and Peter Parker's chemistry works on every level. Ifans is a great villain, and he manages to add an air of sympathy to the villain, making his transformation into the Lizard very tragic and poignant. And Leary... Well, what can we say? Brilliant and funny as usual, he even ad libs a few lines, and you'll know which lines those are (""do I look like the mayor of Tokyo?!"").

In short, Webb, Stone, Garfield and Ifans have knocked one out of the park. An absolutely stellar effort thanks to great talent and I can assure you that I  will be seeing the movie again. And I can also assure you that this is a must see, with tons of action, intrigue, humour and dark tone as well. Do not miss it!",1340841600,5,3529,4.37557251908397

4406672,4,B004LWZWFQ,"It is a shame that the Marc Webb trilogy will never be finished. The films build, or rather rebuild, the world well. Webb took some liberties with Peter's parents that sadly will not have a chance to pay off without the third film.

The CGI and web swinging looks better than the Raimi film and showcase how far the technology has advanced in the decade separating the two.

This new take has plenty of heart, even if it does not tie into the larger Marvel cinematic universe. While I'm excited for Homecoming, and to finally see Spider-Man in a world with Avengers, I would have liked to see Webb's take on the Sinister Six.",1499385600,,625,4.473684210526316
4406673,4,B004LWZWFQ,"Released in 2012 and directed by Marc Webb, The Amazing Spider-Man stars Andrew Garfield as geeky teen Peter Parker, who is bit by a radioactive spider and acquires spider-like powers. Emma Stone plays his girlfriend, Gwen Stacy, while Denis Leary plays her father, the captain of the NYPD. Rhys Ifans plays the one-armed Dr. Curt Connors, who develops a dubious serum which morphs him into a human Lizard. Sally Field and Martin Sheen appear as Aunt May & Uncle Ben whereas Irrfan Khan is on hand as Connors suspicious superior.

While this is a solid Spider-Man film with an effective cast it cant hold a candle to the film it reboots, 2002s Spider-Man, which was still fresh in the mind in 2012 (and still is). Compare the Spider-Man costumes, for instance, particularly the masks; there's no contest. The story is basically the same except that (1.) Gwen Stacy is the girlfriend instead of Mary Jane, (2.) the Lizard is the villain instead of the Green Goblin, (3.) Spider-Man uses artificial web-shooters rather than intrinsic ones, and (4.) Captain Stacy basically replaces J. Jonah Jameson.

The movie run 142 minutes and was shot in New York City and Los Angeles (or points nearby).

We're all capable of looking over the fact that this was not a creative adventure that gave us a glimpse at a different episode of the Spiderman legacy.

The poorly cast new kid who plays  the hero heads a cast that looks like they're straight out of the Glee Club. The confrontation with the campus bully, the involvement of the most true girl in the school...  it reveals or explores any aspect that would be considered worth the investment in a movie production. It's not what I'd expect from a modern-era superhero movie. They've made an online purchase of attractive blanket to throw over the diehard family couch at a night club.

Unfortunately the rest of the foundation quickly crumbled to forgettable dust.  The film was flat, the characters boring and lacking in depth.  Much was left to the viewers personal knowledge of the Spider-Man story line.  The chemistry between the characters did not exist. No real emotion displayed.  Forced emotion is simply not satisfying when there is a real love story bubbling just below the surface.  After watching this lackluster display of cinematic nonsense, I went back and watched Toby McGuire's version.  So much much better on many levels.

I understand giving him a more a human face allowed him to more easily express his insidious intent as he said ""Peter"".

4407255,5,B004LWZWFQ,"'The Amazing Spiderman"" made me realize something: I never liked the original ""Spiderman."" I mean, I liked it in the sense that it was the only Spiderman movie adaptation ever, but there were things that really bothered me. I never liked the cartoonish tone with an emphasis on comedy over drama. I liked Tobey McGuire as the nerdy Peter Parker, but his whiny voice made him a terrible Spiderman. I never liked the organic web shooters, because I felt the mechanic ones were important to his mythos. I never liked Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane - thought she was a snaggle-toothed plain jane. But I loved the movie because, hey, it was Spiderman on the big screen. Now that we have a new Spiderman movie, it's like seeing Spiderman for the first time. Frankly, I think it makes the old ""Spiderman"" look like crap.

Let's review. The plot is familiar. Teenager gets bitten by a spider and gets spider powers. His dear Uncle Ben is killed by a criminal he could have stopped, leading him to adopt the persona of Spiderman to fight crime. Along the way, he encounters a mad scientist who turns himself into an evil villain. It sounds a lot like the first Spiderman, and  some have complained about how closely the story is to the original Spiderman. Frankly, that attitude makes no sense to me. It's Spiderman's origin. The original movie followed the origin from the original comic with some minor changes. The new version already makes some radical changes. To change the story even more would make it unrecognizable. Anyway, I think the two stories are like night and day.

I thought Parker's journey was richer and more complex than the original movie. The subplot of the mystery of his parents was long overdue, considering how many TV shows and movies Spiderman has had without ever addressing the fact that he was raised by his aunt and uncle. Parker's evolution towards becoming a crimefighter felt more realistic with his motivation of finding his uncle's killer, not just randomly fighting crime. Overall, good stuff.

I've read some reviews complaining about the dark tone of this movie. This, to me, is akin to the people complaining about how dark the Batman movies are compared to the sixties TV show. If you think it's too dark, then you don't know the source material. The comic book Spiderman has always wallowed in misery and sadness.

I found the characters of this movie more three-dimensional. I think Andrew Garfield is a rare actor like Christian Bale or Christopher Reeve who can play both the hero and the alter ego equally well - he's a fantastic Spiderman, as well as a great Peter Parker. I like that he's more of a flawed human being than the saintly nerd Tobey McGuire played.  Likewise, Uncle Ben isn't a Jesus-like character whose only purpose is to dispense advice and get killed. Aunt May isn't the stereotypical sweet old lady. It all felt more three-dimensional.

It's not perfect. I didn't think the Lizard wasn't as compelling a villain as he could have been, and some cliches have still crept into the script. Yet overall, I thought it was a great movie that brought new life to the faltering Spiderman series. Too bad the sequel blew it, but this one still holds up.",1474416000,,3199,4.732495511669659

4407398,4,B004LWZWFQ,"I have never found Spider-Man to be a very appealing character. He seems to be someone that I think everyone except for me can relate to for various reasons. Peter Parker has always been a timid, shy, smart teenager and later he would grow into a very capable and relatable character. Sam Raimis trilogy focused too much on Spider-Man as a sort of everyman character. However, Marc Webbs reboot presents a different version of Spider-Man, a version that I personally prefer. The Amazing Spider-Man follows Peter Parker as a high schooler and the struggles and concerns surrounding the life of a teenager. To be fair, Spider-Man was presented as a teenager and works best, to me, in the confines of a young adult growing into the person that he is meant to become. While he is touring the laboratories at Oscorp Industries, Peter is bitten by a radioactive spider which endows him with super human abilities. When a traumatic event occurs in his life, Peter comes to the realization that he has to use his gifts to help others. Many of the movies best moments come from the different departures from some of the source material and the movies and cartoons that proceeded it. The Amazing Spider-Man takes inspiration from the Ultimate Spider-Man series which in part explains many of these departures.  To begin with the Good Things that the movie presents. The story is very good as an origin story and it presents many things in a different light. Although the main villains goals are very murky and questionable, overall the movie has a very compelling story.  James Horners musical score is very good. Probably not as iconic as Danny Elfmans from the previous Spider-Man trilogy, but Horner really presents the majesty and playfulness of Spider-Man. In the comics, there is a great deal of mystery surrounding Peter Parkers childhood and his parents death. This movie does a fantastic job of presenting this mystery and gradually contributing to it in the movie, while not giving so much away, this could be seen as an obvious attempt to set up sequels, which is or was a good idea. As I mentioned before, the high school setting for the movie was a great idea and Marc Webb did an amazing job bringing it to film. Andrew Garfield was a great actor to be cast as the young Peter Parker, he does a great job portraying the character from the script..but does he do a great job portraying the Peter Parker from the comics? Maybe not, but thats not his fault. Emma Stone is also great as Peters love interest, Gwen Stacy. Both of them have great scenes together and really work well with one another, this can be seen in almost all of their scenes, but of course the question persists do they accurately portray the Gwen and Peter from the comics? Probably not, but as I said before, they do a great job portraying the film characters of Peter and Gwen.  I enjoyed the presentation of Oscorp Industries headed by the reclusive and ill Norman Osborn, as a mysterious corporation that engages in very worrisome and probably illegal activities involving science. I enjoy that specific presentation of Oscorp, I think a very similar version was presented in an animated television show Spectacular Spider-Man, which was a very good show. Webb presents an arguably accurate depiction of the classical nature of Spider-Mans powers and the classical web shooters instead of an organic one..which is kind of weird and creepy.  How Webb explores these powers and Peters understanding of them is fun and entertaining as well.  I am not very familiar with Denis Learys performances in other movies, but Leary in this movie portrays a very excellent foil for Spider-Man (as a public figure) in Captain George Stacy, Gwens father who is vehemently anti Spider-Man. The movie isn't without its fair share of problems as well. The characterization of Peter is off, hes quirky, full of himself, and too much like the figure he would later become as a man and not enough like the silent, genius, teenager who is struggling to find himself. He is presented as that everyman who takes up for the little guy, a notion and ideal that Peter comes to embrace gradually and isn't receptive to it initially. Spider-Mans suit is a point of contention for me as it is very dark and odd looking and doesnt look like the colorful spandex that we usually see the character wearing. Due to the nature of a reboot, somethings are going to be represented but they aren't adequately used in a different way in this reboot, particularly Uncle Ben and Aunt May. Its too much of the been there, done that mentality that the writers and Marc Webb really didn't seem to keen on addressing again for whatever reason.  Spider-Mans enemy in this movie is The Lizard, but if you were to look at him in the film you would have a hard time telling that he is in fact a lizard. The design and the characterization of the Lizard and his alter ego isn't up to snuff with other comic book villains that weve seen before. Lastly, there is a somewhat annoying tendency to use CGI and visual effects in scenes that don't require CGI, subway trains, New York skyline, Oscorp Tower, etc. Overall the movie is very enjoyable on its own right. But is it a truly accurate presentation of the Spider-Man we see in the comics. No. But it is still a very enjoyable movie.",1468540800,2,5310,4.710441334768569

Then I saw it and while I don't love it by any means, This was a great new take on the story and in some ways is more true than the original ones I grew up with.

In my opinion I believe that Andrew Garfield makes a great Spider-Man but I think Toby Macguire makes a great Peter Parker if you could get Garfield in the suit and Macguire in packers life it could be the best Spider-Man movie of all time! This movie is fun and produces some of the best Spider-Man moments of the franchise. However I don't find the Peter Parker moments believable and I find myself thinking about parkers portrayal in the comics which to me doesn't even come close to Garfields version.

4408064,5,B004LWZWFQ,When I first saw this movie I was a little hesitant about Andrew Garfield taking up the reins as Spider-Man not knowing much about him... But I was pleasantly surprised! Andrew Garfield so far is my favorite Spider-Man and not only that but the rest of the actors were great and the movie was well made! It's definitely a great movie to bring Spider-Man's story to the big screen the way that it was written!,1455494400,,408,4.453333333333333
4408065,5,B004LWZWFQ,Prefer this version to the other Spiderman with Tobey McGuire. I'm not a comic book fan so I'm just reviewing as a fan of superhero movies. I like that it was different than the other Spiderman and had The Lizard as the villain. I thought the action was good. My daughter's only complaint was that Spiderman didn't shoot webs from his hands but from something he designed in his suit. She still liked it though,1455408000,,410,4.48
4408066,5,B004LWZWFQ,"I don't know why this film didn't do better at the box office. I think that maybe they started the Spider-man films up again too soon after the last (and worst) one. I believe that if THIS film was the first one ever released, it would have set the standard very high.

Personally, I rate this up there with the very best of superhero films. The acting is very good and the characters are believable and have more depth to them, making them people we can care about and feel for, which is something very rare in such films. Modern CG effects are far superior to those of the past so they blend very well with real life stuff and action scenes don't feel like you're watching a video game. The origins plot has some very well done changes to keep it fresh. There is only ONE villain and ample time and plot given to him. It's a good choice to use a villain that had not been used in the previous series of Spiderman films.

If you have NOT already seen this film but like superhero or Spider-man comics and films, I highly recommend you rent or buy it. The Blu-ray looks and sounds very good overall and there's some decent bonus stuff included. Enjoy!",1455408000,,1151,4.324074074074074

4408283,5,B004LWZWFQ,"It seemed strange for Spider-Man to be rebooted so soon after the successful conclusion of the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man trilogy.  Yet, the result was a spectacular and amazing treat.  Andrew Garfield brings a sense of fun and lightheartedness to the character of Peter Parker/Spider-Man that seemed to be missing from Maquire's Spidey.  Peter's origin is tweaked slightly to bring a bit of mystery and intrigue into the character, and so too, the origin of Spider-Man is a bit tweaked.  The inclusion of Gwen Stacey is a wonderful choice, harkening back to the early comics, when Gwen was Spidey's love interest, not Mary Jane.  In addition, the transformation of Dr. Connors from scientist into villain feels organic...in so many movies, the hero rises and then, seemingly out of nowhere, so too does a villain to challenge him.  In this movie, the villain is not coming from left field, but rather the hero and villain, Spider-Man and the Lizard, share a background story, in creating one, the other was created.  The rise of the villain is not contrived, but rather is intrinsic in the story.

There are many great moments in this movie, but to me, among the most powerful, is the brief moment when Flash, the stereotypical jock/bully, offers a word of comfort and sympathy to Peter at the loss of his uncle.  This brief interlude is but a further example of the exceptional character development of even minor ""background"" characters like Flash.

Spider-Man remains popular in our modern mythos because he is the nerd who made good, the guy who brought hope.  He does in this movie for sure.",1453680000,2,1595,4.892193308550186

I'm still debating on wither I want to get the second one, which I really liked but the ending made me so hopping mad! Oh well, this one is great, service and all.",1451520000,,433,4.228915662650603
4408409,5,B004LWZWFQ,"I first got into comics after watching the original Sam Raimi movie. Spider-Man quickly became my favorite comic character and series. As I read more of the comic, I realized how different Raimi's movies were from the source material. Peter Parker stands out in particular as not resembling his comic character very much. Where were the wise-cracks? The jokes that Spidey is famous for? In the original trilogy, Peter Parker was basically just Tobey Maguire with spider powers. He's far too serious and stiff. There wasn't any levity to his version of Peter.

And then came along The Amazing Spider-Man. I was very busy the year it came out. I had a lot of personal stuff going on. I had heard a new Spider-Man movie was being made but didn't pay much attention to the details. I saw The Amazing Spider-Man in a theater by sheer accident. I was traveling and had a few hours to kill before my plane. Saw a theater showing the new Spider-Man. Went in to see it and was promply blown away. I went in not having watched a single trailer for the movie, not knowing what to expect. And I loved every single second of it. Andrew Garfield's Peter/Spidey was perfect. If you're familiar with the comics, then you'll instantly recognize this Peter.

There's plenty to like in this movie other than Andrew. Emma Stone is excellent as Gwen Stacy. The visual effects and action sequences are superb. Spidey's agile movements are translated perfectly from the comics. The movie perfectly shows off his acrobatic fighting style.

And while the plot isn't perfect, I still enjoyed it immensely. If you're a Spidey fan, chances are you'll like it as well :)",1451260800,2,1641,4.730769230769231

4408413,4,B004LWZWFQ,"I'm not really certain that another reboot was necessary, particularly considering that the last one wasn't given enough time to fade from our memories all that much.  That being said however, I did prefer this version to the Toby Maguire rendition.  There isn't much to differentiate the two as far as the plot goes, minor details aside, but I liked Garfield more in the role. I can't really say why definitively, maybe he just came across as somewhat more believable as far as attitude and motivation are concerned.  My biggest reason for preferring this version to the first is that technology has advanced considerably in the interim and it shows in the picture quality of the blu ray.  It's downright stellar, reference quality stuff. I honestly couldn't find a single nit to pick with the blu ray transfer, which is rare in the extreme.  That isn't to say that most movies are full of artifacts and transfer noise, but it's usually pretty easy to find a few minor issues to point to, especially with shadow detail. So if you're a videophile looking for another reference title to show off you home theater look no further.  I can't say much about the sound, as I have yet to put together the sound system I want to go with my display, but I doubt it's any less spectacular.

4408562,4,B004LWZWFQ,"This new Spider-Man (2012) movie is a reboot of the Spider-Man (2002). Since the movies are so far apart in time, it struggled to satisfy both the old and new generations of super hero movie fans. Some fans of the older generation movie may have not been satisfied with the differences that were done with the t newer Spider-Man. That is understandable, but people have to keep in mind that the director has to satisfy two types of audiences, the older and newer generation. If you can understand the reasons for the differences then the film is definitely a watch, but if you are a die-hard Sam Raimi, director of the (2002) movie, the movie is simply not for you.
 Coming in terms with differences, we start off the movie with the awkward teenager we all like, Peter Parker played by Andrew Garfield. The story is tied up closely to the comic series. The origin of the friendly neighborhood Spider Man is told for a good hour and it did a great job building the details of the superhero. Even with the details from the predecessor movie, it does a good job building on the mysteries of Peter Parkers parents and the details of the cross-species experiments that his father held. The briefcase that Peter acquires reveals all this to him and leads him to figure out his Parents mysterious disappearance. For example, the new Spider-Man movie started with a flashback to when Peters parents disappeared, but in the old trilogy, Peter was introduced as a nerdy high school kid. Marc Webb, the director of The Amazing Spider-Man, did well introducing the new spider man and his conflicts with great back story.
 The brief-case he finds leads him to a series of old research of cross-species experiments. This is what replaces the old radiation experiments that created that originally created Spider-Man. The cross experiment that Peter Finds leads him to Oscorp, where he find and gets closer to Gwen Stacy, his high school sweetheart, and his fathers old associate Curt Connors. This is where he also receives his super powers where he first uses for selfish gain and then later comes across a life changing tragedy that changes his mindset of how he uses his powers.
 As Peter discovers his super powers, Dr. Curt Connor is also discovering the uses of the cross-species serum he has created. With a missing arm, he is desperate to find a way to regenerate it back and he does that by using a lizards power to regenerate limbs and injecting that DNA to his DNA. But all goes wrong when a terrible side effect of turning into a Lizzard monster that destroys the city and only Spider-Man is up to the task of taking him down.
The Amazing Spider-Man is not the greatest film on my list, not even one of the top ten in Marvels films. Although I give it props for integrating the new technology of 2012. Spider-Man became more reliant on his cell phone of knowing where to go for crimes. His web-shooters did not come naturally from the spiders powers, but were instead made by his own genius mind. This made the movie more relatable to the audience.
 Compared to Raimis film, Webb had a more emotional feel to the movie. We were able to understand more of Peter Parkers personal turmoil and have a better connection than that of the other film. When we are introduced to Peter, he was a relatable character. The high school he was in was like a school you yourself would be walking into. His guardians Uncle Ben and Aunt May were significant in taking care peter that it makes you realize that he is just also a teenager who thinks of reckless things to do. Peter is also relatable in his relationship with Gwen Stacy. He is awkward around her which most guys are like, not able to talk to girls. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone had great chemistry in the movie accompanied with great dialogue and acting. Emma Stone did a better job of becoming the heroine in the movie compared to Kirsten Dunsts Mary Jane. The argument with Uncle Ben and Aunt May at the dinner table was the beginning of the biggest tragedy of Peter Parkers life. The death of Uncle Ben gave the biggest emotional punch as Peter listens to his last voice message and this being the second time losing a fatherly figure made even more gut wrenching. Webbs film had a more significant emotional feel to it than that of Raimis film.
 Thanks to new technology and CGI, the actions scenes in this movie are better than ever. The action scenes were a lot smoother with better looking 3D effects. The movie did not look an overly digitized film. The older film had the same idea but was a lot more vivid. Comparing the green goblin and the lizard, the shades of green were different. Green Goblin had a darker shade than that of the lizard. The same goes for the spider man outfit, The Amazing Spider Man had a more cartoonish look than the predecessor trilogy. The CGI was well blended to the point where nothing looked super fake. The Lizard especially was handled reasonably well. The new suit also looked great it made the old spider man suit super outdated and made the new spider man look great and refreshing. New technology did justice to the movie and made it more entertaining as well.
 The Spider Man Action is cooler than the movie series that precedes it, but it looked quick fixed compared to the deep story that comes before it. The action scenes that did build suspense were all tied up and ended abruptly. The movie may look cooler, but tying in the action sequences did were not put together well with emotional story the first half of the movie brought. If looked at the movie as a whole, it did not flow to well in to the second half.
 The film itself was solid overall, although the movie had a great potential to be amazing. It had a great character build up and a pretty good story line, but it did not beat the Raimis spider-man film. But the movie does have a potential to build a bigger and better spider man universe than the Raimis series and if done well on the next movies, the series will be superior to the predecessor. Marc Webb did a great job of having a solid relaunch of the film.",1446681600,,6076,4.548446069469835
4408563,4,B004LWZWFQ,"The Search for Identity in The Amazing Spiderman
The Amazing Spiderman begins with a middle-aged man worried because his son sees a scientific spider on his work desk. This desire to keep science hidden and out of his sons life reveals the theme from the beginning of the story. Throughout this movie, it is shown that science is used by the characters to try and make them something more, but fails, showing that it is important to stay true to yourself.
Peter Parker is young high school boy living with his aunt and uncle. He is in the dark about his parents disappearance and often questions what happened to them. He is known to his peers as the geek with his skateboard, contact lenses, and vintage punk band tee-shirts. Having that distinct archetype, he gets beaten, bruised, and bullied by a huge kid Flash and can never seem to approach or win over his crush Gwen. Parker stoops around with his shoulders down and complete uncertainty about himself. This all begins to change once he gets involved with science. He begins to stand tall with confidence and pride as he becomes the amazing Spiderman.
Peter is smart and highly invested into science, much like his parents were. He comes across his dads old research from a briefcase he finds in the basement and become incredibly curious due to the disappearance of both of his parents. He understands the research to be about cross-species genetics, which sends Peter to the research lab of Dr. Curt Connors, also where Gwen happens to be an intern. Peter stumbles into an accident at the lab while trying to find out more about his father. This accident endows him with super powers and abilities. Through the spider bite he becomes something slightly cooler and more accepted than what he is used to being. He walks down the hall with his face open and cleared of his normal hood. He stands with his shoulders high. With his new, cool persona he is finally able to win over his crush Gwen, but causes a huge scene at her familys dinner over his thoughts of his secret self behind the mask. Using his new identity and set of skills, he embarrasses the school bully and leaves him with the bruises instead, which leaves him looking like the ideal kid. Although this seems like a new and improved situation, he once again lets this identity get him into trouble with the school and his guardians. He again gets into trouble while being lost in using his powers by coming home late one night and is lectured by his Aunt and Uncle. This disagreement forces Peter and Uncle Ben to walk out and ultimately ends in Uncle Bens death by a criminal on the street.
Peter Parker begins to save average humans, stop criminals with his new powers, and continue to try and avenge the death of his Uncle Ben all behind the mask of Spiderman. The incredible technology used in the film allows Parker to move and fight exactly like a spider, making him more powerful than the average human. Even though he is trying to use his special powers for good, he still gets into trouble with the community around him, including his school, Gwens family, his own family, and the police, who think he is causing more damage than helping. He has his family, school, and community worried, he upsets Gwens father so badly that he is kicked out of their dinner, and he ends up causing a lot of drama for the police force when he should be letting them do their job. Even though he does help the community, there are many negatives for Peter as he tries to live up to his new identity, which is clearly something he is not. Although he does face the negatives, his intentions remain good the whole movie and he ultimately proves that he can truly help when he stops Dr. Connors lizard side from contaminating the entire city.
Dr. Connors did not know Peter by his looks, but soon when Peter visits his home and mentions who his father was, he recognizes the name instantly due to his past close association and research work with Peters father. During this meeting they bond over a scientific theory. Dr. Connors uses this theory to add to his other research of cross-species genetics. He ultimately is forced to execute a human experiment on himself because he is being threatened for a cure. He experimentally inserts the possible cure in his body to try and grow back his missing arm. His arm does grow back and he thinks that he has solved a world wide problem, but soon after his arm grows back he begins to experience strange symptoms. He ends up turning into a lizard completely and becomes powerful, but destructive.
Dr. Connor is pleased by his transformation into another creature and continues to take the dosage to stay at his reptile phase. He believes humans are weak and says to Peter, why be human at all when we can be so much more? He longs to be a powerful and leading figure on the outside, even though his true character, which is a genius scientist, is meant to be that way on the inside through intelligence. Dr. Connors desire to be something other than himself ends up destroying him and his career, which he could have used for good.
The chaos between the genetically modified lizard and Spiderman comes from characters attempts to create new personas. Instead of hiding behind a mask or another animal, the movie shows that Peter and Dr. Connor should have stayed their true form and try to help others through other science measures that did not involve transforming themselves. The best person one can be is simply themselves.",1446595200,,5483,4.630390143737166

4408595,4,B004LWZWFQ,"The Amazing Spider-Man is a modern film reboot of the Spider-Man trilogy, based on the Spider-Man comics by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko. The Spider-Man comics first appeared in 1962 and the first movie of the Spider-Man trilogy was released in 2002. The modern reboot of the film addresses the same theme seen in the earlier Spiderman movies but readjusts the plot line to the origin of Peter Parker becoming Spiderman. The characters in the modern reboot of Spiderman, all face issues with identity which effect both the characters stories and the main plot.
The central theme of the Spider-Man story is prevalent throughout the Amazing Spider-Man movie. Both Peter Parker and Dr. Connors mask their identity in order to become someone/something different then they actually are. While Peter Parker uses this mask of his identity for good, Dr. Connors uses his for evil purposes and opposes Peter Parker. In contrast Gwen Stacy, Peters love interest does not mask her identity whatsoever and acts very true to herself. Peter Parker without his secret identity of Spider-Man is quiet, awkward, smart, strong willed, inquisitive, curious, and insecure. Although most of Peters qualities are helpful and strong qualities to have as a person, he ultimately does not want accept his true identity and his insecurities end up effecting him. This is shown in the movie when Peter sneaks into the lab and is bitten by the radioactive spider. From that point in the plot on, Peter Parker will never be the same.  Dr. Connors, Peter Parkers opposition also masks his true identity by transforming himself into a mutant lizard. The character of Dr. Connors has an amputated arm which makes him ultimately feel weak and insecure with himself. These factors lead Dr. Connors to injecting himself with a serum that makes him stronger and fearless in any situation. Similar to Peter, Dr. Connors does not like his true identity and wants to change himself. As Peter does, Connors sneaks into the lab and injects the limb growing serum into himself. The two similar character storylines and feelings of insecurity provide a good back and forth conflict that creates a strong basis for the storyline.
As with most films in the superhero/superhuman genre there is a central conflict that plays to the theme and creates a storyline to follow. The theme of Spider-man, do not be afraid to reveal who you really are, is seen in many aspects throughout the film. In the beginning the audience sees Peter as an insecure, shy, and awkward high school student with an enormous crush on a girl who is the complete opposite of him but mirrors someone that he would eventually become by the end of the film. Peter Parker was an amateur photographer and using his hobby he would hide behind the lens and disguise himself and his feelings toward Gwen Stacy. This concealing of his identity connects back to the theme of identity issues seen throughout the film. Shortly after the introduction of the love interest, Gwen Stacy, the audience is able to see that Gwen is smart, outgoing, popular, not afraid to be herself, and not worried about impressing people. Gwen Stacy acts as not only the person Peter wants romantically, but the person he is able to become when he puts on his Spider-Man suit and opposes evil forces. Gwen is the opposite of Peter and her character acts as a force to get him to understand that it is okay to be who he really is with and without the Spiderman suit on. The Spider-Man alter ego allows Peters character to develop and by the end of the film, Peter is not afraid to reveal who he really is outside of the suit. The suit teaches him not to let his identity issues affect him, as does Gwen Stacy.
Many key points that relate to the theme of the Amazing Spider-Man film are seen throughout the plotline. In the beginning of the film, Peter Parker sneaks into a tour of the science building where his late fathers partner works. This determination to discover his family history backs up the theme of issues with identity. Peter begins to search for who he really is at the beginning of the movie and the first outlet that he looks to is his fathers ex work partner, Dr. Connors. He was able to hide his identity and sneak into the high-tech building by swiping the nametag of a participant in the program. In this instance, Peter wasn't revealing who he was out of fear, instead was disguising himself as someone else. The entire time while at the building, even as he is talking to his late fathers past partner, Peter disguises himself. This masked identity acts as a shelter for Peter in order for a safe and secure feeling. Later in the plotline, after Peter is bitten by the mutated spider and gains superhuman powers, he creates the Spider-Man suit in order to disguise his identity from the people that he will possibly see while saving lives and battling evil opponents. This part of the storyline further allows Peter to not accept who he really is. Instead, Peter is slowly adapting the identity of his alter ego, Spider-Man. At the end of the film, Peter finally realizes that it is okay to be himself and reveal that he is awkward, shy, smart, and insecure, but also can be brave, outgoing, and genuine. Spider-Mans villain, Dr. Connors is not able to accept his identity in the end. The issue of identity eventually acts as the conflict and demise of the villain in the film. Not only does Peter Parker as Spider-Man prevail against the evil Dr. Connors, but he contrasts him by accepting his true identity. Overall, the Amazing Spider-Man movie provides a strong central theme based on issues with identity and backs it up with the characters stories. Identity issues are extremely relatable in modern society which also helps connect viewers to the film and make emotional investments in the characters and storyline.",1446508800,,5833,4.786706349206349

4408843,2,B004LWZWFQ,"I don't have any problem with rebooting Spider-man yet again, as anything would be better than the Tobey Mcguire version of the hero, but this version really wasn't all that much better either. The origin story is still there, but it's muddled and, for some strange reason, the plot seemed to be mired with far too many unresolved or unclearly established elements. Take the sub-plot with the robber who kills Ben: first, the film establishes him oddly as someone slightly likeable - he takes from the stingy store owner, and even shares the chocolate milk with Peter. Initially, you don't think that poorly of the guy. Then there's the strange, ridiculously-coincidental run-in with Ben Parker and a confusing tussle or something and then the guy is gone and Ben is dead. So what happened to the thief anyhow? Did Peter ever find him? That sub-plot was left hanging, but wasn't that bit of revenge and justice one of the key moments of the story of Spider-man, that he catches the thief, realizes he could have used his power to stop him, yadda yadda? It almost felt like the writers had the origin story going, lost interest, and then suddenly it's off to see Doc Connors, played by William Hurt-lite. And how did he hurt his arm? And who broke into Peter's house when he was a boy and where did his parents go? And how exactly did Peter get all of the initial bruises that shocked Aunt May? We saw him running from the baddies earlier but did he ever actually get hit in the face? Why tease the viewer with all of these storylines and then do nothing with it?

The acting was ok but hokey. Andrew Garfield really overdoes it with the bumbling, stuttery teenager and by the end of the film any and all sympathy I had for the character is completely gone, as he limps to stop the lizard while all but pointing at his injured leg over and over again. We get it... his leg is hurt, but thank goodness for the convenient and contrived arrangements on cranes all along the path to the lizard??? Oh give me a break. The CGI was excessive for the lizard character, and if you don't sit around to watch the credits you have no idea what happens to Connor - actually, you do find out, and even then you're left with more unresolved questions.

The only two positives to give this 2 stars would be the music of the late James Horner which worked well for this film. His playful music for the basketball-tease scene was noteworthy, although later in the film when Spidey first swings into action there is a definite ""Wrath of Khan""-sound going on briefly. The other positive would be the way the film excellently captured the dirty, gritty claustrophobic feel of New York city, at least on the surface level. The sewer sequences looked completely Hollywood (and seriously, why would Peter include his name in bold print on his camera attached to the wall? Why not include your phone number and postal address as well?)",1441670400,,2909,4.581573896353167

But since Spider-Man is one of the few heroes I know anything about outside of the movies (and thats limited), I was curious enough to see it.  It really doesnt hold up against the last one.

As a young boy, Peter Park is left with his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field) right before his parents are killed in an accident.  Years later as a teen, Peter (Andrew Garfield) finds his fathers old brief case that contains information on the project he was working on with Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans).

When Peter tries to meet Dr. Connors, he winds up getting bitten by a radio active spider, a bite that gives him strange powers.  It also brings him into closer contact with Dr. Connors assistant, his fellow student Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone).

But when Dr. Connors tries an experiment to use lizard DNA to grow a missing arm back, it turns him into The Lizard, a powerful monster that starts destroying the city.  Can Peter use his new powers as Spider-Man to stop him?

One issue I have with the current glut of super hero movies is the origin story of most of them.  They are so similar as a result even if the details are different.  I cant help but think about that here since weve got another origin story that covers the familiar bases.  On the other hand, tying it back into Peters dad was interesting.

My very limited knowledge of Peter Parker includes nothing about Gwen Stacy, but I tried to approach this movie with an open mind as a result.  And you know what?  I do like her.  In fact, I found their budding romance one of the best things in the film.

Likewise, I thought all the acting was great.  The characters felt real to me, and thats all I truly look for.  It was interesting to see heavy hitters Martin Sheen and Sally Field in this, but they added some depth to their characters that really brought them to life.  And Andrew Garfield had fun delivering the few one-liners he got as Spider-Man.  Note to the writers, give us more of those in the sequel.

On the other hand, the effects needed some work.  Most of the time, I bought them when they involved Peter as Spider-Man.  However, when Dr. Connors turns into The Lizard, it was pretty bad.  Were talking laughably for 10 years ago bad.  I don't know how it got approved, to be honest.

Of course, the danger with a remake is that fans will inevitably compare the two, and I couldn't help but do that as I was watching.  Keep in mind, I loved Sam Raimis Spider-Man, so this one had stiff competition.  But I felt the emotional level of the original was better than this one.  While I liked this movies Peter and Gwen, they didn't feel as real to me as Peter and Mary Jane did ten years ago.  This film felt more by the numbers in character development as well as story.

This film isn't bad, and those looking for another super hero movie will certainly enjoy it.  But The Amazing Spider-Man doesnt have the emotional gravity to live up to its predecessor.",1433721600,,3232,4.337228714524207

What did I think?

My dad summed it up with: the only thing I got out of that movie was sore eyes from the glasses.

The plot has more holes than a spiderweb, Peter isn't as likeable as previous incarnations and it feels as if the director was chosen merely because his surname is Webb.

4409535,5,B004LWZWFQ,"It is not a miracle, but it is an epiphany. They even tried to make the supernatural transformation natural. The superhero is seen and shown as a plain ordinary man, I mean boy who is more or less bullied now and then, a weak one indeed who is trying to get in touch with the only man he knows had been working with his father before his parents disappeared after leaving him in the care of an uncle.

He manages to get where he wants to go and he manages to suffer the fatal accident, the accident that is going to kill the boy in him forever and make him become Spider-Man. That accident, fatal or not, is just plain banal and yet it is the transformation of a human into a spider. That's nice, delicately done, empathetic, attractive. That boy becomes adorable after that transformation in which he recuperates what his father had been researching about.

Unluckily he gives away a formula he should never have given away and that is nearly the end of the world, and this time no epiphany, just a plain apocalypse. And there that's what you are looking for, so don't expect me to tell you what that formula will produce.

On the other side of the natural-supernatural divide there is the love affair of this Peter Parker, that new wave Peter Pan of a Protector Plus in propria persona who comes into the picture Per Procurationem. He is adorable indeed and the poor girlfriend he conquers is no fool. She knows the difference between a real lover and an impotent rapist and you can imagine when her father, a cop mind you, intervene in this sexy love affair that was perfectly safe and back covered to put an end to it.

The end is thus nicely sad since the poor spider will live alone, like all spiders, and his mate will have to go her own way where all kinds of janitors are making sure there are no spiders nor cobwebs in the corners of our minds.

The special effects are funny and disquieting at times but the film has a certain beauty in its brutality.

It has a better director on the project and it eventually was a better and closer to the origin of the comic books. But who cares about all that nerdy stuff. Was it a really good movie? Yes it was.

The special effects even looked better. The newer story of how Peter Parker becomes Spider-man is better told in this new reboot. The cast is much improved and when you get Sally Field to play Aunt May you know they forked out good doe for this bad boy.

Despite the better cast and the mucho money involved to make it the film still lacked a certain magic that would make it a timeless action movie classic. It might be because the first three made ruined that magic. I don't know.

We never got to watch it together until last week, just after I purchased a new UHD Smart TV. I love the movie... I mean he did!!! It was very similar to the Spider-man movie that came out a few years ago in the first series. It also had a lot of differences. The villain in this one seemed more intense and volatile. I'm not sure if it was the fact of viewing this on an UHD TV and the incredible picture or if the movie was just so much more intense but I thought it overall was a better movie than the original Spider-Man.

4410060,5,B004LWZWFQ,"This version is excellent.  The Spiderman presented here is much closer to the comic book version: smart, witty, funny, wise-cracking, as is true to his age.  If anyone has read the comic books or watched the cartoon, they can see that this is much closer to the author's original intention.

I do not understand why people are calling this a ""reboot?""  The first was not true to the comic book rendition of Spiderman.  Each movie is simply a different interpretation of the comics.  This one, in my opinion, being the better.

I believe that people who are hating on this movie are hating it because they did not see this one first.  I believe that if they had seen this rendition before the Raimi rendition, they would have liked this version and then called the Raimi version the dreaded ""reboot"" and complained that Tobey MacGuire gave a sappy non-witty performance, compared to the ""first.""

Andrew Garfield gives a brilliant performance and I always admire his ability to emulate the American accent and make it look simple.  Sally Field, as almost always, gave a solid performance.  I loved her portrayal and the interaction between Peter and Aunt May often made me laugh and were some of the most memorable in the film. I loved the appearance of Gwen Stacy.  Like many, I am sad that she died, both in the comics and in this movie.

No, I am not a comic book fanatic. I have a brother who loves and collects them.  However, I do know enough to know that this rendition is very well done.  I advise everyone to see it who loves Spiderman or has the faintest interest.",1422230400,,1574,4.591397849462366
4410061,4,B004LWZWFQ,"The Amazing Spiderman, needless to say, is a reboot of the original Sam Raimi trilogy. The movie's backstory is particularly noteworthy, as Sam Raimi was originally working on Spiderman 4 before a disagreement with Sony caused him to leave the project and take his creative input with him. I couldn't be sure if it was Tobey Maguire's own idea to leave the series but Spiderman in this reboot is played by Andrew Garfield who was chosen because of his more youthful appearance. The reboot of the Spiderman franchise is strange, as the creative minds didn't leave because they were tired of it. But maybe to have more control over the franchise Sony, in almost every sense of the word, starts the series over again from scratch.

Since this is a reboot, The Amazing Spiderman does get compared to the original series but it is fair to treat it like its own unique film. Although there are debates which Spiderman series is better, The Amazing Spiderman does contribute its own charm to the franchise. Right off the bat, however, The Amazing Spiderman is forced to tell a plot we are all familiar with, but it keeps the story original by changing a lot of details.

The backstory of Spiderman's alter ego, Peter Parker, actually starts when he is still very young. The Amazing Spiderman draws attention to Peter's parents who were involved in a shady operation before they were forced to abandon their son into the hands of Uncle Ben and Aunt May who raised the young hero into a teenager. This is a strange new twist to the Spiderman story, as Peter's parents aren't particularly important to the plot. It's when he gets older that Peter's search for his dad and his dad's research draw him into Oscorp Industries where he has the famous radioactive spider bite that gives him super powers.

The first comparison between the two Spiderman movies is that Peter Parker is motivated by his lost parents in this version, rather than the death of Uncle Ben like in the original. In fact, Uncle Ben's role in The Amazing Spiderman is far less substantial and the impact of his on-screen death is far less than the original movie. Although it would have been a copycat of the original movies, I wouldn't have minded it so much if Uncle Ben in this version at least spoke the most famous line in comic book history, ""With great power comes great responsibility,""... but he doesn't.

But although Peter Parker's hunt to find his lost parents provides enough setup to give Peter his powers and introduce him to the villain, this plot line disappears from the story and all we have is the promise more will be revealed in future movies. But that's not to say the movie becomes less interesting. After getting into the plot we're introduced to Dr. Connors who is researching the regenerative properties of lizards and reptiles. With some help from Peter, and some pressure from Oscorp executives, Dr. Connors begins doing experiments on himself until he grows into a giant super-strong lizard man with a destructive animalistic nature. The ultimate goal, of course, is for Spiderman and The Lizard to fight until one of them proves to be the superior animal.

There are many creative differences between Sam Raimi's movies and Marc Webb's remake (I swear, his name is a joke). The Amazing Spiderman is a very realistic and sometimes gritty looking movie that tells a version of Spiderman that seems more plausible than the original. Looking at the special effects close up, you almost can't tell them from the real thing. By my books, realism doesn't always mean better, but one of the realistic details that's more faithful to the comic are the web shooters; which are machines in the comic and not naturally produced spiderweb like in the original movies.

Andrew Garfield as Spiderman sort of gets a mixed reaction from me because Marc Webb portrays Peter Parker as more of a cocky adolescent who is too confident for his own good. Despite the fan disagreements, Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield are really two sides of the same coin. Each one portrays two different sides to Spiderman's personality that are both straight from the comic books. My only complaint is that we don't feel for Andrew Garfield in his moments of weakness quite as much as Tobey Maguire. It's really his moments shooting webs and doing battle that Andrew Garfield really exceeds.

One plot detail that I cannot dispute is maybe choosing Gwen Stacy instead of Mary Jane Watson as Spiderman's romantic interest. It's not her acting or her beauty that makes her good, but the character's actual involvement in the plot. Not only is her father the police chief but Gwen also figures out Spiderman's identity quite early and proves useful in helping him, instead of just being another damsel in distress. However, The Amazing Spiderman falls really flat in the romance department. Although Gwen is a great character from the comics and in the movie, the actual conflict between Spiderman and The Lizard doesn't bring them closer together, so the romance between them is just a distracting side-plot that hardly feeds into the movie's conclusion.

The emotional dialogue is also nails scratching on a chalk board. Almost half the dialogue is nonstop mumbling and babbling. During many of the emotionally tense and romantic scenes there is more than one character trying to talk at the same time. Hardly anybody in this movie is saying what they're trying to say. At least Sam Raimi had sense enough to let the tone of his scenes create the emotion, even if the writing could be cheesy. But The Amazing Spiderman is sometimes just words drowning out the connection we're supposed to be feeling for the characters, so that's my biggest complaint.

I also find The Amazing Spiderman inferior to the original because it tells a less complete story. Spiderman doesn't graduate from high school in this movie. He remains a student and doesn't catch Uncle Ben's killer or get a job at the Daily Bugle and doesn't even mention Norman or Harry Osborn; who are both very important to Peter Parker's backstory, even if the movie doesn't want tackle their transformation into the villain, Green Goblin.

But how do I feel about the story that The Amazing Spiderman `does' have? Honestly, I like the original series better, but The Amazing Spiderman is not half bad. It tells a story very different from the comics and the original movie trilogy, but it introduces Spiderman's powers in a very believable way and gives us a compelling conflict between the hero and the villain. I do find Marc Webb a strange choice for a director, since he has no reputation outside of music videos, but I think he did alright with Spiderman. So at the end of the day it can really come down to personal preference but I really don't blame anyone who genuinely likes The Amazing Spiderman.",1422230400,,6820,4.8163962425277544

I bought the film on blu-ray the first chance I got. This film is great much more realistic, Follows the comic book better, better effects, and a good plot. Andrew Garfield is a great spider-man. As for the people saying he's to cool to play Peter Parker I definitely see that point, but It's not enough to bother me.

4410482,4,B004LWZWFQ,"The Amazing Spider-Man introduces a very compelling chemistry between Andrew Garfield's adorkable Peter Parker and Emma Stone's blonde-ambitious Gwen Stacey. Their relationship anchors an otherwise just-tolerable film that obviously is meant to please visually rather than produce a credible story. None of that matters, because the visuals are very arresting, and the soundtrack plays in perfect emotional time to the rapid-fire scenes. Overly coincidental plot devices are a plenty (like a dozen perfectly positioned construction cranes that just happen to have operators living within about a 100-foot radius), but the humor and flirtations between the leads make this a quality comic-schlock event.",1418688000,2,702,5.892156862745098

I thought Spiderman was one of those franchises that couldn't be screwed up. Wrong. The only high points are Sally Fields as Aunt Mae and Martin Sheen as a different but likable Uncle Ben. Beyond that, it's a wasteland of mediocre acting, a plodding storyline that somehow manages to make Spiderman's adventures boring, effects that we've seen before a thousand times, and awkward, mumbling leads.",1416441600,,426,5.085714285714285

4411503,5,B004LWZWFQ,"THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN

Spider-Man has and always will be my favorite comic series of all time and Sam Raimi is one of my all time film makers. So naturally I loved the Raimi trilogy and was a little disappointed when I heard the franchise was being rebooted. Still I went into this flick hoping for the best because I love the character so much. Plus I really liked the trailer for this and it was cool to see the Lizard as the villain.

We all know the story, a young Peter Parker is the nerd that gets picked on, losses Uncle and oh yeah he is bitten by a radioactive spider. After losing his uncle he takes up the with great power comes great responsibility and becomes Spider-Man. In doing so he has to alienate himself even more from regular people, particularly those he actually cares about as to not put them in harms way. Secrets start to bubble to the surface about his father and a scientist named Dr. Connors. But all is not as it seems and Connors may have a dark green secret of his own.

I have to say that while I knew I would like it I ended up liking it more so than I thought I would. Andrew Garfield was good as Peter but I still think Toby made the better Parker to me. Emma Stone was excellent as Gwen as I knew she would be and Denis Leary was great as her father. Rhys Ifans is great as Connors/Lizard and it was great to see him in this. The script was well written and the direction was good. Over all it was a fun movie but I still think Raimis were the better ones.

With the combo pack you get a good commentary track and all kinds of behind the scenes stuff. Also you get deleted scenes and rehearsals so there is plenty to watch with this set. I love Spider-Man and everything that involves him but I am sure I will never get the movie I want, The Clone Saga. I still miss you Scarlet Spider.",1411603200,,1824,4.1440677966101696

4411682,4,B004LWZWFQ,"The Amazing Spider-Man was every bit amazing.  Although I think it came too soon after Spider-Man 3 and the hunger to see it just wasn't there.  Andrew Garfield (Spider-Man/Peter Parker) and Emma Stone (Gwen Stacy) worked very well together.  The screenplay for this 2012 adaptation of Spider-Man to the big screen was done by 3 writers, James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves, while the story was written by James Vanderbilt.  The story follows Peter Parker from when he was a little kid playing with his parents to when he was Spider-Man fighting criminals.

Peter Parker (Garfield) was abandoned by his parents when he was just a little boy, they left him to be raised by his Uncle Ben (Sheen) and Aunt May (Field).  Peter is lost and is trying to find his way and how he turned out the way he is today.  In the meanwhile  he is also trying to find his way with his first school crush, Gwen Stacy (Stone), and together they flirt with secrets while they struggle with their commitment and love.  After an encounter at school Peter goes home to help Uncle Ben with a flood in the basement where he discovers a briefcase that belonged to his father.  Finding a mysterious compartment in the briefcase makes Peter begin to question his parent's disappearance and makes him want to know what really happened to them.  This takes him to Oscorp and the lab of Dr. Curt Connors (Ifans), who was his father's former partner.  This sets up Spider-Man on a collision course with Connor's alter-ego, The Lizard,  Peter will have to make life-altering choices on how to use his powers which will shape his future to become a hero.

The background music in this film was sound on.  Every scene that was intense was met with music that was intense all while not being overpowered by the music.  I never felt like the music was misplaced because every scenes background music was exceptionally placed.

Another aspect of behind the scenes of the movie that was amazingly done was the editing.  This movie flows flawlessly from scene to scene and it makes sense.  Your never asking yourself what the heck why?

Overall I would give this movie a B.  I would suggest this movie over the Spider-Man movies that had Tobey Maguire portraying Peter Parker.  The Amazing Spider-Man is incomparable to Spider-Man because it is on a whole other level.  Can't wait for the sequel to come out on DVD so that I can give you my review of it!

Andrew Garfield played a perfect Spider man, Sally Field didn't think she would pull off Aunt May because I wasn't sure on what to expect, but like always with every other role she has played proves the reason why is one of my favorite actresses. I don't know why it took me so long to watch this movie and its sequel. Maybe its because I was worried it was going to be like the movie it was replacing. No offense to Toby but I think the only three good things that came from those movies were Kirsten Dunst, Willem Dafoe, and James Franco.

4411967,1,B004LWZWFQ,"Granted, I'm pretty picky but this one was just terrible. I was shocked that Rotten Tomatoes had such good numbers. This movie was simplistic and a huge let down. I already didn't like having a reboot so soon and then when the movie is this bad it just makes it so much worse. The script writing was targeted for an audience of children; throughout the movie they somehow felt the need to explicitly explain the situation to the audience just in case we didn't get it. This made for a very boring and uninspiring time. All of this starts to make sense when considering the screenwriter's lack of experience. The one thing that critiques and move-goers do agree on is the visual presentation; it was well done. But these days CGI and editing magic is becoming a commodity and there's a shift back toward quality content in conjunction with great graphics. This movie has no content and has great graphics. ""Visually Stunning"" is what everyone says but that's all it was.

This was a blockbuster sure but this will be one that will fade away over time as an expensive money-maker but nothing original or unique.",1410393600,2,1109,4.658163265306122

Andrew Garfield is fantastic as Peter Parker / Spider-Man and the supporting cast is excellent as well.  The problems come with the overlong story and the special effects.  The final 45-minute lizard battle seemed tacked-on as the required, but uninteresting bang-up finale.  The special effects for Spider-Man were fine (especially the cool webbing), but the lizard looked positively fake -- the more so when he talked.  That was disappointing in such a high-budget tent-pole movie.  So... 5-stars for Andrew Garfield, but just 3 for the film.",1409702400,,719,5.146551724137931

4412371,5,B004LWZWFQ,"Though I enjoyed Raimi's original ""Spiderman"", upon finishing it, I was rather underwhelmed.  I think the reason for this is that it followed so closely to the original comic (I mean issue #1) that it was almost pointless to watch this movie if you had read the comic.

This one is much more of what I would consider a true update, something the franchise badly needs.  These days, nerds are ""cool"", and the '50s-'60s Peter Parker just doesn't play true by today's standards.  This movie brings him into the 21st century while still retaining what makes him what he is.  It also follows the Lizard's origin tale (which I also used to own) closely enough to make me nostalgic, yet different enough to be fresh.  He's also my favorite Spidey villain.  I'm glad, too, that Gwen Stacy was Peter's love interest rather than Raimi's awkward atttempt to amalgamate her with Mary Jane, a completely different personality.

Only one minor complaint:  I wish they had used some giant actor in a suit rather than yet another CGI creation, as it looked way too fluid to be truly reptilian.  Through animatronics and modern make-up methods (with CGI thrown in for some action sequences), I think a more impressive creature could have been realized.  But, this is just a quibble.

I did like the Raimi films, but I think this one hits the mark a little better.",1408752000,2,1346,4.705128205128205

There's a reason I stick to the cartoon and comics. They simply can't make a good Spidey series all the way through. The Tobey series lost all my interest because it got way too crazy but even those first two movies haven't aged well. The movie looks nice here but that's about where the good ends. The acting I found to be passable but it had it's fair share of over the top moments. The action, there's not much to say, it's very forgettable.

Spidey seems to do some more wise cracking but that's one of the few things they got right. They don't even have the photography aspect with the daily bugle which is a huge part of the character. I didn't care about Gwen Stacey, never have never will. I guess basically this movie is just pointless. They do the origin story again but it's not as good.

There are many differences that I won't get into, as I don't want to give away any spoilers for fans who have not read the books or seen the movies. I prefer the original story to remain the original story. However, this was a solid entry into the Spiderman saga. Andrew Garfield was a good Spiderman. I won't play the whose better game, because I think that is unfair to both actors. I do believe that a movie with perhaps an alternate universe where Spiderman meets Spiderman with both Andrew Garfield and Toby McGuire playing the parts would be a very cool movie. But, that is not for me to decide, and I am certain others have thought of it already. If you like Spiderman, you won't be disappointed with this entry.

4412670,1,B004LWZWFQ,"Five years after the third, final, and misjudged installment of director Sam Raimi's series of films about the superhero with abilities that make him akin to a spider, here is The Amazing Spider-Man, with a story the redoes the hero's origin-terrain already covered quite well in Rami's Spider-Man. The temptation to engage in a kneejerk dismissal of a cinematic reboot-especially one that arrives only a decade after the film it retreads-is a strong one. There is precedent, though, if one looks to the source material. In the world of the comic books, Spider0Man has been ""spectecular,"" ""sensational,"" ""astonishing,"" and ""avenging,"" to list the modifiers of a few of the various series in which the superhero has starred.

Fortunately, the clumsy handling of practically every element of this reinterpretation of the character and the focus of the world which he inhabits renders null and void the initial skepticism of the movie based solely on its existence in relation to the previous films. Instead, The Amazing Spider-Man stands on its own as a lackadasical and wholly unimpressive foray into revealing a far less appealing hero and relying on the tried and tired comic-book movie formula.

Peter Parker is something of a blank slate in the variation-a loner with no friends and with an interest in science, technology, and photography but who is not completely incompetent in relation to fitting in with others. He is less of a social outcast than he is socially overlooked. He is still incredibly awkward when it comes to the girl of his dreams; in this reincarnation, she is Gwen Stacy, which is in line with the original mythos of the comic book.

Peter does not shy away from confrontation and, in fact, provokes one with the school's resident bully Flash when he refuses to take a picture of the jock holding another student upside-down. Peter has the nerve to stand up for what is right; he simply does not have the physical ability to enforce it. The movie even gives him something approaching a rebellious streak with a skateboard, which he rides through the halls of his high school, much to the disapproval of the school's administrators.

This is not, in other words, the Peter Parker to whom the majority of the mainstream of the mainstream audience has become accustomed. The driving idea of Peter Parker as a nerd-turned-hero is that he garners immediate sympathy, a quality sorely absent from screenwriters James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent, and Steve Kloves' Peter, whose inconsistent characterization leans more toward a smug, off-putting personality. This becomes even more problematic when Peter dons his mask and red-and-blue suit.

Before that, though, the screenplay introduces a mysterious back story for Peter. His parents died in a plane crash after leaving their son with his aunt May and his uncle Ben when he was a boy. While exploring the basement, Peter discovers his father's old briefcase, which contains very little of importance, save for part of a mathematical formula and a newspaper clipping of his father with an old colleague named Dr. Curt Connors. Peter sneaks his way into Connors' laboratory at a major corporation and learns that the scientist has been working on a way to combine animal DNA with a human host in the hopes of discovering cures to degenerative diseases and to regenerate his missing right arm through the use of reptile genetic material.

The res of Peter's transformation into Spider-Man plays out with only the specifics changed. A genetically altered spider bites him while he is exploring Connors laboratory. He begins to realize that a change has come over him, most notably in a scene on the subway when he overreacts out of instinct to a man placing a bottle on his forehead as Peter is passed out on the seat. The resulting fight is a piece of uncomfortably brutal slapstick, with Peter knocking out almost an entire train car full of people, including bashing some of them in the head with a metal pole he rips from its attachments to the floor and ceiling.

There is a montage of Peter testing out his new agility and climbing abilities in an abandoned warehouse. It is the only scene during his conversion that possesses a modicum of joy in discovery, even though director Mar Webb, who seems bored by the material, undermines that by placing a low-key pop song in the soundtrack, meant to tie into Peter finally gaining enough courage to awkwardly ask Gewn on a date. Their budding romance is the movie's highlight, particularly because Peter only briefly hesitates to inform her of his secret identity. Gwen knows the stakes and is equal parts impressed with the fearful of Peter's extracurricular excursions.

Most importantly, Peter allows a robber at a convenience store to escape after the cashier insults him; the thief kills Uncle Ben while fleeing. Peter spends his night trying to hunt down the killer and, in the process, stops multiple crimes, turning him into a public hero and a nuisance for the police, especially Gwen's father Captain Stacy, with whom Peter shares an on-the-nose conversation about the difference between vigilantism and justice over dinner.

If Peter is only barely sympathetic before the spider bite, he is downright obnoxious after donning the mask and suit-a punk with a bad attitude who taunts criminals and spouts cringe-worthy one-liners while swinging, leaping, and fighting. The latter is anticipated, though Garfield's brash delivery lends a strange air of hostility to Spider-Man's deeds. An episode on a bridge, in which Spider-Man must rescue a child from inside a car dangling from the structure, allows the protagonist a transition from his less-appealing self to a bona fide do-gooder, through shortly after, the screenplay dismisses Peter's evolution almost immediately after it is suggested.

Just as that character development and the background of Peter's parents abruptly disappear from the narrative's equation, the screenplay disregards the through line of Peter tracking down Uncle Ben's killer for a more cliched route-a bigger battle with bigger stakes. Connors' experimentation-hastened by a vague threat from the assistant of the company's dying CEO-does give him a new arm; it also mutates him into a human-lizard hybrid with a diabolical plan to release his chemical in the form of gas in order to change everyone in New York City into human-lizard hybrids.

""The Lizard"" as the creature is dubbed, is as unconvincing in appearance as his plan is in theory and in practice. He is a computer-generated creation of laughable design and poor execution. Spider-Mn fights the lizard in the sewer, through the local high-school, and atop a massive skyscraper, and no amount of random slow motion, first-person perspective shots, or gaudy neon-drenched cinematography from John Schwartzman can distract from or hid how generic these confrontations and the narrative rationale behind them are.

There need not be good reasons to restart a franchise from the beginning, but there must be some creative impulse driving the implementation of that decision. The Amazing Spider-Man is the antithesis of that second thought-a lazy and completely ordinary superhero story that gets just about every facet of its central character and story wrong while failing to follow through on the few parts that show some promise in any satisfactory way.",1407110400,,7367,5.114713216957606

4412960,4,B004LWZWFQ,"The Amazing Spider-Man is a film that is more loyal to the comics. The Amazing Spider-Man also has a fantastic cast in my opinion. Andrew Garfield is a 30 year old actor playing a teenager and does spectacular job portraying Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Emma Stone plays Peter's first love interest in the comics Gwen Stacy. Emma is fantastic as Gwen and is not a damsel in distress. Gwen is pretty, and a smart person. Andrew and Emma's chemistry can not be denied in this film. Spider-Man has never looked better on the big screen. Spider-Man is humorous, smart, and enjoyable to watch. This film is a reboot, and Origin story. I really enjoy we get to see Peter's scientific side in this movie. We see him use science and talk science, it is really amazing. This film was advertised falsely. As we were told we would get the Untold story, but we never got an untold story so therefore the story remains untold. There are negatives in the movie. The Villain Dr. Kurt Connors/The Lizard who is portrayed by Rhys Ifans which I loved his performance, but The Lizard was not a great villain. We don't really get to understand the character in depths. He really has no motive which I will not spoil and is really not a villain in my opinion. Overall I enjoyed and love this movie. We have a great cast, a film loyal to its origin in the comics, score also known as the music in the films is great, CGI/Special effects are fantastic and not noticeable, and We also have the Web shooters for Spider-Man instead of organic shooters.

4413052,4,B004LWZWFQ,"This review may seem a little paradoxical, but basically, here's the gist for me: the first half was messy, the second half was rushed, and it did not significantly add or achieve anything over and above Sam Raimi's original movie to necessarily warrant a full reboot like this. That being said, the whole thing kind of came together in a way that was fun, and decent overall. As a whole, I liked the movie in and of itself, but it left a whole lot to be desired.

First, the overall plot and pacing. The first half, as I've already set, is just a mess. It is a mish-mash of scenes trying to establish the angst and character of Peter Parker while trying to lay some backstory suggesting a conspiracy involving Peter's parents. The problem with the conspiracy backstory is that it was never really fleshed out, and just seemed to be something tossed in to try to add some intrigue to the movie. Considering Dr. Connors' background with Richard Parker, I am surprised there wasn't a whole lot more of Peter trying to learn about his dad from him. I would have expected more bonding between them, or something, so it just didn't feel real to me.

Many of the scenes in that first half of the film are just alternative takes on similar scenes in Sam Raimi's original Spider-Man film. We've got to have the shots of Flash picking on Peter, we've got to have the big argument with Uncle Ben to set up the big guilt trip later, we've got to have the Oscorp lab with the creepy experiments, the cute girl that is interested in Peter even though he's a dork, etc., etc. The scenes that were truly original to this version mostly dealt with a little prologue showing the Parkers, which seemed like it was setting up a payoff later in the film, which, sadly, never materialized.

Then, after limping along for an hour, it was if the filmmakers decided to change gears, and we get about ten minutes of transition time where EVERYTHING seemingly happens all at once: the spiderbite, the costume, the webbing, the murder of you-know-who, the guilt trip, etc. - In particular, the webbing and the costume kind of came out of nowhere. One minute, nothing, the next second, he's full blown Spider-Man, and it felt very rushed.

Then, the second half was a rehash of the trite old plotline - ""Hey, I'll experiment on myself. Hey, I'm a monster now!"" Because the movie limped along for that first hour, the second hour has a lot of ground to cover, in order to establish the Lizard as a baddie, and consequently it felt very rushed. Three separate battles with the Lizard, with only mere minutes of screen time between each one, setting up the next battle, kind of became tedious for me.

The acting was good. All of the cast members did their jobs very well. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, as Peter and Gwen, really clicked on screen. Martin Sheen did a good job as Uncle Ben, but I really wish that relationship would have been developed a little more. As it was, I never really felt any fondness or closeness between Peter and Uncle Ben, as they were always bickering with each other. Raimi did a much better job with that relationship in the first Spider-Man movie.

The action sequences were really cool. Although, by now, all these big budget action sequences are becoming the same. If you don't mind watching two CGI characters have CGI battles, it's fun. The web swinging sequences were effectively rendered too.

So, overall, I would say, fun movie, though it didn't contribute meaningfully enough to the lore to warrant the reboot. We saw all of this just a few years ago when Raimi released the first ""Spider-Man."" And since the trend now seems to be to make three movies and reboot, I'm sure we'll be getting a new origin story in just a few years. After all, look no further than the fact that they're already rebooting Batman again. That's the SECOND reboot in just the past handful of years. It's starting to become a bit tedious, you know.",1405641600,,3938,4.577304964539007

The leads in both films are well-cast and have nice chemistry.  The visual effects are a decade more advanced in the later film.

The difference is really in the direction.  Sam Raimi just has a better feel for the slightly unhinged tone of the material.  Amazing Spider-Man feels like a generic superhero blockbuster in comparison.  It is fine, but nothing special.",1404691200,,647,5.037735849056604

My favorite thing about this movie is Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy. She is MILES better than Bryce Dallas Howard. Howard wasn't the problem though, it was the story and script. Stone's Gwen Stacy is much more interesting and competent. Honestly, there is nothing much else I like about this movie. I certainly missed Danny Elfman who composed the first two Sam Raimi Spider-Man movies. I feel this is a love or hate movie. I, unfortunately, hate it.",1404172800,2,767,4.647058823529412

4413413,5,B004LWZWFQ,"The past dozen years has witnessed reboots of multiple movie franchises.  Most keep the primary characters intact but just change the details of the story a little.  Not this one; Marc Webb gives us an entirely new plot line, with major turnover in the characters.  Gone is Mary Jane, now we have Gwen Stacy as the primary love interest.  Our villain now is The Lizard, aka Curt Connors, though his initial intentions were noble and scientific.  And we finally get a glimpse of Peter Parker's biological parents, something the initial trilogy never provided.

The cast was awesome, with each of the characters well played.  The dialogue was quite good for an action movie; especially that between Peter and Dr. Connors.  And the presence of Martin Sheen and Denis Leary in key supporting roles really lent weight to the acting.  The soundtrack was quite good, with the orchestral themes a vast improvement over the hip-hop and rock & roll music used in the first trilogy.  Overall, quite good and my vote for best superhero movie of 2012.",1404086400,,1038,4.846590909090909
4413414,5,B004LWZWFQ,"May be spoilers below.

I saw the original Spider-Man in the Theater.  I really liked it.  I have the set of all three movies.  They are fun movies you can watch again and again.

I had told people that this was just a remake and would never be as good as the original movie (insert foot in mouth.)  As shocked as I am, I actually liked this new version a lot more than the original.  I will explain why below.

First, this movie is set at a much faster pace than the original.  You do not see him going to the fighting place and trying out his moves.  He just gets his powers and starts stopping the bad guys.  He does see what he can do.  But it is not as drug on in this new version.

What he can do is available differently.  In the original, it was all from the spider.  In the new movie, why he does get his power from said spider, he seems to invent some of the stuff as well.  It makes it almost seem more like destiny than fate.  He just seems to fit in with his new power and have the ability and knowledge to make it better.

The characters are different as well.  The Spider-Man character, I like this version better than the original.  He has that intelligent, quiet guy thing down.  He just seemed more like the guy that would turn into Spider-Man than the original guy did.  He does not have a job working for the paper.  He takes pictures for his school.  In this movie, instead of having his boss as a supporting character, the supporting character is the father of his girlfriend, who just so happens to be a police officer.  I believe he is the guy in charge.  Important things happen with this new character.  Something that he tells the boy towards the end and what the boy says at the very end, while arriving to class late, gave me such a cool, warm feeling.  It was incredible.

His aunt and uncle seem different.  His uncle seems angrier than the original did.  But, you get the feeling that he really loved him.

The girlfriend.  Well, in the original, she seemed somewhat lonely.  Her father was abusive, be in mentally or physically, I believe mentally.  But as I said, her father is a cop.  She seems like she has friends, but that she is smarter and more sophisticated than them.  She seems to be a good person who goes for what she wants.  The girl who played her, wow, she is one of the most beautiful humans I have ever seen.  She is incredible.

The villain.  Now, I cannot really remember the villain from the original.  But, in this version, he is a man who has an injury.  He is looking for a way to help other with injuries or sickness.  Things happen.  He does not want to give the stuff to a man, because he does not think it is ready.  He tries it on himself.  It takes him over.  You really get the feeling that you understand the man.  He is trying to do good, but thanks to fate, things get out of hand and he looses control.

I am not sure when Peters friend came into the original movies.  But, he really does not have a male friend in this movie.  The girl seems to be his real friend.

As I said, I like the originals.  But I just feel this version is better.  It has a faster pace.  It seems to see the story in a different way.  While some of the same things happen, the way they happen is just better.  You really feel like the characters fit their roles.  This is a lot more action than the original.  It has been at least ten years since I have been so excited to see the next movie in a franchise.  I just pre ordered the special edition from Amazon for $99.99.  I cannot wait to see it.  I suggest you see both versions of the movie, but, what the originals first.  Once you see this new version, the old ones will probably move much to slow for you.

I almost forgot, there seems to be a mystery about his parents going on.  I am interested to see where that goes.",1404000000,,3820,4.157967032967033

4413620,3,B004LWZWFQ,"It's pretty ridiculous these days when a movie series gets rebooted 5 years after the previous installment. How else can one sum up this premise, other than it's driven by greed? This is the Dark Knight mentality all over again; this time, it's Spider-Man. While this movie is for the most part good, I found myself somewhat bored, and asking myself, ""Is this a pointless movie, or what?"" This movie is basically the same as Spider-Man 2002 in terms of plot, characters, etc., only much worse. Tobey Mcguire did a spectacular job portraying Peter Parker in the 2002 movie, so why diminish and tarnish his efforts? And why does this reboot have a villain that isn't believable t all? A lizard? A CGI lizard? Andrew Garfield does a good job as Parker, but that's not enough to win me over to the reboot camp. I'm disturbed with what's going on in the movie industry these days; it's driven by greed, and fed off of an audience that demands something better than what came before (in this case, the 2002 movie was better). These reboots are dumbed-down to suit a generation of moviegoers who care less about plot and substance, and favor tons of action and eye candy. While watching this movie, it became apparent that there was a deliberate attempt to make this movie in the same style as The Dark Knight: darker, and at times a little raw, all while retaining its artificial feel via CGI. I'm sorry, but this movie is pointless, and is an insult to the previous movies with Mcguire, Dunst, etc.",1401580800,,1493,4.616541353383458

Well like when they rebooted batman with the dark knight trilogy I was very skeptical. But like when I first saw batman begins, I wait to see how the movie is and what direction they take with the amazing spiderman. Well they keep a lot of the classic spiderman things they had in the original spiderman movies but had new things you have never seen in a spiderman movies. Like new villains like the classic Lizard which spiderman has some amazing fight scenes with. But the whole plot is building to a bigger plot not explore in the first set of movies. A more complex story line and greater villains. Having both greater emotion and a darker vibe but also having a updated vive but still having the classic spiderman vibe the first set of movies didn't have. The more I watch this movie the more I have grown to love it more than the first trilogy. Andrew is a awesome spiderman and more believable at times. I think its going to be a better set of movies than the first one day with now seeing the amazing spiderman 2 which I think was the best spiderman movie ever.

For me the first three Spiderman movies were a parody of a superhero movie. I never believed in the characters or engaged in the storyline.

Then this one came out. What a difference! They actually introduce the characters and give them backgrounds so you can relate and be emotionally connected to them. The storyline was decent enough and I love the mix of drama and comedy, but still not being too silly as the previous ones were.

The reason why I didn't rate it 5 stars was because the actor that plays Peter Parker.... There are times that I don't believe he is Peter Parker. I know it's picky, but there should never be a time in a movie where you think you're watching a movie. I like to be fully engaged and believe what I'm seeing. Maybe that's just me. Either way, there were a few moments where I didn't picture him being the smart, nerdy character, but he really redeems himself once you watch the emotional scenes. As soon as it comes in, I just get sucked in and come near to tears just to watch them be upset.

I contacted them to see if anything could be done. I know it was my mistake, but surely this kind of thing has happened before. Their response?

The special effects are outstanding and the action is driving, but not at the expense of extraordinary depth and emotion.  It is an example of excellent movie making. Some critics panned the performance of Andrew Garfield, saying his performance doesn't stand up to that of Sally Field's, but that isn't true. He plays the poignant moments with skill and the ability to nuance his vocal and facial expression to fit the required tone and emotion with exceeding success.  A fun movie with no bad language that even emphasizes moral responsibility- but without being condescending. With outstanding performances by Emma Stone, Sally Fields, and Martin Sheet, this is a movie with performances by an ensemble cast that works to produce a fantastic movie.  It would be great for middle school kids too, keeping in mind their individual sensitivity to a lot of intensive fighting and action.  These moments are not gratuitous or excessive in any way, but are intense.  It is refreshing to see that Hollywood is still capable of making action movies that are suitable for kids and also moving and sophisticated enough to truly draw in and entertain adults.

In the original Spider-Man, it was the Green Goblin and in the first reboot of it, it was this one scientist who could turn himself into a giant lizard.  They should of kept MJ in it and not deleted all of her scenes, since I may end up liking it more if they had. I always assumed MJ was supposed to be Spider-Man's/Peter Parker's girlfriend, especially when I watched the original movie franchise of Spider-Man and saw them always together.

I also thought that the Gwen Stacy premise was really confusing, given that everyone knows the love interest of Spider-Man is Mary Jane (Watson, of course).

Andrew Garfield really shines in his Spider-Man performance, and he's a good Peter as well.

4414481,4,B004LWZWFQ,"It's a good movie, and I loved (finally!) seeing The Lizard onscreen. I've been waiting for him to show up for, well, years, especially since Connors has been bouncing around in the background of the other Spider-Man films. However, it should have been Spider-Man 4, not a re-boot. In starting over, they failed to recapture the essence of what is Spider-Man, instead giving us some new version that gets (most of) the facts straight but doesn't give us the heart and soul that Raimi did. In short, they gave us a good movie but a poor adaptation.

I walked out of the theater from a good movie completely unsatisfied.

I hear people saying that this new one is better than the other one, but I don't think I believe that even just measuring them movie for movie. Sure, the special effects are slicker in this one. The movie is flashier. The Lizard looks great. But, beyond that, the movie is just formula. I think people are tricked into believing this one is better because it's darker and prettier, so to speak. But the characters, with the exception, maybe, of Gwen are less developed, so it's a story that's hard to get involved with.

I didn't care when Ben died because we don't really see Peter care. We know, intellectually, that he cares, but we never feel it. And the way that he died felt pretty contrived. The whole movie is like that. We know how we're supposed to feel about various things, because we know the Spider-Man mythos. The producers or the director or writer or some combination of them know we know these things, and they rely on our pre-knowledge to give us access to the feelings that the movie ought to be evoking so that they can actually gloss over all of that stuff. In truth, I feel sort of gypped.

Perhaps the movie's biggest failure, however, is the reduction of Peter's motivation to being Spider-Man to one of revenge (or ""getting even"" as Uncle Ben says) and guilt. This is the same thing that Nolan did with Batman in Batman Begins. It's as if there can be no other motivation for a super hero. This is where the heart of Spider-Man is lost in this new movie. Spider-Man is not about revenge. It's all about ""with great power comes great responsibility,"" and it's the absence of this one line from the movie that may be it's most egregious error.

The reason for the success of the comic book was that it asked the question of what a normal kid would do if he got super powers and answered it in a realistic way. Peter's first motivation was to use his new power for fame and fortune. The introduction of tragedy into his life becomes not a motivation for revenge but a reason to look at himself, see where he failed, and become a better person. Spider-Man becomes a character that is motivated to do good because it is the right thing to do not because he's seeking revenge against criminals or wallowing in guilt. Sure, those things come up, but they are not the motivating factor. [Later, Marvel would decide to give us a character motivated by revenge, so they gave us the Punisher.]

The new Webb movie (I know, ha ha, right?) reduces all of the complicated emotional trauma of being a teenager into one driving emotion, getting revenge against the people that have done Peter Parker wrong. Starting with Flash and moving through his vendetta against long-haired, blond criminals. He morphs that with guilt over the fact that Peter feels like he created The Lizard, and that whole thing about the heroes creating their villains is also something I'm rather tired of seeing used; it gave me flashbacks to Burton's Batman, ""You made me!"" So, yeah, I came away unimpressed.

Which is not to say, again, that it's not a good movie. It's totally enjoyable and exciting. The Lizard looks awesome and the CG work is excellent. They use a number of iconic Spider-Man poses in the movie, which was nice to see. Denis Leary and Emma Stone are both great. Sally Field was out of place, although Martin Sheen was pretty good. There was nothing to distinguish Andrew Garfield other than his build, though. He did an adequate job, but he didn't really pull off the nerdy, awkward teenager thing. If you like exciting super hero movies, it's certainly worth seeing in the theater.

But it's not my Spider-Man movie. Sam Raimi made that one 10 years ago, and Sony would have done better to just carry on with the new cast and director building off of what Raimi started rather than trying to start over.",1399161600,3,4433,4.588383838383838

4414484,1,B004LWZWFQ,"Amazing Spiderman is the unneeded reboot of the Spiderman movie franchise.  The very fact that this movie was even made annoys me.  Firstly, I think it was way too soon to reboot the franchise.  Amazing Spiderman came out in 2012, which is only five years after Spiderman 3 came out.  Originally Sam Raimi was working on Spiderman 4, but due to the bad reception of Spiderman 3 Sony decided to abandon that project in favor of this movie.  Honestly, I would rather have gotten Spiderman 4 than a reboot.  The fact that Sony decided to reboot everything because of one misstep annoys me.  The X-Men franchise has had multiple stinkers but they have yet to reboot everything.  The majority of the Transformers films are bad but they still continue to be made.  Despite the negative reception Spiderman 3 had the highest gross of all three Raimi movies.  As you can guess I did not like this film at all.  I just felt it was a very boring retread that was done better the first time with the Raimi films.  Say what you want about the other Spiderman films but I will take them any day (including Spiderman 3) over this film.

There are a couple things I like about the film that they improved on from the original films.  Andrew Garfield, in my opinion, does a better job as Peter Parker, performance wise, than Tobey McGuire.  I like Tobey as Peter Parker/Spiderman.  I blame the writing for most of the issues I have with him.  However, there are times when his delivery felt very forced and/or corny.  Andrew Garfield has few of those moments, except one scene which felt very forced.  Plus he looks much more like Peter in the comics nowadays as opposed to Tobey McGuire who, like the Raimi films in general, is trying to capture the old school Spiderman from when he was first released in the 1960s.  Also, Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy does a great job and plays a much better main female character than Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane.  Kirsten is a fine actress but she did not capture the essence of the Mary Jane from the comics at all.  Not-to-mention she was just a token love interest/damsel in distress in all three Raimi films.  At least Gwen Stacy was able to defend herself and was not the damsel in distress here.  Plus Emma Stone does a better acting job.  Some of the action scenes are also fun to watch, but they are few and far between.  The action in the original movies is miles better.

The biggest problem is the story.  This movie is basically a retread of the original from the origin to even the villain.  There are some changes but they are not even noteworthy.  First of all, why did you have to retell Spidermans origin?  Spidermans origin has already been done before (and done better I might add) in the very first film as well as various animated series that have come out over the years.  The majority of people, whether itd be comic book fans or the general public, already know the origin.  There was no reason to go over it again, and there was definitely no reason for it to take up about half of the film.  The origin in Raimis film only took a half hour or a bit more while this took over fifty minutes.  There some alterations but they are pointless and, in my opinion, lame.  When I watched this film I was bored out of my mind in the first half.

Unfortunately the second half did not do much for me either.  The villain is lame and boring.  He is basically a poor retread of Green Goblin (Norman Osborn) from the first film.  The Lizard (Dr. Connors) is basically Green Goblin but without the energy is his performance.  They were both scientists experimenting with unstable concoction that ends up giving them enhanced abilities and they end up becoming super villains.  They are also both green (though The Lizard is a mutation while Norman just wore a suit).  This film even ripped off the split personality thing that Norman had and had Connors exhibit it as well.  Can you not come up with anything new?  Unlike Green Goblin, the Lizard is just a bore.  Green Goblin at least had energy and you loved to hate him.  The only thing the Lizard had over Green Goblin is that his motivations are clearer.  Ultimately, his main goal is just a stereotypical comic book villain plot and nothing more, which would not be so bad if the villain was more interesting and more fun.  I have problems with the Green Goblin in the first film but he is a much more entertaining film and Willem Dafoe brings his A-game unlike the guy who plays the Lizard who was sleepwalking through his role.

This film is also guilty of false advertising.  The trailers advertised that Peters parents would be in the movie and would play a big part in Spidermans origin.  This actually got me excited when I heard about it.  Peters parents had never been explore or even mentioned on screen before.  Even in the comics they are rarely touched upon.  I thought that this would be a great addition to Spidermans mythos and would help this film stand out from the others.  Instead this plot point was only teased to us in multiple parts of the film (mainly the beginning) and is left to be explained in the sequel.  No! Thats unacceptable.  You cannot advertise such a large plot element in the trailers but do nothing with it.  Thats called false advertising.

Even though I like Andrew Garfield as Peter I do not like this Peter Parker.  People complain about Peter in the Raimi films being too whiny but this Peter is just as whiny.  He also comes off as a jerk to everyone a number of times throughout this movie especially to Aunt May and Gwen.  He is too downbeat is the problem.  Tobey McGuire was more upbeat than him.  Peter Parker/Spiderman is supposed to be a more upbeat character that uses his wit with villains to cope with his situation, which he barely does here.  All of the advertising that was released was promoting a wittier Spiderman and everyone constantly raves about how Spiderman is actually witty in this, but hes not.  He tells like four jokes in the entire film.  Tobey McGuire used his wit just as much in the first film.  Tobeys Spiderman did not use his wit nearly as much as he should have but it is not like he never used it.  I can think of three or four times in each of the three movies where he tries to be witty and funny, which is about as many times as Andrew Garfield did.  This is another case of false advertising.  Also, I do not like the new costume Spiderman has.  If there was one thing that the Raimi films got right 100% it was the costume.  The new costume does not look as cool and it is too dark, much like the film itself.

I have the same problem with Peter as I do with the movie in general in that he is too dark.  Another major issue with the film is that it is too dark.  Amazing Spiderman feels very much like Batman Begins from the majority of the film focusing on origin to the overall look of the film to the very tone of the film which is too dark.  The film might as well be called Spiderman Begins rather than Amazing Spiderman.  Spiderman is not Batman.  They are two completely different characters.  Just because The Dark Knight Trilogy is popular does not mean you can use the same tone for every superhero.  Marvel Studios understands this so why cant other studios understand it.  You can say that the other film (especially the first one) is too campy but they felt much more like Spiderman than this movie did.

Peter, in this film, is not only too dark but he is also a moron.  He is supposed to be a genius but he does not come off as smart at all in this.  After he discovers his abilities there are several scenes where he shows he has powers in public places whether itd be in a subway or his school.  There are also a couple scenes where he is web-slinging in the middle of the city without his costume where everyone can clearly see him.  Really Peter!?  How it that none of these people put it together that he is Spiderman?  There are scenes like that in the original film but they are done subtler than it is here.  He also puts his name on some of his personal belongings which is how The Lizard figures out he is Spiderman.  Both Gwen and her father bother find out his secret too.  He cannot keep his identity a secret to save his life.  I know he is supposedly a teenager but he is a complete idiot in this film.

Some of the casting does not work for me either.  I like Martin Sheen as an actor his take on Uncle Ben did nothing for me and I did not care for Sally Field as Aunt may at all.  To me, Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris are the definitive Uncle Ben and Aunt May.

On another note, the effects are subpar.  I cannot believe that this film cost more than the Avengers.  Some of the effects look pretty good but most of them are on par with the first film which came out a decade prior to this.  The effects of Spiderman 2 & 3 beat the crap out of the effects in this movie.  For example, the CGI for the Lizard himself is god-awful.  He looks almost as silly as the Green Goblins costume in the first movie.  The score is completely forgettable.  Say what you want about the score for the other three movies, but at least it is memorable.  I do not remember the music for Amazing Spiderman at all.

Overall, I did not like this movie at all.  I know I am in the minority but I do not care.  Hopefully Amazing Spiderman 2 is actually good.  Say what you want about the original film, but that film is timeless, it has heart, and it is, above all, fun.  I like all of the Sam Raimi films better than this film.  Yes, I even prefer Spiderman 3 over this.  That film was, at least, entertaining.  This movie is boring, a retread of the first film, too dark, and is not that fun at all, in my opinion.",1399075200,4,9701,4.353433835845896

4414554,4,B004LWZWFQ,"I'm a big fan of all three Raimi Spider Man films and when I heard they were doing a reboot I was skeptical, but being a fan of the character for over 40 years I decided to go see this film.

The Good: 1) We get the wisecracking Web Head from the comics, 2) The special effects are excellent, 3) A better Gwen Stacy. 4) Mechanical web shooters 5) The best Stan Lee Cameo ever!

The Bad: 1) This wisecracking Web Head is a little too mean spirited and Peter is way too cool to be the nerdy outcast from the comics. 2) The Lizard is poorly designed, he isn't sympathetic like in the comics and that takes a lot away from the character. He is much more interesting if he can't control his changing into The Lizard and having a family gives the character complexity. 3) They don't utilize the fact that his web shooters are mechanical and even though they weren't organic in the comic books, I prefer that route in the live action films. 6) When uncle Ben dies, it isn't heartfelt and Peter doesn't show enough emotion about it.

Toby McGuire may not have been the perfect wise cracker in the Raimi films, but he was engaging to watch when not in Spider Man mode. This was key to making a super hero film that was entertaining through out the entire film. (like Robert Downey as Iron Man).

I know a lot of people complained about Spider Man taking his mask off all the time, but if you think about it that mask would have to be extremely uncomfortable and hot, so I think that is just a realistic observation by the filmmakers, but some times emotions are needed to be seen and you can't see expressions through the mask.

The Amazing Spider Man is a very good film, but I won't watch it nearly as many times as the Raimi Spider Man films. It just isn't as much fun or as good. The Blu Ray has a very good transfer and some interesting bonus material, but nothing like the Raimi Spider man films received on their 2 disc DVD sets.

Looking forward to seeing Spider Man 2 on opening day. :-D

4414599,2,B004LWZWFQ,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

No one involved with this movie cared about making a good movie. Because they don't need to. The Spiderman movies will make money no matter good or bad they are. But that doesn't mean they should not try to. Why did this movie get made? Simple, Sam Raimi wasn't given enough time to make a fourth spider-man film so he quit, and the fans wanted to see the lizard on screen. This movie wasn't made for any other reason.

First off, Peter Parker doesn't have a goal in this movie. At first its to find out what happened to his parents, which isn't explained in this movie. After half an hour he now tries to control his new powers, in scenes that don't help the audience. In the original spider-man, Peter learned about his powers in a controlled environment, he didn't beat up innocent people on a subway train. It's nice to know no one on that train reported that a man beat up five people while climbing walls. But Peter learning his powers can't be an entire focus in the movie, so we kill Uncle Ben. This time it doesn't work because the only reason Peter let the criminal get away was because Peter couldn't get a chocolate milk. To get so upset that he couldn't afford a chocolate milk that he would let a robber get away with the stores money is a contrivance in every way. So for about ten minutes Peters new goal is to bring uncle Ben's murderer to justice, let the police can't link all these look alike criminals spider-man does capture with the man who did kill peters uncle. After a while he just stops doing this, with no reason! And there is still about an hour left, so what are we going to do now? How about introduce that main villain you've been promising us? The Lizard is horribly written in every scene he's in. Why does he go to so much trouble to knock cars off of a bridge just to tell one guy (who is never seen afterwords) that their vaccine isn't ready yet? Because we needed another action scene. After that they bring up that the daily bugle wants pictures of the lizard, a point that doesn't amount to anything, except the lizard finding out who spider-man is. For someone as smart as Peter Parker has been set up to be it was really stupid for him to put his name on the camera he was using to take pictures of the lizard.

The climax doesn't work for 2 reasons. The first being this is the same climax we've seen in about four other superhero movies. The second one being there are no stakes. Only half of Manhattan would be infected 8 minutes after the lizard started his chemical missile, decreasing the people at risk greatly. Also THERE'S A CURE FOR THIS!! You know, the thing Gwen has been working on for the past 6 minutes? Whoever gets infected can just get the cure shot into them afterwords, and as of right now there are only 10 people infected, so why waster your time trying to put the cure into the missile that will stretch half of Manhattan and only effect 10 people?!

Gwen Stacy's dad dies and tells Peter to leave Gwen out of this, and proceeds to still date Gwen. What a great way to respect someone who died protecting people! Don't watch this movie, don't waste your time with this movie, even Spiderman 3 was better than this, so just watch the Sam Raimi trilogy, at least those movies had effort put into them.",1398470400,2,3307,4.3723577235772355

I think mainly because this is how spiderman is supposed to be... he's supposed to be a rather young and goofy guy... and I liked that while he had to make some serious choices he seemed to really be enjoying himself with these new awesome powers...

The movie takes way too long establishing the back-story but when Peter finally gets his powers it becomes a special FX extravaganza. I realize that this is the movies but regrowing an arm and hand is one thing, doing so in a couple hours is quite another. Strange to see Denis Leary as an officer of the law.

4414841,5,B004LWZWFQ,"While this film isn't a magnum opus of Super Hero films, it improves on the Spider Man franchise's previous offerings in spades.  While I was apprehensive of Gwen Stacy's selection as Peter's main squeeze in this particular movie, I think it was a wise choice by the studio and writers.

Much is done to distance this movie from the previous offerings, as the plot leaps along through Peter Parker's life and background without feeling rushed.

Most of the parts are well acted, though I have to give kudos to Spider Man, Gwen Stacy and Gwen's father in particular as stand out roles in this film.  Gwen's father comes out at the beginning seeming like a character the audience is supposed to dislike because of how him and Peter interact.  But you never quite get there and I find myself admiring the steadfast manner of the character.

The pacing works for the film and I think it moves the story along at a relatively reasonable rate.  As with most Marvel films, you'll find that the movie follows a relatively well developed formula that involves so much exposition before settling into a faster, action-filled pace towards the end of the movie.  The end DID feel a little rushed as the plot struggles to tie off all of the lose ends that are meant to be tied off in short order.  But I also think they made an effort to segue into the next movie that makes it work a little bit better.

This is a movie that was made with a sequel in mind, and without trying to shoehorn Spiderman into the Avengers, though he's been one of their headlining members in the comics for some time. I think if Spidey is going to be on the Avengers, the Disney/Marvel writers are trying to grow him up a little before he is.

I think Spider-Man easily stands on it's own among the Marvel films, and for their individual hero films is one of the better movies in the Marvel Film franchises.",1396828800,4,1872,4.492625368731564

I was not impressed by Andrew Garfield's acting, but I wasn't a big fan of Tobey Maguire either. I watched the film for the escape of it, with its interesting story and great special effects.
I know we are not reviewing shipping in these reviews, but I think people should be aware when there are problems with the product so they won't get stuck like I did. I ordered The Amazing Spider-Man (Three-Disc Combo: Blu-ray / DVD + UltraViolet Digital Copy) and the outside slip cover that covers the interior case said just that. Well I bought this as a gift so it was not opened until well after the 30 day return window. When it was opened, the inside case was labeled Blu-Ray + DVD. No Ultraviolet mentioned on the interior case, so of course there was no code to activate the Ultraviolet. Someone must have taken the Blu-Ray / DVD +Ultraviolet case out of the slip cover and placed a Blu-Ray + DVD case in it instead. I'm not a big fan of the UltraViolet system, so I wasn't too broke up about it, but I do like to get what is advertised. If the Ultraviolet is important to you, slip the case out of the cover and make sure you got the right version.",1395964800,4,1254,4.317796610169491

The basic story is the same as the previous first Spiderman (OK with some differences), and although it might
be a little funnier, it lucks the amazement felt when we first saw spider webs going all around

Though, there is considerably more humor than what the trailers suggest and overall it does a pretty good job at characterization while delivering a world that is more realistic than the previous Spiderman movie.

So, compared to the previous spiderman movie, I like this one more. Granted, I wasn't the biggest fan of the previous trilogy and only watched it once, barely remembering really what happened, but still, there's something about this one that's more real, and so more fantastic, than the previous spiderman.

Of course, since this is a Hollywood movie, the end of the movie ends up being kind of stupid, with lots of guys jumping around and murdering each other. That's kind of expected at this point, and at this budget, and so it is what it is. I do wish that these movies would start taking risks though, in interrupting this formula.

There are definitely several adorable moments between Peter and Gwen. He's not portrayed so much in this one as being the open genius like in the other movies, in this one he's portrayed more as an outcast.

I understand the need to want to reboot everything and start over after they screwed the pooch with the first trilogy but this just didn't seem to hold any emotional investment with me. Considering I'm a lifelong comic fan I think that was a huge disappointment as I grew up with this character over numerous decades.

Overall, the origin is basically the same with some needless additions and my misgivings were mainly with the villain set-up and ending. The Lizard just seemed like a boring conflict and the ending seemed quite contrived. The scene where all the cranes point in so Spider-Man could swing...kinda pointless considering they're all on top of buildings that he can easily swing from as well.

4415496,5,B004LWZWFQ,"This movie was Amazing!! Betther than the first three in my humble opinion. Some people don't think so because of the origin story being told more than once. Well I think that Marc Webb did a great job telling the story once again because he didn't have to go in depth all that much because we all know what is going to happen. The actions sequences were amazing and better than the previous trilogy.

By far the best Spider Man movie ever made. This was what every other Spider Man was missing, great actors, gripping story and tons of action. The new Spider Man captures the true essence of the comic book, and delivers a story that could be taken from a comic book itself.

Going forward i can't see another actor being used in the role of Spider Man, Andrew Garfield is the embodiment of Spider Man, and he definitely delivers a super hero performance.

If you are a fan of the comic book, or of action super hero movies, this one is a must see.

Nevertheless we were curious, so we bought it.  Overall, it was ok, but nothing like the original movies.  I'd have to say this one isn't even loosely based on the Comic book history and storyline of Spiderman.

4415608,2,B004LWZWFQ,"Poor CGI and a rushed and overly complicated plot ruined what was once a promising film franchise. Peter Parker is a popular skateboarder with great hair and a crush. If that doesn't sound like the peter Parker you know and love you're not alone. In attempting to be completely different from the Rami movies, sony has ruined spider man, this can be seen in uncle bens pivotal scene with pete in which he imparts the truth about power and responsibility. I'm sure we all know the line, it's been portrayed in comics and cartoons and tv but Sony decided that the phrase "" with great power comes great responsibility "" was too much in line with the rami movies so instead we get a long rambling speech that tried to say the exact same thing but fails in tone and sentiment. This reboot draws on the Ultimate line of comics, for those that don't know, the ultimate line was started in the 2000's to acclimate new readers with classic heroes, it's for a younger audience and so is this movie, that's why peter is a high school student and a skateboarder. That's all well and fine but Andrew Garfield's portrayal of peter Parker makes it seem like he has OCD or autism not the powers of a spider. The CGI is also very poor, the final fight scene is particularly bad, and the logic behind how spidey has to reach the top of the building to face the lizard  is just ridiculous, apparently spiderman can only web sling to the tops of buildings if construction cranes have been moved into position for him.

4415742,5,B004LWZWFQ,"Despite my slightly young age, I was one of the many who grew up watching the Raimi Spider-Man films. Despite the third getting mixed reception, the other two were very well received and could be considered modern classics. So naturally I was disappointed when I learned that they were rebooting the franchise. Marvel's second take, called The Amazing Spider-Man, is a darker incarnation of the beloved comics. So those who haven't seen the film are wondering: does this film do the old webhead justice?

Well... you've probably already figured out what I think due to the rating I gave it. Still, I'm going to go into the film in detail to offer my pros and cons.

Spider-Man's origin story, like Batman Begins and Man of Steel, is very much the same as that of the comics, with some slight alterations. Yes, he gets bit by a radioactive spider. Yes, Uncle Ben dies. Yes, there is great power and great responsibility (although this movie kind of paraphrases it). However, there are certain things that are different about it. I'm not going to say what to avoid spoilers. Just know that it is mostly the same origin. This is the only thing that I'm not too big a fan of. It seems like certain differences they have in the origin are only different because Marvel wants to avoid being too much like the Raimi films. However, the changes are outweighed by the extra depth put into the origins of how he became a superhero.

The rest of the story, however, stands out magnificently. The villain, who in this film is the Lizard, actually plays a vital role in this film, as opposed to the Green Goblin who was just in because the film needed a villain. Don't get me wrong- I love the Willem Defoe Goblin. I'm just saying that the Lizard was key to his origin and the plot. This film also explores the story of Peter Parker's parents, which was ignored in the Raimi films. Unfortunately, this plot isn't resolved in this film. Hopefully, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 will clear things up more.

The characters are excellent. Andrew Garfield is a near perfect Peter Parker and Spider-Man. This Spidey is actually a wisecraker, as opposed to the Tobey Maguire one. Rhys Ifans is a great Dr. Connors and much easier to see being the Lizard than the previous one. Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy is more interesting than Mary Jane and actually does important stuff in the film. Dennis Leary was a huge improvement over the last Captain Stacy, and this time, he's actually cool. The acting is very good. I think this one portrays teenagers more accurately than the Raimi ones. Oh, and I would just like to say that Martin Sheen is a super awesome (and funny) Uncle Ben.

The action is also more interesting in this one, which is saying something since the Raimi films had some pretty great action. It gets very intense, and sometimes a little graphic. But this version also shows that Spider-Man doesn't start out perfect. As you watch the film, you see that Spider-Man's fighting style was rather sloppy, but by the end of it, he fights in his usual kung fu-like style. One thing I liked in particular was that Spider-Man does more things like a spider. He does things like crawl around the Lizard while entangling him in webs, which I have to say was really cool.

When it comes down to it, I'd have to say that I liked The Amazing Spider-Man more than the Raimi Spider-Man. The story is more interesting, the acting and characters are better, and the action's great. However, please note that these are my opinions. I understand if you like the Raimi Spider-Man better.

This film has gotten me excited for more, and I anticipate the next one coming out this year!

4415743,3,B004LWZWFQ,"Sony's Spider-Man came out around 2002 and it was due for a reboot.  However, for fans old enough to remember the 2002 version, you will feel a sense of Deja-Vu.  It just seems too reminiscent of the Toby movies.  The CGI looks nice, but you feel like you are watching scenes from a video game.

I love Spider-man so I was excited for this, but was very disappointed.  It has its moments and seeing Spider-Man swing around is awesome.  It just wasn't that exciting watching him chase a Lizard in the sewers.  I don't think The Lizard by himself was enough to hold the movie as the main vilian.

4415858,4,B004LWZWFQ,"The Amazing Spider-Man is a very good reboot from the Sam Raimi series.  This movie is very well acted and in many ways I think Andrew Garfield does a better job at being Peter Parker than Tobey Maguire did.  Here is a summary of the cast and plot of the movie.

This reboot came out in 2012 was directed by Marc Webb, and stars Andrew Garfield (Spider-Man), Emma Stone, Rhys Ifans, Denis Leary, Campbell Scott, Irrfan Khan, Martin Sheen and Sally Field.  A young Peter Parker discovers his father Richard Parker's study has been burglarized.  Gathering up hidden documents, Peter's parents take him to the home of his Aunt May and Uncle Ben, then mysteriously depart.  The film focuses mainly on the story of Peter Parker who becomes Spider-Man after being bitten by a genetically altered spider.  Parker uses his new found gifts to try to stop Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) from spreading a mutation serum to the city's human population.

I enjoyed this reboot and would definitely recommend this movie.

4415863,4,B004LWZWFQ,"The thing that got me about this movie (and yes, flaws and all, I consider it to be better than the first Raimi/McGuire/Dunst Spider-Man) was how perfectly they capture Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy's romance.  These two characters seemed very real (within the context of the movie), and Andrew Garfield's portrayal of Peter/Spider-Man is infectious in his giddiness and High-School exuberance.  I am not a fan of Emma Stone, but she definitely batted Gwen Stacy's portrayal out of the park.  Add to this Dennis Leary as Captain Stacy, Rhys Ifans as The Lizard, and Sally Field as Aunt May, and you have an incredibly winning combination.

SPOILER ALERT - Sure, they did not follow the original storyline to a ""T"" (Spoiler Alert!!!)  Cap Stacy doesn't have his final battle with the Lizard (it was Doc Octopus), Peter catches the ""Burglar"" (guy who robbed the convenience store) almost immediately, and as to flaws, there is NO way Peter could have entered such a secure environment as Oscorp as easy as he did without getting arrested.  But those are nit-picks, and most people that didn't follow comic books as children will not even notice.

To this day (taking out some of Peter's crying) I consider Spider-Man 2 the best Spider-Man movie that has been done to date.  Still, as the first movie in a new series, Amazing Spider-Man was overall a better retelling of the iconic story, and the Andrew Garfiled / Emma Stone portrayal of the main characters really go a long way to make it so.

4415979,5,B004LWZWFQ,"The Amazing Peter Parker
***This review may contain spoilers.***

Initially, like many people, my knee-jerk response to The Amazing Spiderman (hereafter TAS) was unnecessary and redundant.  I felt that Tobey Maguires interpretation on the famed arachnoid (and Peter Parker) was thoroughly satisfying and complete.  Therefore, I didn't bother seeing TAS at the Cineplex.  But recently on cable, Encore was periodically showing TAS and, eventually giving into my curiosity, sat down one Saturday morning to give TAS a chance.  Now I wish I had seen TAS in the movie theatre.  Although it covers the usual Spidey origin trajectory (nerdy but brainy loner, loving aunt/uncle, bite from genetically altered spider, subsequent infusion of powers and confidence, emergence of outlandish but deadly villain), I think TAS does a more touching, affecting, and dare I say it, grittily realistic depiction of Spiderman, and more importantly, Peter Parker.

Too often, superheroes eclipse their alter egos and give us the often mistaken impression that without their powers, they are nobodies (Hero to Zero, you might say).  Many superhero movies seem to reflect that impression and somewhat rush the origin story so that we can get to the exciting hero as quickly as possible.  I think Sam Raimis Spiderman did that to some extent, acknowledging but accelerating Maguires Peter Parker angst, sorrow, and alienation so that people didn't feel too down and could get to see their high-swinging, inspirational hero as soon as possible.  Director Mark Webbs TAS takes more deliberate, measured time in revealing Spidey because I think he wants the audience to realize that Peter Parker is an amazing kid way before the fateful spider gets to him.

So instead of rushing through the tense high school drama to get to college, as Maguires Parker did, Andrew Garfields Parker remains in high school and emotionally, uncomfortably, but convincingly reminds us how harrowing that environment can be, especially to a reserved, sometimes inarticulate loner and orphan.  And yet, Peter is far from pathetic.  In TAS, he is a skilled photographer and skateboarder.  He is also an accomplished science student, and he proves it when he deciphers his late parents science papers, formulas, and algorithms, especially the missing formula that completes amputee Dr. Curtis Connors (Rhys Ifanss) successful but horrifyingly reptilian tissue regeneration.  Of course, unlike Maguires Spideys organic webs, Garfields Parker devises the web fluid and dispensers himself.  Furthermore, Garfields Parker conducts extensive research to learn why, as a 4-year old (Max Charles), he was left with his uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field), and begins to uncover an intricate connection between his parents, Oscorp, and Dr. Connors (and a mysterious stranger).

Garfield, however, is careful not to make Parker into a perfect goody-goody.  Perhaps because of his abandonment by his parents, Parker has rebellious, mischievous tendencies that would lure him into juvenile delinquency if not for his uncle/aunt and a potential love interest, Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone).  Parker can also be irresponsible, spiteful, and distracted, which leads to that life-altering, emotionally shattering family tragedy involving Uncle Ben.  Although basically polite and respectful, Parker manages to antagonize and disconcert Gwens father, Police Captain Stacy (Denis Leary) who (like Daily Bugle newspaper publisher J. Jonah Jameson in Raimis film), considers Spiderman a selfish, dangerous vigilante, despite Parkers earnest protests.

Nevertheless, I think Parker earns the audiences admiration as he begins to rise above his shortcomings and use his natural talents (with a little help with his spider powers) to balance, juggle, and reconcile his personal, romantic, and professional problems.  In fact, I believe that Parker is such an intriguing character on his own, the movie would still be involving and entertaining even if Parker tackled his problems without his powers.  As Uncle Bens posthumous voicemail on Parkers cell phone mentions, Peter was always destined for great things.  The spider powers just make his life a little more interesting.

P.S.:  Commenting upon the Lizards appearance in the movie, I personally had no complaints.  As a cross between a Komodo dragon and the Hulk, the Lizard sported a too-human face, according to some detractors.  I think that was essential to convey the Lizards/Dr. Connors latent, if somewhat misguided, humanity and his final, merciful treatment of Parker/Spiderman. If the Lizard had had to speak and show his feelings with a snout like, say, a Velociraptor, I think it would have less effective, and even a bit laughable.",1384387200,,4739,5.454794520547945
4415980,4,B004LWZWFQ,"After getting bitten by a genetically-modified spider, teenager Peter Parker discovers he has spider-like abilities. However, after looking into his past, he meets Dr. Conors and becomes the scientist's pupil. When Peter's uncle is murdered in cold blood, he uses his new spider abilities to try and track down the killer and ends up creating an alternate identity in the process. Meanwhile, Dr. Conors's own limb-regeneration experiments goes haywire and the good doctor is transformed into a giant lizard. Peter, now under the identity of Spider-Man, takes it upon himself to stop the Lizard at all costs before others get hurt.

When I first heard they were rebooting Spider-Man, I was like, ""Come on, really? You just did that in the movies, the cartoons, in the comics . . ."" It seems Spider-Man has only one story to tell: his origin. They keep doing it, after all.

But I got something more than that in The Amazing Spider-Man and I was won over. While I enjoyed the Raimi films on the whole, this one seemed more comic book Spider-Man to me as they dialed back the clock all the way to his childhood and got a bit more into Peter Parker's (Andrew Garfield's) parents' history, introduced Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), and went with a villain that fans have been itching to see ever since his civilian identity was mentioned back in the 2002 Spider-Man movie: Dr. Conors aka the Lizard (Rhys Ifans). While Spidey's origin stayed true to its main components--getting bitten by a spider, Peter Parker as a student, the tragic death of Uncle Ben--they modernized it a bit and seemed to suggest that, kind of like in the 2003 Hulk movie, our hero's destiny was mapped out for him many years before. This part I wasn't too keen on, to be honest, nor was I big on how the Peter Parker side of things was done: pretty cool dude, likeable, good looking, hot girlfriend, etc. Pretty much the opposite of nerdy Parker becoming a superhero.

However, on the Spider-Man side of things, we got one wicked webcrawler on our hands. We've got three movies prior to this one to learn how to make him move, swing around, climb walls, spin webs--everything that was showcased in this flick was like a comic book come to life. What made it work, too, was that it was believable and didn't look like a 3D cartoon unlike some sequences in 2002's Spider-Man. What made it even more special was that this Spider-Man actually cracked a lot of jokes, something that was missing for the most part from the other outings. And the Spider-Man-point-of-view wall crawling and swinging around scenes? Yes, please! Totally made you feel like you were there and reminded me a lot of the Spider-Man ride at Universal Studios in Florida. Bring back the mechanical webshooters instead of the organic variety (I didn't mind those, actually, as it makes more sense), and Spider-Man is back in business, baby!

The stakes were high in this movie, too, with the Lizard being a serious bad guy to contend with. He was strong, powerful, showed no mercy, and that sewer scene was spooky.

This movie was a lay-the-groundwork movie, setting things up for what is currently rumored to be three sequels and, according to director Marc Webb, aiming for the Sinister Six storyline, which was being mapped out even while they were making this Spider-Man movie. I can't wait. A giant Spider-Man story is going to be awesome and I'm glad they started from scratch to make it happen as they can then link everything together, starting from scene one.

So what can I say? I've been pulled to the other side and am glad they rebooted Spider-Man. A part of me can't help but wonder what might've been had Spider-Man 4 happened, but this new journey we're on with our favorite webhead is off to a good start.",1384300800,3,3753,4.713414634146342
4415981,3,B004LWZWFQ,"I've always been hesitant about remakes, or even reboots.  If you think about it logically, no one ever seems to want to remake a bad film; everyone always wants to remake a good film.  And when you remake a good film, there will be natural comparisons:  ""Is the new one as good?  Is the new one worse?  Why even remake this thing?"" might be a few good questions you might ask.

But I do think it's not a bad idea to remake a film if there was something seriously wrong with the original -- the acting was terrible or the direction was terrible, for example -- but that doesn't seem to be the case with the ""original"" Spiderman franchise with Toby Maguire.  And while special effects surely have improved over the last few years or so, they haven't improved enough to justify this reboot.

""So why then?"" you may ask, and the reason is obvious:  it is a moneymaker.  The film itself wouldn't have to be all that good to make a buck or two (or a 100 million or two), and this is exactly what happened.  While it probably made a lot of money, ""The Amazing Spiderman"" proves that spiders have no soul.  And neither does this film.

But what is even worse about this whole endeavor:  I got thinking while watching -- you'll have plenty of time to think since this misfire won't really tax your brain in any way -- and I came to the conclusion that ""Spiderman"" or ""Superman"" or ""X-Man,"" you name it, doesn't really fit into the framework of American political correctness nowadays.  I give away no spoiler when I write that you've got the trophy-girlfriend-who-needs-to-be-saved chick, and you've got the bullied-kid-but-now-he's-the-tough-guy superhero saving her.  But do you ever see this dynamic in commercials in the 21st century?  Heck no!  What you see is some girl who's been training to fight and kick tail, and SHE saves the guy!  Yeah!  Everybody wins; the guy doesn't get his tail kicked and the girl gets to show how empowered women have become.  Not so here in Spiderman.

Of course, I'm being a little snarky about the change in sexual dynamics, but I'm still not far from the truth.  And what is even a ""bigger"" truth, if ""truth"" can and may be a relative term:  there was no reason to remake this film.  Well, other than to take your money, of course.",1384300800,2,2263,4.5283950617283955

4416171,5,B004LWZWFQ,"I thought they did a fine job retelling Spiderman's origin here. It was very good job and I don't understand the one star reviews for a A list movie of this caliber. My only complaints are the fact that the film should have been shot in 3d and not redone in 3d in post production.  It's a dark movie picture wise and the 3d version is even darker than the 2d version! ,
 and native 3d will always look far batter than movies shot in 2d and processed in 3d. It looks similar to ""John Carter'  in way the 3d looks. which is good but not the same as a native 3d film looks. That's a small gripe considering they did a fine job on this film in everything else. There's a lot of criticism about the way the lizard looks. He looks better in the comic books. Sure, but he looks good in this film too.  And did we need it to be rebooted? , probably not this early but it still worked for me. And it's a big budget film that makes it points well.  It was good to see spiderman back in high school and having to deal with flash tompson. IN the comics Flash becomes 'man wolf' and spiderman must battle him.  But that's another story.  The film hopefully will have a sequel someday and let's hope they shoot it in 3d! It makes a huge difference on how well the 3d film will look.  The blu ray comes with a whole disc of extras. And for those with 2d TV's the film looks just about the same , but with less depth. I would say"" if you love superhero films then this one is a very good one.  Few fans hated this as compared to 'the green hornet' , or 'green lantern' , both of which were decent but not great. With 'green hornet' being a part comedy at that.  This is above them by leaps and bounds, although I did enjoy those films as well.",1382659200,2,1727,4.038123167155425

Extras and outtakes and all the other stuff can generally give you a better view about why the movie was made the way it was and what the actors put into it which can give it more appeal. However in the case of this movie crap covered in roses is still crap. This is easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen and a horrible disgrace and insult to Spiderman and his long lineage. I don't know what inspired them to use this Garfield kid as he's horrible. The change to the story is just beyond bad and the CG Lizard is a complete fail. Much like the Green Lantern movie this whole thing seemed like nothing more than to get the lead actor and actress to hook up in real life, basically a million dollar date that we paid for by watching it.

What I think it loses from the previous three films is Sam Raimi (the previous director)'s absolute love of Spider Man, his sense of fun, and also his sense of the ridiculous. Raimi, with his astonishing visual style was just the perfect person to make these films. So yes, a bit over-serious at times, but still a good watch.

Now, I know I have a passive 3D TV, but watching My Bloody Valentine 3D on the same player and TV, every scene popped with depth.

4416479,4,B004LWZWFQ,"Did this movie come out too soon following Raimie's Spider-man series?  Yes.  Did it hurt the film a bit?  Yes.  But as a standalone film it is quite good, very satisfying.  Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker is more a teenager and less a college freshman though he's also more competent and confident that we're maybe used to seeing him and that works just fine; after all, he is still a bit nebbishy.  The film draws out good performances from all parts and Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy was a coup of a casting choice--you just may forget Mary Jane!  And though the film sets us up for a mystery to unfold over a series of movies the real drawback to this movie is the villain; the Lizard is an iconic Spidey villain but flattening his face on film to make him a bit more anthropomorphized was a mistake and lessened his menace.

Still, action fans will have a lot to love here and the film has heart.  I especially liked the scene where an injured wall-crawler makes his way through downtown Manhattan with the help of a few fellow New Yorkers.  That was a great piece of spirit for the franchise (old or new).

While you have to give a nod to what came first this still stands side-by-side as a great superhero film.  4.5 stars.",1376438400,3,1224,4.391111111111111

4416595,1,B004LWZWFQ,"Why? Why do another Spider-man origin movie after it was done definitively by Sam Raimi and starring Toby Maguire in 2002? I had problems with the first Spider-man movie too, I found the Green Goblin to be very annoying for instance, but the origin story in Spiderman 1 with Toby Maguire was perfection! Sam Raimi's addition of biological based web spinners was an inspiration to the to the Spidey canon, so WHY go backwards and give the web-slinger mechanically based webs? How could a high school kid like Peter Parker afford super high tech web spinners, not to mention the refills! Why change the origin story from a nuclear irradiated spider that bites Peter Parker to a regular spider that may or may not have been genetically altered? Why make Peter Parker a jerk who, as soon as he acquires his powers becomes a bully who now bullies his former bully Flash, and then steals Flash's girlfriend. Don't worry, for some inexplicable reason, Flash forgives by the end of the movie.. Andrew Garfield isn't awful, Sally Field and Martin Sheen, all try their best with a terrible script. For instance, when Peter comes home late after being bitten by the spider, he's sweaty, sick looking and literally raids the fridge while his seemingly unconcerned Uncle Ben and Aunt May make jokes about her awful meatloaf... HELLO? Your nephew Peter looks like he's on DRUGS and you two are too oblivious to see it? The problem is the illogical script, but it's also bad direction, not to mention continuity errors.

4416602,1,B004LWZWFQ,"So I saw this movie back when it came out and I have had a lot of time to chew this one over. I am baffled by how many people loved this movie. I did not see spider-man or Peter Parker in this movie. I think the studio set out to tell the story of a kid who became a hero with spider powers who would relate to modern day teenagers but no where did I see the spider-man I know and love. I would like to start by saying how much I loved the original spider-man movies with Tobey Maguire. I thought the original trilogy showed the story of a struggling hero who never got anything easy but was a good man who eventually got through much adversity that eventually got the girl. This was a hero we wanted to root for. The new movie focuses on an arrogant Peter Parker who seems too into himself and not humbled by the experience of becoming a hero with responsibility but rather out for revenge against his uncles killer rather then helping the innocent right away. To make this easier I will put it into the list of all the things that are wrong.

1. Peter Parker is too Cool, suave, and attractive- It's not that the Peter Parker character is ever portrayed as ugly or anything but he is defiantly not the best looking either. He is supposed to be the average everyday  bookworm who is geeky. Andrew Garfield doesn't fit the bill he literally gets Gwen easy as 1,2,3 just by his bashful flirting techniques. OH BOY! Tobey Maguire pulled this off perfectly being charismatic as spidey but being geeky and shy while peter. Notice he doesn't get the girl so easy and would rather protect Mary Jane then let her get hurt.

2. Flash Thompson- Are you kidding me? Did he really just stand up to the bully with no problem. One of the things that made us root for Tobeys Peter was he couldn't stand up for himself before he got his powers. By making him being able to stand up to the bully right away it's like he never had a disadvantage it totally backfires. Then are we supposed to believe when he is so bashful around everyone else he can just all of a sudden stand up to the school bully. That brings us to point......

3. Basketball scene: Remember when the Raimi stand up to the bully sequence came after he got his powers but there was never indications of him having powers when fighting flash. Well in this basketball he should have had a tattoo on his head exclaiming ""I'm SPIDER-MAN"" because first we see him use his hands to have the ball stick and then he jumps higher then any regular person can to the basketball hoop. Why is this ok?

4. Do you also want to spider-man? - So when Peter sneaks into the tour which is always something you want to root for....jerk teenagers that break into places to find out info. Then he finds his way into a lab with a million spiders just like the one that bites him. Apparently anyone can be spider-man and it's not as special as the original Stan Lee/Raimi sets it up to be. A one spider deal at scientific demonstration.

5. Uncle bens death- So the director clearly trys to differentiate from the original Raimi film but they fail. Not only do they cut out the classic line ""With great power comes great responsibility...""which was such a HUGE mistake. This is such a huge thing and they cut it out in every way possible. Then they set up this death for Uncle ben where he is almost asking for it instead of an innocent victim. Where is Peter in all this mess? He isn't trying to get back at a wrestling promoter who cheated him out of his money for his silly teenage needs. He's off brooding over his issues and the fact he can't afford a milk.....why?

6. Who needs a job?- As soon as Uncle Ben dies he could care less about finding a way to fund what he is doing. Help out Aunt May? Forget it. I mean he literally finds no job. He doesn't need to do anything for what he is doing. After all this Peter doesn't have to do anything. It all comes to him. He has one mission....get some eggs. When does he get them? The end of the movie.

7. The webshooters- So they had the organic webshooters in the Raimi films which some people minded but I didn't understand all the fuss. But here we have a chance to get the mechanical webshooters and what do you know he steals them because ya know this Peter would rather steal everything then have to work for it. That would be too hard......Why is this more important though? Because Peter is supposed to be a science genius but yet he can't even make these webshooters or the webbing. It's like they didn't even try.

8. The lizard- So the original comics had Spider-man finding out that Curt Conners was the Lizard and trying to protect his identity so he wouldn't get in trouble and could take care of his family. But here Peter reports him to the police and this villain is basically one dementional. He doesn't have the problems with his son that Norman Osborn has, he doesn't have the loss of his lifes work and his wife like Doc ock has, he doesn't have the deteriorating health of his child on his conscious like Sandman, and even Venom probably the weakest villain of the first trilogy at least has the loss of his job and his kinda fling Gwen to blame. Why does this Lizard want to turn everyone into Lizards? I guess to make this superior race but this just seems stupid on film. If they wanted to make this powerful they should have brought in conners family but this villain is just boring. Not only that if the critics want to harp on Raimi's green goblin costume which I think is just totally ridiculous this Lizard CGI has to be one of the worst jobs I have seen.

9. The gwen factor- Remember the original trilogy when Mary Jane played such a vital part in the story. About as much as Peter. They had her starting out at a small diner, then working up to a play, and then getting to Broadway only to have a falling out. Not only that you had a woman who struggled at home with abuse and rose from this to become a stronger woman. Even making it through 3 where half the time her boyfriend was acting like a douche because of his new suit and ego. But the Peter/Mary Jane relationship is beautiful. We start off with one Mary Jane not so fond of Peter even though he loves her but Mary Jane falls in love with Spider-man which slowly grows into love for Peter as she gets to know him better. But then he realizes he can't be with her just when she expresses her love for him because he cannot put her in that danger. This leads to 2 where they long for each other but can't have each other still because of peters obligations. But then Mary Jane lays down the law saying she can make her own decisions and then they are together....so satisfying. We have a downfall in 3 with Peters douchery but this ultimately leads to Peter recognizing his mistakes and going on the road to making things right again with Mary Jane. The Peter and Gwen relationship is another thing flipped the other way. Gwen is a daddys girl who somehow got a huge internship at oscorp right away. A lot of this is not the directors or Emma stones fault because thats just how the character is written but a lot of it is. This movie doesn't even attempt to spend the time on Gwen that the others spent on Mary Jane. If they do have Gwen in a scene it's never her doing her own thing usually just her flirting in bad dialogue with Peter. Not only that Peter could give a care whether Gwen gets hurt. He is well aware the threat of the Lizard and he continues to just throw Gwen out of windows also to stay with her. And when Captain stacy finally tells Peter to respect his final wish to keep Gwen out of it. What does he respect that wish a total of two days before he smiles and seems willing to break that promise by the end of the movie.

10. The dark knight....uhh I mean spider- All the scenes with Spider-man save for the one in the school which is in a dark school are in the dark. This is spider-man and not Batman. Spider-man is supposed to be light hearted and generally light as a character. Not only that a lot of people loved that car robber scene. I thought it was disgraceful. Here he is basically torturing this guy making fun of him. Then he is spitting off that are not funny they are just disgusting. He even grabs his face and starts saying some scary stuff. Once again this is not Batman it's spider-man. It's supposed to be light hearted. Then the police officer who he says all this crazy stuff to and the police officer even sucks he just wants to shoot spider-man and the thief no matter what they are guilty of.

11. The quips- I don't think they were all that funny. Sure there was more in fact I don't think this spider-man said anything but jokes like a bad comedy act. Whenever Raimi's spider-man said a joke it was always a mix of annoying/charismatic as spidey has always been. Sure spider-man likes to poke fun at his enemies but it's in a fun playful way.....not a mean bullying way. After all remember Peter was bullied himself so this is basically a conflict of interest if he does it back.

12. The costume- This costume is just awful. I mean it isn't even close to what a spider-man costume should look like. While I thought they completely destroyed Peter parkers character in this movie I thought at least spider-man would be the saving grace but while the jokes were hit or miss this costume is a total miss making me just lose total interest in this movie. Really? Your gonna make the spider web lines into squares and change the design into crap. Luckily they changed this for the sequel but I doubt that will be much better then this crap.

So that's pretty much all I can think of now but I am sure there was more. I am not gonna sugar coat it I thought that Raimi and crew did an amazing jobs in there movies and I highly enjoyed them. This just falls flat for me taking shortcuts and trying to go for a modern telling like Ultimate Spider-man (except for some reason they called it amazing spider-man) but they miss a lot of the high notes even of that series. I can't understand why many people are trashing the Raimi classic films that started the spider-man craze that if it were not for those this unimaginative reboot would have never been born but I suppose I will never understand. So bottom line while you can find some fun summer entertainment in this movie (the school scene being the best mainly for the Stan Lee cameo the one thing the director did right) it's hard to find spider-man or Peter Parker in this disappointing reboot.",1374624000,6,10464,4.3158697863682605

The acting is good and the new take on an old story is fun and entertaining.  The casting was very good and used some contemporaries to freshen up the super hero story.  It's a great movie for a date night as well as just getting a bunch of guys together and drooling over the audio and visuals.,1374537600,,399,4.351351351351352

4416675,4,B004LWZWFQ,It was a pretty enjoyable movie to be honest. I believe it's part of the Marvel Movie universe with The Avengers so there's a continuity going on. I liked how they handled some things about his mythos like his web shooters. The actors were pretty good and it's always great to see Stan Lee in there in some way. I'm excited to see the second movie when it comes out.,1373500800,2,366,4.242857142857143

4416677,1,B004LWZWFQ,"Oh, wow, Spiderman is in the movies. Oh wait, didn't that happen already? And not that long ago, either. Is this what the movies are going to become, endless remakes, louder, splashier, with the same characters with the same story arc over and over and over and over...? When are we going to see the Matrix remake? And Rocky was a popular movie, let's remake that.

Hollywood, where have your new ideas gone?",1373328000,4,408,4.589041095890411
4416678,4,B004LWZWFQ,"I'll keep it short and sweet. One could debate endlessly about having a reboot so soon after the last live-action Spidey series ran its course, but it happened and it really shouldn't matter.

As far as the film itself, it's a good super hero film. Not as good as Ironman or Captain America (need one even mention The Avengers?), but it doesn't fall nearly as flat as other films have (Catwoman, Daredevil, etc...). It's well shot, the story and characters are interesting, and all of the roles are performed quite well. In fact, in terms of plot I would say that this film exceeds the original in terms of depth. Ma and Pa Parker are actually worked into the plot, connecting them to Kurt Connors and even Oscorp. And it even has some interesting threads to lead into future installments.

Other matters are more variable based on preferrence. Half the film is about Gwen Stacy and her relationship to Peter Parker. If you aren't a fan of High School romance, you won't like that half of the film. Also, rather than being a nerd, this Peter Parker is a skater boy (straight out of Avril Lavine's song), which may be a turn-off. Also, the web-shooters make their return and are even functionally worked into the plot (showing how adaptable Peter must be when they are rendered inert).

The only thing that was removed that I didn't care for personally was the famous line; ""with great power, comes great responsibility."" This phrase, typically uttered by Uncle Ben, is a corner stone for Peter's entire development as a character, and it is omitted from the film. Granted, Peter learns this lesson more or less on his own, but lacking the actual line, and the source from whence it comes, feels like a blow to the character. That could just be the fan-boy in me talking, but it's Spidey's slogan. It seemed like they were going to slip it in, in the end, but they didn't.

All-in-all, a good film, and a good Spidey film. If nothing else, it does look to be building on something much bigger. In the long run, I have no doubt that the new series will outshine the original.",1373328000,3,2073,4.579514824797844

4416723,4,B004LWZWFQ,"The beginning of the movie was rather slow, but this allows to get used to the ""new"" actor playing spider man. The mood is quite different from the previous trilogy. What stroke me is the realism of fight scenes. In this one you feel that fighting, jumping, flying, is physically rough.
Overall, the story was compelling, without being outstanding.
The DVD was great, particularly the bonuses, which show how most of the stunts were made. It is quite amazing to see that real actors made most of the stunts, rather than CGI. This explains the increased realism, compared to the previous trilogy.
I watched the movie with my 5-year old son, and he loved it. A few violent scenes (particulary in the final fight), one mild kiss, nothing shocking in my opinion, if you stand by your kid and explain the scary parts. Plus the bonus helped him understanding that all of this is not real. In a number of single DVDs today, you don't get bonuses like this.
Overall, a fun and pleasant movie, to watch with your family.",1372809600,2,1011,4.622222222222222

4416727,5,B004LWZWFQ,"I have to tell this: after watching this film by chance in my cable TV I was stunned. I knew the film when it was released and liked its ad campaign but didn't really wanted to watch another big screen adaptation so I let it go.
Now I have it in big esteem. It is a killer of the previous Tobey Macguire / Sam Raimi versions. And is the adaptation more bona fide ever made. It really made me remember the comics I was so in love in my childhood. Actually my love for comics was aroused by the Spider Man stories, my fathers didn't, and my school teacher for that matter, wanted me any closer to comic books so maybe that was the same reason why I loved it so much.
I deeply recommend it.",1372464000,,687,4.0588235294117645
4416728,5,B004LWZWFQ,"I really enjoyed the drama with peter parker and the people he loves and cares about. To me that was the best part of the comics was getting to see spiderman as a character interact. In my opinion the older spiderman was in a way one dimensional and the story line was focused more on ""wowing"" the audience with fights and special effects. It was a blockbuster. But this film feels more personal and down to earth. I also like that it feels like I'm watching a comic. I love the characters too. Andrew Garfield portrays a peter that feels authentic to me. He seems like an honest and good person who truly means well where as the old peter parker just ... to me it was like ""alright this is tobey mcguire playing peter parker"" but andrew really took the character on i feel. And his interaction with gwen.. also very authentic.

Okay here's a watered down of that paragraph. The amazing spider-man felt authentic to me. And that's something I really love.",1372377600,,955,4.488505747126437

Yes I understand they were trying to go for the more teenage style unrestrained cocky peter parker, but I just couldn't stand Andrew's acting. Really have more respect for what Toby was able to do. Special effects were nice but not blown away like I was in the original spiderman movie. There ail be 3 more movies coming out in the series with Andrew signed on, perhaps we'll see him step his game up and evolve both as Peter and the actor.",1372291200,3,593,4.4

4416768,3,B004LWZWFQ,"Wow, I've seen a re-boot a mere 10 years since the first Spider-man movie hit the theaters. Okay, so Tobet Maguire wasn't the most awesome Spider-man (it now seems like James Franco would have made a better bet, the way things have turned out... but at least he's not become as typecast as Maguire now is and lives to act again). This one tries different things - it doesn't make a big deal about Peter Parker being an outcast and a science geek, it just makes him a social outcast (the science geek is only hinted at). What it does differently is to allude to some story about Peter's parents, which was ignored for the first 40 years of Spider-man's history. It rushes right into ""someone close to Peter is told his secret identity"", again something that didn't happen ever. So it breaks a lot of taboos right off the bat. It also tells simple stories: Peter chases the Lizard, because it's some sort of game... he fights him, nearly dies, others do, no one is sure why... And why does the Lizard crave universal lizard-ness? We're never really convinced.

The plot is awful. Andrew Garfield is a bit too twitchy to be Peter Parker, his head too small, his lips too bloody, his teeth too grey... ditto for Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy. Bad things will happen. And yet, the story is pleasant, perhaps due to the CG, which really works! I liked it, probably for the first time ever.

The screenplay, for all of its limitations, also does its best to make the sequel self-evident - we need to meet Norman Osborn, we need to find out what happens to Uncle Ben's killer (does he, I don't know, become the possessor of the Cosmic Cube, or the recipient of the alien Spider-man suit/Venom/Carnage thingy?).We need to, I suppose, watch Gwen Stacy get thrown off the Brooklyn Bridge. And maybe we need to also meet another Mary Jane Watson.

Let's see what happens. I may not have liked the movie a lot, but my son did, my friend did, my wife did, all of the people I went to see it did, all of the people in the theatre liked it... hmmm...",1371859200,,2029,4.434316353887399

The plot was slow, several of the main characters from Spiderman weren't even IN this movie, and frankly I didn't find the relationship between what looked like two 15-year olds (Spiderman and Gwen) to be believable.

The Lizard was well done, hulking, fast and one of the better parts.  I still don't know why this particular franchise likes taking a well-known redhead/blonde and making them the other, even if that is their real hair color in the case of Ms. Stone.  Baffling.

4417237,4,B004LWZWFQ,"First of all, this ""review"" isn't directed at ""The Amazing Spider-man"", but the fact that i had to specify ""Amazing Spider-man"" so you wouldn't confuse this with just regular ""Spider-man"" (i.e Toby Maguire) is kinda my point. We all know that Spiderman (as a Marvel comics, Steve Ditko created entity) can now be traced back as the source to an almost infinite number of splintered ""re-boots"" (going back to the 70's TV series with Nicholas Hammond or the much loved original animated series).

Now as consumers we are partly to blame, after all, the studio's dangle the carrots in front of us and we take the bait EVERY time. That's where i put the other half of the responsibility, on the studios. We, as consumers, put a certain amount of trust in you, so that when you say ""Here's a NEW version of a movie you already own, but this is really worth buying it twice..."", we tend (or want) to believe you.

Obviously HD was a significant leap (the whole HD DVD vs Blu-ray battle), then came 3D (to me, the jury is still out on this one considering all the other equipment needed to enjoy a legitimate 3D experience), but now Sony is pushing this 4K line of re-releases. So pardon me for treading lightly, but can someone please ""sell me"" on the idea of why i should ""re-purchase"" many of my existing blu-rays based solely on the addition of the characters ""4K""???

I hope we're not already at the point where the studios simply rotate tacking on random adjectives like ""New, Super, Good, Improved, Ultra, Special-Edition"" to the title with minimal actual change to the subject matter just to pocket our ""double dip dollars""...i mean, i have to believe that there is (and will always be) some level of ""give and take"". So for every dollar the studio wants to ""take"", they will at least ""give"" me something for it.

I really, really want to believe this is the case. So will someone please give me the ""official"", market-savvy speech on why i can't live without the new line of ""4K"" blu rays? What does the 4K version give me that i didn't have before?",1366502400,3,2051,4.565217391304348

Usually but not always the remakes lack the originality and the following of the first. Well this version very much surpassed any previous versions and the character of Peter Parker (Spidie) is better rounded and his background that made the character is better told. The whole story seems better rounded and consistent with the magazine.

I appreciate the mix of actors some well known to many others well know to followers. Each made their character come alive.

I do not want to go into too much detail as the fun is anticipating the events. There are some of us that do not need to compare not seeing any original movies or magazines. So it is well worth a look.

There are several DVD and down load combinations of this presentation. If you have the opportunity to watch the extras they only add to the experience of the movie. I liked the voiceover commentary with Mark Webb.",1365984000,3,986,4.617142857142857

4417271,3,B004LWZWFQ,"was re - watching the amazing spider man last night, and it dawned on me..that i never reveiwed this one... so here i am with my 2 cents on it..

  like everybody, i was excited for spider-man 4 with maguire and company  back for another adventure ..but when the news was announced that they scrapped the film and then a few months later a ""reboot""  ""untold story"" or whatever you want to call it..was announced..it left a bad taste to lots of fans..myself included...

it was and STILL is  way too early to reboot the films..the only reason was probably to get a film into production fast to retain the rights to the character..or it would revert back to marvel.  personally, i was hoping the rights would have reverted  back to marvel ..can you imagine a spider-man film actually done by marvel studios?  that would be TRULY EPIC !!  but, i digress..the amazing spider-man was released, i saw it..kept an open mind..and ill say it has it moments.. but to me it was MISSING something...it didn't have that ""marvel feeling""  the sam raimi spider-man films were something special..you could feel it.. sure, a lot of people panned those films too...you cant have everything. with a beloved character like spider-man, everybody has an opinion .

  i always summed it up like this..the sam raimi film trilogy  was for the classic, die hard fans..where the new spidey film (or films,  since the second one is in production ) is geared to the ""ultimate"" marvel universe line..thats the 21st century take on the characters  for those who don't know.

sometimes, a reboot works...sometimes it dosent.  mostly for a reboot your pandering to a particular  group of viewers etc  such as teens, or the people that never read comics...i myself have been a die hard fan and im an  avid comic collector, so when i first saw this i was comparing it to  spider-man 1..and im sure many people were also.

 sure, both directors  took some creative liberties with the property as with all films based on this genre..  its to be expected  but for the amazing spider-man they went a bit extreme..such as ""reworking"" the death of uncle ben..sure, the essence was still there  but to me it didn't gel right.. uncle ben still gets shot and everything but it wasn't the same...now, take look at the sam raimi film..he did it right..  plus there wasn't the famous line that became peter's mantra ""with great power..comes great responsibility"" how you forget something that important??  instead, they cobbled up some lame dialogue..that never really worked . for the origin..you stick with what works.

speaking of the origin..if you read the ultimate spidey books  you know what im talking about there..peter was bitten by an altered spider blah  blah..which turns out to have been part of some  ""secret"" project run by oscorp and peter's parents were involved with that project also (hence the untold story angle) ..yep, we will see Norman osborn again at some point in the series..and you all know his alter ego will probably be back also:)  personally , i liked willem dafoes's norman osborn...but chris cooper is a great choice for the next film...you have to have a great actor for the villin..or it does not work.

we see peter..come to grips with his newfound powers...  hes still a nerd, but they made him emo..which for me it didn't work.. plus parker rides a skateboard?  give me a break.  but, i liked how they finally included  peter building real  web shooters this time around..i would have liked to have seen them in the raimi films though. like i said this one is a mixed bag..

the costume in this film, is hit or miss...some people like it some dont..i wasn't big on the new suit ..but after seeing it in action in this film it works..it looks homemade..and it fits with what they were trying to do...where in the other film it was more of a big budget looking suit that came out of nowhere...still, i prefer the raimi style suit..and the upcoming new film's suit from pics ive seen looks more like the raimi  style also..which is a huge plus.. it looks like they were actually paying attention this time around..sometimes, you don't mess with a classic !

  we finally get to see the lizard  (aka dr, curt connors)  in action.  for me this was the saving grace of this film  since we have been teased about the lizard since spidey 1.. and the lizard was always one of my favorite bad guys ..  they did a great job on the make up as well as the cg effects..sure people griped about it..again, you cant make everybody happy.

  also, no J Jonah jameson? wtf  that was a big mistake too..hopefully he will be in the next one..he has to be, because he was important in the early days of spideys crime fighting career with causing the whole spider-man hero or menace? theme with the daily bugle..plus he was peters first boss.. j.k. simmons needs to be called back to reprise the role..because NOBODY could do the character justice like he did !

the cast here is a mixed bag..dennis leary as capt stacey didn't work for me(kept thinking of his ""lock and load"" comedy special the whole time:) ..somebody a bit older should have been cast in that role..emma stone was wonderful as gwen stacey.  martin sheen was a great uncle ben.. i liked his version better than cliff robertson's...sally field as aunt may..didnt work to me  she looked too young and dare i say hot.. and wasn't believeable in the role to me...rosemary harris did a excellent job as aunt may and  should have been asked to reprise the role..

  andrew garfield's spider-man/peter parker  was too twitchy at times...sure, he has his moments  but to me they really should have casted somebody  better...im not saying he was bad in the role..but he didn't scream parker to me.. you couldn't  relate with him.. tobey magure, on the hand nailed the role perfectly.. plus that hair on garfield needs to be cut..pronto! chop chop!  today!

the darker tone to this film actually works on some levels and was welcomed .. you knew what they were going for in this one..and if u noticed  spidey only ventured out at night..they kept that urban vigilante vibe that worked well in the early books..and later in the film  he starts to gain some respect and  is on the way to becoming a true a hero..that uncle ben  would have been  proud of...

I didn't need the series to be rebooted, but I wasn't all up in arms about it either. The previews didn't look all that great, so I waited to rent the movie and kept my expectations low. And it still underwhelmed.

The CGI is not good, the acting is average at best, and the ""jokes"" are terrible. Not at all what I want from the wise-cracking Spider-Man. Spolier Alert: The funniest part is when Uncle Ben is shot. I laughed out loud for that scene.

What hurts the most is the extremely slow pace for a comic-book movie. It really feels like an MTV production, like a stretched out teenage TV series instead of a blockbuster movie. Long stretches of time are spent on Peter Parker's skateboarding moves and his issues asking out Gwen Stacy. ""MTV's True Life: I'm a Spider-Man!""

Yet praise Andrew Garfield for the same thing, having seen this movie I can honestly say that this movie isn't that good. Andrew Garfield only has two expressions in this movie, a goofy smile. Or him just sitting there brooding, Martin Sheen is terrible as Uncle Ben. Salley Field as Aunt May is also unused. Even Uncle Ben's death is stupid, Peter doesn't have enough money to buy milk from a convience store. And since the clerk is a jerk, and won't let him use a penny from the penny slot next to the register. Peter gets mad, and just as he walks away, the store gets held up by the guy behind peter. And he hands Peter the milk that he tried to buy, Peter accepts it and walks out the door. The clerk runs after the thief, and asks Peter why he didn't help. Peter tells him ""It's not my policy"", then literally as if to give Peter a reason to be Spider-Man. The same thief runs into Uncle Ben,A scuffle. And Uncle Ben dies, and magically Peter cares about people. The movie was very brooding, unlike Spider-Man. Even the reason for the doc turning into the Lizard and going crazy was out of place, Peter's parents weren't developed enough for me to care about them. Andrew Garfield cannot act, Emma Stone did her best as Gwen Stacey. Buuuut when you allow a visitor to tour your employer's labs while wearing a name badge that clearly is not them, And said person can perfectly mimic the code that the person that Peter watched put the same code in.

4417376,4,B004LWZWFQ,"There was a lot of automatic backlash when it was announced that after three Sam Raimi movies, the franchise was being completely rebooted.

But to be honest, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a pretty solid reboot -- while not as necessary as the ""Incredible Hulk"" reboot was, it's a thoroughly solid little superhero movie that is pretty enjoyable when seen just for itself. It's gritty and has some dark moments, but it also has a lot of wisecracking wit and a new Spiderman who fits the bill perfectly.

Peter Parker was left with his Aunt May (Sally Field) and Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen), while his parents fled for parts unknown. Then they were killed in a plane crash.

Years later, Peter (Andrew Garfield) finds a battered briefcase with a bunch of his father's old papers. Wanting to find out more about his dad's research, he sneaks into Oscorp Tower to find his father's old buddy, Dr. Connors (Rhys Ifans). But while he's there, he accidentally wanders into a room of glowing spiders -- and one of them bites him. Within hours, he's gained super-strength, amazing reflexes, and the ability to cling to any surface he touches.

But then Uncle Ben is murdered after a squabble with his nephew, and a distraught Peter begins hunting down all criminals who resemble the killer. He even creates a ""luge"" costume and mask to hide his identity. At the same time, Dr. Connors puts his research to work -- and becomes a monstrous reptilian creature determined to make all the people in the city like him...

First, a warning: ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is not really the same story as Sam Raimi's ""Spiderman"" -- the basic bitten-by-radioactive-spider thing is the same, but the circumstances, plot and villain are all vastly different. Even the love interest is vastly different. Mary Jane is nowhere to be seen in this story; it's all about Gwen Stacy.

And the simplicity of having the Lizard as a villain allows more time to explore the ""early days"" of Spiderman. We get to see how Peter practices swinging around in an abandoned warehouse, the origin of his mask and his ""luge"" suit, how he built his webshooters, and even his webslinging goes from awkward and panicked to downright polished by the end.

And the writing is pretty entertaining -- lots of web-slinging action, some nice romantic tension with Gwen (and plain ol' tension with her father), and some good fight scenes. But there's also lots of funny stuff as well -- Peter gets in a lot of wisecracks (""Nobody seems to grasp the point of the mask!"") and scenarios (Stan Lee's cameo).

The biggest problem is a scene -- complete with inspiring music -- where ALL the construction workers help a wounded Spiderman by lining cranes up for him. The cheese in that scene is so thick, it smells of Camembert.

It also has some lovely characterization on all fronts. Andrew Garfield is wonderful as Peter -- he looks geeky and weedy, but still with the wiry look of a fighter and the sensibilities of a teen boy (""CROOOOTTCH!""). And he plays some of the more comedic scenes with just the right amount of humor (such as when Peter ACCIDENTALLY beats up a bunch of thugs on a subway).

The rest of the cast is also quite good -- Ifans plays Connors as a tragic man obsessed with his lost arm, and driven half to madness by the serum. He's a totally plausible villain, yet there are moments where you pity him. And they flesh out all the supporting characters nicely, from Chief Stacy (who becomes overly obsessed with catching Spiderman to the exclusion of, oh, I dunno... THE GIANT KILLER LIZARD) to Flash, a bully who begins to change his ways when Peter shows him up.

""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a solid reimagining of the Spiderman origin story -- it's gritty, solid, and shows a believable transition into superherodom. On to the second movie!",1364688000,2,3800,4.7250755287009065

I found myself wanting to find something, anything that I liked about it so I would not give it a 1 star review but alas I found really nothing of redeeming value. It takes more then crispy CGI to impress me. At one point the CGI becomes such that you are thinking you are watching a intro to a video game.

Disappointed in:
The main actor-  While he looks like he could play a good nerdy role, his inner persona seems to reach the surface more,  so this spider-man comes off as arrogant,disrespectful to his aunt and uncle,(even his aunt after his uncle dies)and not very likable as a person either as Peter Parker or as Spiderman. All in all it seems like the rest of the characters give pretty card board performances in this movie. Dennis Leary played himself so that doesn't really count.

Spidey is not with Mary Jane and she is no where in this film but Spidey and the police chief daughter strike up ""insta love"" totally  not believable love that is unmoving. They have zero chemistry.

The scene between Flash and Peter Parker where Flash beats up Peter Parker was over done and  Flash really never gets his 'come uppance'. They they try to all of a sudden turn Flash in to Peters friend where he tries to console him??? Yeah that is really believable. Sigh.

I do have to say that Ryhs (sp?) actor that portrayed Lizardman, did the best job in this movie when he was not a Lizard. Sally Field and Martin Sheen's immense talents were  utterly wasted and what a shame because they are some awesome actors.",1364342400,6,1565,4.463157894736842

4417479,2,B004LWZWFQ,"I have no problem with a remake this soon. I loved the other films, but was definitely interested in an alternative version. Classics like Robin Hood, Snow White, and of course Batman have been told again and again. Spider-Man is an epic and I love the comic storyline about Gwen. That said, this movie was an assembly line disappointment. I ll give you seven reasons not to buy this.

1. Lack of character depth: In the comics, Curt Connors AKA ""The Lizard"" had a family he cared about. He feared becoming the lizard because he could hurt them. He was a good guy. This movie villain was cut and dry. He wanted his arm back and was doing his job. I could relate to the other movie villains in the last trilogy. Doc Ock anyone?
2. Never said ""With great power, there must come great responsibility."" Instead this Ben tried to reword to sound different. Also, Martin Sheen had more screen time than the previous Ben, but I cared even less for him.
3. Pete: I liked the scientific aspect of this Peter. That said, he was too well dressed, too good at so many things (skateboarding?), and too appealing to be nerdy Parker. I see you, movie studio, trying to bring the young female teenagers into the theator. This isn't Twilight.
4. Swears: Peter used the phrase: ""mother hugger."" What?
5. Ticking time bomb and detailed animations showing the villans plan: these are really old, overused writing tools. I don't need to see a timer. The villain didn't spend a month designing an animation of his evil plan, and then decided to leave it on loop for everyone to find.
6. Aunt May: Not nearly as charming as the previous. Underused.
7. Too Afraid to be like the old movie: if you think people already know the story, don't slightly change it!! Skip over some of it. If you are going to redo the origin, make sure it is better than a grocery robbery!!!

I didn't buy this movie. I will watch the second film as I know how the Gwen story plays out. I hope 2 is better!!!",1363651200,,1961,4.444444444444445

While finding Dr. Curtis Connors on a field trip Peter gets bit by a radio-active spider. On his way home he discovers his powers on a train, and it is funny!

When peter gets home hungry enough to eat meat-loaf Aunt May realizes something is wrong. After Uncle Ben dies Peter Parker decides to fight crime with his spider-like abilities!

The costume design in this movie is spectacular! Nothing ripped except when the Lizard scratched Spiderman and that just makes him look better!

I loved the music. My 2 favorite scenes with music were 1. when Spidey was about to jump off of a building and jump from building to building throughout the city and 2. when he wakes up and was ""trying"" to brush his teeth.

Overall I loved the movie, but I don't think its good for kids under 8 because Lizard is kind of scary, (NOT FOR ME!!!!! I'm fine!)my Mom liked it and she is NOT a Spidery-mom, anyway yes, also when Uncle Ben dies it is a sad scene especially if your sensitive about a loved one.

Anyhow, great movie as movies go (I'm not really big on movies, books are my thing).",1362787200,2,534,4.333333333333333

4417623,5,B004LWZWFQ,"It may seem crazy, but I believe 3D is best in movies like this one.  Where better to see 3D imagery than with action heroes?  As well, although it may seem early for a completely new rework of the Spidey franchise after TM's protrayal, this one has some interesting twists.  It cannot be seen as conintuing or fillingin the previous trilogy, as too much difference has been incorporated into the storyline.  For example, this version returns to the pre-Maryjane HS experience of the comic book.  Better than the previous trilogy?  Well, that depends on too much personal considerations.  If you enjoyed Toby as Spidey, this version may seem flat in comparison.  But that isn;t the way to look at this.  It is a totally new interpretation of the story and holds up very well as that.  And it's in 3D!  The motions of Spiderman seem most perfectly adaptable to 3D imagery.",1362528000,,871,4.701986754966887

At least his underwear shows above his pants so he must be stylin'.  And he gets in alot of fights, so he must be cool.

A horribly written version of Spiderman that couldn't be saved with okay acting.  If you haven't read Spiderman comics EVER you might think it's okay.  If you're a comic fan, just skip this one.

4417630,5,B004LWZWFQ,"Well as a golden age comic fan and growing up reading the original spider man comics as a boy I was happy to see the first spider man movie hit the screens but I had a couple problems with it but overall a great portrayal of the superhero Spider-Man and loved old Toby in them, even liked the third one even though it could have been better... Fast forward to The Amazing Spider-Man and its 2013 and I waited until now to finally watch it because I didn't see the need to go back to Spider-Man's beginning story and the first movie had a better portrayed uncle Bens death story.. But it wasn't too big a difference to lower my opinion of The Amazing Spider-Man but the one thing above all else they got right the Toby movies didn't was that Spider-Man did not hoot webs from within his arms and the who,e thing with the two fingered pressed into the palms thing had a reason which is that Peter Parker made web shooting gadgets that used capsules and a pressure plate under his gloves to activate the shooting of the webs and this movie definitely got that right and is more accurate to true Spider-Man origins and his powers so great job on that but I also love the way the web capsules were explained in the movie as several hundred yards could be contained in a small capsule and that was greatly explained in this movie as well... Now that I watched it I'm going too order the four disc set as it definitely has a place in our massive DVD/BluRay collection of over 1500 titles and I just ordered a brand new 3D LED/LCD TV in a 50"" inch size so the TV will be here the day before the 3D combo set gets here so ill get back to you on the 3D version and now I am hoping they do make a sequel to the Amazing Spider-Man and if there is we won't wait until later to buy and watch it because we very much enjoyed this reselling of a classic super hero character, we still love the original movies too and they are each great in their own right",1362268800,,1940,4.176

4417692,5,B004LWZWFQ,"While I might give the movie itself 3.5 or 4 stars, I thought that since I'm reviewing the 3D version, specifically, I'd take that into account. This movie was shot in 3D, and not converted in post production, like most others, and it really shows on a 3D tv. The realism the depth creates is unmatched by most 3D films, and the quality is quite stunning... as if your TV is merely a window, and you are viewing things in real life.",1362268800,,432,4.280487804878049

This reboot doesn't really bring anything new to the table.  Yes, the special effects are great and the 3D works well, but the previous trilogy still looks great, too.  I have to admit that after seeing the trailers for this, I wasn't terribly excited to see it.  They highlighted a lot of the corny humor from the movie and it didn't bode well to me.  It turned out to be slightly better than I was expecting, but still rather forgettable.  I didn't care much for the characters, especially the villain, which doesn't even really come across as a villain - just some monster that Spiderman has to take care of on his way to figuring out who he is.

First off, Andrew Garfield is a much better Parker/Spider-man than Tobey was IMO. I just felt the Raimi trilogy were too campy for my taste. I really prefer this movies darker tone and found myself drawn in more. Andrew and Emma's chemistry is really convincing in the movie. It had great action, emotion and also some humor. I liked that a new villain was used that we haven't seen before. A great adaptation and will watch this movie a few more times for sure.

Normally i don't write negative review's but felt compelled for this one, it's highly overrated in it's own rights. Now for the review and why i gave it such a low rating this movie had nothing original to offer to the audience in terms of production, poor script and just an overall a bad effect i.e 3d effects with 'HD' properties and a terrible action sequence.
I don't know why they decided to film this movie with such a dark mood and kinda give off this 'Dark Knight' image crap which wasn't necessarily needed but done regardless. Upon watching this movie it also feels like deja vu like this movie has already been seen and done with a few mistakes in this 2012 release it seems that dr. kurt conners owns and works at oscorp which wasn't really explained and later then has no alterable motive to hate peter when later turned into the lizard this movie all round is just stupid and trying yet again to cash in the big bucks without putting out any real quality and ironically i heard this movie along with the awful nolan batman movies will all be rebooted again in 2013 somewhere, no surprise there this movie is trash at it's finest",1361491200,3,1506,4.3250883392226145

  The movie begins with Peter Parker as a boy (Max Charles). He is playing hide & seek with his dad, Richard (Campbell Scott). When Peter looks for his father in his home office, it is a mess. Someone has broken into the house. He calls out for his dad. Richard looks for his top secret file and erases a formula on the chalk board. The family must leave town immediately. They decide to let Peter live with Aunt Mary (Sally Field) and Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) where he will be safe.
  Now a teenager in high school, Peter (Andrew Garfield) has to deal with a bully, Flash (Chris Zylka), who fights and kicks him in the privates while trying to help a smaller student Flash has grabbed a hold of.
 Later, in his Uncle's attic, he finds a leather satchel that belonged to his father. His parents died in a plane crash. Inside the satchel are secrets of cross-species genetics and a picture of his father with Dr. Curt Conners (Rhys Ifans) at OSCORP, his father's work place.
 So Peter goes to the OSCORP building and poses as an intern. He meets Dr. Conners and also discovers a room full of multiple spiders. Some of the spiders fall on him. Later, he is bitten by one of them.
  On the subway, he transforms with very acute senses, powers and strength.

Spider-Man's most tenacious foe, the Lizard, set the stage for a rollercoaster ride of action. Special effects, cgi, stunts, 3d, and editing are all top notch here. The cast was ideally balanced-all top notch too. Best Spider-Man movie so far. It's a keeper!",1360800000,,678,4.803418803418803
4417941,3,B004LWZWFQ,"I have to grade this as a 3D movie.  I am new to 3D, perhaps having seen 9 previous 3D movies.  I kept taking off my 3D glasses to see if it was really 3D!

Yes, it appeared 3D in many scenes and almost invisible in others.  At the very end, it is as if the producer thought:  ""Gosh, I forgot this was a 3D movie!"" Then some eye catching 3D scenes were tossed in, within the last 20 seconds!

This is a movie just screaming for 3D!  Spider web material shooting towards the screen (used once and stopped short) cars being tossed towards the screen, etc.  If I didn't want eye catching 3D effects, I would have bought the 2D version.  The 3 stars, that I did give, was for the story plot.  Not for the 3D.  I'm disappointed.",1360713600,2,723,4.0928571428571425
4417942,4,B004LWZWFQ,"My whole family enjoyed this movie immensely.  I think it's the best movie version of SpiderMan so far.  I look forward to future installments from this particular cast & director.

IMO, the casting for this movie is spot on.  I never liked the previous actor choice for SpiderMan, which turned me off on the whole thing.  The computer graphics effects were much better than I expected and they blended very well with the story.

Also, the SpiderMan / Peter Parker character is depicted as much more human than in any other superhero film I've seen.  I enjoyed this aspect of the storyline - I hate it when characters behave a certain -stupid- way to be true to the comic book or whatever.  In making movies, you need the characters to win the audience or no one will care about the story.  I think they did a great job with this while still respecting the SpiderMan backstory.

Highly recommended.",1360713600,3,898,4.6265822784810124

4417971,1,B004LWZWFQ,"A new look at the origins of Spider-man, or so the summary of this movie claimed.

I felt the pacing of this movie to be slow, and it seemed to me that the storyline was borrowed from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spider-Man/dp/B000O19EWK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spider-Man</a>&nbsp;with a few ideas borrowed from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spider-Man-2/dp/0345470540/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spider-Man 2</a>.  The scene in the movie where Uncle Ben is murdered, I felt that was taken directly from the first Spider-man movie that Tobey Maguire did.  And the villian being misguided reminded me of Doc Ock in Spider-man 2.

My other big issue with the movie was that I am so used to Peter Parker's girlfriend is Mary Jane, but in the movie, they had her be a girl named Gwen.

While I can appreciate that the makers of the film were trying to do something new and fresh with the storyline, I just don't think it worked with this film.",1360454400,,1033,5.906040268456376

4417979,4,B004LWZWFQ,Perfect super hero movie - I liked it better than the other 3 from the early 2000s spider man series.  The character development on Peter Parker is more believable and they spend more time investing in him as a person.  Emma Stone kills it as Gwen Stacy.,1360281600,3,254,4.382978723404255
4417980,5,B004LWZWFQ,"One thing I wish about Spider-Man: that Sony would release the contract to Marvel Studios so Spidey can be in the Avengers where he belongs. But until that glorious day, Spidey will be forced to live on the silver screen all alone with a set of villains that have yet to be in the movies. Sure, I think I read that The Rhino will be in the next one, which is great since Rhino is one of the classics that, until modern CGI technology, couldn't really be done the right way.

The previous three films by Sam Raimi were amazing...well, the first two were amazing, but not number three. Ick, not number three. I mean, Topher Grace as Eddie Brock? Did they even read the comic books? Come on Sam, no wonder there was a needed reboot just a few years later. And why throw in the Sandman AND Green Goblin's son back into the mix? It was too much, and therefore nothing was done to the fullest. In my opinion, they should've just stuck to the Venom suit and cast someone much more comic-book-related as Eddie Brock...someone with a more sinister voice.

OK, this is just a ranting history lesson leading up to the real review of the reboot. I LOVED this film for many, many reasons. First, the casting was much more well-done. Andrew Garfield plays a much more believable Peter Parker (lankier, goofier, and much more natural on-screen as a nerd than Toby MacGuire). And they didn't include Mary Jane! They started much earlier in Spider-Man's history by giving us Emma Stone as Gwen Stacey. Much, much better in terms of true storyline adherence. In short, the acting was much, much better and tighter for another reboot, which was risky to begin with in my opinion.

The best part of the film, was that they never ""buffed"" Andrew up when he was in the suit. The suit was loose, wrinkly, and he still looked like the little skinny guy that he truly is when Peter Parker. It was awesome that they didn't make Peter some ripped-up muscle-bound hero after the spider bite. Yes, they gave him the necessary augmentations like vision, spider sense, sticky hands and feet, dexterity, etc., but they didn't buff him. I don't know, for someone who's a Spider-Man purist like me, I thought this was a well-thought-out execution of the character. He looks feeble, even in the suit, and that really helped me root for the underdog even more. The Lizard, played by Rhys Ifans, was massive compared to our Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man, which made the fights look awesome.

Regarding character development, the storyline differences between Raimi's first film and this one aren't very big. Uncle Ben is still killed ""accidentally"" by a rogue criminal that Peter arrogantly lets go to ""get even"" with some minor injustice. The ""with great power comes great responsibility"" mantra is still intact, and it's a good lesson to learn...and painful in most instances. But Peter's scientific side is much, much more developed in this film because his webbing isn't organically engineered from his own body (as in Raimi's depiction). As in the comic books, Peter is a scientific genius, and develops his own webbing and shooters. Oscorp as a military industrial complex is also much more developed, though we never see hide nor hair of Norman or his son in this film.

In summary, I think this reboot of my favorite comic book character of all time is well-done, surpassing - in my humble opinion - that of Raimi's vision. Marc Webb (really...Webb?) did a great job directing and the on-screen outcome is nothing short of brilliant. I'm very excited for the next installment.",1360281600,3,3550,4.747163695299838

I went into this reboot with an open mind after loving Sam Raimi's first two and feeling a little cheated on the third film.

I enjoyed this film (pretty much enjoy every Superhero movie) and would recommend it. However I do feel that it was alittle forced. The issue with the movie is that its an origin story when we already have one to go off of from not too long ago and they have to try and avoid some of the memorable parts from the original/comic books. Such as Uncle Ben's iconic ""With great power ....."" line.

Overall it is a good movie but not great. I do believe the sequel to this will hold up very well and the director/writers will be able to take the next one places that they couldn't with the first one.",1360195200,2,874,4.196428571428571

The special effects are a definite upgrade from the previous Spidey films; also the new actors are just right for their respective roles as Peter Parker and Gwen Stacey.  Having Martin Sheen and Sally Field was also a classy touch of good casting.

Also liked some of the point-of-view shots of Spider-Man as he moves through the city- very realistic feel.

4418193,2,B004LWZWFQ,"SPOILERS, kind of, but not really, because if you've ever seen a superhero movie or an action movie or really any Hollywood movie, none of this will surprise you. So, there's this kid Peter, and one day his dad and mom disappear forever because somebody rifled through their papers. (We never find out why, but later a newspaper briefly flashes on the screen with something about a plane crash.) And the kid grows up to be a science genius. And there's a room full of super genetically engineered spiders in a building somewhere, and they were his parents' spiders, and somehow in 15 years they've never bitten anybody before, they've just been sitting in this room for some reason, and then the science genius kid gets bitten by one, and within 20 minutes he's clinging to ceilings and beating up hoodlums on the subway, but kind of by accident, because he's not really a badass yet. And stuff sticks to his hands so bad that he rips off somebody's shirt and you see her bra, but then other times stuff doesn't stick to his hands, and then other times stuff sticks to his hands only when he wants it to. Also, he's super strong and he totally trashes the bathroom by accident, and his aunt is very understanding because she never asks him why he destroyed the bathroom and left the water shooting out of the broken sink and just left the house without calling a plumber or anything. And then he gives the secret formula that he found in his dad's notebook to this other scientist guy who was his dad's friend, and works at the place with the spider room. Also, the word algorithm. And the other science guy decides to use the formula to grow back his arm, and it totally works in like 3 hours, but also he turns into a big green lizard guy, which is odd because when the kid got bitten, he didn't change to actually resemble a spider, but OK, whatever. Also, the genetic alterations are temporary for the lizard guy, which is odd because they're permanent for the spider-guy. Also the serum that turns you into a lizard is green, which I guess makes sense because lizards are green. Also, the lizard guy turns evil in the span of 10 minutes even though he's just a dedicated scientist who wants to help people and get his arm back. Also, Denis Leary sneers a lot. Also, the girl's bangs are kind of weird and she falls in love with the spider kid for some reason? Also, there was this machine that the scientist guy told the kid about at the beginning, and it is used to spread a cloud of gas around a whole city, and then it's like, ""OK, enough about that for now, but I wonder if we'll hear more about it later,"" and then later, shockingly, the bad guy decides to use it to spread the green lizard serum over the whole city for some reason, I guess because ""humans are weak,"" even though nothing really happened to that character in the movie to lead him to that conclusion. (Although since the serum is apparently temporary and needs booster shots, the whole city would turn to lizard people for a while but then go back to normal, so it would really suck for only 12 hours or so, right?) Also I forgot to mention that the science genius kid makes these amazing web-shooting things for his wrists, using spare wristwatch parts and impossibly compact/impossibly strong cable that coincidentally looks and behaves just like spider webs. Also, it only takes him like 2 hours to invent and build these. Also he's an awesome fashion designer and makes his own perfect costume in like 10 minutes in his room. This kid is talented! Also the lizard guy sets up this huge sophisticated lab in the sewer with computers and big oxygen tanks and thousands of pounds of equipment, and it only took him like 12 hours, and apparently nobody in this city of 10 million people noticed a one-armed guy lugging thousands of pounds of science equipment into the sewer, and also it's very well-lit in the sewer and none of your stuff gets dirty. Also, if you're a brilliant fancy science guy, all computers talk to you and tell you what they're doing, and they always have a soothing female voice. And then there is some fighting, totally cool spider vs. lizard fighting, and NATCH they put the antidote into the gas-dispersing machine instead! It's a good thing that the 17-year-old girl who is a tour guide at the evil scientist guy's company knows how to synthesize an antidote for lizard-DNA-altering gas in like 8 minutes! Wow, the world is saved, except Denis Leary.",1359763200,,4455,4.54228855721393

4418262,3,B004LWZWFQ,"I remember reading this story in a comic book along time ago. It all came back to me as I watched this movie for the first time. I truly believe that the release of this movie was too close to the Trilogy Spiderman Franchise. Having said that I liked the movie but the CGI is taking over the world. Alternate realities are one thing but constant alternate realities in movies is making my behind tired. The Spiderman character was okay, he lacks depth as did every actor they propped up for The Amazing Spiderman. Oh, and by the way how many times do we need to see Stan Lee? I mean seriously folks. Wassup with this stuff!! The Lizard OMG, that was funny. So to Marvel I say This ""Cmon Man"".",1359504000,,692,4.290076335877862
4418263,5,B004LWZWFQ,"Great movie!!!! Absolutely love it. Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield play amazing roles. I personally prefer it over the original Spider-Man movies, but that's just me.",1359504000,,166,5.423076923076923
4418264,4,B004LWZWFQ,"The one thing that will surprise many people about the new spider-man movie, finally titled the Amazing Spider-man, is how refreshing and original it actually is. After only a decade, the filmmakers have rebooted the franchise and started anew once again telling the origins of spidey, however, the ground covered is not as much of a rehashing as one might have expected from all too often creatively bankrupt Hollywood movie system.

Once again telling how mild mannered, somewhat nerdy Peter Parker became the web slinger Spider-man. With a newly designed suit that looks great in 3-D, he no longer shoots webs organically, but uses a web shooter like in the old comic books. This will surely please fan boys and girls everywhere.

Peter is still a high school student, but academics take a backseat when the greater responsibility of superhero arrives. Taking on the Lizard, a.k.a Dr.  Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans), his father's former partner turned kaju inspired CGI monster. Romancing Gwen Stacey (Emma Stone), Peter's first love from the comics, dodging her suspicious father, police Lt. George Stacey (Denis Leary). And looking out for dear old Aunt May (Sally Field), now that Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) has been gunned down by a mugger. The story may seem familiar, but it's execution is welcome.

Now played by Andrew Garfield, last seen as Eduardo Saverin in last year's excellent the Social Network, who brings a good amount of charisma to the role allowing us to easily forget the banal Tobey Maguire.  Emma Stone is a good choice for the role of Gwen Stacey, with her big eyes and (natural) blonde locks. Both actors are too old for the roles, however, I am reminded of the mileage that 21 Jump Street got earlier this year kidding casting of actors too old as high schoolers. British comedian Rhys Ifans, best known for playing Hugh Grant's slobbish flat mate in Notting Hill, is a surprising choice for the villainous role, but lately he's been leaving the shaggy hair-do at home and developing his skills to be a first rate character actor. Denis Leary, hot off his long running TV series ""Rescue Me"" and voicing the Ice Age movies, makes his big screen return after a decade. Making the role of George Stacey all his own, adding his usual and much loved comic shtick, but still finding the character within, this is one of Leary's best performances. Martin Sheen is an agreeable replacement for the late Cliff Robertson in the role of Uncle Ben. While Sally Field is an inspired choice for Aunt May, she's sweet and pleasant, not as gaudy and school mar mish as Rosemary Harris in earlier Spider-man movies.

Directed by Marc Webb, a music video director with only one film to his name, the truly superb (500) Days of Summer, Webb may lack Sam Raimi's over all attention grabbing style, but he has a very good sense of storytelling and like Raimi puts a strong emphasis on character. Working from a first rate script by James Vanderbit, Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves, the tone is lighter and more pleasant allowing the viewer to see just how overly serious and often pretentious the Raimi pictures could be.

Well staged and greatly filmed action scenes highlight the movie, after seeing the rather ho-hum action involved in the Dark Knight Rises, this comes as a welcome alternative. The CGI is at times over dominating, and the Lizard is a little hard on the eyes for most of his screen time. Still, this is one of the most fun and easily endearing superhero movies of recent years. The spider-man movies still remain a high water mark for the ever increasingly crowded genre.

4418267,5,B004LWZWFQ,"I thought this was a good story, as opposed to the other 3 Spiderman movies, which tended to get a little too much like a comic book.  Marvel has done a good job with the franchises of Ironman, Spiderman, and taken some inspiration from the last 3 Batman movies, making them less 'campy' and better pictures.",1359331200,,308,4.5

4418312,4,B004LWZWFQ,"As an avid reader of The Amazing Spider-Man series I was pleasantly surprised how the movie adapted it's concepts to film. A lot of the main aspects of the story remain genuine and Dr. Connors was excellently portrayed as the villain, despite The Lizard's face looking so badly animated. While some aspects still annoy me, like how Peter Parker intends to keep his identity a secret with so many mistakes, are minor compared to the overall film. The action was well-done and the story remained true to the lore while creating it's own rendition of this beloved hero. I'm sure hardcore fans will be displeased with it, but those seeking an enjoyable Spider-Man film will be satisfied.",1359244800,2,683,4.846153846153846
4418313,4,B004LWZWFQ,"The Amazing Spider-Man is a reboot of the Spider-Man film series that essentially tells the same story with different characters. Peter Parker is a social outcast in high school, he's bitten by a radioactive spider, he gains superpowers, he gets the girl, and he fights the villain he's partly responsible for. (a basic summary of the movie, but it'll do). The Amazing Spider-Man is a surprisingly fun and thrilling reboot of the beloved franchise.

As I previously mentioned, the story doesn't really trek into unfamiliar territory. Fortunately, I personally enjoy the Spider-Man origin story and didn't mind watching it again; it's a story that's fun and feels relatable, in my opinion. The action in this film is thrilling, from the actual fight scenes to the adrenaline-filled web swinging; there's also a bit of comedy and romance spread throughout the film, without losing focus. I also enjoyed the style in this film; the special effects felt unique/distinct and brought some variety to the superhero genre, whereas most recent superhero films seem to be leaning towards the dark and gritty tone (not a bad thing). The design of the Lizard was decent, but ultimately underwhelming. I was originally very skeptical over the reboot of this franchise, so my expectations were admittedly low; the film did impress and entertain me, though, and I can't deny that.

Overall, I really enjoyed The Amazing Spider-Man- it's a truly amazing action film. The lack of innovation and the underwhelming villain design are the only reasons I gave this 4-stars instead of 5 (although I was close to doing so.) I recommend a purchase for fans of superhero and action films, a rental for those that oppose reboots/remakes or are a bit skeptical.

The two reasons I could not give this 4 or even 5 stars was 1.) It was WAY to dark. The majority of the movie is at night with very few daytime scenes. This makes things difficult to follow. This also helps the CGI crew make terrible graphics since you won't notice. Good way to cut budget, but it takes a lot away from the movie and spiderman's story.  2.) I do not enjoy first person scenes. Unfortunately, I get sick/dizzy from it. Not a big issue, but still important. I wish directors would stop thinking that it is artistic.

4418348,1,B004LWZWFQ,I enjoy the spiderman tale and stories.  The first three movies were amazing even though they didn't follow the comics.  This movie follows the comic fairly closely but I did not enjoy it.  For starters all the characters were changed.  Some were better than others.  Then they went back to the beginning of the story instead of advancing it.  I usually don't fall asleep during super hero movies but this one I did.  I suggest renting it before buying it.,1358899200,3,456,4.625

4418372,5,B004LWZWFQ,Garfield's Peter Parker and Stone's Stacy makes the perfectly imperfect pair of lovers in a world of psycho lizards and suffering. This movie and its expected sequel will surely impact the way we think about Spider-Man.,1358899200,,219,5.111111111111111
4418373,2,B004LWZWFQ,"I miss the old Peter Parker, from the old comics.  The one who was actually a nice guy.  The one who acted like a jerk for just one panel of his origin story, and then spent the rest of his life doing good.  The one who had a tough life, but who was too busy worrying about others to wallow in self pity.  That guy was pleasant company.  And if I can't have him, I'll take Toby McGuire.

Just once, I'd like to see a Spiderman movie where Peter keeps his mask on and does not reveal his secret identity, and/or show off his superpowers, to everyone he meets and her dad too.  But of course, he must get this credit and applause, because it really is all about him.

Just once, I'd like to see a superhero movie, where the film-makers do not need to resort to the cheap ploy of threatening an entire city with destruction (which we know ain't going to happen).  Why are not the lives of individual human beings enough of a threat to sustain our interest and sustain a movie?  The answer, as before, is that Spiderman must get credit and applause for saving an entire city, because it really is all about him.  Boo hiss!",1358812800,22,1118,4.226415094339623

4418498,3,B004LWZWFQ,"I'm a huge Spiderman comic book fan but hated the first three Spiderman movies. I mean HATED them. The Sam Raimi films got nearly everything miserably wrong. From the casting to the costumes to the most basic plot points and themes that were already freakin' written for them, the first trilogy was grossly lacking in any sort of real thrills, either emotionally or visually.

So when the news came that they were rebooting the franchise I was hopeful. You couldn't do any worse I thought. Well, guess again. For whatever reason, the minds at Sony and Marvel can't make a Spiderman movie that soars. Yes, they clunkily adhere to the story and hit the marks but like bad singers and dancers, the rhythm is way off.  This new movie makes the same mistakes as the Raimi versions only worse. Thought the origin was muddled in the 1st Spiderman movie? (It's about hubris, you morons!) It's made even muddier in the reboot. Over-produced costume that no way in heck any teenager cold make by himself? YUP. Spiderman throwing off his mask or displaying his Spider powers to anyone who will notice?  It's on full display in the reboot. A completely under-motivated villain and boring plot? Check! Nonsense logic that confuses how strong or weak Spiderman may be or Spiderman's abilities are only defined as the scene requires? Check.

So why did I buy a movie that I didn't exactly like? Well, that's the sucky thing about being a nerd. It's like alcoholism. Being such a Spidey nut, I had to have it in the collection just because it's Spiderman. And director Marc Webb gets three things right: Andrew Garfield as Peter, James Horner as Composer and Jerome Chen as visual effects supervisor. Whereas Spidey's swinging and movement was very unconvincing and computery in the Raimi films, this time he moves like a human spider and seems to be the comic book come to life. There's a scene where Spiderman webs the lizard that was almost worth the purchase price alone, just to watch the movie in slo-mo.

Not one move made, nor word uttered by the characters, was unexpected or interesting.  Sally Field and Martin Sheen showed themselves to be third rate actors as the aunt and uncle; they were no match whatsoever to the actors who played these likable characters in the original movie.  The actors who played Spider-man and Mary-Jane were equally unsympathetic; there was no chemistry between these characters at all.

There were no memorable tunes but the music served its purpose. After the movie I thought about the classic Superman flick from 1978 with memorable tunes and a great character development between Superman, Christopher Reeve, and his girlfriend, Margot Kidder, along with his Dad played by Marlon Brando. Even the villan of the Superman movie played by Gene Hackman made for a much more sinister one versus this one played by Rhys Ifans.

But if you grew up watching the cartoon, you will love this movie because Andrew Garfield plays the cool, quick witted Spidey I remember from the cartoon rather than the cheesy over dramatic sensitive one from the old movies.  He is geeky but not lame like Tobey Maguire was.  This movie is a lot more serious than the old ones, but it is still light and funny, just not campy.  Spiderman's infamous one liners actually make you laugh rather than hide your face in embarrassment.  The villain is cool and not laughable.  He even made me jump at one point when I first saw it.

4418924,5,B004LWZWFQ,"I have to say i was a little skeptical going in to see this movie.  I wasn't sure if Andrew Garfield was going to fit the part very well, but ended up liking him for how well he played the part.  My only criticism would be i don't think his physical build or height fit Spiderman very well.  The costume in certain scenes actually seemed to big for him sometimes lol.

The first thing i liked about this version, is that it got rid of the immense amount of ""cheese"" from the first films.  It was a little darker and more serious, which seems to be more appealing to the masses these days, and myself.  Many of my friends complained about his web shooters being an electronic device.  That didn't bother me at all, because it actually showed his scientific intelligence, which i think many people forget is Peter Parker's strength.  This, in my opinion, also makes him more vulnerable and human.

Overall i thought the movie was very entertaining, and had a nice ""root for him"" feel to it.  This was actually one of the better movies i've seen in 3D, and i absolutely loved one of the scenes before the final fight (i won't spoil it for those that havn't seen the movie yet).",1357603200,,1174,4.393518518518518
4418925,5,B004LWZWFQ,"Overall, I liked this version of Spider-Man the best. I grew up with these comics and enjoy watching them come to life. This is a comic book movie, not intended to be anything resembling reality. That said, there were a few gaffes but they did not really detract from the fun of this movie. I prefered the actors in this movie over the previous, I think their acting seemed a little bit lower key and more humorous, tongue in cheek for the most part.
If you enjoy comic book movies coming to life then you will probably enjoy this movie. If you are looking for realism, no mistakes, super special effects then probably better to skip this movie.",1357603200,,645,4.47457627118644

4419004,3,B004LWZWFQ,"I was really, really excited when I heard that the Spider-Man movie franchise was going to be rebooted.  I was hoping that this would mean moving Spider-Man to the same movie universe as the Avengers and that the movie itself would be raised to that level of excellence.  Sadly, that's not what happened.
Columbia Pictures still has the movie rights to the character of Spider-Man and they cranked this lukewarm effort out apparently to keep those rights.  Most of the movie feels a bit rushed to me and a bit cramped as it feels like the director, the aptly named Marc Webb, tried his best to shoe-horn as much into 2 1/4 hours as he possibly could.
The movie had several high points for me.  I enjoyed moving the story back to high school as that gives it a bit of an Ultimate Spider-Man flair.  I also liked having Gwen Stacy as the love interest.  Emma Stone does the character a lot of credit.  I really enjoyed the lack of organic web shooters as that was something that made no sense in the first movie series.  If Peter was going to develop spinnerettes, shouldn't they have been on his butt?  Finally, not bringing in Green Goblin right off the bat was a good move.  Every superhero out there has one archenemy, a nemesis of legendary proportion.  Bringin them in on the first movie is a mistake because where do you go from there?  Either every movie after will have to include the same villian or you have to inflate another lesser villian.
Unfortunately the movie has a number of low points as well.  First would have to be the pacing, as mentioned before.  It's difficult to copress 40+ years of comic history into a couple of hours, so don't try.  Just tell a portion of the story.  Deliberately set up a trilogy from the get-go if you have to.  The Lizard's design would be a close second.  Honestly, what was this thing supposed to be?  A design closer to the comics may have worked better than this Jurassic Park wannabe CGI mess that we were treated to but we'll never know now.  Rhys Ifans did a credible job as the human component of the villian, but Webb's desperate attempts to make the monster look like him just don't work.  The script also contains some problems.  Some of the dialogue feels forced and unnatural.  Also, you shouldn't really have a Spider-Man movie and not have the line about power and responsibility, yet for some goofy reason that famous line is completely omitted.  Finally, Andrew Garfield is a low point as well.  I find his portrayal of Peter Parker/Spider-Man to be a bit angsty and sulky.  There's a fair amount of whining going on and it's hard to tell how much is Andrew and how much is the script.  The most amazing thing about the film is that the mask can push down all that hair.
Over all, the movie strives desperately to surpass the first two movies of the original trilogy but falls well short.  Fans of the character who've never seen the first movies will probably like this better.  There's some nice action sequences, but the compressed story and stilted script detract from the overall enjoyment.  Maybe they'll do better with the sequel.",1357516800,,3103,4.55877034358047
4419005,3,B004LWZWFQ,"Actually from what I read it was a reboot due to the fact Sony didn't want to pay Tobey Maguire or Sam Raimi the huge bucks to get them back.

Another retell of the Spiderman origin just wasn't needed, they should have done what The Incredible Hulk did, tell it through flasbacks at the start.

Garfield and Stone just didn't have any chemistry together in my opinion, I rather have the geeky science nerd Peter Parker from the comics instead of a skater dude Parker. And the Lizard was made in such a way that it seemed the writers got him and Killer Croc from Batman mixed up. It needed a second villian such as The Shocker or Electro. The movie itself just seemed slow paced, and again how they portrayed they Lizard and his mutate all of NYC as another cliche plot device. No sympathy for him unlike Doc Connors in the comics. The movie also seemed to try and do the famous Spiderman quips at first then kinda lost it by halfway through the movie. And what is  the remove the mask constantly thing about?

The movie itself was ok in general, just nothing new brought to the table and needed a better villian and better script.",1357516800,3,1130,4.392344497607655
4419006,4,B004LWZWFQ,"This Spider-Man movie sticks closer to the original Marvel Spider-Man storyline.

4419056,4,B004LWZWFQ,I won't go into detail about the movie to spoil it but I enjoyed the movie.  It was a different take on Spiderman then I remember reading the comics when I was a kid(back in the 90's).  The love interest was Gwen Stacey(it's mentioned on the back of box so not really a surprise).  Maybe I'm sticking to my youth too much but I always remember his love for Mary Jane Watson so not having her made me wonder about the story.  The story was pretty good on its own but as many people have probably said it seems too soon to reboot the franchise.  I know there are a ton of villains for Spiderman(pretty much the equivalent of Batman in the DC universe) but they could have tried a few other super hero movies before coming back to Spiderman franchise with an entire new cast and crew.  But if your a fan of comic movies and like Spiderman then this movie would be good for you.,1357430400,2,874,4.203592814371257

So if you liked any Avenger related hero movies, you'd like The Amazing Spider-Man. Andrew Garfield, who plays Spider-Man, closely resembles the Spider-man from the comics and does a perfect job mimicking Peter Parker's witty comments and personalty. Just like Iron Man 1&2, The Incredible Hulk, and Capitan America, it is highly entertaining and always keeps your attention on screen. Most character interactions were done smoothly, all except the high school scenes. I'm still trying to forget any scene that involved exploring the social aspect of Peter's High School.

The angsty skater spiderman just didn't seem to have any heart, and that's where I left this interpretation behind. note: I was once a heartless angsty skater teen myself...

This one had the perfect amount of action for any superhero fan. The choreography was the best of any movie I have seen in decades. I own over 1100 dvds. The romance, action, drama, action, plot line, the action, was perfect. The chemistry between the two real life lovers, Andrew Garfield(Peter Parker/Spiderman) and Emma Stone(Gwen Stacey) was palpable. I have nothing negative to say about this film. Sally Field, as usual did a perfect job as Aunt May.  Martin Sheen, a great actor, was great as Uncle Ben. Adding the storyline about Peter's parents were an added bonus, as the comics don't delve into it much. Peter's releasing frustration at Uncle Ben about the pain of his parents deserting him, was heart touching, heart felt and well acted. I had never heard of Garfield before this movie. We all will know him henceforth. He is a damn good actor. Can't wait for the next installment. Garfeild is clearly then next big star. This is his breakout movie and he broke out just fine. Emma Stone is the next great character actress, as opposed to being typecast.

Great enemy with special effects(The Lizard). Good acting by the actor who played Kurt Connors. Great movie. Great cast. Great script, Great acting. Great scott. What's next? Wrong superhero. That is Suuperman. Than again, this Spiderman is a supermovie.",1357257600,,1620,4.930402930402931

4419266,3,B004LWZWFQ,my 3 stars is for the movie itself. The blu-ray was done very well. Love the 3D. This Spider-man put us right back at the beginning of the other spider-man (over one hour) which was much better then this one. The English kid (Peter Parker) Had a bad American Accent. It was really hard to like him. Way to cocky . Has everyone forgotten Peter Parker is a New Yorker? The one good thing about the movie is they did the lizard as the villain. Seems like a lot of the comic book hero's in today's movie's are English.

This version, no matter how much it departed in some ways from Spider-Man's origin story, was 10 times better!!  Andrew Garfield really nails the character, including Spider-Man's constant jabber while he fights, and his insecurities both in and out of costume.  The action was spectacular, and the plot and dialogue were some of the best that I've seen in a comic book adaptation.

This was no Avengers, but it was still REALLY REALLY good.

Note: I wrote this review before Civil War and Homecoming came out and gave us Tom Holland's even better portrayal of the Marvel poster child.  Andrew Garfield was good.  Holland is the best yet.",1357084800,3,792,4.772058823529412

4419360,4,B004LWZWFQ,"I think I should start out by saying everyone's main complaint.
  It was too soon for a reboot.
  A. Spiderman 3 sucked
  B. Tobey Maguire and the director both quit, so it is kinda hard to make a Spiderman without Spiderman
The main problem I have with this movie is
  1. the editing and 2. the marketing
They edited out the lizard human story line so much that it made it impossible to care about that character. It showed his wife and son in the advertisements, but not the actual movie. I think if they had included it in the movie, the lizard would be a much better villain. Plus he looks really goofy

and.. There wasn't enough of the untold story. They cut out a character almost completely. You know that rich guy in the car that the lizard attacks?? YEA he was supposed to have a much bigger part, and he had something to do with why Peter became Spiderman, and what happened to his parents. BUT they cut out his part. I don't know the reason, but my guess is they are saving that information for the sequel.

OH and one more thing. People say he is too hip and cool in the movie. Trust me when I say (because I just graduated), These kids are the outcasts. No more is the ""computer nerd"" like the previous movies (because technology is cool), now the people that get put out of the ""circles"" is the shy guy, the skateboarder, the goofy people, etc.. and Peter here has most of these traits.

overall, I really liked this movie. If you go in not thinking about the trailers, you can really enjoy the movie.",1357084800,2,1515,4.299295774647887

-Character interactions feel real to me.
-I like Andrew Garfield so much more then Tobey Maguire.
-Emma Stone is great.
-I like the look more than the previous films.  (action at night with tasty moon rim light)
-I like Horner's score more than Elfman's.
-All aspects of Peter Parker's story are more elegantly woven together.
-contains such a nice fresh take on the traditional 'super hero learning their powers' sequence
-a negative - The Lizard is not all that interesting.  All parts of the movie which are about Peter rather than the Lizard are much better

This movie has gotten a lot of hate. People love to complain about the quick reboot (by now I think it's just something that's popular to say without having much thought behind the actual complaint itself.  Why do you even care people?). I thought this film adaptation of the Spidey story was way better than the first. But yes, it is still a comic book movie and should be judged accordingly.

Unfortunately, this movie disappointed me as well. Too much teenage drama, unsatisfying action scenes and another whining Spider-man really let me down once again. I usually enjoy the 'becoming a superhero' movie, but it's nowhere near Iron-Man (which is the top notch 'becoming' movie imho).

4419562,3,B004LWZWFQ,"I will admit right up front that I am not a comic book reader. My whole basis for knowing Spiderman is based on 1980's cartoons. Say what you will. From what I've read of the true comicbook fans though, sadly the 1980s cartoons are far more accurate than this movie. Overall the movie is OK. As a movie. That's it. Sure the CGI is better than the Toby Maguire Spiderman movies but that is simply a given based on the advances in technology. That shouldn't be any credit given to the producer, director, or writers of this movie. Unfortunately, and sadly, the movie misrepresents Peter Parker's entire character, and also Spiderman's, out of a seemingly desperate attempt to be ""modern"". Skater boy? Really? Peter Parker is a science nerd!!! Andrew Garfield was waaaay too cool in this movie. Seriously if they thought a cute boy like Andrew Garfield was going to inconsistently put on some nerdy glasses and we are to believe this makes up Peter then the producers are sadly mistaken and really just insulting their audience. I have to agree with other reviewers comments on the fact this movie shows hundreds of spiders, not just the one genetically altered super-spider which is supposed to have bitten Peter. Additionally, where is the girl-next-door love of his life Maryjane??? Not just some high school science class crush such as Gwen. The other issues I didn't like for this movie is that Spiderman gets beat the hell up, and needs gadgets to spin his webs. Since I'm not a reader of the original comic books I don't have an opinion based on honoring the true and original story line. However, I do much prefer Toby Maguire's Spiderman movies where he isn't so fragile. Its just lame that Andrew Garfield's Spiderman comes home with a RASH. Really????? I'll have to check on the true accuracy of the comic books just to know the truth of the web issue, but I did personally prefer Toby's Spiderman super power of being able to shoot web out of his body. If you're going to be bitten by a genetically mutated super spider, then shouldn't he have the full awesome transformation??? Overall, this movie had some serious flaws in the characters and plot, among other things, but if you don't care and just want another flashy Hollywood film, then you'll probably like it. PS what the hell is wrong with the writers and producers? Did they accidentally think they were writing a new Godzilla movie too??? Kind of funny too when you recall the Police Chief was sarcastically making jabs to Peter about claiming Godzilla was out there.",1356825600,3,2536,4.739819004524887

I read all other reviews on this movie and I decided to pass it up for months, until I finally said, ""What the heck, how bad can it be?""

Turns out it was a great purchase and I found it the most entertaining Spiderman movie thus far. I felt this movie has received so much injustice in terms of reviews that I had to come here and recommend it to those who where on the fence like I was.

4419565,5,B004LWZWFQ,"I'm not a comic reader and have never read the ones for Spiderman, I'm more of a movie fan so if you are looking for a review that compares this movie to the comics this review may not be helpful for that.  I have watched the Spiderman trilogy that came out in the 2000s and thought they were pretty well done, but for some reason I enjoyed this Spiderman more.  For example, I found the character of Spiderman rather annoying in the trilogy whereas I could relate to his character better in this one.  I also like how this version had more background to the story as it started off with Peter Parker as a child living with his parents and touches a little bit upon his dad and how he was a very secretive man.  I also found the relationship between Peter Parker and Mary Jane really annoying in the Trilogy but the relationship he had with Gwen Stacy was more realistic and not over dramatized.  The fighting scenes were typical superhero style of fast paced and lots of smashing with the hero seeming to be the weaker out of the two but that is what is expected from these movies.  Of course there were many similarities played out differently in this movie when compared to the first of the older Trilogy.  For example, the spider bite, the fate of the uncle, Peter letting a thieve go due to his irritation with the person being robbed, the split personality of the villain, and so on.  They were just played out quite differently.  Peter Parker in this movie was also much funnier I thought; especially when he is dealing with the car thieve.  I found it to be an overall enjoyable movie and just about anyone who likes action will like it and my 6-year-old son really enjoyed it so it is a good movie for the younger generation.",1356739200,,1734,4.407523510971787

I was hugely disappointed.  Perhaps I had too high expectations but even without the weight of expectation this would have been a very disappointing movie I believe.  I don't wana offend Spiderman fans but I hated this movie and its a struggle to even give it 1 star.  Sorry Spidey fans....I'm sticking with Batman.",1356739200,,550,4.525252525252525
4419567,4,B004LWZWFQ,I would have to say this is the best Spider-man movie made so far. The storyline was decent even though it wasn't exactly like the comic. The action was good and entertaining. I would also have to say the 3D quality is great. This movie was made to be seen in 3D. It makes you feel like you're actually right there in the action and swinging between buildings right with Spider-man.

4419651,3,B004LWZWFQ,"There's a lot to like about Marc Webb's reboot of the Spider-Man franchise. The directing is sharp, the action-scenes are well-staged and the cast couldn't be better chosen. Unfortunately The Amazing Spider-Man doesn't do a whole lot to separate itself from Sam Raimi's original trilogy, and despite it's many improvements the movie never feels as engaging as it should.

The Amazing Spider-Man starts as a somewhat unnecessary re-telling of the Web-Slinger's origin, but it does have a few interesting twists: A young Peter Parker is left in the care of his Aunt May and Uncle Ben after his parents mysteriously vanish and later die in a plane crash. As a teenager, Peter investigates his father's work which leads him to Dr. Curt Connors (who becomes the villain The Lizard) and the accident which gives him his Spider-like powers. The action shifts between Peter's investigation, his high-school life with romantic interest Gwen Stacy and bully Flash Thompson, and his home-life with his caring Aunt and Uncle. The Amazing Spider-Man plays out in a much more grounded fashion then Raimi's films as we see Peter building his web-shooters and costume (first as just a mask to wear) and going on plain-clothed vigilante-runs before officially becoming Spider Man. I'm not sure if these differences make Webb's movie an improvement over Raimi's but those who thought the original trilogy was too silly should find these changes easier to swallow.

As I said before, The Amazing Spider-Man is well cast and Andrew Garfield is a much smarter (and less campy) Peter Parker than Tobey Maguire; Using his web's vibration to track the Lizard through the sewers was a clever gimick and I was especially thrilled hearing Spider-Man taunt the crooks he's hunting down with sarcastic asides and motor-mouthed glibbing. Unfortunately he's not very likeable either and early parts of the film focus way too much on Peter's awkward social-quirks and temper-tantrums. I was a bit more vested once he became Spider Man though, and I especially liked a powerful scene which has Spider Man saving a little child by talking to him while the car they're in slowly falls into the ocean.

Martin Sheen, Rhy Ifans and Denis Leary are equally good as Uncle Ben, Dr. Connors and Captain Stacy, a police officer trying to bring down Spider-Man's vigilante actions. Sadly the same can't be said for Sally Field, who's wasted as a one-note Aunt May and Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy; Stone and Garfield have zero chemistry and their unconvicing romance takes up a good chunk of the movie.

Obviously my opinion of The Amazing Spider-Man is very mixed. The special-effects are terrific (as is this Hi-Def transfer) and the action-scenes are pretty exciting once the movie picks up (the final showdown with Spider-Man and The Lizard is a pretty cool climax). Overall, though? I really didn't feel one way or the other about this movie. If you thought Sam Raimi's movies were too campy or haven't seen the originals you might want to check out this more level-headed take on Spider Man. Unfortunately for me it was all by-the-numbers with only a good cast to keep me interested.",1356739200,2,3142,4.979047619047619

After the amazing job done on the Spiderman 1, 2 and 3 films with Tobey Maguire, I had my doubts about this one. I was right. You can't improve on perfection. So what did they do? They reinvented the whole story. That alone should offend long-time fans. In addition, Andrew Garfield was seriously miscast. He is just not believable in the role nor does he look the part. Tobey Maguire took the role seriously, bulking up to play the super strong web-slinger. In this version, (slightly) padded suits and CGI did it all. I managed to get through it once but it is not worthy of a second viewing. Maybe this version is best left to kids who have no history with The Amazing Spiderman.",1356739200,5,788,4.36734693877551

He is a conflicted soul and it makes you realize that there is the capability within each one of us to be bad - if we believe in our cause. Excellent special effects.

I watched the Blu Ray and was pleasantly surprised at the picture quality and the movie itself. It does have a certain Twilight-esque feeling at times, but nowhere near as cheesy. I find this movie comparable to Batman Begins where we learn the character's emotional motivation. I don't want to spoil anything, but you can definitely tell from a few new changes from the previous Spiderman that this movie's core rationale was Nolan's Batman Trilogy. The Spiderman in this film seems to be more like the comics in that Spiderman is a bit more playful even if this film did stray in other areas. The villain really isn't that terrifying, but the villain is only one of the many obstacles Peter Parker has to face. It seems like he is sometimes against everything and everyone that makes me wonder if that was the intended purpose.

Overall, I found it be on par with the other Marvel juggernauts like Thor and Captain America.",1356566400,,1036,4.6923076923076925

Only think I do not like is the limited range of tablets that can make use of the second screen experience.

There were a lot of scenes where everyone didn't actually have real dialogue, so they said ""uhh, yeah, umm"" and that kind of thing a lot. The action is pretty good, the basic story was pretty good. It is good for a watch. If you liked the originals with Tobey Maguire, you will hate this one. I thought Tobey Maguire was one of the worst actors ever because he never changed expression and had a very dull personality in every single one of his movies, so I thought anything was better than him. The only real complaint I have about modern movies in general is the portrayal of high tech areas and labs and stuff, which this movie has a lot of. The way movies see to have this is the pull and push screen things, as if 3D rotational computer projects exist right now. All the keycard entry door panels have been replaced by ipods, seriously, that is what they are with a useless entry system that anyone can break. They even did the same thing with the fire alarm, a virtual fire alarm, that is freaking retarded and impractical. This issue is related to this movie, but Hollywood in general. The lesson is better story and less shiny, impractical crap that would never actually exist.

As for the case, it was embarrassing to say the least... The blurays were in their holders like they should be along with the ultraviolet disc, but for those who have a DVD player, it was like a middle finger to them. The DVD was put in a cheap PC startup disc looking envelope and just thrown in there. In the Pirates of the Caribbean 5 disc set, everything was in its correct holder, so there was no excuse for the packaging. Instant minus 1 star on that.",1356307200,,1723,4.418238993710692

Sally Field, with all of her acting prowess couldn't make Aunt May seem to be anything more than an enabler to Parker's ""dangerous"" choice to be Spiderman.

4420300,1,B004LWZWFQ,"I won't describe the flaws of the movie in detail - others already have done a great job describing the specifics of where this movie falls short. (Read ""Storyline Was the Problem"")

What I'll express is my amazement of how the makers of this movie decided to discard a proven formula for success - and that's the original comic book. The comic book is a prebuilt and proven storyboard that has captivated the imaginations of millions of people for roughly 30 yrs, - and the comic did so with all the limitations of still graphics from 30 yrs ago.

All movie makers need to have the next blockbuster Spiderman is pick the right cast, stick to the original story, characters, personality, etc., and add CGI - something the first two Spiderman movies did well.

Suffice it to say if you're hoping to see Spiderman in this movie you won't. What you'll watch is a SciFi movie with a guy dressed like Spiderman and with Spiderman powers... the comparison ends there... Oh yeah, there's a giant Lizzard-man like in Spiderman too... how could I forget? Easy - it's a very forgettable movie.",1356220800,12,1083,4.659685863874346
4420301,4,B004LWZWFQ,"The Amazing Spider-Man is the reboot to the incredibly popular trilogy directed by Sam Raimi and starred Tobey Maguire as the web slinger.  It's only been 5 short years since Spider-Man 3, Raimi and Maguire's final crack at the superhero.  Sony decided to start a new, and here we are today.  Marc Webb became famous after 500 Days of Summer; he was tapped to direct this reboot.  Sony's decision had fans scratching their heads.  They doubted what the director of a romantic comedy could bring to the table of a big budget action film?  I'll get to that in a moment.  Then came the ""you can't win"" casting of Andrew Garfield.  I PERSONALLY was excited because I knew the calibur of actor that Garfield was.  Also cast was Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy, Peter Parker's love interest.  Rhys Ifans plays the villain in the movie, Dr. Curt Connors/The Lizard.  Denis Leary plays Gwen Stacy's father and the captain of the police department.  Rounding out the cast are Martin Sheen and Sally Field as Uncle Ben and Aunt May.  Let's go!

What I liked about the film:
Our New Spider-Man

Andrew Garfield; I hate to say 'I told you so', but damn it I told you so.  The actor is terrific.  Physically, Garfield is more like the comic book hero than Maguire was (tall and skinny rather than short and ripped).  In my opinion, his take on the character was more grounded in reality than the previous trilogy.  Then again, everything in this movie was more grounded in reality than the previous trilogy, except maybe the villain.  Garfield gets to show off his acting chops in some great scenes with Emma Stone, Martin Sheen and Sally Field.  You believe the pain he feels about losing his parents and the mystery behind their leaving him.  Garfield's Peter Parker is not as big of a nerd as Maguire's, and that's a good thing.  Again, staying grounded in reality made for a better film I think.  Nice job.

The Rest of the Cast

Emma Stone is one of my favorite young actresses today (and I have a bit of a crush on her too, don't tell anyone).  She plays the Gwen Stacy character pretty straight, with touches of vulnerability here and there.  The filmmakers used the Gwen character and not Mary Jane Watson, made famous by Kristin Dunst in the previous incarnation.  Gwen is equally as smart as Peter Parker, maybe even smarter.  And thank goodness they didn't take the damsel in distress act too far like ALL THREE of the previous Spider-Man films before it.  Dennis Leary didn't have much screen time but was really really good.  He has some awesome scenes in the movie I don't want to spoil here.  Martin Sheen and Sally Field made for great parental figures to our hero.  They were caring, loving and tough when they needed to be.  I liked how they were kept out of the action.  Unlike the time aunt May was swung around New York in previous films, come on!

Writers

James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves wrote a superhero film within a love story.  That's what some of the best superhero films have been able to do.  Take for example Superman (1978); director Richard Donner has gone on record to say, if he could convince the audience that Superman and Lois Lane were in love, he could convince them an actor could fly.  Garfield and Stone's real life relationship shined on screen, their chemistry was undeniable.  The writers also chose to go the Batman Begins route, and focus on the man behind the mask.  And like Batman Begins, it's not until half way through the movie do we even see the character in spandex.  Like I've stated above, I liked how much the movie was grounded in reality and how it was about the people, not the action.

The Score
James Horner (Avatar, Titanic) wrote a beautiful score.  Soft and caring when the movie was too, then grand and epic when it needed to be.  And also stealing from Batman Begins, Horner doesn't reveal Spider-Man's new theme until the climax of the film.  When scoring Batman Begins, Hans Zimmer stated that the character hadn't yet earned the theme, until the very end.  I thought that was an amazing way to use music to reflect the growth of a character.  Awesome.

The Special Effects/Action

The special effects and the action look different than any of the previous Spider-Man films.  The hero is acrobatic, and doens't rely on martial arts to defeat his attackers.  This is another way to stay grounded in reality.  Peter Parker is a nerdy kid, why would he know how to fight?  Instead he uses his speed and abilties to defeat his opponents.  Also important to note, Spider-Man's web shoots out of a device created by Parker, unlike the organic origin used by Maguire.  Another thing I enjoyed: the physics in the movie are accurate.  Spider-Man doesn't just magically swing from one building to the other without logical reason.  There's even a line in the movie explaining the physics.  Spider-Man has to swing forward while hooked to SOMETHING!  Sam Raimi ignored that tiny little fact.

Marc Webb

I was a doubter.  I doubted ""what the director of a romantic comedy could bring to the table of a big budget action film"".  I was wrong.  His vision was the right one.  The one Sony should have used back in 2002 at the launch of the original franchise.  His new cast, the tone, the style and even his new camera use was awesome.  There are a few point of view shots that will have you wishing you were the hero.  He also opted to keep out the campy junk; like the wrestling, and the specifics of how Peter Parker created his costume.

What I didn't like about the film:
The Villain

Hold up, hold up, hold up.  Rhys Ifan did a wonderful job as Dr. Curt Connors.  The actor's turn to the dark side was great, he was very believable.  The motives for the change were my only gripe about the character.  Would the need to help millions push someone to do what the villain does in this movie?  Maybe not.  Is it a deal breaker?  Not at all.  The odds had to be great for our hero to be challenged, and the filmmakers did what they had to do to make it so.  The only other dislike is, I wish there was more of Martin Sheen as Uncle Ben!  I think the filmmakers could have treated the character with more care than they did.  Small price to pay for such a great film.

The Verdict:
I Finally Care About Spider-Man

Thank you Marc Webb for finally making me care what Spider-Man is up to.  As you can tell, I was never a fan of the original trilogy, much less the character himself.  Webb, Garfield and company have created a new world for the character to live in that far exceeds the previous.  This is a tough tough world we live in, and our movies need to reflect that; not the campy world Raimi projected through his films.  Even if you're not a comic book fan, you will very much appreciate this movie.  And lastly, The Amazing Spider-Man offers up the best Stan Lee cameo to date!",1356220800,2,6843,4.50815660685155

4420334,2,B004LWZWFQ,"In 2002 when Sam Raimis' 'Spider-Man' came to the big screen I was blown away with how far film making had come to finally give us an accurate depiction of a comic book hero. When 'Spider-Man 3' came out however, I was looking for a bucket to puke in. So now, after many years and rumors we have...new director, new cast, new Spider-Man. I for one feel that this 'Amazing' Spider-Man...is not so amazing.

Here is what works in this film, the acting. It is a great cast, Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone & Rhys Iffans did a wonderful job in their roles. The special effects, you can tell how far we have come even though the original's effects where truly ahead of the time. The story...no. Way too dark too many people crying every 15 seconds it just didn't work for me. People say that Spider-Man is a dark story, but darn it I don't see it. Every depiction of Spider-Man I have seen just has never been so gloomy. Even in the comics while there are very complex stories they are always a fun read. I didn't find 'The Amazing Spider-Man' fun. Now, of course there is no turning back which a sequel on the horizon again with a good cast and a new villain that has yet to make his big screen debut and will I see it...I may. I just wish that when you try it the first time you shouldn't ruin what you have. 'Spider-Man 3' should have been re-shot to actually be good and personally I felt Topher Grace got shafted. Or if you are chosen to play a character and you are terrified of being type-casted then do us all a favor and say no up front. I'm talking to you Magurie! and by the way...what have you done since you left that franchise that was relevant anyway hmmm?

4420409,2,B004LWZWFQ,"While 'Spider-man 3' was no classic, especially compared to the first two films, it was far better than this piece of unnecessary garbage. 'The Amazing Spider-Man' attempted to reintroduce Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy in this film, but it has only been five years since the last film. Maybe they should've wait another 5 years. Though I like Emma Stone as an actress, I didn't think she was right for Gwen, nor did I take to Andrew Garfield as Peter. I did like Denis Leary as Gwen's father. El Lizardo (the villain) was a disaster. The reason Sony made this film in the first place (too quicklly) was so the studio wouldn't lose the Spider-Man rights to Marvel Entertainment (and to rival studio, Disney). Surely, if Sony had wanted to make another Spider-Man they should have considered the feelings of the viewers, then write a GOOD script, and cast actors who fit their roles. 'The (not-so) Amazing Spider-Man' was boring and unspectacular (isn't there a comic book also called 'The Spectacular Spider-Man'???). Another film is in the works.

It doesn't allow you to manage the movie through iTunes.  They will only allow you to download and watch the movie on a PC through their Sony Pictures Download Manager (which requires Silver Light).  You can also try downloading the movie over the air to your iOS device in a containerized app, Flixster.  But good luck with that, mine has crashed and failed repeatedly.  This provides for an EXTREMELY poor user experience because not only does the movie not show up with the rest of your videos, but you actually have to re-download it on any other iOS device you want it on.  With iTunes, you can simply sync it on and off at will from any of your authorized devices (we have over a dozen in my household).  Also, since it isn't in iTunes, you can't stream it through the Apple TV.  I frequently swap out my movies and rotate them using iTunes.  I don't have room for 50+ movies on my device at once.

Emma Stone wasn't the pretty helpless female that superhero heroines often are. She didn't need to be rescued and was genuine, intelligent and lovely to the T.

Every time a character did or said something contrived and silly, I was forced to constantly note ""it's a movie""... I couldn't suspend my belief for a second to get into the film at all.  Really, I honestly wonder how such a film got made and am very sorry I spent 4.99 renting it-- further contributing to the very undeserved royalties it got.

4420651,3,B004LWZWFQ,"I read good reviews about this Spiderman reboot, and looked forward to watching what was summer blockbuster.  And the truth be told, I always felt Tobey Maguire was a bit too-square in that role.

The person writing the screenplay did a good job in the first 1/3 of the film.  They modified the original enough to keep it interesting.  Don't forget, the exact same story was just told 10 years ago with great success.

After the first 1/3 of the film, it started heading down to an unlikely outcome even a science fiction fan would have a tough time believing.  The great scientist on the cusp of new genetic research is waiting for Peter Parker (at age 17) to show up and complete his career's toughest challenge.  Not only is Peter lucky enough to stumble into a high security research lab, but he is also a undiscovered prodigy in science.

How the scientist becomes the villain in the movie completely turned me off, which is the main reason for the three stars.  He takes a dose of new serum, doesn't fully understand the impact, and starts to shun and then hate Peter Parker within 2-3 scenes.  The path and behavior he takes to an evil end is unlikely to the point I lost interest.

Unfortunately for this film, the bar has been raised on what makes a good superhero movie. A great villain is needed to draw-in and hold the audience.  Someone who is intriguing, perhaps with a troubled background.  I found it lacking in this category.

The Jokers in each Batman film were benchmarks of a great movie. A person could love them and hate them at the same time.  I would still watch them again today, but not this one.",1355702400,,1622,4.506849315068493

4420653,4,B004LWZWFQ,"Director Marc Webb (500 Says of Summer) brings new life to Marvel Comics' wall-crawling hero in the fun-filled superhero adventure The Amazing Spider-Man. Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is a nerdy high school student and social outcast who attempts to discover the truth behind his parents disappearance when he was young, but a strange twist of fate leads him to the life as New York City's friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. Parker will need all his special skills and courage to stop his father's former partner, research scientist Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans), who has developed a revolutionary regeneration serum that transforms him into a monstrous 9-foot tall reptile. As a reboot of the popular film franchise, The Amazing Spider-Man preserves many of the key elements of the previous Sam Raimi films, but Marc Webb adds some of his own creativity to the mix. Despite its darker tone, the film features some amusingly lighthearted and comedic moments, impressive visual effects and rousing excitement. The Amazing Spider-Man also stars Emma Stone, Denis Leary, Martin Sheen and Sally Field.

The Blu-Ray release of The Amazing Spider-Man is certainly top-notch. The superhero adventure is presented in its theatrical 2.35:1 format. Its High Definition digital transfer is quite incredible with stunning detail y rich colors. Its 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio is also remarkable. The Blu-Ray features a feature-length audio commentary track with director Marc Webb and producers Avi Arad and Matt Tolmach, over 16 minutes of deleted scenes, storyboards, animated sequences, an interactive picture gallery, behind-the-scene footage, and the seven-part documentary Rite of Passage: The Amazing Spider-Man Reborn.

I mean maybe a couple of trusted people his aunt, and his g/f aka next door neighbor knew, but not everyone who saw him maskless as frequently as he was in this movie.

I miss the days of ""Digital Copy"" when you just popped in the supplementary disc and transferred a digital copy to whatever you wanted.  UltraViolet is a HUGE hassle! You have to sign up for multiple accounts to crap you don't care about, and the bottom line is you don't get a digital copy to use on various devices but instead you can stream the movie from an online source connected to your sony ""whatever"" account.

The cockiness at the beginning when he got his powers was so believable it was so atypical way a teenager would have acted if he/she got powers and then the subtle way he got into the role of actually being a super hero. Gwen Stacy played by the amazing Emma Stone was perfectly cast yes she doesn't have any powers but she was not a whimpering screaming for help damsel she would fight with the best of them if she got the opportunity.

I've since found this version of the Spider-man story to be much like the original release of Batman, the one with Michael Keaton, and the ones that followed with Val Kilmer and George Clooney. Those movies were ""goofy"", but still entertaining. And then, the new series came out, which were more inline with how I think Batman was meant to be portrayed.

The Spider-man's with Toby were good, even great at times, but were ""goofy"" when compared to The Amazing Spider-man. Great movie! Happy to recommend it.",1355356800,,595,4.833333333333333

4420848,3,B004LWZWFQ,"This year brought about a reboot of the Spider-Man cinematic universe.  The Amazing Spider-Man met with surprisingly good reviews, enough to convince me to see it. But I'm not totally in love with it.

First, let's talk Tobey Maguire versus Andrew Garfield.  Everyone told me Garfield is so much more convincing as nerdy Peter Parker . . . but I don't see it.  The first time we see Garfield's Peter in school, he's got perfectly puffed hair, contacts, a skateboard, and a hoodie.  He stands tall.  He looks cool.  The first time we see Maguire's Peter, he's chasing after a bus and being laughed at because his clothes and glasses may not totally hide that Maguire is a movie star, but he's at least acting lame.

Spider-man I'll give Garfield this: he got to dish out more of Peter's signature terrible humor.  But his delivery need work - the timing of the jokes felt rushed to me.  Meanwhile, Maguire trying to figure out how his webbing works is still a classic bit of physical comedy.

The girls are pretty even.  Emma Stone is perfect for Gwen Stacy; Kirsten Dunst is a perfect Mary Jane Watson.  But the thin ponytail and thick bangs that are Stacy's expected look are terrible for Stone.  She looked best in the scenes where they let her hair be down and wavy - they should've just let her look nice instead of trying to conform to strongly to the comics look.

And look, I love Sally Field and Martin Sheen.  But they were terrible as Aunt May and Uncle Ben.  Sheen's Ben was a scold and Field's May was a doormat.  And look, Aunt May might be old, but that woman is firm.  She's one of the best parents in any comic book universe, not a woman with no control over her household.

I'm not even going to bring up direction.  Sam Raimi crushes Marc Webb.  Webb's scenes of Peter slinging through the city look like everything that's been done before.  Raimi's felt fun.

As for mythology choices, I understand that The Amazing Spider-Man wanted to be different from Spider-Man.  People have complained for years about Peter's web-shooters being organic, so making them once more his invention could've been a good move.  But the organic webbing simplified the story in Spider-Man.  The large order of Oscorp webbing had to look suspicious.  And it just felt wrong without Uncle Ben saying, ""With great power comes great responsibility.""  Maybe they could've had him say the original ""With great power there must also come -- great responsibility!"" instead of dancing around it?

Plot-wise, I liked that Peter was a little more free with his secret identity.  Keeping it super secret damaged his relationships in the original movie trilogy.  But there has to be a happy medium - I felt like almost every character knew who Spider-Man really was by the end of the film.  Saving Norman Osborn for a later movie was probably a good move - it helps differentiate the movies and allows for a bigger, more recognizable bad guy to come along in a later entry in the series.  But Rhys Ifans, who I usually find hilarious, wasn't the best fit for the villain.  Perhaps no one would be because the guy is just that grating.  Osborn at least has some charisma, and Willem Defoe did an amazing job of playing two personalities.  (And props again to Raimi, for the framing in the scenes where Osborn talks to himself as the Green Goblin.)

Others might disagree with my opinion, but here it is.  The Amazing Spider-Man was a decent spectacle and hit the standard comic film beats that I love.  However, Spider-Man is a classic of the genre, and its successor didn't come close to touching its highs.",1355270400,4,3593,4.632329635499207
4420849,5,B004LWZWFQ,As always Amazon never disappoints movie arrived on time and I couldn't wait I love this movie and Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man was refreshing he is so adorable. Glad I bought the 3 disc combo best price.,1355270400,,205,4.5675675675675675
4420850,5,B004LWZWFQ,I like this reboot a lot better than the other series. The spider man character is closer to the comic book character as was the first villain shown in this movie. I hope the rest continue to be as faithful to the comic books.,1355270400,,226,4.159090909090909

4420891,2,B004LWZWFQ,"This movie was better than I expected, but then, I expected it to be a total piece of cr@p. It was slightly better than that.
When compared against Spider-Man 1 and 2, however, you realize how bad this really is. The story was just bad. For instance, why the room of spiders? The spiders were Peter's father's experiment, but he had disappeared how many years ago? Why was it still there? Dr. Connors was focused on lizards.

Peter was unlikable.

Spider-Man was a wuss. How else do you describe a super hero who can supposedly move so fast he can dodge bullets and so strong he can lift cars, but runs from a few street thugs?

We are treated to a revenge driven Spider-Man instead of a duty driven one.

A decade later and the special effects are no better than with the first Spider-Man movie. In fact, Spidey's on screen appearances are rather underwhelming when compared to those earlier films.

If they were smart, they would have tried to fix the mistakes of the 3rd film (which was still better than this one) with a well written 4th, instead of this poorly thoughtout reboot.",1355270400,4,1084,4.538461538461538
4420892,3,B004LWZWFQ,"This movie was ok, but I think the original Spidey movie is much better.  This movie seemed tired and character development wasn't nearly as good",1355270400,3,145,4.8
4420893,4,B004LWZWFQ,"I avoided this Spiderman because of the reviews and the actor that plays Spiderman. He just seems like someone that should not be playing Spiderman. However, after watching it, I feel it is the best Spiderman so far.

The special effects are very good. The villain, in my opinion, looked much more believable than the other Spidermans. The actor that played Spidy, grew on me(some)by the end of the movie. Sally Field, Martin Sheen and Dennis Leary gave the best performances.

There were several scenes that I really disliked and felt should not have been in the movie but they were brief and with minimal/moderate irritation. To me, the other Spiderman movies had a campy type feeling to them and this one seems to have too much goofiness. Goofiness meaning Spiderman acting stupid, teasing villains, making snappy remarks during fight scenes, etc.

Anyway, it was much better than I expected. 4 stars means I like it so one star deducted for the above reasons and for Spiderman making a promise to the dying man at the end of the movie then breaking the promise.",1355270400,2,1065,4.7771739130434785

4420895,3,B004LWZWFQ,"It was entertaining. It did not revolutionize anything. It looks like Hollywood is running out of move ideas.

Anyways, the movie had a good premise. The character development was unique, wasn't how most portray Peter Parker. I see the direction they were trying to go for. They wanted to make it more dark and gritty, felt like it kinda backfired because they really didn't build up to anything with it.

The CG with the Lizard was pretty bad. It wasn't bad that it looked amateurish, but for a major motion picture, I expected a much more realistic Lizard.",1355184000,,558,4.683673469387755

4421048,5,B004LWZWFQ,This movie is different and it shows a different way Peter Parker was bitten by a spider. I like this Spider-Man movie.,1355097600,,119,4.454545454545454
4421049,5,B004LWZWFQ,"I've been a Spidey fan since I was a kid. I really liked Sam Raimi's movies so I was a little hesitant when I heard it was being redone again with a new cast and crew. I soon found out I had nothing to be worried about. I loved The Amazing Spider-Man so much that I saw it 3 times in 3D and couldn't wait to order the blu-ray/dvd! With a superb cast and crew they far surpassed every expectation I had. For the first time you get a glimpse of Peter as a young boy with his parents. Martin Sheen & Sally Field are perfect as Uncle Ben & Aunt May. Andrew Garfield was amazing as he took on the role and made it his own. Yeah, they definately did right by Spidey and I personally hope it's the first of many with Andrew Garfield in the role. Also has great behind the scenes footage of making the movie which I always love to see. If you're a Spidey fan and don't have this yet, what are you waiting for?? Order it now!!",1355097600,,917,3.989130434782609

4421053,5,B004LWZWFQ,I am a huge fan of this item as a gift. I am not a fan of how many ads and previews they force you to watch or skip prior to getting to the movie. This isn't a free stream; i BOUGHT and OWN the movie!,1355097600,,200,3.369565217391304

I have enjoyed all of the other Spider-man movies and was not sure if this would live up to the others.  This movie had me laughing, on the edge of tears, and excited throughout the movie.  There are not many movies that I have watched that I have felt that way but this is one of them.",1355097600,,365,3.9054054054054053

4421107,4,B004LWZWFQ,I had to watch this movie twice. I really enjoyed this movie the second time around because I must not have payed attention to it as I should have the first time. There is a lot of action and the CGI is great. Would definitely recommend this movie.,1355097600,,248,4.1875
4421108,3,B004LWZWFQ,Good movie.  Enjoyed action and the story.  Problem is that it's just like all the other Spiderman movies.  All the same.  But good.,1355097600,,132,4.608695652173913
4421109,4,B004LWZWFQ,I gave this movie a rating of 4 only because I haven't seen it myself. It is a gift for Christmas and that is still 2 weeks away. What I can say is that there was no digital copy and I probably knew that before I bought it. Not a problem because my niece wouldn't know what to do with it. The time it took to get to me was great. Only took a few days. And not by UPS so I had no worries about it being left outside. And there were no scratches on the disk either. Have no desire to see this movie so I won't know anything more until my niece watches it.,1355097600,,553,3.735042735042735

4421112,4,B004LWZWFQ,"I enjoyed this new reboot to Spider-Man.  Andrew Garfield is a better actor to play the superhero than the old Tobey Maguire and the film surprisingly has a nice love story woven in between Garfield and Emma Stone's character.  As a result, I was able to derive more enjoyment from the film being an adult male in his 30s.  Sally Field is also great in the dramatic role of the concerned mother of Peter Parker.

One criticism I had were the special effects / cinematography could have been improved.  I found the main lizard villain (Dr, Connors) to be sparsely detailed in an animation sense.  The textures used just seemed flat to me if that makes sense.  Also, the colors in certain scenes seemed ""flat"" when they should have been saturated and vibrant perhaps.  This is only a minor gripe as the story was very entertaining.",1355011200,,829,4.63013698630137

4421164,3,B004LWZWFQ,"Has it really only been only five years since the last Tobey McGuire Spider-Man movie? And so with this new Spider-Man film, we're just supposed like that whole series didn't even happen? OK. Disney, could you please repeat this with the Star Wars prequels and give us the TRUE origin of Darth Vader?

Yes, Sony thinks you are dumb. Half of The Amazing Spider-Man or more was just a rehash of the first McGuire movie. Don't get me wrong, Disney appears to know what it's doing when it comes to making Marvel movies. They are making a ton of money. They have sequel upon sequel coming out. They have The Avengers 2. Iron Man 3. Thor 2. Black Widow? Captain America 2. Just throw movies at the wall and see what sticks. But the thing about all these Marvel movies is that while you are watching them, they really are entertaining...but afterwards, when you really start thinking about the experience, you realize how dumb they really are. Is anyone going to care about any of these movies in 20 years? I doubt it. To me, I really could not tell a big difference between Sony and Disney's treatment of Marvel characters.

But let's get back to Spider-Man. Peter Parker is a brilliant high school student played by the Hayden Christensen look alike Andrew Garfield who it appears has more acting chops than McGuire could ever dream of. In fact, he probably lays on the nerd schtick a little TOO thick. Apparently, his parents dumped him on the doorstep of his Uncle Ben and Aunt May's when he was a kid because their scientific research with radioactive spiders had put them in danger. Peter never saw them again. But when he finds an old briefcase containing his dad's research, he quickly links him to a geneticist named Curt Connors, who is currently working on cross species genetics. He even gives Dr. Connors a hand in moving his years long research to the next level, using lizard DNA to make 3 legged rats grow a new limb! Oh, and during the course of his visit, he also gets bitten by a radioactive spider AND plants the seeds for the movie's new villain, the Lizard!

Am I the only person in the world who just expresses a yawn over all the new Marvel movies? These characters are so old and worn out. Disney (also old and worn out) seems to think that just because you give Peter a touseled hairdo and some cool Nikes that it updates the character of Spider-Man. Peter also seemed to rely a little heavily on the internet to do his crime solving. Again, a pretty lame attempt at updating this 50 year old story.

Retreading the origin story again also was a little dull. But again, this movie was not for comic book fans. It was for the great unwashed masses who have never even touched a comic in their lives. Disney does not see Marvel comics as a money maker. Now, Marvel movies, that's a completely different proposition. They don't care about the dwindling numbers of readers of their overpriced books. They only see dollar signs in the movies that exploit the fans and the characters. Woe betide Star Wars. Sony, too, could care less about the comic franchise their movies are based on.

Andrew Garfield does a pretty good job imitating that skinny dude that I hate from Scott Pilgrim and that other dorky dude from Zombie Land, (which also starred Emma Stone). And when called on to really act in this movie, he succeeds admirably. Emma Stone seems poorly miscast as the stockings skirted Gwen Stacy because she looks about 35 years old in this movie. Martin Sheen does a good imitation of the Martin Sheen that he's always been along with the chick from Smokey and the Bandit who fill in for kinda surrogate parents for Peter, but really have no emotional space to work in except to worry about Peter.

I will say that this film was an improvement over the Sam Raimi films, but I don't know if that's saying much. I for sure did not miss the goofiness that is so inherent in all of Sam's movies. I will definitely give the sequel to  Amazing a shot, even though it will probably be the same villain origin-Spider Man fight to standoff-romantic complications-Big fight at end formula that is so true of all superhero movies these days. That's what made the second Batman Nolan movie so great. It worked at a very personal level, and wasn't so intent on the James Bondian destroy cities, take over the world mentality of other films of the costumed crimefighter ilk....Kickass would be another example of a comic movie done right.",1355011200,,4443,4.581132075471698

I am also a fan of Spiderman and was hoping to be `wowed' by this film.  And I was...for the action/ CGI sequences only.

This film proved that you can have a renowned cast (Martin Sheen, Sally Field, Dennis Leary, Emma Stone, and even C Thomas Howell) and special effects galore, but still miss that critical something that makes a film a masterpiece or even great.  Not once did I ever believe that Sheen was `Uncle Ben' or Field was `Aunt May'.  Stone was the `Saving Grace' of this film as she was completely believable as Gwen.  Leary was himself.  And as Peter, sorry Andrew, but you are no Tobey Maguire.  This film had plenty of action and CGI, but lacked the `humanity' that was so prevalent in the previous Spiderman films.  You do not need BIG NAME ACTORS to make a movie, but rather actors that act rather than `call in it'.

All in all, this film is a nice addition to the Spiderman Universe, but is by no means a replacement for the previous Spiderman movies that left its mark in the hearts of Spiderman Fans.",1354924800,6,1228,4.515837104072398

4421263,3,B004LWZWFQ,"After Sam Raimi released Spider-Man 3 to some incredibly lukewarm reception, Columbia Pictures and Sony decided to go back and reboot the series.  In taking a lesson from Warner Bros., Columbia Pictures found a relatively unknown indie director and opted to tell much darker and grittier story.  What Columbia Pictures seemed to miss about Batman Begins, however, is that it took more than that to make Batman Begins work.  The Amazing Spider-Man can pretty much be lobbed into the category of movies that had a lot of potential but just didn't live up to it.  That being said, there's a lot to like about The Amazing Spider-Man.  A great deal, in fact.  On the other hand, when you really get down deep, the film is just not that Amazing in the long run.

The advertising for this movie claims its the untold story.  And in some ways you might say so.  Peter's parents in this one were into some great experiments and they mysteriously go missing after dropping him off with Uncle Ben and Aunt May.  Years later, the disappearance is still a mystery and Peter is now a young high school student who has a crush on a girl named Gwen Stacey, and is totally interested in science.  When touring Oscorp (a tour by which he sneaks into) he is bitten by a radio active spider.  He also meets Doctor Conners, a man who is interested in gene splicing in hopes that he may one day be able to regrow his arm.  Unfortunately, his experiments go a little too far when he becomes a hulking lizard man.  And just his luck, a guy named Mr. Ratha has decided to stop funding him because he can't seem to find a cure for whatever ails Mr. Osbourne.  Parker has his own problems, of course.  Like a giant lizard terrorizing New York.

The Amazing Spider-Man has a great ensemble cast that is filled to the brim with a lot of likeable people.  And they all give it their all and it's pretty convincing stuff to some degree.  Likewise, the special effects, the fight scenes and the visuals are certainly eye-popping.  If anything The Amazing Spider-Man is fun from the standpoint that so much of the action will keep you entertained for the duration.  Not to mention there are some funny moments as well.

That being said, there's also a lot to nitpick at for those who are actually paying close attention to the story.  The movie is easy on the eyes with loads of action sequences, but a lot of the actual story feels very disjointed.  The problem with the action is that it feels disconnected from the rest of the story in a lot of ways.  And The Amazing Spider-Man seems to feel content at leaving plot threads hanging or just all out ignoring them.  It's not that the film doesn't provide closure on them, it's that they don't even bother to offer up ambiguity either.

The first is perhaps the simplest one.  Uncle Ben.  When it comes to Spider-Man one of the things that is really important is the Uncle Ben stuff.  The fact that the line, ""With great power comes great responsibility,"" is no where to be found is a little jarring.  But more than that it's how Uncle Ben is handled from just a simple character standpoint.  This is pretty much the reason Parker decides to fight crime in the first place.  To use his abilities with some responsibility.  Here that's pretty much thrown out the window.  Ben isn't killed because Parker was irresponsible with his abilities but rather because of Teen Angst.  That being it happens because he's being rebellious and not necessarily because he was sneaking off using his new found abilities for personal gain.  But it's not exactly that which is strange, it's more the idea that after a while the Uncle Ben plot just sort of stops.  Parker sets out to find his Uncle's killer, but then for no real reason he just stops looking.  The film doesn't really give much reason why.  And while we're sort of given this idea that the search continues, it's mostly just the fact that it's a plot thread that goes no where and is pretty much forgotten.  If there's one plot point you probably don't want to just gloss over in a Spider-Man origin story, it's definitely Uncle Ben and ""With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility.""

The second plot point that pretty much gets ignored is the Mr. Rafta thing.  When the Lizard first comes around and puts the guy in danger, Spidey comes in to save him... and then the movie just leaves this plot thread dangling (literally).  This is the guy who has shut Dr. Conners down.  When Conners becomes the lizard and goes after this man it's another plot point that pretty much stops.  The difference is that this one didn't seem like it was going very far in the first place.  But it's still a little odd that the movie clearly wants you to see this as something big.

Another plot thread that stops midway through is the whole mystery surrounding Parker's parents.  Granted it's quite clear this isn't over yet (as there will be a sequel and they'll probably add more to the mystery there) but again, the movie glosses over it like it's nothing big and just sort of forgets about it and moves on.  You don't see Parker expressing too much interest in what happens to his parents or anything like that either.  He finds something out about his father, but it never brings about question to Parker himself as to what exactly happened to his father.  The fact that the movie plays this up but it doesn't really do enough to show us that even Peter Parker is that interested.  And if the main character isn't that interested... do we the audience really have reason to be interested?

Which brings us to another thing that's really hard to look past.  The characters.  This isn't something that can really be blamed on the actors themselves, but more the writers.  The first and most painfully obvious is the Lizard Man.  Mostly because his motivations are paperthin.  It never becomes too clear as to why he actually wants to succeed in his ordeal at all.  More than that, it's also pretty sad because the movie does a little too much to bring about convenience for our hero and villain in this regard.  The only reason Peter as Spider-Man is able to find out what he's up to is because he happens across it on a computer that Conners as The Lizardman just so happens to leave open.  Not through any of his intelligence and skill, but rather because of convenient dumb luck in the plot.  Likewise, our villain only finds out that Peter Parker is Spider-Man because he just so conveniently left his camera in the bad guys hideout with a property of sticker on it.  There's no real dramatic tension through any this.  Remember in Raimi's Spider-Man the tension that was in that particular scene when it's clear that Harry Osbourne's father knows who Spider-Man is and happens to be sitting at the same table?  Parker isn't aware of this yet... but the audience is and we're sort of wondering how this will play out.  And it happens because Osbourne sees a cut on Parker... that he gave him.  This is what gives Parker away.  Not the villain conveniently seeing a piece of property labeled.  And that's just sort of takes away the tension in many respects.

That's not to say that the movie is saved by the main character.  And this may be where The Amazing Spider-Man is hardest hit.  One of the things that Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2 really helped establish is that there is a difference between the Peter Parker persona and the Spider-Man persona.  Peter Parker by himself is nothing more than a geeky, awkward teenager who manages to attract a few bullies and whatnot because of it.  That's generally how we've seen Parker in the past.  And I'm not really saying this in comparison to Raimi's film so much as it is that part of what makes the main character in most Super Hero movies stand out is that they ARE usually outcasts in some way, shape or form.  Here, Peter Parker doesn't have that.  Except for being awkward around ONE girl (Gwen Stacey) he is often not really that awkward or having a difficult time fitting in around school.  Sure he gets picked on by Flash, but Parker is already standing up to Flash before he gets his powers.  And once he gets them he sort of just uses them to be a jerk to Flash.  And while that much I'm okay with (however big a waste of time it is to see) it is the idea that once Parker gets his powers he never actually grows as a character by the end of the film.  And that's kind of a disappointing.  This mostly comes from the fact that Parker is kind of boring to begin with.  He's not exactly all that awkward.  He begins the film as a wise-cracking kind of guy.  He's not doing THAT behind a mask anymore.  There doesn't feel like much of a difference between the two personas anymore.  And while that's not quite as big to me, it does make him less interesting of a character.

This may also be why the love story feels a little odd as well.  Gwen Stacey is interested in Parker from the beginning.  There's not much in trying to win Gwen Stacey over here.  It's mostly just her being somewhat interested and then eventually becoming fully interested.  It's not as though Parker just ""isn't being noticed,"" by a girl he likes or anything like that.  They don't even grow on one another.  It just so happens that at one point you just accept that they like each other and that they should fall in love... because that's what the trope dictates.  But they don't naturally progress to that point as characters.  And in some movies this can be kind of charming, but in The Amazing Spider-Man it only serves to pass up another moment in which the writers could've made Parker grow as a character.  Or, if anything, to sort of reiterate that with great power comes great responsibility.  But nothing of the sort happens here.  Peter Parker is the same character at the end of the movie that he was at the beginning.  The point is simple: Peter Parker lacks depth.  And it just doesn't make him as interesting of a character.

There are a few other small gripes as well.  Perhaps the only other one worth mentioning is that the film's tone seems to clash at times.  There are funny moments in The Amazing Spider-Man but other times you feel like it's trying to be way too serious.  The movie will crack a joke and then it almost seems to clear its throat as if to say, ""But there's no time for joking; we're trying to be serious here!""  You almost get the sense they're trying really hard to make their reboot as glorifying as Batman Begins was in 2005.  But again, I'm not sure they understand that Batman Begins also had a pretty good story that had a main character who, above everything, actually grows.  Batman Begins also didn't leave quite as many dangling plot threads.  The movie wants to be taken seriously and be seen as ""darker"" while it also seems to try and be as goofy as the 2002 film was back in the day.  It's got some funny moments, but the movie tries to move on from them pretty quickly so that it can get back to be serious.  It's like that guy in the meeting who is trying to hold back a laugh at times.

All this seems to encompass a movie that simply doesn't have that much focus.  It's certainly a lot of fun to watch the action moments, but each time when you're reminded that it's supposed to have a story it's hard to ignore the dangling plot threads and the fact that the main character never really grows... in a genre where you expect the main character to grow.  You might have some fun, but just the same here's to hoping the sequel isn't afraid to reach a little higher.",1354924800,,11504,4.483870967741935
4421264,4,B004LWZWFQ,"I really didn't want to like this.  I thought it was odd that there was another Spider-Man being made with another actor so soon, yet I couldn't help but enjoy watching this.  It's a little darker and more dramatic than the Tobey Maguire series.  This one takes a lot longer for Peter Parker to transition into Spider-Man, but I didn't mind the actual build of the story and getting to know who he is beforehand.  We actually get a glimpse of who is parents were.  His Aunt and Uncle who take him in are more realistic than the ones in the previous Spider-Man's.  This movie in general was more realistic in that it seemed to be focused on what would happen if someone really did turn into Spider-Man.  The two leads, Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, are actually in their late 20's and yet they play High School teens, but hey it seems to work.  There is no Mary Jane, but there is a Gwen played by Emma Stone.  Gwen is much stronger and more hands on than Mary Jane who is more on the meeker, naive side waiting to be saved.  Gwen dives right in and does it herself and even helps Spider-Man in fighting the bad guy and in saving the world.  This update probably needed to be made to ad in our heavy use of cell phones these days.  This was better than Spider-Man 3 and maybe even Spider-Man 1, but Spider-Man 2 still holds the crown.  This ""Amazing Spider-Man"" still holds its own as its own separate movie and is just as good as the original Tobey Maguire one.

The main character of Peter Parker has more angst due to the fine performance of Andrew Garfield. This angst is much more in line with the original comic books from Marvel. Peter is highly conflicted about his duties as a budding crime fighter, and for his efforts he is labeled a criminal by the police and news media. I was surprised initially to hear Garfield was going to take the main role, but after viewing the film and seeing the unique style he adds to the Spider-Man character, I am completely sold. He has a wiry physique that fits the Spider-Man character perfectly. Garfield is able to hit those iconic poses shown in the comics version. I thoroughly enjoy Emma Stone in everything she does. She fills her role well, and is definitely not the helpless damsel in distress type. I just don't care for her blonde look that she has been adopting lately.

4421469,4,B004LWZWFQ,"I always enjoyed the first two Sam Raimi Spider-Man movies. The third film had a lot to live up to with great hype, but while it made the money it failed to please a lot of fans (myself included). The way that movie ended it would seem hard to continue an entertaining enough story, and I doubt many would care to see where it. So, probably to hold onto the rights of this money making franchise, Sony Pictures decided to reboot Spider-Man and try again. Not a bad thing in my book.

In a nutshell I liked this new movie more than the last, but I'm unsure if it was better than the original trilogies first two films. I feel there's a lot I liked and equally some things not so much.

Peter Parker seems more like an actual ""today's nerd"" high school student genius (making webshooters) rather than a thirty-something year old pretending to be young (sorry Toby you'd be more the later years Spidey). I really liked that we get Gwen Stacy (played by the lovely Emma Stone) before MJ in Peters life. I also found using his parents an interesting sub-plot, and something worth exploring. Finally we get to see Doc Connors turn into The Lizard, and maybe that's worth the reboot right there.

Whats not so hot is there's time I felt the story seemed rush or missing scenes--something, I don't know what! The musical score, I did not enjoy like how I do in other superhero films. In fact the score during the fight scene with The Lizard in the high school felt out of place, as if the music was meant for another scene. It took me out of the scene, a theatrical ""no no."" The Lizard looked more like Killer Croc from Batman than from Spider-Man. Not entirely a bad design, but too human perhaps in the face. Spidey, hang up that cell phone and leave your mask on! Studio's need to get a grip with superheroes and masks already. I actually think its the biggest downer of this film. Leave. Your. Mask. On!!! The CG that Sony studios use is kind of cartoon-ish compared to other films which use heavy CG in my book.

I could probably go on with likes and dislikes, but its important to remember that overall I enjoyed it enough to buy the BD and curious what lies ahead in the sequels.

Visually the blu-ray looks pretty stunning. I can't comment on the 3D quality since I missed out on the last sale of the combo that included it, and I guess that's fine by me.

The seller is great. The movie is AWESOME.

So, what's the problem?

The problem is that I purchased this particular combo set for this movie for one reason; to have it on my iPhone.  Typically UltraViolet digital copies will as you if you want to add this to your iTunes library, but not SONY UltraViolet.  For there's you have to watch it streaming (if you have internet access) or download it with their Sony Download Manager and watch it thru their software.  This is not to say that it's not available on iTunes, because it is.  You can purchase The Amazing Spider-Man from iTunes and watch it on your phone.

When I called Sony demanding a code for iTunes, all I got was, ""I'm sorry we are two separate entities and my hands are tied.""  The did offer to send me a shipping label so I could send my copy back to them and they would send me an unopened copy so I could take it to a store and ""return"" it.  If I were to do that I could use the credit to purchase an iTunes gift card and use that to purchase my movie in the iTunes store...but I wouldn't have a Blu-ray copy.",1354492800,6,1188,4.258928571428571

I didn't understand the point of switching to those being an invention if they weren't going to go into some of the disadvantages/advantages of that difference.

4421655,4,B004LWZWFQ,"This is a well crafted movie with a solid plot, interesting technology and likeable characters. I don't entirely understand why they keep re-making superhero movies every year, however, I will say that I like this Spiderman better than the other one and I would watch the next one.

There are just some clichs about super heros that might be impossible to change.

1. They always need some sort of monster to fight in the end because humans are just too weak for them.
2. The cops will be against him at first.
3. There will be a young woman involved that he won't be allowed to be with.
4. And it's a re-boot, so a lot of things are going to be a repeat.

So if you can tolerate the cliches and like super heros this movie is for you.

I liked Gwen (the young lady) and I thought they would work well as a team. She was involved in the plot and was key in preventing a disaster. Then I was frustrated that he couldn't be with her in the end, but there was a hint that he might. I also thought Peter held out too long as far as telling his long suffering mother that he was Spiderman. In fact, he never said it, but she had to come to that conclusion on her own. So at times Peter saw people suffering because he wouldn't tell them the truth and he just wouldn't speak. This was a bit frustrating.

Overall, I liked the characters and felt the strength of the movie was the detail they went into about how Peter became Spiderman.",1354406400,2,1429,4.200729927007299
4421656,1,B004LWZWFQ,"Over the last few years, Hollywood has been slowly murdering really excellent comic book characters through really terrible movies. These movies generally play and sound as if they are written by 8th graders for 8th graders.  The Amazing Spider-Man is no exception. Here were my complaints.

1. Characters that were not compelling.  I felt no emotional attachment whatsoever with any of them.  The acting was stilted.  The casting was ok, and Martin Sheen as Uncle Ben should have been great.  Dennis Leary was a potentially good choice for the police commissioner, but he seemed entirely restrained during the film. Gotta lay this one squarely at the director's feet.

2. The dialogue sounded like it was written by a high schooler (or rather, cut and pasted from other movies by a high-schooler).  While the 2002 Spider-Man had a few fun one-liners and never really took itself too seriously, this movie lacked the same tongue-in-cheek feel and therefore fell on its face.

3. Zero subtlety.  As we inch every closer to Mike Judge's prophetic ""Idiocracy,"" Hollywood apparently regards subtlety as the greatest sin of all. Everything is served up with a heaping portion of obviousness. No need to draw any conclusions here.

4. Idiotic cliches.  With the way that Hollywood uses the computer or 'algorithm' device as a common ""deus ex machina,"" it makes me wonder whether anyone in southern California even owns a computer.  Talking countdowns, announcing at convenient times that ""45 seconds until detonation"" and then ""30 seconds until detonation"" - these devices are perfectly fun...in Austin Powers.

5. Nobody uses Bing!  I wonder how much MS paid to feature Bing as Peter Parker's ""go-to"" search application of choice?  Please. One of a thousand tiny cuts ruining suspension of disbelief.

6. Insultingly bad plot oversights.  Seriously, Peter Parker couldn't Google (er...ahem... ""Bing"") his own dad before he found a series of documents in the basement?

Bottom line:
Strip away the special effects (which themselves felt sort of cheap), and all you have left is 2 hours of excellent ridicule fodder for Mystery Science Theater 3000.

Why must it be so?:
Why is it so difficult to create a great action movie about a fantasy hero with a tight plot and smart dialogue?  Why must these two things always be at odds?",1354406400,25,2322,5.041994750656168
4421697,4,B004LWZWFQ,"As a reboot, it is only natural that this film is based on an origin story--how does Peter Parker acquire his spider abilities and what consequences emerge from the choices he makes (or doesn't make)? With that being said, what stands out about this film compared to Sam Raimi's trilogy is that the story is character driven and not an expansive set of expensive CGI moments with some acting.

Andrew Garfield fits the role of Spider-Man better than Tobey Maguire, who despite being a very good actor, never seemed entirely comfortable as the web-slinger. Compared to Maguire's sarcasm that felt too dry and uninspired, his semi-robotic disposition, his awkwardly forced chemistry with Kirsten Dunst, Garfield's Spider-Man feel likes an entirely different character--a natural fit. On screen, he steals the show and with Emma Stone on board as Gwen Stacy, a new romance blossoms that is thoroughly entertaining to watch.

For those who enjoy the massive scale action of The Avengers, the previous Spider-Man films, X-Men, etc., the Amazing Spider-Man will feel like a let down. That is not to say that the action sequences are not well done, but they are not the focal point of the film. However, the CGI has come a long way since Raimi's films and Spider-Man's movements in this film feel more fluid, less jarring, and more agile--should I say, more spider-like?

The current film is not without flaws. Don't get me wrong, but I could have done with a Teen Wolf (Michael J. Fox inspired) basketball scene and compared to the rest of the casting, Denis Leary's police chief was just too utterly predictable and didn't leave anything up the imagination.

Although the story feels fresh, there are several instances where the script feels too generic, perhaps constrained by the limitations of this film being an origin. Nevertheless, in the next installment I hope the writers can take more creative liberties because with the current ensemble, they have the potential to make one of the best comic book films of all time. As it stands, The Amazing Spider-Man is a better film than any of the previous Spider-Man films.",1354320000,,2118,4.957746478873239

However, I purchased the movie because I thought it was so much better than the original three. The actors were far better and suiting to their roles which made it so enjoyable for me. I must admit though I am a Spiderman fan so this review is very biased.",1354320000,,513,4.14
4421701,5,B004LWZWFQ,"This movie, like the Spider-man comic, has the heart that makes the character so great and separates it from so many other superheroes.

Comparing this movie to the previous films is like comparing Batman Begins to the Batman Schumacher films and for me and for me, ASM is much better.  I didn't see this movie in the theater because I'm burnt out on origins and was excited for this, I should have seen it in the theaters.  Amazing Spider-man brings a huge plus to the franchise that has not yet been done (in my opinion) and that is believable emotion.

The interaction between the characters and the acting from the actors feels like it makes sense and is something that is very real as opposed to cliche situations that are trying to mimic what happened in comic world.  I've read Lee and Ditko and I do not want to see that pulled directly onto the screen because it doesn't work as well.

Parker's evolution is fantastic.  It's a transformation that felt genuine and made the moment when Peter embraces his responsibility so much more believable and therefore more meaningful and rewarding.

The character work is fantastic and where the movie lacks in with larger set pieces.  Spider-man's action sequences use his powers and webbing creatively but lack and kinetic energy.  The fighting is more background noise rather exciting.  The sequences lacked the tension they could have had but were still fun and definitely did not detract from the movie enough to knock it down from its ""Amazing"" status.",1354320000,,1506,4.7984496124031

4421705,4,B004LWZWFQ,"For generations, many children, teens and adults have grown-up reading ""The Amazing Spider-Man"".  The Marvel Comics series was created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko back in 1963 and in December 2012, will end it's run (the series will be temporarily replaced with a new series titled ""Superior Spider-Man"" as part of the Marvel NOW! line).

But many people have grown up with Spider-Man, may it be the comic books, video games, animated series, live action series and in the last decade, treated with three live -action films directed by Sam Raimi.

But one thing that Marvel Comics have done for new generation of readers was to create an Ultimate Line featuring a story that has little similarity to the original history of a character or group, but revised for a modern audience, with a modern storyline.

And while the three Sam Raimi films were blockbuster films that made a lot of money, it would end as a trilogy as the success of the films would set a pretty high price tag to retain filmmaker Sam Raimi and its main cast. also, the price tag for the original cast to continue in the films was quite high.  And the budget for the films were also quite high.

So, how to get away from that high price tag?  Reboot the film series and making it different from the original storyline using modern elements.

And so, we have ""The Amazing Spider-Man"", a film directed by Marc Webb (""(500) Days of Summer) and a screenplay by James Vanderbilt (""Zodiac"", ""The Losers"", ""The Rundown""), Alvin Sargent (writer for ""Spider-Man 2, ""Spider-Man 3, ""Unfaithful"") and Steve Kloves (""Harry Potter"" films, ""The Fabulous Baker Boys"").

The film would star Andrew Garfield (""The Social Network"", ""The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus""), Emma Stone (""The Help"", ""Easy A"", ""Zombieland""), Rhys Ifans (""Notting Hill"", ""Anonymous"", ""Little Nicky""), Denis Leary (""Rescue Me"", ""Ice Age""), Martin Sheen (""The West Wing"", ""Apocalypse now"", ""The Departed"") and Sally Field (""Forest Gump"", ""Brothers and Sisters"", ""Mrs. Doubtfire"").

VIDEO:

""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1 aspect ratio).  And as one can expect, this film looks absolutely magnificent on Blu-ray.  Everything from the detail of Spider-Man's costume, detail on the strands of webbing to the beautiful skyline and of course, character close-ups, the film looks absolutely gorgeous.  Even the shots from high above the city looking down towards Spider-Man and just the overall look and environment looks believable and breathtaking.  Black levels are inky and deep, skin tones are natural and if anything, videophiles will no doubt love how ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" looks on Blu-ray!

It is important to note that there is a 3D release of the film on Blu-ray (not included with the Blu-ray+DVD+UltraViolet version).

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is presented in English, French, Portuguese 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, Chinese, Thai 5.1 Dolby Digital.  And as one can expect from this film, filled with many action-packed scenes, the lossless soundtrack sounds magnificent and is truly immersive.

The use of surround is done remarkably well.  From Spider-Man shooting out his web, swinging through the city to Peter Parker being thrown around by the Lizard to getting into a fight with Flash, the dialogue and special effects are crystal clear and good use of surround sound usage and LFE.

But also equally impressive is James Horner's music for the film.  There are tracks that just captivate you, such as the wonderful ""The Ganali Device"" which showcases James Horner's piano playing.  But you will also have the action-driven sequence  upbeat tracks such as ""The Bridge"", ""Lizard at School!"", ""Saving New York"" (which was an effective style of James Horner to use the piano in such a way).

For the most part, James Horner is a master in creating beautiful music, emotional music.  From his orchestral direction, his use of piano, voice utilization, the music for ""The Amazing Spider-Man is original and manages to be different than Elfman's ""Spider-Man"" compositions.

Similar to the film, the soundtrack for ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is emotional and he builds upon each track that it begins to grow on you and you find yourself enjoying the soundtrack even more.

But I have to say that this is one of the most original soundtracks when it comes to how the piano is utilized.  But at the same time, aiming for beauty, aiming for emotion, there is not a score that  found that sticks out, a track that I found memorable.

Subtitles are in English, English SDH, Chinese (Mandarin Traditional), Chinese (Mandarin Mandarin Simplified), Chinese (Mandarin Traditional), English (US), French (Canadian), French (Parisian), Indonesian / Bahasa, Korean, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish (Latin Am) and Thai.

JUDGMENT CALL:

As a child who grew up reading and enjoying Spider-Man fan, from being introduced to the comic books at a young age and having collected (and recently sold) decades of Spider-Man comic books and toys that I collected over the years, I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical of a new Spider-Man film, especially a film not so long after the third film of Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man"" trilogy.

Being familiar with what Marvel Comics have done to modernize the character(s) for their films, especially to bring in a new generation of fans not so familiar with the comic books, let alone the ever changing storylines of the character, I look at this reboot as a way of meeting older and newer fans half-way with the classic Spider-Man and the new Ultimate version of Spider-Man, but with newer technology of today, bringing Peter Parker and Spider-Man to the modern age.

And while I know hardcore fans can easily get dismayed with how Hollywood tends to give their own version of super heroes and their origin, personally, I don't think anyone should be too shocked by now, considering how different other superhero films have been compared to the comic books.  You're just just not going to get a 100% faithful film adaptation.  And it's best to come into watching a film based on popular superhero and just accepting that things will be different, while some things will be similar but most importantly, how effective the story will be be, especially the superhero itself.

""The Avengers"" and even the recent Dark Knight (Batman) films have shown how these films could be exciting, well-written and enjoyable.  So, can ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" right?

For ""Spider-Man"" fans who are trying to forget the third Sam Raimi ""Spider-Man"" film, fortunately, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" manages to incorporate a good balance between the old and the new.

First, let's talk about the storyline.  The evergoing battle between Spider-Man and the Lizard has been ongoing for so long in the comic books. A good choice for antagonist but it's also a good way to show a connection Oscorp Industries because of this Peter Parker/Gwen Stacy storyline.

But one thing that was never introduced in the original comic books was Peter Parker's parents.  It became more of a bigger topic in the '90s when Marvel introduced this nonsense of clones, but for the film, I actually enjoyed how they brought in the parents, made things a mystery and unlike the comic books, trying not to have this Weapon X connection.  While it's too early to see how this plays out, I'm glad the subject was introduced into this film.

As a ""Spider-Man"" fan, while the Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson storyline (and their happiness as a couple to a married couple) will always be important in the life of Peter Parker, what is also important is the relationship between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy.

Before Peter Parker and Mary Jane, the story of Gwen Stacy has always been important in the Spider-Man universe because Peter Parker will truly learn about the great responsibility he has of being a super-hero.  While a lot of us who have read the comic book series, pretty much knows what will happen to Gwen Stacy, I felt that the writers did a good service for fans by making Gwen the counterpart to Peter Parker.

""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a film that tries to make compromises with both classic and modern versions.  While Peter Parker is seen as a non-popular guy in ""The Amazing Spider-Man"", gone is the science nerd with glasses.  Also, modern technology plays a big part of the film.

I've always wondered how a high school student would effectively create powerful webs with the technology used back in the '60s but at least with ""The Amazing Spider-Man"", Peter Parker utilizing technology from Oscorp Industries, makes sense.

I actually like the costume design for ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" this time around and with the always change in technology, the special effects for ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" looks absolutely fantastic.  When you see Spider-Man swinging from building to building, you can feel the height and was quite pleased with how technology has improved since the release of the past ""Spider-Man"" trilogy.

But it's the characters that really brought a lot heart and soul to the film.  Andrew Garfield may not look super nerdy but he played the part of Peter Parker quite effectively.  Different from Tobey Maguire's portrayal of Spider-Man, I felt that Garfield brought a positive, cool vibe to the character that fans can sympathize for.

Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy was fantastic!  Just the final scene alone with Peter Parker, just the look in her eyes and the smile she gives, is more than enough to make me feel that the right person was cast for the role!

And while Sally Field may not look like the elderly Aunt May that was portrayed in the comic books, to have Sally Field and Martin Sheen play Uncle Ben and Aunt May was another positive when it comes to casting.  Both also did a wonderful job.

And last, Denis Leary did a wonderful job of playing Captain Stacy.  You need a man with attitude to play the role and he nailed it!

As for the primary antagonist, while Rhys Ifans did a great job with Dr. Curt Connors, I was a little iffy when it came to the Lizard's design.  I wanted to see more the protruding snout that was seen of the character in the comic books with the razor sharp fangs and hissing long tongue.  He looked more like an alien from out of space or swamp creature than the Lizard that I was hoping to see.

But I felt the writers did a wonderful job of separating this reboot from the Sam Raimi trilogy.  And because Gwen Stacy is the love of Peter Parker in this film, one can only wonder how things will playout in the second film.

But overall, I felt that Marc Webb was able to craft a different kind of Spider-Man film that although not 100% faithful to the comic book series, does a magnificent job in capturing those important elements and is able to take the plot and entertain audiences of today!

And with newer technology for CG and special effects, the film looks very fluid during the more action-intense sequences and it played to this film's overall efficacy.

Speaking of technology, for the Blu-ray release, it's important to note that there are two versions out on Blu-ray.  One includes the 3D version of the film, while this Blu-ray release features the film via Blu-ray, DVD and UltraViolet.

The Blu-ray is bundled with many special features and the picture quality and lossless audio is fantastic!  Video and audiophiles should be pleased with this Blu-ray release.

""The Amazing Spider-Man"" was a risky film to reboot, not long after the original ""Spider-Man"" trilogy had ended.  But with over 60-years of comic book history, there is a lot of Spider-Man stories to be told.  And one of those most significant storylines involve Spider-Man and Gwen Stacy.

While Spider-Man fans know how much of an impact Gwen Stacy had on Peter Parker's life through the comic books, what better than to bring these two characters and put them in the forefront of this Marvel reboot.  Where the Sam Raimi films did a lot of experimentation of Spider-Man, the superhero, especially his relationship with Mary Jane Watson.

Also, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" manages to take the character to a more modern setting and for the most part, the technology behind Peter Parker's web shooters to the modern technology utilized in his suit, now makes sense.  But it was important to make that distinction of how Peter Parker, a science whiz, was able to incorporate this technology for Spider-Man.  You have to have that connection and that connection is with Oscorp Industries and if you have Oscorp, comic fans know what hopefully, the future of this film series will lead to.

""The Amazing Spider-Man"" may not be the most faithful film when it comes to film adaptation from the original comic books, but then again, not many superhero films are.

Overall, the film turned out to be much more exciting, much more deeper than I was expecting.  And every ounce of skepticism that I once had, was no longer there.  Sure, I enjoyed ""The Avengers"" much, much more than ""The Amazing Spider-Man"", but I have to admit that I enjoyed this film much more than any of the three Sam Raimi films.  I felt the way the characters were handled, was much more effective.

Especially the handling of the Peter's parents but also this new, fresh and cool vibe with its characters utilizing modern technology and setting.  Everything seemed right!  The technology seemed right!  And with the solid performances by its characters with a much more entertaining storyline, there is no doubt in my mind that this is the best ""Spider-Man"" film yet!

I absolutely enjoyed ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" and I loved this Blu-ray release for its wonderful PQ, AQ and the special features galore!

Highly recommended!",1354320000,,16102,4.995872420262664

It has slick special effects, a solid script, some humor and a good music score by James Horner. Director Marc Webb directs. Andrew Garfield plays Peter Parker/Spiderman and Emma Stone plays Gwen Stacy. This Spiderman installment takes place before Parker meets Mary Jane and J. Jonah Jameson. To be frank, I've only read a few Spiderman comic books in my lifetime. Martin Sheen was cast as Uncle Ben and Sally Field was cast as Aunt May. The first hour of the film retells Peter Parker's origin story and the second half shows Spiderman fighting Dr. Curt Connors/The Lizard. Stan Lee makes a cameo in the film. In this Spiderman movie, Spiderman wears a bright, red and blue spandex suit and he uses artifical webshooters. Andrew Garfield gives a sincere performance as Peter Parker and Spiderman. Emma Stone's version of Gwen Stacy is intelligent and proactive and not just eye candy. Denis Leary plays Gwen's father, Captain Stacy.

4421850,3,B004LWZWFQ,"WARNING: MINOR SPOILERS BELOW!!

I liked The Amazing Spiderman. I really did.
It's a good movie.

But let's get three things out of the way:

1. THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN IS NOT MORE ACCURATE TO THE COMICS THAN SAM RAIMI'S SUPERIOR SPIDER-MAN.

The Amazing Spiderman is as UNFAITHFUL as a comic book movie can be to the source material. As shown in The Amazing Spider-Man #6 (1963), Dr. Curtis Connors was a heroic war veteran who's arm was injured in an explosion and had to be amputated.
He became driven to invent a serum based on reptile DNA that would enable amputee's limbs to grow back. After much experimenting, he finally found the right serum and tested it on himself.

For a while the serum worked, but it had a side effect: it turned Dr. Connors into a green-skinned, immensely powerful Reptilian-Humanoid monster. Dr. Connors slowly lost his human characteristics, and fled from his wife and son into the Florida Everglades.
Peter Parker is sent by J. Jonah Jameson to get press coverage of the disappearance of the doctor.  Learning about his plight by the doctors wife and son, Peter uses his scientific expertise to concoct a serum that will turn The Lizard back into Curtis Connors. Spider-Man tracks the Lizard to his hideout in the Everglades, and the the two battle each other. In a scene now considered iconic, Spider-Man rams the serum down the Lizards throat as the two fall down a well.

Stan Lee and Steve Ditko wrapped up a brilliant story on a positive note. Curtis Connors is restored to his human health, and Peter Parker gets paid for his troubles by Jolly Jonah Jameson.

Some Inaccuracies:
Dr. Curtis Connors was all American, not British (or Welsh, in the case of Rhys Ifans). He did not know Peter Parkers father, nor did he ever enter New York in the original storyline. He did not work at Oscorp.
Peter Parker: See below.
Gwen Stacy was not Peter Parker's first love interest. Mary Jane was.

2. ANDREW GARFIELD IS NOT A BETTER SPIDER-MAN OR PETER PARKER THEN TOBEY MAGUIRE.

There is a reason why Spider-Man is the greatest superhero ever written: because he is relatable. He suffers like we do; he is considered a nerd, he doesn't get the girl, he is beaten up at school, he is bullied, he has continual bad luck, he lives with his aunt. He isn't a billionaire playboy like Tony Stark or Bruce Wayne. He isn't an alien like Superman, or a Super-Soldier like Captain America.
Peter Parker is an ordinary, powerless person who had greatness thrust upon him. He did not want that greatness. He did not deserve it. It was pure chance that the spider bit Peter and not Flash Thompson.

It is that emotional side, that moving ordinariness that worked so well in Raimi's Spider-Man. The brilliant scene in Spider-Man 2 where Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker says to Uncle Ben, ""I'm Spider-Man...no more,"" and other scenes like it that elevate it to greatness.

The Amazing Spiderman contains none of that.
Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man is indeed dark. There is no reason why he shouldn't know a few forms of martial arts. He does not look like a geek, or talk like a geek.
He gets the girl in the first hour of the film. If you recall Raimi's film, Spider-Man kisses Mary Jane while hanging upside down in a now iconic kissing scene. That is virtually all the kissing in the film. Even two films later their relationship is just beginning.

That is what made us feel for Peter: the fact that he could beat up criminals and swing through the air, but he could not attend Mary Jane's concert.
In the comics, there is an extremely powerful image of Betty Brant looking at a receding Peter Parker, who she had just rejected. Arms outspread, keeping them from being together, is an image of Spider-Man. Brilliant!

In the Amazing Spider-Man Peter Parker not only gets the girl rather easily, but he reveals his secret identity to about a dozen people. That's not a bad thing, but I'm just pointing it out.

3. THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN IS INFERIOR TO RAIMI'S SPIDER-MAN.
The Amazing Spider-Man contains almost none of the earnestness, the emotion, the brightness, the classic action, and color of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man Trilogy. In trying to distance itself from it, they had to create something dark and somewhat messy. This is now known as ""The Christopher Nolan Treatment."" See&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dark-Knight/dp/B001OGWY1W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dark Knight</a>

There are numerous plot holes: ""The Untold Story"" remains...untold! We still do not know what happened to Parker's parents, where they are, or where they went. What happened to Curt Connors, or who talked to him in the prison cell - was it Norman Osborn? How will Gwen Stacy's family survive without George Stacy, and how can Peter and Aunt May survive without Peter's job at the Daily Post? Why was a Doomsday machine sitting unguarded in the middle of an office?
How did Curt Connors lose his arm? These and other questions remain unanswered.

The most iconic line in Raimi's Spider-Man is ""With great power comes great responsibility."" This line has since passed into popular culture and is a brilliant representation of Peter's predicament - ""Some have greatness thrust upon them."" With The Amazing Spiderman, Sheen's Uncle Ben had to resort to saying something along the lines of: ""Your father used to say, if a man had great power it was his responsibility to use it.""

I guess the good material was already taken.
...
Sadly, The Amazing Spider-Man contains nothing of the style, atmosphere, character development, humor, or themes of the comics.

4. PROS.
But the Amazing Spiderman is not without its moments. Some are quite moving, in fact.

On the comedic side, there is a memorable Stan Lee cameo, and there are several funny scenes with Peter Parker breaking everything in the house with his new ""power"".

On the more serious side, there is a moving moment where Dr. Connors places his one arm in front of a mirror, giving the illusion that he has two arms. In my opinion it is a beautiful moment of longing and regret.
By far best scene of the film occurs when a wounded, un-masked Peter Parker swings from crane to crane above a busy street, while the crane operators (who aligned their machines for him) look on in admiration, curiosity, or respect.
It is a stunning, powerful scene, that equals if not rivals certain set pieces from Raimi's trilogy.

Other good scenes include a talk between Martin Sheen's Uncle Ben and Peter Parker, where the uncle says ""Your father used to say, if a man had great power it was his responsibility to use it,"" and *SPOILER* Captain George Stacy's last stand against the Lizard. Come to think about it, the action scenes were all half-decent!

...

In conclusion, the Amazing Spiderman has plenty of flaws.
But it is, indeed, amazing!

4421854,2,B004LWZWFQ,i downloaded this but it didn't work so i got it from netflix.  I liked the movie though.  Different from what I expected,1354060800,,121,4.217391304347826
4421855,4,B004LWZWFQ,"Ugh, this is such a hard movie to review.

While I was watching this on a theater, I was loving it.  I was cheering and laughing, I was excited and inmersed.  But, after I left the theater, I felt empty.  I felt as if the movie didn't make an impact on me.  I didn't think it was a bad film, it just wasn't a memorable one.

I really liked Raimi's films, even the third one (which I feel is unjustly treated), and, for better or worse, those movies were memorable.  There are scenes in them I always keep on my mind, and on my heart.  Sure, they were purposely cheesy, sometimes unnervingly, but they were lovable and entertaining and they felt true to the characters.  I was mad at them ending for a reboot made for the wrong reasons, but after a while I kept an open mind and accepted it.

Now, let's talk about this film.  The actors are, for the most part, well chosen.  The obvious issue comes from Garfield.  He's a great actor, yes, but in some scenes you can really tell he's three decades old, which sort of kills the mood.  Emma Stone is as good and adorable as always as Gwen.  Martin Sheen plays the perfect uncle Ben.  He doesn't say ""With great power comes great responsibility"", but then again, neither did he in the original comic.  Rhys Ifans makes an OK Dr. Connors, but the script has problems he can't solve.  Sally Fields is wasted as Aunt May, she's almost an afterthought, since you barely see her.  Denis Leary as Captain Stacy is one of the highlights, as he has good character motives and he's quite the badass.

The costume designs are hit and miss.  I'm not a fan of Spidey's costume for the same reason I wasn't a fan of the costume in Raimi's films: it's too pretty.  It's supposed to be handmade by a teenager, it shouldn't look that great.  But I suppose that's a matter of personal preference.  I'm not a fan of the silver lines either.  Alex Ross makes a fantastic rendition of the homemade costume in Marvels, and it makes Spidey look more heroic.  Anyway, The Lizard... well, that's a problem.  I understand the choice of not giving him a muzzle, as it goes well with his first appereance in the comics, but the eyes... they're too human.  I understand what they were going for, but there's no reason to humanize a monster that regularly turns back into a human.  That being said, the skin and its wrinkles are wonderfully designed.

The special effects are great.  They're quite better than in the original trilogy, and while you can easily tell the Lizard is CGI, most of the time the CGI Spidey is unnoticeable from the real one, and the same goes for CGI objects.  I didn't care for the 3D in theaters and I didn't purchase the 3D Blu Ray, so I don't know how it looks on the disc, but I don't think it will look any better.  Not that I think it would improve the movie at all.

The script is the real foe here.  The movie is too obvious, as if the writers thought the audience would be too stupid.  There's also the token guy who tries too hard to be hated by the audience, the lack of a good introduction for Spidey, the characters being too dumb to realize the obvious truth about the others, the lack of responsibility from Spidey's part (even though that's supposed to be his main theme), the fact that they take absolutely no advantage of the mechanical web-shooters (seriously, infinite webbing), the fact that Dr. Connors' family is nowhere to be seen (despite that being a very important part of his character) and he behaves too much like the Green Goblin, and all that about ""The untold story"" remaining untold throughout the entire film.  And then there's the scene with the cranes...  That is wrong for so many reasons.

That being said, this movie does handle a couple of things better.  The character of Flash Thompson is very well handled and actually matures.  The relationship between Peter and Gwen is great.  Spidey actually jokes this time.  Weirdly enough, though, the opinions of Gwen and George Stacy about Spidey are inverted from the ones in the comics.  That's not a complaint, it's just... weird.  And this is probably the best Stan Lee cameo to date.

Why the 4 stars review?  As I said before, I don't think it's a bad film.  It's entertaining and engaging, it just won't leave a mark on you.

About the Blu Ray:  The quality is fantastic, both in video and audio.  I haven't seen all the extras yet, but the ones I've watched are quite interesting.  There are a bunch of conceptual art and models for Spider-Man and The Lizard.  Some deleted scenes, including one in which post-injection Dr. Connors talks to his son Billy (why was this deleted?) and some details about how some scenes were filmed, which will surprise you when they show you how some things you believed to be real were actually CGI.

As an aside, this movie comes with a spanish (latin american) dub audio track, despite the fact that the Amazon page doesn't mention it.",1354060800,2,4909,4.487005649717514
4421856,5,B004LWZWFQ,Great job with this movie.  I don't really like the fact that there is no Mary Jane though.  She is an integral part of the Spider Man story and I think it was short sighted to leave her out.,1354060800,,191,3.871794871794872

4421890,2,B004LWZWFQ,"The first three Spiderman films were fresh and original, unlike this sub-par remake. Average acting, a weak plot, and too much CGI all contributed to produce a Dollar Theater popcorn flick at best.",1354060800,,197,5.0
4421891,4,B004LWZWFQ,"The story arch of this new spiderman series looks to be more realistic, and less mela-dramatic. However this movie suffers at time with poor pacing. By the time you get to the end for the final battle, one can start to feel ""when is this over..""

More so the final battle seemed rushed.. as I believe the pacing of the begining and middle perhaps cut into what time was left for the ending.

3D, Now i saw this movie in 3D at the theater, and it looked amazing. However a lot of scenes for the movie were put in place for 3D purposes only, this detracts away from the movie if you're not watching it in 3D. And some of the scenes go far to long, hense the pacing problems.

However on the bright side, all characters are well acted and far superior over the previous spiderman series, Gone is the sappy "" oh poor me, im spider man..FML"" I relize that was part of the original comic books, but that always bugged.",1354060800,2,912,4.2601156069364166
4421892,5,B004LWZWFQ,"I was a big fan of the Tobey Maguire films, so I was hesitant to see this, especially since I usually find it super annoying when people do remakes of perfectly good films so soon after the originals. However, this was a wonderful movie, and has taken the first trilogy's place as my favorite version! Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are fantastic actors, and have undeniable chemistry. Garfield is completely believable as Parker, Sally Field is obviously amazing, and Emma Stone brings intelligence and humor to Gwen Stacy. Quality of the picture and Amazon streaming is great as usual-- I have watched a bunch of movies with this service, and it hasn't let me down yet.",1354060800,,671,4.793103448275862
4421893,2,B004LWZWFQ,"When I saw this film in IMAX 3D my friend who came with me feel asleep half way through. That pretty much sums it all up.

The direction was horrendous. There was no chemistry whatsoever between any of the characters and given the caliber of the cast, it wasn't their fault. The choice of Andrew was way off. The dialog in some scenes was amateurish at best.

The action was TV level quality and too few for an action film.

The 3D when I saw it in IMAX 3D was flat. I even took the glasses off several times to make sure, and I could have easily watched the film without all the way through. On this Blu Ray, it's the same. Flat, barely evident at any time. The teaser trailer had more depth!

The best scene was the last 22 seconds where you almost have a POV of Spider-Man as he shoots through I construction crane. Then it ends.

This would be Spider-Boy, not man. We've yet to see in any of the offerings a grown character that has some purpose in society. The story is old, and done 1000X better by Raimi.

But ultimately, I'm the fool. I've basically spent over $40 on a film I just want to step on and throw out an open window! Lean from me, don't believe the over-hyped (probably fake) reviews where some have given this 4 and 5 stars.

4421961,4,B004LWZWFQ,"Why we needed another Spiderman series after the recent (2002/2007) Tobey McGuire run is probably the same reason we keep getting remakes of foreign films (Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, etc): they make money.  And it looks like the public will never tire of Marvel Comic Book stories, so might as well settle in and give them a try. It is an evening's entertainment approaching 3 hours of visual shenanigans that are pretty entertaining.

There are some differences between this Spiderman and the last - aside from cast: the stories are different although they both claim to show the origin of this magic transformation of a lonely confused young man trying to figure out who he is until he discovers some super secrets and the power to change into a humanoid spider-gifted hero. It all starts out well enough - Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is shy and unable to relate to about everyone except his aunt and uncle (Sally Field and Martin Sheen do a fine job here). He fails at a run-in with the high school bully Flash (a hunky and promising Chris Zylka), is noticed by the perky Gwen (Emma Stone) who is involved in Peter's introduction to scientist Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) who is an old friend of Peter's strangely disappeared father (Campbell Scott) and mother (Embeth Davidtz). Peter is smart, discovers a formula in his father's briefcase, and ultimately is able to transform himself into Spiderman - his nemesis being The Lizard who is actually Dr. Connors taking a potent experimental solution.  After a lot of flying around on buildings and throwing spider web tendrils at everything including The Lizard, Peter is hunted as a threat until Gwen's policeman father (Denis Leary) eventually bonds with the insecure Peter in a life saving situation. Then we are given footage of what is up for the sequel...

The human  (read `credible') parts work the best - Garfield and Stone make a fine pair and Sheen and Field give fine cameos.  Once the transformation takes place the film becomes a lesson in special effects and that is fun enough to watch.  It just goes on far too long...and there is more to come. Makes you wonder when the next cycle of Spiderman will come along.  Grady Harp, November 12",1353974400,,2210,4.782152230971128

4422057,4,B004LWZWFQ,"Sam Raimi's take on Spider-Man (released in 2001, I believe) is one of my very favorite comic book movies. The reason being, it's funny, and also, quite simply FUN. I was a bit apprehensive that any reboot could live up to the high standards established by that rather goofy movie, but this new Spider-Man does an admirable job. It is nowhere near as much fun, in my opinion, but it has found its own voice, one by which it holds its own ground and succeeds.

Rather than try to emulate the feel-good vibe of Raimi's flick, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" goes in the opposite direction, creating a more sophisticated, mature, and darker adaptation. I actually got the impression that the director and cinematographer must be avid students of ""Batman Begins"" (another great superhero flick), as I was constantly reminded of that bleaker imagery and emotional themes.

I don't think that the actor Garfield holds a candle to Maguire's performance as the iconic hero, but I don't know that anybody could. To his credit, Garfield doesn't try to emulate Maguire, but rather to create his own, moodier Spider-Man (although it doesn't quite feel like the classic web-head, without the freewheeling insults and good humor). As for the Lizard, he is a fantastic villain, channeling the very best parts of the Banner/Hulk psyche, at once creating empathy for his character, and fear for his unfocused power and unraveling stability.

Though ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is not quite on par with Sam Raimi's masterful take on the web slinger, it's still a very good superhero movie. It's major fault, in my humble opinion, is that it takes itself a shade too seriously for a movie about a character who is so thoroughly in love with the concept of fun.",1353888000,,1731,4.880952380952381

4422061,4,B004LWZWFQ,"Strange, but I like the reboot, despite stating over and over before I saw it that I didn't think it was necessary. Turns out, they improved the franchise. There's a clunky awkwardness between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone that seems more like real chemistry than what we've seen in previous Spiderman films. (I don't think you can talk about this movie without referencing the Toby Maguire films -- it's just so soon.) Garfield's Spiderman is a little less articulate, less snarky, less ""your friendly neighborhood"" Spiderman than we've seen in the past, but he does make the ""kid"" part of the character a little more believable. The supporting cast is good, too, particularly Martin Sheen as a working-man's Uncle Ben (No, not the rice guy.).  Funny, though, I find it easier to believe that a kid can get turned into a super-hero by a spider bite than I can believe that a New York cop, even a captain, lives the way Dennis Leary's family does -- their dinner scene is  just short of a butler from complete.

The director of this movie found away to artfully use computer images and live action. The level of some of the real life stunts in this movie were astounding.

4422101,1,B004LWZWFQ,"With the recent revisions of Marvel Superheroes by Marvel Studios, I've been happily entertained.  I loved Captain America, Thor, Iron Man 1 & 2, and especially Avengers.  X-Men First Class was pretty good, but not great.  The Amazing Spider-Man was certainly lacking in pretty much everything, save for CGI/special effects.

Yes, the CGI/special effects were awesome... I would argue that they improved these effects from Spider-Man (2002).  However... that did little to save it from being a horribly disappointing movie.

When I watched this, I was expecting something of excellence, like the previous movies I mentioned.  Something true to the origin, something that would get fan approval, and something with character development and an exceptional story.  This is, after all, Marvel's bread-and-butter - besides X-Men/Wolverine, of course.

So... I waited with baited breath and continued to wait... and continued to be disappointed.  Lo' and behold - there was no character development.  The characters weren't even believable... Peter Parker the nerdy, accomplished skateboarder?  Really?  Peter Parker the woman's man?  Sneaking up to his gf's bedroom via the fire-escape?  Really?  Peter Parker?  I'm sorry, but no.

The plot/storyline was shallow and paled in comparison to Spider-Man (2002).  I watched Spider-Man (2002) just the other night, and again, I was blown away... just as I was when it first arrived on the Silver Screen.  I was so blown away back then that I saw it five different times in the theater.  Even the music was paltry.  In 2002, you were enticed with a Danny Elfman theme that just blew you away and prepared you for ensuing awesomeness.  What did you have for this one?  James Horner not even trying.

I'm greatly disappointed by this mess.  Tobey McGuire?  Believable.  Andrew Garfield?  Not so much.  The same could be said for each actor via a side-by-side comparison for both movies.  A sadly and horribly disappointing new direction for Spider-Man.  To think that there will be sequels to this... *gag*",1353888000,18,2044,5.212962962962963

I read the comics and yes the movie stayed loyal to the comic's but in a way it didnt. Any way I'm just going to explain my flaw's  but the movie was directed very well done along with the actor's performace but one thing I couldn't understand why Marc Webb decided to make Peter Parker into a skater instead of nerdy kid not some skater, now I'm not saying it wasn't interesting but I would perfer to see peter like the comics along with Uncle Ben's memorable quote  ""With Great Power Comes With Great Responabilites"" but he said the same thing but a different way which bugged me. I also thought Marc Webb could of made Dr. Connors a more powerful foe than he was in this film also I couldn't understand in this spiderman movie how come spiderman had his mask off and it seem that he needed help. I'm getting alittle tired of puting dirt on this fantastic film now my favorite part is the soundtrack just amazing in my opinion along with romance to the battle scenes and Andrew Garefield put alot of justice into spider-man like with his unique poses and just his acting overall was just outstanding as the iconic web-slinger lisen all I got to say rent or buy it cause it's one the most entertaining film of this year for sure.",1353801600,,1504,4.329787234042553

Who produces these pointless movies, that display the creative bankruptcy of all involved?

Below average acting, way below average screen play (even while just taking a well rehashed story), terrible CGI, amateurish photography, cliched sound track etc. etc.

And what's with the stupid lizard? The makers of this movie drive the final nail in the coffin of this movie with a sweeping display of a lack of story telling capability by hinging all their bets on creeping people out.

The only ones who could like this movie are the ones who think they have great ability in looking at creepy things, displayed in a very badly made movie - technically and artistically.

When doing reviews on reboots it's easy to just compare and contrast on the original film(s), but I will try my best to refrain from doing that too much. However there will be time where a comparison is necessary. With that being said, let's get started. The film was, for lack of a better word, amazing. I was so skeptical when I heard about the reboot, simply because I had become so comfortable with Tobey Maguire. Now he was never the perfect Peter Parker, but I still enjoyed the original trilogy. However just like the original trilogy, this film does have both it's strengths and weaknesses.

Let's start with the Spider-Man costume and the Spider-Man character (not Peter) From the start I did not like the new costume. It looked really weird, and it did not properly portray how Spider-Man should look in my eyes. Sadly after seeing the film my opinion wasn't changed. One thing I did love about this new film is they implemented Spider-Man's web shooters. This is a very important component in the comics because during fights he would sometimes run out of web and he would have to strategically get himself out of a situation. Now they didn't go too in depth with the shooters, but I felt this was a step in the right direction. Then the use of his webbing is focused on a lot more in this film than it was in the original trilogy. He uses his web constantly during his fight sequences, which is another very important component to the Spider-Man character. Hopefully in the next film they can implement the humor he uses during his fights. In the comics he likes to taunt his opponents, but this still hasn't been explored in a Spider-Man film.

I didn't really like Andrew Garfield's portrayal of Peter Parker. Peter is suppose to be this awkward kid who has no athletic skills at all, but in the film he was standing up for a kid getting beat up (before he got bit) and riding a skateboard. I don't know. It didn't ruin the film, but it did bug me a little. What bugged me more is how often he took his mask off as Spider-Man. There had to be like 10 people in the film who found out who he was, this irritated the hell out of me. In the comics he made it so important that no one ever knew who he was. That way when someone did find out, it was a big deal. Other than that I felt he did an amazing job, except in the scene with Uncle Ben. It seemed really awkward and forced, which kind of took me out of the moment.

Emma Stone did an amazing job as Gwen Stacey. I was a little worried because I had never seen her in a film like this, but she didn't disappoint. I love the way the writers showed the relationship between Gwen and Peter. It was something that was never truly discussed in the original trilogy, but still a very important part of the comic books. The chemistry between Andrew and Emma was phenomenal, and I personally felt their best scenes where when they were together.

Rhys Ifans played an amazing Curt Connors. I felt he looked more like Connors then Dylan Baker did in the original trilogy. The only thing that kind of bothered me was you constantly saw the stubble of his arm. I always imagined the character being self-conscious about it, making sure his shirt hung long enough to conceal it. It wasn't a big deal, just a minor gripe.

Martin Sheen played a surprisingly amazing Uncle Ben. When I heard about his role I couldn't see him fitting the part, but he made it work. However I didn't enjoy Sally Field as Aunt May. I always envisioned her as an old frail woman, but she just didn't give me that feeling. Her best scene was her last scene. I felt that scene embodied everything that Aunt May was in Peter's life.

I would've like to see Harry Osborn and Mary Jane in here. Harry was Peter's best friend in high school, but they completely left him out of the film. I understand they were trying to focus on Peter and Gwen's relationship, but May Jane was still his crush. The girl next door.

Visually the film is amazing. I felt the Lizard looked great, and I understand what the director was going for by giving him more of a human face instead of that of a reptile. I saw one reviewer complain that they used too much CGI with him, well how the hell do you expect them not to use CGI for a huge Lizard? The only thing I can complain about visually is the point of view shots. Those seemed really weird and out of place, but again nothing that ruined the film.

It was weird not hearing Danny Elfman doing the score, but I adjusted. I felt James Horner's wasn't as strong, but it did have it's strong points. The licensed music was done well, but there were very few songs in the film so I don't think a soundtrack is being released.

Overall Score: 8.5/10 - This review came out longer than expected, but I thank you if you read it in its entirety. I loved the film and, in many ways, I felt it did a lot of things better than the originals. It was nice seeing a new take on the origin story instead of them rehashing the same idea. They did leave it open for a sequel and, if I remember correctly, it is planned for a 2014 release. Whether you're a fan of comics or just good movies, I recommend you go and see this.",1353715200,2,5219,4.332650972364381
4422243,5,B004LWZWFQ,"My title says what you must do to fairly critique The Amazing Spiderman. The first Spiderman was good for it's time but watching both back to back, The Amazing Spiderman is a more mature film. It struck a much deeper tone by doing away with the constant camp the first film led with. Peter Parker developing his own web concoction as depicted in the comics is what I've always wanted to see. I thought making Spiderman too web organic in the original just flopped and made Spiderman much weirder than necessary.

 The Amazing Spiderman is a very good film but had a shortcoming as well. That being the Lizard's face being completely wrong. He needed an elongated lizard face. They didn't need an exact construction of a lizard as the extra features stressed was done. Remember how that killed Godzilla 1998? In addition his tongue was almost never seen and it could have been used in cool ways. Fortunately this was not a complete setback as the rest of the film more than compensated. Plus, the actual pathos of the Lizard remained intact.

Andrew Garfield as Spiderman pulled this off big-time. You've heard it a million times already but the chemistry between Emma Stone (Gwen Stacy) and Garfield was screen magic unfolding and can not be understated. It's a genuine teen romance that the viewer can actually care about. What empathy could you pull up for MJ in the original? Lets face it, she  came off as a prissy teen that embraced Parker after near death.  I'm glad this film was made and it was not ""too soon"" or ""unnecessary"". How many times has Spiderman gone through character metamorphosis in print? The art of film -making should be no different. Yes we all have preferences for films and we should leave it at that without putting a halt on artistic expression, especially if it's grounded..

The first film(s) somewhat rushed through the growth of Spiderman  This film really has some meat on it and the relationships are more realistic than ever. The new costume blows away any prior live action spectacle of Spiderman. Spiderman's body movements are solid and this includes the astonishing web slinging and swinging action scenes that made me want to press the replay button with true anticipation this time.

Onto the blu ray quality. Totally incredible. I've been on top of blu ray since it's inception and this exceeds any picture quality (except The Expendables 2-which was no great movie, but kicked a** on action)that I personally have seen to date. The sound, awesome. When I first heard that Spiderman was being redone instead of a Spiderman 4, I was disappointed. Shockingly, I was wrong. Now I see why it needed to be made. The bonus features which are deeper than usual (and in hi def)expound upon these issues and make sense for a change. Outside of a few bumps, this Amazing Spiderman was well thought out and captured the Peter Parker dilemma with darkness like no other and left the silliness behind.",1353715200,,2932,4.769230769230769

4422338,5,B004LWZWFQ,"I saw this movie while it was in theaters, and again here on Amazon through Instant Streaming. Although there have been criticisms about the movie telling the same story again as in the previous Spider-Man movies (which are not all unfounded to be honest), it is a good take on that story due to its accuracy. Not all movies are accurate in terms of characters or plots, but this one is much more accurate than the previous origin story movie with Maguire. The actors do an excellent job of portraying their characters and set up the story so that it is uncertain exactly which villain will be in the sequel, which I am certain will answer many dangling plot points (all of which are easily overlooked anyway and seem to have been implemented for the sake of a sequel). This brings me to an important point: as many Marvel-affiliated movies go, there is in fact a scene at the end of the movie. This scene is missing in the Amazon Instant Streaming version. Having already seen it, it did not bother me as much; yet, my brother who watched this with me was disappointed that the scene was not included (especially since he had not seen the film in theaters). That is the only Con I can come up with, and it is more of an problem on the service side than the actual product. Great movie overall.",1353715200,2,1294,4.4411764705882355
4422339,3,B004LWZWFQ,"It's hard to review a movie based on such an iconic character like Spider-Man. Stan Lee and Steve Ditko created Spider-Man back in the early 1960s and I'm sure they had no idea that they would be creating a hero with such a wide and long-lasting appeal. And so, how you judge this movie may ultimately depend on where you stand and when you were born. Characters like Superman, Batman and The Hulk are so universal in concept, that we are only given translations and versions. That's the beauty and tragic hurdle for any franchise-player-based movie to deal with.

My first (and definitive) Spider-Man is from the 1960s [ahem to the age nod] and I'm sure for many it is 1981 Saturday cartoon Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends. We were just given the triple-play from Sam Raimi starring Toby Maguire and Kirsten Dunst. This film will most likely serve as the main comparison point for any kind of modern following- especially since comic books are no longer the staple story-carrier for so many super-heroes.

The previous series (Spider-Man 2002) slowly turned away from the Spider-Man character and focused more on the relationship between the alter-ego Peter Parker and the girl-next-door, Mary Jane [Watson]. Amazing follows the original comic book story a bit more closely by introducing classmate Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) as Parker's love interest -and returning to the budding scientist aspect by making the web devices an invention as opposed to an evolved part of his mutated arachnid-abilities. The casting is well done as The Lizard (Rhys Ifans), the Police Captain (Denis Leary), Uncle Ben and Aunt May (Martin Sheen and Sally Field) all add star power and credibility to the new reboot without too much time developing their back stories. We have to take this move seriously. And that's part of the new tone. It's a much darker world for Peter Parker [not that the last trilogy wasn't bleak enough] where the kind of events that took tragic turns in previous movies (like the death of Ben) seem much more weighted in overall heaviness. Toby Macguire's Spider-Man struggled with the trappings of everyday life, this Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is dealing with EVERYTHING. His parents, his guardians, his school and mostly his own identity- and that's before even being bit by the spider!

The question of Who am I? has always been a central theme for super-hero stories. It's what gives purpose and drives the characters forward and gives meaning to the actions (and the sometimes violent encounters) we see unfolding before us. We need to empathize with the hero, hate and fear the villain- with a small amount left for understanding why he does evil. We need to want the girl or at least want to see them together by the end. We need to feel his triumph and overcome the low points with him. If you accomplish some of these, the move becomes a journey and The Amazing Spider-Man achieves this with only a few bumps along the way.

I won't swing off on the choice to reboot the franchise. I certainly don't think spidey needed one or even this one so soon. As I understand, there were some crossed ideas over the direction of the series and Marvel just can't let its flagship character stay stuck. The writers James Vanderbilt, Steve Kloves [lots of Harry Potter film work] and Alvin Sargent [Spider-man 2 and 3] write a fast moving script that leans a little too much on coincidences. You can't help but think `plot-device much?' when you see the intertwining of important characters. We also have some bad slapstick moments, but at least the Spider-Man one-line-zingers are relatively funny and in the true spirit of the wise-cracking web slinger.
Speaking of web slinging, we have some great choreography for both the fight scenes and the skyscraper Tarzan-like vinework. We even have a more spider-y Spider-Man (and Peter Parker) as arachnid movements and tendencies are molded into the characters. We have the classic touch of a newly bit Parker catching a fly and a scene where Spider-man actually waits in the center of his web for his prey to trip and trigger his web-net. Well done.

We also have the ubiquitous New York head nod as the common folk of the city rally together to help spidey. I thought we saw enough of that in the recent trilogy, but I guess Spider-Man is such a New York staple, it bears revisiting again.

The movie ends on a somber, yet promising note for the future. It's a perfect ending because that's my exact opinion of the movie. It was a good movie and goes beyond `worth watching' because we are seeing another version of one of our most beloved superheroes. The new Spider-Man is treading on familiar cobwebs and hoping to create a new strand to swing from. I will admit I'm not as thrilled with the reboot as I could be, but this movie has created a solid framework to build from.

Also redoing the origin of Spider-Man was redundant because it had already been done in the 1st movie. I think this franchise is starting to run it's course...,1353715200,,400,4.811594202898551

4422522,5,B004LWZWFQ,"Recently watched movie review:
*The Amazing Spider-Man (2012)- 4.5/5

The Amazing Spider-Man is a remake of Spider-Man that came out in 2002. I hardly remember the 2002 version, so I really can't compare the two movies, so I reviewed The Amazing Spider-Man on its own terms. I didn't want to see it, but I felt very satisfied afterward.

The Amazing Spider-Man opens up with a young boy named Peter Parker who discovers that someone broke into his parents' house to steal important documents. His parents' drop Peter off at his Aunt May and Uncle Ben's house to live there for a while. Years later, Peter Parker, who's played by 'Andrew Garfield', is in high school and is a victim of bullying. Standing up to the bully, he meets Gwen Stacy, who's played by 'Emma Stone'.

Peter finds his dads' secret papers and learns that his father worked with Scientist, Dr. Curt Connors, who's played by 'Rhys Ifans'. Peter finds out where Dr. Curt Connors works at, meets up with Gwen, and he sneaks into a lab where a biocable is being created from genetically modified spiders. Peter touches something in the lab that he shouldn't have touched and one of the modified spiders bites him. Peter now has spider-like abilities and then uses his new abilities to hunt criminals, while a giant lizard is on the loose.

The Amazing Spider-Man does a lot of things right and only a few things wrong. For starters, it has a good cast, lots of detail in the plot, and just the right amount of action. Sure, The Amazing Spider-Man revisits many of the same plot points from the 2002 version, but the movie is done well enough that most viewers won't care about the same plot points. The movie takes about an hour before any action really happens; it seems many superhero movies have far too much CGI and not enough story and character development, so I like that the movie took its time.

The Amazing Spider-Man has its moments of cheesy dialog, but I expected it to happen and forgave most of the 'rolling eyeball' lines. I don't want to give away too much, but there is plot in the movie where Spider-Man is looking for a certain criminal. The film spends roughly about 15 minutes where this is happening and after 15 minutes, nothing is to show for wasting my time. This irked me, thus resulting in a non-perfect movie score. If you have any interest in seeing the reboot version, I highly recommend that you give The Amazing Spider-Man a 'rent.'

4422525,3,B004LWZWFQ,"I for one feel somewhat let down after watching the Amazing Spiderman... if I were to name it based on how it made me feel I would call it The Re-Marketed Spiderman... or maybe Spiderman .78... as in a passing grade.  Peter Parker and his girl friend (Emma Stone character Gwen Stacy) they seem in my opinion too old for their parts.  Their relationship seems too mature for even extremely bright college bound teenagers.  They are both probably in their early to mid twenties.  I found myself missing Tobey Maguire's sweet naivit which helped him play the teenaged Spiderman.  When they show the two leads together in this adaption they jump right into serious from the start and the Peter Parker acts too hormone charged.  There is a gritty element that I'm not sure parents of younger children would want them to see.  It's not spoken as much as just darker, more need driven in the way Parker kisses Stacy.  And, with the Tobey Maguire version this was not an issue at all.  All this being said it is probably a film that most parents would allow their 12+ to see.  You know if your kids can handle it or if you have already shown this similar styles of super hero films.  There was no bad language issues other than scenes with dialogue concerning death.  I've recently seen Captain America and Thor recently and I felt they were fine for a  slightly younger aged child... say 8+ as long as the child has an interest and the parent is there with them while viewing them.

So, all that being said now I'll just talk in regard to adults. The Dr. Connors villain is pretty standard fare.  His character is not very developed and there was probably more that could have been done to add more dimension to the Dr. Connors through more of a back-story. All we really know is that he knew Peter Parker's father and you can see that he is minus one arm and this seems to be a major part of his motivation in his lab work.  Dennis Leary plays Gwens father who is a Police Captain.

I'm not sorry I purchased this movie and may watch it again.  Where as the Tobey Maguire Spiderman I KNOW I'll watch it again with my husband or grandchildren.",1353542400,,2137,4.435897435897436

4422593,2,B004LWZWFQ,"Five years after Sam Rami concluded his Spider-Man trilogy with the financially lucrative but critically panned Spider-Man 3, Sony has rebooted the franchise with a new creative team and cast.  Marc Webb (500 Days of Summer) directs and Andrew Garfield (The Social Network) heads up the cast as the new web slinger. So how does the new package hold up?  In a word, meh.  I will admit that I am a big fan of Rami's trilogy, but I was certainly interested in seeing what new direction this reboot would go.  This Spider-Man is darker and moodier, perhaps taking a cue from Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy.  Garfield portrays Peter Parker as a hipster of sorts who rides a skateboard, dabbles in photography and is extremely intelligent but also slightly lazy and cynical.  All of this seems in stark contrast to the character made famous by Stan Lee and a complete 180 from Tobey Maguire's portrayal.  While this is an intersting spin to put on the character, it just didn't ring true to me and I felt very disconnected from the film as a result.

Marc Webb's direction is solid, but he really doesn't put his signature on the film.  He seems a bit too concerned with making sure that the film meets the expectations of audiences instead of truly throwing himself into the storytelling process in an exciting way.  The supporting cast is solid, but nobody apart from Dennis Leary as the father of Peter's love interest makes much of a lasting imprression.  The plot of the film focuses on Spidey's origins but it takes a long  time getting there and leaves little time for his showdown with The Lizard, a villian who harkens back to the very early days of the comic books.

Perhaps Webb and company are merely setting things up for more compelling and entertaining installments yet to come.  That is my hope becase The Amazing Spider-Man lacks both of these qualities.  It is basically a reintroduction to the beloved icon that doesn't feel new or fresh.  The web-head and his fans deserve more than that.",1353456000,,2011,4.71919770773639

Then knowing that The Lizard would be the villian, I thought that this movie would be worse than the last mishmash that was Spiderman 3. The why was quickly answered from the first scene. We see a young Peter Parker with his parents, first playing hide and seek with his Dad, then later being brought to live with his Aunt and Uncle when something seems to have gone wrong with his father.

Peter never sees his parents again, and Aunt May and Uncle Ben become his parents. He goes to high school and is set upon by the school bully, Flash Thompson. He has a crush on a girl from his class, Gwen Stacey who really doesn't notice him. He is only known for his photography skills.

Later he finds a photo of his father with another man. He goes to his Uncle to ask who is the other man. His Uncle looks uncomfortable but says he doesn't know him. Later, his Uncle relents and lets Peter know that the man in the picture is Curt Connors and he was his father's partner. Peter learns that Connors works on Genetic Engineering for Oscorp and goes there to see what he may know about his father.

While there, Peter wanders into a room where generic engineering is happening on spiders. Of course, one of them gets in his clothing and will later bite him beginning the legend. As Peter realizes his powers he still doesn't know what to do with himself. That all changes when he goes to a convenience store to buy milk but doesn't have enough money to pay for it. The clerk refuses to let him go and when a suspicious looking character comes in to rob the place, Peter gets even with the clerk by not stopping the thief. Unfortunately, this thief will then kill his Uncle Ben.

Peter, learns from the police that his Uncle's murderer is the same thief he failed to stop. This sets him looking for bad guys to see if he can find his Uncle's murderer. To tell the rest would give spoilers but Gwen Stacey will later become his girlfriend and her father is the police chief who starts going after Spiderman for being a vigilante.

Now the answer to my second point, this movie is a lot better than Spiderman 3. It may even be better than the first Spiderman film but not nearly as good as the Doc Ock film. The filmakers have changed a lot things from the original story. The actor that plays Peter is more of an outcast than the nerd that Peter was supposed to be. There is no real reason why one would believe that all of a sudden Gwen would start liking him. Sally Field, though well into her 60's looks a heck of a lot younger than the comic book Aunt May. Peter comes home all hours of the night, obviously having been in fights and she never questions him about what he was doing.

Captain Stacey is a more believable Spiderman PR adversary than the comical J. Johnah Jameson portrayed in the earlier films. Overall this is a much better made film than the originals but there were several parts that tended to drag. It did have its one Stan Lee comic relief moment and Curt Connors makes a good villian. Don't miss the brief scene a little bit into the credits because it provides the setup for the next film.

Overall, It was a good film and I do look forward to the next installment. I understand that it will have a Mary Jane and the villian is rumored to be Electro.",1353369600,3,3345,4.333865814696486

4422687,2,B004LWZWFQ,"(Possible Spoilers)

Barely 10 years after Sam Raimi directed the ""Spider-Man"" trilogy starring Tobey Maguire as the web shooting superhero, we have this relaunch where Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield, ""The Social Network"") is a high school genius/outast (are there ever any other kinds in these movies?) who is trying to piece together his childhood memories and discover why his parents put him with his aunt and uncle when he was young. His dad in particular since he was a scientist working on a secret project, having no answers to this, there's one man who can provide some, his former partner Dr. Connors (Rhys Ifans, ""Notting Hill"") who has one arm and is researching a way to do cross species medical procedures that would take care of any ailment and regrow limbs.

Of course he tries this procedure on himself and at first it works but then the side effects take place and he becomes a famous ""Spider-Man"" villain 'The Lizard'. Meanwhile Peter becomes bit by a spider in a lab and takes on spider like powers which are at first troubling but he finds that they can benefit him and after his uncle Ben (Martin Sheen, NBC's ""The West Wing"") is killed by a thug Peter goes on the hunt to find this criminal and also to take down this Lizard before he destroys the city and or turns the population into lizard creatures like himself.

The movie itself feels very unnecessary as while Raimi's vision of Spider-Man was met with both praise and scorn from fans and movie-goers alike, this film isn't really all that interesting. Garfield as Peter is decent I guess, his love interest Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone, ""Zombieland"") isn't too good and their building romance feels very ""Twilight-esque"" and is pretty bland.

The action also isn't all the spectacular either, it feels all too familiar, like the bridge sequence where Spidey has to save people in their cars from falling off the bridge due to the Lizard's rampage. There's not a lot of drama or interest in whether key people survive or not, it was way too early to do a reboot of this series in my opinion and even worse to do one that felt so pedestrian and by the book, with many cliches and the conclusion brings up the possibility of the eventual sequel. *1/2 out of 4 stars.",1353196800,,2236,4.653164556962025

4422718,1,B004LWZWFQ,"I suppose, in a world where douchebags rule (Basically Parker goes to Douchebag High School) the thing you have to remember is anything better than selfish aggression.

Is this a re-telling? More like a re-hanging. In fact, if you haven't already seen a Spiderman movie, you won't know what is going on. There is no scene where we get an idea that Peter Parker is anything special until we see some ridiculously high-tech remote control door lock. Up to that point he is just a loner with an army jacket and a hoodie. He's also a stalker (which of course seems to excite and intrigue teenage girls who only wear knee socks). Every time there's a question, it's covered by assuming you already know the story and are watching the divergent moments for orientation.

Personally, I believe in a shady fight promoter willing to cheat Parker on a technicality far more than I believe in a surly clerk who won't let Amazing Parker take a penny from the counter. It's a belief that comes from the exposition behind the ethics of letting the thief escape. A clerk who won't let a penny from the ""take a penny"" cup isn't doing something that is deserving of justice. The truth is, the clerk has a real point (if there was a clerk on Earth that would even look up at this transaction) and nothing to gain or lose by his treatment of Amazing Parker. On the other hand, the shady fight promoter profits both by Parker's win, and inflates his profit by cheating him, in the original genesis story. The Amazing Parker is just petty. Petty in his revenge against Flash, and then petty in his revenge against the clerk. With the clerk Amazing Parker is an accomplice - ""Not my problem"" here means ""I got mine"" with his milk in hand, instead of ""Why should I help you after you ruthlessly cheat me for a profit that is not yours.""

If you want to reach for a way in which this movie has any merit, it is the way that Amazing Parker functions as a stand-in for white male privilege. Consider the scene in which he attends the Oscorp tour. He takes a badge meant for the Rodrigo Guevara. Even as Parker and the woman at the counter seem to make a joke of the badge he chooses, he gets a pass. Moments later, the real Guevara (played by Milton Gonzalez) who looks and sounds like he matches the name is dragged away by security. Everybody laughs. Ha ha, look at the Latino, fussing and fighting, as he's dragged away by uniforms. Don't that let that happen to you boys. Ok, back to my knee socks.

Amazing Parker is further afflicted by the work of his father, an easy metaphor for privilege passed on even in the absence of his parent. Certainly, this Parker is not our accidental hero, born out of side effects of science. He is created by his father's work. Even once recognized as passing himself off as something he is not, Gwen has no problem with security's detention of the wrong man, she furthers her complicity with selfishness as well (""don't get me in trouble?"" Can you get more vapid?). This of course is typical of the societal support that privilege finds in the world.

Truth is this re-telling is only a flimsy framework for some special effects that aren't all that special. It's a framework completely hinged on the work done by three other movies, and the comic book series. Without that, you are lost because there is no character development within the film. The original Parker is interesting, because he is chosen by science and fate and must claim responsibility for what he does with this power. The Amazing Parker is just a selfish child, bent on revenge, revenge for his father's death, revenge for his uncle's death, and revenge for his not being able to spend two pennies from the penny cup. It's not really a re-telling at all. Perhaps it is a(what should be insulting)misinterpretation of the story marketed at young audiences. More likely it is a complete misunderstanding of the Spiderman myth and what made it so good- Parker's struggle with being a vigilante in the first place without damaging justice. Just because you dress the kid like Travis Bickle crossed with Ted Kaczynski doesn't convince me that you understand the Spider Man.

4422720,4,B004LWZWFQ,"As a fan of the comic series (especially the original) and a semi-fan of the other three movies (actually, the only one I really liked was the second)- I found that this movie was really fantastic. Great film making, great actors and more true to the comic-book storyline, it stepped up the Spider-man franchise. I'll admit that I was really annoyed when I saw the trailer because it was like, ""Wow... running out of ideas..."" But now that I've seen the movie, it's quite the excellent movie. Everyone put a lot of care into it.

However, everything usually has Pros and Cons, so, here they are:

PROS:
-Excellent lighting, set design and directing.
-Engaging characters and story.
-Great acting!
-The return of the more comic book-like Spider-man. Spidey's cheesy jokes have returned! I would say this Peter Parker balances his serious and his comedic side very well.

CONS:
-There was that part of the movie that was near literal dues ex machina. However, I'll admit it looked epic with Spider-man swinging across cranes...
-The villain's motivation, although clear, didn't feel fully realized. The movie watcher hears him say, ""I can cure human-kind!"" but they never see the passion for the rest of the world before that statement, as he mainly has been working for himself and his own desire.
-Also with the villain, it seemed odd that all of a sudden, he hears voices like Norman Osborne like in the other movies. There wasn't any lead up either, he just suddenly hears voices like it's normal and continues on his crazy quest.
-The last line: ""Those are the best kind."" 'Nuff said.
-It was a little awkward having Uncle Ben go off on a speech that wanted to say, ""With great power comes great responsibility"" but instead wormed around it.

Never have I seen a Spiderman movie that truly shows and brings out the ""spider"" in a man. The only drawback was that the real Spiderman comic book hero would ""never reveal his identity"", to anyone. His constant pulling off his mask was very distressing and it made me feal that this is not the real spiderman. Also the spider web should have stop the small lizards from traversing on the web.

I even like the decision go completely Mary Jane-free, as I felt the old ""girl next door is the only one for me"" story was a path the Raimi films walked far too quickly. Despite those perfectly noble, admirable intentions, though, this reboot just doesn't click for me. In the ten years since the first Spider-Man, the landscape of cinematic superheroics has changed dramatically. The Avengers family has upped the action ante, while Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy has proven a hero's story can be about more than just the mask. With the glut of action heroes now on the scene, Peter Parker needed this chance to differentiate himself, but instead he fades further into the wallpaper. Andrew Garfield turns in a laudable effort, but his renditions of Parker and Spider-Man are written to be so drastically different, it's often tough to imagine they're actually the same person. I had a hard time watching Peter doom and gloom over his Uncle while at school, then immediately toss out wacky jokes at night, in the midst of hunting his killer. Martin Sheen is the film's only real standout as poor, ill-fated Uncle Ben, but that's a role so inherently sympathetic that it would take an unmitigated disaster to screw up. All things considered it's certainly not a bad effort; the cast is loyal to the source while still seeming contemporary, the action scenes are breathtaking (if surprisingly infrequent) and enough leftovers remain on the table to feed several sequels. But several dull spots, a foil that seems too run-of-the-mill and universally inconsistent characterization stop it from being as amazing as the title would have us believe.",1353024000,,1920,5.003125

This movie was loosely based on the modernized/re-imagined Ultimate Spider-man Universe ( Published Oct 9, 2000), written, not by Stan Lee, but by Brian Michael Bendis who lengthened ""the original 11-page origin story into a 180-page, 7 issue comic arc."" The Amazing Spider-man's screenwriter, James Vanderbilt, along with Mark Webb and a few others distorted and rewrote Bendis' work in their adaptation. This is where Bendis' story became their story. Though I think the classic Stan Lee version over-rules all of them, I respect Bendis' writing, which came closer to the original than Vanderbilt and Webb's. All those small changes added up to an uncomfortable watch (each detailed below).

As for the special effects, Spider-man's costume, acrobatics, colors, angles, and webs were fantastic, but they can't be a blindfold. Realistically, the acting was average - nothing personal to Emma Stone or the other guy, but those were big roles to fill, and I was expecting a cast that would do better than Tobey and Dunst (not only better, but far surpass). Nothing personal to either actor (Stone was good in Superbad/Easy A and Garfield was decent in Social Network), but they weren't right for these parts. To see what I mean, do a comparison between this cast and Batman's Christian Bale/Heath Ledger or Iron Man's Robert Downey Jr./Gwyneth Paltrow. If you can't see the difference or think that it is not a fair comparison, then you probably disagree with my review. Spiderman's importance is equal to Batman or Ironman's; therefore, it deserves the same quality. Looking back, Tobey Maguire did a decent job - despite Spiderman 3, which also had writing and directing problems. However, for Spider-man 1 and 2, Tobey had decent direction; a decent script; and time to do embody the role. He played a lovable ultra-nerd well, but he needed to step aside after number 2 - e.g. Topher Grace should have been Spider-man for number 3, not Venom, but that time has past.

Below are some things I'm pointing out for those who read the comics and novels. Feel free to correct me on anything. For anyone else reading, you may be interested in the differences. The bar is high though; it's been raised since Spider-man 2002. Trust me, if a cast who can imbody the characters similar to Batman or Ironman's (maybe Jude Law, Jake Gyllenhaal, Ewan McGregor, along with Christina Hendricks, etc) paired with a writer similar to J.J. Abrams, John Semper Jr., Christopher Nolan, or Joss Whedon did Spider-man, it would be par to any Batman story. If you're going to do Spider-man, it needs to be pretty much on target, and really good! Side Note: In the video, Dominic Purcell (Venom) and Topher Gracer (as Spidy, not venom) are also mentioned and very good picks.

---------------------------------------------------

WTF, why did they do these things:

( 1 ) They left out Peter/Spiderman's inner-monologue, which is huge in the comics and is half the reason Spiderman's character can pull the weight of a solo act.

- If you have time to check out good Peter/Spiderman inner-monologue, Christopher Daniel Barnes did such an amazing job in the 90s that they brought him back as a voice actor for two recent video games, 2011s Spider-Man: Edge of Time and 2010s Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions.

( 2 ) Peter was WAY WAY to cool, lean muscular, good looking, and strong at the beginning.

( 3 ) The Spider that bit him

- There were 3,000 genetically altered spiders that never get destroyed, so basically anyone can be Spiderman, which begs the question, when Peter tells Gwen, wouldn't she want to go get bit? Wouldn't anyone want to get bit if they knew it would give them powers?

- Venturing into a room with 3,000 freely roaming Spiders seems to be pushing it.

- He keeps the spider that bit him and shows it to Gwen Stacey (AWH!!! and the existence of that entire scene - plus, the football throw had unrealistic responses)

- Weird logic - The spiders that bite Peter Parker in this new movie SPECIALIZE in making web, so even though they've brought back web fluid/shooters (correcting a major flaw in the 2002 movie) they've made it more logical now that Spiderman gain web making abilities over anything else (web comes out of his body).

- In Stan Lee's classic Spider-man and even in Bendi's new version, there is only one ""affected"" spider that bites peter and then dies immediately after.

( 4 ) Spiderman takes off his mask any chance he gets?

- In Bendis' version (the one the movie's supposed to be based on), Gwen doesn't know Peter is Spider-man until a few issues before her death, and actually blames Spider-man for her father's death.

- In the better, classic version, Gwen never finds out Peter is Spider-man, not even before her tragic end, making it snd the actual cause of her death even more poignant. What really killed her?

( 5 ) YES A REBOOT WAS NEEDED... BUT not from the beginning.

- This Spider-man should have started with Peter, either half-way through college, at the end of college, or even later. With a fresh cast, making it clear that this is new version of Spider-man, the studio could have blatantly showed Peter using web shooters and fluid. The Daily Bugle updates well with a Huffington Post - like structure, and Peter could have taken on a column with his photo-journalism, or to separate him from Clark Kent, Peter could have upgraded his camera to a video camera, taking video footage of spider-man. Not to mention, he could be mid-way through his relationship to Mary Jane or even farther. Moreover, villains/other heroes could just appear in scenes, without explaining their elaborate back stories - though writing the dialogue, personality, and character with the back-story everpresent - leaving people questioning (in a good way), ""I wonder how he became this or she became that.""

- Using a more mature Peter, opens the path to prequels later on. If they had done this, people wouldn't have said, ""Was a reboot really needed?""

- Spiderman doesn't have to be in High School all the time. In eighth grade, my generation read him as being in college and we loved him, and still related very well.

( 6 ) The web fluid was made at Oscorp, not by Peter himself.

- IMPORTANT: Why does it matter if Petter makes his web fluid from scratch? It adds to Peter's character just as Batman's nifty gadgets add to his character. Half of Spider-man's powers are a result of his ingenuity and intelligence - something you earn, not something you are given or steal from Oscorp. Furthermore, when you make him a good hearted lab rat rather than a skater, Peter becomes a character you would like to see attain super powers because you know that he'll have the intelligence to use them for good. Moreover, the intelligence to use them to get out of jams.

- In the comics and novels, Peter Parker (the lab rat) created his web fluid from scratch, before he was Spider-man, as a science fair entry to earn a college scholarship. After studying multi-polymer compounds for a few years, he produced a liquid adhesive that, when manipulated, could create unimaginably, strong, thin strands. To Peter's frustration, the science fair entry was problematic since his compound dissolved after a few hours. However, after gaining powers, Peter realized that his compound could imitate spider webbing, and the main setback to his science fair entry benefited Spider-man because he wouldn't be trashing the city with webs. Moreover, as a crazy polymer compound, he could shoot it out and create different objects, in mere moments ( e.g., a shield , parachute , club , small raft [i.e., him sitting on the small shield in water] etc.).
::::::: Side Note: Why had Peter taken on the science fair project? He was attempting to make inexpensive industrial strength rope for large ships, as a replacement for thick steel twined ropes. However, this ""shipping rope"" motive is a side note, since I don't remember where I read this.

((I just quote the comics and novels in the next two dashes))

- A quote on the matter from Stan Lee/Peter David:

""The adhesive was a mixture he'd already been working on,
but had back-burnered because he'd hit a snag. The intention
had been to submit it for a science fair. He'd hoped it would
be the sort of thing that would garner attention; perhaps even
a Westinghouse scholarship or something that would ease the
financial burden when it was time for college.
It was a super adhesive.
The problem he'd run into was that it was only temporary. It
stuck like nothing else on the market, but after a couple of
hours, it dissolved into wisp-thin threads. The drawback,
however, had no impact on the use to which he intended to
put it.""

- Another old (60s style writing), more simplistic version of Spider-man's web fluid origins.

""Peter ""devoted long hours of study to learning everything
he can about spiders... his web-making ability is one of
his most closely-guarded secrets. He makes his own web fluid
under the most exacting conditions in the lab, storing it
in small, compact cylinders like miniature toothpaste tubes...
Spidey can eject his web fluid in any one of the three
different ways:
a. As a thin, incredibly strong line
b. As a fine, quick-spreading spray
c. As a thick, tremendously adhesive liquid.""

- Any storyline with Peter making web fluid from scratch is only believable if he's a over studying lab rat, not a skater. No offense to skaters, I skate myself.

( 7 ) The Car Theft Scene (What happened here?)

- Spider-man keeps shooting web at the already incapacitated criminal; begins to laugh/clap as the criminal screams for help; and starts bragging about how he created the webbing himself. The criminal had taken out a knife, not to hurt peter, but in self-defense, saying not once, but twice, ""Just let me go."" ( I get the Uncle Ben Parallels, but torture seems to push the boundaries a bit )

- The cop rolls up and immediately pulls out his Loaded weapon. Instead of saying, lay on the ground or something. The cop says ""Who are you?"" Then, the cop goes for kill shots on Spider-man.

- The cop shoots many times directly at the incapacitated criminal tied up on the wall, almost assassinating him in the head once as the brick powders out a few inches away from the criminal's face - all without much provocation or warning - if anything, the cop would be more likely to pull out a taser.

- Who steals new cars anymore? Nobody. Car thefts are down 70 percent or more since the 90s because of gps and tracking. Cars people do steal are from the 90s or early 2000s, not newer cars, but the guy did have a big pocket computer to break the lock.

- How did Spider-man get into the car? This is not as nit-picky as it seems if you go back and take a look at the scene. If there was a sun roof open or broken window, the car check guy would have noticed it, but if he didn't, the criminal trying to break into the car would have, instead of using his complex method of opening the door. Thus, we must conclude Spider-man appeared there out of thin air.

- There is a difference between funny, witty, spider-man sarcasm and blood-vengeful, derisive, and conceited comments. Without finding Ben's Killer, it was a strange combination of Spidy sarcasm, real passion for the death of a family member, and arrogance.

- You end up feeling bad for the criminal.

( 8 ) The portrayal of Dr. Connors and the Lizard.

- Dr. Connors was not written as a stereotypical city wide criminal that goes to jail ( and then gets let out, somehow, every time they want to make a new movie ). It was enthralling how, in the comics, Dr. Connors struggles with his transformation and becomes one of Spiderman's (not Peter's) greatest allies. He helps peter through his mutagenic phase and becomes a pivotal part of many other storylines. Also, the interesting relationship between him and his wife and child is highly believable - that is, for a work of fiction.

- In the comics: Even in Brian Michael Bendis' version (the version this movie is based on), Dr. Connors is an American War Veteran that lost his arm and attempts to grow it back with his wife and child in mind. In the classic tale, Spider-man finds Dr. Connors in the Florida Everglades, still an american vet and still with wife and child.

- Dr. Connors goes to jail (AWH! NO!)

- Dr. Connors, the person, is supposed to be trapped in this abomination/mutation with a beastial mentality ( it hisses and does lizard things with glimpses of Dr. Conners, a good person, trying to free himself - and certainly doesn't talk that much, although this is debatable), but when he changes back to human form, he absolutely despises and hates what he has turned himself into, and struggles to find a cure. They dumbed down the lizard to be this talking sociopath who does a city-wide disaster, King Kong remake at the end.

- The Look: a lizard Hulk - Why not the alligator headed lizard, made popular in the comics? [warning: the following may be nit-picky] Moreover, making clear differences between ""the Lizard"" and ""the Hulk"" seems important. Granted, the lizard seems to have the hulk anger issue and the Jekyll/Hyde syndrome, but if he grows into a BIG (emphasis on size) green monster, what is the difference? A human sized, lean muscular, fast, powerful lizard seems more palatable. Also, some semi-plausible explanation for the extra-muscle, skin, bones, and tissues (e.g. the nutrients in Captain America's transformation capsule) helps highten the character's believability. Having Peter eat a ton of food was a good addition in this movie, and if they had made the lizard human sized, they could have done the same with Dr. Connors. I know it sounds like minutia, but people like the symptoms of transforming into a superhero/villain.

- Having the Kingpin as the main boss and the lizard as a side story (all taking place in the sewer with no king kong ending) would have been awesome.

( 9 ) All the love scenes were too much. Spiderman/Peter is always at odds with girls, until Mary Jane ( and they are super quick and a little spicy, not tender)

- Fact: According to IMDB, girls under 18 not only ranked it higher than any other group, but voted on it more than any other group as well.

- An in depth marketing study on why ""Peter"" was portrayed in this new way, google search ""Untangling Spider-Man Bob Chipman"" It was a dollars and cents decision.

- Peter was never suave like this rendition, the girl was always the aggressor - e.g. the black cat (even though that is way later in the series, it goes to show that he never becomes suave), and the scenes were really short but good.

( 10 ) Actual spider's webbing as web fluid

- We can't call it web fluid anymore.

- Although it is fiction, people enjoy the believable, and seeing as though, in reality, it took 70 people four years, using 1,000,000 (1 million) spiders to create the world's only textile made of Spider-webbing, and its only 11-foot by 4-foot (a size: medium Poncho), Oscorp would need a lot more spiders than that to make a profit. I guess you can rationalize it, but then, how would Peter get his webbing? And if he did, it would be in pretty limited supply, and their would be large sky-scrappers full of spider's to keep up with the demand.

( 11 ) No wrestling scene

- Here, they strayed from every Spider-man comic book. In Bandis version (the one they based the movie on), after breaking Flash's nose, Peter wrestles to pay off Flash's medical bills.

- It sets everything up. How he gets his costume and why he gets Ben shot.

( 12 ) Lack of storyline focus or acting focus on Peter's struggle with web-slinging. Takes away from the believability. All of a sudden, he's a pro.

( 13 ) Peter's parents helped make him Spiderman (AWH!)

( 14 ) The entire basketball scene with Flash Gordan ( unnatural responses, over the top, and in no comparison to The First Spiderman's fight scene )

- Stan Lee & Peter David's version of the basketball scene is very good, which is quoted word for word in the comments.

( 15 ) Spiderman's / Peter's Moral Compass (AWHHHHHH!!!)

- He steals milk - in the comics he would shoot out a line of webbing for a newspaper, and then, shoot back his payment from a roof overhang.
- Special thanks to Daniel Kelly's review for reminding me.

( 16 ) The entire skateboard scene ( Spiderman's a brain, not a skater athlete - skating is awesome though )

( 17 ) WATCH Spiderman: Season 1: Episode 1 - Night of The Lizard

- This sums up the whole storyline much better in 22 minutes ( remember for 1994, this is pretty good graphics )

- Another portrayal of Dr. Connors, the comic book original, was set in the Florida Everglades (I had read Anthony L. goes into this in length, so I won't)

( 18 ) All the scenes with Gwen Stacy ( they were not necessarily acted bad [I like Emma Stone], but definitely written poorly )

( 19 ) The best rendition of Spiderman's Storyline in motion picture was represented in the 1994-1998 animated series.

Theme by: Joe Perry (Aerosmith)

- As a child, I would hum the electric guitar solo with a piece of white thread connected to both arms of my Spiderman Action figure, and ""web sling down the hall.

---------------------------------------------------

Spider-man 3 [the truth]:

Unfortunately, this was Sam Raimi's first time as the main writer along with his brother. Yes, Avi Arad changed his script. Raimi didn't want to write for Venom: he didn't grow up with venom. SONY had too many cooks in the kitchen, and still does because they should have let Brian Bendis adapt his own story to this movie. As for Raimi, this is not to say he didn't do an excellent job directing the first two movies: he did. But, the snowboard glider and the infamous beatnik, goth, jazz band scene with Tobey was no bueno. Good luck to him in the horror genre (his roots) and the upcoming Evil Dead.

---------------------------------------------------

Many people thought that ""The Amazing Spider-man"" was a great movie, and although I am not one of them, it would be a shame if this review stopped you from seeing something that you would like.

Finally, I bought it as an Instant Video and started watching it.  It strays pretty far away from the original comic book story and the portrayals of Peter, Flash and Gwen don't seem quite right.  Not so good script, not so good story and not so good casting.  I think I was completely open to a reboot-- but they screwed it up.",1352937600,13,466,4.261363636363637
4422772,1,B004LWZWFQ,"Not here to talk about the movie per se, but Sony's poor delivery of their Ultraviolet garbage.  Waiting, and waiting, and waiting on digital media to download.  I'm actually on my third software download of this process.  Apparently I have need for Silverlight, and some download manager, I'm still hopeful that this will somehow end up on my iTunes account so I can actually sync it with a device I use.  Thus far I'm disappointed that I have to download the move in standard definition because apparently my desktop can't handle HD video?  Say that to Battlefield and every other video game that my machine handles.  This isn't rocket science, people.  Don't make your product difficult to interface, I could've just saved myself a ton of hassle by renting this on redbox or amazon prime and saved myself a ton of time.

Sony pictures is garbage, this will be the last time I make a purchase of any of their media products.  Shame too, I really want to watch this movie, but I think I've spent more time attempting to download it than the movie is long.",1352937600,3,1056,4.60427807486631

I think Garfield was a great choice to play Spider-Man...way better than what's his name ;) I forget the actresses name who played Gwen Stacy, but she was gorgeous and quirky as usual. The story was well thought out and kept you interested in what was going to happen next. Though the action didn't really hit until later in the movie when it does boy does it hit hard. The first person view of Spider-Man is amazing and gives you the sense that you are the web slinger. Special features are great and flesh out a bit more of the Lizard story. I had read that some of the Lizard CGI looked extremely fake (shiny), but I really didn't notice it on my 46"" Samsung LCD. I thought everything about this movie was great and I recommend it to all superhero and comic book fans around the world.",1352937600,2,885,4.3053892215568865

4422807,5,B004LWZWFQ,"I alot of Fans love the Sam Raimi films. They were fine for what they where. Shined at moments & didn't seem to understand the comic universe the next & that's where Amazing Shines, it always seems to understand the sourde material.
  Raimi told a very close to comic origin back in 2002 the problem was after he became Spider-man the movie seemed to stray far from the comic, No Quibs from Spidey, organic web shooterd, MJ as his first love. And there is realy no clear plot for Green Goblin, How ever in Amazing, they seem to keep the story and source true.
 The origin is changed alot, they get rid of him trying to cash in on his powers and skip the wrestling scene. ( Witch I loved It felt more fresh) Peter makes the costume to help him track down his uncles killer.
 The rest is more faithfull to the comics then Raimi's trilogy. Peter makes his web shooters, His first love is Actualy Gwen Stacy (played briliantly by Emma  Stone) They realy capture the Conner/peter friendship, & Spidey's the quibster a must!",1352851200,2,1018,4.451612903225806
4422808,1,B004LWZWFQ,"This movie is at best redundant and unnecessary and at worst a hollow mess. Doing the origin story again only ten years after we first saw it was stupid. Especially when you're hitting all the same beats and doing it worse. I don't think anything during the origin bits works as good here as it did in Rami's SPIDER-MAN. Everything is more contrived and feels like it's just hitting a checklist.

I think worse than that are the things this movie tries to do that are new. It can't commit to anything. The whole secret about Peter's parents is abandoned almost as quickly as it's introduced. (I can't believe they're still marketing that stuff for the DVD release.) Same goes for the whole searching for Uncle Ben's killer plot line. The Lizard is also a terribly uninteresting villain whose motivations are not sympathetic at all. Connors just becomes a pure bad guy when he's changed. Also what happened to that SWAT team that got turned into lizard people? They're changed and never seen again. A nitpick, sure, but the movie is constantly pulling this stuff. It adds up.

The love story stuff isn't good either. Yes, Stone and Garfield have good chemistry together but the relationship is written terribly. There's no conflict to it. They like each other right away and then they date and they never have any problems. It's boring. Also, what's the deal with the mumblecore exchanges between the two of them?

However, the WORST thing about this movie is the very last line of the movie, in which Peter happily goes back on a pretty big promise he made another character a few scenes earlier. It's awful because it shows his character has had no growth. He starts the movie as a selfish douche and that's exactly how he ends it. This is especially weird because the montage directly before that last scene makes you think that Peter has finally learned what it means to be a hero and then no, no he hasn't.

I would give this two stars cuz it is at least watchable, but I dunno why you would watch this instead of Raimi's trilogy, even the third one. You can call those movies campy, but they at least understand competent storytelling. Also only one star because it was stupid to do the origin story again. Just make a new Spider-Man with this new cast and crew.

Oh just kidding the worst thing about this movie is the crane operators.",1352851200,6,2341,4.60431654676259
4422809,5,B004LWZWFQ,"My family of 3 boys, my husband and myself (and all their male friends) demand a lot out of a movie. We all agreed this was the best of all the Spiderman movies. At first look I didn't think Emma and certainly not Andrew could pull it off, but much to my suprise, they both did amazing and believable jobs in their roles. I particularly liked how Emma was allowed to be smart and have an active role, not just a victim to be saved, and Andrew WAS Spiderman. He was quirky and goofy and awkward, all very endearing qualities for someone who then transforms into a vigilante hero.  He was awfully cute in this role and looking like someone who could actually BE bullied made the role that much more believable. I also really liked the emotion by them both in the emotional scenes. Andrew was AMAZING in his emotional scenes. As to the giant lizard? He was cool. Some parts of the movie were kind of over the top but hey, this movie is for fun, not life or death. Its ENTERTAINMENT. I also really liked the end where the booms lined up... oh yeah, not going to spoil it, but to see the blue collar workers help out Spidey? yes, liked it very much.  Its worth buying. We've already watched it several times and it is worth watching over and over. I catch new things each time we watch.",1352851200,2,1281,4.289256198347108
4422810,3,B004LWZWFQ,"The problem with this film is close to nothing, however, it breezes through a origin story that nearly every Spider-Man fan has memorized and changes parts of the mythology that make the story what it is. For a story that better captures the origin story and Peter Parker's true personality, watch Sam Raimi's 2002&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spider-Man/dp/B000O19EWK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spider-Man</a>&nbsp;starring Tobey Maguire. The best thing about this film over that one are the performances (especially from Emma Stone who plays Gwen Stacy, and Rhys Ifans as Dr. Curt Connors/Lizard). That's about it. Stone shines as Stacy -- a vital part to the Spider-Man mythology who deserved better justice in Raimi's trilogy. BUT ... Parker's parents are hardly featured in the comic AND his father was not some scientist who helped develop the cross-species DNA splicing. In the comic, Parker's father was a Special Forces soldier working for Nick Fury. And while that's OK to alter that aspect, what's not OK is altering Peter Parker's entire personality, making him some brooding, artsy, skateboarder teenager. Also, it feels like the movie abruptly ends -- a problem that is difficult to fix. This adaptation is good for younger audiences and those who don't know the character or mythology well, or for those who haven't seen Raimi's movies (the second one being the only really good one). While I feel the second film in this series will be much better, this one did not really impress.",1352851200,,1543,5.460251046025105
4422811,5,B004LWZWFQ,"When Peter Parker finds a briefcase that belonged to his Father, it puts him on a quest to understand his parents' death which leads him directly to Oscorp and the lab of Dr. Connors  who is his father's former partner. Sneaking around Oscorp, Peter finds himself in the middle of Connors' experiments which leads to him getting bitten by a radioactive genetically modified spider. During his ride home, Peter soon finds out that the bite has endowed him with superhuman abilities(such as strength, speed, the ability to sense oncoming danger and the ability to stick to surfaces) when he gets into a fight with a subway passenger. When his Uncle Ben gets killed, Peter takes up the mantle as Spider-Man and fight crime in the city. Spider-Man then meets up with Connors' alter-ego, The Lizard. It's then that Peter makes life-altering choices that take him down the path of his destiny to being a hero.

I'm really impressed. The Amazing Spider Man is even better than I was really expecting it to be. Better than Raimi's Spider Man films, in some respects. Judging from all the reviews I read on the film when it first hit theaters and then reading the ones here at Amazon after it hit DVD & Blu-Ray, I was expecting this movie to be a huge disappointment and a real snoozefest. It ended up being anything but. I think people disliked this movie for the simple fact that Sam Raimi wasn't involved with it. I enjoyed this movie, dare I say it, alot more than the Avengers movie(and the Avengers was the top movie of the summer). It held my interest alot better, that's for sure.

My only gripe with the movie didn't really have much to do with the movie, at all, really. It dealt with the design of Spider Man's outfit.  I know Webb was trying to create an outfit that looked like something a teenager could create but it was just horrendous looking. It reminded me of the costume from the old TV series of the same name from way back in the 70s(which I'd love to see released on DVD, btw). I hope that Webb, eventually, makes gradual changes in the design(as movies go on) to make it look like the Spidey we all know and love.

For a reboot, this movie rocked!",1352851200,2,2162,4.5191815856777495

The reason why Spider-man is a hero, is not due to his powers, but the character of Peter Parker.  Peter Parker always attempted to do the right thing even when life told him it was far easier to do it the wrong way.  He didn't accept stolen goods.  He didn't use his powers to pick up women or belittle others.  He didn't lash out at the people he loved. So, who really cares at the end of this movie if he lives or dies?

These are good but not great effects. It is a good cast that struggles because there is very little time for the emotional development of Peter Parker because of the setting. High School is a far more chaotic hence difficult environment to develop the story of a lonely skate boarding nerd as the film rushed head long into the powers phase a bit too quickly. It's a shame someone with a little patience and the right money couldn't grab the series and more fully integrate it into the stylistic and continuity driven world of the current Marvel movies as culminated in The Avengers. Juast imagine if they could have settled the rights issues and really merged all the great properties for that incredible battle in The Avengers. Oh well, this is still fun, although being a bit disjointed, a bit juvenile it is still totally crazy fun.

4422840,3,B004LWZWFQ,"There were some good points to this movie: I like that they minimized the traditional Hollywood ""trying to figure out his powers"" silliness.  I like that Parker developed his own web-slingers, as in the source material.  The action scenes were also quite good. However, there are some bad parts, too.

One of the reasons that I watched this movie was an article I read in a sci-fi magazine, where it was mentioned that the director and actors were chosen specifically to show the more human side of the superhero.  They failed abysmally.  While the ""witty"" Spider-Man dialogue during the action scenes was passable, the dialogue of Peter Parker himself--especially with the female lead--was horrible, and slow to the point of being agonizing.  I could really, REALLY have done without the ""Spider-Man is the result of a SECRET CONSPIRACY his father was invovled in!!!"" nonsense.  Hollywood needs to just erase anything involving ""conspiracy"" from their production list for about 20 years.  A far more interesting angle to play would have been to spend more time examining the villain's drive to FORCIBLY IMPROVE the human race.  I think that could be used to say quite a bit about our current society.

The supporting cast was badly-chosen; obviously they were there to put some name power in the production, rather than for their ability to portray the actual characters (this was one of the stronger features of the last series of Spider-Man movies).  Speaking of the last series, it's really not that old.  Another bit from the article I read mentioned that ""these stories can be told over and over again""--why not just tell it ONCE, and do it right?  Nobody is re-making Citizen Kane (yet...  don't even think about it, Hollywood).  I'd much prefer an ongoing series, where the character develops (as the Avengers project seems to be).  Perhaps someday Hollywood will remember how to write about heroes, and we can see the stories of mature characters who act like adults... rather than the constant jumble of anti-heroes and bungling newbies.

4422841,5,B004LWZWFQ,"What gives the the 3.5 Amazon rating? As a long time fan of Spider-Man comics, I think this movie was one heck of a reboot. Far better than the other Trilogy, this movie felt closer to the comics than any other version (going back to 70's here).

They couldn't have chosen better actors to fill the roles, music was impressive, strong story and character development.

And a 3.5 is all it gets... same as Twilight. Wow.",1352764800,3,419,4.5
4422842,4,B004LWZWFQ,"It may seem longer but it's only been 10 years since Spider-man first swung his way across the silver screen increasing the public interest in seeing major films spun from comic book titles. And yet Sony has decided that it needed something fresh, it needed a reboot to the series. This could be because the stars would now be seeking bigger bucks when it came to contract time. Or it could be that the success of the third film in that series didn't live up to their expectations. In any event, a reboot was released and now makes its way to DVD. Was it worth it?

THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN ups the ante by not just picking up where the other films left off but starting from scratch. Instead of Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) automatically living with his Aunt May (Sally Field) and Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen), we get to see a glimpse of his parents, secretive scientists who whisk him away to the aunt and uncle when their home is broken into leaving behind only Peter and a briefcase that comes into play later on.

Peter in this version isn't the stereotypical science nerd as depicted in the first film or in the comics. He comes off more as a brooding teen who still get picked on and who has yet decided to be a professional photographer. He has issues with his adoptive parents like any teen and seeking answers comes across the aforementioned briefcase with a hidden compartment containing a formula and a picture of his father alongside another scientist, Dr. Curt Conners (Rhys Ifans).

Sneaking in with a group in intern wannabes Peter discovers Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), the girl he worships from afar, works for him as Oscorp. During the tour he catches the attention of Connors and eventually reveals that he is the son of his old friend. It is also during this visit that Peter is bitten by a DNA enhances spider that provides him with the ever popular hero's super powers, those of a spider. He explores just what these will do and keeps his findings to himself.

Connors and Peter begin working together on the formula that Peter found and apply it to a project Connors has been working on, combining interspecies DNA in the hopes of finding cures such as a reptiles ability to re-grow body parts. Connors has a personal interest in this as he lost an arm years ago.

After forgetting to pick up his aunt one night, Peter and his uncle get into a fight with Peter running off as a result. When Ben goes to search for Peter, he is gunned down by a many Peter could have stopped who robbed a grocery store. Now the character turns dark and seeks vengeance on the man who killed his uncle, tracking down every punk criminal in a dark alley and getting the police involved in searching for a masked vigilante in the process.

But here's the only problem I had with this movie. Connors won't rush the test results of his project through to satisfy Oscorp so they plan on canceling the project. That night he injects himself and not only does his arm grow back, he changes into a giant lizard as well. When he wreaks havoc on the city, Peter changes his plans and all thoughts about his uncle's killer disappear and combating the Lizard takes center stage. There isn't a smooth enough transition here and it makes the movie feel like two movies in one, neither of which is complete.

Along the way to the inevitable final confrontation between good guy and bad, Peter continues to fall in love with Gwen and find that love returned, meets her father the police chief (Dennis Leary) who he argues with over the objectives of Spider-man and continues to have problems at home and school.

One thing those at Marvel have almost always done right is hiring the perfect people to cast as their characters. There isn't a single actor here who doesn't get the part and perform it well. None of them take the performances of the previous actors and apply them here, instead making these characters their own. Garfield in particular doesn't give off the total nerd vibe that Tobey McGuire did so well, instead playing Peter as a teen filled with the usual angst and rebellious nature that he must learn to control as much as his powers.

As should be expected the effects are amazing, pun intended, and the visual feel of the film goes the opposite of the original films. Everything here seems dark, from the colors used for Spider-man's costume to the settings. Most of the action takes place at night making the film at times seem more along the lines of the Batman films than Spider-man which was always a bright colored adventure in the comics.

All that aside, I actually found that I liked this film. Perhaps not the first time I watched it, but on DVD certain things made more sense to me. The skateboarding that Peter does connected with the poses used by Spider-man as he leaps from building to building, web to web. As I said, with the exception of the seemingly split storyline, the film is really quite entertaining. Not only is this one a movie worth watching, its one worth adding to your collection as well.",1352764800,3,5020,4.567777777777778

Perhaps in another five years, yet ANOTHER reboot will get pumped out with lots of CGI and 3D effects for the mass to eat up.

Emma Stone is a great actress and a GORGEOUS (consistent with the comics, and a far cry above Kirsten Dunst in both respects.) Denis Leary, Sally Field and Martin Sheen all do their roles justice. The story has HEART and stays true to the legend of Spider-Man. This reboot was just the right move after the travesty that was Spider-Man 3.

However this is not a review of the actual movie. My problem is with Sony and this Ultra-Violet non-sense. Seriously? This is the first movie I have purchased with Ultra-Violet (rather than a real digital copy) and I am not pleased at all. I did not want to create a new account to download my movie, but I did it. I did not want to create YET ANOTHER account with Flixter (to link with the UVU account) but I did it because I want to be able to enjoy the movie on iTunes. Well here is a warning for you: If you use the license code on the UVU website, it will disallow you from using it on Flixter to transfer to iTunes because you have already used the code on UVU (or whatever the name of the site is. Seriously, who cares? It's an iTunes/Android world, Sony. Come to peace with it already.)

I wanted the Blu-Ray and should be able to have a true USEFUL digital copy for the price I paid. Needless to say, I am not happy with the packaging and feel swindled. I am not inclined to jump through all the hoops to get the iTunes situation corrected, and from what I have seen online about Ultra-Violet it looks like that's a whole new fresh hell for most people. Maybe later after I've climbed down from the ceiling I will go through those motions. For now: I can't recommend this package unless you are just needing the hard copy Blu-Ray or DVD.

4422885,4,B004LWZWFQ,"I have been a Spider-Man fan since the original comic came out in the early 1960s.  Spider-Man in my opinion is one of the very best super-heros and in many ways the ""Spider-Man"" series brought the Superhero genre to its peak.  Spider-Man, apart from his super-powers, is an ordinary guy with ordinary problems.  Peter Parker was a nerd before the word ""nerd"" was invented.  Fans of the comic book series loved this aspect of the story -- Peter was a regular guy who was about as screwed up as most of us were in our early and mid-teens.  Bookworms like me could relate to Peter and dislike popular, good looking, girl-getting, superior in all respect jocks like Flash Thompson, who was prominent in the early Spider-Man stories.  Further, the comic stories were unusually well-written for the comic book genre.

The point of this film is that Peter Parker in this story is more true to life than in the original ""Spider-Man"" movies.  He is awkward and nerdish.  My main criticism of the story line is that Peter quickly wins over Gwen Stacy and cannot wait to blurt out his secret identity to her, and later her cop father.  In the original comic series Peter was fanatically secretive about his secret identity and never revealed it to anyone until much later when he gets married.  Here, he wins the girl straightaway (the lovely Gwen Stacy -- are those dresses hot or what?) and departs from the Peter Parker that old fans like myself knew and loved.

For all that this is a pretty good film.  I liked the way that they modernized the plot in terms of how Peter got his super-powers, and how Connors becomes ""The Lizard.""  The Lizard episode in the comic strip was one of my very favorites, by the way.  Mostly it is done fairly well here, and the storyline does a very good job explaining it.

Enjoyable, especially after watching it a second time with my son.  RJB.",1352678400,,1871,4.587349397590361
4422886,4,B004LWZWFQ,"This reboot of Spidey came about when Raimi's directing of a potential SPIDERMAN 4 fell apart for various reasons. In this reboot Andrew Garfield plays a skinny Peter Parker which fits the recent comics artwork more so than Tobey's time in the trilogy (though I felt Tobey's Spidey tales was better until SPIDERMAN 3 and then it got somewhat stupid). His love interest is not Mary Jane but an actual character from Marvel Comics called Gwen Stacy (who was supposed to have been the first love of Peter Parker) who is played by Emma Stone (most people know her from GLEE).

There is a great deal more teenage angst in this picture and while Tobey Maguire brought a steady coolness to his role Andrew Garfield tends to bring a frenetic energy to the role that made him feel more like an American teenager. Speaking of which there's a more impressive cast in this reboot which includes: Dennis Leary, Martin Sheen, Sally Field, Campbell Scott, Rhys Ifans and C. Thomas Howell.

Peter Park is more of a science whiz kid in this picture and has a connection with Oscorps. There's also an actual scientific illustration of how Parker gains his powers in this film unlike the usual freak accident coming about. The Lizard opponent is big and tough but I felt they didn't milk the potential emotional tension. Woops.

So how does it compare to the Tobey Maguire trilogy? I think the story was good but not as good as the previous trilogy. This current trilogy obviously has better special effects. Dawwwwwwhhhh. This trilogy has a more accurate take on a teenage superhero and I like that they're playing around with Gwen Stacy.

Look for the usual Stan Lee cameo appearance. Themes of everybody missing something in their life is rampant.

4422887,2,B004LWZWFQ,"The problem is not the actors. Not the directing. It's the laughable screenplay rifled with plot holes and the cheap CGI effects.

The screenplay is a huge culprit here in that it induces a lot of disbelief and quite frankly, insults the audience's intelligence.

--SPOILERS ALERT--

SCREENPLAY

Gwen Stacy is able to create an antidote to the lizard effects in the amount of time of a Thursday night sitcom. Seriously? This presupposes that she understood exactly what's going on in Dr. Connor's DNA during the transformation period. Well, that's funny. Because I don't think even Dr. Connor's knows what's up with his DNA. Shoot- Gwen, you're hot and you have smarts. But, you're wasting your talents if you're just in Midtown Science High School. You should be curing cancer and hosting fundraisers with your talents on a full-time basis.

Spider-Man leaves his camera in the sewers with a label stating ""Property of Peter Parker"". It almost felt like a tribute to the Simpsons' episode where Bart loses his radio down the well. The one that says ""Property of Bart Simpson"". Except, Bart isn't a genius. Peter Parker, supposedly is. That's a convenient plot hole. The film fails to explain why he's even labeled his own camera equipment. Mind you, he has yet to work for the Daily Bulge in the film.

Captain Stacy's dying wish is that Peter won't involve Gwen in his crime-fighting because it'll endanger her life. But, at the last scene of the film, Gwen gives Peter the silent treatment, and Peter basically hints at that this promise is as good as a politician's promise. So-- it's like, go screw yourself, Dennis Leary. I'm going to continue nailing your daughter right after class is over.

Spider-Man gets nailed by a bullet from the police and, as a result, is in such physical agony, pain, and limping about that he's unable to even properly scale a building. Err... where's the spider strength? The problem is that Spider-Man in this film is reduced from super hero to super human. A single bullet from a policeman's rifle is able to almost cripple thy superhero? WTF.
Note to self: Use 2 bullets to defeat Spider-Man.

Spider-Man's battle with the Lizard. It's almost comical in that it isn't by intelligence or his sheer strength that he defeats the Lizard. It's by a fortunate appearance by Captain Stacy (and his unfortunate death) that distracts the Lizard and buys Spidey enough time to insert the antidote into the dispersal device. Again-- another instance of Spider-Man being reduced to a mere super human.

Peter Parker is kind of an idiot. The multiple, multiple times he reveals himself. Hey! Lemme take off my mask and reveal my identity, random kid. Hey, Gwen. You're hot. Lemme show you my web-slinger so I can make out with you. Hey, Captain Stacy, this handcuffs will surely hold me--or not. Because I have superhuman strength and can easily break through these handcuffs but would rather you ambush me first and make things exciting.

Throw in ""The Dark Knight Returns"" epic storyline where the police are launching a manhunt after Spider-Man because he's a vigilante and not putting forth more manpower towards the actual threat to the city. Yeah-- this isn't quite like Batman. Spider-Man is just nailing the Police Commissioner's daughter, unlike Batman who threatened the lives of the Police Commissioner's children and allegedly killed the District Attorney.

CGI

The computer graphics in this film are terribly fake and cheap when compared to other Marvel Studios' films: ""Iron Man 2"" and ""The Avengers"". I would rate the CGI effects in this film about on par with ""The Fantastic Four"" films and below the quality of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy.

Overall: I'm not looking forward to the sequels if this is what's to come.",1352592000,,3762,4.924170616113744
4422888,4,B004LWZWFQ,"Ok I'll be the first to say I enjoyed the older Sam Raimi directed films and was a huge comics fan as a kid. Tobey McGuire was good, but I have to say that this movie depicts Spidey the closest to the way he is in the comics. Maybe not the new age more hip Peter Parker, but referring to Spidey's actions, smart ass remarks, and the way he carries himself in the film. The details even the way he web slings and his mannerisms were closely related to the way he is in the comics. I enjoyed the plot and cast of actors. Loved how they adapted the story of Peter's parents and I am sure more details will unravel in the upcoming films. The way he became Spidey relating to the scientific work of Dr. Connor was different than the way he became Spidey in the comics, but fit the plot of the movie very well. And for those that say that not having Peter work for the Daily Bugle and not having Jonah Jameson in the movie was a mistake, I just think the story line has not reached to that point yet.. Peter was in High School and had not even met Mary Jane which I am sure will be the case in the upcoming films. Overall Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone and the cast did a great job. Enjoyed the director Marc Webb's slight new edgier Spidey feel and his film making skills. The 3D was very dope even though you saw the effects in more detail in some scenes than others. What people need to understand is that 3D is not just having objects or effects flying at you 24/7 throughout the movie. It is the detail and clarity of the movie as well that you can appreciate the 3D. It looked bad ass watching it on my LG Cinema True Motion SmartTV 3D HDTV!

This near-abomination of a film is an insult to Spidey's golden age. Fighting with crabby Uncle Ben and Aunt May? Hipster skater boi Peter Parker? Curt Connors just as much a villain as The Lizard? Spidey and Lizard origins connected? No J. Jonah Jameson? I was so aggravated by this film that my wife was afraid that children sitting nearby would hear my vulgar muttering.

The only thing that kept this movie from one-star oblivion was Emma Stone and Denis Leary, both of whom were better than the material.

The new costume design is beyond horrendous. Steve Ditko's Spidey costume design cannot be improved upon, so why try?

Sam Raimi's SM2 remains the quintessential Spidey film.",1352592000,8,795,4.664285714285715

4422894,4,B004LWZWFQ,"As a huge fan of Raimi's trilogy, yes even the well hated third, I was cautious and skeptical about this reboot. That isn't to say that I wasn't excited about it though. I was very much looking forward to Mark Webb's take on the classic lore of such an awesome character. Off the bat, I preferred the casting and cinematography in this film to Raimi's, but I questioned if Webb (who gave us one of my all-time favorite romantic comedies in (500) Days of Summer) could deliver the action that a high-flying acrobatic hero like Spidey should bring. I'm happy to say he did.

There are a good number of Spidey moments and poses that should excite any geek that has a history with the comics. And the web-shooters, yes! Finally non-organic web-shooters. The classic idea of Peter running out of his webbing when he was in the heat of battle was captured very nicely in this film. I've read the complaints about the teenage love between Gwen Stacy and Peter being too Twilight-esque, and to those people I ask, ""Have you ever read a Spider-Man comic?""

The love stories between he and his different love interests (be it Gwen Stacy, or Mary Jane Watson) have always been prominent. And believe it, or not, teenage love did exist long before Twilight was ever conceived, and it will be around for many decades to come. So let's end the constant mentioning of Twilight every time teenagers in films have romantic relationships. Besides, I felt like Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone were so well casted and played so well off of each other, that I believed their characters.

As for our villain, the Lizard was a villain that we had been waiting to see manifest ever since we first caught a glimpse of the one-armed Dylan Baker in Spider-Man 2, and I feel like Rhys Ifans take on the character was as good as I expected it to be. Sure, there is room for improvement (namely the physical design, and his speech -- I wanted to hear hisses when he spoke), but that's just my opinion. It didn't take away from my enjoyment of the film. The CG was very good, from his scales and wounds, all the way down to peeling skin and wrinkles. And at least Conners was a very well fleshed out character with his alter-ego having a sense of genuine purpose and presence, as opposed to being a hulking brute that only served as fight scene fodder, and best of all, he's still alive. So will we see more of him in the future?

Maybe, maybe not, but he's still alive in that universe for possible future exploration. The connection we get to Peter's quest for self, and to his relationship with his birth parents and adopted parents are wonderful, in my opinion. I loved Martin Sheen, Sally Field, and Andrew Garfield's charisma and interaction. As for the Blu-ray treatment, it's a technically flawless presentation. There should be no questioning of the audio or picture quality. And thankfully, the extras are thorough! A great commentary and an in-depth Making-of documentary. Plus other little extras, like Deleted Scenes, etc. I highly recommend this one. Pick it up!",1352592000,,3044,4.652416356877324
4422895,2,B004LWZWFQ,"I hadn't seen the trailer for ""The Amazing Spider Man but I was expecting to see a fresh take on the Spider Man movie franchise. You know, a new story, new characters...stuff like that.

What a shock then, to discover that ""The Amazing Spider Man"" is essentially a remake of the very first Spider Man installment. Peter Parker gets beaten up by bullies at school, he gets bitten by a spider, he realizes that stuff sticks to his body, he gets revenge on the bullies, he disappoints Uncle Ben and Aunt May, Uncle Ben gets shot, he goes around catching villains, particularly the one who shot uncle Ben, the New York Police issues a warrant for Spider Man's arrest....blah blah blah. Hasn't this been done ten years ago? Why, yes it has. And much, much better I might add.

 What would be the point of re-introducing Spider Man to movie audiences in 2012? It's a rhetorical question, of course, since the answer would be to make more money. Remake the first movie; slap a new poster on it since the kids of today wouldn't catch wind of it because they are so monumentally stupid, and start rebuilding a franchise. Money, money, money! The remake has become the new Hollywood cash machine, and nobody seems to notice or care. Hollywood is f&#*ing up the great classics with newer, insipid and mediocre versions. (The Karate Kid, Total Recall and yes, Robocop - just wait and see.)

Tobey McGuire needed to be replaced. Unfortunately they chose Andrew Garfield, who turns out to be even more of a dork than McGuire. Don't let the hip hairstyle fool you. I laughed at his feminine voice, too. Emma Stone was the only highlight of this film. She's just wonderful. Do your best and avoid this sad film. I can only imagine what the poor Spider Man Fanboys must be going through right now. Their favourite movie, re-made, then re-packaged and re-sold as a piece of crap. Poor fanboys. Their only hope for Super Hero Films lies with the next Josh Whedon installment.",1352592000,2,1956,4.644508670520231
4422926,1,B004LWZWFQ,"What They Got Right?

1.) Gwen Stacy - Emma Stone
Perfect casting. She dresses and looks like Gwen.
She is smart and charismatic and at times rebellious. For
some reason she is interested in an elitist emo type named
Peter Parker. Go figure.

2.) Bluebird Sally Avril - Kelsey Chow
Kelsey Chow, fresh from the Disney channel and onto the big screen.
She gets a brief appearance here but it is one of the
only characters they get right in this horrid mess.
She is gorgeous but not at all interested in Peter. With
how Peter Parker behaves I don't blame her.

3.) Parker Builds A Web-Shooter (Web Slinger)
That's great and all. Too bad he stole the webbing.

4.) Stan Lee
Yup a Stan Lee cameo. Nuff said.

What They Got Wrong?

1.) The 3D elements of this Blu-ray are some of the worst
I have ever encountered. Scenes that appear at first to
be suited for the 3D spectacle fall far short. Most of
the picture seems to have been done in flat 2D while only
a 'few' scenes have any pop.

2.) Peter Parker - Andrew Garfield
Peter Parker is a self serving and arrogant hipster with
a skateboard under his feet and an Ipod always in hand.
He is disobedient to authority and an elitist to those he
sees below himself (aka teachers and nerdy students).
Peter Parker is a bad boy and an emo type at once, all
this seems to catch the attention of two girls, but mainly
fellow student Gwen Stacy. Peter is prone to lie to
others and seems to resent his aunt May and Uncle Ben.
He is highly intelligent while seemingly a snob as a
result. Parker is an outcast by choice and is oft picked
on by the jocks of his school, namely Flash Thompson.
This Peter Parker mumbles and stutters alot. Peter
is just fine with stealing a bottle of milk (hey, he
tried to pay for it right?) or keeping quiet when an
innocent man is taken to jail. Morals? Peter Parker dont
need no stinking morals!
He likes to take pictures also, but likely just as an
excuse to stalk the pretty girls of his school. Sure he
wears glasses too. He puts on a pair of his fathers
spectacles, not due to any eye stigma mind you. Nope,
rather as the hipster emo this Peter Parker really is.

3.) Flash Thompson - Chris Zylka
Flash is both jock and school bully. An over the top
school bully, prone to punching Parker and pushing other
students around. Where are the teachers during all these
incidents and why is this Flash not locked up some where?
Oh well. This Flash picks on Parker seemingly with the
hope that Parker will join his group of jocks. In one
scene Flash gives Parker a big hug and tells him something
along the lines of ""You are coming along fine Parker, see
you tomorrow so we can dunk the new kids head in a
toilet."" Well something like that any way...

4.) May Parker - Sally Field
The flying nun is aunt May. Wait are they serious? They
cast Sally Field as Aunt May? So Peter Parker always
comes home with these large bruises all over his face and
body but our Aunt May never really questions why. She
just sits there in utter disbelief. Our Parker does not seem
to care much for Aunt May or ole Uncle Ben for that
matter anyway.

5.) Ben Parker - Martin Sheen
Charlie Sheens dad is Ben Parker. We all know how Charlie
turned out so now we understand what went wrong with this
jerk Peter.

6.) George Stacy - Denis Leary
Stacy is younger here. He is kinda clueless most of the
time and does not like Spider-Man at all. Leary is good
in spots but something is off. Leary didn't know much
about Spider-Man stories to begin with and he kinda
phones it in most scenes.

7.) Lizard Doc Connors - Rhys Ifans
The CGI lizard looks bad in most scenes. It looks too digital
and the movements are not at all natural. Dr Connors
feels like a stand-in for the role. Just mostly a rushed
character and not too well defined.

8.) Spider-Man - CGI & Andrew Garfield
The POV scenes are awful. The CGI is TOO digital. This
Spider-Man can duck bullets in one scene but has to
outrun a group of slow thugs in the next. Oh by the by, Spidey is a
jerk too. He has to have cranes lined up at one point so
he can quickly get to a tower. Spidey is limited in
strength as well. He gets hurt easily and is very weak.
At the same time he lightly touches a door knob and it
explodes. Does his super power turn on and off at random?
In some scenes his head is too big like..an alien.",1352592000,6,4321,4.229368932038835
4422927,3,B004LWZWFQ,"How many times does Petey get bitten? Didn't know this was Peter Parker, all over again. Thought, heck, by now they must have developed his character, made him older, changed his name, done a prequel. But noo. He's a nerd hero, goes up against jock goliath, triumphs in science and gets bi10 by a spider. I like the other one where the spider's fangs are shown, biting in to Toby Maguire's neck.  That scene had crunch. The pacing on this one, though, admittedly, is sharper and tangier. And Peter's diffident, yeah, well, ok demeanor is an accurate upgrade(?) for today's generation. But you can totally say goodbye to reality here.
Not that spidey was ever about reality. You can tell, though, that the minute that Petey steals an interns badge and discovers his high school crush is head of the Science, Research and Genetics Division of OSCORP the worlds leading developer of Wtfomgoggery and sneaks in to the deepest inner core of OSCORP'S secret research lab and discovers the bio cumfungimubble,  five minutes in to story that this thing had better be character driven because the plot.

4422928,5,B004LWZWFQ,"After nearly a year of looking forward to the beginning of a new franchise featuring my favorite superhero, I was ecstatic to be invited by Sony to an advance screening hours before the fanboys began to line up for their midnight shows.
Despite Sony and theater's regrettable idea to present the film in 3D at an advance screening, I found the movie rather genuine.
After many critics and audience members found it unreasonable to have a reboot only five years after Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man 3"" and ten years after the Raimi franchise began, I found this film refreshing from Raimi's flicks. Now, I didn't hate the Raimi franchise, but I didn't like it either. 2002's ""Spider-Man"" was enjoyable and I remember buying it on DVD despite my young age when it released. The next two Raimi films, though, I began to like less and less. In fact, I LOVED that they kept Mary-Jane out of this film. I felt like it brought a lot of unneeded drama to the Raimi films, and even though I may just not have liked how Kirsten Dunst played Mary-Jane, I strongly disliked the moody character who always felt she had to be angry at Peter Parker. I honestly hated when she would show up in the scenes. This is unlike Emma Stone playing Gwen Stacy, who first of all is super hot, but second of all, just brought life to the scenes and made me really like the character.
Speaking of good and bad casting, Andrew Garfield was a TERRIFIC Peter Parker! I mean, he blew Tobey Maguire away as far as getting close to comic-book Peter Parker goes. When Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen was terrific by the way) died, and Peter cried over his dying Uncle, his acting began to bring his British accent out of him when he cried for someone to call an ambulance, but in a good way, I liked it. And (No Spoilers Ahead) when he was sad the next day at school, I really felt for him... and I never feel anything in film... I sit there as emotionless as a brick.... but my eyes were burning... maybe from sadness for the character, maybe from the 3D.
The direction by Marc Webb was outstanding, especially the visuals. I didn't really notice any MAJOR audio ""wow""s, although I didn't notice audio continuity in EQs. Possibly deliberate by the filmmakers, but it distracted me a bit.
Cast was great, visual effects were great, stunts were cool, story was enjoyable - especially the new origin. It made a lot more sense. Something that bothered me, however, is Andrew Garfield said he has played the role as an angry teen, left by his parents. The producers threw in the shot of the newspaper that says his parents died in a car crash after the film was shot. This was obvious, especially in one scene where he refers to his parents' absence. He seemed too angry at his dead parents, the producers should have left it be.
Finally, it did miss a moment of shock and epicness at the end. Spoiler in the next paragraph...

SPOILER ALERT
----
Near the end of the film, the Lizard turns a group of cops into mutant lizards. They could have really had a great showdown with Spidey, but instead, they are forgotten about until the end when they are cured. I was kind of hoping for a big fight. Maybe it was a deleted scene, but I think it should've been in there.
----
SPOILER END

Overall, I give ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" 4/5 stars... and I'll be first in line for ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2""... the extra scene about one minute into the credits gives some foreshadowing to the sequel.

PS - I loved Stan Lee's cameo more than any of his other cameos.

The Amazing Spiderman is definitely a different story than the one told in Raimi's initial effort, and it wasn't a bad movie...it was a good movie actually. But did it come too soon on the heels of Raimi's trilogy?

I for one didn't need a retelling of how Peter Parker became Spiderman so soon after the (relatively) recent Maguire Spiderman movie(s). I'd have much preferred a new Spiderman story that just picked up where Raimi left off, albeit with a different guy (Andrew Garfield) in the lead role and a new director. But I guess Webb wanted to make the franchise his, and he sold Marvel on the idea. So, we'll just have to get our brains around that. Perhaps as Webb's continuation of the telling of Spiderman's story continues into sequel (which has been confirmed), the feeling of a little boredom and redundancy that I felt while watching the retelling part of ""how Peter became Spidey"" will dissipate.

But like I said earlier, The Amazing Spiderman was still a good movie. I was definitely entertained. It was well acted, well directed and fun to watch. However, adding to the redundancy dilemma was a lack of non-stop action in a movie that ran for over 2 hours. Even after the final battle in the movie there was like 10 or 15 minutes of further dialogue and character development. The retelling of the beginning of Spiderman could have been done in way less than two hours...especially so soon after ""the other"" Spiderman movie(s).

Spiderman fans, superhero movie fans...you've got a new take on Spidey to check out here. It's definitely worth a spot near the top of your queue. But just be prepared to have that slight feeling of dj vu as you watch.

TL;DR.  This movie sucked.

First of all, 0 chemistry between peter and gwen.  They tried so hard to make us feel a connection between them and it was not working.

Secondly,  his backpack magically appears and disappears from scene to scene.  The people making this movie did not seem to catch that.

So many questions.....
When did spiderman become such a douche?
How was peter able to stick and climb the walls with shoes on?
How did all that webbing fit into his spiderman watch?
How was the watch strong enough to support his weight while swinging?  That must have been one sturdy watch.
When lizard man grabbed his arms and crushed his watch, how did it not break his arms?
Why was there a tank of liquid nitrogen on the roof?
Why did the lizard man need to stop by the office on the way to blow his missile up? He could have done it from anywhere.  When did the lizard man get enough time to hook his missile up to the speaker system to advertise the time left before the launch?
At the end, Spiderman falls off the building and lizardman catches him so he won't fall...WHY?  Peter can stick to and climb walls. He did not need lizardman's help.

Ok, so it is in a comic universe where anything is possible I guess.  Still I was not impressed. Why Stan Lee?

If this version does anything it reminds us Spider-man fans just how great the first two Toby Maguire movies really were. (Never really cared that much for #3)
It's too bad really. I understand Sony's dire need for cash input but instead of starting over they should have simply continued the story line from where #3 left off.
Visually speaking of the entire cast Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy the only perfect one. And the whole story line about Peter's mysterious parents, in my opinion, is not a needed one.
The other thing they finally got right was Peter's web shooters. (Mechanical not genetic.)
This is not a bad movie just not as enjoyable.

4422981,5,B004LWZWFQ,"I didn't go see this in theaters because I thought it was simply too soon for a reboot. I really enjoyed the first two Tobey Maguire films, but the third one felt like it pulled every punch in the script. I wasn't even planning on seeing this one, but I liked Andrew Garfield in The Social Network, so when my wife wanted to see it (she's a big fan of Emma Stone), I thought, eh, whatever.  But I loved it. Maybe it was the fact that my expectations were so low, but I found myself getting more and more invested as the movie went on--it kept surpassing what I thought I would get.

The whole treatment of how Parker discovers his powers is more organic--the wrestling stuff in the first trilogy (and a guy stealing money from a wrestling competition) seemed super cheesy, and this version's handling of the vengeance issue was much more realistic.

The relationship between Parker and Gwen Stacy blows Maguire and Kirsten Dunst completely out of the water. For that matter, Dunst was the weakest part of the previous trilogy for me--and part of that is that Mary Jane was written as your classic moronic damsel in distress. Zero personality. Gwen Stacy could show her a thing or two--she's smart, charming, pretty and brave, and the sweet, teenager-awkward flirtations between her and Andrew Garfield are filled with chemistry and humor.

Even though the running time is long, it never felt that way, and my wife and I both felt like we wanted more when it ended. The whole thing was laced with humor, warmth, and very well-done action scenes (way better than the first trilogy). I was very happy to see Spiderman strike the poses he would in the comics while flying through the air. Lent a sense of nostalgia and sincerity to this version. Also, the best Stan Lee cameo ever!

Some people think that the prior trilogy was fine enough and so they lambaste this new incarnation. Don't fall into that trap, please. As fans, everyone should know that there are many, many Spider-Man tales. Spider-Man Noir, Spider-Man 2099, Ultimate Spider-Man. Should I go on? This isn't an attempt to ignore the fun of the previous films. Instead, they are just using the opportunity to highlight different aspects of the characters, and the stories.

Case in point - the most hotly debated item of the ""mystery"" of Peter Parker's family. Yeah, in the theatre it seemed a mis-step. But in the commentary (see, I bought the BD and watched it prior to the review. End rant) they actually come out and say certain plot points were meant to be fully addressed in a future film. Knowing this, I actually enjoyed the film much more through the second viewing.

And speaking of the commentary, we actually get a few great nuggets of the thoughts behind the movie, the casting (apparently Emma Stone and Denis Leary were cast due to physical appearances, or at least it is joked about), the costuming, everything. And none of it is double-tapped in the extensive battery of behind-the-scenes on Disc Two. Remember when Special Editions of DVD had the second disc for all the extra material? Well, this BD release is a step back into that direction. We've got a tonne of treats on that 2nd BD, including like 18 different language tracks. Talk about your global audiences.

4422999,2,B004LWZWFQ,"Throughout the movie, I found it hard to connect emotionally with the main character (Andrew Garfield).  I thought he was a good actor but badly miscast in this role.
You need someone who is more of a leading-man type character, someone that people identify more easily with. He just seemed like a geeky, funny looking guy, but not in a good way.

In comparison, I thought Tobey Maguire nailed it in Spider-Man 1 and 2.  In those 2 movies, I felt like I *was* Spider-man during the movie.  With this Garfield version, because
of the lack of emotional connection, frankly I didn't care a whole lot what happened to the main character, so it it really killed any sense of suspense or excitement during the movie.

Storyline was ok, but again I thought the Tobey Maguire Spider-man movie #1 was far superior in the way that it showed Spider-man coming into being.

With the entire movie, it seemed like a fairly distant, dispassionate, disconnected treatment of Spider-man. And on this level, I thought it was an epic fail. If I had been the producer of this movie, I would have fired the director after screening the movie (although it looks like it did fairly well at the box office).

On a positive note, the special effects were pretty cool and well done.",1352505600,4,1256,4.63063063063063

I guess I'm just so used to Tobey Maguire in the Peter Parker role that I just couldn't get used to the new actor. Kind of like Christopher Reeves as Superman, anyone else after him just doesn't seem right. Same with Harry Potter or James Bond. The first actor makes the role their own and anyone else in the role just seems to be a stand in. I understand that there's nothing they could do about that, but as someone watching the movie, I couldn't help but be aware of it through out.

4423035,5,B004LWZWFQ,"I want to start this review off by talking about the 3D in this movie since I really couldn't find any reviews on here that talked about it. First off the 3D is great, the only problem is there is not that much of it. The scenes that take place indoors are really flat, and so are some of the outdoor scenes. The scenes where Spider-Man is swinging or shooting his webs are where the 3D is, especially the first person pov! Since this movie is over 2 hours long, those few scenes, even though they are great, just are not worth it.

  Now onto the 2D version! This is a awesome looking movie. I don't understand all the complaining about the cgi, I think it looks great, especially the Lizard, the detail to him was spectacular, and so is Spider-Mans suit.

  I enjoyed this Spider-Man more than the previous 3 movies, and I think others would to if they just stop comparing this to the other ones, and let it be its own movie. It had some comedy, some great action scenes, and the actors were great.  I think Andrew is a hell of alot better as Spider-Man than Tobey was. His range of emotions were great, and totally believable! Emma Stone was great as usual and did a terrific job of playing Gwen! Same with Rhus as Dr. Conner/The Lizard. I also enjoyed Martin Sheen as Uncle Ben was really cool, even though his screen time was very limited. Last but not least is Sally Field as Aunt May! Sally just comes off as genuine loving and caring Aunt May, and she does such a terrific job.

  So in conclusion, I just have to say that my family and I really enjoyed watching this movie, and surprisingly at the end of it none of us wanted it to end (not even my wife who hated the other Spider-Man movies), which was surprising since this movie runs over 2 hours. We are all looking forward to the next installment. Check this one out, I hope you and your family enjoy this movie as much as my family and I did!",1352419200,8,1907,4.257617728531856
4423036,1,B004LWZWFQ,"Ridiculous to see two people (Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone) who look like their biological age could be 30+ to act like they are 17. And even worse is the sometimes ridiculous acting by Garfield as a shy/nerdy/stuttering geek and sometimes as a bold man of action (or something to that direction). Just too ridiculous. Besides that this follows the original comic book story overall much less than Spiderman 1 (with the exception that here Spidey builds his own webslingers, just like in the comic book, instead of getting them as part of his metamorphosis).

Another issue is that the villain and the threat in this comedy mostly resembled those fit DC Comics superhero movies (e.g. where Batman battles The Penguin and similar truly believable eh inventions). At least in the Raimi movies Spiderman typically had multiple serious issues to deal with simultaneously, not just one. Most other objections have already been brought up by others so I will stop my rant here.",1352419200,10,973,4.969325153374233

I enjoyed the previous versions, well, at least the first one, but after just viewing this one, I think I now like it best.  I thought Toby was great but this new kid has a different take on the character and although I am 46 yrs old, I think the youthful vibe is a welcome change.  Also, when I first saw Andrew Garfield's skinny frame, I was skeptical of his ability to fill the suit.  But I must say, Mr. Garfield's lankiness looks great in the suit, even better than McGuire.  In the comic books, Peter Parker is a teenage kid in the beginning.  This cast is a perfect fit with that storyline.  Some reviewers complain about the appearance of the Lizard saying he was too humanlike.  I understand their dismay but I was satisfied with his look.  He was, after all, a lizard/human hybrid.  And too, there were some unbelievable circumstances in this movie, but hey, it's part of the fun.  Roll with it, check your skepticism at the door and enjoy the ride.

Special effects. Come on guys, it's 2012, not 1998. These were bad, real bad. I've seen more realistic scenes in video games, not to mention the last 3 Spider-man movies that started almost a decade ago.

4423043,5,B004LWZWFQ,"I honestly don't know that a reboot to this movie license was necessary at this point in time, but we got it anyway. thankfully, this new version of Spider-Man is just as good (or even better, as I see it) as Sam Raimi's version was. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone make for some fairly believable high school students, if a bit too witty at times. Spider-Man's new costume looks great, and I am so glad that we no longer have to look at those silly ""organic"" web-shooters that Peter Parker (Toby Maguire) had in the Sam Raimi trilogy. Instead, we get to see kid-genius Peter Parker develop his own version of the web-shooters and learn to use them as a spider would. Great stuff!

Rhys Ifans does a great job as scientist Doc Conners and villain The Lizard. The Lizard is more believable and more scary than any of the Spidey villains in the previous movies, and the action scenes that focused on this characters were, likewise, better than the action scenes featured in the other Spider-Man films.

I saw this movie in the theater with my 11-year old son, and we both really enjoyed it. I knew right then that it would be a movie I would want to purchase on video, and I think you would too!",1352419200,4,1192,4.438356164383562
4423044,3,B004LWZWFQ,"Any director taking on an iconic superhero has to walk a tightrope between slavish (boring) adherence to the character's traditions; and 're-imagining' the figure to excess, until it is either (1)a parody of itself (2)unrecognizable (3)something only the director's mother would love.

Unfortunately, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" ends up with a little of all 3 issues, in addition to a very weak script, (poor) video-game quality effects and the conversion of a legacy villain from classic to generic.

First-off, the effects (which are a decade advanced from what Sam Raimi had to work with) are jumpy and clearly digital; with none of the organic feeling that you get watching the legendary 'El' battle between Spidey and Doc Ock in 'Spider-Man II'.

On the plus-side, Andrew Garfield's interpretation of Peter Parker hits a lot of grace notes, early on. He captures the paradox of a smart kid with courage, who is also an intensely private and wounded individual. As such, he is definitely more of a 'today' high school student than Toby McGuire's interpretation. Sadly, once he turns into Spidey, his performance becomes more and more quirky, until it approaches self-parody.

Emma Stone as Stacy, is luminous...and, is a very talented actress. Incredibly, despite this being a comic-book character with decades of history, the role is written with barely one-dimension; and the chemistry between the leads is so lacking that I still have trouble believing they are dating in real-life. It is never explained how she is simultaneously a mentor in high school (to vile...yet easily rehabilitated...bully Flash), a top student at the same school, the assistant of Dr. Curt Connors/The Lizard and still gets to spend a lot of time at home with her family. By the way, her dad is a NYC cop, who can afford an apartment comparable to Lois Lane's in the first 'Superman' movie. Internal Affairs will be investigating.

Rhys Ifans brings a very British, almost Victorian and definitely plummy reading to the role of Dr. Curt Connors/The Lizard. His hooded glances, sotto voce remarks and grandeloquent statements are jarring in a modern, NYC setting. Worse, once in CGI 'costume' as The Lizard, he lets all restraint lose and bellows the bad lines that were written for him (possibly because they were so painful for a noted actor to read?). In the comics, Dr. Curt Connors was a loving family man and mentor to Peter Parker; who became a monster while trying to do scientific good. This duality created the frisson underlying the Spider-Man/Lizard conflict. In this movie, The Lizard has been so stripped of any back story and personality, that he reminds one of nothing so much as a rejected character from 'Galaxy Quest'.

Dennis Leary, as Stone's cop-father does the best that he can with (yet another) under-written part. It starts promisingly with the stereo dislike he develops for 'vigilante' Spider-Man, and his daughter's mouthy new boyfriend...Peter Parker. But it doesn't go any further; and, in the end, he's just another example of the screenwriters' lack of talent for developing characters you can either care for, or happily 'boo'.

To be fair to the screenwriters, director Marc Webb bears most of the responsibility for this underachievement. His talent for teen-bizarro behavior is evident in his earlier '500 Days Of Summer'; but, he is not a director of action flicks. Aside from the Halo-grade CGI, the pacing and staging of his Spidey/Lizard battles have no drama, no peril...and, therefore, no visceral excitement.

This reboot is much better than Sam Raimi's 'Spider-Man III'; but, that is faint praise, indeed. whether considered as a filmed narrative, comic-book movie, or the visualization of a myth, it is...at best...mediocre. Stick with the excellent Raimi 'Spider-Man' and superb 'Spider-Man II' if you need a fix of your friendly neighborhood webslinger.

That's it...I'm off the bloody soapbox.

4423085,2,B004LWZWFQ,"I actually didn't even pay to see this movie. It happened to, by chance, be playing on an airplane I was flying on, so I said, ""What the heck,"" and paid the 2 bucks for the headphones to see what this relaunch movie was all about.

The main thing we gotta ask ourselves when watching a movie like this is, ""What is the purpose for its existence?"" In other words, why did they decide to do a relaunch of this movie, especially so soon after the Raimi movies? After trudging through most of this movie on that long airplane ride, the only answer I could come up with was, ""No idea!""

Though one would think that the ideal purpose of doing a relaunch would be to improve upon some mistakes made in the prior versions. However, this movie failed to do this.

For example, one mistake the Raimi movies made was its reducing Flash Thompson to little significance. He was only there to get the ball rolling on Peter Parker's super hero career by playing Mr Bully. After that, we see Flash Thompson no more! In this movie the situation is no different. Flash is there for a few scenes and then ~puff~ gone! No improvement on that end. (Don't know why these filmmakers dislike Flash Thompson so much, considering he IS actually a very significant character in the comic books!)

Another mistake the Raimi films made was similar to the above--a very minimally heeded character that was much more significant in past Spider-Man lore--namely, Jonah Jameson. Sure, at least he appeared in all 3 Raimi films, but his character mostly lingered in the background with little significance in Spider-Man's thoughts & motives. He was mainly there for comedy relief purposes, and to demonstrate what a cool character Spider-Man was in comparison. In THIS version of the movie, Jameson does not even appear at all! Unless you want to consider Captain Stacy a sort of surrogate Jameson. In fact the only indication of the existence of the Daily Bugle at all, is the brief appearance of the newspaper for a few seconds of the film.

Then we can look at Aunt May. Though the idea to use Sally Field to play her was interesting, and probably an improvement on Raimi's idea, what good did that do since her appearance was so minimal?

Martin Sheen is too aggressive-toned an actor for Uncle Ben.

And while I know that it's not easy to find an actor who's as good looking as the Peter Parker in the comics and cartoons, where did they get the idea to use an actor with an Afro for the role of Peter Parker? Did they think the Afro would improve his appearance, make him better looking than he is?

Overall, this version of Spider-Man is too dark-themed to really feel like Spider-Man at all. It plays out more like a movie about a guy who lives in a world where Spider-Man already is a fictional character, who happens to acquire the same powers as the fictional character, and simply takes on the identity of Spider-Man because he can't think of any better identity to use.

About 20 to 30 minutes before the film ended, I took the headphones off and got tired of watching it. It just got too boring and redundant.

Though this movie might probably be fun to watch once as a rental, it's hardly worth buying at all! Even if rented, one may get tired of watching it after a while, due to this movie's lack of really feeling in any way like Spider-Man.",1352419200,6,3325,4.526666666666666

Had I paid to see this in the theater, I would have gotten my money back within the first 40 minutes.

Amazing spidey apes Dark Knights hide and seek intro right off the bat, devolves into ""parker boy detective"" who forgets about justice for Ben, The self centered bastid, and goes after doc conners who might help cure him, or help him to not die.

Like all superhero movies, spidey must have some action on a bridge, just like spidey 1, FF, X-men etc...
this movie has no originality at all, the scenes are watered down versions of what has gone before in the Raimi movies. Every character is a cardboard cut out placed in the wrong light, the lizard is just a compromise of goblin and doc oc.
Just lame... earlier parker throws a football 70 yards and it bends the goal posts, but later when he throws his shoe at the lizard from about 20 feet the shoe bounces off as though a 3-4 year old child threw it, having absolutely no effect on the lizard.
And like all superhero movies, the characters rather than having their own lives, are all subservient to some giant corporation, like oscorp or doom corp or weyland enterprises etc...
Giant corporations are the evil of the day, hey just throw on your spidey mask on some stupid little kid and save the day. In the comic he designs his own web formula, in this he steals it and makes web shooters from an old watch to use it for his own purposes.

I got sick of it and had to shut it off before the big climax or whatever happens at the end. I tracked down my cat for some real fun, 10 minutes of quality stick with string and toy time made me laugh and gasp several times. Needless to say, that cat provided much more enjoyment than that free redbox rental.

I may be back with a review of the end of the movie if I get around to it, but really why should I bother?

Well I bothered, prior to fast forwarding through the predictably pedestrian ""finale"", I guessed the rest, that Gwens dad would die, peter would save the day and would tell gwen he can't hang out with her, ala spider-man 1 end with MJ. And the typically annoying post end credit sequel set up scenes.

Now I have heard that people complaint that the movie was made too soon after the previous 3 movies.  I read somewhere that Sony and Fox (Spiderman, X Men, FF) have the rights to make the movies but they have to release them often otherwise the rights revert back to Marvel (now Disney).

Now as far as the villain goes, I did not care about the form of the Lizard (but my kid was not scared so I will let that one go).  But what I did not liked was that they did not show that Dr. Connors had a wife and a son which they play a big part on the comic books.

He has also forgotten that he is more than his brain.  In the end, in the nick of time, an antidote is found and he reclaims his humanity.

For its entertainment value, I also think this is the best Spiderman movie made to date.  The Peter character was very humourous and his relationship with Gwen made for a very nice partnership/romance.  Since we are ""wired for story,"" I found this line from the movie fitting, ""I had a professor once who liked to tell his students that there are only ten different plots in all of fiction.  Well, I'm here to tell you that he was wrong.  There's only one.""  The answer offered is a classic paradox, something seemingly very simple yet very difficult at the same time.

4423090,4,B004LWZWFQ,"If you don't know the story of Spider-man, then you missed the first three Sam Raimi films, the 90's television show, and countless other adaptations of the classic comic book.  Teenage Peter Parker gets bitten by a radioactive spider.  Hijinks ensue.  THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN is another (too soon) attempt to reboot the legend, this time with Andrew Garfield (THE SOCIAL NETWORK) slipping into the suit.  He's still an outcast (the idea that Garfield, who radiates cool, wouldn't be popular is just laughable), and still infatuated with a girl a little beyond his means (Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy).  As Parker gets used to his new powers and abilities, he's pursued by Gwen's father (Dennis Leary), who just happens to be a cop.  Oh, and there's something about a former coworker of Peter's father, who accidentally transforms himself into a murderous lizard and goes on random killing sprees that have little point to them, but certainly look great.

Sense my skepticism?  There's a lot to dislike here.  Garfield is a superb actor, he's proven that before, and he's good here; the problem is, he's not Peter Parker.  The character HAS been updated a bit (he's not the total geek that Tobey Maguire's portrayal was, for example), but just not enough.  Garfield and Stone (real life sweeties) have great screen chemistry, and Leary brings a nice edge, like always.  As the doctor/lizard, Rhys Ifans is solid, though like Alfred Molina in Raimi's second film, he just doesn't have much to do (the Lizard and Doc Oc, at least on-screen, share a lot of similarities, one of which is fantastic actors cast in promising roles, but then chained down by script issues).  Also enjoyable are Martin Sheen and Sally Field as Uncle Ben and Aunt May; and look for a (per usual) hilarious cameo from Spidey creator Stan Lee.

The script has so many holes that the characters are bound to trip up.  The subplot about Peter's father (arguably more interesting than anything else here) is basically forgotten (don't worry, it'll show up in the sequel, the film's ending makes sure of that); and the Lizard goes on several rampages, chasing after Spidey when he could just as easily be going about his plot of bringing New York to its knees.  Marc Webb's direction is solid, though, and the film looks--and more importantly, feels--amazing.  I'm harping on it simply because, while there's a lot to dislike, there's also a lot to love.  It could have been much better.  Still.  Fanboys should be pleased, and if you like a good superhero popcorn flick, THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN delivers in spades.",1352332800,3,2577,4.880459770114943

4423092,3,B004LWZWFQ,"Let me get this out of the way first: as a film, The Amazing Spider-Man is not on the same level of any of the films in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy; not even the much-maligned Spider-Man 3, which was released a scant five years ago.  Love them or hate them, Raimi's takes on everybody's favorite wallcrawler were heartfelt, quirky and idiosyncratic, a sensibility that meshed well with Marvel's quirkiest and most idiosyncratic superhero.  Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker wore his heart on his sleeve.  He was sensitive--maybe a little too sensitive, actually; he seemed to sling more tears than he did webs. But his performance was emblematic of the original Spider-Man trilogy as a whole: it had heart, to a fault.

Like many others, I was not exactly enthusiastic about a reboot of Spider-Man so quickly after the first series ended.  (Although I was less than thrilled with Spider-Man 3, I was willing to cut Raimi and company some slack, as the corporate-mandated shoehorning of Venom into the plot threw off the balance of the entire movie.)  It just smacked of a cash grab and a well-publicized desperate move on Sony's part to stop the Spider-Man license from reverting to Marvel.  Compound that with the fact that it was stuffed in the summer between two bigger, better and more anticipated superhero films, The Avengers and The Dark Knight Rises, and this new Spider-Man was an easy miss for me.  When I finally did get an opportunity to see the new version, I learned that I was both right and wrong in dismissing The Amazing Spider-Man.  I was struck by two things: one, the cynical, blatant marketing calculation that went into constructing the story; two, how the character of Peter Parker/Spider-Man was portrayed.

On the story: The Amazing Spider-Man is a summer blockbuster that is trying very hard to be THE Summer Blockbuster.  No clich is left unused, no demographic left unappealed to in Sony's bid for box office dollars.  The villain in this piece, The Lizard (played without much depth by Rhys Ifans) is just big and scary enough to be a credible threat to our hero, but just bland and nondescript enough that parents won't leave the younger kids at home in favor of the preteens; after all, if they take away that demo, how will they sell the kids toys?  (For contrast, read the early issues of Todd MacFarlane's ""Spider-Man"" from 1991 to know what a terrifying character the Lizard can truly be.)  It also continues the trend of schmaltz in the Spider-Man cinematic universe, encapsulated here by the crane scene (no spoilers, when you see the film you will know what I'm referring to).  But the heightened sentimentality that felt earned in the Raimi trilogy--especially in the first film, which was released mere months after 9/11--only feels mawkish and insincere here.  Also, the Amazing Spider-Man, even more so than the Raimi trilogy, plays fast and loose with established continuity.  After a dozen years or so of big-budget Marvel comics adaptations, I fully recognize the fact that film is a different medium, and what works in the comics often will not work on the screens, and filmmakers have to have the freedom to adapt the material as they see fit, and so on and so forth.  But aside from the (re)telling of the origin story, the plot points in The Amazing Spider-Man are so jumbled as to smack of disrespect for the source material.

In the middle of this mess of a movie stands the main reason why TASM is worth watching: the characters of Peter Parker/Spider-Man, Gwen Stacy, and Peter's Uncle Ben and Aunt May.  Whatever flaws the film itself has, I can say unreservedly that this is the first time I've ever felt truly satisfied with the portrayal of Spider-Man onscreen.  First of all, Andrew Garfield, unlike Tobey Maguire, physically looks like the Peter Parker of the comics.  This Peter Parker still has a big heart, but he is tougher (without being tough); he's gangly, gawky, and yet lithe and muscular enough that you could believe he could be a total science nerd or a buff superhero.  And speaking of the superheroics, the Raimi trilogy was never particularly convincing on that score; for all the CGI effects and for all the TALK of what Spider-Man could do, when the action was live, it didn't feel like Spider-Man.  It felt like an above-average athlete wearing a suit; watching Spider-Man move is supposed to feel, well, amazing!  Here, the webslinger in action moves like an arachnid on speed and wisecracks like nobody's business.  Yes, folks, this Spider-Man is actually funny, rectifying what I considered to be the cardinal sin of the previous three movies.

The character of Gwen Stacy also fares well in comparison with Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane Watson.  As played by Emma Stone, Gwen is spunky, very cute, and more than an intellectual match for Peter, where Dunst's Mary Jane was often more closed off and sometimes unsure of their relationship.  The chemistry between real-life couple Garfield and Stone is fun, spark-filled and very lively, yet shares the same basic sweetness with the more old-fashioned, almost courtly romance of Peter & Mary Jane from the Raimi films.  Martin Sheen and Sally Field also bring an earthiness and sense of humor to Uncle Ben and Aunt May that the impossibly moral figures of the Raimi films lacked.  Sheen, in particular, turns Uncle Ben from the near-saintly figure comic fans have heard about for fifty years now (!!I'm old!!) into a very human guy from Queens who still has a real moral authority, but is also prone to being short-tempered and a bit sarcastic.  Sally Field doesn't make quite the same impression (mainly because, I assume, the character will be explored a bit more in the inevitable sequels), but she too manages bring out the more relatable aspects of May's character.

Taken on its own merits, The Amazing Spider-Man is perhaps the first of what will soon become a very weird niche in films, should Hollywood continue the way it's going: a reboot worse than the original, but with a better cast.  It's odd to think about.  Sam Raimi's trilogy was a superior series of films that captured the heart and the feel of the Spider-Man universe, but not the complete essence of the main character.  This new film (soon to be series) finally nails the character of Spider-Man himself, but manages to make the world around him feel false and contrived.  Maybe one day we will get a perfect meshing of character and universe onscreen, but for now, this still isn't it.",1352332800,4,6485,4.841485507246377

He also first fell in love with Gwen Stacy not M.J. which this version also takes care of.

4423127,1,B004LWZWFQ,"After watching the horrendous, poorly paced, disjointed mess that was the amazing Spiderman, it pretty much reinforced my initial assessment that Raimi's films are far superior than this very unnecessary reboot. For those who actually think that Andrew Garfield is a better Peter Parker than Toby McGuire, you better reread the original spiderman comic series; not the modern revamped photoshopped version, but the original Stan Lee/ Steve Ditko version! Peter Parker is a simple, innocent, nerdy, boring teenager trying to fit it, with his only vice is being one very smart bookworm. He's a bit of a Mama's boy. He isn't cute, nervous and quirky jerky like Garfield and doesn't ride a cool skateboard, nor does he flirt with the ladies with ease. Everything he does is a struggle, and just when he thinks things are going his way for once, shit happens. Garfield's version is the antithesis of what Peter Parker should be. On the other hand, Tobey's version, although not perfect, best captures the spirit of Peter Parker, who is wide eyed, innocent, smart and empathetic. There is more feeling, emotion and empathy in the opening school bus scene in spider man 1 than in the entire amazing spiderman movie. Overall, the new Spiderman movie is so disjointed and poorly written that you might as well string a bunch of YouTube clips and call that a movie. The director was obviously aiming for the Twilight crowd, as he created a cool, emo Peter Parker that is just frumpy and too cocky for his own good. Lots of plot holes and implausibilities that would give Prometheus a run for its money. In the day and age of modern prosthetics, why would the Lizard labor over regrowing a new arm? The direction by Marc Webb is simply piss poor; does he suffer from ADD, as the movie is choppy and uneven all throughout? Webb has no sense of sound sequential pacing and it shows. The scene showing how Peter Parker actually transformed into Spiderman is laughably bad and lacks even the smallest iota of plausibility. Sorry, Sally Field is not Aunt May and why did they get Martin Sheen as uncle Ben? Both were pedestrian at best. Worst of all, the business with Peter Parker's parents was as bad as Qui Gon explaining the force in midichlorian terms. I equate this reboot to the Superman reboot where it was unneeded and totally forgettable.

4423130,5,B004LWZWFQ,"I read a lot of reviews for this movie before watching it myself. In the end, they all boiled down to a few basic criticisms, which I kept in mind as I made my own appraisal. Here are the major problems people seem to have had with Marc Webb's ""Amazing Spider-Man"", along with my responses.

1. The reboot was too soon.

This more or less depends on your point of view. True, the last Spidey movie was in 2007, a mere five years ago - more than long enough to warrant another Spider-Man film; not exactly long enough to call for a complete reboot. On the other hand, I think a lot of people would agree that it's been more like eight years since the last GOOD Spider-Man film. I loved Raimi's work with the character, though I do criticize him on some minor points. But in the end, he really dropped the ball with Spider-Man 3, running a lot of good characters into the ground and painting himself into a corner with two hours of very messy plotting. In the end, whether a reboot was necessary per se is a matter of personal preference. But even if you think it wasn't necessary, is it fair to write off the new movie completely as a result? I don't believe it is.

2. We've heard it all before.

Yes and no. This is another interpretation of Spider-Man's origin story. But it's very different from Raimi's first Spider-Man film. More importantly, it's a well-done interpretation. At the heart of this ""origin story"" is Peter Parker's development from a somewhat geeky, trouble-making teen into a true hero. This transition happened far more quickly in Raimi's first movie, mainly because Maguire's Peter had a more strongly-developed moral compass to begin with. Neither version is objectively inferior in my opinion, but I do have a personal preference for the deep character drama achieved by Webb. The point is, yes, this is the spider-bite story again, but it's a good spider-bite story.

3. The hype about ""secrets being revealed"" was a big lie.

Yes, it was. This is most definitely not ""the untold story"". Significant-sounding lines from the trailers such as ""Do you think what happened to you was an accident?"" and ""If you want the truth about your parents, Peter, then come and get it"" didn't even feature, which I'll admit kind of annoyed me. That amounts to false advertising in my opinion. I was very happy with what I got, but it wasn't what I was promised. The thing is, there is some big mystery going on in this movie with Peter's parents. However, their story doesn't feature very heavily in this first movie. The elements of it that do were given away in the trailers. So don't bother watching this solely to find out more about Richard and Mary Parker. Their story will have to wait until the sequel.

4. The villain was weak.

My main problem with this film's take on Dr. Curtis Connors was that it diverged so heavily from the comics. The Connors I remember was an intriguing villain because he was a father and a husband who transformed himself into a monster in a quest for healing. Billy Connors and his mom aren't around here. Instead there's a bachelor, British-accented Connors who frequently runs the risk of going boldly where so many villains have gone before. Fortunately, Rhys Ifans' performance is good enough to prevent this happening most of the time. Connors' motivation makes sense overall, though little time is given to truly flesh it out. Perhaps if his mysterious connections to Norman Osborn had been explored in greater detail, he would have been more memorable.

5. The Lizard's design was flawed.

Most people who didn't care for the Lizard's look seem to describe it as ""too human"". The face certainly is. It wasn't really that scary. I've seen alternate designs which the production team ultimately abandoned which I think would have been a lot better. So basically I would agree with this criticism, but for me it was a minor quibble.

6. It had too much teenage angst and Twilight-esque drama.

Actually, it had none. The teenage interactions were more mature than I'm used to seeing in film or TV, with even Flash Thompson evolving from a typical bully into a likable character over time. There are a few moments of stereotypical rebellion from Peter, but they lead rapidly into the tragic events that change him, so they're quickly forgotten. Despite the early publicity saying that this movie would be ""darker"", I don't think I'd describe it that way. It's a little less cheesy and a little more gritty in parts, but there are enough moments of clever humor to give the viewer a break from the gradually building tension.

The Amazing Spider-Man does have flaws. But in my opinion, its good points are so good that they cancel out the missteps. Andrew Garfield brings the wisecracking, geeky, sometimes mischievous Peter Parker from the original comics to life better than anyone I've seen (or heard, in animation) thus far. He nails the sense of humor that was frequently lacking from Maguire's Spidey. I had my doubts about Emma Stone as Gwen, but her acting was superb as well. She and Garfield have great chemistry on screen, which bodes well for the future. Really all the main cast was terrific, but I must make a special mention of Dennis Leary's Captain Stacy. He truly did a fantastic job. The special effects in regard to Spider-Man's web-slinging and other stunts were breathtaking, and clever cinematography draws the audience into the action effortlessly. The music was forgettable for the most part, but served its purpose in the more dramatic scenes (much like the soundtrack to The Avengers).

In short, watching this movie was a delight for me as a long-time Spider-Fan, even with the memory of Raimi's better efforts fresh in my mind, and I'm very much looking forward to the sequel (teased at the end of this movie by an intriguing mid-credits scene). Worth buying, worth watching, and worth re-watching. It's a fun, engaging superhero film, and deserves to be judged on its own merits, which are considerable. Please don't let the unfair amount of negativity surrounding this movie scare you away from it. If you give it a chance, you won't be sorry.",1352073600,491,6123,4.742481203007519

Superman - give or take. Spiderman? Not really. The previous trilogy was fine.  While all that may be true, I've got to say - this was one fantastic movie. It reminded me of the cartoons I used to watch as a kid and the comics I read for decades. Finally - spidey has the web slingers and a home-made costume.  If you were a fan of the original spider then you'll really appreciate the movie's take on this. It's obvious the director is a fan of the comics. We even have the iconic scenes of spidey web-slinging under the raised commuter tracks, helicopters and crane towers.

My only complaints - Martin Sheen as uncle Ben? Terrible casting. Sally Field as aunt May? Bleeech.

Denis Leary as police captain Stacy was perfectly cast, and he played the part to perfection. His over-the-top wise cracking norm was in restraint. Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy was well done, although I had a hard time believing she was 17. Andrew Garfield as spidey was also impressive. I've only seen him in ""The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus"" so had no idea what to expect. He really was a great web-slinger.

I was never really a big fan of the Sam Raimi ""Spider-Man"" movies. To me they were too cheesy. I was looking forward to this one because it seemed darker then those. While this did feel more grown up it was still nothing like I was expecting. I think my big problem with it is that it was so much like the other series that the movie didn't feel like it was needed at all. This isn't a fair comparison but the Chris Nolan ""Batman"" series was much, much different from the Tim Burton series that the re-boot felt fresh and original. This one just felt like...hey let's do ""Spider-Man"" again...OK. This may just be my opinion but there is nothing new and fresh in this movie compared to the others and to me that seems like a waste of a movie. This again though is a movie that people will watch regardless of any review written, but just so you don't get your hopes up don't really expect anything different or amazing.

4423156,1,B004LWZWFQ,"Spider-Man 1 and 2 from Sam Raimi were great movies, and at the time easily among the best superhero movies to date while still holding up today. After a disappointing third act Sony decided to go the reboot route far sooner than it needed to be done. The result, an amazing hack job of last minute editing leaving multiple plot lines unresolved or never truly used. Scenes from trailers as late as a couple months before release don't even show up in the film. One character in particular simply disappears from the story due to all his later scenes being cut from the film. The Uncle Ben story is not only unresolved, but no character growth comes from it, completely botching an integral part of the Spider-Man origin story. The climax of the film teases an interesting concept for its finale that literally goes nowhere. We get a Peter Parker who is no longer the nerd we know but now a post-Twilight emo outcast in a movie trying its hardest to be edgy and realistic Batman Begins style take on Spider-Man, which was never going to work with this character and completely loses the tone a Spider-Man movie should be going for, which Raimi nailed with his first two films.

The spiderman film of 2002 was quite good. The acting was good and Tobey MacGuire was a believable character. This spiderman was trying to be serious and comical at the same time. The bad guy was worse than 1-dimensional -- the bad guy had no real dimensions to discern.

4423175,3,B004LWZWFQ,"Other than the desire to hear the ka-ching from box office receipts and Blu-ray sales, I'm not quite sure why this movie was made. Every time the actor playing a superhero changes, there needs to be a brand new movie that reboots the superhero's origins? I don't see the point, but it's okay with Marvel, and Marvel will likely approve any script that might make money. Why bother with maintaining a single origin story? Maybe in the next series of Spiderman movies, Peter Parker will be infected by nanobot spiders or bitten by a spider from Neptune. As long as people will pay to see the movie, Marvel will think it's dandy.

Why not just take it as a given that we all know Spiderman's origin and do something to move the character forward instead of starting fresh? Particularly when the fresh start is as bland as this one. The story is mundane and too often cheesy. It felt like the writers needed to get this out of the way so they could move onto something more interesting. I hope they manage to cobble together a story worth filming before Andrew Garfield gets too old for the part (or too fat to fit into the tights).

Since the story isn't worth telling (or retelling), the movie's only value lies in the action scenes. The early action sequences are filled with jump cuts. I know that's trendy, but in this case, it's also lazy. Continuous action creates a sense of realism but it's much harder to film. Stringing together bits and pieces of action and calling it ""edgy"" is a poor substitute for filming an action scene that looks like it's actually happening. Fortunately there was less of that as the movie went on, and mercifully little of the super-slow-mo that's also become unbearably trendy. In most other respects the special effects are entertaining -- as they should be in a superhero movie -- although the lizard villain looks like he was recycled from a bunch of other movies. A sequence involving a bunch of crane operators is difficult to believe (they all managed to get to their cranes and line them all up in a matter of minutes in the middle of the night?) but spectacular to watch -- by far the best part of the film. Let's hear it for the working man -- the movie's true hero.

I don't know about the casting. Ridiculously good looking guys with perfect hair are not awkward around girls. At some points, Garfield plays the part like he's on an extended acid trip. Of course, if you were raised by Sally Fields, you'd be hallucinating too. At other points, Garfield plays the part like he's James Dean ... or James Dean on acid. I think Garfield gave it his best shot but he's just wrong for the part.

I understand it may have been necessary to make a Spiderman move to avoid losing licensing rights, but that doesn't explain why anyone thought it was necessary to make THIS movie, covering well-trod ground. The bottom line is that you could watch this movie with the sound off and not miss much.",1351814400,,2931,4.545454545454546

Garfield portrays Peter amazingly. Even friends of mine who I dragged to the movie theaters (who hate Spiderman/ superhero's) thought it was a very riveting movie and we went multiple time.

4423179,4,B004LWZWFQ,"I loved this movie. I collected the Amazing Spiderman comic books growing up, and I liked the Spiderman trilogy, too but the CGI effects were too obvious for me. In this movie, the continuous switching to first person Spiderman ""I'm swinging through the city!"" camera view was done incredibly, and the ""glamor shots"" of Spiderman in memorable poses from the comic books were also well done. Say what you want about rehashing old story lines, but that's okay with me. I just like a movie that's done well, and this was. I enjoyed it in the theater in 3D, and I loved it on Amazon instant.

I'll admit the beginning starts off too ""campy"" like I was watching smug teenagers on the Twilight saga movies. But once Peter becomes Spiderman, the movie really takes off and is thoroughly entertaining (enough to make me not care about the show-offishness of the first 20 minutes).

I will probably buy the movie in bluray 3D because of the first person swinging parts. I feel the 3D effect really added to this movie and I was able to be Spiderman for a short while. If you're a fan of the original story, you enjoy a movie for it's fun value, and you don't make continual comparisons to other movies, you'll have a great time watching this. It really gives me an authentic Spiderman ""vibe"", especially some of the wise cracks he makes while fighting/interacting. So bottom line, just get this.

4423182,5,B004LWZWFQ,"The following review will lack focus and probably be very short. This Spiderman movie was the best by far. Spiderman always had a level of intellect (in the comics)that was never portrayed in the original movie trilogy. He was an outcast in high school but he wasn't the soft spoken wuss Tobey Mcguire portrayed him to be when the mask wasn't on. The web slinging scenes were far more realistic as well. Too often in the comics and the the original movie trilogy webbing would be slung at some random unknown unseen object that the web-crawler would use to catapult himself. That wasn't the case here. I could go on, but I wont. Andrew Garfield>>>Tobey Magoo",1351555200,4,658,4.681034482758621
4423183,2,B004LWZWFQ,"I'm a fan of comic book movies and take them for what they are.  I've read some spiderman comics in my day as well, and while he's not one of my favorite heros I find some of his storylines fairly good.

And now to this movie.  As for playing Peter Parker,  Andrew Garfield was really really good.  This movie really did the geeky outcast that has a knack for science well.  Parker isn't some sniveling little kid that Peter is sometimes portrayed as.  He has a strong sense of morals and stands up for others using his brains instead of brawn even before he becomes Spiderman.  This is a staple of the Spiderman character in the comics and well portrayed here.

Uncle Ben is played by Martin Sheen.  Martin Sheen was fantastic as well.  He played a smart but down to earth blue collar worker.  I think he did a better job as Uncle Ben than anyone that had ever written or played him in the past.  He has a strong sense of morals that he passes to Peter as well as his ability to naturally play the understanding parent act in a cool somewhat comical way.

Aunt May was supposedly played by Sally Field.  Field was good but I got none of a typical Aunt May vibe off of her.

I'm going to just go into semi-spoilers here and say that The death of Uncle Ben was one of the most underwelming sequences of the movie and to me the part where the movie went from really engaging to what the hell. Before that it was pretty solid minus the one alkwardly edited squence that Peter Parker sneaks into the ""spider room"" and gets bitten. After that the action scenes were a little to cgi for my taste and there wasn't enough money thrown at them.

There were a lot of scenes that seemed to be forced.  There was a serious lack of logical progression and more forced progression.  The romance which started as natural became a little overly gooey and strange Between Peter and Gwen Stacy.  Her Father the Police Guy played by Dennis Leary made for some more alkward scenes because he didn't appove of either Peter or Spiderman.  He was pretty bad ass at the end of the movie and I would consider Leary one of the better parts when the movie went full absurd.

I would recomend watching it if you like Spiderman but only if you plan on being underwelmed.  It really does start out very well.  The acting is good.  The writing is very unbalanced and the plot is pretty much ripped from a goofy comic story.  I was sad to see it go off the rails so much.  So watch it and maybe turn it into a drinking game or something becuse about half way through it got laugh out loud bad (My Girlfriend can tell you, I woke her up, She was not impressed).",1351555200,,2628,4.27789046653144

4423217,5,B004LWZWFQ,"Everyone does it, at one time or another, everyone has their favorite.  We all find ourselves in a conversation arguing who is the best Batman, or who is the best 007. Well now during what might be the absolute best time for a Spider-Man movie Marvel and Columbia Pictures very much obliged.  With advanced computer graphics, and 3D innovations a Spider-Man revamp is just what the doctor ordered.  With a story-line that stays shockingly true to the comic-book series we will have die-hard Spider-Man fans seeing this movie over and over again.  Andrew Garfield plays a more humanized version of our friendly neighborhood Spider-man, in contrast to the nearly invincible Tobey Maguire who never seemed to have as so much as a bruise this Peter Parker takes all sort of punishment and it shows. Hopefully the poor performance in the box office does not deter the studios from making a sequel, I know I am excited to see who they would pick to play the legendary Mary-Jane.  Like any movie, however, there is several things I could have gone without.  First of all has to be the way too shiny/revealing costume. The second would be the villain, although true to the story of the Lizard, he really didn't cause enough damage for a movie-goer to be shocked.  The soundtrack definitely could have used some help from Danny Elfman.  Lastly the amount of product placement was a little overwhelming i.e., Sony, Bing, Hardees. Now to the good stuff.  The plot was spectacular.  This was a wonderful interpretation of the Spider-man legacy and I absolutely cannot wait to see what comes next from director Marc Webb.  Another plus is the definite step-up in the choice of actors. Don't get me wrong Tobey Maguire was a great first try.  However Andrew Garfield stole our hearts in this revamp as with Emma Stone, Martin Sheen, Sally Field, Rhys Ifans. Although this movie was not filmed in 3D it is definitely worth the few extra bucks.

4423220,3,B004LWZWFQ,"I've been a mild fan of Spider-man since the 1970s.  That was when I read the British reprints of the classic 1963-67 Marvel originals.  The Lizard, Doc Octopus, the Kingpin, even The Living Brain all thrilled me when I was a kid.  This movie is a well-made and impeccably acted tribute to those originals, updated to a contemporary setting.  The dialogue, costuming, lighting, FX, sound are all fine.  The music knows its place in the movie, and it generally works well.  The one thing that did annoy me was... the main villain here just doesn't look right.  Ditko's original 1960s comic-book version of him is so memorable. Yet it's not as if the film-makers changed the villain to make him more scary.  Because he isn't that scary.  He's an unconvincing cobbled-together blend of the Hulk, Dragon-man from the Kirby's Fantastic Four, Gozilla, and a guy in a rubber suit.  As a super-villain his visual style simply lacks the all-important Marvel sense of _style_.  But I wonder if that change was deliberate?  The movie probably works really really well for the 12 year-old who is 'new to the whole Spider-man thing'.  If those people are the intended audience, then the film-makers probably didn't want to make the villain too scary - because that would risk all those over-protective moms freaking out and renting _Beverly Hills Chihuahua 3_ instead.  Apart from that fairly heavy central flaw (the other is that Spider-man does Web searches using Bing, and yet is supposed to be intelligent) the first two-thirds of the movie are interesting and generally great fun.  Even the 'luv interest' sections are watchable, mainly for the comedic teenage awkwardness.  But towards the end the movie gets very choppy, and the audience heads into the most predictable of formula finishes. But overall... _Amazing Spider-man_ is nicely made and worth seeing, and is certainly vastly more entertaining than the first reboot.",1350777600,,1918,5.022151898734177

4423245,4,B004LWZWFQ,"Can you reboot a franchise that once held the record for largest opening weekend in history? Can you create something original using a character who was first introduced to the world in 1962?

  Peter Parker, age 4, (played by Max Charles) is playing hide and seek one night when he discovers someone has broken into his father's study. His father, Richard (played by Campbell Scott) sees this and takes some important papers, his wife Mary (played by Embeth Davidtz) and his son to the home of his Aunt May (played by Sally Field) and Uncle Ben (played by Martin Sheen). Peter is left in that home for his own safety and never sees his parents again. At least a decade later, Peter (played as a teenager by Andrew Garfield), is being bullied by an athlete named Flash Thompson (played by Chris Zylka) and has a crush on a student named Gwen Stacey (played by Emma Stone). When Peter returns home at the end of the day, bruised and beaten by Flash, he finds papers in his father's briefcase that show he once worked with a man named Dr. Curt Connors (played by Rhys Ifans). Connors works at a company named Oscorp, so Peter disguises himself as an intern to gain access to the lab and, hopefully, Connors. Little did he know, the tour for new interns was led by Gwen Stacey. She knows immediately that the ID badge that Peter's wearing belongs to someone else, but allows him to continue on the tour regardless. Peter sneaks away from the group and finds a lab filled with genetically-modified spiders that are producing biocable. As is often the case with people who bother animals for no reason, Peter gets bitten. Security eventually finds him and escorts him out of the building. While on the subway, he discovers that he gained far more than knowledge from his visit.

  Now, I saw the 2002 Spider-Man film starring Tobey Maguire and the 2004 sequel. I liked it initially, but over time, I grew tired of it. I thought 2004's Daredevil was a much better film, despite mixed reviews from moviegoers and critics. Not to mention, I believe Kirsten Dunst gave a less-than-stellar performance as Parker's love interest, Mary Jane Watson. Not to mention the irony of having blonde Kirsten Dunst dye her hair red to play Mary Jane Watson and then having redhead Emma Stone dye her hair blonde to play Gwen Stacey. Forgetting all that for a second, this was a much better film than the one we got from Sam Raimi. Director Marc Webb and company have created something with a much darker, more serious tone, a better story, and a solid conclusion.

4423254,4,B004LWZWFQ,"Lets get something straight, you don't HAVE to choose which take on Spiderman you prefer. Know one says you can't like The Amazing Spiderman if you liked Raimis' trilogy. You can have BOTH. You don't HAVE to choose. Also, some people are saying ""THIS is the TRUE take on Spiderman"" or ""Sam Raimis Spiderman was the REAL Spiderman"" this is FALSE. One thing I love about the Spiderman character is that there are multiple takes you can spin on the character. Raimis' Spiderman trilogy was the more classic 60s cheasy Spiderman, while this movie is a little more modern for a take on Spiderman. There is no ""true"" take on the character, see? Personally (as a big Spiderman fan), I actually ended up enjoying this movie and the old trilogy EQUALLY.

Now That THAT'S out of the way, The Amazing Spiderman pretty much started production once Spiderman 4 was cancelled. I was really looking forward to Spiderman 4 at the time, and when they decided to reboot the series, I was pretty ticked off. Don't get me wrong, if they had just made Spiderman 4 to give that series a conclusion, I would have been perfectly fine with a reboot. To me, a reboot just didn't seem necessary. In my opinion, the only purpose in rebooting a franchise is if the series had a strong ending, or if the latest entry was so terrible that it would be time to try something new. Looking back, Spiderman 3 did have a good ending to that trilogy overall, but this reboot still came out WAY to soon. 5 years, really? WAY to soon.

Once the first trailer and marketing began for The Amazing Spiderman, I decided to finally accept that the trilogy is done, and this reboot is really happening. Now, after seeing the film, it's very good, and does a great job at separating itself from Raimi's trilogy. However, there is ALOT of hit and miss with this film.

The plot is pretty simple. Peter Parker is a nerdy, geeky teen at high school. When he gets bitten by a radioactive spider however, he develops ""amazing"" spider-like powers. Laters, to avenge the death of a loved one, he becomes the superhero ""Spiderman"" with his new abilities. Along the way, he develops a romance with a crush, and later must come face to face with the villain ""the Lizard"" a powerful creature Spiderman is (ironically) responsible for.

The POSITIVES:
-Most of the cast was great. I loved almost each portrayel as I did with the cast in the old trilogy. Andrew Garfield did just as good a job as Tobey Maguire, while giving a very different take on the character.

-The effects and action were very good. Not improved over the old trilogy by THAT much, but still very good.

-MOST of the writing was really good. They did a great job at establishing this new world for future movies.

-The dircting was great. The film was paced very well.

-If there is one thing that was ""improved"" comparing this to the old trilogy, it's Gwen Stacy. I actually thought Gwen Stacy was both written and acted very well in Spiderman 3, but, Emma Stone stole the show whenever she was on screen. Also, the love story was very good in the old trilogy, but, it's REALLY good in this movie. Garfield and Stone did a great job together.

The NEGATIVES:
-The biggest problem with this film is how it never feels that ""necessary"". Say what you will about Spiderman 3, but it certainly wasn't TERRIBLE. The trilogy just didn't feel ""complete"" at the time. A reboot to compare this to is Batman Begins. Why did Batman Begins work as a reboot? It was a reboot that NEEDED to happen (considering the last Batman film we had before this was the horrible Batman and Robin). Also, Batman Begins was a VERY different film in comparison to ""Batman, 1989"". The Amazing Spiderman, however, is another origin story. Although Amazing Spiderman is very different from ""Spiderman, 2002"" there is still writing that is almost identical (with it being another origin story). If this came out BEFORE ""Spiderman, 2002"" this movie would have seemed much better. But, watching this, there are differences for the sake of it, so you can't help but think ""this scene is almost identical to the first film"" or ""that was changed ONLY to be different from the original"", so that can be a problem while viewing this movie.

-In terms of casting, almost all the actors did a great job. However, the one character I thought was MUCH better in the old trilogy is Uncle Ben. The actor in this film is OK, but isn't nearly as good as the original actor.

-Another big problem with this movie is the Lizard. For one thing, the character design isn't BAD, but it reminds me WAY to much of Killer croc from Batman: The animated series (just with a tail)The CGI was great, but I didn't care for the design at all. Some people are trying to defend this design beacause it's based off of the ""original"" Lizard character (because of him not having a snout) BUT, when you compare the designs, they are still VERY different. Also, I personally thought the Lizard character was written the weakest out of all the characters, which is a shame considering he is the main villain. They had a great build up and origin for the character, but once he was established, it seemed like they ran out of ideas. As a villain, I thought his character was written REALLY badly in the climax.

-This film was promoted as ""the untold story"" but in reality, they don't give you much more information than what you got in the old trilogy. Specifically, they HEAVILY marketed a plot premise in this film, which is the fate of Peters parents. Unfortunately, everything you get in this movie about his parents is pretty much given to you in the trailers. There isn't any plot twist or ""reveal"" given at all, as the trailers promised.

-And another thing I hated? MORE false advertising! In the trailers,there are a few lines of dialogue that aren't heard (or even hinted at) in the film: ""Did you actually think that what happend to you Peter, was an accident?"" and ""If you want the truth Peter, come and get it!"" I swear, there is NO WAY these lines were cut from the film without there being changes in the writing first, NOTHING like these lines were even hinted at in the film.

-The 3D. I didn't HATE the 3D, but it is converted, which I was not aware of. There are 1 or 2 cool scenes in 3D, but that doesn't make up the ticket price. This movie just is NOT worth paying the 3D price, which is a shame considering Spiderman is a PERFECT concept for a 3D movie.

Overall, the biggest things that weigh this movie down is the poor writing of the Lizard, and that you can't help but think of the old Spiderman trilogy in some scenes, which takes the fun out of the experiance. But hey, Spiderman is one of my favorite super heros, and I thought they did an excellent job in this new direction. Like I said, there is no ""true"" take on the character. Tobey Maguire did a great job with his performance, and Andrew Garfield gives a great performance to. Overall, The Amazing Spiderman isn't quite ""amazing"" but it is just as good as Spiderman 1 and 3 (just not nearly as good as Spiderman 2) So, if you didn't care for the ""classic 60s"" take on Raimis' Spiderman movies, you should have a good time with this one. A solid 4 out of 5 star superhero flick. :)",1349913600,24,7211,4.519171779141105

I mean come on, if the spider could give him all the other abilities why not web shooting abilities also. That is where I actually liked the original movies over this one and the original comic. Shotting webs from his wrists was better in my humble opinion but not to original comic. But original comic was done a long time ago. This is a more modern time, with Avengers, etc. so going back to old school original isn't that great of an idea for younger people. Maybe the older generations traditionalist prefer it but not me.

4423298,3,B004LWZWFQ,"NOTE: I will be updating this review as soon as the movie gets to be  released on November 9, 2012 and it will be specifically on the 3D Home Version, but as of now it has been confirmed that the 3D Bluray Version is going to be released with an ASPECT RATIO OF: 2.40:1 which is absolutely horrible for 3D viewing.

WHY SUCH A BIG DEAL ABOUT THIS ASPECT RATIO?:
For those of us who already hated the so called ""black bars"" on top and bottom of the screen while watching a regular movie, this is really bad for 3D Home viewers, as this WILL TAKE AWAY FROM WHAT MAKES 3D WORTH THE PURCHASE TO BEGIN WITH, minimizing the effect by a big percentage, unless you have a 80"" 3D TV which I'm pretty sure most of us don't have.

SO WHAT'S THE ""APPROPRIATE"" ASPECT RATIO THAT SHOULD BE IN 3D HOME MOVIES?
Most 3D movies right now are NOT being released with the desirable an Aspect Ratio that will fill the whole screen giving you the whole 3D effect BUT movies like THE AVENGERS, WRATH OF THE TITANS and the soon to be released AVATAR 3D, are some of the very few that could display with an average Aspect Ratio of: 1.77:1 WHICH WILL take advantage of your New 3D TV as you expected to display from day one.

With that said, This movie unfortunately doesn't support that type of Aspect Ratio which is a complete waste of extra money for the 3D Bluray version, and even with an enormous TV set...the bigger the TV, the bigger the ""black bars"" .

ABOUT THE MOVIE:
I did like this movie when I went to see in IMAX 3D, I think it had a good use of the technology. Story wise I don't think is half bad as many people say...it's not perfect, but certainly enjoyable. About the special effects? well I personally think the ""LIZARD"" could have been done with a lot more detail, aside from that the movie itself was well worth the price of admission. But will the 3D version be worth the purchase???

4423301,4,B004LWZWFQ,"I went into this film as a skeptic, as I thought Sam Raimi's take (most of it, anyway) was pretty brilliant.  I thought this would be too much emo and not enough superhero, but I was surprised to find it chock full of the latter and none of the former.  Andrew Garfield is spot-on in this role, and he and the other case carry it to greatness.  It's no Avengers, but it doesn't try to be--this is just a flat-out good solitary-superhero movie that opens the door to a more modern Spiderman mythos. The characters are very likable, the action is fun (again, nothing epic like Avengers), and it's got plenty of comedy that fits.  This is a great start for a potentially amazing trilogy.",1348963200,6,684,4.448

His performance and portraying of emotions were superb. Emma Stone (The Help) was very convincing and a sweetheart. She was able to convey the innocent but mischievous girlfriend brilliantly. Great cinematography, film direction (Mark Webb) and film editing. Storyline was not original though. A superhero motivated by revenge at first and able to bottle up his personal feelings later on with a villain starting as a good scientist who gets carried away by ambition. Some fundamental but small changes on the original character that may be hard to swallow by hardcore fans.  Highly recommended.",1348963200,4,763,5.104

Emma Stone is a better actor than Kirstin Dunst. Yes this is a more realistic version but it still has a lot of humor. He is sarcastic and makes jokes just like spidey of the comics, which is the main thing that always bothered me about the Sam Raimi trilogy is that Spiderman wasn't a smart alec like he was in the comics.

4423304,2,B004LWZWFQ,"This film disappointed me. I went to the theater expecting a film better than the Avengers (which I liked alot, but didn't love) - a film second only to the Dark Knight Rises of all the summer blockbusters. Instead, I saw Peter Parker zipping around on his skateboard and looking like a cross between a teenaged X-Games reject and a goth, a giant talking Lizard with an accent (the accent wasn't a problem; the portrayal of the character as a whole was), and - SPOILER ALERT - Peter becoming Spiderman without having first found his uncle's killer. I understand that the retelling of a story already so familiar to so many usually calls for tweaks here and there, but how exactly am I supposed to believe that Peter Parker is fully invested in this whole ""superhero"" thing when the aforementioned pivotal moment is ommitted from his development? Does it just happen?

Don't get me wrong; I understand that this movie is most likely just the beginning of a series, and the many questions raised by it could be answered in films to come (and satisfyingly so). This may mean that fans like myself can expect a great, full-bodied sequel(s). However, such an approach can be overdone, as I believe it was here. This film left a bit too much to be desired. Andrew Garfield is a good actor - however, the material with which he had to work left me a little lost on his journey to becoming Spiderman. I wasn't buying his motivation for becoming a true, self-sacrificing crimefighter, nor was I moved by his and Emma Stone's (Gwen Stacy's) relationship. All of that, and I was kind of annoyed by the overuse of ""awkward teenager""-stylized dialogue that both characters stammered through in their talks with each other.

Emma Stone's was another case of good acting with lacking material, but I'm not sure if I can make said excuse for Rhys Ifans. The Lizard was just bland; a case of poor execution without a hint of true menace to his look (not the most impressive CGI job to say the least). Add all of that to the fact that the Lizard - not Dr. Connors, but the LIZARD - could talk, and you're left with man-lizard sized cheesiness. And if you're expecting compensation for all of this in the form of knock-down, drag-out fight scenes between the Lizard and Spiderman, think again. I certainly wasn't pleased with Spiderman's overuse of webbing and acrobatics against the monster. Call me old-fashioned, but I wanted to see more fist-fighting and better displays of both characters' physical strength. The fight scenes (all of them, not just the ones involving the Lizard) looked too much like dancing. Pretty boring, frustrating stuff to watch.

In a word, this movie felt incomplete. Whether with regards to character development or the plot itself, the Amazing Spiderman seemed too much like the setup for something better. The good news about that comes in the form of much potential for a great sequel, but the bad news is - until said sequel is made - all we have is this.",1348876800,14,2971,4.698656429942418
4423365,3,B004LWZWFQ,"What kind of mentality hires a guy with exactly one major film under his belt, a quiet study-your-belly-button arthouse flick no less, to deliver on such a large action stage? I'm truly stunned. And despite what the numbers say, it's just as important to look at the breakdown. BoxOfficeMojo has this reboot a big time winner, but look carefully. Out of the $743M total receipts on a reported budget of $230M, not including a massive advertising campaign, check out how much came from domestic sales. Pretty much dead even with the budget. Very, very telling.

Not particularly surprised, but very disappointed this new creative team intentionally injecting vampire angst into this story. Done while simultaneously fumbling and sacrificing the action aspect. Why?

Add to that let down: Twenty-eight year old Andrew Garfield's surprisingly unsympathetic characterization in a role that was perfectly crafted to appeal to the youth market. Seriously, what bullied kid didn't want to have super powers at least once as an outcast teenager? But this guy, wow, very nearly drained the fun out the character. Bordering very close to callow goth territory sans the white face paint and mascara.

And were there three subplots because there were three writers - each having to have their say? Collaborative efforts without a stern arbiter usually ends poorly. This being a prime example. An inconsistent script filled with unfinished threads and underhanded fiscal motivations:

Examples:

- Unfinished. What happened to Peter's fervent desire to find the man with the tattoo? Guess Gwen sorta swept the young man off his feet. Really? He's that shallow that Uncle Ben becomes nothing more than a trivial side-story? The bitter memory of self-indulgence that made Peter such a great hero - to never again let his personal b.s. overcome his greater responsibility - is completely obliterated in this version of Spidey. Pathetic.

And in comparison, how utterly bizarre was it that Peter was more emotionally devastated at the loss of his girlfriend's father - a man he barely knew? Truly unbelievable. <shaking head in dismay>

- Underhanded. The moment Peter celebrates the full extent of his powers is via skateboard. Good gravy. What marketing bleep-hole forced that onto the movie? Why not showcase all the X-Games skills with bottles of Mountain Dew strewn about and be done with it? Shoot, why not just skip all the pretense and have Peter winning the X-Games and save us all the trouble?

There were a few moments, lost in amongst the uneven editing, where there were glimpses of something wonderful and grand; where the actors touched us, the audience, and delivered something beyond the script. But those scenes were too little to save this production from mediocrity.

This production is much less a reboot and more a twisted hybrid of commercial desires leeching off a dependable workhorse like a parasitic remora. Having paid my fee - I slogged through to the routine violin-synched melodramatic finish.

Sony is doing something I never conceived: Killing the Golden Goose in order to eat goose.

It doesn't make for good movies, but it makes interesting spectacle. Viewing shortsighted greed overwhelm better, smarter products. Sort of the gastronomic equivalent of watching McDonald's make their hamburgers without hamburger meat while telling everyone how great their new burgers will be. How long before people catch on? Is there a chance to save the franchise? This new business model interests me and, sadly, was the biggest attraction in screening the flick.

Movie Notes:

- I was going to say I felt sorry for Denis Leary but realized - bleep it - he got paid. The man's laughing cause it's not his movie.

- Liked the C. Thomas Howell cameo. Man keeps chugging along. Proof that character actors can make a decent living in the industry.

4423370,5,B004LWZWFQ,"When Sam Raimi's first Spider-man film was released in 2002, it was an important step for comic book movies.  Whereas at one point, a superhero films could easily get by because of their fan base flocking to the theaters, rather than showcasing quality storytelling.  The first Spider-man film, while not perfect, showcased that if filmmakers took the time, they could create good characters with great arcs.  After the monumental critical and commercial success of Spider-man 2, movie studios started taking notice to how much more people get enthralled with their superhero characters when they're actually given developed personalities and fascinating stories.

In 2010, Columbia pictures announced that the Spider-man movie franchise was getting a reboot, being directed by Marc Webb (believe it or not, there are conspiracy theories saying that he only got the gig because of his last name).  Webb's only other theatrical film, 500 Days of Summer, was an excellent film focused on relationships and characters, making him seem like a terrific choice for a franchise based on the everyday, and superhero, struggles of a young man trying to find balance in his life.  However, this did not stop the flood of questions concerning this new film; after all, it was a reboot that wasn't as necessary as the Nolan Batman films, not to mention the series was rebooted only a few years after the last film in Raimi's series.  Would this film justify people seeing a similar origin story?  Would a traditional drama director be able to incorporate thrilling action?  Could this be as good as other contemporary superhero films like The Dark Knight, Iron Man, and Thor?

Rest assured, this Spider-man outing is the one fans and movie-goers alike have been waiting for.

Amazing Spider-man stars Andrew Garfield in the role of Peter Parker, a good-natured young man in High School who's as smart as he is unpopular with the ladies.  Being raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben (Sally Fields and Martin Sheen, respectively), he stumbles across old scientific notes written by his father.  This discovery starts off a journey for Peter, as his parents went missing as a little boy.  He eventually runs into Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans), whose reveals that his work with Peter's father could have helped him regrow his lost arm, but his disappearance promptly ended the research.  Peter also befriends Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) a smart peer at school who Peter starts a fledgling romantic relationship.  An accident occurs at Osborn industries as Peter is bitten by a genetically enhanced Spider giving the young man superhuman powers and abilities.

The story in Amazing Spider-man is just that - Amazing.  The character arc for Peter Parker is phenomenal, with the filmmakers giving him enthralling personal gravitas, believable naivety, and a charming demeanor for any member of the audience to enjoy.  As Peter grows into his role as protector of New York organically, seeing him through his journey is a joy.  The film brings up a surprising amount of theological topics when regarding vigilantes in society including vengeance, identity, and responsibility.  Every character is well-written and imbued with a terrific sense of believability.  The films fascinates the critic in me as it's not only brazen enough to twist genre conventions, but, in some instances, outright breaks them to tell the story yet never feels inorganic to the narrative.

Andrew Garfield was born to play the role of Peter Parker.  His comedic timing, endearing charm, and earnest optimism perfectly fit the character of Peter as he becomes New York's savior.  Emma Stone should be given equal praise as Gwen Stacy who combines intelligence, grace, and humor that makes her and Andrew Garfield perfect companions.  You can really see the chemistry between these two young actors and at no point in the film does one ever question the development of their relationship.  Rhys Ifans plays Curt Connors as a man abandoned at his most vulnerable place in life, which gives him and Peter a certain sense of kinship over their respective abandonment.  Connors as a character is more sympathetic than your usual superhero antagonist, so much so that, even when he's transformed himself into The Lizard, he's not so much threatening as he is fascinating slipping into his new altered state of mind.  Denis Leary plays Captain George Stacy, a dedicated cop and family man who provides Peter with his perspective of law, those who uphold it, and how vigilantism is counter-productive; it's also great to see him and Peter interact as it gives way to classic ""meeting the Dad"" scenarios all teenage boys dread.  Martin Sheen as Uncle Ben and Sally Fields as Aunt May are great and are given much more to say this time around.  They're both good characters who help instill Peter with sagely advice, helping him down the road of using his talents for the world's benefit.

The action in the film is stunning.  Scenes of CG and practical stunts blend seamlessly together, like Spider-man's ""School Fight"" that decimates the entire building.  While the design of The Lizard wasn't what I expected, the CG and acting from Ifans made the character come alive, and never at any point making him seem like just another effect to dazzle the audience.  In this film, Spider-man has found a lot more agility than in his previous cinematic excursions, that portrayed him as a bit stiffer in his movements, as he gracefully moves about in battle and through the air with ease.  While the soundtrack is never as memorable as the characters or story, the rest of the audio is crafted masterfully incorporating everything from the wet sliminess of The Lizard's skin, to the pop sounds of Spidey's web-shooters, to the bending of metal and breaking of glass.  It would criminal to not at least touch on the fantastic cinematography that can capture both intimate emotional scenes and heart-pounding action with equal finesse.

This film is simply outstanding and is one of the best comic-book superhero films to date.  With an incredible cast, a thrilling story, and spot-on direction, The Amazing Spider-man is a film that easily ranks among my favorites!",1348617600,5,6199,5.040196078431372

4423372,4,B004LWZWFQ,"I felt this movie was a good contribution to the Spider-Man brand. It's not the best and not necessarily anything new, but otherwise I felt it was worth the price of admission. I'm gonna break this review down as much as possible with comparisions and improvements to the original trilogy. At the end of the day I would love it if Marvel Studios acquired the filming rights back for Spider-Man, but instead this is what we have so I'm going by my interpretation since Sony wants to hold onto their cash cow.

Cast:
First, I have to point out the casting was great. Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker was nothing short of genius. Martin Sheen as Ben Parker was handled well and we had enough time to really get to know him and what he meant to the other characters. Sally Field as Mae Parker was nice as well. I definitely commend Raimi for portraying her image exactly as in the comic, but I do have to say I don't really prefer the old and frail Aunt May so my kudos to Marc Webb. Dennis Leary as Captain Stacy was great as well. Emma Stone as Gwen did a good job and Rhys Ifans as Curt Connors was just fantastic. I really commend them for the casting this go round. Everyone seemed to fit into their roles pretty well.

Story:
As far as the plot goes, it's not something relatively new except for the back story of Peter's parents and an obvious link to Oscorp which I found interesting. So there's that element of a kid who is raised by his relatives, but longing for knowledge of his parents. The only link to information about his parents is Dr. Curt Connors (Lizard) who currently works for Oscorp. The way the plot played out to every action there was a plausible reaction. The way he got his powers made more sense and his transition from vigilante into his calling as a hero made more sense. Overall the story isn't some new style. It's a basic formula, but it has a better focus which doesn't jump all over the place. You should be able to follow it with no problem. My only problem is I felt his Peter's parents should have remained the focus since that was the primary focal point of the film to begin with. Not saying it wasn't important, but I felt it should have stayed a driving force to Peter's character on top of everything else.

Action:
In classic Spidey fashion, the action was great as you would expect. One difference I see is that they really utilized the stuntpeople as much as possible without heavily resorting to CGI through every scene (unless Lizard is involved). There was a sense of balance with stuntpeople and CGI which I felt was great. When it was necessary to use CGI it was and vice versa with stunt pros.

Nerd Comparison:
Now I'm not going to rant about how I hated Spider-Man 3. Been there, done that. This is just an overall comparison. Raimi's films set a standard and were great for what they were at the time. They were campy, fun and just different than what we were used to. I feel Webb just took the same formula and made some improvements (mainly with the character development and story focus). I have nothing against Toby Maguire. I think he's a good actor. Toby as Peter Parker was definitely a send up to the Amazing Fantasy comics of old which I can commend the production team for, but in this day and age he's not the type of person everyone can really relate to. We can't help, but see Toby as Peter Parker because he was the first in a major film to play the rold and no one else at the time could fill it. I do think he was good, but he wasn't great. I recently watched Spider-Man 2 again and I must say I didn't like how the characters were portrayed, except Jameson. Peter's personality was always dry, mostly depressed and he was constantly obsessed with Mary Jane to the point where it's comical. I felt Webb's portrayal of Peter was more involved. You really feel for him as things happens in his life. I'm glad they fully showcased Peter's genius level intellect to its full potential by watching him invent the web shooters and his ""think tank"" moments with Connors as well as on his own. We really got a chance to see how really smart he was in this movie which I feel the Raimi films lacked. He threw out a few big words here and there, but that was it. Also, I love having the wisecracking Spidey in this movie. It's something I felt vastly missing in the previous trilogy. In the original trilogy, Spidey had 3 to 5 wisecracks maximum which left it as just an over the top action scene. Garfield greatly portrayed an awkward teen trying to find his place in the world and his entire world didn't revolve around the love interest like the original trilogy. In Raimi's films whenever Peter and MJ were on screen it was always an awkward situation and felt forced. It just didn't meld well to me.

Overall:
I feel this movie was a good addition and I feel that it was a more stable installment for it to build into a stronger franchise. I know many don't feel that way, but I feel this is a gem waiting to be polished. The only drawback is that emphasis on Peter's parents seemed to be done more in the trailers than in the actual film. I felt that was misleading. Raimi's films set the bar for it's time and I don't think it took itself too seriously in the beginning. Although I do feel it's a shame to have to start over again after looking at the material I can see why it felt necessary. I feel The Amazing Spider-Man is as true to source material of today. It's entertaining, fun, and treated with respect.",1348099200,2,5478,4.3772102161100195

4423439,2,B004LWZWFQ,"As much as I love Spider-man, this reboot was a total waste.

Terrible casting, terrible script.

Marc Webb has made a Spider-man movie devoid of any creative vision. It's pedestrian and mediocre.

The script has so many groan moments...and barely any, if at all, quality memorable cinematic moments.

Andrew Garfield has given us a douchebag emo Peter Parker. It's like they took Spidey from Raimi Part 3, when he becomes an emo idiot, and now its a permanent affliction.  And the villain, the Lizard, was about as generic and a cookiecutout character as it gets.

A major disappointment to say the least. Sam Raimi's trilogy was far more entertaining, engaging, and spectacular. This is not.

When Parker discovers his spider-powers...what does he do? listens to Coldplay and does skateboard tricks. At that point, I realized this franchise has taken a major turn for the worse. can it be corrected in the sequel? yes. Will it be? I doubt it.

What should have happened: Disney should have bought the rights from Sony (yes, that would be expensive but worth it) and created a new Spider-man story that would eventually link him up with the Avengers. Now that would be awesome, to combine the characters into one cogent continuous Marvel universe.",1347494400,19,1248,4.937799043062201

This beats them all.

It doesn't have quite the action of part 2, but it makes up for it with heart. We can feel every growing pain Peter Parker has. Before and AFTER the Spider-bite. You will feel a bit of retreading as the movie begins, but once you see Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker, all will be forgiven. He plays Peter with an emotional core not found in the Raimi films. There is some depth to him. A little rage, a lot of grief and guilt....but he has something else.

We like him. We want him to succeed. We can feel the butterflies in our stomach as he nervously talks to Gwen Stacy, who is portrayed by the radiant and stunning Emma Stone. Also, the romance in this film is superb. We get an organic relationship. We see a mutual love and respect for each other, and we see some real chemistry between the leads. This sells it.

Honestly, I could go into the Lizard, but he isn't very deep. The one weak link in the film. Still, he serves his purpose, and we get a promise of great things to come.

But for those of you like me who grew up with the real Amazing Spider-man and even the series on Fox, seeing this movie will less than amaze you.  Granted, it's better than Sam Raimi's Spiderman 3, but then again, what isn't??  The fact that Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield are an actual item off the screen doesn't help, since there are too many romantic scenes.  Spoiler: realistically, no girl would ever french a guy who spent his night swimming in doodie cookie water.  The story is too long, considering it takes a good hour and some change for Peter to finally dawn the costume.  And when he does, he stalks his suspects from atop gargoyles and rooftops.  It felt more like a Bruce Wayne on a budget hero than a ""oh wow, that was Spider!!"".  Honestly, he spends most of the movie twitchy and being angry than being the quick-witted sarcastic Spidey of the comics.

The highly anticipated Lizard, fairly done.  He is grizzly and terrifying, but when you finally see him it's rather underwhelming.  Oh, and I should mention, for a Spider-man film, you would expect web-slinging since that is his trademark.  Yeah, not so much since that part of his character seems to have been written out.  Not too mention the yellow eyes threw me off a bit, but that's just me.  My wife and I love comics and were greatly dissappointed in this film.

The other reason is I wanted to give it a chance, to me it was exciting and boring.
Several people have pointed out that the main actor kept on taking off the mask.
Hello, It's a spiderman film not show my face sort of film. The mask needs to stay on, the Lizard was off and he never looked like that. It looked like one of those lizards from the D&D books.

Normally I hate remakes and I also hate it when directors and writers don't do the research to keep true to the comic's.

There is no clear webbing drawn on his mask like the old comics, His eyes are yellow instead of reflective or white, and his head is so large that he honestly looks more like Martian from space then the wall crawler i know and love.  THERE IS NO J. Jonah Jameson in this movie!!!! which is madness! seeing how he first appeared in Amazing spiderman comic #1!!!!!!!!  of March 1963 !!! YES HE APPEARED IN THE VERY FIRST ISSUE OF SPIDERMAN!!!! SO WHY Isn't he here????  THERE IS NO HARRY , NOT EVEN AN HONORABLE MENTION OF HIM , no bonding with aunt may , nothing warm just stupidity. Oh and did i mention how crappy peter parker is in this film??? Instead of being the warm hearted underdog that most people can relate to ,  we now have a dark , snotty , and arrogant peter parker who's now  a lover boy who shoots webs at Gwen stacy on a roof top and makes out with her all the time...Uhhh last i checked parker was a dork and he only gained confidence when he was wearing his suite, Thats why he constantly verbal lashed out all of his enemies with wise cracks and lame jokes because at heart he was a loser! Sami rami's parker captured this on so many levels.

NEXT There are so many inconsistencies in this film that its disgusting , take for instance ( SPOILER!!! ) when spiderman went out to look for uncle bens murderer. There was a point and time where he ran in fear from simple thugs , yet a few scenes later hes chasing a 10 foot tall lizard man. Question... wouldn't you be more terrified of a giant lizard opposed to simple thugs?  And second, why would spiderman run from thugs! he could easily whip them blindfolded!  ...I remember when i saw this in the theatre a few months back.. A 10 year old kid in the audience asked his mom the exact same thing I just stated to you guys above, "" mom why is spiderman running away from thugs when he has super powers!""  as funny as that may sound, THIS made me incredibly mad!!!! I nearly left the theatre after seeing that scene.

Oh and did i mention the action?
 The action scenes lasted 5 seconds , Lizard looked like king Kupa from mario not The lizard i knew and loved. And lastly spider-mans powers were weakened 10 fold!! he had trouble swinging with his webs!!! got shot in the leg and limped, swung through lizards legs like a monkey instead of punching him in the face or kicking him!!

I'll start with the worst aspect - a character who could've worn a shirt that read ""plot device."" Poor Flash...I thought he was poorly developed, and only surfaced in the story to do things that had to happen to move the story along. Is it possible for two people to have a weird relationship like Flash and Peter? Of course! But it didn't feel like a relationship, just a push-button character, angry one moment, then slightly thoughtful, on to startingly understanding, and finally comic relief. Yeah, weird.
Some nice choreography, though less special effects and a tighter plot line would've been appreciated.  And I think I would've slapped Peter, not kissed him. Disrespectful, creepy teenager. Shudder... Something about the actor's approach to kissing made me think of a cobra swaying to a charmer's flute.

He played the coy, yet brilliant Parker flawlessly and looked PERFECT in the Spidey suit. The first scene when he wore it I could not stop smiling. He put Maguire to shame in this aspect alone. His sense of humor was far superior, another thing Maguire failed at. Webb really brought his humanity out, as Spidey takes some serious beating in this flick, yet keeps getting back up. You get plenty of Parker drama to set up a foundation for Spidey and his own individual problems. The action and web swinging looks phenomenal, and doesn't come off as a high-budget Power Rangers flick, unlike Raimi's previous films. To quote another huge Spidey fan I am friends with ""There's no point watching the previous three after this one. Someone finally got Spidey right"". But if you're not that big a Spidey fan then by all means continue to watch the first three films. Personally, couldn't go back to Raimi's trilogy if I tried, as this film was spectacular from the beginning, to the obligatory comicbook cover final shot.

What Raimi did was immense but after three movies it was high time to inject some sort of fresh tone & vision, & ultimately bring something further to the table on a new film. I don't think it was too soon at all to do something new with a Spider-Man movie. Despite this being an origin story I can't help but feel that if anything, ASM more than makes up for Raimi's Spider-Man 3 catastrophe because in Webb's interpretation we've got a much more cerebral story with less emphasis on ""popcorn flick"" not with standing the slick & spectacular live action & special effects. Also to all the naysayers; The Lizard's look effectively resembles his very first appearance as illustrated by Steve Ditko & successfully fusions the various versions of this classic villains 49 year history. Andrew Garfield does a great job portraying a very different & introspective Peter Parker. Director Marc Webb really put's Parker through the ringer in this one. Mentally & physically. In total, Marc Webb's movie knocks down the original Spider-Man film aesthetically plus it's a bit more brooding too recalling influences begun in a film like Daredevil but translated successfully in a powerhouse like Batman Begins.

4423577,5,B004LWZWFQ,"I was(and still am) a devoted fan of Raimi's trilogy. I grew up reading the comics and watching the cartoons. So when I heard they were doing a reboot of my favorite superhero, I really wasn't too keen on the idea, especially so soon. It took me a few weeks and a few pushy friends to get me to watch it.

Let's just say I've officially put it on my top 10 list of favorite movies, and I made every effort to enjoy it on the big screen as many times as possible. I'm not going to go into an entire description of the plot and events, as its been done plenty enough in other reviews.

What really did it for me was Andrew Garfield as Spider-man. Yes I love Tobey's Spidey, but for me, Garfield really nailed it. He's the nerdy, socially awkward, wise cracking teenager dealing with unresolved issues, first loves and trying to figure out who he is as both Peter and Spider-man. Andrew portrays it perfectly. You really believe he's a 17 year old high school kid. Tobey was great, but he was never that kid that Spiderman started out as. The corny cracks Spidey delivers and Peter's awkward moments only make it more enjoyable and add a nice touch of comic relief to a much darker story underneath.

This movie was completely different from Raimi's trilogy. Yes we revisit some of the same plots, obviously considering it is a movie about the same character. It is a much slower paced movie than the other 3, which I had no problem with because it only added to the character/relationship development and I feel it has set up a lot for the next few movies. As said before, this is done in a much darker, more emotional take on Peter's story. We're being exposed to another side of the Spider-Man universe here. His parents have always been a mystery, and I love exploring that. I am also extremely pleased with Gwen Stacy being the love interest. She played a huge role in Peter's life in the comics and so far the movie has developed it just right. I have high hopes for where this aspect of the story is going (if you've read the comics or know of Gwen's story I'm sure you do as well). Emma Stone makes a perfect Gwen. I'll go ahead and say that I was overly pleased with this entire cast.

Next, the action scenes. The suit, the movements, the original web-shooters, the web-swinging. Superb. Garfield's body and movements are so spider-like its uncanny. I like the fact that Garfield performed a lot of the stunts himself. I thought the suit was a fresh look for Spider-Man. The effects - more animated looking and I loved it. Gave the movie a very comic book feel. The action scenes were intense and thoroughly entertaining.

4423579,3,B004LWZWFQ,"Let's start with the qualifiers:  I thoroughly enjoy comic book movies, even from comics I've never read.  As a kid, I spent a lot of time writing and drawing my own comic books and then re-wrote and re-drew them as I improved.  So, I can understand the desire to remake something that might have flaws.  My problem is I think this film has more problems than its predecessor.  The old adage; ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"" comes to mind.  Of course, the original Sam Raimi version wasn't perfect but it certainly didn't fail.  Let's swing into the details.

WHAT WAS BROKEN?
The original ""Spiderman"" did a great job of capturing the spirit and feel, if not the story of the original comic book.  All the characters felt ""right"" and in their proper place.  The film had a colorful style much like the comic.  The films story was the comic book digested and perfected.  In my mind, the only real weak spot might have been the special effects, which were state-of the-art at the time, but look somewhat dated today.  But above all these things, the one thing I liked about the original was that it was highly entertaining.  In comparison, ""The Amazing Spiderman"" failed where the original succeeded and vice-versa.  The visual effects were mostly spectacular (Lizard not withstanding) but everything else was lacking.  The story lacked the flow of the original.  We lost many fun characters (Jamison?) or changed them (Gwen for Marryjane).  The overall feel was much too dark.  Finally, everybody was in the wrong place.  Especially with the absence of the daily bugle did the new film seem- well, lost.  So this film didn't feel right to me.  Though perhaps more true to the original comic, it was not as much fun.  So, no; I don't think this film needed to be made.  However, Does that totally devalue the re-do as a stand-alone?

FAILING ON ITS OWN
To give a film three stars there had better be more wrong with it than ""I liked the original better"".  How about treating a film all dark and seriously, trying to have more plausible explanations for things (based on the rules you've defined).  That's ok, but you'd better be consistent and you'd better not cheat at the end for the stories convenience.  Well, ""The Amazing Spiderman"" does this very quickly.  One example is the desire to explain his ability to climb walls.  The original film did this as well (the little hooks coming out of his fingers).  Unlike the original film though, peter parker climbs walls and hangs from ceilings while wearing athletic shoes.  It sounds nitpicky but that's the price of getting into the details.  Given the rules of the world that has been defined, there is no explanation for this.  In fact, everything about Spiderman's costume, technology, and abilities appears less plausible than in the original film.  No explanation whatsoever is given for how he acquired all the things he has (not all of his own invention I might add).  Perhaps the choice to treat this more seriously backfired?  Beyond technological nitpicking is the highly implausible turn of events near the end of the film that would require hours of planning by heroic construction workers, but occur within a matter of minutes.  Even worse than the impossibility of it all is the sheer corniness of the groan inducing attempt at depicting the heroic ""everyman"" coming to the aid of our hero; something pulled off brilliantly in the first two Spiderman films.

SUCCEEDING ON ITS OWN
For the most part, I enjoyed this film until plausibility fell off a cliff near the end.  All those technological contradictions and omissions could be overlooked.  The action was pretty fun thanks to the new age of visual fix.  Many criticize the Lizard which is understandable, though it really didn't bother me.  The pacing was a bit slow but I never complain about good character development.  Next to the story, character development is most important in my mind.  These characters are well enough developed with the possible exception of Sally Field's Aunt May who seemed a lot like Sally Field to me.  Martin Sheen's ""Uncle Ben"" was great to me.  He made a great impression on Peter without spewing ""quote-able"" lines from the comics.  Denis Leary as the police chief was a great and likable character.  I enjoyed Peter's argument over dinner with him. Who is the better Peter Parker is strictly a matter of taste as both versions are fine.  If it seems like I'm stretching for compliments, your right.  Actually, my favorite thing about this movie was Stan Lee's obligatory cameo; the best ever!  That's not saying much.

WITH GREAT BUDGET COMES GREAT ....
No need to finish that line eh?  Clearly, my ultimate verdict is that this film didn't need to get made.  We have a perfectly awesome origin of Spiderman movie already.  Though not as true to the comics in story as this film, it does a better job of capturing the spirit of the comic.  I'd have rather seen an attempt at bringing another character to life than a re-hashing of something that wasn't broken.  If the goal was a more realistic and plausible story, then this film failed to deliver.  If the goal was to capture a more accurate telling of the original comic, then it has succeeded while missing the mark on entertainment value.  It seems like a lot of time, money, and effort for nothing.  How about another attempt at getting the Hulk right?  Well, maybe not.

4423580,3,B004LWZWFQ,"It's been only ten years since we saw the first installment of the ""Spider-Man"" trilogy directed by Sam Raimi. My simple question is, do we really need another one now? The Hollywood studios seem to think so, but entertaining as it is, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" almost made me think otherwise.

The storyline is basically the same as that of the 2002 version. By saying ""the same"" I mean the same theme, not characters. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" follows the process of how an ordinary high school student Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) gains superpowers and learns how to use them. There is a love interest, Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), not Mary Jane Watson. One major difference is inclusion of Peter's parents and their mysterious disappearance.

So far, so good. But somehow they chose the wrong director for the job, Marc Webb of ""(500) Days Of Summer"" fame. His direction is slick and each scene is done professionally, but as a whole the film seems inconsistent in tone and pacing. In short, what does Peter Parker want to do? Finding his parents? Finding the robber with a star tattoo on his wrist? In the second half of the film both storylines are forgotten, superseded by the third one.

This time around, it is Dr. Curt Connors / the Lizard - a character played by Dylan Baker in the original ""Spider-Man 2"" and ""3"" - whom Spider-Man has to fight, or save. In the 2012 version the doctor the Oscorp Laboratories is played by understated Rhys Ifans. Though I think he did a very good job as tormented Dr. Connors, the effects of the Lizard are simply disappointing, and the fight sequences between the two are done without much creativity. In fact, the special effects of the entire film are decent, but not outstanding.

The process of Peter finding his new abilities and creating the trademark costume looks contrived and is often rushed. To understand how to use his powers, Peter has to beat up the subway passengers (and they are no criminals) and do a Parkour-inspired chase in the street. In the new version the Spider-Man is certainly described as a more vulnerable hero, and that's not a bad idea, but the way it is shown to us needs improvement.

As you know, Marvel is ready for a new string of films based on its superheroes, and as to Spider-Man a sequel will be coming sooner or later (don't miss the film's post-credit footage). I hope whoever writes the script next time will find a better story for Peter Parker or Spider-Man.",1344902400,12,2447,4.694638694638694

So after a month, I finally made the time to go see this. Initially, I wasn't too excited by the teaser, but the full theatrical trailer really got me hyped when I saw what they did with the suit, how they choreographed some of the action, and how they produced the movie aesthetically. In fact, before going to see this, I refreshed myself on Sam Raimi's trilogy just for the sake of making a better comparison. That is to say, as a fan of the hit cartoon show from the '90s, Raimi nailed the style at the time, putting a very campy, over-the-top, and blatant ""comic book"" vibe to it. His trilogy was briskly-paced, vividly colorful, and at times, even a little silly for silly's sake (especially the third; in fact, I'd say it was a little too silly, even for Raimi), but that's pretty much been a staple of his ever since Army of Darkness. The first movie did a great job establishing the character of Peter Parker and his moral foundations, while the second took things to an even greater, more epic level by showing us the problems he would face wielding dual identities as both Peter and Spider-Man. But somewhere along the line, there was a falling out between Raimi and Sony Pictures, which is reflected a bit in the way Spider-Man 3 turned out. Eventually, they wanted to do a 4th film together, but Sony really pushed Venom, Raimi wanted to do Sandman, and the film ended up over-stuffed with villains, the writing got sloppy, Peter Parker turned emo, and here we are with a reboot just 5 years later.

So how do things pan out for The Amazing Spider-Man? To start, I'm sad to say I've yet to see director Marc Webb's only other major motion picture, (500) Days of Summer. I hear it's a phenomenal romantic comedy that's highly regarded by many a movie-goer, and I'm sure a lot of what he achieved in that influenced the way the drama and romance are depicted in this new take on the Spider-Man franchise. That being said, even with this being the only exposure I've had to Webb as a film-maker, I was pleasantly surprised at the way things turned out.

The story begins with a young Peter Parker playing hide and seek with his father. In looking for his father, Peter makes his way into the study only to see that it was burglarized by someone. Fearing for his son's safety, he takes him to his brother, Ben (Martin Sheen), to take care of him for the time being. Years pass until Peter (Andrew Garfield) is 18, and we're left with the mystery of what secret his father was hiding in the first place. Being the sort of scientific whiz kid that he is, Peter's curiosity eventually ends him up at the research facilities of one Dr. Curt Conners (Rhys Ifans), who worked with his father years ago to develop a kind of method for genetic splicing that would allow the combining of DNA between different species. But upon stumbling into a particular room filled with their genetically-enhanced spiders, Peter is bitten by one, only to discover a power that would change his life forever.

First and foremost, my favorite aspect of the film is its art direction. After seeing the trailer, I thought this would have a slightly darker and more realistic/gritty feel to it, which it does. The color scheme isn't nearly as vibrant as what Raimi did, and is, instead, more bold with a lot of dark colors, a little more black, some dimmer lighting, and even takes into consideration the fact that as a high school student, Peter Parker (for the most part) only goes out as Spider-Man at night. Because of this, it definitely gives the whole ""masked vigilante"" persona a greater sense of intrigue, mystique, and even a kind of nocturnal elegance.

Secondly, I love what they did with Spider-Man's costume. As I mentioned about Raimi's trilogy having more of a comic book feel, the spandex suit only made it seem even more campy. Here, they decide to opt for a mesh material that allows for more detail to be viewed in the weaving that, in my opinion, looks much more practical and stylish for the overall look of Spidey. I also like the eye pieces of the mask, as the practicality of those make even more sense when you see how he makes them in the movie itself. Color-wise, it appears to be slightly darker, but the material itself lends to a more shiny look for when he's out at night (which also makes it easier to see him). When the eventual special features on the Blu-ray come out and depending on how they explain the design of the costume and whether or not they CG'd certain sequences, I'll reserve a full analysis for then, but I'm happy with the way it turned out, for now.

And speaking of CG, I was ecstatic with the way they handled the action. One of the things that really stuck out to me in the trailer was how Peter/Spidey did a lot of actual ground-based stunt work. Suffice it to say, a lot of the Spidey-action in the Raimi trilogy tends to be largely computer-generated. I can understand stuff like web-slinging across city streets from building to building or getting thrown 30 feet into a wall at high velocities, because why go through the trouble of rigging all that stuff up or getting someone hurt? It's the physical combat sequences that truly impress me. For any of you video game fans out there that have played any Capcom iteration of Spider-Man in any of their fighting franchises, it should go without question that Spidey's quick, agile, physical prowess is displayed to perfection. Aside from the obvious fights with The Lizard that would've been too difficult to stage physically, the parkour-esque running around on walls, the acrobatic flips and mid-air twists, and even the way he slinged his arms and shot his webbing felt a lot more in-tune with the character.

As for the actual movie, it's definitely a change of pace. Raimi's trilogy was bright, fast, flashy, and exaggerated in his own quirky way, which I like. Webb's reboot, however, has more of a subtle, understated buildup to it. Written by James Vanderbilt (who did a marvelous job in David Fincher's Zodiac), the plot has a very methodical approach to the way things are revealed. In Raimi's first film, Peter got his powers and became Spider-Man in about 20-30 minutes. Here, Peter doesn't even think up the idea for a costume till almost 40-45 minutes. Instead, they use the preceding time to thoroughly develop a little bit of everyone, mainly: Peter, Gwen Stacy, and Dr. Conners. It also spends a good amount of time creating chemistry for Peter and Gwen as romantic interests, exposing Peter's knack for science, and, of course, showing us Uncle Ben with his words on the importance of responsibility. I've only seen Garfield in The Social Network, but he showed a lot of potential, and even more so as the new Peter Parker. His portrayal is considerably less peppy than Tobey McGuire's, but I feel he takes more initiative and has an even more pronounced screen presence when he's in the suit. Emma Stone as Gwen is just as charming as her other roles. Compared to the more lovey-dovey atmosphere that developed in the Raimi's franchise, I feel Stone's performance adds a different kind of sentiment that makes the whole relationship feel more natural, even cutesy at times. Rhys Ifans as Dr. Conners is good for what he's given, as is Martin Sheen. My biggest gripe, though, is Sally Fields as Aunt May. I've always liked Aunt May for what she stood for: Peter's moral authority and voice of guidance, but her character gets very little, if any, relevant moments to truly shine. I'm hoping they fix that in the sequels. Or if they opt not to focus on her wisdom, to at least give her as little screen time as possible, as I really don't want to see either the talent of Fields or the character of Aunt May go to waste.

By the way, I saw this in 3D, and yes it is a native 3D film. In fact, it's the first-ever superhero movie to be entirely filmed in the format. Hooray for a non-conversion, finally. There's not a whole lot of 3D effect at first, as the beginning just doesn't lend itself to a whole lot of 3D immersion. Many of the shots either take place around a high school campus or in small housing sets. But boy, does it kick in after Peter becomes Spider-Man. Probably the most notable sequence of the 3D presentation is the first-person swing-views. When Peter is swinging across the city, it's absolutely breathtaking. It's as if you're right there being Spider-Man yourself running all over the place without any kind of boundary. Scenic shots over New York also look pretty outstanding, despite how dark it is. Because the buildings are so tall and everything on ground-level is so small in comparison, you really get a sense of scale for things. Field of depth is especially great in action sequences, with web shots and web traps taking the most precedence. My favorite scene is when Spider-Man is in the sewers laying web wires across all the drain tunnels to catch where The Lizard is hiding. Not only do the webs have an incredible amount of parallax for the 3D-pop effect, but the pose he strikes in waiting looks pretty cool, too. Definitely give this a 3D viewing if you can.

Musically, as iconic as Danny Elfman's Spider-Man theme has been for pretty much the last decade, composer James Horner makes an excellent attempt at creating his own feel for this new adaptation. The score itself has a little bit of an Avatar feel to it, with a few inserts of a choral voice here and there, only minus the tribal vibe. It's a score that, much like the movie itself, is subtle and understated, but has the ability to really engage itself when the action picks up. Some of the more upbeat pieces derive a very faint resonance of the percussions Elfman used in his theme, but it's at a different enough tempo and composed with so many other motifs and instruments that it can definitely stand on its own. Much like any reboot, though, you just have to get used to it (though I had absolutely no problem when Batman transitioned from Elfman to Hans Zimmer; then again, it is Hans Zimmer). I will say, however, that as much as I love Elfman's main theme, I'd say the overall work by Horner for the rest of the film works slightly better to create more various moods. But again, both franchises have vastly different tones, as should be apparent by the visuals, storytelling, and what you hear in this score.

Overall, I like this movie a lot. Some of the plot elements are similar between the two, but the general tone of each has their own ups and downs. The transition wasn't quite as dark and poetic as, say, Tim Burton's Batman films to Christopher Nolan's, but considering how disappointed I was with Raimi's 3rd film, this is a very welcome and refreshing entry to the Spider-Man mythos. One can only hope that the eventual trilogy for this iteration can keep up the good work, giving us a great balance of character development, empathy, and fast-paced action. I'm really looking forward to when this hits Blu-ray for all the special features.

4423583,5,B004LWZWFQ,"""With great power comes great responsibility. And emotional angst. And years of questioning your own decisions. And occasionally calling the whole superhero thing quits, only to reconsider that decision. Did I mention the angst?"" ~ Peter Parker

Well, a decade after the last Spider-Man trilogy of films by Sam Raimi began, and five years after the last of those films, along comes The Amazing Spider-Man, a reboot of the film franchise returning Peter Parker to the beginning again with a new cast, a new director, and all in 3D if you're not careful which screening you're walking into (don't go into the 3D screening, okay? Well, don't blame me if your stomach does that whole spinning in circles thing; I did warn you). It seems obvious that I'd go see this film, particularly because I'm a fan of the character. Before I get started though, I'd just like to get one thing out of the way.

I want to track down the imbecile who coined the term reboot. I want them dead. Sleeping with the fish. Rubbed out, knocked off, encased in cement, congressionally investigated. Same goes for their family, their friends, their acquaintances. Their pets can go in peace; we can't hold the idiocy of humans against the pets, but seriously... I really, really, really, really hate the word reboot. Hate, hate, hate it. Did I mention I hate it?

Okay. Got that out of my system. Shall we begin?

The film by director Marc Webb retells the origin story of Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield), an outsider in high school. His parents leave him with his aunt May and Uncle Ben (Sally Field and Martin Sheen), vanishing when he's a child. He's a smart kid, trying to live up to the example of his aunt and uncle, who are, after all, inherently decent people (though younger than I'd picture the characters, in fact). Peter winds up at OsCorp labs one day, where his life is altered forever by the bite of a certain spider, which of course infects him and grants him the powers he'll soon be known by. He also crosses paths with Doctor Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans), a scientist working for the unseen Norman Osborn (a big bad in the comics universe who's otherwise known on a bad day as the Green Goblin). Osborn, it seems, is dying, and Connors (seen in the Raimi trilogy as one of Peter's professors, and played by Dylan Baker) is working on a cure.

Peter gets used to his powers, making a mistake that inadvertantly leads to the death of his uncle, which as any comics fan will tell you becomes the central motivating factor for the rest of his life. He becomes Spider-Man as atonement, becoming involved with a classmate, Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), meeting her father George, a police captain (Denis Leary). Connors meanwhile makes himself a test subject in his own work, and as usually happens in these things, it goes wrong. He becomes a human-reptilian hybrid monster otherwise known as the Lizard (one of the other big bads in the comics universe) and starts wrecking havoc. Out of this, of course, two opposing forces must collide.

The new film works fairly well. Webb, whose previous work is really based on a character drama, 500 Days of Summer does his best work in terms of character dynamics in the film. Fortunately that's where the emphasis of the film is, and special effects are secondary. The action sequences and set pieces are hampered slightly- but only because we're reminded of the Raimi films. The CGI work from the first of those films was underdeveloped, so we were never really convinced that this was more than a CGI Spidey swinging through the streets at times- when the high wire work wasn't practical, that is- but that was rectified in time for the second film, which was the best of the trilogy, and featured the best action sequences. Comparing that one to this film, the action sequences here don't match up in quality, but it's a minor quibble. The CGI looks believable, which is required in a film like this, and the high wire style of work that Garfield takes part in blends in well with the CGI aspects. The look of Spidey is favourable; the costume is slightly modified from the Raimi films, which tend to be even closer to the comics version, but the modifications are small ones. And it's a wise decision that Peter designs artificial webshooters, a long time comics standard that was ignored in the Raimi trilogy in favour of organic webbing.

Now to the cast. Garfield has more of a wisecracking sensibility about him than Tobey Maguire's take on the character in the previous films. He looks young enough to pass for the character (though they'd better move him up to college next time out). He plays the character properly, I think, someone on an emotional arc that revolves around the sense of responsibility that's so integral to the role. And he really looks the part. Emma Stone is a good Gwen Stacy, and it was right to go with this character instead. She's not the girl next door, but she's very appealing, and the two actors inhabit the roles well.

Denis Leary dials down the usual snark (though I like the snark) for George Stacy, the policeman who's wary of the webbed vigilante. Ifans makes a decent villain; he's been known more for comedy, but he's not as good as Alfred Molina's Doctor Octopus, who was far and away the best villain of the Raimi films. And from the CGI side of things, I thought the look for the Lizard was, well, a bit off. And Sally Field and Martin Sheen convey the decency of the roles, the two guiding forces in Peter's life, with the grace and warmth you'd expect of these two characters.

One big missing part of the film: no J. Jonah Jameson. In the Raimi films, J.K. Simmons played the part of the newspaper publisher and rabid loather of Spider-Man to absolute perfection. Peter in fact isn't working at a newspaper in this film, a situation I hope gets rectified in the sequel. I really, really missed the motormouth of Jolly Jonah, and it seems to me that Spider-Man needs this particular loudmouthed nemesis to bicker with. Just as much as the reverse is true.

And so there will be sequels. The leads have a good chemistry together in this one, the screenwriters give us a story that's focused on character over roller coasters, and the director runs with it. If Webb returns for the sequel, he can polish up his pacing on the action sequences a bit, but he's done well this time out. I look forward to what's to come.",1344384000,5,6387,4.634275618374558

It is one I would have purchased except for (1) thing - the UltraViolet digital copy.  I refuse to buy ANY blu-ray that only comes with an UltraViolet digital copy. I've fought with those things since they day they came out. I spend a lot of time commuting and rely on the digital copies included with the movies I buy so I can enjoy them in transit.  UltraViolet is a nightmare - seperate programs, seperate accounts and the possibility that your ""digital copy"" can be revoked at any time.  I miss the good old days where you simply popped in a disk (or entered a code) and had a copy automatically added to your iTunes account.

As such, I will NOT buy this Blu-ray or any others that do come with the faux UltraViolet digital copy. I'm passing on ""The Amazing Spiderman"" same as I did with ""Sherlock Holmes - A Game of Shadows"" and ""Men in Black 3"".

4423599,5,B004LWZWFQ,"After seeing this movie, the different people I talked to who had seen it either thought this Spiderman movie was better or they thought the Tobey Maguire Spiderman movies were better.  Truthfully, in my own opinion, at least comparing the first Tobey Maguire film and then this film, I enjoyed them both probably about equally as well.  I favor this one maybe a small bit more considering that Marvel Studios was actually behind it and it was perhaps maybe a little bit more intuned with the comics, but beyond that I honestly enjoyed both renditions close to about as much.  We'll see what happens when they release another Amazing Spiderman film down the line, but as for now that's how I view it.  Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire both play nerd well and pulled off this role fantastically I thought, and the cast in both were great.  It was kind of refreshing to see Sally Field again, in her role as Aunt May...I don't remember having seen her in a good movie in a while, (I'm sure she's been in some stuff overtime, but just stuff maybe I hadn't seen), and I also rather enjoyed Martin Sheen as Uncle Ben, Emma Stone as Gwen Stacey, Dennis Leary as the police commisioner/Gwen Stacey's father, and Rhys Ifans as Dr. Connors.

  I have not seen this film. But as an original Merry Marvel Marcher I am pretty sure I will have a good time with it. The Rammi films have all been true enough to the character and concept that the series has been among the most enjoyable of the Marvel features. No surprise in that Spiderman is the most successful of the entire Marvel super hero pantheon.
  Hence,a top rating on an unseen film.

  This is WARNING to all readers about the over written, first review on this page. Probably too late, right? None the less,future writers, take this as literary advise on courtesy if nothing else.

  SPOILER ALERT!!!!  DO NOT BLINDLY READ THE OPENING REVIEW IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE.
  After the First paragraph, skip to the Last paragraph. Everything in between has very little to say other than to expound on all the major plot points of the movie. Granted, comic book movie stories lack the subtle twists and turns of a Hitchcock or an Agatha Christi. But giving a blow by blow account of every major act in the film is not a review. At best, it is only an expo on the story line. Nothing more.
  So, for better or worse, if all a writer can do is say "" I have seen this movie! This is what happened in it, start to finish. And this is what I think of each of these actions"", well, shut up! That is not a review in any sense. It is a Critique, something to be read AFTER seeing the film. Not Before!
  A good writer can address the qualities of a film without simply telling the story line. In fact, that is the real function of a review! To give insight into the merits of a given film. Not to retell the story.
  I will never forget the experience of having a ""friend"" who had read the book tell me that Darth Vader is Luke's father the day before the film's premier. I said nothing to the rest of my family. But for me, the dramatic impact was completely ruined by one inconsiderate person!

  So, a note to all you blabber mouths out there. Put a lid on it until some time after the DVD is released! Or post the label SPOILER ALERT at the heading of your review. Telling everything you have seen in a film is not smart,or clever. It is just lazy,arrogant,shallow,empty exposition. It is the kind of thing people write when they really don't have anything original to say. Do us all a favor. This is not some school assignment where you have pages to fill. If you cannot do any better than simply retelling the story,leave your keyboard alone! We want to SEE the movie for it's own sake. Not have the experience cluttered up with unwelcome information. How many people would watch a whole baseball game if they knew who won? Get my point yet?
  There are people who do NOT need their minds made up for them!

4423601,4,B004LWZWFQ,I really liked this movie (saw it twice in theaters) It was funny and enjoyable. I know its not Spiderman 4 or Tobey Maguire but honestly i don't pay attention to those things like other people do. Its just like Mark Ruffalo and Edward Norton in the avengers. Andrew nailed the role both in Peter and Spiderman and i cant wait for Spiderman 2. Yea I know its a reboot but if they made spiderman fight green goblin again than yea i don't think i would like it but it isn't this time its the lizard. Im going to buy this movie when it comes out.,1344038400,4,543,4.132075471698113
4423602,4,B004LWZWFQ,"I'm not going to rain on ""The Amazing Spider-Man's"" parade. I'm just going to sprinkle a little.

Sam Raimi's Spider-Man franchise, save for the disappointing ""Spider-Man 3"" ('07), has produced the best Spider-Man films to date. That's not to say that this new entry, taken on it's own terms, is a bad motion picture. Actually, it's a pretty good film, despite the 3-D version that detracts from an excellent movie going experience.

See it in 2-D. You'll thank me later.

How so?

There are many scenes where the peripheral edges of the picture are slightly out of focus, and I found myself squinting trying to re-focus the picture instead of paying attention to the storyline. I'm not convinced that the 3-D process has been perfected - certainly not enough for the extra ticket price they're asking and the hassle of wearing goofy glasses. In addition, there were only one or two scenes were flying objects seemed to be actually coming at the audience. Is it worth the extra money, you make the call.

But with 3-D aside, Andrew Garfield takes over the web-slinging chores from Toby Maguire in this ambitious remake or re-imaging of ""Spider-Man"" ('02). Garfield is as nerdy and as likable as Maguire, which raises the question, why not continue the story where Raimi left off instead of a reboot?

Director Marc Webb spends the first hour going over Spider-Man's origins. Admittedly, Webb's version is more fleshed out than Raimi's, as it explores how Peter Parker (Garfield) lost his parents and ended up living with his Aunt May (Sally Field) and Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen). However, most of Spider-Man's origins are familiar territory. So again, why the reboot?

Once the movie gets going, Peter discovers an old briefcase hidden in his Uncle Ben's basement belonging to his father. The mysterious briefcase yields documents revealing that Peter's father, a brilliant scientist, was working with Dr. Connors (Rhys Ifans), another brilliant scientist, on cross-species interbreeding at Oscorp. (Spidey fans know that Oscorp is own by Norman Osborn, aka the Green Goblin, who doesn't make an appearance in this film. By the by, don't look for J. Jonah Jameson or the Daily Bugle either.)

Peter slips in with a tour of Oscorp in the hopes of meeting Dr. Connors, who is obsessed with injecting himself with lizard genes that will supposedly regenerate his missing right arm. It is there that Peter is bitten by a radioactive spider, and Dr. Connors injects himself with lizard juice, thus natural enemies are born.

As the Lizard, Connors terrorizes New York City and Spider-Man gets a chance to perform his feats of daring do - swinging from buildings, rescuing kids from burning cars and saving ladies in distress - namely his love interest Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). Meanwhile, Gwen's father, police chief Stacy (Denis Leary) relentlessly pursues Spidey. The third act ends with Spidey battling the Lizard atop Oscorp Tower.

To its credit ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a more serious film (as comic books go) than the Raimi offerings. However, the Raimi films were sprinkled with just enough camp and the occasional wink and a nod to the 1967 Saturday morning cartoon that made them enduring. Theses elements are sorely missed from Webb's version. However, hard-core Spidey fans will not be disappointed. It also bears mentioning: ""Stay in your seat until the credits are over, as with all recent Marvel films there's a hint to a possible sequel.",1343952000,6,3448,5.00174520069808
4423603,5,B004LWZWFQ,"Wondering whether or not to take your tween or teen to see this PG-13-rated film? Take a look at our 15-year-old KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, Raven Devanney's review:
The Amazing Spider Man starring Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone definitely lives up to its title because it is truly amazing. I was excepting this film to be an add on to the most recent Spider Man series, but it was a completely different film that started at the beginning of Spider Man's journey. Of course, Peter Parker played by Andrew Garfield was bit by a genetically modified spider and transforms into Spider Man.  His uncle Ben dies and that's all the same in the past films about this spandex-sporting hero, but instead of falling for his typical love interest, MJ, Peter falls for Gwen Stacy played by Emma Stone. And there is no Green Goblin in this film, but instead a new villain for Spider Man to face.
I loved this movie! The special effects were phenomenal, especially in 3D. I loved Andrew Garfield as the part of Peter Parker because he did a fantastic job portraying him and he and Emma Stone have such great chemistry which really showed in their characters. My favorite scene is when peter is transforming into Spider Man because his aunt and uncle have no idea what's wrong with him and it's so funny. In fact, this whole film is filled with comedy and action. My favorite character would have to be Gwen Stacy played by Emma stone because I really admire her and she did a wonderful job playing this role.
I think something that is very different about this film is that it seems that the target audience is just teens, where as in the past Spider Man movies the main audience was teens and adults. Overall I give the Amazing Spider Man 5 out of 5 stars because it was amazing and I want to see it over and over again. I can't wait for the sequel to come out, so go catch it in a theater near you!",1343952000,4,1884,4.4293948126801155
4423604,2,B004LWZWFQ,"Columbia Pictures has three franchises to its name: James Bond, Men in Black, and Spider-Man. After the chilly reception that the last Bond film got and the underwhelming performance of MIB III, the next best thing was rebooting the Spider-Man franchise (after only 10 years since the first film) by going with completely new actors, a VERY new director and a new story idea of telling the ""untold"" story of Peter Parker.

Sadly, aside from this film's extremely strong and fun first act, the film never regains that same sort of urgency and instead fabricates inorganic momentum in order to set up a finale that feels similarly inorganic and doesn't help to extend the mythology of Spider-Man that we're promised from the film's outset.

Director Marc Webb, whose only previous film credit is the extremely quirky and hip anti-rom-com (500) DAYS OF SUMMER, and his extremely talented cast (Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker, Emma Stone sporting her natural blonde hair as Gwen Stacy, Rhys Ifans as Curt Connors, Denis Leary as Capt. George Stacy, Martin Sheen as Uncle Ben and Sally Field as Aunt May) should have more than enough charisma and gravitas to keep momentum going along during the film, but the problem lays not with the cast but with Webb and this film's writers. James Vanderbilt (THE RUNDOWN, ZODIAC), Oscar winner Alvin Sargent (ORDINARY PEOPLE, the last two of Sam Raimi's SPIDER-MAN trilogy), and Steve Kloves (every HARRY POTTER film except GOBLET OF FIRE) have taken what should be a rather long period of time for all of the major events that happen in this film and condense them all to the passage of weeks, not months or even longer. It gives the film and the characters no room to breathe and grow and therefore everything past that first act rings false and when it should pick up momentum again, you've been completely taken out of that exhuberance you were feeling and there's nothing that makes you really look forward to the inevitable final confrontation between Spider-Man and The Lizard, who is the villain of this film. These are all really excellent writers, too, which just makes this sadder.

Although despite the clumsy forced dialogue, the extremely clunky second act, the poor Lizard effects (it just doesn't look good, particularly in the facial area), an extremely telegraphed finale (""Oh, look. I'm going to casually show you something as a throw-away in the first act and of course this is going to be the MacGuffin in the climax!""), and the incredibly forced romance between Peter and Gwen, there is something worse.

The aesthetic of this film is FAR too dark. Spider-Man, classically, does a good deal of fighting and web-swinging in well-lit and sunny areas. He's a character that is about the light. He's not Batman. He's not a ""dark"" hero, no matter how badly this film wants him to be, because most of this film is set at night or in the dark. I hear the arguments and I get it; sewers are dark and when it's dark out, there's more crime, but this is not a real world. Marc Webb could have challenged himself to distinguish himself as a visual filmmaker as he did in (500) DAYS OF SUMMER rather than doing a very paint-by-numbers summer big-budget action extravaganza.

There are other nit-picky things that are more fan-oriented (Where's the Daily Bugle? Where's J. Jonah Jameson? These are essential characters of Peter's formative hero years...) but as I stated, I understand that they're trying to tell a different story than Sam Raimi's first film, but while this film should stand on its own as a separate entity than Raimi's trilogy, it still has to beg comparison and controversy.

But oddly enough, while trying to tell a very different story, they end up telling one that is almost virtually identical to Raimi's first chapter. This film hits almost the same exact story beats that Raimi's film did. It tries so hard to distinguish itself from that film that it morphs into almost the exact same film. And what's more upsetting is that while this is a much better cast on paper (both Maguire and Garfield are incredibly talented actors but Garfield is much more engaging rather than the overly emotional Maguire, and Emma Stone is far and away more charming and demands more immediate screen presence than Kirsten Dunst), Raimi was able to encapsulate almost all of the main elements of Peter Parker's life to a much more effective, if occasionally clumsy and stale, debut Spider-Man film.

And there is a point in this film where I felt like saying, ""Okay, is there anyone in New York City who DOESN'T know Spider-Man's secret identity?"" I get it; we like to see our masked characters bleed and emote, but this was just too much mask removal.

There's a scene at the very end where Peter is sitting in his high school English class, and the teacher is talking about historically there are only about ten different stories that can be told, but the truth is there is only one story that needs to be told... ""Who am I?"", which is an obvious attempt at justifying this film's existence and also a wannabe-clever dig at the people who are out there constantly griping about Hollywood's lack of originality. I thought that this moment was very telling because it is trying to side-step a good portion of its target audience, and also because it consciously knows that it's a blatant attempt to try and get the cash.

My advice for the obvious sequel: New director who knows his way around a sizable budget, one or at the maximum two writers who are partners; and as King Claudius says, ""Give me some light!"", because there was something rotten in the state of New York, and Spider-Man should be there to save the DAY, and not take back the night.",1343692800,5,5702,4.768996960486322

4423650,3,B004LWZWFQ,"Was another Spider-Man film really necessary? ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" had to distinguish itself from the three Spider-Man films that went before, still in recent memory. The answer of course is to simply reboot the franchise, just as Christopher Nolan's Batman was a reboot of Tim Burton's whimsical take on the iconic character.

Let's get a few things straight: Andrew Garfield makes for an excellent Peter Parker. He's moody, sarcastic, and acrobatic in a way that's believable - more skater punk than class nerd, but smart enough to make us believe he could create his own wristwatch web slingers. Martin Sheen is excellent as his crotchety but wise Uncle Ben. But Emma Stone's husky-voiced presence makes Gwen Stacey more sexy high school teacher than high school crush; Dennis Leary still echoes his role as a firefighter from Rescue Me; and Rhys Ifans blathers on unconvincingly as Dr. Curt Connors about trans-species DNA.

And that's part of the problem. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" wants the audience to take this incarnation more seriously as a grim version of the iconic hero, but regularly throws comic book logic at us and expects us to swallow it. The script goes to great lengths to justify Parker's access to his web slingers, going so far as inserting a flickering red special effect to remind us that its technology firing the sticky strands...until the artists forget to include it in every other scene. THE AMAZING SPOILER MAN: When a terrorist threatens to detonate a dirty bomb over the city, we're expected to believe that only the police and a few crane operators will step up to handle the crisis.

The other problem is that the film lacks a sense of place. Those of us born in New York City know that much of this movie wasn't filmed there (it was mostly filmed in Los Angeles). Arch-henchman Dr. Rajit Ratha (Irrfan Khan) who drives Connors over the edge literally disappears with his own version of the mystery serum in his clutches, never to be mentioned again - not even after the credits. But perhaps the least forgivable is that Parker can swing from a dunk in sewage straight to his girlfriend's bedroom with nary a mention that he stinks.

Even Uncle Ben's speech has been muddled and filtered so that he never issues his ""with great power comes great responsibility"" phrase. Instead Parker gets chastised about breaking a basketball backboard (""Feels good, doesn't it?"") and a lecture about apologizing to Aunt May.

Spider-Man himself is perfectly executed onscreen -- never once is there a moment where he seems like a CGI-effect, a rare feat. But Spider Man's wisecracks are more sarcastic teenager snarks and this more realistic version is much less acrobatic. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" goes to great lengths to demonstrate how powerful Spidey's hands can stick to an object, but then never explains if the power extends to his feet or how he can climb walls through clothing.

Although it may be unfair, the best comparison for a reboot of this magnitude is ""Batman Begins."" ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" never quite achieves that level of greatness. This isn't a bad film, but it's not nearly as amazing as the original.",1342915200,10,3154,4.930320150659134

""i don't want to be known as spider-man all my life"" well then toby don't play iconic characters if you don't want to be known as them. toby probably wasn't even going to be spider-man if even sam raimi directed number four. another thing they did right in this movie was spider-man's sarcasim. spider-man is a sarcastic jerk to the bad guys. which they did not have to much in the others. i like toby mcguire but i think andrew garfield did a little better and i hope he does not complain about beging spider-man this is jump starting his career. and i hope he dosen't fall out of beging the character. twords the end of the film there is a slight hint that they might do green goblin again and if they do please have william defoe play him he was an excellent green goblin. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do. p.s. stan lee's cameo in this movie was the best out of all his cameo's so far",1342569600,2,2313,4.130820399113082

I'm guessing my primary beef with it is that we've no longer got Tobey Maguire as the lead. I became so attached to the cast from the other three films that I had a tough time accepting any other face behind the mask (not to mention, my heart sank when I discovered that John Malkovich would've had a central role in Spiderman 4). Now, I've been told that Andrew Garfield's take on Spidey was a lot more true to the awkward nature of comic-book Spiderman. In that regard, he nailed the Peter Parker personality dead-on. Unfortunately, mega-awkward Spidey just isn't all that likable. Garfield's Spiderman was a stuttery pretty boy who could barely speak, let alone conjure the illusion that there was any depth whatsoever to his personality. At times I was genuinely puzzled by how god-awful his acting was coming across. If not for the adorable charm of Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy, or the occasionally interesting antics of Dr. Connors, a one-star rating would probably be more fitting. The action was lacking, the acting was hollow, and the lines were forgettable. At the end of the day, I was semi-entertained.

4423684,5,B004LWZWFQ,"As you've heard, this movie starts the movie incarnation of Spider-Man from scratch.  Peter Parker's parents have apparently been killed in a plane crash, so he has been raised by his Uncle Ben and Aunt May.  As a high school student, he's bitten by a genetically engineered (instead of radioactive) spider and acquires super-strength, super-stickiness, enhanced senses (and possibly a ""Spidey-sense"").  He buys ""biocable"" (produced by the spiders) from Oscorp (run by Norman Osborn) and invents a webshooter.  Curt Connors, a scientist of Oscorp, dreams of discovering a way to regenerate his missing arm via genetic engineering.  Meanwhile, Peter starts a relationship with Gwen Stacy, a student in his high school that he's been attracted to.  The plot continues...

The actors do a great job.  Andrew Garfield, (Peter) a 27 year old Brit, had me completely convinced he was a teenage American high school student.  Emma Stone (Gwen) seemed just a little too mature to be in high school, but she's such a delight that I didn't care.  Martin Sheen, well, for some reason I kept staring at his teeth.

My rear end had a problem with the length of the movie, but my mind didn't.  I may have preferred for him to become Spider-Man sooner, but looking back at the film, I can't think of any scene that I would have cut.

4423685,4,B004LWZWFQ,"It appears audiences have gotten too hip to buy into the ""radioactive spider"" bite scenario, so the writers opted for a gene splicing spider bite. The film incorporates many of the original Spider-man ideas, people, and scenes, while maintaining a certain amount of originality. The plot of the film has already been compromised (40 year anniversary of first publication), so there is no need for me to dwell on it.

3D holograms are used in the film, and of course Spider-man flies directly at your head. If you have the wallet and opportunity, I would suggest the 3D version.

In all honesty I preferred Toby McGuire to Andrew Garfield as Spider-man. That is not to say Andrew did a bad job, he didn't. The part was written different. I am a big fan of Emma Stone (Gwen Stacy), who has been in High School going on 6 years now. She can play the hottie and the nerd both better than most actresses. But what this film didn't have was that one defining moment that will forever be played in movie pop culture history and that was ""The Kiss"" which drove women into the theater. Yes, Emma and Andrew swap spit, but it wasn't the same as that upside down, remove the mask, just rescued me moment.

Denis Leary, who typically plays an angry comic, delivers in his role as Captain Stacy. Good action. For a 2 hour plus movie, it moves rather quickly.

The risk can be a marginal failure as in Superman Returns. Not so here.

Young Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) lives with his Aunt May (Sally Field) and Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) after his parents abandoned him as a child.  Now an awkward, bullied high school student, he has a crush on cute blonde, Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), who has an authoritarian father (Denis Leary).  Upon discovering his dad's old files, Peter seeks out his father's former colleague, Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans), who is researching the regenerative, healing capabilities of reptiles in his lab at Oscorp.  Parker snoops around the lab and gets bitten by a genetically enhanced spider, and soon he begins to develop superhuman strength, agility, reflexes, and the ability to crawl on walls as well as shoot a powerful web.  His self absorption sets in motion events that will exact personal loss.  Guilt stricken, he becomes a masked avenger, catching criminals much to the chagrin of the police who think he is a vigilante.  Meanwhile, a desperate Connors is forced to test a serum on himself which transforms him into the Lizard who menaces the city streets and threatens to infect the entire population with the chemical. As Spiderman confronts The Lizard in a grand battle, the fate of the city including Gwen hangs in the balance.

How does this compare to the previous Spiderman?  It's nearly as good but with a different take and still retains the essential ingredients that made the former film a standout.  The film always keeps the focus on the relationships between Peter and Gwen and Peter and his family.  Those grounded bonds form the soul of the film and make the film a more enriching experience.  There is no Mary Jane Watson or J. Jonah Jameson yet.

The filmmakers, director Marc Webb (500 Days of Summer) and screenwriters James Vanderbilt (Zodiac), Alvin Sargent (Ordinary People), and Steve Kloves (Harry Potter series) made the smart choice of starting with a younger version of Peter Parker, perfectly embodied by Garfield, whose adolescence and psychology are part of a fully realized character.  Garfield and Stone make an adorable couple and display good chemistry that is endearing.  Fields and Sheen are quite effective as Peter's guardians and the screen lights up whenever they appear.  Leary, proving he can do drama as well as comedy, makes the most of his role as Stacy's dad who is a police captain in conflict over the rogue Spiderman.  Marvel legend Stan ""the Man"" Lee has another amusing cameo.

Although bereft with open ended plot points by film's end (likely to be resolved in future sequels), there are a couple of nice touches that lift this film above most standard comic book adaptations.  In one particularly affecting scene, a construction worker rallies a team of crane operators to assist Spiderman, whose earlier courageous act now pays timely dividends.  During the rousing climax, Spiderman is rescued when an unlikely savior intercedes.  Even Connors' Lizard is not your stereotypic villain and figures in a surprising and unexpected act at film's end.

Special effects were pretty good in the older Spiderman, but they are even better here especially in the trademark web swinging between skyscrapers. If the musical score sounds like a cross between A Beautiful Mind and Aliens, it's because James Horner does the honors on each film.

Despite the odds, what is `amazing' is that lightning has struck twice for the franchise. The Amazing Spider-Man is a familiar yet refreshing take on a formula that works quite well here.  And yes, stay for the end credits which reveal a teaser for the next film.",1342224000,3,4190,5.001440922190202
4423688,5,B004LWZWFQ,"I'll be honest, I was not a big fan of the original trilogy. The first film was good, but lacked a good, strong story. The second one delved too much into the emotional angst, and this one proved why Tobey Maguire, a good actor, was miscast as Peter Parker. The third one, which could have moved past the emotional angst to tell a truly heroic tale, delved even further into emotional angst, and was without a doubt the worst superhero flick ever. So, even though the idea of a reboot of the franchise was questionable, the filmmakers here have gone back to the origin story, but have also crafted a strong, character-driven story that has some of the emotional complexities of Spider-man, but is also fun, exciting, and downright funny at times as well.

Andrew Garfield proves himself every bit superior to Tobey Maquire as Peter Parker. His character is marred by tragedy, and he does have a hint of the tragic figure to him, but he also brings a good amount of strength and humor to the role, making his take on the character the definitive film version of Spidey. A strong supporting cast, including Martin Sheen and Sally Field as Uncle Ben and Aunt May, deliver solid, believable performances as well. Rhys Ifans proves to be a strong villain, and Emma Stone is both beautiful and talented as Gwen Stacy, Parker's love interest.

The action and visual effects are brilliant. The story does come off as predictable from time to time, but the terrific performances and action scenes make up for some of the weaker points in the story. This is, without a doubt, the best Spider-man film so far, and bodes well for the future of the franchise. If you enjoy the Marvel brand of superhero films, then you'll surely enjoy ""The Amazing Spider-man.""

Grade: A-",1342137600,10,1758,4.68284789644013
4423689,5,B004LWZWFQ,"Totally enjoyed this new version and especially Andrew Garfield. He brought so much more honesty to the character that I could actually feel for him that I didn't much of anything for the last three. I felt that there was enough character development of each of the characters that when they each went through their respective trials and tribulations I sympathized with them as people rather than just actors portraying others. Peter was just truly nerdy enough to be believable and I know a lot of nerds just like that. I enjoyed the balance of the movie of character development to action to drama and will look forward to the next movie. I am surprised at the amount of people that did not enjoy this incarnation, I would recommend this whole-heartedly.",1342137600,9,756,4.778625954198473
4423690,1,B004LWZWFQ,"(FYI: Some spoilers) Wow. Just wow. I am still just shaking my head about watching this film last night. I am so ecstatic, that I kept my promise to myself, to not go to the theaters to watch this reboot, but to watch it online for free! If I would have paid for this junk, I would have demanded my money back! A guy at work, was just raving how this film, was soooo much better than the first three combined. I was like yeah right! I gonna rip him a new one, when I see him tomorrow at work.

""The Amazing Spider-Man"" was just depressing. I did not laugh until the 27 minute mark of the film.  The story was just boring, slow and annoying. The way that Uncle Ben died was just ridiculous. I really felt nothing for any of these characters. Personally, if they all would have got hit, with a mack truck in this film, I would not have shed a tear for any of them! Andrew Garfield's performance is nowhere near Toby McGuire's outstanding performances from the previous films. Garfield's performance of Spider-Man, seem more like a teenage girl, than a teenage boy. Emma Stone's Stacey Gwen character seem tougher to me. Should it not be the other way around!?!? The graphics for The Lizard, look like someone just passed their final exam from a Graphics Design class in college. The Lizard just looked horrible!!! Last, but not least, the stupid crane scenes toward the end of the movie, were just plain idiotic. ""Gee guys Spider-Man needs help to reach the Oscorp building. Let's help him with the cranes"" (I'm paraphrasing here).

My gosh, after watching this mess, I began to think Sony should have just let Sam Raimi do ""Spider-Man 4"". Sony was going to give Raimi creative control for ""Spider-Man 4"", just like they gave him creative control for ""Spider-Man 1"" and ""Spider-Man 2"". ""Spider-Man 3"" was disappointing, because the ""stupid studio executives"" had control.  They were the reasons we had too many villains in ""Spider-Man 3"". Raimi only wanted one villain in ""Spider-Man 4"", which was going to be John Malkovich as The Vulture. But the ""stupid studio executives"" went back on their word of giving Raimi creative control. They wanted to add Anne Hathway as the Black Cat in the story. Raimi went back and forth with the ""stupid studio executives"", but felt he could not get the script to work with two villains. Raimi knew fans were disappointed with the 3 villain concept in ""Spider-Man 3"" and just wanted just one villain. Therefore, he just decided not to do ""Spider-Man 4"".

So in closing, we get this horrible film call ""The Amazing Spider-Man"", instead of a potentially great film in ""Spider-Man 4"", because if the ""stupid studio executives"" would have gave Raimi creative control like the first two films, ""Spider-Man 4"" was going to be stellar! What is really funny, after watching ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" I have decided that I will purchase ""Spider-Man 3"" sometime soon (I already own the first two films), because although Spider-Man 3 was a disappointing film (which is why I did not purchased it in the first place) it blows away ""The Amazing Spider-Man""! Personally, I do not want to give Sony a dime of my money, but I rather support what Sam Raimi and the cast of the first three ""Spider-Man"" films did, which was creating a remarkable, entertaining and FUN trilogy to watch. Ever since I was a kid watching ""Spider-Man"" in the 70's, ""Spider-Man"" always has been about being light-hearted and fun, not this dullness, darkness, idiocy of a movie!!!! Darkness is for Batman people, not Spider-Man. To each his or her own, because their are a lot of folks who liked this film, but this movie is just utter garbage!!! Had to be said, had too!!!!",1342051200,14,3667,4.67906976744186
4423691,2,B004LWZWFQ,"After the incredible success of the ""original"" Spiderman series (now known as ""the Tobey Maguire one""), director Sam Raimi & Sony could not agree on a fourth addition to that franchise.  As such, Sony decided to dump Raimi and reboot the series again despite the very short time frame.  While this movie will almost certainly rack up huge profits at the box office over the summer months, its utter lack of heart and anything original/interesting will eventually become known and be its undoing.

For a basic plot summary, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" reboots the Spiderman franchise with Andrew Garfield as the title character and Emma Stone as Peter Parker's teenage crush Gwen Stacy.  Also along for the ride is Rhys Ifans as a scientist working to perfect inter-species DNA mixing, which of course sets the stage for the battle between Spidey & The Lizard.

There are so many things wrong with this movie that it is actually just easier to go over them in list form:

-The main problem is that the direction from Marc Webb and thus the overall tone of the film is just wrong.  It tries to be a high school drama, action/adventure romp, ""Dark Knight""-style hero film, and even a part goofy comedy all at once.  It fails at all of these aspects because it just doesn't establish an identity.  Whereas ""Dark Knight"" works because it is so visceral and the original Spidey flicks work because they are more playful and light (like reading a comic book versus a graphic novel), this one falls squarely in the ""muddled middle"".
-Andrew Garfield is a great actor, but his character is written so wildly inconsistent that it is literally laughable at times.  There is no believe character progression or development whatsoever.  One minute he is a goofy teenager, the next a brooding soul, and the next a punk, changing between the three for seemingly no reason at all.
-This is too soon after ""Spiderman 3"", plain and simple.  The first 45 minutes are so get tedious because, well, we already saw this stuff not so long ago.  I can completely see what Sony was trying to do, but it just should not have been done.  As previously mentioned, it will make a ton of money (at least at first) but inevitably suck the life out of the franchise.
-Finally, there are also some scenes in this film that will almost make you laugh out loud as to their ridiculousness.  Maguire's Spidey always teetered on the edge of dramatic/campy, but this time it descends into stupidity.  You never know what you are going to get from scene to scene.

The only bright point of the experience: Emma Stone's performance as Gwen.  Despite the fact that she is terribly miscast as a high school student, Stone gives her character at least some charm.  It is more than can be said for anything or anybody else in the movie.

Overall, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" was one of the biggest letdowns I have ever experienced in the cinema.  For me, it is closer to 1.5 stars on the ranking scale.  In a Hollywood era where superhero movies rule right now, this one is a complete and utter dud.",1342051200,8,3048,4.668539325842697
4423692,3,B004LWZWFQ,"I wasn't going to see this junk but I kept watching the trailers.  I figured I would give it a chance more out of curiousity (just to compare to Rami's version).

This movie was entertaining.  I enjoyed it.  It had a cast full of top notch actors.  I did not like Garfield as Peter Parker and it was nothing personal.  I just feel he can not act... and the performance he gave was that of a typical kid today on prescription drug medications!  Mumbled speech, hood constantly over his head and dumb backpack!  That is why I say this movie is like twilight because it relates to the younger generation (who are not true Spiderman fans).  I felt Tobey did a great job as Spidey and a Spiderman movie without him is just not the same.  The other bad casting role was Sally Field.  I am sorry but she is not an Aunt May.  The previous actress was so much better as Aunt May and she even looked like her.  All other actors were phenominal in my opinion.

This Spiderman was an OK movie.  I really did enjoy it but there were a lot of plot holes.  Where is Uncle Ben's killer?  No mention at the end about his continued search?  And the scene with the little lizards running around NYC?  Can someone show me a real living lizard in NY (besides the Bronx zoo)?  And how many times can I watch Uncle Ben get shot?

Nothing beats the original movie with the Green Goblin.  As a New Yorker that lived through 9/11, I remember seeing the movie back in 2002 and something about it touched me in a deep way.  Watching Spidey save a baby from a burning building... swinging around and saving people on the streets of Manhattan.  It was a ground breaking movie (delivered at the right time) and the only movie in my life that I enjoyed watching more than once in the theater.  I felt like I was watching the same movie again just 10 years later with a different actor playing Spiderman that couldn't even act.

Bottom line... this was a pretty good movie considering the garbage out there in the theaters.  I did enjoy it but there were things that really bothered me.  Unfortunately, I can't help but compare this to the original Rami movie which is part of the problem with this movie.  Did we really need a reboot or did we really want to see Spiderman 4?  All we needed was another ""Spiderman 2"" caliber type of movie directed by Rami and Toby as Spiderman featuring the Lizard as the one and only bad guy.  The movie studio would have made even more money if they did this right.

However, I think there is a lot of potential in the sequels of this movie.  Hopefully Garfield will mature more as an actor and get away from this drugged up Peter Parker with a hood and backpack so he won't look like a criminal.  Only time will tell.",1342051200,5,2722,4.3142292490118574
4423693,5,B004LWZWFQ,I like the previous Spiderman very much. However this is a better movie. Less campy BS better plot. And the acting is so much better then the Sam Rami movie. I didn't like the previous Spiderman enough to get it in Blu Ray but I will do so with this one.,1341964800,5,254,4.0
4423724,5,B004LWZWFQ,This movie was thoroughly entertaining and extremely satisfying. It can easily be described as the best movie of the entire Spiderman franchise. Tobey Maguire did a very good job in the Spiderman trilogy but Andrew Garfield has dominated the role of Peter Parker. Andrew and Emma work and fit effortlessly together. Cannot wait for the next installment. One of the top movies of this 2012. This movie IS the summers MUST SEE movie. Nothing but glowing praise.,1341964800,4,459,4.974025974025974
4423725,5,B004LWZWFQ,"""The Amazing Spider-Man' is directed by Marc Webb, who has only directed one film in his career: ""(500) Days of Summer,"" which is an independant romantic comedy. So when I heard that they assigned him as director of the new Spider-Man reboot, I was worried. First of all, he has no experience working with a big budget. Secondly, he has no experience working with action. But given that I loved ""(500) Days of Summer,"" I knew that at least the relationships would be good. So I went into this film expecting nothing more than a well acted film but with cheesey special effects and action.

I am proud to say however that this film exceeded my expectations and is now one of, if not my favorite MARVEL Studio film. 5 years after the disaster of a film, ""Spider-Man 3,"" the studio decided they should forget the Sam Raimi trilogy and move on to a completely new cast, and I can say, well choice.

""The Amazing Spider-Man"" tells basically the same story that was told in 2002's ""Spider-Man,"" but in a fresh, updated, and more involving way. We get to learn about Peter Parker's parents, home life, and his moving into his aunt and uncle's home. There is much more backstory and a much greater performance from Andrew Garfield than Tobey Maguire.

Which brings me to my next point: the performances. All of them are top notch. Andrew Garfield (The Social Network) gives a mesermizing performance as Peter Parker, capturing the essence of the Spider-Man we all loved in the comic books. Another great performance is Emma Stone's (Zombieland) as Gwen Stacey. Garfield and Stone sizzle on screen creating one of the most real teenage relationships I've seen in a long time. Also, Martin Sheen (The Departed) as Uncle Ben, Sally Fields (Forrest Gump) as Aunt May, Rhys Ifans (Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1) as Dr. Curt Conners, and Dennis Learie (FX's ""Rescue Me"") as Captain Stacey, are all great performances.

Next up is the effects and action. The 3D in this was film was fantastic during the action, and the bright colors mixed with the dark night really made me smile throughout this film. There alot of action toward the end and it is all dazzling to the eyes and much better than I anticipated. Very, very good visuals.

All in all, I actually LOVED this movie, much more than I was expecting, and even though ""The Avengers"" is a better movie on a technical scale, I sure enjoyed ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" a heck of a lot more.",1341964800,6,2441,4.654292343387471
4423726,1,B004LWZWFQ,"I was hoping that after the impact of The Dark Knight, we were really gonna start seeing superhero movies as they should be done. Grittier, and bad ass. Specially when they announced they were doing a reboot of Spiderman. The Sam Raimi movies were cool, but a little campy for my taste. I can't believe I'm saying this, but Raimi did it better. The majority of the movie is spent on the tired an overdone rhetoric of ""I've got these powers but I'm sad and confused"". Even my wife said this movie was like Spiderman for girls. And she's totally right. This was just boring. Despite all this, some people did love this movie. I guess opinions are divided. Those who wanted another run of the mill/ done by the numbers spiderman movie, and who have no problem with the movie catering to teenagers, got what they wanted. Those of us who wanted to finally see a take on spiderman in the vein of The Dark Knight, with well written, grown up and unpredictable dialogue, instead of gratuitous eye candy and an emo spiderman were disappointed.

 If you want an in-depth review that I think pretty much sums it up, read the one in the following link. This guy totally nailed it:

4423727,3,B004LWZWFQ,"You know the whole story, or you think you know . . .

Marc Webb's (Coincidence?) adaptation of the uber-popular comic book attempts to revive a franchise that, frankly, hasn't actually died.  Recruiting Andrew Garfield as the star, the plot is more faithful to the source material; Spidey gets his trusty web shooters and his first girl Gwen Stacy (played by Emma Stone), and the script ties in the legacy of Peter Parker's parents with scientist Curt Conner's transformation into the Lizard in a attempt to regrow his right arm.  Biased publisher J. Jonah Jameson and his Daily Bugle newspaper aren't mentioned beyond a front-page headline.  But really, who needs J.J. when you've got Denis Leary as the police chief determined to squash the wall-crawler?  And what Marvel movie would be complete without ""The Man"" himself, Stan Lee, blessing it with a cameo.

While Garfield's witty, yet awkward Peter fits the bill, Tobey Maguire didn't stutter nearly as much.  It is pleasing to see this Peter learning the whole ""power and responsibility"" bit without Uncle Ben spelling it out for him.  Everything else is bundled up in a nice bag of synthetic webbing.  Rather than calling this film as good as the original trilogy (It's less congested than No. 3, that's for sure), it's more of an appetizer to the main course.  Food for thought.

This movie is rated PG-13: Violence.",1341878400,4,1375,4.909090909090909
4423728,4,B004LWZWFQ,"Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone make a likable enough pair as the teens who find themselves in a heap of trouble once they learn that Dr. Curt Connors (who transforms himself into The Lizard), intends to make huge trouble for the unsuspecting denizens of the city.

It takes an hour for the story to start unwinding at a faster pace, once we learn about Spidey's parents leaving him to live with his Aunt May and Uncle Ben (Sally Fields and Martin Sheen). But once bitten by a spider, after a forbidden excursion to an experimental lab, the story leaves some of the character development behind and takes off when Spidey discovers his power of web flights and his ability to deal with school bullying.

Garfield never seems quite as vulnerable in the role as Tobey Maguire, but there's a sensitivity necessary for the more intimate scenes. He handles the action scenes well. Rhys Ifans does a commanding job of histrionics as the scientist whose regeneration of lost limbs transforms him into The Lizard, with spectacular effects.

James Horner's score is very effective at capturing all the thrills and excitement of magnificent photography and the special web effects are all any CGI fan could ask for, even when seen in 2D.

But there's an obvious discrepancy between the rather ordinary script and the magnificent special effects that will leave some disappointed that more time wasn't spent on the script itself furnishing a better story treatment, especially when dealing with Spidey's past.

The whole thing is stylishly directed (very effective in the action scenes) by a director with the apt name of Marc Webb and nicely scored by James Horner.",1341878400,3,1653,4.931654676258993

Here is yet another version of the superhero's familiar origin story presented in this 2012 adventure epic from director Marc Webb (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/500-Days-Of-Summer/dp/B0031Q0XCA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">(500) Days Of Summer</a>) and a trio of accomplished screenwriters - James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent (who co-wrote 2 and 3 of the previous trilogy as well as several classic films), and Steve Kloves (who adapted most of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter/dp/B005OCFGTO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter</a>&nbsp;series). Although they go back to Peter Parker's tragic childhood in the prologue, the set-up is otherwise identical to the previous iterations except aspiring actress Mary Jane Watson is nowhere to be seen. Instead, there is spunky Gwen Stacy, a police captain's daughter, the chief intern at the OsCorp Corporation, and Peter's high school crush.

Webb focuses much of his movie, especially the first half, to the burgeoning relationship between Peter and Gwen, and this turns out to be a smart move since the screenwriters appear otherwise strait-jacketed by the recognizable constraints of the back story. Raised by his kindly Uncle Ben and Aunt May, Peter is the same brilliant geek and social outcast in this movie, but he's given a more brooding sense of anguish by Andrew Garfield (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Social-Network/dp/B004HWT6DO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Social Network</a>) - who at 28, can still get away with playing a teen. The plot starts to accelerate when Peter stumbles upon his father's old briefcase filled with complex formulas that lead him to an old colleague of his father's, Dr. Curt Connors, now a top scientist at OsCorp.  Connors' focus is on cross-species genetics which he hopes will produce ""a world without weakness"", a personal cause to him since losing his right arm. While at OsCorp, Peter gets bitten by a spider that gives birth to his super powers. When Uncle Ben is later killed by a thief during a sidewalk scuffle, Peter decides to become a vigilante hero who is at odds with the police, which of course, means butting heads with Gwen's by-the-book father.

However, things really come to a head with the appearance of the Lizard, who causes havoc first in a fatalistic traffic jam on the Williamsburg Bridge and then at Peter's high school. The inevitable battle of good versus evil takes its toll on the city and on our beleaguered hero with the requisite special effects given a full showcase to bring the movie to a rousing finish. That finish occurs over a wearying 136-minute running time, fairly excessive given the familiarity of the story. Perhaps if the Lizard represented something more interesting than a straight-up Jekyll-and-Hyde metamorphosis, it wouldn't have felt quite as long. Although Webb handles the numerous action scenes with surprising acuity given this is only his second feature film as a director, he brings a level of personal intimacy to the movie that a typical action director would likely have bypassed so as not to alienate the fanboy audience. It's also a good thing that Webb hired two bright actors to bring human scale to the love story at the center of this comic book adventure. Beyond Garfield's solid work, a blonde Emma Stone brings her innately sharp manner to a character that could have easily turned into a simplistic damsel in distress.

Together the two attractive leads have a palpable chemistry that bodes well for the inevitable sequels. Last seen as the suspicious academic in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Five-Year-Engagement/dp/B005LAIHE0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Five-Year Engagement</a>, Rhys Ifans plays Connors with similar caginess and with the help of CGI effects, fulfills his villainous quotient fitfully. The rest of the stellar supporting cast feels somewhat underserved within the story's dimensions. Denis Leary plays Gwen's father with his trademark casual authority but perhaps at the expense of the character's needed gravitas toward the end. With two Oscars, Sally Field can certainly do more than look constantly concerned, the basic requirement here, but leave it to the veteran actress to provide more depth to the fretful Aunt May. Martin Sheen seems to have the best grasp on his character's blue-collar sensibilities as Uncle Ben. James Horner's music struck me as overly bombastic for the stealth-like movements of Spider-Man, while John Schwartzman's cinematography is a bit on the murky side during the nighttime shots, especially during the climax. I just wish the whole venture could have enthralled me more, but despite some clear virtues with this latest installment, Sam Raimi still casts too foreboding a shadow from my perspective.",1341792000,5,5800,6.165636588380717
4423730,1,B004LWZWFQ,"Remember that movie The New Guy? Of course you probably don't because that movie was terrible, but if you do this Spider-Man movie for some reason (I don't know why) reminds me of The New Guy. I've seen just about every superhero comic book movie there is. Hulk, Incredible Hulk, Fantastic 4, Fantastic 4 part 2, Catwoman, Elektra, Ghost Rider and Ghost Rider 2, none of those are as bad as this movie, not even Ghost Rider 2. This movie is horrible and pointless. I'm not some huge Spider-Man, comic book fanatic but I know a bad movie when I see it and this is bad. At the beginning we basically get a look at Peter Parker's life. His parents mysteriously disappear in the beginning leaving him to live with his Aunt and Uncle. Then shoot to him in High School. He's getting picked on by the school jock and even gets beat up by him for trying to stick up for a kid he was bullying. The movie spends about 30 pointless minutes just on Peter, then it feels like they rush in the orgin story from the 1st Spider-Man movie. The movie is just so dull and boring and some things where just so stupid to me I wanted to walk out, like when Peter discovers his powers and goes into a empty warehouse and starts swinging on chains (before he has his web shooters) was just stupid. His uncles death, it never felt like him and the uncle were ever really close to begin with, but how the uncle dies in this one is just terrible. Why he felt the need to fight with this guy over the gun was just crazy. The crane scene, he's supposed to be Spider-Man yet he needs help from cranes to get to a building, really? The kid in the burning car, the basketball scene, how he kept taking off his mask, I don't understand these Marvel movies. Why are they so obsessed with making their superheros go mask-less towards the end of their movies. I know the original Spider-Man movies were not perfect but this reboot was not needed. This movie was so bad that they could have just done Spider-Man 4. I didn't like Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man but damn I'd rather have him over this guy. This movie is more of a love story, Spider-Man is barely in it and when he is it all feels rushed. The lizard is boring. Everything about this movie is just so dull and boring and I found myself sleep at the end. I know others enjoyed it and that's cool but this movie just wasn't for me at all.",1341792000,28,2359,4.267857142857143
4423731,4,B004LWZWFQ,"I have just watched 'The Amazing Spiderman' at the movie theater today and while it's still fresh in my mind I'll knock out this review.  I won't waste time explaining the premise and happenings of the film, that's already on Wikipedia AND Amazon. But I will give my personal opinions/feelings of the film.

**Caution, some spoilers ahead**

Is this better or worse that the Tobey Mcguire incarnation?  Well, overall it's better.  Andrew Garfield looks like the character more, has a better voice for the role and does A LOT of his own stunts.

While it improves on the film franchise, this incarnation also lacks.  As Mark Eremite in his review on Amazon stated: the Uncle Ben death is messed up.  By now you probably know the story of how Peter could have stopped a robber but didn't and later on the robber kills Uncle Ben, probably for his car or money.  This guilt of inaction leads Peter to start giving of himself constantly as Spiderman.  This movie sort of screws that up premise though.  I personally thought that the previous Uncle Ben in the Mcguire 'Spiderman' movies did a stellar job.  Martin Sheen however does not.  Aside from not being the warm affectionate Uncle Ben we the fans are all familier with, he screws up BIG on the death scene.

Don't get me wrong, when you see Peter listening to the last voicemail that Uncle Ben leaves him before dying you will feel sadness, Sheen is a decent actor, no doubt about that.  I just don't think he was right for this role.  I kept getting the feeling that he was just there to add STAR POWER to the film, nothing more.  Anyway...back to the death scene.  As the robber is running he runs into someone and falls and his gun slids out onto the ground.  Okay if I was there and saw that, I would just step back against the building and provide a clear path for the villian.  He would no doubt pick up his gun and run past me, leaving me ALIVE for leaving him alone.  The Uncle Ben in this film does not do this, he sees the gun and runs for it.  The robber and Ben get to the gun at the same time and begin to wrestle for it.  The gun goes off and Ben dies.  This pivotal death scene/event is kind of cheapened.  The death scene in Tobey's movie is much better and lays a blanket of guilt on Spiderman that will drive him for the rest of his life.

FYI, to all you readers of this review, I know the death scene is the product of the writers and not Sheen's fault.  He was just doing the part they laid out for him.  Anyway...

Also it's kind of comical seeing Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield playing 17 yr old high school students.  Emma Stone is 23 and does not look like she belongs in high school.  Although I will retract and say that Garfield, despite being 28, does do a pretty good job.  He kind of goes for an Emo-Peter Parker in this film, dark and quiet.

Despite the flaws, the film does shine in the special effects department.  The Lizard looks fantastic and the scenes where you are watching the movie from Spidey's p.o.v., epic.  There is quite a bit of web slinging in this movie, something the Tobey Mcguire 'Spiderman 1' lacked.

This film also showcases Peter's intelligence and ingenuity.  He designs his web shooters in this film, and does not simply rely on glands in his wrists.  He also designs his costume, sews it himself, screen-printed on the designs and completes the mask with lenses from his sunglasses.  Finally I know how Spiderman can cover his eyes and still see...

The plot is nothing new to anyone.  Spiderman is raised by his aunt and uncle, uncle gets shot and dies, Peter Parker quits being selfish and becomes Spiderman, AND fights superpowered villians.  Is the plot fresh, NO.  Is it still fun and enjoyable to watch, ABSOLUTELY.  Plus the cast is quite good, Dennis Leary, Rhys Ifans, Sally Fields, and an appearance by the one and only C. Thomas Howell.

Is this worth a watch at the theaters, YES.  Is this own-worthy?  OH YEAH!!!

While this film is no where near 'The Avengers', it is number 2 for me this summer on my ratings board.

IMPORTANT, watch the movie through the credits, there is another scene I have read about with Kurt Conners talking to a mysterious man in his prison cell.  I had to go to the bathroom and missed it!!!  Come on movie makers, enough with the post credits scenes, just put them in the regular movie!!!

Well I've got to go, I am currently working on the 'Game of Thrones': Season 1 box set.  So far it is pretty good, could be my new favorite show...",1341792000,6,4491,4.42002442002442
4423732,5,B004LWZWFQ,"When I first heard that there was going to be a reboot of the Spider-man movies, I was skeptical. It seemed too soon, and I wasn't a big fan of the original films as it was. I honestly thought this would be a big mistake. I will gladly say that I was wrong.

We start by seeing a younger Peter Parker playing a game with his father. Moments later, he is ripped away from the life he knew in a flurry of events. He is left with his aunt and uncle and his parents disappear. Already a new story is being told which was never included in the original films, ""what happened to Peter Parker's parents.""

The film transitions into a high school version of Peter, played by Andrew Garfield, who pulls off being a high school student surprisingly well despite the actor's true age. Much like every incarnation of Peter Parker, he is a nerd with few (if any) friends, and a crush on the prettiest girl in school: Gwen Stacy, (Played by the Emma Stone.) Something interesting to note is that in the universe of the original comics, Gwen Stacy was Peter's first crush, before Mary Jane, so we already see that this movie is running closer to the source material.

We know the story after that. He comes across a genetically modified spider, (while in this story searching for a man who worked with his father) he gets bitten, and soon transforms into a spider-man. These scenes are definitely humorous, but I do think we could have done without the internet search montages. Even if a Peter Parker from 2012 does have the internet at his disposal, I always consider it filler which could be replaced with something more entertaining and useful.

And as Peter discovers his new abilities and starts to work on a new project, events are set into motion to turn him into the familiar masked Spider-Man. (Complete with mechanical web-shooters, which is also pulled directly from the comics.)

If we look at this film on its own, it is an entertaining movie which takes a fresh look at a story we thought we already new. There is more of a focus on Peter being an orphan, and also on his quirky genius, which without it, there wouldn't be a plot or a villain for the movie. It takes aspects of the source material that were previously ignored, and ones that just never got explored, and tells them fantastically. As for the stunts, they might just be more believable as you watch a seventeen year old swing his body around from building to building with the help of home-made webshooters.

One thing you cannot say about this movie is that Mark Webb (director) did not know what he was doing.

Everyone has his or her own opinion, and I've seen plenty that still hold the original close to their heart, and can't see anyone but Tobey Maguire as Peter, but this movie definitely holds its own and deserves to be remembered as a top notch superhero film.",1341792000,3,2836,4.516569200779727
4423733,5,B004LWZWFQ,"I am really at a loss to try to understand all the negative reviews of this film. Some people seem obsessed in wanting to do comparisons to previous versions, stories, origins of the story, etc. My response is simply....get over it! It's been so long since I even saw the older films, that I was able to see ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" with a fresh and open-minded viewpoint. I got more than I ever expected from this film, and was engrosed in the well-written STORY. Stan Lee was involved in this film's creation so I can fully accept whatever changes or modifications were made in the story to flesh out the origins of it and the characters more.
  I won't go into the poltlines...others have done more than enough with that. I also wonder if some of the previous ""reviewers"" even watched the film instead of talking or texting during it so that they missed important exposition points developing the story. I liked the realistic approach to the beginnings of the story line, the fine actors, and the gradual integration of the ""meat"" of the story leading to the parts where, let's face it, you HAVE to have a suspension of belief to just ""go with the flow"" of the film.
  All in all, a very satisfying evening at the movie house, with a very well-written, well-directed and well-filmed story. There was complete pathos with believable characters as performed, and excitement during the ""action"" sequences which were not over-done, in my opinion. It was well worth seeing in the 3D format. I look forward to the 3-D Blu-Ray, and will be in line to see a sequel whenever it arrives.",1341792000,3,1580,4.652329749103942
4423754,3,B004LWZWFQ,"Well like with many other movies of remakes this one does not hold up.  Why would they even consider remaking suck a recent movie that was a record breaker? go figure.
The story is completely different, the kids not nerdy enough, he's a skater?
I really didn't like his mannerisms in the movie either, pretty fake.
I did enjoy the movie and loved Emma in it, but theirs no spark so to speak, poorly written.  I am sure it sets up for a 2nd one if they ever invest in it at this point we'll not know? I wouldn't touch it.
In fact spiderman isn't as much of a bad ass as he is in the original, reloading spider webs?
I never have been a comic book person so I can't tell you if this one is more accurate or not, all I know is from a movie goer it's a lot less quality of the movie, not the special affects just the story line and plot.
You never really get attached to any of the characters.
Spiderman's character is never really developed also, mostly he was a vigilante seeking revenge for his uncles death until he feels as he has to stop the main bad guy.
I just didn't buy it and will not buy it when it comes out, they would have to say it's a big FLOP I would guess
hope I didn't spoil it for anyone but I love movies.",1341792000,4,1223,4.008196721311475
4423755,2,B004LWZWFQ,"I teach 8th graders in South Korea. During an end-of-term party, we watched&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rushmore/dp/6305428239/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rushmore</a>. Many of the kids liked the film, but a lot of them complained about it. ""What didn't you like about it?"" I asked them. ""It's old,"" they responded. ""Old? How do you know how old it is?"" I asked. They replied, ""None of the kids have cell phones"" or, my favorite, ""It just FEELS old."" ""Trust me,"" I told them. ""If you still feel this way about old things in ten to twenty years, you're going to end up just like Herman Blume from the movie: hating yourself.""

I only relate this story because it seems like that attitude -- if something is from ten to fifteen years old then it is automatically worthless -- was what prompted this absolutely unnecessary and inferior reboot of the Spiderman franchise.

It is nearly impossible to review this film without also referring to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Raimi-s-trilogy/dp/B000UR9T82/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Raimi's trilogy</a>&nbsp;of 9-4 years ago. I'm not here to say Raimi's films were flawless, but in spite of their various problems, they were certainly iconic for awhile, and the second film arguably set the benchmark for superhero movies at the time. Even if you hated all three of them, it would be very hard to argue for the existence of this film, since it adds very little (if anything at all) to the Spiderman story or its telling. Actually, if you hated Raimi's films, you are very much not likely to enjoy this film, since it glistens and zips around with a lot of the same high-sheen verve that you could find in Raimi's films.

But let's not compare, as tantalizing an option as that is. As is, does this film hold up?

Not really. First of all, the movie tinkers with Spiderman's origins. I'm not some kind of purist who cares all that much about staying true to the source material, but the original story did have a readily identifiable moral structure and some pretty solid symbolic aspects that propelled the rest of Peter Parker's tale. In this case, Uncle Ben, rather than a mostly benign voice of reason and responsibility, is a thick-headed and annoying do-gooder. Originally, it is Parker's selfish carelessness that puts Uncle Ben in harms way. This time, Uncle Ben voluntarily puts himself in harms way in an act of do-goodery that is absolutely senseless and bound to fail. The film mutates its moral center from ""with great power comes great responsibility"" to ""crazy old men shouldn't wander around the streets picking fights with armed thugs.""

Let's ignore that, though. It's only about ten minutes of the film. The rest of the flick follows Parker as he stumbles ludicrously into his powers. The chain of events that lead to this scene stretch credulity, since they seem to exist in a world where common sense is no longer common. Just as one example: Parker illegally gains access to a massive, top secret, and highly dangerous scientific facility by pretending to be an intern. When the real intern shows up, he is dragged kicking and screaming out of the door in a scene that hopes it is so funny that audiences will not wonder why no one in this highly classified building ever asks for I.D.

There is so much more. Parker's classmate, Gwen, is played by the 23 year-old Emma Stone, who is a young cutie but nowhere near convincing as a high schooler, especially when she is leading tours in the aforementioned high-tech lab. Andrew Garfield is far more believable as our titular character, and although he's a lot nicer to look at and more fun to watch than Tobey Maguire ever was, his character is so inconsistent that it gets jarring. By the time he started ordering and making his very own wrist-strapped-web-slingers (this new Spiderman can't make his own webs), I wondered why he ever stayed in school with his amazing ability to craft unheard of machinery using unheard of chemicals. And how did he even get access to this stuff? Oh, wait. I forgot. This world never asks for I.D.

It's silly. It's pointless. It's even kind of demeaning (more than once, the movie uses news report voice overs to remind the audience of what happened in the scene that they JUST watched). There are some fun moments when Spiderman is whipping around the city, and Parker gets a few amusing quips in here and there, but the whole thing is so schlocky and rote that it feels like the over-eager, under-talented younger brother of the first Raimi film. Perhaps if they'd decided to completely revamp the whole thing from top to bottom, including the origins, the setting, and the characters, there would be something here to talk about. Unfortunately, though, it's just a pale imitation of what's already come before, adding nothing that doesn't slow it down or make it ridiculous. For kids who hate ""old stuff"" and who've never heard of Kirsten Dunst or Bruce Campbell, maybe this movie has some value. For everyone else, you're just wasting your time.",1341792000,28,5089,4.994103773584905
4423756,3,B004LWZWFQ,"-Spoilers ahead-
The Amazing Spider-man had its moments where it was quite good but Sam Raimi's 2002 Spider-man ultimately is the better film in the end. Andrew Garfield is a pretty solid spider-man and is the best thing about the film but I do prefer Tobey Maguire over Garfield as Spider-Man. When it comes to Aunt May there is no question that Rosemary Harris is a far better Aunt May then Sally Field! The battle sequences are far superior in Sam Raimi's films then in the Amazing Spider-man there was nothing really awe inspiring about them (other then a decent scene where Peter wraps the Lizard up in a web at the school but compare that to every other action scene in the three previous Spider-man films yeah it pales in comparison no doubt)Gwen Stacy's father dies at the end of the film and honestly I could care a less about it I was not moved by the scene also Emma Stone is a decent Gwen Stacy but I don't find her that appealing as an actress. Rhys Ifans was solid as the Lizard but nothing really to noteworthy about his performance it was pretty average..there are about four or five noteworthy scenes in the film Peter saving the boy in the burning car hanging from the bridge..Peter toying with a car thief and battles a cop and leaves..in the finale of the film Peter is injured and about to jump to the top of the Oscorp Building as he is running this great piece of music starts playing that really makes the scene and Uncle Ben's narration at the end was kinda of nice as well..the final shot of Spiderman sweeping through the skies of New York was nicely done..I enjoyed parts of the film..it gives people more Spider-Man which is always a good thing but I would of taken Raimi's Spiderman 4 over this film any day.",1341792000,6,1738,4.45141065830721
4423757,4,B004LWZWFQ,"I'm a 50-yr old female, and I saw the non-3D version of this at the theatre with my 22-yr old and very mainstream/popular nephew - we both loved it and would watch it again.  The rest of the audience also seemed to enjoy this as well.

While I did enjoy the Tobey McGuire spiderman movies - I was never a big fan.  They were somewhat cheesy and sappy and not ones I'd want to watch multiple times. But we were in the mood for seeing a movie and since this just came out - this was mostly all that was playing today, so this is what we saw.

It is basically the same core story -- (he is raised by Aunt May/Uncle Ben, he still gets bit by a ""special"" spider to become spider man, Uncle Ben still dies, Peter blames himself, etc.) --  HOWEVER it is all done in a MUCH more hip/fresh and enjoyable way.  We really liked this cast and the new twists to the story.

The evil guy in this character is done very well - great costume/makeup. [Speaking of makeup, Sally Field fans should be warned, she looks horrible in this movie].

This movie ends with the suggestion there will be another movie with this cast, which will let us in on what happened to Peter's parents.  I am looking forward to it!

Check out the trailers for a good idea if you'll like it or not.

BOTTOM LINE:
This movie was WELL DONE overall and VERY ENJOYABLE.  It is (EASILY) my favorite spider man movie to date (because of the casting and writing).

4423758,2,B004LWZWFQ,"Considering this film both as a standalone and in comparison to the previous series, the discerning viewer will likely keep asking the same question many others disappointed by it are asking - why? The entire production screamed mediocre, despite another sprawling budget. I kept trying to consider performances both on their own and inevitably in comparison to the other films - since, after all, they were just released a few years ago. I felt virtually every actor and actress lead in the first film was stronger. I love much of Sally Field's work, but she felt completely miscast in this movie. Andrew Garfield was fine as Spiderman, but in my opinion not nearly as engaging or interesting as Tobey Maguire. Martin Sheen is hard to beat, but frankly I would probably still argue Uncle Ben was better played by Cliff Robertson.

The storyline itself (and its minor changes) felt thrown together. I thought numerous aspects of this film felt like they were designed to directly compete with the previous series - which also undermines uncritical fans who keep claiming comparisons aren't fair. In my opinion this film often felt like it was trying to compete with the earlier series. For example. . .

(Minor spoilers ahead)

Before the closing credits there are extended scenes of Spiderman web slinging around the city, moving between buildings, etc. We saw this sort of thing in the previous series . . .however in this one the tricks and stunts he performs are pushed to the extreme and just looked, in my opinion, ridiculous. . .and the CGI doesn't keep up. Those scenes and some of the fighting have that ""speeded up"" CGI look - I suspect you know what I mean. Think back to Spiderman 3 - I felt it suffered from it as well. Too much is going on and it starts to look like old 1950s stop motion. Some of the fight scenes just did not look convincing. Compare this film's CGI to the climatic scenes in ""The Avengers"" - the quality is, in my opinion, very different.

I was also left a little perplexed as to why the Lizard was chosen as the main villain. Granted, they were trying to do a few things differently (far too few, in my opinion), but the Lizard? I do not read comic books anymore, but I do not recall the Lizard being a key villain while I was growing up. . .even the Beetle might have been a better choice. That's just a personal opinion - I think the larger issue was the manner in which the character was developed in the script. Rhys Ifans does what he can with the material and he is clearly a competent actor, but I found little interesting about the overall portrayal of the villain of this film. I was never quite sure I understood why he was executing his dastardly plan, and frankly didn't care. This movie eventually just lost me..

I watch a lot of movies, but I have zero loyalty to the first Spiderman series. I evaluated this film first on its own merits, and then in comparison to the other films - which are both inevitable things to do. If the previous films had never been made, this film would still feel like a very weak link in what has been a surprisingly good 2012 summer movie season. There was little that was ""amazing"" - though overall it isn't terrible. . .ultimately it just felt like a pure Hollywood money grab. It reminds me of some of Roland Emmerich's films, which I always wanted to love but ultimately felt a bit betrayed by. Granted, every mainstream film is ultimately about making money, but are the highest paid writers in Hollywood this incapable of either originality or improvement? Jeez the Marvel, DC and assorted other comic universes are huge. Please, at least pick something original to the screen and write a script worth watching.",1341705600,4,3699,4.606980273141123

I didn't know what to expect from this remake of the original Spiderman series. What I found was that it really was not a remake but a rebirth of the Spiderman movies with a new cast, a slightly different story and great computer graphics animation. I enjoyed the story and the acting of Garfield and Stone was very good. The villain Dr. Curt Conners (really his alter ego) (played by Rhys Ifans) was a very good role and the actor did a great job portraying the good professor and the evil mutant.

The special effects were well done in this movie and as the technology improves you would expect such an enhancement in this newer edition. I was glad that the movie was not just a remake of the original movie but it had some story changes including the new villain of the professor instead of the Green Goblin. I found the relationship between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy to be interesting and Emma Stone did a marvelous job in the role. I wasn't sure of what to expect of her in the movie but I was impressed with her performance.

The movie to me was good and it obviously is a set up for the next Spiderman movie to be made. They are going to dig gold in this franchise series until it is worn out. The movie is worth seeing and if you are a true Spiderman fan you will enjoy just seeing another well-made action movie about your hero. The movie is somewhere between a 4 and a 5 star rating but for some reason 4 stars seems for appropriate. If they continue making the movies that follow as well done as this one, then the directors and producers have justified remaking this series.

  Despite all that I was never disappointed by the Amazing Spider-Man since not everything in this film was done in the Sam Raimi original. With Peter in the originals, we mostly just saw him raise his hand in class or people call him smart but here we finally get to see how smart he really is. He creates his web shooter and doesn't simply shoot webs out his wrists and also helps Doc Connors in his lab. While a small thing I love, is how Flash  is a bully to Peter but a fan of Spider-Man, like I've seen in recent Spider-Man shows, I got a kick out of that.
  We also get Emma Stone as a hot and adorable Gwen Stacy who has wonderful chemistry with Garfield. Dennis Leary as a better Captain Stacy than James Cromwell was in Spider-Man 3, mostly because we get to see his love for his daughter. While in Spider-Man 3 he just calmly stood there when she was hanging from a building and said ""Gwen? What is she doing up there? "" It's also nice to finally get the Lizard since Raimi was very slowly getting to that. Even before Spider-Man 4 was canceled, John Malkovich was cast as Vulture, so Raimi still wasn't getting to the Lizard.
  Andrew Garfield stands out less as Peter Parker than Tobey Maguire did, Garfield looks like any normal teenager of today. While Maguire was a bit of an over the top nerd, even when he should have been a badass with the black suit on in part 3. Garfield I think hams it up better with the suit on as he has a quick tongue and is the goofy wise-ass Spider-Man is meant to be. While Emma Stone is sweet as Gwen and less moody and self-centered as Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane. So sue me, but I loved this movie and can't wait for more.

4423763,3,B004LWZWFQ,"Saw Amazing Spider-Man last night in 3D... I was the ONLY one in the theater, besides the projectionist! I felt so snooty, having my own ""private screening""

As for the movie, itself, a solid 2.5 out of 5 stars. The leads are good, Special Effects are nothing we haven't seen a million times by now, story is a rehash of the previous 3 movies. Hero loves girl, hero's mentor turns himself into psychopath, hero must save world from mentor.

Minor spoilers below, so... you have been warned....

Andrew Garfield's take on Peter Parker/Spider-Man is much less ""nerd"" (as Tobey Maguire was) as he is a ""social misfit"". While he is a genius-level intellect, he's extremely unskilled with personal interactions. As Spider-Man, he's far more relaxed than Maguire's Spidey.

Emma Stone is Gwen Stacy, the love interest in the film. Unlike MJ (Kirsten Dunst) in the first three movies, Gwen is confident, charming, and not a ""damsel in distress"". She also is a bit of a social outcast, because she pretty, but also extremely smart, distancing her from both the ""in-crowd"" as well as the ""nerds"".

Rhys Ifans is the ""villain"" of the pic, as Gwen and Peter's mentor, Doctor Conners/The Lizard. He also has a history with Peter's father. As a villain, he takes bits and pieces from the previous Spider-Villains. From Willem Dafoe's Green Gobin comes the ""talking to himself"" and the mysterious green gas that gives superpowers (in this case, lizard powers); from Alfred Molina's Doc Ock comes a sense of purpose to his behavior... he thinks he's going to rid the world of disease and minorities by making everyone the same; and finally, as The Lizard, he acts a lot like Spider-man 3's Venom... A lot of clawing, roaring, and leaping about.

Dennis Leary, Martin Sheen, and Sally Field all have rather confusing turns as support characters who try to make the most of their scenes, but seem rather rushed. Martin Sheen's ""Uncle Ben"" is not nearly as endearing as Cliff Robertson's).  Sally Field as Aunt May looks to be on the border of a severe anxiety attack at any moment. She doesn't seem to be a ""pillar of strength"" that Aunt May was in the first 3 films.

Dennis Leary play's the Police chief in charge of bringing in Spider-Man and The Lizard, and also happens to be Gwen's overprotective father. The most ""normal"" character in the film. His actions and motivation are very understandable.

Special Effects were largely the same things seen in the past movies: skinny hero leaping and swinging from skyscrapers. There are some webspinning and wallcrawling shots that are done from the viewpoint of Spider-Man, which is kind of cool. Lizard effects were rather disappointing. The body was fine, but the face was weird. It didn't look like a lizard face, more like a Star Trek-ish alien face... Hard to explain... Just didn't work for me.",1341532800,6,2833,4.836776859504132
4423774,5,B004LWZWFQ,"To start with, the acting was amazing. Not a single performance was half-hearted, and everyone was very believable in the role they were given, right down to the physics nerds. But no one stood out more than Andrew Garfield, who took a HUGE risk in his performance. Rather than deliver the perfectly safe and expected performance of perfect elocution and enunciation, he chose a far different performance; he stuttered, he repeated himself when nervous, he twitched and hung his head when embarrassed.. It serves to make his character seem all the more human, a quality I find very refreshing in a current cinemasphere of suave, well-spoken super heroes and serves to evoke the same kind of feeling people had when Spider-Man was introduced to the world: a troubled nerdy awkward teen with a spindly physique in the midst of strong, muscular, square-jawed supermen.

The rest of the cast are also fabulous. Emma Stone, good in most anything, is amazing here, and delivered a sort of quiet strength and confidence not seen in the girls of most teen romance stories; far cry from the sobbing dependency of Bella Swan and company. Rhys Ifans brought a level of sadness to the role that actually made you sympathize with the character without having to resort to sensational drama points: no need to kill a wife and have him lose his mind to mechanical arm, you already feel for him before he ever even takes that serum. Denis Leary executed his role perfectly, being believable as both a tough police captain and loving, loving- if over protective- father. Sally Field was surprising as Aunt May, far less bland philosopher and more human this time around. And Martin Sheen as Uncle Ben was the absolute PERFECT fit.

As for the visuals... this IS Spider-Man. Period. More so than just the wise-cracks, more so than the web shooters or anything else, the very way he MOVES is the essence of Spider-Man. At one point he actually leaps onto the Lizard's back and literally crawls all over him, cocooning him in webbing.. The aerial movement is incredible too. Marc Webb very much did his homework.

The story flowed very well too. You learn about Peter's parents, their connection to Dr. Connors, it's very nicely explained why Connors does what he does, and all in all is an amazing thing to see unfold. Sorry, it's very hard to talk about without potential spoilers... but let's just say that the oft-discussed plot holes are actually established to be plot points for the sequels, as illustrated by a few shots before film's end. And as for the required ""suspension of disbelief"" being too high... it's not if you pay attention. What he uses to make his suit is not exactly rare to be seen ordered, and the web shooters he makes from multiple parts from different devices; he just orders multiple devices that he knows has the parts he needs and assembles from there. No one can possibly tell who he is based on that, tbh. And as for the ""security room"", well, it's a small room with a top-secret device adjoining that was securely locked with a mega encryption key. Peter gets in only because he sees someone else enter the code, and honestly, it's not hard to believe something top secret would be... top secret and not on-camera for anyone in the security room to see. So no irrational amounts are required. And as for tone, it's not near as dark as some would imply. Just more grounded and less campy. I'd say maybe just a TAD darker than the Marvel Cinematic universe itself, but at no time did it feel it was trying to be Batman or anything of the like. (And tbh, the comics got far darker than this movie did at times. *See Kraven's Last Hunt, Death of Gwen Stacy, Maximum Carnage or really anything to do with Carnage*...)

All in all, it's an incredible film, well directed, well acted, and made by a man who clearly understands his source material, borrows from two separate versions and blends them beautifully. Not only did he make a film that's a whole different animal than Raimi's, but surpassed his trilogy in every way. Can't wait for the sequel.",1341446400,6,4061,4.7074542897327705
4423775,4,B004LWZWFQ,"Andrew Garfield rules! I have only one minor quibble with this exciting, funny, satisfying, special-effects laden, and ultimately heart-wrenching, film. It should be called ""Spider-Boy: The Genesis"" because the most appealing elements are the scenes where our hero blunders into his spider-like abilities, learns how to use them, and then matures as he comes to grasp the heavy responsibilities that go with them.

We see:
  * Andrew Garfield (""The Social Network"") is Peter Parker/Spider-Man, left by his parents with an aunt and uncle who must raise him when, for some mysterious reason, they never return. He wants to know why.
  * Emma Stone (""The Help"") is Gwen Stacy, a very bright classmate who intercedes when Peter is bullied. Turns out she is not only smart, she is also resourceful, brave and clearly likes him.
  * Rhys Ifans (""Anonymous"") is Dr. Curt Conners, a former partner who had worked with Peter's father on cross-species genetics research.
  * Denis Leary (""Rescue Me"") is Captain Stacy, Gwen's father, out to catch that oddly dressed vigilante who is complicating things on the streets for the police department.
  * Sally Field (""Brothers and Sisters"") is Aunt May, a practical soul who keeps the home fires burning, even when Peter forgets to buy eggs.
  * Martin Sheen (""The West Wing"") is Uncle Ben, who should write the book on child rearing. He is the right balance of strict, funny and loving. Peter Parker is a lucky boy.
  * C. Thomas Howell (""Southland"" remember him in ""E.T.""?) is Jack's Father who watches that oddly dressed vigilante rescue his son Jack from certain drowning. He starts the heart-warming bit. ...smile...

This charming and involving PG-13 version has far more aerial battles than I like, but hey! It's ""Spider-Man!"" The final act would never work with an actor of lesser calibre than Garfield. As far as I'm concerned, he can sell anything.

When the film ended, we hung back, knowing how Marvel likes to add teasers, and sure enough, there IS one. That means we can look forward to a second installment. I'll bet I end up with another trilogy from Amazon.  That makes ME happy!",1341446400,5,2131,4.921568627450981

Emma Stone is excellent, and a much better female lead than Kirsten Dunst, and Michael Sheen is superb as Uncle Ben. Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield have pitch-perfect chemistry.

Gone is the emo Spiderman, to be replaced by a fun, exploratory teenager who is testing his strengths and limits but also knows that he has certain responsibilities to use his powers for good.

4423777,5,B004LWZWFQ,"I loved the new spider-man movie.  It had depth, story, set up, and chemistry through out with all the characters.  Every character added their own interesting personality and watching some mesh and some crash was entertaining and the growth of spider-man was more realistic and stronger than the predecessors.  It may have some faults but I still feel it was better than most summer blockbusters or superhero films by a good arms length and then some.  I would recommend this movie to those who like origin stories, good actor chemistry, and especially if you are a huge spidey fan.  Webb told the story in a great way that shows room to grow for spider-man, and still gave him a personality that is funny yet sincere.",1341446400,5,719,4.72
4423778,4,B004LWZWFQ,"""The Amazing Spiderman"" has come to theatres with a promise of a restart to the old ""Spiderman"" series that ended in 2007 with Tobey Maguire and Sam Raimi. The first ""Spiderman"" movie launched in 2002 with exciting technology, cool effects and grossed $821 million. In fact, even the third of the series made $890 million, despite being an absolute mess of a movie and the death of the series. So, ""The Amazing Spiderman"" reboot 2012, is most likely going to be another great addition to an otherwise outstanding summer of movies.

There is much to be said about ""The Amazing Spiderman"" and for the most part, all of it is good. One of my first inclinations when I saw that the new movie was `restarting' with Peter Parker, a.k.a. Spiderman's origins and back story, I thought, haven't we already seen this. Do we have to start over from scratch? In a way, we did. The new movie has more insight and a different story to tell, but at the same time, it rehashes a lot of the same things the 2002 ""Spiderman"" tackled.

On the down side, this restarting put us right into the same place we were with Batman when it was rebooted with ""Dark Knight"" and when ""Iron Man"" began. First you must endure an hour of Peter Parker becoming Spiderman and then things can get to what you came to see. That being said, the hour of `becoming' Spiderman was not unbearable thanks to great actors, up and coming actors and a reliance of the director to make sure that we not only recognized the characters, but we knew them, loved them and cared about them. This might just be the biggest gift of the movie. I can safely say, that the characters in ""The Amazing Spiderman"" were brought to life more vividly than the previous serious.

Like ""Dark Knight"" and ""Iron Man"", ""The Amazing Spiderman"" builds to a crescendo of effects, action and intensity. It also builds to a point that you know by the time it's over that, like ""Dark Knight"" and we hoped ""Iron Man"", the second movie from the creators of ""The Amazing Spiderman"" is going to be absolutely breathtaking. With time, comes knowledge, lessons learned and the biggest point of all, better technology.

When Spiderman is being Spiderman, the technology that a new age of 3D and special effects has allowed filmmakers to do things that was previously only possible in cartoons. Unfortunately, it takes a long time to get to the full fledged Spiderman moments. The moments at the end of the movie, basically show you what's in store when ""The Amazing Spiderman 2"" comes out and we can skip all the `how it became to be' stuff.

We've seen a lot of it before, but that doesn't stop the movie from being well acted, emotional and dazzling. For the most part though, at least all the formality is out of the way now, and when they decide to film movie number two, it won't be so bogged down with explanation. ""The Amazing Spiderman"" is a good movie, but as far as I'm concerned, it is a teaser for what is to come.",1341446400,5,2944,4.526315789473684
4423779,4,B004LWZWFQ,"The movie begins with a flashback of the very young Peter Parker playing hide-and-seek with his parents, who are soon whisked off on a mysterious scientific quest for reasons he isn't privy to, but are guaranteed to cause angst once he turns into a teenager, played by Andrew Garfield. Parker's mentor, Curt Connors, (Rhys Ifans) is a friend of Peter's dad, employee of Oscorp, who has been researching inter-species limb regeneration for years, and who winds up experimenting on himself (he's an amputee) using a formula Peter comes up with.  This transforms him into a cross between a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle and the Incredible Hulk.  He decides that humans are hopelessly flawed and goes to brood in the sewers of Gotham, where he twirls his mustache a lot and plots nefarious deeds, to be foiled by Spider Man, who feels guilt for helping create this monster.  Also, as his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) reminds him in slightly different words, ""With great power comes great responsibility.""

Bearing a disconcerting resemblance to Hilary Duff, Emma Stone plays Peter's love interest, Gwen Stacy, daughter of head NYPD (Denis Leary), and fellow science devotee, around whom he's tongue-tied but does manage to share his big secret.  She helps save the world in knee-length boots and very short skirts, as her dad attempts to corral both Spider-Man and the Lizard.  Garfield (""The Social Network,"" ""Never Let Me Go"") is a little too handsome to convince as a high school outcast, but he is believable as both a shy guy who's ""passionate about science,"" and a cocky superhero enjoying his newfound powers.

The special effects deliver, although I'm the type of viewer who keeps thinking of alternate ways the hero can defeat the villian a whole lot faster than he's currently doing on screen.  There are moments of genuine sweetness between the characters, but like with most action thrillers, they are few and far between. The new ""Spider-Man"" is noticeably different from the Tobey Maguire version, so don't go in expecting identical character names, characters or even trademark quotes. If you don't, you may enjoy it, but that depends on your allegiance to the previous trilogy.",1341446400,7,2183,5.027700831024931

4423781,3,B004LWZWFQ,"I think this actor did a good job playing a young spiderman, the director had all the actors put a lot of emotion into this movie, it just wasn't good guy versus bad guy, there's a lot more to the story.

It's an awful movie with poor writing and poor direction. The visuals are pretty great, but once again, soulless and cookie cutter. If Sony continues to retain Spider Man, I will refuse to see any future sequels. They simply have no idea how to make a decent Spider Man movie, and it's a shame. I do not recommend this.",1341446400,27,565,4.717171717171717
4423783,4,B004LWZWFQ,"And because not a lot of people clamored for it, here's THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN, director Marc Webb's sort of unnecessary reboot of Sam Raimi's wallcrawler film franchise. Sam Raimi's falling out with Sony left a lingering bad taste, and so, going in, I wasn't too keen about this one. Still, Spidey's my favorite superhero and I couldn't pass it up.

First impressions, stepping out the theater: Director Marc Webb had big shoes to fill, and I think he successfully establishes a Spidey universe that is grittier and rougher 'round the edges and yet allows space for the occasional forays into humor. Much of this is personified in Garfield's Peter Parker. I had never heard of Garfield - apparently, he's half-Brit, half-Yankee - but his interpretation of Peter is more on point than Maguire's. Garfield's Peter sounds more like a chatty guy from Queens than Maguire's version ever did. And while he channels Maguire's angsty demeanor, Andrew Garfield injects bravado into his character, or you can call it moxie or even jackassery. It's New Yawk, baby.

THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN is gratifying in several ways and, specifically, in three ways. Spidey's mechanical webshooters are back. This is cool on two fronts: 1) because Maguire's organic webs have always seemed creepy to me, and 2) Peter's inventing the webshooters accentuates his brilliant knack for science. It's only been five years since the awful third Spidey picture, but CG technology has advanced even further. Spider-Man today is uncanny in how he moves and fights and poses. There are several dynamic poses he strikes in mid-swing that mimic Todd McFarlane's covers. Lastly, this Spidey is a nonstop wiseacre, exactly like how he is in the comics, exactly NOT like Tobey Maguire played him. At times Spidey's one-liners come off like the sort of snark indulged by that annoying, anonymous punk heckler hiding in the back. You can see why Spidey's jokes persistently get under his opponent's skin. Garfield's delivery is perfect. I wouldn't have minded another half hour of his thrashing (and insulting) a series of petty carjackers.

This reboot tweaks Spidey's mythology some. Instead of my telling you what the changes are, let me tell you what's not here. Spidey doesn't get to have that short-lived wrestling career, and, if you're down with Spidey's history, then you can figure out how that impacts his origin. There's no irradiated arachnid to bite our guy. No sighting of Mary Jane Watson or J. Jonah Jameson. And no one solemnly remarking: ""With great power must also come great responsibility."" Stan Lee is here, making his standard cameo.

One of my concerns was that the film had promised to explore the mystery behind Peter's parents' deaths. And it's true that his parents, in a tangible way, point Peter towards his crimefighting path. But the focus on the 'rents isn't as pronounced as I'd feared. But, yeah, their absence is keenly felt by their orphaned son. Note that this Peter Parker, while still a bullied nerd, exudes plenty of attitude. He's got a pretty sizable chip on his shoulder.

I love Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy, who in the comics is Peter's first true love (she preceded Mary Jane Watson). Already regarded as a hot up-and-comer, Stone's Gwen is no wilting damsel in distress. She's smart and supportive and contributes. I do wish that the film had better established how someone like Gwen could fall for a gawky, uneasy outcast like Peter. Stone and Garfield are so good in their scenes together that, at times, I forgot I was watching a superhero genre film; there are moments that feel like I'm in the middle of an indie romantic comedy. The awkward flirtation elicits big smiles. Gwen's hilarious hallway dialogue with her dad is priceless.

While entertaining as hells, this film isn't perfect. The plot doesn't feel organic. It's plagued by too many coincidences (Gwen's interning at Oscorp, one of the more glaring ones). And while I understand the suits' wanting to ensure that the lead's face gets full exposure, It's kinda ridiculous that Spidey would get unmasked on several occasions (okay, one of those times he voluntarily takes the mask off himself). And you know that old saw about how a hero is only as good as his villain? This villain is uncompelling. I don't know how much my aversion towards the Lizard is due to my not once ever liking him in the comics. But while Rhys Ifans knocked me for a loop by submitting a low-keyed performance, the moment he transforms into the marauding 9-foot-tall Lizard, his predictable villain motivation sunk it for me. Alfred Molina did the tortured big bad already, and better. I just lauded the CG work done on Spidey, so imagine the sheepishness when I say that the shaky CG rendering of the Lizard consistently took me out of the story. I wish those labcoat tatters had stayed on him. Maybe I would've bought it more.

Ultimately, this one's high on watchability but isn't as good as the first SPIDER-MAN movie or the superb SPIDER-MAN 2. But, if you're a Spidey fan, I think this reboot is very much worth a visit to your local movie theater (but skip the 3D). It's too bad that THE AVENGERS and THE DARK KNIGHT RISES are bogarting the spotlight. Else, THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN would be raking in even more green. As it is, it's viewed more as the spoiled meat in this summer's superhero cinematic sandwich. But see it anyway, for Garfield and Stone's performances and chemistry, and for Martin Sheen's turn as the wise and doomed Uncle Ben, and Denis Leary's no-nonsense take on NYPD Captain Stacy (who channels J. Jonah Jameson in labeling Spidey a menace). See this for a more dynamic Spidey and a more mouthy Spidey. It's nice to see the Queens come out of our friendly neighborhood webslinger.

You can stick around for the mid-credits scene. It's as vague as it is uninformative.",1341360000,4,5840,4.880040322580645
4423814,4,B004LWZWFQ,"I'm usually opposed to reboots, remakes, reconceptions, especially of Spiderman, which I didn't really think needed to be rebooted after the success of the Tobey Maguire ""Spiderman"" at least the first two, so I didn't think this movie wasn't necessary and it may not be necessary, but it is a good movie. ""The Amazing Spiderman"" feels more satisfying in the way of character and plot. The characters feel fuller and more thought out and the plot more filled out.

""The Amazing Spiderman"" covers some familiar territory, the origin story of Spiderman, from Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) high school science nerd, photographer and punching bag. This Spiderman ventures a bit into what happened to Peter's parents and why he's living with Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field), at first the family history of Peter's father being a scientist studying spiders and secret formulas gave me a bad feeling, the 2003 Ang Lee, Eric Bana, ""The Hulk"" bad, but those fears soon melted away as it was apparent ""The Amazing Spiderman"" wasn't going to make those same mistakes. ""The Amazing Spiderman"" does stay close to the outline of the Spiderman origin story, Peter Parker while visiting the laboratory at Oscorp is bitten by a genetically altered spider (changed from the atomically enhanced spider of the 60's, splicing genes from species to species is the new bug-a-boo), in the course of discovering his powers inadvertently causes the death of Uncle Ben by failing to stop a criminal.

Gone as the love interest is Peter's neighbor and unrequited love of MJ, replaced with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) who is as into Peter as he is into her, however awkward it may be. The relationship between Peter and Gwen feels a little more red blooded than Maquire's Peter and Kirsten Dunst's MJ, it may just be that Garfield/Stone have better chemistry than Maquire/Dunst, the relationship feels a little more natural.

The learning curve for Peter discovering his powers seems a little steeper than in earlier ""Spiderman's"" it seems there's more trial and error in the accumulations of powers and like the original cartoon Spiderman, Peter has to fashion his own webbing from his chemistry set.

Another carry over from other ""Spiderman's"" and other superhero movies in general, the superhero has a hand in creating his nemesis and Peter hands over a formula to Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) that creates The Lizard. Also from past ""Spiderman's"" is the theme of responsibility that comes with having powers (called talents in this go round) and this Spiderman has consequences, Peter keeps going home to Aunt May all beat up and has to come up with reasons why he's so beat up. He takes it seriously that he has to stop Connors even when Spiderman's powers and abilities may be outmatched by The Lizard's brute strength.

""The Amazing Spiderman"" is a darker Spiderman than we've seen before and that was another reason of concern, after all Batman was built for a dark Freudian tone while Spiderman isn't necessarily, look what happened when Spiderman went to the dark side in ""Spiderman 3"" it felt like unintended satire,  And to say nothing of ""Superman 3,"" maybe it's the third installment in a series that lends itself to going back to cartoon origins, that was the downfall of the Tim Burton's ""Batman"" movies, they relied more and more of the cartoon in tone.

It was also good to see good actors and acting in the supporting cast, up front is Dennis Leary as Captain Stacy, Campbell Scott as Peter Parker's flashback father, and C. Thomas Howell in a small but pivotal role.",1341360000,7,3575,4.908940397350993
4423815,4,B004LWZWFQ,"Amazing Spiderman

The film is not ""better"" than Tobey MacGuire's version of Spiderman in the first film; in fact it is not really a ""remake.""  It's a reimagined version.
What's best about this version?  The fact we return to the original Stan Lee(creator of the Spiderman mythos)/Steve Ditko (original artist) tale of a nerdy boy who falls for Gwen Stacy.  And like that original story, we have Captain Stacy, a kind Uncle Ben (played seriously by Martin Sheen) and a very sympathetic Aunt May (surprisingly well by Sally Field!).  We even get to see real web shooters!  (The organic shooters from the Ultimates never made sense to me - you'd run out of blood, right?  But I digress.)

Themes:

One theme is family.  The film starts with Richard and Mary Parker, Peter's real parents, and a mystery about their disappearance.  Did they really get killed in a crash?  Or is there something more?  It's fine that the film leaves me hanging, as it creates a mystery to see the next one, but man!
Another theme is obsession.  Peter, obsessed with the murder of his uncle, wanting that burglar, whom he actually did nothing when he could have caught him.  What's interesting though is that unlike the Raimi version, we don't actually get a closure on the burglar.  Another mystery!

And there is Curt Connors, who as the Lizard becomes obsessed with creating a race of lizard men (just like the comics - read it!).
Characterization:  The realism is great, and the emphasis is not so much on action (though there is  plenty of that) but on family, responsibility and knowing that you have a gift that you need to use it to help others.  Peter has a gift and he wanted to help others but so did the Lizard, in his own demented way.

Bottom Line:  I love a comics film that a general audience can understand without being familiar with the comics.  My philosophy has always been that a comics film has to appeal to a more general audience and not fan boys.  There were no Easter eggs for the fans in this film (but there was a fun scene with Stan Lee in a library), and I'm sure there will be Mary Jane fans wondering why she's not here.
Ditko's vision lives in this film.

Highly recommended.

Rhys Ifans was ok, although I didn't connect with him that much as a compelling character. Now this is MY feeling about this movie in my heart so I'm being honest to myself. When I see a movie, good, bad or in between, I feel what that particular movie is. I just could not fall in love with this movie like I did Raimi's. Well, the first two. This was far better than the third. To me, this movie lacked the charm of the first two of this franchise. Yes, this had a few more serious moments to make it real, but not enough to separate it from the originals. Contrary to some reviews I've read, the originals had their serious moments too. But I think they had more balance. Once again, 3 notwithstanding. Another issue being that this felt too familiar. Even Connors came off like Norman Osborne in the first Spiderman, but I was into Norman's character more. Spiderman has always been my number two favorite superhero behind Batman and followed by Superman in third. I think mainly this reboot was just too soon for me. I still think of and love the first two. And part 3 wasn't Batman & Robin bad that it needed a speedy remake like Batman needed and Superman NEEDS. But now that it's here, maybe a sequel can separate itself and become truly special. This didn't dazzle me like The Avengers and The Dark Knight Rises would really have to suck(I don't see that it will) to rank this above that epic. The Amazing Spiderman is a good time. Judge for yourself. Personally, besides the obvious being The Avengers and TDKR, the only other superhero movie I'm excited about is next year's new Superman movie, Man of Steel. If that movie succeeds, I can then die happy.",1341360000,3,1822,4.425595238095238
4423818,5,B004LWZWFQ,"MOVIE REVIEW #42: "" The Amazing Spider-Man ""

Wow...this is one reboot that's energized with a lot of action, suspense and feeling. Director Marc Webb (500 Days of Summer, Green Day Videos) did a great job in giving everyone in the audience a roller coaster ride of fun and energy. I didn't know what to expect - having the previous series of films ahead of this - but I think the franchise is in good hands.

The most impressive cast member is British actor (although born in Los Angeles but grew up in England) was Andrew Garfield (The Social Network, Doctor Who). His emotional range and angst for his parents, Uncle and his sweetheart....in relation to the super-human activities happening around him made the whole movie real for me. Riveting and passionate was Garfield and he has the acting chops to stand up and hold his own against some great talent in the film.

Now with cast like Sally Feld (Norma Ray, Brother & Sisters) as the compassionate and heartfelt Aunt May and Martin Sheen (Apocalypse Now, West Wing) as the very caring and father-figure-like Uncle Ben to the believable and driven performance of Dennis Leary (Rescue Me, Ice Age) and the Police Chief of New York who comes the realization the hard way the man in the red and blue spandex is not the enemy. Sally and Martin are amazing together and even more poignant when they're one-on-one with Garfield.

Throw in a believable teen romance with the smart minded Emma Stone (The Help, Zombieland) and now drop in a dabble of a highly-motivated super villain played by Rhys Iris (Notting Hill, Anonymous) and you a great two-hour ride with an origin story that keeps you glued to the screen!

Screen writers James Vanderbilt (Zodiac, The Losers), Alvin Sargent (Ordinary People, Spider-Man 2 &3) and Steve Kloves (All the Harry Potter films) did the most important thing any screenplay should do - they kept the characters at the forefront and the action/special effects are the trimmings. The performances stand out so very much that the fact I saw it in IMAX and 3D only added to the entire experience. Although just as good in the 2-D screen in this case the 3-D was used sparingly and in very effective places.

The story stays true to the original comic and keeps the fans in check - this modern take on the this Spider-Man is inventive, filled with technology but again, character driven first and foremost. Also of note is the style and colors of the costume for Spidey done brilliantly by Kym Barrett (The Matrix, Speed Racer). It works on many levels and makes Garfields' performance that much more believable. Also, the costumes for Spidey were actually constructed by the creative geniuses of Cirque Du Soleil.

Another thing that I noticed and thoroughly enjoyed was the score by James Horner (Star Trek II:TWOK & III:TSFS, Titanic) - the super-hero theme is back - and it's not in your face, but you knew the web slinger was at his best with the subtle but spot-on `hero theme' he had.

The movie is suspenseful, has `high' action, incredible effects and stunts - flawless CGI effects and was a crowd pleaser all the way around. It's fun for the whole family so leap out of your balcony to a theatre near you!",1341360000,9,3195,4.70304114490161
4423819,2,B004LWZWFQ,"Has it been only ten years since Sam Raimi made the first and best of the Spider-man movies?  Clearly, Sony wanted to keep their billion dollar franchise going, and keep raking in the money.  When Raimi found himself unable to deliver a version of Spider-man 4 that he could live with, Sony abruptly decided to pull the plug on him and the rest of the original cast of characters and do a reboot instead.

Ecce ""The Amazing Spider-man"", a poor effort.  The fact that Sony chose to redo the origin story of Spider-man all over again so close to Raimi's masterpiece makes comparisons to the original inevitable, and such a comparison shines a harsh  light on the weak plot and character development and departures from the canonical history of Spider-man in this new version.  The end result is like putting a ""paint by numbers"" version of the Mona Lisa next to the real thing at the Louvre.

The movie does have some attractive and very capable actors - people who have done well in other movies.  Unfortunately, they just don't belong in their roles in this movie, and contrast poorly with their counterparts in the Raimi series.  Let's go through the list:

Andrew Garfield has been great in other movies, but he is just too cocky and sure of himself to be as good of a Peter Parker as Toby Maguire, who totally captured the essence of the sweet, awkward, nerdy, and angst ridden Peter Parker.  Toby Maguire is and will always be the definitive Peter Parker in my book.

Emma Stone, a cute and terrific actress (in other movies) and normally a dark brunette.  For some bizarre reason she got shoehorned into the role of Gwen Stacy, and the result is ... not Gwen Stacy.  Emma Stone's dark hair shows through the bleach in almost every scene.  Gwen was a true blonde, Peter Parker's great love, and Spider-man's damsel in distress.  Gwen was not a rocket scientist, Gwen was taller, slimmer, model-quality beautiful, one of the most beautiful girls in the  Marvel Universe.  She was there to make adolescent boys gawk at her and buy Marvel Comics, and she was there to break Spider-man's heart, when inevitably, she died as a result of his battles with his arch enemy the Green Goblin.  She was not there to prove that girls are smarter than boys nor to show why more girls go to college and get advanced degrees than boys.  In Raimi's version, Bryce Dallas Howard (normally a blondish red head, bleached to a convincing blonde for the role) was much truer to the comic book vision of Gwen Stacy than this Emma Stone version.  Sorry, I really do like Emma Stone as an actress, but SHE...IS...JUST...NOT...GWEN...STACY.

Martin Sheen as Uncle Ben is also just totally wrong.  Martin Sheen does intense and slightly nuts characters really well (i.e. ""Apocalypse Now"", his best role ever).  He isn't really convincing as a kind but firm Uncle Ben, and this reboot has Uncle Ben just dripping with a false gooey sweetness.  Cliff Robertson was great on the other hand as Uncle Ben, playing the role just right.  Uncle Ben was a pillar of moral strength, which doesn't really come through in this reboot.  Cliff Robertson, the man who played presidents (JFK), and who got blacklisted in Hollywood for five years for blowing the whistle on embezzlers at Columbia Pictures, yep, he had the moral authority to play Uncle Ben, not the father of Charlie Sheen.

The Flying Nun, er, Sally Fields, as Aunt May!  Omigod.  Aunt May had white hair, and was tall and skinny and solemn, and didn't nag so much.  Couldn't they at least get the white hair part right and make Sally Fields stop dyeing her hair? She's 66 years old this year for goodness sake.  Sally Fields is just too perky and whiny and too young-looking to be a good Aunt May.  Rosemary Harris was much closer to the comic book vision of Aunt May than Sally Fields.

Denis Leary as Captain Stacy - Leary does hard boiled, foul-mouthed, blue collar characters really well.  That is so not Captain Stacy, however.  James Cromwell, on the other hand, in Raimi's version, was perfect as Captain Stacy, and even looked exactly like the comic book character.

Finally, Rhys Ifans as Dr. Curt Connors/Lizard.  ARG!  Dr. Connors is an American! Not a Brit, or Welsh (Ifans)!!  Why change this?  Dylan Baker did a fine job as the original Dr. Connors in a series of tantalizing scenes with Toby Maguire in Spider-man 3, which were very much closer to the comic book history.  In this reboot, Rhys Ifans portrays Dr. Connors as a stuffy British scientist working for Oscorp, and his character development and plot line interactions with Peter Parker don't make much sense.

Peter Parker's parents appear in this reboot, but the movie wastes this opportunity to explore a piece of Peter Parker's origins by completely twisting up that story also and wrapping it into the origin story of the Lizard.  And what's worse, the resulting plot line makes no sense either.  It's like the Sony screenwriters were sitting around and decided, hey, let's throw Peter's parents into this movie!  They die in a plane crash just like in the comics!  But let's keep it simple and tie them to the origin of the Lizard!  Huh?

Missing from this reboot are other characters wonderfully fleshed out in Raimi's version of the Spider-man universe, like James Jonah Jameson, and Betty Brant, and of course Mary Jane.  Remember them?  (Betty Brant is now in the Hunger Games as Effie Trinket).  Another ""Huh?"" moment - the Flash character in this reboot mysteriously becomes a buddy of Peter Parker after being totally humiliated in the gym by Peter.  Right.

A math formula somehow is the key to solving the DNA-genetics-cell regeneration and differentiation puzzle that produces the Lizard?  Huh?  Please, some of us in the movie audience have gone to college and know a little bit about cellular biology.

So there you go, besides doing a poor match of actors to comic book characters, besides doing a much worse job of re-enacting the origin story of Spider-man, besides multiple plot holes and ""Huh?"" moments, Spider-man fans should be disturbed that the movie totally distorts the canonical history of Spider-man.  Raimi, a lifelong Spider-man comic book fan, knew his stuff, and was far more true to the comic book vision.  The folks at Sony who hijacked this franchise away from Sam Raimi don't know what they are doing, and this reboot fundamentally lacks the heart and soul and depth of insight about the Spider-man universe that Raimi's movies had.

And so they are well on their way to wrecking this franchise.  There is still a huge amount of interest and goodwill from fans of Raimi's Spider-man's movies, and this reboot is likely to do well as a result.  The movies to follow may also do well, much like George Lucas's appalling trio of prequels to his Star Wars franchise.  I may even go see them, like I did the awful Star Wars prequels,  or rent them on Netflix, but it will be mostly out of morbid curiosity, like watching a train wreck, a fascinating deconstruction of a beloved franchise.",1341273600,19,7025,4.744224422442244
4423820,4,B004LWZWFQ,"""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a well-acted, well-produced, and well-directed origin story of the Wall Crawler.  It features an interesting villain and good special effects.

After having just watched the movie, however, I cannot help but wonder about two things:

1.  Why was this movie made when we had a very good Spider-Man origin movie just 10 years ago (a movie, I might add, that covered much of the same ground as this movie)?

2.  What might have we gotten if Sony and Sam Raimi had put aside their creative differences (which date back to the third movie, when the producers essentially forced Raimi to include Venom in the film) and produced a fourth film in an amazingly (no pun intended) successful series of ""Spider-Man"" films?

Point One: it is only a minor spoiler to say that ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" covers many of the plot points that Sam Raimi's 2002 film did- specifically, high school student Peter Parker getting bitten by a radioactive spider, learning to use his powers, learning a lesson about great power and great responsibility, and fighting a supervillain who threatens NYC.

While I knew that this film would be a reboot, I hoped the writers would introduce some unexpected elements into the origin story.  This is not the case.  In fact, beyond being a reboot, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" comes dangerously close to being a REMAKE of Raimi's 2002 original film in certain parts.  How?  Well, let's consider what the new film has in common with the 2002 original Spidey movie (minor spoilers):

a.  Peter Parker in high school bullied by Flash Thompson?  Check.
b. Peter bitten by the radioactive spider while on a science trip for his school?  Check.
c. Peter selfishly letting a crook go, resulting in Uncle Ben being killed? Check.
d. Spider-Man fighting a quasi-father figure supervillain (who even hears voices in his head after undergoing a transformation, a la Norman Osborn in the original film)?  Check.
e. Peter tearfully deciding to let go of his love interest after a funeral at the end of the movie?  Quasi-check (see the movie to decide this one for yourself).

The one twist that the movie attempts to introduce is that of Peter's parents, and what became of them when they left Peter with Ben and May Parker.  However, after devoting the first 10 minutes of the movie to Peter's parents, they are mostly forgotten and hardly mentioned the rest of the movie.

It has been reported that Sony apparently had to make a Spider-Man movie or else risk losing the franchise to Disney/Marvel.  It is difficult to say for certain that this affected the production of the movie, but certain elements of the film do have a perfunctory feel to them- for example, the aftermath of Uncle Ben's murder (no funeral or discussion about the event by Peter and Aunt May), or the transformation of Dr. Connors into the Lizard.

I take nothing away from the fine acting of Andrew Garfield (who makes a good Spider-Man) or Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy, or the directing by Marc Webb.  They put in solid work; it is just a shame that they were not- at least in this first movie- given the opportunity to add something new to the Spider-Man film universe.

Point Two:  while promoting the movie, the producers have repeatedly said their first preference was to make a fourth movie with Raimi and Tobey Maguire, but that ""there was no story"" and that the ""trilogy had run its course.""

Hogwash.

Spider-Man 4 had script drafts commissioned by James Vanderbilt, David Lindsay-Abaire, Gary Ross, and- just as the film was cancelled- veteran Spidey writer Alvin Sargent.  Apparently Raimi and the producers had decided on the Vulture as the villain, and it was reported that discussions had begun with John Malkovich to play him.

Sony: are you seriously telling us that, between all of the scripts that had been commissioned, with 50 years of comics for inspiration, with the creativity of a Sam Raimi as your director, that a good story/script couldn't have been cobbled together for a fourth movie?  Please.

With an interesting villain in the Vulture, the continuing of the Peter Parker/Spider-Man story as he entered his early to mid 30's, and perhaps even finally marrying Mary Jane Watson (which had been hinted at in Spider-Man 3), a fourth Spider-Man movie would have likely been an interesting and unique addition to the overall Spider-Man story that had been carefully built up over the course of three movies.

What we got instead was a perfectly decent (even good) movie, and yet a movie that was too......familiar.

Still, I give this movie 4 out of 5 stars, but hope we get a new and different story in the next Spidey movie.",1341273600,8,4648,4.819672131147541
4423821,4,B004LWZWFQ,"The Amazing Spider-Man is less cheese and more gritty than Sam Raimi's trilogy. Kind of like Nolan's Batman films compared to the two non Tim Burton ones that came before them. I like Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone better than Tobey and Kirsten and I felt this movie really showcased Spider-Man's acrobatic fighting style. The fight scene with The Lizard villain in the school was just as good as any action scene in The Avengers. The CGI looked great in IMAX 3-D.

Now I do agree that this is more of a remake than a reboot, but there are enough differences to at least make you feel like you are watching a new take on a familiar story.

I was very close to giving this 5 stars, but I think that will have to wait until that bat rises on July 20th.",1341273600,4,750,4.274647887323944
4423822,2,B004LWZWFQ,"Why?

That was the thought that hounded over me during the entire development of Sony's reboot of the live action trilogy that had grossed enough money to fill up Central Park several times over, and had been critically acclaimed as one of the best superhero film trilogies ever (though your millage may vary on the third film).  It seemed an insane idea to reboot such a juggernaut of a franchise, and start over from scratch, taking Peter back to high school, which has always worked out well before (cough cough One More Day cough cough).  So it was with that annoyed mindset that I waited to see how the Amazing Spider-Man would turn out, and whether we would have emo/anguished Peter swinging across New York while wailing that nobody loves him and that his parents are dead and the world sucks.

And now, five years after Raimi's trilogy concluded, I finally got to see if Sony had indeed made a really stupid decision, or if they had been right to start fresh.  And as the credits rolled, I sat back in my seat, pondered, and came to the conclusion that....yeah, Sony had jumped the gun.

In this telling of Spider-Man, young Peter Parker grows up with his Aunt May and Uncle Ben and...oh, you know how this goes.  High school, bullies, high tech lab, genetically altered spider-bite, super powers, suit, beat up bad guys, etc, etc, etc.  And in a way, this is ""Amazing""'s biggest fault: there's simply no reason to go over any of this.  We've seen Spider-Man's origins before.  We know how he became a hero.  We know Ben is going to die, and that Peter will put on the suit and go fight crime.  He did that back in 2002, and there was no need to do it again, especially when the first did it so well.  I can see people saying that this is Spider-Man for a new generation, much like how ""Batman Begins"" is different from the 1960's ""Batman"", but both those films have completely different tones, and feel like they take place in different worlds.  ""Amazing"" feels like it could easily take place in the world of Raimi's film, and doesn't do much of anything to differentiate the two, which only further adds to the feeling of ""Been there, done that.""

But while this telling of Spider-Man's origins is similar to the original, there was a much hyped ""Untold Story"" that would explore different aspects of Peter that we haven't seen before, mainly focusing on his parents, who mysteriously went missing when he was a little boy.  That's a neat idea, and opens up new avenues for the film to pursue.  But nope, this untold story doesn't even get told.  It's said that Peter's dad was working on genetic experimenting, and that some parties don't want Peter to know about other aspects of his life, but that's pretty much it.  There's no secret revelation that Peter's parents were crime-fighting ninjas from the moon, or that Peter was grown in a test tube in Atlantis, or anything of the type.  By the time the film was half over, I had completely forgotten about the supposed secrets that we were promised, and by the end, none of it even matters.  Even Peter himself seems to completely forget that his parents ever existed, and never pursues their disappearance again.

Every film so far has had great villains, but ""Amazing"" breaks the trend.  While the appearance of the Lizard (AKA Curt Conners) was hinted at in the previous two films, we finally get to see him here, and unfortunately, he looks like a goomba who wandered off the set of the Super Mario Brothers movie.  And while previous villains had compelling motivations, the Lizard is the weakest one yet, having only the goal of creating an entire race of lizard people.  While on some levels it's understandable (Conners talks about wanting to eliminate perfection in the human race), I thought it felt like an excuse to set up the big final fight.

I also felt that, despite almost 5 years of advances in effects work, the CGI in ""Amazing"" felt obvious every time I saw it.  The Lizard himself is done well (especially when he looses body parts that subsequently grow back), but everything else felt fake to me, especially an underwater sequence that I didn't buy for even a second (it also doesn't help that all Peter's web-swinging scenes are at night, which leads to endless shots of colored windows swinging around the screen).  And while James Horner normally does great work, his music here feels unfocused, and at times feels like it should be in a different film altogether.

Now, I may be coming down hard on ""Amazing,"" but it had huge shoes to fill (that had already been filled before).  It's simply unnecessary in almost every way.  It has no real reason to exist.  While the little details are different (Gwen instead of Mary Jane, Peter working with Conners instead of being a photographer, etc.), I feel that Raimi's films just did everything better.  Take Peter's motivation for becoming Spider-Man: in the original, Uncle Ben's famous advice on great power and great responsibility, along with Peter's guilt at not being able to save him, and using his powers selfishly, gives him a solid reason to become Spider-Man and fight crime.  In ""Amazing,"" Uncle Ben gives a weaker speech about responsibility and doing good, then dies.  Peter gets angry, creates the costume, and beats up bad guys while trying to find Ben's killer (whom he forgets about as well...does this Peter Parker have brain damage?).  Also, compare Peter's motivation to go after the bad guy.  In the original, Peter went after the Green Goblin, because he had tried to kill Aunt May, and was threatening to kill the love of his life.  Here, Peter goes after Conners because of guilt he has in that he helped create him...a guilt which I hadn't seen before.  It just feels subpar.

In the end, I can't give ""Amazing"" a failing grade, because, for all it's faults, it's not a terrible movie.  It's competently put together, with good production values.  It's not terrible, just disappointing.  I felt that everything here has already been done, and done better.  Ben's death was handled better.  Peter's motivations were handled better.  The villains were handled better.  This was a tale that didn't need to be told, and I think it's the weakest Spider-Man film yet.  It's like a book that's been slightly re-written and given a new cover.  You might be fooled for a little bit, but you'll end up saying, ""I've already read this before.  A few things are different, but why would I want to read it again when I want something new?""",1341273600,22,6488,4.693191865605659
4423823,5,B004LWZWFQ,"There are only so many ways you can tell a superhero story, especially through a movie and you have the dodgy task of taking a popular superhero with the elements of his story try to breathe new life into it and adapt it to the big screen in a way that can reach a wide audience; families, kids, teenagers, adults and generations while at the same time making it appeal to the die hard superfans and collectors. This is the hard task that the 2012 reboot of the Spider-Man franchise The Amazing Spider-Man is attempting to achieve.

Superhero films have received a revival in interest new since the first decade of the new millennium and throughout the 2000's to the current day. It's become a popular trend in Hollywood and already we've seen plenty of superheros head to the big screen; some with great mainstream success at the box office (X-Men, Spider-Man, Batman) and some poorly received (Daredevil, Superman Returns, Green Lantern). Spider-man is one of those superhero characters that caught on most as a movie franchise and was successful enough to spawn two sequels. The trilogy of Spidey films of the 00's was mostly well received but when attempts of re-singing actors for a fourth title failed there was only two options: 1) Give up on making more Spider-Man films in the near foreseeable future or 2) Get some fresh faces to replace the already established actors and come up with an alternate take on the story of one of the greatest Marvel characters and superheroes of all time. This reboot is a different Spider-man altogether and in this case it's actually a good thing. Garfield as Spider-Man was what was going to make or break this movie and his Peter Parker is a fresh one with slight twists that I think audiences will approve of. The retelling of the Spiderman story works here because they did an actual reboot, using the same characters and comic universe but it's a different take it's obviously not a remake yet it's not a re-imagining either being that this character has already plenty of history to chose from. If you watched any of the 3 previous ones you will be able to tell that the angle and tone they have here are very different. The back story already is quite different, they explain more about Peter Parker's parents, in this one his love interest is Gwen Stacy not Mary Jane Watson (and very different from the Gwen Stacy we saw in 2007's Spider-Man 3 too), the villain (Dr. Curtis ""Curt"" Conors/The Lizard), the way the events happen (how Peter gains his powers etc.) is not quite the same and the way its presented is unique which is all a plus in my book.

A lot of us were wondering how Andrew Garfield (The Social Network) would fare as the lead role compared to Tobey McGuire (as if there weren't going to be any comparisons) and that it would directly make the biggest impact on the fate (and perhaps sequels) of this reboot. I must say I was impressed. MacGuire was cast for the trilogy of Spider-Man films from 2002-07 and I think most would say Tobey pulled off the job really well, came off as likeable and people tend to identify him in his role of the spandex web-slinger. Looking back McGuire was suitable and a good choice for the role but Garfield brings something else to the table, portrays the role different with more flair, more attitude. Not as shy and innocent as Macguire's portrayal of Spidey. Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man you can sense from the get-go is in ways better or improved on MacGuire's if comparisons must be made. He doesn't look as weak, is a bit more like the High-Schooler you would imagine, has the smart comments, is more aggressive and is taller and fills the suit better. Enough has been said, Garfied makes a rather convincing Peter Parker, student and Peter Parker as the masked hero. Those are both different Spider-Man overall, different takes on the same character and each have their positives but in the end I think I'd take Garfied over McGuire any day (no disrespect to Tobey intended I thought his take on the role was excellent and certainly put his stamp on the character). Emma Stone was very believable as Gwen Stacy and has that edge of the character she portrays and she looks the part, she has actual chemistry with Garfield and although we know her more for her comedy acting roles (Superbad, House Bunny, Easy A and others) she has no problem playing a more serious role and I could well see her do more of this type of acting. Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Fields) were nicely cast although I had grown very fond of the actors who played them in the trilogy of Spidey films and thought they were more effective than they are here. Rhys Ifanswas fantastic as Dr. Curt Conors/The Lizard and although there are lots of special effects for his transformation to being the Lizard I thought the human counterpart was played quite well and made his background story come through nicely. Also notable was Denis Leary as Captain George Stacy, Gwen's father.

The fighting and action scenes are probably the greatest improvements over the first 3 titles. Not that it was bad in any of those films but the way they captured the action in this one was fantastic and simply superior and are bad-er and mean-er. Those sequences were well executed which is important in a superhero movie. The stunts came off looking somewhat less surreal yet amazing to watch. Instead of the hero shooting web from his wrists they go back to the original story with the artificial web-shooters which was a good idea. We even manage to feel something for the villain and the Lizard's backstory was always one of my favorites and the character looks fantastic on the big screen with details and texture; this is one cool looking villain, I cannot imagine Lizard being done better. I was very happy when they chose Kurt Conors as the villain and the result turned out fantastic, at least they didn't take one of the previously seen villains for this first chapter in the cinematic saga. Not that I'm against using a previous bad guy again but someone else was a good choice to begin. Something that I thought was particularly great is that we saw Peter Parker as a child a further glimpse at what made him who he is. In fact the first few minutes are of an ""origin of Peter Parker"" scene that gives the viewer more insight on the character. What they did with the story, the hero, the villain, the romance, the stunts is commendable, especially considering that this is taking an already successful movie franchise and trying to revive and do something different yet interesting with it that would keep fans an moviegoers excited about it.

On a quick note I don't have much to say on the film's 3D probably because while it's not bad, it's not a big presence and the focus was mostly on the story and as a result there are very few times when the 3D stands out in any way.

There are similarities between this film and the original Spider-Man but there is plenty of differences too (there's only so much you can change) and it doesn't come off as watching the same movie twice this series is moving forwards. Ultimately the fans will decide how this film will go down in movie history (and superhero movie history). All I have to say is I got my money and time's worth with The Amazing Spiderman, I was certainly not disappointed, I was pleasantly surprised and found it very enjoyable; definitely worthy of the ""Summer Blockbuster"" title. It think it's safe to say that the ""amazing"" in the title very well reflects the viewing experience as a whole and that this is one that fans and non-fans will enjoy.

8435107,2,B004LWZWFQ,"I have two big issues with this film:

1) Why make a remake of a film that isn't so old? They only waited 12 years between both first films (and the time lapse feels even less). If they had made this remake a 180 degree fully different retelling, maybe it would have been more interesting for me. However, they repeat a lot of the high school angst and bullying from the original film, but without the amazing chemistry offered by Tobey Macguire, Kirsten Dunst and James Franco. It's the same issue I felt with the third X-Men film Apocalypse. They decide to reunite the original X-Men cast as teenagers and retell the same bullying with teen angst story instead of focusing on the far more interesting stories of Professor X, Magneto, Mystique and Moira. Had the original film been made in the mid 90's like Batman, the special effects and vibe would have felt fresh rather than too much of a carbon copy.

2) The movie is a mess. Okay, Christopher Nolan did a fabulous job doing an edgier retake of Batman. He strayed away from the comical Adam West tv series and the kitschy (but still a guilty pleasure) of the 1990's Michael Keaton films. I won't even mention the horrid George Clooney flick. However, there was this wholesomeness of Tobey's films that I will always enjoy. He's soecially awkward and feels guilty about his unwitting participation in his uncle's death. He chooses to make up for it by trying to be a decent superhero that takes lots of selfies to pay for his college education. This film wishes to create a more morally ambiguous Spiderman that doesn't seem all that iggered about Uncle Ben's demise. It just didn't sit well with me. I feel like this was only worsened because the original film is still too recent and in people's memories so they will be compared.

There are some decent scenes in the film, but the special effects, predictable plot and all-around vibe of the movie was a huge let down. Fortunately, I didn't see this movie in theaters.",1526083200,,1976,4.6239316239316235
