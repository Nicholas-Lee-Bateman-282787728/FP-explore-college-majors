8263825,5,B0016OOD70,"David Attenborough takes us on the Wildebeest migration. The use various Spy Cams to bring us up close to these animals in ways we have never seen before.
It follows a mother and calf from the calf's birth, till the time it leaves it's mother when they return to the area where it was born, and where she delivers the next calf. The first calf has it's first calf after several years.
Me guess is that several mother's and their calls make up this documentary.

It shows that mother and calf need to bond quickly, and need to recognise each other by sound, smell etc
This helps them find each other if they get lost.
The you infant manages to evade its's first predator attack.

It is soon parted from its mother, and this lasts over a day from memory.
Either the calf finds it's mother or it dies.both the calf looks for it's mother and she diligently looks for her calf-- yes they reunite.
If they didn't no other wildebeest would adopt the calf, even if it had lost it's own.

What do you need your mother for.
She is your personal guide to a very complex migration with many dangers. You stay close by her side and this helps you face obstacles you have never faced before including crossing fast flowing rivers-- picking the best place to cross and other rivers full of hungry crocodiles.
Early on she provides milk . Later the young calf gets to eat more and more grass.

The two disc set follow calf and mother for about the first the first six months.
The calf is an initial tan colour and has no horns.
By 6 month it is black and has short horns.
Mother's has thinner, curved horns. You don't get to see much of males, except for mating on the run.
The males have thicker curved horns with a prominent forehead boss.

In the second disc there are several river crossing to get to The Masi Masathe back to the Serengeti
The rivers are truely treacherous.
In some the current is swift is fast. Wildebeest came swim but calf and mother can be exhausted by a hard crossing. Other time they cross at one point and on the other side there is no easy way out, with the banks going up  20plus feet vertically. There is a small way out further down , but with all the Wilder west crossing flat out it causes lots of problems. Some drown, and others get injuries inthe attempt to get though the choke point and up the bank.
Lions are there to get the weak or injured

One could go on.
The use of the Spy cams gave unpaired led insight. I cannot remember which cameras they were as I have been looking a a number on my DVD 's that use Spy Cams and they have got a bit mixed up in my head.
