2894708,5,B000T4SX92,The point of these DVD's are the images of sacred sites - which are 5-star.  The naration is forgetable.,1203033600,12,104,4.473684210526316
2894709,4,B000T4SX92,"There are many beautiful places and people to enjoy here. I bought this to transport me from my living room to exotic lands to experience different cultures and customs. This set delivers. Although it primarily shows Buddhist temples, monks and other related sites, there is no philosophy being preached here, it is a simple journey through gorgeous lands. Don't worry about any religious overtones, there are none. Some of the tribal people are so colorfully dressed and ornamented, I never would have guessed that is what they wear.

The films do suffer from technical difficulties - jerky and inappropriate camera movement (Photography 101 Never use Zoom), segments better left on the cutting room floor (for example the first film had to show us the boatman taking us upriver, but the 8 or 9 seconds were badly done as the boatman eludes us), better editing probably could have fixed most of the problems I saw, there were minor sound problems, and the change in narrators is uncomfortable. I enjoyed the last narration best as it included the film maker and guests who had something to add to the narration. Generally I don't think the narration is that strong, it's kind of an ordinary monotone overview, nothing particularly entertaining or educational. It doesn't add much to a scene to say ""the morning sun shines over the river"" when you show the morning sun shining over a river. There were many questions that filled my mind as the camera went from place to place, but unfortunately they weren't answered.

The package is marked ""letterboxed"", but that's only partially correct: the first two discs are 4:3 or ""full"" screen format, only the last is widescreen format.

I really appreciate the ability to turn off narration, which I did after the first viewing, now I only listen to the music and marvel at the sights presented. The music is varied and adds much, it is especially effective in surround sound. The bonus video of Vajra Realm did not impress me and seems a meandering and pointless addition.

Overall the package is nicely done and should interest any armchair traveler who wants to see Buddhist temples and ceremonies of Southeast Asia, Laos, Thailand, Burma, Bali, Cambodia, Java, and Central Tibet. Some of the temples are truly amazing in size and detail, and the lands surrounding can be breathtaking.",1199145600,16,2332,4.941326530612245
2894710,5,B000T4SX92,"I am still arriving back from this incredible journey. The 3 dvds let filmmaker John Bush reveal this epic journey over 4.5 hours while visiting the most amazing temples, villages, caves, mountains and rivers in so many different places in Asia. I was particularly moved by the Burma and Tibet segments as there is so much difficulty there, while the people are so beautiful and their cause is so just.

These are not the usual talking heads type documentaries but more intuitive,spontaneous and revealing. We follow the camera into rare and seldom seen places and hear the legends and spiritual significance of each place. I was particularly impressed by the music which seemed very well suited to each scene and added to the dramatic structure. David Hykes' harmonic chants are hypnotic. There is a huge amount of the local music that is extraordinary and which I have never heard before. Each dvd has two viewing choices - with a narrator and with just music and sound. I look forward to this one.

While I know something about Buddhism I was relieved that the films do not have any sectarian biases - you do not have to be a Buddhist to ""get"" what John Bush is offering here. He presents it all in an informed but universal way that is quite engaging. There is something noble in seeing the grandeur and simplicity of these Asian venues dedicated to nothing but the discovery of wisdom & compassion.

The voiceover narration works fine - I would have preferred to hear the people speak sometimes, but I guess it would have to be translated anyway.
All in all it is a remarkable way to see so much of spiritual Asia in a short amount of time. I truly recommend this set.",1193011200,52,1673,4.626262626262626
2894711,3,B000T4SX92,"These DVDs are a tour of south east Asian Buddhist temples---some still in use, others not.  The second DVD deals mostly with Hindu groups in Indonesia.  That really confused me.  If one knows nothing of Buddhism, don't expect to learn much from these DVDs.  There are, however, some little tib bits of Buddhist practice scattered in the narration.",1192838400,22,348,4.948275862068965

2894713,3,B000T4SX92,Somehow it seemed different from what was on Netflex. Less mystical. I was disappointed,1404432000,,87,5.285714285714286
2894714,5,B000T4SX92,"Exceptional in everyway. Good definition and beautiful scenes, Lots of variety. Very relaxing. Great Value. Definitely a keeper. Strongly recommend.",1403827200,,148,6.45
2894715,5,B000T4SX92,The Journey into Buddhism Trilogy is very profound.  I would highly recommend it to anyone seeking more knowledge on the history of Buddhism.  It soothes the soul!,1389657600,,163,5.0
2894716,5,B000T4SX92,"Very well done.  if you want to know more about Buddhism this is the one to run across your DVD player.  It has Sharon Stone as
narrator in one of the segments.  It is well done.  We especially liked the part about Tibet.  Great footage and wonderful music.",1380672000,,257,4.270833333333333
2894717,5,B000T4SX92,We saw this first on Netflix instant and enjoyed it so much we bought the DVD. I never tire of watching it.,1379030400,,107,3.909090909090909
2894718,5,B000T4SX92,My husband and I originally saw these shows on Net Flix and he insisted we get them so we can use their guidance to plan our own trip.,1376784000,,134,3.8214285714285716
2894719,5,B000T4SX92,"I discovered much of the wonder found in this collection already within me.  For anyone looking for answers in simplicity, grace and compassion, I encourage them to watch and listen.  Perhaps the answers for them can be found in this collection. I have watched the DVDs a few times and each time I find something else....in them...in me.  Strange how messages come to us from never dreamed of places.",1376352000,,400,4.768115942028985

2894721,5,B000T4SX92,"I am always embracing any way to expand my spiritual mind.  Watching and learning calms my mind and heart. Vajra Sky was disconcerting as it reminded me of the Mao's communist invasion and slaughter of the Chinese Buddhist.  The slaughter and destruction of Buddhist temples and it's followers during the Chinese invasion of Tibet.  When I had the heart to continue watching it was easier to see how it was all part of bringing back Buddhism to the Chinese and to the western world, rather than remaining solely in Tibet.  I'm working on forgiving the Chinese government for spiriting away the family and the present Dali Lama's choice for his successor. The Chinese government's arrogance in choosing a replacement without respect for the Buddhists and this ancient tradition, does still affect me...reality:  it's part of the Devine plan's bigger picture!",1373155200,,857,5.0928571428571425
2894722,5,B000T4SX92,"This  is  a  3  disc  set  which covers  some  of  the  Hindu culture  that  predates  Buddhism ,  it's  practice  throughout  South East  Asia  and  a  whole  disc  on  Tibetan Buddhism .
The  filming  is  gorgeous  and  is  almost  a  form  of  meditation  just  watching  it .",1362182400,,279,4.282608695652174
2894723,5,B000T4SX92,"These 3 remarkable films were created to induce an inner journey and will do just that, if you are open to it. Some reviewers wish there was more info, history or dogma but all of this is available in countless books. This set achieves something else, an intuitive pilgrimage into remarkable Buddhist cultures that also allows one to go deeply inside oneself. They are meditations themselves and filmmaker John Bush has created a new kind of viewing experience that feels transformative.

Visually stunning imagery along with sacred music from each culture and harmonic chant take the viewer not only into exotic Buddhist locales but on a personal journey of surprising intimacy - a new genre of spiritual cinema. You can watch them several times over and they always yield something more.  The pace of the film is contemplative and plays with time to create a mesmerizing effect.",1343347200,,880,4.979591836734694
2894724,1,B000T4SX92,A trilogy of a journey into Buddhism that goes nowhere near India is very strange and disappointing to me. I should have read more carefully before wasting my money on these dvds. Its like making a series on the Roman Catholic Church and not going to the Vatican.,1327363200,3,263,4.5
2894725,5,B000T4SX92,"This is a wonderful movie.  It gives insight on what Buddism is all about.  For folks who are not sure what they want, this is a good movie to watch.",1325721600,,149,3.933333333333333
2894726,5,B000T4SX92,"This is a fantastic meditative inspired production.  I first watched them on TV a few years back, then recently I ordered my own set so I could watch them whenever I wish.  I have just watched them again on my laptop & am just amazed.  I truly love this!",1304121600,,254,4.142857142857143
2894727,5,B000T4SX92,"I've watched each movie in the Trilogy more than once, and will watch each one again in the future.  The narrative is a work of art all in itself, as is the cinematography.  Each time I view them together, it's a new experience.  The director is a student of Tibetan culture who makes no pretense or even an attempt at mastery.  Something that took thousands of years to develop cannot be undone in one or two generations.  Nor can it be packaged for Western consumption.  The Trilogy is simple, and sublime.  I liken it to playing a jazz instrument among musicians who make no judgment about my level of expertise or readiness.",1291852800,2,628,4.553571428571429
2894728,2,B000T4SX92,A waste of money. I should of just rented the DVDs from netflix before buying it. It is really boring,1284163200,3,101,4.1
2894729,5,B000T4SX92,"I like the first line of the description.  ""For anyone interested in alternative spiritual traditions""  Alternative Spiritual Traditions?  Buddhism pre-dates Christianity by 600 years and has the SECOND largest following.  I suppose the reviewer had better things to do when it came to knowing anything about religions and just assumes his is ""the only true religion"".  Wow, what balls.

I give the film 5-stars, I give the idiot reviewer a minus 5 for insulting maybe a billion people.",1275782400,13,486,5.166666666666667
2894730,5,B000T4SX92,This series is an excellent overview of the various types of Buddhism with wonderful video of the various areas.  Is awsome,1269648000,2,123,4.857142857142857
2894731,5,B000T4SX92,"Do not miss this experience. I really did not know what to expect with this collection and came away completely in awe. There is so much going on here: travel to extraordinary lands, Buddhist teachings, a hypnotic soundtrack of chant and Asian music and an informed respect for the spiritual cultures we are seeing.

The cinematography is world class and gets into very intimate and privileged places within these many sacred places. The 3 dvds offer penetrating journeys into the spiritual realms of Thailand, Laos. Burma, Cambodia, Bali, Java  and traditional Tibet. The narration is minimal, poetic and at times mildly academic. The words do have a real feeling of allegory and while describing exotic cultures still felt deeply personal to me and my life.

The filmmaker, John Bush, shows no religious bias and the dvds are excellent for Buddhists, travelers or anyone simply interested in discovering these worlds seldom seen. I highly recommend this collection. They stand repeated viewing and have enough depth to keep revealing more.",1208736000,21,1041,5.184523809523809
