8097712,5,B000CCZWZO,"Very informative.  Excellent training methods for the contacts.  Really think her moving ""wait"" command is a great idea.  We've been using her methods with great results.  She has border collies, understands them and works well with all temperaments of her dogs.",1359244800,,262,5.317073170731708
8097713,5,B000CCZWZO,"This DVD pretty much teaches an independent ""Wait"" on or below the contacts.  The video starts you on the flat and takes you step by step on getting the dog to stop where you put the gates.  It allows flexibility for exactly where the dog stops and that might be hard for some folks who want all details given to them.  But I like that I can decide, based on what appears to be best for my dog,  where to put the gates to get the ""wait"".

It's explained well and is a simple idea that I will use for my next dog from the get-go.  I'm going to use some ideas for my current dog to repair our 2on/2off method, and may even end up retraining completely.  Glad I bought the DVD.",1297036800,,674,4.022556390977444
8097714,5,B000CCZWZO,"Great fun to watch Amanda with her dogs.  I learned a lot from it.  It is well-produced and very uplifting, not boring like some training videos.  I liked the different chapters, which made it easy to go back to review just the sections I wanted to review.  I'm looking forward to more videos by Amanda!",1135123200,2,303,4.454545454545454
