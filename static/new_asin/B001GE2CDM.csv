8305078,5,B001GE2CDM,"""Occurrence"" is an excellent example of 19th century realism in a 20th century format. It, surprisingly, captivated my high school literature class audience.  It is almost primitive in its presentation of the story. The director/editor stretch each scene to the attentional limits of the audience. The lack of extensive dialogue contributes nicely to the increasing tension of the story. The film is controlled, captivating, and completely worth the 28 minutes invested in viewing. Lastly, it succinctly and distinctly bears the earmarks of quality French film-making.",1418256000,,568,5.682352941176471

8305080,1,B001GE2CDM,"Rather than scratches and insect droppings, this one has random pixelations combined with muddy light and vague image resolution.  Probably the cue should have been the packaging is straight out of your street corner bootleg dealer.

If you've ever seen a reasonably good condition film copy, you know the defining visuals of his film are the crystal clear lighting contrasts in black and white.  The surrounding countryside and 'old home' scenes are set with early morning ground mists or the haze of memory while the events on the bridge and in the water are bright, clear, and immediate.

Here everything is dull, dark, and clouded.  Or, if you remember the timbre and enunciation of Captain's commands, so are the visuals.

After that, it is hard to believe this award winning, critically acclaimed film's best presentation is on YOUTUBE.  Somewhere ""out there"" is a DVD that comes up to the standard of a 16mm public library reel.

Just none of them appear to be on Amazon.",1318118400,10,978,4.884848484848485

AN OCCURENCE AT OWL CREEK BRIDGE is best-known of the latter. This French-made short film (28 mins.) of that tale was required viewing in high schools back in the 1960s.

The story opens with Confederate sympathizer Peyton Farquhar being executed by hanging from the titled river span. He's pushed, falls, the rope snaps and Peyton lands in the water, unharmed. He manages to free his hands, untie his bound feet and safely escape from a barrage of rifle fire.

For a day and night Farquhar flees through an endless forest in the general direction of home-- some 30 miles distant. All through this taxing journey he thinks about wife and kids. Peyton begins to imagine strange sights and noises, and is convinced that he dozes even while walking. After coming to full consciousness near his home, Farquhar runs (in stunning slow motion) with arms outstretched toward his wife. He suddenly feels a blinding pain in the back of his neck...

The literary device central to ""Owl Creek Bridge"" has been reused in many films.
