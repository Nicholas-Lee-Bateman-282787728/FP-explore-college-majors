7827413,4,6302540062,"This has got to be the most splendidly odd picture I've ever seen, and you know what? I love it!  It's filmed with such a cheap lense/ way, that it looks like it was made in the 70s or 80s. Not so. It was made in the 90s! The acting is bizarre, and the music sounds like it's been ripped from a bad horror movie. Nothing fits together.

The plot should be simple, but it's really difficult to grasp at times because, like many low budgets, the writer wanted to explore about a million themes, so there ISN'T a theme.  Jo and Agatha are a lesbian couple but it's not all fun and games.  The film starts off with Jo meeting up with a male friend and kissing him. Shortly after, Agatha discovers her diary, which outlines her conquests with every man she's been with (while cheesy horror music plays!). At the same time, Jo is making a movie about a queer/ trans (?) ftm in the 1800s, suspiciously, also a low budget movie.  And also, the two share a mutual friend who has many fake ailments-- he serves as the film's saving grace because he's pretty funny... Not really sure if he is supposed to BE funny.

What I love most about it is it's like the crew just called up all their lesbians friends to play any and every part. It seems wherever you look, there is a random butch woman! I love it a lot, it's funny.

There's also a great bit in which Jo does a dance wearing lingerie that resembles a pillow sham.

This is hokey, dated, and odd, but it means well! I'd suggest grabbing a copy and getting some friends together for a laugh. It's definitely a conversation piece.

However-- there are a few sex scenes that may seem graphic to some. So don't invite your conservative friends.",1213574400,8,1684,4.32063492063492
