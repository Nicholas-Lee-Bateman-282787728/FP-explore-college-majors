1039611,4,630547236X,"I thought the movie was good considering it was a made for tv movie, but when I read the actual account of what happened to George Stinney, I realized the movie didn't ""go there"" like it could have, and should have.  They should have shown how 14 year old George's family was run out of town, leaving this young boy all alone to face the naked hatred and racism of an entire town.  Instead they focused more on Louis Gossett Jr's character and his determination to find evidence that would posthumously exonerate his brother.  I realize the movie is based on George Stinney's execution with the names changed and some aspects fictionalized, but I still felt they did a disservice to the true life story by glossing over certain events.  Despite the short-comings, it was a good movie with great performances all around especially for the young man who played the central character.",1378944000,7,881,4.738562091503268

1039616,5,630547236X,"Louis Gossett, Jr. as always, great!  He champions Black America by making films that give insight into life, showing us what we should be.  Another such movie he made is ""In His Father's Shoes"".  But ""Carolina Skeletons"", based on a true story, is suspenseful and heartwrenching.  If you think you know who-dun-it, you're wrong!  Gotta see the end!  There are so many things in this world that have been and are so wrong but Louis shows us, through great acting and, I believe, personal integrity, that we are all called to do the right thing.",1321574400,2,544,4.673684210526316
1039617,2,630547236X,This movie disturbed me a bit. I knew what is was gonna be about but executing a little boy for two brutal murders that only a man could have pulled off just doesn't make any sense. Especially when the movie doesn't even show how they came to accuse the little boy. It's not worth buying.,1231804800,,288,4.254545454545455
1039618,5,630547236X,"Made for TV back in 1991, CAROLINA SKELETONS is based on the book by David Stout, and inspired by a true story.  Set in the 1960's South, the story focuses on the execution of a 14 year old African-American lad who supposedly brutally slaughtered two little girls.  Thirty years later, the boy's brother, now a colonel in the Green Berets, has come home to visit his dying mother who asks him to find out who really killed the girls.  While the movie has its share of cliches and stereotypes, it nonetheless has some powerful and tragic scenes.  The execution of the little boy in itself is terrifying, but even more so is the sheriff's insistence that his own son (a closet friend of the condemned) witness the execution is ghastly.  Lou Gossett Jr. brings a stoic strength in his role as the Green Beret, whose search for the truth uncovers those Carolina Skeletons.  Bruce Dern is very good as the sheriff, who is the little boy forced to witness the execution; he too wants to find out from his now institutionalized father, what really transpired.  Melissa Leo gives an effective performance as Dern's daughter who aids Gossett in his quest for the truth, and Richard Jenkins is vile as a good old boy out to stop Gossett from finding the truth.  No special effects, no intense action sequences, CAROLINA SKELETONS brings home the sad truth of a country riddled with hate, and is tragic in its exposition of such truth.",1116892800,16,1424,4.668
1039619,3,630547236X,"Louis Gossett, Jr. is the star of Carolina Skeletons and gives his usual excellent performance as a man returning to his small South Carolina town in 1964 who is asked by his dying mother to prove that his older brother  executed thirty years previous was wrongly accused. Carolina Skeletons is a  made-for-television movie that is somewhat lacking in some of the  production values of more expensively produced films. It has several scenes  that come to a dramatic climax and then fade to black. I found myself  expecting commercials. The movie is worthy of attention because it reminds  us of the unjust treatment of African Americans in our country - especially  in the South. As citizens, we must always be aware of injustice in order  that it be identified and vanquished.",949104000,15,777,4.923076923076923

The only reason I gave it 4 stars, is I feel that it left out a lot of the actual facts about the history. In other words, it was more for entertainment than for anything educational. Great movie, Just be sure to read the book as well. (If you are interested in the actual Story of the 14 yr. old boy who was executed.",1379376000,5,453,3.989010989010989

7890613,4,630547236X,"In June, 1944, George Stinney, a 14-year-old black South Carolina boy, became the youngest child legally executed in the United States, when he was electrocuted after being convicted of the murder of two white girls less than three months earlier. The case is widely considered one of the greatest miscarriages of justice in this country, and Stinney was eventually exonerated in 2014. Before that, however, the case, and the question of who actually killed those two girls, became the basis for a solid 1991 TV-movie, Carolina Skeletons, based on a novel by David Stout.

The majority of Carolina Skeletons takes place in the early 1970s in rural South Carolina where the murders occurred (in the movie, they take place in 1934). Louis Gossett, Jr., stars as James Bragg, the younger brother of the executed boy (called Linus Bragg in the film). Bragg, a Green Berets colonel, returns to the town he left years earlier to tend to his dying mother, and, at her request, he starts investigating the case all over again. The current sheriff, Junior Stoker (Bruce Dern), is the son of the sheriff (G.D. Spradlin) at the time the murders occurred, and a number of others who were involved in the investigation are still alive and not too keen on Bragg poking around. When a couple of the witnesses turn up dead under mysterious circumstances, Sheriff Stoker gets involved as well.

On one level, Carolina Skeletons works fairly well as a mystery. Its clear from the opening flashbacks that detail the murders that Linus didn't do it, but finding the actual killer requires some good detective work by both Bragg and Stoker. The teleplay was written by veteran screenwriter Tracy Keenan Wynn, who does a good job of building suspense and disguising his clues. Whodunit fans will enjoy this movie simply for those reasons.

However, Carolina Skeletons is even more effective as a commentary on racial relations in the South. There are only a couple of scenes set in 1934, but they are among the most chilling and memorable in the film. In one, the older Sheriff Stoker is able to coax Linus into signing the confession the sheriff prepared (and which was practically the only evidence of the boys guilt), not through threats but by adopting a gentle, fatherly tone with the frightened child. Later, the movie depicts Linus execution in horrifying detail. Nothing graphic is shown, but the underlying horror of the situation is powerful, both for the condemned Linus and for Junior, who was brought by his father to see the execution.

The more recent scenes provide fascinating details about the changing nature of racial relations in the early 1970s, only a few years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act. Some of the scenes in the movie are fairly predictable, like a late-night Klan appearance at the house where Bragg is staying and white characters frequent use of the N-word. But the most effective moments are quieter, like the sight of the now-barred Colored entrance to the courthouse that Bragg first tries to use before being told by a deputy he can go in the front door. Later, when he visits the town librarian (Melissa Leo) at a luncheonette, the chill in the restaurant is palpable when he enters and talks to her.

Carolina Skeletons only falters when it tries too hard to be an action film. Gossett is quite convincing when he mixes it up with a couple of local rednecks, but the fight scenes and scattered gunplay seem a bit out of place. In addition, from a technical standpoint, the Amazon Prime video that I saw wasn't the worlds highest quality, no doubt because of the films origins as a TV-movie and the lack of high quality master materials. However, for the most part, the movie itself is high quality, with a number of very good character actors in supporting roles, including prototypical redneck Clifton James, Bill Cobbs, and a very young Richard Jenkins. As I write this review, we are 80 years removed from the murders as portrayed in the movie, 70 years from the actual killings in the Stinney case, and nearly 50 years from the events shown in the rest of the film. Carolina Skeletons serves as a valuable, and well-made, reminder of the actual skeletons in the not-too-distant past in the South.",1501200000,,4229,4.827586206896552
