4855251,5,B005OZ4GJW,"Wow...40 years ago DP unleashed Fireball upon the masses and in the next coming months they would release their masterpiece Machine Head.  Can't believe it's been 40 years on, and the lads are still going strong. Beautiful picture quality, superb sound quality, masterfully edited, us old timers can't keep up with the fast editting like some of these other concert releases (like the newest Halford live in Japan). The boys are still at the top of their game, especially Gillan, still sounds good, Paice never hits a wrong note, Glover spot on, and Airey was born for the gig.  Steve Morse still shreds away, and as far as looks go, he looks like the oldest of the bunch now, but is easily 10 years younger than the rest of the fellas.  The orchestra sounds fresh, and doesn't overpower the band or the music.  Really a nice compliment. A natural setting. Pick this up on blu ray if you can, and enjoy the show.",1321315200,18,912,4.576687116564417
4855252,5,B005OZ4GJW,"This is an excellent concert! The song selection is really good and the audio quality is strong and clear. The video quality is very crisp and clear, A great Blu-Ray disc.. I have purchased many Deep Purple video's and this is one of their better concerts. The band look like they are having a good time and playing greatly together, the orchestra seems to enjoy what they are doing also. The interview segments are a nice addition to the concert. Highly recommended to fans of Deep Purple.",1321142400,8,490,4.64367816091954

4855254,3,B005OZ4GJW,"Deep Purple has one of the finest catalogs in rock history, with a string of landmark albums stretching back to 1968. Their video history is a little dodgy in comparison. Since 1996 and the entrance of guitar whiz Steve Morse, the band have released numerous concert videos. Usually well shot and well recorded, the videos regularly fall flat on two fronts. First off, despite the string of albums mentioned earlier, the concert videos ALWAYS feature the same core set of songs and rarely spotlight newer material. Look at their DVD's for sale here on Amazon and check out the setlist of each. You'll find they're essentially the same setlist, with maybe three or four different songs added to this DVD or that other one. DP have released four albums (to date) with Steve Morse, yet they all get overlooked so they can regurgitate the same old MkII canon. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE this band. I just get tired of that same old setlist. Secondly is vocalist Ian Gillan. Once one of the greatest voices in rock, but in his late 60's a pale shadow of former glories. Hey, we all get old and there's absolutely no shame in that. What I don't like is his repeated attempts to sing like he did at 20. Why is he still singing songs off of In Rock? Those notes are beyond his abilities these days, so why even try? It's difficult to watch and even painful at times. As far as this DVD goes, great video, great audio and nice camera work. After that, it's a roller coaster ride...",1360972800,4,1472,4.496268656716418
4855255,5,B005OZ4GJW,"they DVD came as described, if you like old time rock it's worth watching, the guys are getting old though",1359331200,,106,4.35
4855256,5,B005OZ4GJW,"How can anyone not like Deep Purple. It was always great to listen to them on Vinyl and CD's.
With the BluRay Disc it is the best of both worlds. It is great sound with visual.
It rocks.",1356393600,,186,3.9210526315789473
4855257,5,B005OZ4GJW,"As a longtime Deep Purple fan, I was wondering what the current lineup would be like with an orchestra when I went to see them during this 2011 tour: I was fortunate enough to have front row seats between Ian and Steve in Minneapolis, and the set list was essentially identical to this DVD. The list of drawbacks here is brief: Ian Gillan's vocal range is definitely more limited than it was 40 years ago, but he still does a great job and can hit nearly all the notes except the highest of the highs; his performance is certainly spirited and I think he's better on the 2011 Montreux show DVD than on the recording from the 2006 show. Having said that, there's no other vocalist that would make this material sound better, and I am thrilled he and the band are still recording and touring.

It turns out that I adore the band with the orchestra, and think that it adds amazingly to the depth of the performance. The arrangements were very smart with conductor Stephen Bentley-Klein providing perfect accents and accompaniment to these rock standards. Musicianship is first rate, with Don Airey doing well living in Lord's shadow, Ian Paice never missing a beat, Roger Glover being the consummate bassist, and Steve Morse providing his unique takes on the material and smoking through the set (I particularly loved the Billy Gibbons-inspired solo on ""Black Night,"" though I think ""Hush was better when I saw them in Minneapolis.) It's a given that the music is great (a particular highlight is ""No One Came"") but the DVD also has quite extended interviews that add considerable value for true fans. I was particularly intrigued by Paice's interview, especially his comments on ""No One Came"" (and his amusing comments about why he dislikes Facebook.)

While some people harp on Gillan's diminished vocal abilities, I prefer to think of it from a ""glass half full"" perspective: he may not be able to do what he did on ""Machine Head,"" but most vocalists would still be envious of his considerable talents. As for the rest of the band, they have never sounded better. This is a great show, and the orchestra takes it to another level entirely. I recommend this DVD without reservation.",1345334400,3,2181,4.75197889182058
4855258,4,B005OZ4GJW,"I am a long-time Deep Purple fan. I saw them in the Astrodome in Houston in 1974. When I heard what Ian Gillan sounded like on the first song (Highway Star) on this disk, I almost got up and took the disk out, never to be played again. Fortunately, I continued watching, and it got much better. Yes, Gillan's voice is gone, but most of the time it does not negatively affect the overall sound. Steve Morse sounds great on these songs, and there are a lot of excellent jams throughout. The integration of the orchestra with the band is very well done. If you are a Deep Purple fan, you will enjoy this (just skip over the first song.)",1344643200,4,633,4.283333333333333
4855259,5,B005OZ4GJW,"I saw Deep Purple in concert in Victoria, B.C. during their 2012 Canadian tour. It was a great show. Ian Gillan, Roger Glover and Ian Paice are well into their 60s but they can still put a high energy performance. Steve Morse and Don Airey are fine replacements for Ritchie Blackmore and Jon Lord.

After seeing Deep Purple's cuurent live act, I bought the Montreaux 2006 DVD, which is excellent. I wasn't sure about this one; I hesitated on buying this because I thought the orchestra might not be compatible with Deep Purple's music.

I took a chance on this one anyway and I'm glad I did. It's an excellent performance. The orchestra brings a very real energy to the music. The sound is good and, for the most part, the camera work and editing are well done.

I started listening to Deep Purple about 1971-72. At that time Deep Purple had already done one album with an orchestra - Jon Lord's Concerto for Group and Orchestra. That was more of a concept album; I never thought they'd do another one. If someone back then had predicted that in forty years Deep Purple would be performing classic tracks like Space Trucking, Lazy and Smoke On The Water with an orchestra backing them, I would have thought that person was insane.

If you're hesitating about buying this because you not sure about Deep Purple playing with an orchestra backing them, stop hesitating and buy it. If you're a Deep Purple fan, you'll like this one. Highly recommended.",1339459200,2,1448,4.64453125
4855260,2,B005OZ4GJW,"Very disappointed with the sound. Eagle vision usually has very good recording quality. This sounded like there was one mike in a tin can at the back of the theater.  Worst blue ray that I have ever heard. Will be putting up for sale,burning it, the apple iTunes version of machine head album sounds way better than this. Do not wate your $$$$.",1333670400,,344,4.4603174603174605
4855261,5,B005OZ4GJW,"I've been a Deep Purple fan since before Gillan and Glover, way back when Jon Lord was writing songs, like ""April"". This is a band that has always evolved, always moved with the times and somehow, through countless personnel changes, has always come with with great material to entertain and delight. This dvd is a real treasure. I loved Deep Purple IN ROCK, and this performance goes back to those songs, along with FIREBALL. Songs that I grew up with, playing the LPs over and over again. Making my friends listen, because they had very little airplay in America. This is before ""SMOKE ON THE WATER"" became a monster hit. The Orchestra is there to enhance the songs, but not to play any classical piece, which makes this a symphonic masterpiece. Just wait till you listen to HIGHWAY STAR with the orchestra! WOW!! This is a labor of love. All parties involved are really committed to bringing out the best of each song, for our enjoyment. Wish I'd been there!! If you're a fan you'll not be disappointed. If you're not a fan, you will become one once you give this great concert a try. As a fan who owns almost every dvd the've ever put out, I rate this one among their best. A real treat. Specially if you're familiar with the songs. The interviews with each band member are worth the price of the dvd alone, just the gillan one was fantastic. So, yeah, get while you can. I highly recommend it.",1332201600,2,1398,4.5078740157480315
4855262,5,B005OZ4GJW,"Do we need another review of this? What the heck, here is my 2 cents worth. Of all the Montreux shows this is my favorite. Granted (here comes a disclaimer) Ian Gillian passes up on some of those impossibly high screams he used to do. (After all, he has been doing this for over 40 years. Get over it.) But he still does a good job and the band is absolutely smoking. And it's amazing how well the orchestra integrates with the band by adding a whole new dimension of depth, complexity, power and freshness to these songs. And where else could you hear a call and response duel between Steve Morse on guitar and the conductor on violin (Lazy). I don't know how they are going to top this one. For my money this is the best Deep Purple concert ever.",1331337600,,748,4.274647887323944
4855263,5,B005OZ4GJW,Deep purple with Orchestra live at Montreux was very well done the bandmembers were very professional very experienced and delivered a very powerful performance deep purple performed classic deep purple hits plus new material from deep purple I would highly recommend this Blu-ray disc for any deep purple fans a well-done to deep purple and their entire crew amazon.com delivered this Blu-ray disc to me on time,1328400000,,412,5.164179104477612
4855264,5,B005OZ4GJW,"I was at the gig at Place Des Arts theatre,Montreal in June 2011.  The set list above is what we had as well.  The Montreal crowd was well behind Purple from the get go and the band fed off the enthusiasm and joy from the crowd.  The sold out show (3500) was a hi-light for the band on this tour as well.  This video comes highly recommended........see Purple with an orchestra !",1327363200,,379,4.222222222222222

The orchestra adds a huge impact on those finest pieces of classic rock. Buy with your eyes closed. It`s a must have to every Deep Purple fan. More: to everyone who likes rock in its essence. The quality of image and sound is amazing. One of my best blurays ever!",1326672000,,410,4.407894736842105
4855266,5,B005OZ4GJW,"Acho que tem muitos vdeos do Deep Purple na praa e apesar de f da banda desde os anos 70's, tinha prometido a mim mesmo no comprar mais vdeos desse grupo. No resisti e comprei o Blu-ray pela Amazon, para minha surpresa achei fantstico: o vdeo (HD) em alta definio est limpo e ntido. O udio em DTS-HD est sublime, os instrumentos esto bem distribuidos e mixados adequadamente. Tcnicamente perfeito!
Falando da banda: a competncia instrumental est acima de qualquer grupo e sincronismo entre eles  incomparvel. Don est para Lord, assim como Morse est para Blackmore, os dois encorporaram com muita competncia. Paice e Glover, dispensam comentrios. J Gilan, consegue fazer o mnimo necessrio com muito esforo,  uma pena mas sua voz est acabando e o folego tambm, essa deficincia  coberta nitidamente pelo instrumental do grupo e pelo timo trabalho da Orquestra, aqui o projeto sinfonico funcionou muito bem.
Concluso: para os fs, sempre vale a pena ver Deep Purple! Para quem gosta de um bom espetculo, tambm!",1326153600,,1005,4.970238095238095
4855267,5,B005OZ4GJW,Great to see the band with an orchestra. I saw them live with the orchestra and this is just a perfect DVD to keep those momories from the concet.

Playing with an orchestra, just doesn't get any better than this. To me, the audio and video is great. The songs bring back fond memories! This is one DVD that I will wear out, and is a must get for us Deep Purple fans! Rock On my friends!",1323388800,2,358,3.9178082191780823
4855269,3,B005OZ4GJW,"I bought the concert dvd despite criticism of Gillan's voice.  When you play the opening tune, however, you'll understand that the criticism is warranted - unfortunately.  I respect Gillan and all those his age that still love to perform and want to soldier on - especially considering Deep Purple remains a popular touring band.  But the man is 66 years old.  I didn't buy this expecting a knock out vocal performance but I naively thought the critics are too tough and expect to much.  Well, maybe they still are but the vocals were even weaker than I expected.  Very thin but clearly he's trying.  The band is obviously great but its going to be hard to play this repeatedly when the vocals borderline on bothersome.  If you want a satisfying Gillian performance, where everyone is firing on all cylinders, check out DP's 1996 Montreux dvd instead.",1323388800,11,851,4.780821917808219
4855270,3,B005OZ4GJW,"The latest incarnation of Deep Purple is going the route of many ""classic"" rock and/or metal bands, and are putting being accompanied by a symphony for a special release. This particular concert closed out the 2011 Montreux Jazz Festival.
Many do not realize just how powerful a symphony sound can be without ever hearing one live. For this concert film, it helps when a heavy metal band is present to be matched and/or enhanced by the sheer boom that is power of a symphonic sound to help make for a nice example. The frequently bluesy riffs of Deep Purple, coming from songs both new and old, are complimented well by a large assembly of strings and horns. It should be noted that this is not a full symphony, but something similar to the size of a Count Basie orchestra setup. In fact, there are some songs where the symphony do not play at all, such a ""Space Truckin'' whose chunky riffs might be best left alone.
Deep Purple are heralded as pioneers of the heavy metal sound. Ian Gillen may not have the same rock n roll shriek in his voice that he used to but he is no slouch after being in the biz for over 40 years. The rest of the band are in very fine form at this performance, with some bonus points going to the particularly smooth playing of guitarist Steve Morse.
The set list, being 18 tracks long, offers up staples like ""Smoke on the Water"" and ""Highway Star"" along with samples from their entire back catalog. The lengthy set list emphasizes how much this is more fan service than something a new comer should encounter.

4855271,5,B005OZ4GJW,"After not seeing the band when they missed Colorado, I was very happy to get this. Knowing that Jon Lord advised Don on how to play Hard Loving Man, it was even better than I thought. It was good to see how songs like Woman From Tokyo and Knocking At Your Back Door were slowed down just enough to make them work better. Everyone does a great job. As for Ian's voice, the high notes are about gone, but there's still power and quality to the rest of it. Among other reasons, he had to teach himself to sing Child In Time way back when, so I think we should respect the man.",1323043200,2,573,4.079646017699115

Being a Blackhawks fan I must mention Perfect Strangers and Black Night were great too!  I really enjoyed the Orchestra's ""just right"" touch for this Band.  The addition of the Orchestra didn't overshadow the band and didn't change the appreciation of any of the songs. Instead, the Orchestra was background accompaniment such as you would hear on a Studio song with orchestra added except for the Best rendition of Perfect Strangers I ever heard.

Yea there up there in age but they knock it out perfectly. He loves it so i'm satisfied. I recommend it to fans of the band or new people who want to get into them live. The guitars are on point and the bass is audible and thick(just the way i like it) but the vocals seem a bit strained. But hey if you want their best get Live in Montreaux 2006 that is the one i was looking for. It is the better of the 2 vocal and total pwrformance wise. Still good but the dude downstairs is like 60 and all he does is listen to DP & Blackmoor Night it has ruined the band DP for me. But i got it for my dad.
