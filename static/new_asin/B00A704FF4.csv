5391376,3,B00A704FF4,"I purchased this film based on a friends recommendation who said it moved him to tears, something he almost never did in a movie
before, and since I am a mushy sucker for sentimental films, I bought it sight unseen.  I admit I did shed a tear or two at the
surprise element at the end which I won't spoil here, and the film seemed to me a bit too long.  But the real problem was that the bonding
between the dad and little girl was mostly one-sided, with very little change in Dad.  He remained a man-child through most of
the film and was rather cruel to her.  Also the film didn't sustain scenes and subjects long enough to get the viewer deeply
involved.  I don't know if this was typical of Korean culture among unattached males in their twenties, since this film was
not an Americanized movie.  Despite these issues, I have to come down on the like side of ""like-don't like"", so a 3 for me.",1369008000,,895,4.266272189349112
5391377,5,B00A704FF4,"Meet Mr. Daddy follows Jong Dae, a small-time criminal, as he takes in his orphaned daughter, Joon, in exchange for his freedom and cash. Although Jong Dae had no knowledge of his daughter, he agrees to take care of her before her official adoption and we witness the ups and downs of their newly forming relationship. Meet Mr. Daddy is a beautiful and powerful film.

Meet Mr. Daddy has a touching storyline that gets deeper and deeper as it progresses; events will make you smile and laugh, and events that will make you cry in sadness, are shown throughout the film. It even manages to pack a heavy twist, or two, that is sure to garner some tears. The ending is particularly thought-provoking for several reason; I won't spoil it.  The relationship the two leads develop feels authentic, partly due to the amazing performances and moving scenes. The film also has great music.

Overall, I really enjoyed Meet Mr. Daddy from beginning to end- all of the happiness and sadness I experienced. South Korean cinema continues to impress! If you're interested in other South Korean films, check my Amazon account for other recommendations. As of 1/21/13, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, although a purchase is highly recommended.

Meet Mr. Daddy has some strong violence and blood (including a brief dog fight), and some brief nudity.",1358899200,7,1344,4.907488986784141

Great storytelling, beautiful, tough to watch at times, The little girl broke our hearts. We are enjoying most of the South Korean films streaming on Amazon Prime and have found that South Korean films far outshine American films of the last two decades.",1464393600,,345,4.75

8547487,2,B00A704FF4,"I was looking for a family movie.  This was not one.  There was too much vulgarity, nudity and violence for it to be a family film.  The cover gives you a nice family feel , don't be fooled. I'm glad I decided to preview it.",1412121600,,224,3.933333333333333
