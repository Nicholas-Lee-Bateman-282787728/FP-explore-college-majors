625772,5,6303298141,"Too much boring serial killer material out there, trust me, i studied it for over half of my life time....
This is epic, i got it 2 months ago, Seen episodes on it atleast some of them 20 times over and over again, those episodes with direct serial killer interviews, oppossed to story telling episodes mostly, the prior, close profiling, tend to be the most psychological serial killer kick profiles you find out there!
If your study is mankind and its obscurity devised within the blood of man, you will never get enough of this DVD SET...

Some of the best you can find on Amazon.

625773,4,6303298141,"that is the comentary intro is the same for every episode, which are maybe 4 per DVD, and it is an intro lasting several mintues, ie. Caince killed Able, Chronus sleuth, blah blah blah.",1252108800,,185,4.470588235294118
625774,3,6303298141,"Have to agree with other reviewers that the music chosen for this documentary is downright ugly. It includes seemingly random horn blasts, piano that doesn't quite make it into the category of ""eerie"" or ""sinister-sounding"" (more like awkward and just plain weird, as though a cat were walking across the keyboard), and other ill-placed percussion sounds that really detract from the whole thing. It occasionally even sounds like the theme from Seinfeld!  Just really not cool for a show of this nature and it's unfortunate that the music creeps in so often.  If you can get beyond the music, the content is interesting enough.  Lots of interviews with people involved in various serial killer investigations dating back to the 1940s.

However, if you were to ask me to recommend a good show on serial killers, this wouldn't be it.  I can say that it complements a collection of serial killer programs well, if you're interested enough in the field to actually have a collection, but I wouldn't consider this one informative enough to be your only show.  Not sure if that makes any sense.",1232582400,,1088,4.885869565217392
625775,1,6303298141,The narration in this pack is the worst I have EVER heard.. Its so bland and boring its so hard to get into and pay any attention to.. I was most certainly disapointed with this purchase and wouldnt reccomend it to anyone.,1232409600,3,222,4.309523809523809
625776,5,6303298141,"Obviously structured to be a television series, this is a series of twelve interviews with notorious serial killers.

This is not a slick, glamorized series. This would not be of interest for someone who wants graphic pictures of victims, or slow-motion details about the killings, the cases or a ""how to."" More than enough of this information comes out, but it is often relayed in a very matter-of-fact blas tone of the killer himself - recounting it as if it were a trip to the corner store. In some respects this series does start out almost boring... but this is obviously orchestrated, to tailor it's own audience to the text, to eliminate the thrill seekers.

What this series is: a thoughtful series of interviews with the serial killers. The focus here is not on the gruesome, but on the minds of these (mostly) men, and how their minds work - or don't as the case may be. The cumulative effect is slow and powerful. The series as a whole becomes possibly the strongest intelligent argument for the death penalty that has even been created.

Others have noted that the music is odd, but again, by the end, the irregular rhythms and random notes echo the distorted viewpoint of the thought process of these people. Exceptionally well done - for someone seeking an in depth look at the psychology of these killers. It leave us seeing some deep similar facets: their inability to say ""I killed""... but instead saying, ""she got herself killed,"" how each of them who is able to be somewhat introspective flatly states that there is no solution for them but to be put to death, how pornography and popular culture tool sexual fantasies in this direction, and how everyday people around them were often complicit in really sickening ways.

The series is intentionally structured to become more psychologically complex toward the end, which makes it get more interesting as it progresses.  (That does not lend itself to film-making, but more to a learning/clinical process, which again, seems to be the intent, and the accomplishment here.)

Deeply thought provoking.",1171497600,19,2067,4.8746438746438745
625777,3,6303298141,"This DVD contains approximately 6.5 hours of interviews with various serial killers and one mass murderer (Ronald DeFeo Jr, who one night shot his entire family while they slept, ""inspiring"" the movie ""The Amityville Horror""), and various law enforcement officers, lawyers, psychiatrists, etc who were involved in the cases.

Some of the serial killers are very well-known, such as Ted Bundy, Kenneth Bianchi (""The Hillside Strangler"") and Henry Lee Lucas (""The Confession Killer""), whilst others are not so well-known. The segments I personally found most interesting were those on Ronald DeFeo Jr, Ted Bundy and Kenneth Bianchi. I had previously know little about Kenneth Bianchi, and I found the descriptions of some of his murders particularly disturbing, especially those relating to the two young girls he murdered.

As someone who has thought of myself as having good intuition in relation to people's characters, the aspect of this movie and others like it that I find most unnerving is that the majority of the killers interviewed appear quite ""normal"" and articulate, even gentle or docile in some cases (e.g. Arthur Shawcross, ""The Monster of the Rivers""). Though admittedly, there are a few you would definitely not want to take home to meet your mother (e.g. Douglas Clark, ""The Sunset Slayer"")!

Unfortunately, there is one aspect of this DVD which lets it down considerably, and that is the music. It really is just not scary, is irritating and does not suit the subject (especially that funky slap bass sound)! Furthermore, it is repeated at the beginning and end of each segment. If the DVD could somehow be reproduced with different, more appropriate music (and not repeated at the beginning and end of each segment), it would be greatly improved. Watching this DVD reinforced to me how important the soundtrack is in the overall quality of a movie or documentary.

If you want to purchase a really good DVD about serial killers and psychopaths, I would strongly recommend ""Serial Killers - Profiling the Criminal Mind"" (also listed as ""Serial Killers 2-Pack"") which includes stories on John Wayne Gacy, Jeffrey Dahmer and Charles Manson, and includes interviews with Manson, Patricia Krenwinkle and Leslie Van Houten.",1158278400,22,2236,5.185595567867036
625778,5,6303298141,"This 3 DVD set is nicely put together. 6.5 hours of hard-hitting, brutal info into the how & why, etc.

It wouldn't be a bad idea if a few more horror writers and/or serial killer flick makers would get this DVD for the info alone, and maybe their films wouldn't suck so bad.

Am not pushing gore here, because gore and buckets of blood (alone) do not make for a great scare flick at all, but am talking about looking into these minds here, taking the time to see what serial killers are actually about, why they do the horrifying things that they do, etc.

The only negative  is the irritating music that they keep repeating over and over and over and over... It's done after each segment. Oh man, what agony. Had to keep my finger on the volume button throughout basically. They could have also gone into each childhood a bit more (because, as you know, this is where it started, where the problem began; yes, you have the RARE bad seed now and then, but usually, very often, the serial killer's mother was a prostitute, or else there was abuse, all sorts of abuse--sometimes both).

 Other than that, this package is definitely worth getting. I don't regret paying what I paid for it.",1149379200,14,1187,4.472222222222222
625779,2,6303298141,I have watched and read my share of serial killer artical/movies...ect. This is so general with alot of jumping around from story to story. Do yourself a favor and save your money. The great thing is that I only paid two dollars for this on ebay. But again I would have prefered to have my two bucks back.,1138320000,,305,4.275862068965517
7843662,2,6303298141,Disappointing serial killer documentary.  The whole documentary focuses mostly on interviews with 3rd party interviewees; no TV news clips or headlines to speak of.  I am very interested in the psyche and methodology of American serial killers.  This documentary was boring and I did not learn a thing that I didn't already know about any of them.  Don't waste your money.,1483660800,,372,5.049180327868853
7843663,4,6303298141,This is a great documentary. Would've given 5 stars if not for awful background music. Whoever put this in should be shot in the pocket book as one of the serial killers says.,1472860800,,175,4.333333333333333

7843665,3,6303298141,"This documentary was clearly put together with a very low budget, but does contain some good information. I learned of killers I had never even heard of before, and got to see some rare interviews with others I did know of. There is something very interesting about seeing/hearing an interview with the actual killers.

Personally, I found disc 3 to be the least interesting.

Part of me wondered if this documentary wasn't made as some sort of tool/support in the debate on capital punishment. Many segments ended with one authority or another stating that they supported the death penalty and that the killer should be condemned to die. Also, it seemed this documentary included many (but not all) killers that had been imprisoned at one point for their violent crime(s), and then released back into society where they then went on to commit more killings.

Now for the music....

I had read other reviews that mentioned the bad music and I thought to myself, ""How bad could it really be?""

I couldn't help but laugh when I finally heard it.
It was worse than anything I could have imagined. And it used all throughout, which is unfortunate.

Good info, but keep the remote handy to skip through the music when you can (primarily during the opening and closing of each segment).",1403481600,,1280,4.769230769230769
7843666,5,6303298141,"I paid a little more for this than I wanted to, but I read some of the reviews and decided to go ahead. I was pleased. It is very informative and the interviews were very interesting. Rarely in true crime shows, you see interviews with a serial killer.",1397347200,,252,4.270833333333333
7843667,5,6303298141,"I already have this vhs but would like to purchase another (to see if it is in better condition).  I really have been searching for months to see if they would transfer it to DVD but they haven't.  Maybe they'll read this and think about it...(keep dreaming, right?)

It is true, it is not all informative, but it is interesting enough to watch -- the way it is documented is almost like being in a psychology class.",1351296000,,416,4.376623376623376

7843669,4,6303298141,"The Serial Killers is an interesting program. Its mostly accurate for a low budget documentery... The downside though is the God-Aweful music played in the backround for nearly the entire show, and of course the intro credits are equally offensive to the ears... My suggestion, put it on mute with the subtitles on and put on your own damn music. Thats right, youll have to read.",1330992000,,379,4.757575757575758
7843670,5,6303298141,"I bought this DVD set after seeing an episode of it on my copy of the movie, ""Henry:  Portrait of a Serial Killer"".  Now that I've seen all the episodes, I was just amazed at how educational and interesting this series is.  It's one of the best series that I've ever seen about real-life serial killers.  The episodes are not necessarily pleasant, but at the same time not exploitative.  The filmakers here are not trying to hype the 'serial killer' subject up or anything like that, nor does this series makes you feel sentimental towards these people who perform their ghastly deeds of taking other peoples' lives in whatever method that pleases them.

My personal favorite episode is the one about Ronald Defeo Jr., ""The Amityville Horror"".  This is because I have seen some of ""The Amityville Horror"" movies and wanted to learn more about the true stories that inspired them.  Other recommendations are ""Amityville-The Haunting"" and ""Amityville-Horror or Hoax"".

Two other ones in particular that I admired are the one showing Henry Lee Lucas, ""The Confession Killer"",(which is the story that inspired the movie stated at the beginning,) and Theodore Robert Bundy, ""The Lady Killer"", a misogynistic murderer who has become extremely notorious long after his execution in early 1989.

I've read some reviews about the music in this series, and I can understand that they don't enjoy the repetition and abstractness of it.  But I personally had no problem with it.  It does set the proper mood of the world of serial killers.

The interviews are well done too.  All the people being interviewed give plenty of details about how these killers operate and we even get to hear the killers speak for themselves in the interviews.  It doesn't mean that you have to take their sides, but it allows them to speak their minds and therefore, gives the viewer to draw their own conclusions about these criminals.

I think that this is a great series for people who wish to pursue a career in law enforcement, criminal psychology, or law.  However, this is not for people who just want to have thrills.  They are better off watching something like one of the ""Scream"", ""Friday the 13th"", or ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" films.",1265155200,2,2216,4.848404255319149
7843671,3,6303298141,I enjoyed this set. It had good information but the music drives me crazy. The background music is like nothing you've ever heard. its pretty laughable. I was able to look past it to the information but if you think annoying background music will distract you then this set is not for you,1259452800,,288,4.452830188679245
