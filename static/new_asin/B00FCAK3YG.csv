5975238,3,B00FCAK3YG,"This DVD is not a documentary or perspective on Miley's career.  Very little concert footage.  It is Miley being interviewed by different people.  Only one interviewer was able to connect with her and he was quite funny.  However, I was hoping for more.  I thought I would get a perspective on Miley's life.  Would I order it again knowing what I know now?  I don't think so.  However, having bought it, I found the DVD mildly entertaining.  I was impressed that Miley consistently turned down alcoholic drinks that were offered to her.  I thought there is surely more to her than meets the eye.  And that's a good thing. She has a lot to offer the world.

Totally unrelated I think Miley has a great opportunity waiting for her if she ever decided to record a great cover song.  The Beatles did it many times in the beginning of their careers, the Rolling Stones, Springsteen, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, nearly all the Motown artists, and on and on.  If she can hit a song out the park, she'll have another great song under her belt for which she will be remembered.  Whitney Houston made the covers she  recorded her own.  I Will Always Love You was a Dolly Parton song but how many people remember that?  The world knows it as Whitney's song.  Enough said.  If any of you know Miley, about a 1 in 20,000,000 chance, share the idea with her.  There is a song out there just waiting for Miley to take it to the top of the charts.",1388966400,5,1431,4.406130268199234
5975239,1,B00FCAK3YG,"There are no music videos on this DVD - it's a documentary of ""how Miley transitioned from a child star to a tabloid favorite"". If you think you'd be getting any music or concert video - forget it. Total waste of money",1386979200,9,218,4.214285714285714

8614353,3,B00FCAK3YG,A little would have gone a long way. This DVD is a Documentary- Interview of sorts and is quite lengthly. It is not a concert nor a video. For that reason I was disappointed.  I look forward to Miley's Concert DVD. It will rock and give her peirs a real run. Her latest music is smokin!  Watch out Gaga make some room:),1389571200,3,319,4.129032258064516
