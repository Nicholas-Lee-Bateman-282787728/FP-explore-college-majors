8446968,5,B004XIV86K,I really enjoyed this. It was a lot of fun to see the old footage from the 70s of conventions back in the day.,1513728000,,110,3.625
8446969,4,B004XIV86K,"I feel I should give this DVD five stars, and I'll explain why I haven't later on.

But wow, those heady days of when Star Trek and Star Wars were the top dogs in scifi media, and computers were things that only big companies or universities had, or you were a genius hobbyist if you had one.  It was a day and age when only missile silos had email, when there was no AT&T only Ma Bell who ruled over all phone lines across the nation and much of the world.

Star Trek kind of falls into that category in that nobody else wanted to create a serious scifi drama, or rather invest the effort it took to make a serious scifi drama come to life.  Star Trek, as per some of my previous reviews, is a kind of police show that looks at issues in society through the vehicle of a good story.  It showed how with science and technology and good old fashioned Yankee skepticism (yes, I do mean American skepticism) threats, dilemmas, wrongful situations, and threats of all sorts, can be over come.

The problem is that Star Trek was one of a kind, as this documentary shows.  There are various reasons for that which are beyond the scope of the documentary, but it does manage to show some of the theories that some of the fans and people involved in the production had regarding its popularity and success.

We see either a Ford or Dodge van painted to look like the Enterprise's Galileo shuttlecraft (I think I actually saw that thing once or twice around town--San Francisco), we see people dressing up in costumes before ""cosplay"" became the phenomenon that it is today, and of course Bill Shatner, Leonard Nimoy and others of the cast as they address fans and interviewers.

And speaking of interviewers, the late great Bob Wilkins his shown here in all his 16 millimeter glory putting the microphone to various faces and asking questions with his very patented understated tone.  Including footage of perhaps the final years of his life down at the Santa Cruz store when Alzheimer's had become a factor in his health (curse Alzheimer's and cancer both).

The interview subjects correctly recall the early days of fandom when things were more in earnest.  When the scifi genre hadn't become the huge commercial machine that it is now.  When, as the documentary states, a fan wanted an autograph he was a genuine fan and wanted an actual autograph, and wasn't so mercenary as to put the signature up on the net for auction.

I won't say it was a more innocent time as Star Trek had sex as a theme in a lot of its stories, but the idea that mankind would reach for the stars, and that we, as a species, would be able to overcome present threats to society and tackle the same thing in the future with high tech and our own wisdom regarding ourselves and science, was the attraction of the show.  It's the attraction of the scifi genre in general.

I hate to sound like an old man (though I am in my 50s), but in those days a genuine Star Trek fan was the real deal.  I don't think that's so much the case today, which is unfortunate.

The documentary doesn't state this, but, things like Star Trek, or even Star Wars as it stood in the 70s and 80s, was a window on what might be.  Brave men daring the beyond to meet dangers and other challenges with our full some of knowledge, and creating a better tomorrow.  And that even though things would be better, we could still engage in heroics with our better society.

That documentary doesn't say that, but that really was the spirit of the show as it stood in the 1970s and 1980s.  Those days are gone, but are replaced with kind of the same material with various superhero-scifi films that have some of the same kind of spirit (although they are worse in terms of production values and pretty paper thin when it comes to story material).

And I guess the reason I'm giving this four-stars instead of five is because the documentary is more of a retrospective on the early days of Star Trek conventions and fandom, and doesn't try to show the criteria for other scifi films, nor really ask any clinicians of the time nor now why Star Trek and the scifi genre in general really exploded in the very sedate and well mannered form that it did in the 70s.  I was there.  I was part of it.  I saw it first hand, but it's like the doc doesn't want to interview anyone outside the clique to give the layperson an understanding.

Is that good?  I don't know.  I think the show speaks for itself.  And perhaps that's the best praise I can give to both this doc and the actual TV show upon which it reflects.

If you're not a fan and want to understand the TV show and fandom, I would avoid this DVD.

If you're like me, and were actually there in SF-Oakland or at the Federation Trading Post on Telegraph next to the UC Berkeley campus, then maybe give this thing a whirl.

Either way, ""Live long and prosper.""",1512259200,,4844,4.406741573033708
8446970,5,B004XIV86K,It was very well done..had long interviews with alot of the main cast members...I went to a star trek convention back in the 1970's and they sure captured the feeling of that time..watchable over and over,1376265600,,204,4.694444444444445
8446971,4,B004XIV86K,"If you are a long-time Star Trek fan you are going to want this to relive the magical time that was the beginning of the phenomenon.  If you are a newer Star Trek fan you should get this so you can see where it all started.

This is a fantastic sligshot trip around the sun (for Star Trek IV fans) that takes you back in time to the very begining of the Star Trek legacy of the early 1970's.  There is footage of interviews of the people responsible for setting up the very first Star Trek conventions, the very first Star Trek store and the very first fans that attended the coventions and let their geek flags fly.

This is not as polished as either of the Trekkies DVDs, but what would you expect from video that was shot by amateurs, for amateurs.  If you love Star Trek you gotta have this.  Highly recommended.",1357084800,2,816,4.266233766233766
