7946337,1,B00005MNHF,I really didn't think to look at the VHS in the title....i simply didn't think videos would still be sold on amazon!!! so when it arrived i had to laugh...who the hell has a VHS player anymore?,1359849600,,193,4.243243243243243
7946338,5,B00005MNHF,I have may videos from the Quick Fix series and I would highly reccomend them all. The instructors are knowledgeable and friendley and the moves are easily explained and demonstrated. This is a good video-I usually do it on a day when I have been running or spinning. I am not a trainer and I do think that any excercise is better then none-but I would also reccomend some cardio excercise. It is a good additon to one's collection.,1123113600,,432,4.481012658227848
7946339,3,B00005MNHF,"I really like the way that Pilates can help you attain a leaner look within a short amount of time.  The instructor in this video is calm and very helpful which can be beneficial if you're new to Pilates.  I liked the timer at the bottom of the screen.  That's an added bonus.

Although health professionals are now insisting that we fit a full hour of exercise into our busy days, the bottom line is: who's got a full 60 minutes to spare?  This tape gives you a quick Pilates fix in ten minutes - or, if you have a whole half-hour to spare, you can do all three programs back-to-back.",1110844800,,585,4.2342342342342345
7946340,5,B00005MNHF,"If you follow it correctly, and eat an appropriate diet, you will see results. Pilates does more for people who have high metabolisms.

Do it right and you will feel the burn!",1109289600,3,175,4.46875
7946341,5,B00005MNHF,"This was my first Pilates video I bought and I love it! I disagree with the poster who says the workouts are not for the injured. I have a slipped disk in my neck, and the modifications suggested during the workout are appropriate, while still allowing a work out of your core muscles. I like the 10 minute segments (who doesn't have 10 minutes?) and have definitely seen results within a 3 week period doing 3 10 minute workouts and 1 30 minute workout. I also have less low back achiness at the end of my workday. The instructor provides clear instructions and helpful reminders during the segments.",1075420800,7,601,4.574074074074074
7946342,1,B00005MNHF,"the video had potential, but Tracy York did not impress me in this. She is kinda like a Denise Austin wannabe, and that bugs me. She is not at all genuine to me, overlyperky and annoying. I liked her other stuff, but this workout is terrible.",1059177600,2,242,4.282608695652174
7946343,5,B00005MNHF,"I bought this tape four months ago, and reviewed it three months ago. I still really like this tape, I am much stronger and recovering from injury. I have graduated to a denise austin piltes/mat work out series to alternate with this one. This tape is a great place to start on the road to pilates. Yesterday I did 30 mintues of belly dance, 20 mins of work out with hand weights, and 20 mintues of pilates, and 8 min abd tape. this tape got me started. go for it.",1051488000,17,464,4.166666666666667
7946344,5,B00005MNHF,"3 short (10-minute) workouts.  New to Pilates, it is easy to understand the principles from the introduction, and then get started.  Do all 3 workouts, and you have worked on toning and strengthening your entire body.  Builds strength without first requiring the strength of wonderwoman, and it is all floorwork (minimal sweat; important if you have a busy lifestyle, or choose to do the workouts as part of your morning routine).  Make sure you have a somewhat cushioned floor space.  I used a folded blanket on my hardwood floor.  Recommended as a good first step toward achieving fitness goals.",1012780800,65,597,4.97979797979798
