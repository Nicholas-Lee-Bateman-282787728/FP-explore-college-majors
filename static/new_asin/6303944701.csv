7856413,4,6303944701,I enjoy watching this for almost hour. I glad to see Sightings been almost 10 years since I last seen it.,1424822400,,105,4.0476190476190474
7856414,5,6303944701,Great show. Covers a lot of ground when it comes to UFOs and aliens,1409443200,,67,3.857142857142857
7856415,5,6303944701,"Why aren't all the episodes of this show on DVD or Netflix? Cable is filled with all those crappy UFO shows these days: Ancient Aliens etc. Those shows just make the topics seem silly. Sightings presented the best evidence for, not just UFO's, but all bizarre phenomenon. Seems like maybe someone doesn't want us to see this show anymore. They've almost convinced everyone that UFO's are just a big hoax. They want us to believe that mankind is almost at the peak of ultimate understanding of all energies in the universe. We're not even close.",1372032000,2,544,4.7368421052631575
7856416,4,6303944701,"I was a huge fan of the ""Sightings"" TV show, so I had to buy this video. For those who don't know, ""Sightings"" was a paranormal documentary show that ran in the 1990's. It started out on the Fox network as a few specials in 1991 and 1992. Then, it became a weekly series in the spring of 1992, running for two seasons on Fox until 1993. The show returned in 1994 as an all-new 1 hour weekly series in syndication and ran for two seasons. In 1996, the show was picked up by the Sci Fi Channel for its fifth and final season, ending in 1997. In addition, there were a few specials that aired on Sci Fi in 1998. All in all, a pretty good run for a show of this type. Other shows tried to copy it (""Encounters: The Hidden Truth"", ""Mysteries, Magic, & Miracles"", ""The Paranormal Borderline"", etc.), but none of those shows were as well-written or as stylishly produced as ""Sightings"".

This video compilation of some of the UFO / alien segments from the series is a good, although brief, overview of the topic. Most of the highlights are covered including, the Kenneth Arnold sighting, Roswell, Area 51, Project Blue Book, the Kecksburg incident, as well as more recent sightings such as Mexico City in 1991 and a Russian pilot sighting. The abduction phenomenon is covered, as well as the possibility of government cover-ups. Experts Stanton Friedman, George Knapp, & the controversial Robert Lazar are interviewed. Some skeptics are interviewed, too. New host narration segments with Tim White were filmed for the video (he appears to be outside near some radio telescope dishes). (If you are looking for the host segments where a team of people are in the background studio looking busy or the graphic lettering that framed each segment of the show's episodes, they are not in this video.) However, they do run the preview and opening theme sequence at the first of the video (it looks like its from the third season of the show).

The video is not perfect in that it is only approximately 58 minutes long. I would have prefered at least two hours. Also, it seems that they include more skeptical viewpoints in this video than in the other ""Sightings"" videos, for some reason (although, it is still mostly pro-belief). Still, if you're a ""Sightings"" fan or a UFO fan, it IS worth buying. Especially since you can get it for a cheap price through Amazon's marketplace sellers. (Also, check out the Sightings ghost and psychic videos.)",1147132800,4,2431,4.664335664335664
7856417,1,6303944701,"I seem to recollect a lot of other UFO episodes

from this program's multi-season run that

are not included in this skimpy collection.

Ergo: A total rip off!

Material presented is nothing special.

Less than its hours run time is largely wasted

with pedestrian narration, talking head interview

sound bites and hokey visualizations.

Avoid!

Go for the Unsolved Mysteries UFO set instead.",1127174400,4,393,5.209677419354839
