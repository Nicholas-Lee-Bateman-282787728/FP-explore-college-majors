4099382,4,B0039ZBM50,I love the scholastic signing videos for my two sons with autism!  My son loves to watch the people sign and I learn the signs while watching along.  When we try to recount the story my son is helped along with my signing the next word to remind him rather than speaking.  I believe the signing aids in his comprehension of the stories and the stories are well chosen.  They also love Goodnight moon and Five little monkeys!,1315353600,,424,4.397435897435898
4099383,5,B0039ZBM50,"The stories really come to life on this DVD! The ASL signers are just so excellent and the animation, voice over, and on-screen display of the words are all fabulously done and work really well together. This is no ""baby signing"" either. These stories are told in fluent ASL by native speakers. In that respect, this DVD is a great resource for families that speak ASL in the home for whatever reason. Out of all the ASL materials I've seen for kids, this is the BEST. This DVD is exactly what we have wanted for our family for almost three years now, since we found out our son is deaf and decided to raise him bilingually. The only complaint I have is: there aren't enough stories or DVDs in the series. More please!!!",1296777600,2,720,4.421052631578948
4099384,3,B0039ZBM50,"I really wanted this DVD to be great, but it missed the mark.  The signers take up almost the whole screen.  They stand in front of the pages, not at the side. The stories are well chosen, but my hearing children want to see the pictures, and they aren't picking up sign language.  I think it would have worked better if the signers had been off to the side, the way the words on a page don't interfere with the pictures.",1291248000,3,421,4.172839506172839
4099385,4,B0039ZBM50,"To improve vocabulary, comprehension, and fine motor skills, this October a series of DVDs comes out of Scholastic Storybook Treasures where you can now introduce your child to Sign Language!

A Pocket for Corduroy
1 DVD Disc being released October 26, 2010

When I first saw this title, I got really excited because I used to read the Corduroy books as a child and I had a live action version of the story on a VHS tape somewhere so I was hoping for the movie, but like the other DVD above, this is the book comes to life through illustrations and sign language. This DVD has a running time of 38 minutes plus extras of sign language vocabulary, comprehension quizzes, alphabet fingerspelling, and a read-along feature. ""A Pocket for Corduroy"" was written and illustrated by Don Freeman of the story of a little bear's quest for a pocket that takes him on a journey through the laundromat. The next story is ""Blue Burt and Wiggles"" that was written and illustrated by Derek Anderson about two friends who try to make the summer last forever because they don't want to say goodbye. The last story is ""Big Al"" by Andrew Clements and illustrated by Yoshi (Mario's dinosaur friend that eats eggs????). This is the story of a big guy without any friends because the other fish are afraid of him until the day he proves what a great asset he is and becomes loved by all. Each of the stories has a sign language professional on the screen telling the story so your child can practice along.",1288483200,4,1484,4.575187969924812
4099386,5,B0039ZBM50,"The latest entries in the Scholastic Storybook Treasures series incorporate sign language in the read-along stories. The DVDs in this series were designed to ""help children of all hearing abilities to gain literacy and pre-reading skills."" They teach early sign language skills in a format appropriate for preschool children. As in all the DVDs in the Storybook Treasures series, fun, colorful illustrations delight the eye as the story is told.

Scholastic Storybook Treasures - A Pocket for Corduroy offers the long-popular title story about the adventures of a stuffed bear that wanders off in search of a pocket while at the laundromat with his little girl owner. Two other stories on the subject of unlikely friendships are Blue Burt and Wiggles about two best friends who happen to be a bird and a worm that don't want to let summer end, and Big Al about a very big, very lonely fish who wants to make friends, but the smaller fish are afraid of him until they learn what a valuable friend he can be.

All three stories on each DVD are appropriate for toddlers, beginning readers, and beginning signers, and are recommended for ages two through nine. Captions can be left on or turned off. Extras include vocabulary and quiz activities for each story and a demonstration of the ASL (American Sign Language) alphabet. Each vocabulary exercise demonstrates the proper sign for a variety of the words used in the related story; the quizzes test comprehension. The stories and activities are designed to support vocabulary, comprehension and fine motor skills.

There are two very good reasons why parents of hearing children should introduce them to ASL. One comes from Scholastic: ""Studies have linked early sign language learning to improved fine motor skills, increased vocabulary [and] higher IQ scores."" The other is common sense: the more skills a child has, the more adaptable s/he is. This adaptability translates to increased opportunities",1279584000,2,1951,5.090625

4099390,5,B0039ZBM50,"My daughter is hearing, but is very interested in this DVD.  It has an ASL interpreter and just shows the pages of the story, it is not a moving cartoon, so I didn't know if it would keep her attention, but it does :)",1403308800,,217,3.9318181818181817

Since I am still learning to sign, I like that I can learn the stories to sign to her at bedtime. I wish more books were ASL interpreted for kids like these.",1359504000,,258,4.18
4099396,5,B0039ZBM50,"I was pleased to see the signing was going along with the pages in the book. I didn't know what to expect it would be like but quite pleased with the format. They zoom into a page in the book, added a small bit of animation to the page & then the signer is super-imposed onto the screen. The book is being narrated at the same time. My 25 year old niece with Downs Syndrome lived it! We both loved Manny Rodriguez (one of the signers)!",1358553600,,435,4.069767441860465
