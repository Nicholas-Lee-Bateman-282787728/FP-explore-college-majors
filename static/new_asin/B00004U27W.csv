1353681,5,B00004U27W,"I watched this for the first time when it was first aired on television quite awhile back, and I really enjoyed it. It was right around Halloween, and as always, I was on the look out for any good Halloween shows. Well, I wasn't disappointed. In fact, I recorded it, and I still watch it to this day, even if it isn't Halloween! I simply love spooky, Halloween tales. I will agree that the animation is very odd and game-like, but I actually kind of like it. I think it sort of adds to the mysteriousness and creepiness of an already creepy story. I'm glad it wasn't done in the typical pencil-drawn cartoon style, because strangely, I actually found the computer animation almost... lifelike. It was actually creepier than I think I expected, and definitely more gruesome. I don't think I'd recommend it for really young kids, because the graveyard scenes, as well as the beheadings, could be considered really scary by some. I would recommend it to anyone who loves the story of the Headless Horseman, and anyone who loves plain old spooky tales. What a treat it was to come home late at night and watch a well done Halloween tale!!

1353682,4,B00004U27W,"In October, I read and watch enjoyable stories of horror and suspense. ""The Headless Horseman"" is one of those wonderful works of fiction that I must see as it gets closer to Halloween. ""Night of the Headless Horseman"" is a fairly good adaptation to the classic short story. My only true criticism is that the computer animation reminds me of watching a video game. The characters in the film have no physical dimension. They do not look real. I truly needed to get past that in order to enjoy the story but it was difficult to do.
The animation is NOT ""Toy Story"". It was done for television. But the story is a definite classic. I highly recommend it as a way of retelling the story of the Headless Horseman and I will still always look forward to viewing it as a Halloween ritual.",1051833600,,783,4.444444444444445
1353683,5,B00004U27W,"Ok- so the animation is a bit odd. This film actually follows Irving's original tale better than most. I've seen several, usually boring, adaptations which attempt to tell the REAL story. This is the best so far, with or without humans. If you are looking for a film to pair with the story, this may be it. So, English teachers, this film is for you...",1029110400,,352,4.430769230769231
1353684,3,B00004U27W,"VERY interesting animation. Great for 7-10 year-olds. A bit slow, but when it gets ""scary"", it grabs your attention!",1004572800,,116,5.157894736842105
1353685,3,B00004U27W,"We're all blaming the low budget for making this a less than stellar production, but what we do have here is a retelling of the Legend of Sleepy Hollow that is well worth annual viewings at least. The film is done in computer animation, and it's no Toy Story. It's not done in great detail, looking very much like a video game sequence, with little or no background characters in any given scene. The actual animation of the figures is the worst part. If you ever wanted to see animated characters overact, here's the place! Their movements are exhaggerated and totally unnatural. The voice actors don't help much. Still, the film on a whole can be enjoyable. There are some extremely creepy visuals! Particularly the graveyard dream sequence. The unnatural look of it all may add to the creepy feel of the film. The story is much closer to the original than the Tim Burton version, which I also enjoy. Once again we find Ichabod Crane as a schoolteacher rather than a detective. The plot again being a simple matter of a haunting, with only a little extra storyline woven in, rather than in the complicated though wonderful Tim Burton movie. Overall this film is well worth having a copy for at least annual Halloween viewing. It really was wonderful to see a NEW Holiday TV special pop up...",999129600,4,1293,4.650655021834061
1353686,1,B00004U27W,"I had such high hopes for this one. I had just finished seeing Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow and was ready for another trip through that creepy town. I was disappointed, to say the very least. The story itself wasn't bad, I actually liked it. It was the execution of it that was so horrible. The CG artwork was the worst I have *ever* seen (The dance scene is a good example). God! They make better CG movies for video games these days. I would've rather seen it as a puppet show. Honest. Another thing that I really hated was the voice acting. It was too goofy for a story this creepy. And while it did have some creepy visuals (I'm talking loosly here) and a creepy story, the music doesn't fit. Period. Usually I'm very forgiving, but this was one of the few movies I actually dozed off as I watched. Don't make my same mistake. DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE. Watch Tim burton's Sleepy Hollow instead.",973209600,3,892,4.379518072289157
1353687,4,B00004U27W,"If you love this story (Legend of Sleepy Hollow) as much as I do, this is a great version to own. It's faithful to the original tale, but adds some  great plot threads into the mix without changing what makes the story so  wonderful.
This show was aired on Fox TV last fall (just in time for  Halloween and right before the Tim Burton version came out.) It's  refreshing to see an animated show (TV - computer animated or otherwise)  that's not just a forty-five minute commercial for toys. Whatever happend  to the days of Rudolph the Red Nosed Reigndeer or the likes that were just  enjoyable holiday specials? This movie took me back to that era.
This is  a good version of the classic story that's not as dark as Tim Burton's  vision but not as ""nice"" as the Disney telling either.
The plot  is a little slow at points and could have used a few more on screen back  ground characters or ""faces in the crowd"" (especially during the  Halloween party. I would have rated it five stars, but the points I just  mentioned brought it down a little. But since this seems to have been made  on a tight budget and was done with computer animation - maybe they were  just cutting corners a little.
There's some great voice work done by Luke  Perry and Tia Carrere. But my favorite is Clancy Brown (the Kurgen from the  first Highlander movie) as the ""Story Teller"" and another  characater (who I won't mention as it will spoil the plot.)
This is an  enjoyable movie for the low price. I would highly recomend it for older  children or adults (it's a little intense for little ones.)",968198400,4,1575,4.440559440559441
7923460,5,B00004U27W,"I love this movie and I wish it was on dvd and hope one day it will be. Night of the headless horseman was the first full blown animated movie I ever seen as a kid, and to this day I love watching it around halloween. Granted it is cheap animation, but it's still a great short movie.",1477699200,,284,3.913793103448276
7923461,5,B00004U27W,"I actually loved this when I saw it on Television. It's my favorite version of the story, but unfortunately I can't buy it because it doesn't come in DVD format. If it did, I would definitely buy it.",1443571200,,199,4.2631578947368425
7923462,4,B00004U27W,"This is an atmospheric rendering of the Sleepy Hollow tale done for television involving early computer graphics. It appears this art form has made some progress since this time (1999), but it still has a certain appeal. The quality of the VHS tape production is a little disappointing though and I would like to see it improved by DVD, but no release is available yet.(In fact, the home video tape I originally made of this off the TV looked better than this product). Finally, this does not run 63 minutes as claimed, but more like 48.",1384128000,,537,4.604166666666667

7923464,4,B00004U27W,"The biggest complaint about this movie seems to be that the stick figures overact. (The way I see it is that it was just a different form of art.) While this does not exactly follow the book, it is interesting. A young Washington Irving (obviously the character who will write the story eventually) is receiving a visit from a strange guest who tells the story of Ichabod Crane and the Headless Horseman.

For those of you who don't know the story, Ichabod comes to Sleepy Hollow as a new school teacher; he falls in love with Katrina Van Tassel; Bram Bones (who loves Katrina but can't commit to marriage) becomes jealous; and Bram thinks of how he can get Ichabod out of the way.

My only real complaint about this is a bad deviation from the book. (In the book, some of Ichabod's students really liked him.) Mark Hamil's character is interesting in that while he doesn't get involved in the main action, he does set the mood with his knowledge of the area.

Katrina's father is interesting in that he finds Ichabod annoying, but at the same time he protects Ichabod (to some extent) from Bram's threats. While he probably doesn't see Ichabod as a fit husband, he boldly tells  Bram: ""It is for my daughter to decide who will woo her."" He has his opinions, but he does seem to be governed by fairness.

There are some notable difference from the book, but mostly, these differences serve to make the story more creepy. (Seeing that this is a Halloween movie, that is alright.) In a surprisingly well done dance sequence, we see the one romantic moment between Katrina and Ichabod before the tragic climax.

In the book, we can have little (if any doubt) that it is Bram who disguises himself as the Headless Horseman and chases Ichabod off. But this movie leaves it creepily ambiguous. Did Bram disguise himself as the Headless Horseman, OR did he make a pact with the devil to conjure up the Headless Horseman? (This I think was an improvement.)

Just when we think the story is over, we go back to the house of Washington Irving, and we are offered one final moment of terror. (Parents should probably screen this before they give it to children.) Overall, it's a great short movie. Some differences from the book to be sure, but interesting and scary differences.",1222905600,,2268,4.612903225806452
7923465,2,B00004U27W,"""The Night of the Headless Horseman"" is the 3D animated version of Washington Irving's famous story, and this made-for-TV film follows the original story pretty faithfully. It also has interesting voice cast - William H. Macy as Ichabod Crane, Luke Perry as Brom Bones, Tia Carrere as Katrina Van Tassel, Mark Hamill as Van Ripper and Clancy Brown as Hessian Trooper, or the titular horseman.

However, you might find the film's visuals disappointing by the standard of today (I means, 2007). You know you cannot have the quality of Pixar here, but even so, the computer graphics of the film are not up to the standard we now expect. The characters' facial expressions fail to express their emotions even with the capable voice acting, and they sometimes move their limbs and heads very awkwardly.

I know time is not kind to the computer graphics (no one would say the same things about Disney's classic `Fantasia' created with traditional 2-D images), and probably it is not fair to complain. But this Washington Irving film is released in 1999, one year after `A Bug's Life `and two years before `Monsters Inc.' and if you compare the two films (both my favorite), you notice during three years we have seen tremendous technological progress in the field of CGI-based animations. Sadly ""The Night of the Headless Horseman"" seems to be unaware of the technologies in visuals, or - this is more serious - the tactful skills of storytelling and imaginative visual designs that these films are proud of.

Probably this film would have been better with more creative designs. The horse chase scenes at the climax are fairly thrilling, but the daytime scenes are sometimes terrible, especially the scenes of the kids in Ichabod's school, who look like badly sketched figures on the video games. Ichabod retains the original's image as lank person and ""worthy pedagogue"" as Irving wrote, but perhaps the filmmakers took the writer's words too literally as he wrote Katrina as a ""plump"" ""country coquette.""

The film's horseman claims `Any head will do,' but the fact is in animation that is not simply true. This animated film needs improved visual technology, or at least better storytelling and wild imagination.",1167609600,,2210,4.997282608695652
7923466,4,B00004U27W,"As far as I know this only played on TV one time, back in 1999 and never played again.  At least I don't remember it being on again.  I picked this up on clearance at MediaPlay last year for $2.99 and it was well worth that.  It is, of course a retelling of Washington Irving's first, great American Ghost story but updated with CGI computer animation.  You know it isn't a kiddie movie when the Horseman attacks a poor night traveler right at the beginning which leaves and ever-expanding pool of blood.

The prominent cast featured William H. Macy as Ichabod Crane, Tia Carrere as Katrina Van TAssel, Mark Hamill as Van Ripper, Luke Perry as Brom Bones, and Clancy Brown.  The animation was average as far as computer animation goes, I've seen worse but this was definitely not on the level of something done by Pixar or Dreamworks, that's for sure.  The animation did do a good job of capturing the eerieness and general creepiness of the old New England Sleepy Hollow setting and the voice actors did a a credible job.  All in all a pretty decent production, especially since it was made for TV.",1128902400,4,1099,4.543147208121828
7923467,4,B00004U27W,"If you are reading this, you probably know there are almost a dozen versions of this story on film. There are 4 fairly modern live action versions, a old silent film, about 4 that are traditional animation, 2 that are pictures from storybooks or paintings with narration, and this one that is 3 dimensional computer generated animation. This version was made as a television special. Fans of the original Washington Irving short story know the story very well, and grade it on a number of levels including -

Authentic atmosphere: the clothes and buildings fit the period very well, pretty authentic.

Actors or Voice characters: Very good here, including Mark Hamill, William Macey, Tia Carrere, and Luke Perry.

Spooky factor: Might be too spooky for some kids under 10, but spooky enough for the older crowd. Also the chase scenes and images of the headless horsmen are much longer than other versions.

Quality of visuals: Some people like or don't like the computer animation. The characters look a little stiff at times, it is definately not a $133 million Pixar movie. But the weirdness actually helps make it more creepy in the scarey parts.

Music: Pretty good.

Story/plot: This one follows the original story pretty well,it is entertaining.

Very fun story overall and I am glad I bought it.",1125360000,,1302,4.917808219178082
7923468,5,B00004U27W,"I've got a soft spot for this 1999 made-for-TV animated special.  The atmosphere is creepy, especially for a computer-generated film, the musical score is effective and the voices, including William H. Macy as Ichabod Crane, are dead-on.  Normally I can't stand motion-capture animation (where sensors re-create the exact movements of actors on a sound stage), but here the herky-jerky movement of the characters only adds to the eerie marionette feel of the film.  Not perfect, and not nearly as good as ""Sleepy Hollow"" or ""Ichabod and Mr. Toad,"" but a truly enjoyable ride through Sleepy Hollow nonetheless.",1107043200,,609,5.257731958762887
7923469,5,B00004U27W,"This show, ""Night of the Headless Horseman"" should be on DVD.

  It is a classic retelling of Washington Irving's Classic, ""The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow"".

 I am a HUGE fan of the story. I have seen every show on the subject, except for a 1922 silent version, which I want to see.

  Having seen every other show on ""Sleepy Hollow"", I can honestly say that this one is my all-time favorite.

  The reasons why, are as follows.

 First, this show has a good amount of The Headless Horseman in it.

Let's face it...the true star of the story is the Horseman.

  This version does the Headless horseman a great justice.

 It shows a good amount of him, it makes him look really cool, and it provides a nice twist at the end of the show.

  Secondly, this story, unlike the ""Sleepy Hollow"" movie with Johnny Depp, remains true to the vision that Washington Irving had when he wrote the story.

  Some have said that the animation isn't very good.

  Well, yeah, it kind of looks like a highly advanced video game, but so what?

  The scenery in this show is by far the best I have ever seen of the village of Sleepy Hollow.

 The Disney version had some great scenery in it, but not even that was as good as this.

  This actually had some good spookiness to it, whereas the Disney version was more toned down...... after all, it is a company that provides entertainment for kids.

  The creepy mill that is seen at the beginning of this show is cool. The chase that the Headless Horseman and his target, Ichabod Crane, take through Sleepy Hollow, is beautifully done.

  Really Cool!

  Also, Mark Hamill, who played ""Luke Skywalker"" in the Star Wars movies, does the voice of ole' Hans Van Ripper in this show.

 Mark's voice during the telling of the Legend of the Headless Horseman is classic!

  His voice is spooky, intriguing, and suits the story very well.

  This show has some funny parts to it. But it is mostly full of spooky action and fun.

  It's not exactly a family film, but then again, it's not nearly as violent as the ""Sleepy Hollow"" movie with Johnny Depp.

  For younger kids, I would say, show them the classic Disney version instead. Even that can be scary at times though.

  This is more for......I would say, kids who are teenagers. Maybe a twelve year old can watch it, without being too scared.

  It's hard to say.

  The show has some violence in it of course, since we are dealing with a Headless horseman in search of a head.

  Some blood is depicted, but it isn't done is a real sick way.

  I guess, the best thing to do is, for parents to watch it with their kids and then decide for themselves whether its appropriate for them.

  This isn't a ""Kids show"" by any means. This is a show that adults will enjoy alot.

  But I don't think that its anything that a kid will be too affected by.

  It originally aired on the FOX Network, around Halloween time, at about 9:00 at night. Maybe 8:30.

  So, that gives a good idea, of what kind of audience can watch it.

 It depends on how frightened a kid can get, or how much a parent is willing to let them view.

  In my view, this is the coolest, best, most accurate, most interesting, and most exciting depiction of ""The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow"" ever made.

  I love this show!

  If I am in the mood for some ""Sleepy Hollow"", I reach for this show first.

  It is wonderfully done.

  And the animation is beautiful, even if it isn't as advanced as in a ""Finding Nemo"", or ""Toy story"".

  The animation serves its purpose.....to bring to life, Washington Irving's classic story in a way that will intrigue, excite, scare a little, and do justice to the story.

 This is exactly what The ""Night Of The Headless Horseman"" does.

  Watch it. Enjoy it! But beware. If you find yourself walking through the village of Sleepy Hollow, New York, one night. And if you hear the footsteps of a galloping horse in the distance.....it just may be the Headless Horseman coming to pay you a spooky visit.

  Just as long as you don't get in over your head, you will be fine.
