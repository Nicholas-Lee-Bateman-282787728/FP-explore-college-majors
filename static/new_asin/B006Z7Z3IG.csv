5038447,5,B006Z7Z3IG,"Compelling and infuriating. Mr. Markopolos and his associates were calling attention to Madoff's fraud a decade before charges were ever brought. The SEC and the media is largely damned as well, for really doing nothing until Madoff's house of cards collapsed around him. These people can be respected for the work they've done, and the documentary spells out their chain of evidence in a way that's easily grasped for those of us who aren't financially inclined. One very small quibble: did the editor really have to resort to quick cut edits periodically?",1338508800,,557,5.065217391304348
5038448,4,B006Z7Z3IG,"Although this was probably a low budget film, it is something most people should see. It is mindboggling that the offices who should have discovered the fraud did not, including the media. it seems they were afraid of powerful people in high places. I am glad I purcased this film from Amazon",1336608000,6,292,4.634615384615385
5038449,5,B006Z7Z3IG,"Very interesting and informing from the point of view of an actual victim.  Since it affected me and my family directly, we were glued to the TV.  Madoff destroyed so many lives, and the sad part is that it could have been avoided.",1336348800,3,231,4.348837209302325
5038450,4,B006Z7Z3IG,"The big problem with rating this film I have is I do not know that much about the story. The other issue is that much of it is slow and poorly acted. To be fair these people are not actors and much of the slowness is simply because the subject matter is not particularly well suited for drama. Investment analysis is not nail biting drama.

Having said that, what let to me the story down is that very little technical analysis was shown about what alerted Markopolos and the other analysist that something was terribly wrong with Madoff's operation. It is covered but only very superficially.

What is covered is how difficult it was to get anyone to believe them? I would have thought that if the authorities were presented with credible evidence, they would look. Here apparently the film's story line is weaker than the book. The claim of the book is that the SEC was paid off by Madoff. Were they? I do not know. Madoff and everyone else associated with it are not talking so we do not know for sure.

Many people got hurt. Many I think were fools in putting all their money into one fund. If they had known anything of investments, it is a basic rule to not to put more than a third of your assets into any one fund. Some probably went to professional investment brokers who probably were seduced by the generous commissions that Mardoff paid.

The film itself is worth watching, and I would recommend it. If you are thinking of investing it may give you much to consider.",1334793600,,1478,4.462962962962963
5038451,4,B006Z7Z3IG,"I think this movie/doc was really good. I found it very interesting, and easy to follow. Harry and his team sure worked hard, and I'm glad they were able to get this very detailed dvd out.",1333670400,2,188,4.25
5038452,1,B006Z7Z3IG,"The story itself is interesting; the presentation of this 'documentary' is so thick with mellow-drama and bad re-enactments, the fascination is lost.  The main character, Harry, would be compelling as a financial investment guy, but instead tries desperately to come across as a tough sheriff in a really bad oater movie.  Too American, with the whole ""I carry heat"" drama.  Remove the repetitive black and white macho scenes and mock-ups.  Would save the audience an hour and make a more enjoyable doc.",1333411200,7,503,5.097560975609756
5038453,2,B006Z7Z3IG,"Very interesting story (that the film is based on) but the main protagonists (Harry) is sooooo veird!
Over dramatization of shootings (that never happened), photos of dead people (that has nothing to do with this movie) and Harry's constant talk of guns, battle drills, ambushes and not to forget double tapping!!!",1491091200,,314,5.176470588235294
5038454,4,B006Z7Z3IG,"Even though too much time is wasted on the history and life of the investigator, and in previous Wall St issues, this is still worth watching.

5038457,1,B006Z7Z3IG,"They take a very serious topic deserving of a better treatment and turn it into a comic book. I have never seen a documentary with so much manufactured melodrama. We see the main character taking gun lessons  and ""packing heavy"" on the night he turns over some documents. Madoff didn't need guns, all he needed were stupid people and they are never in short supply.

I do not feel sorry for the ""victims"". Their greed obscured the truth. Intelligent -? People believing that an investment can return profits every year regardless of real world results are naive at best and idiots at worst.  As one person in the film says there is no such thing as  an investment returns diagram of a consistent 45 degree plot.",1488585600,2,711,4.619047619047619
5038458,3,B006Z7Z3IG,"Could have been a lot better and more informative. I wonder if Harry Markopolos wrote the script himself, so much self-aggrandizing as he portrayed himself as some kind of warrior like Rambo. I will say that a lot of the over dramatized scenes just made me shake my head and laugh.",1488240000,,281,4.529411764705882
5038459,2,B006Z7Z3IG,"Terrible that people like Madoff commit the crimes they do but when yo listen to the victims ask where was the government oversight to prevent such a scheme leave the victims for years didn't ask any questions on how on earth year after year they were able to receive average 10% return on their investment which anyone who knows basics on Wall St knows that impossible. So the victims should have followed the old saying ""Buyer beware""",1486425600,,436,4.675324675324675
5038460,5,B006Z7Z3IG,The 2008 financial crisis forced a lot of fraudsters out of hiding.  We need more people that are willing to operate in the right way even if they could get away with operating in an unethical way.  We don't do things because we can.  We do things because we are.,1486339200,,263,4.22
5038461,2,B006Z7Z3IG,Not what I expected. After listening to The Ponzi Supernova on Audible I was expecting a better movie about Bernie Madoff. I am looking forward to the new HBO series that will be coming out next about Bernie Madoff.,1485993600,,215,4.538461538461538

5038474,5,B006Z7Z3IG,"I have never seen a documentary comprised so artfully powerful, riveting, inspiring and anguish-inducing at the same time as Chasing Madoff. Mr. Markopolos, you ARE a hero, and the fact that you're too humble to accept the title further proves the merit of my proclamation. Thank you for existing, sir.",1484870400,,302,5.06

5038480,5,B006Z7Z3IG,"Excellent documentary.  This filled in many gaps in my understanding of what took place, and was enlightening!  So unfortunate that the SEC could not be sued for every last penny and then some to return to those that lost so much.  Shameful.",1483056000,,241,4.690476190476191
5038481,4,B006Z7Z3IG,Very interesting look at how a few men saw this ponzi scheme for what it was and tried to inform the SEC...to no avail.

5038485,3,B006Z7Z3IG,"This was a good documentary on the Madoff ponzi scheme if you are interested in the story of Harry Markopolous and those who first sniffed out the fraud.  But I felt that it could have offered more on the subject from the perspectives of the SEC and Madoff or his aides.  One comes away with the feeling that the producers had 60 minutes of material but wanted a 90-minute feature film so they added much footage on Markopolous's fear, his guns, his family, etc.",1479513600,,462,4.488095238095238

What I never learned was why Madoff was made into the scapegoat for the entire Wall Street crash.

Madoff's clients were mainly banks, charities and investment firms using other people's money. Yes there were individual investors but they had to have a lot of money in order to invest with his company. Not like some people who have prayed on the elderly and people hoping to capture a piece of the American Dream who had their entire life savings stolen from them as in Trump University.  It is a story of ultimate greed and left me believing that Wall Street itself is a big Ponzi Scheme that only the rich can succeed at.",1474848000,,815,4.493243243243243

The Madoff subject matter is fascinating, however, there's this suffocating, unfounded paranoia about this whole deal.  The protagonist brags about how much ammunition he brought with him to give a package to Spitzer, that he has to check under the car for car bombs, and he doesn't want a double-tap to the head.  The dude starts talking about his plan to have his wife shoot down the stairway if there's an intruder and what kind of gun he carries.  It was nutty.  He obsesses - and that's okay.  That's the type of personality that would help uncover such a fraud.

However, there's no actual *proof* that the protaganist's fear was well-founded - or that Madoff ever knew of him.  Waste of a good backstory and outstanding cinematography.",1473638400,,816,4.86231884057971

5038624,1,B006Z7Z3IG,"This movie is a waste of time. The movie makers created drama out of simple but stupid paranoia from the interviewers. Yes, whistle blowing is dangerous, but so are delusions.

You will learm that so much was done to try to stop the Ponzi scheme, yet all was ignored, so even after it was highlighted for what it was, it went on for almost another decade before it self imploded. If this was not a true story you would consider this outlandish, but it did, so watch it and learn.  Greed prevailed, as did a blind eye.  It brings home the point:  If it is too good to be true...
We did this with Enron, the housing bubble. mortgage backed derivatives.

5038628,2,B006Z7Z3IG,"Loved the book on which this was based, but, in my humble opinion, the director sacrificed clarity and continuity in order to accommodate his (or maybe it's a her) sense of creativity. A documentary need not try to amuse viewers as this one did, lining up three of the men who were chasing Madoff and having the camera pan back and forth between them, which was disconcerting and annoying. In addition, unlike the book, this documentary didn't ""name names"" of SEC officials who basically blew off the whistleblowers when they contacted them and said there was no way Madoff was generating the returns he claimed he has. The book was angrier at the SEC (which I liked because the officials involved in this unfortunate situation were idiots who were certainly not doing their job) than the film.",1468454400,,794,4.802919708029197

Ironically even though all the info was there to convict madoff for a decade the reason he turned himself in was because the market crashed not because of the evidence against him. Some people are above the law because of who they know. I wonder how high madoff's influence went because every time he was going to exposed for fraud there was a diversion of the story. Heart breaking for so many who trusted him. No way to pay back those that where injured.

He (Harry) makes a great point when he states that it's the white collar criminal who does more damage to society than the guy selling $10 bags of weed on the corner.  He's not taking your life savings and robbing you and your family of a lifetime of work and saving.  It's the Madoff's of the world who will always do more damage to society because we think their crimes are 'elitist' crimes that don't affect anyone outside their circle.  Yes, it reads like fiction, but the reality is this actually happened and those who broke it open are the true heroes we have today.

5039164,3,B006Z7Z3IG,"I am a layman when it comes to Wall Street and all that goes with it, so going into a documentary like this I expect a couple things: 1. to probably get a little discombobulated with the various players and their individual roles in such major situations (where I have to assume there are many players involved), and 2. to learn a few things that I didn't know about the situation before watching, and those things would likely make me very angry.

Well, first, I can say, even as someone who didn't follow this story closely when it happened, I still didn't learn anything especially new either, and so that tells me there isn't really much of a story here (beyond what we've already heard from the news years ago). Secondly, the person who this particular story angle is centered on, the ""whistleblower"", never actually gets to blow the whistle at all so the story doesn't truly go anywhere. Instead it spends over an hour sensationalizing ""potential"" threats or 'he's gonna get caught this time!' moments, and then...nothing. Madoff turned himself in, on his timeline no less, the rich stayed rich, those that turned a blind eye continue to live their lives and enjoy their money, and those who didn't have much to lose are now in total poverty. The end. It's pretty much the same story over and over again when it comes to Wall Street so if you are looking for something beyond that simple truth you aren't going to find any justice or satisfaction here, and you aren't even going to learn anything new to boot. This one is basically only good for white noise.",1457136000,8,1564,4.625899280575539

The media and all those that were handed the documents should have been held accountable too after all, they withheld knowledge that could have helped multitudes of investors.  Harry is fortunate in the fact that more often than not, whistle blowers usually get destroyed in the end whilst those that should be held accountable move upwards even after they have been identified as wrongdoers and even after our leaders say they are going to set laws to help them.  If more people were diligent and had a conscience like Harry and his few friends, then this world would be a much better world.

That said, there is a limit to paranoia.  Even for me.

After watching ""Madoff"" -- a very nice film about Bernie Madoff, from a first-person perspective -- I had to watch this documentary.  And ""Chasing Madoff"" starts off really strong, but then it pretty much falls apart like a bad Ponzi Scheme, mostly due to editing.  The work that Harry Markopolos did to at least try to take down Mr. Madoff was pretty terrific, but here, at least by the third act (does this thing really have three acts?), Mr. Markopolos just appears TOO paranoid.  Would someone kill someone else for 50 billion dollars?  Oh, sure; people have been killed for a pair of 100 dollar sneakers, others for even less.  But I think all of the scenes showing Mr. Markopolos loading his gun, locking doors, turning on home alarms, etc. ad nauseum becomes, well, just nauseating.

Without giving much away, towards the end, Mr. Markopolos is shown faxing documents frantically that are in his office as he fears a last-minute SEC invasion.  I can understand fearing that organization -- they had more than enough reason to hate him because they ignored him previously, at their and investors' peril -- but why didn't he have his data stored digitally already, maybe in a safety deposit box?  By 2008, he probably could've had all of his data on one Blu-ray disk, or at least in ""The Cloud.""

Will Mr. Markopolos hate me because I'm giving this film a minor pass?  Well, I'd have to be paranoid to think that, and I'm sure he's smart enough to realize that the director could have done -- should have done -- a much better job in the editing room.",1455667200,,1841,4.587155963302752

5039391,3,B006Z7Z3IG,"A decent if pedantic study of Harry Markopolos, the guy who uncovered and reported the Madoff Ponzi scheme nearly 10 years before the collapse. It details his efforts to alert the SEC and other federal agencies, the media, and other investors to the fraud, though no one ever listened. In that it was somewhat interesting to see how he uncovered the fraud and his efforts to alert others.

However, there are too many moments discussing possible risks to Markopolis' life and family that aren't well detailed or documented. They keep mentioning possible ""contract hits"" on him and his family from both the Madoff people, the Mafia, and even the SEC, without ever truly giving proof that Madoff or the SEC ever killed someone for reporting a fraud. It makes Markopolos seem paranoid and delusional. Perhaps those details were in the book and got left on the editing floor.

If you're looking for a detailed account of the Madoff scandal, I would turn to a Frontline piece or other more in-depth reporting on it. If you're looking for a profile of the person who uncovered that fraud, well, this is mildly entertaining....",1455667200,,1120,4.858638743455497

5039394,3,B006Z7Z3IG,This documentary should infuriate everyone.  It tells of the lack of competence in the SEC and how this sociopath could have been caught sooner if not for American greed. It also shows how white collar crime goes unpunishable.,1455667200,,226,4.947368421052632

5039512,5,B006Z7Z3IG,"Besides the Vatican, the United States is the most corrupt country since the Roman Empire. It is corrupt from the president, the federal agencies, congress and the judiciary to state governments and licensing clerks, all of Wall Street, the military, the police, the bankers, the lawyers, American businessmen and all religious organizations. Organized crime consists not only of the mafia and ""the mob"" but with equal participation of the aforementioned groups from the president on down.  While greed is a primary characteristic of human beings, there has rarely been such an excess of any sociopathic quality as exists here today. People like Harry M. are few and far between; the world is run by those losers who sat in the back of the classroom and learned nothing. Evidence for this can be seen in any newspaper, news report, criminal records and just day to day life. Fortunately, the beauty of climate change - primary caused by American fossil fuel companies - is that it will destroy the planet and rid the universe of the human species once and for all. Or maybe, a few people will watch documentaries such as this one and realize that the giants of American society can truly be put in prison.

On the one hand, one might early on excuse the SEC et al. for dismissing Harry Markopolus' claims as a ""competitor,"" tasked with coming up with a product capable of competing with Madoff's products but unable to do so, attempting to ""use"" the government agencies as a vehicle to smear another successful business with which he was unable to derive a competitive product.  However, after the details emerged, and especially following Madoff's confession, conviction & collapse, the continuing story is WHO was slow playing the investigations across all those government watchdog agencies - I am unable to believe that this was merely a result of ""incompetence"" across every potential agency charged with such inquiries  Madoff had to have had multiple enablers at the highest levels for such agencies to ignore such compelling evidence.  There should be a sequel to this brilliant piece, exposing WHO those folks were that chose to sit on or ignore the mountain of compelling credible evidence presented to them on a silver platter by Mark Markopolos, resulting in at least 7 additional years' perpetuation of Madoff's scheme and countless additional lives destroyed.

Prosserman gives proper weight to the unholy marriage of Madoff's greed and the SEC's apparent incompetence --- even as whistleblowers laid the case at the government's feet.

The other 90% swirls around Harry Markopolos' severe paranoia, discussing 'double taps' and 'shoot move communicate' and all his awesome military training and having to check under his minivan for car bombs. How his suburbia life was so abnormal as he was obviously robbed of his ability to enjoy his sons' taekwondo practice because of the impending SEC sting on his house to steal secret files in Harry's den that maintain that the SEC is incompetent.

5039715,2,B006Z7Z3IG,"First, the pluses:
The subject is riveting. And the documentary did manage to impart some information about it.

Now, the minuses:
I have never seen such ridiculous overdramatizations in a documentary in my life. Roughly half of this movie - time that could have been spent going into the SEC's version of things, or delving into the 300 groups that just get a mention at the end of the film, or even delving into the math... was instead spent on film cuts of people storming banks that had nothing to do with Madoff, film cuts of mob hits that, in the end, had nothing to do with Madoff, photos of dead people that had nothing to do with Madoff, fake explosions that never happened, dramatized arrests that never happened, and even the interviews, in order to make them more dramatic, were filmed with a camera that slowly turned from a straight angle to a dutch angle. A simple resignation was filmed with an image of the protagonist disappearing in a puff of smoke. All the interviews of the main people are shot against a pure black background. A dropped reference to one of the people having gotten a mob threat in an unrelated incident earlier in his life - that came to nothing, was punctuated by a cut to a photo of a random murder with a booming sound effect. Typing is punctuated with the sound effect of furious typing on a typewriter - even though the people are actually typing on computers. The list goes on and on. So much effort, that could have instead gone to investigative journalism. Ugh.",1453766400,56,1508,4.564575645756458

5039733,5,B006Z7Z3IG,"REALLY LIKED THIS. I was ignorant that whistleblowers actually discovered Bernie's ruse NINE...long...years...prior to his arrest! Learn the ""backstory"" of how this could happen and to the mind-numbing extent of $65M. But the REAL story here is how our US government and its watchdog, news media, spectacularly turned a blind eye to the whistleblowers who attempted to inform of the Ponzi Scheme -- and in doing so, feared for their lives and families. Wild. Bernie constructed a web of greedy ""feeder"" agents (individuals, brokerage firms, etc.) who just brought him the cash by way of commissionable sales. Now if you're looking for a close examination of the financial sufferings of elderly people who lost their entire life savings; a laundry list of celebrity investors; or videos of smiling Bernie and Ruth on their yachts, in their luxury homes, etc. -- this is NOT what you'll get. You're going to get a very well presented, laying-out-of-facts and experiences. Personally, I appreciate these types of viewing opportunities which assumes I won't be the dullest knife in the drawer.

I found it a bit much and tested my limits of credulity.

The ploy was that all of us here in this room are smarter than the rest of the world and we are all going to get rich by buying into this before it is too late.

5039792,5,B006Z7Z3IG,"Four and a half SCHEMING Stars. This docu-drama covers the discovery of the massive ""ponzi scheme"" run by Bernie Madoff.  The film also introduces the small group of concerned financial experts who made the ponzi discovery and their determined attempt to disclose the facts through a number of means within the government and thru media. Madoff's connections were a powerful shield. Actual Madoff clients sadly discuss the effects of their losses. Along the way we meet SEC conflicts of interest, security concerns, feeder funds, cross family interests, 29 flags, Congressional committee angst, and the after effects. The human tragedy, the number of companies involved, and the amount of money lost was immense. Portraying themselves: Harry Markopolos, Frank Casey, Neil Chelo, Marc A. Hermann, Gaytri Kachroo, and Bernie Madoff. Directed by Jeff Prosserman. Highly Recommended. Four and a half INVESTIGATIVE Stars. (MPI Media Group. Unrated. Color. CC.

5039815,5,B006Z7Z3IG,"Everyone should watch this. It may not be to your taste in entertainment, it does show the way money flows and that you should look into the financial reports of companies you do business with. For example-I was looking for life insurance and found a really great rate. When I looked into the company financials to make sure that my child would get paid should anything ever happen to me I found that the financials showed an extreme lack of available funds. This is a HUGE well known corporation. When the money did not make sense I opted to go with a different life insurance company even though this one had a high rating. Delve into these companies and make sure you know what you are getting into. Stocks are basically a crap shoot. You can win if you use due diligence for the most part.

He's an insufferable character who'd have you believe he was in danger of being gunned down not only by Madoff but the SEC (as if the latter was the CIA or something).

5039996,5,B006Z7Z3IG,"Everyone should watch this documentary, even if you think you're familiar with the Madoff story.
The media did not report on a lot of the details, and there are things here that you may not have not heard before.
The main thing is that the Madoff Ponzi scheme was much bigger than most people realize; it was truly global in scope and people all the way up to many European royal families (and perhaps Prince Charles) were affected.
Also, Madoff did not act alone.  He kept the smallest slice of the pie for himself and made sure that all the feeder funds made big money.  There was also offshore or ""dark"" money invested in Madoff's scheme.

Because of this, Markopolos had valid reason to fear for his life.

Also, prior to watching this documentary, I was not aware of the story of Thierry de la Villehuchet, which was tragic.  Markopolos seems to think he was involved with head-hunting for Bernie, while Harry's colleague Frank Casey believes Thierry was an honorable man who got duped like everyone else.  Either way, it was sad to hear how he despaired and took his own life when the scheme came crashing down.
Also the story that Frank Casey tells of ""Abe"" and his failed attempt to warn his new wife and father-in-law to not invest was sobering and sad to hear.
Saddest of all is that almost no one listened to Markopolos and his colleagues; the economy is what brought Madoff down.  Even though Markopolos was invited to testify before Congress, and received praise from some representatives, you could tell he was not a welcome guest there; but they finally had to listen to him since the scheme had blown up due to the financial collapse.  Most politicians are beholden to Wall Street, just as the SEC seems to be, and I don't think Washington really wanted to hear what Harry had to say about the corruption of the system. If the politicians truly appreciated Mr. Markopolos, they would have appointed him head of the SEC. Can you imagine what things would be like on Wall Street if Markopolos led the SEC?  But no politican who has taken money from Wall Street (and that's almost all of them) would ever dare nominate him.
One other thing I found interesting was when Harry's colleague alludes to the other great Ponzi scheme: ""God forbid we should ever lose confidence in the US Dollar"", but that's a tale for another documentary.

The main lesson I took away from this documentary is that you can't trust government or Wall Street to protect your money; like Maggie Mahar or Catherine Austin Fitts would say, you must get your money off Wall Street and put it on Main Street if you want it safe - buy a home, a business, gold and silver, or other hard assets, and be sure to bank with a local bank or credit union that is conservative and well run.

Everyone should watch this film so that they understand how corrupt the system is.",1388448000,31,2848,4.575638506876228

5039998,4,B006Z7Z3IG,"""How are they supposed to have confidence that if somebody goes to you with a complaint--gives it to you on a silver platter with all the investigations, with all the numbers, with all of the data, telling you exactly what he did, how he did it, and why he did it and how he knows that--and after a period after half a dozen or eight years, you don't know anything?""
This is a direct quote, shown in the film, from Representative Gary Ackerman from New York, who, for my money, is one of the stars of this film. The quote is from a hearing with the big shots of the SEC, the US government's financial 'watchdog', which was/is supposed to protect the interests of the American investor. Obviously the SEC and other very reputable and revered organizations and publications, fell down on the job or more likely, simply looked the other way, when given the evidence and facts showing Madoff's fraud. To back up, way back in 1999, Harry Markopolos, a smart financial guy who worked for Rampart Financial, an eastern investment firm, looked into the amazing returns claimed by a mysterious firm overseen by a mysterious person with the initials ""BM"". Markopolos looked at the 45 degree straight line showing the unwavering gains made over several years, and had never seen anything like it. He immediately smelled a rat, for he had NEVER seen a similar pattern of return for ANY company! It was simply too good to be true.
Long story short, he spent much time and effort and risk, over some eight or nine years, to expose Madoff, provided conclusive evidence to the SEC, the Wall Street Journal and other world as well as national news agencies, and they all chose to ignore the story! It was not until the 2008 financial meltdown that Bernie himself realized he could no longer continue the charade, and threw in the towel. Only then did the SEC and the other organizations acknowledge the work done by Markopolos and his associates.
If you have an interest in this amazing story, you should watch this film. I do have to say that I found it to be a bit on the overly dramatic side to focus so much attention on Markopolos' fear of reprisals from shadowy Madoff-hired assassins and so on, but then again, I was not the one blowing the whistle on a seemingly evil gazillionaire like Madoff. I read the Oppenheimer book entitled ""Madoff with the Money"", which I'd recommend also, and, based upon the portrait of BM painted in that book, one doesn't come away with the impression that BM is truly 'evil' and physically dangerous. Yes, incredibly dishonest, consciousless, rapacious and avaricious, but also absent-minded and even a bit dull and dim-witted. For example, Bernie could never seem to master the computer.
The movie does not get into Madoff's family history at all, which would have been enlightening if you wish to ask 'why' or 'how'. For that, read the Oppenheimer book or one of the others, and see the Frontline program.
I live in Minnesota, and there is a suburb west of Minneapolis called St. Louis Park, which was and is a popular area for Jewish families to live. I understand that there are many very wealthy and prominent Jewish investors who lost their life savings through Madoff. I feel for them....but the lesson here is that you need to be vigilant and careful with your $$.

5040000,2,B006Z7Z3IG,"First off, let me just say that I highly respect Mr. Markopolos and fully acknowledge that he was one of the few people who labored mightily to bring down the Madoff fraud. Unfortunately this documentary comes up way short when discussing the nature of the Madoff scheme, then quickly drowns in over-dramatizations of Markopolos extreme paranoia.

If you wish to gain a better understating of the Maddof affair and how Harry Markopolos fits into the picture, I highly recommend Frontline's documentary on this topic, or Diana B. Henriques book ""The Wizard of Lies."" If you want to see 45 minutes of extraneous footage of Mr. Markopolos loading clips into handguns, putting on body armor, or peeking through blinds, this is the movie for you.

Look, I get that Mr. Markopolos probably felt a great deal of stress going up against someone as powerful as Madoff, but in hindsight the level of his panic was probably not justified; the story since revealed shows that Madoff didn't regard Markopolos or the Media as anything other than a small roadblock to amassing new clients. Markopolos really jumps the shark when, after the Maddof scheme implodes, he becomes absolutely convinced that the SEC is imminently going to execute a raid on his home and assassinate him and his family in order to hide the evidence of the SECs failings. He has his wife stand at the top of stairs, gun drawn, with instructions to shoot anyone who tries to enter; meanwhile he goes to a nearby pizza shop to fax some documents to a reporter. The whole segment is absolutely bizarre.

Frankly, if Markopolos acted at all in person like he comes off toward the end of this documentary, I can understand why so many people wrote him off as someone whom not to take seriously. This in no way excuses the SEC from its failure to act however. Harry Markopolos was absolutely right about Maddoff, it is just a shame that he was so ineffective at making the case to everyone else.",1369008000,28,1948,4.740412979351032

5040010,3,B006Z7Z3IG,"I am not sure of the etiquette re: spoilers for a documentary?

Lets start with all the critique: loud dramatic music, frequent cut-ins, excessive filler (Markopolos showing his wedding photos, visiting his old HS and the cop that signed his carry permit).  YES, YES AND YES!  Could the film have been cut in half to 45-minutes?  YES!  Markopolos coming off as a paranoid Schizophrenic (checking his mini-van for bombs and deciding that if it came out he was behind the investigation that he would have to kill Madoff before Madoff killed him).  YES!  Does Frank Casey come off as a polished Wall Street Salesman who prompted Markopolos because he wanted the business for their firm (Rampart) and they couldn't compete with Madoff?  YES!

What makes the program worthwhile is that the scheme was actually exposed TEN YEARS BEFORE MADOFF WAS PROSECUTED!

What is interesting to me is how many people actually had to be aware and how easy it was for a semi intelligent ""quant"" to identify fraud within a relatively short time of analysis, as both the sheer volume of trades that needed to have been made to support the return profile would have exceeded the total of all options currently being traded and that the third party clearing firms were not doing business with Madoff!  Without getting too technical, the latter is actually more telling then the former, as there are only a handful of specialist firms that would have had to be involved to facilitate the volume of trades that needed to be made to support the reported volume.  I to this day don't understand how this could have gone un-noticed by even a junior SEC audit team.  It latter came out that Madoff had not done a single trade since the 1990's!

I am not a conspiracy theorist per say, though as a financial professional with +25-years of experience, I can't fathom how Madoff could have pulled it off without protections at the highest level?

""When Markopolos got his hands on a copy of Madoff's revenue stream, he suspected problems almost immediately. To his mind, Madoff's strategy was so poorly structured that on paper, it couldn't possibly make money. Additionally, his return stream rose upward with only a few downticks--a nearly perfect 45-degree angle. Markopolos knew that the markets were too volatile even in the best of conditions for this to be possible. He believed there were only two ways to explain the figures--either Madoff was running a Ponzi scheme (by paying established clients with newer clients' money) or front running (buying stock for his own account based on knowledge about his clients' orders). Either way, Markopolos believed there was no legal way for Madoff to deliver his purported returns. Markopolos later said that he knew within five minutes that Madoff's numbers didn't add up. It took him another four hours to prove that they could have only been obtained through fraud""

""He also couldn't find any evidence the market was responding to any Madoff trades, even though by his estimate Madoff was running as much as $6 billion--far more money than any known hedge fund even then. In Markopolos' mind, this suggested that Madoff wasn't even trading.""

5040011,5,B006Z7Z3IG,"Harry Markopolos, 'is no hero' - these are his words.

Having served in the military, and experiencing the ambiguity and moral failure of contemporary life, I too struggle with questions of 'right and wrong' in the context of business.

This documentary describes a kind of man that is rare these days - quiet, thoughtful, loving, good and brave. If you have given up on the American business man and believe that the Wallstreet crowd is rotten to the core, then know this - Harry Markopolos exists, his story is true and we can hope there are more men and women like him.

The documentary itself is different from others I have viewed on the 'Madoff Affair'. I, personally, have a deep interest in the macroeconomic and systemic failures that were background to the Madoff incident, but the Madoff story is part of the general failure of American finance in the 2 decades that led up to 2008 - and, frankly, this same corruption persists today.

A core question, which the film keeps in the background throughout, is the following: 'why didn't anyone at the SEC take action?'. This question is difficult, because we have been led to believe, in the modern era that 'regulation and regulatory agencies keep us safe'. But I suspect the answer is more obvious and frightening: Madoff was an extraordinary and evil 'shark' in waters filled with criminals and 'sharks'. If Madoff's scheme was a moral outrage, then what do we say of Goldman-Sachs and its 'guarantee' that allowed Greece to enter the EUROZONE in the early 2000's? I digress, but I fear the reason for the SEC ignoring Mr. Markopolos is because ANY dent in the presumed 'genius' and 'professionalism' of WALLSTREET threatened all of the crooks.

Where this story is strongest is in fusing the 'character story' of Mr. Markopolos with the 'technical' aspects, but for wonks there is little to no 'depth' in the technical explanation. The fact that this documentary stays a bit above the technical side of the story is no weakness - there are many films which cover these core financial topics and do it well. But, I think we needed a story about men like Mr. Markopolos, and Mr. Casey and the others who assisted and kept the faith.

Harry Markopolos is no hero - he is simply more than that. He is a man of conscience and action in a world that is slipping towards darkness.",1344729600,2,2335,4.71078431372549
