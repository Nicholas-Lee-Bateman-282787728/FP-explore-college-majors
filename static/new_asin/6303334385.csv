Luckily, the store I  purchased it from allowed me to return it.  I cannot believe a vhs tape was  wasted on this... Do not waste your money on this one...better yet get any  video from Atea and enjoy a real bellydance video.",965088000,9,353,4.1940298507462686

632559,1,6303334385,"I am a beginner, learning with a friend, we watched the tape - this was our first exposure to bellydancing (what a shame). Her warm-up is very quick, once she teaches you a ""move"", she doesn't practice with  you enough before she goes onto the next movement. We had a hard time  following the routine since it scrolled down very quickly onto the screen.  We were very confused the first time we watched it. Then you endure the  horrible 10 minute intro from ""Eddie"" and her 10 minute  ""performance"" at the end of the tape. We are currently on the  search for a BETTER tape.",961027200,7,573,4.40952380952381

632561,1,6303334385,"This was the first belly dance instructional video I ever bought.  When I popped it into the VCR, I was excited.  I soon became disillusioned.
If this is the only exposure anyone ever gets of the dance, s/he will be  disillusioned.  Between Eddie's sickening ain't-she-purty speech and  Janine's horrible ""dancing"" (flailing/hopping) there is little of  educational value which can be gleaned from this horrid  tape.
Nevertheless, the video is entertaining in a B-movie kinda way.  Janine hopping and twirling the hankies made me burst into laughter despite  myself.
The only thing this tape can teach is how NOT to dance.",947030400,54,622,5.14
632562,1,6303334385,"... I wouldn't reccommend this video. It't just not representative of the beautiful Belly Dance. It was a wonderful gesture on the part of her husband Eddie Rabbitt however and should have been kept in their own personal collection. I did enjoy her performance at the end though. For a nice video for beginners at a reasonable price, I would reccommend "" The ancient art of oriental belly dance vol. two"" by Alexandra King or something by Neena and Veena.",946512000,,455,4.7
632563,2,6303334385,"This video would be laughable, except that in many libraries, etc. it is the *only* bellydance video available; it does NOT represent this dance form well!  Rabbitt is well-intentioned, but is only a mediocre dancer and much of her history is inaccurate.
 In a recent conversation on videos on med-dance (an email discussion group composed of Middle Eastern dancers,  musicians, and aficionados), this one ranked at the bottom.  I would have given it a ranking of ""1"" except that at least it has decent production values and she's not wearing a stripper-esque costume.  END",890697600,56,573,5.053191489361702
632646,1,6303334385,Janine is just an ok dancer - she reminds me of a beginning student in her first performance. This tape is not one to learn from because her technique is stiff and rather ugly. We have used this tape at parties for comic relief - sorry Janine. It almost would be good to have in your library to view on those days that you need a burst of confidence. Watch a bit of this one and you will realize just how good a dancer you are compared to her....,1034121600,4,446,4.022471910112359
632647,4,6303334385,"I am very new to Belly Dancing, and this is a great video for starters. It first starts with a brief history of belly dancing, then she has several dance routines(i think 4), but she teaches them step by step. At the end of each routine you put the moves together and it is just beautiful! I must admit she does go just a tad bit too fast, but I thinks it's due to nervousness. Belly dancing is great for the Mind, Body, & Soul! Enjoy!",1031529600,2,435,4.069767441860465
632648,1,6303334385,"I am a bellydancer and when I purchased this video, I was disappointed.  I dance on professional level, but I keep learning from other dancers, because each one has different style.
Janine's video did not show correct movements, let alone her hands.  Her hands and wrists were stiff.  When you dance, your arms and hands should flow gracefully.  Of course beginners might not get it right away, but it is teacher's responsibility to teach correctly, which Janine did not do.
She seems like a sweet lady, but if she wants to bellydance, needless to say, she needs to start all over again and work on her hands, as well as develop graceful moves.
If someone is interested to buy a good bellydance video, I would suggest Mesmera's Dance of the Serpent, Atea, Sahra Saeeda or Rania for they are all great dancers.",1028505600,2,809,4.676056338028169
632649,3,6303334385,"This video begins with a testimonial from Eddie Rabbitt, beloved husband and apparent producer of the star of this video, Janine Rabbitt. He urges us to avoid the kind of skepticism he first experienced, and enjoy his wife's dancing expertise.
There's your first clue. When the husband vouches for the video, it is suggested that the video's merits are not self-evident, which is immediately raises suspicion, and is more than a little demeaning to ""the little woman"".
Janine proceeds to provide a sincere and warm introduction to the video, admitting that she was once a ""klutz"". Upon viewing the video, this is not too hard to believe.
Having been introduced to Bellydance by the lithe and lissome Veena and Neena, this video struck me as decidedly amateurish. The moves are not as graceful as what I had hoped for. As I previewed the warm-up, I realized that I was not comfortable putting my body at Janine's mercies, probably because her background is clearly not in physical education. I'd much rather warm up with someone professional like Kathy Smith, because Janine seems to rush and jerk through the stretches. A girl could get hurt!
Janine is clearly a wonderful person, but not someone I want to entrust my health to.",1020643200,4,1228,4.880382775119617
632650,1,6303334385,"I initially liked this video when I bought it 4 years ago. Having just recently been able to take a class with a ""live"" instructor, I have to radically change my opinion on this video. Now I know what good teaching really is.
This video stinks. Janine is clearly passionate and enthusiastic about Middle Eastern dance, but she can't teach, and is, at best, a mediocre dancer herself. The students who appear in this video with her, I'm assume they are her students, are divided between ""more graceful than the teacher"" and ""totally inept."" This further illustrates the fact that she cannot teach.
In addition to...sloppy demonstration, the introduction has so-called facts about the history of belly dance that are just plain WRONG.
DO NOT waste your money on this; Atea's video Magical Motion is better (for rank beginners), and Neena and Veena (Sensual Art of Bellydance series) are tapes that my dance teacher recommends as something to use between classes.
It's so much better to take a class with a teacher, you get feedback that way - try looking [online] for an instructor near you, she lists teachers and performers all over the world.",1012780800,4,1143,4.866666666666666
632651,1,6303334385,"I was disappointed with this video. I've taken belly dance classes
for about a year now and wanted a video I could practice what I learned with. Well, Janine is a very good dancer but not a very
good intructor. She rushes through the warm up and routines so
fast that I had a hard time following her. Most of the tape is
her performing at the end with is longer then the intruction

632652,1,6303334385,"I rented this video from the library because I was interested in learning more about belly dancing. I had never done it before, but it looked like fun so I thought I'd give it a try. When Janine walked out in that hideously unflattering pink outfit, I just couldn't help but laugh. Once she started dancing it was clear to me that I had picked the wrong tape to watch. She looked like an ameture, not an experienced, professional belly dancer. She was not graceful in her moves what so ever. Janine is an awful instructor and should have never released this video. Giving this tape a one star rating was being generous, it deserves a rating of zero, as in I learned ZERO by watching this video.",984787200,,694,4.4296875

632654,1,6303334385,"I bought this tape when i was a begginer dancer and the only thing i have learned from this was the basic zills rythm otherwise do not follow her  instructions because she can't isolate anything and she is swaying all over  the place in all her moves. It costs too much for a poor instruction video  and poor performances ,you should spend your money somewhere else.",966470400,14,366,4.515151515151516
632655,1,6303334385,"Yes, even this tape has worth.  I was a professional dancer and still  teach the dance.  One of my favorite past-times is collecting BAD BELLY  DANCE TAPES and this tape is one of my prize acquisitions.  When I teach  dance in a set number of lessons (like 12 at the YMCA) I usually pull out  my BAD belly dance collection at lesson #6. For beginning students who may  still be self-conscious or feel that they are ""just not getting the  hang of it"" this tape is a great boost to the ego.  They laugh and can  point out the errors.  They feel good about their own level of beginning  performance.  As one student put it ""And I thought I was doing  bad...and she got paid for this!!"" But even on this tape I saw a  ""nice move"" here and there that can be performed correctly and  incorporated into a good routine.  Now would I recommend it to someone who  wants a tape to learn by?.... NO, but if you bought it already - don't  throw it away.  Even bad examples are examples... just don't repeat the  same mistakes.  Besides, if nothing else, this tape is a testament to the  fact that Eddie ""really"" loved his wife - he supported her in  this effort, didn't he?  It is just a shame that so many people purchase it  ""seriously"" hoping to learn belly dance from it.",965260800,12,1262,4.282051282051282
7844744,1,6303334385,"This is the second Belly Dance Program I'd bought. I think I bought it because the Instructor is the Widow of Eddie Rabbit. I didn't know of her until this program. I bought this program from one of the several clubs I had been a member of through the years. In fact I wound up with two copies, but I did not order the second one. I believe I tried it twice. I know I didn't enjoy it. So eventually it went into a box, which not to long ago went right along with the box full of other discarded videos to the Goodwill.

I didn't like this program. It taught me absolutely nothing. I couldn't follow it. It wasn't even simple enough to follow. I don't think Janine was a well practiced Belly Dancer. She probably just went somewhere and learned just enough to make a video. I think a person should know their art or craft before they attempt to teach it to someone, especially if money is earned. I suppose this is one of the risk of purchasing Instructional Videos/DVD'S. There is no way to know if it will be useful. This is why it is good to borrow from the Library before purchasing. I think this is a lesson well learned. BORROW BEFORE BUYING!!!",1442793600,,1149,4.270642201834862

7844750,4,6303334385,"I bought this tape when I first became interested in belly dance. Since then I've watched several other belly dance tapes and I cannot understand the bad reviews this one received. Janine Rabbitt does a really good job introducing viewers to the history of belly dance and the basic moves. I learned to do snake arms quite well from this tape and I also learned how to manipulate a veil. I thought the introduction with her husband, singer Eddie Rabbitt, was sweet. I have not had time to practice with this tape regularly but it will remain in my collection. Janine Rabbitt leads you through the tape in a very pleasant manner. She appears to be middle aged when this tape was made and it's inspiring to see how belly dance, when done well, can make a middle aged woman appear more feminine and alluring than many younger women. At the end of the tape Janine Rabbitt gives a wonderful and elegant performance in a lovely costume. Her instruction in the beginning part of the tape is clear and easy to follow. I definitely recommend this tape for beginners interested in learning the basic moves (including introduction to dancing with a veil and finger cymbals) of belly dance.",1172534400,2,1178,4.668269230769231
7844751,3,6303334385,"Yes, there are better videos out there for learning proper technique, choreography, etc. when it comes to belly dancing. Yes, the quality of the video taping is bad, the beginning is rather sappy and she's not the best dancer out there.

That said, this video is the one that started me off in my love of belly dance when I was unable to afford more expensive videos or classes. If I had gotten any of the other videos that were available at the time, with Atea or any other super flexible, aerobically fit pencil-thin belly dancer, I would have never aspired to dance again as I am not (and never will be) the standard American belly dancer shape. I've since rented pretty much all of the other belly dance videos within reach, and none of them, in my opinion, show dancers having more fun that Janine. Most of them have fake smiles or no smiles at all while dancing - even in their 'performances' at the end of the tapes.

Janine Rabbitt's love of dancing inspired me to become the amature dancer and belly dance teacher that I am today. I figured if someone of her background (I was an awkward child too) could learn such a lovely dance, then I could also.

I would recommend to any and all people who are thinking of belly dancing to rent or buy this video for a beginning (come on - it's not that expensive!). Skip the cheesy beginning speech by her husband and don't expect to learn history or even how to move very well. But catch the enthusiasm and find a teacher in your area!!

7844752,3,6303334385,"I don't claim to be an expert on bellydancing, but even to me this woman looked amateurish and silly.  I was cracking up while trying to follow her, because everything seems so haphazard.  For example, in the ""warm-up"" you do about 6 wrist circles, 3 or 4 arm circles, a couple shoulder rolls, 3 ""stomach"" exercises (lay on your back with your knees bent and arms at your sides, and raise and lower your back), and then some stretches.  And while she's stretching, she's bouncing, which everyone says you aren't supposed to do.  Then she tries to teach a dance, but I couldn't follow any of it, because she doesn't tell you how to do the moves so much as just saying ""have fun with it, it doesn't matter whether it's authentic or not"".  The video starts with her husband gazing adoringly at a poster-sized framed picture of her, and then he gives a cheesy little talk about how proud he is of his wife for doing belly dance.  It's kind of cute, but more than a little creepy, if you ask me.

Having said all that, I did have fun with this tape.  It might not be as authentic or as professional as Neena and Veena's videos, or some of the other bellydance for fitness videos out there, but it gives you a decent workout if you get into it.  Overall, I ended up feeling like a little girl dancing around the living room to her mom's Scheherezade tape, but that's not such a bad feeling, is it?",1110844800,7,1391,4.33976833976834
