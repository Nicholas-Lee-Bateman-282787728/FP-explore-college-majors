3525686,5,B001D4CJ06,The Unit is a really good show made better without the commercial interuptions of network TV.  My wife and I love it!,1233619200,,117,4.318181818181818
3525687,5,B001D4CJ06,"Great TV series, that included military  family life, with different plots and action. A good buy",1233273600,,97,5.0625
3525688,5,B001D4CJ06,"I was very pleased with the prompt delivery of my order, although it was not a Christmas order. I received in plenty of time to be a Christmas present for me. Again thank you for your promptness and keeping me abreast as to the tracking of the package. I would most definitely use Amazon.com again and refer this site to my friends and to anyone I would meet that had a request for a hard to find item. Previously I checked everywhere I could think of to obtain this full set item. I could only find this item from a site that trusted to deliver, Amazon.com. I received a gift certificate some years ago from a physician, and I felt that if this site was still available without a lot of discontentment, it was safe to use. Thank You to Amazon.com for your credibility.",1232409600,,769,4.347222222222222
3525689,5,B001D4CJ06,"This is a great series. Each episode goes way too fast and keeps you wanting more. Season 4 (current year) is great so far.

Thanks Amazon for such a great price!",1231804800,,162,4.225806451612903
3525690,5,B001D4CJ06,I was very happy with the product. It arrived on time and the recipient of the gift was thrilled.,1231718400,,97,4.157894736842105
3525691,5,B001D4CJ06,"The Unit is the kind of drama that you've never seen before. An elite US special force that perform covert missions around the world. Yes, 'around the world'. You'd see plenty of overseas missions in the show. While the team undergoing their missions abroad, their spouses in the army base have their own lives to live with. Absence of husbands, raising their children single handed, insufficient fund for their family, doubts about their future...

Every episode there's a new mission, new struggle. The story of the army base flow continuously. Most recognizable one is the triangle between Tom, Mack and Tiffy. There're just many things going on with the wives.

I love many of the stunts that were done in season 2. It's undoubtedly my favorite episode among all. It's also the only full season as well. You'd expect to see the Unit team role play using many cover names and identities. That's also an excellent way to show the leading and supporting actors' skills. Plenty of explosion in season 2, that's what i like about this show.

Trust me this show is fun and exciting, give it a try!",1230249600,,1095,4.752631578947368

8291625,5,B001D4CJ06,"Hate that it ended the series on TV,  watch it over and over, very good series,  DVD is of very good quality",1362787200,,108,3.8636363636363638
8291626,5,B001D4CJ06,One of the best action series around. I bought the whole series from Amazon. My only regret is that they seem to have stopped making more episodes. Everyone else who has watched also asks about more episodes. Wonderful action series against a background of real life family situations.,1325116800,,285,4.958333333333333
8291627,5,B001D4CJ06,"I was fortunate enough to channel surf onto an episode of this series midway through season 2.  I immediately added it to my DVR and ultimately bought the DVDs for all 4 seasons.  Like many others, I'm disappointed to see it end.

The Unit has always told a strong story in each episode.  Some series become predictable early on, but that never happened here.  Stories continued to surprise, characters continued to develop.  I'm old enough that I don't feel attached to fictitious characters, yet those in The Unit pulled me in.  I occasionally found myself facing a challenge at work asking ""What would Snake Doc do?"".  As strong as the storyline is, the characters made this series.  Exceptional.

Like others, I am dissatisfied to see the series end.  Many story lines are unresolved, and there is obviously still gas in the tank for more episodes.  I'm a middle-aged guy who has finally earned some disposable income that doesn't jingle in my pocket, yet modern marketing deems me irrelevant.  I don't watch so-called reality shows (not my reality BTW) where nearly-naked nit-wits generally make buffoons of themselves.  I don't know the people who do watch them.  But to watch TV today, they are both loaded and easy to separate from their loot.

I'm not sure what it takes in TV-Land to make a show financially successful. In my world, the successful show is the one I'll stay up past midnight to watch, even when I have to be to work early the next morning.  The successful show is the one that I think about for a couple of days, not a couple of seconds, after watching it.  The successful show is the one I wait for anxiously each week.  The successful show is the one I will miss when some TV executive nit-wit (who would fit perfectly into his own reality TV) cancels it.  In other words, this show.  Get it.",1272067200,,1820,4.625
8291628,5,B001D4CJ06,"This show did an excellent job of showing the human side of spec ops soldiers without too much of the touchy-feely aspects.  Granted, there was drama in the series (some episodes could have down with a bit less), but the action, suspense, and surprises overshadowed it.  If you enjoy the 24 series, you will love The Unit!",1254096000,,322,4.631578947368421
8291629,5,B001D4CJ06,"Awesome Show that is the most Realistic and the most Human action series to ever grace TV and The Unit is loved by viewers world wide. Yes, the Bone-headed Program Upper Management at CBS has cancelled this show. Here is hoping that Fox picks up this fantastic U.S. Military action-drama. I guess I should not be surprised that Amazon has raised the price of this 3 season Set of The Unit again. Of Course, I will wait until the Holiday Season of 2009 as the price is Highly Likely to be on sale at that time. Yes, being patient can be a virtue and I can live with Amazon's current greediness.",1252022400,,593,4.351351351351352
8291630,1,B001D4CJ06,The sound is not matched to the video. Video skips and is blank at times. The DVD for the second season will not play on my PS3 due to a formatting issue. The DVDs that were sent to me were recorded off the TV and put on disks. I'm very unsatisfied with this. DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT!!!!,1247961600,,289,4.0
8291631,5,B001D4CJ06,My husband and I found the show late so we order the DVD's and they are worth every penny.  Love the show.  BOHICA,1245196800,,114,3.9130434782608696
8291632,5,B001D4CJ06,This was a great purchase. I love The Unit! Great value for all 3 seasons!,1237507200,,74,4.0
