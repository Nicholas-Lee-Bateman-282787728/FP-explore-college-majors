8560477,2,B00B12S5NU,"An unfortunately dry review of Copenhagen. So many things are focused on other than the rich history. They should have chosen a narrator that  is a story teller, rather than a narrator that seems like she is reading a car manual. The information is reasonably good although painful to watch. Reminds me of videos about sex ed that I was forced to watch in high school. It's like a bad tour guide, pointing out the Neon signs and which streets are pedestrian.",1432512000,,458,4.585365853658536
8560478,1,B00B12S5NU,Now I won't EVER go there. I even have a friend I can stay with for FREE there.  All I am doing now is trying to raise money to help her escape Copenhagen.  Poor thing.  Another production by The Incredibly Boring Retiree Travel Club,1383091200,,233,4.25
