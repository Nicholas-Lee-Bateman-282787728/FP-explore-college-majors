I order 4 of them as a gift for my husband, The quality was so bad we had to return them. We were so disappointed to have to do so. Hopefully one day they will be done in a higher quality for all to enjoy.",1486684800,,299,3.5454545454545454

8732713,5,B0155C2JH4,The Steve Allen Show-Volume 2 is wonderful. The episode I particularly liked was from September 1958 with George Nader as the guest star. George sings and plays the piano with Steve. What fun ! Fans of George Nader will like this the most.,1465344000,2,239,4.5813953488372094
8732714,5,B0155C2JH4,I found this volume of The Steve Allen Show a delight. Television was so much better then when much of it was live. It's great to see a young Don Knotts before he was on The Andy Griffith Show. The fact that one of these episode is in color is also amazing. And imagine beatnik super hero Jack Kerouac reading from On The Road! Wow!,1463788800,2,332,4.123076923076923
