2520304,3,B000EHT5NC,"A series of short, crudely animated cartoons from ""Eraserhead"" auteur David Lynch.  Here's how the man himself describes it: ""Dumbland is a crude, stupid, violent and absurd series.  If it is funny, it is funny because we see the absurdity of it all.""  If you need more detail, it's main ""characters"" are a Lynchian version of the typical American family.  The dad is a foul-mouthed, violent, flatulent and stupid monster.  Mom is a whimpering, cowering and constantly crying mass of trembles.  The kid is an annoying stick figure who just inanely repeats things over and over.  Actually, repetetivenes seems to be the main theme of the series.  These shorts, which clock in at just 33 minutes altogether, are minimalist (and minimally animated) b&w studies in doing the same disgusting things over and over.  When, in one episode, a ""character"" called Uncle Bob shows up, he just launches into an escalating series of gross tics, including retching, farting and vomiting.  That makes up most of the episode.  The best short here involves dad discovering the hallucinogenic effects of bug spray, with ants performing a Busby Berkely-like dance routine while insulting their would-be killer.

Considering its brief length and throwaway nature, this isn't recommended for everyone.  In fact, it's not recommended for 99% of everyone.  Even if you're a David Lynch fanatic, you're probably better off renting instead of buying (FYI: it's available on at least one very popular DVD rental web site).  Really, it's hard to say who the audience for this is; it's too crude and profane for the art-film crowd, and just too plain weird for Adult Swim crowd.  Judging by his comments, even Lynch himself doesn't like it that much.  Like many of his side projects, it's almost a pure experiment; he just wants to see what he can do with the medium.  Speaking for myself, I kind of enjoyed it, but most people think that I'm just one sick puppy anyway, and they may be right.  If you like this, it doesn't necessarily mean there's something wrong with you.  It's a damn clear sign, though.",1156291200,22,2078,4.916666666666667
2520305,5,B000EHT5NC,"David Lynch's ""Dumbland"" which I'd never heard of until I saw it at a store, is hated by almost everyone who reviewed it. But I have a question for those people. Are you truly David Lynch fans? Because you need to be to watch this. If you thought The Straight Story was his best film, Blue Velvet was alright, Mulholland Dr. didn't make sense, and Eraserhead was a plotless movie that had no meaning...This is not something for you. Actually, though, people who just have weird senses of humor but have never heard of David Lynch will actually like this. It's a series of 8 episodes (lasting about 30 minutes in all) that are crudely drawn (although, really they look like something from Cartoon Network), distasteful, and really pointless. Is this something that needed to be made? No. Am I glad I watched it? Yes. The episodes are:

1. The Neighbor

2. The Treadmill

3. The Doctor

4. A Friend Visits

5. Get the Stick

6. My Teeth Are Bleeding

7. Uncle Bob

8. Ants

All the stories include a character that is clearly one of those people who cusses all the time and has no respect for anyone. Pretty disgusting guy, but all these vignettes are...Are short stories about America told through David Lynch's warped vision. Episode 6 features our protagonist watching TV. It appears to be football. In the house, his kid is jumping on a trampoline making noises. His wife is yelling incoherent words nonstop and there is a whole array of car accidents and drive-by's going on outside. At the end of all this (it's only about 2 minutes), a fly buzzes in front of the man's face; He slaps at it and yells ""f**king fly!"" If something like that does not make perfect sense to you and kind of make you laugh...This is definitely not for you. I don't know if anyone should buy it before they watch it, but I enjoyed it and I've said everything I can to make sure you will as well.

2520306,1,B000EHT5NC,"You see Lynch cant be bothered with little trivialities like value for money or artistic integrity he's busy saving the world.

 Yes he has promised large amounts of cash to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi(yes the same guys the Beatles ran off to see). You see despite having billions in real estate and assets the Maharishi needs another billion to establish a 'peace center' where 8000 people will practice Trancendental meditation and create world peace. He has asked David Lynch, TM group member for his help in funding this project. Cant make up fiction like this folks.

 So when you see signed copies of Eraserhead for $90 on his pay website. Or $22 for 35 minutes of crude flash animation on Amazon. Dont worry its going to a good cause: world peace.

2520307,1,B000EHT5NC,"I'm a David Lynch fan, but I recognize that this guy is not automatically good in everything he tries to do.  For various reasons, Dune just didn't work out (yes even the Director's Cut...) and Wild at Heart is pretty weak in my humble opinion.  However nothing has reached as low as this.

It seems to me that for a large part Lynch just rushed through it in order to keep it zany and random.  Unfortunately it just came off as poor animation and bad jokes.  I mean, the jokes are funny in that, ""Yeah I guess that's funny..."" sort of way, but really this whole thing is kind of pointless.

Being that it's called Dumbland, and that it seems like it's rather supposed to be pointless, I'd like to point out that that still does nothing for it.  Ultimately this is... yeah I said it... boring.  Nothing to it, nothing worthy of interest, nothing to care about or have fun with.

Which is really disappointing because David Lynch of all people is inventive enough to do interesting things with animation.  Afterall, his early short films were GREAT fun, and his conceits in surrealism and absurdity makes him readily available to do some really funny things.  It's the funny that might be the problem in this situation.  It's very likely, from what can be seen in these animations, that he just isn't that good at comedy.

Oh well.  There's other stuff to watch, and if you need your simple-animation absurdity humor, may I suggest to you Don Herzfeldt.  His Rejected cartoons and a lot of his other works have the simplicity aspired to in this work, and his humor is a lot better.

2520308,1,B000EHT5NC,"I am appalled that I spent money on this.  I suppose that I should have investigated it before I bought it but it's David Lynch so it's got to be good, right?  Nope.  This is 8 rather brief, and crudely drawn ""cartoons"" that are about the most unintelligible bunch of [...] I've ever seen.  There are little blips here and there of Lynch, especially the singing, dancing ants in the last segment, but other than that, I can't beleive there's anyone that would want to watch this more than once.  After the first episode started I was diving for the volume control because this is very loud and the language is not exactly appropriate for blasting out your open windows, oops.  Not that I care personally but the neighbors might.  I watched the whole thing from start to finish praying that this wasn't all there was but it is, and it's pretty appalling that this was put out on the market for suckers like me to buy.  David Lynch is one of my favorite film makers and I've seen pretty much everything he's put out that I could get my hands on, but there seems to be no good excuse for why something like this was released.[...]",1143936000,20,1127,4.4106280193236715
2520309,3,B000EHT5NC,"This series of Flash-animation shorts originally viewable at davidlynch.com is exactly what you might expect... eight brief segments of crudely-drawn characters interacting absurdly, making some sort of commentary about the traditional small-town American values that have led to the existence of these archetype characters in the first place: the overweight fatman with an angry face who guzzles beer, watches football and wrestling, and defecates in the yard; the cowering wife who whines and nags and cries just to hang her laundry or exercise on her treadmill; the hyperactive yapping child who repeats everything ad nauseum.  None of the repeated themes here will surprise anyone who has ever seen *anything* Lynch has done, and that's one way that this series disappoints, but that's also part of its brilliance.  Lynch takes a new medium--this kind of episode-based Flash series was very trendy a few years back when it was made--and successfully applies all his usual tricks to completely master the form, somehow making it adhere so clearly to his vision that it confirms, once again, why that adjective ""Lynchian"" has found its way into our language.  As usual, he is *that* much of an auteur, with an irrepressible vision.

But the things that make this great are the things that the average consumer likely won't appreciate: Lynch's use of sound design, as usual, is incomparable, and this DVD release (not presented in surround, yet still detailed and full) likely betters the original Flash soundtrack tenfold.  The best shorts here are nearly avant-garde in their appreciation of hallucinatory sound loops and repetitive noise, from the wife-beater electrocuting himself on a broken lamp to an overwhelmingly layered snapshot of a regular machine-like afternoon for this family that includes flies, violent television, trampoline-jumping, and vocal quivering.  A neighbor is a one-armed duck-f**ker, a doctor is a sadist, a redneck friend likes to hunt and cut heads off, and Uncle Bob, well, you just have to see Uncle Bob.  And just when you thought it couldn't get any weirder, an incident involving ants and the druggy effects of bug killer brings out a Lady-in-the-Radiator-style song and dance sequence that will make all Lynch fans wink-wink and nudge-nudge.

The whole presentation is over in half an hour, and much of that time is taken up by redundant episode menus and the mindnumbing cowpunk theme music (like the King of the Hill theme with more of an edge), and as usual there are no illuminating extras.  Thus, while this is worth seeing--especially for fans--its obvious dependency on the bite-sized limitations of the Internet make it a fairly slight release in the Lynch DVD canon.",1143849600,38,2714,5.206422018348624

With this DVD release, the casual Lynch observer can now witness all 8 episodes in all their dysfunctional (animated) white trash glory.  The beer drinking, wife beating, bug spray sniffing ""Randy"" is captured yelling at helicopters, beating up salesmen and farting on trees.  But that's not even the best part.  This David (Lost Highway & Eraserhead) Lynch release is worth the price of admission  for episode 4 (A Friend Visits) alone.  Randy and his buddy (good ol' boy ""Friend"") sit around the back yard drinking beer and talk about killing animals while spitting tobacco.  Classic!

2520344,4,B000EHT5NC,"To me Dumbland challenges the viewer to see how banal and mindless a lot of commercial TV has become by it's deliberate crudeness. As networks vie to reduce shows to their lowest common denominators (sexual innuendo, violence, cheap laughs often at other's expense etc) to gain maximum audiences, Lynch's animation shows us what the next evolutionary step could be unless there is a smartening up.

The characters are almost identical to those found in an average sit-com: the goof of a father, wife who creates inadvertent hijinks, hyperactive kid, crazy mother-in-law, wacky neighbor and minor characters  - it's all in Dumbland, except showing the reverse side of the saccharine sweet coin. The plot too I find satirical, with low-intelligence happenings supposedly reflecting normal behavior - much like your average TV show except taken to the Nth degree.

I found this series a breath of fresh air and have watched it numerous times - kudos to Lynch for creating this. I'd like to see more media created in this same vein that challenges the status quo. It probably won't appeal to that many people and I recommend previewing before purchase, but hope some people get it.",1193184000,,1177,5.0256410256410255
2520345,3,B000EHT5NC,"DUMBLAND (2002)
Directed by David Lynch
approx. 30 minutes

This is a DVD anthology of an internet cartoon that originally appeared on David Lynch's website.  Although the DVD came out in 2005, the cartoons are a few years older.

There are eight ""episodes"" of this cartoon that follow the life of a disgusting brute and his dysfunctional lifestyle.  On some level he is similar to Alfred Jarry's ""UBU"" character, but that is probably reading too far into the content here.  Everyone who has ever reviewed this DVD has pointed out that the animation style is as ""crude"" as the characters.

The actual story shows the main character lashing out violently at everyone around him, including his screaming wife, a doctor and his physically ill brother-in-law.  In one episode, he mutilates a man who has somehow gotten a stick wedged in his mouth.  There are some Lynch-like moments, in particular a sequence involving an ant infestation.  Our obese anti-hero tries to spray the ants with bug spray, but accidentally gets a whiff of the toxic fumes himself.  After this he hallucinates and sees the ants singing songs and calling him names.  The ""best"" episode is probably ""my teeth are bleeding"" which mostly consists of of looped animation and sound effects.  The usually loud and obnoxious main character just sits in his room as everything in the world seems to go crazy.  I guess you could argue that he is a product of his environment?

I am a big fan of Lynch for the reason that he has his own unique style when it comes to making movies.  The problem with this DVD is that there is very little to distinguish it from the hundreds of internet cartoons that already exist.  When I watch something, I don't need to be blown away every time.  I also understand that ""the point"" of this cartoon is to be cheap and vulgar to an absurd degree.  But having said that, if we were to hear a few years down the line that this series was actually made by a fifteen year old boy trying to outdo ""South Park"", I don't think anybody would be surprised.

Basically, there are a few funny moments on this DVD, but it is impossible to imagine this being released (or rented) if it was by anyone other than a famous movie director.",1192147200,2,2217,4.60969387755102
2520346,4,B000EHT5NC,"Dumbland consists of several simply drawn black and white cartoons that David Lynch created using Flash animation.

2520347,4,B000EHT5NC,"Dumbland is a hyper-violent animated series with a non-stop, graphic brutality of a dysfunctional family that can be viewed either as a sick joke or as a comment of violence on screen and in society.

2520348,2,B000EHT5NC,"Writer-director David Lynch has earned a well-deserved reputation for portraying a very dark and even surreal world with films like Blue Velvet (1986) and Mulholland Drive (2001). He moved on to television with the series Twin Peaks. His latest foray finds him experimenting with animated ""film"" on the internet. The first few seconds of Dumbland advises viewers that ""Dumbland is a crude, stupid, violent and absurd series. If it is funny it is funny because we see the absurdity of it all. For mature audiences only."" If anything, that is an understated warning about the vulgarity and violence that follows in the eight three to four minute ""episodes."" The darkness is not new for viewers familiar with Lynch, nor is the creativity or quality that great; a talented high-schooler could have made these shorts. Dumbland is important because it shows the experimental direction of a major film maker. Lynch sat down at his iMac by himself, and with a software program called Flash used his mouse to draw the simple black line drawings on a white background. He then added animation, voices and music.

2520349,4,B000EHT5NC,"There's one or two things you need to know to appreciate David Lynch's ""Dumbland,"" laden as it is with mindless expletives, domestic violence, and gratuitous fart scenes. First, Lynch has explored this territory in an admittedly less concentrated form through his films. Largely, this is all about an artist exorcising some demons, and those are demons riding the current of lowbrow, uncultured, anti-rationalism that dominates a large part of the world today. (Look, I don't want to use the term ""white trash"" here--so don't think you can make me do it.) Secondly, this is really the second stab that Lynch has taken at getting to the heart of this issue. The first experiment like this was a comic strip called ""The Angriest Dog in the World,"" and you can get a glimpse of those comics at the City of Absurdity website.",1161388800,3,821,4.829787234042553
2520350,5,B000EHT5NC,"I love David Lynch, and so far he has yet to really disappoint me. And Dumbland was no exception. I can easily see why most stuck up wanna be film critics would immediately slam this film, some people just can't take this type of humor seriously. But as for me, I adore it. I found myself bellowing in insane laughter, not just at the genius dialogue and inept storyline. But also at how relevant this film is to many morons you see in society. Is it so hard to just enjoy ridiculous and offensive humor from the man who practically invented surreal filmmaking and storytelling?
Lighten up; Lynch wasn't attempting to break any new ground with this cartoon, and judging by many reviews, it seems people had that consensus.
I couldn't get enough of this little treasure and would reccomend it to anyone with a vast and open-minded sense of humor.

2520351,1,B000EHT5NC,"I used to think everything David Lynch produced was gold (including Dune) but now realize Lynch, aside from bits of ""Eraserhead"", ""Blue Velvet"", ""Twin Peaks"" and ""The Straight Story"", is primarily a pretty weak avant-garde filmmaker and an even worse Hollywood director.

His ability at sound design is superb and when his intuition is working, it's admittedly fascinating, but you can only go so far on intuition.  ""Dumbland"" is a good example of this talent gone awry, or astray. It's reminiscent of his worst (and generally his shortest): - ""The Alphabet"", ""The Grandmother"", ""The Amputee"", ""The Cowboy and the Frenchman"", ""Industrial Symphony No. 1"", ""On the Air"", and ""Rabbits"" . . . ""Dumbland"" is a bad joke that plays and stays like a bad joke.

It's hard to reconcile this with the same imagination that gave birth to ""Twin Peaks"" (at least the first season), but here it is . . . I left Lynch behind with my adolescence for a reason, much as I have been left behind by ""Lost Highway"" and ""Mulholland Drive"".

From what I have read / seen of ""Inland Empire"" it appears that the dreck continues to accumulate.  One can only hope that Lynch will deliver himself from the wreckage of his career by producing something as audacious and electrifying as ""Eraserhead"", ""Blue Velvet"" or ""Twin Peaks"" once again, or at least something as human and transcendent as ""The Straight Story"".

(except for films like Elephant Man and The Straight Story which I am not supposed to be disturbed by).  :)

Dumbland is a series of short cartoons that originally premiered on davidlynch.com.

As far as I can tell, this is Lynch's first foray into animation. It sounds like he's doing all the voices himself. The animation is crude (but I wasn't expecting Disney quality from an animated web series). They are absurdist and for the most part funny (at least to me).

Watching these shorts in one sitting, I can see that the film maker is experiencing a learning curve (never having done animation before). Around the halfway mark he really starts to find his groove and the cartoons get funnier (It's too bad he couldn't keep going with the series because the final cartoons are the funniest).

I reccomend this for the hard core Lynch fans (like myself) who want to see everything and not to the newcomer.

I bought this used from one of the Amazon marketplace re sellers as I thought the new pric was just to high for a short 30 minure dvd of flash animation cartoons.

These cartoons are rated R (mostly) for language (I state this for the unintiated who might see that this is animation and think it might be fun for their kids).

Now, to clarify, I live in a trashy community in MN, where I see the characters presented in Dumbland (albiet as caricatures) pretty often, and one thing that will never cease to impress and mystify me is Lynch's ability to see into personalities, and essentially the persons themselves, and animate (literally and metaphorically) them into such beings that comprise his work.

For instance, the scene with the friend of the main character (excuse my forgetting names) and himself sitting in the yard just talking scared the hell out of me; the scene may seem benign and crude to others with the surface comedy, but I really felt a stirring uneasiness about that character, like Frank Booth from Blue Velvet, only with this character you don't know who he is, what he wants, except that he enjoys hunting and 'sharing a kill with a friend'; that invitation to a violent act just haunts me still, and I'd probably have purchased the DVD just for that scene, no joke, and that goes very well with most of Lynch's material, either it be a painting, photo, film scene, piece of music, or a few words on his own artistic processes, I love it; mind you I don't just love EVERYTHING he makes, but I respect everything that he has done, and I don't think there's been such a great satirist since Vonnegut.",1266192000,,1544,4.586956521739131
