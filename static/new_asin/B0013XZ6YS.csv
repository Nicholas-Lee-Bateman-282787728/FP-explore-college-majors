8253493,1,B0013XZ6YS,"The quality of this DVD was fair.

It was particularly spoilt by Alpha Video's logo over the titles and taking up about 20% of the screen.

The story is fine and interesting however.

Hopefully better copies will become available on DVD-R on demand from the studios themselves.

In the meantime, won't buy Alpha Video releases again.",1320451200,4,333,4.892857142857143
8253494,3,B0013XZ6YS,"From 1939 to 1941, the acting duo of Richard Arlen and Andy Devine cranked out 14 adventure films for Universal Pictures. This 1940 flick takes them to the world of auto racing and has scenes that showcase the famous stunt-driver Lucky Teeter.

Arlen portrays a fictional daredevil racer/test driver, Lucky Taylor, who is initially blamed for a fiery on-track accident that kills another driver; who just happens to be the brother of his love interest, Pat O'Shea (Peggy Moran). In the ill-fated hot-rod was an experimental oil-fueled engine invented by Pat's father, Pop (Herbert Cothrell), which now appears doomed to never be used again.

Taylor - and his ace mechanic (Devine) - then go about trying to clear his name with the racing officials and win back Pat, while literally picking up the pieces of Pop's revolutionary motor and prove that the technology can work in the grueling events. And nothing beats a rivalry on the track and Taylor has that with the headline grabbing Bruce Cowley (Jack Arnold).

Produced by Ben Pivar, it is a neat nostalgic piece that is worth the price of admission for racing enthusiasts who are searching for footage of the legendary Lucky Teeter.",1232064000,3,1185,4.944723618090452
