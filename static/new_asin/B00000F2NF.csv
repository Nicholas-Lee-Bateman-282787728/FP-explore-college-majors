1200573,5,B00000F2NF,"Episode 1 - ""From Vaudeville to Movies"" (1895-1924): This 3-part  video collection opens with a fantastic collage of various pratfall scenes  from Buster's early silent career. Then it starts at his birth, explaining  the vaudeville act he had with mom and dad. Quitting that at 21, he goes  under the employ of Roscoe ""Fatty"" Arbuckle, who becomes Buster's  mentor and teacher in front of and behind the camera. Various scenes from  their 2-reel shorts are shown (1917-20). When Arbuckle goes on to loftier  projects, Buster is given his own studio, and scenes from the 2-reel shorts  he made there are shown (1920-23). Episode 1 continues with scenes of his  wedding to Natalie Talmadge and Arbuckle's (he was framed) trial for  murder. Towards the end we are shown life-threatening stunts that Buster  made in the films ""Our Hospitality"" (1923) and ""Sherlock  Jr."" (1924): hanging upside down by a rope tied around his waist over  a waterfall...accidentally being whisked away through speeding river rapids  that almost drowned him...and breaking his neck over plunging water from a  water tower spout.
Episode 2 - ""Star Without a Studio""  (1924-1933): By 1924, he had graduated to feature-length films (7 reels).  Shown are the 3 mansions he had purchased with his growing fortune. By this  time, he was earning $3,000 a week (by comparison, I think a family of 4  could live on $60 a week in L.A. at that time). A great deal of footage is  shown of his classic films ""The Navigator"", ""The  General"", ""Steamboat Bill Jr."", etc. The second half of  Episode 2 is devoted to his being signed over to MGM studios, where they  minimized his creativity and independence. Scenes are shown of the films he  made there (1928-33), which made a lot of money, but were substandard in  quality from Buster's point of view, and which his friends explain, on  camera, might have caused the drinking problem that developed at this time.  The inability to handle alcohol caused his excessive absenteeism from  workdays, leading to his discharge from MGM in 1933.
Episode 3 - ""A  Genius Recognized"" (1934-1966): Because of the drinking problem,  Buster was basically blackballed from working at other major studios, but  was signed by a low budget company called Educational Pictures to do 2-reel  shorts. These were lesser in quality from the shorts he made in the early  20's, due to their tight shooting schedules and financial budgets being so  much lower. Scenes are shown of these, including one he made where his mom,  brother and sister were included in the cast. After Educational went  bankrupt in 1937, Buster was hired back at MGM, but only as a gag writer -  at 10% of his previous MGM salary. Episode 3 then (curiously) skips about  10 years of his life (even though significant work was done during those  years) and continues with his TV work in the 50's. The last part of Episode  3 explains his re-discovery in the 60's as a film genius and ends with  scenes that show his health had deteriorated from the effects of a lifetime  of chain smoking.
Although this 3-volume set is the best analysis I've  seen on Buster's life, at least 5 volumes would be needed to do his work  justice. After I viewed this collection, I thought of a zillion other  scenes from his films that deserved to be included. But I've watched it  numerous times anyway and never seem to tire of it.",965001600,6,3374,4.80977312390925
1200574,5,B00000F2NF,"I have not yet had the chance to view the first volume of this set, but I will say that if episodes 2 and 3 are any indication, the series as a whole is flawless. It is most unfortunate that while everyone has heard of  Charlie Chaplin, only a comparative few have had the joy of viewing (In my  opinion)the work of a superior comedian. That is not to say that both were  not geniuses in filmmaking, but on closer inspection of their careers, it  becomes apparent that while Chaplin was often concerned with making films  that would make him the one and only center of attention, Keaton simply  wanted to make people laugh. It is truly tragic that the latter was  stripped of much of his creative freedom so early in his career. But as the  series shows, Keaton went beyond sulking, and continued to work steadily,  whether it be in some horrendously bad shorts in the thirties, or  television several years later. However, no matter how bad the  circumstances around him, Keaton's unparalleled comedic abilities shine  through. The main highlight is the third episode, which offers many  snippets of the work that formed Keaton's comeback in the fifties and  sixties. The interviews are quite fascinating, with numerous insights into  Keaton's quiet genius. There is one where a man working on a Red Skelton  film recalls how Keaton would come up with a gag that would solve a script  problem as soon as he came on the set. Of particular interest is Keaton's  last wife Eleanor. In listening to her, you are consoled that despite the  disgraceful treatment he received from Hollywood, Buster spent the last  three decades of his life with a woman who truly cared for and loved him.  And in listening to the man himself less than two years before his death,  it is obvious that no course of time or fate has stemmed Keaton's ferocious  love and dedication to the cinema art form. Seeing film clips from  ""Film"" (the experimental short written by playwright Samuel  Beckett) and ""The Railrodder"", I was left with an even greater  desire to seek these late Keaton works out in their entirety. From the  beautifully done opening title sequence to the eloquent ending (which  doesn't make the mistake of hovering around Keaton's death or going for  fake sentiment), this is truly a commemoration that the Great Stone Face  would have admired.",948240000,24,2338,4.758104738154613
1200575,5,B00000F2NF,"This documentary artfully interweaves Keaton's life and film career, providing the personal and professional contexts that lead to his celebrated classics. The three-part series delves into specific details on  his creative process with invaluable interviews by Keaton, his wife,  associates and historians to bring deeper appreciation of his genius.  Rare  outtakes and photos are used to great effect.  Best of all, the filmmakers  cover Keaton's later fall from prominence and rightful return as a  critically lauded pioneer, documenting Buster as a human being as well as  silent star.

7906387,4,B00000F2NF,"First off, the content is unsurpassed - it is the best video documentary of the life and work of Buster Keaton ever made, and it is both entertaining and informative.  A work of passion about one of cinema's and comedy's great geniuses, with a GREAT orchestral score by the fully committed composer Carl Davis and his orchestra.  Full of heart and well-deserved admiration along with superb clips and history, it gets no better than this - Five stars all the way.

The only hitch is that the transfer was apparently made from video laserdiscs or something akin to it - the resolution is somewhat low and there are occasionally digital artifacts that crop up.  Still thoroughly watchable.  Note - this is a Region 2 DVD, and will not play on North American equipment unless you hack it - which for many DVD and Blu-Ray player brands is an easy sequence of pressing a short sequence of remote control buttons.  I set up my Phillips Blu-Ray player in about 1 minute to play all regions of DVDs.",1382659200,4,991,4.6022727272727275
7906388,5,B00000F2NF,"One of the best documentaries ever made about possibly the greatest American comedic actor is only available in European PAL format?  If you know how to maneuver around that, you can make your own formatted copies otherwise you may not be able to see this on your conventional equipment.  It is worth the effort but why this is not made for the NTSC American market is unfathomable.

Once you figure out how to watch this, it is heaven.  Keaton knew he was neglected, knew he was forgotten, knew he was due more, but he kept going anyway.  Ended up sleeping in a camper parked in the driveway of a friend, the most original American comedic genius of the silent era (Chaplin was from England like Stan Laurel) remains invisible to everyone today except for his riffs, licks, gags, timing, takes, and character positioning,  Almost everything we do in comedy whether on stage or in a Pixar film comes from Buster.  Too bad no one said, ""Thank you,"" before he died alone and forgotten.  Figure out how, and watch this.",1373155200,3,1016,4.636871508379889
7906389,5,B00000F2NF,"One of the finest documentaries I've ever seen.  From beginning to end, you see how creativity is feared by the untalented.  You have to ask yourself, 'had Keaton been left alone to create, what else could he have done?  How would he have revolutionized the talkies?' Presently, I am happy to report that many young filmmakers are discovering Buster and stand in awe.  I know that this documentary is currently available in DVD using the PAL system but I hope that very, very soon it will available in the US format. It is my understanding that the current VHS is 'writer-protected' and can't be dubbed.  Oh well, we can always dream.  Even in VHS, it would be worth the price of finding a 'dinosaur contraption' to play it on. Another fine film and super documentary about Buster is called 'The Railrodder.""",1293062400,2,808,4.695035460992908
7906390,5,B00000F2NF,"NB: Although long out of print on video in the US, those with multi-region DVD players should be aware that Network DVD have released this title on PAL DVD in the UK.

From the same stable as the superb Unknown Chaplin and the legendary Hollywood series, this three-part 1987 TV series is easily the best documentary on the great stone-faced comedian, and comes with the added advantage of a wealth of radio and television interview material with the man himself to draw on. Yet it suffers somewhat in comparison despite highlights such as its comprehensive account of the making of The General, which includes interviews with extras and sightseers at the film's spectacular battle scene, as well as home movie footage of Keaton at work. Partially this is due to its tendency toward the 'sad clown' approach that is, if not hidden, at least bolstered by its attention to detail, but perhaps more importantly it at times gives the feeling of preaching to the converted. Where their Hollywood TV series was an eye-opener that managed to completely dispel the patronising contempt or superiority many felt for silent cinema by restoring it to its original element, here Kevin Brownlow and David Gill take Keaton's genius too much for granted.

Still, while many of the extracts aren't likely to make any new converts, they do illustrate the extraordinary technical precision and danger involved in shooting them. Consequently, the extraordinarily accomplished scene where Buster is trapped within the film in Sherlock Junior is dealt with in depth, but the simpler, and much funnier, billiard sequence that demonstrates a different kind of cinematic imagination is completely absent. As a result, while Keaton's fans will find much to embrace, as an introduction to his work it to the uninitiated it tends to marginalise him as more of an inspired craftsman than a great comic.

If many of the warmest and funniest moments of his silent work are missing, so too is the star's Beach Blanket Bingo era when he turned up in bit parts in teen movies, or his TV work, such as his Twilight Zone episode that boasted a couple of outstanding pieces of physical comedy). Even A Funny Thing Happened to Me On the Way to the Forum seems tagged on as an afterthought, leaving a slight impression of, not so much rewriting history, but at the very least ignoring the bits which don't gel with his critical rediscovery at that time.

Highly recommended nonetheless, it does make you hungry to see more of the man's work. Despite the age of the material, picture quality is excellent throughout, with the extracts being shown at the correct speed, while full credits for all three episodes are retained. Carl Davis' sympathetic scoring works well, with the extracts from his score for The General a particular highlight.",1292716800,3,2802,4.942675159235669
7906391,5,B00000F2NF,I can only second what the others have said-the whole thing is wonderful.  Too bad it looks like we'll have no DVD release of this-I wouldn't part with my LD's of this for anything.,1078876800,5,181,4.323529411764706
7906392,5,B00000F2NF,"About 7 years ago, I saw an one-hour biography TV program on Buster Keaton in my home country, Japan.  The approach to the entire life story on Buster that the program organized could be best summarized in some descriptions:  ""The Great Stone Face formed by his father's abusive training in his childhood"", ""Acrobatic performance that is one-inch-close to death"" or ""Happy ending of his life after lifelong loneliness"" and so on and on.  Until I had a chance to see this ""Buster Keaton - A Hard Act to Follow"" I used to have no doubt what a sad clown Buster was -- even sadder than Charlie Chaplin.
This 3-hour documentary, however, completely smashed down my biased understanding on Buster and was truely eye-opening in this sense.  One of what few know here in Japan is that Buster made several appearances on TV and even hosted his own program -- while Charlie never allowed himself to go into TV business, with his good intentions, of course.  In Japan, such words as ""classic comedy"", ""silent movie"" or ""slapsticks"" are practically (and almost automatically) synonymous with Charlie, and as a result, only Charlie gets the majority of attention and the ""runner-up"" could be Buster, only if you know him, that is.  Also, what I never understand is that quite a few Japanese ""intelligentsias"" publicly rush into a rash comparison ""Buster is dry and cool, while Chalie is so easy to resort to pathos"".  Why don't they just give a closer look at both respectively (and respectfully!) and accept that they are BOTH great?!  Isn't that enough?  ""Buster Keaton - A Hard Act to Follow"" -- this is the perfect solution to people with such ideas!",974332800,28,1641,4.790780141843972
