8161081,5,B000LC57LY,"eye for an eye is an excellent series which has stood the test of time well, so much so that it freely airs unique users on the largest tv network on the planet on no less than five channels, (four of them actually dedicated to the series) and on sky channel 292/freesat 410 in the united kingdom. i love the series so much, i bought Judge Akim's website lol.",1404172800,,359,4.217391304347826
