7464316,2,B01690GUD0,"Holy crap, that was one bad freaking movie. Bad acting, bad special effects, crappy camera work, horrible and unlikable characters. I mean, the list just goes on and on. It is really one of the worst horror movies I have seen in years. I fell asleep multiple times while watching it, and even when I was awake, I just didn't care enough about anyone involved to invest much in their outcomes. They were a$$holes in high school, and deserved everything they had coming to them. What else needs to be said about this movie? The only saving grace is the gratuitous booty shown in the first 10 minutes. That is one fine posterior. Two stars for that alone. The rest? Don't even consider it.",1451520000,,686,4.540322580645161

7464322,2,B01690GUD0,"Although a B-movie, the look and feel was above average.  The actors were fine, but the story was just flat.  I realized at the end that I was zoning out and misunderstood a key dialogue exchange, but I didn't even care at that point to know what I missed.",1449964800,,256,4.204081632653061
7464323,1,B01690GUD0,This has got to be one of the worst horror movies of 2015. The story is way too quick. This movie doesn't allow you to feel for the characters. This movie doesn't have much feeling to it at all.,1449964800,,194,4.0
7464324,3,B01690GUD0,"As a slasher movie, I gave it 3 stars. As an overall movie, I would only give it 2 stars. First of all, this revenge film based upon a highschool prank (yawn) with its masked killer looking like a Marilyn Monroe reject, looks like a cross between Halloween and Friday the 13th among other things without the originality. It does have impact. But it's all contrived. And in the end the audience is cheated because we are not absolutely certain as to who the actual killer really was. It's OK to slash and kill (""keep telling yourself it's only a movie"") but it's not nice to cheat your viewers. Key problems with this film are the following: How does the killer know about THE prank in order to perpetuate his revenge? There were so many pranks which one really applies to our killer?  How does the killer always know where somebody is in order to accomplish his revenge? How come no one ever sees a strange parked car in the neighborhood since the killer can't walk to every locale? How does the killer manage to get into everyone's home despite locked doors, etc.? Or public medical centers? There is even a question regarding why one of the characters was even killed at all. Is there only one killer? If so, why did the killer wait 5 years to exact his revenge?Why am I asking these questions? After all, ""it's only a movie""! In any case, for those who like this kind of film, fine. For anyone else, stick
to Laurel & Hardy.",1460851200,4,1427,4.4465648854961835

7464326,2,B01690GUD0,"It's pretty bad. The plot sounds like it was stolen from I know what you did last summer. The effects are over the top after the 3rd kill. And throughout all this crap, you never actually find out WHO the real killer is. It might be hinted at in the end, but you never know and no one seems to no that one of the victims are dead. It wasn't the best, but sadly it wasn't the WORST I've seen either. I would never recommend this move. Anyone who is thinking about watching this garbage is better off NOT EVEN BOTHERING.",1459036800,,518,4.138613861386139

7464328,1,B01690GUD0,"Absolutely awful. The acting is bad, the directing is worse? The mask is a ripoff of the one in the movie Valentine. The killings are weak. And the identity of the killer is terrible. The worst kind of slasher you can find around: Souless.",1453507200,,239,4.454545454545454
7464329,5,B01690GUD0,"I did not know what to expect but was hoping for an edge of my seat thriller and I got it with this movie.  A scary movie That takes you through different possibilities of who did it.  I did not know the actors, but they gave solid performances.  The killing scenes were terrifying which is what you want from the horror movie category.  The movie also has a relevant feel because of the theme of bullying.....a hot topic in today's world.",1453420800,,439,4.382716049382716
7464330,3,B01690GUD0,"Kill Game, has an (I Know What You Did Last Summer) vibe to it but it's much more raw with a much grittier feel to it. I've read quite a few bad reviews for this film but I have to disagree! I enjoyed it.

I'm not saying t was great but it delivered what this type of film with this kind of budget is supposed to deliver. There was a diverse group of characters, none of them glossy  but instead they also had a dark feel to them which worked well.

There were some creative kills, some shown, some off camera .The effects were hit or miss but there was enough hit to satisfy me. There are so many potential choices as to who the killer is that I had no idea who it could have been.

I was delighted to see (Micheal Galante) as Liam because not only is he a good actor but he's very easy on the eye. The mask the killer wore was quite creepy and effective because it was molded like the distorted face of a woman.

Bottom line,Kill Game is an entertaining ,well done, gritty Slasher with a few surprises. 3 & 1\2 Stars",1452816000,3,1018,4.07
7464331,1,B01690GUD0,Haven't seen it just wondering why the killer on the cover looks like a female Michael Myers,1452297600,,92,4.470588235294118

7464333,3,B01690GUD0,"This is a slasher who-dun-it. Jimmy (Nathan Ross Murphy) is the first to die. A small group of close friends attend his funeral, friends who all share a secret of a student who died from a prank. They soon realize that they too may become targets but they don't know who it targeting them as they have prank'd so many people, they have no idea who is getting revenge against them. To top it all off, the deceased had a twin brother who lived out of town and is now visiting attempting to discover what happened to his brother.

The film was all over the place with killing and clues. The killer wore a mask, but no one alive knew that. When a mask is found, how was it associated with the killer? I liked the fact we had numerous suspects, but they should have developed the characters better.

There is a scene where they close the trunk and we see an upside down Illinois license plate: A16 W732 which would read selm or 5ELM  9TV. I don't know if that was meant to be a clue, a message, or they just did it because they didn't have any way to pixilate it due to the budget. But the camera did land on it for a few seconds, I assume the director wanted us to see it. Your thoughts?

8735912,3,B01690GUD0,"A group of unlikable teenage pranksters accidentally kill someone. Soon thereafter, they become targets of a mysterious murderer (who's most certainly out for revenge). This is a watchable yet forgettable horror movie. There's really nothing special here. The murderer looks more ridiculous than scary, and the ""mystery"" of his or her identity is fairly uninteresting. Since the prankster teens basically pissed off EVERYONE they know, everyone is a potential suspect. So most of the movie involves the pranksters apologizing to random characters in hopes of making amends (and discovering the killer's identity). A few of the kills are inventive yet completely far-fetched... even by fantastical movie standards. All in all, Kill Game is average at best, a serviceable time waster if you've run out of other GOOD movies to watch.",1531699200,,830,5.392307692307693

8735916,2,B01690GUD0,"Let/s call this movie....I know What You Did Last Summer.......lite..but this is nowhere near as interesting or fun. There was one good fight scene in this and it took place in a parking lot. There was this one very pointless and seemed to be randomly tossed in love scene? WhY? I don't know. The acting is just passable, nothing more and the fending is silly The absolute worst actress is Sari Sanchez....plain old awful. I won't really dignify this with any more talk, it was just an excuse to kill.",1497052800,,501,4.5777777777777775
8735917,3,B01690GUD0,"It's okay not great but definitely NOT one I'll be seeing again. The plot was an oldie but not worn out one the way they did it! There were a few old tricks but also a few new ones. At times the movie was so dark it was hard to tell what was going on! I was in a dark room with my laptop light turned up all the way one minute then the next it hurt my eyes it was bright!
The characters fall flat on this one. NONE OF THEM are like able, after the first 10 minutes I just wished they would ALL die and save my the next hour and 10 or 20 minutes! They were constantly pointing fingers, accusing everybody else and the last 20 minutes or so I was rolling my eyes sighing and face palming LOTS! The surprise twist ending after the twist wasn't really surprising! BUT I was like okay after the beach scene it was over.....NOT! Then after the last person died it was over.... NOT! THEN the bus scene (I'm being super vague so not to give away the ending IF you get that far!!) and it wasn't really a surprise ending AT ALL! I figured it out after the first 30 minutes SIGH.",1475280000,,1068,3.9953271028037385
