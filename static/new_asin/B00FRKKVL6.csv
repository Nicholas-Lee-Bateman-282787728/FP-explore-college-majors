6029454,5,B00FRKKVL6,"One of the best TV series ever and it's a damn shame it couldn't continue, but season 4 is a fitting ending if it has to go.  Buy it and enjoy.",1392163200,,143,3.6129032258064515
6029455,5,B00FRKKVL6,This is my favorite show and I own all the seasons.  I believe this is this is the final season.  I wish it would never end.  The acting is magnificent.  I enjoy watching or reading anything about New Orleans so this is a real treat.,1392076800,,233,4.111111111111111
6029456,5,B00FRKKVL6,"I have enjoyed Treme. I live close to NOLA and visit often, its fun to recognize the different areas of town in the show.",1391990400,,121,4.083333333333333
6029457,5,B00FRKKVL6,"Treme, in all its seasons, is one of the finest dramas on television. The characters are complex, the filming rich with nuance, the music--jazz, blues--beyond compare. Other films have tried to pare music with drama, but most fail. The music seems an odd add-on; the characters a mere appendage. But Treme understands that without music there is no New Orleans. Those of us who lament the paucity of good drama on television should fear no more; those of us who lament the vacuity in many of the present movies in our cinemas still have much to regret. Treme is, quite simply, brilliant, with actors and musicians of unimpeachable talent and integrity.",1391731200,2,652,4.882882882882883
6029458,5,B00FRKKVL6,"Since my uncle was Louis Prima, and my heart is in New Orleans I liked it very much.  I would like to have all of the seasons.  Is that in the works????",1391040000,,152,3.71875
6029459,4,B00FRKKVL6,"There is hardly a beginning or end to the story of New Orleans; it is not the city that care forgot, although there have been times when it forgot to care or others forgot to care about it. Except for prices of food and lodging,one could argue it is the city that time forgot. Overt racism has been subverted to the covert, although native New Orleanians are among the most friendly and pleasant people one can ever meet. Going to church when visiting New Orleans will inspire and move you no matter your personal faith and denomination. God bless Treme - it's a chapter of a story that needed to be told but as you'll know if you live or visit there, it's not over.",1390953600,2,666,4.336
6029460,5,B00FRKKVL6,"Endings always come at last, endings always come too fast...
The people who made this brilliant TV series had the wisdom to conclude it after three and a half seasons. It doesn't pay to overstretch a tale.
The story, that Trem tells us, is about post-Katrina New Orleans, up to the time of Obama's inauguration. It is about politics, police corruption, real estate speculation, high and low crime, the legal system, the culture... Culture mainly about music, mardi gras, and the music and restaurant businesses.
We follow a dozen people through their lives, as in any other soap. We follow a traditional trombonist, a lawyer with a social agenda, a bar owner with awful bad luck, but fighting spirit, a chef with similar characteristics, a DJ, an honest cop, a violinist, a modern jazz trumpeter, a carnival fanatic, an ambiguous, deceptively charming speculator shark.... And whom have I forgotten?
In a way, this plot is all just a smoke screen, a pretext to give us plenty of music. We are rarely left without music for more than a few minutes. We get studio sessions, practice sessions at home, funerals, orchestra class at school, the DJ at work, mardi gras processions, live gigs in bars and concert halls... The music includes all shades of jazz, blues, rock, country... Just gorgeous.
TV was never better.",1389398400,42,1313,4.8923766816143495
6029461,5,B00FRKKVL6,"So having watched the concluding episodes of this brilliant show, I was please overall. I would have liked to have seen them stretch it out a bit to include the mood of the city to the point when the BP oil spill was hitting this area, but that is a minor complaint. I will be waiting awhile to buy the DVD, as it just isn't right to price this at $26.00 +/- for just 5 episodes... I am just now getting around to buying season 3 which only recently dropped to this price point for the full season... I would hope these 5 episodes will drop to 12-15 bucks soon?? Just wanted to mention that in case anyone doesn't realize how abbreviated the last season is...",1388707200,30,659,4.238095238095238
6029462,5,B00FRKKVL6,"DJ Davis, at his radio gig says"" You can hear a song that you've heard a million times, but because of a change in the song, or in your own life, you can hear something wildly different in it than ever before. "" ' You Know What It Means To Miss New Orleans'

Lights down, the last season of 'Treme', shown in five episodes. David Simon, the co-creator and writer, played it beautifully. The last season was one of the best, however, you had to have the first three, to fully understand what happened during and after Katrina. We grew to love the city, the culture, the music, we learned a lot about New Orleans music and it's part in Treme. The musicians who inhabit,who come and go. The characters in 'Treme', who had their ups and downs and downs again in every year. The scumbags, the hoodlums, the police, the Mayor, Ray Nagy. We followed the news and the crimes, the bodies, the deaths, the careless nature in which people were treated, particularly the African Americans.

This last season gives us a summary of the lives of all the characters. We learn more about their true natures, where they may be headed. I particularly loved the last episode. It ended as it started, but the lives of those involved had all been changed, drastically.

'Treme'' ended with Hope in it's veins. We know that New Orleans has not changed that much, the vultures, the money grubbers are still around, but we can sense some changes wrought by the hard work of the people who love New Orleans. The musicians, who will never allow the songs and music of their city die. We Know What It Means To Miss New Orleans.......

Highly Recommended. prisrob 12-31-13",1388448000,55,1643,4.559322033898305

6029464,5,B00FRKKVL6,"Everything David Simon has done with HBO as been spectacular: The Wire, The Corner, Generation Kill. And, Treme is no exception. Great cast, great writing, great production.

6029471,5,B00FRKKVL6,"Treme was a great show which gives us a glimpse into post-Katrina New Orleans. Many characters provide us stories focusing on the differences and conflicts between the races, classes, and gender. The show also focuses on the culture in New Orleans; on all of the things that make the city a great one, including it's traditions, it's food, and especially it's music. The music alone is worth watching the show. I only wish the show lasted for more than 4 seasons.",1483574400,,463,4.728395061728395

6029475,5,B00FRKKVL6,"While the pacing may be a bit slow for some viewers, Treme has the same realistic, unvarnished, unflinching POV that The Wire had. Character development is not only more in-depth than the typical television series, but more true. And yes, some of the characters are annoying, if not downright unlikeable. If you loved The Wire, and you have any interest at all in New Orleans, you will love Treme.",1482969600,,397,4.768115942028985

It's hard to compete with this beautiful immersion in the lives of people affected by Katrina, the incomparable music (and so many musical greats to see and hear!), convincing characters, both as created and realized by the fine cast and direction. We've watched all four seasons except for the last couple of episodes which we are stretching out because we don't want it to end! I'm sure we'll watch it all again.

6029627,5,B00FRKKVL6,"I didn't have HBO when Treme originally aired.  I binge-watched the entire series over the past week, and I just finished it.

Tears are streaming.

I know what it means to miss New Orleans.  I've spent the entirety of my adult life trying to move there permanently.  It's currently impossible, due to the price of the real estate/rentals + insurance vs availability of jobs that pay a living wage.  It hurts my heart to spend yet another year in a different state.  I'm the very first to pick apart something that is ""off"" when the entertainment industry takes a stab at my beloved NOLA.

This series got it right.  So much so, it left me staring open-mouthed at my screen a few times.  The venues, the restaurants, all of it.  I have a cabinet full of Port of Call cups, and Praline Connection is incredible.... I miss the ""big Rue"" on Magazine (also...Blockbuster!), and remember seeing a Better Than Ezra show at the Uptown Tips where the rhythm guitarist/keyboard player jumped and knocked down that big banana one Mardi Gras.  These people are my people, and now that I've run out of episodes, I'm going to miss them.

The license plate combinations were wrong, though. ;)

If this series did anything, it poured gasoline on my desire to move to NOLA.  I didn't realize I was going to miss it even more because of this show.  New Orleans makes my heart happy in a way I've never found words strong enough to explain.

To the creators:  Thank you for tackling an incredibly difficult subject with grace, humor, and without making it into some sort of caricature.  There were so many real-life events woven into the episodes (the murders of Helen Hill and Dinerral Shavers, etc) that were (and still are) so frustrating to comprehend.

This series was an extended love letter to the real New Orleans -- warts, corruption, and all.  Bravo.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to continue my 19-year search for a good job and a decent place to live in NOLA.  ""Home"" is a place where I've never lived.  I want to come home.",1452038400,2,2025,4.576601671309192

6029674,5,B00FRKKVL6,"It's too bad this series had to end. New Orleans is known for it's foot stomping, jive music and this show not only had wonderful music but showed the struggles of the town and individuals to continue to survive and keep their culture alive following Katrina. I would actually watch all four seasons of Treme for the music itself which I felt was the ""meat"" of the show but the people of New Orleans were an added plus. You can watch this for entertainment but if you become involved in what is really happening in the show you feel the struggle, pain, and amazing strength New Orlean's display every day.",1446249600,,605,4.509090909090909

Though as a show it's consistently a let down. There are so many 'main' characters that you never spend enough time on any one to feel as though you really care.

Most of the loose ends were tied up, and DJ Davis and Antoine grew into more responsible people throughout the series.  LaDonna became much more likable.  The only character I liked less was Annie T, who seemed to sacrifice her down-home quality to fame. I was disappointed that Toni's relationship didn't work out. It was interesting to get an insider's look at the music scene in NOLA, and I noted some of the real locations for my visit the end of this month, but there was a little too much music in Season 4, or maybe I felt that way because much of the music moved away from jazz. This show gave me so much insight into the culture of New Orleans that I am sure my upcoming trip will be much more meaningful than the first time I visited.",1438992000,3,820,4.243589743589744

6029816,5,B00FRKKVL6,"One of the best TV series in recent memory.  Idiots at HBO canceled the 4th season half way through.  Not enough breasts and vampires for the kiddies I guess.  There are only 4 episodes.  The first three are typical Treme and the last one is an effort to wind up all the story lines and get out of Dodge.  They also list a fifth episode as a back stage peek, but it's only 2 minutes long and not worth watching.  Seeing as how HBO doesn't rely on advertising revenue and does cash in on residuals, the on going popularity of this series among adult music lovers has to have the HBO programming committee regretting the bad decision to not let this series ride on to a natural conclusion.

They should not be charging full price for the 4th season.  They stiffed us all by cutting Treme short.",1438560000,,792,4.340136054421769

This series brought to life the rich and inspiring culture of New Orleans as well as shed light on the life and times of post Katrina victims and the political system of not just New Orleans but the system that runs rampant in this country.
I laughed, I cried, I was saddened and I rejoiced.  This series really made me think and inspired me as an artist.  For those of you out there that do not live the life of an artist be it musical, visual, performance, etc., know that the old adage ""Starving Artist"" is all to often true.  Support the artist's of this world in any way you can! Know that ALL culture has a significant role to play in all our lives, not just that of an artist.  It is important to remember where we came from and the importance of cultural awareness and the arts in ALL our lives.

6029909,5,B00FRKKVL6,"""Treme"" surprisingly flew under the radar for five years on HBO, but it is a premier product with outstanding scripts and a gifted cast.

Set in post-Katrina New Orleans it captures the struggles and triumphs of a mostly-black community determined to restore their district, its community and its traditions. Outstanding guest stars enhance the music of south Louisiana that carries you through the narrative, introduces you to the legends and tells a compelling story.

There is no filter on the savageness and corruption that eats away at the food, music and lifestyle that make New Orleans one of America's great cities in spite of its filth.

White and black, the cast is extraordinary. Now available on Amazon Prime, it is a must see.",1434758400,,739,4.991869918699187

6029964,4,B00FRKKVL6,"A bittersweet ending to a pretty interesting show.  I am unsure that a full season was warranted to close loose ends, as it was feeling a bit loose at the end of season 3.

This was pretty immersive to me - the main characters seemed like they could be real folks.  The only piece that didn't stick or make sense to me was John Goodman's suicide in the first (I think) season.  It just seemed a bit off with his character strength.  At the same time, his character overshadowed the smaller side stories that made this somewhat tangible.

It gave life to New Orleans as well, with real locations, etc.  I have only been there pre-Katrina, so it was comforting to see some things unaffected (Spotted Cat, Coop's, etc.).

So, long enough to tell the story, short enough that it didn't overstay its welcome.  I have new found respect for Steve Zahn as an actor as well.  He still got to pull his goofy card, but I preferred the introspective parts of his character.  His jarring realization of turning 40 and seeing that rejection of everything (including success) is sort of a childish path was well done.",1433721600,,1102,4.543147208121828

6030010,5,B00FRKKVL6,"This is a great production. I have no idea what is mentally deficient in those reviewers who poured out all that stupid vitriol. It is a TV show. Calm down. I had to report one guy's review because it was nothing more than a hate-spewing rant against the poor people in NOLA, having zero to say about the show. One person complained that there was too much music. Seriously? Are you really that much of a dim bulb? WTH? So many here review shows like kindergarten students answer questions.

Me: Does anyone have a question about what we talked about?

Little boy in my class: My grandpa has a cat.

This is how many of the reviews of this program sound. I seriously doubt any of these people suffer from the disease called ""Independent Thought"" because they came to a show that is NOT ""THE WIRE"" seemingly expecting it to be ""THE WIRE - NOLA EDITION"". Please, take that stupidity and shove it. REVIEW *THIS* SHOW AND DO NOT COMPARE IT TO A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SHOW! Pull your fingers out of your noses and give reviews like grown-ups.

With that in mind, this series uses many, many local NON- ACTORS playing themselves, as in ACTUAL  NOLA musicians. It follows the lives of many characters who happen to be working musicians, so there would be a lot of scenes of live music, frequently played by the actors, though ""Antoine Batiste"" is an actor and only plays for real occasionally. The story is all about how F-ed up the city was after the flood. It is a very accurate portrayal of how things went, down to how horrible the NOPD was during and after the storm and subsequent flood. It documents what actually happened and not what many seem to think happened in the city after so many lost their lives and property. It is sympathetic to the city. It even bashes one of the problems in the aftermath - ENTERGY. It calls out the failures by name through fictional characters who interact with real New Orleanians. It is, in short, excellent. The writing and acting are all of very high quality. It shows a small part of the heartbreak of life in NOLA as an educated-and-employed-but-still-poor black person trying to get life back together in such horrible conditions. It shows how hard it was for a lot of whites, too. In short, this is one of the best shows I have ever seen on television in that it takes a TRUE historical catastrophe and lays out the facts in a television drama of very high quality.

Go rant about your warped political views elsewhere, people. This is a place to review the qualities of a television show. Your noise is not needed here. I disagree with some of the politics and a lot of the morals in this show, but it is a STORY that is being told, not a bully pulpit for any of us to harp on politics or religion. Go whine on Facebook to your ""friends"" about Nagin or what some DB called ""the entitlement mindset"" in his ""review"" of this show.

The show is fine. You might love it as my wife and I did. You might hate it. Of course, the ones who I know who hated it also love to talk about ""The Price is Right"" and other such mindless drivel.

Like it or not, all the accusations leveled at the US Army Corps of Engineers, the NOLA city administration, the NOPD, all that, are either documented truth or were based on actual court cases that were tossed out because the cops tossed the evidence. A lot of people screwed up or screwed their fellow man in this disaster. This show does an excellent job of portraying how the locals had to live and deal with stuff after the flood - for years. I think it does an excellent job of that, regardless of how I feel, politically.

I have seen only one scene where the acting was poorly coached. And the music (criticized heavily by several who obviously know zero about being a musician or playing live music in clubs) is an excellent representation of NOLA musical culture. It is vivid and accurate, even if you do not like the style. It is by no means ""bad"" or otherwise lacking. (I am a full time professional musician in a symphony orchestra. I know what I am talking about here, as I do this stuff as a part of my daily life where I live.)

Like it or hate it, ""Treme"" is a well-crafted four year long docu-drama about what happened in a city that some dearly love and others seemingly like to vilify based on the ethnic makeup of the population. Whatever. If you want to comment on this review, please feel free to do so. I am sick of the BS posts hating on the people of NOLA, or that we should have let the city die. Screw you if you are one of those posters. I will be happy to discuss storylines, plot devices, acting, music, accuracy of events portrayed, et cetera. I will not discuss politics or religion. I have simply defended the SHOW from children who cannot grasp what a REVIEW of a SHOW is compared to a political screed. I also reviewed the show. I hope that if you like it that it prompts you to read up on what happened. You might find that much of what you passively ingested from CNN, FOX and their ilk is incorrect. It all was corrected, but sometimes it was years later that outsiders found out what happened, good of bad, and by then the child-like attention span of the US had drifted off to things like Justin Bieber or the battles between the right and left of this country.

Watch this show. It is neither slow nor unfocused. It is tight and detailed. If you have to have action in your docu-drama you are not ready to be watching a docu-drama. Dialog is the best part unless you have no ability to sit and listen to details. If that is the case then this is not the show for you. If you can handle dialog and lots of music with little in the way of police chases, explosions, shootings, and other devices aimed at dumbing us down, then you just might really like this series.",1427932800,7,5775,4.367783985102421

I would have liked to have seen them stretch it out a bit to include the mood of the city to the point when the BP oil spill was hitting this area, but that is a minor complaint. I will be waiting awhile to buy the DVD, as it just isn't right to price this at $26.00 +/- for just 5 episodes... I am just now getting around to buying season 3 which only recently dropped to this price point for the full season... I would hope these 5 episodes will drop to 12-15 bucks soon??

6030046,5,B00FRKKVL6,"This show, for me, is the definitive example of freaky good. Ive been watching movies and TV for a long time, and have a short list of movies that I feel are the epitome of craftsmanship per my tastes. This show beats anything I have ever seen by a wide margin.
This four year series was of the highest quality from start to finish. Seeing all of the world-class musicians take part in this type of production was an indescribable thrill. I loved the music. And I was so impressed by their acting. I suppose a lot of their ease in front of the camera is because of the amount of time they spend in the spotlight in real life. But all of the acting was great, which would probably be the result of uncompromising producing and directing from people with tastes very much in line with mine.
The casting, the writing, the attention to detail, the obvious use of a lot of input from expert advisors, everything about this series just blew me away. Not to mention the huge amount of love that went into this effort.

That any american drama can evoke such feelings of compassion for those of us, including me, who did not have much to begin with, is an outstanding achievement. The representation of everyday people living or eking out a daily existence before Katrina and living in her aftermath is a triumphant achievement. It is understood that this season and the preceding 3 was created for entertainment  and financial purposes, however, nothing at all in the seriousness and solemnity of the whole package can be justifiably labeled as such. Treme, absolutely all of it, especially the factual representation of the event is outstanding. The actors played their parts exquisitely and, though their portrayal of real and imagined characters might question why roles were even cast, everything fits together beautifully.

HBO cut the season short to save production costs and then charge fans the full season disc price.  Seems like a cynical money grab on the part of the network.

I will be buying this when the price drops because I am a fan of the show and I have all the other blu-ray sets.  In the meantime if you have to watch it Amazon and Apple both sell the entire digital HD season for just 14 dollars.

 Music plays such an essential character that I want to hear it repeatedly (I bought the soundtracks, but it's not the same).
 There is so much of the story that happened in real life, Treme is almost like a docu-drama. Matching up the news stories with the plot of the show is fascinating.
 The acting and writing are both so good it makes you weep.
 Each concert, each conversation, every back drop, was notoriously accurate to real life: not only did these shows occur with these people playing, the set list was just as portrayed. This is history.

This is my favorite series on all levels. I'm sorry there are only 4 seasons, I'm sorry season 4 is short. It deserves so much more.",1405382400,3,789,4.413793103448276

It's not great, but it's... there are no surprises, not much plot, and everything you expect to happen ends up happening. But, it's nice to spend a little extra time with the characters.

It would be stupid to watch the first 3 seasons and not watch this, but dial down your expectations.

There is something bittersweet about these final episodes, as many of the characters find what they have been looking for even if it means accepting less than they had hoped to find.

6030152,5,B00FRKKVL6,"The last season of one of my all-time -favorite tv series, this did not disappoint.

What will happen next to them? You can't ask for more than that. And the music..... !!!!!!",1394668800,,352,4.515625
6030153,5,B00FRKKVL6,"One enduring meme in television series is their tendency to ""jump the shark"" in search of new story lines a the years roll by.  For me, Treme avoided that temptation, faithfully progressing in directions that are true to each character's original premise.  In short, I think these people, and their lives, are believable.  I also salute this series for a fairly accurate impression of the progression of New Orleans itself as it has continued to recover from Katrina.",1394582400,,467,4.961538461538462

6030156,5,B00FRKKVL6,"I loved everything about that series; the theme (which needed - and still needs - better understanding of what caused it t get so bad, and what is - and isn't - being done to deal with it) the music (Ah, the music!) the feel, the taste, the smell, the love-of-life that is unique to New Orleans. And ""Treme"" captures it all. It was wonderful.
 The last season left you with a nostalgic feeling for the place and the people it introduced us to. I got the sense that they were leaving the door a bit open for continuing into another season. But maybe that was just the nature of what was portrayed. Or wishful thinking.",1394323200,,617,4.318965517241379

6030158,5,B00FRKKVL6,"Treme deserves way more attention than it has received.  I think that is because it is so unusual.  There is no lead character, or as was said in an interview, the lead character is the City.  That is not to say there is no ""story"" to Treme.  I do not like things without a good story.  Treme has multiple stories that develop at the same time, interweave, but each could stand alone.  Because of this it takes probably 3 episodes to get hooked.  But then you feel so moved and somehow educated, in the deepest sense of that word.  If you thought you knew New Orleans, you will likely find that you really only knew a slice.  If you do not know New Orleans, you should.  Treme shows us that New Orleans may be one of the most culturally rich cities in the world  Saying that makes me feel a little jingoistic, perhaps it is silly to suggest such a thing.  Treme unveils an amazing and beautiful city of blended cultures and traditions, and yet still very troubled.  It brings a sense of down home awe to this city.  Moreover, it highlights in personal depth, the incredible tragedy of Katrina.  It addresses the love of people transcending race, class and career, the love of music (real New Orleans musicians), the love of fine cuisine (real New Orleans chefs, you can almost taste the food), and the sadness and impact of corruption, classism, racism, poverty and violence.  All of this is told inside a set of individual stories, or stories of individuals after Katrina.  This is absolutely one of the best series, dramas, tv shows, or movies that I have ever seen.  I say all those things, because Treme is so hard to classify.  That is its greatness, and it is also why it may not have received the aplomb it deserves.  Best Picture, Best Supporting Actors, Best Filming, Best Directing, Best Screenplay, etc., etc.  But not a film, but a short, 3 season series.  Watch 3 episodes, if you are not hooked, I would be surprised.",1394064000,13,1931,4.520231213872832

6030160,5,B00FRKKVL6,"The five-episode fifth season is really better described as a miniseries. And yet, watching the episodes conveyed to me a sense that a full season had been stuffed in there. Any concerns about the show seemingly losing steam as season 3 progressed will quickly be allayed as the first episode rockets into the election of Barack Obama, the ascendance of Trombone Shorty, and a significant time jump for all the characters you've come to know and love.

The episodes are packed to the brim with music, to the point where some of the more peripheral characters are largely pushed out (Sonny, if I'm not mistaken, skips a couple of episodes entirely). However, everyone gets a resolution. Not a neat, tied up one that suggests their lives will be perfect from here on out, but something that satisfies the various plot threads that have been developing since season 3 (and really since the beginning). References to earlier episodes abound.

A special mention to the drama of cancer being played out. Having gone through similar scenarios myself more than once, the struggle of a family to deal with the issue was played out in a way that felt emotionally honest and extremely heart-rending.

The show ends demurely; honestly I can't even remember what the final shot is, but it doesn't matter. The last episode as a whole was an appropriate goodbye to a show that provided engaging and powerful storytelling for four years, again directed by Agnieszka Holland who directed the pilot, and again with some jaw-dropping imagery.

The packaging is a conventional DVD case (unlike the other seasons with their nice cardboard slipcases), but that's hardly a reason not to buy it. If you haven't finished the show, finish it, and if you haven't started it, start. It's a credit to HBO that they supported even this many episodes of a show that had very low viewership and (somehow) won them little to nothing in terms of awards and prestige, yet which consistently produced high art and covered important issues. A great show to the end.",1393891200,,2028,4.869565217391305
6030161,2,B00FRKKVL6,"We loved the Treme series overall so when the final season was available, I automatically ordered it without fully reviewing the information. I am not sure I would have paid the money for only 5 episodes; you can bet that I will be more careful from here on out.

6030164,5,B00FRKKVL6,"A real shame that 'Treme' didn't go on for longer, but we should also be grateful that we had three and half seasons in the first place, and that they had the chance to wrap things up - as much as any of the storytelling in 'Treme' could ever be wrapped up. If you don't like slow, loose, meandering stories and a unique mix of fiction and documentary, then this will not be for you. Otherwise, enjoy.
Here's hoping there is another HBO / David Simon hook up soon.",1393632000,,464,4.224719101123595
6030165,5,B00FRKKVL6,"It's sad to see this series wrap up, but this last, truncated season does it nicely.  New Orleans hasn't yet recovered from Katrina, but it didn't sink into the Gulf, as could easily have happened, and there are bright spots indicating that more improvements may yet be realized.

As they did in The Wire, the men behind Treme were unsparing of their targets--police corruption figuring greatly in both series--but at they same time they generously and humanely depicted the ordinary people who were trying to live decent and productive lives despite their many obstacles.  The entire range of Treme is more than worth watching, and worth watching again and again.",1393459200,3,664,5.0181818181818185
6030166,5,B00FRKKVL6,"Season 4 continues the excellent directing, acting, music, and culture portrayed in this under-appreciated saga.  The critics overlooked a real gem, although it was hard to watch some of my favorite characters in their final scenes.  The series really pulled me into the decade after Katrina.  David Simon's previous hit ""The Wire"" featured some of the same actors and told a much more hopeless tale that rose to the top with viewersgo figure.

6030168,4,B00FRKKVL6,"I own every season of Treme, but after watching this season, I'm not sure why the producers made it.  Everything was more or less wrapped up at the end of season 3.  Then they seemed to have to invent new scenarios just to end everything again.

I still liked it and I'll miss the series, because there's not that much that I make a point to watch, let alone buy.",1393200000,,363,4.1571428571428575

The Fourth Season was the finale and it was bitter sweet, I'm sorry it had to end. What a wonderful, interesting, and sometimes tragic story that needed to be told. Some fictionalize events and for the most part true. My prayer to the residents of Treme is that they all will return to their homes, jobs, and businesses, and restore their communities to what makes them so unique to New Orleans.

This story of the heartbreak of Katrina and the stories of resurrection through the cultural constants of the city take me back in spirit.  Treme's beautiful, well-crafted story lines have pulled me into the spell again, as an older, wiser being.

6030176,5,B00FRKKVL6,"Yes, the fourth season was abbreviated... only 5 episodes, but it gracefully ends this spectacular series. I've heard people say they were disappointed by the ending. I can understand that sensation but very strangely I felt more disappointed in myself... like I was abandoning the cast before they had resolved all the problems after the flood. A very weird aspect I know, but that's how it plays out in my mind. Like many series finales, there is plenty of margin to wonder what happened next and how things worked out for this character or that character. It is easy enough however to conjure acceptable endings for each character... not necessarily happy-ever-after situations, but happy enough to get by. Especially when there is no getting around the fact that life goes on. In retrospect, this series most likely touched a very personal nerve with me since I used to spend a lot of time in NOLA and the familiarity of the area made it seem very real. Also, as a musician, one cannot help but be captivated by the music and equally impressed by the level of involvement and participation on the part of so many of the greatest players from the area. Their performances add the absolute authenticity that makes this series what it is (was). I am so thankful I was turned on to this series by a musician friend. I will watch the entire run (presented as 4-seasons, but it's actually more like 3 and a half) many times over, I am sure.",1392336000,,1438,4.643137254901961
