7879877,4,6304925107,"An interesting MELDING of the late 1800's and the future world of Inter Galactic Travel. Very nicely handled concerning both worlds, but to Sherlock Holmes fans more importantly, concerning the dress and settings which of course were all too brief for those who like Victorian settings.
This episode of Star Trek The Next Generation is the completion (or maybe not?) or at least the next installment of the Sherlock Holmes episode begun in episode #29. As such, it was a welcome addition to the first half as any Sherlock Holmes fan will tell you, that is if they liked the first part, which my wife and I did. I am NOT a Trekkie we just enjoy MOST of the Sherlock Holmes related films that we have seen. For those who like the actors in The Next Generation series or those who like Sherlock Holmes films, both will enjoy this continuation. The setting, the story, the actors, the quality were all enjoyable.",1302912000,,908,4.645962732919255
7879878,5,6304925107,"with Daniel Davis playing Dr. Moriarty, Lt. Data's ""Shirlock Holmes'"" arch enemy. One of the best story lines written by the staff of TNG. Episode 138 is a sequel to Episode 29, ""Elementary, Dear  Data"" from the 1st season. The ending to this episode will have you  wishing there were another season of TNG to make yet another sequel.",961977600,4,334,4.6440677966101696
7879879,3,6304925107,"While Data and Geordi are role-playing in the Holodeck as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, the Holodeck malfunctions.  Geordi and Data quit the program and ask Barclay to inspect the program when Holmes' arch-enemy  appears right in front of Barclay, requesting to speak to Captain Picard  about leaving the Holodeck.  Moriarty successfully leaves the Holodeck  later on, but is this for real?  This story is a sort of sequel to the 2nd  season episode ""Elementary, Dear Data,"" but I like the 2nd season  episode better because it has humor and just a little more suspense, I  think, than ""Ship in a Bottle.""",961804800,2,607,4.872549019607843
