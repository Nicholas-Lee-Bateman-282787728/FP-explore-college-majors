8463871,5,B000FQISIK,It's funny and I was missing this volume from my collection,1471046400,,59,4.454545454545454
8463872,5,B000FQISIK,"It seems like another bizarre character pops up every few episodes of ""Hare + Guu."" And in ""Hare + Guu, Volume 4"" we actually get two of them -- not only do they reveal a lot more about Weda's murky past and cause new problems for Hare, but they bring a new brand of craziness and surreality to the jungle village. There are some supremely touching moments, but most of it is all lunacy.

The high-spirited village festival takes an odd turn when, after Clive tries to seduce Weda again, Guu starts up a game-show-esque competition -- with Hare's mom as the prize. Now Hare, Marie, Clive and Uighur are all hell-bent on winning Weda for their own. And when Lazy demands an ""open report"" for homework, Hare starts investigating the legends of the jungle... and finds out some pretty weird facts about his neighbor Rebecca.

Then Hare encounters a weird woman in a long coat (Bell) and a man with scary eyes (Ashio) in the jungle -- and through Guu's intervention and some mistakes, they end up in a coffin on Weda's doorstep. Turns out Ashio and Bell are childhood friends of Weda's, and they've come from her old, sumptous home in the city on her mother's orders. Their goal: find out who Hare's dad is.

But Weda's not spilling the beans. As Bell and Ashio embed themselves in the household, Hare finds out a little more about his mother's past -- and why she had to leave her home for the jungle.

The biggest plot developments in ""Hare + Guu Volume 4"" is, obviously, the entrance of Ashio and Bell -- he's a nice, laid-back guy who frightens small children, and she's a bombastic housemaid who treats him like her personal punching bag. And both of them are in love with Weda -- Ashio a little more quietly, while Bell's lesbian crush seems to be displayed by giant nose-fountains of blood.

And they haven't diminished the amount of weirdness in the jungle. We get grotesque urban legends, pokute housecleaning, the Five-Man Mid-Color Sentai, old Dama wrecking Clive's room, and the ""burning"" love of the Stupid Couple (""Can I burn their love for real?"" Guu asks, clutching a Molotov cocktail). But there are some touching moments as well when Ashio reveals the circumstances of Weda leaving her old home, and why she refused to reveal her lover's identity.

In fact, a bunch of characters get some character development: we see Weda's old resentments and her love for her son, as well as the innocent young girl she once was; and there's Clive's feelings of guilt over getting Weda pregnant and derailing her once-luxurious life (""Do you hate me?"" he asks her at one point). And when Hare finds out what happened in his mom's past, the poor kid understandably starts blaming himself -- but fortunately Guu's wackiness snaps him back to normal.

""Hare + Guu Volume 4"" is a wild little ride with some new characters who manage to be even more bizarre than the jungle residents. And it's only going to get stranger.",1241740800,,2917,4.65242718446602
8463873,5,B000FQISIK,"By this point in the series, I believe that anyone who has purchased the first three volumes must be hooked by now.

There are crucial plot points in this volume (including the arrival of some very strange people from Hare's past) as well as the usual comic gags that the fans have come to expect and love.",1165363200,,306,4.368421052631579
8463874,5,B000FQISIK,"I have absolutely fallen in love with this series.

I won't get into the story at the risk of spoiling it for anyone, but I must say that this newest volume does not disappoint in that department. I'll just say this - You'll never see a game show like a ""Hare+Guu"" game show.

Serious bits are interspersed between the comedy and makes for a nice balance - not too much drama in a show that's primarily about the humor.

Visually, H+G looks just as good as you'd come to expect after four volumes, though the abundance of night shots in the volume add for some interesting new effects and a bit of variety in the normally vibrant color scheme of the day scenes of the series.

Aurally, the music matches the series perfectly, and the dubbing is spot on. Hare's English voice actor conveys the young boy's sense of neurotic worry expertly, and the script holds up quite well despite the difference in English and Japanese natural dialogue.

Extras are fun, the translation notes return once again and explain jokes that would fly over the heads of the English audience well. The Voice Recording Outtakes are funny, but tragically short. Production galleries are similarly entertaining, yet also feel a bit lacking. Nothing too noticable, though.

The DVD menus are also entertaining, as they always manage to capture the essence of the episodes to be found on the DVD.

All in all, this volume is just another reason I've come to love this series as much as I do. I'm very much looking forward to the next volume!",1160697600,2,1512,4.640449438202247
