4486183,4,B004WCSMFW,The representations (for lack of better words) are super.  The actors are really good.  Some of the plots are not so good.,1370476800,,122,4.5
4486184,5,B004WCSMFW,"In some respects the movie series surpasses the books in which Hornblower comes across rather stiffly compared to the greater sense of being a human being the actor gives us. His acting is, I think, especially good plus the realism of the settings fills in some elements not present in the written form. This entire series is worth watching and in my case owning for repeat viewing.",1363910400,,382,4.7164179104477615
4486185,5,B004WCSMFW,delivery of product quick. quality of product great. only disappointment was to find it was not closed caption enabled. (i am hard of hearing,1355270400,2,141,4.916666666666667
4486186,5,B004WCSMFW,"If I could I would give this Hornblower cast all ten stars! Excellent! The settings, the acting and the stories. My husband and I have watched them many times, all the battles, the emotions, the unfairness, the justice,loyalty and companionship at high seas and each time, enjoyed them thoroughly.  Ioan Gruffudd as Horaito Hornblower (main character) but the supporting cast are also superb actors: Robert Lindsay Commodore and Admiral) Sir Edward Pellew;Jamie Bamber as Lieutenant Archie Kennedy (Hornblower's best friend and so many others. If you like the tales of the high seas and battles and adventures set in late 1700 and early 1800, you'll love these series.",1349827200,,668,5.185185185185185
4486187,5,B004WCSMFW,"The 6 DVD movies we have viewed over the past week are excellent . We want to order more as these are of excellent quality .Not sure if there are more we have not viewed yet .
Boxed set of four included ( The wrong War ,The Duchess & the devil ,The fire ships ,The duel ). The set of two (Duty & Loyalty ) is marked as the new adventures .

Are there any ones I have not ordered yet ?
I believe there may be two more I have not seen yet .",1328659200,6,438,3.610526315789474
4486188,5,B004WCSMFW,"I almost pre-ordered this Set until I enlarged the cover art. The 2 movies in this Set are ""The Duchess and the Devil"" & ""The Wrong War"", movie numbers 3&4 in the original 4-movie Hornblower release. The other 2 movies (1&2) in that Set were ""The Duel"" & ""First Ship"". I would rate this whole series ""5-Stars"" for both Production and Acting. If you haven't seen any of this series, it is will worth the price.",1310774400,42,409,4.394736842105263

4486206,5,B004WCSMFW,"These are great films; full of swash-buckle and adventure; HOWEVER, continue reading my review before you decide to buy this set.

To view chronologically:
  #1-4: A&E's 4-volume set ""Horatio Hornblower.""
  #5-6  A&E's 2- volume set: ""Horatio Hornblower, The New Adventures.""  ""Loyalty"" as #5, and ""Duty"" as #6.  [This set does not indicate which to view first.]
  #7: ""Captain Horatio Hornblower,"" with Gregory Peck & Virginia Mayo.

DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY WITH ""Horatio Hornblower, The Further Adventures.""  This 2-sided DVD is simply the same as Vol 3 & Vol 4 of the 4-volume set from A&E.",1398902400,25,593,5.0625
4486207,5,B004WCSMFW,"Since seeing this on TV when I was younger, I found the lead character and his sea adventures quite interesting.  Being young and finding patience with his crew, you see how they both grow in maturity and how they chose not to leave his leadership.  I would recommend this to individuals who like the Navy and adventures on the high  seas.",1398211200,3,339,4.524590163934426
4486208,4,B004WCSMFW,"I'll take the blame for overlooking the details, but this is just part of the original series. I saw the ""Further Adventures"" and thought it was new material. Not! Though I have really enjoyed the series I was frustrated for ""Further Adventures"" to be the same stuff repackaged.",1370649600,5,278,4.8125
