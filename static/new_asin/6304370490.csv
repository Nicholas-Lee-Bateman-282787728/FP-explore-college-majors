851970,3,6304370490,"Blades is a bizarrely entertaining parody of Steven Spielberg's breakthrough feature film Jaws.  However, in place of a 25 foot great white shark, we have a multi-bladed diesel powered lawn mower that appears to be operating all on its own (a la Maximum Overdrive). Instead of a  beach resort for a setting we have an uppity country club golf course, inhabited by well-to-do, soon-to-be-human-yard-clippings.  And by parody I do not mean comedy because Blades is not funny in the ha-ha kind of way.  The cast seem to take little notice of the ridiculous premise and carry it through with straightforward, almost matter-of-fact  performances.  It is a laugh-riot for sure but we're not talking Naked Gun or Scary Movie here.  Blades would probably be more at home sitting beside This is Spinal Tap.  Just as Tap sends up Heavy Metal and all of its inanities, Blades finds a clever way to poke fun at one of the most accomplished horror films of all time.  Not bad.  Not bad at all.

This Troma DVD also came with 2 other full-length features: Blood Hook and Zombie Island Massacre making for a fantastic Tromo Triple B-Header!",1101168000,5,1125,4.807291666666667
851971,2,6304370490,"This is not a zombie movie (warning: spoiler will follow). Even with its bad acting and horrible lighting (could be the tape) this is an at times enjoyable mystery which uses the zombie theme to throw the viewer off the track of what is really happening. A group of tourists take a visit to an island apparently in the Carribean (I know; not much more specific than saying an island surrounded by water) where they take a bus to an outdoor ritual apparently being performed to raise a zombie. A commotion occurs during the ritual sending the tourists hurrying back to the bus only to find the driver and the distributor cap missing. They decide to trek to a house one of the tourists recalls seeing on the way to the ritual to hopefully call for help. They are pursued by a creature dressed as a bush (no, I do not know what kind of bush). One by one the tourists are being offed mysteriously on the way to the house until only a handful of them make it to the house to hold up against whatever is pursuing them. As it turns out, one of them is carrying a payoff for a shipment of drugs and the pursuers are after the drug traffickers (just using the so-called zombie tactics for the element of fear). The first half hour of this film drags, however, after that it does maintain an element of suspense. It is not a particularly intelligent movie, but it may appeal to someone who would like a mystery with a supernatural backdrop.-Bob",1100390400,,1434,4.415094339622642

851973,5,6304370490,"This DVD includes three movie ""pick-ups"" from Troma, ""Blood Hook"", ""Blades"", and ""Zombie Island Massacre"". Alone, none of these films is among Troma's best, but now that they are all out on a single disc, with a brand new introduction by Lloyd Kaufman, the president of Troma Studios and the mother of the Toxic Avenger, the whole is much greater than the sum of the parts.
The first film in this non-trilogy is ""Blades"" (1989), a very entertaining and funny tale of a killer lawn mower (!) on a golf course. This I had never seen until getting this DVD, and I was quite surprised by how enjoyable it was. (I am not a fan of golf. Sorry.) This was made by and with many people who's names will be familiar to Troma fans, including John P. Finnegan, Peter Cosimano, Kara Callahan, and Alan Smithee. Directed by Thomas Rondinella.
""Blood Hook"" (1986) is possibly the greatest movie about fishing, or more exactly a sociopathic killer who uses fishing equipment to kill his victims, ever made. This not enough to recommend it, but it is a very good movie, with many interesting characters and events. This movie does tend to get a bit silly at times, but is full of laughs. It stars Lisa Todd, Mark Jacobs, and Christopher Whiting. Directed by Jim Mallon.
The weakest of the three is ""Zombie Island Massacre"" (1983), a very tedious, boring, uninteresting, repetitive film that doesn't employ any actual zombies as actors. This is not much of a horror film, it's more of a mystery, and I do not like mystery movies. It involves a bunch of Americans running afoul of a group of ""zombies"" while vacationing in the islands. This motion picture is not all bad, though, as it does have some entertainingly gory deaths. It stars Rita Jenrette, Tom Cantrell, and Debbie Ewing. Directed by John T. Carter.
The true joy of this DVD, though, is getting to see all of the movies in a single sitting. This easily outweighs any of the shortcomings that the actual movies themselves may have. This is a great way to spend a day off, relaxing while watching a trio of entertaining, low-budget films.",1074124800,15,2080,4.654891304347826
851974,5,6304370490,"Maybe it's because I've studied voodoo history and island cults for years in grad school, but I highly suggest that you add ""Zombie Island Massacre"" to your movie collection now.
A group of tourists decide to venture over to the remote island of Who-Knows-Where - Mistake #1.  The tourists are too busy screwing around to notice the island is inhabited by blood-thirsty (and might I add, very scary) zombies - Mistake #2.
A few voodoo ceremonies and ritulistic killings later and you're knee deep in a pool of terror! The director does an excellent job of making the picture really dark and grainy, so half the time, you have no idea what's going on. Brilliant!
Throw the lovely and talented Rita Jenrette (""The Malibu Bikini Shop"") into the fold, and what you have here is a horror film that is destined to be a cult classic for years to come.
If you don't add this to your movie collection soon, that might be considered... Mistake #3.",1014508800,3,937,4.644578313253012
851975,5,6304370490,"For starters any film featuring 'internationally acclaimed superstar' Rita Jenrette is a must see for every man, woman and beast.  Add to this a title to rival 'Demented Death Farm Massacre', 'hedge' zombies, and a bus load of amateur actors (some seem animated in death even without the aid of zombification), and Troma have another glorious money spinner on their hands. As the cod-Vincent Price voice-over tells us in the trailer, we're in for a 'wonderful' holiday of ""violence, terror, torture and death."" Well, can you remember a holiday brochure that provides the customer with what it promises? All of it though, is shot through with such an endearing sense of fun that it will remain on your video shelf for many holidays to come. Many will criticise the film for its distinct lack of zoms- giraffe-necked Simon (from the Steven Spielberg school of minge)proclaimed, ""It's just a man disguised in a bush!"" upon watching it, refusing to wait for the denouement when the 'supernatural' element of the film is revealed; notably Jenrette's gravity-defying assets. The beauty of this film is in refusing to provide the audience with what they expect and instead presenting them with a post-Robert Sabbag mystery adventure revolving around cocaine-trafficking. And the character of Reginald Chumley Jones is perfectly indicative of those tour-guides who mislead the general public and contribute to a truly hellish holiday (anyone in England who has seen Judith Chalmers on 'Wish You Were Here?' will understand what I mean.) Perhaps the mystery at the centre of the film is why the Caribbean band that is seen at the beginning is comprised of half 'JOLLY BOYS' and half 'JOLLY BROTHERS'. Are half of them simply wearing skinny rib T-shirts or is a far more sinister implication being made about gangs of men who stick together? Best moment of the film is when the hairy simian-looking boyfriend of Jenrette manages to find a loaded gun in the back garden of a deserted house before Jenrette reveals an intimate knowledge of the joys of cannibalism that would put Jeffrey Dahmer to shame- ""German, French and Italian, and its all on cannibalism!"" Finally, the art of chowing down on your fellow homo-sapien kindred has gone multi-national and on 'Zombie' island there is even archival proof. Another nugget of wisdom from the end of the trailer.....""On Zombie Island, you might lose your heart...you'll also lose your head."" With its intellectual complexity and moments of heart-rending emotion, 'Zombie Island Massacre' finally delivers its last promise. Definitely five-star!",992304000,3,2580,5.157517899761337
