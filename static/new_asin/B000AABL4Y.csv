2383489,5,B000AABL4Y,"To answer the reviewer's question below, I am a US History teacher who has used this video numerous times in my classroom. The video presents an objective (at least as objective as one can be about what is essentially a terrorist organization) history of what one professor who is interviewed calls an ""American-born terrorist group."" Created by the History Channel, this video covers the history of the Klan from its beginnings in the post-Civil War, Reconstruction-Era South to modern-day variations such as David Duke and the Skinheads. In a sense the video is also a history of the civil rights movement in America, as it is during periods of activism for equal rights that the Klan has been the most active - and deadly - hate group in American history. The video argues that during its history the Klan has not been a stable or consistent organization. Instead, it goes through cycles - it rises up to oppose minority rights and promote ""White Supremacy,"" then nearly dies out, then rises yet again out of its own ashes to oppose civil rights activists in another historical era.

The Klan's first period of power was in the post-Civil War South, when whites felt threatened by the newly freed slaves and used the Klan to try and thwart their newly-won civil rights, with considerable success. The organization then died away until 1915, when it was reborn at Stone Mountain, Georgia. In the 1920s it spread across the USA, with ""klaverns"" in all 48 states and some 4-5 million members. It opposed not only blacks, but Jews, Catholics, and nearly all immigrant groups. They staged a parade down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, and controlled the state government in Indiana. But the Klan self-destructed in a series of scandals, ranging from the brutal rape-murder of a white woman in Indiana, bribery and blackmail of politicians, and the embezzling of funds by the Klan leadership. By the thirties the Klan was again virtually extinct, yet it rose again in the fifties and sixties to oppose the civil rights movement with bombings, lynchings, assassinations of civil rights workers and leaders, and other acts of violence. However, the FBI and other federal law-enforcement agencies, backed by President Lyndon Johnson, went after the most dangerous Klan groups by bribing its members to turn in those who had committed crimes against civil rights workers and leaders, and using the IRS to destroy the Klan financially. In the 1970s the Klan tried to change its image by using men such as David Duke in Louisiana to promote the view of the ""Klan next door"" as Julian Bond, a prominent civil rights leader, calls him. Unlike previous Klan leaders, Duke wears business suits and looks, talks and acts like a professional businessman, not a stereotypical, backwoods ""hick"" Klansman. Yet the documentary clearly shows Duke to be just as racist and dangerous as previous, less-polished Klan leaders.

  This video is not for the faint of heart - at its beginning and end the documentary shows a modern-day Klan rally in North Carolina, and the ""n"" word and other racial epithets are spoken frequently. Yet my students (black, white, and Hispanic) have learned a great deal from this video about the nature of hate groups and racism in America - and I believe they'll be better-prepared to resist such groups in their own lives. If you want a factual yet deeply disturbing ""inside"" look at America's most famous native-born terrorist group, then this video is the best you can buy.

PS - I wrote this review many years ago, and while the Klan is still (fortunately) feeble, I thought it worth noting that many of the views it expressed are still unfortunately alive and well as of 2016. Many of the issues which are driving the current 2016 presidential campaign - nativism, anti-immigration, opposition to much of mainstream science, fear and loathing of minority groups among certain segments of the populace - are strikingly similar to the Klan's beliefs at its height of national power in the 1920s. During that decade the Klan advertised itself as a super-patriotic organization that promoted white, native-born Protestant Christians as being superior to everyone else, vigorously opposed immigration and religious minorities such as Catholics and Jews, and supported religious fundamentalist, morally restrictive legislation such as Prohibition and forbidding the teaching of evolution in public schools, even though a good deal of the Klan's leadership privately drank liquor, among many other hypocrisies. History does sometimes run in cycles, and while the Klan itself may be a spent force, many of the ideas it promoted sadly appear to have retained their attraction for a not-insignificant percentage of our population. For that reason, this documentary is still well worth watching some twenty years after it was first released.",1139011200,46,4845,5.074027603513175
2383490,5,B000AABL4Y,This well respected and authentic depiction of this documentary should receive the upmost praises.  Finally the History Channel brings to viewers how this demonic secretive fraternal society of hate and fear(Ku Klux Klan)was originated and is still presently preserved.  I fully endorse any educator to show this video as a real portraiture of American History.,1079395200,9,361,5.545454545454546
2383491,4,B000AABL4Y,This movie brings out the best and the worst in American History.  We see the rise of the KKK and the power they once had over minority population.  It's not always pretty to look at but it is something knowone can deny.  Worth buying!,971222400,2,235,4.295454545454546
2383493,5,B000AABL4Y,"I must start out by stating that I neither agree, nor disagree with the views of The Ku Klux Klan. However, I do believe that like any other organization, they have the right to peacefully assemble, and have their rallies. Obviously, I do not believe they had the right to murder innocent people, as they did in the very early days of The Klan. Now, that being said, I thoroughly enjoyed this documentary, from a historical point of view. I really learned a lot of historical facts about our country from viewing this. I really would recommend watching this documentary, to understand The Klan, who they are, and what they stand for, They feel that their cause is as important as those of The Black Panthers, Jesse Jackson, and Al Sharpton, So go ahead, watch it open minded, and see what you think.

2383495,5,B000AABL4Y,"I have studied and have always been interested in the Klan, due to my love of the civil war era and interest into hate groups.

2383496,5,B000AABL4Y,"I use this in my classroom within a unit on the civil rights movement; the students are totally engrossed when we watch, and it has a great format in segmenting which allows for discussion during the program without really interrupting it.",1370304000,,239,4.853658536585366
2383497,5,B000AABL4Y,The KKK dominated politics in BOTH North and South since the late 19th Century. They enforced segregation to keep African American men away from White women and to deny them power. While majority of White Americans did not support the race violence but they supported Segregation. This encouraged this type of behavior because the KKK knew that public would not go against them since they were enforcing the racial standards of the day. BOTH Political Parties had their hands in the KKK Pockets. THE DVD is very informative although it could been brought up Storm Thurmond or Harry Byrd both Democrats. Sadly racial violence has not gone away-Pity the human animal,1368316800,,664,4.990990990990991
2383498,5,B000AABL4Y,This is a great documentary to show in class.  My class watched it and they got a good grasp on the KKK organization and it's history.,1364688000,,134,4.153846153846154
2383499,5,B000AABL4Y,"As a white man mixed with cherokee native american blood and who is also a Born-Again Christian,I in NO WAY support the Klan or their wicked ways. They can claim to be ""Christians"" all day long,but I assure you that THEY ARE NOT! God's love is for EVERY PERSON of EVERY RACE AND COLOR.There is NO place in the Bible where it says that the white race is above ANY other race. As Christians,we are to love EVERYONE.The KKK admires the God-less heathen,Adolf Hitler. Adolf Hitler who was a communist,jew-hating,closet homosexual. Hitler was NOT a Christian neither. He was an admirer of Aliester Crowley. A well known Satanist who hated God and Jesus Christ and who indulged himself with sexual sin,including pedophilia! And the KKK looks up to Hitler??? Who was a follow of somebody like Crowley??? Hypocrites! Most of the Klan members aren't even Christians. Most of which are closet Pagans who are members of the Freemasonary. So,don't ever think that there is a connection between Christianity and the KKK.There is not.",1355097600,,1020,4.901734104046243

2383503,2,B000AABL4Y,"The Holy Bible's verses in 1 John 4:7 & 8 says: Beloved, let us Love one another: for Love is of God; and every one that Loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. He that Loveth not knoweth NOT God; for God is Love. The Ku Klux Klan was good for like the first 5 years of its creation but became Evil for over the next 100 years up to present day. The Ku Klux Klan are NOT Christians because Christianity is Peaceful. I would ask anybody to show me Holy Bible's verses that Christianity is violent like the Muslims' so called religion named: Islam a.k.a. Quran/Koran is violent? Racists say for example that green sweet peppers are not sweet peppers because green sweet peppers are not the yellow sweet peppers or the orange sweet peppers or even the red sweet peppers (for that is nonsense of course). I thank the Lord Jesus Christ which is Jehovah God Almighty for helping the black people/African Americans. I would also like to thank Martin Luther King, Jr. and also all those that died to abolish slavery against black people/African Americans now Rest in Peace until the Resurrection for all of you are missed!",1277337600,2,1114,4.51980198019802
2383504,3,B000AABL4Y,"The word ""democrat"" was carefully omitted from 'The Ku Klux Klan - A Secret History'.  This cannot have been done by accident. Well, okay..I guess the people that produced it could have been completely ignorant of the Ku Klux Klan's history.  Is it a secret that the democratic party gained its power on a pro-slavery platform and that most all of the ""first"" klansmen were democrats?  Would the producers of this film like it to be a secret?  Why omit this rather large piece of the Ku Klux Klan's ""history""?  Each time the film shows a newsreel of a past Democrat that was sympathetic with the  Ku Klux Klan  - the narrator only (and I stress ONLY) states any given Democrat politician's  name...never their party affiliation.  Not so when it came to a Republican politician that was a known member.  Why?  Why include the word ""Republican"" in the film yet exclude the word ""Democrat""  - especially given the history of the Ku Klux Klan!?!",1267747200,12,941,4.670731707317073

2383506,4,B000AABL4Y,"My 11 year old son was asking about the subject of the KKK, his interest sparked by a book they were reading in school.  I wanted to explain it without prejudice and using facts, that I genuinely did not know.  So, I turned to this video.  Our whole family sat quietly and watched thie History Channel production.  It was done so well.  Both my sons, (11 & 13 yrs old) understood all that was being told, the language was common, and the deliverance kept their interest.  The only negative is that the video, dated 2005, seemed a bit old and had not been updated.  The facts were presented in a chronological, easy to understand manner.  Persoanlly, I walked away from the video with more knowledge than I expected.  The lesson of good turning evil came through loud and clear, and my sons really got it.  This is a good video for educational purposes.",1229040000,5,852,4.509803921568627
2383507,1,B000AABL4Y,"As a professor of political science, I've used this DVD in class as a look into the KKK but more so as an examination of bias.  Don't ask me how, but the History Channel managed to get through this entire production without using the word DEMOCRAT.  They're quick to point out Republican klan involvement in 1920's Indiana, but manage to turn a blind eye to the Democratic Party's klan involvement in the South.  It's a valuable lesson in how bias can come in the form of OMISSION.  Unless that's your purpose, I strongly recommend avoiding this DVD.",1228176000,12,550,4.639175257731959
2383508,4,B000AABL4Y,"The History Channel does a fine, if occasionally subjectively nuanced, job of presenting the viewer with a history of the Ku Klux Klan from it's beginnings in post-Civil War America.

The Klan is an ugly organization, no matter what form it takes. Any group that actively espouses the suppression of others as part of its core beliefs is ugly by definition. When that suppression takes the form of lynchings and bombings and other brutalities, ""ugly"" as a word does not suffice.

Although some other reviewers have stated that the ""Why"" of Klan history is missing from this film, and that this film does not present matters from the perspective of Klan members, those criticisms are misplaced. The ""Why"" of the Ku Klux Klan is part of the fabric of this documentary, and there are certainly enough film clips and short interviews with Klansmen to present a Klan-based perspective. Certainly, comments by robe-wearing Klansmen that ""I got no problem if somebody kills a [black]; they don't have the right to breathe free air,"" and ""The only reason [blacks] are free is because some liberal Jew[ish] teacher types freed them,"" can be taken as statements of creed to judge from history, and not merely individual opinions.

The script does occasionally slide into a less than journalistically neutral tone, but describing the bombing of a church and the killing of four young black girls as a ""disgusting"" and ""terrible"" act of violence is not stating more than the truth. The idea that the Klan nowadays is ""merely"" a Christian fraternal segregationist organization is a dangerous oversimplification. If this is so, then why use the symbols and language of hatred and oppression?

It is far too easy for a viewer to deride the traditional pointed hoods of the Klan as being form-fitting for the membership, but an understanding of the Klan is crucial to understanding our nation. A group which once boasted over 4,000,000 members and effective political control of the entire State of Indiana, not to mention numerous municipalities throughout the United States, is a group which must be reckoned with, even today, if for no other reason than they represent one dark aspect of the underpinnings of our diverse and dynamic society. Xenophobia seems anachronistic in an Internet world shrunk to the size of the head of a pin. Still, it continues to exist, and the whys and wherefores of that existence must be addressed.",1223078400,5,2416,4.987593052109181

2383510,4,B000AABL4Y,"---an excellent historical account on the history of the ku klux klan, america's most enduring 'hate' group, and effectively the longest lasting 'terrorist' outfit..

The documentary traces the groups roots to the immediate aftermath of the Civil War, when the resentful, reactionary elements of various white communities saw fit to end any notion of political and economic equality for blacks newly freed in by the Emancipation proclamation.  Virtually nothing was beneath them in terms of how far they were willing to go to achieve their goals:  vandalism, arson, theft, kidnapping, assaults, and  most of all, murder.

The core Klan membership at its initial onset was quasi-Pagan/quasi-Masonic in its philosophies (i.e., the Skulls & Bones fraternity), but that eventually evolved by the turn of the 20th century to using fundamentalist evangelical Christianity as a recruitment tactic, targeting anyone from a WASP background as a potential member, while also now incorporating Jews and Catholics on their list of enemies (early 20th century immigration by Irish, Italian, Poles, and Eastern Europeans contributed to reactionary fears among the ""established"" white Americans).

Marketed as a men's social club no different than the Elks, Masons, or other groups, the Klan had widespread national membership by the first few decades of the 20th century. By the early 1920's, avowed members had  achieved real political power in the State of Indiana-- the governor and most of state board of legislature were members of the Klan.  A heinous murder and rape of a politician's mistress caused a scandal that sent shockwaves throughout the organization; dossiers on documented bribes & blackmails were revealed, and national board members were internally charged with financial impropriety.

This led to a splintering of the Klan into regional factions that has virtually continued until the present day.

Still existing to varying degrees in the contiguous USA, the most prominent factions emerged from the American South as the American Civil Rights Movement got momentum in the 1950's.  white attacks against blacks became even more brazen than before, only during the televised confrontations this was perhaps the first time it was visually documented in any form.

existing Footage is seen of klan leaders and other segregationists; US historians are interviewed as are historical and contemporary civil rights activists.

As the documentary reveals, from the dawn of the Reagan administration, the Klan morphed its image yet again; self-identified KKK members are (at least officially) barely a few thousand in number; however, their philosophical ken now largely exist in the ranks of the far-right ""Patriot"" militia movements and the youth-heavy white-supremacist 'Skinhead' culture.

The documentary could have benefited from more interview footage from the persons involved; and little attention is given to the post-Klan movements like the militias/skinheads, etc.  Still, this is an effective work.",1195430400,4,3010,5.5701754385964914

2383512,5,B000AABL4Y,"As a white Irish-Catholic, I remember stories that my dad, a member of the Knights of Columbus, told me about the K of C. Long before my lifetime, in the 1920s', the KKK had reached its pinnacle of power. While African-Americans were the most common targets of their hate crimes, they also made it clear that Jews, Catholics and foreigners were also in their cross-hairs. My dad explained that one of the reasons that the K of C grew both large and influential was, among other reasons, to combat the power of the Klan. They recognized the threat that they were to all decent Americans and worked to limit their power. My own perception of the KKK and others of their ilk, are of an ignorant and backward group of losers who seek to elevate their own perceived importance at the expense of others who they hold as inferior. This documentary shows today's Klan for what it is--poor white trash who would rather try to hold others back then raise themselves out of their own cesspool of crudity and ignorance.
