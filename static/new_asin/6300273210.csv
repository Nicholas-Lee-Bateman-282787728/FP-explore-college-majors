293514,4,6300273210,"I went in half expecting Sheriff Andy. This incredible tour de force of Griffith's was staggering. I find it impossible to believe his performance was not nominated from the Academy in the year it was released. An amazing piece of work. All of the actors were good, but Griffith had me spellbound. I highly recommend.",1510185600,,317,4.781818181818182

293516,5,6300273210,Andy Griffith did such an amazing job on this movie..Like Night and day of a character from him time running around with Barney. A Gem of a movie that I stumbled on.,1507593600,,165,4.1875

293521,5,6300273210,"This film was not well received upon its release back in 1957, but it has been reevaluated in recent years. I hadn't seen it in many years, even had forgotten it until I bought the streamed version from Amazon. Andy Griffith is simply incredible as Lonesome Rhodes. It is difficult to believe this was his first film. I am sure that if this film had been released in later years, he would have probably won the Best Actor Academy award. The film was overlooked back then and it came and went. Patricia Neal was equally superb as his costar, I thought she was great in Hud (her Oscar winning role) but she was better in this film. And the supporting cast of newcomers, Walter Matthau, Tony Franciosa, and Lee Remick, went on to greater fame. I was glad to add this film to my collection.",1503014400,2,786,4.427586206896552
293542,5,6300273210,Wonderful movie Patricia Neal and Andy Griffith made a great duo in this film.,1498262400,,78,4.642857142857143
293543,5,6300273210,"Andy Griffith proved that he was a versatile and amazing 5/5 star actor. So far all the films I've seen him in, he has been excellent.  What a talented legend. He was in almost every scene and full of energy. Well, I've since seen other Andy Griffith movies and I think some are pretty bad but 5/5 stars for Onion Head, No Time for Sergeants and murder in Coweta County, and definitely The Andy Griffith Show. He's very talented but inconsistent. There was a noted change in his appearance in the later episodes, his face was swollen and his voice harsh from smokes and alcohol.  I would cut the series there also, 4 packs of smokes daily is excessive by any measure and when your appearance changes from the alcohol, that's excessive. There must have been other complications, but we appreciate his efforts.",1497744000,,808,4.643356643356643

293545,5,6300273210,"This 1957 film was a breakthrough for the then-young and upcoming star, Andy Griffith. If you know him only from his days in Mayberry, you owe it to yourself to see him in a dramatic performance that is fascinating to watch. Also, there are cameo appearances by many Hollywood A-listers. Patricia Neal and a very young Lee Remick turn in top notch roles, as well.",1496448000,,363,4.6
293546,5,6300273210,"4.5 stars, a really great film with astounding relevance to today's political and media climate. Very prescient. Who would have guessed that such megalomania could be a reality in a real politician (Trump) today. And, the concepts that the masses are idiots, it is just necessary to fool them into loving ""me"" in order to control their minds, TV can be used to sell and create a personality (and it can be whatever you want it to be). It is all exaggerated in this film, but is it, really? Required viewing in the era of Trump.

Andy Griffith was phenomenal in this role. That boy could act!",1496188800,,591,4.5233644859813085
293547,4,6300273210,"Excellent.  I know the director was a rat for the HUAC but damn, he was a great director.  And, he's dead now so don't worry.  See this film for the extraordinary insights the story and characters offer to phenomena like Trump and O'Reilly and the rabble rousing.  Great performances.  Patricia Neal in a true star turn.",1494720000,,320,4.642857142857143

293574,5,6300273210,"I loved it because it is true.  People manipulate others all of the time while they hide the truth of who they really are.  I read a quote yesterday that applies.  ""Sometimes grass is greener on the other side because it is fake!""  I had no idea that Andy Griffith could ever portray such a compelling character.",1487376000,6,312,4.421052631578948

293603,5,6300273210,I think this film was ahead of it's time. A joy to watch!,1485129600,,57,3.4615384615384617
293604,5,6300273210,"It's likely that most of America has an Andy Griffith resume that looks like this: Andy Taylor -> Ben Matlock -> 2008 presidential endorsement of Barack Obama. Or, perhaps: Will Stockdale -> Andy Taylor -> Ben Matlock. If that's the extent of it -- if Lonesome Rhodes isn't in your mix -- you have a remarkably incomplete understanding of Andy Griffith's range as an actor, and you need to get up to speed.

This movie is enduring testament to that range Andy Griffith. Bumpkin [flip switch], charmer [flip switch], entertainer [flip switch], megalomaniac [flip switch]. It's a fascinating transformation. An eon ahead of it's time...treads delicately along the edge of audience acceptability/morality standards for 1957.

And yes, Trump...it's become known as something of an accidental Trump bio-pic. But are we not so damned weary of that man wedging himself into every facet of our lives? So if you're intrigued by the Trump connection, fine, watch the movie. But your primary reason for watching should be Griffith's performance (as well as Patricia Neal and Walter Matthau).",1485129600,,1080,5.1657142857142855

Andy Griffith in a dramatic role, Patricia Neal--who ironically also starred in the film version of Ayn Rand's ""The Fountainhead""--, and a young Walter Matthau.

293633,5,6300273210,"I never get tired of this movie. Andy Griffith proves that he was a passionate and powerful actor and not just a TV personality. A great supporting cast, too. You see the benefits of the method acting that was being taught in New York at the actor's studio and elsewhere-- realistic and intellectual work.
Maybe it seems a bit heavy-handed, but it is a fable, folks-- note meant to be a realistic narrative-- and the oldest story there is about how a charming sociopath with a big mouth can do just about anything in today's world. Wow. Did they make this that long ago? Seems kind of like now. Watch this, now.",1480291200,,611,4.464285714285714

293666,5,6300273210,This movie has every aspect of the fallen nature of man and seeking redemption since Adam and Eve; and as result the movie for me has become a teaching tool.  I play the movie for my students at Church and allow them to dissect each characters behavior and how it sheds light on the beauty of God Wisdom on how to avoid pitfalls and/or the destructive consequences  of your choices. The movie was made in 1957; but my students always come the realization the moral struggles are the same yesterday and today. And they recognize how the media is used to sway the masses then and now.  Hollywood some times produces a GEM which is correct and real. And this is one of those movies.

I had never seen this movie before although I was in high school when it was released, but chose it on friend's recommendation  since it seemed in tune with the 2016 presidential campaign.

293790,5,6300273210,"Any who thinks that the current war-circus of hucksterism in politics, advertising, hell, just in interpersonal social network communications  started this year or last should take a serious cinematic look at the granddaddy of critiques of modern media, Elia Kazans A Face In The Crowd  to see that is simply not true. (I have already made my point about Mister Kazans lack of spine when the deal went down about his role as snitch during the red scare Cold War night acre elsewhere so this review is about the considerable artistic creative aspects of his career of which this film is something of a defining masterpiece.) The power of in its time, radio, television and now the Internet to form opinion, to push somebodys agenda, to get people to buy something from candidates for office to sunglasses and laundry detergent gets a full workout here in the golden age of black and white television, the medium many of us older reviewers cut our teeth on.

Heres the beauty of this one as a cinematic statement in contrast to say the whiplash rise of a Willie Stark in Robert Penn Warrens All The Kings Men or the film Network which also dealt with the power of mass communications to shape everyday life and to throw up characters who were willing to grab the brass ring when it was thrown at them. There is always something to being in the right place when that ring is thrown and that was the case of the central character known to his public as Lonesome Rhodes, played by Andy Griffith in a memorable performance and far removed from his silly role as the high sheriff of Mayberry. Old Lonesome was nothing but a good old boy grifter, a rolling stone, a neer do well sitting in some Podunk Arkansas jail for drunkenness and vagrancy when Marsha, played by Patricia Neal, the daughter of a local radio station owner who was trying to spice up the stations programing with some authentic Americana and thought the local jail might produce some colorful characters.

And that was the start of the Lonesome Rhodes trip to heaven, to the top of the ratings in both radio and television in succession. Old Lonesome had that something that the average listener could relate to in his faux homespun manner and that ability carried him to the top in short order. He could have cared less about playing high-brow to the elites or to use the mass media to educate. His genius lay in being a born hustler, a hustler of whatever had to be hustled. What Lonesome knew as he rose up the food chain was that all he had to figure out was what would sell to the rubes out there who wanted, well, wanted something, wanted entertainment anyway. He gave them that with a combination of folksy bologna, a cracker barrel general store style and a bit of strumming on the guitar. Yeah, as he said in a moment of candor at the end, the end of his run he had them eating out of his hand.

Needless to say a high-brow film based totally on a hucksters rise and all would be a flop if there wasn't a counterbalance, wasn't somebody to rein in old Lonesomes excesses. Tone him down a little, give him some semblance of style. That, of course, was woven into the film by the tensions between Lonesome and Marsha over his future, especially when he later began to believe half the stuff that was being said about him. Began to get too big for his britches. That match-up also produced the serious love interest, mostly on Marshas side, but at key points his as well, that created as much chaos in their lives as any sense of gaining happiness from Lonesomes success.

Something would have to give and it eventually did when after hustling pills for a right-wing ex-generals Big Pharma company Lonesome began to keep some pretty unsavory political company (although not maybe so unsavory in the 1950s when the post-World War II red scare and golden age of the American way created by a big stretch of prosperity which belonged to the victors in that war produced a lot of characters ready to ditch the gains of the New and Fair Deals). Poor old Lonesome began got so hopped up on his success that he began to think that he could sell lackluster political candidates to the public, his average American public ready to jump at anything he had to say, just like selling high energy pills.
Heres the funny part as his audience grew he became more contemptuous of the hand that feed him. That con mans contempt along with treating Marsha lie a dishrag at the wrong times, like the time when he said he would marry her and then went and grabbed a teenage bride would lead to his undoing.  Between the woman scorned and her felt need to curb Lonesomes excesses Marsha pulled the plug, brought him down in the long gone age of live television the easiest way possible. Let the home audience hear what he really thought of them once the sound was supposed to be off after the show was over. Yeah she pulled the switch and he was broken, utterly broken, thereafter.

I wonder though whether today old Lonesome in the age of realty television and in your face characters who have become celebrities based exclusively on applying that skill set wasn't just a man before his time, and that despite the contrived ending in this film he would have kept a great part of his audience. Think about that possibility and watch this classic from the golden age of black and white film.",1468540800,4,5337,4.552083333333333

I first saw this on television in the early 60s and was blown away by Andy Griffith's overwhelming performance as ""Lonesome Rhodes"". I was then in my early 20's. Fifty years later I am still blown away, not only by the fine performances of Griffith, Patricia Neal,Walter Matthau,Tony Franciosa and other supporting actors (each wonderful in their own way) but at the message of the film. The film predicted what was to become the American Body Politique; sadly, as is seen everyday on that not-so -little box, what was predictive has become reality and has gone far beyond what Elia Kazan and Budd Schulberg prophesied. Instead of the celebrity becoming the kingmaker, the equally vacuous Celebrity now wishes to be the King himself facing an opponent who appears while certainly more knowledgeable but to many voters, equally repugnant, and to paraphrase writer Arundati Roy, both brought to us ""by Proctor & Gamble"".
The nightmare has become reality and the folks who bring you ""Vita-jex"" in the film are the same ones who bring us our current crop of soap suds"" except neither gets the dirt out and neither is 99% pure.

293933,5,6300273210,"I don't give many 5 stars ratings, but I believe this one truly deserves it.  For some reason, it was never even nominated for an Academy Award and was not appreciated upon release for the superb direction by Elia Kazan, excellent screenplay by Bud Schulberg, terrific casting and top-notch performances and all-around example of great film making.  In more recent decades, people realized what a great film it was/is and it received the accolades it should have been given upon its release in 1957.  I never even watched the full-movie until recently.  Wow, what I missed!

Andy Griffith gave what must have been the performance of his lifetime. It's really hard to recognize Sheriff Andy Taylor of Mayberry in this film.  He plays an ego-centric super-jerk/alcoholic and could care less about those around him unless it benefits him in some way.  His character, ""Lonesome Rhodes,"" was a drifter/ hobo who has a way with home-spun singing/guitar playing and story-telling (a la Will Rogers) and ""telling it like it is"" and ""taking it to the people.""  Patricia Neal's character, journalist/promoter Marcia Jeffries discovers Lonesome in the jail drunk tank and makes him  famous on radio, live shows ""on the road"" and then Lonesome's own TV show.  The public and many powerful ""movers and shakers"" in business (to promote their products) and even in politics, just can't get enough of big 'ol grinning ""Lonesome."" But this guy has the scruples of a snake and treats people ""behind the scenes"" like a cruel dictator who's not only drunk on alcohol, but drunk on his power and influence.  He thinks he can do no wrong.

One day Marcia Jeffries (who had somewhat reluctantly fallen in-love with ""Lonesome"" and was ready to marry him, until...) has had enough of his deceit and manipulation and by a twist of fate, has an opportunity to unveil the real ""Lonesome Rhodes"" to the public.  It's high drama and Patricia Neal nails the scene.  If you appreciate great film making, you won't be sorry you spent 2 hours on this one.  And just to watch a a very young Lee Remick play Betty Lou Fleckum, a baton twirling contestant, who twirls the heck out of her baton and bats her eyes at ""Lonesome"" during a baton twirling competition he is judging, is such a kick.  Soon after they enter into a doomed marriage and things sour, Lonesome tells Betty Lou, (who's been having too much fun spending Lonesome's money) to pack up her things and go home and she pouts and pounces on the bed, just like a little girl having a tantrum crying: ""I doe' wanna go home!""  Betty's not too bright. A must see!",1455580800,8,2585,4.747203579418344

294015,4,6300273210,"A Face in the Crowd, 1957 film

It begins in a town square in Arkansas. A woman reporter visits the jail to record interviews with the prisoners. She talks to a sleepy drunk. Whats in it for him? Jack Rhodes will sing and play his guitar. A Free Man in the Morning is his song. Will he sing on the local radio station? [Note the dirt roads.] He does, and tells stories too. Lonesome Rhodes gets fan mail and attracts advertisers. Larry comes form all over. He talks about his youth. He suggests people should take their unwanted dogs to the jail. It affects them. A theatrical agent asks him to come to Memphis. Larry invites boys to jump into his employers swimming pool! He negotiates his pay, and a car too.

He is on television and strays from the script. He talks about big city life. Folks in trouble. He talks to a woman whose house burnt down and asks people to donate 50 cents to her; they do. He affects simplicity. Advertisers don't like the kidding about their products. [Remember Henry Morgan?] A man tells Larry about payments for mentioning commercial businesses. Isnt that illegal? Not if they don't catch you. Larry sings about the sponsor. Get me my lawyer says the sponsor. People demonstrate against the sponsor who fired him. New York city takes notice. Can he sell a product that is near worthless? Will changing its color help sales? His promotion on camera works well. Sales escalate. [A parody on advertising then.]

He is compared to Will Rogers. He will be made into a force for public opinion. He appears on the covers of LOOK and LIFE magazines. A flower is named after him. He appears on a show You Lived It. [A parody of This is Your Life]. He is lauded and given a penthouse apartment, but he is lonely. Millions of people follow him. Then a woman visits to as for $3,000 a month or she will expose him! They show a laugh machine that imitates a live audience. Larry says he will go to Mexico to finalize his divorce. Does his power make him dangerous? [To who?] He sings about baton twirling. Who will be the winner? Larry gets married in Juarez [validating his Mexican divorce]. His audience cheers Betty Lou, his bride. Fans rush the stage. [As will be seen with future rock bands.]

A long shot is used for the double who performs with flaming batons. Marcia is disappointed; she wants more than 10%. Walter Winchell talks about Larry. Mike Wallace interviews a Senator. He doesnt have popular appeal, he has to be repackaged. A dog will make him more popular, so too his facial expression. Larry influences public opinion. Senator Fuller spouts his slogans on TV. One man wrote a book to expose Larry. Marcia knows a lot about Larry. Larry orders Betty Lou back to Arkansas. Will Larry get a Cabinet position? He has high ratings. People follow him like sheep, he says. The show goes on. The family that prays together stays together. Marcia turns on the sound so Larrys comments go out over the air. His personality finally came through. Going down? Yes! There is a replacement for Larry on hand. His friends now reject him! Is he going through the roof? Marcia says it was me. Larry will be back again, but in a cheaper show. Or will he?

Special Feature

The idea of a wealthy man going into politics is the rule, not an exception, from the Rockefellers to Reagan to Lautenberg, they will become Governors or Senators. Would JFK have become a Senator without his fathers wealth? Look around for current examples today. There is an apology for Elia Kazans and Budd Schulbergs past political views. Who controls any political party? Arent they similar to a corporation? Does a Congressional Committee have an agenda? The political game is rigged against ordinary people unless they become attorneys for the wealthy. Lonesome Rhodes could be a prototype for Reagan: a smiling actor who attracts popular support. Who is the current equivalent? Could an evil man put on a nice face to gain popular support? Yes, its happened in the past and will reoccur. Does power lead to corruption? In most cases. It tells about the story of Uncle Don at the end.

Andy Griffith began his career as a stand-up comedian. This movie seems clumsy at times in telling its story. Was Reagan ambitious? Read Dark Victory by Dan Moldea for the history they won't tell you. What about those baton twirlers in their outfits?

This film, along with All the King's Men and Network provides a trilogy of American political and social ""You Bet"" candor that probably still prevails despite the morphing of ethnicity since the film was made.  An undercurrent of con runs through the American system enhanced today by mega jumps in electronic brain blasting from so many directions in media and self inflicted wounds of the constant chatter between hand held and other ""communication"" devices.  The story and ""screenplay are prophetic and honestly displayed.  I am surprised that such a ruthless and accurate rendering was given over for public display in its day.  The characters are all meshed well into a demonstration of what has always been going on but only since the 1970's perhaps openly admitted, accepted or marketed in the world of entertainment and day to day journalistic self satisfaction with its tools of ""we knew all along"" swagger.  Some people will look away, but those types will probably always shun the smell of what's otherwise camouflaged by the evening news.",1435622400,3,1178,5.046391752577319

I was impressed with his incredible acting skill, versatility, and singing ability as well.  This was an interesting movie -- a bit too long, perhaps.  Fascinatingly, though, you will HATE the Andy Griffith character.  That's okay, though.  You're supposed to hate him.

This movie was made in the early days of television, and it's interesting as a historical study.  The writer of the film seems to have a distrust of the power of television.  The Andy Griffith character was a drunken hobo with a guitar when he was discovered by a woman (played by a young Patricia Neill) who placed him on the radio.  His charm (obviously influenced by his con man father) makes him instantly popular enough with the radio audiences to draw him into television as well.  He quickly becomes so popular and influential that his power goes to his head, and the Patricia Neill character begins to discover that she has created a monster and released him onto an unsuspecting public.",1431302400,5,1058,4.8277777777777775

294139,4,6300273210,"This movie really burst Andy into  the Big Screen in a unique way that his work in NYC and Broadway could not. It has been said that Andy Griffith threw himself ""completely"" into this role with such rawness and abandon, that the dark depths of this character scoured his soul in such a way, that he told his family that he would never do a role like that ""Lonesome Rhodes"" Character...ever again. To channel all that negative energy and raw emotion into this character was obviously something Andy never wanted to experience ever again. He certainly wanted to stay with TV audiences for a long...long time.

Like most actor's he wanted/needed to be loved,and appreciated,and never one associated/type-casted as some hated, negative, mean-spirited character.

Lonesome Rhodes....just ""oozes of grit and booze"". Andy never accepted another role of this caliber. He really never wanted to be type cast in this way. However, he went on to endear himself to millions on ""The Andy Griffith Show"" a gracious and kindly peace officer surrounded by many memorable characters.  Much later in his life...he returned as Mattlock-- the folksy, but wise fellow, appreciated by all, but that pales by comparison to Andy Taylor and his crowd. That still strikes a deep cord in the heartstrings across America. Hollywood and New York cannot quite capture that type of sitcom. Could be too much of Hollywood and Reality TV real life directors and TV stars are more like Lonesome.

His character in ""A Face In The Crowd,"" may even remind you of some of these slimy ""flash in the pan"" representatives selling their wares on the Cable Channel, or some of the slick politicians up in Washington, D.C. on Capital Hill, or perhaps even some of those Prosperity Preaching TV people.

294216,1,6300273210,"I would not recommend this movie.
We love the Andy Griffith Show and all of the characters from Mayberry! It is a ""good"" wholesome family show that we can watch without the worry of improper innuendos and suggestive comments that you get with so many other shows! So when we saw that there were other movies that Andy Griffith played in, we were very excited and ordered several of them. I guess we just had the perception that Andy Griffith would have the same values and similar characteristics in all of his movies as he did in his role as Andy Taylor. However, we were disappointed when we found out that he plays roles of people with quite different characteristics in other movies. The roles that he plays in other movies includes characteristics of self-centeredness, pride, arrogance, loud-mouthed, vagrant and a rebel. All of these are basically quite the opposite characteristics of the image that we had developed of Andy Griffith.
In this movie Andy Griffith starts out as person in jail that a reporter wants to interview. She was impressed with his straight forwardness and saying what he felt that she got him a spot of his own on her radio station. He ends up getting very popular. Throughout the whole movie he is a loud-mouthed, egotistical person that is very conceited and stuck on himself. More than once, it is obvious that he was having an affair with someone and ends up having an affair with the lady that initially got him the job. Supposedly they are going to get married but then on a road trip he eyes a 17 year old girl and marries her. I ended up just shutting the movie off because I didn't care for this type of personality. This was the first one of the movies that I ordered that I watched. It really shocked me because of the impression I had of Andy Griffith as Sheriff Taylor and this was a complete opposite characteristic. I would not recommend it to anyone. Not only because of the role he played but also because I just don't care for this type of movie.

If this was all I knew of his acting I wouldn't have liked him at all. He has no redeeming graces here. And he makes me forget the years of ""knowing"" him as the dependable Andy Taylor of Mayberry or the crotchety, but loveable Matlock.
The plot itself is a bit dated, but then again, the movie is a slice of life from over a half a century ago.
Come to think of it, it is relevant now as it's like the 208 Republican nomination process, with all the frauds that paraded across the stage then, too. Politicians pretending to be just plain folks and seeming to believe we'll believe whatever they blather at us. 9-9-9 anyone?

294303,4,6300273210,"I first heard about ""A Face in the Crowd"" after reading Andy Griffith's obituary in the Raleigh News and Observer.  The obituary discussed his performance in the film and how it was so far away from the character of Sheriff Andy Taylor. Growing up in North Carolina Andy Griffith is a legend and is only overshadowed by the myth of Andy Taylor.  The Andy Griffith show was the only work of his I had ever really seen and knew about. To me along with a majority of fans, Andy Griffith was Andy Taylor.  This image was shattered after watching ""A Face in the Crowd"". Now, this wasn't a horrible thing, it was a wonderful thing, it add a depth to Mr. Griffith which I had never known. His performance as Lonesome Rhodes was so raw and emotional, nothing like his later work or his TV show.  The character changes from a self-centered drunk to a self-centered celebrity. Even though the character is despicable Griffith plays him with so much charm it's amazing, at times you feel bad for hating the guy.  It's a shame that he never received a nomination for this film or let alone the Best Actor award. The other driving force in the film is Patricia Neal who holds her own against Griffith.  Her role progresses through the entire film and her role seems like a prequel to the character she ends up playing in ""Hud"".  The film also has some hints of ""Network"" and I got the feeling that Paul Newman and George Kennedy based their performances in ""Cool Hand Luke"" off of Griffith.  The film foretells the impact of television on politics, however, the power of the media over peoples is overstated when looking at the present day.  While there are some people that are worshiped in the media, I find it hard to believe they can influence people so easily.  But I may be viewed as optimistic when it comes to thinking that people are not mindless sheep.  Overall, the story line is compelling and comes off as a satire in today's timeline but the performances make this film memorable. Griffith plays a role that is groundbreaking and should be witnessed by any Griffith fan.",1362355200,2,2071,4.555256064690027

A Face in the Crowd qualifies in spades.  If you look up the accolades of this film you will find no Academy Award nominations in any category.  Upon finishing the 152 minutes of sheer genius contained herein you will ask yourself why.

Impeccably cast and acted and fearless in its depiction of public manipulation and the destructive path of fame, this movie hits the same significant notes that Network would less than 20 years later (only without the satirical intentions).

Like the now 25+ year old Network, the amazing thing about this 50+ year old movie is that the core concept and message of this movie remains intact as we public ignore the obvious and fall for the same old tricks over and over and over.

Therefore, among all the engaging parts of this classic Kazan film, it is Walter Matthau's perfectly delivered ending monologue which remains the most poignant scene of this timeless triumph in film making.

I had grown accustomed to the 'Andy from Mayberry' and, therefore, could not envision his plausible portrayal of a hard drinking drifter. Wow, I was blown away. Griffith pairs well with Paticia Neal in a rags to riches tale depicting a talented man haunted by his own insecurities and image.

This movie is for any Griffith fan who wants to see his full acting capability and a very different face.  The movie storyline held my attention and provided a splash of history and culture from the late 1950's, as well as showcasing TV's early power and influence on the masses.

The story doesn't end well for him.  However, the movie is not about Lonesome Rhodes, but the media and its damaging influence on the American people.  The shallowness, selfishness, and phoniness of all kinds of mass media is fully exposed in this movie, which is why I recommend it.  And it's shown in a way quite different from the Beatniks and 60s radicals who wanted to overthrow the system.  This movie is much more realistic and has no sexual revolution in mind, and pessimistically recognizes at the end that the destructive influence of television is here to stay.  There's a statement rather late in the movie about how political campaigning must become a series of catch-phrases instead of coherent messages.

The movie is timeless because the unhealthy psychological impact of television is here to stay.  Television takes less mental involvement than radio because the images are so easy to focus on, and it revolutionized political campaigning and people's sense of community quite negatively.  People became defined by celebrities more than by communities, and became much less focused on content and much more focused on presentation.

The tale of a media personality who rises from drunken obscurity to become an unrivaled performer and salesman -- and potential political kingmaker -- this film's satire is expressed not only in its substance but its style, so much so that in an odd way comparing it to other films of its time is like contrasting Citizen Kane with its contemporaries. The cinematographic is marvelous, the direction outstanding, and one can't say enough about the performances of its two co-stars, Andy Griffith and Patricia Neal. Think Heath Ledger put his stamp on the Joker? Try contemplating what Griffith did with Lonesome Rhodes. Neal, meanwhile, provides an incredible performance both quiet and intense, the perfect counterpoint to Griffith's outsized character. The satire is well-focused and razor-sharp, and prescient on a mind-blowing level. So why did I use the phrase ""very bad"" at the beginning, and why do I give this only three stars? Essentially because, for all the wonderful satire that was ahead of its time, for all of its wonderful technical excellence and despite the wonderful acting by Griffith and Neal -- and everyone else, for that matter -- the screenplay stinks in two or three glaring ways. First, the combination of satire and seriousness don't mix. They pretty much never do. The excesses of the parodies loosen the viewer's sense of reality so much that it's very hard to swing back into sober mood and feel the wrenching agony that is expressed in the relationship between Neal and Griffith. Then again, Rhodes' rise to power is too easy and pat, once more undermining the sense of reality that is a necessary bedrock for any serious emotional reaction by the audience. And, at least in my opinion, Rhodes' two-faced quality is always displayed more or less in the same limited way, with repetition piled on repetition, making the film even more simplistic. Still, all those positive aspects make me think of A Face in the Crowd as being not half empty but half full, though that may actually be half full of itself.",1355443200,3,2253,4.8545454545454545

I read one review saying that Lonesome Rhodes was evil, but I don't agree. I think what happened to Lonesome is extremely common. His stardom gave him money and power.

294464,5,6300273210,"(This is my second review. It seems that my first review ""disappeared"" into the Twilight Zone.) I first saw this movie in a theater in 1957, when I was 12 years old. Regardless of my tender age, I was mesmerized and dumbstruck by its sheer power, its acting, directing - and, most importantly, its prescience about the power of the then-new medium, television, to dramatically (often adversely) affect public opinion. As soon as this movie became available in VHS format, I purchased it from Amazon and continue to watch it whenever I have the intestinal fortitude (because it's a very dark movie) to do so.

Andy Griffith's acting talents are superb. This is NOT the Andy Griffith of the sitcom in which he starred as the sheriff of Mayberry. Kazan's direction brought out the best in all the stars, including Lee Remick, in her first acting role, and Walter Matthau, playing the level-headed friend of Patricia Neal's character. It's a painful movie, as it shows the rise of a drunken yokel (""Lonesome Rhodes"") to TV and radio stardom -- to the point that he influences political decisions and socializes with the elite -- and his tragic fall when his manager and spurned lover, played by Patricia Neal, leaves the microphone open as the credits for his TV show are rolling and he, thinking that the microphone is off, expresses his real opinions about his followers, who finally see and hear the ""man behind the mask"" and the utter contempt with which he views them. This not-to-be-missed movie is actually something of a morality play about a nonentity whose hubris, fed by his followers' devotion, eventually leads to his descent into a hellish reality of his own making.",1348358400,,1676,4.839721254355401

294518,5,6300273210,"This movie is more of a five-star experience than a five-star film.  As far as movies go, it's close to masterpiece level despite minor flaws, earning considerable merit in its own right.  But for people like me, who have spent years watching The Andy Griffith Show and Matlock, the experience of seeing Andy play villainous anti-hero Lonesome Rhodes is a powerful one.

Griffith's performance in this movie seethes with an array of negative emotions and qualities; rage, anxiety, fear, arrogance, and greed.  His character feels authentically dangerous and unpredictable.  Many scenes are quite unsettling given his persona as a down-home role model, and are that much more entrancing because of it.

In the film, Larry ""Lonesome"" Rhodes is a true-to-life folk hero, discovered in jail by a young girl named Marsha who's fresh out of college and hosting a radio program.  As he gains fame for his singing and outlandish image, his initially enigmatic and elusive personality rears its ugly head in increasing prominence.  The acquisition of widespread influence allows his selfishness to truly flourish, and he looks for more and more ways to boost his power.

Before his downfall, Rhodes begins using his popularity to build political clout.  In a frantic rant, he reveals his eventual plans of being right-hand man to the President himself in a new Cabinet position created solely for him.  Marsha, who elevated him from obscurity, exposes him to a live TV audience, in effect destroying his public image and the monster she had created.

On his journey from rags to riches to madness, Griffith displays acting chops few are aware even to this day that he possessed.  His wild laugh and impulsive behavior keep the audience constantly jumpy, always wondering if he will veer out of control.  His angry scenes are frightening, exemplified by his tortured bellows commanding Marsha not to leave him.  And his singing is shockingly intense, far more edgy and dark than anything he ever performed on his sitcom or albums.  It's truly mesmerizing.

Aside from the superb acting, director Elia Kazan made an important statement with this film.  After testifying about his communist affiliations before the House Un-American Activities Committee, he began to ponder the dangers of allowing movies and TV to influence politics and spread propagandist messages.  He correctly predicted that it would lead to politicians becoming brands sold to the public no differently from the products advertised during Lonesome Rhodes's broadcasts.

In fact, Rhodes himself can be seen as a symbol of communism.  He first gains the confidence of the masses through revolutionary new ways of doing things, then becomes consumed by the greed bred by absolute power.  As discussed in the excellent documentary in the DVD special features, Griffith never took another role quite like this one, as he and others on the cast and crew acknowledge that it affected his own personality, making him in Griffith's own words ""not a very nice man.""  A Face in the Crowd is one of those movies that needs to be seen to be believed and understood.  It's a unique, complex, and fascinating piece of film history.",1342742400,5,3177,5.100580270793037
294519,5,6300273210,"Andy Griffith's first starring role may have been the best performance he ever gave -- and he never played a character like Larry ""Lonesome"" Rhodes again.

This is an absolutely riveting film, the story of a drunken, foot-loose ne'er-do-well who catches lightning in a bottle when a local radio reporter records an interview with him, waking him up while he's ""sleepin' one off"" in the local Arkansas jail. Larry Rhodes -- christened ""Lonesome Rhodes"" on the spot by the reporter, played expertly by Patricia Neal -- shows that his let-it-all-hang-out, anarchistic monologue style translates well to radio, then television, bringing him literally millions of goo-goo-eyed followers -- mostly women of the working class. Lonesome Rhodes becomes a national star, then an advisor of high-ranking political candidates.

But then Patricia Neal, who has fallen in love with this brash, iconoclastic knight of the road, is done dirty by him when he marries someone else -- someone much, much younger. In the end, it is a species of retaliation by Neal that brings Lonesome Rhodes back to earth with a resounding crash.

The other actors in this drama are merely backdrops for Andy Griffith and, to a much lesser extent, Patricia Neal. Griffith plays a character who is at once charismatic with a capital ""C,"" with a wonderfully rubber face which expresses every emotion; and also is, in quieter moments, a dark, brooding man with an uncaring, evil side. He inhabits the character of Lonesome Rhodes in such a way that one can hardly tear one's gaze away from him when he is in one of his stream-of-consciousness, ""I'm just one of y'all"" rants. There are scenes where Neal watches him, awestruck and wide-eyed. And the women and girls especially in his audiences scream and squirm at the sight and sound of him, a la the early followers of Elvis Presley. Remember, Elvis' first year of big-time success was 1956, the year before this film was released. Did Budd Schulberg borrow elements of the Presley story? Possibly, although I've never heard a professional film critic suggest that.

For all the unpleasant aspects of Lonesome Rhodes as a man, there are still reasons one must grudgingly admire him. He will not allow himself to be ""talked down to,"" or kowtow or tug his forelock to his ""betters."" For instance, when Neal and her wealthy uncle, owner of the radio station, pick him up while he is trying to thumb a ride out of town, guitar case in hand, the uncle says in patrician tones, ""Get in the back."" Rhodes throws his guitar in through the open back window, jerks the front passenger door open, and pushes Neal over so he can sit in the front -- ""with the White folks,"" one might have said ironically in those pre-racial self-consciousness days.

Earlier, when the sheriff of the town tells Larry Rhodes that he can get out of jail early if he'll agree to the recorded interview with Neal, Rhodes looks him straight in the face and says, ""Well, sheriff, you've sorta got the name of not keeping your promises."" Lonesome Rhodes may be a demagogue in embryo, but he won't back off or flinch in the face of authority.

If you've never seen ""A Face in the Crowd,"" if your only memory of Andy Griffith is as Andy of Mayberry, or in ""No Time for Sergeants,"" or as ""Matlock"" on TV, then you've missed the amazing depths of this actor. By all means, this drama is well worth viewing.",1342656000,3,3379,4.7675213675213675
294520,5,6300273210,"What a prescient and memorable film about the power of television and the ability of a demagogue to capture the imagination and hearts and minds of the public and to rise to unprecedented heights.

It is now common knowledge that at the time of this film's commercial release in 1957, it did not generate any significant box office results. The subject matter was jarring and abrasive and neither Griffith or Patricia Neal had a large enough following at that time to attract a large audience for the film. However, with the passage of time, the stature of this Elia Kazan film has grown substantially. Additionally, it has maintained a larger audience through frequent showings on Turner Classic Movies.

It is simply unfathomable that Griffith was not nominated for and did not win the Best Actor Academy Award for his monumental performance, which has strong elements of humor, drama, and pathos. Moreover, the performance by Patricia Neal was arguably superior to her work in Martin Ritt's ""Hud"" for which she ultimately won the Best Actress prize in 1963. Her work was more nuanced and powerful than in the latter film. If the ""Lonesome Rhodes"" character portrayed by Griffith does not remind the viewer of elements of Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck, then I have miscalculated. At the time that Budd Schulberg wrote his marvelous screenplay, it was purportedly based to a large degree on the career rise of Arthur Godfrey, whose homespun wisdom and humor paralleled that of Griffith's character. The Oscar was won that year by Yul Brynner for his performance as the King Of Siam in The King And I, and while I do not intend to denegrate his award caliber work, Griffith's intuitive and incisive portrayal must be acknowledged as one of the most memorable of the decade of the 1950's.",1342656000,3,1786,4.891089108910891

Patricia Neal is no push-over either and she is every bit Griffith's match in this film.

Thus, the reissue of the film had to sate its admirers, even if, it may not wholly win over as many new fans as its champions wish for. Still, A Face In The Crowd is worth seeing, less for any technical or artistic achievement, and more for its prescient place as a predictor of the power of television's role in the decline of intelligent discourse in American society. It may have been too preachy and smug a film to be great, and it certainly has not dated well in many aspects outside of its predictive power, but, no one can deny that, in the main, it was absolutely right about where this nation was headed.

Rhodes is given a slot on local radio and his folksy, irreverent humor is so popular he's soon invited to host a Memphis television program.

Rhodes' conservative sponsor soon has him playing kingmaker by stumping for right-wing Senator Fuller for President. Staff writer, Mel Miller (Walter Matthau), attempts to turn Marcia against Rhodes but she's already souring on her discovery. When Rhodes contemptuously berates viewers during closing credits of a show, Marcia manipulates the sound board, purposely broadcasting his insults. His audience and sponsors abandon Rhodes overnight. When no one shows up at his gathering for conservative politicians and corporate big shots, Rhodes calls Marcia threatening suicide. She goes to Rhodes' penthouse to reveal she was the one who betrayed him. The movie ends with Rhodes screaming for Marica as she rides away in a taxi.

Kazan filmed the opening scenes of A Face in the Crowd in Piggott, Arkansas. Like in most of his films many non-actor locals were used. The house with the swimming pool is the Pfeiffer House, the home of businessman Paul Pfeiffer whose daughter was the second wife of Ernest Hemingway. Andy Griffith is a hoot in his film debut. Patricia Neal gives a great performance. The film did poor box office, which is understandable given the protagonist is a monster. There's no doubt the movie was ahead of its time as Bud Schulberg's script eerily foretold the role of television in politics. Sources reveal the character of Rhodes was inspired in part by Arthur Godfrey and Will Rogers.

A Face in the Crowd has some wonderful scenes and some great performances but it's not a five-star movie. Schulberg and Kazan over-reached the mark with this undisguised left-wing, preachy, soapbox. One gets the feeling that with A Face in the Crowd, Schulberg and Kazan were saying, Sure, we may have named names before HUAC but see, we're still good liberals!

This DVD includes no commentary but there is an interesting documentary, Facing the Past (2005), featuring interviews with Schulberg, Neal, and Griffith.",1319328000,,2732,5.158013544018059
294587,4,6300273210,"This film could have very well been one of the all time great movies with its concept, script and powerful performance by a young Andy Griffith... unfortunately it sways between brilliance & B-movie schlock... with some scenes seemingly rushed through, others powerful and provocative.

Overall it is a film of a Country Bad Boy who's discovered and who's down home honesty and charisma launches him to power and stardom, but the characteristics that make him so appealing also lead him to become greedy, hypocritical and destructive... even to those who believe in him.

Griffith's over the top acting carries the film... and Marcia Jeffries plays his tragic discoverer and enabler and evolves (slightly unconvincingly) from a wise and ambitious country gal to ""sadder but wiser"" woman of the world...  The choppy production of the film; however, betrays some what could have been award winning acting -- ending powerful scenes at times with a B-movie like feel.  Many potentially great scenes are also betrayed, with Matthau's voice of reason character coming across as underwhelming.  -- The film also features a young Tony Franciosa -- unfortunately, Kazan's ""attention span"" seems focused mainly on Griffith and his own favorite moments and scenes.

The end result is a powerful film nonetheless, but one that like the Lonesome Rhodes character sabotages itself.
Ultimately, it is gripping and engaging, but falls short of its potential -- nevertheless, its a film that's hard not to get thoroughly into as well as to emotionally react to.

In retrospect, this seems like an example of a Hollywood Classic that in the right hands might very well deserve a remake... although who could be found to match Griffith's powerful performance... as well as Kazan's better directing moments???  Interesting as well, as the film relates to selling out one's own values, its interesting to watch the film, observe the ideals it propounds and consider Kazan's own controversial involvement as an embittered idealist and his involvement in the HUAC fiasco.",1315872000,,2048,5.222560975609756
294588,5,6300273210,"Whent his moive can out in 1957, it was not well recieved and essentially was a dud in the theaters. This is one of those rare films that once it ended its first run, it later took on a life of its own. The story is a simple one. A young (and pretty) woman, Marcia Jeffries (played by Patricia Neal) has her own radio show on her uncle's radio station called ""A Face in the Crowd"". She totes around a large open reel tape recorder to interview people on the street. The movie begins with her going to the city's jail to see what she can get there. On the floor in a corner is a drunkard with a guitar sleeping it off (played by Andy Griffith). When she asks for him to sing a song, he asks ""What's in it for me?"". The sheriff tells him if he sings for the little lady, he'll let him out early. When he agrees, the lady introduces him as ""Lonesome Rhodes"" and he then begins to tell a tale as he stums his guitar. When she plays the tape on her show, Lonesome Rhodes becomes an overnight sensation and they run to find him, now released, to get him to agree to continue to appear on the radio, now on his own show.

Rhodes popularity conitnues to skyrocket and soon, he and Marcia are soon on the road to fame and fortune. Rhodes is the star with Marcia in the shadows as not only his producer and his love interest. She is excited by him and at the same time, she sees his darker side, which is frightening to her. By the time he gets a nationally-broadcast TV show, he meets up with one of his sponsors that is simply called ""The General"" He takes Rhodes under his wing and teaches him that through his charisma, he has the power to control people via TV and Radio. He can tell them what to think and what to do, including how to vote for the General's choice to be President. Lonesome Rhodes has gone from a simple self-minded drunkard into a powerful king maker with delusions of his own grandeur. He must be destroyed and only Marcia has the power to bring him down.

The film is one of the first tales about the power of radio and TV and how it can be used for good or bad. While the movie may not have seemed relevent to the movie-goers of 1957, it certainly resonates today. While Patricia Neal was a star when this film was made, it was the first film ever made by Andy Griffith and it is a powerful film that truly deserved consideration for an Academy Award. The role is totally opposite of virtually anything else Griffith took on. It reminds of the contrast between Angela Landsbury role in ""The Manchurian Candidate"" as compared to her more soft and kindly roles in movies and TV in the later years of her career.

Lonesome Rhodes is one of the great all time tragic characters and its through the brilliant writing, directing, and acting that brings this fatefull character to life. This is a must-see essential film every film fan needs to see.",1309046400,,2859,4.271217712177122

The stunning, first-rate cast members (Griffith, Neal, Franciosa, Mattheau, Remick) give electrifying performances, spurred on by the genius of director Kazan. I was drawn to the film because of the constant media attention given to contemporary Fox News commentator Glenn Beck, to which the character of Lonesome Rhodes bears an uncanny resemblance as a demagogue and self-styled public opinion shaper. The cynical ending of the film is, sadly, all too true for today's world as much as it was when the film was made. The American public is easily misled by this kind of blowhard, know-nothing media star. Fortunately, as in the film, they occasionally wake up to the fact that they are being manipulated. The film thus makes a serious critique of American culture, media culture and the fragility of public discourse.

294656,1,6300273210,"Spare your self this ugly assault on the American South and by extension Americans generally. Andy Griffiths plays the cardboard character of a drunken trickster discovered in an Arkansas jail by Patricia Neal, a small-town reporter for a local radio station. Oh, of course his belligerent ""I'll do it my way"", corn-fed folksiness just has to create an instant radio and then television sensation. Ya see, that's because Americans are easily manipulated morons who need East Coast cynics to tell us what to think...and how to vote.

Promoted and fostered by Neal (who does a stellar job in the only role that isn't a one-dimensional caricature of some type imagined by Elia Kazan), Griffiths sure shows those college-educated big-wigs running the companies who sponsor him a thing or two! And then he has a senator's staff eating out of his hand! All of his meteoric success is made possible by the gullibility of ""the ordinary mind-of the ordinary man"". The movie actually has some Arkansas small-town cheerleaders describing themselves as "" Bible-readin', pork-chop eatin'.."", surely a most horrible state of darkness! We are just waiting for the wise-cracking, Northeast Corridor gag-writer, played by Walter Matthau, the hero, to save Neal, and us, from Griffiths' demagoguery. I won't spoil it by revealing the tedious ending, which I was foolish enough to watch. But perhaps you can imagine it.

Griffiths is singularly repulsive in his role, wild-eyed and porcine. Neal is radiant and fragile in hers, but oddly refined considering her ""Bible-readin' pork-chop eatin'"" origins. It's hard to understand how she could fall so hard for Griffiths, because he doesn't manage an animal attractiveness, only brute selfishness. Chalk that one up as a loose end on the part of the director. Matthau looks like he's having a problem delivering his final soliloquy with a straight face. Chalk that one up as the only comic relief in the movie. It is surprising any of them would sign on to this tedious screed. Chalk that one up to the zeitgeist of the late 50's and the halcyon days of the civil rights movement, when Hollywood discovered it might be profitable to criticize Jim Crow. The ordinary black people in the movie are sympathetically drawn (unlike the treatment ordinary whites get). This is in contrast to the stereotyped roles in which Hollywood cast them throughout the forties, for example.

It's hard to call to mind a more contemptuous portrayal of American culture. This is clearly a case of the Hollywood dog biting the hand that feeds it. There are criticisms one could make of this country, but when the vehicle is as malicious as this movie, one tends to discount them. A good one to leave off the Netflix queue.",1283731200,14,2730,4.995604395604396
294657,5,6300273210,"To paraphrase George Santayana, those who do not know history are doomed to repeat it. Today we live in an age of talking heads spouting demagoguery, stirring pots of ugly emotions, half-digested historical inaccuracies, and not-so-hidden agendas, to a population too lazy to read or know their own history. They, like Andy Griffin in this Elia Kazan movie about the early days of television with folksy ""jes folks"" pundits, are selling a new age version of snake oil.

Andy Griffin turns in a jaw dropping performance for people who only know him as Sheriff Andy or Matlock. His good ole boy charm gets progressively meaner, and it's clear he's on a mission - money and power. Politicos court him. He's willing to be courted.

The late Patricia Neal turns in an equally gripping performance as the media publicists who unleashes the genie from the bottle, and sticks around to love this unloveable mess. She finally does what she knows needs to be done. Walter Matthau turns in a great character performance as the script writer for this illiterate bumpkin. He's scratching his head - what does she see in this bum? It's a very topical film for today's media. It's also a really good film.

Let me finish with George Santayana: ""History is a pack of lies about events that never happened told by people who weren't there.""

We see a depiction of how cynical the media is (and always has been).

The movie will let you know that the saying is true: ""It all happened before, and it will all happen again.""  We are incapable of remembering history, because so few of us even bother to look for the patterns.  To our great everlasting peril.

Andy Griffith is incredible in this film.  It's not over the top---as we can see the same script played out each day on cable TV and on radio.

As a side note, look up on Google Arthur Godfrey's early radio days on WJSV in Washington DC in the late 30's. The station, known on 1500 AM previously as WTOP, recorded an entire day, and you can hear Godfrey on the morning show, developing his style.  Of interest is this too:  WJSV was owned by the Ku Klux Klan, and was bought by CBS after CBS CEO William Paley discovered the Klan ownership and wanted to keep the station, but not under Klan ownership.  The station originally was licensed to NYC under the NY Klan but was removed from the air in NY and moved to the VA area of DC as WJSV.  I mention all this to illustrate that media has always been influential, from the start, and sometimes owned by the dark side--much like today.",1282780800,3,1416,4.325757575757576
294659,5,6300273210,"I had never heard of this film until my friend who is a journalist said I must see it. She couldn't have been more on the money. Released in 1957 and directed by the brilliant if controversial Elia Kazan, ""A Face in the Crowd"" has to be even more relevant today than then. Andy Griffith as Lonesome Rhodes, the country bumpkin spouter of cliches--""the family that prays together stays together"" is phenomenal. It is too bad that he never played this type character again but went on to be the folksy sheriff of Mayberry and later Matlock of network television. Patricia Neal as Marcia Jeffries, the woman behind Rhodes' ascension to stardom, comes off as she often does as a tough but vulnerable woman. Notice, by the way, how expressive her hands are. A very young Walter Matthau as the character who sees where Rhodes is heading is a great supporting actor as is Lee Remick, the woman Rhodes weds on an impulse after he has described baton twirling, which Remick does admirably, as ""an American art form.""

The movie is about the unholy alliance with television and politics. I saw characteristics of almost every political figure I can think of in this sobering must-see film: Rhodes has a mechanical applause maker for his television shows as he advises the senator who would be president to get rid of his quite obvious comb-over and to smile more.  In today's political climate, candidates routinely hand out signs for supporters who are in line of the television cameras to hold at rallies. And presidents have focus groups to see where they should vacation. Another president carries his own luggage while boarding Airforce One to appear as one of the people. And political candidates play to our basest emotions and repeat over and over lies and half-truths. They will do anything to get elected. The candidate with the squarest jaw often gets into office. Does anyone believe for a minute that if the ex-governor of Alaska weighed 200 pounds and was five feet tall that anyone would listen to her brayings? Sadly, if Lincoln with his homely looks were alive today, he would never be elected president. It is widely believed of course that Nixon lost the race for president because he could not compete on television with the handsome and charismatic John Kennedy.

However the fact that someone can understand other people's problems does not mean that this person is good hearted. In this movie Lonesome Rhodes was a megalomaniac and Marcia Jeffries(who has discovered him)was also the one who exposes Lonesome's real personality to the public. How? OK I will not tell you...for that you have to see the movie. Mel Miller's (Walter Matthau)last conversation with Lonesome is memorable and I hope you agree with me after you see the movie.

294661,3,6300273210,"In deep respect for the actress that we recently lost, my fingers are moved to review a film with which she shown as bright as she possibly could.  Yes, Patricia Neal was a beacon in her day, an actress who proved her worth time and time again and managed to create an image of greatness without ever becoming a solidified celebrity.  Despite her marvelous talent, Pat only received two Oscar nominations (thankfully she won for her BRILLIANT performance in `Hud').  Regardless of my feelings on this film in general (it's rather overblown and preposterous at times), Neal was flawless and really the films sole human element.  She deserved a nomination for sure (and at times I'm tempted to hand her the win).  I'm going to keep this short and sweet.  The film itself is overcooked.  It has some nice qualities, but in the end it pushes itself too far and becomes overtly melodramatic and unbelievable, which is sad since this film had all the potential to become a poignant and moving slice of realism.  It carries a weighty message (one that is beats us over the head as of late) with regards to the media and its influence (not to mention the power with which it destroys) but the way the script goes haywire in the films final hours only strips it of its soul.  Andy Griffith serves us something of a maniacal turn, which is so unlike him, with mixed results.  Walter Matthau is used to effective degrees, but he (and everyone else for that matter) is sidelined by the ferocity within Patricia Neal's performance.  She is just breathtakingly good.  The film is so far beneath her that it is startling to witness the depth with which she attempts to bring to the script.  She does it justice and actually hands the film it's only moments of validity.  Sadly, the film as a whole does not step up to her strength and it becomes bewilderment to me.  So, while I can't recommend this film on its execution and overall effect alone, I can say that Neal's performance drives it thoroughly and definitely deserves your attention.",1281398400,4,2027,4.654494382022472
294662,5,6300273210,"""A Face In The Crowd"" was filmed in mid-fifties Arkansas and in many ways is a primer for ""Mayberry RFD"".  Andy Griffith is featured in both this movie and in the beloved television series.  The actual site location for ""A Face In The Crowd"" is Piggott located in northeast Arkansas.  This movie utilizes a host of local Arkansans which typify mid-twentieth century rural Southerners living their lives in a small town setting.  Local live radio broadcasting was of immense importance during this period.  ""A Face In The Crowd"" delineates local radio broadcasting at its finest circa 1955 following intense on site research inside KDRS-AM Paragould, Arkansas.  This unique one of a kind radio station's essence is captured in this movie along with life in its community!  ""A Face In The Crowd"" is a must see for those who long for a more simple time when people were honest and life was uncomplicated.",1268870400,,901,4.8881578947368425
294663,5,6300273210,"Like the roar of a lion or the maniacal laugh of thousands, Andy Griffith burst on the screen with a performance unmatched in the past 53 years. Using the direction of the infamous Elia Kazan, and words by Budd Schulberg, ""A Face in the Crowd"" transformed from a personal struggle with fame into a political statement of power. Since the birth of radio and television, or even before, the concept of celebrity followed side by side. This select 1% of the population was used to sell ads, promote products, and lastly, entertain the populous. Not much has changed as Hollywood has evolved; the wealthy still control and the audience still depend on their favorite voice to tell them what to get at the grocery store. The interesting point about this, explored deeply in Schulberg's script, is how quickly the mass audiences can casual drop one figure and follow anew. As one reads this review, the teens may have forgotten the Jonas Brothers and found a new follower, our Late Night hosts may all have new faces, and our ""Avatar"" may not be barreling through the theaters. Even as I write this, it feels stale. Surprisingly, watching ""A Face in the Crowd"" for the first time, there was a lack of preparedness for these points. One doesn't expect such a modern film found in 1957 (much less lead by the sheriff of Mayberry), but within the first twenty minutes, the average viewer will be surprised by what the screen allows. With bold direction, amazing acting, and valid, detailed points about our entertainment industry, ""A Face in the Crowd"" makes its mark in 1957 and remains valuable today in 2010 - one could even argue MORE valuable today.

While watching this film, there is one person that steals the screen in the opening minutes and never releases for a solid two hours. His name is Andy Griffith, and while he will always be known as the quintessential small town hero, his film debut proved his range went further. With a diabolical laugh, a country-boy appeal, and a voice that could swoon anyone within an earshot, he takes what should have been a role for a seasoned veteran, and creates this iconic role that, after watching the film, could only be done by Mayberry himself. From his introduction in a cell recovering from a drunken disorderly charge, he finds his escape in the form of Patricial Neal, who in turn, introduces Griffith to the world of radio; aka mass audiences. Using a form of trickery, Neal demonstrates Griffith's power and the world welcomes him (unsuspectingly) with open arms. The small town of Arkansas does anything he wants, but he doesn't stop there. By becoming our very first Howard Stern, he does what he wants and says anything at all - and becomes the infamous ""Demigod in Denim"". The shift in Griffith's character is subtle, yet somewhat planned. He portrays Lonesome Rhodes as a man inheriting luck, but the calculated look on his face indicates otherwise. That is the perplexity of Griffith, one believes that it is just him being himself, but he peppers within his lines these moments of unknown - where perhaps this was Rhodes' plan all along. Bridled next to both Neal, who adds a strong level of support, sexuality, and madness, and a youthful Walter Matthau who brings the final worded-axe down at the finale; it doesn't surprised the ability and range that Griffith had to accomplish. The acting in this film will not only surprise, but also impress. This is the type of quality that Hollywood could produce, yet rarely do we see.

Having just finished ""Cabin in the Cotton"", a film that used politics as a miscalculation to cinema, it was impressive to see Elia Kazan handle this issue with artistic talent as well as solid direction. Despite his dismay in Hollywood, his talent behind the camera glimmered in this feature as colors (blacks and whites) were bold, the symbolism was apparent, and the emotions were captured perfectly. He guided Neal through her tragic turn, while keeping Matthau solid as a rock throughout. He controlled Griffith, while allowing him to run throughout the scenes with ease. ""Face in the Crowd"" is a difficult film to direct, as there is both emotion and intent running rampant, but Kazan proves the he can handle Schulberg's words. There are scenes that just feel, and look, more modern than 1957. The one that immediately pops into mind is the montage surrounding Rhodes' introduction into Vitajex. The blend of animation, perverse snippets, and that disturbing laugh didn't feel old - it felt like a moment taken from 2010 (just in black and white). There are others like that scene throughout. The baton competition was one of the most intensely awkward scenes, as we knew what was happening, but didn't want to believe it. Again, modern ideas strewn throughout 1957, where the average '57 film felt didn't push the envelope - Kazan didn't care about the envelope.

Finally, Schulberg's script has to be one of the best Hollywood stories to come out of that town. The images of Griffith laughing stapled behind several TV antennae, just barely scares the average viewer. Schulberg, like Kazan, isn't afraid of his idea. He pushes from radio to television, an audience of one to millions upon millions, and finally guiding politicians into office. Does this feel like an old idea? The modern implications are outstanding. The language as well, coming from Griffith (who had to ad-lib some) is wildly entertaining, but subtly symbolic, and those final thoughts by Matthau require another viewing just to hear again. Everyone, from writing to direction to acting, gave ""Face in the Crowd"" more than 100% of their talent, and this critic believes that Griffith may have fallen into the Mayberry sinkhole too soon. If this was his ability, he was surely wasted in Hollywood.

VIDEO: Impressive throughout. The scenes were well focused, detailed and developed. Characters became iconic, giving some of the best lines from a motion picture. Flawless.

VISUAL: Watched on regular DVD, this film would benefit from a Blu-upgrade. Even without, the visuals were stark, clear, and vibrant. The use of multi-media to tell this story seemed futuristic of sorts. This was an amazing film to experience, but a bold film to watch.

SOUND: This had to be top-notch for the film to work. When Griffith yelled, we heard him; when he played his music, we heard him; whenever he spoke - yep, we heard him. That is the staple of this film, hearing Griffith's words - and we did - so the sound was perfect.

EXTRAS: The only area lacking. A short documentary that talks to the cast about the film, but that was it. Why isn't there a Criterion release of this film - it seems like one of the best films in the last 50 years from America. It beats ""Network"" by a long shot. I would have liked to see more, experience this film more with stronger features - but it allows me to upgrade my disc down the road.

Overall, wildly impressive. This has to be one of my favorite films watched this year and easily in my life-long Top Ten. Performances were immaculate, the direction was charged, and the words sparked controversy within the group as we discussed after our viewing. The use of media, sex, and power to create a man known only as Mr. Mayberry demonstrated a talent that went unused in Hollywood. Griffith demonstrated amazing talent, and I don't know if I could ever see him in anything else the same again. Bravo across the board, BRAVO!

Anthony Franciosa.

Andy Griffith does a great job playing Lonesome Rhodes, a drifter who knows how to use a guitar and eventually learns to exploit his outgoing personality to persuade numbers of people to buy anything from commercial products to a political philosophy and eventually a presidential candidate. Once his handlers and agents get him on television the road to New York and national fame is made to seem a snap in this drama.  And once Lonesome Rhodes hits the big time jackpot, no one in his path is safe, including his manager/lover, Marcia Jeffries well played by Patricia Neal.

A FACE IN THE CROWD chronicles the rise and fall of a demagogue, nothing really
new only this one uses the then latest phase of electronic media, television.
At this time television was the new face in the family living room and was
usually an overly polite guest, not counting commercials. So to see what damaging effect our friendly electronic visitor could have not just on our buying habits but on our voting as well as our thinking patterns might have been shocking to those who pulled themselves away from the set to see this movie at the theater.

Of course eventually A FACE IN THE CROWD was shown on television amid commercials and station breaks, usually late at night, and it's doubtful this films impact was as shocking as it was originally intended.  In fact, as the movie unreels, it becomes a little
too shrill, implying what once was smartly satirical is now  shouting down at us from the highest penthouse balcony in New York City insisting that this story is  our future.

Of course we all know that it can't happen, the entertainers and commentators who are featured on our modern electronic media are sober and responsible broadcasters who would never use such baloney to make thier points and just plain outright lie to us.
After all, our election campaigns fill those needs efficiently and quite well.

So I rate A FACE IN THE CROWD a hearty four stars and recommend it despite a rather  shrieking  conclusion.
This DVD edition of A FACE IN THE CROWD includes a documentary about the film, the
theatrical trailer and subtitles in English, French and Spanish.",1261008000,4,2415,4.726190476190476

294728,5,6300273210,"""A Face in the Crowd"" is just as, or perhaps more, riveting today than when it was released to theaters in 1957.  The movie features a low-down scandroul and his meteoric rise to fame.  His popularity was more stumbled into than earned.  ""Lonesome"" Rhodes is not necessarily a smart man, but he was savvy enough to know how to climb the ladder and he knew he had the power to sway people.

""Lonesome"" Rhodes is a personality of low moral character, and yet people hang on every word he says.  Sound familiar?

This motion picture will make you think twice the next time the celebrity-of-the-week spouts off their political views.  Is an entertainer's perspective really any more valuable than someone who doesn't happen to play a guitar or have a nice smile?

Andy Griffith is literally stunning in this performance.  He never played this sort of character again and if you think of him as Andy Taylor of Mayberry you may do yourself a favor NOT to see this film.

""A Face in the Crowd"" is as, more of, relevant today than it was in 1957.",1260576000,2,1038,4.532258064516129

Andy Griffith, stars as ""Larry Lonesome Roads"" Who rises from a vagrant/drifter to a Political Public Relations expert which attempts to groom a senator for US President....How does this happen?  Lonesome Roads starts out as an entertainer at a local radio station and ends up in NY rubbing elbows with the Madison Avenue Titans. As he becomes connected with big business sponsors they recognize his potential as a manipulator of public opinion in politics. ""The General"" retains Lonesome roads to promote a Senator he is backing for President.

The director of this movie, Elia Kazan, was subpeoned to testify before Congress to inform on Celebrities which were Communist Party members. In order to save/promote his Hollywood career as a director he testified. Perhaps this gave him enough political space to direct a movie which was not very well received in its time.

The real fear amongst Wall Street/Big Business/National Security Interests was a political platform for alternative foreign/domestic policies. In a watered down Gestapo/Stalinist like fashion the US govt purged the State Department,Press, labor movement, entertainment industry etc., of dissenting opinions.",1259625600,3,1294,5.52020202020202

Considering that our own heretofore unknown President Obama has already plunged our nation into trillions of dollars of new debt in less than one year in office, the president is a fast learner.

294797,4,6300273210,"""A Face in the Crowd"" tells of the rise of ""Lonesome"" Rhodes (Andy Griffith), a man who is ""discovered"" in a jail cell and goes from town drunk to one of the most influential men in America, through the help of the media.

For a film that is over 50 years old, ""A Face in the Crowd"" has aged extremely well, largely because its message, that the media can create people who are more powerful and influential than politicians, is even more relevant today than it was when this film was made. While watching this film, I kept telling myself that none of this could possibly happen in real life and in 2009, but a quick glance through the newspaper made me realize how wrong I was.

""A Face in the Crowd"" was Andy Griffith's first film and made three years before ""The Andy Griffith Show"" started. The character of Lonesome is so unlike his ""Andy Griffith Show"" character that it is unlikely that he could have pulled it off, had people already come to know him as the lovable character that he later became typecast as. Nevertheless, Griffith is incredibly effective in this role and proves that he can actually act (and extremely well), something which I had had my doubts about until now.",1236816000,2,1188,4.52093023255814
294798,5,6300273210,"A classic film of betrayal, denial, and exposure in the political circus,
however, most of the storyline deals with a young likable man who comes
on the scene with an endearing gift for gab (could charm the panties off
of an old maid), envelopes the masses with promises of hope and change
and anything else they want to hear.  However, towards the end, Pat Neal
finally realizes that she and the people have been hood-winked, shot-thru-
the-grease, bam-boozled, and led astray, so she reluctantly exposes the
evil and heartless agenda of Mr Rhodes (end of story).  By the by, most
reviewers seem to have been surprised by the stark, menaceing performance
of Andy Griffith, but if they really want to see Andy at his meanest, then
check out the made for TV movie ""Pray For The Wildcats"" which starred Andy

Growing up in NC, The Andy Griffith show was something that you saw pretty much every day of your life. It was - and still is - always on. Always. So my expectations for this movie and Griffith's performance were based on that, Mattlock, and ""What It Was Was Football"" - anybody ever heard of that? Griffith's performance in this film absolutely blew me away. I'd been watching this man for over thirty years and had no idea he could act!

I feel so incredibly deprived that he did not do more of these parts in future movies. What an amazing talent! I hope he is at least given an honorary Oscar for this work. His portrayal of Lonesome Rhodes makes you fall completely in love with the character in the beginning, only to slowly have your heart torn out while he degenerates into total depravity.  About two thirds of the way through the movie, I felt physically sick to my stomach and almost turned it off, but was unable to, because like his onscreen love Marcia Jeffries, I couldn't bring myself to leave. Very few actors can achieve this sort of performance.  It should be required viewing for any aspiring actor.",1231632000,2,829,4.447368421052632

He is TREMENDOUS in this movie,just so over the top. He gets too big for his britches. His love interest, Patricia Neal, well sort of , sees he is becoming too much and decides to pull the plug n his career. Incredible film from start to finish.

294802,5,6300273210,"Andy Griffith, in his acting debut, certainly isn't the Andy Taylor we all love.  Here, he plays ""Lonesome"" Rhodes, a charming drifter that catches the eye and fancy of Patricia O'Neil.  She puts him on her radio station and he becomes a star.  His folksy ways and ""every man"" personality is played to the hilt, taking along O'Neil, his ever-growing audience, and even a presidential candidate in his masquerade.  Not too soon, ""Lonesome"" is revealed as what he is - not the Will Rogers that his public sees, but a power-mad snake oil salesman that is taking his followers with him.  The viewer sees the act, as O'Neil eventually does, too, but in the meantime, Rhodes is remaking the image of Senator Worthington Fuller to make him the next president of the United States.

If you love classic b&w cinema, morality tales, or politics, this will soon be one of your all-time favorites.

It should be required viewing for all political candidates, their staff personnel, volunteers, and in every Civics class in America.  The timeless message of people following a charismatic personality all the way to the Highest Office in the Land is as appropriate today as it was fifty years ago.

The first time you see Larry ""Lonesome"" Rhodes in this movie, he is snarling, angry, and ready to lash out. He spends the rest of the movie trying to keep that part of his persona hidden. It comes out, usually in front of Marcia (Patricia O'Neal). ""Aww, I was only kiddin' ""
She believes him. We, the viewers, know better.
He has a disdain for people, and only cares for himself. Yet when he smiles and goes into his ""Aw Shucks"" mode you forget how  evil he is.
I love the part where Paricia Neal says he was a hit on her radio show. He turns his head and spits.
His singing (Especially in the jail) is raw and sexual. Now, when I see Andy Taylor, I wonder how much he must despise Opie, or if he ridicules Aunt Bea when she is out of earshot.

He is definately worthy of all the adulation he gets from his TV work, but, I wonder how his career may have worked out if he passed on ""The Andy Griffith Show"" and stuck with movies.",1213747200,,1042,4.205

294858,5,6300273210,"Originally conceived as a warning of what was to come--the confluence of politics, business, and entertainment all through the sights and sounds of television--/A Face In The Crowd/ was originally brushed off by critics and viewers in the 1950s because ""it wasn't realistic"" (plus some Hollywood politics and reverse blacklisting probably didn't help).  Nowadays, this movie is heralded as being prophetic, and in the commentary the screenwriter talks about how he's stopped in the street and told how great this movie is because it describes how things are -now-.  The most backhanded compliment one can give to a prophet is to ignore him and then tell him he's right.

Andy Griffith is /excellent/ as a nihilistic conman looking for number one, perhaps too much so.  Mr. Griffith claims in his interview that he got far too deep into character, and that's probably why ever since he's played good old Mayberry sheriffs--he's essentially a good man who's seen what bad men are, and he's shied away from it.  I can respect him for that.  I'll just go on the record as saying that his performance here is so good, so visceral, so -real- that he would've had a hard time topping it as a dramatic actor, and indeed his later history as a 'welcome friend in the TV' only gives this movie just that much more power.",1213228800,,1310,4.774336283185841
294859,5,6300273210,"Once upon a time, oh, about 1957, in the far-off northeastern corner of Arkansas lived a princess, Marcia Jeffries, who has a radio show. She calls it ""A Face in the Crowd"" because she believes she can coax ""talent"" from anyone.

One day she goes to the county jail for that face which, it turns out, belongs to Larry Rhodes. He speaks right up and says, ""What's in it for me?,"" a phrase that becomes his magic words. She gives him the luminous name Lonesome Rhodes and puts him on her morning show where he becomes an immediate local hit. Here on radio he proves he can get people to do outrageous things just by asking. Lonesome has the stuff, star quality, and becomes a radio personality. No need of wands for Lonesome--he has his own magic: the raw vitality of animal magnetism even sight unseen.

Before long Marcia and Lonesome go to Memphis for his own television show.
On their way there, she learns he is really a warty toad inside that Prince Charming disguise, but as a princess is won't to do, she ignores it. In Memphis Lonesome is growing in influence and growing to fit inside that influence. He brings a black woman off the streets and asks the television audience to help raise money to rebuild her burned down house. More than enough money is raised. It's a magic kingdom, television is, with all kinds of far-reaching influence.

Lonesome proves he can sell anything his way-- by belittling the product or boosting the product. He becomes a ""wielder of opinion, a man of influence, a strong hand of the elite to guide the masses,"" and is backed by a maker of presidents. At this point the toad has shed that skin to become a troll.

Meanwhile, what has happened to Princess Marcia? Who is the real knight who comes to the rescue? And what happens to that troll?

""A Face in the Crowd"" is one of the most overlooked films about media manipulation, misuse and abuse of the power of mass appeal by a television personality, a dark look at behind-the-scenes television. What could have been a magic kingdom is twisted by the corruption of power into desolation.

The acting is mesmerizing, with kudos going to Andy Griffith as Lonesome Rhodes and Patricia Neal as Marcia. New actor Walter Matthau excels as the intellectual writer behind the scenes, and Lee Remick as Everywoman in love with Lonesome Rhodes. Elia Kazan directs. The film should have been an Academy Award nominee, if not winner.

294861,4,6300273210,"""A Face in the Crowd"" doesn't often make the list when news organizations do their occasional stories about great political movies. It never gets mentioned with ""The Candidate,"" ""All The Kings Men,"" ""Dave,"" or the other obvious ones.

I came across it entirely by accident, channel-surfing one night. It doesn't start as a political movie -- the beginning has Andy Griifith (showing a side of him you never saw before -- as a guitar-strumming hobo who ends up in a small town jail, and is discovered by a reporter (Patricia Neal) for the local radio show, he sees him as a surefire hit to host a new program. He's not keen at first to give up the hobo life, but he gives it a try, is an instant hit, gets picked up by a bigger station in Memphis and finally ends up with a television show in New York City. The key to his success is his understanding of his audience and their fierce loyalty to him.

The crusty old corporate titan who sponsors the TV show is also a political string-puller and he is trying to maneuver a bland, 50s vintage senator into the White House. One problem is that the guy is a complete dud on television, and the old-line advertising guys who handle him don't know it.

This is where the wonder of the film comes in. Remember ... this is 1957 ... when television is in its infancy and has not yet even established itself as the dominant media influence it demonstrated in the 60s, 70s and 80s.

Given this, there is a simply remarkably scene where Griffith takes over, and is if he were sitting here in 2007,gives a high energy and hilarious tutorial to this bland, stuck-in-the-old-ways Senator on how he has to change his personality to succeed on TV. It's not slapstick humor -- watch the scene and you'll see how it rings true by modern standards. And this was 15 years before Allen Garfield and Joe Boyle tried to shape a too-earnest Robert Redford into a politically potent media candidate.",1199059200,,1923,4.517241379310345

294864,5,6300273210,"Occasionally, the world of cinema is blessed with a work that not only comments on an emerging issue of its time but also forecasts with target precision the potential ramifications of that issue on society at large for decades to come. ""A Face in the Crowd"" is such a groundbreaking film, the magnificence of its message brought alive by the two spellbinding, Oscar-worthy performances of Andy Griffith, making his film debut, and Patricia Neal, already a highly respected actress, who are given equal billing in the opening credits of this 1958 release.

Almost nonstop and for more than two hours, Andy Griffith chews up everything in his path as Lonesome Rhodes, a drifter with the gifts of gab and song and an uncanny ability to tell his audience what it wants to hear - whatever he thinks privately. With a maniacal laugh and take-no-prisoners approach aimed at whomever he is trying to win over, Rhodes is the antithesis of the straight-arrow good ole' boy that Griffith would portray with astounding success on the tube just several years later. First-time viewers of this film will know immediately they're Not In Mayberry Anymore when, instead of popping a Ritz cracker into his mouth and breaking into a smarmy grin, Rhodes takes a belt from a whiskey bottle and sneers as he manhandles his guitar in the jailhouse - or when he leers malevolently at a baton twirler's calves during a mass adulation in the town in which he was ""discovered"". In less capable dramatic hands, Griffith's reading of the Rhodes character could easily have become repetitive and headache inducing, but in Griffith's roundhouse performance, the viewer is left spellbound, almost hypnotized by one of the most overlooked performances in American cinema.

The casting of Patricia Neal as the radio producer who innocently christens Rhodes ""Lonesome"" and sets America on a course of idol worship was truly inspired. Her soft-spoken drawl, doe-eyed look of innocence and fear of getting too close to Rhodes' crackling bonfire of sexual energy serve as the perfect counterpoint to Griffith's rip-snortin' persona. Neal is the only performer in ""Crowd"" that holds her own against Griffith's mesmerizing presence.

In terms of its message, ""Crowd"", adroitly written by Budd Schulberg (who the credits say also co-wrote the songs Griffith performs), tells us that anyone with talent or the right stage presence can be packaged at convenience for mass consumption - so long as the packagers have the final say. It's all about the Sponsor, Stupid, even at the local radio station whose manager plays hard-to-get with an advertiser smitten by Rhodes' unctuous charm, and the stakes only grow larger when Rhodes moves to Memphis, then New York. ""Crowd"" debuted when Madison Avenue was starting to perfect the psychological advertising techniques first exposed in Vance Packard's ""The Hidden Persuaders"" (published during the year this film was shot), and ""Crowd"" both deprecates and warns against these techniques. Make no mistake, ""Crowd"" says, the media is all about money, and few who toil in its hallways will have the backbone to take a stand against self-interest in taming the media in order to have its celebrities use their powers responsibly. For Rhodes, the black woman he ushers on-camera or the boy in the wheelchair are simply props that help perpetuate both his ratings and his sinister influence, and when he decides to escalate to the next level with a demogogic senator, the best his writer can do is sit down and try to dash off an expose. Even Neal's character briefly succumbs to the promise of a payoff when bad-boy Rhodes realizes she's mad as hell and won't take it any more. And when the ""next"" Lonesome Rhodes is discovered, there are all too many industry players ready to take up his cause... and cash in.

In the end, ""Crowd"" can be viewed as warning that we may never see the last of the Joseph McCarthys, but that only until things become too ""hot"" under the kleig light will media titans pull the plug. It's the Sponsor, Stupid, as attested to in real life by Edward R. Murrow, the Smothers Brothers and Don Imus.

294865,5,6300273210,"This is one of 2 Elia Kazan films I've seen (the other being On the Waterfront), and not only did this film surpass my expectations, it is one of the best films I've seen in the last year. It has the impact of someone smashing glass on your face, it's that powerful. It is very, very timely, and hasn't dated one bit. Kazan was onto something here, on how TV destroys legitimate debate, and how easily manipulated the masses can be with this medium. Andy Griffith gives arguably his best performance as the troubled drunk (which is a nice way of saying a p***k) who becomes a media sensation with the help of Patricia O'Neal (who is very good in her role). Walter Matthau plays a writer on Griffith's TV show who sees through the lies of Griffith's ""persona"". Sure, Andy's a down home kind of guy on TV, but behind the scenes he's a cruel manipulator, an egomaniac, an adulterer, a thief, and an all around a*****e. Soon Andy's having dinner with important people, and starts advising candidates on how they should run their campaigns and their administrations. It's not too long after that he feels he should get a cabinet post of some kind. And he's muscling O'Neal out of her job as producer, because his ego thinks he's the greatest human being to walk the Earth. But when O'Neal has had enough of his philandering (O'Neal and Griffith have an affair during the film), she switches on the mike when the closing credits are being run for Andy's show. Andy is trashing his audience, and when they hear this, his whole career falls apart. Things haven't changed too much these days, with political candidates (on both sides) being manipulated by their handlers and by television, and how none of them seem real, because they look like they are programmed. Matthau's speech at the end of the film is one of the best closing speeches ever in a film. It's so true, so effective, and so undeniable.

A veritable nobody rises from the drunk tank up the ladder of media cause he has a voice and a face that sells.  At first unassuming and naive Andy Griffith combines homespun values with a winning wit.  The listening public falls in love with a manufactured image that gives them a false sense of security.  He can do no wrong and events take an absurd turn as national media adopts the country boy and corrupts him with accolades and profitable bogus products.  It reaches a stunning climax where he will sit with heads of state and influence policy.  An open mike and a lose tongue lead to his downfall betrayed by his mentor.  It exposes the shallow nature of television and the fickleness of it.  A drunk rises from jail to high ratings and then crashes.  There is a lesson to be learned, but it is lost on the powers that be.  Even before the dust settles a new evangelist is being groomed to fool the people once more.

294918,5,6300273210,"With all the remakes, I can't believe that this movie has never been remade, but how can you beat perfection?  However, this film is actually more relevant today than it was in the 50's because it deals with the power of celebrity and how it can control not only everyday life, but also politics.  Andy Griffith stars as a country bumpkin singer who is discovered by Patricia Neal while he is in an Arkansas jail after having been arrested for being drunk and disorderly.  He is somewhat of a nomad who she convinces to stick around and host a local radio show.  He becomes a beloved figure among the locals and finds that he has the power to influence people to do as he says as he dispenses advice in a friendly and folksy way over the radio.  Word spreads and his fame grows and he is offered a television job in New York City where he becomes more power hungry, believing his own publicity.  He is easily able to manipulate the public and because of this ability, political powers are clamoring for his advice and patronage.  He wasn't a nice guy to begin with and finds this power more than intoxicating.  The movie has a wonderful ending that should never be tampered with.  In addition to Andy Griffith's perfect and stellar performance, there are some wonderful supporting performances that more than hold their own against him.  You have a very young Walter Matthau as an idealistic writer who sees right through him from the start.  You have a beautiful young Lee Remick in her first acting role as a teenager who is infatuated with him.  Patricia Neal, who believes she can tame the wild beast, and Anthony Franciosa as a young advertising exec who wants to ride the waves of fame right with him.  With people so influenced and starved for celebrity today, you can see how this kind of media manipulation could take place.  Parts of the film are very dated and corny, but it only adds to the charm and effect.  Brilliantly directed by Elia Kazan.  This is one of my all time favorite black and white movies and there is nothing about it I would change.  As I said, how can you tamper with perfection?  It's definitely one not to miss.",1184544000,2,2145,4.527272727272727
294919,5,6300273210,"I am so fond of Budd Schulberg, and Andy Griffith went on to become among our biggest TV stars when I was a youngun, so I expected A FACE IN THE CROWD to keep me entertained. What I hardly expected was that TV would end up being exposed as a medium which thrives on the possibility of turning young people who have a talent for communicating in a way that reminds people of Will Rogers into sales entities for commercial and political hokum. I also watched ""Hollywood Ending"" (2002) this week, which featured Woody Allen as an aging director who takes multiple medicines to match the activities of his day, and explaining it, says, ""And this one keeps me dry when it's raining."" Lonesome Rhodes (played by Andy Griffith) gets his start with a New York ad agency pushing pills that pep him up, but his ending is quite abrupt when a microphone is turned on to reveal his contempt for the folks he fools while the credits roll at the end of the show. That is not quite the ending, because after that he is at the top of a tall building and he feels like jumping off and you get to find out which other characters think it is such a good idea, they can hardly wait.

Modern democracy still depends on TV, or bombing television stations, in the case of those enemies who dare to broadcast propaganda about NATO or the sole surviving super power. I don't watch much TV myself, but I see little clips on the internet that engage in demeaning whoever is trashing powerful mainstream media interests at the moment. The global economy is skewed to cater to an audience which has a lot in common with those early TV viewers seeing the Lonesome Rhodes Cracker Barrel and political huckster hour. Politically, Baghdad has turned into a pill that is like the battle of Gettysburg, where people ought to remember which army came the furthest to fight. Political scandals often reveal a character flaw that fits right into Aristotle's views on irreconcilable pride in his theory of tragedy, like President Clinton's sexual pride when a female White House intern turns on the power of her thong underwear, or George W. Bush's power to fire any U.S. Attorney who has some ideas about justice being used as a tool to help American Indians, which he does not personally believe in.

A Face in the Crowd shows just how even in its infancy TV was already a corrupting power, its power in the visual.  Andy Griffith as the hustler, near do well, Larry ""Lonesome"" Rhodes is frightening.  If you only know Griffith as Opie Taylor's father you are in for a surprise and a shock.  Griffith's character plays off of the early optimism of the Patricia Neal character, Marcia Jeffries.  If Lonesome is corrupted by power, Marcia buys into the wealth TV can generate.

294923,5,6300273210,"I'm not going to write about the symbolism or get into political jousting where this film is concerned because that doesn't matter to me in the least.  All I know is that from the first time I saw this approximately 10 years ago on AMC one Saturday morning, I've wondered who the hell was Andy Griffith's agent back then and why did he keep him out of movies of this callibur and genre.  I barely remembered that Matthau, Remmick and Franciosa were even in it.  He engulfed each and every scene he was in like nothing I'd ever seen before.  He chewed up anyone else who had the misfortune of even being in the same scene with him in this movie.

With this being one of his first movies (the other standout being No Time for Sargents) you'd think he'd have been typecast as a villian, and maybe that's why his agent avoided his getting this type of role.  His take of the down-home county boy radio show ham who hands out bits of wisdom as Lonesome Rhodes starts out like a quaint little fire in a pot-bellied stove that warms you and is comforting.  But all of that quickly gets out of control as he is discovered and the flames of his new level of fame whip out of control and engulfs EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE that comes in contact with Lonesome.  (Even his loyal listening audience)

Andy's boisterous, obnoxious and outrageous performance might have easily come off as over the top in someone else's hands but he is so believable that you too can feel the wave of ego build inside him yourself, yet you can only do much like Patricia Neal does; stand back with your mouth open in astonishment and hold on for the ride or get run down like a dog in the street.  Andy's Lonesome Rhodes character is much like an approaching train wreck, you know it's coming, you know it's going to be a bad scene littered with bodies when it's over but somehow you just can't look away.

Griffith gives viewers an opportunity to see just about every emotion required of any actor, which, then allows you to acknowledge, how much of a great actor Mr Griffith really is.

295010,5,6300273210,"There are two major things that I find quite fascinating as I watch this 1957 classic. The first is the prophetic, hyper-realistic portrayal of television as a pervasive medium encroaching upon people's lives in ways unheard of back in the 1950's. The second is Andy Griffith's pull-all-the-stops performance as drunken hobo-turned-media sensation ""Lonesome"" Rhodes. For those who know Griffith only for his homespun TV portrayals, you will be surprised how remarkably he shows the venal underbelly and high-octane charisma of a character miles away from kindly, soft-spoken Sheriff Andy Taylor.

Master filmmaker Elia Kazan and writer Budd Schulberg, collaborating for the second and last time after their brilliant ""On the Waterfront"" three years earlier, tell the story of Rhodes, a burgeoning pop-culture phenomenon thanks primarily to the efforts of Marcia Jeffries, a young radio program host who discovers him sprawled in a hangover on the floor of a rural Arkansas jail. He mesmerizes the local radio audience with an improvised country song about his predicament, ""Free Man in the Morning"", and this marks the beginning of his meteoric rise all the way to his own weekly national TV program. As he capitalizes on his folksy charm and empathetic manner, he becomes a power-crazed tyrant behind the scenes. A corporate tycoon wants to use Rhodes' influence to sway a Presidential campaign in his favor, and Rhodes' megalomania moves him lockstep into a Citizen Kane-like form of paranoia.

It all seems exaggerated but it's brilliantly observed much like a film that covered the same themes twenty years later, Sidney Lumet and Paddy Chayefsky's ""Network"". However, even with strong doses of black comedy sprinkled throughout, Kazan and Schulberg use more melodramatic elements in their skewering until the near-Shakespearian climax when Rhodes' comeuppance takes on a grandly theatrical fervor. In a way, it seems a shame that Griffith never got another chance to bring out his dark side on the big screen. While sometimes wildly undisciplined in his film debut, he dexterously shows the cunning and charisma of his character to a level that makes his national celebrity utterly credible.

Showing his amazing facility to elicit stellar work from a wide variety of actors, Kazan assembled a strong cast to back him up starting with Patricia Neal, who is just as devastating as Marcia, a woman torn between ambition, decency and her fateful attraction to Rhodes. An impossibly young Walter Matthau shows the beginnings of his cynical screen persona as Mel, a crafty television writer who de facto becomes Marcia's conscience. In their film debuts and making indelible impressions, Anthony Franciosa and Lee Remick play Joey, an office lackey who turns into Rhodes' immoral agent, and Betty Lou, a teenaged baton twirler seduced easily by Rhodes' power, respectively.

If the film has one flaw, it's that it runs on a bit long for the parable it tells especially since Rhodes' moral ambiguity is pretty much settled in the first half of the story. Nevertheless, this movie is essential viewing as it not only shows a powerful early indictment of television (and supports Marshall McLuhan's mantra, ""The medium is the message"") but provides another example of the underappreciated artistry of Kazan and Schulberg. The 2005 DVD has unfortunately no commentary track but one strong extra, a half-hour 2005 featurette, ""Facing the Past"", which spotlights Kazan's polarizing testimony in front of the House Committee on Un-American Activities and the threatening role of television in the 1950's, both major factors in making the film. Griffith, Neal and Schulberg are interviewed. There is also a widescreen version of the original film trailer.",1152316800,6,3747,5.303030303030303
295011,5,6300273210,"This astounding film is so prescient regarding our current plight that it could be considered prophetic.  Andy Griffith is astonishing in his role as a lifelong failure and screw-up who is discovered and groomed into a folksy demagogue by a Svengali-like character (portrayed in the movie by Patricia Neal and in life by Karl Rove).  Fronting for a sinister group of conservative and wealthy big-business-types,  Larry ""Lonesome"" Rhodes manages to get one of them elected President by talking him up between stints of joking, banjo-playing and being ""jes' folks"" on the radio (here fiction and the present reality diverge somewhat).  Familiar to me from his work on ""The Andy Griffith Show"", I have not seen such remarkably successful casting against type since the avuncular Fred Mac Murray of the 60's TV show ""My Three Sons"" played the weaselly, self-serving Navy officer in ""The Caine Mutiny"".

You might say that this movie has a happy ending: Just when ""Lonesome"" Rhodes is at the zenith of his power and popularity, Patricia Neal decides to leave the microphone open after one of his broadcasts ends so that the public will learn what he really thinks of them.  Instead of folksy patter, the country is stupefied as they overhear venomous contempt for them stream from their radio speakers.  With that, Rhodes is finished.

The concluding half-hour which follows is a harrowing scene as Rhodes returns to his luxurious home and proceeds to emotionally disintegrate before the eyes of a skeptical and unsympathetic Walter Matthau.  (Did the people who made ""Network"" get their ideas for the Peter Finch character's breakdown from this scene?)  From the standpoint of the story as a whole, the movie could have ended soon after the scene with the open mike, but the sight of ol' ""Lonesome"" raving, bawling, and wallowing in self-pity is one the viewer is not likely to forget.

The most disturbing thing about this film is the evident faith of Elia Kazan-a patriot who endured much vilification for testifying against Stalinist Communists in the movie industry-that the people, though mislead, would eventually catch on and would do the right thing.  That is by no means clear at the moment.  Instead, there is plenty of evidence that the public has turned away from serious news (it may tell them things they do not want to hear) and towards infotainment that plays to their fears, hates, vanities, delusions and ignorance.  By contrast, they have shown themselves appallingly credulous towards official assurances and prevarications of a sort usually seen only in Nazi or Soviet propaganda.  Indeed totalitarian propaganda, and even ""Lonesome"" Rhodes' pseudo-populist cornpone seem hopelessly primitive compared to today's state of the art.  Even so, the worst lies are always the ones told to one's self.  When the country reacts to officially condoned torture and murder of prisoners with something like `They would never do that! And besides, what's wrong with it anyway?', then reality has finally trumped any possible satire-even satire as brilliant as this film's.",1151366400,8,3077,5.146586345381526

Under Elia Kazan's masterful direction and with a brilliantly conceived script written by the venerable Budd Schulberg, ""A Face in the Crowd"" is a frightening vehicle which chronicles the ascension of an uneducated sham to the highest pinnacles of power.

Griffith is discovered by roving reporter Marcia Jeffries played in an excellent performance by Patricia Neal, who works for a local radio station.  With tape recorder in hand she enters the local jail where Griffith is sleeping off a public drunkenness summons.  She gives him air time and amazingly his boisterous countrified jargon and down home philosophy instantly makes him a media favorite.

295065,4,6300273210,"From a dirty jailhouse floor in Nowhere, Arkansas to the stage of the Grand Ole Opry in Memphis to the bright lights of New York City Elia Kazan's A FACE IN THE CROWD chronicles the meteoric rise of media star Larry `Lonesome' Rhodes (Andy Griffith.)
Andy Griffith wasn't a polished actor when A FACE IN THE CROWD was made, and his performance consists almost entirely of sudden movements, loud sounds and kinetic energy.  It's more than a little over the top, and the special on the dvd (`Facing the Past') leads you to believe that's more or less the way director Elia Kazan wanted it.  If `Lonesome' Rhodes is all surface noise, Marcia Jeffries (Patricia Neal) embodies quiet depth.  She's the most complex character in the screenplay, one who has to go from smoldering lovelorn frustration to confusion to pity and points beyond.  Fortunately, Patricia Neal is one of the best screen actresses ever, one who is able to communicate more with one reaction shot than most actors can with a page of dialogue. Walter Matthau plays writer Mel Miller, a wryly detached cynic who, it's hinted at, carries a torch for Marcia and also carries the point-of-view of the audience.  Miller is `Lonesome' Rhodes lead writer, a job that will lead him to write an expos book entitled `Demagogue in Denim.'  If the audience is able to sneer through the Walter Matthau character, we feel through Marcia Jeffries.  Neal is the anchor of this project.
  It's Matthau's Miller, though, who voices one of the core messages of this movie - ""You gotta be a saint to stand all the power that little box (television) can give you."" A saint Rhodes ain't.  In fact, he's cast more like a classic movie monster, this time decked out in cowboy hat and denim jeans rather than neck bolts and elevator boots. If Griffith plays The Monster, Marcia is Victor Frankenstein, the one with the strongest ties to this abomination, the one who can still mourn amid the rubble that follows in the wake of `Lonesome' Rhodes meteoric rise.
  The monster he becomes is one born of the media, nursed in radio and nurtured by television, abetted by businessmen who appreciate his ability to sell product and courted by politicians who demean themselves to bask in his reflected glow.  A FACE IN THE CROWD is probably the first great critique of television by Hollywood.  Although dated and a little corny today, as opposed to the outlandish and improbable label it held when it was made, it sure proved prophetic.  Within a decade people would be writing about how politicians were sold like dish soap and detailing television's insidious and central role in the process.  It's an insight that we're grown used to, almost bored with, but Kazan and screenwriter Budd Schulberg deserve homesteaders credit on this one.  They were the first to give voice to what they saw as a subversion of democracy, and for that they deserve rich credit.
Oddly, there's no commentary track on this one.  I say `oddly' because this is part of the 7-dvd box set (The Controversial Classics) and A FACE IN THE CROWD is the only disk in that set without a commentary track.  As a bit of compensation the dvd features, besides the trailer and the movie, a 30-minute, 2005 featurette entitled `Facing the Past.'  It's a talking-head/run-a-movie-clip special that features a couple of Elia Kazan scholars, stars Griffith, Neal and Anthony Franciosa, as well as writer Budd Schulberg.",1120089600,7,3416,4.826758147512865
295066,5,6300273210,"My image of Andy Griffith as and actor and as a person has always been positive. I don't know him, he may be the biggest jerk in the world for all I know, but he has managed his public image well and has kept his name unsullied by sordid rumors, so I have always liked him.

If your image of Griffith is the same, and you have never seen this movie, brace yourself for the cognitive dissonance you will feel when you watch this! Griffith turns in a powerful performance as a hobo troubador who is ""discovered"" by a small-town radio host while in jail and then uses the opportunities that unfold to rocket to fame as a canny, folksy and cynical television entertainer and pundit.

My take after watching the movie is that Griffith's character, Larry ""Lonesome"" Rhodes, was always self-centered but was quite the ladies man as well. He found with Patricia Neal's help that he could use his folksy manner to get what he wanted. He also found that simple folks fell for and identified with his cornpone stories. But it was his handlers who led him to believe his own press and that his insight was indispensable in every situation.

Kazan and Schulburg use the movie as a vehicle to show not only how television could be misused in politics, but also in advertising. With Rhodes as its spokesman, sales of  a worthless energy pill soared and so Rhodes became a sought-after spinmeister in other areas as well. Television does for Rhodes what radio did for the real-life folksy musician/politician Pappy O'Daniel.

On the romantic side, Rhodes was a real skirt-chaser, full of promises but always with his eye out for his next conquest. His come-uppance came when he jilted the woman who had helped bring him to his great heights for the charms of a groupie-like baton-twirling teenager (Lee Remick) he met when a judge at a twirling contest. The cliche is that ""hell hath no fury..."", and the jilted Patricia Neal lost no time in conspiring to bring him down. She got her chance when she burst in to the studio and aired for the nation to hear all of Griffith's contemptuous comments about his fan base to the bunch of ""hayseeds"" he used as a focus group on his show. That put a quick end to his popularity and the ranting,raving ending is really something to witness! It is left to the viewer's imagination as to whether Griffith follows through on his threat to jump from his office tower if Neal leaves him.

I never heard of this movie until recently and bought it on the strength of a recommendation. I'm glad I did. You won't be sorry either when you add A Face In The Crowd to your DVD collection.",1117065600,5,2600,4.544871794871795
295067,5,6300273210,"At first the central premise of ""A Face in the Crowd"" was a little hard for me to swallow.  I'd like to think that the general public is a little more discerning and would not be so easily taken in by a megalomaniac like Lonesome Rhodes.  But then, the argument goes that Abe Lincoln would never be elected president today.  When you think about it our more successful presidencies, depending on your political persuasion, would be Kennedy, Reagan, and Clinton who were all masters of the medium.  I'd like to think of this film as more of a cautionary tale of the dangers of the new medium of television.  Director Elia Kazan from a script by Budd Schulberg have crafted their parable quite well.  I would like to think that Rhodes is not quite the monster that he inevitably became, that he started his career humbly and with good intentions only to be corrupted by forces that manipulated him to the darker side.  Andy Griffith, in probably one of the most criminally overlooked performances in American film history, is simply mesmerizing as Rhodes.  He manages to convey the folksiness tainted with contempt and self-loathing that ultimately is Lonesome Rhodes.  Patricia Neal is superb as Marcia Jeffries, the woman who discovers Rhodes and has mixed emotions about his fame.  Walter Matthau is also good as Mel Miller, a writer on Rhodes' show who feels he's sold his soul in the process.  I am trying to think of another film that tackled the beast that is television and the only comparable one that comes to mind is ""Network"".  By all means check out the documentary on the film that includes reminisces from Griffith, Neal, and Schulberg.  One priceless moment is Griffith recalling the filming of the baton-twirlers scene.",1116547200,3,1734,4.8175675675675675
295068,5,6300273210,"If you are a big fan of the great TV series, ""The Andy Griffith Show""(and who isn't), you might want to think twice about watching ""A Face in the Crowd"".  This is NOT the same character.  There is a brilliant mind behind the easy-going ""ah shucks"" delivery in each of the characters.  However, the sheriff always does the right thing, while Lonesome the drifter seems to always do the wrong thing.  Yet if you're a fan of the actor, Andy Griffith, you can't miss this movie; it's his best acting role bar none.

What makes ""A Face in the Crowd"" so impressive is its' foresight in understanding media, politics, and the ability of one to manipulate the other.  After all, this movie was made in the mid-50's when the power of TV was little understood or appreciated.  It may well have gotten reviews that ridiculed its' premise when it was released.  Yet, seen today, it is an amazing study of how one man, with a willing media accomplice, can control public opinion.  Griffith's evolution from a Saturday night drunk to one of THE most influencial persons in the county is brilliantly scripted and directed.  In addition to Andy Griffith, there is a very worthy cast.

Most of us would love it if the world was like Mayberry.  Unfortunately, ""A Face in the Crowd"" comes a lot closer to reality.",1116547200,4,1294,4.602620087336245
295069,5,6300273210,"Having read others' comments here (and on IMDB) and having just watched its new DVD, I'll add my two cents. This has been one of my faves since first seeing it (too) long ago. Well, it is more relevant than ever and should be seen be everyone (literally)!! I notice some (likely younger) folks mentioned comparisons to some politicians, but indeed Lonesome Rhodes was based on the phenomenally successful (and notoriously haughty) radio & early TV host Arthur Godfrey. Yes, Godfrey discovered Julius La Rosa, but La Rosa probably got fired for asking for a raise (after becoming very popular, both on the show and solo records). Apparently Arthur, like Lawrence Welk, was a cheap prick who only paid scale -- no matter what the tenure or how successful were his performers.

""A Face In the Crowd"" was most definitely social commentary, NOT satire; although, as one from that era, I can understand why it seemed so to many at the time. It's apparent why it inspired so many future talents! That this film was not nominated on its own merits due to political differences/grudges is a GD crime!!!  Can't say why Andy Griffith wasn't, but he sure deserved it... Awesome!! So awesome, it actually effected his personal life.

Anyway, re: politicians, ""A Face In the Crowd"" was a prescient warning of the dangers of that new media (TV), thus akin to those who subsequently capitalized on its propaganda potential and the *science* of people's weakness of mistaking ""image"" for truth!

But Kazan was not simply a great director; he was perhaps the most socially conscious of all Hollywood directors!! And he was one of the greatest actors' directors; hence, one reason why you never saw an Andy Griffith act like this in film again! (The DVD also has an excellent up-to-date documentary about the making of AFITC and its genesis, with many pertinent historical tidbits re: Kazan.)

In just 21 films, Kazan directed at least 10 GREAT films:

""America, America"" (1963), ""Wild River"" (1960), ""Baby Doll"" (1956), ""East of Eden"" (1955), ""On the Waterfront"" (1954), ""Viva Zapata!"" (1952), ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" (1951), ""Panic in the Streets"" (1950), ""Gentleman's Agreement"" (1947), and ""A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"" (1945).

In his films, 21 different actors had Oscar-nominated performances: James Dunn, Celeste Holm, Gregory Peck, Dorothy McGuire, Anne Revere, Jeanne Crain, Ethel Barrymore, Ethel Waters, Karl Malden, Vivien Leigh, Kim Hunter, Marlon Brando, Anthony Quinn, Eva Marie Saint, Lee J. Cobb, Rod Steiger, Jo Van Fleet, James Dean, Carroll Baker, Mildred Dunnock, and Natalie Wood -- of which Dunn, Holm, Malden, Leigh, Hunter, Quinn, Brando, Saint and Van Fleet ALL won Oscars for their performances in one of Kazan's movies.

He is discovered by Patricia Neal's character and he begins a ""Will Rogers"" type of career.  Part humorist, part philosopher, and all-round phony, he parlays his talent into a national following which builds to a stunning climax.

What I liked about this film was its depth and the talent of the actors. Director Elia Kazan was fantastic in what I believe to be his finest picture.  The emotions he drew out of the actors was fantastic! Everyone was perfect in their respective roles.  This is also a movie you won't grow tired of watching.  When you see it a few times, you notice things you didn't catch the first go-round.  This one's a keeper!",1115942400,4,770,4.610294117647059
295071,5,6300273210,"Ask most film fanatics to name their favorite Elia Kazan film and you will likely get ""On the Waterfront"" as your answer. But if you were to ask me, my answer is ""A Face in the Crowd."" Were it not for the fact that Kazan was ""blacklisted"" by the Hollywood liberal elite for his supposed testimony (in which he named only those who were already named by others), this film might have swept the Academy Awards. As it was the film was virtually ignored -- Andy Griffith, who gave the performance of a lifetime, was not even nominated for Best Actor, and his performance h0olds up to this day.

As to this classic making its debut on DVD, all I can say is It's About Time.

The film also marked the debuts of three talented actors that left their marks on film and television: Tony Franciosa, Walter Matthau, and Lee Remick.

But what makes this movie so great to watch again and again is that its subject matter never goes out of date, based as it is on the power of television to manipulate and control the minds of viewers. Griffith stars as Larry Rhodes, a drifter awoken one morning in the local jail by Patricia Neal, who is looking for subjects for her morning radio show, ""A Face in the Crowd."" Assured by the sheriff that he'll be released if he performs, Rhodes grabs his guitar and puts on a show that lands him a regular job on Neal's radio show. Now known as ""Lonesome"" Rhodes, his combination of homespun philosopher-entertainer quickly takes him from Arkansas to Memphis, where he meets Joey DePalma (Tony Franciosa), an aspiring agent who lands him a network deal in New York. Walter Matthau goes along as the head writer who stays on for the pay despite being mocked by Rhodes. Neal also comes with her prot&eacute;g&eacute;, for not only is she his manager, she is also his lover. (The movie's sub-text deals with the love Neal has for the Frankenstein monster she created, despite what he does to her time after time.) Her reaction when she finds out at the airport that her intended Lonesome has married a cheerleader (Remick) is one of the finest pieces of acting in the history of film.

Brought to New York to pitch a worthless product call Vitajex on a variety show, Rhodes makes both the product and himself the biggest things since sliced bread. There is a hilarious sequence of a bout three minutes during this scene of how Madison Avenue can manipulate the public into believing a worthless product is actually good for you. People I've shown this to sit there with mouths agape, dazzled by sophistication rarely encountered in the movies.

Rhodes now comes to the attention of the product's sponsor, who convinces him that not only is Rhodes an opinion maker, but that his untapped power should be used to make a Senate nonentity named J. Worthington Fuller into a viable presidential candidate. Rhodes takes the challenge, renaming the Senator ""Curly"" Fuller and featuring him on his new show, ""Lonesome Rhodes' Cracker Barrel,"" a sort of down home ""McLaughlin Group."" By this time, Rhodes's megalomania is completely out of control; his price for Fuller is a cabinet post as Secretary for National Morale. And he almost gets away with it, until Neal pulls the plug in a most unique manner.

It is left to Walter Matthau to deliver the epilogue: we have not seen the last of Lonesome Rhodes. He'll be back, with others just like him; a chilling prediction only too well borne out by subsequent events.

It's a shame this classic hasn't received more attention than it has. The message is timeless, the acting and direction flawless. There has been talk of a remake, but let's hope this doesn't come to fruition. It's perfect as is.",1110758400,20,3657,4.660465116279069

295073,5,6300273210,"Andy Griffith succeeds in pulling off an act of pure madness in this chronicle of the rise and fall of a superstar.

A Face in the Crowd is a mezmerizing film from start to finish. You get introduced to the character Lonesome Rhodes as he lay passed out in a jail cell. A local radio news reporter, played by Patricia Niel, is scouting for new talent and happens to see this explosive accident waiting to happen sprawled across the floor. She wakes him up and convinces him to sing into her recorder for the program she hosts. He whips out his old guitar (the love of his life) tries to sober a little, then makes up an ol' tune on the spot. Thus begins the immediate success of Lonesome Rhodes. Unfortunately, when the big mouth antics of this loose cannon give away the true intentions of his heart, an incredible twist formulates and the world comes crashing down.

A face in the crowd is loosely based on a personality during the fifties known as the ""IL Redhead"" Author Godfrey. He was one of the biggest country sensation in 57, or the decade for that matter.

From beginning to end A Face in the Crowd is a 2 hour 5 minute journey that I couldn't shake.

Too bad he did not enter the movie-making scene in a larger way.

The film, Face in the Crowd stands up, even today with the manipulation of the media by individuals who begin as nobodys and end up being authorities on everything, simply by virtue of their fame.

Andy Griffith startles with his open-mouthed laugh, his indifferent attitude, and his hunger for sex and drink. Who would have thought our sweet country sheriff would have all this in him?

One wonders what else Mr. Griffith would have been capable of had he been given or taken the chance.

295125,5,6300273210,"This film shows what a fine actor Andy Griffith truly is, and what roles he could have mastered had he not chosen the Mayberry path instead.

Directed by Elia Kazan, the political drama and satire of commercialism ""A Face in the Crowd"" is the story of Lonesome Rhodes (Griffith), a charismatic guitar-playing drifter who is discovered by radio executive Marcia Jeffries (the husky-voiced Patricia Neal) while in jail on a public drunk charge. He catapults to radio and TV stardom under the guise of being an aw-shucks homeboy who loves his fans. In fact, Lonesome Rhodes is a slimy, greedy, egotistical, manipulative womanizer with underhanded political aspirations and nothing but contempt for his gullible audience.  The film was far ahead of its time in its theme and telling, and Andy Griffith gives a blazing performance that rivals Burt Lancaster's in ""Elmer Gantry"" (for which Lancaster won an Oscar).  That this film wasn't even nominated for any awards is very surprising.

I also am saddened that it's never been released on DVD; it's one of the best of its kind I have ever seen, and was certainly Griffith's plum role and best performance.  With a stellar supporting cast, including Patricia Neal, Walter Matthau, Tony Franciosa and a beautiful Lee Remick in her first film role, ""A Face in the Crowd"" is a must-see film, and should eradicate any opinion you may have that Griffith was only capable of his wholesome TV roles of Sheriff Taylor and Ben Matlock.",1106179200,4,1471,4.939271255060729

And it has been said that Griffith swore to never play a similar role again, as some of the his characters personality spilled over into his home life. What a loss for us, but what proof that he was one incredible actor AND one incredible person. I get so tired of hearing that Brando was the greatest actor of his generation. It's just not true and man does Griffith make that clear, although I am sure that wasn't his goal, in this movie. Besides, do people forget the name Bette Davis, or Lawrence Olivier or Claude Reines. Well, after seeing Face in the Crowd, you gotta be clueless to not name the truly greats correctly. Griffith is phenomenal. This movie should be the primer for all actors, writers and film makers.

While this is not exactly the message of ""A Face in the Crowd"", it is indeed the spirit of the warning this incredible film cries out. What Lonesome Rhodes and the powers behind him did to his audience in this 1957 film actually happened to us this year. Take a good look at Presidential candidate Senator Worthington ""Curly"" Fuller in this movie, and the dark forces backing him, those forces being the ""General"" and his hi-powered cartel (not Lonesome Rhodes himself, for he, too, is just a pawn and is too arrogant to realize it). Listen to what ""Old Curly"" stands for and look closely at to whom Lonesome Rhodes is pitching on ""Curly's"" behalf. Does it smell familiar? It should.

As for Andy Griffith's performance in this film, if the scene in the jailhouse where he starts singing ""free man in the morning"" doesn't grab you by the neck and jerk your head up to the TV screen, then you probably have the soul of a fence post.

A tremendously timely film showing the crude underside of the machinations of television and star-making, this film pulls no punches and always respects the smarts of its audience. It also gives Walter Matthau the rare chance to play something of a romantic lead as the cynical journalist who secretly pines for Patricia Neal's television producer (who secretly pines for Griffith- you get the idea).

The direction and the scripting are brilliant, as is the central performance by Andy Griffith in playing against type to create a genuinely scary portrayal of a meglomaniac pied piper demagogue who comes frighteningly close to ruling the country.
Moreover, one might ask how many people in politics in the course of their drive to power develop, as did Lonesome Rhodes, a basic contempt and loathing for the people, namely us, who they are supposed to represent and work for.

I honestly can't believe I've spent almost 38 years of a life not having seen this.  Imagine something just as powerful, vulgar and explosive as ""A Streetcar Named Desire,"" then multiply it by two.  You'll get this movie.  Patricia Neal, as always, alluring, full of bedroom eyes and that gorgeous voice, which I prefer even to Lauren Bacall for its dusky sultriness. What a woman!  She was married to Roald Dahl, you know.  My favourite photograph of the two of them was taken by Eli Wallach; quite fitting.
Walter Matthau, in one of his early screen roles, tones it down, really low-key and gets the last laugh at movie's end.
But, let me tell you about Andy Griffith.  I don't know whether it's his own genius, or Kazan's, but it is as good - or better - than Marlon Brando as Stanley Kowalski.  A further limb to go out on:  It's better than Robert deNiro in anything, including ""Taxi Driver"" or ""Raging Bull.""
Maybe it's just coming off the drunk I had after watching this movie, downing a shot as potent as Bacardi 151, thinking it was ice water.

Who would've thunk?  Andy Taylor, Sheriff of Mayberry?  Matlock?  Yet, there he is, getting more and more vicious, lapping up the adulation, exploding into this force of populist politics.  He's every Southern snake-charmer politician and evangelist I hate -- Jerry Falwell, Newt Gingrich, Bill Clinton, Jesse Helms and Jimmy Swaggart - rolled into one.
This movie comes at you from a liberal perspective, but that's not the message; the politics are immaterial.  What's important here is how a some cracker barrel homespun, seemingly innocent hick, can so easily twist politics into a vehicle for a fascist takeover of America.  It reminded me a lot of Sinclair Lewis' novel ""It Can't Happen Here,"" in which folksy senator Buzz Windrip sells the people on a toxic tonic of sentimentality laced with bigotry.

295209,5,6300273210,"A FACE IN THE CROWD is one of the most powerful and revelatory films never to have won an Oscar.  Director Elia Kazan presents a disturbing image of America.  Kazan's America is peopled either by fools who can be manipulated like lemmings to run off a cliff or by aw-shuckin' Pied Pipers who lead them off, laughing all the while at their naivete.  Andy Griffith, in his role of a lifetime, plays Lonesome Rhodes, a low-class, conman wannabe whom Patricia Neal finds quite by accident in a local lockup.  She hears his country accent and is conquered by his homespun philosophy that seems to say a great deal but is all smoke and mirrors.  Rhodes is a verbal snapping turtle, waiting for his One Big Chance and in Neal, he finds it. She puts him on a radio show, where for the first time, his target audience now numbers in the thousands.  As he speaks into the mike, the audience listening on the radio and the audience watching him on their VCR can hear the power of his voice, exhorting them to become his camp followers.  Paradoxically, neither audience seems willing or able to look behind the smiling mask or hear past the barrage of corn to notice the evil that just now has found an outlet.  Walter Matthau and Tony Franciosa have superb minor roles who grease the skids for Rhodes, who increasingly is seen as a collective future composite of television and radio hosts so common today.  Rhodes, having conquered radio, now switches to television, reaching out to a national audience that is pictured as nothing less than suckers waiting to be fleeced.  Rhodes does not believe in looking back.  His focus is always on the new, the formerly unobtainable.  After he begins an affair with Neal, he has no problems dumping her for a sexy teenage cheerleader, played by Lee Remick, who pompoms both briefly and sensually.  Neal is determined to destroy Rhodes and she does so by allowing America to see the loathsomeness of Rhodes behind the mask and to hear the bitter ugly truth that pours from his lips.  It is only then that America wises up to the manipulator that very nearly became the power behind the presidential throne.
  A FACE IN THE CROWD is a truly gripping tale that is also hurtful to watch.  As you see and hear Lonesome Rhodes glide through the nation's mass media to become nothing less than a total pop icon, you can see that the difference between a country run by legitimate leaders or one run by a master manipulator is so slight that a spurned heart may be all that separates what Rhodes reached out to grab but missed only by the slightest of margins.",1027382400,5,2582,4.59041394335512

While I was watching A Face In The Crowd for the first time (it took me until age 40 before I discovered this film), I felt numbed, my emotions felt...BLASTED. I told my husband that I didn't think I could ever watch Matlock again-- how could this towering terror have ""sold out"" by playing the nice guy the rest of his life? How DARE he deprive his audience of the power he so obviously was able to bring to the screen? I was perplexed, even angry-- what happened?
Now that I've heard the story of why his career took the path it did, I can watch his other work, smile, and appreciate it all the more. Because it's OK; they caught lightning in a bottle with this one. Most actors go their entire lives without leaving this kind of legacy.
I'd never seen Patricia Neal play her emotions this raw, either. The HOWL she lets out when she throws herself across the console to keep Rhodes on the air...Kazan had a way of really wringing his actors.
I won't go into any synopsis or further analysis; other reviewers have done just fine on that count. However, I am dumbfounded that this film is NOT on DVD, was NOT nominated for a single Academy Award; while I suppose the latter can be explained away by the politics of the times, it doesn't explain why Wiley and Bona's otherwise exhaustive tome ""Inside Oscar"" doesn't even MENTION the film as having made an impact. We were paranoid, yes, and we were cautious then (what goes around,comes around,huh?), but were audiences and critics also deaf, dumb, and blind? I intend to do further research on that note; this film is not likely to leave my psyche soon.",1027123200,232,1991,4.487603305785124
295211,5,6300273210,"A Face in the Crowd, director Elia Kazan's criminally underrated 1956 political melodrama, tells the all-too plausible story of Lonsome Rhodes.  Discovered by a local reporter (Patricia Neal) while spending time in a jail cell for vagrancy, Rhodes (Andy Griffith) is a drifter whose folsky charisma quickly makes him an instant celebrity.  Soon, Rhodes has taken Neal as his lover and has his own television show where he gives out his home-spun opinions to a charmed nation.  However, Rhodes is hardly the benevelolent country bumpkin that he presents himself to be.  Instead, he is a power hungry meglomaniac who uses his fame to promote a fascist political organization.  Much as he seduces a niave nation, he seduces a teenage cheerleader (Lee Remick) into being his bride.  By the time that Neal and cynical television writer Walter Matthau come to realize the monster they've helped unleash on the world, it may indeed be too late.
If this film was too easily dismissed when released, it has become all the more plausible and relavent in recent years.  Certainly, the current popularity of talk radio can be seen as a fulfilment of the film's prophecy.  However, a more disturbing parallel can be made between Rhodes and the recent emergence of several political leaders whose popularity has been based less on their abilities and more on the ""straight-talking"" personalities that they skillfully display to a public disillusioned with ""politics-as-usual.""  (Ross Perot and Jesse Ventura being just two of the more obvious examples.)
Best known for working with certifiably great actors like Marlon Brando and James Dean, Elia Kazan assembled a cast for A Face in the Crowd that may appear unlikely at first.  Who could ever imagine a dark political drama starring Walter Matthau and Andy Griffith -- two seemingly polar opposites best known for their comedic efforts?  However, it is a risk that plays off beautifully.  Matthau's urban glumness stands in perfect contrast to Griffith's country-corn routine and both are such relaxing presences that even the most sophisticated of viewers will find it hard not to be drawn into a false sense of security that makes the film's ultimate revelations all the more disturbing.
A Face in the Crowd was Andy Griffith's first film and he gives an amazing performance that will surprise anyone who knows Griffith only as the sheriff of Mayberry.  While still displaying his own unique charisma, Griffith also doesn't shy away from revealing -- subtly but surely -- that Lonesome Rhodes is a truly evil man.  What's now forgotten is that even as Sherif Andy Taylor, Griffith's performance had a certain edge.  If the people surrounding him were funny, Taylor was always a no-nonsense authoritarian who luckily had a good sense of humor.  In his performance as Rhodes, Griffith gives us a portrait of Andy Taylor without the sense of humor or the grounding-influence of family.  Its an amazing, all-too realistic performance that makes one wonder what Griffith could have accomplished if he'd continued to explore that edge.
Though Griffith dominates the film, the supporting cast is also strong.  Along with the aforementioned Matthau, Patricia Neal gives a strong performance and brings both a subtle class snobbery and a repressed sensuality to her role.  Her scenes later in the film, when she is forced to confront what she has set loose on the world, are devastating.  Though her role is tiny, Lee Remick is both sexy and sympathetic as Griffith's child bride.  Interestingly, Kazan doesn't present her character as a total innocent.  Perhaps much like the film's America, if Remick is seduced and abused Rhodes, it is a seduction and degregation that she, at least partially, seems to desire.
After naming names during the red scare, Kazan often seemed to be drifting.  Shunned by Hollywood, Kazan's films soon became obsessed with justifying his own actions.  His last two great films -- On the Waterfront and a Face in the Crowd -- both deal with the McCarthyism of the 1950s.  If Waterfront was Kazan's justification for informing, A Face in the Crowd is Kazan's attack on the men who perpatrated the Red Scare.  Rhodes becomes Kazan's horrific imagining of Joseph McCarthy.  It as if after justifying his own choice to name names, Kazan now wanted to make sure it was understood that he was still opposed to the excesses of the times.  All-in-all, its a self-centered way to view the power of cinema.  However, personal motivations aside, Kazan's need to justify himself produced at least two great films.  On the Waterfront is an acknowledged classic.  A Face in the Crowd deserves to be.",1007510400,135,4645,5.048492791612058
295212,4,6300273210,"This movie is half ""Jailhouse Rock"", half ""Rebel Without A Cause,""  and half ""Citizen Kane.""  It traces the rise and fall of Lonesome Rhodes, an opinionated jailbird guitar-strummer who is given his chance to make it big.  As seen on ""Behind the Music"" every week on VH-1, power first intoxicates, then makes drunk, and finally corrupts the person.
For those of us raised on ""The Andy Griffith Show"" or even as mild-mannered ""Matlock,"" Mr. Griffith's performance is absolutely STARTLING.  He comes across a being a Jerry Lee Louis on mescaline-crank cocktail.  I never knew he had it in him!
Patrician Neal, with her weary eyes, plays a good lead against Griffith, and the cinematographer more than earned his pay in using the black and white medium in creating emotion.  Walter Matthau shows that he had talent early on, and is not one whit behind the other actors.  This film has enough style to satisfy any Tarantino-oid film freak.
This film was very perceptive, as they talk about a politician's image, especially on TV.  Remember, this film came out in 1957, three years before the Kennedy-Nixon Debates which cemented-in TV as a political reality.  In fact, this film is TOO prophetic.
The cameos are a treat too, especially the semi-pubescent Mike Wallace!  I can't believe he was ever that young.",1004745600,11,1305,4.917808219178082
295213,5,6300273210,"Ask most film fanatics about their favorite Elia Kazan film and you will likely get ""On the Waterfront"" as your answer. Ask me and I can only answer ""A Face in the Crowd."" Were it not for the fact that Kazan was ""blacklisted"" by the Hollywood liberal elite for his supposed testimony (in which he named only those who were already named by others), this film might have swept the Academy Awards. As it was the film was virtually ignored -- Andy Griffith, who gave the performance of a lifetime, was not even nominated for Best Actor.
What makes this movie so great to watch is that its subject matter never goes out of date, based as it is on the power of television to manipulate and control the minds of viewers. Griffith stars as Larry Rhodes, a drifter awoken one monring in the local jail by Patricia Neal, who is looking for subjects for her morning radio show, ""A Face in the Crowd."" Assured by the sheriff that he'll be released if he performs, Rhodes grabs his guitar and puts on a show that lands him a regular job on Neal's radio show. Now known as ""Lonesome"" Rhodes, his combination of entertainer-philosopher quickly takes him from Arkansas to Memphis, where he meets Tony Franciosa (his first film), an agent who lands him in New York. Neal also goes along for the ride as Lonesome's manager; the movie's sub-text is the love Neal has for the Frankenstein monster she created, despite what he does to here time after time.
Brought to New York to pitch a worthless product call Vitajex on a variety show, Rhodes makes both the product and himself the biggest things since sliced bread. There is a hiliarious sequence of a bout three minutes during this scene of how Madison Avenue can manipulate the public into believing a worthless product is actually good for you. People I've shown this to sit there with mouths agape, dazzled by a sophistication rarely encountered in the movies.
Rhodes now comes to the attention of the product's sponsor who convinces him that not only is Rhodes an opinion maker, but that his untapped power should be used to make a Senate nonentity named J. Worthington Fuller into a viable presidental candidate. Rhodes takes the challenge, renaming the Senator ""Curly"" Fuller and featuring him on his new show, a sort of down home ""McLaughlin Group."" Rhodes's meglomania is completely out of control; his price for Fuller is a cabinet post as Secretary for National Morale. And he almost gets away with it, until Neal pulls the plug in a most unique manner.
It is left to Walter Matthau (also his first film) to deliver the epilogue: we have not seen the last of Lonesome Rhodes. He'll be back, with others just like him. A chilling prediction only too well borne out be subsequent events.
It's a shame this classic hasn't received more attention than it has. The message is timeless, the acting and direction flawless. There has been talk of a remake, but let's hope this doesn't come to fruition. It's perfect as is.",1003017600,11,2958,4.668582375478927
295254,5,6300273210,"Who'd have thought that Andy Griffith could give such a dark, powerful performance as this?  And at the very beginning of his career?  He demonstrates such a depth of spirit in this film that it's quite moving.  His portrayal of Lonesome Rhodes as a cynical, bitter drifter is frightening at times, as he pushes himself toward the chords of psychotic frenzy.
There are many great scenes in this film, but one of my favorite parts is near the beginning of the movie... when offered his first job on radio, Lonesome leans on the car with a casual evil, and spits onto the dusty ground.  Man, this ain't Sheriff Andy Taylor of Mayberry!
The ONLY place where the film lags slightly is in the 3 - 4 minute ""advertising"" section (you'll see what I mean).  They run through a variety of silly ads with Lonesome Rhodes pushing product.  It just runs a couple minutes too long there.  But this is a very very minor complaint, and it's the ONLY one I can come up with.
Bottom line:  this movie reminds me of Hitchcock and Rod Serling stuff.  Very cool movie.  It's an absolute GEM! And I love the ending.",1002585600,11,1094,4.47979797979798
295255,5,6300273210,"I watched this at night, close to midnight. As I was watching, I was thinking that this is far away from being the sheriff of Mayberry.
Andy Griffith plays a guitar-pickin' drifter. His rough manner actually scared me in some ways, but he was so into the role you'd think that he was really Lonsome Rhodes. This is the first time I actually felt sorry for the bad guy in a movie, usually when I see the villian in the story I would say that he's a jerk or an idiot, but the way Andy Griffith plays Lonesome, you'll sorry for him.
I'll admit I actually cried before I went to sleep in my bed, I felt so sorry for him, the ending is really sudden, believe me, you won't beileve that it it ends right there.",998006400,3,704,4.145985401459854
295256,4,6300273210,"Much of the commentary on this film suggests that it is as relevant to today's audience as it was to viewers in 1957.  I would never deny that the film is still worth seeing, but I'm not so sure it retains its original zing... or sting.
The film was made during TV's infancy, when the power of the new medium was beginning to be realized.  Writer Shulberg and Director Kazan no doubt felt that they were addressing an issue of real concern, and very likely they were.  I recall my own family having an awe of what they saw on the TV screen that is hard to find today.  But I do not believe they--or many of their contemporaries--were swayed by the medium to the extent that this film suggests.  And did Kazan and Schulberg ever realize the extent of the skepticism toward the media that the generations who grew up with television would eventually exhibit?  Well, perhaps with efforts like this, they could even claim some credit for that skepticism--presuming that that was the desired effect.
Still this movie has much to commend it.  Andy Griffith delivers a powerful performance as the egomaniacal TV-icon, ""Lonesome"" Rhodes.  He is a far cry from Mayberry...to say nothing of his character's mythic Riddle, Ark.  Patricia Neal, Tony Franciosa and Walter Matthau provide solid support, and a very young, captivating Lee Remick made her film debut here.  Kazan's direction keeps the sometimes heavy-handed story moving apace.  The film's power is ultimately only diminished by the fact that its message was well-heeded--at least by some.",980121600,2,1540,4.862068965517241

Among his co-stars are Patricia Neal, who plays his discoverer, mentor, lover and arch-nemesis and Walter Mathau, who plays one of his scene writers and the film's conscious.  The film is clever, frustrating, frightening and complex.  From the start, you will be drawn into the world of Lonesome Roads, philosopher, bum, America's voice and his own worst enemy.  It presents a true picture of fame and it's pitfalls but an even truer picture of what happens when a life is lived for the ""ends"" without concerning itself about the ""means.""

It also shows the manipulative power of television and how we are merely ""pawns"" under its grasp.

295259,5,6300273210,"Although this film was released in 1957, it is extremely relevant today.  The film is the most powerful statement (including ""Network"")  ever made on the power of television.  Andy Griffith (in his film debut)  turns in the performance of his career as Lonesome Rhodes, a hobo who is  discovered by Patricia Neal, who has a radio program in a small Arkansas  town.  Rhodes' charismatic charm and appeal drive him from a small radio  show to a Memphis television station to national folk hero.  Rhodes becomes  so powerful that he influences and controls everything he touches from  advertising to possibly even the next President of the United States.  It  soon becomes clear to Neal, who becomes his plaything, that Rhodes is  becoming obsessed with his newfound power.
This is a tremendous film  that has sadly been forgotten.  Griffith gave many good performances after  this, most of them much lighter, but never came close (and probably never  got the chance) to matching this role.
