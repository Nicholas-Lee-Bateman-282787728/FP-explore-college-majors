Directed by Victor Fleming

Jim Lane (Clark Gable) is a courageous test pilot, who compromises his achievements with his frequent bouts of drinking. Jim's mechanic, Gunner Morris (Spencer Tracy), does what he can to keep his boss out of trouble. While testing a new aircraft, Jim is forced to land on a Midwestern farm, where he meets and falls in love with Ann Barton (Myrna Loy). Jim and Ann marry, whereupon he is fired by his boss Howard B. Drake (Lionel Barrymore), who is of the opinion that flying and women don't mix. Whereupon Jim goes off on another bender, compelling Ann to leave him. Once more, Gunner comes to Jim's rescue by reuniting the couple and arranging for Drake to give Jim his job back. Later, Jim and Gunner are assigned to test a huge army bomber - The B-17: The Flying Fortress

439315,4,6302241219,"It is a simple story, really. Jim (Clark Gable) and Gunner (Spencer Tracy) are test pilots. They risk their lives for thrills and a quick buck. Jim loves women and Gunner loves Jim. Howard Drake (Lionel Barrymore) is their mentor, and he knows them through and through. He doesn't quite believe it when Jim marries Ann (Myrna Loy), a farmgirl from Kansas, but over time he realizes the true bond they have with each other. It is too bad Jim will never lose his love for the sky and the adrenaline rush he gets when he flies.

This weak storyline is carried off with great effect by the excellent cast. MGM boasted that it had more stars than were in the heavens, and they knew how to exhibit them. Gable is brash and masculine in his role, the perfect ladies man. Loy plays the part she always played, the perfect wife with an understanding heart. Tracy has the most difficult job here, because his character's love for his friend seems much more intense than that of a normal friendship. He balances the tricky situation brilliantly. Barrymore suffered greatly from his arthritis during this time period, so most of his scenes are done sitting down in cars, but it is nice to see him nonetheless.",1214956800,2,1197,4.593457943925234
439316,5,6302241219,"I just finished watching this movie tonight on TCM and immediately looked it up on Amazon to buy it on DVD but....it's not on DVD!  This movie was so good!  When you hear people say, ""they just don't make movies like this one anymore"" - this is one of those kind of movies!  The acting was incredible: Myrna Loy, Spencer Tracy and Clark Gable together make this movie so enjoyable and the storyline just draws you in.  I can't believe this one is not available on DVD - if you get a chance to catch this movie on television, don't miss it!",1185840000,9,539,4.254901960784314

439318,5,6302241219,"All I have to say is Spencer Tracy and Myrna Loy are superb actors.  With great actors, everything is automatic.  They don't have to pretend to be anything because the feeling is their own.  I love watching classic movies to observe actors and these two are among the most talented actors.  It's just to bad Ms. Loy never received an oscar because she is superb in any role she plays and every role is always believable.",1038096000,13,420,4.4868421052631575
439319,4,6302241219,"Among the planes used in this movie were the Army's huge new bombers, which were nicknamed ""Flying Fortresses"", which were, in 1938, probably the most powerful war planes on earth. The scenes in which they appear were shot at March Field, California with co-operation with the Army - doubles appeared (obviously) for the stars in dangerous scenes. This picture made the most out of a test pilot's daredevil life and the spectre of death which hung over one pilot (Clark Gable, natch), his wife (Myrna Loy) and his mechanic (Spencer Tracy). TEST PILOT got its title from a book written by one Jimmy Collins who was one of the ablest of test pilots during the thirties. One day in 1935, he was making what was to have been his last flight before retiring. Suddenly, in a power-dive, a wing sheared off; the whole craft fell apart in mid-air and Collins had not a chance to jump. The most suicidal occupation in the peacetime world sixty years ago was very likely that of a test pilot. The test pilot's job was to try out new planes af all models and see just what they can do. Sometimes they couldn't do all that the pilot asks of them; when that happened, it was a matter of jump of get killed. In 1938, there were approximately 100 test pilots in the US, most being between the ages of 20 and 30. They earned big money and lived high and hard - if not long! After a few years, they'd retire or adopt a fatalistic bravado like the hero of this MGM flick, who fancies himself as playing a game with a lady in a pretty blue dress, high above the earth.  One of the 15 top grossing films of 1938, it was nominated for Best Picture at the Venice Film Festival.",1005264000,27,1655,4.373376623376624

Nobody compares to Spencer Tracy, Clark Gable or Myrna Loy. I loved this movie. I am not a particular airplane enthusiast but I did love all of the action. I am a great fan of old movies and this one did not disappoint me in the least. I will watch it again.",1431561600,2,403,4.05
439409,5,6302241219,"Here is a movie made in 1938 by MGM aimed at the aviation enthusiast. It tells the story Jim, of a crack aviator/air racer/test pilot/and womanizer, portrayed by Clark Gable who had just become the #1 male star in Hollywood. His best pal is ""Gunner"", also his mechanic and conscience/advisor in many sticky situations is played by Spencer Tracy just after he had won his first Oscar and just before he would earn his second.  They are both vets of WWI and the aviation scene of the 1920s-the era of incredible advances and risks in the fiield of aeronautics. Myrna Loy portrays the farm girl Jim would marry and gradually break her heart and dash her hopes. We get to witness this against the background of the aerial feates of the thirties. The airplanes are all the real thing in close up shots and pretty good models for aerial scenes where the actual aircraft cannot be used. MGM was outstanding at the use of models and special effects through the 30s and 40s. This film show them at their best. The acting trio does a great job of dragging the viewer into the plot and at times to the edge of our seats, despite this being a now eighty year old motion picture. And being in the glorious colors of gray and white!
 For me, the opportunity to see actual aircrfat such as the Seversky P-35 racer, a Hall Bulldog, and the first motion pictures of the US Army Air Corps YB-17s in action, are the icing on the cake. Good story, good acting, great airplanes..who could ask for more???
  Amazon did their usual great job of providing this little gem to me. I expected no less!!!",1430524800,5,1576,4.480836236933798

439413,5,6302241219,this is one of Clark Gable and Myrna Loy best movies in my opinion Spencer Tracy rounds out the cast to make it very unique and special the relationship between these three people you cannot get better than this I'm a classic movie fan and I saw this movie years ago and it's taking a long time for it to come on DVD as soon as I saw that it was available I bought it because it's a keeper it's going you will watch over and over.,1417651200,2,430,3.954022988505747

439418,5,6302241219,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Test-Pilot/dp/B00KCDED8K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Test Pilot</a>&nbsp;has rapidly become one of my all-time favorites.  I challenge anyone to watch it when it comes on (too infrequently) on TCM and not be alternately thrilled, humored, moved and exhilarated.  Myrna Loy and Clark Gable play magnificently off of each other.  I believe Mrs. Loy said this was her favorite film of all the ones she's made (quite a statement!).

Clark Gable plays a true man's man, a genuine hero, but his character has more shades of gray than a popular S&M novel.  (It's also a very sexy movie.  The seduction scene between Loy and Gable is utterly unique and incredibly charming.)  There's also great, heart-pounding action.  But the character arc that Gable has to undergo is a glory to behold.  He goes, kicking and screaming all the way, from a completely independent, macho, man's man beholden to no one, to a... well, you have to see the movie for yourself.  You may think you know how it will go, but it takes more unpredictable twists and turns than a pilot-less plane falling out of the sky.

Now for the real point of this review:  Where is the dang DVD?!?  They make DVDs out of such dross these days, direct-to-video crappola.  Test Pilot had Clark Gable, Myrna Loy, Spencer Tracy (!), and the great one himself, Lionel Barrymore.  It was nominated for three Oscars, for crying out loud!  And not garbage Oscars but major categories like Best Screenplay (one of the best ever -- Frank Wead was the Ernest Hemingway of screenwriting), Best Editing, and even Best Picture!

A Blu-Ray would be even better, but I'd settle for a nicely remastered DVD, if you please.  I may just buy 10 all by myself, to hand out to friends as party favors, if that will encourage the copyright holder to press some discs.  So let's get pressing those DVDs!

EDIT:  June 2014:  Well, apparently Warner Archives listens to ""the people,"" because they've finally issued a nice DVD version of Test Pilot.  All praise to Warner for delivering the goods.  Next up:  Blu-Ray?

Just to clarify, I do not own a copy of the VHS version, but I recently bought the new DVD, which is wonderful.",1354924800,5,2226,4.964769647696477

For me, the part where Myrna Loy goes to a baseball game with Gable is priceless, partly because you just don't think of her this way! Reportedly, this was her favorite movie of the ones she did.

7822684,3,6302241219,"Overlong but entertaining MGM aviation drama relies on the effortless chemistry between Clark Gable, Myrna Loy and Spencer Tracy to salvage a humdrum script. Without Leo the Lion's star trio, ""Test Pilot"" (1938) would be an eminently forgettable affair.

7822686,1,6302241219,I am so surprised at the high marks for this movie.  Clark Gable's lifestyle did not lend itself to the type of person who would be a serious test pilot.  He is ridiculous.  Myrna Loy is so over the top that I wonder if Victor Fleming was even present when her scenes were filmed.  She is obnoxious.  Spencer Tracy is wasted.  He is melancholy.  I couldn't wait for this one to end so that I could take it to the Goodwill.  And who gets married the next day after meeting someone?  Too much.,1470096000,,491,4.193548387096774
