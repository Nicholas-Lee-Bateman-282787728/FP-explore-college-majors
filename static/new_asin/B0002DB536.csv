8026551,3,B0002DB536,Made for TV.  Shown once then obscurity.  Was supposed to be a pilot.  I own it on DVD.  One viewing was all I needed.,1436832000,,118,3.7916666666666665
8026552,3,B0002DB536,"this movie depicits how many journalist really are.  they donot support their countries.they want that 'big story' at all cost. they think they want to tell the truth, however, they do more harm to their country with their biased reporting than the enemy, in fact the american news media has been a great support to terrorist...

i liked the scenery,the actors were good and did a great job of protraying journalist,the characters read like a mike hammer book.  the terrorist were depicted as terrorist, the US was depictied as the bad guy killing women and children (who have been know to protect terrorist)....it is interesting to see movies that americans make to put down their country and these very people should move to china. maybe then they would be better american movie makers.

no good John Wayne patriotic  movies for 21st century americans.",1156550400,3,854,4.944055944055944
8026553,1,B0002DB536,"I had great anticipations for this movie, I hoped it would explain the middle eastern conflict in great detail.

I would learn about the moslem fundamentalism that went from fanatism to terroism. Unfortunately, the characters in the movie

were painted in a b-picture black and white fashion. The script

employed klischee's but no information. It seemed like the script writer has never touched foot in this area. It also had the feel of a formulated action - adventure movie, with some middle eastern flavor thrown in. And not even a suspenseful one.

The talent of Jeff Goldbloom was entirely wasted in this contraption of a movie. If you want to watch a good movies about

the middle eastern conflict, watch ""Bravo two zero"", ""The one that got away"", ""Kandahar"" , ""The Beast"", ""Marooned in Iraq""

and ""Kedma"". Do not waste your time and money on this b-picture.",1117238400,6,865,4.850340136054422
8026554,4,B0002DB536,"This was a very good TV movie about reporters, and how they cover the stories, while trying no to become the story. Jeff Goldblum was excellent as was the directing and the writing. I easley see this becoming a series if they want to.",1092614400,6,234,4.340909090909091
