6591718,1,B00MO21WOU,"honestly, I couldn't even make it half way through this movie, the main character is obnoxious to the point of exhaustion of the viewer. it seems like the type of self aware ""ironic humor"" is pretentious and stupid. the scene where the main character stands there telling a dude who is bleeding to death about how he dated a girl who was deaf but doesn't know sign language instead of going to try to get help or find a phone to call an ambulance and rambles at the guy until he dies seriously made me (actually) get up and walk away to do the dishes (I watch movies to procrastinate doing the dishes and dishes seemed favorable to watching anymore of this piece of crap film)",1458777600,,676,4.373015873015873

6591721,5,B00MO21WOU,"Finally a film I don't have to trash AND the lead character is a d-nozzle. This is how you write a crappy male character into a film, realistically. You don't rape women, you don't degrade people, you WRITE A FREAKING SCREENPLAY that isn't toilet paper. You'll find you can say everything you want to say without resorting to cheap exploitation when you have more than applesauce for brains, which this acting team and screenplay had. I liked this film very much. I did notice a few details that were obvi like the landlord, ""this has never happened before"", but then again, I bet that was a real landlord, and so kudos. Thanks for filming near my stop, thanks for being epic in all the ways an indy film can be.",1449792000,,712,4.484615384615385
6591722,5,B00MO21WOU,"Tukel's latest film is more than a hilarious, clever, sweet, weird, genre-bending flick.  It is beyond cinema, as all of the most interesting films are, meaning, it approaches something like the theater of the absurd, that sort of drama growing from Camus and exploring that constant heart-breaking yet exhilarating gap between what we want the world to be, and what the world is.  Blending the cynicism of Beckett, Jodorowsky's strange salvations, and Tarantino's wit, Summer of Blood is indeed as much life as art, life as it feels to live it--sad, ravenous, erotic, bloody, stupid, selfish, immature, innocent, hopeful.",1432080000,,622,5.2727272727272725

6591724,4,B00MO21WOU,"I think the film was relentlessly funny, which meant that I could really only watch it in 25 minute chunks. I understand that once you have the opportunity to get funding and actors this good, you want to throw every brilliant bit in, but the film winds up lacking a dramatic arc. There are moments of real tenderness in here, but the film lacks confidence in/patience with them. I'm confident that the director's next one will be better.",1426896000,,438,4.628205128205129

6591726,2,B00MO21WOU,"About fifteen to twenty minutes into SUMMER OF BLOOD, Erik Sparrow -- our chubby, fast-talking protagonist -- talks about how he hopes some day to do the ""auteur thing"" and write, direct and star in his own feature length film. Erik is played by Onur Tukel, who also wrote, directed, and edited the movie. This kind of humor -- watered-down self-awareness that stopped being clever in the nineties -- is emblematic of the entire film, which probably would've worked a lot better as a piece of sketch comedy than drawn out to an hour and a half.

The film follows Erik (I don't know why he didn't just call the character Onur, since it's obvious he's playing himself) as he is dumped by his girlfriend after glibly rejecting her marriage proposal. Why she would want to marry him (or why she's been with him for three years) isn't ever explained, since Erik is a rude, selfish, and dismissive man. ""You're fundamentally incapable of taking things seriously,"" one of his coworkers complains. The script tries to detract from these massive character flaws by mining them for humor; Erik stream-of-consciousness rambles like he's trying to be the Turkish version of Woody Allen. But it feels -- ironically -- both like he's trying too hard and not trying hard enough. The energy he spends on his monologues is overwrought, like he's riffing high-speed to find the right funny moment, but he doesn't ever spend enough of that energy on actually coming up with anything interesting or clever to say or do.

Even the film's basic plot point isn't utilized very well. The gag is that Erik is detested by every girl he tries to date until a vampire attacks him, turning him into another bloodsucker of the night. Suddenly Erik is a sexual dynamo. In fact, other than the ability to kinda-sorta hypnotize people with his eyes and a hatred of sunlight, that's the primary change caused by his vampirism: he can suddenly have the kind of bedroom antics most men only dream about. Like everything else in the flick, this isn't taken too seriously, but it becomes such a side-step to the main plot that it ends up reeking of wish fulfillment anyway.

Again, though, it's not like there's a whole lot of main plot to begin with. The script (I use the word loosely; a lot of this movie feels improvised) takes half-hearted stabs at social, religious, and relational commentary, but none of them land very well. This is mainly because the movie's primary source of humor is just how little Erik/Onur cares about any of the things he's doing or talking about. He spews jokey rhetoric at the drop of a hat, but is constantly contradicting himself, backtracking, and half-shrugging/half-smiling no matter what he's talking about, whether it's the films of Tyler Perry or his fear of Middle Eastern men with backpacks.

Even when he is turned by a vampire, it is because the vampire asks him, ""Do you want to die?"" and Erik basically just moves his head back and forth and says, ""Meh. I guess. It'd mean fewer responsibilities."" In small doses, that kind of attitude might make for a fun and interesting jumping off point, but this movie never once strays from that exact same platform: a kind of faux-ironic, hipsterish apathy that ends up making the whole flick feel like one big ""who cares?""",1414540800,5,3273,4.757042253521127
6591727,4,B00MO21WOU,This guy needs to die to change but does he really change?  I think he's still a selfish a$$ in the end.  It is an entertaining story until the end.  I think they should have taken a little more time on that.,1414454400,,208,3.9047619047619047

8673430,5,B00MO21WOU,"Wow!  Summer of Blood is NOT your typical vampire movie!  The writing is VERY different from any vampire movie you could ever imagine!  The atmosphere, the writing and especially the main character (Onur Tukel) makes this film more like some kind of unintentional/intentional comedy.

The best way to describe Onur Tukel's character is that he's a lot like Peter from Family Guy.  He talks a lot, seems like a nice guy at first... but ultimately puts his foot in his mouth time and time again.  He's a *brilliant* character.  I love this movie and he's almost entirely the reason why.  When his wife (Anna Margaret Hollyman) proposes to Onur at an outside restaurant while the two are having dinner (wait what, women can propose to their boyfriends?) Onur... isn't interested!  He seems interested at first, but continues talking and elaborating on why it wouldn't work out.  She's disappointed at first but eventually gets downright angry and storms out of the restaurant.  Very Arrested Development-like humor if I do say so!  While watching this scene I had to ask myself ""What woman would EVER be interested in a guy like Onur!""

The actual vampire portion of this movie takes a while to get going.  For a while Onur tries dating 3 different women, but they all have ""issues"" that Onur finds unappealing.  Onur brings one woman home on a date, and she mentions women's rights. Onur criticizes her like the obnoxious little jerk he is.  She gets up and leaves.  You have to see Summer of Blood to understand what makes a scene like this so hilarious!  My attention was completely on the TV screen.  Another woman is sexually experienced, and Onur... well he comes up a little short if you know what I mean.  While in bed this woman and Onur have a detailed conversation about it.  More funnies!

For whatever reason Onur's only somewhat sensible when talking to the *very* cute Dakota Goldhor at work.  He mentions a sexual situation one time, and she points at him and says ""Isn't that a dirty word?""  She's not the least bit interested in sexual talk so she finds this hilarious (as do I!)  Meanwhile Onur is a bum who doesn't take his job seriously and often gets into disagreements with the boss.  I'm really surprised he didn't fire Onur sooner!

One night Onur sees a man lying on the ground with his neck bitten.  Onur ""helps"" the poor guy by not taking it seriously.  A lot happens here I can't recall.  I think Onur tries using the guy's phone for help but can't do it for reasons that aren't coming to me.  Instead Onur heads down the sidewalk and has a conversation with two men about how much Onur resembles Jerry Garcia, lol.  He says ""I get that a lot!""  Then shortly after he's introduced to Anna's new boyfriend.  The two... don't exactly like each other at all.  If I recall Onur's either drunk or so tired he can't think straight which adds more to the mixed feelings the boyfriend has.

While in a dark alley one night Onur stumbles into a strange man who has the power to turn people into vampires.  Of course he first has to wait around and listen to Onur's sarcastic conversation about how he hates life and his job.  Hilarious how Onur has trouble deciding if he wants to become a vampire which confuses the strange man, lol!  The part where he mentions he doesn't trust Middle Eastern folks even though he himself is Middle Eastern is hilarious.  After biting Onur on the neck, Onur walks around town hooking up with an old apartment mate and takes turns biting random people on the necks, and also biting the necks of the girls he failed on those dates.  I like when all 3 women are in bed with Onur at the same time, haha.

About the boyfriend of Anna Margaret Hollyman.  Onur hates this man.  He's a total sarcastic jerk to him, and you know, the boyfriend's a pretty big jerk himself so he probably deserves it.  Anytime Onur and the boyfriend cross paths you can expect lots of humor... and maybe even a bite or two!  Onur continues to contact Anna throughout the movie to see if she'll have a change of heart.  The final moment of the movie with Anna, Dakota and Onur in an apartment room is gross, but brilliant.

Seriously a brilliantly written movie.  I've never seen anything like it before.  Take the writing style of Arrested Development, the character of Peter Griffin from Family Guy, give it a vampire theme, and you end up with this gross vampire comedy horror thing!",1484697600,,4410,4.591025641025641
