1394589,5,B000055ZGP,"This is great. First of all I love Tamilee's ""no fluff"" style, she is concise and to the point. This is a great toning video that I do on days when I'm not doing aerobics. The first workout hits all the major muscle groups, the second is weak on abs, but hits everything else, and with the workouts being only 15 minutes each, I usually do some additional toning exercises or videos to round it out. Very good video!",1010102400,5,416,4.2784810126582276
1394590,5,B000055ZGP,"I'm 7 months pregnant and have been looking for videos that I can do in short blocks of time, and this one is perfect.  I've been a fan of Tamilee's for quite a while and have several of her tapes, all of which are great.  She's very motivating and encouraging, and I like the fact that she really has a good background (education-wise) when it comes to fitness. This one is no exception.  Just a warning - if you are looking for complete body toning or cadrio, you won't find it here: this one just hits the main areas (legs, biceps, triceps, shoulders, butt and abs).  But that doesn't mean it's easy!  I found myself sweating just doing a few of the exercises (even before I became pregnant) and I'm in fairly good shape.  I'd recommend doing this video and interspersing it with other longer, total body sculpting videos.",995500800,12,825,4.503355704697986
1394591,2,B000055ZGP,"brand new tape (2001)....this tape was not what i expected...i thought it was an aerobic workout or at least a workout video but it is two 15 minute target toning sessions combining arms, abs, legs, buns all together.if you have her indivisual tapes like buns of steele, abs of steele, and thighs of steele, then stick with those. this tape has alot harder moves and tons of lunges which are kind of stenous to my knees. one thing i did like, however, is that it involves using weights when toning your arms. its not the worst tape but it's definitely not the best.",981504000,17,565,4.495145631067961

1394654,5,B000055ZGP,"I find that I get bored with even ""quick"" 30 minute workouts, so I always go back to this old DVD. Who doesn't have 15 minutes? I love the fast results this workout gives me in such a short amount of time. I feel like it's equivalent to the 30-60 minute workouts because Tami Lee goes from one exercise to the next without resting or telling you to stop to ""write it down"". Who has time for that?!  The arm and bun workouts are awesome with weights. I tighten my abs while doing the arm and bun workouts, just like she instructs you to do, so I don't do the ab workouts as often. My body responds very well to these workouts. My husband notices how the buns workouts ""plump"" up my backside in a good way. Lol.

1394656,1,B000055ZGP,"I hated this workout. So much repetition. I always marvel at why there isn't more variety in some workouts. If I do a set of bicep curls, I don't want to go back 5 minutes later and do them again. And even worse, a THIRD time 5 minutes later. The abs and buns were also repetitive, though not as bad as the arms. So disappointed, especially after doing her ""Best of Tamilee"" series, which I loved. In those workouts, she doesn't return to the same exercises over and over.",1478304000,,472,4.314606741573034

1394720,5,B000055ZGP,"This is one of my all time favorite workouts that I've had for years. I used to do it on a regular basis but have so many workouts that I have workout ADD. But no matter what new and shiny workouts attract my attention, this one remains a staple for me. I like that it can be done in a small space. I used to do it in a small section of my bedroom in my apartment when the living room wasn't available or I just wanted to be alone. The space is not an issue for me at this time, but just thought I'd mention it for someone who doesn't have a lot of space available to work out in.
There are 2 levels each for abs, arms & buns (which is the section I like the best). So you're getting 6 separate 15 minute workouts, complete with short warm-up and short cool-down. The 2nd section of each category is the advanced version. I don't know how hard it would be for a truly advanced exerciser, because I've never been one. When I've been working out on a regular basis, I can do level two but when I've been slacking, I stick to level one. Especially for the abs, that one is tough and kills me every time. But then I've never enjoyed working my abs. None of the moves are crazy and are classics but they are sequenced in a way that is really effective. At the beginning, she says that the moves are all tested in a lab to determine which ones work the muscles the most. I believe her because I always feel it the next couple of days!
Tamilee excels, to me, at working the buns. I usually use a step along with the workout because I feel it in my glutes more when doing the forward lunges and it feels better for my knees. During the back lunges, I stand on the step and step back off the step. I think the ""Buns"" section is the one I use the most.
You can increase the weight because she doesn't move very fast but I think the highest I've used is 8 or 10lbs. I like the feeling of strength in my body using weights on a regular basis but if you are more concerned with visible results, don't worry you'll get them. This workout really firmed up my shoulders and arms and I found myself touching them a lot. And wanting to wear sleeveless shirts, go figure. It also flattened my abs (no six-pack though, I'll never work that hard or have low enough body fat, haha). It made my glutes rounder and more lifted. They grew too but squats and lunges always work that way for me, especially when using a step.
Now that I think about it, I don't recall any focused work for the chest, back, hamstrings or calves. But I also do kettlebell workouts so the posterior chain is worked in those and I do vary my workouts anyway.
I was already a fan of Tamilee Webb from Buns of Steel 3 and 4. I like her personality; she is not annoyingly perky or loud but is still friendly and encouraging. I will never, ever let this one go and if something happens to this DVD, I would definitely buy another copy.",1462320000,7,2883,4.131672597864768

1394722,4,B000055ZGP,"As a junior in highschool, I was diagnosed with Hypothyroidism - and because of it, I put on a lot of weight in a short amount of time. It totally killed me to just keep gaining when I wasn't overeating. As a 16 year old, you don't want to gain 80 lbs and be the fat girl in the school. At this point, Torrid wasn't out yet, Lane Bryant didn't really put out anything a high school student would want to wear. I was felt trapped, feeling like I was going to be one of those women that has to wear Tweety Bird sweatshirts or one of those t-shirts with a kitten hanging from a branch and across the stomach area of the shirt, it says 'Hang in There'.  Just the thought of that killed me.

Once I graduated and had a job, I had my own money to spend on food and whatever else I wanted to buy. Due to my work schedule, it was hard to make it to a gym (and way too pricy). After doing a quick search, I came up with 2 different workout DVDs I felt would be just what I needed to exercise in the privacy of my own home. I was still living at home, so I watched this on my laptop and was able to workout right in my bedroom. I didn't need a ton of space to work my butt off - which was a huge plus.

The DVD worked without any problems. No skipping or sound issues. It did it's job. If you're looking or something that's just basic exercising, nothing too crazy, this is a great workout. You don't need to already be in killer shape to keep up with Tamilee and her routines.",1456876800,4,1467,3.949324324324324

I do switch it up with some with Jillian Michaels workouts, Brazilian Butt Lift, I also play tennis regularly, so I consider myself to be intermediate to semi-advanced. What I love about the workouts is that they're quick, so no excuse not to fit in 15 minutes, and it's still challenging after all these years. The moves are easy to follow and produce results. The bun workout, especially the level 1, still kicks my butt. I have increased my weights from 5 to 8 pounds on the arm segments. I get lots of compliments on my toned arms and abs.

1394787,4,B000055ZGP,"I love this workout video!  I always get a good workout from Tamilee Webb.  She's very clear about the ""why"" and ""how"" for the exercises, which helps me use correct form.  The ""buns"" portion of the DVD is my favorite -- I am thoroughly sore after using both program 1 and program 2.  I will say that I am more sore in my quads (no matter how I try to put my weight in my heels, as she instructs) after using program 1.  Program 2 I feel it more in my ""buns.""  I've also done both arm workouts and felt ""the burn"" with the triceps exercises she uses.

Just like her other exercise videos I've done (Buns of Steel), the warm-ups are a little cheesy, but you're warmed up. :)  I also don't care for the music, but I don't know of too many exercise videos that have decent workout music, so that's not really a criticism of *this* video, just workout videos in general.

I do think she mentions ""testing in the lab"" a little excessively, but the selling point of this particular workout is that she literally tested the exercises in a science lab and even has a few short videos showing the testing, so I can't be too annoyed about that.

My one criticism: She talks about adding hand weights to make some exercises more challenging, but there is no ""back-up exerciser"" (for lack of a better term) to give the viewer a visual example of how to use hand weights.  I would appreciate a little more guidance concerning how to use them.  I give the review 4 stars for this reason only.",1422662400,3,1477,4.311594202898551

Shame really as I had purchased this DVD specifically for the arms workout - and got stuck with the abs (which I hate as my core isn't as strong and working it is HARD!)

1394811,4,B000055ZGP,"Fitness DVDs today are a dime a dozen.  Everywhere you look there's some rehashed workout or over sold diet craze being pushed as ""new"", ""exciting"" and ""effective"" - ugh.  And I'm sure for some they work.  But I personally get a headache sifting through all the ""new"" which leaves me less than ""excited""  :\  That's not to say I haven't added to my workout DVD collection over the past 10 years but more often than not I fall back on the tried and true.  I mean; be honest.  How many perky, size 0, 20 year old's with a fake tan can an everyday woman/mother take before she says - Fudge it.  I'm out!  Where's my can of Reddi Whip?  LOL  Having said that, I Want That Body isn't for beginners.  If you ARE a beginner; there's a learning curve.  Some of the movements are a little fast but the moves are simple and the instruction is relatively easy to follow.  Keep at it and before you know it you'll be - out of breath and sore as h**l but - keeping up.  There are three separate 15 minute (short and sweet) workouts, one for Arms, one for Abs and one for Buns.  Each workout is broken up into a set of two, the second in each set being progressively harder (not necessarily more difficult) than the first.  The workouts are primarily for toning, but they're also great for improving balance (faboo for those of us over the age of 35) and far more aerobic than you might first believe.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the production quality on the original 2001 DVD release is kinda low, can't speak for the re-release, and the music is very meh (I prefer to listen to my own and so might you once you get the routines down).  But above all the workouts are EFFECTIVE -- no glitz, no glamor, no 20yr. old professional dancer shaking her booty in a way only a 20yr. old professional dancer could -- (if you stick with them) the workouts just work!

**As a side note; most of these DVD's have a warm up session as well as a cool down, but regardless of, I highly suggest you warm up a bit on your own .. jog in place for a minute or jump rope or do a set of jumping jacks .. then stretch from neck to toe before starting ANY workout (even those on a DVD) to prevent muscle injury.  It's an ounce of prevention, especially for those of us over 35 who can't afford a private trainer and don't have a workout buddy that day.  The older you are the easier it is to injure yourself.

If you agree with me and want to give ""tried and true"" a shot, I also have the following (some for beginners, which I've found can be a nice change of pace for those not too jaded by ""been there/done that"", and some not) in my collection:-

If you've never tried Pilates you should. And if you're thinking about trying a PILATES DVD give Ana Caban a shot before trying other more popular names. You won't be sorry ...

1394833,5,B000055ZGP,"This video is great if you have certain areas you want to focus on.  There are 3 sections - arms/abs/legs and then 2 workouts for each section.  Each workout is about 15 minutes long so if you want a quick workout these are great! If you have a little more time you can combine them.  Very effective workouts! If you are looking for a full body aerobic video, there are better ones out there, but this is the best I have found for targeting a specific area.",1373760000,,457,4.2298850574712645

1394835,5,B000055ZGP,"Tamilee is one of my most favorite TV trainers!
These work-outs are short but give you a good run for your money. I like to do two at a time or one in addition to my running.
If you're short on time, or it's late, it's also easy to squeeze in just one work-out then you won't feel as badly as you would if you'd have skipped it altogether.",1365379200,,339,3.927536231884058
1394836,5,B000055ZGP,Tamilee is very professional and personable - it is easy to follow program that targets different parts of your body.  Combined with some cardio it could be a low cost home training program.,1362700800,,190,4.757575757575758

I believe that the core is a group of muscles that should be exercised together, rather than individual muscles that should be exercised individually, which is what it feels like this DVD tends to do.  But for the arms and legs (and I feel that the leg workout really works the core anyway), it is my favorite.",1353801600,,422,4.197530864197531

At just 15 min per body part, I hardly have an excuse not to do a workout.  After struggling with my knees, I feel that Tamilee taught me  how to excercise and not cause more problems.",1339372800,,347,4.0588235294117645
1394841,4,B000055ZGP,"I really like the workout but I hate how they have this boring introduction about how the workout was developed in lab, blah blah blah before every single chapter.
Couldn't they just put it at the beggining once instead of making you watch it over and over again?
Maybe it's my dvd player that's messing up somehow but it really bothers me.
By the time I manage to skip through the whole thing I'm starting to lose my rhythm and not so eager to do another set.
Also, if you are planning on doing more than one of the segments, you gotta watch / do the warm up over and over again. No ""play all"" as a sequence option.
I'll save this dvd for the days I'm short on time can only do one of the 15 min workouts or I'd use it just before I do something else like cycling.
If I could rate it in detail, I'd give the workout 5 stars and the production of the dvd 2 stars. That said, I'd say, overall, 3 1/2 stars.",1331251200,,905,4.033333333333333

1394863,5,B000055ZGP,"Tamilee Webb has a well-toned body, not some unrealistic bone-thin waif. She is matter-of-fact, explains the science and method behind her programs (even shows the infrared proof to back up the effectiveness of her programs - if you want to see it). But, you can also just get right into the work out. She is not one of those annoyingly overly perky types nor does she condescend.

The workouts are very effective, they can really challenge you, they get results and yet, they are short and fast. You can do just 10 or 15 minutes a day and see changes. You can decide to just do abs or just butt or just arms... she has a beginning program, she includes more advanced modifications to intensify it, and then she provides an advanced program when that one gets too easy. Love it!

I have owned it for years. A friend of mine was looking for a workout to target her butt and stuff. I got this for her as a gift and she loved it. A year later and she's still finding it challenging and enjoying it.",1318982400,,995,4.344086021505376
1394864,5,B000055ZGP,"I so rarely write reviews.  I love Tamilee Webb, her exercises leave me feeling great and you can feel it the next day, but in a good way.  I am 27 years old and with life getting super busy I stopped going to the gym and had gained some unwanted weight. I have tried other workout videos, but I fell in love with this one.  This video gives you 2 levels of abs, arms, and buns.  Although they are short it works out the muscle groups I need. I have been using the level 2 workout for the last month and a half and I am seeing more definition in my arms and shoulders, I love it.  She has you use hand weights for that workout and you increase the weights accordingly. I have also noticed that my midsection is slimming down. This is great also if your short on time you can alternate between them, you don't have to do it all in one day.  Another plus is Tamilee herself, she is encouraging and motivating in the video with out sounding like a boot camp Sargent. To each their own, but I prefer her style over others and have seen the improvements in my body.",1314230400,5,1060,4.121359223300971
1394865,5,B000055ZGP,"I bought this DVD a few years ago and never used it. I HATE workout DVDS...some perky, perfect lady telling me how good it feels to do 8 more reps... I just want to punch the TV screen.

4 months ago I gave birth to my first child and became motivated to exercise (baby belly!) I have been doing all 3 Program 1 workouts for 2 weeks now. I love this DVD. Tamilee is not an annoying host -  she motivates me and encourages me - I think she knows right about the time I feel like giving up. The first time I did the Abs workout, I felt like I'd just had a c-section, oh it hurt for a few days but it got easier! I think the buns workout hurt a lot worse but don't give up!! And if you can't do all the reps, she even tells you , do what you can to start and work your way up.

I look forward to doing the workouts everyday. I am feeling a lot better and have started losing a little bit of the weight. The DVD is not flashy, loud, obnoxious, or fancy. But the exercises are tried and true and if you stick with it, you will see results.

I love these workouts because they are 15 minutes long, just enough to feel great and not worn out (I do have a baby to care for all day!) also the short time means no excuse to not do it, easy to do while the baby naps or is playing.

I think what I like the best is that this series is not unrealistic. You are not going to lose 10 lbs in one week. You are not going to see results tomorrow. Those are the workouts that make us give up, they promise us things that are not possible/realistic/healthy. These workouts make you WORK and that's how you will get in shape. They make me feel like I want to exercise (totally a first for me)

Give it a try!",1313625600,6,1688,3.8924418604651163
1394866,5,B000055ZGP,"I came across this dvd at my library.  I love it!  I ended up buying it and have faithfully been doing the first bun workout for months now.  The first time I did the workout I could not finish, it was so tough.  I persisted and now do the workout with 5-8 pound dumbbells.  The most amazing thing about this video is that every time I do the workout, I am sore.  I love that I can feel the results each time.  Even though I do this about twice a week, I always get sore.  My husband is loving the results as well.

I have done the arms and abs workouts and think they are good as well.  I have not been as devoted to these but when I do the second ab workout I am so sore the next day in places I don't remember being sore.  I give this dvd the highest rating and recommend it to everyone.  I love that each body part is only 15 minutes long but packed full of great exercises.  I have never loved an workout video more.  Awesome job, Tammilee, you do know a lot about working the  buns.",1310083200,,988,3.9441624365482233

Tamilee is: fun, sweet, very watchable, great voice, great presence.
The exercises on this are fantastic. Like other people say, they really work!!! You will start feeling and seeing results afer a week. They are really focused and concentrated to get the most out of the work out. I love the arms and the buns.
I am only on the part Ones and I can already feel the difference. It is so great that there are TWO work outs so you can really challenge yourself.
I just can't say enough good things about Tamilee.",1309824000,,738,4.316546762589928
1394868,5,B000055ZGP,"I borrowed this DVD from my friend before I bought it. I was really skeptical about it at first, but instantly fell in love with it!  I was in pretty good shape before starting the video (not as good as Tamilee) but I work out on a regular basis running, lifting etc. For a couple years now I have being following Jorge Cruise 8 minutes in the morning workouts which helped give me some tone, however doing Tamilees workouts gave me more tone in three weeks than Jorge has in two years! It has been amazing! If you are trying to lose a lot of weight or are very obese you will need more than this video to help you get in shape and you will probably be disappointed (For you, I would recommend checking out Mr. Jorge Cruise first). However, if you are average BMI and looking for tone and muscles, this will work for you! Three times a week and you are golden! Although, you probably won't be able to sit for a few days after during the first lower body workout, it is worth it because you will get easy and FAST results!",1308182400,2,1021,4.209183673469388
1394869,5,B000055ZGP,"I don't think I've ever written a review on Amazon before, but this workout warrants one from me. I bought this DVD when I was 17 and have been doing it since (I'm 25 now).

I've never gotten any results from any other workout DVDs but this one. It's amazing! I've seen a HUGE difference and can feel a huge difference after my work outs.

And I should mention that I get bored super-easily! The 15-min workout is awesome. She talks through the whole thing, which ends up distracting you for most of the time anyway.

So, to summarize:

* Can do this work out for years and still think it's awesome
* 15-min workouts make it easy to keep up with
* Doesn't get boring
* Will notice a difference if you keep it up
* Not hokey
* DOES NOT REQUIRE any equipment other than hand weights
* They're not tough; anyone can do them!

Anyhow, just thought I'd share. Whenever I want to get into better shape, I always go back to this DVD. I have yet to find another like it!",1303776000,6,962,4.178378378378379

Best buns I've had ever! there are 3 parts and each one has two 15 minute segments. You will need hand weights & for second buns segment ankle weights when you are ready for them.
1st is abs section - then arms section - the buns section. each one can be done separate from others. I got rid of other workout DVD's I owned after using this one a few times. It is tops for short workout and best results. If you are beginner than start with light hand weights & go up to 10 lbs. when you can. I am in best shape from doing only this DVD. Do each section twice a week & rotate around every couple weeks. Best one out there - hands down. You won't be disappointed.",1300838400,3,805,4.094936708860759
1394871,4,B000055ZGP,"I've had this DVD for close to four years now and it is a perennial favourite. I only turn it on about once a fortnight now, but it still is on regular rotation.

Pros:

- Has Tamilee in it. She is a great role model and a great instructor. She is very cheerful and does not annoy me even if I have her DVD on every day (rotating between the segments, of course).

- Combines strength training and cardio - everything is done at a fairly fast pace (yet see 'Cons' below).

- The Buns 1 program rocks! I've yet to see anything as challenging and as rewarding as that little 15 minute segment.

Cons:

- The pace is quite challenging at times. Beginners will feel compelled to cut corners and compromise form for speed. Tamilee doesn't remind you much of proper form for exercises - the emphasis is on keeping up with her. Resist this and SLOW DOWN if you are resuming exercise after a long break - I didn't and in the early days managed to pull a hamstring muscle during the Buns 1 program and then throw out my back during the Abs 2 program. I learned my lesson after that.

- The programs target just a subset of muscles, not the whole body. It doesn't matter as much with the Buns programs, as while doing the squats you'd be strengthening your quads, your hamstrings, and to some extent even your ankles as you do the squats and lunges. But it does matter with the Arms and Abs segments!

- The Abs 1 program targets exclusively abs, there are no lower back strengthening exercises. If you use this DVD as the mainstay of your strength training regime, you'll develop an imbalance of these two areas. And then you progress to Abs 2 and all of a sudden you need to use your lower back muscles as well as your abs to get off the floor, and if you haven't strengthened them already, you're going to hurt yourself.

- Same with the Arms program: Arms 1 goes for biceps, triceps, and a little bit of the shoulders. No attention whatsoever is given to upper back muscles or even posterior deltoids. I have since discovered pilates and corrected this imbalance, but I wish more thought was given to it when designing this DVD.

The cons section is a lot longer than the pros, ahem, I don't know how that came about. It still is a solid 4 stars DVD - it's great if you just want to target specific muscles, not so great if you use it as your only source of strength training guidance in addition to cardio exercise elsewhere.",1300752000,5,2420,4.334070796460177
1394872,1,B000055ZGP,"I purchased this dvd because of the reviews i read on amazon.com. SORRY I did that. Tamilee acts like we all have bodies like her now. She goes to fast and even though there are 3 different workouts, one for arms, abs and buns, you can't chose to do three in a row. You can do one and then go out and chose another and so on. It is just too much trouble and time consuming to workout with her. Not to mention the poor quality. This dvd sucks in my opinion. I hate that I wasted my money on this.
Sorry Tamilee but you don't get my vote on this dvd.",1298332800,7,548,3.9017857142857144
1394893,4,B000055ZGP,"This would be a good video for beginner/intermediate exercisers BUT it includes no exercises for the chest and back, which is a horrible oversight! Working large muscle groups like chest and back is much more important than doing bunches of biceps & triceps isolation work. However, the abs sections, especially the 2nd one, are worthwhile even for advanced exercisers. If you are comfortable adding your own chest & back work, this would be a decent beginning program for those who need a video to get them started. Just be sure to do chest and back BEFORE any other upper body work (shoulders, biceps and triceps.)",1294876800,2,616,4.876190476190477

1394895,5,B000055ZGP,"Pros: Tamilee is an excellent, knowledgeable instructor. She has realistic viewpoints on fitness. She goes at an easy pace, and tells you exactly which muscle groups you should be working. I really appreciate it when she tells you details like to push down with your heel instead of the ball of your feet to relieve pressure from your knees. Her workouts are simple but they work! I wasn't too out of shape in the first place (5'2'', about 110 lb), but it took a few tries to get through all the Part I workouts! The Part II workouts will really bust your butt, but she tells you ways to make workouts more challenging if needed. I was always sore the next day after trying a new workout of hers.

Cons: The workouts consist of a handful of moves that are generally run through twice. To me, it wasn't a bad thing, but just a FYI. As said in the Pros section, they do work, at least.

There's this weird music during the ab section that sounds like cats screeching, lol.",1290211200,2,970,4.383333333333334

I actually like the Level 2 workouts better than Level 1 (though I did enjoy those also). I've been using this for three years and I'm ordering a 2nd copy just to have as a backup---that's how much I use this DVD...and my abs, especially, are AWESOME, even after two kids, and yes, one was c-section; you'd never know now.",1287705600,,454,4.218390804597701

Other than that, I do like the leg exercises, a little heavy on the squats in the beginning, but definitely some different/less common leg exercises that really work the buns well.",1286755200,5,375,4.449275362318841

I started out doing one 15 minute workout each day and now I am doing all 3 - abs, arms, and buttocks.  I would highly recommend this cd.",1285545600,,405,3.902439024390244
1394899,5,B000055ZGP,"Who wouldn't want her body?  She was amazing back then, and still amazing now.  I remember her from the old Abs of Steel videos and decided to try this new DVD based on reviews.  I like her presence.  She is very upbeat and encouraging without being annoying. (I'm not a big fan of the Jillian Michael""s drill sergeant approach--just doesn't work for me).

This video is amazing!  I have been doing it just for two days and already see results.  I like that you can customize the workouts.  I do both abs programs and one arms and one buns for an hour total workout.

The abs sections are killer!!!  You will feel the burn and there are some new moves here to keep it interesting and challenging.  Beware, there is some techno music in this one that sounds like an unhappy cat--it took me a few minutes to realize that it was coming from the DVD, and not outside the window.

The arms sections are what I do at the gym anyway, just with a ""trainer"" in a structured way so it works for me.  I found that having a variety of weights was helpful as some moves are harder then others.

The second buns program was a little difficult for me to follow (I like program 1 better).  I'm sure with repetition I'll get it down. The buns program works the legs in general including the thighs.

Overall a fantastic DVD that delivers.  I've done it twice and have already seen results and feel stronger. I can't wait to see what happens when I use it consecutively for awhile.  Way to go Tamilee!",1284422400,2,1483,4.350364963503649
1394900,5,B000055ZGP,"Back in the day, I swore by the VHS ""of Steel"" series.  But since VHS became antiquated, the workouts were considered, by most, ridiculous, too.  We traded in Tamilee's traditional exercises for Pilates or Zumba or whatever.  After I let my body go, I started working out again at age 30. Since I just wasn't getting the results I wanted from the gym, I worried perhaps I just couldn't get in the same shape I was at 20.  As a last ditch effort, I found the ""I Want That Body"" series on DVD.  I canceled my gym membership, bought some hand weights, and focused on performing the Abs series on MWF and the Arms and Buns on TRS.  Good Lord!  The results were almost immediate.

Tamilee is like your own personal trainer, and she knows exactly how to get you in shape FAST.  She is amazing!  Forget all the new-fangled workouts!  In fifteen minutes per workout, Tamilee will get you looking better than you ever have before.  These workouts are HARD.  If you're not in shape, you'll find yourself struggling to get through them.  But at the same time, because they're only 15 minutes, you never feel burdened by having to do them.  It's fabulous!

Between Miss Webb and the LiveStrong website for counting calories, I lost 10 lbs in five weeks!

1394914,4,B000055ZGP,"I borrowed this from my local library last week, and so far, I'm impressed.
This is my introduction to Tamilee and the whole Buns of Steel empire (I've previously used Tae Bo, and Janis Saffell), and I can definitely feel results.

The science intro portion of each workout (abs, arms, and buns are separated into chapters) is the same for each one, so I skip them (I've never been much for science, anyway). Each workout has two parts, the second part being more difficult than the first.

I haven't SEEN results just yet in my arms, but I can feel that the muscles have been worked. I've only done the abs a couple of times (I have trouble with my abs--the only places I ever feel the work are my neck, shoulders, and hips), but the buns portion is unlike any bun work I've ever done! There are plenty of lunges and squats to work your muscles and get your heart rate up, but the one that really kills me is the sumo. I was very sore after I did part one of the bun work--it may take me a while to get to the harder work on part two.

In addition to the workouts and science, you have the option of seeing the moves from different angles. There's also a fitness quiz, and a 10-day meal plan to jump-start your weight loss.

I would very much like to have this in my collection. :D",1263340800,3,1282,4.220408163265306

I love being able to choose one arm, one ab, and one buns workout for a full-body tone-up. My only complaint is that it's not quite full-body as there are no moves for the chest and only one workout has one back exercise.

Each 15 minute workout is very effective and the length is perfect so that you can't say you don't have time to do at least one workout.  Program 1 of the Buns section is amazing.  It's really tough.  I hate doing just squats and lunges but boy are they effective.  I have a tendancy to avoid this workout but when I do it, I am sore for several days afterward.  It definitely works!  Both ab programs are awesome as well.  Program 2 focuses more on the obliques and that's another one you'll feel the next day.  My only complaint is with program 1 of the arms segment.  I have a tendancy to avoid this workout, just because I've gotten so bored with it.  Instead of doing 3 sets of the arm workouts, I wish she would have included more workouts with fewer sets because I get tired of doing the same thing over and over again.  For some reason the 3 set thing doesn't bother me with program 2 of the arms and both bun programs but I just get annoyed at program 1 of the arms.  It's probably just me though.

She has great, fast workouts that really work.  I love that in under an hour you can workout your entire body and really feel and see the results.

Another good thing is that this dvd isn't filled with cheesy music and isn't too cutesy.  It's just her explaining the moves with a little background music that helps you keep track of how many reps you've done.

The little extras are nice as well.  Her recommendations for a healthy diet are spot on and I love that she looks healthy, not too skinny.",1244332800,,634,4.233333333333333

Because I was familiar with Tamilee Webb's instruction style and the quality of her workouts, I had no qualms purchasing this set.  What I love is that there are six 15 minute workout programs (2 each for abs, arms & buns), perfect when your pressed for time.  Each workout leaves me feeling great - most of the moves are unique and challenging, but not so brutally difficult that you'll dread (and skip!) your next workout.  When I finish the routines, I feel that I've done something effective and healthy for my body (as opposed to some workout videos which just feel like plain ol' torture and quickly end up in the 'donate' pile.)

I knew that the ""Steel"" videos were all VHS and wanted a DVD for the convenience. That's when I found the ""I Want That..."" DVD. I read the reviews and figured I'd give it a try. Well, the first day I did the buns work out with the arms. I needed about a week to recover. Everytime I stepped up or down a stair I felt a little twitch in my quads and I was a little sore, but I stuck with it. I just took long soaks in hot baths with epsom salt and soon recovered. Now I must say within three weeks I have begun to notice a smoothness to my legs and arms. Because Tamilee is teaching during the workouts I have began to think about opposing muscle groups, engaging my core, etc. You really do feel like she is your personal trainer. Like others have said I found program 1 of the buns division a little more effective than program 2. But, overall the entire DVD is a must have.",1240963200,3,1045,3.957345971563981

Also Tamilee could be more encouraging, but I maybe that's because it seems so easy for her to do it so I find her annoying ;). This is the only downfall of this dvd.

On the upside, she kicks my butt every time. Usually after doing Program 1 of abs, arms, and butt, I can't move for a day or two. (Imagine standing at the bottom of your stairs because you can't climb up those two flights to your apartment.) Yes, maybe I'm out of shape, but she works you. I've tried program 2, but trust me, it's not for amateurs. If you want a real work out, this DVD is definitely for you. Just don't take shortcuts and do what she says (or in my case, mute it, pump up the music, and just imitate her actions). I love the workout but hate her for next two days...

One piece of advance, it's probably not wise to do all three area workouts at once in the beginning, you might want to do a combo of two and work your way up.",1239408000,,1038,3.985576923076923

1394974,5,B000055ZGP,"I moved to a city that didn't have a gym anywhere within 30 minutes. It's not that I'm not motivated enough to go to the gym, it's just that I'm always on a tight schedule.

At first I was really skeptical to get a workout DVD because of how cheesy they typically are. Not to mention, I honestly didn't think I would be able to get a good workout out of them. I was wrong!

For skeptics (like me) Tamilee describes in detail how she scientifically tests her exercises to ensure they are giving you good results. Even better, she tells you during the exercises which ones tested highest. Another cool feature is that you can turn the music/sound off when you feel comfortable doing the exercises without her guidance.

I WANT THAT BODY is so great!!! It provides you with six 15min workouts: 2 abs, 2 arms, and 2 buns. Program 1 exercises are actually fairly difficult. I consider myself to be a fairly athletic person, and they had me working and sore. Program 2 exercises are HARD! Don't get discouraged though, they look harder than they are, and the results are out of this world!

Friends and family compliment me on my toned body, and think I am lying when I say I don't go to the gym anymore- and ""just"" do a workout DVD. In all honesty, I look better than I ever did when going to the gym, and I feel better too! Lifting all of those heavy weights at the gym put a lot of strain on my back/shoulders/neck. Now I use (at MAX) 5lbs with the video if I feel like I want more of a workout. Although, to be honest, the video alone (without weights) is challenging enough most days!

I would recommend purchasing a yoga-type mat to do your exercises on, especially if you are doing them on hardwood floors like me. It's impossible to do her ab workout without a mat! I even put a small towel underneath my tailbone to prevent it from bruising as well.

Side note: Tamilee mentions putting your ""mind into the workout"" ... This is seriously the best advice I got out of the video. Once I blocked out all of things I had to do after I worked out and started focusing on what my body was doing... the results got even better! Especially in my abs! Try it!

If you haven't already... Get this video, it's well worth the money...

Yes, the format of this DVD might seem uncomfortable at first if you wish to do all the routines in a row. But you will quickly adapt by just hitting the skip button on your remote.

The routines seem very hard at first if you are a beginner but you will easily adapt. Intermediate or higher will love this DVD. All you need is some hand weights according to your level. The new exercises she brings are insane, and the old ones are just as good.

Tamilee gives clear and concise instruction (as always) and I've worked out to her videos for years.

It's best to start with Level 1's and work toward Level 2's gradually. All in all, it's like having 6 workouts on one dvd.

I think the hardest moves are the sumo squats and the ""Jane Fonda's"" but By God they work! My bod is already getting ""ripped"" again after working out with this for a couple of weeks now. I do use other videos as well, but this one is one of the VERY best ones for toning and defining my arms, abs and buns the way I want them!

What I usually do with this video is dance around for a few minutes before I start (the kids can do this with me!) with some fun music and then I start with the leg/butt section to keep my heart rate up - that way I don't have to do a separate cardio session.  Each arm/ab/butt section has two different levels to choose from, so there is plenty of variety.  Plus, if the kids and life are cooperating, then I can move onto the next section (usually I do the abs next).  The workouts are short and very easy to follow, but very challenging and Tammi gives you support without being over the top and annoying.  Plus you can always add weights to make it more difficult.

The movements can be challenging, but it helps knowing why they are good to do and struggle doing them. I can see how this can be an effective addition to anyone's program. You can adjust the level of difficulty so this is appropriate for beginners to advanced. I highly recommend it and I'm an intermediate level exerciser. I get a good workout.",1197590400,,456,4.784810126582278

It has great instructions and it's easy to follow, but's it also a great workout.  If I don't do the abs and buns regularly, I can tell the difference - and I'm sore all over again when I start working out again.  They are truly effective and this is a keeper!",1189296000,,370,4.027397260273973
1395013,5,B000055ZGP,"This DVD was my introduction to Tamilee Webb and it's become a staple of my workout rotation.  Each of the three body parts - Abs, Arms and Buns have two 15 minute workouts to select from, with the second routine being more challenging than the first.

I've been exercising consistently for a few years with many of The Firm workouts (with that damn fanny lifter) among those I use regularly - so I thought my legs were in pretty good shape.  To my surprise, I really felt the effects of the buns workouts for several days afterward.  The second abs routine is about the only abdominal workout that I felt the effects in the oblique area the following day - and since that's the part of my body in the worst shape, I was sold!

Each of the 6 15 minute workouts is fast moving and has either two or three sets of the each exercise.  I like to do one of each - Arm/Ab/Buns - in each workout for a total 45 minute workout that leaves me a little damp.

I really like Tamilee Webb, who has a likeable personality with a great delivery that's motivating and encouraging and provides good tips on form and the muscles being worked.",1185667200,5,1125,4.328571428571428
1395014,5,B000055ZGP,"I was basically a beginner when I got this video.  I couldn't sit down after the first workout, but the pain and stiffness went away within a couple of days.  It took me about 2 weeks to be able to get through all the reps in program 1, and another 2 weeks to improve my form.  I also have weaker knees, so I took it easier on the lunges, and definitely saw a huge improvement.  Tamilee reminds you about a thousand times to put your weight on your heels, which definitely shifts the work from your quads to your buns.
I agree that program 2 for buns is easier (and easier on the knees), but arms and abs are MUCH more difficult.  I don't know if I'll ever get through that abs section!
Tamilee is a great, low-key instructor.  My only annoyance is that in program 2 she moves so quickly through the exercises (and from floor to chair) that I have to pause and rewind.  No biggie, but when the sweat is pouring down I don't like to fiddle with the remote!
After more than a month, I look forward to these workouts every other day.  I can definitely see the difference in my body, which is a huge motivator.  Highly recommended for anyone's rotation!",1185235200,6,1149,4.282407407407407

The collection has six 15-minute workouts, two each for abs, upper body and lower body.  It took some effort to master each exercise in each workout, but, dang it, I did it and am REALLY happy with the results!",1184025600,3,436,4.3580246913580245
1395026,5,B000055ZGP,"I got this DVD last week. I've done the ab and arm workouts once each and the buns twice. Each of the workouts is very effective, but a challenge to get through! I'm so sore but know I will be/(already am) seeing results! The exercise is hard on the knees, but can also be strengthening for them. My knees were sore after one workout, but after the second, they seemed fine. I recommend 5-lb weights (or at least 3-lb).",1182038400,4,419,4.3164556962025316
1395027,5,B000055ZGP,"This is one of my favorite exercise DVD's. I like the way the workouts are segmented (2 each of abs, buns and arms), and I like the 15 minute length of each segment.

Some of Tamilee's moves are unusual but seem to be quite effective. It's not an effortless workout (yet) for me, and I enjoy the challenge of the harder second segments.

Not a lot of warm up and cool down is included - just enough to bring up the heart rate slightly before the workout. I think it makes the workout time more efficient and focused.

I would definitely recommend this DVD for its variety!",1178928000,8,572,4.327102803738318
1395028,5,B000055ZGP,"I have liked Tamilee since the Buns of Steel days because I always saw results if I stuck with it. I'd say this workout is no different -- it will work if you stick with it. I'd put this workout in the intermediate/advanced category because some of the workouts (mainly buns section) require a lot of balance at a quick pace. Also, she does give some instruction as to the correct form of the exercises, but not for every exercise, so I would say that someone who already understands the correct forms of the exercises (like squats, lunges, etc) would do the best with this. This DVD also leaves a lot of room for advancement because it has 2 programs for each section. The premise is that she has tested each exercise in a lab to see at what level the muscle is contracting, and uses those results to create this program. If you are serious about strengthening and toning, I recommend this video.",1176163200,11,897,4.475609756097561

Although the ab workouts are good, they are TOUGH! Especially Part II. The first one is ok, until you have to extend your arms above your head, but the 2nd part is too tough for beginners. I use to be in great shape and even then, these workouts were tough.

My suggestion is to get her other video instead (Abs of Steel). Even though it's older and she look dorky w/her hair, etc., the abs exercises in that one are much easier to do (they're still effective).",1175126400,9,655,4.109375
1395031,5,B000055ZGP,"OK. I got this DVD due to the tons of good reviews and I'm thrilled I did. The DVD has 6 parts plus bonuses. Arms 1 & 2, Abs 1 & 2, Buns 1 & 2.
I got the videos because my arms are so weak and flabby and I know to lose weight that lifting weights is really important. I have no experience with weight lifting and going to the gym is really intimidating (I run on the treadmill but stay away from the machines...too scary) I have 5 lbs dumb bells but I'm thinking of getting a pair of 4 lbers too. All you need is dumb bells, a yoga mat (or carpet would work) and a chair to hold on to during bun work out.

Abs:
I'm able to do Abs 1 and 2 so I've done both. Definitely a GREAT abs workout. not just your regular crunches, the Abs 2 has some great twists and moves I've never seen and even i cant get through all 12 reps. I have a very strong core fyi.

Buns:
From reading other reviews I tried Buns 2 and like it much better than Buns 1 as it's easier on the knees. and whoow it gives me a great [...] work out!

Arms:
I have not yet been able to get through all of Arms 1. right now I have the 5 lb dumbbells and I try to do as many reps as I can and do the rest without the dumbbells just moving my arms.

Basically this is a no-nonsense approach that is effective and who doesnt have 15 mins. there is no fancy moves and steps to learn and Tamilee is awesome. She is clear in her instruction, no fru fru...
This is the only dvd of hers I own and its the only DVD I use period. It's so quick to do and you're actually SORE the next day, the good kind! I've already seen some progress. This is the best $20 I've ever spent.

Also the music isn't overbearing and I like to play my own CDs while doing it, and the 15 minutes fly by (I usually end up doing 2 or 3 of them a day)
I am seeing some body transformations but I'll add more in a few weeks and let you know!

I really like the option of being able to mix and match the workouts...ie if I really want to work on my abs, I'll combine the Level 2 workout for abs & arms with an easier Level 1 workout for the legs.

Great and easy to follow routines...basic moves that provide results.",1171065600,3,429,4.405063291139241

(The only option is to turn off her voice). I don't rememeber which one its in, but there is a sound within the music of one of them that sounds like a cat being tortured - even my cats thought so. Other than that - its a great group of exercises. I haven't done the second level of the programs yet, but expect to be to that level soon.",1170720000,6,614,3.983739837398374
1395034,5,B000055ZGP,These moves work!! I work out regularly and recently bought this DVD for a little change in routine. Well worth it!! I haven't done the beginner exercises. I went straight for the harder ones and WOW what a great workout. Even though I was able to do them they were challenging and boy was I ever sore the next 2 days. Just goes to show that even a person who works out regularly can afford to change it up and get deeper into those muscles. Tamilee is a great instructor and I am intrigued by her science behind the exercises.,1170460800,3,527,4.28
1395035,5,B000055ZGP,"I love Tamilee's workouts. She will definitely let you know you have done a workout when you get done with one of hers. Not for the beginner really even though she has different levels. You can use lighter weights to start, (I would recommend even if you have worked out for awhile). Very motivating!",1170288000,2,300,4.574074074074074
1395046,5,B000055ZGP,"This is the best toning video I own. There are six fifteen segments targeting arms, abs, and buns. The arms segments are great because Tamilee fatigues the muscles, pushing them to the max. The abs workouts are the best I've ever encountered. The second abs workout is by far tougher; it will take some time to master even for the intermediate. You have to push yourself and concentrate on the moves. Overall, the moves are challenging, but not too difficult, and Tamilee provides suggestions for how to make them even more challening if you're at a higher level. I definitely think all skill levels can enjoy this DVD, but keep in mind that it's not easy.",1170288000,3,656,4.663793103448276

I just started doing all 3 part one segments for a total of 45 minutes - 3 times a week.  My only quibble with this DVD is that I wish it had an option to choose a complete 45 minute workout instead of having to skip from segment to segment.

I didn't think it would become a staple in my collection or anything!  Well, let me tell you, this video is ""the realness"".  I normally use the FIRM videos - and they are no joke!  But I needed something that I could easily take with me when I'm traveling.  The FIRM is good, but cumbersome for travel because of the need for multiple sets of weights, steppers, fanny lifter, etc.  I was very pleased with TammiLee's workout.  It is ideal for travel.  I took a set of medium weight (5lb)handweights with me and I was good to go.  The video provided a nice workout for all body parts, and I could ""feel it"" the next day.  I even used the video during the holidays, when I went out of town to visit family during Thanksgiving.  The program was so flexible, I just completed one section of the ""I want that body"" video each day, and added a short walk with family members.  I didn't gain a pound..HALLELUJAH, I actually lost weight.  If you travel a great deal, especially for business, this is a wonderful video.  One set of light or medium weights and a laptop (for viewing the video) are all you need, even a small hotel room provides enough space for completing this workout.",1169078400,4,1289,4.476394849785407

It's like finding an old friend whom you forgot just how much you enjoyed their company. Tamilee is full of energy and information and thank GOD she is making these videos. I'm getting my body back!!

1395050,5,B000055ZGP,"Best known as the star of the ""Abs of Steel"" and ""Buns of Steel"" videos, Tamilee Webb demonstrates a variety of basic, easy-to-follow exercises, which have been scientifically tested and yielded among the most effective. She has a friendly yet professional demeanor, and her instruction and queuing are right on the mark. Tamilee demonstrates the exercises alone in a spacious, neatly decorated set and the workout is set to upbeat instrumental music which is heard more in the background. She herself is in fantastic shape, displaying a petite, curvy yet lean, defined, healthy-looking body.

This video contains three 30-minute body part-focused segments - with two 15-minute sub-segments each for the abdominals, arms and buttocks. There is also a stretch for the area of the body worked at the end of each sub-segment.  Beginners can choose to only do part one of each sub-segment, while intermediates or advanced can combine all segments for more of a challenge. All of the exercises are done with high repetitions and either light dumbells or no weight for the lower body, so you'll build muscle definition but won't get bulky.

The ""I Want Those Abs"" segment includes forward, reverse and oblique crunches, which also incorporate leg lifts, knee bends, as well as standing abdominal exercises with light dumbells to really hit all of the muscles in the abdominal area.

The ""I Want Those Arms"" segment includes a variety of basic exercises using light dumbbells while sitting in a chair. This not only works every part of the arms, but also works the shoulders and even back.

The ""I Want Those Buns"" segment includes various forward and plie squats and lunges, which although Tamilee demonstrates without any weights, dumbells can be used for more advanced exercisers who want added intensity. These exercises not only help to reshape the buttocks but work the legs as well. Also included are isometric contractions, single-legged squats and kickbacks performed while holding onto a chair that can also be intensified with ankle weights.

As others have noted, I also think it would've been more practical to have a single, separate introduction and total-body warm-up, instead of including the same introduction at the beginning of both the Abs and Arms portions, as well as a separate warm-up for each routine, which one will likely want to skip through if they're doing the entire workout. But this is a niggling complaint when taken into account how wonderfully effective and expertly queued the actual exercises are! So just keep the remote handy in case you'll want to skip through some parts. The bonus features include insightful information with a nice Q&A section about fitness and diet and nutritional tips.

Because all of the exercises are proven to be effective, can be modified for all fitness levels, and are divided into body part-focused segments, I'd recommend this video to absolutely anyone.",1168905600,6,2920,5.121848739495798
1395051,3,B000055ZGP,"This isn't a bad workout, aimed mostly towards beginner-intermediate crowd. The abs sections are quite tough. I like the 6 15 min routines that you can mix and match to create various workout routines just out of one tape.

However, there are a couple of big flaws in my opinion.

1) If this is ""I want that BODY"" workout, then where are exercises for back and chest? You can't call a video a total body workout and neglect to work such major muscle groups. Basically, you can't rely on this video to provide you with balanced weight training, you need to do additional exercises on your own (or from some other w/o tape) to work out your chest and back.

2) I would think that most people would do more than just a 15 min routine. Usually, one would pick several sections for 30-60 min workout. In that case, the warmup in front of EACH section is unnecessary. I'm already warmed up from the first 15 min! I don't need to be forwarding through warmups on all subsequent sections. A much saner approach would be to have a separate chapter on DVD just for the warmup. That way, it doesn't matter how many sections you want to do - 1 or all 6, you can do the warmup chapter first and then plug away.

3) This one is not a major flaw, just a little annoying tidbit ;). How many times does she really have to say ""Gluteus"" in the Buns section? It gets old fast!

All that said, it's a good workout for your arms, buns and abs, but keep in mind that you need extra exercises to complete the whole body routine.",1168560000,19,1505,4.285211267605634

No other DVD can accomplish what Tamilee does in 15 minutes.  This really makes me value how efficient she is at giving you exercises that are really challenging and in a short amount of time.

I decided to try some post- pregnancy DVDs. None of them were giving me any results. I started watching this DVD again and slowly tried the routines again. It took a few weeks to build my muscles back up. I once again have a waist! People always comment- ""You don't look like you were ever pregnant.""

I feel like it never gets old and Tamilee keeps me motivated without annoying me. She gives ideas to increase or decrease the exercise depending on if you are just starting out or if you have been doing the video for a while. Unlike one of the other reviewers I actually think that she warms you up quickly and moves right into the exercises which I like. Especially if you are doing one or more workout I don't like having a long warm up for each exercise. Tamilee doesn't do that. After each workout I can feel that my muscles have been worked without being in pain or unable to work out again the next day.

Also she spends too much time giving instructions for each exercise, I found myself wishing she would just hurry up the whole time.

She is such as sweet person and you don't get bored listening to her. It also has a feature on the dvd to remove her voice and only work with music which is also great. Dont let the timing fool you. The exercises work great!",1143417600,8,546,4.2

The DVD is divided into the three areas of the body that most women want to improve; abs, arms and derriere. It then makes them in manageable 15 minute routines. It also gives you a choice of beginner and advanced routine.

Tamilee also has an infectious personality. You enjoy her and it doesn't hurt that she has the looks that inspire you to keep going cause you want the body that she has! Very hard to find excuses for avoiding exercise when it's only 15 minutes!",1142035200,9,543,4.376237623762377

If I am crunched for time I can do 15 min. of one of the programs and fell good that I got some exercise into my day.

Yesterday was the first day that I tried it and i'm impressed.  In only 15 minutes you can work out either abs, arms or buns.  You also get two sets of each, I did the first set of arms, buns and abs.  This is the most effective workout, I am sore today in my arms, abs and thighs!!

ABS: because i work out regularly, the first segment is too easy for me. i end up using only the second one, which is more difficult. it's a very challenging segment that took me 6 months to master. this segment works your obliques and rectus (lower abdominals) really well.

BUNS: the first time i used it, i couldn't finish and nearly collapsed. my legs were sore for 3 days!! but after doing it a few times, the soreness went away. now, i feel that my quads and butt were tighter. i now do the first segment with 5lb weights, which gives me a good cardio workout. after 1.5 years, i still have trouble finishing the second segment without feeling a burn in my quads.

ARMS: i learned the techniques and do them at the gym, not with the dvd. the one problem with the arm section is that they work all arm muscles in the same segment, and i prefer to isolate muscles and work different ones on different days.

the dvd is high quality and if you stick with it along with cardio exercise and a healthy diet, i promise you will see and feel your ab muscles.",1130630400,21,1183,4.221238938053097

I gained about 55 pounds with my pregnancy.  I hadn't worked out the whole nine months due to nausea.  So when I began again, I was very very weak.  But Tamilee kicked me into shape!  I love her other Buns of Steel videos so I trusted her instruction.  Well, I have to say that she gets better with her years.  A true fine wine!  It is basic and not flashy.  But that is what it takes to get your [...], abs and arms back in shape.  I could do it while the baby naps.  I joined a gym for a little while and found that all their exercise classes were too easy.  So I cancelled my membership and came right back to Tamilee.  She still makes me burn, and if it ever feels too easy, just put those weights in my hands with the lunges and it is an intense workout all over again.  Really, if you are looking to tone up, this is it.  4 times a week with cardio in between, and you will see results.",1126569600,6,1031,4.054726368159204
1395120,4,B000055ZGP,"I LOVE this video!  It is set up in three different parts with two different workouts for each target zone (abs, arms, buns).  The workout is with Tami Lee only so that is nice not to have the distraction of other exercisers.  She motivates you in her calm voice and makes you want to do that, ""one more"".  Each workout takes about 15 minutes; who doesn't have 15 mintes in their day?  The workout will start off and go in a cylce so it ends with the same moves you started with.  I have NO cardio tolerance in me as I am not a big fan of exercising (although I have managed to maintain my weight through healthy eating) and I was sweating in this video!  I started off with the buns portion and seriously could not walk properly for a week...it was that good kind of hurt and not to mention let me know that it was working!
For those of you that are getting back into exercising, this provides a great work-out, challenge and takes little time out of your day that can be done in any living room space.  You can see a clip of it at collegevideos.com.
The only problem I have with this DVD is that if I stop it while playing it, and want to go back to the menu it will start at the science part and run through all the workouts.  I have to stop it, shuffle through my disk selection and re-start to get to the menu frame...maybe I just got a bummed video?

Some of these 15 minute workouts get me sweating more than some of my cardio tapes! I also think Tamilee is not annoying but quite pleasant and informative. I'm so pleased with this purchase.

I've done them 3 times each and can already see a difference.  The buns workout is KILLER! I am in pretty good shape - not overweight but I've had 2 kids and want to tone up.  That said, I could only make it through the 1st set the 1st time I did the buns workout - and I was really sore the next day! But Tamilee is right - it does get easier, and pretty quick too.  The 2nd time I did the buns workout, I made it through the 2nd set. And the 3rd time I made it all the way through - what a great feeling!

I've been doing Taebo off and on for about 5 years and Tamilee is so much better at cueing than Billy Blanks, it's not even funny.  Plus he has a habit of doing more reps on one side than the other which drives me insane.

This workout does not include much cardio - though I do break a sweat doing the 1st buns workout.  I just ordered Tamilee's Cardio Blast/Weight Loss workouts and plan to alternate those with these.  I'm excited to get started!",1125792000,5,1130,3.9078947368421053

I have only tried the first arm routine-- so I cannot say much about that one.  Programs 1 are made to build strength--you definitely feel it.

1395146,5,B000055ZGP,"I've had this DVD for over a year.  It's one of my favorites for a variety of reasons:

1. Separates out the different muscle groups - This is the only DVD I have that allows me to not take a ""rest day"" between my weight training.  I will do two segments of buns one day for a thirty-minute lower body workout.  Then, I can still lift weight the following day using the two arms segments.

2.  Excellent instruction. Tamilee is fairly consistent in her cuing, is easy to follow, and the exercises are well-executed. I appreciate that she tends to let you know there are ""two more"" reps remaining and her counting is consistent.  I do not take these things for granted because so many other instructors will mess up their counts or distract me in some way. The pacing is very good - I hate waiting around for the next move, which isn't a problem with these routines.

3. Solid workouts. Even after quite a bit of use, I still find the bun and arm workouts to be challenging. Like she says, I'll increase weight so the moves don't become too easy.

4. Good value - 90 minutes worth of exercise for around $15. I tend to buy through amazon or deepdiscountdvd but often view the dvds at collagevideo.

Note: I did the ab workouts a couple of times when I first bought the DVD but found them to put too much pressure on my neck. So I never do them anymore - my neck seems to be more sensitive than the average person.  Yet, I still rate this DVD as ""5 star"" because the other four sections are excellent and I always go back to them.",1118880000,8,1528,4.270833333333333

The DVD is great, because you can pick and choose what parts you want to work out. I like to do one program from each category. I love Tamilee Webb because her cueing is right on and she is serious, but also fun to watch and listen to.... not annoying (like some other video instructers).

Arms and Abs 2 are way more challenging than Arms and Abs 1 but if you do this video 3 -4 times a week you will see results in no time.

This DVD has 6 different 15-minute workouts associated with it: 2 abs, 2 buns, and 2 arm workouts.  You can pick 1, all 6, or a combination of workouts to do in one sitting. Each target zone has 2 workouts with the second one presumably a bit harder than the first.  I myself have not ""graduated"" from the first workout series but I am already noticing well-defined and toned muscles.

As a bonus, this DVD also comes with extras.  There is a fitness Q & A section and a 10-day diet plan (your breakfast, lunch, and dinner for 10 days are listed for you on the DVD). The only equipment you need is a set of 3-10 pound weights (if you want to do the arm workout).

The one down side of this DVD is that you can't fast forward through the opening credits. I advise you pop the DVD in, THEN get yourself ready for the workout.  By the time you are dressed and ready with your weights the DVD will have advanced to the main menu.

Overall, this is a great DVD for target toning.  If you want a good cardio plus toning workout, try Tamilee's Tighter Assets: Cardio Blast or the Crunch: Boot Camp DVD.",1114473600,8,1376,4.352941176470588

She has broken them down into 15 minute segments (there are 2 for each body part) so if you really want an intense workout do all six.  Tammilee is great at cueing and you are reminded to keep your form while doing the exercises.  This DVD was hard at first (do Part 1 if you're a beginner) but the more you do it, you'll find it easier to do - the results start showing up before you know it.  Part 2 is harder, but you'll see the pay off after doing it a few times.  Stick with it - it's worth it!  I do some or all of this video every other day and run on the days in between.

The tricept and shoulder exercises I feel a lot (I use very old 3.3 lb weights) but I almost never feel it in my biceps! Sometimes I will do Arms program 1 and 2 just to make sure I am working my arms out. As for the Buns, I found that Program 2 is better for me since I have knee problems. Program 1 is just squats over and over and after the first set, my knee would give out and I would do the exercises wrongly.

I love the arms section too and the whole workout was completed without me feeling too exhausted.  Tamilee is such a joy to watch.  No nonsence, clear and precise and so easy to follow.  I particularly like the exercise being divided into two parts, the easier one on the first and the more difficult one on the second.  I got to say that this is really a good dvd to have.  It compliment so well with my Taebo kickboxing exercises.",1107302400,6,670,4.296

1395170,5,B000055ZGP,"This is one of the best exercise DVDs I have ever owned, and I have owned a lot. The workouts are challenging and fun. I would recommend this video to everyone. Yes, some of the workouts are difficult and you will feel it the next day, but if you ease into it, you will love it!",1106092800,4,278,3.982142857142857
1395171,4,B000055ZGP,"I own over 10 workout Videos/DVDs and this one I added to my favorites list.

When I FIRST GOT THE VIDEO: I got it after reading it was great for sloths...I was a sloth back then...boy was that wrong!  This video is short, but it is HARD and not extremely motivating for someone who is just starting to work out.

The FIRST TIME I WORKED OUT: I thought this tough.  I kept trying to go back to it, but ended up shelving it and opting for dance cardio, belly dancing, etc. as more fun & motivating exercise routines.

WHEN IT GOT GOOD: After a year & a half of working out consistently, I found belly dancing too boring & the cardio routines fun but I needed another level of working out - THAT is when I got out this video & really found it does a great job!

PROS: This is a toning video...the workouts are short & they have a lot of them: 2-15 min butt, 2-15 min arms, 2-15 min abs.  I still haven't worked up to the second level on any of them, but I know that I eventually will...it just takes time.  All those videos that tell you to start doing the more challenging routines after 3 months are often just too easy if you asked me...this video is not easy, but it makes you feel great!  I like how each segment is 15 minutes long so that I usually do a 30 min cardio routine w/ another video & then do one 15 min routine from this DVD (for a total of 45 mins working out each day).  Since it is not recommended to workout muscle groups 2 days in a row, this routine allows me to workout every day & still do consistent toning every day.

CONS: Not for the person just starting to work out!  Not only will it make your muscles burn, but the workouts are not ""fun"" (no dancing or great music).  If you want quick workouts that will eventually lead you to working out a lot more, try Quick Fix videos or Afro-Brazilian Cardio - definitely a lot of fun & will make you want to come back for more.  As for Tamilee, she is a little annoying, but not too bad...most of my friends find her really inspirational.  I've purchased a new video from her just now because I really liked this video so she can't be that bad in my book.

All in all, I recommend this video to anyone who wants a great toning video & is not a novice.  I give it 4 stars because it would be nice if there were three levels for each body group - one for novices too...then again this would increase the price of the video a bit too much, eh? Good luck in your decision, and remember that buying a video a month is still less expensive than going to the gym!",1105574400,14,2526,4.0912778904665315

The only complaint I have is there is not enough chest and back focus so I usually add them in on my own.  But this is well worth the money and by far my favorite toning DVD.",1105142400,,500,4.103092783505154

This is great when you're short on time or just not up to a full workout that day.  Program one is for beginners to intermediates, program two is for intermediate to advanced.  Both programs offer challenging workouts that work your muscles to fatigue.  You have a choice of abs, arms, or buns.  In each program, the workouts are 15 min. long and can be selected separately and worked out individually or you can do the full workout.

This DVD focuses on 3 areas - abs, buns & arms.  For each body part, there are 2 workouts - a beginner & intermediate.  Each workout is about 15 minutes including a few minutes of stretching to warm up.  I do quite a bit of exercise & think the intermediate is a challenge, so the workouts definitely appeal to different levels.  The great thing is the workouts contain different exercises rather than your ordinary crunches, etc. so you get a nice variety.

I love the fact that each workout is only 15 minutes since most of us working women don't have a lot of time for exercise. These are designed to give you maximum results in a short period of time.  Believe me, you can feel the workout in only 15 minutes!",1101254400,8,783,4.358620689655172

1395192,4,B000055ZGP,"Let's make it easy.....

PROS:

1. Two ab, two bun, and two arms workouts all on 1 DVD! No getting bored, lots of variety, and you can mix it up however you want.

2. Tamilee is renowned and experienced, as well as educated. No one likes watching a dippy blond with size D implants and no high school diploma telling them to squeeze their buns. 'Nuff said.

3. It's challenging! I thought I was in pretty decent shape but apparently Tamilee says otherwise! Definitely not a beginner workout but still okay for beginners. You feel it afterwards and that's what you want!

4. Workouts are short and can fit into anyone's schedule. I hate when I find a DVD I think I want, then read that it's a 64 minute workout. ICK!

CONS:

1. Not enough stretching before or after. Granted, the idea is a ""quick"" workout, but anyone will tell you stretching is crucial to avoiding pulled muscles. Tamilee even says so at one point in the workout. But she doesn't incorporate it well.

2. The arm workout is too fast. It's like she's trying to cram so much into one workout so she does the exercises very fast. When you're holding weights in your hand it can cause injury if you move just the wrong way too quickly. Again I know the idea of the DVD is ""quick workout"" but I think she should slow down here.

3. What is with the angle icon???? I have tried every way humanly possible to get that annoying video camera icon off my screen. I read the ""directions"" in the DVD case but it just won't go away. I also don't like how you can't FF through the opening garbage on the DVD.

So I suppose if you can overlook the petty annoyances then you'll be okay. I still stand by my four stars because I think Tamilee sacrificed a few important things for the sake of cramming the workout into 15 minutes. But you can always go your own speed.",1094515200,20,1818,4.320588235294117
1395193,5,B000055ZGP,"I consider this one of the best fitness purchases since my treadmill.  Tamilee gives clear instructions, keeps you motivated without being annoying, and best of all, the exercises really work.  I've only been doing this for about 6 weeks, two times a week for each segment, and I've already toned up nicely and lost two pant sizes, two inches off my waist and two off of my hips.  My abs are hard as rocks.  I actually didn't know I had muscles in the places they are showing up.  I would recommend this DVD to everyone, and in fact purchased it for my sister in law, who has just about every exercise tape/dvd on the market.  She loves it.  Be warned, though, this is not the easy way to fitness.  This tape is HARD.  When you first start, unless you're already in top notch shape, you won't be able to do all the reps or even all of the exercises.  But stick with it and you'll soon be feeling and looking great.

After owning this video for less than a month, I still work up a sweat and feel great afterwards. I can't believe the changes that have taken place in my body already. Another reviewer commented that Tamilee talks too much through the video. I would have to agree that she does talk a lot, but many of the comments she offers are truly helpful. It's almost like she reads your mind - everything she says ""make sure you're not..."", I have found myself doing at one time or another. The fact that there are six workouts on this DVD is another plus.

  There are both Beginner and Intermediate parts of each body area, including abs, arms, and buns. Each part is at least 15 minutes long, which is more than adequate considering how hard you will work. I can already tell a difference after working out with this DVD. Not just because of the soreness and burning that I feel after doing them but also because of the sculpting that it has provided to me.

  I also liked that she included a stretching portion at the beginning of the sets as well as educates the viewer the whole way through about muscle groups and how they work together. For the price, it is definitely worth investing in this workout DVD. It is challenging for me and has helped decrease my resting heart rate. I am sure that I will be in shape in no time because of this DVD.

1395197,4,B000055ZGP,"This DVD is a great value because it contains THREE workouts (abs, arms and buns) on one DVD plus each workout is done at 2 skill levels so you can choose how hard you want to work on a given day. Each body is different, so you might be at level 1 on one bodypart and on level 2 for another.  For example, when I first got this DVD, I could get through both the level 1 and 2 arms workout but wasn't even close to being able to get through the level 1 abs workout.  Now I am able to get through the entire abs level 1 workout and really feel that I have progressed in a relatively short time!  I've also progressed from 2 lb. weights to 5 lbs. weights on the arms workout.  The buns workout is tough on the knees with all the lunges (then again, I am over 50 so this may not be of concern to you if you're 20 or 30) so I don't do it as frequently as the others.

This video is worth the money just for that ab workout.  I also think it's super cool that she brought all of these workouts into the lab and tested how hard they worked the muscles they were targeting.  So she only includes exercises that tested high in the lab, so you don't have to worry about wasting your time with less effective exercises.  Therefore you can be confident that you are working your muscles very hard for a short amount of time.  Why waste time doing a longer workout that includes less effective exercises???

I don't have time for aerobic exercise but manage to use this dvd 2-3 times a week. Even without aerobics, my endurance is so much better now that my muscles are toned.

Do only what you can and do not push yourself too hard or you will give up.
I felt the difference in a week.  I wasn't straining as much and I definitely did not hurt as much.  I noticed the difference in two weeks.  I increased my weights at two weeks.
The only thing that I will say she could've done more on was warming up and cooling down with better stretches. I have another older yoga video that has excellent stretches at the end and I used that instead of the stretches she does.
I enjoyed this tape because there was no artsy fartsy funky camera angles. There was no silly chit chatting with other people working out. There was nobody in the background going Wooooooooo!  It was a straight forward workout which is all I wanted.

It is a very effective 15 minutes.  I've seen dramatic changes in my abs and butt.  This is the first program I've used (and I've used a lot!) where I've seen such noticeable changes. I find the 2nd second ab session very challenging, but it works.  The butt excercises really lift the behind and give it a nice shape.  I haven't really used the arm sessions but a couple of times, so I can't rate them, but the rest of the tape is awesome.  Another good thing is that Tamilee is not annoying like other instructors.  Since she isn't a model or movie-star who suddenly decides to make a video, she comes across as really knowing her ""stuff"".",1071532800,2,819,4.313725490196078
1395235,5,B000055ZGP,"Today I type this review with sore legs and sore abs...  yesterday I did part 1 of the buns routine, and part 1 of the abs routine.  And today, I am really feeling it!  This is a great set of workouts.  Many of the exercises are very basic (squats, crunches, bicep curls, etc), but they really do work, as shown by Tamilee's extensive laboratory testing.  The super-circuit formatting of the workouts makes them even tougher - you will feel quite fatigued by the end of a workout.  (If you don't, you need to use heavier weights)  After seeing all the science behind the exercises, it makes you wonder, why aren't ALL exercises from other videos tested in controlled laboratory conditions?  But that's beside the point, I guess.  Buy this workout, you won't be sorry.  You will get the most bang for your buck.  Tamilee is friendly and upbeat, but not overly sweet at all - a very good coach.  If I had to come up with a complaint, it would be that there isn't enough post-workout stretching.  When you do a strength routine that intense, you need a lot of stretching afterward, and these workouts kind of lack a bit in that department.  But just add your own thourough stretch routine, and you should be fine.  Overall, an excellent video - you get 6 15-minute workouts, so it's a terrific value.  I highly recommend it!",1070928000,2,1321,4.5574468085106385

So, I relied on the reviews of amazon to convince me and YES I AM CONVINCED.  If you use this DVD 2-3 times a week, rotating with a cardio workout YOU WILL SEE RESULTS.  I use this DVD and go back and forth from program 1 and 2 at least 4 times a week and have not been disappointed.  I use the arms and abs workout after my cardio.  If you stick with it you will see results, but you have to stick with it.  Tamilee is straight to the point and explains each workout and the muscle groups.  I do not use the buns portion of this workout, since I run and alternate using the Taebo workouts, so this group is well addressed.  But overall, I was not disappointed and greatly pleased.

I saw results after three weeks.  I alternate this tape with a stretching ballet workout four times a week and even after a year I am not tired of either one.

This is a great DVD with two levels -- beginner and intermediate.  You can also intensify the workout by using weights (which she encourages you to do when it gets easy).  My advice is that if this DVD is a little hard for you as a beginner within the first few days, hang in there and keep trying because 2-3 times a week, in a couple of workouts, you will see results.",1066953600,7,680,4.128787878787879

And for skeptics, the scientific research section is a good bonus... but you won't be skeptical for long once you start doing these exercises.
If you're doing this for weight loss, be sure to mix it up with some cardio workouts, so you can burn off your fat and reveal the stunning muscles you're building underneath.

1395249,5,B000055ZGP,"I first bought this DVD because I liked that I got six workouts for the price of one DVD.  As soon as I got it home, I tried session one of the Buns workout.  I got through about 7 of the 15 minutes, and I had trouble sitting down for the next two days!  But with practice, doing the workouts two or three times a week, it gets easier, you can get through the whole thing, and you'll definitely see the results.
As some other reviewers have said, the second Buns workout is almost easier than the first, and at least not as aerobic, but the Arms and Abs segments do have a more challenging Session Two.  The Arms workouts gave me the fastest results, and while I've just started using the Abs sections (and let me tell you, it will be a while before I can get through the entire Session Two!) I can tell by the feeling in my abs the next day that it's doing its job.
The quality of the DVD and the instructor, Tamilee Webb, make it a workout you don't get tired of doing over and over.  Tamilee is encouraging without being annoying or perky, the music isn't loud, the set is simple, and since it's only Tamilee doing the workout, students repeating the moves do not distract you.
The most important thing, though, is that these are truly effective workouts, most are simple enough to follow along with the first or second time around, and since each individual workout is only 15 minutes long, you can find time in your day to at least do one or two.  This DVD, along with walking a few times a week and eating healthier foods, has helped me lose 16 pounds in the last few months.

No silly, complex dance steps.  It's just one professional woman, speaking calmly, going through the well-thought-out, simple exercises to nice, subtle, music.  Very refreshing.  I've only gone through the first program for the three body parts covered (and only did one of the three sets she does), but it was a darn good workout (actually, I thought I was going to die :) ).  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I think it should include at least a token set of chest exercises.  But, after the workout, when I can breathe again, I just do a set of push-ups.  That pretty much rounds out the whole body (at least for doing exercises that don't require specialized equipment).

One, she said that she had tested these exercises in the lab to see which ones were most effective, but she only appears to have tested herself.  People react differently, so I wasn't sure if I'd wind up doing any ""garbage sets"" of exercises that don't work for me.  Second, I thought that it would be a little ""girly"", i.e., totally concerned with fat loss, not paying any attention to the bodybuilding axiom ""more muscle = faster metabolism.""  Also by girly, I mean ""incredibly simple.""
I'm glad to say that I was wrong on all counts.  I've done all three workouts, and I can't say that I went through a single exercise thinking, ""Why am I doing this,"" because I could feel each one doing its thing.  Second, I was aching for two days after that leg (bun) workout.  I can do 250-pound squats until the sun comes up, but the relentless pace of this workout (sans weights) was a whole new sensation.

That's why  I bought ""Tamilee Webb's I Want That Body"" DVD five months ago, and this DVD has totally lived up to its name and transformed my body. I now have abs and arms (almost) like Tamilee's thanks to the scientifically proven effective exercises she handpicked for those problem areas. This DVD contains two 15 minute exercises each for abs, arms and buns, and the second ones are more advanced, so you can pick and choose depending on your individual fitness level. The arms programs include a brief warm-up and stretch, a few sets of fast paced weight lifting and strengthening movements and a stretch. I do this two to three times a week, and my arms are much firmer and better looking than ever! Hand weights are required, and I recommend that you buy weight adjustable ones as I moved up from two to 5 pounds in 5 months. The abs programs are my favorite, because they really work, although they are quite difficult at first. They consist of a brief warm-up and two sets of fast paced ab-strengthening movements. They work every part of your abs and sometimes your legs and back muscles. Thanks to the program two, I started showing amazing muscle definition on my abs that I never had in my whole life (I'm 38). I tried doing the Buns programs, and they seemed very effective however difficult.

1395272,4,B000055ZGP,"Tamilee Webb, a well-known veteran instructor, has put together a new series of ""I want those..."" tapes. Each tape contains two 15-minute workouts focused on a particular part of the body, with the second workout being more challenging than the first.  At the start of each video, Tamilee explains that she did exhaustive research to determine which exercises were the most effective and then included the exercises that rated highest in her workouts.  For each workout, Tamilee is exercising solo in the same studio from her ""Quick Toning"" series (minus the two televisions showing her from different angles).  In fact, the entire feel of this series is similar to the QT workouts, but it moves much more quickly--eg, shorter warmups and cooldowns, and much less transition time between the exercises.
The ""I Want That Body!"" tape focuses on strength training for the entire body.  Tamilee starts each workout with a very brief warm-up: only 2-3 minutes of moving around and stretching.  In the first program, she begins with a sequence of four standing moves:  lunges, squats, biceps, and shoulders.  She then moves to floor, where she does a unique tricpes move--sort of a one-armed side pushup--and two abs exercises. Each exercise is done for 8 repetitions, and then the entire sequence is repeated twice, followed by a brief cool-down.
In the second workout, there is a greater focus on the buttocks, iincluding some unique leg extensions, squats, and lunges using a chair.  Tamilee then moves on to arms/shoulders and does a set of flies, concentration curls, and tricep dips (with the chair).  The only abs work is a weighted side bend; there are no abs moves on the floor.  In the first set, there are 12 repetitions of all exercises, and then most (but not all) of the sequence is repeated a second time for 8 reps.  Finally, there is a brief cool-down at the end.
Tamilee moves very quickly through both workouts. Although her cuing is excellent, she is sometimes on to the next move before you have a chance to adequately set up for it, so I found myself pausing the tape here and there (especially since many of the moves were unfamiliar to me). Although I like Tamilee and enjoyed both workouts, I question their utility, as the workouts are too short to really adequately address each muscle group.  In particular, the few moves for arms left me feeling that I didn't get a very good workout in this area, and the attention to abs is pretty minimal, especially in the second workout.  On the other hand, however, my butt and thighs were definitely sore the next day, so those areas seemed to get more of a workout than I had originally thought (after doing both workouts on the same day).
So, I think that this tape might be useful in the following scenarios: 1) beginners would probably find the tape useful using light weights and doing the two workouts on alternate days; 2) intermediates would probably find it useful to do both workouts together using moderate/heavy weights on days that they are time-crunched; and 3) advanced could probably use this tape as a warm-up to more intense toning by doing one or both workouts.",1029110400,38,3143,4.819702602230484
1395273,5,B000055ZGP,"I just received this DVD and have gone through the whole thing.  It is divided into 3 workouts - Arms, Abs & Buns.  Two 15 minute programs are offered for each of the three, with the second program being harder than the first. The DVD allows you to quickly select a program.
A chair and hand weights are required for some of the programs.
I have only had this a week and it has already replaced all of my other strength training videos.  Tamilee Webb, as usual, has a very quiet and professional style which I prefer over the ""cute"" instructors.  She reminds you about correct form, and is very easy to follow.  The music in this DVD is unobtrusive.  It's a very professional package and well worth the money.
I have been working out for about 4 months, and consider myself to be at an intermediate level of fitness.
I found the Arms segment to be quick but effective.  The moves are simple, but really target the arms and shoulders.  If it gets too easy - just move to a heavier set of weights.
The Abs segment is also very effective.  Both programs have some very difficult moves.  Some of the moves are the classics, some are new.  Program 2 concentrates more on the sides than Program 1, but all areas of the abs are worked in both.
The Buns segment is very tough.  I almost didn't even do that section.  I am a serious bicyclist and don't really need to work my glutes.  However, I had a tough time getting through the workout, and I really felt it the next day!",1027296000,87,1467,4.326007326007326

I also like the way Tamilee explains what exercises are working with what muscles.

I am still using one lb. weights and am planning on working myself up to 10 lbs.

1395278,5,B000055ZGP,"I already owned a couple of Tamilee's Quick Toning videos and worried that the exercises covered on this DVD would be just a shuffling around and re-editing of those, but was happy to discover that she's put a lot of new (or new to me) exercises on here.
The DVD is organized so that Program One for each body part is ""easier"" and Program Two is more difficult.  I've been working out pretty faithfully with this DVD since January, and I am still amply challenged by Program One for all the muscle groups (read: I haven't dared to see what's in store for me in Program Two yet).  I find that while each exercise might not be terribly difficult in itself--crunches, dumbbell presses, or lunges--the way Tamilee orders them is very challenging, especially by the second set for abs and by the second and third for the arms and buns.  I do wish that there was more time spent on stretching at the end, because after the exercises, I feel like I really need it, but the Total Stretch for Beginners is excellent for that--highly recommended.
Just a word about the Alternate Angle and Music Only features--I can't see where the different angle really helps me get a better picture of how to do the exercises, and the music on this DVD is nothing special.  What makes this a really cool way to work out is that you can go right to the section you want, without messing around with rewind and fast-forward.  And I think it's nice that instead of barking at you to do more reps, Tamilee says ""4 more please.  Don't give up on yourself.""  I think that's a lot more motivating than the drill sergeant approach.",1015977600,3,1599,4.493103448275862

7931418,5,B000055ZGP,"Tamilee is my favorite instructor of all time.  She has a beautiful voice that makes it easy to follow, and she is very smart and teaches you a lot about the muscles - oh, and a helluva workout.  I recommend the neoprine weight set by Amazon Basics for her arm workout.  Had to clean the DVD, but it is now working fine.",1519430400,,320,4.129032258064516

7931424,5,B000055ZGP,"I have bought several copies of this DVD over the years. It is my go to get back into a workout routine. Very focused 15 minute strength workouts for abs, arms, and buns and who can't squeeze in 15 minutes of exercise into their day.  I like the two different levels for each body part and that you can intensify the workout with heavier hand weights or ankle weights. I also love that it doesn't require a ton of equipment- pretty much weights, a chair, and a mat if needed. I always see results quickly with this dvd as well. Great dvd to have in your arsenal if you need quick, focused workouts.",1491350400,,598,4.292035398230088
