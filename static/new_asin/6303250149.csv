7843278,1,6303250149,"I really wanted to like this flick, I mean Cinino behind the camera (The Deer Hunter) & Mickey Rourke (Diner) as an NYPD captain attempting to clean up Chinatown.  But what started out as a fair premise spiraled into a bloody, violent movie that accomplished nothing except a lot of graphic killings, sexual misconduct & trashy dialogue.  One spoiler alert; Ariane, who plays an Asian tv reporter & Rourke's love interest is horrible.  She shouts all her lines & attacks her role like a piece of cardboard waiting to be shredded.  Big names all around this picture, but very little pay-off.",1520380800,,590,4.811881188118812

7843281,5,6303250149,"When I was younger, I used to watch the Double Dragon cartoon series. And I was hooked! I keep renting movies of them, but it turned out that only this one was the best. And it also featured bonus game tips for Double Dragon V The Shadow Falls (and in my opinion is a game verson of this movie). But when I got older, I quickly outgrew it! But, maybe some day I'll wath it again! And since it has alot of actors I like, it's a great movie!
