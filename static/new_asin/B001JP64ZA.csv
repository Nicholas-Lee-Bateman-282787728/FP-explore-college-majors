8313239,2,B001JP64ZA,"Over rated I have heard a lot about this movie. But I didn't enjoy it as much as Prison Girls, Girls on Cellblock 9,or Fraulein in Uniform. Let's be honest the only reason me watch these movies is see women in their most beautiful feminine form the God created them in the raw(unshaven)may God bless women.",1509235200,,306,4.482142857142857
8313240,1,B001JP64ZA,This movie was not filmed in 3-D. This release is computer generated and manipulated. They are placing two slightly offset images in a stereo window and it does not have true depth.,1332374400,,181,4.6875
8313241,3,B001JP64ZA,"This is a pretty standard Women In Prison (WIP) flick with a few interesting twists to it.  As with any WIP, it includes shower scenes, hosedowns, catfights, food fights, lesbian trysts, mean guards, corrupt officials and a heroine who is unjustly confined because of her boneheaded boyfriend's crime. Unlike other WIPs, it does not feature tortures, killings or sadistic experiments (I'm looking at you, Pam Grier).  The actresses appear to be giving good performances but the poor English dubbing really detracts from the enjoyment of it.  This one probably should have gone the subtitle route, although even that would have been problematic since there is a lot of rapid-fire ""girl talk"" to keep up with.  If you've never seen a WIP before this might be of interest, otherwise, skip it.",1242604800,,789,5.046153846153846
