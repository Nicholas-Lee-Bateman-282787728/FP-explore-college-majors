2837224,4,B000QFCDCW,"This taut German made thriller starts out with a heart-pounding bang then kind've settles down into a war of mind games between an urban serial killer of children and a very disturbed rural cop. Not as gory as the beginning, ""Antibodies"" is still graphic and disturbing due to the dialogue and descriptions of the crimes and just enough visuals to clue you in that the killings were horrendous. There's also some fairly graphic sex and nudity. The killer really does a psychological number on the cop by apparently convincing him that evil is contagious and leading him into psychological traps that have frustrating and sometimes violent resolutions. The cop lives on a farm and has an unhappy marriage and two kids, one of whom is a 13 year old boy showing signs of ""evil starting small"". Or is he just a troubled soul like his dad? The acting is first rate and the photography is beautiful juxtaposing simple country life with big city coldness. Lags in places but overall engrossing and not for the squeamish. There are some scenes that I found too unpleasant involving animals so animal lovers beware. But for lovers of graphic psycho crime thrillers, ""Antibodies"" is an intriguing story to experience. Disc two is a ""making of..."" feature and other related extras. The print is excellent. Not a bad package for the price. Dark Sky has done a good job here.",1188432000,35,1362,4.8

2837248,2,B000QFCDCW,"Cmon people, whats with all these over zealous glorifyingly shining reviews for a film that is clearly a weak rip-off of Se7en and Silence of the Lambs? Yes this film has decent acting. It has decent production values. It has some pretty decent directing as well. But frankely I think this film is a dreadful attempt at trying to capitolize on the entire serial killer genre of american cinema and failing to be anywhere near as good on virtually every level. The music here was rather uninspiring and sounded a bit cheesy and rather dated. The presumned serial killer who was interrogated was plain boring and pretty much nowhere near as scary or as interesting as Hannibal or Bill(Silence of the Lambs), or even the Tooth Ferry from Michael Manns far superior Manhunter, the 1980s interpretation of Harriss novel Silence of the Lambs, which came years before Demmes version in 1991. While this is not at all a bad film it simply doesnt measure up at all to Se7en, Silence of the Lambs, Manhunter, and about another half dozen films about serial killers I could pull off the top of my head. Im German and have seen many German films over my lifetime. Deustchlands film industry has been crafting some truly stellar films recently that deserve to be seen far more than this one. If you haven't seen Der Baader Meinhof complex I highly recommend it. Probably the best German film I have seen in the past 20 years. About the rise and fall of Deustchlands Red Army Faction. I love foreign films and recently saw two I thought were much better than this one. The girl with the dragon Tattoo was way better than this movie, and the French film-Them are both must see films. As far as movies from my own fatherland are concerned, this one rates rather below average in my book.",1367884800,,1771,4.625396825396826
2837249,4,B000QFCDCW,"First, an IMPORTANT NOTE: DO NOT READ THE AMAZON DESCRIPTION OF THIS MOVIE...it WILL SPOIL key elements of the plot.

That said, ANTIBODIES is a really top-notch thriller written and directed by Christian Alvart (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pandorum/dp/B0038P80CO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pandorum</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Case-39/dp/B004HY699G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Case 39</a>) and it grabs your attention from start to finish.  And yes, there is more than a passing similarity to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Silence-of-the-Lambs/dp/B002CMV1N4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Silence of the Lambs</a>, but do not go into it believing you will see that movie...it's not fair to this one. ANTIBODIES is a fine movie on its own merits and should be viewed in that regard.

The movie begins with the dramatic capture of serial murderer Gabriel Engel, a pederast who will soon admit to the torture, rape and murder of 14 boys.  Yet our focus is not on those children--indeed, it is miles away in the small town of Herzbach, Germany, an idyllic rural town with a murder of its own to solve: the killing of 12-year old Lucia Flieder, a sweet village girl.

In order to put the sleepy little town's fears to rest, Herzbach police officer Michael Martens decides to travel to Berlin to see if he can interview the murderer, and it is upon their ""relationship"" that the film will rest ... hence its comparison to SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  As in that movie, this relationship will pit the innocence and naivet of the police chief against the ugly perversity of the murderer.

That's a big part of this movie, and the theme of innocence vs. corruption is used in several ways.  The innocence of youth versus the corruption of adulthood.  Love versus lust; the country versus the city; religion versus science; good versus bad...in fact, just when you think you have made a connection, that you're getting ahead of the game, the movie shifts things around on you and you're back to square one again.

I really liked ANTIBODIES, though I'm not sure exactly why it's called that, exactly...maybe it's a German thing.  Or maybe it's because so much of this little thriller gets under the skin.

The acting to be very good when it counts: Wotan Wilke Mohring plays officer Martens with conviction (no pun intended), and as he is in 90 percent of the scenes it is a good thing that one finds his complex, conscientious sensibilities so compelling. And Andre Hennicke as the very twisted serial killer is also quite good; while he is not as prone to scene-stealing moments like Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter, he plays the madman with a stern eye and is convincing as the perverse and demonic maniac.  I loved Heinz Hoenig as Commissioner Seiler, a man who comes off as the common brute so many Hollywood cops tend to be. Yet there was a surprising depth there, too: I found him to be a character who stuck with me. There were only two characters who bothered me: Marten's wife and father-in-law. Why he particularly was so hateful to Martens was never adequately achieved to my liking.

The only real fault I found with the movie is that the ending - which I loved IN PRINCIPLE - was not only a bit overdone, but depended upon a few moments of CGI that I felt were jarringly mishandled.  Not only was CGI not necessary, but the whole thing could have been done a bit better, a little less schmaltzy.  Were I to have been director Alvart I would have opted for a much less melodramatic conclusion...this is a classic case of Less Would Have Been More.

Other than that, I found ANTIBODIES to be moving and well made, and a film well worth the time.  It's one I feel richer for watching.  That one can say this about a suspense film dependent upon subtitles is a rich compliment indeed.",1366588800,,3915,5.137007874015748
2837250,4,B000QFCDCW,"If you like movies about crime and grizzly murder and gore, you will like this film. It is extremely graphic and the main character is a psychopath and even worse a religious nut who kills and molest children. I know that it sounds crazy to suggest this film to viewers, but unfortunately these people exist. It takes place in Germany and the killer has the cop wrapped around his psychological finger and really gets into his head.

The ending is a really great example of the ""surprise ending"" and it really will shock you as to how a normal person can be manipulated by an evil killer.

I would warn that this movie is very violent,explicit,and graphic. It's not my favorite movie by any means, but if you like graphic movies it is worth a look. Rent it on Amazon Prime .",1361145600,,774,4.443661971830986

2837254,4,B000QFCDCW,"Antibodies has interesting and extensive dialogue.  And a twisty plot.  No one's being hunted or held captive or tortured really, it's more about the psychological turmoil and culture shock a police officer from a small rural town goes through in the city, while also interviewing a serial killer.  It's tough to find original ideas these days, for movies, so I don`t feel that this is a knockoff of anything.  The prominent plot is original.  Don't be fooled by the backdrop of the story, that's not the theme they`re aiming for.  Not very freaky, thought provoking.  A lot of morality play going on there, as well.
It is brightly lit, I like this because it means that they're not trying to hide bad shots or inconsistent items, for instance, in the movie.  That picture on the cover is portrayed as a pose struck by the man who plays lead sociopath, but there is no single shot exactly like that in the movie.  It is only on the cover art.
Problems with my purchase.  Movie is, one, subtitled in English inside the frame and is part of the movie.  Can not be changed or turned off.  This could annoy some people.  Comparison, two, to Silence of the Lambs and Seven, for their shock value, is highly misleading or ostentatious.  Misleading in the case of Seven, which is also deliberately paced but very grotesque.  This movie is very Not, in that regard.  This movie is more thought provoking, even if those thoughts are dark conceptions in some people`s overly fragile sensibilities.  And that cerebral quality is what I like it for.  Comparing it to Silence of the Lambs is outright ostentatious.  Most of what people might find unsettling about this movie is the subversive, though rarely very revolting, discussions.  What the serial killer says, from behind bars, could easily qualify as what the ratings boards term Menace.  Menace is what Heath Ledger utilized in the batman movie.  Where I got the impression that it would be at all like SotL is uncertain to me; except that I've only read about it on Amazon.  Nudge nudge.
Watch it again, to see if you noticed something altogether very disturbing or if you just got a mild sense of disgusted contempt and disquiet, the first time, from the nature of the killings being portrayed.  Try not to retch?  The main reason this film is considered incredibly abhorrent, is because the psychotic acts in question are being committed against teenagers.  Oh, and a dog.  Compared to other movies in this genre, it is a little tame.  Supplant the teenager with an adult, no one would even flinch.  That's all I can say to any of that.
And, third but not a deal breaker, if you've read anything about this on the internet, I imagine that you know that the end has a truly silly representation of a biblical story.  It would be fine within the context of this particular plot.  But, clearly, the end would have been much more acceptable, for me, without the voice over recitation of biblical passages.  The end is not set up too very obviously, in the earlier parts of the movie.  Foreshadowed, yes.  Not so obvious unless someone gives a spoiler.  This is my biggest gripe with the movie.  At any point during production and post production, someone could have said `let's leave out that overbearing, almost rude, voice preaching at the viewer throughout the final sequence of events'.  Why do that to the movie's climax?
I don't catch the parallels in the movie to biblical stories and concepts.  All that I noticed are the ones which they outright state.  I wouldn't notice them though, myself.  So I can only trust that people who say there are subtle parallels with the bible know what they're writing about.  Then again if you're looking, you could find similarities to parts of the bible anywhere at all.  Face it, it's a huge book and speaks mostly of life and living.
Many crises of consciousness.  Focuses on the one man and every tribulation revolving around him.  Amusing bauble.  Glad I bought it.  Only disappointed by not being entirely aware of what I purchased.",1333929600,3,4027,4.7130559540889525
2837266,4,B000QFCDCW,"<strong>Antik&ouml;rper</strong> (Christian Alvart, 2005)

Christian Alvart is another European director Hollywood imported and then destroyed. (viz. the worthless <em>Pandorum</em>.) There are any number of good things I can say about <em>Antik&ouml;rper</em>, released in English-speaking countries as <em>Antibodies</em>, with the understanding--which I will put before you right now--that the final scene of the movie undermines a great deal of it.

Plot: we open with the police raiding the flat of suspected serial killer Gabriel Engel <em>Der Untergang</em>'s Andr&eacute; Hennicke). He is captured and sent to prison, but refuses to speak to authorities, with one exception: to demand the presence of Michael Martens (<em>Das Experiment</em>'s Wotan Wilke M&ouml;hring), a small-town cop haunted by a long-unsolved murder. Engel hints that, while he didn't kill the victim in that case, he knows who did, which entices Martens to the big city. Eventually, the two of them begin a cat-and-mouse game that strains Martens' relationship with his family and ultimately forces him to question his own sanity...and that of those around him.

For the majority of its length, this is a fantastic film, the kind of mystery/thriller that begs comparison with <em>The Silence of the Lambs</em>, <em>Se7en</em>, and <em>Kyua</em>. Alvart, who also wrote the script, sets this up as well as the central mystery in any of those (or in any of the first... say, four or five... Prime Suspect episodes, which is what this reminded me of most, for some reason), gives us well-drawn and interesting characters we can care about, paces things brilliantly, comes up with just about the perfect climax...and then comes that final scene, which slaps the taste out your mouth (TM Dr. Dre). It's just downright awful, full of saccharine and syrup and oh my ever-loving haddock. I wanted to throw things at the television, Alvart blew the ending so horribly. And yet still, the first two hours of this two hour and seven minute movie are excellent, and worth watching. Just turn it off when--without giving away spoilers--you hear the helicopter during the final scene and you'll be fine. *** ",1332979200,,2175,5.3695014662756595

2837271,5,B000QFCDCW,"A routine distress call brings the infamous Crucifix child killer into police custody, where he confesses to the murders of thirteen children and a policeman before shutting himself off completely. It is up to a rural policeman that discovered the murdered body of a young girl that was possibly linked to the Crucifix killer to extract the information from him, but in order to find out the truth he will have to enter the darkest recesses of the human soul and face his own personal demons. ANTIBODIES is a perverse psychological thriller that deconstructs the concepts of good and evil. Its interrogation sequences are intense and profoundly disturbing, focusing on The Crucifix's quivering lips and ecstatic expressions as he recalls the brutal rapes and murders of his young victims for his own arousal. Director Christian Alvart tastefully phases out the dialog of the scene just as it becomes unbearable, having already achieved a gut-wrenching reaction from the viewer. Andre Hennicke also delivers a bone-chilling performance as the child murdering Gabriel Engel, whose twisted games only serve to confuse and corrupt the idealistic Officer Martens. The exchanges between the two characters clearly reference Thomas Harris' Hannibal Lector  series, but they do so effectively with their own unique twists. ANTIBODIES combines its beautiful shooting locations, heightened tension, and deep characterizations to form a powerful and shocking murder mystery that deserves more attention than it has received in its International release.

2837274,4,B000QFCDCW,"It comes from the same mordant tradition as the best serial killer films but Antibodies is far more than a German Silence of the Lambs. The cat-and-mouse mind games take place between an earnest, righteous small town cop and a sadistic killer who's sicker, realer and therefore so much scarier than Hannibal Lector.

Pedophile killer Gabriel Engle has been caught, but that's just the beginning. In his wake of sadism Engle left a quiet German suburb in turmoil with a dead young girl. Everyone, including police chief Martens, would be happy to let the monstrous Engles take the wrap for this murder as well, but Martens knows for innocence to be protected the truth must come out at any cost.

Certainly Engle knows something about the case, and Martens sets off to interview the killer in hopes of learning the truth. As he scrapes futiley away at the mystery, something dark begins to leach into him from the city, his disturbing encounters with Engle and the doubt that grows more ominous everyday.

Two police officers come to investigate a call of some screaming heard form an apartment.

But one officer is absent, the determinedly angelic Michael Martens aka The Farmer (Wotan Wilke Mohring, who is also perfect).  The film follows The Farmer as he tries to determine if Engel is in fact responsible for the murder of a young girl in his town.  But it is not just a mystery.  Antibodies is also a treatise on good and evil.  What is evil?  How does it develop?  Is there a gray area where they both simultaneously exist without conflict?

There is some gore, a lot of mystery, many thrills (some cheap), but every scene is saturated with intelligence.  Antibodies is a thriller/serial killer film in the ilk of Silent of the Lambs.  And not just because the audience gets to see Engel and The Farmer have a verbal battle of good and evil (one which is eventually made physical within the Farmer), but because of the intelligence of the characters and the film itself.

2837305,4,B000QFCDCW,"Movies about serial murderers have flooded theaters and Dvd shelves for quite sometime. Some are good, others mediocre and very few really does stand out. The German-produced thriller-melodrama ""ANTIBODIES"" (2005, aka. Antikorper) does stand out. It is gripping, has a very involving storyline and does play like a character study for both the protagonist and the antagonist. The film will definitely have comparisons to ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Seven"", but believe me, the film can stand on its own. Amazon friend Chris Blackshere recommended this film to me and I am very thankful.

For many years, Germany has been menaced by a ""Crucifix Killer"", a ruthless murderer that preys on young men. One evening, the killer has supposedly been apprehended by the local authorities after an intense encounter. The killer has been identified as a man named Gabriel Engel (Andre Hennicke) and he is psychosis and evil incarnate. A religious country cop named Michael Martens (Wotan Wilke Mohring) is obsessing over the murder of Lucia Fielder who had been found dead some years ago. The townsfolk insists that Engel is Lucia's murderer but Martens isn't so certain. He decides to go to Berlin just to make sure. Upon his arrival, Engel is fascinated by this country cop and decides that he would talk to no one but Martens. Martens begins his interrogation of the psychotic killer, little does he know that he may be connected to the killer himself in a very sinister way...

The film is a thought-provoking drama thriller that takes us into the depths of two men: Martens and Engel--good and evil. From the film's opening act, when Engel has been apprehended by police, you have an idea exactly what you are in for. Well, at least the film gives a misleading image that the murderer is caught and the nightmare is over--WRONG. The nightmare is just starting as the film presents a character study of Michael Martens. The man is supposed to be incorruptible; he goes to church, and follows the laws of man and God. Now this `good' cop is about to meet evil incarnate in the form of Gabriel Engel. The man supposedly has 14 victims under his belt and this doesn't mean that he has stopped adding names to his list. He mocks well-known serial killers like Jack the Ripper and Charles Manson, stating that society had glorified these two when they don't deserve much credit. With the film's opening act, the viewer is given a chilling impression and sets the film's tone; that they are to be taken for a ride and the film does not disappoint.

The tensions in the film begin when Martens and Engel begin their conversations. Admittedly, at first, I thought I was going to see a rethread of ""Silence of the Lambs"" or ""Red Dragon"" but the film quickly disperses this idea as director Christian Alvart presents an experience that is an effective blend of a crime thriller and a psychological study. The sharp-tongued dialogue will undoubtedly turn off some viewers, with its talk of child predators and sexual abuse. The images are actually quite twisted and disturbing but the scenes aren't done in bad taste and becomes an integral part of the film itself. The film examines the roots of evil and/or the evil that men do. The relationship between Martens and his son, Christan (Hauke Diekamp) is explored in dynamic fashion. The psychotic persona of simple ordinary folks and just what drives them to do such horrendous crimes.

Michael Martens have his own share of issues; an overbearing father-in-law and subtle hints were shown that his marriage isn't really in good terms as he sleeps in a separate bed in the same room with his wife. The film is actually a study a decent man and of psychosis itelf: what makes them so and just how it is that psychotics seemed to have no qualms between right and wrong. Some religious aspects are put to bear and these elements may seem a little heavy-handed to some viewers but to me, it was a stroke of fortitude and brilliance. The film's main premise is all about Martens and while Engel is arguably the more compelling of the two, Martens is the film's central focus.

Despite the film's riveting experience, the film does have its flaws. There was one investigation scene that had a major goof and some of its elements felt like they were too convenient. Barowski's character seemed a minor plot device to add complications while Seiler (Heinz Hoenig) is some sort of support and his character is a little underdeveloped. But these are minor flaws that can easily be forgotten.

Is evil really infectious? Are murderers born or are they made? These are the haunting questions that the film dares to ask in its very ambitious script. Alvart uses a Bible passage to reach its conclusion that I rather enjoyed. The film isn't visually bloody or brutal, but the experience does leave you that cerebral sensation. ""Antibodies"" is NOT a film for everyone because of the dialogue and the fact that it is a film about sexual predators, it will prove a little hard to take. There is also a graphic sex scene. The film's climax may be a little heavy-handed and will more than likely disappoint some viewers. But I rather think that it was quite surprising and goes in a direction that wasn't expected.

I'd hate to repeat myself; but again, the film is not for everyone and those who are looking for an abundance of violence will be disappointed. The film is more an enthralling study of a man and evil itself. The film is more a psychological chiller than a horror film but Hennicke's and Mohring's performances does give it an oddly creepy feel. The film's climax will undoubtedly provoke mixed reactions-- for me, it fit the film's premise and was surprising.

2837306,4,B000QFCDCW,"Antibodies has a fairly large Silence of the Lamb influence to it, which definitely isn't a bad thing. In fact, I would say it's one of its strengths.

Andr Hennicke's portrayal of Gabriel Engel is generally psychotic, disturbing, and extraordinary. He steals just about every scene he's in. Andr was Gabriel. As disturbing as his performance is, it's also truly mesmerizing.

Wotan Wilke Mhring as Michael Martens is also quite good. He does a fantastic job portraying a cop who was once such an abiding citizen who was a religious man who cared very much about his family and is now beginning to lose his grip on his so called perfect life.

The religious parallels are also incredibly interesting and the movie does a good job of pointing them out to you. The similarities between Michael and Abraham are uncanny. The film makes you think you know where it's headed and then winds up taking a detour and going in the opposite direction.

Antibodies has a few flaws that mainly lie within the script, but winds up being an excellent crime/drama/horror/thriller. The story is very well-written, the cast is top notch, excellent cinematography, and the film isn't predictable. Something a lot of movies these days can't claim. Well worth the time to sit down and watch.

2837307,5,B000QFCDCW,"This is broooootal super sick stuff!  Harsh, relentless, disturbing.  One of the most startling psychological horror flicks in recent years.  Called Germany's Silence of the Lambs.

Berlin police arrest a deranged psychopath suspected of molesting and killing 13 children.  This sadistic freak's name is Gabriel, and he refuses to speak to anyone except Michael Martens, an honorable officer from a small town.  As his reasons for this becomes evident, your comfort level will get severely rattled.  The prisoner knows some unsettling secrets about Michael's son, and the truth will envoke rage and fear from all that are exposed.

Antibodies is superbly directed and acted.  It deals with some harsh topics that obviously won't appeal to many viewers.  But in reality, evil knows no boundaries.  More gruesome, twisted, and real than many care to endure.

Evil is a virus.  It's highly contagious, and you're already infected...",1222473600,21,929,5.324137931034483
2837308,5,B000QFCDCW,"Great movie, crazy story!

I watch alot of foreign films and in doing so, I've watched alot of pure garbage, not ""Antibodies"", it grabs hold and sucks you in.

Excellent characters and twists and turns, German movies are no holds barred, by that I mean, anything goes and when I say anything, I mean anything. This movie has blood, guts, sex and a great story wrapped around it all.

Recommended!",1211068800,,396,4.628571428571429

2837310,5,B000QFCDCW,"This film starts off right away with action! It immediately draws you in and you care about almost everyone present in the film. In some way or another, each character contributes to the story which is told in a very well structured script. Of  course, with the dark subject matter you are taken to some places where you wouldn't want to go. But it's a testament to this film that as an audience member I felt like I had gone right along with the journey and actually appreciated the experience.
It's something to watch with as many people as you can gather because there are so many different levels to the story, you'll want to discuss it (and experience this film) with others.",1192147200,3,680,4.528455284552845
2837311,5,B000QFCDCW,"First of all, this was a very painful movie for me to watch, at times. Please be forewarned that it may be particularly hard for parents to watch, although I can't really say much about that or I'll ruin the movie for you.

  As the suspense builds as well as doubts about guilt, innocence, good and evil and there are Biblical quotes used, particularly towards the end of the movie, as questions about parents and children come together. There are some very graphic sexual scenes, violence, etc.

  I would never watch this with my kids or even recommend it for a teenager, perhaps because I found it so intense and hard to take sometimes. Also, this is subtitled so if you don't like foreign films, you may not like this.

  Best described as a psychological suspense thriller, you'll find that the movie moves slowly at times but I actually enjoyed the pacing, as it allowed me to get to know the main characters, especially that of the  constable in a small town, a location described as being rather provincial.

  As the constable, Michael, becomes more and more enmeshed with a murder suspect, he finds himself questioning his own values and issue about how innocent ANYONE is. Eventually, his doubt starts to affect his family and work life, caught up in the mind games of the killer as well as his own dark side.

  I won't say more for fear of spoiling the suspense of this one.",1191628800,17,1388,4.58130081300813
2837312,5,B000QFCDCW,"First things first- don't read the amazon description above; it absolutely spoils everything up to the final 10 minutes of the movie.  If you like suspense at all, resist the urge to look up.

On to the film- I've seen some films with narrow audiences, but this takes the cake.  The film has the most to offer to somebody who values the Old Testament (specifically Christians and Jews) due to the number of OT references along with a couple of NT refs.  Thematically, the film explores some of the more troubling concepts in Christianity, especially.

What, you say?  There are plenty of Christians and Jews.  Well, all of the philosophy and theology is heavily wrapped up in one of the most graphic serial killer films to come around in some time.  Not only are there some graphic images (grisly stuff as well as a pretty graphic sex scene), the language invites even worse images than appear on screen.

So for the Christian or Jew that can get past the above, this is an extremely interesting film.  Come for a psychological thriller with superlative acting and cinematography, stay for the way the director plays with Biblical concepts and forces you to think.

Finally, I'll say 1 more thing for those who are still on the fence.  The film begins with a quote from Dostoevsky.  In retrospect, the choice is incredibly apt; I feel that Dostoevsky could have written this had he lived now.  If the names Ivan and Raskolnikov bring forth positive memories, then you're in for a treat.",1190160000,62,1486,4.709302325581396
