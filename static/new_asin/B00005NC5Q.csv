7946682,5,B00005NC5Q,"This is a very complex, but understandable crime-violence-COMEDY movie that kept me glued to my TV for the entire time.  This movie masterfully combines crime, violence, gore, and comedy into a seamless, fantastic movie.  The post-production beats the Krap out of ANY $100 million movie, bar none.  If you as much as own a video camera, you will appreciate what has been done with this movie.  I would say if you are reading this, you like this type of movie.  If you do, BUY IT!  Trust me when I say you will love it as much as I do.
BUY IT AND WATCH IT!!!
