2220113,4,B0007MVXRU,"I like this DVD because the exercises are easy to do for a great grandma.  No advice given about weights however.  So I chose 1 pound weights for starters. Now I am using 2 pound hand-held weights and 1 pound ankle weights.  I also bought Sunshine's Resistance Bands DVD.  The warm-up, cool down, calisthinics and pilates exercises are identical on both DVDs.  A waste of money in my opinion.  So I suggest just the Light Weights because it gently works most muscle groups and you can use heavier weights as your strength increases.  The Resistance Band DVD came with two stretch bands for the upper body, no stretch band for legs.  Another waste of money.",1218931200,16,656,4.643478260869565
2220114,5,B0007MVXRU,"This is a good beginner's routine. I like the beach setting and Sunshine - the gal who demonstrates and narrates it. It is well done and straightforward, easy to follow. Sunshine is a good role model for fitness in older women.",1216425600,8,227,4.560975609756097
2220115,5,B0007MVXRU,"This is a gentle easy non Impact non Aerobic exercise routine, The pace is slow & relaxed, and the exercises are done with Light weights for the upper body that can be done sitting or standing.

The 2nd part for the lower body exercises are done standing while holding the the back of a chair for added balance.

Sunshine first demonstrates and explains the exercise and then she starts the exercise making it very easy to follow.

This is a good easy routine for Seniors & Elderly that want to do some exercises routine with Light weights to maintain your muscles and get stronger, have more balance which I have gotten from exercising with this tape.

I Highly  recommend this to Seniors and  Those  that want to get stronger and stay active and Independent.",1137196800,92,760,4.626865671641791
2220116,5,B0007MVXRU,"I am now 75 years old and work as a full-time histologist. I retired and decided to return to work. I keep up with the demanding and interesting and intricate workload for three and a half years.

I have been greatly assisted in doing so as a result of the muscle-strengthening exercises I have been doing with the Seniors Lightweight and Seniors Resistance Bands Funcercise Dvds. My sister Daisy & Myself have lost weight about Ten lbs, each and feel more energetic everyday.

I no longer have shoulder pains when operating the microtone. I have received numerous compliments since my sister (age 73) and I have been training with these Dvds which are very simple & easy to do. The way Sunshine first demonstrates the Exercises and then the Funcercises start making it very easy for us to follow. The resistance bands are great because they conform to my/sisters resistance levels.

I literally run up the steps to reach the LIRR train every day.

We love these beautiful Dvds that are filmed on the beach. Also the narration is very simple with nice music. Altogether this is the best seniors exercise Dvd that we have and love to use it a lot.

These wonderful Seniors Funcercise & Lightweight exercise DVDs are good for Seniors and Elderly like us.

We highly recommend these DVDs to anyone who wants to gain better health, strength and mobility.",1113436800,78,1350,4.747863247863248
2220121,5,B0007MVXRU,"This is an excellent exercise DVD for almost any level of fitness.  Here is why:  you can vary the pounds of your weights, you can do the exercises either sitting or standing and when she does 10 repetitions you can start with less and build up.  I highly recommend it. There are exercises with and without weights. You need to buy your own weights.
 I teach exercise classes for senior and I wanted something to give my mother because she does not live near my classes.  I tried this video and like it so much that I also bought one for myself.
Watch it all the way to the end, the relaxation part is wonderful too.",1449187200,6,616,4.275862068965517

2220129,5,B0007MVXRU,"I am real satisfied with this product. I have had several on the job injuries and severe arthritis, but this video was not a painful workout. Most excerise DVD are too fast, hard on the joints, and makes you want to give up- this one doesn't.",1420070400,3,242,4.282608695652174
2220130,5,B0007MVXRU,Great easy to follow instructions. Great for slower paced exercise. I would recomend this for seniors.,1416700800,2,102,5.4375

amount of standing exercises! Easy to follow!

2220132,4,B0007MVXRU,"My seniors really enjoyed this video.  Easy to following and beautiful scenery.  However, Sunshine is always a hot topic - man or woman?",1396483200,,136,4.869565217391305
2220133,4,B0007MVXRU,"We found  the DVD generally useful, but Sunshine's smile was a bit distracting at times. A split screen with 2 levels showing would have been nice.",1390003200,2,147,4.653846153846154
2220134,1,B0007MVXRU,I am very disappointed with this dvd.  The quality is grainie and very poor..  The presentation  is amateur. It is very easy and really only appropriate for someone who is not able to stand. This was a waste of money.,1389139200,3,217,4.375
2220135,3,B0007MVXRU,"I got this for an elderly out of shape friend hoping to get him to exercise.  I too am elderly but in fairly good shape.  Before showing it to him I did the exercises, first without any weights at all and then with light weights.  It's a reasonable workout for shoulders and legs.  There's no cardio which is good because that can be a concern for some elderly people.  Since he has no real issues other than being out of shape generally, I'm expecting we can move on to a slightly more  interesting routine in six weeks or so.
  The exercises are easy to follow and can be made more challenging by using increasingly heavy weights.  My problem with the tape is that the exercise section is fairly short and is then followed by a very long ""relaxation"" section with pictures of flowers and fish which I found unnecessary.  Instead I would have liked to have seen a second section with slightly more demanding exercises for when we have graduated from the first section.",1388880000,7,969,4.517241379310345

2220137,5,B0007MVXRU,"Sunshine demonstrates these exercises so well.  She is a good instructor.  It is good she smiles a lot, but it would be better if she was talking as she did the exercises rather than having a narrator being her ""voice.""
What does this matter when the purpose was to begin an exercise program to strengthen my back, improve my staminia and help me loose weight?  I have a critical back condition that needed strengthening, my chiropractor okay my use of this DVD and all of Sunshine's low impact ones, with some cautions, until my back improves to the place where I can jump into these exercises without restrictions.",1382140800,4,616,4.685185185185185
2220138,5,B0007MVXRU,Although the change time between each exercise is a little short this is a good beginning weight lifting workout for seniors - using 2lb weights - the always smiling instructor grows on you after awhile :-),1370217600,,206,4.75
2220139,3,B0007MVXRU,"I did not find it much different than some exercises that I have been doing all along.  Actually too easy to

2220146,3,B0007MVXRU,"The exercises are fine, but I can't stand the model. I think she was told to keep smiling at all times, I watch her and it looks too much like a grimace. No one holds a smile that long...she never stops and I continue to look away from the screen. I also wish they had let her explain the moves, it would have looked natural. A small thing to some people I know, but it really bothers me. But for the purpose for which it was made its very good.",1298246400,3,445,3.9555555555555557
