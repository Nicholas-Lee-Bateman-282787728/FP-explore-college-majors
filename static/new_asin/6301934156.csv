381089,5,6301934156,"I have seen many film adaptations of Kenneth Grahame's excellent book, and this is by far the best.  This is the first I have seen that even tried to stay faithful to the book.  Most other adaptations seem to think the book is too slow and boring and needs to be spiced up with extra violence.  This film captures the spirit of the book quite well and I recommend it to all who love classic children's literature.",1106092800,23,413,4.337662337662338
381090,5,6301934156,"This movie was charming and captivating when I watched it as a child, and having seen it for the first time in fifteen years or so, I can honestly say it hasn't aged a bit. In fact, it really seems to have resonance in today's world.  The voiceovers are Pythonesque, the humor is right-on, and the songs are brilliant.

So British, and yet somehow so universal...",1104019200,16,363,4.484848484848484
381091,2,6301934156,"I was delighted by the stop-motion animation, the charming tale, and the lively songs, when all of a sudden I, turning to my wife, said, ""Did that just say what I think it said?""  It had, just a bit of profane language, my 2-year-old daughter absorbing all that was on the screen.  Disappointment had barely set in when something a little worse was said, this time by Badger.  Such things exclude my family from viewing what would have otherwise been a pleasant treat.

The colour and quality are excellent and the story and voice overs are a trip back to glory days of English gentility. My children still watch this continually and whilst it may not appeal to the ""action comix"" kid (or adult)it is a  masterpiece and is simply redolent with atmosphere.

  Attention fans of British TV and especially Britcoms! This is NOT the ""Wind In The Willows"" feature with Peter Sallis (of Last Of The Summer Wine, only the finest and longest-running comedy in the history of the human laugh). I originally believed it was and like a blame fool put that up here in a review. I apologize to anyone who purchased it based on my previous review; I never meant to mislead anyone.
Thanks & Sorry -
God Bless You -

381160,5,6301934156,"I have been a true fan of The Wind in the Willows since I was introduced to it on the Disney channel in the 1980's. This outing of this tale is my very favorite version of Wind in the Willows. I absolutely am mesmerized by the quality of the production especially the stop-action(motion ) of the puppet characters. To me this is the very best production of the classic tale and well worth the price. It is not a Disney production, whether a well made classic tale of Ratty, Mole, Badger, and Toad. The background is amazingly realistic and down right beautiful. The production made me feel as if I were there. I have been searching for this classic Pearson/Grahame tale since its airing on the Disney channel in the mid-80's.

The stop-motion photography gives the film exactly the kind of gentle fantasy feel that this story deserves.  The actors' performances are outstanding and the sets, dialog and action make me feel like I'm living inside this beloved classic of children's literature.

Best of all - it develops the characters and gives each of them time to settle into your consciousness so that as the plot progresses you have a real ""feel"" for Rat, Toad, Badger and Mole.

I owned and loved a taped-off-the-TV version of this for twenty years and was thrilled to find that this is now available on DVD.

Truly the following movie/TV program sings with beauty.  If you have ever seen a film of the work involved in this type of puppet film it is almost unbelievable that there are people who have that type of patience!  Every detail is a wonder--the backgrounds, the animal's bodies and gestures, the gentle music, the lighting, the clever writing (the TV series is clever and true to the spirit of the book; the film is very true to the book).

This movie and the sets of TV programs are worth every penny.  I CANNOT speak to the movie of A Tale of Two Toads as I haven't seen it.  But the original puppet movie and the BBC series are what I have been speaking of.

381316,4,6301934156,"Cosgrove Hall's charming stop-motion animated adaptation of the Kenneth Grahame story is spectacular family entertainment. Originally shown on the BBC in 1983, I was first introduced to the series in the late `80s on PBS. I was probably about four at the time and I was unfamiliar with the story upon which it's based. But I was immediately taken by the subtle sophistication of the film. The animation was unlike anything I'd ever seen and to this day it holds a great fascination to me. The first film in this set is a marvelous adaptation of the book, which is remarkable considering the length of the book and the film is just under an hour and a half long. The second film, from 1989, is a silly sequel that retains the charm of the original even though it's not based upon Grahame's tale. Both films are worthy of a spot on your family's DVD shelf.

The Wind in the Willows - 1983
The story concerns a group of animal characters that live in the English countryside. There Mole, sick of spring cleaning, has decided to go out into the sun and visit his friend Ratty. They enjoy a good day of ""messing about in boats"" and having a picnic (where we are first introduced to the nefarious weasels). Finally Mole and Ratty pay a visit to the wealthy and eccentric Mr. Toad who shifts from one neurotic obsession to another. Soon he becomes entranced by motorcars and is revealed to be a danger to himself as well as the other animals. With that in mind Mole and Ratty seek out the reclusive Badger, whose great wisdom might be an asset in reeling Toad in and exorcising him of his ""motorcar mania"". But it's too late for Toad has stolen a car and been involved in yet another accident. Toad is sent to prison and the weasels move into his home, making it their headquarters for delinquency. But Toad manages to escape with the help of a washerwoman and enlists the aid of Ratty, Mole and Badger in an attempt to recapture Toad Hall.

The Wind in the Willows: A Tale of Two Toads - 1989
In this sequel, the weasels seek revenge on Mr. Toad and once again take over Toad Hall. This time they utilize another Toad, this one an actor, and succeed in temporarily dividing the animals and turning them against each other. It's not long before their treachery is revealed and the two Toads must confront one another to decide who will possess Toad Hall.

The DVDs are produced by A&E, to whom I am grateful for this release, but unfortunately neither of the films have been remastered or given a proper restoration. This causes the film to look faded and there are numerous times where artifacts (spots of dirt, dust and debris) can be seen. Although this can be rather annoying, it never depreciates the enjoyment of the viewing. This series is highly recommended not only for its nostalgic value but also for its superlative storytelling. Truly a family classic!

I don't know how to convince you to buy this but I'd start by making the suggestion to buy this one first watch The Wind in The Willows, then A Tale of TWo Toads, purchase series one and two and three if they really have one. I heard there was a series three but I haven't bought it yet. Then watch them all over again. I'm a 33 year old woman and I saw these when I was young something about them just stuck with me. It wasn't til a few months ago that I re-discovered them since childhood. There's something poetic and classic and beautiful about them. The stop animation, the details of the characters and the voices...all of it poetry. With a beautiful peaceful message of living life with simplicity and appreciating all the beauty nature and the whole world offers. Something like that you get what I'm trying to put across here. It's beautiful, really enjoyable and leaves you feeling at peace with the way things are, really at peace with simplicity and what treasures say a warm cup of hot chocolate could bring on a rainy day all safely tucked inside your dry warm home. Things like that..that's what the wind in the willows brings. I hope you don't miss your chance or your children don't miss the chance to enjoy that.",1207267200,21,1279,4.40084388185654

381344,5,6301934156,"I've seen the original movie and the majority of the episodes of the television show and I have to say that this movie is my favorite of them all.  It has everything that the original movie and television series have, the same wonderful detail, charming script, and great voice acting.  (Looking at the detail of Toad's new steam-powered boat in the opening scene was just awe-inspiring.)  I even think it is superior to the original film and earlier seasons of the television show when it comes to picture clarity, fluidity of animation, and color.  Though I'm sure this has a great deal to do with ever-improving technology and experience on the part of the filmmakers.

As for the story, Toad is kidnapped by the weasels and a smooth-talking actor who has agreed to impersonate Toad so no one will suspect.  They lock the real Toad in his basement and take over Toad Hall.  Hilarity ensues!  For example, in one scene Toad attempts to escape by dressing himself as a maid but still has his trousers and shoes on under the dress, something even the dim-witted weasels pick up on.  Of course, everything turns out fine in the end and Badger, Rat, and Mole help the real Toad regain his home. Though, personally, I would have liked to see a bit more of Isambard (the actor Toad), who made a very good new villain in addition to the standard Chief Weasel and his minions.  Also, this movie is a bit short at only an hour long.  The DVD does come with an episode from the third season of the show, however.

Of my Cosgrove Hall Wind in the Willows collection, this gets the most play and stands out as my favorite episode.  It makes me laugh every time.  It's a great little movie for anyone who loves the original movie or The Wind in the Willows story!",1177632000,,1752,4.503164556962025

381346,4,6301934156,"I am a fan of the BBC shows but, not having cable, only see what I rent.  The book, Wind in the Willows, is an old favorite of mine, though, so I felt good about purchasing the movies.  When I previewed them (I always preview, even when a movie rating states it is appropriate for children) I was happy with the interpretation of the tales yet admittedly a little concerned that the stop-motion characters might be boring for my children.  They are used to the flash and noise of Disney, Warner Bros. and other animation giants.  Still, the content was good so I handed them over.  Both my son and daughter sat through the entire movie, then the 5 year old wanted to watch it again.  The Tale of Two Toads also got their attention and now both movies are watched on a regular basis.  It's good to see my children can appreciate the art and more subtle humor of movies such as these in addition to the prompted-responses typical in modern animation.",1168819200,14,948,4.445086705202312

381351,5,6301934156,"A note to previous reviewers:

When Toad says

""Mole, you silly ASS!""  He is NOT swearing, but calling Mole a jackass- a silly ninny, a nincompoop, a DONKEY (as per Biblical vocabulary).  I'm tempted to use the phrase myself.

""Ass"" is not a swear word in this context, and there is no reason to shield children from this masterful film adaptation of a classic book.  Might as well shield children from the Bible itself.  But thanks for your review, all the same.

Another thought- what two-year-old is able to pay attention to a movie long enough to get as far as the point at which that word is used, anyway??

----------

Now a note to prospective buyers:

Never has there been a more masterfully-created rendition of K. Grahame's work.  The lyrics to the songs come straight from Grahame's pen, and the music itself it nothing short of delightful.  The skilled (and famous) actors who perform the voices of our riverside friends must also be commended.  Altogether stunning.

This movie is one of TWO book adaptations in the history of cinema that have surpassed their original literary form (the other being ""The Snowman"").  The ""Wind in the Willows"" television spinoff (also available on Amazon) doesn't slack off a bit; it's just as high-quality as this movie.

Excellent viewing for the ENTIRE family.  I certainly look forward to subsequent DVD releases of the tv series.",1121212800,63,1380,4.849785407725322
381352,5,6301934156,"I grew up with this movie and I must say that other than Lord of the Rings and other extremely good movies, this is one of the best I have ever seen.  The soundtrack alone is one of my favorites, not just the main theme you hear but also the songs that characters in the movie sing.  The detail is amazing in every respect, the only thing wrong is that you can't figure out what type of medium they used.  Im stil not sure if its claymation or what.

If you want something that you and your children (or simply friends that like happy movies or silly musicals) will love, get this, you won't regret it.",1116374400,10,602,4.163793103448276
381353,5,6301934156,"When I first learned of this show I instantly fell in love with it.  When I learned they did many episodes I enjoyed even that much more.  Many years later I finally learned just how many episodes they did, and realized I must have missed out on many of them, and was in utter shock and awe at all the wonderful work that Cosgrove and Hall did.  This first single disc DVD is on the feature length episode that Cosgrove and Hall produced.  Take one of my favorite styles of animation, add some talented (and a few favorite) British voice actors, and add the creative talent of Cosgrove and Hall, and give them an inspiring loveable book, and you get an immense amount of Family Fun Time.  After you view this one feature length episode hold on to your hats.  To be released around March of 2005 is the first of about 5 volumes A&E plans to produce, so that they may be the very first in the market to completely release to the public every single one of the 65 (YES, you heard that right ""65!"") 20 minute episodes that the talented Cosgrove and Hall company produced.  Never before has the public been allowed to purchase and view in their homes every single episode of this fantastic series.  The only things in the past that were release on tape were the feature length episode, and about 3 or 4 tapes with 3 episodes each (with 1 or 2 episodes changed out when they were reproduced a couple of times).  It's shocking that it took this long to let the public in all this fun (Who's been hoarding and hiding all these recordings anyway?).  Thanks finally to A&E for being the first company to get the rights (after several others had the rights over the years) to devote all the time and effort they are going to do to get all the episodes out to the public.  YEAH for A&E!  So many of us have been longing for such a lengthy amount of time to finally own every episode.  I especially enjoy this show just tad bit more than others, as this show helped bring me out of a dark depressing time I went through early one year, when I happened to stumble upon this show again on a PBS channel, and low and behold by some freak of nature they were airing some of the episodes in the early to mid 90's.

On to a side comment, I don't know how someone can give this show a bad rating, and then also go on a rant about it having bad language.  What show were you watching anyway?  Unless you're a super uptight paranoid parent who gets offended by everyone else in world, this show is certainly for everyone.  So don't let any kind of review like that deter you from having any kind of fun.  RUN, don't walk, and get your copies of every single one of these episodes, and start having a great fun time.",1108080000,57,2693,4.27810650887574
7817192,3,6301934156,"I have a collection of different movies ( versions of the story, one or 2 sequels) even some audiobooks and kindle books... I know the story so well I can recite large passages... but I have no idea what this is ( version of the original story or sequel. If it is the former, then it doesnt deserve any stars because it is so far removed from what from what Kenneth Grahame wrote that the story is almost unrecognizable... if it is a sequel then that is different... it didn't hold my interest passed the 5  minute mark, but then I have a high standard for sequels this story, so I am probably not the best person to ask.

From what I did watch, I was a bit disappointed by the addition of what appeared to be a clear villain ( that creepy second toad).

On the plus side, the animation was well done. However if you want a version that is faithful to the playful spirit of the book The Rankin and Base musical is version is the best by far in my opinion ( its so well done that I could have sworn that it done by Disney. Disney did not get  around to making a feature-length version before his death. He only did a short version).  The rankin and Base version is about 95% accurate with regard to the events of book. If however you want something that is more solemn in tone, and almost 100% accurate with regard to how the story unfolds, I highly recommend the version from 1996, that comes with the bonus disc  The Willows in Winter.

Since I am not sure of what the creators of a tale of 2 toads intended it to be, I am completely at a loss for how to rate it... its like trying to rate an invention without having the foggiest idea what its supposed to do. The above rating gives the creators th benefit of the doubt by assuming that they were aiming for a sequel, which is a daring undertaking ( do it well and you have a huge instant fan base, do it poorly and you will likely be faced with a large group of annoyed people).

Dont get me wrong, I can see how those who grew with this would cherish it as favorite version. However, serious fans of the book who have never seen this movie before are likely to be confused at best because it doesnt appear to follow the original story and there are no clear markers to indicate that it is a sequel ( I think it would be better if it had a prologue or at least a subtitle  1 year after toad returned to toad hall...).",1523059200,,2370,4.1347826086956525
