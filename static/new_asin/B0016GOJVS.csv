3156380,5,B0016GOJVS,"I watched this movie after reading that it inspired many Bollywood actors (including SRK).  Kabhi Kabhi has a little bit of everything - love, young love, dreamy love, love denied, and developing love.  Although the movie is on the long side, the story keeps one involved and entertained.  Compared to more recent movies, the special effects are very dated; however, the love stories of the main characters are engaging.  Take a chance on love and watch Kabhi Kabhi.",1299888000,,466,4.935897435897436
3156381,5,B0016GOJVS,"The product description is for another movie ""Kabhi Khushie Kabhi Gham"" which is NOT to be confused with ""Kabhi Kabhie"", though both star Bollywood icon Amitabh Bachchan.

The title song from the movie ""Kabhi Kabhie"", ""Kabhi Kabhie Mere Dil Mein"" is one of the most beautiful and meaningful songs I've ever heard, a perfect blend of meaning and rhythm. Though I was a child when this movie was released in the 70s, my mother played it so often at home that I memorized the lyrics (without even truly understanding the meaning of the song until years later!). The movie stars several Bollywood icons such as Amitabh Bachchan, Shashi Kapoor, Raakhee Gulzar, Waheeda Rehman, and many others (including Rishi Kapoor and Neetu Singh).

Directed by Yash Chopra (known for making many memorable Bollywood romances such as Waqt,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lamhe-Classic-Indian-Cinema-Bollywood-Movie-Hindi-Film-DVD/dp/B0016GOJPY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lamhe (Classic Indian Cinema / Bollywood Movie / Hindi Film DVD)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chandni/dp/B0016GOJFE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chandni</a>, etc., the movie tells of the doomed romance between a talented poet (played by Amitabh Bachchan) and a student at a local college (portrayed by Raakhee Gulzar). The pair go their separate ways, and marry different people. But years later, a twist of fate sees their paths crossing again. Frankly, I was more taken by the focus on the earlier romance between the doomed lovers rather than the latter romance between Rishi Kapoor (who plays Raakhee and Shashi Kapoor's son in the movie) and Neetu Singh. The earlier romance just had such a sense of poignancy to it and seemed more real.

That being said, this is a beautiful movie - not just because the stars look great, but also because the cinematography is gorgeous, and the songs are memorable. Besides the title song, there are other tracks which are a treat to listen to, e.g. Main Pal Do Pal Ka Shayar Ho, etc. I would heartily recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good old-fashioned love story with melodious music.",1282521600,2,2169,5.688271604938271
3156382,5,B0016GOJVS,"A movie which was a great love story ( or should I say many love stories), entwined through a promise, an accord born to a sacrifice, woven through two generations, using guilt and pain of past, whose shadows came haunting in the present. Amitabh's character (Amit) and Waheeda (Anju) who lives metaphorically in a villa called Ateet becomes the battleground to reconcile the past with present, towards the second half and ending scenes. A reminder of  the forgotten promise of Amitabh to Rakhi ( ""Tum khush rahna ......aur main achcha Insaan banne ki koshish karoonga"") where he did not quite keep his part of the promise, when it came to his own wife's past.  It was a pleasant surprise, as to how beautifully these scenes were carried out and how much punch they were left with (in terms of storyline); considering when I watched the 1st 20-30 mins. or so of the movie up untill the casting and the third song when Rakhi gets married to Sashi Kapoor (to the surprise of the audience). I thought this is it. This 20 mins. is a complete story! An ultimate, beautiful short story ever told!

The first part of the story itself had all the twists and turns, it had very mature handling of whether to tow parents wishes or to rebel and go against theirs. I particularly liked the sub plot where Amit gives to Rakhi (Pooja); his first book (obviously titled Kabhi Kabhie) as her wedding present and parting gift; and Sashi Kapoor (Vijay) who is incidentally also a fan of Amit's poetry, gifts the very same book to Pooja on their wedding night; and asks her to sing from it.

Amitabh is standing, leaning on a tree outside the place where Rakhi is getting married to Sashi Kapoor and in a flashback he remembers their accord and decision to let Rakhi bend to her parents wishes. He also remembers himself gifting her the book and saying- ""Socha tha apni pahli kitab, pyaar ka tohfa samaz ke tumhein doonga; kya pata tha tumahre shaadi ka tohfa ban jayega""

This first part of the movie became the premise for the rest of the movie, which in itself was in no way inferior to the first part; completely connected and built upon this foundation.

Music and Lyrics

I am unable to decide what I should highlight as the best part from an outstanding-in-all-department movie, such as this. Whether I should talk about Amitabh's acting, who broke the then recent mould of Angry young man to act as a love stricken poet, or his smart Polo-necks or greying moustache; or should I talk about the beautiful picturization of Kashmir's snow laden mountains, trees and gardens; ...oh and the dal lake. Should I talk about Vijay (Sashi kapoor) who would have easily given the best performance of his lifetime in this movie; or about his character that can very well make a role model of a husband and a father. Or should I talk about Rakhi Gulzaar, for whom the movie was written, and for her it was the last film after marriage as a lead actress. Or, should I talk about the music and the lyrics of the film, as a starter. These two elements that made this great movie into an absolute cult classic.

I think the latter first! Khayyam and Sahir got their well deserved Filmfare* for this movie. Kabhi Kabhie, main pal do pal, mere ghar aayee and all other scores, immortalized the music and movie alike. Interestingly the songs composed for the newer generation (Vikki, Sweety and Nitu) were fast, catchy and hummable ....Dil aane ki baat hai jab jo lag jaye pyara.....""

The picture opens with Amitabh reciting these lines from Sahir ( You'll probably not find this in the Music Album)

""Kal nayi koplein phootengi, Kal naye phool muskayenge,
Aur naye ghaas ke naye pharsh pe, naye paaon ithlayenge.
Woh mere beech nahin aaye (2)
Main unke beech kyoun aaon,
Main unki subahon aur shaamon ka(2)
ek bhi lamha kyon paaon.
Main pal do pal ka shayar hoon,
Pal do pal meri kahani hai......""

Khayyam could not have composed such soul-stirring music without divine inspiration. I cannot be sure, but it is impossible that he would have created the music anywhere other than the Jannat that was Kashmir. Notice some of the flute playing and the title tunes as background scores during emotional scenes. During painful confrontations, and during the intervals of delivered questions and seemingly endless wait of a balanced reply. Same goes for Sahir, what he wrote for the movie was dipped in music. They were not only relevant and apt, but dare I say, the soul of the film itself.

8262477,5,B0016GOJVS,"I bought the movie because of the nature's scenes,  Amitabh's dialog, poetry delivery, and the song (kabhi kabhie).  It was well worth it.  I didn't like the rest of the movie except kabhi kabhie dialog in an interview, and Amitabh's dialog to Shashi Kapoor about badi himmat chahiye ...

The blu-ray also made lot of songs very scenic.  I moved to US in the 80s when everything was on VHS and copied by the store owners many times.  By the time we got the rented tape and watched it, it was hard to make out any faces.  I stopped watching many movies until the mid 90s when DVDs came out.  Everyone in college were fond of Kabhi Kabhie because of the songs.  It was fun watching it again.",1475884800,,689,4.3203125
