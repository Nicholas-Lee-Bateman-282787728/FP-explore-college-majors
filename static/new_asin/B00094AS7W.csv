2263288,4,B00094AS7W,"A series of 22 minutes first person narratives. A few episodes, in the 3rd disc are almost a full hour length. They are told sort of like confessions, being us the confessors, becuase they always face the camera and the director isn't present.

The variety of characters presented are as wide as you can think of. In some cases the characters themselves are more interesting/weird/uncanny than their own stories, and the format offers a privileged window into their psyches as they confidently speak to us. Other times it's the plain facts of their lives, the ineluctable fates, the improbable coincidences that strike us as being so uncanny. Many times it's a mix of both. Each and every viewer can pick what captivates his or her attention most.

If I had to find the nexus among these series I would say: They are all people who are obssessed with something, and that something becomes a sort of god. In some cases it may be a passion, but in others it has absorbed the meaning of life.

I found more common ground. There was very little altruism among these folks: everything was about them and they were the center of the universe, so to speak, take away one or two exceptions. I guess it's in the nature of every obssession that it should be so, whether it's a benign obssession or a sick/diabolical one.

A documentary that should make you think.",1184976000,4,1353,4.648535564853557
2263289,5,B00094AS7W,"I was not aware of the First Person series when it was broadcast on cable.  I stumbled across this collection as I started appreciating the unique style of Errol Morris' directing.  The stories are excellent and the music is perfectly written to compliment the quirkiness of each character.  This DVD set inspired me to purchase the 2 CDs of ""Music from Season One (and Season Two) of Errol Morris' First Person"" by John Kusiak.",1167955200,4,428,4.756756756756757
2263290,5,B00094AS7W,"To me, this series is the pinnacle of Morris' career. It combines the elements of his other works, but does so in a fashion that is chillingly effective. For instance, the whimsy of works like Vernon, Florida and Gates of Heaven is seen here, but often within the framing of larger, haunting elements, many times that reverberate even beyond the narrative frame: the internet guy who offers himself up as an attraction (thank you, PT Barnum), but sees himself as one of handful of the 20th C's great artists, the lawyer who goes from defending gangsters to rappers, congratulating himself for sensing the changing 'game.'

The best of these episodes can literally rival the greatest documentaries. The Rick Rossner episodes (2 half hour bits) about his time on the show 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire' are the best, followed closely by the two segments with Denny Fitch, the passenger/pilot how helped land the United flight in '86 that ended up in an Iowa cornfield.

This is a huge value, and these pieces bear many viewings. Truly amazing. Somehow, too, they bear the lightest authorial imprint, which from Morris, can sometimes have the imperious overtones of his friend Werner Herzog.",1155340800,3,1189,4.94
2263291,5,B00094AS7W,"Errol Morris' First Person is an unusual, yet effective, way to make over the the traditional interview. In the series, Morris finds people, truly everyday folks, with unusual perspectives on things and very interesting stories to tell. Out of the 17 interviews, I have my favorites, but there is definitely enough variation to appeal to every taste. Each person starts out with a completely 'normal' line of reasoning. However, you get to watch these people transform into characters that you usually only see actors portray. I have to say, the 'Killer In Me' segment, my favorite, is quite bazarre, but entertaining and unnerving at the same time. The fact that these people are not actors and their wierd stories are true is pretty fascinating. I was definitely not disappointed and I'm glad I've got the complete series in my video library.",1149552000,9,844,4.99290780141844
2263292,5,B00094AS7W,"Errol Morris continues to offer new ways to see important issues, be they murder, cryogenics, autism and animals or credit card debt.

The impression one gets when you watch this series is that you are right there and the subject of each story is talking directly to you.

Excellent!",1141776000,2,283,4.755102040816326
2263293,4,B00094AS7W,"I am drawn to things that are out of the ordinary, and I have found that Errol Morris captures the unusual in his films.  This DVD set has 17 episodes (each about 45 minutes long), where Mr. Morris interviews either very unusual people, or ordinary people with unusual jobs.  For example, in ""eyeball to eyeball"" the guy who has been researching giant squid for most of his career doesn't seem too unusual (until he says that it would be cool to be eaten by one).  The episode that I really like though is ""the killer in me.""  This is about a woman who sees herself as being fairly objective and rational (a book writer), but she's attracted to serial killers (falls in love with one in fact). This series is both thought provoking as to the question ""why do we do the things we do,"" but it also offers a mirror to the individuals who are interviewed.  This set is so unusual, I'm sure that I'm doing a poor job of describing it, but if you are interested in unusual topics (lawyer for the mob rationalizing why it's okay to defend criminals) to the guy with the 180 IQ who's obsessed with getting back on a TV game show, then you'll find this DVD set a must have.  I bought this on a lark (I had bought ""the thin blue line""), but I think that this set is great.",1126915200,17,1262,4.2594142259414225
2263294,4,B00094AS7W,"Why haven't you seen an Errol Morris film? One of the beautiful things about film is that it can inform and educate, as well as entertain. Many documentaries accomplish the first two, but Errol Morris consistently does all three. Morris is the man behind some of the best documentaries ever made. These are not the boring talking head documentaries your parents used to see. Morris uses a combination of interviews, archival footage, footage his team creates to illustrate points and clips from old television and movies to tell compelling, unusual, informative stories. Morris' films are all the more compelling and watch able because of the subject matter; he finds strange people and gets them to reveal their interesting lives. Morris' films have rejuvenated the documentary much like Ken Burns' films have rejuvenated PBS. Get out there and start renting them.

In 2000, Bravo began airing ""Errol Morris' First Person"", a series of shorter documentaries very much like his films, just shorter. The entire series was recently released on DVD and is definitely worth watching.

Morris invented a device called the ""Interrotron"", which I believe he used later in his film ""The Fog of War"", about Robert McNamara. Basically, the subject can only see Morris by looking into a small monitor which is situated in the camera, in turn, recording the subject as they speak. This means that the subject is always looking directly at the camera, and the viewer. It is a bit unsettling at first, but it also provides a bizarre voyeuristic slant to the stories. Morris moves the camera a little, canting the frame. Brief shots of Morris on the monitor are inserted, to establish his presence, but he isn't even in the same room. Occasionally, he interjects a question.

The three disc set features all 17 episodes of the series, most of which are half hour interviews with some truly strange, interesting and bizarre people. A couple of the later episodes are a full hour.

There are too many to list in detail, but a few of the more memorable are:

""Leaving The Earth"" features Denny Fitch, a Check Pilot for a large airline. A Check Pilot is the person who makes sure the regular pilots are up to snuff, know all of their instruments, learn of new developments and procedures and are still capable of flying huge jets with hundreds of passengers. One day, after leading a class in Denver, he had the choice of two planes for his trip back to Chicago. A Boeing 747 and a DC-10 Jet leaving 10 minutes later. For some reason, he took the later flight. During the flight, all of the plane's hydraulics broke down and an engine went out. Because this had never happened before, and no one believed it ever would, the pilots don't know what to do and struggle to keep the plane afloat. Denny offered to help the pilots. But he doesn't know what to do either. After some brainstorming, they come up with an idea. Denny helps the pilots as much as possible.

This episode is easily the most compelling because of the subject matter. Denny is a humble guy. He simply explains the situation and clearly notes all of the various problems he faced. As he tells the story and the situation becomes more and more dire, your attention will be riveted to the screen. The very fact that he is here, in front of the camera, to tell the story, should give you an indication of the outcome. But it doesn't reveal everything. And the last few minutes of his story are the most memorable and gut-wrenching.

One of the more `Errol Morris-like' subjects can be found in ""Eyeball to Eyeball"". This is the story of Clyde Roper, a Giant Squid hunter. Yes, you read it correctly. Clyde is obsessed with finding a Giant Squid and has devoted his life to the pursuit.

In ""Smiling In A Jar"", Morris lets Gretchen Worden, director of the Mutter Museum talk about her job and her museum's strange collection. The museum, started by Doctor Mutter, has collected samples of strange human conditions and displays them either in their preserved state or as a skeleton. The museum displays the skeleton of the first Siamese Twins to live in America, cojoined twins, many abnormalities preserved in jars and the like. Many of the subjects on display were approached when they were alive and they granted the museum their remains as a means of scientific education. She relates the story of how the tallest man ever recorded was approached by Mutter and many others. When he died, he was buried and concrete was poured over the casket to prevent grave robbers from stealing his skeleton.

""You're Soaking in It"" tells the story of Joan Dougherty, a woman who felt a calling to open a Crime Scene Cleaning service. She talks about many of the crime scenes she has visited and how they dealt with the various problems associated with finding bodies many days after they died.

""The Stalker"" is another example of how a person simply telling a story can really move you. In this case, Bill Kinsley relates the events of how he became the Postmaster of a large post office. He had dreams of becoming the Postmaster General and then one day, an employee by the name of Thomas McIlvane returned to the post office and began shooting many, many employees. Kinsley's management style came under scrutiny and he was partially blamed for the events. This is, I think, the first such event and certainly the most deadly, and would eventually become the fodder of many comedians. But Kinsley relates the events in a way that make them come to life.

In ""One in a Million Trillion"", the subject, Rick Rosner, a former contestant on ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"", tells the story of his childhood and his obsession with getting on the game show. What makes Rosner interesting is his strange life before appearing on the show. A man with a very high IQ, in his late teens and early twenties, he moved around on his own, doctored his high school records, and attended his Senior year, the entire year, of high school at more than one location because he felt he could do it better. Once he got on the show, he missed a question he deemed vague and explains why.

These interviews merely reinforce the power of storytelling. Each of the people sits in front of the camera and tells their story. In some cases, Morris interjects very little, allowing the story to unfold and the images to build in our mind. When the subject is a little less forthcoming, or to direct them a little, he asks more questions. Morris uses little additional material to fill out the stories. Again, some of the subjects need more, some less. The additional material is a blend of images shot specifically for the story, archival and news footage, and images from old movies and television.

""First Person"" is a unique, interesting and highly watch able series of interviews with unique, interesting and sometimes strange people. It is definitely worth a rental.",1126742400,53,6879,4.7368421052631575

Great to finally see all the episodes in this series.  Errol Morris is a God.

My only complaint is that the DVDs aren't 16x9 enhanced, despite the fact that the show is letterboxed all the way through.  So on a normal TV you won't see any difference. But on a widescreen TV, you'll get a letterboxed image within a 4x3 frame.  Those of you with HDTVs know what I'm talking about.

If you have a good HDTV or a DVD player with Zoom capability, it can be fixed by zooming in a notch.  A minor annoyance, though, considering these aren't available in any other form.  I don't have full ""theic identity"" so I'll take what I can get!",1123804800,7,635,4.225

8057128,5,B00094AS7W,"This is such a great collection of strange and unbelievable stories from random people, all interviewed in Errol Morris's unique way. I love this show!",1388275200,,151,5.08
8057129,5,B00094AS7W,"From 2000-2001, Errol Morris had a TV show on the Bravo network.  The interviews mirrored his documentary films in their uniqueness in style and the subjects he chose to interview.  Morris chooses special, interesting people who are also very average and relatable in some ways.  I did not see the series when if first came out and watched it only recently on DVD.  Some of his interviewees are now famous and others infamous but most are still the special, anonymous people they were when they were interviewed, maybe even more so.  Every documentary with Errol Morris is a work of art and this series is too.  Some of the notable interviews done here is Temple Grandin, the autistic biologist who devised chutes and tunnels for cattle to walk through before they are killed for meat.  She is an advocate for the treatment of animals and recognizes that people will continue to eat meat.  Another is Antonio Mendez, the CIA agent made famous by Argo.  He devised a plan to rescue Americans from Iran in 1979 before the Iranians found out about them hiding in the Canadian embassy.  How did he do it?  By having them pose as a Canadian film production crew, curious about Iran for a possible movie site.  They deliberately made the movie script so confusing and intelligible that no one would want to finish reading it!  I found interviews with two men with high IQs very interesting.  They both were underemployed and had difficulty relating to other people.  One constantly attempted to get on to the game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? but after being on the show twice and only winning 1000 dollars, he keeps trying to be on the show.  My favorite episode is one of a pilot who as a passenger had to devise a way to land a plane because the pilots couldn't do it themselves.  His story is touching, heartbreaking and ultimately uplifting.  I loved this show!",1360454400,2,1867,4.657492354740061
8057130,3,B00094AS7W,"I love stories about people and Errol Morris' First Person can be a lot of fun. My tendency is to burn through series-based television/cable shows, one right after another. In the case of First Person, I think my rating of the show reflects that in this case it may be too much of a good thing.

Certainly, Morris has a style, a real ""fingerprint"" if you will, that makes it his. In small doses - as a full length documentary or an episode or two of a series - I love it just as I do a Ken Burns historical piece. Still, many of these interviews are quirky and entertaining and may be best enjoyed as more of a condiment vs. a large, multi-course meal.",1340064000,2,652,4.216
8057131,5,B00094AS7W,"This is a great documentary series.  It's well shot, in typical Errol Morris style, with talking heads broken up by ""b-reel"" type footage that dramatizes their stories.  If you like documentaries, watch it!",1250640000,,206,5.212121212121212
8057132,4,B00094AS7W,"There were two and only two seasons of ""First Person,"" Erroll Morris' documentary series, and both are included on this three-DVD set. They make for frequently morbid but undeniably absorbing television.

Morris has an unusual style. Using his ""Interrotron,"" a camera with a mirror that allows subjects to look at the director and answer his questions naturally even as they face viewers squarely, he interviews quirky, articulate people, most of whom seem to have an intimate relationship with death. Interspersed among snippets of the interviews are documents, reenactments, and archival footage.

How death-obsessed is Morris? Well, his most famous feature documentaries have included ""Gates of Heaven,"" about pet cemeteries; ""The Thin Blue Line,"" about a police murder; and ""The Fog of War,"" about Robert McNamara, architect of the Vietnam War, for which Morris won an Academy Award. This series is just as fixated on the Grim Reaper. It includes just over eight hours worth of episodes: 15 that originally ran half an hour and two that lasted an hour. There ain't no more!

* ""Mr. Debt,"" a lawyer who sues credit card companies
* ""Eyeball to Eyeball,"" a zoologist who searches for giant squid and tells us what it would be like to be eaten by one
* ""Stairway to Heaven,"" the autistic animal researcher Temple Grandin, who designs slaughterhouses
* ""The Killer Inside Me,"" a woman who tends to fall in love with serial killers
* ""I Dismember Mama,"" the owner of a cryogenic center who froze his mother's head after she died
* ""The Stalker,"" a postal worker who was shot in a spree killing and still fears for his life
* ""The Parrot,"" a bird who witnessed a mysterious murder
* ""Smiling in a Jar,"" the director of a museum of skeletons and medical freaks preserved in formaldehyde
* ""In the Kingdom of the Unabomber,"" a psychologist who became killer Ted Kaczynski's pen-pal
* ""The Little Gray Man,"" a man who was an undercover CIA agent during the Cold War
* ""You're Soaking in It,"" a woman who cleans up scenes of murder and suicide
* ""Mr. Personality,"" a forensic psychiatrist and expert on the personalities of depraved killers
* ""The Only Truth,"" a lawyer who helps murderers and mobsters get away with it
* ""Harvesting Me,"" an entrepreneur who broadcasts his life on the Internet
* ""One in a Million Trillion,"" a perennial high school student, nude model, and game show contestant (one hour)
* ""Leaving the Earth,"" the airline pilot who helped save 185 lives in a crash that killed 111 (one hour)
* ""The Smartest Man in the World,"" a bar bouncer and self-proclaimed genius

By my count, that's at least 12 out of 17 shows that have a connection to death. Tell me this man is not at least as obsessed as the obsessive people he interviews. If you like true confessions and the truly odd, you'll find plenty to enjoy in this set. In the words of the Don Henley song, ""It's interesting when people die / Give us dirty laundry!""",1237939200,7,2933,4.756385068762279
