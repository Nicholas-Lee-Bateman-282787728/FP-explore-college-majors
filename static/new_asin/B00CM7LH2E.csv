8583263,5,B00CM7LH2E,"This is a great documentary about a great American, focusing on the time that he spent in Ireland during the Potato Famine. Interviews with historians in both Ireland and the United States are enhanced by interviews with Douglass' descendants to round out a portrait of the abolitionist and vice presidential candidate.",1481500800,,319,5.2745098039215685
8583264,5,B00CM7LH2E,"Like many people, I was vaguely familiar with Frederick Douglass. I knew he was an escaped slave that became an influential abolitionist, I was invited to a lecture where I got a good overview of his life. In reading his fIrst autobiography, I came to appreciate how brilliant he was. This documentary shows that Douglass was a giant, not only of ""Black History"", but of American and Irish history as well. I'm looking forward to reading and learning more about this great man.",1373500800,,477,4.759036144578313
8583265,5,B00CM7LH2E,"""While so much has been written about Frederick Douglass, this film is a refreshingly original look at a largely unknown part of his life - his extraordinary experience in Ireland. Aside from revealing a piece of history long obscured, the film gives us a fascinating glimpse into the relations between Irish and African-Americans. This will be a wonderful educational tool for students of all ages."" Howard Zinn (2009)",1367539200,3,419,5.176470588235294
