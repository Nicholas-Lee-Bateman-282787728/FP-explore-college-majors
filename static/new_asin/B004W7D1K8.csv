8444638,3,B004W7D1K8,"This instructional DVD is a bit lacking.  On many of the songs the instructor shows you how to play the songs on a guitar with NO FRET MARKERS.  That's just a boneheaded move on a DVD that's supposed to be showing you which frets to put your fingers on.  Also, there's next to no explanation of important topics like which key the song you're learning is supposed to be in, if the solo is in a different key, etc.  If you do A LOT of backing up and replaying you can get it, but all that effort would have been unnecessary with 5 more seconds of thought on the part of the instructor or production crew.",1440201600,3,603,4.172413793103448
