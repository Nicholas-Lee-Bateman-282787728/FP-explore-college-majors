8614299,5,B00FC4AWGG,"I saw the Americanized version of Cest Do Pravenky several times when I was a kid in the late 60's and early 70's.  It was an important piece of my childhood in terms of a film which influenced my later tastes.  I did not know until recently of the original Czech version. As usual, seeing a film in its original form and language is much more satisfying.  This film is fascinating in terms of the characters, the subject matter, and the effects which are at once both primitive and magnificent. I highly recommend Cesta Do Pravenku to anyone who appreciates foreign films, (although this is certainly not a prerequisite for enjoyment), classic older films, science, science fiction with heart, and particularly films about the magic of youth on the verge of adulthood.",1441497600,,769,4.8106060606060606
8614300,5,B00FC4AWGG,"""Journey to the Beginning of Time"" is the English title of this Czech film, which retains its original language audio track but has subtitles.  This is a video enhanced version of a 1955 film that was an instructional filming any eastern European countries.  Karel Zeman produced  this charming tale of a group of schoolboys who take an imaginative journey through time, dealing with woolly mammoths, sabre toothcats, dinosaurs,  other early life.
The video quality is excellent.
A note;  you will need to have a ""region-free"" DVD  player to play this video on your standard American TV set ... but it is worth it.  And guess what?
You can get one of those here on Amazon.com!",1440115200,2,676,4.826086956521739
8614301,5,B00FC4AWGG,"In our current era of hyper-real CGI  dino documentaries that are SO realistic that you almost feel like they have been able to send cameras back through time to photograph the great beasts of antiquity, this pioneering prehistoric effort by Czech fantasy film maker Karel Zeman may seem somewhat prosaic, but it is definitely worth a look.

Zeman might be likened to a blend of George Melies and stop motion master Willis O'Brien - altho he worked in a more modern period than those two early masters of cinema illusion.  Zeman utilized an amazing array of 'practical' special effects to achieve his fantastical visions, including: 2D and 3D animation, forced perspective tricks, and matte paintings.  The result imparts a uniquely 'artistic' quality to his films that transcends the passage of time, and more modern sophisticated SPFX innovations, allowing them to still be enjoyed as works of true cinematic 'art'.

""Journey To The Beginning of Time"" was originally conceived as a 'educational' film of sorts to present 'up to date factual depictions of prehistoric life' for young children.  Of course - since this film was first released in the 1960's much has altered in our knowledge of dinosaurs so the 'facts' are not quite as accurate as once believed - but Zeman's vision still retains much of its''appeal - it WAS pretty sophisticated for the time of its' original release!

The simple story-line follows a group of boys who are out on a river in a rowboat and they are sucked into a cavern.  When they emerge on the other side they find that they have been 'magically' transported back in time to the earth's Ice Age and they view Mammoths & other creatures of that period along the shore.  As the boat flows down the river it moves ever further back in time - passing through all the well known dinosaurian epochs - until they reach the time of the ancient pre-Cambrian seas and the very beginnings of life on our planet.  Along the way there are various 'adventures' as the boys 'go ashore' to explore  the ancient lands they are moving through. There is a particularly rich and divergent display of prehistoric beasts portrayed!

This film has much of the feeling of Willis O'Brien's original ""Lost World"" & ""King Kong' and/or the dinosaur segment from the film ""The Animal World"" that Ray Harryhausen animated, early in his career.  It is a little 'rough' by today's effects standards but possesses a timeless charm.  The film is in color and is one of the new 'archival quality' releases of Zeman's works being authored by the Karel Zeman Museum in his Czech homeland.  The visual quality is outstanding!  Highly recommended for fans of stop motion animation, dinosaurs, and fantasy films in general...

Potential purchasers should note that this is a Euro - Region 2 PAL formatted disk and requires a 'region-free' DVD player to access.",1386374400,10,2855,4.877846790890269
8614302,5,B00FC4AWGG,"This film's aged colors will never look ""as though they were filmed yesterday.""  However, this is the best version of this film I've seen on home video.  The print here looks a bit darker than the Japanese video release of several years ago.  Given that this DVD is a product of the Karel Zeman museum, my guess is that the color scheme here is closer to director's Zeman's intentions.

The film played 1960's kiddie matinees in the US, with added footage that slowed down the opening scenes.  This PAL disc restores the original Czech version.

Four boys paddle a canoe down a river and thusly journey through the prehistoric ages of mankind, complete with many stop-motion dinosaurs.  The creatures aren't menacing in the mode of Ray Harryhausen, but are majestic enough to capture the viewer's imagination.  Director Zeman employs his trademark mixture of stop motion, animation, and other media to paint a portrait of the dinosaurs who roamed the earth.

The PAL DVD, which requires an international disc player, contains some supplemental features as well.  There is actually a three and a half minute interview with the man who played the blonde boy in the film.  He looks back with great pleasure at having acted in the film as a youth.  Both the film and the verbal supplements have an option for English subtitles, which is desirable even though Zeman's films are primarily visual.",1379548800,2,1390,4.8931623931623935
