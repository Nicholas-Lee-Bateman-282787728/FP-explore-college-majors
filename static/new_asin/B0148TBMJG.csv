7385507,5,B0148TBMJG,"I flew from Rio de Janeiro/Brazil to Hollywood in 2012 to see the spectacular Cinerama Festival, and ""Holiday in Spain"" was projected on all splendour of the super-widescreen. The blu-ray smile-box is a beauty souvenir extravaganzza and the soundtrack is exotic!",1448323200,3,262,5.414634146341464
8730052,5,B0148TBMJG,"Let's get a few things straight: Discount any review that says they saw the original Scent of Mystery and then says it's great to see it again but it's only so-so now.  Anyone who saw Scent of Mystery during its oh so short run knows that Holiday in Spain is a cut-down (by over twenty minutes) version, with terrible narration added and the brilliant original intermission point moved to an earlier and much less effective spot.  So when people say the film is so-so they are only talking about this hybrid thing called Holiday in Spain.  Scent of Mystery was not a Cinerama production - it was shot in Todd-70 and later it was sold to Cinerama and they did their adaptation and turned the 65mm image into three panels.  One only wishes that the original Scent of Mystery could have been saved, but alas that was not in the cards.

The stuff from the negative here looks pretty good, the stuff from the 70mm prints doesn't look as good.  But Dave Strohmaier worked long and hard on this and the effort is appreciated.  Extras are fun.",1523145600,,1035,4.502673796791444

8730054,3,B0148TBMJG,"I was interested in this more for it's historical significance than the actual content.  I never got a chance to see (and smell) The Scent of Mystery when it played in Chicago, although I had a friend who did.  I've always been curious about it and was pleased to see that it was released in the Smilebox format.  I was also curious about its release in the three  projector Cinerama/CineMiracle format since it was shot in Todd-AO which was developed by the director's father Mike Todd. This release and the associated documentary material answered some of those questions.",1501804800,,574,4.826530612244898
8730055,5,B0148TBMJG,"As a movie, it's so-so at best.  As a restored piece of Hollywood history, it's magnificent.  Always good to see Paul Lukas and Peter Lorre, even when the material is lacking somewhat.  As usual, David Strohmaier and his guys did an incredible job on the restoration.  Like others, I kinda think they should lose the Smilebox concept, but if they don't, it doesn't really detract much from the presentation, at least not on the ten foot wide screen I saw it on.",1495843200,,461,4.585365853658536

8730057,5,B0148TBMJG,"Great Restoration, good color correction, and an excellent sound track which moves across the screen following the action. I only wish they had included a non ""Smilebox"" version of the film as well, so we had a choice.  You lose a lot of the picture with the ""Smilebox"" when you project it onto a large screen.  Having seen genuine Cinerama in the theater years ago the ""Smilebox"" doesn't quite give the true feeling of the big screen, because you are looking at the picture in front of you rather than being surrounded by the picture in the theater.  The sound ,",1478044800,2,563,4.554455445544554

8730059,3,B0148TBMJG,"I bought this for nostalgia, as I saw the ""Smellovision"" version with full aroma effects when it first came out. The movie itself is so-so (why I gave it only three stars), but the extras are worthwhile for giving the history of the process and the making of the film. If you saw this originally, the nostalgia might be worth 5 stars for you.",1468540800,,342,4.359375
