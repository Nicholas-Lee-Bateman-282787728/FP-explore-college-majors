COMMENTS:

It is story of Oakie and Cook, two rival Bowery showmen who eventually take their vaudeville-bred talents to 42nd Street.

Although theft of ideas has separated them in the past, the two eventually collaborate on a show that turns out to be a tremendous success. When Cook breaks up the newly formed partnership to produce serious dramatic works for the gorgeous Montez, Oakie again turns sour on their relationship.

After years of silence, the two reconcile during a revival of one of their classic productions. Essentially a vehicle to showcase the talents of Universal's singers and dancers of the 1940s, as the Soprans Ann Blyth and Susana Foster.

The Dominican actress stars as a famous European singer who come to the U.S.A. for featuring in Broadwa. The song MONTEVIDEO was one of the greatest performance of Marina in this movie.

This role did not help much the career of Maria, but it proved the fact she could look fantastic in any kind of clothes.",1414886400,,1355,5.022421524663677
