1172736,5,9089709851,"Soothing and so realistic, I actually feel warmer while viewing :-)  Used as a meditation and relaxation tool, we have a gas burning fireplace in our new home and I really missed the sight and sounds of our old wood burning one. This is a nice imitation, without the soot, ashes and messy cleanup.",1415491200,6,297,4.5
1172737,5,9089709851,"The sound of the fire - the sparks and crackles - the flickers of light out into the room...all of it is so lifelike.  I have this on in my bedroom a lot - something about listening to the wind howling outside and a ""fire"" going on inside.  A previous poster is right about the meditative qualities.  Just like sitting in front of a real fireplace and getting lost in thought as you watch it burn, this DVD has the same impact.",1414281600,7,427,4.182926829268292

1172743,5,9089709851,"If only these were available when I was a bachelor! This is a very romantic DVD, with a choice of two fires (one larger, one small) that burn down to the embers. You have a choice of listening to a wonderful score of romantic jazz, or, if you like, to nothing but the natural sounds of the fireplace. This DVD would be excellent background for an intimate setting. But it doesnt have to be just background: theres something fascinating about watching a fire burn down to glowing embers even if you're alone. Your thoughts seem to follow the action. What I mean is, watching a fire burn down for an extended period of time (over 40 minutes on the first selection) can a meditative experience, at the end of which you feel calm. Ive watched this DVD both wayswith the sexy jazz score, and with only the sounds of the crackling fire---and each has its merits. The music, as I say, is romantic and relaxing, and would be nice to have around on a date. But the unadorned sounds of the wood crackling is also very relaxing. So, if you're wondering why someone would want to sit in front of the screen and watch a fire burn itself out for over an hour---either listening to a romantic score, or simply the sounds of wood crackling---its because by the end of the DVD you feel as if something in your mind has been resolved. Once again, the patient production values of the Ambient Collection have cast their spell on a too-busy world.",1402358400,32,1427,4.471264367816092
1172744,5,9089709851,Having bought many fireplace DVD's over the years we were always annoyed at how short each film was...this is definitely a boon here with fantastic full length fires and you can just let the DVD play during a party or an evening without worrying about it! Absolutely recommended and if you have never bought a fireplace dvd before get this one you won't regret it!,1397520000,22,364,4.615384615384615
1172757,5,9089709851,"It s great.  I moved a basement flat screen up, and put it into the fireplace with our screen in front of it.  It looks very very real. Almost scary.  It is professionally done.  I think it has four different fires. You can have soft music, fire sounds or both.  We use the fire sounds. My wife wants me to keep a bucket of water nearby just in case.  She is silly.",1485129600,,365,4.0

1172759,5,9089709851,Beautiful. I like that there are a couple of slow fires and fast fires. I have a choice of whether to listen to music or not. Nice crackling sounds and I swear my body warms up just having it on.,1483401600,,195,3.9
1172760,3,9089709851,"The first DVD is good, back far enough you can see and hear the wood popping sounds also can see the grate making it seem like a real fire, I also like the bird chirps in the background. The 2nd DVD appears to have been filmed by someone else, it's too close to the fire, can't see the top flames, hear the popping sounds but also hear the roar echo of inside the fireplace by the microphone being too close. The second DVD also has a lower quality film, picture seems light and not so real.
I've had the DVD 24 hours, will give it a couple more tries before possibly returning for a better quality one.",1483056000,2,603,4.162393162393163

1172764,5,9089709851,"After doing some research and reading reviews I finally settled on this DVD set and am very glad I did. There are two DVDs both with a continual fire burning down. You do not see the fireplace or mantle, just the wood and flames. You can choose to listen to just the logs crackling or have additional music in the background. The background music is light classical style. The first night we got it my inlaws were visiting and I put on the DVD to try it out, we sat ""around the fire"" for a couple hours chatting and watching the flames. I was surprised at how calming and peaceful it was. The next day my one year old was fussy so I put it on and he instantly calmed down and watched the fire burn for a few minutes. I have it on right now again while writing this review and I'm just so content. I can't recommend it enough. (As a side note, my inlaws now plan to buy the DVD for themselves)",1474502400,,892,4.102857142857143
1172765,5,9089709851,"What a day!  Its the middle of winter, the leaves on the trees are long gone, the sky is overcast and threatening snow, and there is a brisk, chilly wind to top it off!  OK, Im ready to hibernate with a nice fire, my dogs, a book, and a cup of hot chocolate, coffee, tea, or whatever.  Theres only one problem  no fireplace!  Well, be assured, now you can have a ready-made fireplace with no fuss or mess.  Forget chopping logs and getting kindling ready, just slip one of these DVDs into your player and be prepared to relax.

This lovely set contains two DVDs filmed in 4K.  You have a choice of listening to natural, crackling fire sounds or soothing piano music (Disc 2 has a choice of classical music, as well as the natural sounds).  Each fire plays through until only embers remain.  There are four fireplace scenes available, two on each DVD.  The scenes can be played separately or looped for continuous viewing.

The DVDs played beautifully on my HDTV.  The flames are so sharp and bright that it is easy to believe there is a cozy fire warming up your space.  The peaceful sounds of the fire crackling in the background were mesmerizing.  What a perfect backdrop for a winter day!",1465257600,,1191,4.474418604651163

1172781,5,9089709851,"These are some of the best fireplace videos I've seen.  There are 4 videos, each between 30 and 45 minutes long.  They are nicely centered, don't cut off the flames and the sound is excellent.  I very much enjoy the fact that each fire progresses from roaring blaze to a dying fire.  Also, each automatically loops back to the beginning, so you essentially have an unending fire.  A winter evening, a cup of cocoa, a good book and a roaring fire.  What could be better?",1455580800,,469,4.458823529411765
1172782,3,9089709851,"Great Video.  Works with my 4K screen.  Wish I had more options in the type of fire presented.  Only ROARING fires that burn down.

1172784,5,9089709851,"This is a very realistic video with crackling sounds.  The video loop is long, so your experience is of watching a real fire burn over a long period of time.",1452038400,,157,4.233333333333333

1172786,5,9089709851,"The fires on this DVD are very relaxing to look at. Each of these fires looks different and are shown from a different perspective. Some fires are shown from very close, some a little further away. I like this variety on this DVD. I use the DVD in order to create a cozy atmosphere in the evening. The natural fire sounds make this more realistic. It's also nice that you still have the possibility to choose from piano music as added background noise. So you can always vary the mood. A great DVD.",1451174400,,498,4.365591397849462
1172791,5,9089709851,The Fireplace DVD for picky people!  I searched through a lot before settling on this one.  Love the loop feature.,1450224000,,114,4.65

1172793,5,9089709851,"We are very happy with this one! The video quality is MUCH better than expected - dare I say perfect! This purchase was intended to upgrade an older fireplace DVD. I had intended to buy a Blu-ray but nervously settled for a DVD after not finding what I wanted in BD format. My requirements were simple; realistic, super clear picture and looping. In this two disc set, there is a total of two different fires. One DVD disc is of a split log fire and the other disc is of a round log fire - we have no preferences as they're both great and filmed/treated in the same style. Each disc has one 60 minute fire - you have the choice of viewing in a 60 min. standard(normal) view OR a 60 min. zoomed in view of the same fire. These are classic looking indoor fires, that fill the TV screen perfectly and are realistic and believable. These DO NOT look like fake natural gas aided fires. The fire DOES fit your modern TV screen perfectly. (If you want silly looking fires w/ pebbles or Christmas stockings or ultra modern hearths or a zillion useless options, look elsewhere.) And the picture is CRYSTAL CLEAR, even on our 82 inch TV!  Originally, we really wanted a BD to help insure that perfect clarity but I can't imagine a better picture than what we now have with this new set. Each fire loops continuously so each 60 minute fire could(will) play automatically for hours if you wish. Soundwise, there are two options: perfect natural fire sounds(crackling) OR depressing piano music that's sort of Claire de Lune'ish...Note: Apparently, there is also a play-all menu option to watch the 60 min. standard view automatically followed by the 60 min. zoomed in view - not sure if this also continuously loops or is just a way to watch 120 min. total, but we didn't care for that option - the transition of going from normal view to close-up is weird...

Btw, Netflix has a decent FREE long fireplace video(s) available to stream that has a much better picture than our original fireplace DVD. These have natural sound OR a Christmas music option. But it doesn't compare to our new Fireplace XXL set. I'm guessing that this perfect picture quality is hard to fit on just one disc, hence the two discs. And don't let the fact that this set really only contains two different fires, stop you from buying this. You get what you pay for and this will be the only fireplace DVD you'll ever want. Very happy.

UPDATE: Netflix recently added two additional hour long fireplaces videos that are ""4K"" w/ natural sound! They are very very good and look awfully similar to these Fireplace XXL 4K DVDs...Hmm... I'll have to watch again but might these be one in the same? My advice, unless this is intended to be a gift, I would recommend trying the free ones 1st on Netflix, the only downside I see is not having the looping option or just knowing you'll always have that fire video when you want it. I say that because anyone familiar w/ Netflix streaming, knows Netflix doesn't keep titles very long in their streaming ""library"" BUT I will say that they have managed to keep some fire videos for a few years in a row now...",1450051200,7,3108,4.516873889875666
1172794,5,9089709851,"This little digital fireplace DVD is the best thing weve purchased in many, many months.  Yes, there are some available for streaming, but we like that we can just flick on DVD without using any bandwidth and enjoy an instant fire. The images are beautiful and realistic. The best feature is that you can set it to hear soft, calming piano music, or you can shut off the music and enjoy the sounds of just the crackling fire. Yes, it is not a real fire (weve had many of those over the years), but being able to just turn it on and later off with the flick of a button and no ash to clean is worth it, and yet it still lends ambiance during a quiet evening at home.

The only criticism I can add is that my spouse wishes it had more variety in the piano pieces, but I don't have any problem with it as it is.

We did not expect to be using it so frequently, but given the state of this crazy world, it is nice just to take a break to enjoy simple quietude in a semi-dark room and re-center and reflect.  Highly recommended!",1449878400,2,1023,4.1

It's filmed SO clearly that I find it hard to look away. In my opinion, it's the best one World Nature Video company has come up with so far!!  When the description said  ""BIGGER, BRIGHTER, LONGER, TRY OUR XXL FOR SIZE!"" - they weren't kidding or exaggerating at all. It's such a peaceful set of fires, I enjoyed it immensely. The fires took up my whole screen which is great and I love that you can choose to have music playing or simply listen to the sound of the fire only (which is my preference). I'll be watching this one often, I'm sure. Great Job!

Gives the lovely ambience of a fireplace.  I like to burn a fireplace or pine scented candle to really add to the relaxing experience.  I own several fireplace dvds and this is one of the finest.

 I have found that World Nature Videos/Tony Helsloot products are some of the finest for relaxation and meditation.  I like that the fireplace videos can be played with classical music or the natural crackling sounds of a fireplace.  Quality sound, very realistic fire sounds and beautiful orchestra and piano music.",1431129600,,678,5.027027027027027
1172812,5,9089709851,"This title is two discs containing four separate fire files, Yule Log and Yule Log XL, and Cabin Fire and Fire XXL.  You can choose from nice classical music, natural fire crackling sounds, or a mixture of both.
There is definitely a different feeling providing by extended length of the fire, as you get about 45 minutes from start to finish, and no stoking needed!  Even the embers are mesmerizing.

The fire size takes up your whole screen, and seems to be about one and a half to two times the size of a regular fireplace fire.  You don't see any boundaries, just dark beyond the fire.  This set would be ideal for a darkened room with a wall mounted TV, and can set the mood for relaxation or romance.

I am not a high def TV person, so can only imagine how this would be visually stunning in higher definition than my TV, which has good video quality but is just 40 inches.  This would be a selection I would choose first from my collection if I had a bigger screen, but is enjoyable for any size setting.
The music is nice, with my favorite on the Cabin Fire scene.  Classical piano music is the musical option for the entire set, but this selection is nice.  The only real distinction between the fires is the way the wood or logs are set up.  I like the rounded stacked logs of the Yule Fire, but the Cabin fire is again a favorite, set in a loose wood, free  setting that means the dancing flames take center stage.

I am considered an official reviewer for Isis Visuals nature dvds, and I was provided a copy of this title for a review.  This carries a potential for bias so must be disclosed, but please know that I purchased more than 20 discs from Isis Visuals before taking this role, and provided recommendations for this discs then without any incentive except the appreciation I had for their provision of setting the stage for my relaxation.  All productions have demonstrated good quality videography of places similar to where weve seen before, and some we can only dream of seeing in person.  The scene changes are natural and never jerky.  Whatever your relaxation mood is, Isis will have something to help cultivate it at your whim.",1430611200,,2156,4.475703324808184

You can choose between different fireplaces or run them one after the other. The background noises are freely selectable. I liked the fire sound best, as they appear really natural, so that I feel as I have a real fireplace in my home. If the logs burn the crackling appears really authentic.

We were not using our existing fireplace, so moved the flatscreen from the guest bedroom, and set it in front of the void. The TV that we watch, is on the mantle above. So now we have a very realistic fire flames, as part of our entertainment in the evenings. To cap off the evening, we watch a music Dvd, for an hour or so before going to bed. We sleep like babies. Well actually better than a baby. I highly recommend this fireplace XXL. If I may add a plug for music DVD's, we never tire of watching and listening to any of Andre' Rieu.

1172854,4,9089709851,"Based on some of the reviews here I bought the XXL DVD. Wow! Living in the Southwest and Maui in a home & condo without a fireplace....but with this DVD, who needs one? Each Fire on this 2 DVD set is different with different sounds as well.  Personally #1 and #4 are my favorites.

However, if you look closely at Fire #2 on Disc 1, the menu title says it is Fireplace XL and appears taken right from the older XL DVD. You can tell as it is much more grainy and pixelated if you look close up than the 3 others.

Also, the sound on Fire #1 on the second disc sounds like a gas fed whooshing sound. Awful. I ripped it to my PC, demuxed it and muxed the sound track on it from Fire #2. Ah, much better!

That aside, XXL is really realistic, looks beautiful and highly recommended!",1419897600,,778,4.098684210526316

1172857,5,9089709851,"When my wife and I lived in the Midwest, we used the real fireplace in our home almost every day and night from November through March.  I loved to sit in our family room with the lights dimmed, late at night after my wife had gone to bed, watching the colors of the dancing flames and listening to the popping and crackling sounds of the firewood as it burned behind the fireplace screen.  Nothing was more relaxing.  Then my work caused us to move to the deep South, where fireplaces are most often purely decorative, especially in the beautiful, old, stately, antebellum homes that are plentiful there.  A number of our homes there had multiple fireplaces, but none of them were working fireplaces, and even if they had worked, you might only light a fire 5 to 10 times a year, because the temperature is so much warmer in the deep South.  When I started to see ""burning fireplace"" DVDs being sold, I decided to try one to see if I could find my ""long-lost friend and late-night confidant and problem-solver"".  I purchased a number of ""fireplace DVDs"", but none of them brought me the satisfaction I had enjoyed with my Midwest fireplace.

Then I saw ""Fireplace XXL"", The Ambient Collection, on Amazon.com.  It's product description and customer reviews sounded like it corrected the problems I had experienced with the other ""fireplace DVDs"" I had purchased previously.  So I ordered ""Fireplace XXL"" from Amazon.com.  It arrived very quickly (thank you Amazon Prime), the day before my wife and I were having a Christmas open house for her co-workers.  Normally I would have put five music CDs in our player, hit the ""play"" button and turned my A/V system's amp down to provide background music for the party.  This time, I loaded the ""Fireplace XXL"" DVD in the player, hit the ""play"" button and selected ""fireplace sounds and music"" on the DVD menu and adjusted the sound on my TV speakers.  As our guests arrived and gathered in our family room,  they all were drawn to the fire in the fireplace on my TV screen.  As more guests arrived, more and more people gathered around our ""fireplace"".  They all said it looked so realistic and had all of the positive aspects of a fireplace without the unwanted extra heat.  One guest said to me as she was leaving, ""I know your fireplace isn't real and is just a movie on your TV.  But I held my hand in front of the screen, and felt a feeling of warmth coming from the fireplace.  It was so nice.""  I gave her the name of the DVD, ""Fireplace XXL"" and said she can order it on Amazon.com.  I didn't tell her that the warmth she felt was from the TV screen and would have been there even if a program about Antarctica's harsh weather had been playing.

Later that night, after all the guests had gone and the clean-up was done, I finally had a chance to watch ""Fireplace XXL"" myself, and I have to say, I was blown away by ""Fireplace XXL's"" realism.  The High Definition camera beautifully captures all of the sights and sounds of the fire in the fireplace, from its gentle start-up, through its growth to a roaring inferno, and finally to its peaceful conclusion.  You get the popping and cracking sounds and the ""shooting star"" embers that accompany the popping sounds.  The tops of most of the flames, other than when the fire is at its roaring, maximum size, are visible, not cropped off because the camera is too close to the fire or the video shot at the wrong angle.  Having two DVDs, with a total of four fireplace scenes, with each scene having it's own music that goes very well with it's fireplace scene, allows you to match your preferred fireplace scene, with or without it's background music track, to your mood or your situation.  Combining the features and flexibility of ""Fireplace XXL"" with most flat-screen TV's ability to change the picture size and picture mode, ""Fireplace XXL"" can almost make you forget it is a DVD on your TV, not a real fireplace.  I'm going to try burning a stick of a woody/smokey-scented incense and putting a small ceramic heater near my recliner the next time I watch ""Fireplace XXL"", to add my olfactory and tactile senses to my auditory and optic senses currently being stimulated, and see if I can finally have ""a real wood-burning fireplace"", without having to clean and carry out a coal bucket full of ashes after the fire has burned itself out.  ""Fireplace XXL"" is absolutely THE  BEST, the most realistic, fireplace DVD in the market today.",1419638400,23,4440,4.611959287531807

1172859,4,9089709851,"The original Fireplace XL version has a greater variety of fires but some minor aesthetic and technical issues (too tightly cropped and an occasionally glitchy soundtrack).  This newer Fireplace XXL version has improved (wider) angles on the fires (most of the logs and the fire show) and longer running times but offers less variety (four fires that all look somewhat similar).  If you want a basic fire that looks and sounds the very best or runs the longest, or want to save $5 (at the time of this review) get this XXL version.  If you want a little more variety (pine cones with some of the fires, a ""cabin fire"" with night insect sounds, a soft focus effect fire) and don't mind slightly lower quality get Fireplace XL.  Both are pretty well done and the best of several fireplace DVD's I've tried. [Edit 30 Dec 14] Another review mentions the fires in XXL being pretty dark and I have noticed this is true--if you want to see a bit of the back of the firebox, go for XL.",1419465600,,977,4.47191011235955
