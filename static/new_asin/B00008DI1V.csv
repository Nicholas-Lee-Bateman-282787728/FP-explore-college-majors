My biggest wish is to get this on DVD!!!!",1199318400,8,190,4.25
1840881,5,B00008DI1V,"Love Bites is by far one of Adam Ant's best acting roles.  Why he didn't get better parts, in the 16 movies he has had roles in, is beyond all knowledge!  This is also a great movie to re-live the early 90's (as if you would really want to do that *rolls eyes*).  The clothes alone will make you cringe!  I think that is the real horror aspect of it.  Although this movie is very hard to find, it is well worth the search",1196208000,4,421,3.9642857142857144
1840882,5,B00008DI1V,"I love this movie, it is insane!!! It has everything, comedy, love, horror, adventure. Adam Ant is great, totally hilarious!!! I think that everyone should see it!",1181347200,4,163,5.074074074074074
7982132,5,B00008DI1V,"I didn't realize I'd seen this before until Judy Tenuta appeared.  I had no idea who Adam Ant was at the time, and at the time I can clearly recall thinking to myself that Judy Tenuta was the best part of the movie.  It's all different when you leave your cave and learn about the Adam Ant history and mythology--which of course wasn't available at the time even for people who knew he was behind Goody Two Shoes (I did not, let alone that he was a British sensation with certain....tendencies.)  Suddenly the movie makes sense, and becomes quite the parody full of inside jokes.  Roger Rose is still an unbearable actor and probably sunk the movie all on his own from a strictly box office stand point. But for an Adam Ant fan, this movie is pure gold.  Strike that.  Platinum.",1521244800,,778,4.443661971830986
7982133,5,B00008DI1V,Awesomely cheezy 80's comedy featuring Adam Ant as a vampire....what else do you need to know? Buy it!,1470096000,,102,4.722222222222222
7982134,5,B00008DI1V,I have been searching for this movie since I was about 10 years old (I begged my mom to find it) my hunt is still on at 22. I want to own this movie so bad. Why isn't this movie available on DVD or at all for that matter! Great movie!,1452988800,2,234,3.607843137254902

7982136,5,B00008DI1V,"I Love Adam Ant & this movie, but  unfortunately I haven't been able to find a decent copy anywhere!!! The last time I saw this movie was when it came out in the 90's :(  I don't even own the VHS....I hope someone will release this on DVD! AM4SP!!!!",1367798400,,249,4.061224489795919

7982138,5,B00008DI1V,"I wasn't born when this movie came out and only recently found out about the movie and watched it. I thought it was amazing. I have heard people say it was cheesy but i thought it was perfect. Adam was so charming and great in this movie and i just loved it. I have managed to watch it a few more times since i saw it for the first time, but i would LOVE to have this movie on DVD so that i could watch it when i wanted. I just thought it was so great and despite what people say i thought it was amazing and well worth the hard work i put in to find it and watch it. I didn't expect much and only watched it for Adam but ended up falling in love with the story itself. I also think it is not age limited. I'm only young and i still found it to be an amazing watch and would highly recommend it to anyone of any age. I'm definitely going on a hunt for the DVD !!",1346371200,3,862,3.741758241758242
7982139,5,B00008DI1V,I absolutely LOVE this movie. It is one of the best vampire comedies I have ever seen and Adam Ant is awesome in it. I can't believe they haven't released this on DVD. Just the fact that no one is selling thier used video tapes of it should tell the production company something.,1307577600,,279,4.283018867924528
7982140,5,B00008DI1V,"I saw this movie once on tv and fell in love with it. Though I was a teenager I have been trying to hunt it down ever since. It's awesome. Probably the best vampire comedy I've ever seen. If you have the opportunity to purchase it, don't miss out, because you'll love it and if you don't....sell it to me!",1285286400,5,305,4.1
7982141,5,B00008DI1V,I would love to have this movie in my collection. Can't believe it is not available!  Please!  Re-release it!,1200873600,5,109,4.684210526315789
