8396887,5,B003H80XWM,Have been watching Inspector REX on the Spanish public television station out of Denver.  This cd is great. Gives the background on how the show and the dog went from Austria to Rome.  It is sort of a Rin Tin Tin for grown ups.  Acting is good and the dog is awesome!!  Well worth the purchase price.,1456963200,3,300,4.2105263157894735

The other characters are great too.
