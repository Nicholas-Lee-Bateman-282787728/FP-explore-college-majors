8344959,5,B001UR7X6G,I always wanted to see how Cajon Pass was widened and this video explained in great detail how it was done.  I'm glad I was able to get my copy through Amazon.  Pentrex was out of them so I came here.  Thanks for your help!,1395705600,,223,3.911111111111111
8344960,5,B001UR7X6G,"I'm a big rail fan, and I've bought quite a few of Pentrex videos/dvds in the past. The Pentrex videos, are well done. This one, was very enjoyable to watch. Lots of information about Cajon Pass, as well as the construction, of the ""3rd"" rail. The ""Cab' Ride, is also fun to watch, from the conductor's viewpoint, going up the pass. You will enjoy this DVD!",1294790400,,357,4.424242424242424
