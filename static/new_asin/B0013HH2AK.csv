8250977,5,B0013HH2AK,This film is incredibly moving and educational.  It does a nice job of educating the viewers about the situation in Sudan while inspiring action and at the very least the reminder that each single person can make a positive impact on the lives of others.  Even the jaded might agree.  A definite must see!,1212969600,3,305,4.611111111111111
8250978,5,B0013HH2AK,"The film opens with a high school janitor mopping a classroom floor after a school day is over. The janitor, Brian Burns, starts to relate how he happened to volunteer in a Sudanese refugee camp. Although the film says it is about ""ordinary"" persons, it soon becomes clear that Brian is an extraordinary person. We see his compassion, sensitivity, humor and courage on display in his narration of the video footage of his visit to Sudan.
Others tell similar stories about their own response to the genocide of our time, which is taking place as I write this review and you read it. The question lifted up throughout the documentary is, What can one person do?
Bruce Janu is a high school teacher, and the film does a good job of quickly teaching us about Sudan, the land, its history and its people--and why the genocide is taking place. Despite the disturbing images (they cannot be anything less) one finishes viewing the film with a sense of hope. I recommend it for middle and high school students, community groups, and anyone who wants a first-person account of the moral crisis of our time. You will be glad you bought it and will want to buy copies for your friends.",1204934400,5,1174,4.62200956937799
8250979,5,B0013HH2AK,"Normally, it's hard to watch something as horrifying as genocide and this film, unavoidably, has that dimension. But unlike other films that leave you feeling guilty and hopeless, I left this film knowing that the seemingly small contributions people make to try to change something this horrible can have a profound impact. I bought a few copies and have already given them to others so I just ordered another one. Janu knows how to tell a story and Flannery's music is the perfect compliment. Difficult topic but very important to watch, discuss and act on.
