8119983,1,B000FBFTXW,"Once upon a time, when stars were caught swearing, it was considered taboo - now, when you have videos of 2-years old doing it, whoop de doo ... this is not much of anything especially since it seems everything was transferred to videotape that was then stored in a humid basement and then transfered to DVD here ... this would have been bad resoution in 1975 - nevermind, 30 years later. Most of the footage is out-takes from movies & Tv shows where people swear, there are a couple of intersting nude ""out-takes"" that presumably the director asked the actresses to do to shock the clients (like the Johnson & Johnson baby powder one with nudity and a lesbian kiss :-) ) and it is interesting to finally see the Soupy Sales stripper behind the door but that's a total of 2-minutes AND again, that 2-minutes of interesting look like they were taped on a 1970's Russina tape recorder and transfered back ... most of the footage have a green pall over everything and low resolution ... so unless you're a TV historan who is looking for low res footage of what might've been taboo 40 years ago, you might find 2-minutes of worthwhile footage, otherwise, this tape is anthropology ... someone buried the original VHS in dirt and then transfered to DVD.",1213488000,3,1248,4.6008968609865475
