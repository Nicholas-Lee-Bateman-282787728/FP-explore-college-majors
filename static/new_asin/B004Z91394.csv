SPOILER ALERT
The Trial of a Time Lord is a 14-part serial. It contains four adventures: The Mysterious Planet, Mindwarp, Terror of the Vervoids, and The Ultimate Foe  Colin Baker's final story.

The idea for the serial stemmed from several production changes to Doctor Who, such as reduced screen time for the season and a request from BBC controller Michael Grade that the series contain less violence and more humor.  Several problems occurred during production, including the death of scriptwriter Robert Holmes, and the resignation of script editor Eric Saward. This was the last serial to star Colin Baker after he was dismissed from the role when it ended.

The first episode begins with a motion-control special effect sequence depicting the Doctor's TARDIS being plucked out of time and space. The Doctor is charged with breaking the First Law of Timea law forbidding interference in alien worldsby the High Council of Gallifrey. In his prosecution, the Valeyard presents the transgressions in the style of flashbacks on a video screen, depicting the Doctors past adventures with companion Peri Brown. As the trial progresses, the Doctor becomes suspicious about evidence being censored and his TARDIS being bugged.
In the first flashback presented by the Valeyard, the Doctor and Peri arrive on the tribal planet Ravolox, about two million years in the future. The Doctor notes a similarity between Ravolox and Earth, with objects from Earth  notably Marble Arch tube station and the novel Moby Dick  present on Ravolox. The only apparent astronomical difference between the two is Ravolox's position in the galaxy
Meanwhile, rogue Sabalom Glitz attempts to obtain hidden secrets and advanced technology that are guarded by a robot. The Doctor is forced to deactivate the robots unstable power supply to avoid a chain reaction that threatens the universe, but in the process the secrets are destroyed. As he leaves Ravolox, the Doctor wonders why Earth appears to have been moved several million light years from its original position.",1468800000,,2419,5.232558139534884
