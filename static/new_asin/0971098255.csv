Especially the added bonus features where the camera guy decides we need to see Carmack from every angle, close up of body parts, from head to toe...the entire 'package'....Enjoy.",1155772800,8,350,5.140350877192983
173654,5,0971098255,"WOW! Is it just me or is this the hottest yoga workout ever? I started to do yoga along with Chris Carmack until I watched him and, ""Whoa!"" is all I can say. He's real good at what he does, I guess. I don't really know too much about it, but ladies, you don't have to buy it for the exercise. Please buy it for Carmack! He's gorgeous!!!

At the end of the dvd, there are some inappropriate shots of him taken that just makes it all worthwhile. Thank you, Mr. Photographer!",1136764800,9,472,4.130434782608695
173655,5,0971098255,"This is my second review of this program.
 I have had it now for a while and it is a favorite in my now 70 plus collection of Yoga VHS/DVD's.
 This program, which is just under an hour long (minus the intro and credits) is one of Baron's easier, yet not easy, programs. I was definitely sweating though and my room wasn't heated :)
  Don't let the slick production put you off or you might miss out on an excellent opportunity to practice.
 Here's the basic layout of the sequence which I think speaks for itself:
 WATER SERIES
Down Dog/Rag Doll/Sun Salutation ""A"" 2 x;s/Sun Salutation w/ low lunge 2x's/Sun Salutation ""B"" 2x's/Hold ""Thunderbolt"" pose/Uttanasana/Padahastasana/Samasthiti
 FIRE SERIES
Triangle/Wide Leg Forward Bend/Warrior 1/Wide Leg Forward Bend/Warrior 2 to Side Angle Bend (Parsvakonasana)then do the same 2 poses on the left side/Wide Leg Forward Bend w/ hands clasped behind and bringing them overhead/Twisting Warrior (prayer Twist) to Warrior 2(then do same 2 poses on the left side)/Wide Leg Forward Bend (holding toes)/
 EARTH SERIES
Sun Salutation ""A"" w/ a long Down Dog / Eagle (left arm over right/ right leg over left)/Dancer Pose (Natarajasana)/Airplane on one leg, then bring hands to the floor, then back to airplane/Tree Pose/Sun Salutation/Locust Sequence/Bow/Child's Pose/Cat flow (extended cat/arched cat)/Bridge or Wheel/Knees to chest/Pashimottanasana w/ hands crossed reaching for opposite feet,  then extend one arm out while twisting and looking at extened hand and back
  WIND SERIES
Navasana/Twisting Situps/One Arm ""Happy Baby"" (Bug) then grab toe and lift face to leg, then bring leg outward/seated twist to left while looking to the right(then repeat the entire sequence w/ the left leg)/Baddha Konasana/Janu Sirasana Variation (reach left hand to right leg) to Seated Twist to Seated Pigeon Variation (then repeat on the other side)/Seated Alternate Nostril Breathing /Seated Meditation (w/ normal breathing)/Savasana
Inhale and bring arms overhead/Exhale and lower back to the sides
 That is basically the routine as far as the overall sequence goes. It's very thorough yet very doable and I think Baron does a great job of leading you through the program as always!
 HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
 Namaste",1084665600,3,2245,5.340909090909091
173656,5,0971098255,"This DVD is a great value.  First, it has an outstanding yoga for athletes section, with a pre-sport warmup, post-sport leg-strengthening and stretching series, and a terrific abdominal routine.  This alone is worth the price of the DVD if you are any kind of athlete and want to play harder and smoother with fewer aches and pains.  The ab routine is also among the best I've ever seen, in that it focuses on using the abdominals to move the whole body instead of just ""burning"" the abs for aesthetics.  Workout two is a really challenging workout on the order of Bryan Kest's 1995 series, with slightly more emphasis on balancing poses and slightly less emphasis on holding leg poses.  This is one of the most challenging yoga workouts out there and will leave you feeling great.  Number three is less spectacular but still a good workout -- it is essentially the Ashtanga first series cut in half and toned down to make it accessible to less adventurous yogis.  Workout #3 is also good because it introduces the key yoga concepts of yoga breathing, internal muscle control or ""locks"" and the use of the gaze to aid concentration.  Yes, the feng shui of the set may not be all it could be, Baron wears a silly headband and the music is cheesy, but really, who cares?  When my VHS tapes of these workouts wear out, you know I will be getting this DVD.",1065830400,16,1352,4.553719008264463
173657,5,0971098255,"An American friend recommended that I try Yoga because I was generally feeling unwell, and said that Baron Baptiste was very popular in her home country, plus I could hardly find any Yoga videos in Japan.  I have been completely surprised by the amount of flexibility I have gained over the past 2 months, and I no longer suffer from lower back trouble or the persistent leg cramps that have plagued me since childhood.  If you're feeling generally unfit, miserable and too poor to go to a gym, you'll really benefit from this video.",1021334400,8,533,4.659574468085107
173658,5,0971098255,"I got this video after reading on Mr. Baptiste reputation and fame as a power yoga instructor. I understand that this is a begginer's program and it is good in that way, since instead of calling for a pose to be performed i.e.. cobra, downward dog, warrior I, warrior II, etc.; in most cases it tells you what body parts or limbs to move to achieve such pose. So for someone with some previous knowledge of yoga, like myself, it was somewhat distracting.
The whole class is divided into four continous sessions that increase in intensity ending in relaxation and breathing exercises. I didn't appreciate the fact that there are some editing and montages in the midst of each session,I found that distracting. The best thing for me to do was, to watch it completly at first, and then rewind it and follow the tape only by listening to the instruction, glancing only occasionally over the screen to make sure I was in the correct pose.
Mr. Baptiste introduces a good array of poses that work (or stretch) every muscle on yor body so one will never get bored after a few weeks of exercising with this video. I will also try his other more famous video ""Live!"" and hope it would also work for me. If you're interested in working your body gently by pushing it to a higher degree, or just want to explore another side of hatha yoga, go ahead and buy this tape; if you want to expand your yoga practice and get a workout out of it, and if you have enough stamina, I will also recommend any of ""Brian Kest's Power Yoga"" series which are a bit more ""intense"" than this one.",1019779200,7,1565,4.4375
173659,5,0971098255,"I did this for the first time last night.  I ended up drained yet refreshed, it is wonderful!  A great variety of poses that leave you feeling thoroughly worked out, fast paced yet doable.  Obviously not for total beginners, you do need to have a basic knowledge of the poses (I recommend Kathy Smith's New Yoga Basics, and Planet Yoga's Yoga Practice: Introduction sounds like it could be good too).  I started off by ordering Bryan Kests' ""beginner's"" version and collapsed within 5 minutes - that was maybe 7 weeks ago and I have built up stamina since then, with the help of, among others, Buns of Steel (sic) Power Yoga - excellent for beginners.  This was tough, but I worked through it all, not easily but no straining either - worked up a sweat, and enjoyed it thoroughly.  The sections all make sense on their own, but doing the whole thing was perfect.  I  have never done such a fast moving flow of balance poses - and I wouldn't have dreamt I could - but I did!  Same with a spinal twist warrior - what a buzz!  And by the end, my stretch had deeopened more than ever!  His instructions are insightful, detailed and encouraging.  The music is inspiring, and the class background is helpful. I can't wait to work up to one of his tougher tapes - eventually!",1015804800,11,1268,4.465217391304348
173660,5,0971098255,"Baron is one of my most favorite yoga teachers-him and Bryan Kest when I'm a more ""hard core"" practice.  This is a great tape for novices or more seasoned practioners looking a ""lighter"" practice.  Broken into four sections-Water, sun salutes from modified to full to warm you up; Fire, standing poses and lunges (it lives up to it's name your muscles will burn!); Earth, balancing poses and ""core"" poses to ground you; and Wind, final stretches and breathing exercises (hence the name:).  I've had this tape well over a year and I use often, when I want to do power yoga but perhaps not head on.  Baron is an amazing teacher who exudes a calm you want to achieve.

7794359,5,0971098255,"This is one of the very first yoga videos I got, back in 2000.

It's 4 routines: Water, Fire, Earth, and Wind.  You can do all of them, or just a few if you are short on time.  The whole program is about 60 minutes long.  It would be perfect on DVD; I do wish that it would be re-issued.

Water is a sun salutation sequence, but broken down so that beginners can keep up (lots of modifications shown).

Fire has Warrior sequences and lunge sequences

Earth concentrates on balance and abdominal strength

Wind is gentle, with seated stretching and breath work.

It's Baron in front of a live ""class"".  His ""Baronisms"" have never bothered me, for some reason ('there's no gain in the strain' and so on), whereas Travis Elliot and Bryan Kest drive me crazy.  Baron was born into a yoga family and grew up practicing yoga.  He really does know his stuff.

I like this video very much--it has a slower pace than many power yoga practices, so I have never felt rushed.

The proof of the pudding is that I still do this practice 13 years later. Clearly it has stood the test of time.",1368316800,,1077,4.346733668341709

7794363,5,0971098255,"This is an excellent workout.  I was drenched in sweat halfway through the first phase.  The instructors voice is not annoying.  Too many yoga dvds are not directed at men, and when they are, they tend to have very non-athletic, hairy or iffeminate men demonstrating the poses or very annoying and talkative instructors. This dvd is simple and straightforward.  Chris Carmack is a perfect demonstrator of the poses -- he has excellent form and his build, which he received from practicing yoga, gives the workout credibility and is motivating for other men.
I agree that some familiarity with yoga is required because this dvd assumes you know the basic forms -- I woud recommend Jonathan Urla's yogilates dvds as he is very good at describing and teaching form, and once you have that down, you can do this dvd.",1186531200,,812,4.820143884892087
