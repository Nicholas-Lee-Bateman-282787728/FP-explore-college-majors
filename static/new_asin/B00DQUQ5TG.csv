Granted, I ordered this set during winter where our temps were well below freezing, but the set came cellophane wrapped and there was obvious damage to the cases before I opened the set and also found broken hubs in three of the four cases. Since the set was shipped by Amazon with other items, and was in an undamaged box with air-pillow protection in the package, the damage had to come from the mfgr. Sadly this is also the case of another set I just bought, made by the same company, which also has at least one broken case, which is in the middle of the wrapped set. I have not had a chance to check out the hubs on that set yet so I can't confirm any further damage there.
The reasonable price for the set has now been offset by a need to replace most of the cases. I have some stick-on replacement hubs which I will try first, but the quality of the cases is such that trying to fix them might do more harm than good.
The one thing that made this purchase worthwhile is the storylines and acting. A teenage boy and his little sister taking on some pretty tough bad folks... and prevailing in the end. And, as an extra treat, each episode usually has some great trick riding by young Bill and he even does a great job of taking on the bad guys one-one with just his fists and a judo throw or two. His sister Ian't afraid to do her bit together and she's has great skill with a slingshot. There is really very limited gunplay as well.
If you don't mind replacing some damaged cases, this is a good set to show older children since it shows the younger generation in a positive light without profanity or sulkyness. And the kids also show respect to their adopted father (which is a winner...in my book...any day.)",1463616000,,1823,4.28695652173913
