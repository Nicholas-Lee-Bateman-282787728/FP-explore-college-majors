8592643,5,B00DEO0EVO,"Excellent study of what it must have been like to grow up in Nazareth in the time of Jesus.  This teaching was really thought provoking!  Life must have been very hard for people with means, let alone the poor and Dr. Smith does a great job of conveying what life in a small town was like at that time.  First-class teaching from a man who is fast becoming the best teacher I've ever heard (great pod casts from the church he pastors-- Grace Church of Sebring, FL).  I'd never heard of him before I saw him do a teaching last summer and he really is the best Bible expositor I've ever heard, especially if you want a Hebraic understanding of the text.  I look forward to watching his other video teachings.",1415750400,2,706,4.358778625954199
