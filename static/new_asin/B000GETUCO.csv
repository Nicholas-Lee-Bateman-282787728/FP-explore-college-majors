The movie starts out with a failed raid by rebel Filipino forces against a Japanese stronghold. The Japanese plan of having their top brass all gather at a bordello on the island. Our military, lead by Major Stonewall (an unkempt John Ericson, Sam Bolt from TV series ""Honey West"") devises a plan to train and place four women in the midst of them. We meet the major in the middle of an improbable high stakes poker game where he bluffs his way through. He is chosen because he thinks outside the box. He meets with Paco Rodriguez (Ramon Revilla), the leader of the rebels as they openly discuss options while drinking in a public bar in Australia. After a bar fight where the guys get beaten up by a woman who knees them in a soft spot, Paco comes up with an idea of using women.

The first stop is a female prison. After the cat fight, Ericson selects imprisoned killer, Rose Carson (Nory Wright). She slit the throat of her boyfriend for sleeping with another woman, apparently illegal outside of Georgia.

The second woman is Anna Oleson, a doll face pacifist nurse with a fatal disease and has only 2 months to live (after the 60 day training course). Anna is played by Johanna Raunio, who two years earlier in 1974 was Miss Finland !

Sonya (Liza Lorena) is added as the third member. Her family was tortured, raped, and killed by the Japanese. She herself was raped.

The fourth girl is Cindy Lee Dawson, a prostitute who has a price on her head for ""crossing the black market."" Played by Crystin Sinclaire she has the facial features of Traci Lords and a raspy voice.

Most of their training is accomplished in a long music montage. The girl's manage to infiltrate the bordello (as if anyone would think otherwise). No one questions how 3 English speaking ""round eyes"" 2 of which are blonde happen to be part of this group of Filipino comfort girls. Cindy Lee Dawson and Nory Wright provide the movie's nude scenes, which are brief and nearly PG-13 by today's standards.

Wild Riders:

Pete (Arell Blanton) and Stick (Alex Rocco) are two bikers. They have that ""Of Mice and Men"" relationship with Stick not being all there. They are too bad for the biker gang and get kicked out and do the home invasion scene.

The film was horrible on many levels.

8131033,1,B000GETUCO,"I don't know about the movie Wild Riders because I wasn't interested, but here is my review on Hustler Squad:

The cover REALLY FOOLED ME!!! I feel like a sucker! I thought this movie was about five female soldiers that shoot up millions of ememies like in the movie Commando, Rambo 2 or The Losers. BUT NOOOO!!!! The girls didn't do ANYTHING!!! They just shot a couple of bad guys and left the rest of the enemies for the male soldiers! Of course, the action scenes were so-so, the graphics were blurred, and the story was stupid.

Another thing, the movie has only 3 action scenes: one at the begining, the second in the middle, and the third one at the end. The first and the third one were the longest but they were set at midnight, so you won't see the action so clear.

The only positive thing, is that the dvd has a cool intro with commercials, cartoons and movie previews before the movie starts. The rest is garbage.

Adios.",1266278400,2,933,4.406976744186046
