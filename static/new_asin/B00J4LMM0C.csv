Madsen, Roberts,Miami, Lister and had many twists and turns but I felt the stoppages hurt the film a bit by using freeze frames and voiceover during key plot moments. But in general if you ignore that the performances were very good for a modest budget Indie Film. I call it a poor man's THE DEPARTED. FUN FILM. COOL CHARACTERS.",1501459200,,367,4.575757575757576

8648038,1,B00J4LMM0C,I found this dvd at the dollar store..i guess that should have told me something but i saw Eric Roberts and Michael Madsen and thought it is worth a dollar..i am not sure it was.  It is not good.  Aside from Madsen  and Roberts showing up every now and then..it is full of bad actors waving guns and dropping F bombs..narration by madsen is better than the movie itself.,1467763200,,370,4.333333333333333
8648039,1,B00J4LMM0C,"Full disclosure: I picked up this movie fully expecting it to be filled with terrible acting and special effects.  The only reason I picked it up was because the cover showed a car chase between an 07-09 Shelby GT500 and an 03-04 Mustang SVT Cobra.  I could care less about the rest of the movie as long as the car chase is good.

It's not.

The car chase lasts all of 30-45 seconds, with guys leaning out the windows waving fake pistols at each other, and mis-timed, dubbed shooting sound effects drowning out the cars. The producers couldn't even be bothered to add in some fake muzzle flashes.

Besides that, it's obvious that the ""chase"" occurs at about 25 mph, and they're SERIOUSLY trying not to ding the cars.  BO-RING.  Plus, those cars are some of the most special Mustangs out there, yet they make no effort to play up the cars.

So, to sum up: bad writing, horrible acting, narration that doesn't make sense, story that jumps around, non-existent special effects, AND they managed to make a car chase between a GT500 and a ""Terminator"" Cobra boring.

I can't think of one redeeming quality about this movie.  The quality is something you would expect with an adult film, and it's just like one...minus the adult action.  It's not even worth watching to laugh at, and if you tried to play a drinking game to it, you would quickly succumb to alcohol poisoning.",1422230400,,1369,4.592592592592593
8648040,1,B00J4LMM0C,"Michael Madsen and Eric Roberts conspire to give us the worse film imaginable. Terry (Stephen Cloud) and Danny (Michael Masini) are two cops who work for Sgt Bachman (Eric Roberts). Danny also works for crime boss Cole Lambert (Madsen) in L.A. Terry wants to take down the Russian mafia crime boss, of which his brother-in-law Ivan is a member. There is also a third crime boss Gino (Robert Miano) in Vegas who gets involved.

The film introduces female characters, and then don't really use them.  There is a brief car chase scene, but not much action or thrills in this crime drama, that didn't have much drama either. In order to try to save the film from being a complete disaster, Madsen supplies some omniscient Joe Bob Briggs style narration, even through he is one of the characters away from the scene. Disjointed, uneven, and a bit annoying.

Don't feel you missed anything if you skipped over this film.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. Stripper nudity.",1402099200,6,956,4.810975609756097
