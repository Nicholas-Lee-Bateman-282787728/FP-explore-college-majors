3446897,5,B001ACI5BI,"We have purchased several other educational/reading videos for our two kids, but the preschool prep series by far is the best.  Our now five year old is reading at about second grade level and 2 year old has an inventory of 50 sight words, thanks in large part to these videos.  The characters are very appealing and the animations are great!  You won't be disappointed when your child starts ""reading"" off signs and labels!  Enjoy...",1234742400,,434,4.746666666666667
3446898,2,B001ACI5BI,"I am a teacher and I thought the concept of these videos sounded good.  I got ""Meet the Sight Words"" for my 4 year old and the numbers video for a 2 year old.  They cry if I put them on.  They say they are for babies, and boring.  I have had great success with the Leap Frog videos, as well as Word World.  I think pre-school prepco products are for the very young, as in under 2 years old.",1233187200,5,390,3.825
3446899,5,B001ACI5BI,"This series of dvd's are great.  My 2 1/2 year old daughter doesn't watch much tv here at home but we do have a dvd player in our car.  I decided early on that I wouldn't just play movies with no educational value since she's so mesmorized by movies in general.  These dvd's are horribly boring to listen to but when there is nothing else to do in the car, she watches and listens to them...and in turn learns from them.  I highly recommend these dvd's, it's amazing how much young ones absorb.",1232841600,,494,4.279569892473118
3446900,5,B001ACI5BI,I bought this for my son who is autistic and in an inclusive Kindergarten class.  He is a visual/tactile learner and seeing the words on the screen and hearing each word repeatly helped him to learn his sight words.  He seemed to be able to focus better since there was not alot of distraction.  Every aspect of the animation was geared to each word.,1231804800,5,350,4.4375

I have bought 2 different sets for our family and have bought multiple sets as gifts. I would definitely recommend this product and their whole series. Every video that my kids were exposed to, they learned the concept within a week or 2. Their videos Meet the Diagraphs and Meet the Blends taught me a lot and my kids teach others (even other adults) because of it. Buy it and use it.

3446949,5,B001ACI5BI,"My two year old loves learning. Between 14 and 18 months she picked up the alphabet and recognition, sounds, shapes, colors, and numbers 1-10 in english and spanish. She taught herself through tablet apps. It's a year later and i decided she may like sight words and learning to read. I rented the Meet the Sight words 1-3 and they were a hit. After 1 or 2 viewings each, she had learned them all. She knew some of them already, but because of this company's videos, she learned the rest with ease. After she proved she knew those, I rented the digraph video and again, it only took a few viewings for her to learn them. I love these videos and though I'm not sure I'll buy them physically since she caught on so fast, I'll definitely give as gifts or recommend to others I know. She's currently watching the blends video. It's longer than the other videos, so she loses interest towards the end and doesn't catch those blends. However, she's catching on quickly. I should add that all of the stuff I just said happened over a period of a week. They're awesome videos, I'm glad I ran across the 'sh' video on youtube. My daughter instantly loved it, which is what prompted our week of Sight Words and Phonics. I'm elated that she's pre-k/kindergarten ready at only 2.5! If you're still hesitant, go on youtube and let your little one watch the previews to determine if these are the right videos for them.",1397347200,,1405,4.4921875

3446952,5,B001ACI5BI,"I bought this set to help my son learn how to read. To be honest, I wasn't expecting too much, but was pleasantly surprised at how effective these dvds are. They have wonderful songs, and huge letter. My son picked up the words right away. He's 5 now, but has been fully reading since he was 4.",1391472000,,294,4.175438596491228
3446953,3,B001ACI5BI,"My child is in Kindergarten but needs a lot of repetition before she can retain memorized facts. I knew going in that the DVD was probably going to be a bit boring for her, especially since it seems like it's geared toward younger children, but I just wanted to pop it into the DVD in our car so she got extra practice while we weren't able to work on them together at home. I bought all three DVDs and the third set of books.

The DVDs are pretty boring -- to the point that she tunes it out before she's learned all the words because she's bored to tears. That being said, it has helped her remember some of the words better than if we were just working on them at home. Overall I'm glad I got them but I wish I had seen it a couple years ago when it would have held her attention longer. If your child has a hard time focusing their attention on the TV you might want to think twice about getting the DVDs.

The books are another story -- those are great. Based on other reviews I only got the third set that contains all the words from the three DVDs and I really do like them. Somehow every sentence is made from mostly sight words, which means it's great practice of all the words. I'm sure you're all familiar with Level 1 readers that have a few sight words sprinkled throughout the book with most of the words being longer, sound-out types that make it more difficult for a budding reader. Even the books aimed at being ""sight word"" helpers don't typically include very many sight words. These books actually have a lot of the words in them, in easy sentences, with engaging story lines. I actually like them better than Bob books. Totally worth the money.",1391472000,4,1665,4.282539682539682
3446954,5,B001ACI5BI,"Can't say enough about these dvd's. My daughter has an extensive vocabulary, loves to read, and create stories.  Reading to her from a young age helped. But, I credit this set for helping her to read at a young age. After watching this set, her reading took off. By four she was reading early readers.",1391299200,,301,4.472727272727273
3446955,5,B001ACI5BI,"The whole series 1-3 we purchased together. We got these when our son was 3. Within a few short months he mastered all the site words. Just as the video says .. you will be surprised just how easy your little one can learn. He just turned 6 and doing well in figuring out how to sound out words on his own.
I must add that I just didn't plop him in front of the tv and said here you go and walk away. I got involved along with him. Made flash cards and a game out of it for him like when he would run from one end of the room to the other, he would call out the word I held up as he ran, jumped, or scootered by. It was so much fun.
We also bought the readers that go along with these and read one a day till he mastered these.

I have all of the sight words, the blends, and digraphs.  All are of equal quality.  There are also videos of colors, shapes, and letters from this company.

The first time he watches a new DVD, he does not express an interest, but I watch it with him and say the words out loud and he catches on very quickly. He just turned three and now knows about 30 sight words by memory and loves looking for them in books and signs. I understand what people are saying about the animations not matching the words, but they make the connection. My son will point to the word ""in"" and say that it is the peacock one (because there is a peacock in the animation). He makes that connection and then memorizes the word that much faster. I did not buy the letters/numbers/colors DVD's because he knows all of those already.

My daughter can recognize sight words all over now...signs, cereal boxes, etc.  This will not make a ""reader"" out of your child but will get them over the hump of recognizing words that do not fit the phonics rules.

They seem very simple, repetative, but that is the magic.  Kids are mesmerized!  We gave them all away as she grew older and then had our son!  We had to go and buy some more for him.  I highly recommend these videos for kids of all abilities.",1356739200,,376,4.152777777777778

3446981,5,B001ACI5BI,I have a 6 year old who has really struggled to learn to read.  She has no desire to and it's like pulling teeth to get her to try.  I purchased this video and the sight word cards and after watching it one time she knew over half the words.  It was amazing.  I would definitely recommend this video and have already ordered the other two to go with the flash cards.,1294617600,,366,4.041666666666667

3446983,5,B001ACI5BI,"We purchased all 3 videos and at age 3 my son watched and learned ALL the sight words in each DVD.  I made my own flash cards on index cards to practice the words.  We started with Meet the Sight words 1 and wouldn't give him the next video until he mastered the 1st one.  Although my husband and I found the videos to be boring, he liked them and this was a great start for him to read.  At 3 1/2 he began reading BOB books and I credit much of his reading success to these videos.",1291507200,6,482,3.8877551020408165

3446985,5,B001ACI5BI,"I would recommend this to anyone wanting a beginning reading curriculum.  I checked this series out from our local library and within two or three times of watching it my 2 and a half year old daughter was reading these sight words in stories and books and on household product packaging.  I was sooooo excited!

The videos are very catchy showing each word in an eye-catching animation with music in the background.  The speaker repeats the word throughout the animation and then later in the video they quiz you on the word with no animation/music then add it in.  Also at the end they recap the sight words using animations that show the words in more realistic settings where your child would most likely read them, for example, for the sight word PLAY it would highlight it on a video game machine that says ""press PLAY.""

I let her watch it either once or sometimes twice a day (rather than brainless cartoons on TV).  She loves it.  I also combine this with those beginning reader sets.  We like the BOB books and also check them out from the library.  The other great tool I liked was the Leap Frog videos of the Lettery Factory (where she learned the sounds the letters make) and Talking Words Factory (which teaches beginning phonics and how to put letters together to make simple words).  We alternate with these educational videos whenever she wants to watch TV.

I am going to purchase this set for my friend's son.  I would highly recommend it.",1290643200,,1458,4.604651162790698

3446987,4,B001ACI5BI,We have all three videos in the series and my two year old daughter is addicted to them all.  It only took her several viewings to learn all the word - she now recognizes and pulls the words out of books I read to her.  It's a little annoying for adults to watch because it it slow and monotonous. I wish they had more words per video instead of having to buy all three in the series - that would be my only complaint.,1278374400,,418,3.9642857142857144

I can't believe how well these work in teaching the sight words.  I highly recommend buying all 3 dvds (they also come as a set).  Don't hesitate, buy these dvds!",1260662400,,419,4.175

We'd bought the Your Baby Can Read package for about a zillion dollars, but this is what actually interested her.  My 9 month old son, for some reason, likes to watch it too.  I don't know what he gets from it, but he has bursts of spontaneous laughter when watching!

First she learned all the letter sounds by watching LeapFrogs Letter Factory. That took about six times of watching the DVD. Then I bought the Preschool Prep Sight Words series. She watched each one until she learned it. That took about 12 times for each DVD. She is now about 8 months into the whole process and can read over 100 words and can phonetically sound out many more. We are now able to check out some beginning reading books at the library and she is having loads of success. I believe these DVD's were fascinating to her and I only wish they would have more DVD's to reach up to the first 100 sight words and perhaps ""blends"".",1250726400,,790,4.273333333333333
