8451603,3,B0050PLTD2,"I don't know where to start.  The delivery drivers of the ""round 2"" virus which is labeled pigment for a very questionable tatoo artist at a very out of the way parlor are your worst nightmare for someone you want to deliver something fragile.  If he was the last tatoo artist on earth and I was dying for a tatoo and my life depended on it, I would die.  Talk about hazardous to your health.  The drivers don't get an answer at the door to the rundown, dilapidated dwelling so the guys decide to put the box in the mailbox which of course is too small.  The ""driver"" smashes it with his foot until it fits.  Mentioning one thing that was soooo gross was the camera zooming in on him eating a sandwich which made me want to never eat again.  I don't mind the occasional F word but this movie should have had the F word in the title it was used so much which really ruined the movie for me.  There are just so many far fetched things that happen that are extremely unrealistic.  I mean when 2 cops walk into a pizza parlor that looks like a blood bath occurred there and one of them orders blood drenched slices, the world is going to s--t.  Also, anytime feces is introduced into a movie, it is disgusting beyond belief which comes into play at the end of the movie in a jail scene.  It probably is worth a watch if you are a zombie movie fan.  I suppose a couple of the scenes are gross.  But this movie takes a different turn.  The zombies appear to only kill people they dislike.  The best part, the approximately 400 pound wife of the pizza parlor owner.  She was a hoot.  Don't pay more than $5 though.  I watched it but won't keep it for future watching.",1376611200,,1660,4.199367088607595
8451604,4,B0050PLTD2,"Well now, this was a pleasant surprise. A nice twist on the zombie genre that didn't end up being buried by it's lower budget. It even had creativity to spare. Hollywood hates new ideas, it seems. So I'll just keep hoping and praying that little movies like this keep getting made that show the big guys that originality is not dead after all.

We start out in Afghanistan, where the government has invented a serum called ROUND 2 that you inject into recently dead soldiers. It reanimates them and let's them carry on killing those they hate, and not harming their own troops. The problem happens to be when a reanimated soldier bites an enemy instead of outright killing it. I think you can see the problems, and why the government stopped using it.

Back in the good old U.S.A. a freak accident and some bad luck has a tube of ROUND 2 end up in a tattooists ink supply. I know, it sounds stupid. It is, kind of. But I realized early on, that this was going to be the type of movie that logic does not apply to. Just go with the flow and enjoy the events unfold. At the local pizza shop in town, a few jobless punks tell the pizza shops owner that if he gets a tattoo, they'll leave his shop and never come back. This is the set-up for the Virus to be introduced into the civilian population, and the reasoning is as lame as it sounds. But hey, go with the flow. The tattoo is done, the pizza shop owner returns to his shop, tells the punks to get out, then drops dead... for a minute. Then this fun, outrageous gorefest truly begins.

The gore effects in the film are great considering they must have had a pretty tight budget. There are even a few nice, brutal kills that made me wince a little. They did that good. And whoever edited the film did a great job, using split screen at some points, and giving it a 70's feel. One of the problems that I did have was that the film makers went for a grindhouse look, putting way too much fake film damage and artifacts onto the screen. It's almost distracting, especially during the beginning of the film, when we are learning who the characters are. I had the same complaint with the Tarantino film Grindhouse, and that was to give us two versions of the film, so that we can choose to have the grindhousing effects on or off. Actually, since it was done digitally, it could just be an option on the menu to have those effects on or not.

I can overlook that one problem though, as the movie was a joy to watch. There are some humorous moments that help move the film along at a nice clip, and I would really like to know how they got such great zombie makeup effects on their low budget. I hope they release a CD, because the soundtrack to this film was great, and you'll want to have it in your collection. Be sure to watch through the end credits for some more story, and it looks like it's set up for a sequel as well. Let's Kill Some Dead People! 7/10.",1372032000,,2907,4.260869565217392
8451605,2,B0050PLTD2,"An experimental drug called ""Round Two"" which revives dead people in combat, irregardless of what they died from, somehow winds up in Canada. While being transported, the truck has a minor accident where a container with a squirt top gets left at the residence of Dan (Dave Montour) a less than sanitary tattoo ""artist.""

The town has a struggle between the clean cut looking crowd and the tattooed skate boarders who all like to drink at the same pizza place. Pete (Chris Waldick) the owner of the establishment, in a bad plot point, opts to get a tattoo at Dan's, who by now has said drug/chemical which looks like tattoo pigment. The rest you can figure out.

The movie was shot with a fake grainy ""grindhouse"" on top of the super clear DVD, giving it an unusual, if not ridiculous look. The blood and head rolls were also very fake looking. The film consisted of bad dialouge and a bunch of swearing that would have an eighth grade appeal to it. The movie also introduces some token female characters that don't play a role, other than to be in a film. Gee, guess what that was all about. Not worth a $.99 rental.

8451606,3,B0050PLTD2,"Not a bad little movie.  Plenty of blood and decent effects are all here.  The lack of commentary or bonus leaves little for you to sink your teeth into or revisit.  I would not call it comedy, there is an over-the-top grindhouse feel and very colorful characters with the ""F Bomb"" being the main word of choice in most conversations.  Just a few shades shy of being ""Troma"". So yeah, if you are in the mood for something more serious than a Troma flick check it out.  Certainly a worthy watch for a B movie and it is a decent film.",1347235200,,532,4.227722772277228
8451607,5,B0050PLTD2,"I truly loved this zombie grind house flick, it has a lot to offer those who enjoy a fusion of gore & horror (GORROR). The music was great, the gore and special FX were FANTASTIC & for the most part the acting was good. The only thing I did not like about this movie was the OVERKILL on the 70's style film effect (especially within the first 30 min. very annoying). It soon became less and less and then tolerable, but that is the only bad thing I can say about ""VS. The Dead"". It's a different twist on your average zombie flick and has some really great moments enhanced with comical overtones. It packs a punch with the blood, guts & gore which is a key element for a worthy zombie flick. The camera shots & angles are FANTASTIC! Who ever was running the camera knows what they are doing, the fine editing is also worth mentioning . I highly recommend ""VS THE DEAD"" to anyone who loves a good zombie gore flick. There is NO DOUBT that VS THE DEAD will become a cult classic. Order your copy, you won't regret it. VS THE DEAD receives 2 Bloody Thumbs Up, WAY UP! I would personally like to interview the creators, cast & crew for this film, so if you're up for it contact me here or on  my website.

8451608,3,B0050PLTD2,"This dvd is amazing,Seriously good stuff for a escape to a gentler Exploitation Era !
We got War in Afganistan,Then the undead soldiers...How is that for a location shot.
The all - Canada actors mostly succeed in getting into character and then the action totally distracts you into the carnage.
The `Grindhouse School' of effects is great, Yes...It's overused and pedestrian in other attempts,But this flick succeeds !
Lots of locations,Lots of tit-for-tat violence and characters that are very fun.",1311897600,5,500,5.2625
