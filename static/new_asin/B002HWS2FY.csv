8370541,1,B002HWS2FY,"This DVD should not be sold as a ""communication skills"" DVD.  It is 100% about sales.  It is packaged in a plain, black and white DVD case and the quality of the video itself (lighting, camera angles, etc.) is very cheap.  While the presenter is generally a good speaker, he has communication quirks such as laughing when what he said was not funny (or even intended to be funny) and overusing hand gestures.  This video would be overpriced in a Dollar Store.",1313452800,,459,4.560975609756097
8370542,3,B002HWS2FY,"Very focused on sales comunication, should meet this particular need if that's what you are looking for. I thought of something more of a general aspect, hence my deception.",1258329600,2,173,5.0
8370543,5,B002HWS2FY,"Years ago my company hired Till Kahrs to do some training, and everyone really enjoyed his facilitation and instruction. His book ""Enhancing Your Presentation Skills"" has become a classic and great way to review the lessons learned. But now with this DVD, complete with facilitated test questions and even a keynote speech, it is so easy to ""brush up"" on these skills and go directly to the section you want to review most. For newcomers, it is like getting a complete training session about Communication Skills right at your finger tips with out having to enroll in a seminar or workshop. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to improve their Communication Skills, be it verbal or physical. Definitely FIVE STARS!!!",1248912000,,728,4.926829268292683

This DVD gives you a step by step way of helping you improve your communications skills!  His way of teaching is just amazing and can be learned by people of all ages!  Highly Recommended!",1248048000,3,334,4.724137931034483
