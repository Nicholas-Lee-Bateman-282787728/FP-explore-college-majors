8292343,3,B001D950NO,"I was under the impression that I was receiving the entire set -- not just the DVD only.  I have always loved Wai Lana's products.  I purchased this workout almost 10 years ago at Burlington Coat Factory for $20 -- Works great.  But my Figure 8 band is kind of worn out so I wanted to purchase another one.  I went to Wai Lana's website.  Hers is selling for a nice price as well.  But then, I thought of Amazon and how reasonably the shipping charges were and plus their shipping is quick.  I am back to where I started from.  I might as well purchase from Wai Lana's site.",1392163200,,574,4.154545454545454
8292344,1,B001D950NO,"This product took a very long time to get to my door, and when it arrived it was an envelope with the DVD only. I was thinking that the rest of the kit would come at a later date, but it seems as though it is not.  How am I supposed to the workout without the Figure 8 and Fitness Ring? Very disappointed in this product.",1389830400,,321,3.8636363636363638
