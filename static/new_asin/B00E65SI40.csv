8601753,3,B00E65SI40,I absolutely Love Blue Exorcist!! the only reason im giving 3 stars is the Blu ray case came in pretty crushed but thankfully the disk were just fine.,1477353600,,150,4.392857142857143
8601754,1,B00E65SI40,I would give this anime 4/5 stats but this blu ray does not freaking work on the USA and amazon didn't let get my money back $40 wasted,1410393600,,135,3.857142857142857
8601755,2,B00E65SI40,I didn't read much into what all I needed for this specific DVD. I need a region B player (wherever I can get that....) In order to play it. So now it just sits in my room. Oh well.,1409011200,,181,3.6666666666666665
8601756,4,B00E65SI40,"If you have a region free blue-ray player then this is one of the reasons you bought it. This portion of the series includes episodes 13-25. My only dissatisfaction lies in that most of the episodes are filler, but the more Blue Exorcist the better.",1403654400,,249,4.555555555555555
