7997965,4,B0000B0JIN,A drama built around the Fall of Saigon. Really shows just how much of a cluster flop the whole evacuation turned into - much to the hundreds wanting out who ended up left behind. Poor planning and a delusional analysis of the situation is really brought out in this drama.,1445817600,,273,4.48
7997966,3,B0000B0JIN,"I found this in one of those cheap ""collection"" movie DVDs for a low price. Not knowing the background of this film, after viewing it, I wondered what American filmmaker would dream of marketing such a truthful and damning account of the American failure in Viet Nam and expect to have a hit.

Turns out it was a BBC (British) made for TV movie. That explains a lot.

It is sad, depressing and honest. Anyone who lived in those days and especially those who served cannot but wonder how the USA could have totally misread the events and simply not planned to meet their obligations to thousands of South Vietnamese workers who ended up being ""re-educated"" by the Communist North. Bad facts, wishful thinking and -of course- politics all contributed to what the film portrays.

I would have given it four stars except for the fact that the makers of the film felt compelled to have some characters say, ""but...we're abandoning all those people we promised to evacuate!"" over and over.  We got the message the first three times.

For those of you who only know of this war from history books, I suggest you watch this and then you may better understand why a lot of folks in their 50's and 60's don't get real excited about the most recent 12 years of activities in the Middle East.",1422144000,,1280,4.572052401746725
7997967,5,B0000B0JIN,"I loved this movie, it was very realistic and moving.  I loved the Dame of course, another brilliant performance, but was really pleasantly surprised by the film.  This is quality for anyone who like the lovely DJD or the subject matter.",1354147200,,237,4.7560975609756095
7997968,5,B0000B0JIN,This movie gives a different view of what happened at the fall of Saigon.  Judi Dench is always worth watching- never gives a bad performance and never performs inanything not worth watching.,1243382400,,191,4.96875
7997969,4,B0000B0JIN,"I'm a Judi Dench fan from way back. This is low-key, not over-the-top with war details and scenes, as the story is more about the regular people, both Vietnamese and American, in their daily lives, leading up to and including the unexpected fast exit from Saigon. I liked the British style of filming, and the possible existences and ways people coped in their unusual circumstances. The reality of people left behind, both by need for quick exit, and by choices made by politicians, brought the story-line into perspective, as to what was not publicized or shown in news reels and reports.  People out of their element who had to adjust in whatever ways they could were portrayed well enough to give the feeling of personal acquaintance with their habits, fears, and isolation.  I happen to like most of the actors in the film already, which makes any film more enjoyable to me. A sad, but not morose film about a time which was felt to be sad by many.. I liked it. Its content was driven by the war and circumstances which many experienced from one direction or another, so it could not have been expected to be a happy film. I read some of the other reviews, and felt compelled to remind : ""Opinions vary, person-to-person"", and I rarely put much weight on another person's judgement of a film. If something about it tugs at me in some way, I watch it and discover the film I will see.  You will do, or will have done whatever pleases you.  I have a copy of this film and watch it periodically.  Dench and Forrest can rarely disappoint this viewer, however.",1191542400,,1560,4.557142857142857
7997970,3,B0000B0JIN,"The movie takes place just before the complete fall of Saigon. Judi Dench plays a British bank employee having a sexual affair with a CIA employee from the American Embassy.
When this agent gets information from reliable sourses that the fall of Saigon is very near, The American ambassador does not listen to any advice, until the last moment when the evacutation of the embassy employees, the military personnel, and some Vietnamese become a horrific nightmare yet a reality. The movie shows the exact real panic in the Embassy, the city and its residents who helped the Americans through out the years, yet felt left behind in hostile hands.
The last American Helicopter leaves Saigon while some more Americans are still calling the Embassy personnel with no one on the other line, waiting in remote places in the city for the Helicopters to come to their rescue.
A very moving true story. I recommend this movie to all the history lovers.
The quality of the DVD is not perfect but very acceptable.
