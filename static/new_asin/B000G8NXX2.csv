8129417,4,B000G8NXX2,"It's obvious from the outset that director, Ral Rodrguez Peila's goal was to make an Argentine interpretation of a Hollywood action movie.  He succeeded. ""Peligrosa obsesin"" is a thrill ride of 18 wheelers going off bridges, police cars flipping, car chases, shoot outs, explosions, and mad villains.  There's little space left to squeeze in much dialog or a coherent story line, but you won't really miss them.

The glue that holds all the fast paced wreckage together is a thin plot in which an unsuspecting young man, Javier Labat (Pablo Echarri), learns that his family's trucking business has been taken over by some pretty unsavory characters who are now calling all the shots.  Javier's father, Guillermo, was supposed to deliver a major drug shipment but decided to keep the goods for himself.  Now Guillermo lies in a coma and Javier's younger brother is dead.

The drug lords and the police believe that Javier must know where the missing shipment is located.  And both are prepared to use ruthless measures to recover it.  It's up to Javier to save Labat Trucking, and his own life, by staying alive long enough to locate the missing drugs.

Javier is aided by by two acquaintances he makes early in the film.  Tony Corsini (Mariano Martnez), an oddly friendly young man who seems to have an endless supply of relatives in positions to offer assistance, and some advanced high tech skills of his own. The Corsini family have been white collar thieves for six generations; Tony's specialty is computers.  And, Mariana (Carol Castro) a lovely young Brazilian journalist along for the ride.

I've got to say, Pablo Echarri must be the most versatile young actor in Argentina.  He is excellent in serious drama (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Burnt-Money/dp/B000069HUI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Burnt Money</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Method-El-Metodo/dp/B000Q7ZLRY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Method (El Metodo)</a>), surprisingly good at screwball comedy (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Apasionados/dp/B000MRNWU6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Apasionados</a>), and now this.  Javier, the reluctant action hero of ""Peligrosa obsesin"" isn't taxing Echarri's acting skills but he does it well and he obviously spent significant time getting buffed up for the part.

There are some gorgeous location sequences shot in Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires. The DVD format information on this page saying ""black & white"" is in error; this is a color movie.

The DVD includes Spanish audio in Dolby 5.1 or 2.0, optional English subtitles, previews.",1244937600,2,2688,5.889175257731959
