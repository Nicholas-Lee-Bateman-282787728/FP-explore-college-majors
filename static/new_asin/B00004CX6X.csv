7919966,1,B00004CX6X,This product took forever (6 months+) to arrive and that was after I asked for a refund. Then in attempting to view the movie it was defective!  My husband was not happy with his Christmas gift! I still would like a refund.,1436918400,,223,4.309523809523809
7919967,3,B00004CX6X,"In the Babylon 5 universe, spaceships travel faster than the speed of light by entering ""hyperspace,"" which in the show is portrayed as a second kind of space, through a ""jumpgate.""  In this film, a third type of space - ""thirdspace"" - is discovered, promising even faster space travel.  Unfortunately, a nasty Lovecraftian species lives in thirdspace..

This film could have been two episodes of the show spliced together, with a self contained plot not relying on the ongoing story arcs of the series.  The special effects here are pretty similar to the show itself, so the film probably didn't cost them any more to make than the show itself. If you're new to Babylon 5. this film isn't really a good place to start.  If you've seen the series, you could skip this film and not miss anything vitally important.  It's just another adventure.

7919968,2,B00004CX6X,"I'm a big fan of Babylon 5, but this just isn't a high point of the franchise.  The movie has a pretty good premise, but the cast gets out of trouble way too easily.  These Thirdspace aliens are so unspeakably powerful that the Vorlons were no match for them--yet they're obliterated by a...nuclear weapon?  Shouldn't that be like a firecracker to beings that powerful?  And the explosion was strong enough to destroy all the aliens and their mother ship, but it just gave Sheridan a gentle push!  He was close to the explosion and only protected by a space suit, but this colossal detonation gave him some kind of preferential treatment.  What gives?",1382832000,,651,4.716814159292035
7919969,5,B00004CX6X,"I am a big fan of the Babylon 5 series including all the movies. I was sorry to see the series come to an end,I thought hey could have gone even further.
If your a Babylon 5 fan then this movie if for you.",1369094400,,205,3.6818181818181817
