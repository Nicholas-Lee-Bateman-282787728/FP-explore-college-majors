4428601,5,B004M5HA84,"I would really like to see The Golden Palace get released on DVD in a complete series set in the near future.  The Golden Palace was a spin-off of The Golden Girls and it aired 24 episodes for 1 season, during the 1992 - 1993 season on CBS.  The Golden Girls is how it all began and it starred Bea Arthur, Betty White, Rue McClanahan, and Estelle Getty. After 7 years of The Golden Girls, a spin-off was made called The Golden Palace and it starred Betty White, Rue McClanahan, Estelle Getty, Don Cheadle, Cheech Marin, and Billy L. Sullivan. Bea Arthur even made 2 guest appearances.  The Golden Palace has a great fan base on tvshowsondvd.com. The Golden Palace was like an 8th season of The Golden Girls.  The Golden Palace is what's left to get released on DVD so all of us fans can complete our Golden Girls collection. We managed to get all 7 seasons of The Golden Girls released on DVD and hopefully we can manage to get The Golden Palace released on DVD.  On The Golden Palace, there is definitely more of Betty White, Rue McClanahan, and Estelle Getty just waiting to be seen.  There is also more discussions left to be talked about and there is more cheesecake for the girls to eat. If it wasn't for The Golden Girls, The Golden Palace would not have been born.  Me and many other Golden Girl fans have been waiting for a long time to buy The Golden Palace on DVD.

The Golden Girls.
It ran on the CBS network from 1992 until 1993.

Susan Harris also created The Golden Girls.

Dorothy is married to Lucas and living in Atlanta.
Blanche, Rose and Sophia sell their house
and buy a struggling Miami Beach hotel called
The Golden Palace.
They have no idea how hard running a hotel can be,
so it's a good job they have a manager

I think we all agree that the ""Golden Palace"" was ""Season 8"". I for one would like to complete my set!!...Lifetime showed the reruns ONE TIME. I have to say, I found it 10x's funnier the second time around. Don Cheadle said once in an interview that he still get's an apology from the writer/producer of the show for ""making him go thru that"".....I never understood what he meant. I thought is was GREAT!! You can never get enough Rose, Blanche and of course Sophie!!.......I made my first post on this over 4 yrs ago, I really thought they would have released it by now. Some of the crap they bring out on DVD of a show that lasted one season, but they will not bring out what we all call the 8th Season of Golden Girls. What is the reason? Is someone not signing off on this? Are one of the Estate's of cast or a living member of the Cast not allowing this...WE WANT ANSWERS!!!",1356739200,40,994,4.292553191489362
4428614,5,B004M5HA84,"I decided to search out this show after enjoying the Golden Girls so much on reruns and on DVD. I found that they have the episodes on YouTube currently. The show is fantastic, but the quality is bad and you have to watch them in three different videos for each episode. I am sure they'd get good sales if it were released on DVD. Perhaps they could bill it as the last season of Golden Girls (like how the final season of I Love Lucy DVDs were the old Lucy/Desi Comedy Hours).",1356739200,5,477,4.195652173913044

4428616,4,B004M5HA84,"I didn't know for almost five years that there was a spin-off! Here's what I found out about it...

""The Golden Palace"" is an American sitcom that originally aired on CBS from September 18, 1992, to May 14, 1993. It starred Betty White, Rue McClanahan, and Estelle Getty reprising their ""Golden Girls"" roles.

When Bea Arthur decided after seven years of playing Dorothy Zbornak was enough, NBC cancelled the sitcom after seven seasons and 180 episodes in the Nielsen Top 25. The following 1992/93 television season, CBS picked up a spin-off of the series hoping to bring the same success. CBS used The Golden Palace as one of four comedies assembled on Friday night in an effort to combat ABC's TGIF comedy block; ""The Golden Palace"" was grouped with ""Major Dad"", ""Designing Women"", and ""Bob"", all of which were either successful comedies prior to the move or, in the case of ""Bob"", featured a previously successful sitcom star (Bob Newhart).

""The Golden Palace"" achieved mixed reviews and premiered with high ratings; ranking 16th for its premiere week. Without Dorothy, however, CBS retooled the series to be slightly different to fit the other three ladies.

PLOT
""The Golden Palace"" begins where ""The Golden Girls"" left off, in the quartet's now-sold Miami house. With Dorothy Zbornak having married and left in the previous series finale, the three remaining cast members (Sophia Petrillo, Rose Nylund and Blanche Devereaux) decide to invest in a Miami hotel that is up for sale. The hotel, however, is revealed to have been stripped of all of its personnel in an effort to appear more profitable, leaving only two employees: Roland Wilson, the hotel's manager, and Chuy Castillos, the hotel's chef. This requires the women to perform all the tasks of the hotel's staff.

The series focused on the interactions between guests at the hotel and the hotel's staff, as well as between the Golden Girls and the previous hotel staff. Guest stars were frequent, including recurring characters that had previously appeared on ""The Golden Girls"" and other celebrities (Bea Arthur reprised the Dorothy Zbornak role for a two-part storyline in which she visits the hotel to check up on her mother).

The series ended without a proper series finale. However, it is eventually revealed that following the events of the series, Sophia moves into the Shady Pines retirement home and becomes a cast member on ""Empty Nest"" for the remainder of that series' run. What became of Rose, Blanche and the hotel is left unresolved.

By the spring of 1993, ""Golden Palace"" ranked 58th (with a 9.90 rating). Thouugh this was still good enough (by 1990s standards) for a second season renewal, CBS opted to cancel the series. Reruns aired on Lifetime in the mid-2000s, rotating as a ""final season"" of ""The Golden Girls"". The current USA holders of Golden Girls rerun rights, Hallmark Channel and WE TV, do not include the series in rotation.

****So to complete my review, I think this series should be released... Why? Fans of these ladies have all seven seasons of ""The Golden Girls"" and want this to complete their collection. And why wouldn't a network/DVD company release it to make money? Hello, do you copy networks? I think this series should have been released as the ""Eighth (and final) Season of 'The Golden Girls'"" when the complete series was released.

PLEASE, OH, PLEASE RELEASE THIS ON DVD FOR WE THE FANS TO ADD (AND COMPLETE) OUR COLLECTION!!!!!!",1354579200,11,3444,4.954939341421144
