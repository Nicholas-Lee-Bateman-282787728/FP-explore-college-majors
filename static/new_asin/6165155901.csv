208361,5,6165155901,"I first watched this on Dramafever, and it turned out to be one of the best dramas I have watched, so I had to get the DVD! It portrays a romantic comedy between an alien (Doh Min Joon) who lived on earth for 400 years and a famous actress (Chun Song Yi). The DVD came on time and in great condition. My dvd also came with pictures of all the cast in drama, so that was really nice! The english subtitles are pretty good, but there might be a few minor errors here and there. I highly recommend this drama to anyone who likes romantic comedies or sci-fi!",1409011200,,554,4.138888888888889
208362,5,6165155901,"This show is excellent- the story is thoughtful and imaginative, the cinematography and effects are well done, and the writing is clever and truthful. However what really pushes this series to an exceptional level is the acting. Kim Soo Hyun and Gianna Jun are amazing, their level of onscreen chemistry is rare and they portray an admittedly farfetched story as something honest and touching. The supporting actors are also well cast and believable, the entire ensemble is multidimensional. I recommend this show highly to anyone who enjoys romance and sci-fi.",1408147200,2,561,5.2444444444444445
208363,5,6165155901,"When this show first premiered I watched the first episode but wasn't really too impressed. When most the episodes finally were out, I watched all of them in two day and I was so addicted. I loved all the characters and the show had comedy. Towards the end you really need a box of tissues. This is drama is amazing and it's not that its just popular. It has many of the elements needed in a good show. You will laugh, cry, and want to hug some of them. I will be buying this drama because I love it so much...",1406160000,3,510,4.0594059405940595
208364,5,6165155901,"One of the finest shows I have ever seen, period.  The attention to this show; high ratings, 3 billion+ on-line views in China, etc...is entirely justified.  The strong points include; the writing, music and performances across the board, especially by Gianna Jun in the leading role, she is sensational.  Watching this show will be an experience you'll be excited about sharing with friends and family.

Note; The subtitles were edited poorly in this edition, in my opinion.  Dramafever did a much better job.  Also, one key song at the end of episode 20 is missing (copyright issues?).  Also, the subs move more quickly than they should, so 5 stars for the show, 3 stars for this edition.",1405555200,10,690,4.846153846153846
208365,5,6165155901,"I was waiting anxiously for it to be released to DVD and my favorite Seller timothyng001 got it right away.  I watched it first on Dramafever and had to have the DVD.  This is the official DVD from the production company so it is high quality.  The English subs are excellent.  I'm pretty sure that they are done by Dramafever because they do a lot of the subs for Poh  Kim.

This is the story of an alien that has been living on Earth for 400 hundred years.  Living his life with minimal physical interaction with humans has caused him to lead a very solitary personal life.  He finally is getting the opportunity to go back to his planet, so of course he meets the love of his life to foil his plans. She's a movie celebrity with an interesting personality and family dynamic.  Add some unsolved murders, an insane CEO, lifelong friends, two crazy and deluded stage-moms and other supporting cast to the mix and it rounds out to be an excellent series.  There's also a secondary storyline from the Joseon era that coincides with the present day drama's and is well done by the way it interweaves the two storylines together smoothly.

Although I have paid accounts to several websites to watch Kdramas commercial free, when I find one I really love, I purchase the DVDs.  My Love From The Star was worth adding to my collection.  It made me laugh, cry, shake my fist at the screen and yell at the characters for various different reasons.  I love shows that make you have a physical reaction to them and this one qualifies.  I highly recommend it.",1405468800,22,1549,4.50179211469534
208386,5,6165155901,"Two excellent actors ideally suited for their roles in this funny, sad, and thought-provoking drama. I loved it! The pace of the story was great and the plot unique. I also liked the flashbacks which helped explain the alien's point of view.",1487030400,,241,4.761904761904762

208394,5,6165155901,"Not many films from any nation can successfully combine more than two genres at a time but MY LOVE FROM THE STAR is a stunning exception. In it one sees science fiction, fantasy, romance, dark intrigue, family-centered drama, and even slapstick vaudeville. Director Jang Tae-yoo combined a solid script by Park Ji-eun with totally believable performances by the romantic leads to ensure audience interest over a twenty-one episode run.

  Four centuries ago during the Joseon Dynasty a Korean-looking alien Do Min-joon (Kim Soo-hyun) lands on earth (why we never learn) and immediately saves the life of a fifteen-year old recently widowed princess Cheon Song-yi (Kim Hyun-soo). He uses his alien powers of telekenisis and teleportation to rescue her numeous times. She falls in love with him. Do Min-joon wisely avoids the tricky controversy of pedophilia by remaining platonic at all times. Despite his best efforts, however, her pursuers kill her, thus convincing him of the wisdom of keeping a low profile and avoiding all emotional entanglements. The centuries roll on with Do Min-joon accumulating vast wealth. The viewer gradually learns that he must wait 400 years until he can return to his point of origin. (The ""Star"" of the title)

  Flash forward to modern day Korea. Do Min-joon is a youngish looking college professor who meets by chance what seems to be the reincarnation of the girl-child killed centuries ago. This female also named Cheon Song-yi is a film actress who is fascinated by the aloofness of Do Min-joon who refuses to pay court to her. She falls in love with him and he slowly with her.

  The gradual evolution of their love is but the broader canvas against which MY LOVE FROM THE STAR encompasses a myriad of subordinate themes, genres, and allusions. There is competition for the love of Cheon Song-yi in Lee Hwi-kyung. She refuses him even as he similarly refuses the affection of Cheon Song-yi's rival Yoo Sem-mi. This quadrangle of rivalries is complicated by the evil machinations of Lee Jae-kyung, the older brother of Lee Hwi-kyung.

  Director Jang Tae-yoo uses intermittent flashbacks to provide needed background for the mental evolution of Do Min-joon. This background enables the viewer to obtain the willing suspension of disbelief that might otherwise have intruded. There is no attempt to explain the science of faster-than-light travel, time dilation, anti-aging, and the hero's assorted mental powers. In fact, nearly every time Do Min-joon performs one of his mental marvels, the reactions of wonder and magic of modern day Koreans match precisely those of the Joseon Dynasty.

  As one views the relation of how an alien falls in love with a human, one is reminded of a similarly themed STARMAN. Other allusions and topicalities abound but even if the viewer is not aware of them, the chemistry between the leads is so compelling that the tears shed and joy experienced by Do Min-joon and Cheon Song-yi are replicated in the viewer. MY LOVE FROM THE STAR is a magnificent odyssey into a make-believe world that somehow seems quite believable for all that.",1466899200,2,3107,5.064705882352941

7802831,5,6165155901,"I'm not much of a Rom/com kind of guy, but this is one fantastic drama.

Just like the 90s show Louis and Clark, it's basically a Korean version of Superman with mystery and adventure thrown in.

Does it feel like watching a soap at some parts? Yes. But at least it makes up for those few minutes of melodrama with well written characters, a slow simmering mystery, and a story that is well thought out from beginning to end.

Yeah, the unfortunate removal of some tracks from the broadcast version does suck. But on this disc set they didn't omit the afterstory/extra bits at the end of each episode like I've heard from other box sets of this series.

Trust me, if you're a Superman fan or like a good love story, then you won't be disappointed!",1522800000,,747,4.430656934306569

There was some humor, some mystery, a little supernatural activity going on, due to the nature of the character he portrayed. I guess it goes without saying that if you're from another planet, you have special powers while on the earth. I can't comment about the quality of this video from the manufacturer, because I didn't buy the video.
