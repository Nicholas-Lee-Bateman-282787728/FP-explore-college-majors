What a surprise to find it at Amazon, in the NTSC format, and in ENGLISH! My kids 8 and 13 both love it. It is so different from 'my little pony' and other insipid shows that teach absolutely nothing to our children. Finally something that grows their intellect rather than only entertain. No bread and circus here.
Mohammad, Jesus, Buddha... Who cares really. Let us teach our children to know their history, to think, and be good people. This show just does that. A little dated regarding ethnic and race relations...very French in that regard, but everything is a teaching moment. If you and your kids enjoy 'cosmos' and the like, just like my kids do, this show is for you. Worth every dime!",1428537600,13,842,4.438709677419355
8407036,1,B003VR0BD0,"I watched it as a little kid, so I didn't remember much, watching it with my child now I'm disgusted! Now, I understand this is not a religious history show, but Jesus is mentioned only at the end of one episode (no Christian faith mentioned at all), while Muhammad and Muslim faith gets a whole episode! (Like a detailed lesson in Muslim faith). And appearantly Jesus had no impact on our history but Muhammad was a ""genius"".  Really! I guess I wasted my money.",1427673600,6,462,4.5
