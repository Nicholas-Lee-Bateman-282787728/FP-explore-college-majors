8308099,5,B001H7QCEI,"Got this recently -- two of my grand kids are heading to school in a few days (one to pre-K, one to first grade).  They loved this movie.  I love the Gigi movies, too, for they teach biblical truths weaved into their cute, funny stories.",1376611200,,237,4.2444444444444445
8308100,5,B001H7QCEI,"My 5 year old daughter has all the Gigi and Fancy Nancy books. The two are similar, but Gigi has the added benefit of teaching principles from the Bible. When we found out they made videos, we picked up a couple to see what they were like and we found them to be just as good as the books. I've heard some people complain about the voice actors sounding too annoying or too adult, but the voices have never bothered me and my daughter enjoys the videos. The only drawback is that there aren't that many per DVD. So unlike her Curious George DVDs which have over 2 hours worth of episodes per DVD, you're done with these pretty quick. Wish they'd come out with more!",1370390400,,665,4.285714285714286
8308101,5,B001H7QCEI,"As the other reviewer said, we have LOVED every Gigi movie we've seen! This is great addressing fears that first day of school  can bring. Very down-to-earth and real-life childspeak and family structure which is useful. The biblical truths are strongly echoed in the parents' teaching and encouraging and good examples of children's friendships in and outside of school. We have a first grader and prekindergartener and both love all these movies! highly recommend for your little girls!",1313193600,,488,5.256410256410256
8308102,5,B001H7QCEI,"I have not found a Princess Gigi book or movie that I have not liked. This movie is especially good for kids who might be scared of starting school. The message that ""God is always with you"" helps to calm Gigi's fear. My girls love it. Great gift!",1239667200,,247,4.166666666666667
