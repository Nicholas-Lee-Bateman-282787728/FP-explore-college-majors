5893304,4,B00E6F148M,"At first I thought this movie might have an exclusively insider focus on teen culture and might therefore fall somewhat outside my ken. But I soon became absorbed in the action despite those years being behind me. These teens have a wider variety of interesting personalities than the average teen movie. They have significant interactions with the adult community. Whats more, they're given more of a range of emotion than mere teen petulance over having been forced to buy a non-designer handbag. The lead character faces what has become a critical social problem - having her social networking page hacked.

The popular lead girl of the story, just recently voted President of her class, suddenly finds herself ostracized and preyed upon because of some confidences she presumably betrays and some undermining assessments she presumably posts on her page. Most of her classmates don't believe her protestations that she did NOT post those remarks. But who could have a motive to so viciously turn her from school poster girl to pariah?

At the start of the movie, we are offered a few likely suspects. But some pointed early clues offered up and the format of the DVD itself place one suspect clearly at the forefront of the pack from the start. This movie doesnt depend solely on the Whodunit factor though. Its portrayal of the way in which the girls classmates so readily turn against her, and the insidious ways in which computer hacking can wreak havoc on a life, are interesting features in their own right. Theres a compelling realism to the girls dilemma that held my interest and informed me from the moment I logged onto this DVD.",1384992000,9,1643,4.885304659498208

5893306,2,B00E6F148M,"This showed up on my search of horror added in the last week. Wrong!  I could've gotten into it but there's a reason why I didn't. The movie didn't even try. First, they tell you too much with the title. Why???!!!!! It makes no sense. Then they don't even bother to throw in a couple of plausible red herrings. Also, the ""life is in danger"" is false advertising, intended to make it sound more exciting than it is. More accurately, to make it sound exciting at all, which it is not. With just those 2 adjustments, first being a different, nonspoiler title, it could've been a different experience. A total waste of  money and time.",1406937600,7,631,4.478260869565218

5893313,2,B00E6F148M,"This is a made of TV movie (TV-14) that was titled ""Social Nightmare.""

Cat (Kirsten Prout) is a popular girl who gets told secrets and is on her way to Brown University. Emily (Chloe Bridges) is her BFF who didn't get accepted to Brown. Mom (Daryl Hannah) is her number two BFF and is over protective. Suddenly Emily's world is turned upside down as someone has hacked into her account and posted those secrets as well as launched viscous attacks against other students. This isn't hard to figure out as there are less suspects than a Scooby-Doo episode.

I felt embarrassed watching the film, hoping it wasn't as easy to figure out as it let on. ""Oh Please God, Please please, have a twist, even a stupid one. Make it the father we never saw,  the NNSA, or maybe aliens...anything but...""

The acting was remarkably good for an Asylum film. Unfortunately the plot wasn't.",1386374400,3,873,4.64935064935065
5893314,3,B00E6F148M,"{2.5 stars}

Pretty standard Asylum fare--for a certain taste and mood. Formulaic storyline that's a big rip-off of DISCONNECT and other films about cyber-bullying, flat acting and characterization, stupid script, and a run-of-the-mill clichd portrait of adolescence and high school. The single worst thing about MOTHER, however, is that the cover and title completely destroy what could have been a nice element of surprise.

On a brighter note, there's something about this film that makes it fun to watch if you're in the mood for something mindless and cheesy. Like most Asylum pix, it's effectively unintentionally funny. MOTHER views a bit like a parody of a Lifetime film. Intense, violent, and profane, but no graphic gore or sex/nudity.",1385596800,,745,5.305084745762712

8601991,2,B00E6F148M,"This is actually a Lifetime cable drama that was originally called Social Nightmare.  The schlock label Asylum purchased the home video rights, retitled the film and added a misleading cover to make it look like a horror movie.  It's most definitely not a thriller or horror film.  The story concerns a bright student named Catherine Hardy (Kirsten Prout) who has everything going for her--she has been accepted at her university of choice (Brown) and awarded a full scholarship to boot plus was just elected class president.  Then things start to go horribly wrong.

As the original title suggests it starts off with someone hacking into Catherine's social media account and posting something that offends her best friend.  Then someone makes it appear that Catherine created a nasty website that rates various classmates on the level of their sluttiness and posted it on the school's web server so everyone in class will see it.  Things escalate until Catherine loses all of her friends, is impeached as class president, is kicked out of school and loses her acceptance to Brown.  Catherine keeps insisting that she's innocent and isn't doing any of it but nobody believes her besides her mother.

One obvious problem with calling this movie Mother and putting a picture of Daryl Hannah holding a knife on the cover is that there is never any doubt from the film's earliest scenes who the person is that is wrecking poor Catherine's life.  That makes the film pretty tedious since the audience basically has to wait for about 80 minutes before Catherine figures out what we already know before the movie even starts.  The film's attempts to keep the audience guessing and create possible suspects that could be responsible for the hacking obviously don't work because the fine folks at Asylum already told us who the villain is.

Another problem with the cover and title is that it's wildly misleading.  Daryl Hannah doesn't actually run around with a knife or try to kill anyone during the course of the film.  It's never even the actual movie's intention to portray Daryl Hannah as a dangerous villain--she turns out to be mentally ill but treatable and the movie ends on an upbeat note of hope and reconciliation.  People who watched this on Lifetime under its original title at least had a pretty good idea of what to expect--but the home-video audience looking for a violent thriller will undoubtedly be extremely disappointed.

The only reason this gets more than one star is that it isn't actually a bad thriller since it was never intended to be one in the first place and the acting is pretty solid all around.  But unless you're into cheesy cable dramas you probably want to stay far away from this one.",1501113600,,2715,4.8673913043478265
8601992,2,B00E6F148M,"One of the better Asylum titles as far as acting chops are concerned, but in every other way, a silly TV thriller with an extremely predictable plot twist. Mother will not keep you safe from boredom.

And I'm slick pissed because I don't think I would've guessed it, I would've been surprised at the ending if not for the reviews, however, the title and picture is a spoiler in itself. Still very interesting to watch, if you are entertained by Lifetime/ made for TV movies. If your standards are a bit higher, this might not do it for you.",1434412800,,587,4.653846153846154
