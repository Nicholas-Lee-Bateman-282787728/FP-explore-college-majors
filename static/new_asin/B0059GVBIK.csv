This set is ONLY for those who never saw Harry Langdon and want to get a BRIEF sampling of his work.  His fans will already have excellent copies of these.

Boobs in the Woods (1925, B&W, Silent): Lumberjack Big Bull Reardon catches Chester romancing his girl. He decides to send Chester on a lightning fast final ride down the mountain - tied to a log! Stars Harry Langdon, Marie Astaire, Vernon Dent; Directed by Harry Edwards.

Feet of Mud (1924, B&W, Silent): Newly appointed sanitation officer Harry is cleaning up the streets of Chinatown when he stumbles into the middle of a Tong War. Stars Harry Langdon, Florence D. Lea, Natalie Kingston, Yorke Sherwood, Vernon Dent, Malcolm Waite ; Directed by Harry Edwards.

It is somewhat useless to fans of Harry for Alpha to release these, but if it does introduce Harry to new fans it will be worth it.",1329955200,5,1391,5.631578947368421
