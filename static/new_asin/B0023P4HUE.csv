8349819,1,B0023P4HUE,"""His Girl Friday"" was made in 1940.  Widescreen technology wasn't developed until 1953.  So how is this a widescreen film?  Simple:  the top and bottom of the original 1.37:1 print have been trimmed off.  You are not gettting more of the original picture here; you are getting less.  It's foolish to buy this butchered version in the hope of getting something better than the original.  This thing is a rip-off, plain and simple.",1248134400,6,429,4.794520547945205
