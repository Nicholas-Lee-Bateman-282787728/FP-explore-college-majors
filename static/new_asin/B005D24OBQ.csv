8466258,1,B005D24OBQ,"DVD has a continuous on-screen logo.

This continuous on-screen logo is fairly high up on the screen and is a constant distraction while watching the movie.

For some reason, the movie is split into different parts. About halfway through the film one has to use the remote to select the second half of the movie. In nearly 2000 DVD purchases I have never seen this done before.  The video and audio quality is good.  However, I would postpone a purchase until you can get a version without an on-screen logo.

I completely understand that obscure movies like this may not economically justify pressing a disc.  However, I would have gladly paid a dollar or two more for a disc that would last forever.  Instead, they burned the movie on the old-fashioned, purple dye type disc that are only good for around 5 - 7 years. M-Disc last 100s of years.  (You can burn an M-Disc at home too.)",1428451200,,885,4.556962025316456

8466260,5,B005D24OBQ,"My dad heard something about the Squalus and remembered seeing a film about it in school as a kid. He asked me if I could find that film. Well, I found this for him and then decided to read up on it myself. It happened 20 years before I was even born. Peter Maas wrote about it in the book, The Terrible Hours. It is SO interesting and my dad was really happy that I found this movie for him. That's all that really counts for me!",1404172800,,430,3.954022988505747
8466261,5,B005D24OBQ,I chose this dvd for my husband a ww2  naval veteran. I think he has watched it several times since receiving it.  He is 88 yrs. old now and does not talk about service  too much . I don't think many war veterans do.  He was never on a submarine but I guess it was something he has always wished  he could have joined .,1398211200,,319,3.8461538461538463
8466262,5,B005D24OBQ,"This film is special, it contains imagery of the US Pacific Fleet prior to Pearl Harbor, engaged in a fleet problem in the early 1930's. There is plenty of historic US Naval imagery, some of which is not available elsewhere.  Great close-up images of the McCann rescue chamber, and rare imagery of the New London Escape Training Tower, with footage simulating Momsen lung training. Later, a simulated submarine escape and rescue is carried out; it has been pointed out elsewhere that this motion-picture rescue simulation was just two years before the Squalus casualty and rescue with the McCann chamber.  Great images of the actual Dolphin, which is recognized now as the main predecessor of the later long-range fleet boat (having been launched in March 1932, and commissioned in June of that year as the V-7), and by the time of the film carried the designation D-1. A must-have for the early US submarine enthusiast.",1396656000,,920,4.967532467532467

8466265,5,B005D24OBQ,"Better than I expected, very good historical information.
Sound and picture were very good, as good as or better than the original",1362182400,,130,4.954545454545454
8466266,4,B005D24OBQ,Great old submarine movie.  You can never go wrong with most sub movies.  The story is loosely based upon on a true story.,1361836800,,122,4.260869565217392
