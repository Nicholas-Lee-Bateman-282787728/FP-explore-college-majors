6554518,2,B00M2MTIJS,"Robert Englund, known for his portrayal of scarred slasher Freddy Krueger in the Nightmare on Elm Street films, plays a projectionist who decides to make a Horror film of his own with the only two people who attend a midnight screening in ""The Last Showing"". He is always wonderful the way he fully takes his roles by the horn and embodies them. This film is no exception.  Englund's nuanced performance echoes a confident man masking his madness. Too bad the rest of the 89 minute duration doesn't give him any new ground to work with.

  The other two leads are capable and have a believability about them as potential victims, the cinematography is strong (especially the many colorful shots of the cinema it all takes place at) but we are sure well ahead of time where the film and often feels like it is another entry in the terror sub-genre which borrows too many cues and elements from the Saw franchise.

  That is not to see it is not entertaining on occasion but it plays it to safe and never lets Englund go full-throttle with his role. What is most amusing is the early moments (a sleekly designed opening sequence,  a nod to Nightmare on Elm Street's director Wes Craven and a few courageous statements to the sad fact that theaters are deteriorating due to digital) but it never takes this bravado past the first 15 minutes or so of the film. There are also some statements about how predictable and easy horror films are to make but as the movie progresses it does nothing to prove these prior declarations wrong as it wanders through the motions. The pace, writing and direction of the movie is also of standard issue.

  I believe the filmmakers have the ambition to make a clever film. Many of the fundamental factors of such are here on display. But, there is just not enough originality on the screen to make this happen. Perhaps the writer and director will dig a little bit further to the bank of new ideas and take the spark that made the first 15 minutes of this so interesting and run with it through an entire feature but as it is that's not the case with, ""The Last Showing.""",1417737600,2,2102,4.534391534391534
6554519,5,B00M2MTIJS,"The Last Showing isn't a horror film. It's more like a thriller, a very clever, bizarre thriller, and it kept me guessing the whole time; I never saw the end coming. The story was one surprise after the other. Robert Englund's performance was incredible; he conveyed Stuart's bitterness and fragile mental state in a truly poignant and convincing way. Sometimes, the film had an eeriness to it that almost reminded me of The Shining: the theater felt like the Overlook Hotel, haunted by Stuart's ghost-like presence, beset by his increasingly baffling, absurd motivations. I can't recommend it enough. It was fascinating. Don't stop the film when the credits start rolling, or you'll miss one of the best and most mind-bending parts!",1417046400,4,733,5.066115702479339

6554521,3,B00M2MTIJS,"Very nice. I have always been pretty shy of Robert Englund. I just loathe Freddy Kruger and though I loved the RE in V, he's made some AWFUL project choices, such as Strippers Vs. Zombies or Zombies Vs Strippers or whichever one he was in. But this was good. Solid. Not knock your socks off, but good.",1413590400,,301,4.298245614035087
6554522,3,B00M2MTIJS,"The film has a good opening. Red and white letter fonts, translucent green tinting and Robert Englund. We discover Stuart (Englund) works at a cineplex. He is dissatisfied with his boss and viewers. Allie (Emily Berrington) wants to go to the midnight showing of ""Hills Have Eyes 2"" and then give her boyfriend (Finn Jones) something special. A girl after my heart, but he is moody about it.

The boss (Malachi Kirby) and our twosome become the reluctant actors in a carefully orchestrated film, under the watchful eye and control of Stuart as he reads the main events off 3X5 cards.

This is a decent film. Certainly worth a rental for horror fans. Light on characters.

Parental Guide; F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1412121600,2,713,4.780487804878049
