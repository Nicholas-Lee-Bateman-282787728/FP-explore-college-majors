6401959,2,B00K3245AQ,Animation was okay but at times a bit creepy for younger children. The story was a bit too slow for the younger kids and the overall feel was that of a B movie attempt at best. I wouldn't waste any time trying to watch it again.,1406764800,,228,3.9782608695652173
6401960,1,B00K3245AQ,"Come on now, the trailer sucked so bad that I didn't even want to watch it even if it was FREE. Tarzan (1999) from Disney did a better job and that was 15 years ago. 15 YEARS AGO...LMAO! Yes I said it.",1406505600,2,201,3.8095238095238093

6401963,3,B00K3245AQ,"If you take this movie for what it is and turn your brain off, it's quite enjoyable.  The people look like barbies, but the model of Tarzan is actually not bad and filled with subtle details.  The scars and dirt were well-done and his hair is lovely enough to be in any shampoo commercial.  Certain things made this version a nice change from others, like how he was a little older (about kindergarten age) when he was adopted by his ape-mommy, which is why he picks up english again rather easily.  Also, it was nice that it got a modern make-over and a different story and reason to protect the jungle, blah blah.  That's where the niceties end, unfortunately.  The narrator assumes everyone is stupid and explains EVERYTHING.  Sure, it was nice that it didn't have the gorillas speaking english, but does he really need to explain what we're seeing on screen?  Also, the meteor was in the most obvious place in the world, a blind person could have located it.  (Oh, let's just look everywhere but near the volcano where there is this MASSIVE rock formation that you could see from space... oh wait, let's not look there because there's a little fog...)  Also, I need to find myself some of those leaves that they chew up and put on wounds because apparently they're a miracle cure for everything from snake bites to gunshot wounds...
It has it's cheesy moments that make you want to cringe, but what kid's movie doesn't?  Overall, I would say it wasn't bad and parts were enjoyable.  The music was nice (How did they get Coldplay to sign off on this??) and the scenery was pretty despite being slightly dated.  I watched this on my computer in standard definition though, so maybe that's why it didn't bother me as much as some people.",1405900800,,1738,4.585760517799352
6401964,5,B00K3245AQ,"This is so amazing.  One of those cartoons that looks beyond real...better than real.  The story of Tarzan is not EXACTLY as we have all read it to be, but still, very fun!  I absolutely loved it and it should have more stars.",1405814400,,226,4.209302325581396
6401965,1,B00K3245AQ,I don't understand why they can't just do the story from the book. No one has done it right so far. Tarzan is a legend because of the book. I can not judge this movie as a work on its own. Stop making Tarzan for kids.,1405555200,7,217,3.739130434782609
6401966,5,B00K3245AQ,I AM A TARZAN BUFF AND ANYTHING TARZAN I WATCH. BUT SURPRISINGLY IT IS GOOD OVERALL. LOVE THE ANIMATION.,1405555200,3,104,4.526315789473684
6401967,3,B00K3245AQ,"The film starts out with a meteor destroying the dinosaurs and in 20 minutes takes us to Tarzan with the apes. Jane enters the picture shorty thereafter. It seems this meteor has some sort of power or energy. It also has it own ecosystem unique to the rest of the planet. Jane is with the bad guys who want to take over meteor land. They want to kill Tarzan, because he is a Greystoke. Tarzan saves Jane's life ad infinitum until she falls in love and makes this into a a young girl chick flick with our Barbie doll unable to fend for herself, relying on the big muscled man for everything.

I liked the idea of combining Tarzan with a new animated world. The problem is that they didn't do enough mindless new world, new life animation. I hate to say this, but they spent too much time developing the story, making sure to include every Tarzan nuance. Kellan Lutz as the voice of Tarzan didn't make it and where was his hand when he said, ""You Jane?""

There was too much narration in the first 20 minutes of the film that wasn't needed. The voice was annoying too.",1404950400,23,1065,4.32
6401968,2,B00K3245AQ,"Exactly what you would expect from a B movie. Too many serendipitous circumstances, unrealistic action sequences, plot holes, unnecessary story lines, disgusting dialogue, bizarre love story, ripped off and overplayed jokes.

6402002,2,B00K3245AQ,"Though I can easily appreciate the animation work, as it had it's weak moments but overall was well done and had a good look I could not let the story change go.  I am all for artistic take on things but this story went from a believable (in a fantasy world) to a space rock that gives power. I couldn't grasp how this was passed in pre-production to be honest.  I did enjoy the movie, but I feel pretty strongly that is just because I am biased toward CGI and they did that part really well, but I lost a lot of enjoyment just knowing behind the jungle story it was all about a meteor.

I'll grant, they did at least put a lot of the screen focus on Tarzan, Jane, and the jungle but the cuts back to discussing a space rock really snaps you back out of the world of Tarzan and reminds you this was some how morphed into an odd sci-fi.

The finale showed how much even the director wasn't ""feeling"" this as when it did build up to the point of Tarzan and Jane having to fight for their lives at the meteor site it was a very short segment and the bad guy in the movie was killed (assumed) in a very anti-climatic way and was done so in a fashion that seemed a farce.

Pros:
Not the best I've seen but fantastic visuals for what the movie was made for

Cons:
Story adaptation was extremely far from the original
Directing was, at many times, jumping from one point to another
Any sequence that was meant to be a big part (such as a fight or battle) was very short and had no emotional value",1485820800,3,1489,4.099656357388316
6402003,1,B00K3245AQ,"Most important fact is how they changed the story line. Now the younger generation won't be able to enjoy the humor and the roller coaster of emotion that this movie used to display. By the way, his running animation was pathetic.",1485820800,,230,4.634146341463414

6402037,2,B00K3245AQ,I didn't care for this version. It is a cheesy looking animated movie. The story line is strange and not at all like the other Tarzans. The movie starts out with a meteor crashing on earth millions of years ago and it has an energy or life force. I won't ruin the plot but Tarzan's dad breaks a piece of the meteorite of and it gets mad at him and lashes out. It's not a good movie but if you have nothing better to do it's better than twiddling your thumbs.,1484870400,2,458,4.043956043956044

6402113,4,B00K3245AQ,"Some barriers I needed to clear in order to rate this movie with objectively.  First, the other worldly new premise, distinctions from traditions,  and the animation style itself, once I started to follow this unbelievable series of coincidences and happenstance, the pacing and action and sights, sounds and scenes are became blended together, where I found myself thinking I'm watching somewhat of an abstract live action film.

6402140,1,B00K3245AQ,It's a cartoon. The artwork was childish and the theme was awful. No one can jump off of a 100 foot cliff and grab a branch and spin around 3 times and fall another 100 feet and grab a vine and swing across a river and land exactly where they want to be.

6402289,4,B00K3245AQ,"The animation is without a doubt, magnificent in part.  Contrasting with the incredibly detailed images of characters and places in the foreground however, occasionally, the viewer can see a flatness of background, making it look like live actors videoed against a painted stage backdrop.
The animation works most effectively when portraying  the main character, Tarzan, loping along and playing with his gorilla ""family"".

The story line is weak, serving to tie various scenic episodes together.  But the movie held our interest enough to see it through to complrtion.",1478217600,,569,5.431818181818182

I was really surprised it was not the original story of Tarzan. I don't want to give spoilers, but to those thinking its about the original Tarzan, it is not... Its basically about a boy who like you and me adores the story of Tarzan and pretends he is Tarzan. He loses his parents tragically, therefore causing him to a be orphan trapped in the jungle. This leads to him being raised by the apes in the jungle. Anyway, I was slightly disappointed but although there were those issues with the movie, I still really enjoyed the movie! It had a great story plot, great cast, wonderful animation and the music was pretty epic! I think they did a really fantastic job with the film! It would be cool if they can also create a tv show or movie about the original Tarzan! I give them 5 stars for this movie! I really, really and truly loved this film!

6402673,2,B00K3245AQ,"My kiddos that are 8 and over realized that the movie focused a lot on the scientific process (which is cool), and they enjoyed that. Super unique perspective on how Tarzan came to be. The things I didn't appreciate that, quite honestly, colored my view of the whole movie:
1. Violence:
A gorilla was murdered by another gorilla after being shown mercy. This isn't accurate on so many levels, and for what?)
Parents killed in a terrible plane crash
People tied up in a mountain that is going to explode
2. Emotional distress:
Kid is promised his parents would NEVER leave him in the jungle (why was this promise even given?)
Baby gorilla falls off the edge of cliff (for NO reason!)
Scientist walks into a cave, after having to make an emergency exit from another location (kid and wife are already scared), without batting an eye. It's my job...I'm an explorer...I have to do this.
3. Military made to look bad
Men in military uniforms, along side heavy set, gun wielding people, following the orders of a person trying to blow up the mountain.
4. Parental disrespect
Teen age kids are talking and acting completely rude to their parents and other adults, for no apparent reason.",1473206400,,1180,4.705314009661835

6402732,4,B00K3245AQ,"For an animated adaptation of the story of Tarzan it was pretty good.

The let down was the story.  I'm not quite sure I care for the modern twist, but I understand the desire to find a new way of telling the story.  In any event, the story as a whole was very cliche.  If it weren't for the sub-plots of Tarzan's family and Jane, it wouldn't have been worth watching.",1472515200,,553,4.5353535353535355

8655611,4,B00K3245AQ,"Im glad to see so many positive reviews for this movie.  When it came out it seemed that everyone hated it.  True, this is not The Tarzan story that Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote.  But is a fun re-imagining of that story.  I am a life-long Tarzan fan and at 70 I have seen all the movies that are available and the TV shows too.  I always try to find the good in every one of them.  Except for the terrible recent series on Netflix I usually find something to enjoy.  This movie was beautiful to watch.  Loved the use of Parkour as Tarzan moved through the jungle. This is a great movie for kids too.",1506729600,2,597,4.130434782608695

Although I didn't watch the whole movie with her, I walked in as a female character was saying,  ""like he!! I will."" Admittedly, I use foul language often, but never around my kid; I also have a rather conservative view when it comes to language that kids use these days.  I don't like to hear ""butt,"" ""booty"" ""fart"" and other mild words come from my child. For what it's worth...",1501804800,,479,4.494252873563219

8655615,4,B00K3245AQ,"I was surprised how much I enjoyed this. Had never heard of it, so was expecting a straight-to-dvd-quality time killer. Instead the animation was good, the storyline was a decent modernization, and the story kept me till the end. I did not watch with children, so don't know what their take might be. A solid animated film.",1499990400,,323,4.684210526315789
