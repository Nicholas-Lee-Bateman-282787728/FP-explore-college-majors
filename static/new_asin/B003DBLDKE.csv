4111748,5,B003DBLDKE,I HAVE OVER 10 WIGGLES DVD AND I BELIEVE THIS ONE IS MY FAVORITE. AND MY KIDS JUST LOVE IT. IT HAS OVER 40 SONGS AND ITS GREAT TO SEE THEM DANCE AROUND FOR AND HOUR & A HALF THUMBS UP TO THIS,1288137600,,191,3.4651162790697674
4111749,5,B003DBLDKE,"My almost 2 year old is a Wiggles addict.  Unfortunately, we never seem to catch the show when it is playing on TV and have been watching the On Demand episodes via our cable company.  Sadly, the shows don't update that often and I got tired of watching the same 3 episodes over and over for 2 months at a time, not only that, but each posted episode is only 15 minutes long!  My solution was to order this video, which is made up of only the songs, my sons favorite part of the show.

We just received this DVD today and have only watched about 1/3 of it, but my son (and I) loved every moment!  We started dancing the moment it started and didn't stop dancing until I had to turn it off and get him calmed down for nap time.  And let me tell you, I was so tired after all that dancing I needed a nap myself!  Those Wiggles are in some crazy good shape and if I have to do this on a daily basis I soon will be also.

If your kid loves The Wiggles I highly recommend this DVD.

***Warning*** These songs are EXTREMELY catchy and will get stuck in your head....for DAYS.  I have been listening to the ""Hot Potato"" song via my inner radio all frigging afternoon, lol.",1286582400,,1165,4.092511013215859
4111750,4,B003DBLDKE,"Th evideo is excellent my son loves the wiggles he dances with it , claps, and he can sit and watck it for over 30 miN !!! RECORD TIME ! The only problem of course he doesnt notice is the sound quality !!! The volume goes up and down and its really bad ! This must be because its an old production. Besides it its a good video for kids.",1284940800,2,336,3.8142857142857145
4111751,5,B003DBLDKE,"By far this is the best children's DVD out there.  My 1 year old received this gift from her Uncle for her first birthday, and from the very first time we played it, she's been hooked.  Not many things will capture a 1 year old's attention for more than 5 minutes, however, when we play this video she will watch it from beginning to end.  My husband, who dislikes most children's videos, will even sit and watch The Best of The Wiggles with her.  The DVD is full of fun, Wiggly songs.  You are guaranteed to wake up each morning with a Wiggles song in your head.  A must DVD for any child's collection.",1282953600,27,603,4.245614035087719
4111752,5,B003DBLDKE,"This quite frankly, is the best money I have spent in probably the past year! :) My son is a Wiggle nut and while we are very strict with tv time because he is so young, we do allow some Wiggles. This DVD is just wonderful! It is all music and you can watch it straight through or use the ""jukebox"" menu, which allows you to choose a song from the list and watch it over and over and over. (As we are doing right now with the ""Monkey Song"") The songs are done slow enough that he understands what is going on and there are always some kind of physical movements that he loves to immitate. The songs are all taken from past Wiggle DVDs and you can tell because sometimes they look sooo young! While the Wiggles, at times, drive me nuts and I find myself singing ""Rock-a-bye Your Bear"" at work, to watch him sing and dance to it is worth it! I hope your children enjoy it as much as my son does!! :)",1282780800,,897,4.044943820224719
4111753,5,B003DBLDKE,"My kid watches this DVD almost every morning. The DVD menu is easy enough to navigate, but when watching the main feature, each song's title will pop up from the bottom and take up a large portion of the screen for several seconds, which is a bit annoying, but I suppose it's a minor annoyance.",1282608000,3,294,4.363636363636363
4111754,5,B003DBLDKE,"I bought this item as a gift for my friend's 2 year old daughter. Despite having to go days with ""Fruit Salad, yummy yummy"" stuck in their heads, my friend and her husband love it because their daughter loves it. Another thing I love about this DVD is that it has both Greg and Sam in it. Greg was wonderful but Sam was the most excellent replacement.",1282521600,,351,4.253731343283582
4111755,4,B003DBLDKE,"This DVD selects one or two videos from each prior DVD - even back to the early 1990s - and identifies what DVD they are from.  Not sure all their selections are truly ""best of"" (who really thinks ""Here Comes a Chicken"" warrants inclusion?) but it is a great DVD for introducing The Wiggles' music to kids who have not seen it.  My kids, who have all the prior DVDs, still love to watch it.  The extras are interesting (mostly interviews, very early videos, and videos in other languages).  My kids love the early videos and the ones in other languages.",1282348800,,553,4.445544554455446
4111756,5,B003DBLDKE,This dvd had all of my 23 month old's favorite songs and is so much fun for us to dance to together!!  I highly recommend this for families with Wiggles fans! :),1280102400,,161,4.03125

4111758,5,B003DBLDKE,"My best friend has a daughter that is almost 16 yrs old now.  She is like a daughter to me!  One of her all time favorite shows when she was little was ""The Wiggles"".  I remember the good ol' days!

I now have a son of my own that is almost 2 yrs old now.  I wondered...""Would he like the Wiggles""?  They are not on the air anymore (that I'm aware of).  I couldn't seem to find any of ""The Wiggles"" anywhere.  I thought...well...I will check on Amazon...surely they will have some of the old videos that you can purchase.  Amazon seems to never fail when you are looking for something that you need/want to buy!  Here it is...a video of ""The Wiggles""!

I am SO thankful!  My son is very very active!  It is hard for him to sit still for 5 minutes.  Let me tell you...not anymore!  He begs to watch the Wiggles!  He LOVES them!  I'm SO very happy that you can still purchase some of the old DVD's!  This was a hit 16 yrs ago...and appears to still be a hit for the kiddo's today!!!

I would recommend anyone with children (even if they won't sit still) to buy a ""Wiggles"" dvd.  They will be very thankful they did!  I'm SO very happy to have been able to find this...and we watch it all of the time!!!",1474588800,,1200,4.108225108225108

Money hoes and clothes all a Wiggle knows

4111793,5,B003DBLDKE,"My son adores the Wiggles, in their original lineup, so much that when he first started talking, he sort of had an Australian accent from trying to say things as the Wiggles said them. Suffice to say, this DVD, which is a collection of music videos of his favorite Wiggles Greatest Hits CD, can keep him at rapt attention for quite a while. Best of all, since so much of the Wiggles' material is interactive with little dances and such, my son and I have had many a fun Wiggles Dance Party, watching the video and dancing along. I have a strong feeling that 16 years from now, when he's off at college, I'll unearth this DVD during a spring cleaning session and spend an afternoon weeping over ""Rock-A-Bye Your Bear"" and reminiscing about how sick of ""The Monkey Dance"" I was back in 2014.",1411603200,2,789,4.448275862068965

4111805,4,B003DBLDKE,"It's almost every single Wiggles song I could want. Although the songs were not played in chronological order, it didn't bother me. What did bother me is the poor quality. I know most of the clips were from the mid to late 90's before HD was a thing, but even the HD segments were not in HD! Whether its on the computer or on the TV, it always looks like a creation sculpted in Minecraft. Still a good DVD, though. You get your money's worth.",1400457600,,442,4.211764705882353

So this DVD changed everything... he watches it 2x a day!!! Everyday!! And I love it too, it has me putting my chores aside to watch it!!

Since I loved the Wiggles when my now 7-year old was a baby, I thought this BEST OF dvd would be a good choice. I'm glad I bought it.!!! I remember and love Greg Page, and I am glad this DVD has a lot of the old songs and performances I remember and it while incorporating the new music quite well with Sam Moran. I don't know what the 'bad reviewer was speaking of when she said it had too many Sam performances. There are 37 songs (including the bonus features) and 11 of them are Sam.

8394754,5,B003DBLDKE,"I absolutely hate The Wiggles. Their songs drive me up the wall on a daily basis, they get stuck in your head so easily and the more you hear them the worse they become. So why do I give it 5 stars? I don't.... but my 1 year old son does. He loves these guys, and girl... and can't get enough of them. So I figure it would be unfair to say these people are 1 star when children all over the world absolutely love them. But I want to make it clear... they get a 5 star from my one year old, not me. I CAN'T STAND THEM. lol",1485129600,,521,3.7454545454545456
