8598432,4,B00DVS9QWQ,"We LOVE Buddy Davis' adventures! Our boys (7 and 5) and girls (3 and 1) alike enjoy their whole collection. When this new title was released, we bought it as soon as possible. I have to say though, Alaska was a bit of a disappointment. At only 25 minutes, it's one of the shortest of the Amazing Adventures series (the two prior ones, Swamp Man and Extreme Caving were each 45 minutes). We were quite surprised when the film started wrapping up as it seemed it had just started! It also wasn't quite as adventurous as the prior two, consisting more of factoids about Alaska and the animals there. Don't get me wrong - it's a great film. It just fell a bit short of our expectations based on how awesome Swamp Man and Extreme Caving are. I still highly recommend it, and the kiddos love it. Looking forward to future adventures!",1467331200,2,827,4.447368421052632
8598433,5,B00DVS9QWQ,"Our kids (ages 6 and 4), and yes, I'll admit it, all the rest of us, LOVE these. If you are looking for fun, educational, inspiring videos that approach geology and adventure from a Christian perspective, you will love these too. Buddy seamlessly weaves in Biblical teaching with science and adventure. Add in the great music throughout, and it's a winner in our family. Bought a 4 pack, and we'd review all of them the same.",1450224000,,425,4.605263157894737
8598434,5,B00DVS9QWQ,"I'm much younger and probably more fit than Buddy and I certainly would not attempt this. Buddy Davis is awesome, he glorifies God and shows you some pretty amazing things! I wish he would make more movies, just crank them out, we'd buy them all!",1391040000,,246,4.488888888888889
8598435,5,B00DVS9QWQ,If your children (especially boys) love adventure and the idea of crawling around making great discoveries then this video will hold their imagination for a long time. This is an excellently done video with humor and great science that supports Creation. We love it!,1389312000,2,266,5.068181818181818
