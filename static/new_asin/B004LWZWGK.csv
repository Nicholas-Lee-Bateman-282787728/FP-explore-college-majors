4412511,5,B004LWZWGK,"**Spoilers Below**
This movie is really hard to put into words really. The amount of different emotions I felt during the movie almost brought me to tears. Christopher Nolan has done it again. First I'll go through the new actors/characters and how I felt about them: I've never ""loved"" Anne Hathaway but she a fine job as Selina Kyle/Catwoman. Her personality and attitude were spot on. Tom Hardy as Bane was just flat out awesome. He was such a brute yet he was so evil and intimidating. I think the creepy voice helped, too. It's not Heath Ledger/Joker level, but pretty darn close. Marion Cotillard was great as Miranda Tate/Talia al Ghul as well. Out of all the new actors, I honestly loved Joseph Gordon-Levitt as John Blake the most. He impressed me very much. He was an integral character in the movie and you could say he was practically Batman's sidekick (hint, hint). Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, and Morgan Freeman are great as always.

The length of the movie might bother some people, as it runs for about 2 hours and 45 minutes,but it didn't bother me at all. The pacing was good and there was never too much action or never really any meaningless scenes of dialogue. The plot was interesting, emotional, suspenseful and engaging. You could almost say this was more of a sequel to Batman Begins than The Dark Knight due to the major tie-ins of the League of Shadows and Ra's al Ghul. Harvey Dent is mentioned throughout the movie as well and is used very well in relation to the plot, in my opinion. This film is packed with to the brim with emotion. Whether I was seeing Batman/Bruce Wayne struggling to climb out of the prison, Bane taking over the city and having all the people in panic and fear, or Alfred leaving Bruce I definitely felt what most people feel when you watch great moments in great movies.

What I've always loved about the Christopher Nolan Batman movies is that you don't have to like Batman to like these movies. I am, however, a big Batman fan. The sense of realism, intelligence, fear, sadness, struggle and action that permeate throughout these movies is just impossible to ignore and should be embraced by all movie lovers. In 1997 Batman & Robin almost killed Batman off forever in the realm of films. Christopher Nolan brought it back with Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises over the period of seven years and they will never be forgotten. Greatest Trilogy Ever? Greatest Trilogy Ever.

4412512,5,B004LWZWGK,"not only has TDKR successfully avoided the 3rd movie curse, it has exceeded my expectations in every way and surpassed batman begins and stands on equal footing with the dark knight.

bane is a brutal monster and is completely different from the joker. he is huge, and he is a genius. he is one of the best parts of the movie

catwoman is also an amazing character in the movie, her deviousness and ferocity as a fighter is fantastic to watch. her dynamic with bruce/batman is perfect

the ending is perfect, exceeding my expectations in every way and concluding one of the best trilogies ever with one of the most satisfying endings ever",1342742400,3,638,4.628318584070796
4412513,5,B004LWZWGK,"The movie the Dark Knight Rises is a thrilling conclusion to this iteration of Batman. Carried by a thunderous and swelling score by Hans Zimmer, the movie envelops you in Gotham during the peculiar peace. Batman, once again played by Christian Bale, is in the shadows. Without telling too much the antagonist, Bane, played by a terrific Tom Hardy, starts a war. There are many political undertones as well as economic realities that permeate the storyline. However you don't have time to consider them seriously due to the eye candy and mystery of Gotham. The Dark Knight Rises was truly entertaining and our theater was packed. We were one of 10 theaters showing at midnight. Dark Knight purist will not be disappointed. You will also be reminded that Batman is human, but that is not a weakness. Thankfully it's not in 3-D. I would categorize this as a sci-fi thriller. Spend your money... You won't be disappointed. It's Batman and Catwoman and... Enjoy!",1342742400,5,958,4.883435582822086
4412514,5,B004LWZWGK,"Having just watched the Cinema release of the""Dark Knight Rises"" as well as numerous Blu Ray sessions with the previous Batman movies, I am convinced that the Nolan's wanted to portray Batman as a more ""flesh and blood"" hero than in their prevous outings - and they have succeeded !

While there is every bit as much action/reaction and plot twists as before, it all comes down to Bruce Wayne/Batman being able to put a more ""human"" perspective into the story, that really gets the viewer involved in this movie.

I can't recommend this movie to everyone that wanted a ""comic book"" outcome to the finale, however I would highly recommend seeing this if you wanted a more  heroic / human  aspect to the movie, that shows how a ""real"" person would be if they were Batman - we all want the same things.",1342656000,3,799,4.527777777777778
4412515,5,B004LWZWGK,"Christopher Nolan faced a seemingly insurmountable uphill battle with The Dark Knight Rises. Ignoring for a moment our sky high expectations, The Dark Knight trilogy faced the deadly ""third movie"" curse, which has sunk so many otherwise great franchises. In the crowded superhero landscape, where The Avengers can make over $1B in just a couple of months, Nolan's movies are in such a unique, singular place that they don't have to compete with Marvel and their shared universe. His biggest competition is with his own, well-established greatness that has sent our hopes for the finale soaring.

With those expectations comes the realization that ""sticking the landing"" is the hardest part of every trilogy, but if there's anyone who could shatter that trend it would be Nolan. While it was clear that he was still finding his footing with Batman Begins, Nolan's confident clarity of vision took hold in The Dark Knight, and sharpened to laser precision in The Dark Knight Rises. We've never seen an epic hero's journey quite like this before. The Dark Knight trilogy breaks beyond the confines of the traditional superhero movie into something unrecognizable; thrilling in the way you know something truly special is unfolding right before your eyes. For good reason, many will enter into this film thinking Nolan could never best the spectacular heights of The Dark Knight, but those people will exit The Dark Knight Rises with their minds blown and a totally new outlook.

It's best to look at The Dark Knight trilogy as one complete story, and in that sense the events of the previous film hang heavy over Gotham City. Nolan's movies have always been about legacy, and in this case the legacy of two men continues to loom: the Joker, and District Attorney Harvey Dent. It's now eight years since Batman willingly took the blame for Dent's crimes, saving Gotham from learning the truth of his crashing fall from grace. In the wake of the Joker's rampage, new laws have been enacted that have essentially cleaned the crime-ridden city up, with Batman not having been seen in years. Looking more world weary than ever, Commissioner Jim Gordon(Gary Oldman) knows the truth. That the peace is just a mirage, built on a mountain of lies and deception.

Others see Gotham's peace in a different light. The city's wealthy have only grown more insulated over the years, the wealth disparity widening as the poor continue to struggle. There may not be people dying in the streets anymore, but Gotham's corruption continues to eat away at it from the inside, and certain parties are looking to exploit the plight of the downtrodden to their advantage.  Yeah, this is Nolan's most overtly political film yet, shining a spotlight on much of the anger that festers in today's society, where the rich get all the breaks and the poor just....break. Bane(Tom Hardy), a masked, hulking figure seeks to harness that rage against the top 1%, and burn Gotham City to ashes.

Where's Bruce Wayne during all this? Holed up in his study like Howard Hughes(minus the urine jars), more of a myth than an actual man at this point. Broken down and beaten both physically and emotionally, he's a shadow of his former self. The indomitable will that seemed to radiate from him at all times is gone, leaving only a shell. It's only when his home is broken in to by a sleek and sexy cat burglar named Selina Kyle(Anne Hathaway), that he begins to feel inklings of the old curiosity again. That detective spirit starts to emerge as he checks into her background, discovering that his old enemies, the League of Shadows, may be alive and well and in Gotham City.

Rare is the film that can take you on a roller coaster of emotions quite the way The Dark Knight Rises does, and it's safe to say you'll probably cry a couple of times, while also feeling the exhilaration of Nolan's epic direction. The film has a larger than life scope from the very beginning, kicking off with a breathtaking aerial hijacking that puts the latest Mission: Impossible to shame. Batman's conscience, the heart and soul of the Caped Crusader, has always been his loyal butler and caretaker, Alfred(Michael Caine), but this story sees them reaching a heartbreaking impasse. It's the natural evolution of their relationship, and watching it unfold is probably the toughest part of the film, even worse than watching Batman get beaten to a bloody pulp.

And get beaten like a dog Batman surely does. Bane poses a threat the likes of which Batman has never seen. The Scarecrow was merely a psychological threat, while the Joker was lunatic id run amok. Bane is as coolly confident and unafraid as Batman ever was, and is superior in every way physically. More than that, he's equipped with a similar fanatical purity of his beliefs, which strengthens him and inspires others to die for his cause. Batman's visage, created to inspire fear in his enemies, has also become a rallying point of sorts, most notable to Thomas Blake(Joseph Gordon-Levitt), an altruistic cop who joins the fight to save Gotham. Miranda Tate(Marion Cotillard), inspired by Bruce Wayne's philanthropic notions, seeks to join him in a secret energy project that has gained Bane's unwanted attention.

Bale's performance as Batman has always bothered me in that it never quite measures up to that of his co-stars. He was woefully overmatched by Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight, to the point where that film felt smaller when the Joker wasn't on screen. Here, Bale gives what I think is his best turn of the series yet, portraying Bruce Wayne as a guy who is still bound by his family legacy. He's still endeavoring to measure up to his father. Despite all the suits and weapons and fancy vehicles, Bruce Wayne is still the kid who stood helplessly by while his parents were murdered. Those who saw Tom Hardy in the MMA flick, Warrior, know the terrifying volatility he can bring, and he does much the same here. Only what makes Bane even scarier is his nonchalant attitude, and the fact you can only understand about half of what he's saying.  Hathaway doesn't get enough to work with to surpass Michelle Pfeiffer's iconic performance as Catwoman, but she's got the sultry and conflicted character down to a tee. Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Marion Cotillard are all typically outstanding, but I think people will be mostly surprised by how well Joseph Gordon-Levitt steps into the big leagues here.

Clocking in at roughly 2 hours and 45 minutes, you never feel for a second that the film is dragging along or being padded out to fill time. Every scene that Nolan leaves in is essential, even as he diverts some of his attention to the subplots of the supporting characters. Every one has their natural arc, fully realized and having a major impact on the final battle. Nolan ups the ante in just about every respect, ramping up the stakes to an incredible degree, and plunging Batman into the depths of despair. There's no need to be a comic book fan to understand the redemptive quest Batman faces, or to appreciate the numerous other themes Nolan has seamlessly weaved into the story. It's always been about what drives the man in the suit, not how the suit drives the man.

As the bittersweet final minutes began to creep up, it was impossible not to start thinking about the legacy Christopher Nolan is leaving behind.  Nobody has left their stamp on a character quite like this. Certainly not Tim Burton or Joel Schumacher and their candy colored circus versions. Nolan has taken one of the most iconic characters in pop culture history, and totally redefined him in a way that nobody will be able to touch it. Certainly, others will try, but it will be a long time from now in order to escape from Nolan's shadow.  In the most simple terms, Christopher Nolan has crafted the best Batman story ever told.",1342569600,8,7846,4.815887156644395

Below there are MOVIE SPOILERS. This review was written before the release of the actual film, but all content has been proven correct. MASSIVE SPOILER ALERT!!

Batman gets crippled by Bane, but he later makes a comeback and retrains himself to be Batman. Gordon (now mayor of Gotham) gets shot but survives also. At first, Selina Kyle (aka Catwoman) is bad, but she eventually becomes Batman's comrade and she actually kills Bane. Lucius Fox lives also. Come to find out, Ra's al Ghul's daughter, Talia al Ghul, and Bane have taken over the League of Shadows and plan to complete Talia's father's plans by destroying Gotham. The reason Talia and Bane are such good friends is because Bane had, years before, aided her in escaping a huge foreign prison. At first, Bane succeeds: he traps the Gotham City Police Force underground in a violent series of explosions; he puts the rich and powerful on a trial which is presided by Jonathan Crane (aka the scarecrow). The US tries to sneak Special Forces into Gotham disguised as workers, but Bane and his men stop them and hang them from a bridge. Then, Batman escapes the prison bane put him in; he returns to Gotham and fights Talia in trying to stop a nuclear-type bomb from destroying the city. He succeeds, but he is apparently killed in the explosion as he pilots the plane away from Gotham. At the end, Gordon sees Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle in a Paris coffee shop.",1340841600,3,1430,4.670634920634921
4412517,5,B004LWZWGK,"A Brilliant presentation with a different but dramatic story as Batman faces many problems. The mood is dark and dismal when Batman is taken on a special mission to fight crime that has gotten out of control as a city is about to Fall. Acting is Excellent, the images are Superb as they blend with the gloomy mood and fear of total destruction. Good story, entertaining from start to finish as it grabs your attention in the very beginning. Highly Recommended!",1340668800,6,460,4.691358024691358
4412518,5,B004LWZWGK,"I completeltly disagree with the previous review. Yes chris nolan changed many things about batman, but what he stayed true to was the fact that batman was more on the lines of the comicsbthe dark knight which were dark, and very little humor. He made the characters intense and truly gives the feeling that batman is over his head, dealing with a city literally about to crumble. He made batman dark, and more realistic. Putting these criminal masterminds as masters of different mobs or in charge of asylum thugs, is a brilliant way if infiltrating gothams legal systems and to truly take down a city.",1340582400,3,603,4.752380952380952
4412519,1,B004LWZWGK,"The three main problems with this film and the rest of the series are 1. it is an awful adaption of Batman in which the people in charge of these films obviously did not like the comic books and it is highly doubtful that they actually read the comic books 2. live action comic book films do not work because human beings and physics cannot perform actions that are depicted in the comic books, and 3. the animated films being released by DC Universe Animated Original Movies company make this Batman series and other live action films look very boring.
  I do not understand the praise for Christopher Nolan because he is not that good of a director for this series. He does not film shots correctly. Two examples of poor filming are when Bruce's parents are killed in the first film and when Two Face would flip his coin. During the murder of Bruce's parents, filming should have made the robber appear to tower over Bruce and use an upward angle aimed at the robber. The scene should have ended with Bruce kneeling in-between his dead parents looking down at the street. As Two Face flips his coin, the camera should have done a close up shot of the coin flying through the air and landing on Two Face's palm. None of these techniques were done. Also, this Batman series and the rest of the live action films do not film enough shots that mimic comic book story panels and comic book angles. The closest live action film to have down this is the Matrix and that has been almost 15 years ago.
  The adaptation of these films are horrible because it focuses way too much on the mob as villains. This in turn has caused writers to strip down very important Batman villains and produce villains who are no longer what was portrayed in the comic books. The writers also give far too much background on Batman and give way too little background information on the villains and their motives. This happened with Scarecrow, it is going to happen with Bane, and it is clear it will occur with future villains this series brings forth. Scarecrow should not have been some whipping boy and he should have been the main villain in the first film. Bane should be Latino, buff, very smart, and he would require a trilogy where each film is close to 3 hrs with non-stop action. These facts are clear to anyone who has actually read Batman but it is clear that a majority of this series' viewers have not read Batman. They do not realize that this series is not really Batman, but an evil mob series with characters who have the same names of characters from Batman who sometimes show some sort of physical characteristics of Batman characters. But this series is not Batman.
  Since this film is live action, it dramatically falls short of Batman's full potential. Human beings and natural physics do not allow the proper display of the Batman world. It then requires way too much computer generation that is very easy to spot and the use of way too much talking that slows down the story and produces a film that is way too long. I do not understand why film makers do not just computer generate the whole film and make it look as life like as possible. Then the action scenes and film shots could properly display what is depicted in the comic books.
  The only films that are currently giving DC characters their proper justice are the PG-13 animated films that are being released directly to DVD by the film company: DC Universe Animated Original Movies. What makes DC Universe Animated Original Movies so good is the fact that they are being made by true fans of comic books. Those film makers obviously have read more than ten issues of the comic books, and so they adapt the films that correctly follow the mythology from the comic books. What is then produced is a PG-13, 90 min animated film, and that film is non-stop action voiced by amazing voice actors who bring to life comic book characters who are ripped straight from the pages of a comic book. If people really want to see good Batman films, they need watch the films being released by DC Universe Animated Original Movies.",1337731200,13,4079,4.547683923705722

4413076,4,B004LWZWGK,"This movie was okay, although not nearly as spectacular as its predecessor, The Dark Knight.

WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD

The returning and new actors were amazing. The background of Bane and the mysterious child, with the desert setting, added glorious color and a very different, and vibrant, edge. In many ways, The Dark Knight is a great movie that ends the trilogy satisfactorily (though not everyone will agree with the ending - I like it for artistic sake, though it's not completely original, but I like to think that it doesn't go on that way).

My complaints:
1. I couldn't understand Bane half the time because of his mask. Darth Vader's mask worked because he mostly just breathed. Bane had many lines and it irked me a lot.
2. The Dark Knight was about believing in the good of people. This movie is the opposite. It made me feel awful. When they burned the bridge to prevent the kids from crossing, I was so angry and nearly cried. I'd like to believe that wouldn't happen in real life.
3. Miranda's character was not nearly well developed enough before her character becomes important. I was wondering exactly what her place was and if she was just a side character or essential for most of the movie. Too confusing.

Overwhelmingly, a good film. But some aspects truly bothered me while watching.",1518998400,,1309,4.728070175438597

4413408,2,B004LWZWGK,"Christopher Nolan did a superb job resurrecting Batman after the Joel Schumacher era nearly destroyed the brand for good.  BATMAN BEGINS was surpassed by THE DARK KNIGHT as not only the best Batman movies, but perhaps the best super hero movies ever made.

So expectations were high for THE DARK KNIGHT RISES...and then it came out.  I found the film cumbersome and convoluted.  Batman appears way too late in his own film.  There's just no super hero stuff!

But the biggest mistake in the film was the script: Why does Bane take over Gotham City, acquire a nuclear bomb, and then announce that he'll wait for 30 days to detonate it?  Why?  Because Batman needs some time to recover before coming after him and stopping him.  That's about the only reason given I can recall.  And what world do we live in where there is no military force who wouldn't try to go in and stop them?  And the police trapped in the sewers couldn't find any other way out in a couple of week's time?  It just derailed the whole thing for me.

The first two: great films.  The third one: well, it's not as bad as Godfather III.  Maybe closer to Superman III with Richard Pryor.",1514073600,2,1154,4.480769230769231

4413410,5,B004LWZWGK,"The Dark Knight Rises was the last of the Christopher Nolan Batman trilogy (Batman Begins/Dark Knight/Dark Knight Rises) - this review will be focusing on the 4K Upgrade rather than the movie itself.

Christopher Nolan knocked it out of the park on these 4K releases. All were remastered for the 4K release and it really shows. Coming from the Blu-Ray, we're looking at a really nice upgrade. Sometimes these movies look very similar, but this one (like Dark Knight) is a great upgrade. Similar to the others, it switches aspect ratios from the original film ratio to IMAX (fullscreen) and the clarity is incredibly. Texture, sharpness, color, HDR, Lighting upgrades throughout.  If I did have any gripe, it would be that SOME shots are soft (while others look incredible!) and that the black levels were raised a bit, resulting in a pure black being a bit ""dark grey"" on an OLED TV.

Despite being the newer film, I'd probably say The Dark Knight impressed me the most, this one was 2nd and Batman Begins was the least  impressive.

On the audio side we're also looking at DTS-HD MA 5.1 audio (no Dolby Atmos) but it's a good track still.

The disc comes with a nice slipcover, the 4K Disc and a Blu-Ray + Special Features as well as a digital copy code. You can also pick this up in the Dark Knight Trilogy which has the same content (but no slipcover) or in the Christopher Nolan 4K Collection (which uses a bulky case to house all 7 Christopher Nolan movies and has no digital copy codes)",1513641600,13,1492,4.590225563909774

4413788,5,B004LWZWGK,"probably the most difficult thing to do for Nolan was to follow up the dark knight the 2nd film in the trilogy with the likes of ledger and how amazing he portrays the joker but this film did not disappoint I really enjoyed it Tom hardy is great. Anne Hathaway and Joseph Gordon levitt are also great in this movie as ""catwoman"" although that's never officially established we all know that's who she is playing and I'm guessing he eventual robin for JGL.  It's been a few years since this movie has been made and Nolan still hasn't done a robin movie with Joseph Gordon levitt while he did hint at it at the end of the motion picture it would be nice to see one. Overall this film was an epic way to end the trilogy, which in my opinion are the best batman movies to ever be made especially in the second installment.

4414765,4,B004LWZWGK,"Christopher Nolan's trilogy has always been my favorite with it's darker themes and characterization; Burton and company was a bit too campy and cartoonish for me. However, Christian Bale still doesn't quite fit - maybe it's the horrible voice, which has become a joke, but outside of Michael Keaton, no one else has done the role justice.

It is an incredible and impossible feat to follow Heath Ledger, who was absolutely brilliant in The Dark Knight, but Tom Hardy as Bane was my favorite part of the movie. Yes, I had captions on to understand him sometimes but he was intimidating and menacing and as hard as I tried looking for him, Hardy disappeared into the role. They had to shoot him low and fill the screen because Hardy is not what you call physically imposing but he felt like a giant! I wanted to know more about him, his role in the League of Shadows, and mission with Talia...spin-off!!!  So yeah, for me, he totally stole the show from Bale.

I loved the end and the idea that Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) could take over Batman's mission helping the city, but then they shot themselves in the foot with the surprise reveal. Haven't we established that Bruce Wayne is physically falling apart and was actually paralyzed by Bane? He IS getting old and no amount of gadgets is going to keep him going lol!  It just felt a bit too happy-ever-after for such a dark movie. I would have been fine with Batman sacrificing himself for his beloved city and Blake taking up the torch.",1485820800,,1491,4.615094339622641

4415342,1,B004LWZWGK,"This film is just another example of Corporate employees meddling in and ruining art. My gut tells me Christopher Nolan and his brother wrote a great The Dark Night Rises. The corporate employees made him add Catwoman and the happy ending.

The film would have been much stronger and centered if it focused on Bruce, Alfred, Gordon, Bane, Miranda and Gotham. The extraneous stuff, including introducing ""Robin"" who isn't named ""Robin."" That is his nickname. He is Dick Grayson. Robin was a name given to him by his trapeeze act family, because he flew from swing to swing like an American Robin. He was never a cop. What the hell?

Anyway, there is no way Batman survived the nuclear explosion. The hurried jumpy weird editing at the end indicates that. There is no reason he would live happily ever after with a thief who stole his dead mother's jewels. There is no reason why they would be at the same cafe that Alfred frequents at the same time. Alfred imagined them their, then it was re-edited. There is no way he could have given up his mission to be the batman. He died to free himself. He died for his city. That was perfect. Then the muckety mucks around the boardroom table at WB, changed all that to a feel good summer film.

Nolan will never break the code, as Trank just did. He took the money and ran and ruined a wonderful trilogy.

I will give the movie credit because experts have said that if somebody were to devote themselves to this kind of thing, they'd be broken within ten years of starting. It's mentioned that Bruce Wayne is missing cartilage in his joints, there's severe ossification and he's basically a walking mess of health issues. There's some hand waving and suddenly he's back at full strength.

Next we're introduced to Catwoman and as much as I like Ms. Hathaway, they really didn't give her much to work with. Tom Hardy as Bane is just wrong as that character is not the roided up on venom Bane that broke the bat in the comic books. And we have Robin. Kinda. Sorta. Well not quite.

Christian Bale's throat cancer just didn't work for me in this movie. His ""Batman"" voice sounded worse than it did in the last two movies almost like it was a parody of what he used to used to sound like.

I mean we're talking about Batman's journey and how it ends, and Christopher Nolan knocked it out of the ballpark!!!! Bane is a far even greater menace than the Joker. He literally takes all of Gotham City hostage. Something that Heath Ledger's Joker only could dream of, because in ""The Dark Knight"" the Joker just terrorizes Gotham to its almost breaking point. He never took the entire city hostage like, Tom Hardy's Bane does. In this film, Bane is a wrecking ball that breaks Batman's back, thus literally paralyzing him. Batman must endure his greatest challenge ever to overcome his paralysis, and Tom Hardy does a splendid job at acting the sheer heck out of it!!!!!! Though some fans have complained about not being able to understand what Bane is saying half the time, I understood him perfectly due to the fact that I saw this one on the big screen with loud surround sound. And if you still have trouble understanding him, just add English subtitles on your Blu-ray or dvd. That will help tremendously. While Heath Ledger's Joker represented chaos, Tom Hardy's Bane represents revolution and its outright horrifying aspects. Some fans have also complained that this movie is not as epic as TDK, but this movie far surpasses its predecessors. It is even more epic than TDK, due to the fact of the brilliant storytelling and awesome fight sequences and special effects. Unlike Marvel's The Avengers, this movie has a plot and a well-written one at that. It's not just all eye-candy. I wasn't disappointed with this one, due to the fact that I wasn't expecting a Joker-like clone as the main villain. Bane is a completely different type of villain.
While the Joker was just an insane mad dog, Bane is a brilliant-minded strategist that knows how to break Batman which makes him even more deadlier than the Joker. And just when I thought I had everything figured out about the plot, Christopher Nolan threw in some twists as well. This makes the movie that more rewarding to the Batman fan and adds great character depth too. So, if you plan to see this movie, don't go into it expecting a repeat performance of Heath Ledger's Joker, because Bane is in town.",1471651200,8,2278,4.740554156171284

4416090,5,B004LWZWGK,"The Dark Knight Rises
 If you haven't been to the flickers yet this year, this is the one to see.  This is the first genuine five saw blade film of 2012.  That match made in movie heaven between actor Christian Bale and director Christopher Nolan that we know well from the two previous Batman films in this series continues and improves in the final episode.  I might be sad because the collaboration between Bale and Nolan is over except that this film is a wonderful, apt and fitting culmination.  If you are waiting for a better film to view this year, don't wait.  Better than this there isnt.
 Christopher Nolan co-wrote the screenplay with his equally talented brother Jonathan Nolan.  Jonathan also wrote the intricate Memento, The Prestige and the Christopher Nolan directed The Dark Knight.  Brilliant writing gives the acclaimed actors in the film something interesting to say and do.  To sew up the triple play, Christopher Nolan also produced the movie.  Nolan is no one hit wonder.  In between the last two Batman films he directed the innovative Inception.  But The Batman has contributed the most to his $90 million fortune.
 There is a bad guy, Bane, played as a masked brute by Tom Hardy.  He and his comrades set up a peoples republic in Gotham City.  The Batman must defeat the baddies before the city disappears in a mushroom shaped cloud, which gives some urgency to the project.  Other cast members include Michael Caine as Alfred the loyal Batman butler, Morgan Freeman as the boffin behind the fabulous Bat-toys and Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon, all returning players.  New player Ann Hathaway (The Devil Wears Prada) gets to don black latex and become immortal as Cat Woman.  The slight actress manages a convincing athleticism which surprised me.  Like The Batman, Cat Woman is a tortured soul, which Hathaway also brings to light for us.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt continues to grow as an adult actor.  Here he is an earnest and heroic young policeman.
 The star is of course Christian Bale.  The story for me is all about how Bruce Wayne must suffer, spiritually and physically, in order to become The Batman for the people of his city.  Batman is never referred to as simply Batman, but always as The Batman.  This puts him on another plane entirely from ordinary humans and makes the struggle of the too human Bruce Wayne to fill the Bat-suit all the more poignant.  No one suffers quite as well as does Bruce Wayne as played by Christian Bale.
 Director Nolan keeps the special effects in check.  They remain special, particularly the Bat-toys, but do not abscond with the movie, as happens in lesser movies by lesser directors.  Still, with worldwide locations and plenty of effects, the makers spent a not-in-this-case unreasonable $250 million to make the PG 13 Dark Knight Rises.  Estimates of the weekend gross domestically run to $160 million.  Fans will be pleased to sit for two hours and 40 minutes.",1470355200,2,2941,4.82

Is it as good as the other two in the series before this one? That is only for you to judge. In my opinion it was not but it still was an awesome watch. The villians in the series were dope. It seemed like mulitple comic series were used and put together to make this trilogy. It shouldn't even matter if the story is 100% accurate with the comics since it's for entertainment & if you want the story from the comics go read the comics again.

4416806,5,B004LWZWGK,"This one really is the best. TDK has grown on me in comparison to TDKR, but TDKR is so epic in its scope and has such a great crescendo/climax that it's hard for me to change and say TDK is better. Bane is a great character, a very powerful villain who is both interesting and sympathetic and yet evil enough to be happy when he's defeated. Anne Hathaway as Catwoman Is delightful, even in comparison to Michelle Pfeiffer in Batman Returns. I actually kind of like Anne Hathaway better--she's elegant, she's refined, she's lithe, she's cleverer. And of course the usual staples of Bale, Caine, Freeman, and Oldman are incredible. It still blows me away that Oldman is English, and yet comes across so convincingly as an everyday American police commissioner. He was also the Romanian Count Dracula back in 1992. Amazing. This film inspired me to write my own futuristic fiction in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Starfall-An-Epic-Tragedy-of-Vampires-War-and-America-s-Destruction/dp/B01F5LNQN6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Starfall: An Epic Tragedy of Vampires, War, and America's Destruction</a>, which concludes with a natural disaster and nuclear warfare that involve a terrorist group much like Bane's League of Shadows in TDKR.

Apparently he didn't need those organs anyhow.

In ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" his mortality becomes more evident as does his fallibility. The hard living is taking a toll on his health, and he even loses his fortune - albeit temporarily. Is Bruce totally without resources? Will Gotham meet the fate many think it deserves -- to be ruled by terrorists?

It is sad that this movie probably did not receive the popularity it deserved because of the terrorist attack -- yes, that's what it was -- in the Colorado movie theater.

4418383,5,B004LWZWGK,"Although The Dark Knight Rises is apart of a series of Batman movies, I like to think of it as its own movie. Why? Christopher Nolan does clear up some grey spots in the previous movie with this one, it still has a brand new plot and central point that he wants to convey to his audience, which is with motivation and resilience, you can overcome some of the toughest challenges in life.
 The setting is in the city of Gotham. In the dark knight rises, we see that Gotham is doing considerably well but the people mourn once one of their fallen heroes, Harvey Dent. Gotham is content and Batman is left with no city to save.
 Bruce Wayne, also known as Batman, is weak and lost in the beginning. Batman is weak because of some major impacts he took in the last movie, The Dark Knight. He walks around with a cane, which resembles deterioration and in need of stability. The cane is crucial at this point of the movie because it resembles Batmans physical state. Bruce isolates himself from the city. He loses sight of the value of life and that he doesnt need to constantly help the city. He is lost because the city of Gothams crime is restored and doing well because of Harvey Dents impact on the city. Therefore, without any major problems, Batman has no motivation to rebuild himself from the beating he took in the last movie. Also he feels no need to join society because he feels like he cannot help the city unless he is fighting crime.
 We are introduced to Batmans new challenge in the very beginning of this movie, his name is Bane. Bane is a strong and intelligent antagonist in this movie. He wears a fur coat throughout the movie, this signifies power and wisdom. The fur coat could also signify some beastly tendencies since some beasts have fur. For example, a grizzly bear which has fur, is one of the most feared animals in the forest and is at the top of its food chain. Bane leads his pack of villains into Gotham so he can simply destroy it. We see his intentions when he highjacks the plan in the beginning of this movie. He executes this mission in a sophisticated manner. Bane also wears a black mask around his face. He talks through the mask which makes his voice sound almost robotic. It shows that like a machine, he is designed for a specific purpose, and in his situation it would be to obliterate Gotham. Bane makes his first appearance in Gotham by holding the stock exchange building hostage. He takes out the guards when he first enters the building, and his training is exceptional. This shows that Bane poses a threat on Gotham and that he must be stopped. We are now introduced to Batmans motivation.
 Bruce Wayne sees the surveillance of Bane fighting in the stock exchange building. Alfred, Bruces butler and guardian is afraid that he may not be ready to take on Bane. Alfred tells Bruce that this city isn't Bruces responsibility and that he shouldnt risk his life for it. Bruce ignores Alfreds request and prepares himself to defend Gotham. Bruce makes his rare appearance in Gotham shortly after Bane. This shows that Batman and Bane are both on the territory and that it is going to either end in Banes favor or Batmans.
 In the middle of the movie Batman feels that he is ready to defeat Bane. They are fighting underground, where Bane has been hiding out and plotting. Technically Batman is in Banes territory. Whenever we as people are in a new territory we are often unfamiliar with it and need to adapt. This is similar to Batmans situation. He needs to adapt to the way Bane operates. Bane and Batman fight and Batman is not adapting to this fight well. Bane is beating Batman into the ground. Before Bane breaks batmans body, he says, Ah, I was wondering what would break first, your spirit or your body. Bane says this because he realizes that Batman fights with out hesitation or fear of death. Batman would sacrifice his body before his spirit. Bane does not kill him; he instead sends him to a place called Hell on Earth because he believes that Batmans punishment should be greater than just killing him.
 Hell on earth is a prison that is shaped like a cup. The prisoners are at the bottom of the cup where if they look up, they can see the freedom. They can only see it, because the one route of escape is by climbing out and to get out you need to make the jump which is located near the top of the cup and it must be completed in order to leave. The jump is a task that is nearly impossible to make. Only one person has made the jump. Hell on Earth is where Bruce learns to value his life, and to fear death. Once he learns this, then he can defeat Bane. Bruce again rebuilds himself and attempts to make the jump several times with a rope around him. Bruce knows time is running out, he attempts to make the jump but this time without the rope around him. This signifies that Bruce has finally learned to fear death. This is what gives Batman the tools needed to defeat Bane, which he does at the end of the movie.
 Christopher Nolan did a great job portraying the central idea. We see the physical progression of Bruce Wayne, who goes from weak ad alone to motivated and strong. Batman was given motivation in the beginning of the movie because of Bane, which was some adversity. Next, he was beaten into the ground, literally sent to a Hell on Earth, where he acquired more motivation which was the fear of death. He used the fear of death and losing his city to make the jump and to defeat Bane. Batman achieves a couple very important goals. He learns one of the greatest motivators of all time, and that is to value life and fear death. In the end he rises from Hell on Earth and defeats bane. Banes mask signifies his plan and purpose. In the end of the movie Batman defeats Bane by destroying his mask, thus resembling batman destroying his plan. We now can see that with motivation and resilience, Batman was able to rise and save his city. We can relate this movie to our lives especially as college students, because we go through adversity every day in the classroom, on the field, or maybe even internally. With resilience and motivation, we can overcome these problems that we face everyday.",1446595200,,6165,4.455270150575731

Jack Nicholson was probably paid a lot more for the same part in a previous movie, but Heath surpassed even the great Jack N.

But I will not ruin the twist near the end of the movie that even I didn't see coming and I am usally good at predict certain storylines and so forth.

4419092,5,B004LWZWGK,"Much that is ridiculous or illogical happens in this movie. At the same time, it's dramatic, beautiful, and epic. So, kind of like a Wagner opera of the film world.

Nolan understands that what movies do best isn't realistic portrayals or logically consistent elaborate plots. The medium is uniquely good at beautiful or effective combinations of music, dialogue, and picture: any plot that creates opportunities for such combinations (without being too silly), is a good plot. In fact, the more consistent and realistic a filmmaker tries to be, the fewer opportunities he'll have for such combinations. A filmmaker has to decide whether he wants to eat his cake or keep it.

The scene where Bruce speaks with the imprisoned doctor and escapes is one of my favorite scenes in all of cinema. The music that begins silently in the background during the dialogue is hauntingly beautiful, the dialogue is poetic, and the cinematography is transparent and doesn't draw undue attention to itself. Just to point out how rare all that is: you can't find anything like it in a single Hollywood film as far as I know (Nolan has his own production company, and his movies are merely distributed - not produced - by Hollywood studios).

Hollywood films give you the distinct impression of being hack jobs by people without souls. Nolan is completely different: ""...[when I pay to see a movie] I want to feel that the people who made that film think it's the best movie in the world, that they poured everything into it and they really love it."" When I watch The Dark Knight Rises - and I've seen it a dozen times - I can tell it's not a money grab. I can see it's a movie made with ambition and passion for the medium.

That's not to say I think it's perfect. I think it has a few rather boring scenes, and I think one or two of the dramatic moments don't quite work. But that's like complaining Heaven has fountains made of silver instead of gold. It is, at the end of the day, nitpicking.",1440547200,,1978,4.610795454545454

Unlike other Batman movies, this one deals with Bruce learning how to get on with his life without the rage that birthed Batman. Frankly, I have always been more interested in Batman than Bruce, but as I watched this, I realized that Bruce is just as important as Batman. Other people don't like this because they either expected it to be exactly like The Dark Knight or similar, but if you ignore that fact, and remember there are worse movies than this, people can enjoy this as a good story, nothing more, nothing less.",1437436800,,585,4.4766355140186915

4419392,5,B004LWZWGK,"I'm not big on superhero movies, but I love the newest Batman trilogy, especially the latest film, The Dark Knight Rises.  ""Action"" movies wear me out about half the time; shooting and exploding isn't very interesting for long.  There has to be a good story.  The Batman movie has the perfect mix of action, cool toys, and suspense for an action film.  But it is so much more than that.  It is an excellent portrayal of human nature and contemporary social issues.  It's a great movie because it relates to current times.  Ideally, those watching are able to make the connection to what happens when stealing and cheating (even if legal) become the norm.  The characters are perfect and correlate to the same personalities one will encounter in organizations and society.  There's only so much time in the day, and if one is to watch a film, it should either teach a lesson or make one think.

The special effects, soundtrack, and acting is good as well.

There is not bad language and nothing too sexual.  It's appropriate for children 8-10 up, as long as parents are there to help teach the message.  I highly recommend this movie, and I am glad I purchased it.  I watch it frequently.",1437350400,,1187,4.617224880382775

4419434,5,B004LWZWGK,"The Dark Knight Rises is tied for my 2nd favorite Batman movie with Batman Begins.  My favorite will always be The Dark Knight.  I already had the single disc DVD, so I went and bought the 2 disc DVD because I wanted to have all the Batman movies in the 2 disc special edition format.  The special features are great and informative, the film is great looking.

The Dark Knight Rises focuses on how Bruce Wayne has changed since The Dark Knight took place, and it works well.  Bane is easily my 2nd favorite villain in the trilogy behind The Joker.  I thought Tom Hardy was the perfect Bane, and he's brutal, menacing, and takes over Gotham City.  Catwoman is way better than in the '60s Batman and Batman Returns, she has good character development and assists Batman in the end.  There isn't much I don't like aside from the plot holes, such as: how did Bane travel to the middle of nowhere, talk to Bruce, and get back to Gotham in no time?,  How did Bruce heal completely in a prison in the middle of nowhere and work to regain his strength?  How did Bane set up bombs directly under Bruce's armory?  Whenever someone falls from the wall in the prison, they break their backs and die, so how did Bruce survive and do it again later?  And more...

Regardless, The Dark Knight Rises is a terrific war and rebellion movie, with great action, drama, and well choreographed fights.  Definitely buy the Two Disc Special Edition.  I now have all the live action Batman movies in the two disc format, except the 1966 movie.  If only it would be released in the two disc format.",1436832000,2,1573,4.4475524475524475

4419835,5,B004LWZWGK,"After not enjoying the last Batman film, I was hesitant to see The Dark Knight Rises.  I finally decided that if I was invited to see it with friends, I'd go, but I wouldn't go out of my way to see it.  Fortunately, some friends asked me to join them on opening night because I really enjoyed it.

I am going to be very careful to not spoil this movie.  However, I will make some references to the last film.  Those will mostly happen in the next paragraph.  You have been warned.

It's been eight years since the night Harvey Dent died and Batman became public enemy number 1.  In that time, Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) has cleaned up the streets of Gotham City.  But he's done it without the help of Batman, who is still in hiding.  Likewise, Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) has spent the last eight years in Wayne Manor grieving Rachael and refusing to move on with his life.

That changes, first when Bruce has a run in with cat burglar Selina (Anne Hathaway).  But he really must come forward after Bane (Tom Hardy) comes to town.  Bane has a plan all his own to destroy Gotham.  Is the city ready to forgive Batman?  And can Bruce truly come out of retirement to be Batman again?

As I said, I went into this movie a little leery about whether I would ultimately enjoy it or not.  Now I'm not going to say it was all light.  There was still plenty of darkness to the film.  But it wasn't overly depressing and the ultimate messages of the film were more uplifting overall.

The movie is a two hour and forty minute epic.  I really was expecting the movie to drag at some point.  But it never does.  I was engrossed the entire time.  Yes, certain plot developments were expected, but everything was so well done I really didn't care.

Even though these have been more realistic superhero movies (well, as realistic as you can be in this genre), the movies have been filled with great action sequences and special effects.  This one is no exception, and they hold together well.  I bought what I saw, and the action was all easy to follow and exciting.

Many of the actors returned from the previous two films, so it's hardly a surprise that they are great here.  Of the new cast members, I loved Anne Hathaway as Catwoman.  She brought a sass to her lines there were just so much fun.  Another great newcomer was Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a policeman who becomes involved in the plot.

I have seen neither of the previous films since the last one came out.  I wish I had because there are references to them that I had forgotten.  I had to have my friends fill me in on the way home.  So if you can, rewatch them before you see this one.

If I had one complaint, it was Batman and Bane's voices.  At times, they are hard to understand over the background noise/music.  They really should have mixed the sound better.  Still, I could always follow the story, so it was a minor complaint.  I wasn't the only one who felt that way; we all agreed it was an issue on the way home.

I am thrilled I didn't let a bad experience keep me away from this movie.  The Dark Knight Rises is a worthy final chapter to this trilogy.",1433289600,,3122,4.33044982698962

3. If you've ever tried friction climbing you'll think the climbing scenes are lame (they are!!) but the rest of the movie has heart. The actors are pussies. Regarding physical activity - if you have modicum of, this film will leave you thinking you're the only one. It's half-assed and orphan kind of film. Disappointing as a member of those constituents.

4420130,1,B004LWZWGK,"I've read the paperback edition of No Man's Land, and also the Knightfall comics. My idea is whose idea was it to combine both?

As a 2 part movie, or perhaps as just one solid idea the film could have worked. The first 2 movies were well worth the price tag. However, this movie fell completely flat. There's no Azrael to fill Batman's void so we're left with some of the most boring story build up I've ever sat through in a theater. I mean I'm not joking here. Also the fact that this movie is three hours.

There's a lot if plot holes, and serious lack of character development. Catwoman is thrown in there with nothing to do but look pretty. Talia Am Ghul is thrown in with no build what so ever. Hardcore fans of the comics will get the nod. But even her back story is completely pointless. Bane comes off looking like a saint, and you instantly realize that Batman failed to stop the uprising.

That brings me to my next point. The No Man's land elements. Bruce Wayne gets his back broken in knightfall and is recovering in an undisclosed hospital. He picks his own temporary Batman which becomes as monster of its own.

In No Man's Land it's like Batman is illegal. Nobody knows anything regarding where he is. He resurfaces after discovering a scheme by Lex Luthor. Then the supporting cast in the book is done very well.

Then there's the martyr ending to the film. You're telling me after 8 years there's no more upgrades to the bat suit or technology since Bruce is feeling sorry for himself after being relegated to walking with a cane? I mean it's not like he can go to the doctor.

Combining Knightfall, and Batman: No Man's Land gives us a mish mash mess of a film. Batman is pretty much obsolete which you never figure could be done. The villains run things, and taking back the city seems way too easy. In the action department you can save your breath. This movie could have benefitted from rewrites, and reshoots. Cut the time down to 2 hours and 15 minutes.

I thought we were going to see something great. But it was a disappointment in every single fashion. Honestly three hours of boredom is better spent doing anything beside watching this movie. Do yourself a favor. Get the first two, and skip this one entirely. Or just read the comics. You'll be better off for doing so.",1429833600,,2299,4.446555819477434

4420282,4,B004LWZWGK,"I did not find The Dark Knight Rises to be anywhere near as compelling as the previous 2 installments in this Batman series.

The Dark Knight (episode 2 in the trilogy) was one of the single best movies of all time. The Dark Knight Rises was okay...but it didn't feel like it flowed with the look and feel of the first 2 films. The first 2 had a nice marriage of comic book style and realism. The look of the DKR was much more realistic, without that comic book feel. So I just didn't feel like it flowed nicely with the first 2.

There were plenty of references to time honored Batman stories from the comics. Bane breaking Batman's back was a huge event in the comics and that element made its way into the movie. Batman having the hots for Ra's al Ghul's daughter was from the books. So it's not like the story drifted too far from it's roots. But the physical look of the film did. The elevated transit system from the first movie, the ultra creepy Joker from the second movie....stuff like that just gave them a surreal look. But Bane was almost believable as a real bad guy. Selina Kyle, played by Anne Hathaway was FANTASTIC in the movie, but she didn't have a comic book vibe at all. I love the character, but she was very realistic with no fantasy element to her at all. Everything she did was plausible. (Cat ears were just her goggles flipped up....etc)

Additionally, much of it occurs during the day time, with Batman fighting an epic battle in broad day light. That's just strange for any Batman story.

The movie wasn't bad. It did wrap up the series okay. Bane was one seriously creepy villain (That's a good thing). I just didn't enjoy it nearly as much as the first 2 films.

If this film stood alone it would be better without changing a thing. But in the trilogy it doesn't flow with the first 2 movies.",1427846400,,1823,4.3657817109144545

The answer is probably not as it does not contain the same emotionnal concentration that the second movie had with the tragedy of Rachel Dawes. However it is a spectacular conclusion. Pushing Bruce Wayne to its limits, both physical and psychological (can he rise up again after having been abandoned by its city), he rises again thanks to its formidable heroic spirit and a real trust in human nature. Bane is a powerful villain, brillantly displayed by Tom Hardy as a real beast, with a very clever mind. This changes drastically from the dumb in Joel Schumacher's movie.
On a different angle than the Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises offers the best of Batman and gets you into its conclusion about the notion of heroism and devotion from a single man.",1424563200,,884,4.709677419354839

The only thing this movie doesn't have that the other two films have is Batman gliding. One of my favorite things about Batman Begins was when he gets the memory cloth from Fox and starts gliding across the city. It was so well done and pitched in such a believable way that I was disappointed there was no gliding in this film. Having said that, the film doesn't suffer for it.

4421064,5,B004LWZWGK,"As the slogan said in the previews, TDKR IS an epic conclusion to Nolan's trilogy.

I got this for a very cheap price on Cyber Monday (for a friend, I already had it) which kind of felt like I was paying less than what the movie's worth. This is an epic conclusion, and after the The Dark Knight, I was wondering how Nolan would outdo himself. He did.

Furthermore, I must comment and say Hans Zimmer outdid himself. When I think of Nolan's Batman movies, the first thing I'll probably think of is Zimmer's memorable themes, and for this one, Bane's theme goes with Bane's menace.

For criticisms, I give credit to ""How it should have ended"" - a humorous website the picks on movies... but there's a scene when Wayne returns to Gotham after a long exile, and to showcase his return to Bane, all we see is a skyscraper with the shape of a Bat on the side. Humorously, I must know, why did Wayne think that sort of project was worthwhile while the city, including his new love interest, is being held captive?

Obviously the response will be to give hope to people that Batman is back, and give fright to the enemy.

In any case, not entirely important. Nolan raises the stakes higher in this film, and isn't afraid to pick on movie-goer's nerves and put the main characters to their limits, and even break a few Batman-mythos rules in the process.

The result is Batman more real then he's ever been. It IS an epic conclusion.",1420761600,2,1425,4.440613026819923

4421154,2,B004LWZWGK,"A very dissapointing movie, especially coming off of The Dark Knight, which was a very action packed movie with a solid plot and a great villian. Instead of making it bigger and better and going in a proper direction, the movie takes a few steps back. It basically recycles the plot of the first movie with new villians. Now Bane is a great villian which is sold entirely by a great performance but his plan makes no sense. And again, it's recycled from the first movie, not impressed.

The title is also terrible. They couldn't come up with a new title that doesn't have the words The Dark Knight in it? Nitpick but it really is a laughable title considering it's a continuation of the second movie and the titles meaning is stupid cause it's a dissapointing ""triumph"" for Batman.

I'll be straight up, I never cared for Bale's Batman. The voice is too much and he's not just a rich guy with gadgets, that's not who Batman is. Aside from that I didn't like the ending of The Dark Knight. Batman takes the fall for Harvey's crimes, which is something he'd never do by the way, and then they kill off Two-Face. Huge mistake, I thought. But okay, he's now a cripple in this movie and it's way too forced. He just immediately goes out again and gets his butt whooped. Then he's thrown into some ancient type prison and then he's psychologically tortured by Bane before him and his city will be destroyed. Doesn't make a whole lot of sense in the long run. Turns out all he has to do is get his back cracked and then he's ready to go take Gotham back.

I really hate when the last movie in a trilogy introduces us to characters that aren't given time for us to care about. Bane is killed off in a rather anticlimactic way and then it passes it off to a women out of nowhere. Doesn't really work. Do they really expect us to care about this? Then on top of that the mantle is passed to the cop who's name is Robin. Didn't like that part either. So when all is said and done it's not a terrible movie it's just a really dissapointing last film with a poorly written plot that takes way too many steps back and throws way too much at the audience. It's not a very cohesive movie and not a very good story for Batman.",1420243200,,2209,4.292565947242206

It was impossible for me to take the villain seriously since he sounded like he was doing a bad Sean Connery impersonation (I kept expecting him to say, ""Suck it, Trebek""). I didn't really understand Anne Hathaway's character--an explanation for the cat suit and how she got to be who she is might have helped. The young cop was a semi-interesting character, but his insights were a little hard to believe and his role in the climactic race-to-rescue-Gotham was pointless. And the revenge storyline was just odd--surely there were more direct, less tortured ways for Gotham to be destroyed, less elaborate schemes to be set up? And when does any police force act as one unit? There's no night shift in Gotham? Everyone's on duty at once? Really? Very disappointing.",1419379200,,931,5.0519480519480515

4421281,3,B004LWZWGK,"After The Dark Knight, there was a sense that Christopher Nolan would not be able to top himself. The Dark Knight was almost 100% the perfect comic book adaptation.

There were a lot of questions on whether or not the story would be able to continue after the tragic death of Heath Ledger and Nolan himself was apprehensive over doing another sequel. The Dark Knight Rises was written to end this era of Batman and I was fine with that. I was however worried about Bane being the next villain chosen after Joker. While Bane is a cool villain, I thought there were plenty of more choices in the villain pool for Batman than him because Bane never had one consistent backstory in each era of Batman comics he was involved in.

The story in a nutshell is set eight years after The Dark Knight and is about Bane finishing the work of Ra's al Ghul and an older and even more hurt Bruce Wayne/Batman trying to stop him.

The story is definitely good but the overall look, direction, fight scenes and action doesn't really hold up to the standards set by The Dark Knight. The action is probably the most inconsistent next to the first two films and that says a lot when you look at the shaky action work of Batman Begins. Batmans fighting speed is very inconsistent, going from fast as hell with Banes henchmen and slower than a turtle with Bane himself.

The only fight scene that worked out very well was the first fight between Bane and Batman, very emotional and well done. The rest are hampered down by very poor choreography. Also, Nolan, who is a very intelligent director, seems to lose his intelligence on camera angles for fight scenes because some angles give away the fact that a lot of the punches and hits are not connecting.

One of the things that holds up to the standards of the first two movies, is the acting. Very well acted film. Christian Bale does a great job again and Tom Hardy, despite being rather small in size compared to the comics (and is actually shorter than Christian Bale in real life) does a very good job as Bane, I especially love the more menacing voice in his portrayal. I think the most surprising performance was Marion Cottilard. Out of most of the cast, she came off as the biggest surprise because at first she seems like your typical female love interest in the film and then she turns into the villain. They do leave small hints of her true character in the film but you really have to pay attention to see them in your first viewing of the movie.

Overall, it's a good Batman on its own, it's just unfortunate that it had two near perfect films to live up to.",1419120000,,2601,4.4423480083857445

I watched a few weeks ago and thought it was okay (had a hard time following the plot) but I re-watched today and found it amazing.  It's very entertaining (makes me think I should re-watch the first one). Christian Bale did a good job as batman (he's gorgeous :p) and I loved the plot and action scenes.

4421373,5,B004LWZWGK,"hathaway delivers the best female super hero role ever cat woman suits her (hott) no pun intended, especially loved her hovering over the bat bike...  This is probably my favorite batman movie out of all of them...christian bale has done an outstanding job playing bruce wayne and batman.  the early batman movies were to much drama and not enough acting.... finally a batman movie where acting surpasses the drama, and considering the drama in this movie is quite magnificent, says a lot about the acting.  i am excited to see what's next...  i will say this however...the air craft bruce wayne drives in this movie is huge chunky and lame.....ugly...they can do better than that....ya thats my only complaint.",1418169600,,711,4.949579831932773
4421374,4,B004LWZWGK,"The Dark Knight Rises is a good movie on its own but comparing it to the two previous installments it falls short.  Example of this is the plot, in Batman Begins and ""The Dark Knight"" I can watch both movie without realizing they're over two hours long.  There were no moments where I am bored and looking for the next action scene.  But in ""The Dark Knight Rises"" there were at least 5 or 6 times were this movie seems to drag on, on , on and on.  I can't put my figure on it but it seems something was missing from this film( maybe Health Ledger(R.I.P)).  Bale and Hathaway had excellent chemistry throughout the film.  Now about Bane voice...... IT JUST SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I cannot describe it but when you hear it you will not like it.  With a large special effect budget you would think the Warner Brothers could have improve on Bane voice/speech.  Even with these small imperfections I would still recommend this film.  This a good movie but not a great one.",1418169600,,968,4.48

4421399,1,B004LWZWGK,"This was Ed Wood with a big budget. First off,  Christian Bale's ""I have a mouth full of oatmeal/I have a really bad cold/I sing for a death metal band"" Batman voice is freaking hilarious. Then you have Bane's voice which sounded like they dubbed in Sean Connery doing a bad ""Cherman"" accent. Every time Bane spoke I had to suppress the giggles.
My all time favorite implausible movie moment occurs in this film when Bruce, back broken by Bane, was hung by a rope by two fellow pit dwellers in order to heal him.  The one pit dweller points out that Bruce has a broken vertebra sticking out his back. He then punches Bruce in the back & says, ""You will hang there until you can walk."" Now, I'm not sure what chiropractor's school the fellow attended but I'm pretty sure that wouldn't....ummmm...you know....work to fix his freaking back. Nevertheless, Batman is soon pumping out push ups & sit ups like a champ.

Finally, back to Batman's ""mouth full of oatmeal"" voice. There's a bit near the end where Batman, talking about the soon to explode bomb, says something like ""I can take it out into the bay."" But it was nearly unintelligible due to the mouth full oatmeal that Batman keeps on hand so no one will recognize his voice.
I so badly wanted Catwoman to say, ""Huh?"" Of course, Batman would then forcibly remumble his statement. To which Catwoman would reply, ""Nope, still not getting it. Just one more time."" Batman would then re-remumble only to have Catwoman say, ""You really think your gay? Look I'm not that this is the time to discuss your sexuality but, come to think of it, it does go far towards explaining your fascination with black plether & vinyl....""",1417824000,3,1669,4.593959731543624

The Batman bares his soul here, and makes a new connection with a very sexy female lead. Gary Oldman is more brilliant than ever as the embattled commissioner.  The villain ""Bane"" comes across as evil and fearsome, though not as psycho as the ""Joker"". You will snarl at the screen over this madman! Our hero is fully put to the test in this one, and you may be surprised at how it all ends. All in all, highly recommended for Batman lovers and comic-hero junkies alike.

4421450,5,B004LWZWGK,"I really enjoyed this movie, despite some ridiculous plot holes. The biggest one I have to get off my chest right now is why, WHY, in Bane's prison, didn't Bruce or any other of the other prisoners just climb out? Let's see, they had rope, so all they need is a piece of metal. Their prison bars and beds are metal, so break off a piece. Make a grappling hook. Tie the rope to it. Climb up as far as you can. Throw the grappling hook over the edge. Climb out. WOW, that was so hard. But then, you miss out on the chance to discover and conquer your fears, right? -eyeroll-

That was the biggest one that had me yelling at my tv screen. Besides that plot hole, we have:

-Who knew spinal surgery could be accomplished with a well-placed punch?
-Fraudulent stock exchanges made on the day of a terrorist attack are allowed to stand and bankrupt Wayne Enterprises?
-Why didn't Bane kill the cops trapped in the sewers for 5 months?
-Why didn't all of those cops have thick beards when they came out?
-Why didn't the cops climb over the stack of cars what was less than 20 feet high before Catwoman blasted it?
-The day of the attack on the stock exchange must have been the shortest day in history; the attack started in the morning, and by the time Batman is pursuing Bane's men a short time later, it's night.
-Why did no one see the Bat under a net or tarp, flapping in the breeze, for 5 months while Batman was on vacation?
-Bruce's bum knees and joints are suddenly and permanently healed by one leg brace? Bye bye cane, who needs you!
-Why didn't Bane blow up Gotham right away, while Batsy was safe in prison watching the tv that Bane thoughtfully left for him?

Ok, enough... there are other plot holes, but I'll stop with those now. The movie was very entertaining, just don't think about it too much. Bane was a very ruthless and entertaining villain. When I saw this in the theater, and Bane broke Batman's back, it was dead silent. You could literally hear a pin drop, in a packed theater. I, for one, had no trouble understanding what he said at all. It's funny that Bane's lines have inspired thousands of internet memes, perhaps even more than the Joker. He masterminded a plot to perfection, and was this close to completing it.. and then he was brushed aside in 3 seconds by Catwoman. Well, them's the breaks..

I liked the addition of Catwoman; Anne Hathaway did well in her role. Street hardened, smart and ruthless, but deep inside she still has a heart, it just takes the imminent death of Gotham City to bring it out.

There's plenty of action, surprises, and plot twists to keep things lively, and of course, Hans Zimmer's musical score is excellent throughout the movie. I just wish they had taken the time to tighten up a few of those plot holes. Maybe Batman Vs. Superman will be more careful in this regard?",1417564800,,2831,4.426103646833013
4421451,4,B004LWZWGK,"Good movie, not as good as the first two. The one thing that really ruins it for in this entire series, though: the voices. As soon as Bale goes from Wayne to Batman, he talks like he's gargling thumb tacks and is barely understandable. Ledger as the Joker was also annoying -- he sounded like he was chewing on something and had a drooling problem. In this one, Hardy looks like a monster with the voice of a 7 year old. I wish they'd just use a more natural voice and stop trying so hard to be Keaton and Nicholson.",1417564800,,517,4.18

I can't take this seriously after hearing the great Stop Podcasting Yourself episode where guest Emmett Hall does a Bane impression: ""Look! A speech by Commissioner Gordon! It's written on a sheet of paper!""
As though that proves it's in any way true. And yet I totally bought it first time I saw the movie.
Forgive me if I stare: Anne Hathaway in cat suit! :0 ;p
Does plot make any sense? About 45%. Most of the Bane stuff, Wayne hiding out and depressed all these years...It's a comic for crying out loud. Who give a whoop cushion?
Is Christian Bale righteously fun to watch? Yes. Does J Gordon Levitt leave a saccharine aftertaste? Oh yeah. Does Michael Caine rock our worlds? You bet! Morgan Friedmen just sort of phoning it in but loving every minute? Indeed! Do we miss Heath Ledger? So, so much.
Is Tom Hardy Nietzsche's superman? Too soon to tell! Probably yes....

4421956,5,B004LWZWGK,"The Dark Knight Rises provides a stunning conclusion to the Christopher Nolan The Dark Knight Trilogy. In it,we get to see Nolan retreats into conventionality as he somehow decides not to take too much risk after the success of the first two films. But nevertheless,it provides us a great story especially when Bruce Wayne decides to don the mask as Batman after an 8-year absence from Gotham City with the emergence of a mercenary whose objective is to destroy Gotham City with a thermonuclear weapon named Bane which solidifies the Dark Knight trilogy. It definitely has an intelligent screenplay that provides the viewers a great movie that would be find other filmmakers surpass the high standard it left on screen.",1413936000,,719,5.0

I would never believe Bane is the same actor from Inception or This Means War. Banes voice, the way they use the camera to make Bane fill the lens is awesome. Catwoman is dope too. I think Anne Hathaway is dead sexy baby, yeah. Im not sure if the Batman movies will ever be redone. Maybe never, maybe not for a long time, maybe soon. Who knows. That said, this is an a great ending to a new style. Well played Mr. Nolan. The opening sequence to TDK was sweet. The opening sequence to TDKR was somehow even better. Pick this one up.

While ""The Dark Knight"" received a great amount of praise, I found it entertaining but not as good as part 1.  I was pleasantly surprised that this final instalment of the trilogy is excellent and is my favorite of the trilogy.
This movie is consistently entertaining and there is certainly some surprises throughout.  I found Bane to be an intimidating villain.  The whole movie was set up very nicely for the thrilling conclusion.
As far as the Blu-ray, the audio and video is excellent.  I didn't watch the extras.  There are several versions of this blu-ray set as Best Buy has an exclusive steelbook, Target had a book style packaging, and there was also another collector's packaging with the bat cowl.

I was pleasantly surprised that this movie was the best out of the trilogy.  I highly recommend it.",1412726400,2,930,4.7625
4422068,4,B004LWZWGK,"Not much to add, but it's entirely American an epic--full of optimism and ""good-guy-has-the last-word"" sort. Movies like this expresses about our cultural belief as a nation, our desire to be on the good side, to win against odds and to be able to find a hero who could make it despite all odds. The individual's rise from the pit could not be more symbolic. The story was good, despite being a comic genre. To the director's credit, he was successful in fusing many contemporary socio-political elements in the scenes. However, I wish we could do without the femme fatale character, who in the end was seen to be quite a tamed cat.
Anyway, not bad as  a snack movie. Ideally deserves to get 3.5, but I am being generous for liking it's pure entertainment value, and giving it 4. None should blame you if you give 3 stars though.:-)",1412726400,,832,4.546666666666667

The only reason it didn't win an Oscar was because all the actors lived. The opening scene I have watched literally 20 times. Tom Hardy's choice for Bane's voice at first confuses you then delights you and finally you are forced to emulate it non-stop. Its just a great moive, and hands down the best Batman movie every made. Now its time for Affleck to ruin the series just like Schumacher, Clooney, and Kilmer ruined Michael Keaton and Tim Burton's series.

Jonathan Nolan's screenplay is nothing short of a masterpiece, and brother Christopher Nolan's direction is flawless. It is a cinematic tour de force. The blend of drama with intense action will keep you at the edge of your seat while obscure plot twists will keep you guessing and leave you astonished.

Performances by the star-studded cast were thoroughly convincing and brilliant. Heath Ledger's maniacal portrayal of the Joker is legendary; Christian Bale leaves Michael Keaton in the dust in his role as the caped crusader; Aaron Eckhart made me a firm believer in Harvey Dent, and Gary Oldman was very impressive as the steadfast Lieutenant Gordan.

4422231,1,B004LWZWGK,"This film proved beyond all doubt that the importance of a good screenplay is 100% negligible in Hollywood.
There was a time when writing was considered the most important element in making a good picture. Now, the weaker the script the better!

Batman Begins - You could tell they put some time and effort in the writing, maybe because they felt the pressure of trying to live up to or surpass Tim Burton's Batman films? The result was pretty good. Probably my favorite Batman film ever because the writing, acting, and directing were overall well thought-out and executed.

The Dark Knight - Well, the quality of the writing dropped considerably compared to the first one, but because Heath Ledger was so damn good as The Joker, his performance alone made it look like a fantastic film. But now imagine that film without Heath as The Joker, and it gets pretty dull fast.

And now my friends, on to... The Dark Knight Rises. The final film of Mr. Nolan's trilogy. The Dark Knight ended with Batman racing off, escaping the police, because he was going to take the blame for Harvey Dent's murders to protect Harvey's good image, which is a ludicrous concept in itself, but okay I'll go with it. So going with it... The Dark Knight Rises, it's going to open with something that links us to the cliffhanger from the last film. Right?... Nope. It opens with Bruce Wayne limping with a cane eight years later. No explanation whatsoever. I couldn't have come up with a lazier intro to Batman than that. But there's the big brawny bad guy who's introduced as some indestructible force. Cool right?... Well he speaks like a garage sale version of Darth Vader, has a soft spot for hot young villainous chicks, and he loses the battle at the end pretty easily. Lame. Catwoman is sexy. The best thing in the whole film is her looks. Robin. Oh they don't dare call him that. They don't dare put a mask on him either. I guess he's too cool for that. Lame. This is a Batman movie, put a mask on Robin at least one time in the three hour movie for crying out loud. Now the plot. There's plenty of reviews already about the plot, so no need for me to repeat the... plot. Wait. There was a plot? Oh yeah there was. There was?

I think George Clooney showed more passion as Batman than Mr. Bale did in this film. He seriously looked bored in this one. Probably because he knew the script was awful.

One star is seriously a generous rating... but...

FOR FANS OF COMEDY! THIS MOVIE IS HILARIOUS! I haven't laughed so hard in years! Re-watch the film with an openness to all the unintentional comedic elements, and it really is brilliant! Come to think of it, it's possible that Mr. Nolan and Mr. Bale conspired to make a comedy out of it, without telling the fans it's really a comedy. Well then if this is the case, this movie gets FIVE STARS!",1409875200,3,2827,4.490272373540856

4422263,3,B004LWZWGK,I have a lot of trouble watching this film because it always serves as a reminder of the massacre at the Aurora Theater and that hits too close to home. This isn't the movies fault. My big problem is the totally bogus ending. If time was critical to fly the nuclear weapon out of the city I doubt that Batman would stop for time to have a kiss. Assuming a small nuclear weapon it would have to be taken a distance of 20 miles minimum to be safe for the city  to survive. A Jet going 600 mph would go 19.5 miles in the 1:57 minutes shown on the countdown clock. and Batman's aircraft wasn't going anything like that speed. How did he escape the detonation ? Jump out over the Bay shortly after takeoff and use a Bat Chute while his aircraft flew away on autopilot ? Did Scotty beam him aboard the Enterprise  at the last second ? While I can suspend belief on most movies of this type the director stretched the blanket until it ripped in two on this movie ending. Bruce sat in the pit way too long.,1409443200,,998,4.16580310880829

That said, in each of the movies, for some reason, there's one stand out actor who really nails the his/her character.

In Batman Begins, thankfully, it's Christian Bale who really brings Batman to life and establishes a baseline for the trilogy.

In Dark Knight, it's Heath Ledger as the Joker who...wow.

In Dark Knight Rises, it's, surprisingly, Anne Hathaway who manages to take something from each of the iterations of Catwoman and find the true Selina Kyle beneath...the guile...the grace...the genius...the nonchalance...the frenzy... How about a Catwoman movie?",1406419200,,736,5.066115702479339

DC stands for dark comics and that's what this story line was supposed to be was dark, it was made by the same guy who did sin city for crying out loud (we're talking about the comic series here for a moment).

There are definite slower parts in this one but, overall, the story line is excellent and it clocks in at an impressive 2 hours and 45 minutes. Christian Bale, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman shine as Batman/Bruce Wayne, Alfred and Lucius Fox, respectively. Gary Oldman portrays James Gordon perfectly and Anne Hathaway was beautifully cast as Catwoman/Selina Kyle. For the dark and mercenary Bale (Tom Hardy) my only complaint about him is not his acting, but that he wears a mask and his voice is at times muffled too much and a bit hard to follow/understand. I'll not cover the plot here, as the editorial review (just above the customer review section) does that. Suffice it to say that the plot is excellent and the movie is captivating and should be in collections of anyone who enjoys a great super hero movie (along with ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight""). As a note, the image of the movie case (as of this writing) only says ""Blu-ray Disc,"" but it is a multi-disc package, with the Blu-ray movie disc, the Blu-ray Special Features disc and the DVD movie disc, as well as the UV copy (my code says good until Dec 4, 2014).

Overall this is a good movie, however there is some weak acting from the female roles in this movie. Neither of them were very convincing of their portrayal as a criminal.

Pros:
Great finish to the series
Good acting in most roles
Entertaining storyline

Cons:
Odd Music
Unconvincing villains

4422601,1,B004LWZWGK,"My son wanted to watch this, so I did... What motivates Bane to destroy a city with 10 million residents?  That's really the question that you ought to answer when you consider this movie.  Is it greed? Is it revenge? Is it lust? Is it class envy?

Much to my surprise it was for the love of a little girl.

Right.

Because so many of us grown men decide to become homicidal maniacs because we want to protect a little girl.

Besides the unexplained fact that Bane has super-human strength... Besides the silly, unanswered, ""how does Bane EAT with a mask on his face?"" Besides all these things, the whole plot and the whole reason for tension is the ridiculous notion that this guy is motivated to destroy an entire city because he wanted to protect a little girl.

So, why do I give this just one star? Because the whole world that Bruce Wayne lives in is fake. The characters are fake.  Especially Bane.  And the message is that if you care about a little girl, and things don't go your way, you might become a homicidal maniac... (""But Bane was the bad guy!"") Right- all the more reason I don't like this.

The movie blurs right from wrong. Was Bane a good guy to care about the little girl?  Was the girl good when she loved Bruce Wayne? Was Catwoman good or was she just stealing to pay her rent?  Was it okay to trick the whole city into believing that Batman was the bad guy and Harvey Dent was the good guy?

The only good part of this movie is that without thinking deeply about it, the casual movie-goer will leave thinking that class envy was the root of Bane's rage and that class envy only ends in destruction.",1405641600,,1623,4.3344370860927155

4422744,1,B004LWZWGK,"I am note sure where to begin. I truly hated this movie for many reasons big and small.

First this Movie was BORING..........Only 1 action fight scene and an other Boring scene where batman gets destroyed by Bane.  This is a Batman Movie for Pete's sake!.........

No real special effects to make you say WOW. This is a Batman movie not a TV drama.......made the movie even more boring.

Plot was Dumb, very dumb. Very Boring. Can you say sleep aide?

Ok not my last problems with this movie; This is a Batman Movie. Hello??? Batman are you in this one??

This is a batman movie and it should be about Batman not 3 hours about  Bane or Talia al Ghul. It was basically a 3 hour back story on Bane and Talia al Ghul.

As far as I am concern the only good Christian Bale batman movie was ""The Dark Knight"". ""Batman Begins"" was fair but not near as good as ""The Dark night"".",1403827200,,871,4.236363636363636
4422745,5,B004LWZWGK,"It's a really fun movie with a super-cool villain, Bane, who's written in such a way that, while you don't agree with what he's doing, you understand where he's coming from.",1403827200,,173,4.612903225806452
4422776,5,B004LWZWGK,"This is a fitting end to the trilogy, although it has some plot holes.  Christopher Nolan hasn't made one bad movie if you ask me.",1403740800,,130,4.2

4422778,3,B004LWZWGK,"This movie is a bit of an anomaly to me. It's a very strong and worthy story, but where this film falls short is the little things that make a movie tick.

First and foremost is the atrociousness of much of the dialogue.  Almost everything that comes out of Michael Caine's mouth made me cringe. Practically all of his lines are these metaphorical soliloquies that don't resemble anything a real person might say. Not to mention his constant whining..The rest of the cast does a decent job, but so much of it seems forced... Almost as though the writers were trying so hard not to fumble the always risky ""third film"" that they didn't realize they were running toward the wrong end zone.

This also plays into the second problem, being the writers having to top the second film. The Dark Knight can easily be described as an ""epic"". I don't think they understood the magnitude of their responsibility of having to ""out-epic"" the second film. So to take up some of the time, they were almost forced to fill the film with hot air just to take up time. So much could easily have been cut as meaningless or just plain cheesey, when the second flowed perfectly, each scene being important.

Most of the other short comings were semantics that you may not notice until the 3rd or 4th viewing. I also find it funny how this trilogy has been plagued by voice problems. First we had Bale's overdone ""Mickey from the Rocky movies"" Batman voice. Now we have Bane who sounds like a 70 year old Englishman.  It's not integral, but can be annoying. And did anyone notice that Levitt was the only street cop that never wore a hat? He is who he is, so they wanted to make sure his pretty face is in clear view to appeal to that 12-18 year old girl demographic.

All in all, the movie is definitely worth seeing but as far as replay value, I doubt I'd ever have the urge to just pop it in for another view. Stick with the first two. Or better yet, forget all three and stick with the Burton/Keaton masterpieces.",1403481600,,1994,4.434426229508197
4422779,5,B004LWZWGK,"Christian Bale is the best 'Batman"" to date.  I don't think anyone else can top him.  This Trilogy is to only Batman series that I have bought.  I hated the other ""Batman"" movies.  This is the set to buy - Christian Bale all the way.",1402963200,,233,4.111111111111111
4422780,4,B004LWZWGK,"It is obviously hard to follow up the ""Dark Knight"" and probably the best villain performance of all time.  The Dark Knight Rises is a good and entertaining movie, even if predictable.  I really liked that different elements of the series were incorporated into this plot.  Christian Bale is very strong again, and Bane is portrayed pretty well (although I think his voice could have been a little more menacing).  Overall it's good, but don't expect it to be better than the Dark Knight.  I wish Christopher Nolan had signed on to do more and continue the story with Robin, that would have been interesting to see his take on that.  Now we are stuck with Ben Affleck ruining another super hero (yippee).",1402963200,,704,4.682926829268292

4422784,5,B004LWZWGK,"The only bad thing with this movie was the length.  It could have used a wee bit of editing.  But that's a minor quibble.  I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie, but it turned out to be quite compelling, much more than I expected, though no where in the league of the terrifyingly good performances previously with the Joker (Ledger), which would be hard to beat.  Still, this movie is wonderfully filmed, the special effects are spectacular, and the action is heart-pounding.  As ever, we are also introduced to more of Batman's ""toys,"" but the heart of the movie remains his dark soul and his sense of injustice that needs to be righted...even if he starts off lost at the beginning of this edition.

Some spoilers:

Batman has disappeared, blamed for the death of the ""hero,"" Harvey Dent.  Gotham used this death to change laws to lock up the worst criminals in Gotham, making the city safe enough that Batman no longer seems to even be needed.  Bruce Wayne has become a recluse, locked away in his mansion, uncaring of what his foundation has gotten up to, and has lost his edge as he lost his rage that actually fueled his being Batman.  He seems washed up, beaten up, and uncaring.  A bad guy named Bane comes to town and first takes over the stock market, then the city with the threat of a bomb, all seemingly in the name of the people fighting against the wealthy of Gotham (very 99% versus the 1%).  Of course, this is really a lie.  Bane and his crew have other agendas in mind than the poor versus the rich.  As a result, Batman comes out of retirement but still seems lost and not up to his usual fighting skills.  Can he rediscover the inner strength and rage for justice that made him such a powerful figure of the night?  And what does this have to do with the League of Darkness that Batman had long thought defeated?

In many ways, Bane represents Batman as he used to be--filled with a strength born of darkness--and Bruce Wayne must undergo his own journey out of the Pit in order to be able to defeat him.  Wayne says he is unafraid of death, but seems unwilling to embrace life either.  His death wish has played out in previous movies and now he must find another reason to go on.  I really enjoyed the subtext of this in the movie.  As well as Alfred's struggle to save him and his urging him to find something to live for.

But the best bits in the movie I think have to do with Catwomen, wonderfully played by Hathaway, and I love how her goggles flipped up to look like little cat's ears.  There is, as ever, the push and pull of attraction between her and Batman that we saw even in the original tv show.

The movie ends with a possible lead into another movie.  I say...go for it!  And I hope that Catwoman is in that one, too.",1402358400,,2763,4.34765625

Mr. Bale - one is acutely made aware of - a speech impediment [?] - which is immensely distracting - especially in close-up.  Anne Hathaway chews her way through the scenery - and provides some eye-candy, one pines for the cool humor of Julie Newman/Michelle Pfeiffer and even Halle Berry..

4422803,5,B004LWZWGK,"I watched The Dark Knight Rises, and my first impression was that this is a well-made movie overall. The movie seemed to engage the audience throughout the movie with fast-paced plots and several moments of surprise.

The movie featured actors and actresses like Christian Bale and Tom Hardy who both contributed greatly to the thrill and twist in the plot.  Especially, the plot was very interesting to me because it was something that I had not experienced before in any other hero movies. I can say that this was partially due to not seeing any trailers previously, and I strongly recommend to do so for the thrill and excitement of the movie. In addition, the major theme of the movie involving fear was also very clear and understandable throughout the movie. At the end, you will leave with the feeling of relief and accomplishment.

However, some factors that hindered the focus of the movie was the length and sudden changes that the audience must deduce what had happened without any explanation. For some people, the movie can feel a bit long and tiresome, but I want to say that there are a lot of scenes and hidden messages that Batman learns during his adventure. Also, some people may be confused because of the connection to previous series. In this case, I recommend you to look at the short summary of the previous movie before watching, and you will most definitely understand how it does a superb job entertaining the audience.",1401494400,,1446,4.776

Christopher Nolan did a great job at completing the trilogy with this film. Most people thought that The Dark Knight would cast a shadow over this film because of how great it was, but I promise this movie delivered and went beyond that! Although the Joker (Heath Ledger) from the previous film is probably the best villain in all three of the movies, I think Bane (Tom Hardy) was just as evil and perfect for this finale. Nolan also did a fantastic job at combining parts of the other two films into The Dark Knight Rises by using flashbacks and different references to those movies throughout. Some parts may be confusing if you haven't seen the first two movies, so I suggest you watch them first. Most people look forward to the villains in these movies, but I'm fascinated by Batman (Christian Bale).",1401408000,,945,4.597633136094674

Batman (a man trained in deception/martial arts) goes head-first into a fist fight with a man who is physically stronger. After he gets the snot kicked out of him, he decides to use his brain. 2. He has stopped being Batman for eight years. Why? Because he lost his girlfriend. Um, he lost his parents and that MADE him Batman. 3. His body is beat to crap. He goes to the doctor and has all kinds of injuries. Sohe sustained these during his two years as Batman and didn't heal over the eight-year vacation?  4. Alfred bails on Bruce because he's afraid to see him get killed; which nearly gets Bruce killed. Miranda/Talia sees Bruce when he returns to Gotham, but doesn't inform her partner Bane that Batman is back? I could go on.

Here, Batsy's numero uno nemesis is replaced regrettably with a far less worthy one, with the most mundane name in the history of bad guys to boot - Bane. Why not name the guy Smith or Thompson? Anyhow, we are faced here with the question of whether we want to or not of how it would have been had Ledger lived. It is in the back of our minds throughout the movie. For Christ's sake, if Bruce Wayne goes into hiding from the entire world we would expect the person who eventually lures him out to be much meaner than Bane who is nothing but a huge hunk of lumber with the strength of 10 Hulk Hogans. Well then, why not just get 10 Hulk Hogans? At least the Joker had a brain and it wasn't all about pitting triceps against biceps. We applaud Nolan for doing a different take on the Superhero genre with its operatic tone and admittedly moving ending but alas, Ledger was missed sorely.

4422969,5,B004LWZWGK,"""The Dark Knight Rises"" at least in my humble opinion, is my favorite of the Christian Bale- Chrisopher Nolan trilogy.  The Bane character is fierce and awesome, and all though the Catwoman character brought little to the story in terms of depth (& the romance seems implausible) she still came off as very sexy and quite dynamic.

 Amazon.com Commenter ""Superhiro"" makes a number of very valid points in his criticism of this film, including the question of why Batman-Bruce Wayne is in such a terrible physical state eight years after his battle against the Joker and Harvey Dent.  The very reason why the plot and situations in ""TDKR"" are all because of the Joker (the late Heath ledger) but as ""Superhiro"" mentioned he isn't even referenced nor looked back upon at all in this film.

 Bane's sudden appearance, and ""Terrorist Group"" plot make an excellent villain angle, but why after 8 years since the night Batman-Bruce fought Harvey Dent is Bane making his appearance?

 The ""League of Shadows"" Ninja Clan theme was very much like the original comic book, so unlike the Michael Keaton - Jack Nicolson 1980's version we get to see the character's more detailed origins.

And I for one unlike others who may have very much enjoyed this film also, felt the police officer ""Robin"" character was totally useless and not needed in this film at all.  The fact that he alone figured out after a brief encounter with Bruce Wayne as a boy, that Bruce was indeed Batman was completely ubsurd and not believable.  Is everyone in Gotham City an idiot except this character?

What I also enjoyed about this film is how Nolan uses real life and modern world issues, and places the positives and negatives of the out comes of certain beliefs or political policies in these movies.  The Harvey Dent Act is clearly art copying life, with the ""Patriot Act"", and the complex problems of dealing with Terrorism in a 21st Century America.

 The martial arts action, and stunts in this film are first rate, and the performences of actors such as Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman, and the brilliantly great Michael Caine are amazing.

Five stars for the ""The Dark Knight Rises"".",1396137600,,2159,4.8102981029810294

I'm sure most people that will see it have by now, as I'm sure that reviews w/ film details have been posted ad nauseum,  so I won't bother w/ that here.

Anne Hathaway was 70% Cocoa chocolate in that Catwoman feline suit, but the supporting cast were varied, from a convincing Gary Oldman, to a standard Morgan Freeman and over acting by ""my name is. . .""

A much more coherent film than the over praised 'The Dark Knight' and was suitable for re-watching, proving value for money.
This is an entertaining film, and artistically predicable. How would it all work if they dressed Batman in white?",1394755200,,717,4.829268292682927
4423032,5,B004LWZWGK,"To conclude the Dark Knight trilogy with ""The Dark Knight Rises"", Chris Nolan has offered us a perfectly gritty view of who Batman has become. Through the previous two films, Christian Bale/Bruce Wayne, has become overwhelmingly isolated and secluded. He has chosen to live in a self-imposed sheltered life behind mansion walls. The Batman, his alter-ego, which once was a symbol, has become his demon. Michael Caine/Alfred, nails the role of Bruce's trusted confidant and friend to perfection. Over the years between ""The Dark Knight"" until now, he has played the role of father figure to Bruce, in attempts to have Bruce regain a ""normal"" life. To no avail. Through the entirety of the three films, the cast of incredibly fine actors have found their marks on their respective roles. Fully 3 dimensional and completely believable.

As the years have worn on both men, Batman and Bruce, the physical toll on Bruce's body has been tremendous. The years have taken a much more staid affect on his emotional stability. Not to mention the lack of cognizance as to Wayne Enterprises functionality any longer. Bruce has simply fallen out of touch with reality. Feeling that the Batman is no longer needed or wanted, Bruce is lost. Bale portrays both Wayne and Batman as brooding men. A bit too far, but the Dark Knight, as told in the Frank Miller stories, is a confident, stoic and sometimes apathetic man. Although Bruce has had a love and lost her, he knows he cannot afford to get to close again. Much like any superhero. Said superhero or anti-hero, must remain hyper-vigilant to protect the love interest from any manner of horrors from the villainous activities they fight. Batman is doomed to be lonely and accept his fate. That is until Anne Hathaway/Selina/Catwoman makes her appearance!

Anne Hathaway's Catwoman is a sleek, sharp minded and sexy role. Unlike any previous attempts. Hathaway comes off as if she is a bit modest, but knows exactly what she wants. And how to get it. The kick-ass way! She is glamorous in her black leather. A cutting edge Catwoman who isn't sure which side of the line to walk. Jumping from side to side at whim. Scowling her prey with night-vision glasses, (doubles for Cat ears), she moves with stealth. I find it greatly appealing that Hathaway's Catwoman is a strong female character. Strong-willed but unsure of herself. She has techniques of fighting skills that match Batman, mechanics of martial arts and the grace of a ballet dancer. A true match for Bruce, Batman/Catwoman. Now that's a dynamic duo! As the film progresses, Batman and Bruce both begin to see Selina/Catwoman as an interesting female with a seductive beauty. Or just a jewel thief?

A definite plus, is the introduction of the ""Bat."" The newest toy in Batman's arsenal. A flying hover-type craft. One that can also move through the streets and between buildings with ease. With Batman in the air now, Catwoman on the ""Bat-Pod"" in the streets, they both pursue the ""Tumbler's"". The very Tumblers that saved the day in the ""Dark Knight"", Bane has captured them for his own means of destruction. There are some very cool CG scenes with ALL of Batman's vehicles in use. A very compelling notion to ponder here, just how deadly Batman's arsenal really is when it is used against him and Gotham City! Batman has upped the ante with the new ""Bat"" and the havoc that it and the Tumbler's make, is truly awesome! Culminating in the last few minutes of the film!

Chris Nolan has given some freedoms to the actors that have built their roles over the previous films. The character arcs are developed and pulled from the Frank Miller story, ""Year One"" and others. Done with honor! Of course, with the help of CG, only so much breadth can be splashed on the screen. In the comics, Bane is a hulking character. He is one of the only foes that has actually beaten Batman. In the comics, graphic novels or animated series, Bane is an enormous, raging freak. About twice the size of Batman and capable of super-human feats of strength. Tom Hardy was a good pick for the role of Bane. As he tries to evince Batman and the citizens of Gotham, his adamancy of fulfilling Ras' Al Guhl's.destiny, the annihilation of Gotham City.

Hardy's acting was more out of ""eye expressions."" Wearing that tightly fitted mask for the film, he relied on only eye movements to visually express his mouthed words. Quite inventive and talented. Difficult yet proficient. For the viewer who is not familiar with the Bane character, Tom Hardy made him fairly plausible, even if his physical stature completely missed the comic version. Whenever Bane was on-screen, the mood was palpable. His voice through the mask was taunting the viewers and those he intended to terrorize. Or kill. Hans Zimmer's scores throughout all three films are some of the best I've ever heard! The Bane score was dark and seething with impending doom. As the inevitable fight scenes with Batman approached, the tension would build under the musical score, heightening the volume of physical and emotional pressure. Even if Hardy was unable to display the physical comic sight of Bane, he put such raw power into every punch his fists could pound. Utilizing camera trickery, certain size differentials were used to desirous effects. All-in-all, the Bane character was rather convincing. Wearing various military gear and clothing he acquired from years on the prowl. Scavenging whatever Bane was able to, kept any necessary items for later purposes. The character arc for Bane was right out of the pages from MANY stories. Long before ""Year One."" I personally enjoy Bane because he is one that can take on Batman, physically, one-on-one, and win. Batman isn't the strongest on Bane's block!

As Bane was found, trained and eventually excommunicated by ""The League of Shadows"", there was another found with him in the Pit of Hell. A young girl. She had climbed out of the pit, (the only one so far), found her Mercenary father,  thus saving Bane too. Bane's cohort, friend and whatever else, Marrion Cotillard/Miranda/Talia. She enters the film unobtrusively. Having no real origin story into Wayne Enterprises, we find her making several attempts to gain Bruce's attention. She tries to spark a conversation with him at a function in his own mansion, but still nothing. Not until things begin to go south for Bruce, does Miranda begin her journey into Bruce's wealth and mind. Finally, into his heart. For Bruce, this the one place a woman can no longer enter. His heart has been broken, betrayed and blackened. Yet savvy Miranda has ulterior motives. She swoops in like a bat. Unlike Catwoman who is surreptitious. Miranda makes quick work of undoing Bruce Wayne's life and wealth.
Her character is little more than 2 dimensional. She is not very congenial throughout 2/3 of the film. While we see her as a loathing woman with dark plans. Cotillard doesn't try to portray her role an ounce of affability. On screen, she is plainly, just there. In the final scenes, her ""coming-out"" as Talia, still misses its mark. As she is sliding the knife into Batman's side, explaining why using a knife is so much more pleasurable, (slowly killing a victim), Bane has a tear rolling down his cheek. In this heavy dramatic moment, I still couldn't define ""evil"" in her. Yet to make big, bad Bane cry? Sorry. This was the only miscast role in the entire Batman trilogy Nolan made!

As for the remaining cast, well, Joseph Gordon-Levitt/Blake Robinson/(Robin) was a perfect ""hot-head"" cop that was so desperately needed in Gotham. Much to Gary Oldman/Commissioner Gordon's playbook! Gordon-Levitt would be an excellent Robin or NightWing in the upcoming ""Superman vs. Batman"" movie! He played a tough, determined and unafraid rookie cop. Ready to mix-it-up with some good, old-fashioned brawling. The beginnings of a hero. Gary Oldman IS Commissioner Gordon. I couldn't imagine anyone else filling his shoes. Last, but never least,  is Morgan Freeman/Lucius Fox. He is by far, one of the greatest actors of this generation!

""The Dark Knight Rises"" is the end of a trilogy that is more than the sum of it's parts. It has created a template for other comic-to-screen adaptations to live up to. A new standard. Be they from DC, CapCom or Marvel. When things are done with perfection, you follow it. Mr. Nolan has delivered three films that developed into history now. Any and all films in the future will not only have to match, but try to surpass these achievement's with excellence.

Many have spoken that Bale's Batman was too brooding and depressing. I think of it this way. Were anyone to carry such a burden of being the Batman, keep it a secret, unable to love or be loved, that is fertile grounds for depression. Sure, having immense wealth is wonderful! But if you are alone, cannot share it with a loved one, there's depression. Dressing up in a cape and Cowl, hiding ones identity to fight injustice, there's depression. Watching your parents murdered as a youth, having Night Terrors from it your entire life, you would be brooding too!
So, Mr. Bale has done justice to the Dark Knight after all! It shall be very interesting to see if Ben Afflek can carry the torch, and become the next Batman in the upcoming movie?

Anne Hathaway was yet again a delightful surprise. She was a joy to watch, and a fun addition to this strange twist in the Batman series.

The movie quality and streaming was completely fine. The price was completely fine. Everything was just about ok. I do remember that I was eating a calzone from the place across the street and it wasn't that good though. So I dunno, I guess that's all I have.

I originally saw this movie at the theatre in the heart of Hollywood, CA with Jon from Knife Fight. That's a good band. Pro-Tip: If you google ""knife fight+discography+blogspot"" you can download all their music for free. I probably shouldn't tell you that but I like the band a lot better than this movie. I'll just float him a few dollars next time I see him so I got you covered don't worry.

Quick movie review: I wasn't that into it. I like the first two, but felt that this was just a standard silly movie thrown together to make money and end Christopher Nolan's contract with making Batman movies. It did the job I guess.

4423195,3,B004LWZWGK,"It's been eight years since Batman rode away into the night, taking the blame for the deceased Harvey Dent's murders so Dent may remain the inspirational symbol Gotham City needs to pull itself out of the thralls of crime and corruption. Bruce Wayne has hung up the cape and cowl, ceased development on a clean-energy fusion device his company, Wayne Enterprises, has been researching, and has become a Howard Hughes-like recluse, nursing a crippled knee from his last encounter with Dent and a broken heart over the loss of his potential love interest, Rachel Dawes. Gotham uses Harvey's memory to pass the Dent Act, legislation that has kept the gangsters and mob thugs that Dent imprisoned indefinitely. Crime is at an all-time low. It seems that Batman has won and is no longer needed.

But a fire rises. The emergence of professional cat burglar *hint hint* Selina Kyle heralds the arrival of Bane, a masked, muscled mercenary with ties to Bruce's past with the League of Shadows. Bane is amassing an army in the subway tunnels beneath Gotham and plans to hold the city hostage using the nuclear core of Wayne's fusion device. So Bruce must come out of retirement, rev up the Batpod once again, and take on Bane to save the city from total decimation.

Like Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises borrows elements of seminal Batman works from the past. The Dark Knight Returns (in which an aging Bruce Wayne returns to a life a crimefighting after quitting due to a personal tragedy), Batman: Knightfall (where Bane ""breaks the Bat,"" thoroughly defeating Batman and leaving him paralyzed from a broken spine), and Batman: No Man's Land (where a major disaster ravages Gotham, leaving it cut off from the rest of the world and ruled by gang warfare) all lend story points to Rises. Nolan and collaborator David Goyer mix these elements into a single story, trying to throw as much adversity at the Caped Crusader as possible, since it was fairly clear that this would be the final installment of a trilogy.

And you can sorta tell that Nolan is getting tired of the Batman world, like he doesn't have much else to say about it. So it's probably good that he ended with this film instead of milking the story for cash and resulting in an embarassment of Batman & Robin proportions. What's odd is that it seems that he's constrained himself with his ""gritty, realistic"" approach to this franchise that many attempts to stretch the boundaries of believability or make leaps of logic seem like an affront to his own storytelling style. Bane's attempt to essentially use identity fraud to bankrupt Bruce Wayne seems like an easy fix that could be straightened out rather quickly in reality, and how a broke Bruce Wayne manages to find his way back to Gotham after being imprisoned on the other side of the planet seems highly contrived, though many have used the ""Because he's Batman!"" excuse to fall back on. Heck, with modern airline security, how does a guy like Bane get in and out of the country to deposit Bruce in an Asian prison without any red flags going up? A supporting character manages to figure out that Bruce Wayne is Batman after only meeting Bruce years ago and without using much deducting skill or reasoning, yet no police detectives or even Comissioner Gordon himself can figure it out? I mean, the fact that Bruce and Batman show up in Gotham and then disappear from public life at the same time, not to mention that few people other than Bruce Wayne can afford the kind of tech that Batman uses should be an obvious giveaway. There are plenty more inconsistencies that glare at you as you watch this, and you wonder how the writer/director of a film with such a tight narrative as Inception can allow himself to make a film with so many holes in it.

Tom Hardy's Bane is an imposing enough villain, but his master plan for Gotham isn't a very strong one. Spoilers follow, so be warned. Bane's plan is to use a nuclear bomb to hold the city hostage, and portrays himself as a revolutionary figure trying to start an uprising against Gotham's rich and corrupt while the rest of Gotham's citizens desperately struggle against each other to survive. However, the bomb is going to detonate on its own after five months, so why bother waiting that long and just detonate it anyway if your ultimate goal is to destroy the city no matter what? To watch a city that has been given false hope slowly destroy itself? Why bother with that when the bomb will still go off? It feels some contrived and overly complicated.

Also, for a Batman movie, there isn't much of Batman in it. As stated earlier, Bruce gave up being Batman for years, so the film picks up with Wayne as a recluse, and it takes some time before he puts the cape back on again. And when he does cape up, he shows up for roughly two or three scenes before he's taken out of commission once again for most of the film's midsection until the finale. This might have been necessary to generate a conflict big enough to seem too much for Batman and his allies to overcome, but they spent much of Batman Begins building up Bruce's evolution into Batman that you'd think we'd at least get to see more Batman now.

On the bright side, you have to admit that Nolan has guts for giving the audience a definitive end to a superhero franchise. Franchises like these tend to keep going until there's a revolving door of creators, the same roles have been recast numerous times to maintain the eternal youth of the main characters, and all creativity peters out as the films settle into formula until all lucrative profit dissipates. And now that this franchise has started the trend of ""reboots"" as a way to renew tired franchises, it's as if Nolan is cinematically conceding that even though the people who make them will get old and die, these characters and stories will keep going on forever. He's getting out on his own terms, ending the story his way, and readily handing over the Batman story to whoever will take it on next. Even the plot admits this, as it continues with the notion that Batman is an idea, a symbol. Batman is more than the man behind the mask. That man will get old and die, but Batman will live on as long as someone else takes up the mantle. So as Bruce Wayne passes on the cape and cowl, Christopher Nolan is handing over the keys to the Batcave to the next filmmaker to take over the legend of the Batman.

There are a number of extras that discuss the film's characters and themes, but the best is the 10-minute Batmobile documentary. It explores all the iterations of Batman's most famous piece of tech and what it has meant to people over the years, and showcases the first time all the real Batmobiles, from the Adam West 60's series all the way to the Dark Knight Trilogy's Tumbler, have been collected in one place. At one point, the Tumbler is taken to a children's hospital, and you never thought you'd get misty-eyed watching a documentary about the Batmobile until now.

4423201,5,B004LWZWGK,Im a huge comic book fan so naturally I like come book movies. But alot of the time comic book movies don't messure up. This time DC got it right with the director and the cast and screen writers. This is the last of the Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale batman movies ending on a epic note and the longgest runing time of all three movies. I love how all three movies mix the best batman story arcs making a begininning a middle and a end. In this epic conculsion they mix the story arc of the Knightfall series and the story of noman's land mixing both stories and making something both epic both a comic book lover and someone just enjoying a movie could love. The characters are just as good has ever ( But maybe not as good as Heath Leager's Joker). Tom Hardy as Bane is so Meneasing and a force to be reckoned with. Batman has finally met his match with Bane and the Batman in this film isn't the bad ass he was in the The Dark Knight. Batman already has his hands full with Bane he also as to deal with the catwoman( Ann Hathaway) but they never say catwoman in the movie. A epic movie to a epic set of films alot of surpises and things you won't see coming or maybe you will. Still one of the best comic book movies ever made along with the Dark Knight and The Man Of Steel. A must see for comic book fans and just plain Batman fans.,1392249600,5,1344,4.114068441064639

The Dark Knight Rises is the darkest of the three films and I appreciate what it has to offer, especially in our current century, when so much is unbalanced and so many are without hope.

1. Christian Bale once again pulled another great performance as Batman!
2. I also love how both Batman and Bruce Wayne lost pretty much everything,
but by the end of the movie managed to end up on top again, in more than one
way I mean... So, you see no matter how much you loose in life there is
always hope!!!
3. I love how they fit Bane into the story;
 1. Like in the comics:
a. He was a mercenary!
b. He was two steps ahead of almost everything Batman threw at him!
c. He was scary!
d. He performed his signature back-breaking move on Batman!
 2. How they fit him into the movie:
a. He was a former member of the league of shadows!
b. He was too extreme of a monster for Raz' Al Ghoul!
c. Tom Hardy played him perfectly!
3. Anne Hathaway was the perrrrfect woman to play Catwoman/
Selina Kyle!
4. The plot was well written!
5. The battles were well done!
6. Bane, Catwoman, Raz' Al Ghoul, Crane, Talia Ghoul, and
Daget... all in one movie?! WOW!!!!

Even though  I read Christian Bale is a jerk on some movie sets (total turn off like Justin Biebster), he does play an intimidating Batman and a young, cute Bruce Wayne...much better than the previous Batmen. Now that I'm thinking about it, I prefer to watch Michael Keaton's lips in the original Batman mask more than Christian Bales mouth. Batman Begins was good, but I found Katie Holmes a little unbelievable in her role: sweet and innocent Joey from Dawson's Creek in dark Gotham City (I guess that's why she was replaced). Heath Ledger's performance as the iconic villain The Joker in The Dark Knight was Oscar worthy. Two-Face was whiney and I did the happy dance when he died...or did he?! At least, his whiney face didn't come back in the next movie. Maggie Gyllenhaal was a better choice for Rachel...but she should have chosen Batman, just saying.

Anywho, that trip down memory lane leads up to my review of The Dark Knight Rises...my fave!
My first thought: Bane is awesome. Bane has strength, some humor, but I also found some compassion and sympathy for him towards the end...the final reveal. Some say his voice is a Sean Connery wannabe. I disagree. After watching the movie, I found a website that had an audio comparison. It's hard to understand what Tom Hardy (aka Bane) was saying before they redubbed. Oh...and for the girls...Tom Hardy...totally hot! Especially since watching his performance in the movie, This Means War.
I actually liked watching Anne Hathaway for the first time ever without wanting to punch her in the face. Maybe bc her role was slightly insignificant, or she saved Batman's life. She isn't nearly as hot/sexy as Halle Berry's Catwoman performance and silicone suit, but I liked Anne's hair and little cat ears. Then again, I would prob punch her in the face for how she saved Batman's life (no spoilers here). BTW...those goggles she kept dropping down, totally unnecessary.
Joseph Gordon-Whatever is too cute. I just wanted to pinch his cheeks whenever he was on screen and the tv was on mute. I didn't like his Gotham accent. It was like listening to a bad Matt Damon impression. Future Robin maybe?! I'm not so sure he'd be a tights kind a guy...or if I'd want to pinch those cheeks.
Ugh, Joseph G-W's ""boss"", the character named Foley, was annoying and whinier than Two-Face and Foley didn't have half his face melted off. Most of Foley's screen time, he belittles Joseph G-W's character.
Gary Oldman continues his role as The Commish Gordon. Mr. Oldman is awesome in any movie he does.
Lastly, I thought the visual effects were amaze-balls! Obviously, the most memorable was when Bane blew up the football field. I wish all football games were over that fast. Other effects I thought were cool, maybe not special: bridges exploding around the city, the Bat-cycle with Batman riding it (it looked a little too big for Catgirl to handle), and Bane.
Overall, it left the possibility of continuing storylines in the future. If Christopher Nolan decides not utilize his creative writing gift, I think it was a satisfying end to the trilogy.",1388966400,2,3412,4.779661016949152

4423426,5,B004LWZWGK,"**SPOILERS AHEAD**
I loved this movie. I loved the whole trilogy. Christopher Nolan is a fantastic storyteller and director. I feel that the Batman we see in the Nolan Trilogy is The Dark Knight, which is why maybe some of his other attributes might be toned down a little or not shown as much (ala detective Bats). I loved Nolan's approach and world he created around this lovable character to try and pull the superhero genre into a modern, realistic setting. Nolan and Bale both allow to see who the Dark Knight is and why he is a create hero and the lengths he'll go to to protect Gotham. Anne Hatahway's Catwoman, Tom Hardy's Bane, JGL's Robin, Marion Cotillard's Talia al Ghul were an excellent addition to the Dark Knight Trilogy, each doing fantastic in their roles. As always Bale, Caine, and the rest bring their A game to the movie. I will say the movie is not perfect and I will not get into the bogged down details that in the end aren't a huge deal (to me) because this is Nolan's approach and take on Batman and it was excellent! I would have like for Joseph Gordon Levitt's Robin to be actually named Richard 'Dick' Grayson or even Tim Drake but I understand what Nolan was going for and liked it nonetheless. Nolan also did a fantastic job of tying his movies together so it really felt like a complete trilogy, a complete story. And of course as always Hans Zimmer's score was perfect in adding to the Dark Knight franchise. I will miss this Batman and am hopeful that the next Batman will shine in his own way.",1388620800,3,1529,4.444839857651245
4423427,2,B004LWZWGK,The musical score was so intrusive that there were parts of this film that I couldn't hear the dialogue. Story line was muddled and confusing. This is a piece of junk,1388620800,,166,4.387096774193548
4423428,5,B004LWZWGK,"Christopher Nolan immerses you into the comic book.  This is a monumental conclusion to the epic trilogy which has transformed the Batman character from the Tim Burton series of the 90's which all enjoyed.  Nolan in his three films brings the story and technical aspect to a much higher level.

I have not viewed this film since my big screen viewing 18 months ago and after have compared it to the Burton films.  I noticed an impressively stark contrast to the upside in this film.  Watching the Blue Ray version in our home theater was just as impressive and allowed for an appreciation of brilliant and amazing film making.

The Blue Ray Package is in a three disc format.  It employs the Blue Ray disc, DVD disc, and a bonus feature disc.  The latter was worth the price of the package.  Additionally, this package has the Ultraviolet Bonus and App for providing digital collection and exclusive content respectively.

4423433,5,B004LWZWGK,"This is likely the best Batman film production yet; the actors and the acting are sublime, the writing profound and meaningful, if not somewhat enigmatic, the portent of the film is provocative and stimulating, as the film makes you think, and produces a sense of being there or being a part of the film in the moment. The plot deals with an interesting mix of issues, maybe written in by design, or possibly created in default. There is a political undercurrent in this film, as it explores some of the reasonings that fringe poltical or terror organizations may currently portray, (the anti hero or villian in this film portrays this type of agenda). All to say, this film is marvelous, a most serious rendering of Batman, and a very well crafted cinematic film, with full plot, undercurrent plot, and thinking, well worth watching.",1388534400,3,834,4.839160839160839

4423494,5,B004LWZWGK,"I was of a firm mind that the 2nd movie in the series could not be topped but this third and final completely wowed me. The writers did something unexpected by digging really deep into Bruce Wayne's character - the dark abyss that it is. Take away the wealth and privilege, take away the fancy gadgets, take away his health even - and what are you left with? A true superhero with every bit of complex humanity that makes this movie the best yet.
Alfred's tough love - glad to see how his character was given more bite to him. Not just the old, faithful servant in the background. I like what they did with Catwoman's character - gave her some real claws. But really, I still think Michelle Pfeiffer's the best Catwoman ever.
Bane was a very curious villain. Interesting that the director only showed part of his face behind the mask in a fleeting glimpse. Sometimes I couldn't understand what the actor was saying, making it seem like his lines were not dubbed at all, but actually spoken by actor as he was wearing a mask. But after some Googling, it appears that this is the final product after dubbing. Oh, well.
I won't debate whether which performance is better - Ledger's Joker or Hardy's Bane. They're both brilliant in different ways.
The plot is on dizzying hyper drive, with some details going by too fast for me to comprehend. However, it didn't really matter as the movie was one amazing ride.",1388275200,,1406,4.539370078740157

There is a natural flow in the build up and evolution of the characters, including the brilliant performance by Michael Cain as Alfred.  His last exchange with Bruce was terrifyingly touching.

The antagonist, Bane, was imposing on screen, physically, linguistically, and emotionally.  They managed to always make him appear larger than life in all aspects.

Once again, I'm happy that the Catwoman and Robin labels are not attached strictly to the characters...  just as the Joker wasn't referred to as the Joker in The Dark Knight.  I think dropping the labels allows the viewer to focus on the important traits of the character.

The third installment of the Batman trilogy had a lot of hype to live up to, and the special effects and plot of the Dark Knight Rises lived up to its two predecessors. Batman Begins and The Dark Knight were both well received, thus paving the way for a third and final epic finally. To followers of the trilogy this final movie delivered and was a huge hit. If special effects, action, and superheros are up your alley, The Dark Knight Rises would have you on the edge of your seat no matter if you have seen the previous two movies or not.

One of the key factors that makes this movie exceptional is the tremendous cast of return members and new members. Christian Bail once again plays the perfect part of Batman and Bruce Wayne. His personality and character fits this role perfectly and it really shows throughout the film.  Gary Oldman also returns as a familial face in the movie as Commissioner Gordon. His character is a nice contrast of a regular lawkeeper compared to Batman, a vigilante. The two also seem to have a bond that works well on the screen during their few face to face scenes. Anne Hathaway (Catwoman) and Marion Cotillard (Miranda) are nice additions to the cast. Although the idea of Anne Hathaway playing Catwoman in the movie didn't settle well with many critics, I believe that her superior acting skills definitely adds to this movies outstanding cast. In a series of movies that is traditionally dominated by male actors, it is nice to see a few key women thrown into the mix; they add a personality that simply can not be brought out by a male character. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is also introduced to the series; he plays Blake who is made out to be the predecessor of Batman at the end of the movie. Finally two very well known and respected actors return to the screen, Morgan Freeman (Fox) and Michael Caine (Alfred). Neither of them play a crucial role in the movie, but they are important characters, and as many of you will agree, any movie benefits from the presence of Morgan Freeman.

One of the reasons I really love this movie is for the ending. Although the company claims this movie is the end of their take on Batman, the end of this movie sets up perfectly for an installment with Robin (Batmans partner in crime). Batman risks his life in order to take the atomic bomb over the ocean, and it is never really clear if he is still alive or not. Blake later goes to pick up a package left for him, and we find out his name is Robin. He finds the Bat Cave and is made to look like the next savior of Gotham. In addition there are several other interesting bits of information you gain in the last five minutes of the movie. Also, you are reminded of some of the small details revealed earlier in the movie. The end of this movie may not be action packed, but is filled with suspense and emotion, so, for whatever reason, if you are thinking on giving up on the movie, hold out until the end, I promise you will be satisfied.

Another aspect of this movie and series in general that I really enjoy is the overall portrayal of Batman and everything associated with Batman. This is not your traditional Batman comic book type of plot, it is more of a modern day Batman movie. Bruce Wayne driving Lamborghini's and the city of Gotham in general display some modern touches to this movie. This movie also takes a step away from traditional Batman villains. After Heath Ledger, the Joker in The Dark Knight, passed away, I think it was a smart play to step away from the Joker in general because no one could match the performance put forth by Heath Ledger in his role playing the Joker. While keeping with the main plot for the entire series, Christopher Nolan (the director) introduces a new villain, Bane. Bane is an interesting villain who you later find out is really nothing more than a puppet.",1386115200,,3965,4.626420454545454

4423784,5,B004LWZWGK,"Awesome movie. It gets a lot of flak because it had the tough task of following up The Dark Knight and Heath Ledger's legendary performance as the Joker but this movie is a classic that will grow on people over time and stands on it's own two feet. It's really a first for Superhero films since it gives a definitive ending for THIS version of Batman which some fans may not have liked.
Christian Bale is outstanding as usual but Anne Hathaway and Tom Hardy both kill it as Catwoman and Bane. Hardy is the first Batman film villain to ever be a true equal to Batman in terms of physicality and mental skill. I know some people complained about being able to understand what Hardy was saying but I had no problem and I think if you just LISTEN and have the volume properly set you'll have no problem either. Hathaway IS Catwoman, hot as Hell and extremely tough and believably bad ass at the right moments. When she rides the Batpod there's no doubt that she got in insanely great shape for this role. You'll know what I mean when you see her mount it. If you're a fan of Batman or superhero films then this cannot be recommended enough.
This is more than just a good ""superhero"" film, its just a great FILM. Beautifully shot, amazing score, some really great effects like the Football Stadium scene and the opening on the Airplane, and arguably the best fight scenes of The Dark Knight Trilogy, especially the first fight between Batman and Bane underneath Gotham City.",1385424000,,1469,4.50561797752809

However, when the credits ran, I found myself disappointed at the simplicity of the plot.  It was fairly straight forward, which normally would be enough to hold its own, but it just could not live up to the previous Batman installment.  The character development was lacking, even with a lot of the main characters.  ""Catwoman"" was meant to be mysterious, but in the end, was a throw away figure in the overarching storyline.  Within the first 30 minutes I was disappointed at the introduction of one of the main characters because it gave away the entire ""shock"" ending (if you know basic Batman lore, you understand my plight).  In the end, it was an OK film, with direction lacking in some key areas.",1384128000,,865,4.726666666666667

I did not like anne hathaway in this movie the reason is because she tricked batman and she's the reason why bane beat the krap out of him and then broke his back I almost wish she wasn't in the movie. I give it three stars because its a good movie but it is nowhere near as good as the dark knight was but there are some scenes that stand out like at the end when the police and the criminals fight each other and batman and bane are in the middle of it all I will admit that was awesome the only decent part.,1384041600,,668,3.7785714285714285
4423840,3,B004LWZWGK,"I gave this movie three stars because its not a bad movie, but I think it could've been better. When you make a sequel it has to be better or just as good as the last movie. Bane should not have been the only bad guy in this movie. There wasn't enough Batman and Catwoman's role was just too minor. Her outfit sucked and they didn't say Catwoman at all in this movie. I wanted to see Harley Quinn in this movie too. Its not a . movie, but its not an epic conclusion either. I wanted to see Jaimy Pressly play Harley Quinn and Cat Woman could have battled her as well as Maranda Tate.

. They could've fit Johnny Depp as the Riddler too and just change the whole story line. Though Bane is a good character, he is not well known to me. had it not been for this movie I would not have known who he was.

The plot was interesting, but there were far to many instances of things left out, or discrepancies in the films plot, and I'm not the greatest fan of the ending at all, I certainly see where Nolan was trying to go, I just didn't much care for it.

4423915,5,B004LWZWGK,"After what most people dubbed one of the greatest Comic movies of all time in ""The Dark Knight,"" Christopher Nolan has the challenge of coming up with an epic conclusion to his Dark Knight trilogy. Apart from just the challenge of meeting high expectations, Nolan had to make a different movie than he probably initially would have planned with the untimely passing of Heath Ledger (The Joker). However, despite these obstacles, Nolan still manages to go out with a bang.

 ""The Dark Knight Rises"" picks up 8 years after the events of ""The Dark Knight"" and finds a Gotham almost free of crime due to the deal Batman and Commissioner Gordon make. However, both men are still haunted by what happened and the choices they made. Now, a new threat has come to Gotham in the form of Bane and the Dark Knight decides it may be time to come out of retirement.

Nolan has brought together quite the cast, managing to fill even the smallest role with someone fitting. Tom Hardy is especially impressive and intimidating as Bane and the ensemble in general give great performance, along with several of the newcomers to the series like Joseph Gordon-Levitt as John Blake, a by-the-books cop working under Commissioner Gordon, and Anne Hathaway as the mysterious Selina Kyle. The holdovers from previous movie continue their strong body of work: such as Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, and Christian Bale.

The movie is pretty large in scope (and running time), but it is surprisingly well paced for a movie nearing 3 hours. Probably helps in part due to the structure of the story, similar to the Avengers in that it seems to have three distinct acts to it. There's a lot going on, but as is usual with Nolan he starts by laying out all the pieces of the puzzle before the movie begins to put everything together.

""The Dark Knight Rises"" brings the trilogy full circle in terms of plot, themes and even the visuals with plenty of references or nods back to the previous movies as well as continuations of the themes. The movie brings a close to Nolan's Dark Knight story in a way only he could and really makes it feel like a truly epic three film character story arc.",1382659200,,2155,4.645669291338582

4423917,5,B004LWZWGK,"The Chris Nolan Batman trilogy has been one of the best film interpretations of a comic book character...EVER.

That being said I do not really review movies as it's been said and done many times already here and elsewhere by people far more qualified than myself.  All I can say is that if I buy it on blu-ray, it's safe to say that I've already seen it on dvd or in the theater or in some other manner, and liked it enough to shell out the money for a blu-ray copy.  I'm an avid movie watcher and collector but my critiques of a movie shouldn't really matter much to you.  I've enjoyed many movies that critics have bashed and disliked many they have praised and often times agree with them.  it's all subjective, so watch it for yourself and if you like it enough, then you should buy it.  If my opinion really matters to you then I'll say it's an excellent movie and franchise and all 3 movies should be watched.  Great action.  Great acting.  Great story.

I do have a gripe with the cost of new blu ray movies though.  There is no reason that blu rays should cost more than a dvd and no reason they should be at their current prices.  As far as I know, it doesn't cost much more, if at all, to produce and manufacture blu ray discs.  I understand it's a newer format...that will undoubtedly be replaced in the near future...but is that reason enough to gouge us with insane prices?  Again, blu ray DOES NOT COST MORE to produce or manufacture compared to DVDs.  The price for a completely packaged blu ray movie probably costs less than $2 and we have been charged upwards of $50...or more...for a single movie.  Ridiculous and they dare complain about losing profits to pirates.  We've all seen them market anti-piracy at the beginning of every movie.  They seem to be the biggest pirates of them all with them robbing us blind.  I understand they have a right to make profits from their creation but I think there's a difference from profiting and profiteering, and then there's just pure greed.",1382572800,3,2003,4.4532967032967035

4423920,5,B004LWZWGK,"The Dark Knight Rises was one of the greatest trilogy finales of this generation. The way they incorporated other characters subtlety with their own agendas was one of the many aspects that made this movie great. Besides from the main character, Batman, you can see how other heroes in the movie grow and become the person they were always meant to be. Without the other heroes in the movie, it would not have been the epic movie that is, The Dark Knight Rises.
I personally loved how they incorporated the comic into real life circumstances. They meshed the comic and real life together so well, that it is almost believable, but somehow impossible. I didn't, however, like that they kind of drifted from the main story line in the comic, but still made it a great movie to watch.
If you have already seen this movie, but never payed real close attention to the other heroes, I would suggest that you do. It makes the story more than it already is.

4423946,3,B004LWZWGK,"Yes. Yes. Yes. Plot holes and tricky devices abound, as has been said. The positive aspects are nice visuals and a gritty, suspenseful pacing. Not to mention Michael Cane is brilliant in nearly everything he does. BUT Bane (although played by the very capable Hardy) is nearly unbelievable as a character in the ""real-world"" adaptations Nolan has seemingly striven toward. No one is going to meet the bar set by Ledger's Joker, but this is made starkly obvious in the extremely poor, nearly unwatchable Darth Vader-esque overdub of Bane's voice. If you give this another watch notice how the voice is never actually present in the scene but ALWAYS sounds as if it is in your - the onlooker's - room. To me, this is just downright lazy, and totally ruins any hope to be fully emersed in the batman universe. After the second movie, I expected more.",1382227200,3,847,4.72972972972973

The ONLY good scene was the 1st Bane v Batman fight, everything else is was a joke.  Watch the stock exchange hold up, when banes crew enters the stock exchange and shoot their machine guns they are just pointing fake guns and Nolan is setting off firecrackers whereever they point the gunsLOL....  so many plot holes, crappy acting, they made the cops helpless lol, this movie is a huge slap in the face, people who liked this movieblow my mind.... how can anyone like this movie?!?!  cops charging bad guys holding machine guns.... bane sounds like mr freeze!.... batman gets from hole in ground and travels to gotham from across the world in seconds.... i could go on and on.... very disappointed.",1382227200,7,867,4.71523178807947

4423949,4,B004LWZWGK,"I had three reservation regarding the movie: 1) how would they respond to the phenomenal success of the second movie; 2) could Ann Hathaway really portray Selena Kyle; and 3) the selection of Bane as the villain.  Items 2 and 3 were based on character definitions developed in the comics and cartoons.  The movie deviated from those definitions making the characters (and therefore the actor's portrayal) more believable.

Heath Ledger was exceptional as the Joker in the second movie.  Frankly, I did not expect that this movie would be as good.  I was more concerned that it would be a significant let down in comparison.  It would have been shocking to equal the effect of the second movie.  However, the third installation was quite entertaining.  The story flowed well; and most importantly (without giving anything away) it ended well.  A fit conclusion to a well thought out trilogy.

Do I recommend this film: yes.  I also intend on buy the trilogy and place it in my collection.  Most of these franchises are not worth collecting IMHO.  This one is.",1382140800,3,1058,4.843575418994414

4424000,1,B004LWZWGK,"The original Batman Begins was flawed but brought Batman back to life.  The Dark Knight was confused and uneven with too many subplots but Keith Ledger's (somewhat hammy) performance gave it energy. (Though I believe Ledger's death elevated the status for what was essentially an overrated movie).  But The Dark Knight Rises has little going for it.  The character of Batman appears for about 15 minutes of this 3hrs + pseudo epic  and he isn't particularly heroic.  The plot is a mess, full of contradictions, redundant sluggish and sloppy.  Nolan seems to love every frame he shoots and doesn't believe in editing. Bale is unlikable and unconvincing as a man  supposedly possessed with justice. SInce Nolan and Bale have taken a somber tone to their interpretations I believe audiences and critics alike WANT to embrace this Batman, as a statement against the campy silly Schmacher versions. That worked once.  But i have since have become  dreary and dull.  And the Dark Knight Rises  offers little more than eye assaulting CG's. If that works for you, see it.

4424002,3,B004LWZWGK,"This particular film was doomsday dreary.  It was filmed under low lighting conditions.  In most scenes you could barely see the characters or locations.  Incredibly frustrating.

I felt a sense of dread watching this film.  The villain's dark quest of Gotham mirrors much of today's world violence and the insatiable thirst of banks, corporations and legislators to inflict pain and suffering.

There were three nice events in this film however,  1.)  Batman and Catwoman's use of the Bat Cycle (great stunts) and 2.) the Bat Craft that hovered above Matthew Modine's head when he thought he had the Batman cornered (loved it!) and 3.) the pairing up of the Batman and Catwoman at the end.

4424034,3,B004LWZWGK,"In spite of the fact of the continued upscale production values, I find this one a bit of a bore. Bane is a henchman, not a star villain, yet he goes on like an Orson Wells with a mean streak and doesn't know when to shut up. Anne Hathaway's catwoman somehow misses the mark although she is more interesting to me than Bane. It is for this reason DKR fails. If Batman doesn't have interesting villains, he is not complete, as the tremendous Joker in Heath Ledger's unparalleled performance once described his own need for the Batman. I keep thinking miss Emma Peel of the TV show The Avengers could easily tangle with Anne Hathaway's seemingly superior catwoman, & that is just not right. Bane, on the other hand, needs to get off his egotistical  throne to spare us his muffled foreign ramblings.",1381536000,2,797,4.573426573426573

I am a huge fan of the way Michael Keaton versions years ago, but this movie won me over.  I did enjoy Batman Begins, The Dark Knight but in this trilogy In my opinion, The Dark Knight Rises is the best.  The storyline is great, Bane is AMAZING, and the message of perseverance, hope, redemption and justice are channeled to the audience.  The director Christopher Nolan did an amazing job, the characters and acting is great and dreadfully this series of this movie is over with Christian Bale no longer playing Batman.... or is it?  I would rate this movie probably 4.8/5, it is one of my all-time favorite movies now.

4424042,5,B004LWZWGK,"Beloved Heath Ledger aside, I have seen every Christopher Nolan film get strikingly better than the last one.  'Rises' is the first time that it is subtle, but i still think it's there.  It doesn't completely reinvent the wheel of film making like Nolan's prior two productions, but i think the balance and pacing, also the digest-ability all make for a great show.  Upcoming film makers who want a real exciting earth changing show often will use little tricks here, little gimmicks there which make the movies weak in the long run.  For Nolan films, this movie has the least of that I've seen.  It is grounded, straight forward, doesn't indulge any excess of computer graphics or little tricks to give you that 'jump'.  You can basically trust your eyes and your gut through the whole experience, which says a lot for a high budget filmmaker making a batman movie.  That is awesome confidence that comes a good amount of film experience.  I think he is up there in this particular school of mastery.  And for his collaboration as producer on Man of Steel, I think he doing what i have hoped for him.  He is working with more enlightened themes now (rising, transcending weakness, realizing potential, sacrifice...  I look forward to his next works.",1380672000,,1250,4.767441860465116

4424077,2,B004LWZWGK,"After reading a few pages of these reviews, I just have to throw in my two cents: this movie was absolutely ATROCIOUS.  Let me save you some time: there's nothing new here that you haven't seen before in the much superior ""The Dark Knight"".  I'm simply *amazed* that so many people thought this was such a great movie.

As a long time movie buff, comic book/Batman fan and someone who makes his living in the creative field [graphic design, sci-fi conceptual art/writing], I was left disappointed, to say the least, after the epic outing of ""The Dark Knight"".  Waited such a long time for this only to be let down in a major way.  In every category, from plot/story to dialogue to action sequences, this can't touch part two.

What a mess of a story!  I kept watching, hoping it'd get better and get somewhere with the plot, no luck.  Too many head-scratching things to list here, but the choice one worth mentioning is Bane's ridiculous voice/way of talking.  Picture ""The Venture Bros."" villain Underbheit-meets-Patrick Warburton with a sassy little ting, like he's saying, ""Ooo, I'm a naughty lil boy"".  I didn't think it was possible, but he actually dethrones Batman's own preposterous man-growl.  Such a distraction and it takes a lot away from the pace of the movie.  Soon, every time Bane's onscreen, you start to cringe.

In summary, part one and two of this trilogy are fantastic, part two being the crowing achievement of Director Christopher Nolan.  Sad to say but these 3 have gone the way of another favorite trilogy of mine, ""The Chronicles of Riddick"".  Part one, ""Pitch Black"", was a decent to good sci-fi flick and a cult classic.  Some people swear by it.  Part two, ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" was one of THE most under-rated science fiction movies of all time and the best in the series.  Part three, ""Riddick"", which just came out, is, simply put, terrible.  A complete farce by David Twohy and has basically ruined the trilogy.

The exact same thing can be said of ""The Dark Knight Rises"".  Painful to watch and way too long.",1380672000,,2048,4.7126760563380286

4424116,2,B004LWZWGK,"This Batman movie I must say is on the same level as Batman & Robin or worse. The plot was horrible making the few times you actually saw Batman look like a pathetic wimp. The title was completely wrong in my opinion. I believe they should've called this movie ""Catwoman Begins"" because for the most part you don't see Batman much, but you see plenty of Catwoman.

I liked the first two movies of this trilogy, but this film was just out of place. Lately, it seems that writers have no clue how to end trilogies. This film was a total dud, Iron man 3 was horribly written, and Transformers 3 was good, but could've been better. Hollywood needs better writers or editors or both of them. I wish they would stop ruining such great stories with horrible films like these.",1379894400,,768,4.446808510638298
4424117,2,B004LWZWGK,"I had my own problems with Nolan's trilogy, I liked the action sequences, the complex storywriting and most of the acting very much, but I didn't like many of the ""good""-side characters, mainly that of Batmans.
For the most part Bruce Wayne and Batman act out of selfish, boyish reasons through the whole trilogy, I didn't have the feeling that he really cares about the people of Gotham, not even that he really is able to do that. Revenge, love, his own image, that were the motivations for Nolan's Batman. He neither was really clever nor intelligent, only seldom did he foresee events, which would be another trademark of Batman, as I know and like him. Most of the time he was surprised and overwhelmed by the situations he got into. Of course, somehow he always found some hectic, accidental solution, mostly.
There are also some inconsistencies, at least for me. On the one side Rachel says in the end of Batman Begins, that Bruce never came back, and that his ""real"" face would be only a mask. With which Wayne agrees. Where on the other side Batman says he wears his (Batman-)mask to protect his beloved ones. It doesn't fit for me.
Alfred as the father figure, always lecturing Wayne, like he was a boy (which he IS in this trilogy) was another decision from the makers I didn't like. It might be forgivable in Batman Begins but not in the two Dark Knight sequels. Batman should be highly intelligent and mature for me, that is, what Batman is about.
And then the romances... Batman always in love or falling in love with somebody and always loosing his mind and reasoning because of it... That's almost the opposite of Batman, as I knew him. He even looses Rachel because of his carelessness! Caring is always also about thinking and keeping a calm mind, as well! To avoid hurting his beloved and himself. But Hollywood thinks a bit differently about this matter.
So that were my reasons, why I didn't like Nolan's trilogy, especially Dark Knight Rises. But 2 stars for the great action and decent storywriting (in the technical sense), the things I enjoyed in this movie and movies.",1379894400,,2094,4.662162162162162

Alfred has to be in the real League of Shadows or Illuminati - the movie makes sense if Bruce Wayne has been manipulated to go into a funk for six years only to emerge at the right time to deliver the necessary blows to effect change.  That may be what Liam Neeson was talking about in Part One.

I've also read comics, watched all of the animated movies featuring Batman, so to sum it all up for you, I know my Batman. This entire series was perfect. Executed like a swordsman. This last installment was not on par with the other two in my opinion in terms of combat choreography, but that is the only downfall to this movie. The story, actors and characters in this movie were spectacular! A easy ten out of ten for me. In this movie, you see a Batman that isn't as sharp as he use to be. You can tell in the way he fights that he is sloppy, sluggish and worn down but as always, Batman's never say die determination makes him surpass most brawlers, even in the expert level. Also Batman faces Bane, someone who is by far physically superior (but let me note that if Batman was in his prime, he would have beaten Bane easily) yet Batman through will and determination beat a terrorist with the skill and power to break him. Such intensity and obvious difference in this match-up made this movie so intense. To me it illustrates the struggle of life. Not just this movie, but the version of Batman that Chris Nolan brought to cinema. This movie series is about a man who says "" I will make a difference in this world, and nothing will stop me."" Something we all should inspire to do. A perfect trilogy.",1378684800,,1451,4.338235294117647

4424199,4,B004LWZWGK,"The Dark Knight seemed to have faltered a little bit somewhere, though I'd be very hard-pressed to say where exactly. I quite liked Bane as the Big Heavy in the film, the amoral mercenary taking Gotham by storm for the purpose of the city's destruction...and with a point to prove along the way. A point similar to the Joker's in the previous installment.

It wasn't hard to see the analogies Nolan was drawing with his film, but somehow the points about them got muddled. Yes, the Wall Street crowd was glaringly obvious but they became victims so quickly and painfully that I found myself wondering where the director's sympathies lay. The response of the citizens of Gotham to the sudden vulnerability of the rich was brutal and downright cruel, making me wonder who we were supposed to be having sympathy for.  The Dent Act parallels the Patriot Act, hailed as a great protector of the people against organized crime, only to have been built on a lie whose revelation marked the beginning the descent into chaos.

I was also rather bothered by the near-elevation of Batman to Christ-status by Gordon in his speech just after that dreadful revelation. Maybe they should have had Batman on a crucifix for the statue of him at the end. Hell, Batman's entire arc in this tale seemed to be a well-worn Sacrificial Savior arc...and I'm always irritated by those.",1377734400,,1360,4.778723404255319

What I love, though, is the Second Screen system. If you buy this movie, it's best played on a blu-ray with wifi and in conjunction with a tablet or smart phone. I use it with my iPad, and it's awesome. It syncs up with your blu-ray player, and as scenes go by on the TV, the blu-ray gives you quotes and information about the movie.

If this is the third and final Batman by the Inception guy, then this was also an awesome movie.

4424239,5,B004LWZWGK,"How to describe the excitement after watching The Dark Knight Rises for the tenth time (once in theaters, 9 times at home) is WOW!!! After Christopher Nolan finished The Dark Knight in 2008 he said he would not be interested in making another film, unless he had a story to tell and was compelling enough. He would go on to create his third entry in the Dark Knight saga with focus on Bruce Wayne. The majority of this film delves into dark, depressing circumstances that not only is affecting Bruce Wayne but with the city of Gotham. The relationship between Bruce and the city is shown through characters such as John Blake and the Wayne Foundation; Commissioner Gordon and how a lie weights down his life and the fear that everything will be undone. There may be little Batman shown in TDKR but when you do it shows how little time he has left physically and mentally.

Bane is a great character choice to insert by Christopher Nolan cause it showcases the trials and tribulations both he and Bruce Wayne have gone through. There is more to Bane than mere destruction and brutality. Both characters were portrayed to have risen and fight with determination no matter what.

Hans Zimmer's score for The Dark Knight Rises is amazing and fits with the tone of the movie. Probably the best score out of the three.

Overall, The Dark Knight Rises Successfully concludes the trilogy with a deep and heavy revelation that even heroes have despair and that there can be no true despair without hope.",1376784000,2,1494,4.673003802281369

Anne Hathaway was difficult to accept as Catwoman. Too many actresses who had played Catwoman were more exciting. Michelle Pfiefer was great as was Lee Merryweather.

4424269,1,B004LWZWGK,"The Dark Knight Rises is the final part of Chris Nolan's Batman Trilogy. It is also certainly the worst of the three, behind the average Batman Begins and the fantastic The Dark Knight.

The Dark Knight Rises is about the idea that determination leads to triumph over evil. It tries to demonstrate this idea with the main external plot of Save Gotham. This plot is supported by two others. The first is Batman's redemption and Reputation and the second is Catwoman's internal moral compass.

The problem for me was that I can find no more than one significant turning point on each of these three plots. On the main plot. Bane goes from triumph to triumph as he enslaves Gotham with no disruption until the end. Similarly, on the Batman Reputation front, it is in the trash until he saves the city at the end. Finally, Catwoman is morally corrupt and betrays Batman ... until the end when she and the whole story turns around on one blazing action packed sequence. Somehow these few dramatic bits are supposed to fill a 2+ hour story. They don't. And the pictorial depiction of Bane's triumph is boring, boring, and boring. For solace, I guess we could always rewatch The Dark Knight.

4424300,5,B004LWZWGK,"While Christopher Nolan's series of Batman flicks could likely have gone on forever -- earning fistfuls of cash for its producers while forever cluttering shelves with an endless barrage of merchandise -- the director does what any visionary worth his salt would do: He returns to his franchise to put it to rest, effectively quitting while he's ahead. No doubt, Warner Bros. will re-team with DC in a not-too-distant future, inevitably re-booting the series yet again for a new audience and a new profit margin, but in the meantime Nolan's closing chapter, ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" provides satisfying closure to a series that has been as brief as it has been remarkable.

Re-teaming with his screenwriter/brother Jonathan as well as mythology-maestro David S. Goyer, Nolan laces his final Bat saga with enough character torment, thinly-veiled political musings and crowd-pleasing, fist-pumping action to flood the Bat Cave. In the eight years since the events of ""The Dark Knight,"" Gotham City is a little safer, even if its protectors are a little bitter. Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) lives with a dirty little secret that stands between a peaceful city and total anarchy. Meanwhile, on the other side of the town and taking it harder than anyone else is Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale), who limps around the shadows of his mansion while his alter-ego lays dormant. It's only when a mercenary hell-bent on bringing Gotham to its knees (isn't that always the case with these guys?) emerges that The Dark Knight snaps out of his funk and busts out some new gadgets to once again save his broken city from itself. This new threat to Gotham, known only as Bane (Tom Hardy), literally pushes Batman to his breaking point, leaving a rookie detective (Joseph Gordon Levitt) to defend his hero and manipulative jewel-thief Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) to claw away at whatever is left.

While the film admittedly lacks the magnetism of Heath Ledger's performance of The Joker in the previous film, Tom Hardy's formidable Bane does his best to compensate. From the opening scene, Bane's presence is a force to be reckoned with and a far-cry from the hulking, dumb-as-a-brick, WWE-rejected (WWF in those days) mutant he was presented as in 1997's franchise-killing ""Batman & Robin."" Hardy's physical presence as well as his deliciously creepy voice leave a similar impression to Ledger, lending credence to the school of thought that says Batman's villains are just as interesting as the title character himself. Hathaway's take on Catwoman is smart and sleek and true to form, if a bit underdeveloped. Thankfully her presence is a plus, providing a bit of sweetness to Bane's saltiness. Joseph Gordon Levitt, meanwhile, emerges as a new kind of hero who has Bruce Wayne pegged from the get-go and who insists on doing the right thing even as the world crumbles around him. Levitt, who himself has emerged as one of his generations greatest talents in recent years, is another asset to a film that threatens to be over-crowded but thankfully makes room for just about everyone. It's not surprising then that Michael Caine's Alfred and Morgan Freeman's Lucius Fox are pushed into the background a bit.

Not only is this the longest of Nolan's Bat flicks, it is also perhaps the most dense and ambitious of them all. With so many subplots and so much subtext to juggle, it's a wonder Nolan doesn't drop the ball. It's a testament to the director's vision, as well as that of his collaborators, that the film doesn't falter. Tension escalates from the opening frames and doesn't let up until the film's mind-blowing and thoroughly satisfying conclusion. In many ways, the film will leave you wanting more and more and that's what makes it work so well. While another reboot and perhaps a spinoff (or two) will likely be in order, the fact of the matter is that what Nolan set out to say and do has been effectively said and done by the time the credits roll. The Dark Knight truly rises above and beyond the average superhero fodder, and when all is said and done, Nolan's legacy will stand in limited company. All hype and heroics aside, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a film that lives up to its own promise.",1376179200,,4197,4.90014064697609

Batman doesn't lose because he plays chess with his rivals and when the time arises can create armies out of the less fortunate masses. Batman has defeated Superman and yet somehow a two bit criminal like Bane defeats him, preposterous. When compared to the two previous films as far as story and continuity it can't stand up.

The acting is good, but the cat-woman character seems random and probably could have been written out of the script, or at least her story could have been expanded so it has a point.  The acting is great, and the effects are fun.  This movie has the least 'wow' effects of the three.  Maybe the movie just has too many characters, hard to care about most of them as they don't have much screen time, just my opinion.

4424408,5,B004LWZWGK,"It was exceedingly difficult not to call this review ""Greatest Superhero Movie of All Time"", even though as of this writing it unquestionably is. Its predecessor in every way, The Dark Knight, held the title all the way up until the final scene of the final movie of the Batman Trilogy. It was there that Christopher Nolan crossed the line, took us to where no superhero movie director dared go. Doubtlessly there will be a slew of imitators after this, but we will forever remember this flick for Nolan having said ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.""

 This one picks up where we least expected it, and psyched us out every scene thereafter. Bruce Wayne (Academy Award winner Christian Bale) is at the end of his athletic career as the Caped Crusader, with brain, liver and ligament damage after just a couple of years of Batmobiling. He finds himself the victim of an identity scam by Selena Kyle (Anne Hathaway), aka Catwoman, who trades Wayne's stolen fingerprints for a bogus criminal record expunction. Bruce's prints are used by corporate raider John Daggett (Ben Mendelsohn) who usurps control of Wayne Enterprises, backed by the mercenary force of an ex-League of Shadows assassin called Bane (Tom Hardy). Both Bruce and wealthy philanthropist Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard) suspect Daggett's ambitions to extend far beyond the Wayne empire. They are proven correct as Bane cripples and imprisons Batman en route to taking Gotham City hostage under threat of a nuclear weapon. Batman manages to overcome Bane with the help of Catwoman (who does a face turn after nearly helping to end Batman's career), and Batman saves the day...well, unless you've been living in Iran, you know how this went down.

  This flick begins and ends with Bruce Wayne's death wish, knowing that Batman's luck will one day run out. Alfred (Michael Caine) knows it is coming, and resigns as Bruce's butler in anticipation of an imminent no-win scenario. Bruce loses his fortune, wrecks his body and nearly loses his life in a remote prison fortress, but forges ahead in search of that final blaze of glory. We heard the rumors but couldn't believe it, and even director Nolan leaves us some fantastic `what if' strands of hope in the final reel. Not happening, people. With four seconds to detonation, only Superman and the Incredible Hulk (and maybe the Philadelphia Flyers) survive a nuclear explosion.

 Anne Hathaway's Catwoman was an incredible stroke of genius by Nolan, who (it was rumored) nearly train-wrecked the series by bringing in Eddie Murphy as the Riddler. Catwoman (who was already flushed down the toilet by Halle Berry) promised to be as dismal a character as Uma Thurman's Poison Ivy, but Anne Hathaway made the save with the best female  performance in the genre since Margot Kidder's Lois Lane. Never once did she seem hokey or contrived, and her romantic interest in Batman went head-to-head with Nicole Kidman's unforgettable job in Batman Forever. As for sex appeal and the credibility of her fight scenes, Hathaway's performance is second to none.

 Granted, Bane was no match for the Joker, but Tom Hardy's swaggering, supremely confident arch-villain was superlative nonetheless. His soulless, unblinking determination put him in a Terminator class of mindless automaton self-programmed for one purpose: the mutual assured destruction of himself, Batman and Gotham City. Even though Bane was not the ultimate anarchist that the Joker was, his suicidal imperative resonated even more with the 21st century terrorist than the Clown Prince himself. Having Catwoman delivering the coup de grace to the Beast Incarnate has to rank right up there with Lois Lane taking out Ursa in Superman II.

Greatest Superhero Movie of All Time? Perhaps. But, for damn sure, it's gotta be the greatest Death Wish movie we may ever see in this generation (i.e. those of us left who saw Death Wish on the big screen...damn few left).",1374624000,,3933,5.016871165644171

I think it was poorly written, and weak.  This movie is not horrible.  It does have it's moments and I think Ann Hathaway's charector was good etc., but the main drawback to this movie, was that it was endless!  The plot and story wouldn't have struck me as weak if it wasn't dragged out so much.  there should have been more deleted scenes and it would've been much more enjoyable.  Some good scenes, but because of that, were far between.

This, not the Avengers, should have been the number one movie of the summer. It's complete no-holds-barred acting, directing, action, everything.

The cast was excellent - except the addition of Marion Cotillard, whom I adore but who's character wasn't really needed (but was kept in honor of the comics). Tom Hardy is one scary villain as Bane and he is definitely on par with the Joker. He's a villain in a different sense, though. He's darker, more evil and definitely much less fun but no less captivating.

Anne Hathaway was superb as Catwoman - so fun to watch.

The surprise was Joseph Gordon-Levitt's cop who was as mesmerizing in his cop suit as the rest of the cast was in their elaborate costumes.

So many goosebumps and just keeping the audience on the edge of their seat.

So many say it's not as good as The Dark Knight, but they are two different stories. Movies are so subjective and these two are both great in their own ways.

The one big complaint? - That cop out ending. Trying not to spoil anything here. It would've created a much bigger impact with the way it ended 5 minutes before it really ended.

SO many more good things about it that there isn't enough time or space - but definitely one of the best movies of the year. No batman movie - or possibly even superhero movie - could ever match or exceed it's monstrosity, it's depth, it's story. This is Nolan's masterpiece",1374105600,,1647,4.466666666666667

This was a decent movie that relied heavily on its predecessors and the audience's prior Bat-knowledge to be interesting. In terms of quirks and twists? Well, most of those are either telegraphed to the movie-savvy viewer, or are simply less interesting than the production team designed.

Does that mean I didn't enjoy the film? Nope. It was a good time! Bane is awesome! Bat-fighting and large-scale...

2nd biggest flaw, Bruce was broke, how could he have started over in a cave with a huge platform that rose up and implied millions of dollars worth of equipment?

Third flaw, the bomb should have killed him, maybe he dropped it in time it didn't look like it, they said it was over the bay not in the bay.  This one could somehow be explained I guess, I can't explain it though.

4424541,5,B004LWZWGK,"It is usually hard for the third movie to live up to the original, but this does and nails it. Chris Nolan has de-constructed Batman not a as comic book fanboy, but as a professor looking at the mythos we create and use in story telling. He ability to have a grounded universe in which an emotionally scarred billionaire would become a masked vigilante who fights other super villains is a possibility is amazing, but to match that with the fun a great action movie. Very few franchises have made a 3rd act as engrossing or enjoyable, but we get the cycle of growth that was inherent in the first movie. The Batman is no longer needed by anyone, except for Bruce Wayne who does not know what to do with himself not that his life goal/passion is a liability not just to Commissioner Gordon, but to his own health. We see the physical and psychic toll it has taken him and the only end he sees for himself is as Batman dying in a fight with the evil that is rising. We also see that as the Joker was Batman opposite (chaos to his order), Bane is the road not taken. His childhood was filled with such trauma that Bruce's seems like a minor scrape. The story telling never sacrifices the rules of the universe it created to give in to the demands that good guys overcome or have a happy ending. It does what ever story should do that while some stories end, new stories are just beginning. If you enjoyed the first two movie, you will not be disappointed with the final act.",1371427200,11,1471,4.333333333333333

It didn't feel like the package was new.,1371254400,,357,4.409090909090909
4424575,2,B004LWZWGK,"I wanted to like this movie.  Truly, I did.  With the production values and people behind it, everything on paper said this movie should be an absolute joy.  And I suppose if you ignore the previous films, and franchise as a whole, turn your mind off, and just watch these pretty scenes cut together then it can be enjoyed just fine.  Delve any deeper, however, and you might find a story that does not mesh with the series, the franchise, or reality, and one that becomes heavy-handed in its drama.  Warning, this review does contain spoilers.

The Dark Knight Rises takes place eight years after The Dark Knight, and Batman hasn't shown his face since the climactic events of that movie.  Wait, what?  The previous movie establishes a continued need for Batman, of how this is supposed to be a hero that can accomplish things a normal man cannot, yet directly after establishing that and the credits roll we are expected to believe Bruce Wayne hung up his cowl and sat in his room mourning for eight years...when the death of someone close to him is what set him off to begin with.  The idea of a Batman just giving up is...unfathomable.  Yet that is the basis this film hinges upon

So we get into 45 minutes of slogging through this plotline, of Bruce Wayne being a crippled hermit slowly brought out of retirement by a thief linked to a greater plot.  45 minutes before we see anything of the Batman.  We get things like the Harvey Dent Act, in which criminals are able to be held indefinitely without parole.  We get a character knowing the connection between Bruce and Batman...all due to the pain he recognized in Bruce's eyes over the loss of his parents.  We get Alfred telling us in exacting detail the ending of the movie two hours before the ending of the movie.  We get the great dossier of Bane, of how he escaped from a hellish pit to be trained by Ra's al Ghul, a person whose entire organization was a massive secret yet somehow now has a former members listing.  Then there's a great stock exchange robbery, where clearly illegal transfers are somehow allowed to stand, followed by one of the poorest moments of editing I've ever seen, where a daytime chase scene switches very suddenly to night as finally, dun dun dun! the Batman makes his anticipated appearance...

...and fails to do anything impressive.  Remember in Batman Begins, the sequence of taking out Falcone's men one by one?  Or crashing in on the Scarecrow?  Remember in The Dark Knight how he managed to smuggle a money launderer our of Hong Kong?  Or managed to subdue an entire SWAT team before they mistakenly killed a bunch of hostages while taking out numerous armed criminals?  Or flipping the semi truck?  There's none of that here.  Batman's grand entrance consists of a bunch of people getting all excited watching a guy ride a motorcycle.  Oh sure he punches a guy or two and o hai!  Flying Bat vehicle.  But none of this accomplishes anything.  These things are just there to be there without any of the jaw-dropping set pieces.  But wait, Batman's not done yet!  He also...punches a bunch of guys.  Lots and lots of guys, in an open space, who don't realize they have guns, or how to attack more than one at a time.  Exciting.  And how about that fantastic fight midway through the film against Bane, where Batman turns into a full out brawler who suddenly forgot about all the equipment he's shown off the past two films.

And this is supposed to be the better half of the film.

From there the plot is finally unveiled to us and everyone goes full retard.  See, the League of Shadows wants to get revenge on Bruce Wayne for his destruction of their base and killing of Ra's, as well as to fulfill Ra's legacy to cripple Gotham.  To do so they do things such as seduce and comfort Bruce during his time of need and take months to set off an explosive which could wipe out Gotham instead of blowing the thing and being done with it.  To stop this nefarious plot the police send their entire force into a sewer system where they suspect Bane is hidden, with predictable results.  Then, to complete his embarrassment of the police, Bane reads a letter from Commissioner Gordon detailing the truth about Harvey Dent and Gordon's lie about Batman's supposed murder of him...and people just believe Bane.  But do the trapped police forces die?  Nah, of course not.  Over the following months Bane's forces keep them well-fed, despite all intention to just blow the city up.  Do I really need to explain the problems with all this?  So the film takes a turn and focuses on good cop Blake and his stay in a broken city, trying to restore order without any success to speak of.  His story is a long wait for no payoff.  Meanwhile, we spend another 45 minutes of film without any Batman where he must slowly build himself to recover and don the cowl.  Again.  For the second time in this film alone.

Then when Batman makes his (second) triumphant return?  He appears back in the city.  Which is locked down under threat of extreme violence.  From the other side of the world.  When he has no money or equipment.  With no explanation.  There's big, epic fights, (obvious) plot twists (Talia al Ghul?! no wai) and a great, climactic battle in which weaponless cops (apparently all lost in the sewers)take on vastly superior numbers of criminals armed with automatic weapons in a gigantic...fist brawl?  In which Bane's plot is resolved out of nowhere.  In which the true villain dies in terribly acted fashion moments after being formally introduced. And in which Batman can escape a nuclear blast in five seconds and Gotham has never heard the words ""nuclear fallout"" used together.

But it's ok.  In the end it all works out.  Bruce runs away with Catwoman, having given up the cowl for good (ironically when the city might need Batman most, considering the state of chaos it happens to be in and all the escaped criminals which happen to be free, not to mention repealed Harvey Dent Act releasing all mobsters back into the world and thus negating everything he accomplished in the first two films) and nobody recognizes the famous billionaire playboy who drunkenly burned down his home, lost all his money and mysteriously died at the same time as Batman.  Meanwhile good cop Blake (real name: Robin) takes on the cowl...without any of the training.  After having not accomplished a single thing of note during the entirety of this nearly three hour epic film.

When everything's said and done, this does not feel like a part of anything.  It uses familiar names and faces, but they don't line up with anything we've ever known, they don't act in any logical manner, the film follows no rules of the series or reality, and it follows none of the established themes.  It's as if the writer never read the comics or understood the happenings of the previous film.  Remember that chilling moment when Joker said, ""I think you and I are destined to do this forever,"" and you just had to wonder when he might escape and who the next villain might be to show their face?  There was an understanding there about the characters and franchise which went completely unrecognized in this story and the movie collapses in on itself because of it.",1371254400,43,7226,4.62814465408805
4424576,2,B004LWZWGK,"After seeing Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, I had high hopes for Dark Knight Rises.  Now that I've seen the film, I have to admit that I'm quite disappointed.  The film underwhelms in so many areas, that I don't know where to begin.  First off, I've always thought that Christian Bale was a poor choice for the role of Batman.  He's not a bad actor, but this was just not the role for him.  The first two films in the trilogy were good IN SPITE of Bale due to great plots and excellent villains.  This film has neither.  The plot was so far-fetched and convoluted that it was totally unbelievable (even for a superhero movie).  The main villain, Bane, was portrayed more like a common terrorist than a super villain (ironically, I've seen scarier terrorists in other movies).  After the great portrayals of the Scarecrow, Ras Al Ghul, and especially the Joker from the other films, Bane just does not measure-up.

My hectic schedule didn't allow me to see this movie when it was in theaters and, frankly, I'm glad I didn't.  This movie is a one-night rental at best.",1371254400,2,1070,4.549738219895288

4424712,5,B004LWZWGK,"Director Christopher Nolan delivers a most satisfying conclusion to his critically acclaimed superhero saga with the highly anticipated blockbuster sequel The Dark Knight Rises. It's been eight years since the death of DA Harvey Dent and billionaire Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) has become a broken recluse, abandoning his crusade against crime and corruption as the vigilante known as Batman. When the masked terrorist Bane (Tom Hardy) threatens Gotham City, Bruce Wayne knows that the Batman is needed, but to stop Bane's nefarious plan to destroy Gotham City he forms an uneasy alliance with the skilled cat burglar Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway). The Dark Knight Rises not only ranks as one of the best movies of 2012, but is also one of the finest superhero movies to hit the big screen. This thrilling cinematic spectacle is worthy follow-up to its acclaimed predecessor The Dark Knight, featuring an intricate storyline, solid performances, skillful direction and first-rate action sequences. The cast also includes Marion Cotillard, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine.

Warner Brothers knows how to give its blockbusters a solid Blu-Ray presentation, and this 2-disc edition will surely standout with repeat viewings. The Dark Knight Rises is presented in 2.40:1 and 1.78:1 (IMAX sequences) aspect ratios. The picture quality is certainly striking with notable detail and rich colors. Its 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track delivers that home theater experience that you've come to expect from most big screen summer movie. The 2-disc edition comes with an abundance of behind-the-scenes featurettes that deeply explore many of key elements of the film's production. It also features four trailers and an art gallery of posters and designs. Overall, The Dark Knight Rises scores an ""A"".",1368921600,,1819,5.427561837455831
4424713,5,B004LWZWGK,I don't think I have the vocabulary to accurately describe my feelings for this movie.  I rarely give anything 5 stars and I rarely pay to see a movie in theaters more than once but I did both with The Dark Knight Rises.  I love this movie!

4424764,4,B004LWZWGK,"Now this one really surprised me.  How many movies reach a fourth or fifth sequel and is still good enough to gain rave reviews.
I wasn't really expecting much out of this one, but I was very pleasantly surprised.  Not only did Christian Bale do a good job as the ""new"" Batman, he moved it right up to the top of the heap of the series.  He proved to be a powerful addition to the series.
He was good enough to convince you that his character could actually be a real life ""Super Hero"" right from the days of the Batman comics. Don't miss this one because you won't be disappointed!",1368921600,,582,4.225225225225225

4424767,5,B004LWZWGK,This was a great conclusion to the other two Batman movies. The story was great and the action intense. I thought that Anne Hathaway did a great job portraying Catwoman. Also Christian's voice was clearer and not as angry as that of the Joker interrogation scene in The Dark Knight.  Overall this was great entertainment. I am a little sad that they didn't continue.,1368748800,,366,4.71875
4424768,5,B004LWZWGK,This movie was the perfect ending to the Dark Knight trilogy. The movie was very long but you don't realize how long it is until the end and you get up.

4424792,3,B004LWZWGK,"Nolan's take on Batman is about 90% close enough to what I imagine it should be. The first two in the trilogy are so carefully scripted (with realistic motivations -- for genre pieces, that is -- foreshadowing & payoff, etc.) that my expectations were elevated for a capper that would rock my world. Unfortunately DKR is ridden with ridiculous plot holes.

ex. The ENTIRE Gotham city police force trapped underground??? REALLY??? And months later they're released (looking well-fed & freshly showered) just to engage in a clubs vs. machine gun showdown with the bad guys? In which the result is NOT an instantaneous, bloody massacre? Or that Bane breaks Batman's spine, ships him halfway across the world to a prison pit (WHY???) where he's given enough time to ""recover"" (as if THAT could ever happen) and then break out of the escape-proof pit, just to return to Gotham (How'd he get back, BTW?) and fly an atomic bomb into the harbor -- where he'd most certainly be vaporized -- and the seaboard would be flooded with deadly fallout for decades? But he survives this and ends up on a European vacation where Alfred spots Wayne at the very same cafe he's been frequenting all these years?

The only reason I thought the film was ""OK"" instead of ""insultingly terrible"" is that the action sequences and cinematography are technically superb. If I ever watch the film again it will be for those, and the fetching but vastly underused Catwoman.",1368144000,2,1442,4.810483870967742

4424949,5,B004LWZWGK,"After `The Dark Knight' became an international sensation and nearly secured a Best Picture Oscar nomination, there was a lot of pressure heaped on Christopher Nolan's shoulders to create something substantial as his follow up.  `The Dark Knight Rises' was met, right out the gate, with a lot of buzz and hype and extremely high expectations.  How in the world was Nolan going to compete with himself?  When you have a film that not only became a boxoffice smash hit but also managed to layer topical themes, contain breaking edge visuals and deliver one of the most iconic comic book performances of all time it is hard to do anything but disappoint.

Nolan doesn't; at least not entirely.

Sure, if you want into this expecting to compare this frame for frame with `The Dark Knight', you're going to be let down.  The second installment in this beloved trilogy is by far the best of the best, but that isn't to say that `The Dark Knight Rises' doesn't rise to the occasion (pun intended) and deliver something breathtaking in the process.  Making the most of its lengthy running time, we are treated to a visceral feast (the lighting, the effects, the skin tight catsuit) that may regurgitate a few tricks (if I were a citizen of Gotham City, I'd move FAR AWAY) but that ultimately stands up as a monumental feat in the comic book movie world.

Bale, Caine, Gordon-Levitt, Oldman, Hardy and Hathaway are all fantastic in their roles, with Hathaway being sensationally layered and delivering a very different performance than her Oscar winning role in `Les Miserables' (both were worthy of the gold, making her one of the most deserved Oscar winners in recent history).  Nolan works wonders behind the camera, setting up his epic journey in a way that spellbinds the audience.  He is a master of his craft, a true showman who understands who to develop action scenes with class.  From start to finish, this is a bold and daring film that allows the legend of Batman to live on in a way that feels fresh, unique and visionary.  There are few superhero films that can compete with the amount of humanity that Nolan puts into every frame.

Sure, `The Avengers' was fun, but it can't hold a candle to Nolan's juggernaut.",1366675200,,2217,4.7272727272727275

4424980,1,B004LWZWGK,"Giving this movie a one star is too much in my opinion, if amazon allowed the option of 0 star, that's the rating I would pick. This movie is not only incredibly stupid but in all honesty, it does not feel like a movie. It feels like you're watching a series of small clips who seem to follow one another. The sequence of the movie is extremely poor and the watching experience is not smooth. Clips are just randomly thrown at you from all corners.

One of my biggest problem with this movie was the dialog, none of the characters seem to talk like actual people. For goodness-sake, NO ONE TALKS LIKE THAT. Their conversations are incredibly abstract, unnecessarily deep, and cloudy. Each of the characters have a lot going on but none of it are things you care about. Whoever wrote the script of this movie needs to be fired asap.

What's worst are the moral hazards supported within this film:

1) According to cat-woman, its perfectly ok to steal from those who have more. Not taking into account that those who have wealth worked for it, and those who are poor don't produce much. Being poor is not an excuse to steal, it shows you are too lazy and impatient to acquire things the correct way so you resolve to robbing others for what they have worked for.
2) The movie is socialist by nature. For it demonizes the wealthy as if they are rich at the expense of the poor. People are not rich by accident, one gets rich through smarts, efforts, and sacrifices that the poor refuse to do. No one gets rich by demand, the rich earned their wealth. To demonize rich people is a bad lesson to teach our young.
3) Even though cat-woman is a low life untrustworthy thief, batman is into her and begs for her cooperation. (What kind of hero is that?)
4) Bruce Wayne gets angry at Alfred (the man who cared for him his whole life) because he hid a love letter from a woman who clearly rejected him. That is totally not OK and ungrateful.
5) The movie legitimizes that without a police force, poor people are barbarians who sentence the wealthy to death simply because of what they have. That is very condescending towards the poor.

The list of moral hazards in this movie are endless but I rather not continue. The conclusion is that this movie subliminally teaches the public a very wrong and destructive concept of reality. Most Poor people are not barbaric savages waiting to jump on the rich the moment they get a chance, and most rich people are not snobby obnoxious individuals stomping on the poor to acquire and maintain wealth. In fact, the rich individuals are often the most productive and provide a wide array of benefits to the poor. Outside the moral hazards, there is very little intelligence behind this movie. In other words, the movie is plain dumb and stupid. It's a shame to see mainstream entertainment come down to this level. This movie gets -1 Star.",1366416000,14,2868,4.530888030888031

4425035,3,B004LWZWGK,"After 4 Long years since Christopher Nolan once again broke ground with ""The Dark Knight"" (2008), I was somewhat disappointed with ""The Dark Knight Rises"" (2012). While the acting from all the major and minor players is excellent, Anne Hathaway's Catwoman was without dispute the best part of the film (I would have like the film to be more about her, Bruce and their relationship) and the action and vehicle pursuit sequences are better than ever, as well as a rousing performance from Tom Hardy as Bane, this film just didn't quite cut it for me. Too many problems with the narrative,(such as plot holes, and ridiculous plot points), the Miranda Tate subplot, The lack of music in certain places, in  and even the film's opening premise were all low points for this movie. I'm not saying that Nolan's ""Rises"" was a bad film, just one that could have been a lot better in the long run.

The Opening Premise:

The whole ""its been eight years since Harvey Dent died"" and ""Bruce has become a crippled recluse"" premise was in my opinion: Bad for business! Here's why: The main reason(to me) that Batman/Bruce Wayne has endured for 75+ years is the fact that as a character, he continues his crusade, regardless of the personal cost that comes from his actions. The start of film is upsetting to me as a ""Bat-Fan"". I paid to see Batman, not Bruce moping around Wayne Manor in silence, simply because he lost his girlfriend (who really was going to marry Harvey in ""The Dark Knight"" (2008)) and give up! It goes completely against his character, and if he is so crippled, than how was he able to fight bane at the end of the film? or even at all? With a ""magic knee brace""? (I know he re-trained himself, and ""learned how to be Batman"" again, this time just in a different location)

Miranda Tate Subplot:

I get that Miranda is an attractive, successful businesswoman (Marion Cotillard is absolutely gorgeous, obviously) but still why would she go out of her way to help and support Wayne and his police cohorts, only to backstab him at the end? (The Talia Al Ghul ""twist for twist sake"" wasn't handled too well, comic book fans like myself saw it even before the film premiered in theaters) and why didn't Bruce Wayne himself see that Tate was a member of the League of Shadows? He recognized that ""mark"" on her back in that scene when he is sleeping with her at his mansion? Right? It made no sense to me at all: Bruce is a highly trained ninja-like combatant with a brilliant mind, and he doesn't know that Miranda is a trained killer and strategist? Why is she suddenly the ""main"" villain, when Bane was running the show since the opening shot?

 TOO MANY PLOT HOLES!!!!

(I'll just name a few)There are too many in this film to name in a single review!

Bane just brings Wayne all the way to a pit prison just to taunt him and fly back to gotham? Why?

How in the world does Bruce Wayne get back to Gotham all the way from another part of the world? (I know he's Batman, but he is supposed to be in ""Our world"") It just doesn't make sense!

Alfred breaks up with Bruce and his crusade simply because he's going too far and completely disappears for about two-thirds of the movie? (despite another round of great performances from Caine and Bale respectively)Where did Alfred go? What was he doing while Bruce was trying to stop Bane and the Nuclear Bomb?

What was the point of John Daggett? Why was he even in Gotham in the first place? If he hated Wayne so much, why didn't he just move to another city? Like Miami, New York, or even Las Vegas?

How did the old prisoner medic manage to snap Bruce's back in place?

Several of Bruce's attempts to climb out of the Pit alone would have killed him!

How did Bane become so strong? What gives him his strength in the film, and how is he able to find Fox's armory despite it being ""off the books""? How did Bane find out where Wayne Enterprises or even Applied Sciences were? How did he know about the Wayne Enterprises Board, or even who Lucius Fox is?

Hans Zimmer's score (despite the absence of James Newton Howard) is great, but why is it missing during both Batman and Bane fights (which in my view) would have added more emotional impact to both scenes? (especially the one in the sewers, where Batman gets his back broken)

 Overall, Nolan's ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is still a good film. Gary Oldman gives a solid performance (being the best actor doing the best job in these films) as Gordon, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt's John Blake was a stand out in the film (Blake seems to be more of the lead protagonist than even Batman is) My favorite scene is still when Bane kills Daggett and it sounds like he's getting tickled off screen! Priceless! I also loved the ""Bat"", and its flying sequences through the streets of Gotham. thoroughly enjoyed Bane blowing up Rogues Stadium and Hines Ward running away from all those explosions!  This would have made an even better opening, and given the audience with a real sense of what Bane is capable of; and why he is such a threat to Gotham. I Still can't get over Anne Hathaway as Catwoman! Her character was more in line with comics! She played Selina with a noticeable sense of style and sex appeal. Christian Bale is more than serviceable as Bruce Wayne/Batman, and he packs more of an emotional weight to his performance(with his Bat-Growl intact).  Finally, Tom Hardy's ""Bane"" was more in line with the graphic novels of the 90s, like ""Knightfall"" and ""Vengeance of Bane"". Bane isn't just a brute, but a master strategist, the kind of strongman that could also beat you in a chess match. The show trials were great! ""Exile, or Death?""  It should be noted: this is my final Batman film review.  I hope you fellow Amazon customers enjoyed my reviews, as much as I liked composing them.

4425060,4,B004LWZWGK,"The Dark Knight Rises had the misfortune of being the follow up to one of if not the best movie of the millennium up to this point. Does it live up to the hype? Of course not that would be near impossible, but it comes closer than anyone would have thought.

  My problems with this movie are a mixed bag of  lack of development, plot holes, Hollywood superhero movie cliches, and a disappointing ending. The biggest lack of development is when the city is under Bane's control for what is said to be months but only feels like a few days at most. Instead of the few minutes we see of riots it would have been better if we were shown the anarchy and self destruction of Gotham that was Bane's ultimate goal and the months of uncertainty and fear that they created. This movie is full of plot holes, from characters knowing Bruce Wayne's secret without any explanation to Bruce's ability to find a cafe without ever being told the name of that cafe. One glaring plot hole is Bruce Wayne's ability to travel from a desert in a undisclosed foreign nation, into the heavily guarded city of Gotham without any money or equipment. This plot hole is undercut by the Superhero cliche that is the fact that the superhero is capable of anything. If you were to ask somebody how Bruce Wayne was able to get to Gotham their inevitable answer would be ""He's Batman."" as if that constitutes a rational explanation. Another dreadful superhero cliche is Catwoman played by Ann Hathaway. A small hot woman who can beat up waves of large muscular men. To be clear I'm not saying that women can not be tough. I am simply saying that this specific petite woman with no muscle tone would not be able physically best these larger men because, due to her lack of muscle, her punches, kicks, or any other form of attack simply wouldn't hurt. And the biggest Hollywood cliche of them all, when the hero is about to be killed by the villain someone bursts though the wall and saves him. This is usually preceded by the villain stalling by going into a overly lengthy speech about killing the hero instead of actually doing it. The worst disappointment of this movie is the ending. Without spoiling anything with to much detail i'll just say the whole movie builds to Bruce Wayne doing something and then when it finally comes time for him to do it he doesn't and instead the movie gives us more of that ""He's Batman, he can do anything"" junk.

  Even with all the problems in this movie it still manages to be great. First of all the acting is top notch. Christian Bale is once again great as his humble Bruce Wayne and his grandiose alter ego and Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, and Gary Oldman all repeat their convincing and grounded roles as Bruce's support. Among the newcomers is Tom Hardy as Bane, the main villain of the movie. Bane does a great job as the character giving him an assertive and menacing feel. Bane's voice might sometimes be hard to understand but those occasions are far and few between and when you can understand him it is terrifying and effective. Another newcomer is Ann Hathaway who gives a surprisingly good performance and shows a level of acting she has never shown before. The last major newcomer is the rising star Joseph Gordon-Levitt with a great performance as an orphan turned cop with similar ideas and beliefs as Bruce Wayne had when he first decided to fight crime. The greatness of the acting in this movie is due to the same reason that the acting has been so great throughout the trilogy, everyone takes it seriously. None of the actors succumb to the temptation to act as if they are  characters in a comic book movie like Jim Carrey and Jack Nicholson had in the past. This is essential to giving the movie it's realistic feel and making all of us watching believe that given the right circumstances this could all really happen.

  The other reason that all this movie's problems can be so easily forgiven is it contains some of the greatest and most epic set pieces to ever grace the silver screen. Christopher Nolan is not a Michael Bay over the top action director but instead he is an intimidate filmmaker of taste. From the simplest fight scene between Batman and Bane in a sewer to the jaw dropping scene during a football game Christopher Nolan's directing, mixed with a great score score by Hans Zimmer, creates scenes that will stick with you and cast a giant shadow over the movies faults.

  This movie is riddled with plot holes and annoying cliche scenes and yet manages to be a satisfying conclusion even if the movies own conclusion isn't so satisfying. People say that it's unfair to compare this movie to The Dark Knight and should only be judged own its own. But it's only natural to compare the two considering they are part of the same trilogy and share three quarters of their name. The Dark Knight is a masterpiece, a once in a lifetime kind of thing. The Dark Knight Rises is a great superhero movie while the The Dark Knight is simply a great movie. In conclusion The Dark Knight Rises lacks the near perfection of it's predecessor but is still a great and memorable conclusion to one of the greatest movie trilogies of all time.",1365292800,,5175,4.550537634408602

4425094,3,B004LWZWGK,"While better than most Hollywood blockbusters these days, Batman is sadly falling into the same traps that have turned most modern movies into utter crap.

The bad guys have become one-dimensional characters with their only purpose to push the Batman towards the directors story-line.  For example, Bane declares that he's going to blow up Gotham, but he's going to wait for five months to do it.  Yet his only motivation in life is to blow up Gotham.  So what's the point?  Simply to allow Batman enough time to heal from injuries to get back into the story.  It was ridiculous enough that I nearly expected Batman to begin training in a classic 80's montage.

The special effects are also the same bland CGI garbage that has pushed Hollywood action towards irrelevance in the US.  If the sequel keeps going along the same path, you can expect the batmobile and batcopter to turn into Transformers and save the day.",1365033600,,916,4.753164556962025

4425100,2,B004LWZWGK,"Let me start off by saying Batman is my all-time favorite superhero but this movie was a pretty big letdown.

The movie begins 8 years after The Dark Knight and we find out that Batman has quit being Batman and now he's just limping around and sulking in his mansion. I didn't think they'd choose to go this route with a third movie but they did. The problem here is that as an audience member you want to see Batman right away and you want this movie to get rolling. It doesn't. They have to completely rebuild the character of Batman all over again. This takes 45 minutes. That is almost the same amount of time it took to build Batman up in Batman Begins. It was fine for that movie because it is an origin story and you are expecting it to be more about character development and not so heavy on loads of action. Finally after about 45 mins Batman does indeed finally show up and the movie does begin to get better and within 25 minutes of Batman being back you get to, in my opinion, the best fight in any Batman movie Batman vs. Bane The ending to this scene is very faithful to the comics and I would normally be ecstatic about this, but it means unfortunately that Batman is going to be gone for another 50 minutes!. I wouldn't have a problem with this if I didn't have to wait the first 45 minutes before being able to see Batman but this is getting ridiculous. Its become a Batman movie without Batman.

During the second half of the movie it highly focuses on Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character Blake while Batman is gone yet again and the whole entire movie just slows down to a crawl. This is mainly due to Christopher Nolan's severe pacing issues which are present in all of his movies.
And when finally when Batman makes his reappearance near the end of the movie I feel pretty exhausted due to Nolan's bad pacing and I just want the movie to be over with. You do get another Batman/Bane fight and you find out I guess why they felt the need to make the character of Blake as large as they did. But in making his character who he is it was just a slap in the face to every Batman fan out there.",1364860800,,2107,4.251870324189526

If you liked the first two you will definitely be pleased with this final film.  Will it be the last one? From what I have read, yes, and though part of me wishes it would go on I think ending the story now on a high is probably the right move.  Like all great classics there is a great beginning, middle and final conclusion that wraps everything up.  This movie did just that.  Now I need to get the trilogy in a nice boxed set for my collection. So in conclusion, if you like these kinds of movies and in particular Batman this will not disappoint, however, if you have not seen the first two yet you owe it to yourself to watch them in order first and then watch this one for maximum enjoyment.",1364860800,,844,4.172839506172839

I liked the Dark Knight, but who needed a plot when you had the introduction of the best performance of Heath Ledger, as The Joker. He made that movie and it is unfortunate he is gone now, may he RIP. I believe if it would have not been for him as The Joker it would have been a total flop. Thankfully it wasn't and The sequel The Dark Knight Rises was a great come back. I believe we will have a 4th and The Introduction of Robin will come into play, I hope so. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves superhero's especially Batman. It is a great comeback and I have a suspicion this will not end as a trilogy :D.

4425219,2,B004LWZWGK,"Without going into the actual details of the movie, because you should see it for yourself to judge. I will just talk about one huge disappointment of the movie and that is the criminal. The criminal in this movie was a hard-core Marxist who basically sought to reverse the rules of society to work for the poor and criminals. This plot was not original at all and seriously lacked imagination, considering that this has especially already been tried in the real world, i.e. Communism. No, this movie sucked, okay the action was alright, but that is not what makes a movie, it is it's plot instead. However, it is not that this criminal is a Marxist that makes this movie bad, it is the fact that he is just like everyone else in society and he really does not want to change the system, but only to change who the benefits of the system are applied to, i.e., steal from the rich and give to the poor, this is classic Marxism, not original at all, Mr. Nolan. Also, Bane's Marxism was not the real reason it sucked, because in the end, he was planning to blow up the city, presumably with him dying as well. Besides the movie being slow to really start and the huge plot gaps, the real reason this movie sucked was because Bane himself (by this I mean everyone who worked for him as well) had to do all of the work. This is just another, ""good guy, bad guy"" film, there is no psychology whatsoever in the film, it is pretty clear, cut and dry who the bad guy is. However, if you remember The Dark Knight, the Joker was the complete opposite of Bane, the Marxist. The Joker was an anarchist, do you remember when he burnt his money after the bank robbery? The Joker did not live for money, but for chaos. Bane did what he did for money, but the Joker did what he did because, well just because, and it is that that makes The Dark Knight so psychological. In The Dark Knight, Batman said that all criminals want something, you just have to figure it out, but not the Joker, he wanted nothing material, only chaos. Bane, however, was a Marxist who released criminals from prison, because he had claimed that they were kept in there ""UNJUSTLY"", but according to the Joker, there is no such thing as ""justice"", only rules that keep people in order, rich or poor. Do you not remember the part in The Dark Knight, when the Joker declared that ""Gotham deserves better criminals than the current ones""? What he meant by this is that all of the current criminals are all in the business for money, but what Gotham needed was a class of criminals who did what they did just for the sake of it, just to upset the ""system"", to up set ""order"". Finally, this brings me to the worst part of the movie. In The Dark Knight Rises, Bane must kill the people himself . Now, even though he tries to do this with an atomic bomb, we should not be awed by this, because remember that it is not the ""what and how"" (this is only action), but rather the ""why"" (this is the psychology). The Joker's main goal in The Dark Knight was to show that deep down inside, people were all evil and that the only thing holding them back was the system or rules, but once you take that away, the real chaotic nature of people is shown. More importantly, the Joker tried to show this, by using the people themselves, he wanted the people to initiate the chaos, not himself. Do you see the psychology? A perfect example of this, is towards the end of the movie when he gives the people on the two ferries the option of either life or death, by choosing the life or death of the other people on the second ferry. See, so the point is, that the Joker was trying to create the scenario where the people could not blame the so-called ""villain"" anymore, because they themselves were all the villains now. They would all be just as responsible as the Joker would be, if not more, because all the Joker would have done, was merely load the gun, but the people themselves would have pulled the trigger. None of this psychology was in The Dark Knight Rises, Bane is clearly the enemy and no one else. It is clear that he must be stopped and there is no other option. Furthermore, it appears that the whole thing that was motivating Bane in being a villain was the fact that he was now in charge of the League of Assassins who seek a world of perfect balance, which would just be creating another system, no matter what kind of system it would be. This is the very thing that the Joker despises and seeks to destroy; ""RULES"", ""ORDER"", ""AUTHORITY"", and especially ""STRUCTURE"" that keeps all of the former in place. In all, most enemies in comic books, including Bane would be easy to defeat in the real world, but if the Joker ever accomplished his goal, the world would be lit aflame with self-inflicted chaos and we all would be cast back into that treacherous ""State of Nature"", in which Thomas Hobbes described it as being: ""In such condition, there is no place for industry; because the fruit thereof is uncertain: and consequently NO CULTURE of the earth; no navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by sea; no commodious building; no instruments of moving, and removing, such things as require much force; no knowledge of the face of the earth; no account of time; no arts; no letters; NO SOCIETY; and which is worst of all, continual FEAR, and DANGER of VIOLENT DEATH; and the life of man, SOLITARY, POOR, NASTY, BRUTISH, and SHORT.""",1363996800,,5405,4.41683366733467

Christian Bale is so talented and was the best Batman thus far---he truly becomes the character and embraces every single aspect of Batman's struggle as the man behind the mask. (Not to mention, I love Christian Bale and have ever since I saw him as child in Newsies :))

I would definitely recommend this movie---it's the perfect ""date night in"" movie--My husband and I saw the first two in the theater and unfortunately were not able to see this last one in the theater, so we rented it from Amazon and watched it via our Roku.

Also the social commentary of the piece, magnificent, the artwork of the locations and the environments, amazing.  I went and saw this on opening night, no I'm not from Colorado and yes I feel for those folks, but we can't let one loon ruin such a great film!  It has romance, action, comedy, pain, drama, and of course...BATMAN!  What a piece, what a piece, if Man of Steel goes as well this might be the star of the DC look to push into films that can eventually cross over, like the Avenger's did.  Only if Man of Steel works, and it can't just work so-so it has to work like this movie works, it has to be awesome, otherwise DC should stick with animation and leave the movies to the B and C class heroes and groups like the Losers and R.E.D. and leave Marvel to the big names.

4425303,1,B004LWZWGK,"Batman Begins......GREAT Batman film and acted as a great origin story to reboot the franchise.

The Dark Knight....A bit too long in the tooth, but still an enjoyable film, despite some liberties taken with the source material. Ledger was great...but not as ""Joker"" as he could have been (that's the fault of the writing).

The Dark Knight Rises....What the HELL happened??? This movie is the epitome of a train wreck. It is poorly written and leaves gaping holes in a plotline that had become far to convoluted to begin with. It is mired in socio-economic platitudes (Occupy Gotham anyone??), has well known characters in Batman lore that are light years apart from their source material (not in a good way), and has little to no redeeming qualities that made ""Begins"" SUCH a great Batman film. While I understand and respect Nolan's desire to make Batman less ""comic book"" and more ""realistic"", the realism has gone into the realm of the absurd, and for all the wrong reasons. An earlier one-star rating here did a much better job than I could in pointing out the glaring plot holes, but even with their laundry list..there's even MORE than was noted.

I am a film buff. I am also a comic book fan. I understand fully the differences that are somewhat necessary to bring a comic book character successfully to the cinema. Naturally, a non-comic reading audience must be reached for it to be truly successful. However...As absurd and fantastical as a film like ""The Avengers"" was, it hit it out of the park!! Why? Because these are COMIC BOOK CHARACTERS. Nolan has taken this far too seriously as if to make some kind of statement, although I can't figure out what that statement is other than ""Um....I think I let this plotline get away from me, so let's just shoot it and put it out while my fanboys are STILL fanboys."" There is nothing in this film that is even mildly true to the source material. This is NOT Batman by any stretch of the imagination. There isn't a likable character in the entire film (with the exception of Gary Oldman's brilliant Jim Gordon...the ONE character that is dead-on to the source material).

All in all, it almost made me miss Joel Schumacher. Of course...that's an ""almost"".",1362960000,23,2211,4.735064935064935

There was a lot going on in this movie, and maybe I should have watched the first two again before seeing this installment but in general, the storyline seemed thin and barely able to hold itself, much less the overall movie, together. It's another movie that left me feeling generally underwhelmed, partly due to not quite understanding what was directing the characters; as if there was another movie that built up to this one and that movie was never seen by anyone. It just seemed like there was a lot of back-story that just wasn't expressed or developed enough to enable me to ""get behind"" the characters and believe in them.

""Batman Begins"" is one of my favorite movies, ""The Dark Knight"" was great but, in my opinion, it was such a fast paced ""in-your-face"" kind of experience, (particularly in the theater), that it was hard to follow specific things and/or actions at times. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" just felt like a slower-paced, hodgepodge of elements that just weren't knitted together quite right, the results of which made for something of an underwhelming finale to the series.",1362787200,,1152,4.818181818181818

4425320,1,B004LWZWGK,"Batman Begins & The Dark Knight were good for what they are. However, the Dark Knight Rises is dull & dumb movie to watch with it's collection of plot holes & bad directing decisions. It left me with many unanswered questions seen below?

What's with all the horrible sound quality? Sometimes, this film is louder than most anyone can possible be. Sometimes, this film is so low that your own thoughts seem to sound louder than this film.

What Happened to the Joker?

Why did the director think this was a good idea to make Batman basically handy capped (...seriously)? Batman has trouble fighting because of an apparent bad leg (possibly an injury from fighting the Joker in the last film). Even with a new robotic brace helps Batman move his leg, Batman still has trouble doing much anything in general. Bruce also looks like he didn't aged at all after the last film, but the plot description for this film says that this movie (The Dark Knight Rises) is apparently set 8 years after the last Batman movie (the first Dark Knight) that Batman is kicking so much butt in.

Why is the fighting of this movie so bad & almost non-existent in general?

Why was Bruce (Batman) and Selina's (CatWoman's) love so randomly and quickly formed?

Why didn't they ever call Selina Kyle, ""CatWoman?""

Why doesn't Bane take the Venom drug or anything like it to gain superhuman strength (and therefore has no real powers)?

Why is Bane have a new big weak spot  (His own entire head)? Bane's mask holds together much of his head which prevents Bane from otherwise feeling much extreme pain and possibly dying. Destroying the mask means destroying Bane.

Why does Bane talk with that rediculous voice? Truthfully, Bane's silly voice takes away from Bane's sense of being scary or dangerous. Bane talks like an old dork trying to badly sound like Sean Connery doing German accent and failing at the impression. Also, Bane is lame next to the Joker of this series (R.I.P. Heath Ledger).

Why is Robin a cop named Blake?

How does Blake figure out Batman's identity at all?

Why doesn't Blake become Robin in the middle or throughout the movie?

What's with all the tacked-on orphan stuff?

Why is Bruce's place turned into an orphanage?

Also, is the director trying to say that Robin is going to replace Batman entirely as the hero of Gotham with this movie's ending?

Why did Bruce change his mind about not wanting to have any partners (like Catwoman & Blake aka Robin)?

Why did I waste 2 hours & 44 minutes of my life watching this slow & crappy movie?

What Happened? This movies seems to be made by a different studio. That may have something to do with it, but Christopher Nolan still directed all 3 films (Batman Begins, The Dark Knight & this film, The Dark Knight Rises).

In any case, The Dark Knight Rises was a horrible Batman movie. It's plot is basically a very lacking & poorly written version of the plot from the Batman game, Arkham City (available for PlayStation 3 and X-Box 360). It's full of plot holes & is just annoying to watch.

Get the first 2 Batman films directed by Christopher Nolan. Don't even waste you time with the third film. After all, you could always play Arkham City.",1362614400,5,3193,4.625886524822695

For his portrayal of Bane as a cunning and physically intimidating villain, Tom Hardy did a remarkable job.  I believe he erased a lot of doubts fans may have had about how he would handle playing this role.  When first seen on film in that abominable ""Batman and Robin"" Bane was nothing more than a mindless idiot.  This time it was done right even though his costume is different from the comic books and animated series.

Anne Hathaway has come a long way as an actress.  Her physical training more than paid off and she all but stole the show as the conniving Selina Kyle/Catwoman.  Even composer Hans Zimmer created an original, somewhat dark and seductive musical motif for the villainess with a song titled ""May I Cut In"".

When I saw ""Batman Begins"" in 2005, I commented to my friends it was the Batman movie fans have been waiting for.  The combined talents of Director Christopher Nolan, Composer Hans Zimmer, a carefully selected cast of actors, actresses and crew have successfully created one of the greatest and most exciting movie series of all time.",1362441600,,1289,4.818181818181818

4425344,5,B004LWZWGK,"I can't figure out why The Dark Knight Rises drew such negativity; my family and I all thought it was an excellent ending to this chapter in the Batman saga. Nothing may ever be as good a superhero film as The Dark Knight; if I could, I would give that film 6 stars compared to 5 for this one and the first, so keep that in mind.

I did not see this in the theater and in fact watched this video copy on my crappy old TV (we have since gotten a better old TV, HD now, so I will be watching this again). Watching on a small screen focuses you on the story and the actors and less on the effects, and I think that served this film well. Given that this is comic book material, I can forgive most logical gaps as we are frequently called upon to do with these types of films. It is also very dark, but not out of context for this film series or the times we live in.

I had been concerned that covering the face and masking the voice of an actor as fantastic as Tom Hardy would ruin the film, and it is a role a lesser actor could have handled, but Hardy still manages to own Bane's physicality and sheer fright factor. Christian Bale seemed to do better in this role -- he does suffering very well -- than The Dark Knight, where he seemed uncomfortable at times until the end, upstaged entirely by Heath Ledger. Joseph Gordon-Levitt has a few annoying Boy Scout moments, but he's always such a joy to watch that really didn't matter.

If you need convincing to watch this film, you might enjoy it better than the over-critical, over-anxious fanboy crowd. It's not the Avengers, for sure, but it slides in nicely for the now, sadly, completed Christopher Nolan-Batman endeavor.",1362441600,,1674,4.291139240506329

Wow! Anyone who saw it should agree with that three lettered observation. Just, WOW! The story is a great finale, the characters are so captivating, I couldn't help becoming emotionally involved with their ups and downs.
I can't say too much, if you haven't seen the movie but have seen the first two stories you are in for a treat, I don't want to spoil the story for you.
If you have seen it then you know how good it is, but blue-ray and a theatre sound system will enhance it!!!
Highly recommended. Wow!!!

 N.B. I haven't got the Ultraviolet digital copy or even own a Blue ray version as yet, I did rent one though. I can't compare the formats. I can only comment on the movie I saw at the cinema and again on a rented blue ray.",1362182400,2,811,4.225806451612903
4425373,4,B004LWZWGK,"This review contains spoiilers. I understand that this movie is trying to be portrayed in the real world, yet there is so much that is unrealistic. Bruce Wayne would never abandon Gotham even if his work was done, and if he did he would always leave a replacment. We will then have to believe that he knew Robin/Blake would find his batcave. But I believe for sure that the real batman would never be so petty as to leave his lifelong father figure Alfred over a woman he never even dated once. Other then that the movie has great action. Bane is truly a bad ass who hammers Gotham into submission. He is truly a force of nature in this movie. That brings me to another problem. I don't believe that Bane would ever be a slave to the wims of anyone wheather it be Talia, or Ra's Al Ghoul. Ra's and Talia are stonch believers in saving the planet also. They would never destroy a city using a atomic weapon. It would have made more sense if he had done it on his own, since he was thrown out of the League of Shadows. But to repeat, Bane is nobody's toy. Talia Al Ghoul was a worthless addition in other words in my opinion.

The fight scene between Bane was good, Batman meets a man who can stand up to him face to face. The end result is Batmans near destruction. One more problem is Batmans silly trust in Catwoman. She not only is a thief, takes him to Bane to be killed, but she also leaves him to die in a hole in the ground. Yet he goes and gives her a program, and also still trusts her to save the city.

So to repeat. The story has alot of holes, from Bane turning into some simplering love slave, to Batman trusting Catman. There is also alot of great stuff. Bane is a great villain, and there is alot of good action.",1362182400,,1727,4.167664670658683

4425383,5,B004LWZWGK,"I wasn't't going to watch this Batman movie, finding the last couple to dark and stressful. But my husband wanted to watch it, and so, here I am. What I loved about this movie was the story of humility and redemption played out so seamlessly from the last movie, The Dark Knight, you'd almost never know there were four years between filming them. Christian Bale was, for once, restrained and excellent as Bruce Wayne/Batman. Until this movie, he just didn't do it right for me. But his fall from grace and resulting brokenness (literally) was some of his best acting.

I loved Anne Hathaway as Cat Woman. She played her just right, not overly sexy, more scrappy and pulled in two directions - will she be the bad guy, or will she end up showing she can be redeemed? Marion Cotillard is mesmerizing as Miranda, good friend of Bruce Wayne and supporter of Batman. I did not recognize one of my faves, Tom Hardy as evil as it gets, Bane, what an amazing performance from this gifted actor. And where were the Oscar people when this movie came out? Just shows how divided and out of touch Hollywood has become with us regular people in recent years. This movie deserved recognition!

I won't put any spoilers in here, but let me just say how much I enjoyed Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the loyal cop, Blake. As always, Michael Caine turned in a difficult performance with his usual brilliance as Alfred, and Gary Oldman as well as Commissioner Gordon. Simply superb performances all around. But it was the story that was the hero in this movie. It could have followed a safer path, but chose a very difficult one, one instead. And for that, I gave this movie 5 stars.

The franchise is successfully rebooted in a spectacular way (cue the fireworks) and I now am looking forward to the next movie, if there is one (not in the know all things Batman movies). If you haven't seen this one, definitely worth watching. It helps to have seen The Dark Knight first, though. I highly recommend this movie!",1362096000,2,1989,4.581460674157303
4425384,2,B004LWZWGK,Disapointing.  No way around saying that.  Bruce Wayne is now a victim of his own success and does not see himself as a good man anymore.  And considering he is acting like a sissy - he may be right.  Don't see this story line continuing.,1362096000,,238,4.222222222222222

4425389,2,B004LWZWGK,"Admittedly hammered while I watched it, I felt like I wasn't having trouble following the plot but was just bored by it.  When Catwoman jumped on the motorcycle and immediately knew how to operate it like a pro i LOL'd.  Suspension of disbelief out the window!  Did I miss the part where she trained on that thing?  Anyway, the prison sequence was silly to me, no guards at the stop to kick prisoners back in when they escape?",1362009600,,426,4.423076923076923
4425390,3,B004LWZWGK,"Maybe I just expect too much out of the entertainment industry.  I guess I expect the film makers to out-do themselves every time.  This was not as original or suspenseful as the first two movies.  I understand trilogies sell - characters, boxed sets, all kinds of ways to make money, but each movie should improve upon the franchise.  No need to have a film just for the sake of explaining the background or holes/ sub-plots of previous movies.  Again, maybe I'm just asking too much.",1362009600,,485,4.658823529411765

4425392,2,B004LWZWGK,"I'm not a hard-core Batman fan(atic), but the Dark Knight series had a grittier feel that the earlier Batman series did not -- and I like that.
This movie's plot seemed poorly organized, but maybe that is because of what I think is its major flaw -- PATHETIC AUDIO MIXING!
I have a true 5.1 digital surround, yet at low or high volume I could barely understand the dialogue. The background music was finely done, but completely out of balance with the voices.
As a person who dabbled in amateur audio mixing for about 5 years, I can say that it is despicable that a major studio release would allow such poor audio work.
Possibly the mix worked better in the theater than on the Blu-Ray -- I don't know to what extent they re-mix for Blu-Ray in this digital age.
Either the actors were mic'd poorly, or nobody bothered to work with the mic signals in post-production, or both, but there are many things that can be easily done that weren't,
both with the mic signals and with their balance with the music and effects signals in the final mix.
So maybe if I had not needed subtitles to know what was being said, the movie would have been less disappointing.
Anne Hathaway was the best thing about it.",1362009600,,1199,4.454545454545454

4425405,4,B004LWZWGK,Awesome movie. If your a fan of the dark knight and batman begins then of course youll like the last movie. It's epic but a little far fetch. The bluray is a perfect example of what a bluray should and sound like. Lacks any real special features though. Makes me wonder if they will re release it later on,1362009600,,305,4.186440677966102
4425406,4,B004LWZWGK,"I heard a review that referred to it as, ""the passion of the Batman"" because of how much Batman suffers in the movie. So I never saw it in the theater and waited until the price had come down on the blu-ray before I got it for home. I didn't think it was nearly as much torture & 'painful' as the reviewer had described. Instead it was a portrait of perseverance and self sacrifice under extreme pain, humiliation and difficulty. Good action.
It did make a good point that well intentioned lies can backfire. The 2nd movie had the cover-ups about Dents crimes (Batman took the blame for them and was accused of Dents murder) and Alfred's destruction of Rachel's letter that she choose Dent over Bruce. Those lies built a foundation of sand that easily crumbled under stress, and the 'better future' that it was hoped that they would provide was a weak future that didn't have the strength to endure.",1362009600,,899,4.555555555555555

4425422,1,B004LWZWGK,"Where to start? How do you make a Batman where ""The Batman"" (yes, apparently The Superman and The Spider-Man insisted on The The) is not in it as much as Commissioner Sid Vicious's '70s moustache or J. Gordon Levitation channeling his older alter Bruce Willis ego from Looper? Don't even get me started on McBane whose voice we finally nailed down as Marvin The Martian underwater after thinking at first he sounded like a Hungarian meets Dutch Goldmember of Austin Powers fame. Then again we spent half the movie trying to figure out how he ate. Did he get everything blended up and suck it through a straw?

Speaking of voice work, what was up with Christian Bale when he put on the Batsuit deciding to adopt a Tom Waits meets Michael Keaton's voice from an earlier Batman? Or how about The Bathead's big fight scene with Darth Bane Vader where he decides it's a good idea to headbutt a guy with a huge chunk of metal attached right down the middle of his skull? Let alone The Batdude takes about six straight punches to the head and not a single drop of blood pours out. Is his head made out of the same material as his titanium suit?

The story is so tired and old--madman holds city hostage with nuclear device (which apparently you can just fly out to the horizon and explode and not a drop of radiation will hit Pittsburgh...oops, Gotham). What's laughable are even more numerous preposterous scenes. Bad guys down in the sewer. OK, all you SWAT guys in full combat gear, let Commissioner Moustache go down first in a business suit and allow him to be captured by the bad guys. Good plan.

Then while the commissioner (let me repeat that--the very top guy in the police force) is in a hospital bed, there appears to be zero police personnel posted in the hospital let alone on his floor or by the doors to protect him.

Apparently because they were paying the actors so much money there was no budget for lighting either as it's more like the Dark ""Night"" Doesn't Rise. Plus we get gratuitous Liam ""Quickly! There's no time!"" Neeson, Morgan ""Driving Miss"" Freeman and even Matthew ""Birdy"" Modine (who deserved an Oscar for his excellent walkie-talkie work). But it's when Cillian Murphy and Marion By Cottiyard show up to join J. Gordon Liddy in this movie, I got the feeling director Christopher Nolan must've filmed Inception and this movie at the same time to save money.

Did I mention how extremely slow the whole thing plods along? Even the special effects are ruined by too much talking and explanation after they're done.

What will really make you laugh is how the police force decide to form one mass formation and charge both into a tunnel and later in the movie at the bad guys down a single street. It was like military tactics had not advanced an inch from the Civil War.

The extras...well, after two hours and 40+ minutes of this nonsense, I was done. Let someone with a tolerance for more ridiculous filmmaking comment on them. (And, wow, not a single mention of Anne Hathaway until now!)",1361750400,12,3012,4.587360594795539

4425443,1,B004LWZWGK,"After the game of chess that was 'The Dark Knight', this bloated, corny, and plain idiotic movie slaps you in the face with how hard it sucks. While nothing could be as campy as Tim Burton's take on Batman, this movie certainly gives 'The Phantom Menace' a run for its money as the biggest franchise flop in recent memory. The 5-star reviews here can only be from teenage boys and/or franchise groupies who uncritically gobble down any output squeezed out by money-grubbing studios.

The problems with this mess of a movie are endless. Mainly, it's just boring and completely unbelievable...and way too long. There's not nearly enough Batman and, when he is onscreen, he mostly gets his ass kicked. Meanwhile the villians are capable of doing everything successfully. As a result, Batman just comes off as tired and lame. The movie's war scenes smack more of Iron Man than Dark Knight. The movie desperately tries to prove how bad-ass Bane is, but he's just...not. Truly, I expected a scene with Bane loading cancer surviving, crippled grandmas into a bus and blowing them up. It was that silly. All the subplots slow things down: I could care less about the backstory of the chick with the accent, Robin (gee, I didn't see that coming two hours before it happened), the corporate stuff, Alfred's blubbering. Dull, dull, dull. Lastly, the sound is amateur. Everything is pushed up front, so it's often difficult to understand dialogue. Just a disorganized mess.

And the plot holes! How any partially educated person could watch this film and not reject it outright is beyond me. We made a game out of coming up with things that made no sense:
- If the room with the nuke could be flooded, why didn't Morgan Freeman do so when Bane was in the room stealing it?
- Why's it hard for Bruce Wayne to prove he'd been set-up financially when all trades were shut down and he lost everything while a terrorist was controlling the stock exchange?
- Why did the creepy businessman want Wayne Enterprises if it was falling apart? Why work with Bane? Hmmmm....""Plan A: Try to buy Wayne out. Plan B: Hire a terrorist with a freaky mask to help me out."" LOL!
- In what universe is a fingerprint at the exchange enough ID to buy 5 shares of Microsoft stock, let alone lose billions?
- How does low-level theif Catwoman hop onto a high-tech Batcycle and instantly know how to operate it?
- If the chick with the accent wanted to kill Bruce Wayne or destroy Gotham, why not just do it? Why wait a month?
- If she hates Bruce Wayne so much, why sleep with him? She gained nothing by doing that.
- Liam 'League of Shadows' Neeson doesn't find out his babymama is sent to prison, nor that she was pregnant and had a kid. But he DOES hear that she was killed there? How? The only people who would have known she was killed...were in prison!
- I totally believe that Bane could protect a little girl from being gang raped and killed in an Arab prison full of crazies.
- Did anyone ever find this 'League of Shadows' nonsense anything less than inane and hilarious?
- Why would the cops attack Bane and his men with billy clubs? Why not wait to see if the bomb is disarmed? If it's not, everyone is dead anyway. If it is, the army will be moving in.
- How exactly does a nuke powered device provide endless clean energy for a whole city? Oh, don't ask that...we need a nuke in the city so Bane can use it to take control.
- Where did Commissioner Gordon learn to deactivate a high tech, unstable nuke?
- A technology that can wipe your record clean? Um...""So, Miss Kyle, show me your work history for the last ten years? Oh you have any? Thank you for your interest, we'll let you know."" Technology of this kind isn't possible.
- It's nice to know if you have a broken back, chest, and whatever that you can recover in a few weeks by being punched in the back, strung up with rope overnight, and eating nothing but prison food while living in a hole in the desert. Pushups and situps work wonders too.
- A hole/prison wired for TV? And you can get channels from the US.
- After Batman is stabbed so that he is helpless, how does he suddenly recover enough to chase down the nuke?
- After the sewers were blown up, the football field just couldn't take it. But streets with skyscrapers are AOK.
- If you can just knock down sewer walls, you can access the most secret caches of technology held by rich corporations.
- If the autopilot was fixed, why did Batman lie and say it wasn't? And since he knew it had been fixed, why not just haul the bomb off thirty minutes earlier and get it somewhere really far away? Why waste time in a chase to reinstall it into the sci-fi, Morgan Freeman gadget?
- Exactly what medical condition related to Bane's mouth is controlled by a silly looking mask?
- Really? In a big city like Gotham, every cop in the city is sent into the sewers. Every single one?

I don't want to give the impression with this list that we thought deeply about this at all. We didn't. This is just what we came up with while making fun of this stupid movie.

I've always felt there was so much more then meets the eye when it came to that character, but even I didn't see Batman's full potential until Christopher Nolan took the reigns. In all 3 of his Batman films, Nolan made the Dark Knight as realistic as possible, with characters we can relate to, real situations, and real dialogue, that's free of all the ridiculous puns it's predecessors loved so much. The third installment takes places eight years after the events of the Dark Knight, when Gotham has been safe, and the Batman wasn't needed. That is until the powerful Bane shows up. Unlike the first two, this script does not follow the original comic story and skews off in several different ways. Unless you're a longtime fan of the series, you won't realize it, but for us fans, there are some very unexpected developments, which I assume were thrown in to throw off even the most die-hard fans. As for the film, it was amazing in every way possible and was everything I expect from Christopher Nolan, but still, it lacked something and that something was an extraordinary villain. We were all spoiled in The Dark Knight with one of the best performances of all time, and while this film is remarkable, it's lacking a stand out performance from one of it's stars.

...with his ability to obfuscate.

I do realize that I'm going to be in the vast minority with my stance on The Dark Knight Rises, but I'm used to that, so I'm just going to go with it.

I have one thing to say for Christopher Nolan: he's a magician when it comes to making movies. I mean that in a very literal sense. He uses flashy action to distract us from the holes he leaves behind in the story. We can't see them, because we're too busy looking in the other direction.

Or maybe it's just that Marvel has set the bar so high with their string of excellent adaptions that I'm just no longer satisfied with interpretations. Maybe if it was more explicit that these are interpretations, I'd be happier. DC/Warner Brothers could just slap their Elseworlds label on  these things, and I might be more accepting of them. As it is, though, there are so many things that aren't Batman in these movies that I have a hard time dealing with it. Like in Burton's Batman when Alfred brings Vicki Vale down into the Batcave. What?

Unfortunately, Nolan has plenty of those moments himself. Like in Batman Begins when Wayne allows Lucius Fox to know that he's Batman. Whereas that was almost acceptable in that movie, those inconsistencies with the source material have continued to snowball to the point that by the time we get to Rises, I can't accept them. I mean, by the end of The Dark Knight Rises half of everyone knows that Wayne is Batman. And we're just supposed to believe that some random cop walks up to Wayne and just knows? Seriously. I get that Nolan needs that for his story, but, give me a break, he knew because he saw it in Wayne's face? At least Tim Drake did the research to figure out that Wayne is Batman. And I don't want to give spoilers, but having his actual name be Robin? It just makes me cringe.

However, the big issue for me, the thing that set the big disconnect for me, is that we're supposed to believe that this is 8 years later. That Bruce Wayne just quit being Batman and went into seclusion. I get that Nolan is trying to give us a sense of Miller's Dark Knight comics in which Batman had quit and was in seclusion, but that was because he got old. He even gives us a cane like Wayne uses in Batman Beyond, but, again, in those he got old; Nolan wants us to believe that Wayne just quit. I can't buy it. I absolutely can not buy it.

This is where I understand the difference between me, someone that grew up reading Batman comics and was heavily invested in Batman lore for...well, longer than I should have been, and the vast majority of people out there that don't have that same investment. These details aren't important to them. I get that. I also get that I am not really the target audience for the movie. I was the target audience for Batman Begins, because that one was more focused on the fans of the comic, but these last two, after hooking everyone in, have been focused on the general consumer.

Even so, the idea with Nolan's Batman is that he is set in the ""real world,"" and, as such, I still can not accept this 8 year hiatus. He wants us to buy into too many unrealistic ideas:
1. After 8 years of no Batman, people are still talking about him. Give me a break. Culturally, we barely hold onto anything for 8 days, and Nolan expects us to believe that people are still saying, after 8 years, ""is he coming back?"" Not to mention the fact that he has kids, like 10-year-old kids, talking about Batman as if he's a reality to them. Or was a reality to them. Yes, all of this bothers me, because none of it's how the real world works.
If he'd made it a year after the events of Dark Knight, maybe even two, it would have been plausible.
2. There's a Harvey Dent Day and people care about it. See point 1. No one would care after 8 years. Well, they wouldn't care beyond the fact that it was a day off from work. And it's not clear that they, the common people, do get a day off from work.
3. After 8 years, Wayne just puts the suit back on, and it's like he never quit. There are so many problems with this:

There is an implication, a strong implication, that Wayne has been doing nothing to ""stay in shape"" during his seclusion (except, maybe, shooting some arrows). He's just been sulking about. Bodies deteriorate pretty quickly. After just a few months, he would have lost his edge and begun losing muscle mass. After a year, it would have taken considerable training to be able to get back into shape. After 8 years?
Aside from the staying in shape aspect of it, Wayne has definitely not been sparring or doing any kind of combat training in those 8 years. As an example of what not sparring can do, you can look at the Foreman/Ali championship fight. Foreman was unable to spar for the entire month leading up to the bout due to an eye injury, and just that one month of not training threw his fighting off so much that he couldn't compete. (Ali won and refused to ever allow Foreman a re-match.)
On top of all the not staying in shape and not sparring, Wayne has suffered some sort of debilitating injury that has caused him to need a cane to walk. His body is in bad shape. No, it's in horrible shape. So... 8 years of lounging in seclusion and he can't even walk under his own power, but we're supposed to believe that a high tech knee brace returns him to fighting form? Are you kidding me?
While it is true that Alfred voiced concern over these issues, it was given in the sense that it would be a ""bad idea"" to get back into costume. In truth, it would have been an impossibility. Not to put the costume back on but certainly impossible to be Batman again just like that.

If Nolan wants us to believe that this is a Batman that could be in the real world, he needs to keep him in the real world. And don't get me started on the ""fusion bomb,"" because all of that was just bad science. I'll buy into Wayne creating a fusion reactor, but not turning it into a ""time bomb"" in the way it was done in the movie. They're equating it to a meltdown in a nuclear reactor, and those things just don't happen on a schedule. Not to mention the last minute save after 5 months. It just doesn't get more cliche than that.

Nolan also uses sleight-of-hand to hide facts from us. I don't have an issue with this in a general sense, but it takes away from the enjoyment of watching it again. He did this very successfully in The Prestige, because, in that one, he gave us the clues to figure out what was going on so that when the reveal happened it was your own fault for not figuring it out. I like that kind of cleverness, and doing it that way does make for good repeat viewing, because you can go back and see where the clues were that you missed (like in The Sixth Sense). I dislike, though, when not only is the information hidden but the fact that there is information hidden is hidden. Of course, then, when you do see that coming because you have more lore than the average viewer, there's no surprise, so that twist didn't throw me at all, and that made the viewing experience... less than it could have been.

Having said all of that, don't take it that I'm saying that it's a bad movie. It's not. It's a good movie, and I'm glad I saw it in the theater. The acting is good (Oldman is still great as Gordon, Hathaway was good, Gordon-Levitt is quite good), and the action and fight sequences are spectacular.

The pacing was well balanced given the multitude of characters and the plot evolved nicely (although you really had to recall the first two movies for it all to fit together). The acting was fantastic for the most part and I was blown away by Hathaway's Catwoman in particular. (Anyone who says Hathaway's acting here is terrible is saying that based purely on not liking Anne Hathaway.) But at the point Bane takes control of Gotham, the movie REALLY drags. Instead of focusing on Bruce Wayne in prison, the focus is on the siege. Sadly, it's also at this point in the movie that Bane becomes uninteresting. So, 30 minutes could have been cut out of the movie here. During the siege we also see more of a focus on 'Robin' whose backstory is so reinvented, it's not even Robin anymore. As much as I like Joseph Gordon-Levitt, his role in this movie wasn't necessary especially when you consider there isn't going to be another Nolan Batman movie. I also didn't like the twist involving Raz Al Ghaul's descendent which felt like a last-minute, desperate attempt to surprise the audience. Bane should have been the sole agent of vengeance, as he was in the comics. Finally, how the HECK did Batman fly the bomb more than 6 miles out of the city in less than a minute? Sigh, flashes of the 1966 Batman movie. Like The Dark Knight before it, TDKR suffers from trying to do too much. At least Cillian Murphy's Scarecrow had a good cameo.

4425503,2,B004LWZWGK,"Why keep Gotham around? The movie once again threatened Gotham with it's destruction, snore... I found myself really just completely bored with the whole concept. The pace was slow, the story uninteresting, the characters worn out...
The biggest mistake from my perspective was the breaking of the invisible boundries of Gotham, I realize the previous movies also did this, but I still felt like Gotham was somehow isolated from the rest of the world in the first 2... I lost that feeling here and it really broke the Batman mytique for me.

4425516,4,B004LWZWGK,"I own every Batman movie that has come out as far back as the first one with Michael Keaton (whom did a surprisingly good job at the role) as The Batman. This one, Dark Night Rises is perhaps the best one. In all the movies there is always New gadgets, New vehicles, and there is always ""The Hotties"". I think this one was superior to the others, in that the Batman is vulnerable in ways as never before...Oh sure, The Batman is always taking a licking, but this time he couldn't just go to his bat belt, or Robin, or BatGirl his bat friends, before, he always came out on top. But in this latest one, Batman (and Christian Bale is my favorite at the role) has practically given up after the death of his beloved in the last movie...for the first time, Batman can't just grab a gadget or dramatically fly away, this time he is nearly beaten by himself...great stuff! I loved it! I loved the characters as well. Jane Hathaway fills in the best role of HOT-TEE! As well as being the mysterious Cat Burgler/ Woman Ever!  You have to watch it at least three times to catch all the good stuff going on off centre. Bale is always good in anything he plays in, and Morgan Freeman...?  How old IS that guy!? But he, too,  always plays a good character. He's like everybody's ideal president, grandpa or something, even made a great God in Bruce Almighty!  And the dude in the mask...disturbing...But the action, the neat gadgets and vehicles...fantastic. I just wish I'd have watched it in 3D...",1361318400,,1487,4.455882352941177

4425520,5,B004LWZWGK,"This movie was fantastic. The villans were dark & twisted, Batman was strong but vulnerable which I loved since he's just a guy with great gadgets. The story pulled from the comic base with some really interesting changes. I love Fox, Commissioner Gordon, and Blake, but my favorite addition was Serena Kyle (aka Catwoman). This is by far the best depiction of her character. She has sass without being cheesy and she's clearly an anti-hero more than a villan which is super compelling. Great movie and definitely makes me want another go round.",1361232000,,545,4.870967741935484

If you liked the first and second movies of this trilogy then you will love this last one. You really have to see the first to appreciate the last but you can still ""get it"" without viewing them and I think you will enjoy it.
I would caution against viewing this with young children as it is quite graphic at times.",1361232000,,481,4.355555555555555

4425541,5,B004LWZWGK,"This was the final chapter in the Christopher Nolan Batman trilogy and though there felt like that might have been a few flaws here and there, overall, it was a wonderful finish to Nolan's vision.  And there are a few moments that felt a bit Inception-like, but in the spirit of spoiler-free, I am not saying anything.

I wish we could have had more actual face from Tom Hardy playing Bane. But hey, if you look deep enough into the story, I think if you were a fan of the first two, you'll be fine with this one.  And Catwoman was played nicely by Anne Hathaway, and I love the journey that Jospeph Gordon-Levitt's went on throughout.

But I have to say this here... looking at the blu-ray cover art... look at the rubble to the left of Batman's belt buckle... Am I daft or does that look like Superman's chest emblem in the rubble there?  IS that some form homage to the ""Man of Steel"" movie that Nolan is producing?  Or am I just losing it?

Well i just rented the dvd and is not the same movie i saw in the theaters. Its worse. I really won't go into the movie yet, this review is just going to be about the dvd. They watered down the sound effects in the bane/batman confrontation so
batman getting his weak ass stomped wasn't asexciting for me. And they cut out bane
breaking his back! What!!! Ill be back

UPDATE
Well Amazon i am back. I am going to take my time with this review, because the day i saw the trailer for this joke of a movie i put my life on hold for 7 months until i saw the trilogy. Batman
begins and the Dark Knight, two of the best
movie experiences i ever had in my life. Then
came tdkr not only the most anticipated movie
of my life, but the most anticipated ANYTHING
 in my life. I don't think i looked foward to
 anything like this movie. First, we start with the
 trailers. Not really trailers fitting this movie but
whatever. But this was the first bad feeling i got
but i let it slide. The Superman trailer was alright
though. So starts the movie. The Syncopy and
DC logos were awesome and they got me excited
about a great movie. Then we had the classic
way Nolan starts out the Batman movies with
some kind of effect that displays the bat symbol.
Excellent.

Then the first voice. Commisioner Gordon. It did not sound anything like the voice from the other two movies but whatever it is 8 yrs later.
Ok hes talking about harvey kind of reminding
us of how the last one ended. Okay. The
problem started when i heard Banes voice. What the f*** kind of a voice is that?! Ill be back.

UPDATE
Now lets bring in our star, Bruce Wayne. He comes in hobbiling on a cane like an old man.
What the hell happened? Last time i remember
he was running from the cops. So when did he
 become a cripple? Then Selyna kicks his cane
out from under him like a helpless child. At that
 point i knew this movie was not going to live up
 to my expectations. But it was only the first 15
min of the movie so i tried not to jump to
conclusions. Then this frickin kid comes to see
him and tells him that he knows hes batman. Why? Because of a freakin look on his face. Really?? Ill be back.",1361059200,,2290,4.09375
4425565,5,B004LWZWGK,"I loved Christpher Nolan's revamp of the Batman world.  I have loved Batman/Bruce Wayne since Michael Keaton donned the cape back in 1991.  Batman is my favorite super hero because he is just a man, no super powers like Superman or Spiderman, just a lot of wonderful toys (were did he get them?).  I think that of all the actors to have taken the Batman/Bruce Wayne persona Christian Bale is by far my favorite.  I loved this movie and the other 2 as well. I watch them again and again at least a couple times a month.  It is just an incredible trilogy and I hope there will be more to come.

4425572,1,B004LWZWGK,"Liked the movie. Not as good as Dark Knight (imho) - Bane can't touch Ledger's Joker. But, I'm not here to debate acting or video quality - others have done that very well already.

What drags this title down to 1 star for me is that Warner Bros. opted for NO CHOICE for digital copy! Unlike Dark Knight, I get Ultraviolet or nothing. I'm not going to be sucked down into the debate pit about which format is better. I prefer iTunes but others might like the new Ultraviolet. This disk is part of a flotilla of titles that have been Ultraviolet only - just to avoid a small iTunes charge. And with the exception of Deathly Hallows, the studios have been unwilling to trade leaving me with a format I can't use. I prefer supporting the entertainment business through many Blu-ray purchases but the studios should know that limiting options only encourages more people to torrent sites which is bad for everyone. Equal empathy for those who did not want to or could not use the iTunes-only digitals for the same reasons.

So, thumbs down Warner Bros for choosing greed over customer service! Let's vote with our dollars and NOT support this kind of product!

This movie in particular did not offer anything spectacular and rather came across with major cheesy and lame effect's and sequences and i'm glad i'm not the only one who sees this and thank's to those who can think for themselves and not be brainwashed by the media into thinking this garbage franchise is good.",1360800000,11,774,4.7407407407407405

I mean, come on, the bad guy is going to exact his revenge on Batman by making Gotham suffer for months and then right when he is going to destroy Gotham is thwarted by some last minute BS.

I understand that this is sort of the story of Batman, long drawn out plots, but this takes the cake.

I enjoyed the 2nd movie the best, the first one was pretty good, but this one sucked and sucked and sucked and then sucked some more (I needed four 'sucks' to emphasize the fact that this movie seemingly never ends).",1360713600,,624,4.183333333333334

4425617,3,B004LWZWGK,"I am a huge Batman fan and thought ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight"" were some awesome movies. That's why I couldn't wait to see this one, especially since ""The Dark Knight"" ended with Batman going on the run. I've got to admit, I have mixed feelings for this one. In some ways it's an awesome movie, and in others it's crap.

First let me say that the length of the movie is far too long (at least ten minutes too long). It's 2 hours 45 minutes long and could have easily been 2 hours 35 minutes long. Alfred argues with Bruce Wayne a lot, in three scenes, and in the third scene (which is about 4 minutes long) he decides to leave, refusing to help Batman at all. I don't know about you, but I perfer Batman's and Alfred's relationship better in the previous Batmans as opposed to this one. Plus it's one of the main reasons that makes this film so long and slow moving. Take away those scenes and you take away 7 minutes of the movie. They could have also done without the love scene between Batman and Miranda. That's another 3 minutes.

It's also funny how director Christopher Nolan didn't want to use the Riddler in this film because he thought the Riddler was too simular to the Joker, and yet Bane's character in this film is characterized very much like Heath Ledger's Joker by preying on people's fears and gullibility to manipulate them into doing his dirty work just like the Joker did in ""The Dark Knight"".

Not to mention the ridiculous ending which could have been tweaked just a little bit to make a much better ending.

This film does have some good things about it though. Bane is portrayed a lot more realistically and scarier than in other Batmans, performances are pretty good for the most part, the film does have a good plot, and the action scenes (when they finally get to them) are pretty exciting (especially when Batman and the city's cops attempt to retake the city from Bane and stop the bomb from going off).

All in all, it's worth checking out, but I wouldn't waste my money on buying it. But in the end it's all up to you. If it turns out you like, then buy it, but it wasn't for me. And it's a shame too because I think with a little bit of tweaking, it could have been the best Batman movie of them all.",1360713600,,2243,4.330952380952381
4425618,4,B004LWZWGK,"Rarely do I have as many mixed feelings and opinions after having seen The Dark Knight Rises. It felt epic. It was moving. It felt long. It worked well as a book-end to the trilogy. It felt forced.

The performances were excellent. Anne Hathaway as Selena the Cat Woman. Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Blake, Michael Caine, Tom Hardy, Gary Oldman and so on.

The last 30 minutes were just fantastic, worth the previous two-plus hour wait. Better than the Batman Begins but fell short of Heath Ledger's Dark Knight (could that movie been as good without him?).

Overall I think it suffered from being too grandiose by trying to do too much. The multiple acts didn't click together as they did in The Dark Knight. The suspension of disbelief was less ""suspended"" than utterly confounded ... how did Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) go from emaciated cripple to muscle-bound butt-kicker in one day?<

And the finale, while enjoyable, had so many twists and conveniences it would have made my head spin if I wasn't enjoying it so much.

To be fair, I think the best way to judge The Dark Knight Rises is as an attempt to close an epic story-line with a focus on continuity between the three films, reinforcing Nolan's conflicting ""hopeful nihilism"" philosophy. I look forward to watching all three back-to-back to see his vision uninterrupted by tragic events and the passage of time.",1360713600,,1369,4.808510638297872

4425620,5,B004LWZWGK,"I've loved all 3 Christopher Nolan Batman movies.  The Dark Knight Rises is no different.

As the final chapter in a 3 act movement, this movie was bound to be a bit of a let down after the The Dark Knight.  It would probably be impossible to top Heath Ledger as Joker and the intensity of that movie.  For that matter, I don't think that Nolan tried.  I think he just went about his work.  In that way, the choice of Bane was the villain is fantastic.  If you watch this movie and aren't creeped out by Bane, I am not sure what's wrong with you.

Bane is an unbelievable villain.  He embodies evil and yet Nolan finds way to humanize him and also to show how psychotic he really is.

As for the story of the Selina Kyle, Anne Hathaway does a nice job of filling a role that is a tough one in the Nolan universe just because Kyle is a much stronger character than any other woman has been in this trilogy.  Does she fit what the traditional comic book fan would say is Catwoman?  Maybe.  Maybe not.  In the context of the Nolan Batman universe, she is a good fit and she adds a bit of continuity to the story between Batman and Bane.

The big question of any series is whether or not the main character evolves over the course of the story.  In the case of Bruce Wayne/Batman, he would have to or he would be dead.  I guess the big question for anyone watching the movie is did Wayne change enough?  Did Wayne find peace?

In total, I was probably predetermined to like this Batman movie.  Is it perfect?  No.  Is it a good ending for the series?  Yes.  Should you watch it?  Absolutely.",1360713600,,1587,4.192691029900332

After 8 years, Bruce is hobbling around with a cane like he's an old man who just got beat up last week?  Sure he may have sustained injuries that a normal guy would be like this without seeking treatment....but he's a billionaire.  And in this batman world of super gadgets, we're supposed to believe he hasn't gotten the best doctors in the world to either fix him or use artificial means to make himself more of a ""bionic"" batman?

Don't even get me started on the plot holes.

The second movie, ""The Dark Knight,"" is so good that it is almost unfair to compare this one with the first sequel. It is a cool wrap-up of the Bruce Wayne's story and still manages to be entertaining. There are so many allegories and powerful scenes, but it feels like that the last part of the trilogy has also lost its vitality in finishing the story.",1359763200,,434,4.4375
4425796,3,B004LWZWGK,"As ""The Dark Knight Rises"" opens - picking up eight years after the events chronicled in ""The Dark Knight"" - we find eccentric billionaire Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) in a rather depressed state of mind.  He has essentially withdrawn from the world, given up his crime-fighting ways and hung up his Batman cape, having largely fallen out of favor with the citizens of Gotham City who see him less as a hero and more as an out-of-control killer.  Only his loyal servant/father-figure, Albert (the venerable Michael Caine), cares enough to give him a swift kick in the rear-end every now and again to try to get him to move on with his life.  All this changes, however, when the fascistic Bane comes to town, a figure so consummate in his villainy that he is willing to blow up the whole blasted metropolis with an atomic bomb if he doesn't get what he wants.

Though Christopher Nolan`s latest entry in the series is nowhere near as engaging or as gripping as the previous two (especially the second), the movie attains a certain historical and contemporary significance with its echoes of both the French Revolution and Occupy Wall Street, though, oddly, the movie seems intent on putting us on the wrong side of history in both cases (rooting for a corrupt status quo and against a grass-roots uprising against that corruption).

And, let's face it, Heath Ledger's Joker - one of the richest villains in all of movie history - would be a hard act for anyone to follow, and Tom Hardy`s Bane, even with his mask and amplified voice, seems a mite tame in comparison.  On his own terms, however, Bane is reasonably effective, if only because of the implacable nature of his evil, which manifests itself in his willingness to sacrifice masses of innocent people to enrich his own power.

Thanks partly to the muddled politics and partly to the overstuffed nature of the storytelling, the movie never finds a way to fully engage its audience in the world it's created. In fact, in comparison to the narrative sturdiness of its two predecessors, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" comes across as a bit of a messy affair overall, with subplots spinning off in all directions, with little gravity at the core to bind it all together. A case in point: while Anne Hathaway brings a degree of flirtatious charm to the role of cat burglar-turned-Cat Woman, the character as a whole seems like an afterthought, tacked onto the story to provide some counter-balancing romantic interludes for the sullen, all but monastic Wayne.

The cast is rounded out by Gary Oldman, Marion Cotillard, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Aaron Eckhart and others, but, more so than in the two previous entries in the series, the real stars of ""The Dark Night Rises"" turn out to be the visual pyrotechnics and special effects.",1359763200,14,2802,4.8108108108108105

I thought an actual Blu ray case would be inside the statue; not the case. Since I'm a huge fan of the trilogy, I will be buying the collector's trilogy that is supposedly coming out later this year, so its not a big deal. If you are a huge fan of the movies, I definitely recommend this edition, however if you just want the movie to complete your trilogy, then I'd grab the regular Blu ray which contains the same features.",1359763200,,704,4.2611940298507465

4425800,3,B004LWZWGK,"This movie does not live up to it's predecessor.  A trend one may find in modern film is to make a film long in order to create a sense of ""epicness"".  Sadly, this film does a better job of creating a sense of boredness.  I feel this film suffers from a story line that just doesn't have what it takes to make it a contender in my mind. It's either that, or the fact that the editors seemed to love the story so much that they allowed their final product to drag a relatively uninspired plot to drag on nearly three hours.

The acting in the film was great, which is why I still give the film three stars.  Anne Hathaway plays her character very well. I don't think Michael Caine could have been a better choice for his character, and he plays it to perfection.  Christian Bale of course plays a solid Batman...

I enjoyed the first two in the ""Dark Knight"" series far, far better in terms of their story lines and action than this third installment.  Anne Hathaway is a wonderful ""eye candy"" but her role (not acting) is weak.  Marion Cotillard's smoldering beauty is absolutely stunning.",1359676800,,584,4.858585858585859

Nope! Maybe the director was missing some script pages or the editor had a vendetta against the producer...
The story weaves its way without any apparent purpose and simply became a waste of time. Yeah, I know, movies are supposed to entertain and not necessarily enlighten. This just makes me wish for a graphic novel version (second millennium-speak for what had been known as a comic book. Similar to calling a motorized scooter a personal, green energy, low carbon footprint, transportation device.).
Bottom line, not going to add this to my batman DVD collection.
The story line was so weak that when last seen, our hero is flying a nuclear device out over a bay, we see the timer clicking down to 4,3,2 seconds, pan to hero's face, then wide shot of a detonation. Of course all characters observing the detonation do not suffer any retinal damage so probably will not have any flash burns or subsequent radiation sickness either. Probably a low carbon footprint, green energy, nuclear device?

I go to entertainment to be... entertained. I play games and watch movies for raw emotion. How much a movie can get me caught up in a moment, how much it can make me care, how invested I am, and how much it can simply make me feel, these things are what's important to me. And that's what this movie has in spades. Sure, it's got sub par writing, but let me tell you this; I enjoy this movie far more than many other movies which are considered masterpieces. The Dark Knight Rises evokes so much in me. It draws raw emotion. And that's what I look for in my entertainment.

4425834,5,B004LWZWGK,What a good way to end the trilogy. I believe this was the best of any Batman series. I think this is the Batman that Bob Cane had in mind when created this character. I think everybody should see this movie it was awesome.,1359417600,,223,4.090909090909091

I'm generally tired of the ""angst filled self-doubting hero"" type characters that are so common and Batman in this movie is no exception.  However, the most irritating thing about the movie was the OWS language spouted by just about every character in the movie.  I've seen the movie three times now and it gets more irritating with every viewing.  There are also many logical flaws in the movie's plot which I won't detail.

On the plus side.  The last section of the movie where Batman finally gets his butt in gear is good.  I found the ending very good and satisfying.",1359417600,,619,4.572727272727272

Features a lot of familiar faces (Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman) and brings some new commonly featured Batman characters (Catwoman, Bane, and a hint toward another). Although it is a lengthy movie, it demands your attention the whole way through, you won't want to take breaks. lots of clues given to the die hard Batman fans, like myself (hopefully it doesn't make this review too biased lol). Like I said in the title, hate that this is the end of Nolan's Batman movies, but man what an epic ending! Any Batman fan should have already seen this movie in theaters, and to all those not into Batman, you're missing out on an saga, you should definitely check them out!!!",1359417600,,747,4.753846153846154

The Dark Knight is still probably my favorite of the three movies however this is not very far behind. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone that has 2.5 hours of free time.

It had a very slow pace for the first two hours, developing a very in-depth storyline, but in the end rushed it to a close, without explaining a lot. And why? I saw much in the first two hours that could have been cut, to make room for much more fulfilling ending. But instead, in the end felt let down. Also, why introduce a new character to become Robin, when there are already three existing character choices from the comics? Also, why introduce him at all in this film?",1359331200,,558,4.375

4425862,5,B004LWZWGK,"Not the Batman I read when I was young, but entertaining. Anne Hathaway was a perfect choice as Catwoman. She is hot in tights as well as in a dress. The action was excellent.

4425863,4,B004LWZWGK,"I won't comment the movie itself, there are other reviews for that. Just be sure that, if a movie review says TDKR is AWESOME, they're right. If not, it's just plain wrong.

The product though is a little less great. The cowl looks good, the artwork and the way they glued is to the base is very good. There's a few scratches, emphasizing the idea of a broken mask.

But it's small. It is not the size you think it'll be. There's no way someone could fit a human head inside that cowl. Maybe, just maybe, a baby's head. That's the main problem. Also, the 3 discs come inside the base of the cowl. They fit through an entrance on the back. They are arranged in an awful disc holder, with the 3 discs on top of each other, in a way you'll have to remove the top one to take the bottom one. For the cowl to hold the discs thay invented this holder, which takes just the necessary space to hold the discs. You won't have a standart DVD/Blu-ray cover, and the artwork is too simple.

Except for that, it really is a great item to have and show your friends. If I had had the opportunity to see it, and hold it before buying, in a store, I'd have thought harder about buying it or not, but I'd have bought it anyway. I certainly don't regret buying it. For Nolan or TDKR fans, that's a must-have item. Actually, for Batman fans in general.

I ordered from Brazil, it took less that 2 weeks to arrive.
For portuguese-speakers: portuguese subtitles and audio.",1359331200,,1451,4.2846715328467155
4425864,5,B004LWZWGK,"If you enjoyed the first two in Chris Nolan's trilogy you'll enjoy this one. Not as much Batman in this one as I'd like but the parts he WAS in I loved. One of my favoriite Superheroes of all time in a more realistic perspective than any other previous movies. Some supreme acting from all. Sir Michael Caine has set a new bar on Alfred. In the comics he always had a larger role in what Batman did and was refreshing to see it in these movies. Gary Oldman is one of my all time faves and he delievers very well as Gordan. Joseph Gorden Levitt as uh Blake is also something seen in the comics but with a Nolan twist to be sure. Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle reminisce of Batman: Year One. Though in a sexy tight Catsuit(pun intended) she is still agile like a cat and just as viscous at times.  Christian Bale as Wayne and The Dark Knight himself was topnotch. I could go on about each of the actors in this movie but I cannot finish without mentioning Tom Hardy. Seeing him in other films I trusted his acting and boy was I correct to do so. At times he didn't seem all that scary, but those times he was I got chills. I was happy to see a normal sized person with extreme strength. (No Batman and Robin Bane here) This is the calculating Bane I recall from the comics. Once again changed slightly to fit in the Chris Nolan Universe. This Movie, as long as it was, could have been longer. The almost 3 hour movie seemed to fly by for me. For those that complain bout the slow parts don't ignore them, they're there to push the story along so pay attention. If you're a Batman fan put it in your collection and enjoy it often. If not a fan watch it, enjoy the film, then buy it. Rumors of an ultimate edition sounds promising but until then I will enjoy the one I have. I bought the DVD version but if you have an HD set and Blue Ray set I suggest going that route to really take advantage of the IMAX format which is near double the size of your standard 35mm print for you aficionados. If the new ""Man of Steel"" movie is even close to this version of Batman I'll be adding that to my collection as well.",1359331200,,2104,4.131707317073171

4425867,5,B004LWZWGK,"I am in the minority with these films. I thought the Dark Knight was a step back from Batman Begins... It was just too much overall. The Dark Knight Rises is the most somber and emotionally compelling of the three. ""Rises"" was less about action and more about character development.

4425885,2,B004LWZWGK,"After all the hype, we thought this might be a good choice. We were wrong. Boring and predictable dialogue and plot. Several times we just looked at each other and admitted we had no idea what was going on. Flat acting added to the dullness of it all.

Kids might find the action too intense but this is a fantastic movie. My only qualm is that I would rather have an Amazon digital copy as opposed to the Ultra-Violet. It is my understanding though that the Ultra-violet copy can be traded for an iTunes copy.",1359158400,,429,4.430379746835443

4425902,2,B004LWZWGK,"Disappointed. Some great action scenes, but not much else to enjoy. Didn't remember Batman's voice being so ridiculously low in the other movies. Couldn't decide if Bane's voice was comical rather than intimidating.",1358985600,,215,5.545454545454546

4425904,5,B004LWZWGK,"I thought the movie had great twists and turns, a great plot and also the action was good. Is it just me though or does Batman always seem to get his butt kicked. One thing I didn't like in the movie was CatWoman. I think she was no where near as good as Michelle Pheiffer.

I thought Tom Hardy played a good Bane, I liked him in Warrior as well. This movie was a great ending to the trilogy, but I wished they would have made another in the series. This was my favorite of the 3 movies in the series. I wonder if people would have liked The Dark Knight Rises as much as they did if Heath Ledger wouldn't have died around the time it came out? Don't get me wrong all three are great and I thought Heath played a better joker than Jack but I enjoyed the last of the trilogy the most.",1358985600,,782,3.9808917197452227
4425905,4,B004LWZWGK,It could have said all it had to say in a much shorter format. It was pretty good though. Why do these directors think we need every scene to tell the story?,1358985600,,157,3.9375

4425913,5,B004LWZWGK,Best Batman movie ever... Well after the dark knight and that's only because of Heath ledger. I was hoping that since I bought it off Amazon I would also be able to stream it from my Amazon app.,1358985600,,194,4.131578947368421
4425914,5,B004LWZWGK,Bane is an awesome character with a very ... unique voice. It felt very much a Batman movie with everything going absolutely wrong and Batman coming from the very brink of everything falling apart to save the day. The intro of Robin was a bit weird but pretty nice regardless.,1358985600,,276,4.54
4425915,5,B004LWZWGK,"First off, I have to admit that I'm a big fan of this story line, and I've been one from the beginning.  It is a respectful conclusion to the Dark Knight trilogy, and wraps things up neatly, but it is less than satisfying for us old-school comic geeks.

If you have not seen this film, stop reading now because I'm about to reveal some spoilers.

You've been warned.

If you still want to read on, let's continue.

Bane's character is almost unrecognizable compared to his comic-book character, and it's hard to believe that Alfred would ever desert his charge under any circumstances, but it helps the story to highlight that doing the right thing is always important, even if no one is watching, and even if those whose opinions are important to you disapprove of what you are doing.

All (or at least most) of us old-school comic geeks also disapprove of Bruce Wayne's ""retirement"" of his alter-ego at the end, seemingly to never return.  Much the same as Alfred's abandonment of his duty, it's hard to believe that Bruce would ever abandon Gotham, especially since it's cost him everything, literally.  One would think that his celebrity and some diligent effort would reveal the fraud that stripped him of his fortune and restore it to him so he could continue to be the night watchman of Gotham.

I won't comment on the Robin thing, except to say that it shouldn't have been included in this film.

All in all, I consider this trilogy more of an ""alternate universe"" Batman story, and that the Bat we've known and loved all these years is still watching over Gotham and the entire world as part of the Justice League.

I will conclude by saying that the Christopher Nolan trilogy still beats any Batman movie or series ever made, and Christian Bale is a better Bat than Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, George Clooney and Adam West.",1358899200,2,1833,4.661490683229814
4425916,4,B004LWZWGK,I liked it but I think the price was too high. Maybe more of a two dollar rental than a five,1358899200,,92,3.4285714285714284

4425918,4,B004LWZWGK,"Could of slowed down a little so we could enjoyed something other than just the action. It had some of the best Actors around, who can speak and act.

4425919,4,B004LWZWGK,"It is an end to the trilogy, Bain is cool but it seems like the whole movie should have been spread out into two parts. I found if lacking but  enjoyable. it is still a fun movie and worth the 3.99 to rent but i wouldn't buy it until a box set comes out with all three movies together in some sort of special edition,",1358899200,,317,3.876923076923077
4425920,4,B004LWZWGK,"I'm a huge Batman fan, but I found this last installment in the Dark Knight trilogy to move very slowly. The backstory that it tried to include to ""neatly tie up"" the three movies - in my opinion - failed to do so and only added to a movie already too long.",1358899200,,257,3.9615384615384617

4425923,4,B004LWZWGK,"Christian Bale plays it the way it should be played.  He has enough of the tortured soul juuuust below the surface to make up for some of the things he's meant to do. And, bottom line, you root for him...and for Gary Oldman!",1358899200,,224,4.209302325581396
4425924,2,B004LWZWGK,I wouldnt recommend renting this. It has about 1 hour of extra dialogue and is pretty uneventful in my opinion. You should wait for it to come out on cable and sleep through it then.,1358899200,,182,4.228571428571429

4425926,1,B004LWZWGK,"The best part of the movie was the last 5 minutes, however, I don't think that was interesting enough to redeem the rest of it. The production quality was awful. It was hard to hear the low-talking dialogue over the background music. The villian was uninteresting and boring. Overall, just very dull script writing. The movie was very long and so much of it could have been cut out to make it shorter and therefore, less painful to sit through.",1358899200,12,444,4.5625

4425930,5,B004LWZWGK,"While I still think the second movie is the best, this is a nice ending to the best batman movie series so far (in my opinion).  Christopher Nolan did a wonderful job of re-introducing this classic character and world).",1358812800,,219,4.615384615384615
4425931,3,B004LWZWGK,"This overly long film was a test to see how long we could keep watching.  The story line was pretty much incomprehensible, dark, gloomy, and made the experience feel like a chore.  We stuck it out and then wished we hadn't spent the $4.99 to rent it.  I had heard some good things about it, which made it all the more frustrating.  Give me the first ""Batman"" series any day.",1358812800,,374,4.3

Do it. NOW.",1358812800,,378,4.25

Good graphics and nice story but there was an awful lot that I missed because the action was too fast or the screen was too dark.,1358726400,,252,3.9411764705882355
4425946,5,B004LWZWGK,Best batman movie I've seen yet. I liked how the plot had a few surprises and the villain wasn't a straight-up weirdo or strange creature. Very well casted. 2 enthusiastic thumbs up.,1358726400,,182,4.71875
4425947,5,B004LWZWGK,"Though it was not as good as the first two, especially ""The Dark Knight,"" it was still an excellent movie. Think of it as Return of the Jedi in the first Star Wars Trilogy or The Godfather Part III of the Godfather Trilogy (both I recommend greatly); both films were very good, but because of the bar set by the first two films of the trilogy, it made it tough for the concluding film to exceed that set standard. That does not take away anything from the film or say anything bad about; it is that this film did not exceed the first two films. This film is for Batman fans or superhero movie fans. It is an excellent film. Personally, I wish this one was not the end of the Christopher Nolan Batman films!",1358726400,,706,4.237037037037037

It was unrelentingly tense for the entire movie, and I came away from it more exhausted than entertained.

""The Dark Knight Rises"" did not make the same mistake. While much of the movie is tense, and often depressing, the mistakes of the previous effort were avoided. There were plenty of tension breaks and brief moments of humor in this film, even during the most critical dramatic scenes. That saved it from being a beat down of the viewer, and allowed me to enjoy the movie without the exhaustion I felt from its predecessor.

This story is epic in scope, and puts the Batman through some paces he's never faced on film before. It certainly reminds me of some of the Limited Series in the comics where he faces failure, both in action and in mind. There is depth here to go with as much action as any action junkie could desire.

The Blu Ray is outstanding. Both images and sound are top quality. I don't have a quibble with any part of the presentation.

!Spoilers are ahead !

Batman gets with Catwoman.....after how hard she sold him out? SHE NEARLY HAD HIM KILLED BEFORE BEING IMPRISONED.

Batman has enough time to paint a gigantic flaming bat on a bridge while people are literally being executed on the hour? Way to go, bats !

The Rocky style training in the prison was a joke, culminating in Wayne smashing the TV Bane had put in there for him. Watching this scene was painfully embarassing.

Only a teenage girl (and Bruce Wayne ) have been able to make the prison jump to freedom? Wow, not saying alot for all those hardened criminals. What a joke.

Lets send 90 pct of the police force into the sewers !!! Really?

What the hell was the point of the airplane scene at the beginning? To show Bane could double as agent 007? They could have cut the scene out of the film and it wouldnt have been missed (like the rest of the boring first 35 or so minutes of the movie)

I could go on, and theres much more, but suffice to say , the movie was an epic letdown that somehow managed to make over a billion dollars just by riding the coattails of the ""Dark Knight"" film. I have no desire to sit through this movie again, and its a real shame.",1358467200,,1226,4.254310344827586

4426017,5,B004LWZWGK,This is an amazing movie from start to finish a true classic. Christopher Nolan captures perfectly Batman's rise from defeat to save Gotham one last time before hanging up the cape and passing it on,1358467200,,198,4.685714285714286
4426018,5,B004LWZWGK,"The simple question brings a complex answer here.
The question with ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is obvious--is it as good as ""The Dark Knight""??!?
The answer is ""No""--but that is an answer that has to be considered in context.  ""The Dark Knight"" is arguably The Best Superhero Movie Ever; clearly is at or near the top of anyone's list in the genre.  It also is one of the best movies made in the first decade of the 21st century.
But when considered with movie series that have gone into two to three sequels, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a high-quality effort; very much a worthy third act in Christopher and Jonathan Nolan's story of Bruce Wayne.  Take into account some of the recent ""third chapters"" we've seen--X-Men 3, Spider-Man 3, The Bourne Ultimatium; Superman 3 from the '80s, Rush Hour 3, Batman Forever from the Burton/Shoemaker set...TDKR sets itself above these movies because it follows the continuity of the first two movies--the path that the Nolans followed, their vision of Bruce and Gotham--and gave it a full and completed story.
Chris and Jonathan have been very good in combining parts and pieces of the great Batman stories of the last 25 years in this series.  Obviously, much of their vision of Wayne has been based on Frank Miller's ""The Dark Knight Returns"" throughout the trilogy; and there were strong elements of ""The Killing Joke"" in TDK as well as harbingers of the ""No Man's Land"" series from 1999.  TDKR--obviously--draws from both ""Knightfall"" and allows a reimaging of ""No Man's Land"" to come to fruition.  It wouldn't be a stretch to say that the Nolans REALLY liked the ""No Man's Land"" scenario.
But just as obviously, Chris and Jon also took great care with their imaging of The League of Shadows--in their real-world vision of The Bat, The League seems the perfect and best antagonist to this vision.  Tom Hardy's Bane, in turn, fits brilliantly.  Hardy captures much of what the character was when he was introduced--highly intelligent, uncompromisingly vicious.  Again, much credit goes to the Nolans, who have a capacity for getting actors who will physically mold themselves.  Christian Bale worked himself into good shape for all these movies.  Hardy becomes a powerful, intimidating presence as Bane; though his mask (The positive for the Blu-Ray/DVD set is that Hardy's lines--at times, unintelligible in the theater--were cleaned up for the disc release...) serves a different purpose than in the original story.  It's a great performance from Hardy, who has to do so much of it just with his eyes.
This movie allows for the actors that Chris and Jon rely on for good performances to step up--Joseph Gordon-Levitt's John Blake, the young Gotham police officer who knows who Bruce Wayne is/was and brings him back into the game; Marion Cotillard's Miranda Tate (""I'm sorry, but what was her name again...??!?""), and again, Hardy.
Bale's final turn as Bruce Wayne...is morose at first, with Bruce having become Howard Hughes in the aftermath of the Joker and Harvey Dent.  As I've said over the years, Chris and Jonathan see Bruce Wayne more as a person with multiple personas more than a person with a secret identity; and what Christian captures early is how not letting the Batman out has affected him.  Christian has been solid in his interpretation thoughout the trilogy.  What brings Bale's Wayne back to ""The Game"" are Gordon-Levitt's Blake--explaining what he knows about Bruce, how he knows, and the sudden direness of the situation; AND...
  Anne Hathaway's Selina Kyle.
  I cannot emphasize enough that Hathaway just kills it.  She brilliantly captures the modern-day Selina; sharp-tongued, skilled high-end jewel thief, top-end martial artist, protector of her neighborhood...and just drop-dead gorgeous, especially in her catsuit.  Kudos to the Nolans for the cat-eared goggles for Selina.  In interviews after the completion and release of the movie, Hathaway has wistfully talked about Selina, quietly imploring the Nolans to revisit her at some point.  Here's an open hope that the Nolans DO find a path back to her.
  Michael Caine's Alfred seems full of regrets here, and does not get as much screen time as in the first two.  Morgan Freeman's Lucius Fox is still the sly and intelligent inventor.  Gary Oldman has had a wonderful grip on Jim Gordon throughout.
  Again--""The Dark Knight Rises"" is not on the level of its magnificent predecessor.  But it is a very, very good film; and a great completion to The Nolan Dark Knight Trilogy.
  Plus, it does leave some crumbs out there to lead to a new storyline.  So, bravo to Christopher and Jonathan; Christian, Michael, Gary, Morgan, Liam Neeson, Anne, JG-L, Tom, Marion...well done.

4426019,5,B004LWZWGK,"Best of the Batman movie with action.  However, can't beat the one with the Joker.

4426020,5,B004LWZWGK,"The 2nd film in this series, The Dark Knight, is still my favorite of the 3...but that being said, I felt The Dark Knight Rises was still amazing and a fantastic ending to this series, (or at least, we're lead to believe this is the last movie in the series, but there skepticism over whether or not by popular demand that more will be made later on down the road...only time will tell).

The casting was great, something frequently seen in Christopher Nolan films...I'd be hard pressed to think of a better cast for this film.  Christopher Nolan is great as Batman in my opinion, as is Tom Hardy as Bane...I thought he did exceptional.  Joseph Gordon Levitt is always cool too, and Gary Oldman, also, is a fantastic Jim Gordon...he is without a doubt one of my favorite actors!

As far as the plot line and everything, I won't go into too much detail about it, but I thought it was really well done and succeeded in being a great ""possible"" ending for this series of movies.  Again, there is speculation out there about whether or not there will be more movies, what with Joseph Gordon Levitt's character hinted at becoming Robin and the whole idea behind a possible move towards a Justice League movie and whatnot.  Who's to say?  Time will tell.

The action scenes in the movie were very well done and just super epic!  There is a fun twist at the end of the movie too, when a particular character comes into light, and those who are familiar with the character whether from comics or playing the Arkham games, you'll be like ""Oh whoa...that person!""  I had an idea toward the end about it but wasn't absolutely sure until it happened.

In any case, if any of you have not seen this movie, you need to!  This whole franchise of Batman movies is epic!  Go and give them a watch!",1358380800,,1780,4.45679012345679

Although the effects were stunning, they were never gratuitous nor distracting. The plot was as you would expect for a hero/villain film but there were a few surprises.

I would recommend this film to just about anyone over 10. The violence was superficial and probably much less than most video games.

The lighting was terrible through the entire movie. Everything was too dark... always in shadows. And most importantly, if you're making a movie about Batman, shouldn't 'The Batman' appear in costume more often? The injured Bruce Wayne had a lot of face time as he hobbled through the scenes, but only appeared as Batman a few times and got his butt kicked more often than not. I expected a lot of action as there is in all the other super hero movies of late, but this installment of Dark Knight was poorly written and poorly directed.

4426040,3,B004LWZWGK,"Don't get me wrong, by no means this is a bad movie, actually it's a 5 star movie compared to so much garbage being released on theaters nowadays, thing is... we are talking about the director of Memento, the master behind Inception, the genius behind The Dark Knight... and by those standards, this is a very weak movie for a Nolan directed Batman flick I was very dissapointed.... the ""epic"" conclusion wasn't epic at all for me, even a little clich drama would've been better to get that ""epic"" finale feel. For a director that really knows how to have a cohesive and interesting plot regarding many characters, I felt there was so much that wasn't needed, Catwoman for instance, but anyway, I'll leave the final judgement to yourself.

The Bluray Itself:
- Excellent Video/Audio quality
- Great Extras, 58 minutes documentary on the batmobile in all it's 5 versions. this whole feature is worth getting this set for.
- Another extra is a making of the movie, including a retrospective on ending the saga, this is actually the reason why I got this disc, to see Nolan's explanation or motivation for finishing the trilogy the way he did, I didn't find my answers here, but makes understand better why this movie is the way it is and not the way I expected.",1358208000,,1259,4.645739910313901

So, imagine my dismay when I discovered that the DVD that comes in this combo pack only had one extra on it:  A ""history of Bruce Wayne"" short that consists of people like Christopher Nolan talking about the character while a slide show of images from the films plays on screen.  That's it.

I am giving this product a negative review for a variation on the concept of ""false advertising"".  Why sell a combo pack in which the DVD contains much less material than the Blu-ray.... and not label the product as being so constructed?

Amazon's product description should have pointed this out up front.

There maybe be a review or two that mention this discrepancy, but I should not have to look through reviews to learn what's on the DVD vs what's on the Blu-ray in the same combo pack product.

4426061,4,B004LWZWGK,"To start off, you're not going to get a Dark Knight with this movie. Which is a good thing. We've already seen Dark Knight, and it is spectacular.

What you get, really, is an epilogue.

This is the Godfather 3 of the batman movies.

Batman Begins deals with the formation of the hero, just like Godfather 1 does. You see him struggle, his growing pains, him rising to meet challenges.

Dark Knight shows Batman at the height of his powers. When he single-handedly disrupts the drug deal, that's in many ways like Michael Corleone demonstrating his power by saying, ""my offer is this: nothing, not even the fee for the license.""

Now, when you are in the prime of life, things move fast. You make decisions, often out of arrogance, often without full information. In the 2nd of the series, the decision that Batman makes is to create a lie of a heroic Dent so that the criminals would stay behind bars. The decision that Michael makes is to kill Fredo.

So now we arrive at the 3rd movie. Here we see them grappling with their decisions. Michael Corleone is wracked with guilt from killing his brother. He is saddened by the loss of his relationship with Kay. Batman is crippled due to the injuries sustained in Dark Knight. He mourns Rachel. He and Gordon are finding it harder and harder to sustain the lie of the heroic Dent.

But the world doesn't stay still. New, younger and talented players enter the scene. Catwoman and Andy Garcia's character.

Like Godfather 3, there's something missing from Dark Knight Rises. It doesn't have anywhere near the intensity of Dark Knight. The storyline meanders. The dialogue is missing a lot of its poetic elegance. There are a lot of ideas stuffed into here, and it's a bit much to digest. The actors too seem to have this smirking, ""look, I'm in a Batman movie"" attitude to them. Everything seems just a little bit slower in here.

My biggest annoyance with the film actually is the new ""batwing.""

The Tumbler is part of what made the first two films so effective. The Tumbler is a real car that can travel at 110 MPH. So in everything the Tumbler does, it's like an embodiment of the inspiration behind Nolan's take on Batman. It is where the rubber meets the road. It's all improbably, but not impossible. When you watch the Tumbler roar around, it's thrilling because it's real.

The Batwing is impossible. It is clearly CGI. It cannot fly in real life. The aerodynamic shape of the thing, and the size of the thrusting fan, make this thing impossible to fly. you could say that the CGI Batwing is an embodiment of the Dark Knight Rises. It is a loss of creative discipline, as you see Nolan breaking many of his self-imposed rules, such as no Robin. At the same time, the Batwing...does have more capabilities than the Tumbler. It can literally soar higher. And so Dark Knight Rises is the grandest of the 3 films.

The first two films are in my opinion better films. But this one has a soul of its own and is worth appreciating.",1358121600,,2980,4.559925093632959

4426085,5,B004LWZWGK,"Although the title of this review may sound like a contradiction it is the best description I can muster for such an amazing motion picture.

It isn't perfect. But while most people will focus on the flaws I think it is worth focusing on the successes...particularly because they are so brave. The story is as rich and complicated as The Dark Knight. The cinematography is breathtaking, but not in a showy way. It is so stripped down, so grounded, so realistic in its bleakness. The score is beyond masterful; my GOD is the music amazing. And the entire cast delivers fantastic performances.

Whatever people have said about Bane is wrong; the voice is AMAZING. He reminds me of a British butler, so prim and proper with his approach to English. And that makes him far more intimidating. Yes, the voice is completely incongruous with his body builder/Mexican wrestler physique...and that's the point. Christian Bale has more to work with in this film and he delivers a fine performance. The supporting cast, from Michael Caine to Morgan Freeman, all bring their A-game to this motion picture (with one exception which will be mentioned later.)

The visual effects are typical of this trilogy; they disappear into the background and everything is designed to be as honest and grounded as possible. Christopher Nolan's sensibilities are spot-on in this aspect of his film; by underplaying the spectacle it becomes even more spectacular. Complicated robots and alien planets are so easy to do with CGI and an army of visual effects artists that they remove one from the story. Here, everything feels honest and real. And that makes it that much more stunning.

There are some flaws. (SPOILER ALERT!!!!) And it almost feels wrong to mention them. Marion Cotillard's death scene is simply awful. It has been much maligned on the internet...deservedly so. There are unnecessary plot twists. There are unnecessary confusing moments. It is unnecessary for the film to begin years after the previous movie. And Christopher Nolan's obsession with almost-trick endings needs to come to an end. That being said...

...who cares? The film aspires to such grand heights and achieves so very much that it isn't worth calculating the flaws. In fact, I've chosen to deliberately ignore them. This is a film worth enjoying. It is smart. It is profound. It is magical. And yes, it is masterful.

Watch this movie immediately. Turn off your cell phone, silence your home computer, dim the lights and draw the shades. This isn't simply what every superhero aspires to be...this is grand cinema regardless of genre. This is why we love the movies.",1358035200,2,2625,4.981735159817352

I love the dark knight concept of batman, its guttier and darker (dark knight, i know).  To me this movie was well done, well put together, Bane is a great character and the movie clicks right along keeping you engaged.  I also enjoy how they don't incorporate a lot of profanity into the movies, to many movies these days are loaded with profanity, I don't mind it, but sometimes it can be overwhelming.

Action packed from start to finish, but yet maintains the main story.  I am saddened that they are ending the series, but excited for the possible catwoman series with the gorgeous Anne Hathaway.

More terrible character voices i.e. bane.  Ann hathaway has no sex appeal which is a must for cat woman.  Why so do people like this film?  I guess a lot of people are happy enough with big hollywood names and big hollywood budgets. Wish Bane just killed batman and destroyed gotham to put an end to the franchise.

4426111,3,B004LWZWGK,"DVD Details
Disc 1 : The Movie (with Language options) WARNING, does not include the lone Bruce Wayne featurette that's on the single disc edition. No, it doesn't state on the box that it does, I'd just assumed this set would have everything the single dvd has.

Disc 2 : Batmobile Featurette (really cool) and Ending the Knight Featurette (not watched yet). Box says ""and more"" which I thought would be the Bruce Wayne featurette. There is no ""and more"". Well, at least we get two (and maybe the best) featurettes from the blu-ray, and don't have to convert from our standard definition format. Of course they could've add more for the price of this 2-Disc (which is more like a bonus disc), but It's still great to have a 2-Disc edition of this movie available for others like me who don't own (or want) blu-ray players, but still want the special features which I feel should be available in standard format anyway.

Update: The Blockbuster rental copy of The Dark Knight Rises does NOT have the Bruce Wayne Featurette that's included on the retail version. So It's just like the one manufactured by money grubbing Warner Bros. for the 2-Disc edition except it has a gray color insteady of the black found on the 2-disc, and Trilogy sets. Note: The Dark Knight Rises included in the standard definition Trilogy set DOES have the Bruce Wayne Featurette, but none of the other films have any. The box says it includes bonus content from all three films, which is actually just a booklet and one featurette, a detail that could've helped alot of their customers who were looking for the movie or set best for them. While it clearly appears that Warner Bros. doesn't care about their customers, I'd like to think of the inclusion of the Bruce Wayne featurette on the standard edition single disc is baby step in the right direction.",1357948800,,1831,4.683229813664596
4426112,3,B004LWZWGK,"Catwoman steals the show.  Understand that firstly.  Without her this movie would have been pretty boring.  This tale is more cerebral.  Batman is coming to terms with his place, with himself, with his city.  It is an entertaining movie, but it is far from epic.  There should have been many more battles between Batman and the bad guys.  The Sandman is in this film, but he does nothing.  I felt like this was more of a drama than a superhero tale.  The acting is great.  The worst actor is actually Christian Bale, unfortunately, with his stupid sore throat Batman.  Give him a lozenge.  I want to see Batman kicking butt.  This film had too little of that.  As I said, Batman was a dud in this film.  Bane and Catwoman and Levitt's cop character were more promising and interesting personalities.

The performances of the lead characters in particular Anne Hatthaway and Marion Cotillard as well as Caine and Bale as really superb.  Oldman truly embodies the Gordon role and for those who are fans of the Batman comics this is a really good movie.

4426123,5,B004LWZWGK,"I thoroughly enjoyed all three of Nolan's Batman movies, though ""Batman Begins"" was my favorite- I simply enjoyed the concept of Bruce Wayne's training in a fortress of disciplined ninjas, as well as the unconventional, relatively unknown villains of Ras al Ghoul and Scarecrow. However, ""The Dark Knight"" was awesome (just not my favorite), and this third film does a fine job of completing Nolan's venture into Batman's world.

I was actually putting off watching this movie, because I didn't want to commit three hours. But once I finally began it, I was sucked in, just as I have been with all of Nolan's movies. He sure knows how to open... the initial scene is quite breathtaking, and I have been continually impressed with how this series has introduced inventive, complex stunts that have never been seen before. Also, it must be mentioned- watching this on a big screen makes a huge difference!

While I was initially skeptical of the length of this movie, the pacing is done so well that I didn't notice the exorbitant length of time that it ran for. For the most part, the acting is top notch (though Batman's combat seemed a little too telegraphed and slow this time around- perhaps because he's been out of the game for so long). The story was well told, and parts of it strongly reminded me of Nolan's presentation in ""Memento"" and ""The Prestige"", which was pretty cool. He has a unique take on cinematography that nobody else has been able to duplicate, and his movies are a pleasure to watch- ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is no exception.",1357948800,,1549,4.733333333333333

4426135,4,B004LWZWGK,"Unusual twist to the final chapter of Christopher Nolan's trilogy. A departure from the standard superhero dynamic - capping a dark tale of revolution, revenge and redemption.

The story opens eight years after 'The Dark Knight'. After so much physical abuse, Bruce Wayne's body is completely shattered. No longer able to become the cape crusader, he's now a recluse who is never seen in public. And having accepted blame in the death of former district attorney Harvey Dent, his alter ego is branded a murderer and public menace, burying the truth about Two-Face to save the reputation and honor of a seemingly good man.

Life, such as it is, goes on.

Gotham without The Batman still trundles along; crime barely held in check by an increasingly overextended police force. Suddenly a new villain appears. However, unlike most of Batman's gallery of baddies - this one is more than just a linear plain vanilla thug or emotionally damaged lunatic. He's a man on a mission. The question is what mission? And most importantly, why does it require Bruce himself, not The Batman, to be humiliated and broken?

Echos of Ra's al Ghul.

Bearing the scars of imprisonment and deep social damage enters Bane. And his goal is nothing less than challenging the notion that a ""great"" city like Gotham is nothing more than a societal fac&aacute;de - that the true nature of humanity is one of selfishness and brutal opportunism; that nobility, charity and sacrifice are artificial self-serving constructs.

Bane and his supporters are going to reveal the fraudlent mask of civility by tearing it off its collective populace.

'Rises' spins off of a convoluted and overly lengthy tale, and despite some visually jarring edits and minor elements of melodrama which rang false, Nolan ultimately delivers a satisfying film. One that I suspect fulfills and defines the superhero genre for a modern, more cynical world. By crafting a tale which delves into the heart of heroism and the people whom are recipients of such, the potential to find the hero in oneself and in others becomes a powerful coda for Nolan and Bale's triumvirate of celluloid work.

No costumes, no training. Good people standing up to evil. As simple as that.

Finally, does anyone still curse the name Joel Schumacher? When I look back and see the immense accomplishment of the Nolan/Bale vision of The Dark Knight, I can't help but hope in a brighter future for all comic book sourced productions.

Personal Note:

I would be remiss not to express a minor disappointment that Nolan didn't choose to go with the canon approved Lucha Libre form of Bane.

Although I haven't read a comic book in nearly three decades, I've been a huge fan of DC Animated for many years. And that interpretation has been a favorite. I so desperately wanted to see the character as depicted in the incredibly enjoyable ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Knight-Time/dp/B001D0CEAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Knight Time</a>"" or ""Over The Edge"".

4426155,3,B004LWZWGK,"There's just very little about this film that would pass the suspended disbelief believability factor. A warlord capturing and holding New York City? Yes, yes I know, it's Gotham City but really, it's New York City and New York City is an American city and the United States government with the world's most sophisticated and powerful military at its command would have been able to put a stop to something like this in about three seconds. And Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle aka Catwoman kicking everyone's ass in high heels and not once sustaining a scratch or a bruise or even taking a punch herself? Please. Yeah she looks good in skin tight leather but, really? I mean sign her up for UFC cause, she'd rule and I might even become a fan.

Comic book fantasy yes but come on, make it just a little bit believable. All the special effects in play here can't overcome the Saturday morning cartoon plot in this one.",1357862400,,914,4.573170731707317

4426161,4,B004LWZWGK,"This seemed to be the year of the MIA main star in the sequels category.  The Batman movies, especially since the Dark Knight trilogy began, have been really excellent action flicks.  This last in the series, like the Bourne Legacy in the Bourne series, also turns up with the main hero largely MIA. In fact, the overall scope of this movie was at times kind of depressing what with our hero losing pretty much everything, including his home and even his faithful butler.  Bane, the main badass was just not as compelling as some of the others in my opinion; maybe it was the stupid mask.  Anyway, while ...Rises was certainly the weakest overall of the three, it is still a very respectable and thoroughly watchable and enjoyable flick in spite of it's flaws and disappointments.",1357776000,,780,4.713235294117647

4426176,4,B004LWZWGK,Amazon video on demand should provide closed captioning on the streaming video.  The sound level in this movie varied so much that we missed the dialogue in order not to be blown out of our seats by the high volume special effects.  Watched it again as a DVD from Netflix with the closed captioning and could understand the plot and sub plots.,1357776000,,343,4.516129032258065

4426188,4,B004LWZWGK,"I thought Christian Bale did a nice job dichotimizing the role between a recluse and the comeback crusader.  Anne Hathaway was a nice change of pace as Catwoman and did a great job with her role.  I have no idea who played the Bane character but I thought he was great.  All in all, a nice piece of entertainment.",1357689600,,313,4.271186440677966
4426189,4,B004LWZWGK,"Overall I found this collector's edition very well planned out except for the storage container for the discs. The container itself is nice and has a neat design, but there's no separation between the discs or any distinctive protection except for the outer shell. Basically you just pile/snap them in on eachother which is poor means for maintaining. Otherwise, the Bat cowl statue is the selling point obviously, It was well detailed and loved the cracks and separation points to make it look like it was trully broken by Bane!!",1357689600,,530,4.9
4426190,5,B004LWZWGK,"The Dark Knight Rises marks the conclusion to Christopher Nolan's ambitious and compelling Dark Knight Trilogy and it delivers the goods as a complex and troubling examinaton of conflicted heroes, corrupt legal and political systems and societal breakdown.  That it is able to accomplish this in the guise of an entertaining summer action flick is all the more remarkable.  Some have felt let down by this final installment and comparisons to its predecessor have been inevitable, but Rises is its own film.  It is as different from The Dark Knight as Knight was from Batman Begins.  Yet it ultimately ties in beautifully to the overall themes of the trilogy as a whole and is as much a part of the other films as it is a separate and uinque entity.

Eight years after the events of The Dark Knight, Gotham is enjoying an unprecedented era of low crime rates and prosperity.  The death of Harvey Dent galvanized politicians, lawmakers and citizens and paved the way for passage of The Dent Act which gave lawmakers added heft in the war on crime.  Yet Gotham's new found security is based on a lie that has nearly consumed the souls of the men who carry it.  Commissioner Gordon struggles with whether or not to finally reveal the truth to the people about who Dent really was.  Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne has secluded himself in Wayne Manor to nurse his physical and psychological wounds.

Wayne is drawn out of the shadows after an encounter with Selena Kyle, a jewel thief who is trying to swipe a pearl necklace from his safe.  Selena draws Wayne out into the open again and ultimately into the clutches of Bane, a beefy brawler who is building an army below the city streets.  Bane is determined to bring Gotham to its collective knees and Wayne is an integral part of his end game.  Bane has been compared to Heath Ledger's Joker from The Dark Knight, but that's a bit unfair.  Bane is no Joker, to be certain, but he's not supposed to be.  The Joker was an unhinged mad man who wanted to wreak as much havoc as possible while Bane has a more focused plan and is a bigger picture type of villian.

I won't go into too much detail about the events that unfold as Bane works to destroy Batman and his beloved city since that information is so vital to the overall viewing experience.  Just know that TDKR is full of breathtaking action, amazing set pieces, social and political commentary and most importantly, hope.  The hope that heores can come from anywhere and be anyone and the hope that no civilization is beyond saving, and no individual is beyond redemption.  And of course the hope that big budget Hollywood blockbusters can be more than just noisy distractions from our daily lives.",1357689600,,2693,4.643459915611814
4426191,5,B004LWZWGK,"I saw the movie on theater and was good, but see it at home on my own theater system is better. The sound is spectacular. The Ultraviolet thing is a pain in the ***, but that doesn't matter when you have BD and DVD package.",1357689600,,223,3.977777777777778
4426192,5,B004LWZWGK,"I haven't used my Ultraviolet copy, so I can't comment on that, but I don't get why people are giving the film itself a one-star rating.

If you've seen Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, and you haven't seen this, do it. It's the perfect ending to the trilogy, and I feel like everything just came together. Yeah, it's slower than The Dark Knight, but it's just building and building to the end, and I promise, it's worth it.
As a huge Batman fan, I wasn't disappointed with this(or the whole trilogy). Don't listen to people who say they don't like it because they ""couldn't understand Bane."" You'll miss a word or two the first time, but you'll wanna see it again, and the second time, his voice is really clear.

Definitely get it, but when you go to watch it, set aside some extra time because I was emotionally drained after every time I watched it.
If this doesn't win anything at the Academy Awards, I give up.",1357689600,,918,4.42603550295858
4426193,4,B004LWZWGK,A bit too violent but not as bad as some of the other movies out there.  I thought Ann Hathaway did a wonderful job as Catwoman and I didn't see Marion Cotillard as the villain coming.  The twist was fantastic.  I would recommend it for all Batman fans.,1357689600,,253,4.229166666666667

4426196,4,B004LWZWGK,Dark Knight is visually and musically powerful and enormously entertaining.  You won't be disappointed.  Taste may differ about the pace of the story and the coherency of the ending.

4426199,4,B004LWZWGK,"Movie sequels are rarely as good as the originals and this one is no exception.  This was such a great series with Bale playing Batman, that it's hard to fault them.  But this story was one of summing things up and ending the story so much so, it didn't quite have the same feel as the first two.  So, it's a very good movie... just not as good as one or two.",1357689600,,359,3.9583333333333335
4426200,5,B004LWZWGK,"I wish I had seen this on the big screen - Christian Bale is in top form for this movie and the conspicuous nature of the plot happening to coincide with the Occupy Wall Street is intriguing.  No wonder the Corporate Controlled Media did everything they could to shut OWS down and ignore and promote violent provocateurs, bribe the NYPD with $million ""donations"" from the Banksters .... the .001% should pay attention to this movie.

4426203,4,B004LWZWGK,"The trilogy comes to a close leaving fans with a desire to see the franchise rebooted with new energy and thrills. The story is somewhat flawed in that we are led to believe that a battered and broken Batman can return to a major league level of fighting and action despite substantial orthopedic injuries. The fight sequences with Bain are tiresome. I still like the Indy Jones solution to a threat -- just shoot him. Gadgets are fun, motorcycle is awesome and supporting cast is attractive and good for the story. Don't miss the opening sequence waiting for the popcorn to pop -- you must see this opening act!",1357689600,,612,4.623853211009174

I figure when you watch a BAtman movie you expect some fight scenes and cool gadgets but this movie lacked both. Batman wasn't even batman for most of the movie.

4426245,5,B004LWZWGK,"One of my most favorite comic book characters to be brought to the silver screen for all to enjoy is really a treat.  Starting with Christian Bale - plays a great Bruce Wayne.  During the series, it was a joy to see from director Christopher Nolan how dark Batman is.  The previous Batman movies were all, dare I say, ""Hollywood""?  I mean, George Clooney, Uma Thurman, Val Kilmer, Tommy Lee Jones, Arnold, Michael Keeton, Danny DeVito - all wonderful actors, to protray Batman or his villians was just over the top.  Batman is a very dark soul with having lost his parents so violently and then having to take on all villians to keep Gotham safe is very trying for him.  And then to lose his love interest?  Come on!  Though, I will say that Michael Caine as Alfred was a terrific addition.  So overall, this final movie by Nolan - The Dark Night Rises - was awesome!  It really showed how a superhero is so vulnerable and surprisingly fragile against Bane.",1357516800,,957,4.511627906976744

4426247,2,B004LWZWGK,"Batman begins was the best film in this trilogy.  Sorry Chris Nolan, this was your worst film so far.  The bad photo on the cover depicts the movie exactly. Poorly staged. Unimaginative. Dreary.

I hope the next person to take over the Batman character does a better job at depicting this hero.",1357516800,,294,4.615384615384615
4426248,5,B004LWZWGK,"The Nolan Batman films are easily superior to other comic book movies in terms of scripting, quality of acting, and sheer the craft of film-making. The cast has more Oscar nominees and winners than I can count. Nolan rescued the Bat franchise and has given Warner Brothers and DC a blueprint to follow when making future Batman movies- plausible plots, based in reality, a minimum of CGI, well conceived characters, and not insulting to the audience's intelligence. Batman can be evergreen like James Bond so long as the focus is on quality. Will Warner Brothers follow this? Signs don't look good as WB seems obsessed with shoving a Justice League movie down everyone's throat to copy the Avengers; does anyone really want to see Batman and Aquaman hang out? The Dark Knight Rises is an amazing end to an amazing trilogy. The Nolan trilogy may look even better in a few years when Warner Brothers is picking up the pieces of their aborted Justice League franchise. If you like Batman or action movies in general, pick this one up.",1357516800,,1031,4.76536312849162
4426249,2,B004LWZWGK,"I was so disappointed with this film that I felt I had to write a review. As a big fan of this Batman series, I greatly anticipated the release of Dark Knight Rises. This movie, however, did not measure up to the others. The plot line was not compelling, the pace was not exciting. The villain was pretty lame and Batman against the villain was pretty lame. The Anne Hathaway Christian Bale matchup was lackluster as there was no chemistry between the two actors. The movie was long and it felt it. Of course, you will watch this to see the conclusion of the trilogy, just don't go in with high expectations for an exciting and nail biting conclusion.",1357516800,,651,4.4789915966386555

4426256,4,B004LWZWGK,"To be honest, there were moments in this movie that I was rolling my eyes. I was not completely wowed by the way Catwoman was put into the story. Interesting? Yes. But something about he relationship Bruce made her seem more like she could have fulfilled the role of Bat-Girl as well.

All that aside, Bane is an impressive villian, not just for size and appearance, but his creepy voice and his smart tactics. He is someone you can come to appreciate and understand for a villian, even if you're still rooting for Batman the whole time.

The movie tied back into the 1st one more than anything, as if the 2nd movie had been skipped...but that is what helped it close out the series well. Batman finding himself back in another pit that he has to get out of - a somewhat ""duh"" idea but it worked well, artistically.

The scenery and mood for this movie are probably the most impressive and touching of all the movies - and Batman certainly is presented with a number of tough situations just in trying to get to Bane. And - hint - Batman still makes some mistakes that make the ending a bit of a shocker.

Weeks later I still want to watch this again, and again...sometimes just for the scenes with Bane!",1357516800,,1204,4.40990990990991

If you like action movies that are candy to your eyes and ears look no further. I also loved how the movie allows you to take full advantage of your big screen tv; just like previous batman the aspect ratio switches, in other words sometimes you have the black bars on top and bottom and other times you don't, best part you really don't notice it unless you are anal like me.",1357516800,,485,4.34065934065934

Oh, yeah...add in a diabolical plot to destroy Gotham City, some heavy-duty revenge by the League of Shadows (from 'Batman Begins') a brutal, brilliant enemy who is more than Batman's match...and, a complicated relationship with a 'Occupy Wall Street' minded cat-burglar.

Bellicose, bombastic and brutal, 'The Dark Knight Rises' is ultimately as uplifting as its title infers.
The scale of the film and its ambitions are both monumental, the script forces the viewer to engage their mind and full attention...and, the performances are cathartic.

Forget the nonsense about the film validating the rich above the rest of us...its about humanity's endless ability to screw itself up royally, push itself to the brink of annihilation, and then to find the will and grace to rise above its own failures and achieve something of value. That its wrapped up in the Batman's cape & cowl doesn't matter. This is myth-making in the finest tradition; and, as a single film, or the final chapter of a larger tale...remains one of the finest movies of the last several decades.

4426316,1,B004LWZWGK,"Is there anyone who LOVES this movie? Then skip this.

Dark Knight Rising is unleavened. Dull. I got up and just piddled in the kitchen off- and -on, Kanga, my meany momma cat, did a better fight scene with a phantom during the movie. She was atleast quick and light footed. Did they put lead in their shoes? They moved soooooooooo slow- lumbered.

ACTION movie. Batman and Catwoman. Catwoman atleast doesn't get beat up and put in a hole that happens to have cable tv- a pit of hardship and depravity. Batman is boring the whole show what he says is meaningless and what he does is good for rest- puts your right to sleep. When he was hung by a rope to fix his back they did feet shots- two. Who thought that was good two shots?

Don't let the music, director or actor ever attempt to tell a story. Oh, and the real villain who had sex with Batman/Bruce Wayne wanted to blow up the city. Two decoy trucks going on four blocks. Even me who can't find my way out of a paper bag could of located the atom bomb QUICKER.

Boring. I kept faithful and every upbeat of music I'd look up to see if there was some action. Sometimes there was, but it was poorly executed. And, finally, I have a speech impediment and I don't like to make fun of funny sounding folks, but BAIN was too lispy and too much air. I just made up words for him.

Save your money and if you MUST watch a bad movie get a better bad movie ABSOLUTE ZERO where no money is spent and its hilarious. Dark Knight wasn't even funny except when the villain woman died and sneezed as she died.",1357344000,15,1548,4.198653198653199

The villain was not as interesting as the Joker in the Dark Knight, and we rehashed an old plot by an old enemy.  The Cat Woman was done well and the character was interesting and entertaining. The setup at the end for another movie in the series will surely keep blogs humming until the next incarnation of the Batman on the big screen. There was excessive violence and killing with little need for it, the story could have been done with less.  3 stars because its always fun to see the Batman on the movie screen, but with the storyline being rehashed from past movies, it did not wow me.",1357344000,3,667,4.370967741935484

2.  Another fantastic villain
3.  Neatly ties up the three story arc

Even though the story is neatly tied up at the end, it does leave the possibility open for someone else to pick up the story.  The characters are excellent.  Catwoman is phenomenal.  Overall, a movie you will not regret purchasing.

The video quality is also outstanding especially in the IMAX scenes that fill up the entire screen.  It is not annoying at all, but would love to see the entire movie filmed with IMAX camera so it fills up my screen at home.",1357344000,,616,4.45945945945946
4426334,1,B004LWZWGK,"Love this movie. The entire series by Director Christopher Nolan is superb.  However, I have come to despise UltraViolet for the god-awful product they put out.  In a digital age, I only purchase blu-rays  offering ""free"" digital copies of the film (or I'll purchase DVDs to rip them).  Digital copies of movies used to come with an iTunes code to download a copy of the movie and you could do with that copy as you saw fit.  You could play it on your iPhone, on your mac, stream it to an AppleTV (or other non-Apple devices), etc.  You could do all of this without downloading any additional programs, or signing up for annoying mailing lists.

UltraViolet does not allow you to download the film without also downloading the Flixster & UltraViolet applications and signing up for accounts for their services and, of course, bombarding your inbox with emails about their offerings (unless, of course, you unsubscribe).  They completely restrict your ability to playback your copy.  You can only play it on your iPhone, but, again, only after downloading the Flixster app.  Once an UltraViolet copy of a movie is on your iPhone, they disable iPhone streaming to other devices, such as an AppleTV.  You can not stream the copy on your mac to any device, because the Flixster app won't allow it. IF you recently purchased a mac, and it has mirroring, you can watch the film in the Filxster app and mirror your entire screen on your AppleTV, but the quality is poor.  I read on some message boards that some users complained to UltraViolet about their inability to view their downloads on their devices, and UltraViolet would respond by giving them an iTunes download code for the film.  When I complained to UltraViolet customer service, I received no response.  Horrible product, horrible customer service.  Do NOT buy UltraViolet digital copies.",1357344000,2,1845,4.868589743589744

4426353,3,B004LWZWGK,"""The Dark Knight Rises"" is, mercifully, the third and final installment of Christopher Nolan's contribution to the Batman franchise. The potential of ""Batman Begins"" (2005) has degenerated into thematic and narrative incoherence, sheathed in overlong spectacle. Despairing over the loss of Rachel Dawes in ""The Dark Knight"" (2008), having assumed the blame for District Attorney Arthur Dent's crimes, Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) has spent the last 8 years as a semi-invalid recluse in his family's palatial home. He is spurred into action by his company's financial difficulties and a new menace in Gotham. Bane (Tom Hardy), a big bald villain who speaks through a voice-distorting mask, has shot Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman), raided the stock exchange, and seems to have a personal vendetta against Bruce Wayne and Batman.

This is just a bad screenplay by Christopher and Jonathan Nolan. The movie runs 2 hours and 45 minutes, inexcusably long for an action film, but I have to give Christopher Nolan credit for keeping me watching. He has stretched this thing out with so many useless, nonsensical plot points that it runs an hour longer than it should and makes no sense. To Nolan's credit, the visual incoherence of the action sequences that plagued ""The Dark Knight"" has improved. Unfortunately, this may have been at the cost of the action sequences themselves, as there are not as many as the audience will expect, and the numerous hand-to-hand combat scenes are lame. There are many instances of the actors punching air, people falling down without cause, and generally weak choreography.

Batman's voice gets deeper and raspier with every new movie. Bane's voice sounds like something pranksters might play at while drunk, and he's sometimes difficult to understand. He doesn't say anything important, so I wasn't bothered by this. But, you know, two superhumans making monster voices does not make for edge-of-your-seat suspense. Bane is a kind of Robespierre character. The film takes more than a little inspiration from the French Revolution. This could be interesting if Bane were more fully developed. He is scary in the inventive opening sequence but seems like decoration for the rest of the film. Anne Hathaway is the new Catwoman, a streetwise cat burglar named Selina Kyle. She is suited to the character but totally unconvincing in the fight scenes. Selina is a bad girl who wants to be a good girl if only she could get a clean record. That's her goal. Ugh.

Nolan has chosen to have Bruce Wayne crippled from Batman's many injuries. He can barely walk. Then, unbelievably, with no cartilage in his joints, he gets back in fighting shape, while in an African prison. This makes no sense. Why make him crippled in the first place? It serves no purpose except to elicit disbelief. Similarly, Bruce Wayne loses all of his money through fraud. Not only is that not credible, but it is completely unnecessary in the narrative. The whole movie is like this. It is overplotted and incoherent. Stuff just happens. Thematically, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" suffers from the same problems as its predecessor: It vacillates between advocating freedom or fascism, seemingly with the wind, whenever the screenwriters can't think of anything else to do. It has never occurred to Christopher Nolan to present some kind of coherent world view.

As a whole, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" does not work at all. Taken as a bunch of disjointed scenes, it has its moments and, remarkably, manages to entertain often enough to keep the audience on board for nearly 3 hours. Christopher Nolan gets the credit for that, but the Batman franchise could not withstand any more of his contributions.",1357257600,,3689,5.0625

4426367,5,B004LWZWGK,"First - I don't take ANY film too seriously.  I'm looking for entertainment, not a source for my world view. With that background in mind, I thought this was a great movie.  Action, interesting characters, neat ""toys"" - this film had it all.  I really enjoyed it.",1357257600,,263,4.553191489361702

The blasting of the sound effects did nothing for me but cause me to have to turn it off because it was unwatchable.,1357257600,,286,4.017543859649122
4426370,5,B004LWZWGK,Loved every bit of this movie. Great price on amazon at time I'd purchased.  Everyone in the household liked it down to our 4 year old daughter.  Great addition to the franchise and our DVD collection.,1357257600,,201,4.555555555555555

The only problem is the bad guy has a mask that muffles his speech to the point it is difficult to understand what he is saying (subtitles would be nice to turn on then).  I have seen it twice and still get into the movie (rare for me).  If you like Batman you will love this movie.,1357257600,,329,4.030769230769231

4426379,3,B004LWZWGK,I was a bit disappointed in this movie.  I actually shouldn't be reviewing it yet because the two times that I tried watching it I fell asleep before it ended.  It may have gotten better.  I will try again to watch it at some point and edit this if I change my mind,1357257600,,265,3.9622641509433962

4426384,5,B004LWZWGK,"Loved this movie.  Wasn't real pumped to see it either.  Loved ""Batman Begins"".  Not a huge fan of ""The Dark Knight"".  Never been more glad that I saw a movie in the theater.  There was an interview with Christopher Nolan a year before this movie opened.  He asked ""how many good third parts to a trilogy can you name?""  He went on to talk a little about ""Return of the Jedi"".  I think he studied the heck out of that movie and the Star Wars trilogy in general.  And he learned a good lesson.  I think he saw the trick with the structure.  ""Jedi"" is really nothing more than the plot of the first Star Wars (Episode 4) rehashed, only done on a much larger scale with better effects sequences.  ""Rises"" is identical in overall structure and basic plot as ""Begins"" -- right down to a mirror surprise ""reveal"" just before the climax.  But here's the trick: no way is ""Jedi"" as good a movie as ""Episode 4"".  ""Rises"" is not only every bit as good as ""Batman Begins"", but in many ways it's better.

Two things stood in the way of my loving the second installment: 1) as good as Heath Ledger was, that was not the Joker as I think of him -- sure he was menacing, but there wasn't a joking bone in that performance -- and funny can (and should in his case) be scary too; and 2) there's not one rousing sequence in the entire movie -- yeah, bring on the seriousness... but this is Batman -- shouldn't I have a little bit of fun watching it?

I found everything about Nolan's adaptation of Bane to be utterly frightening.  The effects are nearly flawless in sequences that are among the most rousing I've seen in a long while.  And on top of that, I had originally felt the title to be one of the weakest I'd heard in years.  It seemed like a cop-out.  Why not just call it ""Batman Rises"" to tie the trilogy together?  It seemed as though it was a lazy marketing ploy to cash-in on the tremendous success of ""The Dark Knight"".  Okay... so, I was wrong.  By the end, not only had Nolan made perfect sense of his title, but even improved my opinion of the previous installment.

The quality of the transfer is excellent, and this is one of those special blu-ray discs -- in that the sound is something special.  Listen to it loud and let Bane's voice rumble through your floorboards.  Oh, yeah... and the broken cowl that comes with this special edition is pretty cool too.",1357257600,,2361,4.3090909090909095
4426385,5,B004LWZWGK,"I pre-ordered my copy of The Dark Knight Rises due to my love of Batman, and I received it quickly and without fault.

I was really surprised, I thought maybe I'd be underwhelmed but it was worse. Bad story, no character development, the logic even within the world of superhero movies is pushed too far. I was just pissed. Anne Hathaway was very sexy, I think she's very pretty but rarely a sexy character. If you want to spend 2:45 minutes watching her dressed like the girl in the T-Mobile commercial and being a fox then you might like this.

4426399,3,B004LWZWGK,"And that was the only reason to watch it because various people told me that it was  not a good movie.  And yes, it was a mediocre movie.  Unnecessary long, with the plot doing a few deeps towards boredom, and reaching a conclusion that was really bad.
In general, it has the Batman quality, but there are James-Bond-like scenes that make it out of touch with the series. Also, there is too much soul searching etc at the expense of action. And let's not talk about the bravado / patriotic scenes.
I was disappointed and of course suffered from my wife's nagging at the end (""You make me watch boring movies instead of watching Ice Age 4"")!
But if you are a fun of the series you will find some good things, for example new toys, and all in all it is a an OK conclusion to the trilogy, and I guess the start

I like Christian Bale; Love Anne Hathaway; Love Gary Oldman; Love Michael Caine. Heck, I'm a HUGE Pittsburgh Steelers fan and actually bought the commemorative Hines Ward action figure before even seeing this movie  There's a lot to like about The Dark Knight Rises. But, it just didn't do it for me. I was disappointed in Bale's performance this time around. Anne Hathaway couldn't have been any sexier. I liked Joseph Gordon-Levitt.  But, this film just couldn't bring out the super hero fan in me. I thought the script was really bad. Tom Hardy's Bane was annoying. Half the time, we couldn't make out what he was saying. The action was lame. I don't know....for all the hype and how popular this film was, I'm very disappointed.",1357084800,,854,4.6490066225165565

As a more than fair-weather Batman fan, the plot twists were fairly predictable, but nicely done, none-the-less.  I'd have liked it better if Det. Blake had been, I don't know, Det. Grayson, or Todd, or Drake.  Throw a bone in for the fans, y'know?  I'd have given it that last star if they'd 'stuck' the ending, as well.

The story line seemed muddled, the acting uninspired and the outcome contrived. The action and dialog could have been condensed here to approximately 90 minutes; instead, the plot was dragged out to the point of being tiresome.  Also, is it really necessary for the tone to be primarily so deadly and dreary all the time?  Is this not based on comic book characters and a fictional city, etc.? Where's the camp?

4426436,1,B004LWZWGK,"I just finished watching 'The Dark Knight Rises' on Amazon Instant Video.

Or, as I will refer to it from here on out, TTHAFFMOMLIWB (The Two-Hours And Forty-Five Minutes Of My Life I Want Back).

I had really looked forward to the film, as the first two Christian Bale Batman movies were actually pretty good. But this one sucked horribly. It was campy and corny where it was clearly supposed to be cool and edgy. It was uproariously funny where it was obviously intended to be deadly serious. The story line was jerky and hokey. The acting was way overdone. The characters all spoke as if they had a huge 'chaw' of Red Man tobacco in their mouths, and they needed to spit. The special effects were far from special.

In summary, it was jaw-droppingly bad from start to finish.

The only thing that was even close to good was Ann Hathaway's character. But it was a nickel's worth of halfway decent in a hundred million dollars worth of truly horrible.

Please don't tell me there will ever be any more of these Batman flicks (I already know there's a 'Robin' in the works, but I'm lying to myself and I'm trying desperately to believe me). If I thought otherwise I would completely lose my faith in humanity.

After viewing this loser I went back and watched the re-booted 2012 'Spider-Man' movie, which I wasn't all that impressed with the first time through. 'The Dark Knight Rises' made it --in retrospect-- look like a very well made comic book movie effort.

Maybe the Iron Man and Avengers films have ruined me for all other comic book superhero movies. I don't know, and I don't care. Just please, please, please, never make me have to sit through that tripe-fest again! I have actually deleted it from my video library because I truly never intend to watch it again, no matter how much money I wasted. It was that bad.",1357084800,13,1827,4.551829268292683
4426437,3,B004LWZWGK,"I love Batman but haven't been a fan of the movies. I especially disliked Christopher Nolan's ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight."" But oddly, I liked this movie and it's mostly because of Anne Hathaway.

The Dark Knight Rises is dark and while it tries to be complex, it comes across as bombastic instead. Batman has stumbled and when the movie starts, he's a hermit. And the movie's central theme is about him coming back to himself. But the movie takes great leaps on his way back. As much as I want to love Batman, Nolan's character continues to make me feel ho hum about him.

The saving grace of the film is two things. One is Anne Hathaway. I'm usually indifferent to her in that I won't go out of my way to watch her films but won't avoid them either. For the first time, though, she became interesting. Her Catwoman is very dark and she hits the mark with her characterization, much to my surprise. She just might be the best Catwoman with a combination of flip, funny, and sexy. She's also has a hidden vulnerability that just peeks out on the film enough to let you know there's more to her.

The second saving grace of the film is the expected ending. It has a great twist to it that caught me completely off-guard that I loved.",1357084800,,1241,4.386956521739131
4426438,3,B004LWZWGK,"Honestly this movie was a let down. It's not a *bad* film simply by being a Christopher Nolan film, and a Batman film, but after the epic that was The Dark Knight, this movie pales in comparison.

Without spoiling anything, let me just touch on a few issues.

#1: Bane. This guy has no personality. Taken from the point of your average viewer, not a Batman-fan, I've never heard of this guy before. That's fine, as long as the character can grab me, but in this case, there really wasn't anything specific about him other than he was the 'big bad'.  Out of all the villains in all the Nolan-Batman films, he is definitely the worst, his only distinguishing feature being the dumb mask and the TERRIBLE voice-overs. Speaking of which...

#2: Bane's voice! Seriously, what happened here? The voice is totally on top of the rest of the audio in the mix of this movie, to the point of it being comical. It sounds so on-top of the rest of the audio to the extent that it sounds like a narrative voiceover. It's really jarring and pulls you from the movie. I can't see how it WASN'T done this way on purpose given the polish of the rest of the film (and the other two nolan-batman films, for that matter), but I don't for the life of me know why...

#3: Anne Hathaway's Catwoman: meh. Not bad, not great. Easy on the eyes. This is how I felt about the whole movie, really.

#4: The plot. Really, the plot was insane, but in a bad way. Whereas the 1st movie made sense in a superhero movie sort of way, and the second movie was really just a tour-de-force and had a lot of twists that you could get away with because the joker was SUPPOSED to be a sociopath, the ultimate motivations of the villains in this movie didn't make as much sense.  I don't want to spoil anything so I'll leave it at that.

Honestly I don't really feel like this movie needed to be made, other than that the 'Trilogy' seems to be the 'in' thing to do these days and WB wanted to cash in one more time. It's a shame, really, because it spoils the near artsyness of the first two films in a way. I kind of got the impression that Christopher nolan and Christian Bale were both phoning this one in, and although I've enjoyed the series overall, I'm glad it's done. DC has a lot of interesting properties, it's time to move on...",1357084800,,2294,4.306264501160093
4426439,4,B004LWZWGK,"*SPOILER* Why kill Bane like that? It didn't make much sense. How does a large motor cycle just sneak up on Bane? Also, how do those Bat Mobiles have so little fire power?

4426442,1,B004LWZWGK,"Only good thing in this movie is Tom Hardy's voice acting (yes voice acting, seems it was recorded in an entirely separate dimension from every other actor on screen.) Even then, it's nowhere near as memorable as Heath Ledger's joker. And I mean, nowhere near as close.

Other than Bane's voice, the movie is plagued by bad acting (or at best, forgettable.) The plot is full of holes, clichs, and extreme predictability.

From Batman taking 8 years off to do nothing with his life, to a rookie cop knowing he was batman just because he can read people's minds or some bull about ""fake smiles"" to the constant hammering about the stupid auto-pilot being broken that you just knoooooow will be secretly fixed... bargh...

I'm a noob to Blu-ray so I don't know if this is common or not.

The reason for the Title is: It's a nearly 3 hour movie, with 33 minutes of Batman in it (SPOILER. most of it is him getting his butt kicked.).  It does not directly follow the Dark Knight movie.  (at the ending of Dark Knight we are told that Batman must be chased because he is the hero we need right now.) This would lead us to believe the next movie would pick up with the police chasing Batman.  SPOILER ALERT!!!  It picks up 8 years later.)  It's filled with plot holes.)

Lastly, the dialogue is brilliant if....You have suntitles, which amazon Instant video does nopt yet provide.  You will only understand 2/3rds of wehat Bane says.

My one star rating is not about the movie, it is about the product, which is the DVD/BlueRay/UltraViolet combo pack.  On the packaging it says you can download this to your PC and devices.  that is a whopper of a lie.  You can not download a file to your computer and you can not transfer it to your devices.  What you can do is install the flixster app on your device and watch it through the flixster app.  You can stream it through the app or you can download it on the app so that you can watch it even if your device has no internet connection.  However, you still must open the flixster app, which crashes a lot and also the sound is really bad when I watch a movie through flixster, but not when I watch amazon or itunes purchased movies. Hmmmm.  Even if you purchase a movie on flixxster it costs more than on other sites and you aren't even getting a real digital copy.  I will never buy another Ultraviolet combo pack ever again.

It's a fantastic and sometimes over the top action movie.  It has some stronger roots to the Batman comic strip more than it has to the previous two movies.  It also symbolically talks about so many different things that occur in our society.  So criticize away.

4426500,5,B004LWZWGK,"I've seen this film three times in the movies and once on blu-ray and cannot understand the lukewarm reviews I have been reading.  From the moment I saw it, it became my favorite comic book movie of all time.  The cast is great and the action never lets up.  The final hour is almost non-stop suspense and action with that great music continuously driving it along.  Bale, Caine and Oldman are predictably great and Anne Hathaway looks fantastic and steals every scene as the best Catwoman ever.
I have to laugh whenever I read that this film is a great letdown after The Dark Knight.  I hate to say anything in bad taste but I believe that The Dark Knight only became a classic only as a result of Heath Ledger's OD.  There was so much about that film that I did not buy.  The bit with the two ferries was the worst.  Does anyone really believe that a ferry of criminals, enemies of society, would not have blown up the ferry of Gotham's working stiffs, given the chance, to save themselves?  Yet no one finds this implausible?  The action scene with Batman fighting the SWAT cops to prevent them from killing the doctors tied up with Joker masks was totally convoluted.  Did anyone find the conclusion with Batman on the run from the death of Harvey Dent satisfying?  (Yes, I know that that ending leads into the plot of the new film, but did you really find that ending satisfying when you first saw it?)  The Dark Knight Rises does leave one with a satisfying feeling upon leaving the theater.  As stated, it is my favorite of the Dark Knight Trilogy. (I prefer Batman Begins to the Dark Knight as well.)
There are so many other great things about this film.  The high shot of the hundreds of Gotham City cops running down Wall Street to confront Bane's thugs never fails to be breathtaking.  I love the fact that so little CGI was used in this scene: just hundreds of extras and stuntmen. I also love the scene of that little boy singing The Star Spangled Banner as Bane and his thugs infiltrate the football stadium to begin their destruction.  Simply brilliant. The Dark Knight Rises is a film with great thought behind it, a great action film and a great comic book film, a true masterpiece.  I've really grown to respect Producer/Director Christopher Nolan as a result of this film.
The extra features on the blu-ray are fine.  Theres also a documentary on the various Batmobiles that runs about an hour.",1356998400,3,2413,4.531177829099307

If you enjoy poorly constructed characters engaged in meaningless acts, then this 3-Hour turkey will delight you.

Others - stay away.

BATMAN: The Batman of the Dark Knight was something to behold - a hero so overwhelming that even vigilantes in that film were yearning to follow in his footsteps. This Batman hobbles around for nearly the entire film. He's slow, dim, unexciting in every way. Dull as Dishwater.

BANE: What a backstory - NOT. So his mother and he were thrown into some third world prison. Ok. So what does he do when he escapes ? Rescue his mom ? Take revenge on the goverment that incarcerated him ? No. He wants to kill everyone in New York City - err - Gotham. And kill himself in the process. Sure.

Now right off the bat I can think of at least two American hellholes, that if Bane targeted them, I might be cheering him on. But NYC ? Again ?

And how come no one ever targets Bane's lame mask ? Does it ever occur to Batman that if he tears it off, Bane dies ? Oh wait, Batman can't deliverately kill anyone. Sigh. Where's the Punisher when you need him !

CATWOMAN: Anne Hathaway is easy on the eyes, no doubt. But is she even CatWoman ? Julie Newmar had the claws, the curves, the purrs and the hisses. And sported a pair of perfectly formed - um - EARS. Yes, a beautiful pair that no man can take his eyes off of. Quite a gal.

Anne could have been great if the writers gave her a chance. But no. For starters her motivation is she wants to clear her criminal record ? Really. So she commits MORE crimes ! THe first rule of getting yourself out of a hole is QUIT DIGGING !

CONCLUSION: Does Bane even die ? The villian is supposed to go down after a ferocious battle. Instead we're supposed to believe a single gunshot did the trick ?

And the final scene - why did they even film it ? They could have just spliced in the final minutes from Angels and Demons.

4426532,2,B004LWZWGK,"I've tracked Batman for quite a few years - in comics, cartoons, serialized television and in movies.  It's fair to say that I'm a fan, And against that backdrop, I'd say that I find particular incarnation of Batman as something of a disappointment.

Batman is a different kind of superhero.  He's the caped crusader, whose abilities rest not in super powers but on cunning and intellect. Sure, he has some gadgets.  But he's not Superman.  He's a real human being whose biggest advantage is his brain.  In the same way that James Bond is supposed to be cool, Batman is supposed to be stealthy and smart.

Without Heath Ledger to add excitement to the script, I find Christian Bale kind of dull.  He tries to be mysterious and cool but can't quite pull it off.  For instance, there is that absurd guttural voice he uses, like some kind of scary Muppet.  And then there is the fact, if I'm honest, that Christian Bale just doesn't strike me as a particularly smart Batman.  You almost cringe watching him.

And it's not just Bale.  It's the way the whole movie is cast.  Bane is supposed to be the heavy in the movie but the character is confused.  They give him this British accent, to make him sophisticated, and he spouts off a lot of philosophic stuff.  But they've got him dressed like Master Blaster from Beyond Thunderdome with a face mask that looks like it came straight out of Silence of the Lambs.

My advice is to skip this one.  And based on Bale's performance, expect a new Batman.  Soon.

<Update>  Looks like my prediction has turned out to be correct.  Looks like they're going with a new Batman.",1356912000,4,1612,4.543554006968641

4426535,4,B004LWZWGK,"The Dark Knight Rises is an entertaining movie, although much different than the other Dark Knight movies.  This one is still an action movie, but there is also a ton of drama involved.  The movie was technically well done, but I wonder if some might be put off by the direction the story went in.  (Possible spoilers up ahead)  There is hardly any Batman in this.  He comes in quick little spurts, but then doesn't really show up until the last half hour, by then some may say `too little - too late'.  Batman and Bruce Wayne have never been played as great as Christian Bale plays him.  He has a charismatic presence on screen.  The filmmakers decided to make Bruce Wayne a recluse who has been hiding out in his mansion for a couple of years after taking the blame for Harvey Dent's death in the previous movie, even though he had nothing to do with it.  The public naturally ostracizes him as they typically do without knowing the facts.  It was unclear as to why Bruce Wayne is limping with a bad knee and body for half the film.  It was uncharacteristically like Bruce Wayne who has always been into taking care of himself.

Bruce Wayne and finally Batman do come out from hiding when a new villain more destructive than any other surfaces.  The villain in this movie is a character called ""Bane"" played by Tom Hardy.  The character is evil personified, but he is a big man with a muzzle over his mouth and nose, which is assumed that it helps him to breathe.  The villain is probably the least interesting villain in all Batman and Dark Knight movies, however a lot of uncomfortable deaths happen at his hand or  by the thugs that work for him who are happy to die without question.

There was a lot of talk and hype about Anne Hathaway playing Catwoman, but after the movie came out I never heard another thing about it.  I wondered why and after seeing this it was because she was barely in it and when she was on the screen, it was an understated performance.  She was more of a regular person who was also a jewel thief as opposed to the version that Michelle Pfeiffer mastered in Batman Returns as a deranged soul who comes back from the dead.  Pfeiffer's Catwoman is still and will always be iconic, but Anne Hathaway did a great job portraying a different type of Catwoman.  She also had visible emotion and sympathy over the things going on, when Pfeiffer's Catwoman never batted an eye lash, but this is of course due to the script.  They were merely giving their best performances with what they were given.

Despite the shocks and surprises of wondering why the filmmakers went down the road of being darker and more depressing, I still enjoyed watching this movie.  It ends in a way where it becomes known that Joseph Gordon-Levitt who plays a cop and good guy who helps Batman has a real name revealed: Robin.

 I liked the parts about taking back from the rich crooks and making the playing field even for a while again but truthfully, the movie never hit the mark for me as a story. Good affects and pretty good action though. Hand to hand fight scenes with all characters were terrible. Just terrible how bad cat woman's were as well as Batman's.

4426551,2,B004LWZWGK,"I must admit, I was not one of the fanboys that freaked over how amazing ""The Dark Knight"" was.  I loved Heath ledger and that version of The Joker is absolutely one of the most iconic performances of all time, but I thought the film could have EASILY been 20 minutes shorter.  ""TDKR"" was even more overblown and overwrought.  I tend to judge a comic book film by how good the villain is, and in this case, Bane sucked.  Comic book villains almost always have some murky ""plan"" that they want to exercise and their motivations are almost always very muddled.  So, apparently Bane gets together a group of terrorists to first cut off Gotham from the rest of the world so they can let all the criminals out, trap the cops underground, kill all rich people and ultimately nuke the place?  Umm okay.

The saving grace here is Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle/Catwoman and Joseph Gordon Levitt as good guy John Blake.  I found Batman whiny and annoying through most of this film, when he wasn't flat on his back shrieking in pain.

I am of the opinion that a hero needs to ""Rise"" and stalk hoity-toity directors like Christopher Nolan.  I call this dastardly foe THE EDITOR who will swoop in and slice extraneous plot developments and entire characters.  THIS FILM WAS TOO LONG.  Any impact it may have had was completely destroyed by the number of times I rolled my eyes and checked my watch.  Sometimes, shorter is better.

The way it all wrapped up in the end was kinda neat, with the important people being clued in to the truth and Gotham getting an immortal, infallible hero to worship and the whole John Blake / Robin thing.  But it was almost too little too late.",1356912000,13,1662,4.511705685618729

4426556,3,B004LWZWGK,"This edition of Mr. Nolan's Batman is just fine, story wise, but productions wise, it is a mess, especially in the audio department. I have excellent hearing and a phenomenal state of the art home system, but I shouldn't have to ride the remote volume to hear  Batman gasp his dialogue as if he had swallowed dust and sand. And whoever thought it was a good idea to have Bane speak through that ridiculous mouth plate, has no understanding of tonality. Mix that in with his accent and on goes the button for the hearing impaired. Also, if you are looking for parallel sympathies/ antipathies to ramp up the eventual collision between Batman and Bane, why not do a better job with Bane's back story? The slapdash references to him throughout the film don't create the kinds of tragic mix that should underscore this character. In fact, relative to Batman's own tortured past, what the hell is eating Bane, especially after Bane exiles him to a similar fate he had to endure? It boggles the mind.

4426559,2,B004LWZWGK,"**Caution there are some spoilers in this so read with care**

Really? This is what we are left with? A weak lame broken Batman who only has like 45-60min in the movie where we get to enjoy him kicking @ss like the Batman that we know and love. The movie, strictly as a movie, was good, but so many plots were unrealistic, and with the lack of Batman it really wasn't even a Batman movie. The plots dragged out and then of course the writers had a hard time pulling it all together. My other issue is that I like the good guys to win, as hopefully most of us do, so the fact Gotham and Batman got their @sses served to them on a tarnished platter just sucks. Plain out sucks. Terrorists like that just piss me off in general. So watching psychopathic terrorists who are so completely delusional, is just horrible. I don't want to watch that! Anne Hathaway played a nice Catwoman and I was happy to see the character of Catwoman come into the movies finally. Nice suit Anne ;) You kicked butt and had a great body, super kick@ss heels too. But I didn't like that they made her such a hardcore selfish biotch. Its hardly acceptable that she ""redeamed"" herself at the end by finally giving a care about someone other than herself. We are to believe that Bruce accepts her after what she did to him? And the illusion we get at the end where Alfred looks over and sees Bruce and Selena together? This movie was just so far out there compared to any other Batman media it drives me nuts. I'd rather watch the Campy 1950s Batman and Robin films than this last of the trilogy. I wish they had gone more into the character of Catwoman, she's one of my faves. I just don't like the hard edge they portrayed. Now regarding ""Robin"", I had a sense earlier in the movie that he was the Robin character but its hardly believable that just because he found Bruce's suit and gadgets that he is going to take over now that Bruce is ""retired"". I am happy that he survived the blast, I mean he has to! He's Batman! He can't die! But I don't understand why they had to let him stay dead. Why are people not allowed to know he survived? Is it because by now too many people know that Batman is Bruce Wayne? Are we to believe that after all he did, saving millions of lives, they would take him into custody and throw him in jail for being the vigilante they thought he was before? Come on people. Have some gratitude. Anyways, check out the movie, if you haven't and you just read this, sorry for the spoiilers but I warned you. I like to rewatch movies over and over again, but this is NOT a movie I will be watching again. It's too disappointing.",1356912000,2,2626,4.2730923694779115

4426579,2,B004LWZWGK,"What a mess.

This movie was painful to watch. It just seemed like they were trying so hard to make something unique.

Well, they succeeded in making a uniquely lame movie that was far weaker than the first two. I didn't care about any of the characters. Bane was a horrible villain who wasn't evil, but just gross. Compare him to Raoul in Skyfall. Now that's a great villain that people love to hate. Cat Woman was pointless, except for a bit of eye candy and Alfred should have just left at the beginning and stayed in Florence.  I love Michael Caine as an actor, but never bought into the cockney version of Alfred, but I'm not sure I've ever heard Caine speak any other way, except Cider House Rules.

Maybe they should start over and see if a third series might be the charm. The first series of movies were just as bad and muddled throughout. Michael Keaton? Val Kilmer? George Clooney? Why not Bruce Campbell? At least he doesn't have a
speech impediment like the rest - including Bale (who rarely closes his mouth in this film like he has a stuffed nose.)

I'd take Adam West and the TV series over any of the movies even though I did enjoy the first two Christian Bale movies despite the annoying Batman voice. At least the TV show knew it was camp and didn't drown everyone in the dark and twisted psychological goo that the Hollywood films were always pushing to match the later comics.

4426583,4,B004LWZWGK,"As far as trilogy enders go (Matrix, Lord of the Rings, Santa Clause) this is hands down awesome...but that's only because the bar has been set so low. I'd rate The Dark Knight Rises slightly ahead of Star Wars III, but it doesn't hold up to the standards of quality set in Batman Begins and The Dark Knight.

The pacing was forced, the story illogical, and a sense that this was Batman you were seeing, but that everything was trying to be wrapped up prematurely, like half the development team was doing their job and the other half just wanted to get it over with and get paid.

*Spoilers*

Bruce Wayne losing Wayne Corporation: between his wits and Lucius Fox that would never happen, nor would they build a fusion reactor without realizing beforehand that the technology could be converted into a bomb. That's an oversight neither man would make. Second, Bruce's personal fortune would not be tied up in a single location for someone to steal with a thumb print at the stock exchange. He would have bank accounts, etc that would be uneffected, so the idea of him being broke is ridiculous. Still, the way the movie is filmed it seems plausible if you don't think too hard and just go along for the ride, as most people seem to do with movies.

Catwoman: pleasant surprise to see Anne Hathaway fit the roll so well. Her acting saved a badly written part, for her betraying Batman to his death then falling in love with him makes no sense, nor does Batman's telling her she's making a serious mistake and then is all 'forgive and forget' later. He didn't even punch her once for that, even though he nearly died.

The Bat Plane: Fox says it's just another Wayne prototype...so where's it been the past 8 years? If it had been something Fox had been working on in the interim, fine, but he doesn't say that, so why didn't he give this to Bruce in Batman Begins? That said, the design and function is awesome. Good tech work, bad writing.

Bruce the Hermit: The knee leg injury was said to have been from the fall that killed Dent, but we see Batman running away afterwards...so no serious injury. He's had 8 years of 'retirement' to heal up, get reconstructive surgery, whatever. No excuse for him to be in anything but perfect health. As for being a recluse, he should be a fit recluse, otherwise all the lessons he learned in the first two movies are tossed aside. Batman was supposed to be on the run, every night patroling the city looking for bad guys and having to run from the police at the same time, not retire and live in the east wing of Wayne manor pining over Rachel.

Ras's daughter: Why wasn't she there when Bruce was trained? Was she already on the board of Wayne Enterprises? She and Bane pop out of thin air into the league of Shadows storyline.

Bane: Supposed to get stronger from the drugs, not use them as painkillers for an injury that we never get to see. He is clunky, slow, and strong. Batman's fighting knowledge should have him dancing around the man with hit and run attacks, not going at him fist to fist. Bane's victory was forced. As for his line about having grown up in the dark...he lived in a prison with a giant sunroof!

Gotham held hostage for 5 months: no point in this save to give Bruce time to heal and escape. If they planned on nuking the city they'd do it. If they planned on taking over and staging a revolution, they'd do it. Both didn't fit. Ras's manipulation was designed to destroy the city, not play with them. This was not a true league of shadows operation.

Alfred leaves: not true to character, nor his revealing the note he'd burnt. His absence seemed to be written in to get Bruce alone and poor. Having a Butler sticking around would be counter productive. Again, the storyline was forced here.

Bridge blown to stop bus: All the bridges were blown in the beginning...save one??? Supposedly to get supplies in, you assume, but then you see barricades and fencing put up to keep people from getting out. Again, written in just to have something to blow up at the end for dramatic purposes.

Robin discovers Batman: Apparently happens due to a look on Bruce Wayne's face, showing him the same pain at having lost his parents. But wait a second...Bruce Wayne lost his parents, so Bruce Wayne should look like that. Batman didn't lose his parents, as far as everyone knows, so where's the link between Bruce and Batman? Total bomb here. Makes zero sense.

Training Robin: a few conversations, a bad of goodies, nothing more.

Gordon's speach: Conveniently ends up in Bane's hands. He says 'search him' and the first thing the goons grab out of his pockets is a bunch of paper? They then find a gun...shouldn't they have got his gun when they knocked him out in the first place? Bad writing here, all to get the speach into Bane's hands.

Clean Slate: Very convenient technology. Daggot's little speach points that out well.

Fighting: Not enough effort put into this. Batman Begins level of choreography was not replicated. Bummer. You can see bad guys waiting around waiting their turn to get hit.

Police mob at end: So cliche it doesn't deserve to be in Batman. Walk up at tanks held by criminals? Seriously? Bad writing again.

Batman's armory: How did Bane find it? How did he know where to look for it? It was supposed to be a secret, so where was the security breach? Never explained.

Batman getting owned: Little things like Catwoman disappearing when his back is turned...Batman doesn't turn his back. He's the badass, and the writing waters down the character to trump up catwoman. This was much more a Bruce Wayne movie than a Batman movie, and they didn't do Bruce Wayne well either. His intelligence disappears at convenient times.

Bruce running away with Catwoman: nice ending after thinking he's dead, but totally out of character. Both them hooking up and him quitting being Batman. Gothan is a mess, Gordon needs help, and he leaves an untrained newbie to take care of everything and even a brand new bat signal on the roof? No, totally not right. Bruce Wayne leaving Gotham behind permanently and running off(supposedly broke)just doesn't fit. Batman/Bruce is not supposed to be happy. He is a tragic figure turned hero...not a lover/family man. Him being happy is not the objective, him keeping other people from avoiding the loss that plagues him is. That is Batman.

A lot of good things in this movie, but the writing was subpar and contradictory with the previous two films. In the end it's worth watching a few times, but in the grand scheme of things it doesn't live up to Batman Begins, at all.",1356825600,3,6581,4.598122866894198

4426608,3,B004LWZWGK,"I had high expectations for the conclusion to the Christopher Nolan trilogy of Batman stories.  Unfortunately, he fell flat.  I have no issue with writers and directors taking liberties with characters, but if the only similarity you are going to keep is the name, why bother?  It is like he forgot what his formula was.  I was very disappointed.",1356825600,2,346,4.813559322033898

4426611,3,B004LWZWGK,"I could see that a lot of effort went into the movie, but it just felt a little forced.  The premise, setting and pacing just didn't seem quite right.  It would have felt more familiar to have events occur in darkness, and I think I would have enjoyed a more capable (and paranoid) protagonist who used his spiffy gadgets instead of just straight brawling. It definitely had some pretty neat moments, but overall I think this may be my least favorite of the trilogy.",1356739200,,466,4.535714285714286

4426616,5,B004LWZWGK,Fantastic finish to the series. I think this was as good or better than the first two. The only complaint I'd have is length- the content in this movie could have easily been broken into two stand alone films.,1356739200,,209,4.384615384615385
4426617,4,B004LWZWGK,"Like Transformers: Dark of the Moon, there is enough vehicle action going on in and around the city that's treated like a racecourse where the traffic lights, buildings, parked cars are just obstacle-course challenges to see the anti-destructive behavior of The Batcopter and the Batcycle. I think it's better to leave your brains at home and not figure out too hard all the odd moments of the film such as Catwoman's 'kiss of life' to Batman before he takes off in the Bat in the distant sea and disappears in a mushroom cloud, without any trace of a tsunami wall-like wave effect that would seem to threaten the bridge-stranded bus along with the children's lives on the bridge. Wearing my wireless headphones for more than 2 hours can be relaxing as the movie soundtrack's drum, horn and violin music breaks the silence during conversation scenes and city action scenes.

Batman needs to get over the ""I'm a tough guy so I've got to talk like I have a bad cigar hangover to cover up the Christian Bale lisp"" - and what was it with Bain's voice?  All too distracting and not entertaining at all.  Seriously, kid climbs out of a pit and becomes World Terror #1 (or #2 - your interpretation)?  Morgan Freeman's and Michael Caine's parts were even reduced to gratuitous throwbacks.  Ugh!  No more, please.",1356739200,4,597,4.673076923076923

4426641,3,B004LWZWGK,"Uh, this movie was dark, thrilling, and over the top. I don't know how they did some of the special effects in many of the scenes, but everything looked totally real. the music was better in batman begins but the premise is the same. Bane was one scary dude and I am going to have nightmares about him. Didn't love cat woman because she is scrawny and couldn't beat up a pair of socks. Her hair was amazing though. My favorite part was the street fight and the end of the movie.

What made this movie great was the realism. We don't struggle with this kind of stuff everyday but tyranny exists in this world. This is the most realistic work of fiction I have ever watched in a movie. Usually its full of magic, creatures, and different worlds. In Batman its the technology that is most unbelievable. The rest only the city of Gotham can hold.

I have a Samsung HDMI top of the line tv and the move still looked like crap. The sound was distorted and way off I had to put the volume of my TV to almost a 100 just to hear it, the Amazon HD was a joke, and everything in the movie looked wired shaped.

4426684,3,B004LWZWGK,"After watching movies like the Dark Knight and Inception this movie is not at the same level.  i would say 75% of it is spot on with great story line and interesting charecters bulit well and of course a very real feel compared to other comic book films.  The movie is a must see for any movie fan, but 25% of the movie lacked in story board and felt very cliche.  Which is hard for me to say given the fact that Nolan is a genius and I am probably holding him to a higher standard that I would any director at this time.  I consider Nolan and Jackson a 1a 1b right now in film of this era for blockbusters.

that said, having a count down bomb, that is simply taken away and dumped feels very superman flying missiles into space.  It's kinda lame and very much a let down after seeing just about the best comic book movies of all time.  I get it simple sometimes works better than over complicating things it just was a bit of a Ah ha moment when i looked at my firend and said, a count down bomb really!  He flies it out to sea and saves gotham, yawn.

So if you think of it in the context of a comic it is spot on, but if you think of what Nolan is capable of it is a good movie.

Thats why i give it 3 plus stars and reccomend, but remember a Dark Night only come once every 25 years with a performance like Ledgers and this movie is no Dark Knight.",1356652800,2,1353,3.959409594095941

4426689,5,B004LWZWGK,"The following review started out as a gentle and respectful reply to another reviewer, so it may not seem as cohesive as other reviews, but I'm now posting it for two reasons: 1) I'm really tired of all the ""too long"" comments, because I see that response as an indication of the general loss of decent attention spans that now exists in the citizens of our troubled nation (USA, but maybe other nations too?), and 2) there seem to be a lot of shots taken at Chris Nolan-just for being Nolan, and since--IMHO--TDKR is the most ""Nolan-ese"" of the series, I suppose people who don't like Nolan will find more to dislike than those who like him.  And, it may also be true that points 1 and 2 above are connected.  On the other, I really like long films, and I really like Chris Nolan's film-making, so I'll admit that my bias in those two areas shows up clearly.  Oh well.

But, to the ""review"":  I'm not a Batman fanatic, from the comix side, but I do like Chris Nolan, esp Memento & Inception, and I guess this film ""felt"" more like a Chris Nolan film than the first two. I'll also concede that I am one of those crazy people who actually likes *really* long films! (Ben-Hur and Lawrence of Arabia are two of my favorites.) Having said that, I'll note that I thought TDKR was amazing, and--in some ways--the best of the three. I had not read many reviews of this one until I watched it, so the way the plot unfolded was mostly new to me, and I have to say that I genuinely liked the way Nolan paced that unfolding, especially as Bane was set-up as virtually unbeatable, perhaps even by Batman at his peak.

I've heard Bane described as ""jolly,"" or perhaps just too flippant, but I think his attitude is simply a supreme confidence to the point of arrogance, and his arrogance makes him dismiss Batman, and any other opponents, with a vile amusement that is probably flip and sarcastic, and tied very much to his angry and bitter ""soul."" Also, to note one example that comes up as negative, I have seen the ""climb"" out of the prison described as ""too long,"" or ""boring.""  Nonetheless, I really liked the technique of revisiting Wayne's attempts until he finally took the blind prisoner's advice and climbed ""as a child,"" without the rope. Now, I'll concede that after the first two attempts, I was already telling myself, ""he has to do it without the rope, like a kid,"" but I think Nolan wanted the audience to be a bit ahead of Wayne on that point, because he kept showing the footage of the kid climbing, and the absence of the rope was pretty obvious. To me, it shows that Batman/Wayne is still having difficulty getting his mind/spirit back to the point where he can battle Bane with any chance of success, and Nolan just lets us see that before the character does.

Some folks have criticized Nolan's portrayal of Batman/Wayne as borderline crippled over an 8-year period, but he is just human, after all, and it shouldn't be a shock that his emotional loss in The Dark Knight sparked a long period of withdrawing from everything. If you believe Batman is simply a man in great shape and with great martial arts training, and with a few other skills, then you will accept that all of that can be lost through neglect and carelessness and a sorrowful apathy.

OK, I'm in danger of rambling here, but I guess my point, for what it's worth, is that I have watched all three of the films in this particular Batman series.  I have really enjoyed all three, but I've been waiting for the true ""Nolan"" twists to show up. Batman Begins was extraordinarily tame in its ""Nolanisms,"" and then The Dark Knight seemed much more a Nolan product (esp in the Joker protrayal), and finally in The Dark Knight Rises, the ""true Nolan"" finally shows up, especially in those scenes where the action is so fast and shocking that it is almost bewildering, which is what you get in Inception (albeit for different narrative reasons). As for the ending, should Nolan have left Batman's fate more ambiguous, and would that have been more effective?  Possibly, but as it stands, Wayne's fate is something about which only the audience, Alfred, Lucius, and Selena truly know. From an emotional perspective, I just liked that touch(with no excuse).

There's other little stuff too, like the way Gordon is brought down and chastized for allowing the lie about Batman to continue. Gordon has been a true shining star up until this film, and he does his best to get his police force back on board, and he ultimately makes sure Batman's image is reversed, but there is a point, after Bane reads his speech, that Gordon is justifiably portrayed as pathetic and helpless. Again, a Chris Nolan technique that produced in me a profoundly sad feeling.

Yikes! This was a lot longer than I intended. I'm not trying to slam anyone else's review, or start a ""review war;""  I'm just pointing out the personal perspective from which I ""watched"" this one, and I'm hoping some of you on the border might give TDKR another shot.

4426690,4,B004LWZWGK,"The Dark Knight Rises is a great movie, and I don't want to pull down its star rating, so I'm giving it four stars. This review, though, isn't about the movie.

I got this movie for Christmas, and specifically asked my wife for the combo pack, not because I wanted the DVD, but because I wanted the digital copy. The digital copy included with The Dark Knight was an iTunes redemption code. Unfortunately, with The Dark Knight Rises, the digital copy is the new industry standard, UltraViolet. And I'm here to tell you that Ultraviolet is just awful.

It took three days just to redeem the code (servers were probably overwhelmed by the Christmas rush). They I had to sign in to two different services to access the digital copy. I downloaded the movie, hoping that would allow me to transfer it to iTunes so I could manage it with the rest of my movies, but no. I had to download the Flixter app, and would have to download the app for my iPhone as well to play it on there.

I was feeling pretty disgruntled after all that, but then I tried to play it using the Flixter app. And, even though the movie has been downloaded, the app just sat there and said ""Loading"" for five minutes until I finally gave up.

I guess I'll just take the DVD, fire up my trusty copy of Cocktail and rip it.

The movie industry had a solution that worked for its customers. They abandoned that in favor of a clunky mess that, from what I can see, doesn't even work. The Dark Knight Rises gets four stars. UltraViolet earns zero.

  was the movie good ? yes,of course.but did it live up to the hype ? no ! a lot of times hollywood gets people so worked up about a movie nothing less than the second coming won't do.thats what happened here.
  there were a lot of unexplained things too.i had more questions than answers by the end of the movie.another thing that always gets under my skin is when super hero movies don't follow the comic books.and,lets face it,they hardly ever do.this movie had a number of mistakes.and there were a few things that were hard to believe.i mean i realize this is a fantasy movie but still.some of the special effects weren't very special.banes voice sounded creepy and was kind of high for a steroid  monster.
  now onto the good stuff.there was some better than average action.the cat woman finaly got to kick some tail after being in 3 movies.lucius fox got to stay on.there were parts of the story that were epic in scope.the new bane was interesting as compared to the old one.the new cat woman was as well.
  lets compare.this is the 8th batman movie.i'd say its better than the one from the 60's as its not so silly.i did not like it better than the tim burton ""batman"" movie from 1989 with jack nicholson as the joker.it was comparable to ""batman returns"" but i think this new one edges it out due to better tech.but i like the michelle phieffer cat woman better.sexier and crazy.then there was ""batman forever"".i loved the riddler in this one but 2 face was mildly interesting and robin was a little punk.so ""rise"" beats that one out too.that was the tim burton trilogy.then there  was ""batman and robin"".it was really ,really silly.there were bad puns throughout and george clooney was not a very good batman.batgirl,while hot,was  crabby all the time.so ""rise' beats it too.then we get up to the current trilogy.the other 2,especialy ""dark knight"" beat this one,hands down.so ,out of 8,i like this movie 4th best.
  i definately recommend this movie to batman and super hero fans.and i would go see it if i were simply an action or sci fi guy also.heck,theres even a bit of drama and romance too.its an better than average  movie its just not the all time classic the media made it out to be.i would recommend it.",1356652800,,2589,4.762863534675615

4426701,3,B004LWZWGK,"Some people loved it.  Some despised it.  Most are probably, like me, somewhere in the middle.

There's no need for arguing about it.  It's just a movie.  I have loved comic books since I was a kid and love that movies are being made from them.  The thing about these movies - and especially complaints about reboots - is that new writers and artists take over characters in the comics all the time.  They change things...they make the costumes different...they alter the timelines and sometimes totally screw up the continuity.  The writers, directors, and actors are doing the same thing with comic book movies.

Now that we have that perspective, we can watch and enjoy TDKR for what it is: the end to a director's take on the Batman and his world.

Before I dive into TDKR I should say that I enjoyed both Batman Begins and The Dark Knight very much.  The dark, realistic feel of Christopher Nolan's take on Batman is closer, I think, to what Batman is in the comic books.  And I think that these movies are what DC fans have wanted/needed for their favorite character(s).  That being said, The Dark Knight Rises, to me, is more of a letdown than anything and I think some people get angry at hearing anyone criticize it in any way just because they are so attached to the character.

Long and drawn out is not equal to ""epic"" in my book.  But I couldn't help feeling flashbacks of Star Wars: Episode 1 (the big fish scene, among others) as I watched this movie in the theater.  Okay...fine...he climbs the wall to escape and it's symbolic and a very good metaphor.  Then he falls.  Then he falls again.  This whole scene takes up too much time as we're watching, basically, nothing happen.  He's healing from a broken back.  He tries the climb.  He falls.  He tries again.  He falls.  The point I'm getting at here - and the reason I brought up Episode 1 - is that there is a lot of filler in this movie.  I like a good story as much as anyone and can be as patient as needed.  What I don't have patience for is filler used to make the plot drag on longer than necessary.

Something that removed me from the dark, realistic magic I felt with the first two films is the voice of Bane.  I had looked forward to seeing how they took on the man who broke Batman's back and was pretty let down.  The voice was just...cartoonish and silly.  He sounded jolly and amused throughout the whole movie instead of angry and vengeful.  Just a wasted opportunity.  But that's the comic book fan in me talking.

When done well, I can return to a previously read comic book or previously watched movie and not feel too burned out.  This...is not one of those movies.  I don't think I went in with my expectations too high.  The first two were top notch for the genre and showed that the character (or ""franchise"" if you want to think in business terms) was in good hands.  While it was decent to watch once, I doubt I will revisit The Dark Knight Rises again anytime soon.",1356652800,,2960,4.402957486136784

I think the movie was great and had great acting. Christopher Nolan did some great directing, top of the notch. But like some reviews have said, it felt rushed in some parts and unexplainable in some areas. Why does Batman take a whole 8 years off? Why does he have such a bad limp and messed up knee? He's had 8 years to heal and have surgeries and gadgets to make it feel better?  Anne Hathaway did a good performance too, more than I initially thought she was going to do. However, I believe that she could have had a bigger and wider part and impact in the movie. I saw the chemistry and what not between Selina and Bruce, however it was quick and short. I also understand why Nolan decided not to mention The Joker out of respect to Heath Ledger, however I believe that he should have been mentioned at least once. A lot of what was happening and how Gotham City is comes from what The Joker did in The Dark Knight. No way in hell that every criminal is behind bars and what not. Bane was an admirable villain to Batman, short of the performance of The Joker's, however he did the part very well. Talia had an impact of the movie of course, but why so quick though? I'm not going to detail every single part of the movie, you can watch it for yourself and decide. But like I said, great movie, not the best in the trilogy, maybe the worst of them. But not saying that it's a bad movie, not by far. Just the worst of the 3 that Nolan made. You decide how you think the movie is compared to the 3. I'll keep watching all 3 of them over and over.

4426722,5,B004LWZWGK,"(Note: This review contains excerpts from my IMDB review and new thoughts on the Blu-Ray release)

Directed and Co-Written by Nolan (With his brother Johnathan and fellow screenwriter David S. Goyer), ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is as good a follow-up to the previous film as possible.

Eight years after the previous film, Bruce Wayne, troubled by the death of Rachel and forced to retire the Batman persona, has become a sort of self-isolated hermit living in his rebuilt mansion. However, a chance encounter with a skillful and gorgeous burglar named Selina Kyle, as well as the emergence of a violent and diabolical new villain called ""Bane"", force him out of retirement, as he resumes the role of the caped crusader.  At the same time, an idealistic and good-hearted cop named John Blake works with Comissioner Gordon to piece together what is happening.

After many twists and turns, the stage is set for the final battle for Gotham's soul. And it is an incredible, memorable and fitting conclusion.

The film isn't perfect.  The first half-hour or so is a wee-bit sloppy at times, and things don't quite ""gel together"" and make sense until later in the movie.  This is also a simpler story than the prior film and a bit more formula-driven, which might put-off some fans.

But everything else was magnificent.  The acting is uniformly fantastic, the action is the best in the series, the story and character development is very solid, and all-in-all, it's a great conclusion to the series.

So, for me, the film is about a 4.5 out of 5.  Not quite as perfect as the last film, but darned good.

The Blu-Ray is decent for the most part, but didn't impress me as much as the previous film.  I'm not even going to address the whole digital-copy mess that so many other people have already complained about.

The picture quality is fantastic.  The film automatically changes aspect-ratios to accomdate for scenes shot in IMAX (some scenes shot on 35mm have ""black bars"", whereas other scenes on the taller and wider IMAX format fill up the entire screen without black bars), which is a bit distracting at first, but allows us to get a good replica of the IMAX image.  The film looks great on Blu-Ray, and in particular, the IMAX scenes are gorgeous and have exquisite detail that DVD just won't give you.  (Sorry DVD crowd, but I've given up on that format, Blu-Ray's the way to go)  The sound quality is great, although the 5.1 audio mix sounded funny coming out of my TV's speakers.  (Dialog was occasionally over-powered by music and sound in a way that I didn't experience in theaters)  But it might have just been my TV.

The special features are decent, but didn't impress me as much as the last film's Blu-Ray release.  There's about an hour (maybe an hour and a half) of Behind-the-Scenes featurettes, which are interesting and informative.  But for whatever reason, even though the last two movies had an option to play them along with the movie (in a way that the movie would transition into the featurettes, before resuming after), this one puts them on a seperate disc.  It felt inconsistant.

There is also a very cool hour-long documentary on the history of the Batmobile that is the highlight of this release.

But other than that, there's only really a trailer/promotional art gallery, and it felt kind of anti climactic.

I'm glad catwoman carried serious weight (as a character and in the action) while ""robin"" was just starting to figure the world out and was lucky he didn't get himself killed. Of course I'm sad it wasn't as action-packed as the 2nd, but the boy singing the National Anthem was spot on for the mood of #3.

4426735,2,B004LWZWGK,"This was my least favorite of the trilogy and I won't go in depth as to why (there are many similar reviews); in a nutshell I thought it was too long, somewhat muddled with no clear plot progression or climaxes, and required a strong ability to suspend disbelief to make it even remotely enjoyable. ""Boring"" would not be too harsh a word in my opinion.

But the REAL travesty is the incredibly poor job of mixing the sound, in my case DTS-HD 5.1 found on the blu ray.  As a self-proclaimed home theater junky I expected a crisp, immersive surround sound experience from such a major title (even though it was disappointingly in 5.1 and not 7.1) and instead I found a surround mix devoid of any life or character... for most of the movie I could have just had my front stereo speakers on and not noticed much of a difference!  Center channel signals were weak and haphazardly edited, rear surround signals unbalanced, seeming non-existent for much of the movie and then suddenly punctuated with a gunshot or two that actually sounded good... for a second.

And the LFE (Low Frequency Effects)?  I must actually issue a WARNING!!!  These are not only terrible but may also damage your home theater equipment!  Did they let a drunken intern decide the LFE mixing?!?!  I think these were ripped straight from the cinematic release and unless your ""home theater"" resides in a 5,000 sq.ft room with over $50,000 worth of commercial grade sound reproduction equipment you are unlikely to find this overemphasized bass very usable or enjoyable.  Those watching on a TV alone will never notice it, but if your home theater speaker system is too large to fit in the trunk of your car (Home Theater in a Box) I HIGHLY recommend that you keep the volume levels down, especially on a powered subwoofer, until you discover for yourself how it will react to this sound track!  I personally found nearly a +8 decibel bass boost to my *front speakers*, sound that should be going to the subwoofer (which was also over boosted), and I found it at even some of the strangest times like when a car is driving down the street...  What?!?!  At ""theater reference""  SPL, you can (and might!) damage your speakers at high volume levels, particularly the subwoofer.  NO, this is not ""awesome!""  This is shoddy work.  Listen to the LFE found in the beach scene in ""Saving Private Ryan"", the pod racer scene from Star Wars Episode 1 ""The Phantom Menace"", or ANY of the depth charge scenes from the home theater reference movie ""U-571""...  THAT is what surround sound should sound like.",1356566400,4,2558,4.686800894854586

Can't do much if the writing has no wit etc. The main bad guy, Bane, is just boring, especially his annoying Darth Vader voice/Hannibal rip off mask etc., These guys shouldn't talk a lot but this one does. The good/bad girl is hot of course, and possibly the best acting with weak lines. Nolan, normally superb, is equally flat and his bad boy voice is just as annoying as Bane's.

4426761,1,B004LWZWGK,"I waited for ""Dark Knight"" to arrive on PPV purposely, because being a fan of most of the Batman flicks and experiencing loud, unruly behavior in theaters by kids and adults who act like kids - such as texting, talking, passing gas, laughing and just annoying behavior overall, I waited anxiously for Dark Knight's arrival to Amazon, so that I could enjoy it in the privacy and peacefulness of my own home.

Clearly this flick was made to be seen on the big screen because the sound throughout the entire movie was 'off', muffled voices, music loud in some scenes and barely heard in others.

The acting (acting?) was well, less than professional and the plot was painfully predictable. The worse character was Bain, after about 15 minutes into the movie I was hoping desperately that he would remove that stupid, childish NOT-frightening  mask, so he (Bain) *may* have been a bit less boring. In my opinion, Dark Knight is a Batman ""wanabe"" and in the most desperate way and I found myself wishing that I had in fact seen this movie in a noisy theater, at least the typical unchecked rudeness of others would have probably provided much more 'entertainment' than the Dark Knight. Oh, did I mention I'm also NOT a fan of Christian Bale?",1356566400,7,1236,4.686635944700461

4426767,2,B004LWZWGK,"I finally watched the Dark Knight Rises today and I must say after 2 1/2 hours I felt unsatisfied with the movie. I was excited to see Bane take center stage in the film, but then at the end I was let down as it was revealed he was just a willing pawn in the whole Talia revenge scheme (though I loved his voice acting and accent). I was hopping for a Knightfall saga storyline, not a rehash of the first film's plot line. The Bane from the comics was very intelligent and never worked for anyone but himself. Plus he deduces Bruce's secret identity but in the movie the audience has know idea how or why he does so. Never in the film does Bane talk about eliminating Batman or admiring his skill and reputation as an equal to his own skill. In the comics, after staging multiple crime events to see Batman in action, Bane determines to fight Batman in order to see if Batman is a challenging an opponent as he appears to be. He wouldn't have willingly died in a nuclear blast. I didn't get the sense that he was a believer of Ra's manifesto. I know people will say it was because he loved Talia and was enabling her to carry out her late father's plans to destroy Gotham. But I say bulls*** to that flimsy excuse. Why would she sacrifice herself? As heir to the League of Shadows and Ra's legacy, her job should have been to strike at Gotham City first then the rest of the world as Ra's was an eco-terrorist whose ultimate goal was a world in perfect environmental balance. He believed that the best way to achieve this balance is to eliminate most of humanity, not blow your self up. So how does destroying herself, Bane and Gotham further that goal? What about her father's organization? Doesn't she care about his legacy? If she was in suicide bomber mode from day 1 why this long, drawn out 5 month bomb plot? Why not detonate it after making a statement to the world about how it's become corrupt and needs to be destroyed starting with Gotham (again why just Gotham). Instead she spends years trying to develop a clean energy reactor that can be turned into a nuclear bomb? Were there no bio weapons available to destroy Gotham with or other nuclear bombs? she needs to spend 8 years plotting to destroy Bruce? Since he was a recluse, couldn't she have gotten Bane to invade the manor and kill him a long time ago? Why didn't Lucious Fox flood the chamber after Bane forced him to activate the reactor? Why was she worried about detonating the bomb when she stabs Batman? Why didn't Batman immediately react and take her down when she stabs him? Instead he grimaces for 3 minutes while she reveals her identity. Since she knew exactly how little time was left on the clock why the rush to detonate it early? She waited 5 months, would another 15 minutes have made a difference? So the bomb doesn't remotely detonate, again with only 15 minutes left, why does she feel the need to get to the truck carrying the bomb and protect it? She sabotaged the reactor, so no one could use it to defuse the bomb anyway.
Next issue I had was how did Bruce become a cripple? I don't recall him been severely injured at the end of Dark Knight? Yes he fell with Harvey and was shot, but how did he lose all the cartilage in his knees? Why then the brace on only one knee? What about his shoulders and arm joints the doctor says are also shot? Why would he allow himself to get out of shape even if he wasn't Batman anymore? Plus how does a clearly unconstitutional law (due process anyone) stay enacted for 8 years? How many prisons would Gotham have needed to house all the criminals affected by this act? Just Blackgate? What about Arkham Asylum? Are we to assume that in this DC universe there are no other super criminals to take advantage of a Batman free zone (of course Catwoman is the only criminal still at large apparently)? We can have Batman imitators in hockey masks in Dark Knight taking down crime, but not Joker imitators in Returns causing it? Wasn't the point of Dark Knight that Batman sacrificed his good guy image to Dent in order to protect Gotham by being the bad guy? But then he retires right after? He saves Dent from the Joker, but then people assume he changed his mind and killed Dent later and thus allow the Dent Act to be passed because of that belief? Then he saves Gotham by somehow flying really fast past the 6 mile mark, drops the bomb and fly's another six miles to avoid the blast all in what, 2 minutes? No EMP or shockwave to deal with? Wouldn't an underwater explosion have been better for the city then an midair explosion?
Then Catwoman somehow strikes a love chord with Bruce as a fellow solitary solider and they live happily ever after even though she clearly sees him as the 1% and leads him into a trap with Bane rather then try to help him defeat Bane or just leave the city altogether. They had 2 1/2 hours to throw some extra scenes together expanding on this ""relationship"" with Catwoman that he somehow develops in the whole 10 minutes he spends with her. Batman would never align himself with a thief.
Next is the whole Bane subplot/motivation for blowing up parts of the city and keeping everyone a prisoner on the island. His whole French revolution ideology just grated me like fingers on a chalk board. Storm the Bastille. Strike down the rich and let the people (specifically criminals locked up by the Dent Act) exact their revenge on the evil rich people. Take from the rich. Redistribute the wealth that was stolen by the rich people and their greedy corporations. Socialism and free healthcare for all! All that was missing was the guillotine. They could have followed the No Man's Land storyline (which parts of this movieare based on) without the liberal social commentary about the poor, repressed 99% exacting their pound of flesh (figuratively and literally) from the evil bourgeoisie. What was his real motivation for dying with Talia? The whole anarchy angle seemed too out of character for him. He never explained to the audience why he was doing all of this outside of his reciting the speech stolen from Gordon. How does causing a jail break do anything if you've got a nuke ready to go off anytime? I think a nuke trumps a puny jailbreak in order to punish the rich.  He's the head of the  (not Talia apparently) but wants to blow himself up with a nuke in 5 months. Huh? He allows Talia to lead him around by the balls while she spends years plotting her revenge on Bruce, so what's he doing in the meantime? He arrives back at the League of Shadows 8 years ago, has a police record (which the real Bane would never be so sloppy as to leave a trail for the police to follow) and has been doing what exactly?
The whole pacing of the film was off. Too much time jumping between scenes near the end. Too much disconnect between Bane and Batman. Bane breaks his back and a guy punches the vertebrae back into place and somehow he heals with days to spare. Why is Bane so strong? In the comics it's due to the Venom drug and his experience in hand to hand combat. When he's fighting Batman at the end and he punches holes in the marble pillars, how did he not break his hand/arm? Not even Batman could have done that. Where were Batman's gadgets during the two fights with Bane? No grappling hooks to gain the high ground? No smoke bombs to hide in the shadows? How does the police know about Bane but not Bruce? The whole prison scene flashback occurs 30 years ago so Talia has to be pushing 40 and Bane has to be pushing 60, but yet Bane seems very young and very strong for someone who suffered a massive beating and exposure to a plague. How does the mask keep the pain at bay? How did Batman not think to smash the mask during their first encounter? If you saw someone wearing a big respirator/mask and they were kicking the s*** out of you, wouldn't you try to dislodge the mask?
Lastly, how did ""Robin"" deduce Bruce was Batman from having met Bruce once a long time ago and recognizing Bruce had the same hidden pain that he had from losing his parents? From that Batman decides to reveal the hidden Batcave to him? Did he leave the Dummies Guide to Batman on the counter along with the keys to the Batmobile (where was that in the movie)? Meanwhile, with his city is in ruins, Bruce is frolicking with Selina in the French Riviera while some kid he just met has the run of the Batcave. Where did they get the money to live in Europe? He's okay living off funds from stolen property? What about Alfred? Is he helping out ""Robin""? It took Bruce a decade training with the masters from the League of Shadows and his own highly rational mind and exceptional deductive skills to create the persona of Batman. Meanwhile the Dent Act is repealed, criminals are loose on the streets (where's the Joker), the city is going to have to depend on the rich to finance all of the billions of dollars in reconstruction, many of whom are dead or have left, the main benefactor of the city (Wanye foundation) is in financial ruins, Gordon likely loosing his job (though I fail to see how the passage of the Dent Act was his responsibility like ""Robin"" seemed to think so) and now Bruce decides his work is finished for real and that ""Robin"" can take up the mantle? A rookie cop with the legal name of ""Robin"" who possesses only basic police skills? Couldn't they have given him an actual character's name like Jason Todd or Tim Drake or Dick Grayson?
The whole movie leaves too many plot holes and unanswered questions and doesn't fit with the other two movies. The ending felt rushed and too convenient with the introduction of the bomb that no one could destroy or disarm. The movie was too long for as little as was accomplished as far as character development goes. I give it 2 stars out of 5.",1356566400,9,9751,4.425709515859766

4426797,3,B004LWZWGK,"I am so tired of Superhero's developing negative self-images, self doubt and self-loathing. This is not the personality I recall from the comic books I loved. These heroes had compelling reasons to do what they do; they had drive and energy to develop and master super abilities and invent whizbang new devices. They mastered themselves, controlled their environment, and defeated their criminal adversaries. They knew who they were, what they had available, and how to get the job done, and they kicked ass. ESPECIALLY BATMAN! He's a normal guy (no special powers) spurred by the brutal murder of his family in his presence leaving nightmares and loneliness in it's wake. With the help of Alfred, who nurtured, supported and assisted him; he trained his body,honed special skills, invented special tools and weapons; and when he was ready, he became the Batman. The Batman in this series is a lovelorn whiner and self-doubter with a crumbling sense of self - where'd that come from! Now they even have Alfred abandoning his commitments to Bruce/Batman. They've even got Alfred whining and whimpering about his failed expectations and he quits! I am disappointed and ashamed of Alfred. I don't like this Batman and I don't appreciate this change in this character. Stan Lee should have his ASS KICKED (Whap! Bing! Bang! Wop!)!!! The movie has great special effects, lots of action, and good suspense - it'll bring in the $$. It's this new Batman and Alfred, especially Alfred, that disgusts me.

4426801,1,B004LWZWGK,"This review has nothing to do with the actual movie, the actors, the director, the story, etc.  It has everything to do with the actual Blu Ray disc set.

I received this for Christmas to round out the trilogy (we own the other two Dark Knight movies on Blu Ray as well).  There seems to be a problem with the transfer.  The movie starts out in full widescreen, with Letterbox black bands on top and bottom (for the record, we have a one year old Samsung LED 1080p HDTV).  However, early in the movie it suddenly switches from from the Letterboxed wide screen to full frame. Then it goes back to Letterbox.  This proceeds to happen back and forth throughout the movie, making it nearly unwatchable (not really, but I think you're getting the gist).

At first I thought it might be something to do with my Blu Ray DVD player, which is a 3 year old LG model.  However, I did put the disc into another Blu Ray player that was purchased at Christmas and the same thing occurred.

I'm not normally one to give a low review to products on Amazon that I feel are just a defective anomoly, as I know things do happen.  I try not to assume that the product is generally ""bad"", especially when it can be exchanged.  However, I wanted to see if this is something that others are experiencing on their particular version of the movie.

I'm going to return the Blu Ray for a replacement and see if this was just an anomoly with the particular disc that was received.  I will update if this is fixed with the replacement.",1356480000,,1507,4.358422939068101

I even find this better than both Batman Begins and The Dark Knight (both of which I also own). The storyline is especially one to pay attention to because it relies HEAVILY on Batman Begins. You should know who Ra's Al Ghul is before watching or re-watching because only then will it make sense.

I have a 96"" 2.35:1 screen, so I had to watch the movie with the 2.35:1 scenes reduced to 66% of the normal picture area to keep the 1.85:1 scenes within the screen dimensions. Whoever thought it was a good idea to shoot a movie this way should never be allowed to make another movie. Also, the audio volume of the 1.85:1 scenes was significantly higher than the 2.35:1 scenes, necessitating large sound level adjustments with every aspect ratio change.

4426822,3,B004LWZWGK,"First off let me say that I LOVE the Batman character.  I also love the direction Chris Nolan took the story.  When I compare this to his first two, it disappoints.  Take the first two away and I would probably rated it higher.  There is plenty of problems with this story.  Lots of problems with the story.  SPOILERS: How does a man with no money travels across the world from the prison, how an ancient prison with no escape has cable and electricity, rookie cops could never just become Batman, leaving the batcave to him was garbage, parents die and inspires you to fight, girl you barely had a relationship dies and you quit for eight years, Alfred thinks your dead but your not and you let him cry like a baby over your empty grave and later he smiles about it?, Bane with no venom?, no guns yet every vehicle you drive has guns, ""The Bat"" is probably the worst name for a helicopter like vehicle.

4426830,5,B004LWZWGK,This tale of the Batman carries a strong and action packed sequence of events that lead up to the saving of Gotham by the Masked Crusader. Nolan took the story far and this movie reflects his own interest in the crime fighter. This movie could not have been made by someone who doesn't love the Batman. An unusual assortment of criminal elements add to the plot with a twist at the end. Actor Christian Bale has definitely matured into the part and is more convincing than ever as the Batman. I didn't initially like Nolan's choice for the Batman but now I've grown to love Bale's rendition of the caped crusader. Overall I would say that of all the Batman movies this one delivers the biggest bang for the buck and the audience is left feeling very... Good...

4426845,2,B004LWZWGK,"Probably one of the most anticipated releases with all knowing this would be Christopher Nolan & Christian Bale's last go with the Batman series. Being a fan of the 1989 movie with Keaton and watching the next 3 get cluttered with too many plots/sub-plots/villains and special effects sadly, Dark Knight Rises is just cluttered with artsy/fartsy crap. What made the 1989 Batman film great was it was a story one could follow. Batman=good guy / Joker=bad guy! We see how the Joker comes to be and, while Batman already is the story goes through to show how The Joker when young, killed Brice Wayne's parents thus giving genesis to Wayne's destiny to become Batman. A simple story with just the right amount of cast and effects to support and tell it.

After the 1989 film grew to silly with shift in directors and stars I appreciated the first of this series --- though the whole going off for to the far East for ninja training and all could have been shortened in my opinion --- because it went back to that dark look and basics. The Dark Knight had moments of excess I could do without and, unlike the rest of the planet, I didn't care for the portrayal of The Joker as some dirty Manson-like thing in make-up. I preferred Nicholson's portrayal as a more classy villain yet just as psychotic and ruthless.

Like some have mentioned the whole Robin deal was bad. Plus, the whole deal of having Bruce/Batman incapacitated only to retire, with Batman believed to be a murderer throughout was also bad. I would've preferred Batman had risen, had experimental surgery, whatever to be 100% whole and, at the end, to have stood atop a building in silhouette of the Bat Signal having the movie end with Batman's reputation and strength intact to fight on.

No doubt another actor/director will come along and regurgitate the series again with the rampant lack of imagination in Hollywood these days. We have another rebirth of Spiderman, why? they did 2 Hulk's less than 4 years apart...again why? I wish (1) the Hollywood morons would know when to quit beating a dead horse and (2) for the same morons to understand less is more, explosions and special effects are to go with the telling of the story not make up for LACK of one!

As Stallone, vocally and publicly disappointed with Rocky V did by basically doing Rocky VI....to right the wrong and allow the franchise a proper conclusion I feel Christopher Nolan & Christian Bale almost OWE THE PUBLIC that added many millions to their bank accounts a 4th. One in which The Joker returns and a repaired, 100% Batman returns.....as would his alter Bruce Wayne from the dead. They could include Robin or not. Stop yanking around with so much ambiguity and work within the confines of simple bad guy against good guy and plausible reason without mystic nonsense. Just straight across pounding violence, return to power both of Batman, Bruce and Wayne Enterprises and a conclusion befitting the series.",1356480000,,2944,4.744140625

My problem with this version is the ultraviolet digital copy which just does not work. If you're like me you remember digital copy when heading out on a trip and enjoy having movies on the road on your ipad etc. UV makes you create two separate accounts (UV and flixter- the latter probably sells your movie interests to marketing companies). Then after that long process you log into flixter to start the download (while packing bag etc) and find that the movie you just signed up for in UV isn't registered yet.

Special effects and stunts were top notch. No boom mic in this movie.

Reasons to nit-pick.

!.  Bane sounded like a Brittish banker. Not at all Darth Vader like.
2.  Raz's daughter just wanted to sleep with the guy who muredered her father? For what reason? So she could stab Bruce with a pocket knife?!?
3.  ""Hey I'm big scarry Bane, but the real villain is a 5ft brunette who Bruce had relations with."" Anybody who knows Batman lore or played the recent Arham games, knows that Raz has a daughter.
Shock value gone.
4.  Bruce's doctor wouldn't clear him for a ski trip. He gets a magical knee brace and he's back to form? Why did his captives let him keep the brace?
5.  Forget all that you know about spinal surgery. Now remember it. How much info was it? Not much I'm guessing. Do you think you can just punch a dislodged vartebrae back into place?
6.  How does Gotham, a city the size of Ney York, go without food for 5 months? They were isolated for months and I'm quit sure the grocery stores were empty after the first few weeks.
7.  Why were they keeping all the trapped Cops alive again? Providing much needed food and water for them. Why again?
8.  And lastley, because otherwise I'd be here longer and it's just a movie anyway. Robin!? Seriously? Robin wasn't even Robin's name. It was Dick. ""Check under my Porno name...The Boy WOnder!"".

 I don't hate this movie, but I think it was the worst of the three. I may seem kinda ranty. If so it's because of the love-fest this flick recieved.

 In closing I would like to say... Darknight rises is a good watch for people who can disconnect. If you are a movie buff, it's plot holes and indiscrepancies are going to bug you.

I think the negative reviews might have been a little too harsh, but that may be somewhat due to seeing it on my tv versus in the theater.

Basically, the sound quality isn't as good on my tv as in the theater, so the booming of Bane's voice wasn't pronounced, so it just more like an adaptation of Razaoul Ghuul's (sp), which it turns out was intended.

I am pleased with the series as a whole, and I like the real-world implications that they wrestled with if Batman were real - the mounting injuries and inability to do the mission.

Yes, there is all the shoot-em-up of any movie of this sort, but watching Bale's character when he was not wearing the Batman suit was the most interesting.

On a technical note:  I do like the convenience of downloading movies to my TiVo from Amazon.  But, like most, if not all, of the other services that download or stream, the sound quality seems somewhat ""dumbed down"" with reduced bit rates.  And, there are not Closed Captions which I use as I miss a great deal of the dialogue.  It sounds muddy, lacks clarity and crispness, and is more focused on bass than on mid-range and treble.

4426897,1,B004LWZWGK,Simply put this film is a piece of trash.  It plays no tribute to the Batman legend at all.  Reviewers who dare call this even a good film can only be related to the film'sdirector.  The acting is stale.  The story line--if in fact there truly was one--was so confusing that it wasn't even worth the bother to figure out.  There were some minor saving graces but not enough to even hope that the people responsible for this film should have any business trying to restore our faith in the Batman legeng--or any legend--ever again.,1356393600,8,530,4.536842105263158
4426898,5,B004LWZWGK,"OK, confessions first.  First, I'm a total Batman fan.  As a superhero, he's topnotch because he's just an ordinary guy who takes on evil under his own power with no special ""superhuman"" attributes.  Well, yeah, he does have some really cool toys...  The only Batman movie I don't own is the one with that Clooney guy...puhleeze!  Second confession:  I think Christian Bale is seriously hot.  And I also think he's one of the top 5 actors today, along with DeNiro, Hackman, Neeson, and Pacino.  From silly fun like ""Reign of Fire"" or ""Terminator Salvation"" to ""The Prestige"" or ""The Machinist"" one thing you can always count on with a Bale movie is that he is going to give it everything he's got.  He never calls it in; he inhabits his roles as if he really is that person.

All that said, in my humble opinion, this is the best Batman movie ever made.  The acting, the script, the casting, the CGI, cinemetography, sets, music, everything is absolutely flawless.  It's obvious from the first frame to the last that the utmost care went into getting this movie perfect.  Other reviewers have outlined the story, and even given some spoilers, so no need for me to tell you what it's about.  What you do need to know is that:  It's full of heartstopping, edge-of-your-seat, exciting action; it's got a great story with an evil bad guy, Bane;  it's touching and emotional, with a final resolution that brought tears to my eyes.

I saw The Dark Knight Rises in the theater with my Grandson and Son in Law; bought the DVD as soon as it was available and have watched it several times since then (4? 5?) and each time I've gotten something new from it.  It's a story of redemption, renewal, and resolution.  It's a story of extreme determination to overcome, and of finding the strength and will to heal, and get up to fight another battle and then giving it all you've got, and doing it again until you do overcome the evil.  We so need a Batman.  We need heroes who will, no matter the cost, keep fighting until the bad man is no more.  That's what The Dark Knight Rises is about.

And it's our last Christian Bale Batman movie.  It's a fitting coda to his run.",1356307200,,2158,4.502577319587629
4426899,5,B004LWZWGK,"It completely blows me away at how much flack this film is getting one of the highest money making movies this year with good reason.  I apsolutely love the Dark Knight Trilogy by Christopher Nolan I am able to put this in my Bluray box set of Nolan's WB movies perfectly.  But seriously any one of the three blows all other live action attemps away.  Some may disagree but I can honestly say that being raised on the Adam West show and owning the other 4 films which I still wonder why I even bought them on DVD.  Nolan keeps the story going with brilliant cinamatography, acting, writing and impressive visuals that are just exciting to watch.  Christian Bale, he keeps impressing me as an actor within his perfomances each and every movie.  Anna Hathaway, finally someone got Catwoman right; not puring like a cat or in a creepy stitch work custome or with a spider-man like origin with a magic cat.  Tom Hardy as Bane was excellent like the previous villians not fully quite like the comics origins and gemics wise, but completely compturing the characteristics of the character to where it fitted within the world presented.  And the little twist in the end with JGL character genious but not to surprising if familiar with Batman comics.  This is how Batman was ment to be scene not that sorry Burton/Schumaker, it did pave the way but just makes me want to blow chunks watching them now; Burton's was grose and Schumaker was part crap mixed with where the hell did these actors go wrong to be placed in these films.

Being a fan since Adam West and Burt Ward I have seen various re-telling of the epic Batman story, thinking that none could get worse than Batman Forever. Man was I ever wrong. This story makes no sense in the scheme of Batman, it flips all over the place trying to appeal to, honestly I don't know what kind of audience this new series of Batman is trying to appeal to. The characters are completely off of who they are supposed be, the story line is desperate, the attempt at a shock factor is pathetic, and half the time I couldn't understand the words Bane spoke.

4426907,3,B004LWZWGK,"It takes time to explain why TDKR failed to deliver a story equal to its successor, but in the end, TDKR's failures amount to much more than just the absence of Ledger and plot inconsistencies.  IMO, Hardy's Bane was more than a suitable replacement for the Joker and TDK had its share of plot inconsistencies.  But inconsistencies ultimately don't amount to much in the kinds of stories Nolan sets out to tell through his Batman series.

Unlike most comic book films, Nolan's Batman series was successful in producing characters that were above and beyond human.  Batman, Joker, Bane and Ra's Al Ghul were established as mythological demigods, more like Hercules and less like relate-able human beings - or at least that was the goal.

Nolan succeeded in building up the Joker as an ""Agent of Chaos"" in the second film.  The man had no identity, no face and no discernible psychology (very intentional on part of Ledger and Nolan).  The result was something we weren't used to seeing: a force uncontested by mere humans and countered only by an equally powerful hero, someone who was ""More than just a man.""

On the other hand, Ra's Al Ghul was too relate-able as a human being to be presented simultaneously as a demigod (for lack of a better term).  He had a face, he was compelled by very human emotions (the loss of loved ones as he alluded earlier in the first film).  You could see that Nolan was aiming for in Batman Begins.  But he ultimately fumbled Al Ghul's character and Batman himself was brought down by the blunder - by meeting his match in a relate-able human character, Batman himself is established as little more than a relate-able man.  Not only was Al Ghul too relate-able, but his character wasn't present for most of the film.

These kinds of demigod-type characters like the Joker NEED screen-time to be full established emotionally.  It's because of this kind of mythological story telling that a logical plot ultimately isn't as important as consistent emotional establishment of who the heroes and villains are and the themes each of them represent.

The Dark Knight succeeded in delivering these super-human characters and it looked like the The Dark Knight Rises was going to be just as successful, if not more.  The Joker was like a force of nature, but was very limited in his influence.  Even though it seemed like Luck and Fate itself were on the Joker's side, he wasn't physically intimidating without his knives and his charisma and influence were limited only to the mentally unstable.

Enter Bane, a Hannibal-Lector like warlord who carried all the physical prowess and charismatic leadership the Joker lacked.  While the Joker had Luck as his ally, he was no match for Bane's potency as a sort of inevitable and divine judgment about to come down on Gotham City.  Scene's like Gordon's escape from Bane's hideout painted the man as both judge and executioner, as he pronounces the error of his lackey before carrying out his execution.  And in just about every scene you see Bane's hands, someone is brutally killed.

Nolan flawlessly established Bane through emotional characterization and mythological lore, until about the last 20 minutes where he attempts a sort of bait and switch.  It's revealed that Talia Al Ghul is the true mastermind behind Gotham's destruction and Bane is simply her lackey.  As Talia explains that she was Al Ghul's child, you even feel a glimmer of pity for Bane as she reassembles the mask, which while alienating Bane as a relate-able human being earlier in the movie, makes him sympathetic when we learn how vulnerable he becomes when his pain-relieving medications are delayed - the difference between his previous victory with Batman in a one on one fight and his later defeat boils down to distraction from a painful wound?

All of the fear that Nolan had established in Bane is gone the instant Talia's true identity is revealed and yet NOTHING that Nolan established in Bane translates over to Talia Al Ghul, who is, as far as we've seen, a career woman, completely human in nature and entirely lacking the potential we imagined we saw in Bane.  First of all, she wears no mask; her human face betrays any attempt to establish a demigod in Talia.  Secondly, it's never appropriately established that she possesses any real abilities other than an ability to manipulate Bane.  While she is revealed as Ra's Al Ghul's child, Ra's Al Ghul was never himself sufficiently established as the demigod Nolan had envisioned (not to the audience anyways) and even if he were, Bane's potency derives from what we've seen him doing, NOT what we've heard other characters saying about him.  Talia is completely insignificant compared, not just to Bane, but even characters at the level of Catwoman (who is halfway between the demigod hero villains, as she's driven by very human motivations of self-gain and self-preservation) or Two-Face/Harvey Dent.  Having Talia Al Ghul revealed as Bane's Master and stabbing Batman in the back would have been as bad as having Commissioner Gordon single-handedly defeat the Joker, or Al Ghul, or even Bane.  For crying out loud, she dies in an AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT!  Can you think of a more pedestrian way for the Judge of Gotham to perish???

As Bane is revealed as a puppet and his master as a run-of-the-mill peon, the film, along with its high-stakes conflict are left without an antagonist.  And without an antagonist, all the drama quickly evaporates and leaves us with the revelation that there never really was any.

This kind of plot-twist is very appropriate in a spy-thriller from Tom Clancy, which features flawed and limited human beings in the central conflict.  It utterly fails in a story like this because the drama in a mythos-type story derives from seeing which force of nature will win out over the other.  There is a very big difference between drama that comes from limited characters doing the best within their natural constraints and forces of Nature itself vie for supremacy, which in a sense are immortal, very lucky, super-potent and in any case exist and operate outside natural constraints that the rest of mankind is bound by.

Additionally, if we're going to start viewing this trilogy through the lens of consistency and logic necessary to feel drama arise from a plot-twist, then the rest of the story immediately begins to fall apart.  How could Batman heal his back in 3 months?  How did he arrive in Gotham City?  How could the Joker depend on the school buses driving by at exactly the right time to evade the police?

Like I said, it takes time to adequately explain why this film failed to rise to the level of the second entry.  In my opinion, had Talia never been in the film and Bane simply been played straight as the sole mastermind of Gotham's destruction, along with a very different ending which pits Batman against Bane, TDKR would have easily surpassed the second.  We would have had the chance to see Batman rise to an even higher level of demigod-hood in confronting a force that surpasses the Agent of Chaos we knew as the Joker.

At this point, it seems obvious to me that the mastery of TDK came from Ledger's prominence as the Joker, because if Nolan truly understood the kind of story he had been crafting, he would have never obliterated his primary antagonist in a VERY misguided attempt at some kind of cheap trick espionage-style drama. Nolan ultimately did NOT know what he was doing and while we, the audience might not have been able succinctly describe our disappointment while leaving the theater, we all knew there was something terribly amiss.

4426915,5,B004LWZWGK,"I'm surprised at the reviews below 4 stars. Obviously it's a matter of opinion, but if you like Batman Begins and The Dark Knight I think you'll love this move. The film is a masterpiece of cinematography, and in a similar way to Lord of the Rings depicts an epic story on an epic scale. I think it's hard for people to accept this movie as rivaling the second because it would almost be sacrilege to feel they were somehow diminishing Ledger's Joker by putting it on an equal plane. Bane as the main villain in Rises is as unforgettable a character as the Joker in his own right, evoking both hatred and a sense of compassion for him, and really paying homage to The Dark Knight by creating a truly worthy end to the series. Nothing will ever take away the perfect performance of Ledger as the Joker, but every character in all of these films was acted to perfection, and that includes this movie. The whole rebooted Christopher Nolan franchise took Batman to a new level, and finally did justice to the comic and the intended portrayal of the world of Batman. If nothing else rent it, but if you are a fan it should be added to the collection. And if you like video games, start with Arkham Asylum which continues in it's own right what the films started.

UPDATE: In reading many of the bad reviews, I have come to realize that most of the them took 10 to 20 seconds to give this movie a terrible rating/review out of boredom a.k.a. attention deficit disorder. If you have an attention span and like the previous movies, you'll probably be able to sit through this too, and actually enjoy it. It has a plot, and requires some thinking and attention to detail. A few people may find this genuinely not their cup of tea, to which they should elaborate. The skewed overall rating on this film is not deserved.",1356307200,2,1809,4.448795180722891

We still had about 15 plot twists to go, and more than an hour and a half. Things went downhill from there, too, with a lot of the plot making little sense.

I was initially a bit skeptical of Hathaway's role as the Catwoman, but she pulled it off with flair and style that captured the essence of the character giving me a new respect for her skills as a actress.  While Bane was presented somewhat differently from the comics, his essence was still captured to where he, like Ledger's Joker, are almost iconic.  I also absolutely loved how the continuing legacy of the League of Shadows remains a presence to tie the 3 movies together, much like Sauron in LotR trilogy.

4426969,5,B004LWZWGK,"The Dark Knight Rises was a great end to one of the greatest trilogies ever made. I won't spoil any of the movie's plot and will only say that almost everything seems to work perfectly: the characters, the plot, action, the sets. The only thing that seemed a tad off to me was the pacing, which seemed a bit slow at times. This movie doesn't quite pack the same wallop as the The Dark Knight but it is still one of the best movies of the year and one of the best comic book based movies of all time.

The PQ is near perfect, the 1.78:1 Imax scenes are sheer perfection and the traditional 2.40:1 scenes are really great. The AQ is just perfect, every bit of dialogue is audible and the sound effects and music are all crystal clear. Most importantly is that the audio never needs to be adjusted! The special features are good: we get some nice production documentaries and HD trailers (which I think are always great to have). The lack of an iTunes copy is unfortunate but the UV digital copy serves well enough.

The BestBuy steel book is quite nice. My copy came delivered to my house day one without any scratches or imperfections. It is not the typical glossy steel book that will scratch easily for those that worry about that. The cover art, with Batman's broken mask in the rain, is very well done. The two blu-ray discs and one DVD are housed sturdily inside.

All in all, a very solid package, especially for those that have the first two steel book entries in this great trilogy.",1356307200,,1489,4.407272727272727

Bane is just an obligatory bad guy.  Bale is too arrogant and smug to play psychologically tortured.  Bruce Wayne is boring after awhile.  Dull action scenes.  Prison scenes go on forever. Movie overrelies on mood music. Certainly room for a 4th installment.  Or maybe another reboot.  There will be more Batman movies.  Maybe they won't be pretentious and dull like this one.,1356220800,,553,5.101123595505618

The entire trilogy was probably the best that I recall seeing EVER for a super hero interpretation and a movie period!  I enjoyed the depth of the movie and how it explored multiple themes like good vs bad, class warfare, loyalty, betrayal, etc.  I am sad to see the trilogy end but will enjoy watching all three movies over and over again!

By the way I think it's funny that many of the folks that says this movie was average or not good are the same ones that thinks Avengers is a masterpiece.",1356220800,2,588,4.176991150442478
4426980,4,B004LWZWGK,"Nolan created a screenplay richer than the ones in any of the previous Batman movies. The depth of the allusions, the depth of the characters, and the social critique were all far superior to any of the other movies and went a long way to capturing the way the comic evolved over many years (the world of Gotham changed from a two dimensional environment into one that had a greater dimensionality and darkness). Batman was arguably the first DC comic that could rival Marvel's dimensionality of world and characters. Bane will be remembered as one of the great movie villains. Christian Bale was excellent. He clearly took this role very seriously. Enough said. Check it out.",1356220800,2,676,4.836206896551724
4426981,3,B004LWZWGK,"Christopher Nolan's first 2 Batman movies were among my most favorite movies of all time. Thrilling, exciting, action packed and great story as well as cinematography, so it goes unsaid that I could not wait to see this movie.  I was sorely disappointed.  Its was so slow and dragged out for over the first half of the movie I could barely manage to make far enough into it and experience what Nolan did in the first movies that made them great.  But the first half of the movie ruined it for me.  Anne Hathaway, Christian Bale, Michael Caine ( peachy) and Gary Oldman [ Caine and Oldman are  actors on my personal top 10 list of actors ]  and Morgan Friedman were of course fantastic as usual.  One thing that constantly bothered me through the whole movie is that Baines Voice always sounded like it was done in a recording booth. Even when they were in concrete areas and everyone elses voice was reflecting and echoing as you would expect,  Baines voice sounded like he was in a far off studio. His voice , even if modified and electronicly enhnaced, would still echo and bounce around like any other sound would in certain enviroments. Then of course the usual batman grumble mumble you can barely understand, and its just annoying.  Its really made it seem cheesy for me.  I'm only giving it 3 stars because I really respect and like Christopher Nolan and the cinematography was as usual, great,  not because of the movie was all that great.  In my opinion.",1356220800,,1463,4.563218390804598
4426982,5,B004LWZWGK,"Great plot line, fantastic acting, well done.  Really brought the viewer from the depths of despair to the rise and defeat of evil.",1356220800,,131,4.695652173913044
4426983,2,B004LWZWGK,"Besides the odd stunning visual there is little positive to say about this film. The sound was appalling -- it was often difficult to understand what actors were saying. Part of the blame may lie with the actors themselves as most of them adopted the modern actor's naturalistic fallacy, believing it is OK to mumble and forgetting that a major part of their role is to communicate with an audience.

Christian Bales lacks lustre and charisma in this role. I thought he did well with Batman Begins but it's all downhill from there. Michael Caine seems to have one gear as Alfred -- contrived weepiness and an attachment to Bruce Wayne that is unbelievable given the lack of any real relationship between the actors on screen. Bane was passable and Anne Hathaway does a great job.

The real problem with this film for me was that it is basically an ensemble piece. There are simply too many points of view and to many bland characters I couldn't care less about. The audience is never afforded the opportunity to identify with a point of view character because the net is cast too wide. If we are to identify at all it is with the people of Gotham, looking on as observers of a Batman who is noticeable by his absence a lot of the time.

The fight scenes seemed lame, partly due to the naturalised sound effects, I imagine. The CGI looks like it was done an an iPhone app and the editing lacked continuity, presenting us with a sequence of disjointed scenes that left me wondering what on earth was going on, who I was following, and why I was even bothering to watch the rest of the film.

The concept of the Dark Knight is great but the execution in this film was poor. The writer/director seems to have no grasp of basic story-telling dynamics or the importance of engaging an audience. A good third of the film could have been cut with nothing lost.",1356220800,,1852,4.502976190476191
4426984,4,B004LWZWGK,Originally I didn't see The Dark Knight Rises at the theater because of the length. However it was good to watch from home (Amazon on-demand) so we could spread out over 2 nights.

4426986,2,B004LWZWGK,"We were fans of the first two movies but this one just didn't work well. The acting was inconsistent -- especially from Christian Bale. He is supposed to be injured and having trouble walking -- (he can barely get out of his car) then he twirls around the dance floor as if nothing were wrong -- only to limp again (and use a walking stick) later. Bruce Wayne doesn't have any emotional depth to him -- the moments he seems more . . . ""involved"" in what's happening and effected, come off as cheesy.

It's good when a movie surprises you. This one doesn't have twists so much as it seems twisted. Really the story just seemed to be a backdrop for the special effects --- so the choppiness makes sense in a way.

This is a visually appealing move with lots of action that still manages to be boring at times.",1356220800,,807,4.302631578947368

4426996,3,B004LWZWGK,"My movie review in a nutshell: Overall a great movie with one of the most intriguing villains who terrorizes the 1% whom are saved by a (former?) one percenter.

Now on to the Blu Ray which is hardly mentioned in all these reviews. It was viewed on a home theater PC with Radeon 6570 and total media theater dts-HD MA bitstream passthrough capable via Onkyo receiver to Plasma TV. Picture quality was amazing, even the night scenes with city scapes shone through, truly reference quality. One point that I found slightly distracting is the periodic change in aspect ratio. Movie starts with 1.78(full screen) then switches to 2.40 (black bars present) and this is repeated throughout the movie. I wish they'd stayed with 1.78 which apparently used an Imax camera as I found it to be more immersive. Sound is incredible, Banes voice and even Batman's gruff voice came through clearly and the explosions and the whirl of the Bat were unreal.

Finally Ultraviolet is a ripoff. You're forced to sign up with them and after going through hoops you're finally allowed to download a standard definition movie that cannot be played by windows media player or windows media center but only with a rudimentary flixster program that can't even fast forward or advance to the next scene.
I'd like to ask the Movie studios why would I want a SD copy of a High definition movie? You've already forced me into buying an unwanted DVD with this combo. I want a high definiton copy that I can stream as I did with Inception. This is the last UV copy I'll be purchasing, if the digital copy cannot be played by media player or isn't high definition I will only purchase Blu rays even if I have to do without the special features (yes, another nice trick Hollywood).
My final rating is 4.5 stars for Movie, 5 stars for blu ray and 0 stars for Ultraviolet.",1356220800,,1835,4.625766871165644

I am over 50, and I grew up with the old school superheros, so the whole ""dark"" thing is a little different than what I'm used to.
The first installments of the Dark Knight were pretty good. This movie however, was way too slow for me. Too much back-story and not enough action.
And with all the back-story, there were still some elements that weren't explained at all.
Over all, not a movie I would want to see again.",1356220800,2,492,4.358695652173913

We saw it in the third Chris Reeves' Superman movie and in the original Spiderman trilogy with Tobey Mcquire. The Chris Nolan Batman movies I'm afraid suffers the same fate. The second Chris Nolan Batman is without a doubt the best Superhero movie ever made (The Dark Knight). These shoes were impossible to fill with the late great Heath Legder's brilliant Joker probably the best movie villain of all times. Unfortunely the Dark Knight Rises is a dissapointment with a hardly discernable villain in Bain played by the gifted Tom Hardy whose motives and visage are ill defined. The plot has mores hole in it than a swiss cheese factory and the twist at the end makes no sense. Rest easy dear Heath you will never be surpassed.

4427007,1,B004LWZWGK,"I kept wanting to give up and turn this movie off, but stupidly kept going, mostly just to finish what I started (and paid for). The action -- especially fight sequences -- are crudely choreographed and never build any intensity through rhythm or suspense. Partly, the failure is due to a bunch of over-long, blubbering Michael Cain scenes where a respectable old man comes off as a whiny 11-year-old. Similarly, lots of disjointed flashback sequences try to lend depth to the villain Bain, but even behind the mask his character rarely gets better than some unknown WWF contender. The one exception there might be the slightly uncomfortable speech he gives at Black Gate prison, where he's obviously channeling some of the rhetoric of Occupy Wall Street. Nobody in the film is buying his adoption of populist rhetoric for a suicide mission to blow up the entire city (with its populace) for no other reason than personal, not even ideological, revenge. The speech has a bit of force to it, on its own, but feels like painting Occupy as violent thugs by borrowing some of their talking points or style. Notably, you never see any sequence explaining how even one member of the Gotham mobs, let alone a major or minor character, gets convinced by it -- and neither should anyone in real life come away fooled that Bain's violence has any connection to Occupy. The film could have been a bit more interestingly disturbing, had Bain taken Occupy positions to heart and crafted a plan that has anything to do with working-class interests. Instead, he's a back-handed shill for whiney aristocrats to take down (Batman / Wane) or be victimized by (everyone else).",1356220800,6,1657,4.858657243816254

Nolan should have quit while he was ahead with The Dark Knight which was way better.

However as the movie progressed things began to clear up and the flow started to take shape. I have seen all the Batman Movies and this to me was not like any that I was accustom to seeing. It was darker, but with more of a human touch, and frankly I thought it moved from action hero type film to action movie. The supervillain Bane, was one mean guy and the story line had some interesting and unexpected twists. Some of the special effects were just well, WOW!

4427031,4,B004LWZWGK,"A very tasteful amendment to the trilogy. Like a good cup of coffee after desert. The movie continually provides a constant level of entertainment with all the right qualities. It perfectly exercises a good HT system. With its DTS-MA audio mixed very well, each channel is pronounced with perfect staging, including the sub channel which consistently provides the appropriate room-rumble when awakened. No dynamic volume compression from the viewer is required either.  This film brings its thrill of surprise to the audience without rude ""volume hikes"" but instead with a story line of well-designed and often unexpected twists in plot. The whole A/V experience truly is ""mastered"" and pleasantly assembled.

The video is of course also up to its par, with rich deep color dripping from multiple pallets; rendering discernible shades of purple and black, even during the dimmest of low light scenes.
The acting - like the action - is simply excellent - with even the over-the-top portions remaining within the realm of ""believable"", yet ""stretching"" the fringes of ones imagination, considering state-of-the-art technologies.

The actors themselves were pure perfection, as thankfully expected - considering the larger-than-life individual talents automatically on tap with Cain, Freeman, and Bale. But the others of perhaps lesser film experience were no less brilliant and notable, namely both of the heroine beauties Hathaway and Cotillard - who will no doubt continue to amaze viewers for decades.

Bale's depiction of the Batman is likely to be scored second to none. And ""personally"" - I find his deep scratchy voice tone to be fearfully good - as it grips the soul with a masterful fist-clinching ""yeah!"" - each time he asserts it from beneath the mask.
(For example: In the first movie ""Begins"" - when he was holding the caught criminal at a life-threatening height to get information, the thug said ""...I swear to God!"" - but Batman shrieked back at him, ""Swear to ME!!"").

The ""Dark Knight Rises"" repeats this type of dominating command across the board in performances.  See it, borrow it, or buy it. You will not be disappointed.",1356134400,2,2142,5.176300578034682
4427032,5,B004LWZWGK,"One of two movies will win the best picture Oscar for 2012: Lincoln or The Dark Knight Rises.

The grittiness of the third Batman movie by Christopher Nolan is particularly exceptional. While the plot is to save the City of Gotham, as always, the stories are in the whys of the motivations behind the well-developed characters' actions.  This is the great common approach to the storytelling in both Lincoln and the Dark Knight Rises. And it makes a very strong storytelling, indeed.

The Dark Knight Rises starts off with evil's physical personification as stereotyped in many minds: a big burly man with a mask over his face. But we, the audience, have come to know what extreme evil might really look like: from sweet-faced medical students to twenty-something young men from affluent suburbs of America. The story goes on showing the transformation of ordinary honest working people to become extraordinary, neither by following what they are told to do, nor waiting to be told what to do--but doing what they think is the right thing to do by understanding the greater intentions that truly matter.

As for the Oscars, my vote for the best picture of 2012 would be this one, The Dark Knight Rises. Because Lincoln was easier to write, as it was already written time and again from myriad perspectives for over a century, and it was a matter of creating a great film, as it is. The Dark Knight Rises' writing is original; a much, much more difficult task, and a great film.",1356134400,,1477,4.7578125

Tom Hardy did an excellent job as Bane, and the issue with not being able to hear him is not a problem at all. He plays a very smart and tough villain, and you definitely believe he can give Batman a run for his money.

Christian Bale pulls off another great performance a a the Dark Knight. He makes you believe Batman is worn down and age is becoming a factor. Good thing he has Catwoman to help out every now and then, and she its some sweet eye candy, which is always a plus!

This is like ""The Avengers"" a great movie adaption of a successful comic. The difference is that this movie takes a little longer to unfold the story. Both movies are great.....scratch that....both movies are SUPERB in their own way.
If you like Batman, then you will have watched the previous movies and nothing will hinder you from watching this one if you haven't already.
If you don't like Batman, then you will get to like him when you watch this part or any other part of Christopher Nolan's Batman reboot.

The Dark Knight Rises continues to maintain the darkness that epitomizes good Batman movies, but this one is full of more twists and turns than in previous Batman movies. Furthermore, the ending was NOT predictable and we finally meet Robin. Yes, it can be a little sappy & syrupy, but it's a story based on a dark hero from a comic book. At least it's not as corny as a Superman movie. I cannot figure out where the next Batman movie is going to go. There are so many changes in this movie. Future Batman movies will have to establish a new base, new toys, new setting, new bad guys/girls, new good guys/girls.

The audience was left to fill in a LOT of the character development in fact, most of that depended upon assumption and inference.

While there were some small flaws with the film, I was overall satisfied with this film both as a stand alone product and as a cap to the trilogy. My biggest gripe was with Bane's voice... I think it prevented a deeper connection to the character, which is a shame because Nolan's depiction of Bane was actually deeper than I would have expected based on my knowledge of him from the comics.

4427126,5,B004LWZWGK,"As a Batman fan from wayyyy back I have been enjoying Christofer Nolan's Bat universe immensely. This final chapter is a very satisfying end to his storyline. There is enough reference to the actual Batman comics featuring Bane to satisfy the diehard fan, the inclusion of Catwoman is a great addition and ... The happy ending, while maybe a bit out of character with Nolan's tone for the trilogy is still satisfying. The Cat and the Bat have always been closely tied together but never actually get together in the books; understandable since the storylines continue on forever. But in this 'universe' it's nice to finally see a conclusion for them. And of course this version of Bane makes for an excellent villain, the action is great as expected and all in all Nolan managed to complete his story with no letdown as far as I'm concerned. Well done! Here's hoping he can do the same for Superman next year - even if he is only producing this time.",1355961600,,950,4.627218934911243

A bit too long, a bit too much padding.
Fantastic conclusion to the trilogy.
Bane may be better than the Joker, for his voice and sheer brutality and single-minded focus. Really makes you wonder if he can be stopped.

The cowl itself was smaller than I was expecting (I was expecting it to be close to life-size). However the quality is still good and it looks great on my shelf next to my entire movie collection. The blu-ray, dvd, and special features disc are all contained in a circular case (rather than a traditional blu-ray case) which tucks into the back of the base of the bat cowl. It's a rather neat design that keeps the pieces together nicely. As a big fan of the trilogy, I can say I am very happy with this purchase to complete the set.",1355875200,,705,4.3893129770992365

4427140,5,B004LWZWGK,"Nolan, Nolan and Goyer prove they have obviously read plenty of classic Batman tales. One can identify elements of 'The Dark Knight Returns'; 'Knightfall' and 'No Man's Land' are fairly obvious. 'A Lonely Place of Dying' and 'Batman Beyond' can also be seen.

Nolan has a degree in literature and it shows, the depth of each character is astounding.  The old faces of Alfred, Lucius, and Gordon are back and Nolan finds a role for each of them.

Bruce Wayne is again explored alongside Batman. physically and psychologically 'The Dark Knight' and surrounding events have taken thier toll on the hero who bears scars that are obvious on the inside and out.

The villains Bane and Catwoman (referred to only once as 'the cat') from the comics appear in this adaptation. Bane was a simpering idiot used as muscle in... Let's not bring up bad memories. Here Bane is closer to his comic interpretation where he is a cold, calculating genius whose strength is a tool to be used alongside any other and not a crutch. Fans may be wondering where Bane's famous Venom has gone, and about the changes to his costume. Needless to say everything has a reason afterall the joker didn't wear make up in the comics.

Selina Kyle is so much closer to the comics than any other live action interpretation. Older fans are sure to look back on Pfeiffer with nostalgia, but that was Tim Burtons reimagining, though the closest villain to the comics, even his catwoman was off. Hathaway's costume reminds me of a Nolanized interpretation of the newmar costume. Her personality certainly fits the role.

Finally there are a few characters, Miranda Tate who plays a character that can be recognized by long time fans. Daggett is in fact a creation of the animated series played a but differently and probably the flattest character. Last is John Blake whose name hides the fact that he is based on Tim Drake.

The award winning cinematographer Wally Pfister returns to bring a beautifully shot film that deserves another Oscar, though I think the Director deserves one most.

For those not into Cinematography, there is of course Hans Zimmer's score which feels like listening to the epic quality of the rest of the movie.

I must say this film is so very close to perfection, though a few issues near the end that hold me back from saying it is perfect. I hold this maybe a fifth of a star less than The Dark Knight, and I implore you to watch this without too many expectations of the previous.",1355875200,,2472,4.690531177829099

Awesome music sets the tone for this dark yet inspiring last film in the dark knight series. After watching it, I happened to stream the original bat man film from well before my time (with the bat helicopter and penguin/joker/riddler on a submarine) to show my kids...boy am I glad they have moved away from the cheesiness of that and later films (arnold as freeze, john carey as the riddler) because the new dark, action packed versions leave you really appreciating both christian bale as an actor and batman as a real bad-a$$ facing quasi  realistic adversaries using futuristic, yet believable technologies (the bat helicopter ""thing"" is awesome and the militarized versions of the new batmobile and motorcycle reinforce a otherwise awesome movie)...

The three latest batman movies are easily the best three batman movies and may be some of the best comic book movies of all time.  Is the dark night better than the dark night rises?

The only reason I give the product one star less is this dropping of the more universal iTunes digital copy version for this clunky and complicated UV digital version that isn't really a digital version of your own, as I understand it. It's a crappy and misleading selling point that was very disappointing and I can't really use it conveniently like the previous iTunes digital add-ons to buying the blu ray.
We all know the movie industry will do anything they can to make a buck from the masses, but this UV corral they're herding us into is crappy.

Most people don't realize The Batman is a borderline psychotic. The Dark Knight showcases this psychosis better than any other previous effort. Bruce Wayne is not just some rich playboy playing vigilante. He's a man driven by an obsession. Very action packed yet does not seem to rely heavily on CGI. The one perplexing thing about Bane is no to very little back-story is presented. This worked in the previous film because the Joker was an absolute character. The Bane character needed more development. This was probably Christian Bale's best acting effort and of the three and Gary Oldman is stellar as usual.

The plot was drawn out and hard to follow. This movie should have been cut down to about 2 hours. The fight scene between Bane and Batman was lame; if all it took to defeat Bane was a few punches to his face, why didn't Batman do that in the first place?

As usual, Christian Bale's exaggerated vocal performance was just silly. Between his throaty rasp and Bane's mask, I found a lot of the dialogue difficult to understand. I probably didn't miss much though.

The only positive point to this movie--other than the obvious: special effects--was [SPOILER ALERT] the introduction of Robin at the end.

Oh and Robin was a circus performer, not a Gotham city cop. I could say more and more bad things about this, but frankly I have things to do. One thing I did like was the villain. Baine was funny.

4427200,2,B004LWZWGK,"I liked the first movie very much. The second movie had a riveting perfomance by Heath Ledger that made up for structural flaws. This movie is structurally, logically, and morally a mess.

Many spoilers below...

The whole first third of the movie moves like molasses, though Bane is an interesting and formidable
character. Catwoman is shoehorned into the plot and is so despicable and amoral
in the beginning that I never grew to like her character at all and I certainly
cant imagine why Batman would, although Anne Hathaway is pretty hot in that
catsuit, so I guess that mitigates Batmans stupidity.

I thought it was sort of interesting that Wayne lost all his money, although the
mechanism for his losing it is complete nonsense. Of course, somehow he gets to keep his mansion,
so he has access to all his batstuff. Except somehow he loses track of his fusion reactor/bomb thingie. Yeah, that would totally happen.

Then, Alfred takes a powder, just when Bruce needs him the most, then disappears from the movie entirely, except for the prototypical Nolan ambiguous ending. I can only assume there are deleted scenes with him in them. Otherwise, it was a completely foolish plot point, intended only to strip Batman of his closest ally (oh, and I
suppose a little bit to forward the idea that Batman is more valiant and capable if he fears deathsay what now?).

In the comics, Bane does indeed beat Batman bloody and break his back, but it doesn't work in a
film context. In Frank Miller's famous Dark Knight Returns, Batman takes on
Superman himself and kinda wins. Bane is gonna beat him? Please. And who heals a
broken back with a rope pulley and cheery thoughts from a guy who speaks English when it's suddenly convenient?

The Batman is also supposed to be wicked smart, not just indomitable and brave and so forth. He never
outsmarts anybody in Nolan's films because Nolan isn't that smart and couldn't think of a way to outwit Bane. Batman is the World's Greatest Detective, but he never detects anythng in these movies, just punches everything a lot and has cool toys invented for him by this Fox guy who is a nonentity in this movie, a terrible waste of Morgan Freeman's talents.

Lots of other problems. Bane knows all of Wayne's secrets? How did that happen?
The League of Shadows is still dedicated to...huh? Miranda was the child in the pit? What now?

The whole plot of this movie is a soap bubble that only wishes it was as substantial as cellophane.

I am giving this misbegotten mess two stars because there are occasional good moments, like ""So, that's what that feels like."" and ""This isn't a car."" Also, Anne Hathaway in a catsuit; that's worth a star right there. Otherwise, meh.",1355875200,9,2706,4.716101694915254

I am the biggest Batman fan ever. Been a fan since 1974 when I was 2 years old and I loved the movie. Sure I'd love to see more of the Batman I grew up loving, but when you have a film maker like Chris Nolan he is going to kind of do his own thing. He still stayed well within many of the Batman mythos. Some people talk about the plot holes and while there are a couple minor small plot holes, the are nowhere near as big as some may have you believe. eNone are any bigger than you'll see in some of the best movies ever made. Seriously people, plot holes are everywhere in films if you'r looking hard enough. But I don't bother with such things because I am usually to busy trying enjoy a film, not act like a I am so much smarter than everyone else because I spotted a couple little plot holes. They of course never point out these holes because most of them don't exist. I think that most of these people just weren't bright enough or interested to keep track of what what going on. The ending of the movie is visceral and emotional. Of the ending doesn't follow the comic book Batman because there is no ending in the Batman comic books and there never will be. Comic book hero's are perpetually between 27-35 years old. For what it is it's a nice tidy ending to Chris Nolan's Batman trilogy. I still think Batman Begins is as close as we've come to THE Batman on film and it is still my favorite of all the Batman movies, but this one is pretty good and ranks right up there with Nolan's other two Batman flicks. Best comic book/superhero movie of the year. I loved Avengers, but that is light pop corn fluff compared to this movie. I believe TDKR and Dredd 3D were 1,2 with Avengers and Amazing Spider-man also being really good comic book movies.",1355788800,,1908,4.215846994535519

4427271,3,B004LWZWGK,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

It's hard for me to pinpoint the exact word to describe this film, so I'll stick with disappointing. After a year of teaser trailers and posters perhaps the film reached an unreachable level of hype. Maybe The Dark Knight set the standards too high on what this series could be, either way the final film in the trilogy is a let down.

From the start Christopher Nolan put himself in a tight situation by choosing Bane as the villain. There isn't much to Bane and Nolan's version doesn't add anything special. Top that off with a muzzle that makes some of his sentences impossible to understand and you're left with a very boring character who seems to contradict himself with what his main goal is. Considering what he had to work with Tom Hardy's performance wasn't bad, but it wasn't groundbreaking either.

Next we have Ms. Selina Kyle played by Anne Hathaway. Out of everything I read leading up to this release it was this character that people were most worried about. Many felt like Hathaway didn't have what it takes to pull off a sassy character like Catwoman, I think it's safe to say that she proved them wrong. Not only did she give a hell of a performance, but she looked damn good in that outfit.

Then you have the most unexpected performance out of the whole cast from Joseph Gordon-Levitt. This man is making his mark in the film industry and deserves every ounce of fame he gets from it. I wasn't expecting his character to have such a major role in the film, but his character John Blake was really something else. In short he's the only cop with a brain among thousands of others who probably can't spell their own name. Which, in my eyes, is a good reflection of the law enforcement in the real world. For every good cop there's a thousand worthless one's.

The problem with Rises is not the acting, but the story. ""Batman Begins"" set the standard on what a Batman movie should be. Dark and gritty. Time and time again the Batman films tried too hard to be lighthearted and that's what stopped them from being great. Then they took everything that worked with Begins, improved it, and made ""The Dark Knight"". Every aspect of the film was improved on: the story, the villains, the plot twists, everything left you breathless. I can't tell you how many times I thought The Dark Knight ended only to be caught off guard by the excellent writing. That's all absent in this film.

The thing is, instead of sticking with the formula that worked, they tried to go above and beyond that. That's why the story was so terrible, it was forced to try and replicate the complexity of The Dark Knight. They threw in plot twists alright, but they were all pointless. There was numerous times where I just found myself bored and I started looking around the room at random objects.

They then proceed to add so many insignificant characters that I don't care about, and you shouldn't care about, and tried to make them into some complex piece of the story. Miranda Tate was, to put it bluntly, f***ing pointless. Realizing her insignificance they try to weave some deep story with her and Bane and it just winds up being a snore fest. Leaving us with an ending that felt forced because it was the last Batman film for Nolan. And don't even get me started on the Batwing... oops, I'm sorry, ""The Bat.""

Overall Score: 6/10 - Had this been a standalone Batman title, I probably would've enjoyed it more. However, Nolan set standards for his Batman films, standards he wasn't able to meet. Having this be my most anticipated film of the year, only to be left with this... it saddens me. It's clear that Nolan was trying to top all the big sales that The Dark Knight reached, and it winds up being his downfall. A poor choice of a villain, and the small amount of screen time Batman actually received... I'm just at a loss for words at this point.",1355788800,,3900,4.545584045584046

The discs themselves are filled to the rim with all sorts of extra features. Nolan is notorious for not doing deleted scenes because of the way he shoots and edits in advance.

4427291,4,B004LWZWGK,"I won't comment on the movie itself, since I assume most people looking to purchase this title actually knows what the movie is about.  My comments reflect what I myself wondered about when I made the decision to purchase this particular Blu-ray/DVD/UV copy combination.

Overall Impression: Blu-rays definitely got more love than DVDs for all three Nolan-verse Batman movies. I got this combination because I prefer to have Blu-ray and DVD at the same time, and I think it was a better decision than purchasing the DVD/UV version.  The combo version has three discs -- two Blu-ray and one DVD -- and contains a good amount of special features.

Quality: Blu-ray, like with TDK, uses different aspect ratio for IMAX footage, which is great, if not quite as overwhelming on a home screen (46"" HD for me) as it was on proper IMAX theater screen.  Otherwise, the picture's crisp, sound is good, and my copy's already borne repeated watching with no problems.  DVD uses fixed widescreen format throughout, and again, nothing to complain about.

Special Features: Special features are found spread over both of the Blu-ray discs.  I'll try to dig up a full list some other time, but most of them are unique and do not overlap much with the special features for earlier films (except for things like the special documentary on the Tumbler/Batmobiles).  Pretty good materials, overall, though a lack of ""play everything"" option (like in the Lord of the Rings appendices) gets a bit annoying for the short segments, but that's about the worst of my gripes.

UV Digital Copy: Unlike the digital copies of old (which came with a unique key-code good for one download, set to either Window Media Player or iTunes), TDKR UV digital copy requires the user to sign up for two separate services: Flixster and UltraViolet.  Users are given the option of creating both account at once using the same information.  The downside is that the users MUST use Flixster, as computer program (Windows 7 laptop, for me) or mobile device app (iPod Touch 4G), to download and watch the movie, and it cannot be integrated with any other media players, such as WMP, iTunes, and any other movie-streaming services currently on the web.  Flixster's video player, besides being really basic, DOES freeze once in a while, and the pause-and-return-later option is shaky at best.  For those of us used to iTunes' smoothness, this can be quite annoying.  And again, the hassle of having to register with two separate services and being forced to download and watch the movie using the provider's (admittedly unsophisticated and clumsy) Flixster program makes the UV digital download less than appetizing.  Furthermore, the UV copy is standard definition, and for all my efforts I have been unable to either stream or download HD version, which is another point against.

Last Thoughts: Overall, I liked this product.  My only major problem is with the digital copy.  I don't think that should even be a factor to bump up the pricing, given.",1355702400,2,3003,4.9226190476190474

I have a home theater, so I rarely go to movies and when ""The Dark Knight Rises"" became available, I was torn between buying and streaming. Fortunately, I decided to stream because this movie is not worth owning and here are two reasons why:

1) Poor quality audio. With all the special effects, you'd expect sounds to be exploding all around you, but not only were my surround speakers quiet, the dialog was either muffled or too loud. I could hardly understand Alfred, Batman mumbled many of his lines, and Bane's voice boomed way out of proportion.

2) The story was stupid. I realize these movies are adapted from comic books, but come on - there has to be some believability and logic. I won't go into details because, if you're reading this, you probably haven't seen the movie, but be prepared to both scratch and shake your head throughout.",1355702400,2,893,4.681528662420382

4427297,2,B004LWZWGK,"Come on Nolan ! I expected much more out of you. The batman in this movie is not coherent to the batman in the previous two, and specially the cartoon I grew up watching. As an example the batman in this movie *Spoilers ahead* gets beaten down in a fist fight with Bane. And later beats Bane, again in a fist showdown. Not the batman i know. The batman we grew up watching could take down the evil wonderwomen without laying a hand on her. Batman is known for his super smart brain and his ubber awesome gadgets. I am sorry but this movie was disappointing.

On a different note, the movie has tons of holes and devise plots. It just became silly after a while. Police officers trapped in the sewers but not even taking uniforms off(wow Gotham has some shit ass dedicated cops), and ready to fight all inspired on release(not a bit tired). USA, one of the strongest freaking country in the world believing a thug Bane on his whole stupid trigger with one of the citizen's monologue. No help for its greatest cities? Actually blocking it out? Just like that? Not even a small god damn negotiation? Might as well be pulling the triggers themselves.

Moreover, Bane's speeches were unbearably annoying. And incomparable to Joker in any dimension. I mean he is reading out Gordon's story on Harvey Dent, in his slow supposedly ""scary"" voice, and the people of Gotham are supposed to believe him? Just because he is reading a piece of paper, well that proves its veracity.

I understood why Ra's Al Ghul wanted to destroy Gotham. That made sense.  Ra's Al Ghul wanted to bring down all the filth in Gotham. Because in those times, Gotham was one of the dirties cities known to men. Ra's Al Ghul thought he would rid the world of evil by bringing down this god forsaken place. His daughter, on the other hand, just wanted to ""avenge"" him. In a time of peace, she wanted to bring chaos back, the same chaos Ra's Al Ghul fought against (in his own eyes). Nothing annoys me more than a purposeless villain.

How did Bruce travel from god knows where in the middle east to Gotham, and then actually snuck back in the city. If this was Batman begins, or The dark Knight, or the cartoons, I would answer the question myself. Because he is BATMAN ! But no, not for this one.

Because of the fact that this is one of the biggest Ultraviolet releases out there, I must make my feelings known.  I am not an unreasonable person, but Ultraviolet is making me that way.  First of all, everybody knows that this isn't supported by I-tunes.  I knew that beforehand.  However, if it played on my I-pod, all would be forgiven.  Well, that is not the case.  The version of I-pod touch I have is too outdated to download the app.  This is the process in a nutshell.  You have to subscribe to 2 services that being flixster and the other being ultraviolet.  Pretty tedious for just one movie.  They store it for you which essentially means that they own it and rent it to you.  In I-tunes, I own the product because it is essentially downloaded on my computer.  UV is in the cloud.  That's it.  No other options.  I'm starting to think that the backlash towards UV will essentially be it's downfall.  I believe that it was an experiment in the control of entertainment.  If they control it, they can essentially take your basic information and essentially make money by selling it to advertisers.  The only good that will come of this is that I know to never buy an ultraviolet copy as long as I am on this Earth.  That should save me money in the long run.",1355616000,9,1362,4.368

For example, Bain's mask served no apparent purpose.  If it was giving him oxygen, there certainly wasn't enough to last long.  Knock a couple pieces loose and he was weak.  What was the story with all the fluorescent lights in the prison?  It made it seem rather modern rather than some ancient facility. Why climb the rocks if you can get pulled up with the rope or tie a homemade grappling hook to it?

4427309,3,B004LWZWGK,"I bought this with high hopes for another Dark Knight. In some ways it delivered. The visuals were extraordinary and the soundtrack superb! Acting was all around good and all did well with the material handed them.

As a villain Bane was terrific. But the Batman himself lost much of his fire and Alfred lost all of his previous toughness. The substitute father, and even mentor, image that Michael Caine as Alfred supplied in the previous two films was replaced by a whiner.

I just finished watching for the second time and must say that it was better on the second viewing. I could actually read more into the characters on the second go round and the pacing of the story worked better. Yes, it was a long movie but that actually worked for it and not against it.

Those annoying aspect ratio shifts were back with a vengeance. I have a 2.35:1 screen and really prefer to watch movies in that aspect. When the shift to the 1.85:1 material occurs it drove the scene off the top and bottom of my screen..... VERY ANNOYING and did not add a thing to the presentation. I gave up trying to shift it around on the first viewing but on the second did shrink the picture each time.

All of the negative reviews based solely on the ""Ultra-Violet"" thing is a mystery to me.... They want to watch this kind of movie on a computer? Sorry, when I purchase a Blu-Ray the idea that there is a digital copy available is nice bonus but certainly not the main purchase point.

At that point the film becomes a jumble of implausible or unexplained subplots, which despite the movie's length, feel rushed.  The main plot lacks subtlety, and feels only tangentially connected to the character struggle.

My first instinct is to blame editing, which makes its awkwardness especially known in the action scenes, (shot of person, shot of action, shot of other person, shot of action.... WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?.  After thinking about it a bit, I just feel like they were trying to cram in too many angles (literally and figuratively).

4427316,3,B004LWZWGK,"I love the entire Batman series matter of fact he's my favorite comic book character. I liked Batman for the fact that he's a normal guy who knows the odds are always against him but he still carries on the battle anyway. Just about everything Batman does is about him overcoming and conquering something. What makes him work is that he's human with no super powers, no special abilities, he's just a normal trying to do something extraordinary and at times it takes away from his personal life and mostly he doesn't know who he is as a person and gets lost behind his mask as a protector of the city. In this film you don't really see any of those things that make Batman... well Batman. The movie starts out with him having Abandoned the City as a superhero and for what? This series is about the birth of Batman and him becoming a superhero. How is that possible with in movie 1 he establishes Batman, Movie 2 he is establishing his role and value in the city and movie 3 he has basically abandoned everything he did and stood for in movies 1&2.

""The Dark Knight Rises"" isn't exactly a fitting title for this movie, it's more like ""The Dark Night Falls"". You would assume that this movie would be about Batman once again rising over the villains and connecting deeper with his purpose of being a crime fighter. You really don't get that with this film it's more like the feeling of Rocky coming back from retirement for his last fight. This was actually a very depressing Batman film and there wasn't much about it that made him feel like a ""superhero"". Throughout the movie he is always one step behind the villain and seems to be in great distress. This isn't at all what Batman/Bruce Wayne are about. Batman is overly cautious about protecting his identity and his ""belongings"". You would never find his vehicles so easily and you would never just be able to walk into the Batcave like that. Hence why he goes to the trouble of secluding all his equipment in an isolated cave. It just seems highly unlikely that anyone would ever get their hands on any of his technology by such simple means. Of course that's all just part of the plot for the movie but the comic version of Batman isn't so naive.

What I'm really just trying to get at about the movie is that it's depressing because it always feels like Batman just wants to give up and not really be Batman anymore. The more he sees a challenge in the movie the less he wants to put on his cape. His girlfriend was killed and his 2 face was killed and now he's fallen into depression again although he became Batman because his loved ones were killed to begin with, it just really contradicts the first 2 movies. To see Batman defeated and not comeback even harder and even worse without a plan is just kind of sad. For example, When Batman takes a hit he usually goes back to the cave, heals, comes up with a plan, and takes it to action to defeat his foe. In this movie THAT NEVER HAPPENS! He never actually follows what Batman would do. For example in Batman Vs. The Predator (great comic book btw) Batman is literally almost beaten to death by the Predator. He has absolutely no chance against him and barely escapes with his life. While Batman is healing he puts his mind to work and starts to figure out a way to beat the Predator so he designs the unbelievable suit of Bat armor that puts him on the same level as the Predator and gives him a fighting chance. THAT is how Batman should play out. If he loses a battle he uses his logic and abilities to figure out a way to win or at least increase the odds. There is absolutely none of that in the film and the ending plays out on a note that is very unBatman like.

For a majority portion of the movie you hardly see Batman at all. He's maybe in it for about 45 minutes total out of the almost 3 hours of this movie. This movie mostly stars the supporting actors and the Batman makes his appearance. There is Catwoman in this film but this version I don't know. Michelle Pfeiffer's version was Purrrffffeccct and probably would have been a better fit in this movie as her character in Batman Returns was already Dark and seductive. The new Catwoman kind of seemed over the top and cartoonish plus I don't remember her ever calling herself ""Catwoman"". The actor that played her wasn't seductive and alluring enough to really pull you into her character and therefore it didn't make sense to see Batman falling for her. In the Batman Returns it makes sense because she is mysterious and seductive to Batman and they have an odd romantic chemistry and that's exactly how their romantic story is. They work as a couple because she's just as weird as he is. In this movie you never see that chemistry.

But getting back to the movie it's just really depressing and not a very uplifting Super Hero movie. I was actually hoping at some point maybe Wonder Woman or Superman or maybe all the Justice league would come in and help him. Batman just seemed so lonely and depressed in the film it made you feel depressed watching him, and that's pretty much how I felt about it.

3/5 for a good but movie but not a good super hero movie. I'm kind of disappointed the trilogy ended this way as 1&2 were completely amazing beyond belief.",1355529600,6,5239,4.413650465356773

4427320,1,B004LWZWGK,"As I suffered through this movie (thanks to someone else in the house wanting to watch it) I tried to put my finger on why it wasn't working for me.

Batman came across so weak. The first part of the movie is nothing but talking and debating about whether or not he should return as Batman while various incidents are happening in Gotham. This was very boring. Then after a fight with the villain where he loses easily he spends another good portion of the movie stuck in a prison. So it wasn't until the last fifteen percent that he sort of showed he could fight back.

The other problem is that Batman came across so one-dimensional it was hard to care about him. He lacked emotion, other than being cranky about everything. Then there is continual death, destruction, violence and misery without let up. Oh yes, and torture. I just don't enjoy watching helpless people be tortured and even Batman was helpless on several occasions. Because of the dark nature of this movie, everyone is sad and miserable all the time. It's all very grim and insanely serious. Whatever happened to some comic relief? Basically, they have turned Batman into a horror movie because the villains are similar to the types you see in horror movies. At least Batman managed to save everyone in the end...but of course we all know in the end that's what is going to have to happen.

There is a detective (Robin) who I liked more than Batman simply because he was actually doing something. Then there was a ""Cat"" woman who was interesting for being unpredictable. The little twist at the end suggested another sequel. *sigh* I only wish that movie goers would stop supporting these reboots and go for something new and good...rather than familiar and boring.",1355529600,9,1735,4.6819672131147545

He then steals a nuclear fusion reactor core, cut Gotham off from the world and lets chaos run rampant. Batman was no match for Bane, and he has been thrown into a prison in a far away land. To save Gotham, Bruce must escape from the prison, dispose of the nuclear bomb, defeat Bane and come to terms with his own insecurities. He isn't alone.

This is a great sequel. All of the actors do a great job. There is considerably less action in this movie than the previous 2. Much of this film is focused on Bruce Wayne's depression, despair, and fragile mental state. Bane is a great villain, but Catwoman isn't very cat-like, and seemed a bit superfluous in the story.

4427327,3,B004LWZWGK,"The Dark Knight Rises was the epic conclusion to Nolan's Batman Franchise. As a fan and owner of the first two movies on special edition DVD's, i couldn't hesitate when this limited edition came out which boasts of its Blu Ray \ DVD combo with Ultraviolet Digital copy.

I got my package - Limited Edition 25,413 of 35,000 and opened it up. In the set I received 3 Discs.
First - The Dark Knight Rises - DVD Disc
Second - The Dark Knight Rises - Special Features Disc
Third - The Dark Knight Rises - Special Features Disc.

Yup. Its not a typo error. I actually received two special features discs instead of the Blu Ray copy. Apart from the limited edition packaging of this set, i was looking forward to having Batman on Blu Ray, but this isn't an option.

The Ultraviolet ""Digital Copy"" - As others would have already mentioned, this is in no way a Digital Copy. Its just a code to online storage of TDKR. You are unable to download your copy and use it through iTunes. I am an avid movie collector and a lot of the movies i order here on amazon, i look forward to the digital copies. This ultraviolet version is not worth it and in my opinion it could never replace a physical digital copy.

It is with the missing Blu Ray disc and the Lack of Digital Copy that i give this package just 3 stars.",1355529600,,1299,4.2682926829268295

If I wasn't a Batman fan before seeing this one, I would be afterwards.  And as a fan of Batman, and film in general, it IS a great way to send the story out.",1355529600,4,476,4.266666666666667

It's also semi ridiculous when Batman speaks, with his electronically altered voice.  The was a well done plot twist, which is great when you don't see it coming through the whole movie.

4427333,3,B004LWZWGK,"The Dark Knight Rises is the 3rd and final film in the ""Dark Knight Trilogy."" It ties up all the loose ends quite nicely but like the 2008 effort, it runs too long. Great things about this film are the narrative, the characters, the appearance of the bat cave and Tom Hardy's performance as Bane. That's it! The rest falls flat.

This film is best described as an exercise in self-indulgence. Christopher Nolan fans have worshipped the man for years, exalting his modus operandi of gritty self-seriousness and faux gravitas without providing Nolan with the constructive criticism that he needs to grow and mature as a filmmaker. Due to the overzealous praise, Nolan's movies have been growing increasingly overlong and ponderous, and his ego has now reached critical mass with this third Batman adventure. Thus, instead of working to improve his directorial technique, Nolan stuck by his usual filmmaking chestnuts here, hoping to get away with bad pacing and pedestrian action scenes by smothering everything in relentless dramatic music and over-complicating a simple narrative to make people believe they're smart for understanding it. This is not to imply that The Dark Knight Rises is a terrible movie, however - it's just a severely flawed, tediously long-winded effort in need of discipline. While probably polished enough to satiate devoted fans, The Dark Knight Rises suffers from significant narrative and pacing issues.",1355529600,,1430,5.217391304347826

Some may not understand the story line, but you have to remember that TDKR is set in the future from TDK.  Also, if folks are thinking of this series as lighthearted like the series that started with Michael Keaton in '89, you are mistaken. Even in watching Justice League cartoons, you see a dark side of Batman.  That is where Nolan takes us, to the darker, intense side of Batman.

Its very sad when you have everything in front of you and still manage to foul up the batman legend. He should have stuck with the Momento-like genre. Its like he was out of ideas and he just put a bunch of drama together with filler and three scences of action. Christian bales batman wanna be was very disappointing as well. I would just watch the dark knight movie and skip the other two.  I was more afraid of the joker then Bane and it shouldnt be that way. And don't even get me started on Anne hathaways Catwoman.  Maybe Christopher Nolan should have put more of his heart into the movie instead of just trying to fill his pockets.

1) should have shot it in 3D, this was a great opportunity and it's a shame it was missed. 2) Talia was not like she was in the comics that I have read. 3) I think we should have seen a little bit more of ""Robin"" as he discovers the Bat Cave... 4) There have been no definite plans announced for a sequel, however, I think there are important clues in the film that there COULD be one...the Bat Signal has been repaired; Robin has quit the police force, fed up with the restrictions imposed by the ""law"", and found the Bat Cave; Its very possible to foresee a sequel or spin off with Robin becoming the ""new"" Batman, or perhaps Nightwing...and with his connection with orphans and the orphanage now nearby, perhaps a sidekick could end up helping him fight crime. Given, its pretty obvious they would need training to effectively operate, perhaps Bruce would return to mentor him, or perhaps he would find someone else capable of training him...all in all, a great movie, and I would definitely recommend this to everyone.",1355443200,,1260,4.604444444444445

Batman(Christian Bale) and Catwoman(Anne Hathaway) have to stop Bane(Tom Hardy) from destroying Gotham City with a nuclear weapon. Batman, Jim Gordon and Gotham City are still suffering from the damage The Joker caused in The Dark Knight(2008). The tone of The Dark Knight Rises is dark and depressing, but the pacing is very fast. The film borrows story material from the Knightfall comic book. Hans Zimmer composed a loud, tribal, energetic music score for the film. The action scenes are thrilling. Batman uses an aircraft called ""The Bat"". People complained about Bane's ""garbled, Sean Connery voice"".
The terrorist attack at the football game felt like Two Minute Warning(1976) or Black Sunday(1977). There's a sight gag with a football player turning his head to see a giant hole in the stadium. There was the real life, tragic, midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises in the Summer of 2012. Several people were killed and dozens more were injured by a gunman. These innocent people were just trying to watch a Batman movie. Officer Blake is one of the more heroic and humane characters in the story. Anne Hathaway was very good as Catwoman.

Update: To more specific: the movie was boring and barely kept my attention. I wanted to cut it off after the first 45 minutes. The villain was not very interesting to me either and the mask with him talking through it sounded odd and I never got used to it at all. Didn't care for Anne Hathaway's character either. Stereotypical character - clever girl who can kick ass and doesn't know which side she's on, yeah, I've seen it before. Christian Bale, still looks good but that's about all he did in here: look good. I had to ask my co-worker who enjoyed this movie (she saw it twice!) what she liked about it. She was deeply moved at the end, the part on the bridge was mentioned but she did admit the story was lackluster.

4427377,4,B004LWZWGK,"Warner Bros Home Entertainment brings ""The Dark Knight Rises"" home for the holidays. I can honestly say that the epic last chapter in Christopher Nolan's trilogy loses nothing in a home viewing environment. It moves along quicker than I remember when seeing it in the theater. That says a lot since I saw it three times before watching it again on Blu-ray.

""The Dark Knight Rises"" closes out the series with Batman making a return to Gotham City after years of silence. The hero disappeared after being blamed for the death of Harvey Dent. The arrival of a deadly new villain calling himself Bane draws the Caped Crusader out of hiding. Batman joins forces with a criminal named Catwoman and the police department to bring Bane and his band of militant thugs down and save Gotham City from nuclear destruction.

Christopher Nolan, his brother Jonathan, and David S. Goyer crafted one of the most ambitious conclusions to a film series ever witnessed on the silver screen. Everything about ""The Dark Knight Rises"" satisfied my expectations. Things I thought I would have a problem with I ended up accepting happily. I can't think of a better way for ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy to come to an end.

The audio and video quality for ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is spectacular. The high-definition picture is clean without losing any of its cinematic splendor. The 5.1 surround sound delivers all the bangs, breathing, and pummeling punches intensely. Hans Zimmer's incredible musical score blends triumphantly with the dialogue and adds a whole other level of emotion to the film.

Over three hours of special features will keep Batman fans busy after taking in the movie. There's twelve production featurettes that cover everything from the Batcave to Gotham's underground and Wall Street. Three character featurettes focus on Bruce Wayne, Bane, and Selina Kyle.

Bane was ridiculously bad. The whole prison part of the story made no sense. The authorities response to the major portion of the plot made no sense. The interactions between Bruce Wayne and the rest of the characters made no sense. Only one of the surprises had any surprise in it at all and the reveal was pointless and badly written.

Right in the middle, Miranda Tate is in two different spots at once (with Bane and with Morgan Freeman). Then at the end after the ""Bat"" had been vaporized by a nuclear bomb, it somehow ended up on a roof again with Lucius Fox examining it. Could have been another Bat, but we were never shown more than one. The thing I really liked about the first two Nolan Batman films was that as fantastical as they were, they maintained a level of believability. The story was tight with few holes. This one just ignored feasibility and time way too much. That being said, even if it was a 1-star movie it would be worth watching once just for Anne Hathaway.",1355356800,,808,4.466216216216216

Should have Preorderd on the same day,but had to wait for money to transfer,might have gotten under 5000.
This is one of those collectors items that will forever be of growing value, because of the limited amount of only 35,000 in circulation and most of them being oppend everyday,on christmas most of them will be opend. I predict another price increase after the 25th. The original price was $35 and sold out after about 2 weeks. It is now being resold for between $250 (Used) and $350 (Collectible) since the release date. This is the ultimate DKRises bluray collection. Well at-least until a Special Edition Dark Knight Trilogy Nolan boxset is released. But the value of this Limited Edition will grow in worth everyday until the end of the world. Hopefully not 21/12/2012.
To add, this is a beautiful boxset that presents well and looks like really good quality.

I want to give it 6 stars but there is no option.
If you didn't get it for $35 and can get an unused one for $300, then you should get it before it becomes $400 or more.

4427403,3,B004LWZWGK,"I re-watched the first two movies after I saw this one.  The first was something we just hadn't seen in live movie form before, taking us back to the Keaton-type portrayal and delivery, but adding so much more with the early story -- we were blown away and craving more.

Then the second one hit us, and I have now watched it more than 7 times (loser!) and it still gives me chills.  The story is one of the best of all time, and the characters (all of them, it seems) rise to the occasion.  You can almost find yourself rooting for the Joker at times, or understanding his perspective at the very least, and Harvey's ""fall"" is like ancient Greek drama brought to our modern way of understanding.  Amazing movie, easily one of the best ever.

Then I saw the third and 'final' chapter, and with all due respect, I walked away feeling like it was a real disappointment.  I mean, taken on its own merits, it was an okay action flick (at times), but the story itself was just so-so and seemed very drawn out.  There were moments where I actually found myself thinking, when is this going to get ""somewhere"", let alone to the finale?  It had its moments, but they were few and far between, and the film never came close to making me feel the raw energy and emotion (and thought-provoking scenes and speeches) of the second film.  I dunno, maybe the second film just cast too big a shadow, because the third film really seemed kind of cookie-cutter in places.  Sorry, that's just how I feel -- but you'd still want to see it at least once if you loved the series so far.  I just wouldn't buy it to own...",1355356800,,1598,4.343434343434343

I went to the theatres right when the movie premiere and I was so excited. The movie is good, there are moments where you will be shock and amazed.
 For me what ruin the movie a bit was almost all the scenes and the interaction between the characters was rushed. You barely see Batman fight in hand to hand combat in the movie. He spends the majority of his time in some type of vechicle and you barely see him in the movie too because the main focus is on Bane.
 When it comes to Alfred I always thought of him as someone who would stand by Bruce's side no matter what. Not in this movie though.
 They didn't need a romantic interest, Rachel already filled that spot and now that she's dead there's no purpose for Bruce to suddenly fall in love with someone in one day i.e. Talia.
 I wanted the movie to end with Batman saving the day and being recognize as a hero to Gotham (being alive) and him standing on top of a tall building watching over the city. Batman does saved the day and he is seen as a hero to Gotham but he has to fake his death in order to do that and that sucks.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt, then this film is for you. if you want a long drawn-out bad plot that keeps you wondering when the real film will begin and let you out of the hell whole your sitting through of all 165 min, then this film is for you.

I can't believe I waited for this film and then sat for 2 hours and 45 minutes of nothing but shallow characters (save for the actors mentioned above). this isn't a sequel, it's a curse! For anyone with half a mind that has not spent their life dedicated to video games and are so desensitized to anything save things blowing up, yes this film is a curse.

Like being a superhero is some awful, depressing and never worth it? Really?!??? Since when is fighting evil a bad thing???? Even Christian Bale seems depressed and forced through the whole thing.

Best part? the villain! While I could guess nearly every line in the movie (BAD writing to say the least), the mask had the only good lines in the entire thing.

Angst ridden, three hours of wandering that make you think Batman coming back is a immoral decision and under-utilizing the huge potential of catwoman, and you have yourself a bunch of hollywood drivel. Not only that, but the plot is so reminiscent of the second Batman that it just makes you scratch your head. What I'd like to know is why they spent the first two hours on a single week in time, and the last half hour trying to demonstrate six months... and injuries that are flat out unbelievable (right, a broken back can be fixed by hitting it), that the whole thing is just miserable. They were miserable making it and it shows... except for the villain. You don't want him to die. But all the plot twists? We figured them out in the first 20 mins.

Get this, Batman becomes brokendown weak minded OLDMAN in this movie. Why even call this movie Batman? You only see him 20% of the time.  I couldn't believe some of the bad acting. Few wellknown actors, just not convincing and were miscast to begin with. It was like I was watching a TV drama cop show. I found myself bored within  first hour.

4427412,5,B004LWZWGK,"I really enjoyed this film.  I saw it in the theater after it was first released but waited to review it here until I got and watched the Blu-Ray, like you're supposed to.  (This section is for product reviews, not movie reviews)

To me, Christopher Nolan's Batman films are the best.  Tim Burton's Batman showed us that comic movies could be serious, but then the series went downhill in the sequels.  Nolan took us back to the beginning in Batman Begins, gave us a nice middle with The Dark Knight, and ends things nicely with this film.  The story is very good, it tells the tale of an aging Bruce Wayne living with the physical and mental consequences of his life as Batman in a city where Batman is no longer necessary.  However, that all changes when Bane comes to town and then Bruce must once more put on the bat suit and face the one enemy who is at least his physical match, if not more. The acting is great, what you expect from the actors involved.  The characters are believable and the film has a very realistic look to it because most of it is real.  Unlike a lot of movies being made today, this film uses CGI only when there's no other way to make something happen.  However, 90 to 95 percent of what you see is stuff that they actually filmed.  To me, that makes the film even better.

The Blu-Ray is a very nice product.  The film is in the highest quality and is on its own disc.  The only thing I don't like is that, when you hit stop, you can't resume the film.  Also, there is no bookmark function.  So, if you turn off your player, you lose where you are in the film.  The film also has long chapters, there are only 17 chapter on a 2 hour 44 minute film.  I expected more from a 2012 Blu-Ray.  But, those are my only complaints and they're minor.  The special features disc is nice, there are a lot of good things on there.  I especially like the documentary on the Batmobiles.  The DVD copy was unnecessary to me.  I'm single, I have 1 TV and I have my Blu-Ray player hooked up to it, so there's no point in me ever watching the DVD.  But, I couldn't buy the Blu-Ray without it.  So, I gave the DVD to my parents.  They enjoyed it and now don't have to buy the DVD, so that worked out nicely for everyone except Warner Brothers.",1355270400,,2254,4.207943925233645
4427413,3,B004LWZWGK,"I don't understand why this series is so popular. The story plods, Bale's portrayal of Batman is really sub-par, and, for such a cheesefest, this movie really acts much more important that it really is. I'd like to say save your money for a better movie but this is pretty standard fare now. Had the studio decided to leave Batman out of this movie and focus on the Robin and Catwoman characters, both of which are woefully neglected in this movie, this probably could have been an interesting movie.",1355270400,,500,4.629213483146067
4427414,5,B004LWZWGK,"I could not wait for this movie to be released on blu ray/dvd, since I was a big fan of 'Batman Begins' and especially 'The Dark Knight' so I did not know if they could really top 'The Dark Knight', and I wasn't expecting them to, and they did not, BUT don't let that deter from this excellent finale, because this film is really really good, and I was not let down at all, infact, this is my 2nd favorite in the series, falling right behind the mighty 'The Dark Knight'.

Now I don't want to play spoiler for people who haven't seen it yet, but I will comment on the cast and crew, now at first when I heard Anne Hathaway would play 'Catwoman' I wasn't sure that this was the role for her, but man oh man, did she surprise me, she plays the part like she should have, because Catwoman should be sleek and sexy, and sassy, and she sure is, this could be the role that propells her to better film roles in the future, she has the ability, Tom Hardy as Batmans nemesis 'Bane' and he really shines, he looks menacing, and the tone of his voice is just perfect, dark and fits the role to a T, and I was delighted to see Joseph Gordon-Levitt, as I've come to think of him as an excellent character actor, 'Inception' really made me take notice of him, and him and Christopher Nolan seem to work well off each other, and of course Gary Oldman returns as Jim Gordon, and I always thought he did a great job with this role, normally he'd play the bad guy, which he's very good at as well, but this role is perfect for him, and of course you have good ole Morgan Freeman as Lucious Fox, and watching Morgan Freeman act just never gets old, and the old man still has it, and to my delight, Cillian Murphy reprises his role as 'Scarecrow' and although he's not in it much, but I really like this guy, after first seeing him in 'Batman Begins' and then 'Inception' another excellent character actor, so that should tell you the acting in this movie is superb, and everyone knows Christian Bale is just phenomenal as Batman, and that does not change this time around either, you can tell he loved playing this role.

And of course the masterful Christopher Nolan does another fantastic job directing this epic, he has made it into my list of favorite directors with this series and 'Inception', and I like that he keeps his movies serious and not filled with stupid comedy like a lot of movies today, he keeps it serious and dark, and he really knows how to get the best out of his cast and crew.

And boy does this movie look fantastic on blu ray, especially the shots of Gotham City, just like 'The Dark Knight', the buildings and skyscrapers just jump off the screen, the extras are a BIT lacking, but you do get an excellent documentary about the history of the mighty Batmobile, and you get an in depth making of too, and it's really good, I'm sure this will be re-released eventually with more extras, because I think they are planning on releasing a new box set next year, so I'm sure we'll have some new extras with that, but this will definetly do for now.

Excellent movie, excellent end to the series, did not disappoint, and I'm really fussy.",1355270400,,3141,4.336734693877551

So breath in the Batfart Gotham - you've earned it.

This movie was almost as good as ""Steel"". However you might say Shaq's acting was superb in comparison.

This movie was only slightly better than - Nope. Can't think of a worse movie.

Compared to this movie ""Son of mask"" kicked ass. Even John Ritter was a better Hero @ Large.

Well come to find out when I got home and opened it up I had 2 special feature disks and an inferior DVD copy of the movie. I know this is a WB issue and not an amazon issue and it is not just occurring in the special box edition either as it has occurred in the Dark Knight Trilogy Blu0Ray set as well. It seems that WB has really dropped the ball on product and control in what ever stamping factory outside of the US they are using. I refuse to send back this edition on the grounds that there are no more available and I would not be receiving a proper replacement as only 35,000 of these exist. I'm going to try my hand at contacting WB on this issue and will upgrade my rating if it all goes through with no issues but at this time I cannot under any circumstance give this the proper rating it would deserve if the issue had not arisen.

Update:
I was successful in getting a reply back from WB and they will take of any issues involving double special feature disks by sending you a pre paid envelope to return the extra disk back in with and then they will send you the blu-ray when they receive the extra disk. I have just received the email confirming that they saw my request and I gave the needed info to receive the return label so once I finally get the disk I will give this product the five stars it deserves but until then it will recieve only 3  stars.",1355270400,,1545,4.1466666666666665

That's not to say there weren't a few issues.
1. Why didn't Batman use any of his gadgets in his fight against Bane.
2. The pit hardly seemed like hell on earth. The prison from the fist movie seemed a worse one.
3. The clock on the time bomb. Why do movies always like to put the timer on a bomb at an unrealisticly low counter. (An hour to go after the final confrontation with Bane would have been much more believable than 10 minutes.)

BTW, Anne Hathaway is great as Catwoman (though she never goes by that name in the movie) bringing up memories of actress Julie Newmar's Catwoman.",1355270400,,711,4.298507462686567

I don't need to talk about the movie here which was to me great and they could not do more than that to end the trilogy.

4427458,2,B004LWZWGK,"I loved the first two movies in the Nolan Batman Trilogy, but this one is just plain horrible in my opinion (2hrs & 45min of horrible). I read the comics when I was younger, and loved the dark overtone of Frank Miller's Bat-Man. That being said, I always thought that Bane was a poorly conceived character, definitely not worthy of being Bat-Man's ""Final Foe"". The movie version is no better, silly-looking muscle-guy with a Vader respirator. I couldn't even understand what he was saying half the time (Amazon really needs to offer subtitles). Anne Hathaway as Catwoman, seriously? When I first heard that she got the part, i was as shocked as when I discovered that Heath Ledger was gonna play the Joker (I never imagined he would do such a great job, so I gave her the benefit of the doubt). Sadly though, Anne portrays as horrible a Catwoman as Halley Berry, and she and the director obviously new nothing about the character either (she didn't even have a cat at her home). The part of Nightwing, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt is the one that delivers a solid performance this time around. The story is poorly adapted for the screen, and wasn't that great to begin with. Definitely one of the worst finales for a great trilogy.",1355184000,,1233,4.660550458715596
4427459,3,B004LWZWGK,"I have been a Batman fan since I was seven.  Loved the comics; loved the Warner TV Version.  The resurgence that began with the 1985 Frank Miller ""Dark Knight"" was right on-target for me, as I had just begun a comics & collectibles store in St. Louis.

When the 1989 ""Batman"" feature hit the screens it was a ""whole new world"" for Batmania...and the first film turned out pretty cool.  So did ""Batman Forever"", and, ""The Dark Knight"" & ""Batman Begins"".

BUT, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" does not have a solid script, is cluttered with too many characters, AND, is w-a-y too long ! About 20 minutes too long !!

After awhile, what started out as exciting action, turned into a boring slam-bang bunch of repeated mayhem...mostly gratuitous

PLUS, Tom Hardy, as ""Bane"" is a formidable foe...but Batman had tangled with him earlier in ""Batman & Robin""...and that link should have been made for continuity.  Also, Hardy sounded like he was doing a ""poor man's version"" of a Sean Connery accent  most of the time.

Who stole the show ?  Anne Hathaway was a spectacular, sexy, perfect ""Catwoman"".  Loved her in this.  And, Joseph Gordon Levitt's role of ""John Blake"" is a far cry from his work on ""The 3rd Rock From The Sun""...he's turned into a solid, excellent performer.

Lets make it so extreme, so hopeless, such overwhelming odds... it takes away from the movie and the characters. Its not the best Batman movie and not even the best super hero movie this year - Avengers was a better movie because it was more interesting.

4427463,5,B004LWZWGK,"Nolan did an outstanding job with his Batman trilogy. The way he showed the darker side of sacrificing ones self for the greater good was incredible. You truly begin to wonder if everything Bruce sacrificed was for the best. Tom Hardy's potrayal of Bane was nothing short of incredible. You can see the raw power he possesses. You feel truly terrified at the control he has over his underlings and the intelligence behind the mask. There are definitely certain lines that make you shudder and fear Batman is truly lost against this adversary. I enjoyed the way Batman was portrayed as never really being a match for Bane. Even when he returns to Gotham, he only momentarily injures Bane, simply to watch Bane rise again and be ready for more. Also the story line depicting how Robin transitions from Cop to caped crusader is brilliant.

The second movie was awesome, although Batman seemed to take a bit of a backseat to the Joker, a performance that deserves to be legendary.  So I was a little leery of a third movie.  How could they possibly match the quality of the prior two?  Well - kudos to Chris Nolan and the huge number of people who made this triquel (i just made that up) the BEST of the three, while tying into the previous two movies.  There is much about this film that makes it timely and relevant, and I'll be up front, i found it incredibly moving as well as entertaining.

They certainly left plenty of room for yet another movie, and if they keep up this quality, I will be in the front row.  As it was, I didn't even know it was out until after it was released to video so I just bought the blu-ray trilogy, hoping I would like it.

This is a thinking person's batman, with plenty of action to boot.  It has depth and breadth.  If you have a brain and enjoyed the prior two, I cannot recommend this movie enough.  I'd give it ten stars if I could.",1355184000,,1199,4.2844444444444445
4427471,1,B004LWZWGK,"Here there be spoilers. Dark Knight Rises: too vehicletastic. He drives a batcycle, he flies a batcopter -- the real Batman is just a man, a man with hermetic assassin training and a utility belt, but a man. When Batman has to use his batcopter to haul a neutron bomb out ""over the bay"" away from the city I feel like I'm watching a James Bond movie, not Batman. Batman is a detective. He uses his wits to catch these guys, not his expensive toys. This Batman farmed all his detecting out to Alfred. This Batman couldn't even figure out that Miranda Tate was not all she seemed! Never trust a French chanteuse. Who haunted the dreams of that boiled owl in Inception. I'll meet halfway on suspension of disbelief. That's why I'm in the theatre. But the halfway part . . . If you don't show up at the meeting place, and I have to go across town and over to your house, and you don't answer the door, and I let myself in and there's some Hans Zimmer on the stereo and the bathroom window's open and you've written in steam on the mirror SCREW YOU . . . I don't know. Okay, so Bane broke Batman's back and had him shipped out to the Moorish prison hole of his past. But when a helpful fellow prisoner explains ""You won't be able to move until I fix your back . . . Your vertebra is sticking out . . ."" and punches it back into place . . . leading to a complete recovery . . . again, I don't know.

Nolan seems to have trouble structuring his stories. Toward the end of a long film is not where one wants a protagonist defeat-imprisonment-recovery-escape sequence. If you've gotta have that, it could come at the end of act one. Or, heaven forbid, defeat-imprisonment at the end of the film, and recovery-escape at the top of Dark Knight Rises: The Final Chapter. (Inception, too, seemed to stumble about like a drunk in the video store.) Don't like Anne Hathaway and don't like Catwoman's mood-killing postmodern quips. Get Eartha Kitt to do it digitally like Brando in Superman Returns. In three of these Nolan Batmans there's never been a decent female character for Batman to play off of. The vanishing Katie Holmes, the game Maggie Gyllenhaal -- he just didn't write anything for em to do. I must not have been completely under the spell of the film, because when the batcopter, on its way out to the bay, hoists that bomb over a school bus full of orphans (and the bland Joseph Gordon-Levitt) I was thinking ""How great would it be if that bomb slammed into that bus like a wrecking ball?"" Sadly, it was not to be.

The movie lurched up to the brink of an interesting idea -- what if Batman lost all his money -- and then wobbled away in some other narrative precession. Rather than showing us Batman surviving on his own, defeating Bane without his pricey hardware -- the real Batman -- Nolan hurriedly got him back into the copter. I would have liked to have seen that other movie, with broke street Batman. I guess since losing his parents Bruce Wayne has used his money to insulate himself, with the suit, the copter -- but that would be a theme for a movie with something on its mind. Dark Knight Rises feints toward political content, but merely uses the motif of class uprising as another exotic/gritty backdrop in a bloated action movie. The film is uninterested in exploring any of the questions it raises. Hell, it's uninterested in raising any questions. Of course this is the director who made a 148 minute film about dreams without a single memorable image or surreal moment. (It only felt like 192 minutes). In fact in Nolan's career I can remember exactly one image: Carrie Ann Moss' look of absolute evil, sitting in the car toward the end of Memento.",1355184000,11,3667,4.447251114413076

I have viewed a few one star movies such as Die Darkman Die and I find it hard to believe that DKR would rate a one star from anyone. Considering each movie in The Dark Knight Trilogy on its own merit I would  give a Three and a half for Batman Begins, a solid Four and a half for The Dark Knight due inpart for the strong acting perfomance by Heath Ledger as The Joker. The Dark Knight Rises concluded the the trilogy with what I believe to be the best of the three due to its storytelling. After The Dark Knight movie I thought  how can the next movie top this one. I'm not sure yet whether it did or not but it was a solid and fast moving story that did not seem to be two hours and forty five minutes in length.

4427525,2,B004LWZWGK,"Left with the impression that I missed something in the midnight screening of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" after rave reviews from critics and die hards opposed my initial thoughts, I knew I would have to watch it again to form a solid opinion. Then the movie theater massacre happened in Colorado and my second viewing got post-poned... indefinitely.

After a Black Friday shopping spree led to the purchase of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" DVD for $13, my chance arrived yet again. And yet again, I've been let down. ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" like ""Spider-Man 3,"" is a trilogy clunker that coasts on the belief that bigger is better.

The problems are still there, two viewings in: Christopher Nolan expands the cast to include characters that are too quickly introduced and too focused on for us to care. Peter Foley (played by weakest link, Matthew Modine), Miranda Tate (the ""written strictly for the third act character"" played by Marion Cotillard), and John Blake (a Joseph Gordon-Levitt, whose assumption that Bruce Wayne is Batman is so ludicrous it lingers for the remaining two hours and causes us to wonder if he knows that Batman is actually Christian Bale) are generally unwelcomed additions to a story that's thinner than what its weaver hopes we think it isn't. This is ""Batman Begins"" all over again, only it attempts a loftier reach for epicness that inadvertently causes it to be the most cartoonish in Nolan's desperate-to-be- realistic franchise.

The only new character given justice is Selina Kyle, who, as played by Anne Hathaway, is too underused for how good she is.

Even at 165 minutes, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" feels like a rushed effort. Scenes transition into others like a contestant at a hot dog eating contest waits to digest his next wiener. The pacing is fast, but the result is not edge-of-your-seat inducing. It's messy. And rarely anything more.

On top of the bloated pretentiousness, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" sound-editing is atrocious. Between Howard Shore's score and Bane's Sean Connery impersonation, the mute dialogue featured in ""The Artist"" resounds as more audible. Not only does ""Rises"" adopt the motif that bigger is better, but also louder, and it's all to its disadvantage.

As the conclusion to a trilogy, ""Rises"" should have been more intimate than special-effects ridden. Scenes showing ""The Bat"" dodging missiles lack suspense, compared to the ones wherein Bruce Wayne encounters Selina Kyle at a charity ball. And while the level of talent involved cannot be denied, their use can. I thought ""The Dark Knight"" was a comic book masterpiece and I think a lot of others are confusing its affiliation with this picture to mean the same. Not so. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is smoke and mirrors. A motion picture that deserved better from the expectations set by its own creator.

The injury subplot in the beginning seems crafted out of thin air just to have something that Bruce has to fight to overcome. The villains, too, seem much less alive and fleshed-out than previous installments, even if you disregard Ledger's performance of The Joker.

4427536,4,B004LWZWGK,"movie from fitting in a narrowly defined ""EPIC"" movie category.  From the perspectives of movie length and quest The Dark Knight Rises approaches epic proportions.  If some folks consider the movie Godfather to be an epic, then I would be less reluctant to include the Dark Knight into that realm.
The story line is rich with good vs. evil, human guilt and regret, sacrifice for the common good, greed, revenge, hope, loyalty, betrayal, hate, forgiveness, and love.  Yes people, Batman may have found a new love interest brief as it may have been.  Anne Hathaway plays Selina the cat burglar and clearly has the Batman's attention throughout the movie.  Wow, have you seen Ann Hathaway in the tight black leather or latex (I couldn't tell which) cat outfit.  Hope they make a pin up calendar of Selina.
The well named Bane as can be surmised is the ""HEAVY"" played by Tom Hardy.  When did Tom bulk up and morph into a entrant for Wrestlemania compared to his earlier years PR photos?  Yes people, he beats the hell out of Batman.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays officer John Blake.  We discover that John Blake and Batman attended the same orphanage.  Some of Batman's private emotions and outlook are revealed by John's ""5 cent Lucy"" pyschological profile.  John promotes from a patrolman blue uniform to an ill fitting detective suit in the movie.  Perhaps the director Nolan is telling us that John is suited for better things in the movie.
Christian Bale yet again is a terrific Batman.  A bit more human with aches and pains afflicting everyday humans and not comic book heros.  Did I mention Selina's outfit.....  After several years withdrawal from society, Batman emerges to confront Bane and his threatening destruction of Gotham.  Batman is heroic throughout, fearless against hopeless odds, fearless against pain, forgiving to those who betray him, and self sacrificing for Gotham.
Solid entertainment and worth the ticket price ....and at risk of reading too much into the movie, that we mortal humans can do better and rise beyond ourselves and self interests.",1355097600,,2068,4.947826086956522

4427538,5,B004LWZWGK,This was the best Batman series to date with lots of action and interesting twists.  Hard to tell who was the real villain.  Liked the ending.,1355097600,,142,4.423076923076923
4427539,5,B004LWZWGK,"How I rank it, it's better than Batman Begins  but not as amazing as The Dark Knight (but close). However, this is the best ending to a trilogy I think I have ever witnessed in my entire life. What a wonderful movie this is, I saw it 5 times and counting. I will admit I was iffy on how i felt the first time I saw it but after more views I grew to appreciate it. While it doesn't have the perfection that the flawless Dark Knight has, it still suffices and is one of the most powerful films I think I have seen recently. It has such a great ending, very emotional.

I am going to make this review short because I do not want to tell too much, it's a movie that I would never forgive myself if I provided any spoilers. First off, the movie does begin 8 years after the Dark Knight, Batman has been a fugitive and therefore missing. Bruce Wayne is beaten up and can barely walk because of all the beatings he took as Batman. He then learns of a man named Bane who is plotting to terrorize Gotham, one of the things that pushes him to put on the Batsuit again. In the film it's about him rising from his fall. I am not giving anymore details on the plot because again, I am not giving you, the reader any spoilers. I can't do it, it's simply the movie that needs to be witnessed and experienced. The movie is intense, Bane is a frightening villain, probably the scariest villain I have seen on the screen. He gave me chills throughout, he unlike, the Joker has an agenda and it's a sinister one.

Anyone who has ever read the comics would catch that it's a lot like the story, ""Knightfall"" and ""No Man's Land"" which are two stories that must be read by the way. The movie is loaded with amazing performances, I did mention Bane, Tom Hardy who gives a great, eerie performance. Anne Hathaway is another who stood out. Many whined before seeing it that she wasn't fit for Catwoman, funny, Anne looks like Salina Kyle and acts like her too. Anyone who criticizes her is simply wrong and should probably read a comic for a change. She had that role down to a T. She was sexy and mysterious like she should be. Another great performance that stood out is Michael Caine as Alfred. He was always good, however, he had to give his all in this role it was a performance that really stuck out. These are just a few examples that I can give out.

This movie is a prime example on why I hold Christopher Nolan on a pedestal. He can take a big idea and make it practical he doesn't need to go heavy on the CGI to make his films look visually amazing. He proved it many times with Inception, the flawless Dark Knight and Batman Begins. He is without question the greatest filmmaker in this new generation of filmmakers, he and Darren Aronofsky can do no wrong at this point. Nolan is the filmmaker that I hope to be one day. I hope to be able to do what he does. I have seen every Christopher Nolan movie now, he has made nothing but great movies, it's almost as if he's never seen a bad movie nor knows how to make one. All his movies have perfection all over them it's insane how good he is. He's made enough to prove himself if you ask me.

I have sang too much praise for The Dark Knight Rises, I will admit the movie does have some flaws here and there, one of them is I felt they needed to develop the character Catwoman a little more and serve her more of a purpose. That's just one, there are some plot holes in it but they're mild plot holes and I will admit there were times I could not understand what the characters were saying. Bane and Jim Gordon were two that I had a difficult time making out what they were saying that needed some work. It was a problem I had with them but it did not stop me from loving the movie. I can go on and on.

Christopher Nolan has made the perfect trilogy. The best I have seen since the original Star Wars trilogy. He has proved himself yet again that he is here to stay and is one of the best there is at this time, I love his Batman movies but also his other movies. I can't wait to see what else he has in line for us to watch. I look forward to seeing more works from him and I look forward to seeing The Dark Knight Rises yet again. It gets an A+",1355097600,,4181,4.117647058823529
4427540,1,B004LWZWGK,"Other than Anne Hathaway's performance, this movie is a complete waste of time. The plot is ridiculous, even for a comic book movie. The art direction and cinematography is dreary gloomy and boring. This is a movie searching for a point, yet attempting to be profound or even sensical. It fails. The film single-handedly makes one wonder whether Nolan's prior success was a fluke or whether he has had a brain transplant since the first movie. Bale's Batman is a weak and feckless. Fusion of the Dark Knight Returns and Bane storylines was ill-conceived and poorly executed. What you end up with is a three hour movie that should've been one and a half hours long with a tight story and a point. You can almost see Nolan attempting to be relevant or profound.

I guess I'm one of those people, but not because it's a bad movie, far from it. It's is a great movie. This is sort of a strange criticism, though I'm not alone in my stance: this should have been the fourth movie. There needed to be a movie in between The Dark Knight and the Dark Knight Rises. It hasn't even been 8 years in real life, and yet we have to imagine that after two big battles with arch villians, Batman retires. Isn't he more convicted to the oath he made to his parents about fighting crime, doing what he could so no one would go through what they (and he) went through. Bruce Wayne spends more time trying not to be Batman in this trilogy, rather than being encompassed in his obsession to right wrong. I'm sorry but that's not the Batman I've come to know and love in the comics. It's as though he bowed out way too early. And with a seedy place such as Gotham, why would crime magically stop for 8 years until Bane comes into town.  What I think would have been better is a smaller scale movie (which Nolan would be able to do with much bravado)with say, the Riddler, and show Batman actually quitting. He's making mistakes because of he's not thinking straight (d/t loosing his love interest in TDK). He would be battling the police but also trying to do what he swore to do. Then somehow segway (like they brillantly did with the Joker in Batman Begins)that Bane is coming. a plan such as the one that Bane and Talia came up with would take 8 years to come up with. This would leave me more satisfied than, oh hey, I said triology, so I'm going to make this huge movie and end Bruce Waynes run as Batman. It was a rush job. Its in no way a bad movie, just needed more before it to make it epic and not just big.",1355097600,,1906,4.2076502732240435

This movie sucked. Their was barely any fighting scenes, Anne Stathoway  or whatever was a big biotch the whole movie until the end, and i didn't like the story line either.

It may be my connection although I am on a high speed cable connection getting an average of 21.99 Mbps download speeds. The amazon instant video app on my xbox 360 stopped playback twice while watching. The picture was very dark to the point where it was unwatchable at times. I am sorry I purchased this in favor of the blu-ray just for the convenience of having it instantly. I knew the quality wouldn't be blu-ray quality, but it should be better and be distinguishably different than the SD version.

The movie itself is very well done. I didn't find it as action packed as The Dark Knight but I was happy with the way they chose to end this last chapter in the Christopher Nolan series.

Now that I own it, maybe playback will be improved. I bet it will look better on the Kindle Fire or my iPad with the smaller screen. I had the same issue when purchasing Dexter Season Six.

I wish every American could see this. Although not all might recognize the social-cultural-political significance of the film. I dare not elaborate lest too many be offended. Let me risk saying just this, that the film illustrates where the United States is going, where it might end up, and what *serious* people must do in order to restore our nation and its culture to something that is sane and more in line with reality.

Little to no character development (save Joe Levitt ""Robin"" who was BY FAR the most interesting character).  Anne Hathaway was a passive little princess of a Catwoman and left me missing Michelle Pfeiffer who even in her 50's would have played a still better seductress!  What's Bane's story?  Surely deeper than the puddle of a storyline they presented for him which ended up being the films most interesting twist thus only raising more questions to his character in general.  Lastly, the fight choreography was weak.

And that's probably my only criticism. There are a couple situations where the movie drags. Some scenes could have been cut to keep the movie flowing a little faster and shorten the run time. Keep in mind Batman isn't a drama. There isn't a need to slow things down and be overly dramatic.

Overall, The Dark Knight Rises fits into the Christopher Nolan trilogy very nicely. The plot is creative, it ties into the larger trilogy story line and there's a twist, just like the other two.

I thought the price-to-value ratio was ok. It's much cheaper than going to the theater, but more expensive than RedBox. With a rental kiosk on every corner, the value play becomes availability and effort of acquisition.

5. Batman Begins= good enough. The Dark Knight= better. The Dark Knight Rises= is it just going to let me down? How are they going to end the trilogy while supplying some sort of feeling of completion?

I like short reviews so I will cover these 5 points briefly

1. It was too long without enough action.

  I was entertained the entire time. I didn't feel there was a minute of wasted time in this whole movie.

2. Too many characters in one movie, not able to thoroughly cover each one.

  Disagree. That is all.

3. Anne Hathaway: great actress but as Selina Kyle? I don't know if that's going to work. (This was a major issue for me)

  This girl continues to impress me with her acting and is quickly becoming one of my favorites. I will never doubt her again.

4. Every other summer blockbuster I had seen so far sucked i.e. Snow White and the Huntsmen, The Hunger Games

  The Dark Knight Rises was the only movie I really wanted to see that summer and the two movies I saw in theatres before completely ruined it for me. I was afraid I would be let down again. Should have saved my money for what I was actually waiting for. Lesson learned.

5. Batman Begins= good enough. The Dark Knight= better. The Dark Knight Rises= is it just going to let me down? How are they going to end the trilogy while supplying some sort of feeling of completion?

  All I have to say is when the movie was done I felt like I needed to give a standing ovation, even though I watched it by myself (so what if I am a loner!!) The movie ended just as any good movie should, it left me wanting more.",1355011200,,2033,4.209844559585492

Know about the movie was not long or too short perfect run time it did not overwhelm us with too many characters story was as great as the SFX great ending to a trilogy. hoping the nolan reconsiders not directing another batman movie and if they make a justice league movie he directs it,1355011200,,383,4.408450704225352

4427614,3,B004LWZWGK,"As much as I had hoped and prayed that The Dark Knight Rises was going to be the ""bomb"" ...I was terribly wrong! First, the story was all over the place, certain events that took place weren't believable, the very strong storytelling which made the first two films so good, because they carried a sense of realism, a realism that made you believe that what was happening was real, or could happen. For instance; Bruce Wayne, according to the comic book, is suppose to be a man past his prime. They attempted to exemplify this in the film, I suppose that's what the few gray strands found on Bruce Wayne's head was about? Whatever! Also, Batman suffers a back injury that left him unable to stand, how is it he was able to have his back ""repaired"", afterwards, do a few sit-ups and push-ups, and then all of a sudden he climbs out of a possibly 50ft. pit, and now he's ready to get back into the fight? Whatever! The entire story was all over the place, the story/movie felt crammed, as if it should have been cut into two films like a Part I & II (like the comic book-duhh!).
 After I had watched the movie, I began thinking to myself, ""is this it, tell me this isn't it!"" I felt let down by the movie. I'm not implying that the movie is horrible, but for it to be that last one, the director and producers went out on a soft note. I don't care to watch the movie again as I love watching the first two, I don't want to buy it on Blueray, I don't even care to watch it if it just so happens to be on my cable lineup for the evening. The bottom line is this, there isn't anything spectacular about this latest Batman film. So, whenever I decide to watch Batman Begins, and The Dark Knight in succession, I believe that I will complete the series with watching the anime, The Dark Knight Returns: Part I, and experience a much better ending to my beloved Batman franchise.",1355011200,,1870,4.2824858757062145

The facts are the movie is long, but entertaining. Nolan's rendition of the Batman is the best to hit the big screen and the closest to the gritty, 'dark' Batman that many love vs. the cartoon style Batman of the TV old TV show and the previous films. The Blue-ray transfer is great, the film is a joy to watch and in the same style as the previous 2 movies.

Having watched five or six times in the past 48 hours; I see that my few, initial mental criticisms were ignorant of the subtle layering technique (so many small gifts Nolan leaves for viewers to collect, if they are patient) that leaves Nolan technically blameless of the Plot Condemnation - 'gimmicky.'  He is meticulous, so that once viewers have followed the RISES breadcrumbs as many times as I have, trails leading to the multiple conclusions are quite clear.

ONE PROBLEM:  I watched it for the first time Dec 8, 2012, and love RISES more than is wise (as amazing, dark art).  However, Nolan made a terrible mistake with Bane, turning an amazing, AMAZING villain...into a bodyguard (robbed of his compelling origin story by the one plot twist I truly dreaded and found hard to swallow, besides).  Whether it is arguably legitimate and believable, it steals the dynamism of an incredible creation in Bane.

Philosophically, the questions raised are worth answering, whether we agree with the conclusions of any given character; the big ideas stand alone.

I love the soundtrack, too and will be glad to add RISES to my collection.",1355011200,,1261,4.938388625592417

The day the movie was delivered I popped that sucker in my BR player.
I heard a voice.... praying with all my heart that it was a ""henchman"" or somebody of no importance.
Sigh.... this was the voice of the big bad villian.

I cannot believe that after the terror that was Batman's voice in the last movie that this would slip though the cracks. Who in their right mind thought that this was a good idea?? On top of that, the story was all over the place, I was completely lost the whole time. I even had to read the summary on Wikipedia just to understand.

**** Spoiler *****
One thing in particular that I hated was that when the Batman was ""broken"" it looked like a badly played wrestling move, even though I didn't see the wire, I surely could tell it was there. I didn't even know that the Batman had been broken until a side character had to tell me that he was in fact broken.

I ended up not even keeping the movie and listed it on eBay.

Where did Bane even come from anyway? Why does he have it in for batman? Nothing was explained.

This movie had nothing of the intrigue and plot twists of Dark Knight which made that movie so amazing.

4427662,4,B004LWZWGK,"Why ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a good movie.

The film not only houses the familiar characters of the previous two films but also reunites a number of ""Inception"" actors which happens to be my favorite Christopher Nolan film. The story has a familiar feel to it, full of action - villain vs. hero, but it was surrounded by such a huge group of superb actors that it was meant to succeed. With the addition of Anne Hathaway as the cat woman (though not directly referred to in the film), Tom Hardy who so valiantly plays the villain (or is he?), Marion Cotillard who is so mesmerizing and Joseph Gordon-Levitt it breathed new life into what could have been a so-so conclusion to a trilogy of crime fighting.

Nearly three hours in length I found it neither slow, boring nor over the top as some comic book hero movies can be. The story gives us a dose of history, some truth from the two previous films and what seems to be an offering of the future. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" lives up to the tall dark figure looming atop the tallest buildings of Gotham and brings home something worth watching at least once.",1355011200,,1107,4.448275862068965

4427668,5,B004LWZWGK,"I'll only respond to some of the negative reviews this film is getting by saying you're mad.  Director Christopher Nolan has conceived a brilliant trilogy that reimagined an American archetype and created an epic of monumental proportions.  After the debacle of the Joel Schumacher entries Nolan started from scratch and it feels as though he envisioned this as an open and shut trilogy.  Regardless, considering the film's huge appeal I imagine there will be a few thousand weighing in on its merits so I'll get to my point.  With the Nolan films and its TV and big screen predecessors there has always been opinions about certain qualities probably none more than the role of the Boy Wonder, Robin.  However, one constant there can be no argument about is the role of Alfred the Butler.  The casting of this role has been impeccable from the dapper Alan Napier to the urbane Michael Gough to the more working class Michael Caine.  Alfred has always served as a conduit for the audience as Bruce Wayne/Batman's loyal aide who assists uncomplainingly even if he has reservations about is employer's crimefighting activities.  What I like about Alfred in ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is he gets to vent his frustrations after years of personal heartache.  It would be less than appropriate that Nolan did not give a smiling Alfred the last image to close out the trilogy.

The only one that comes to mind as a blow-out success is Star Wars. Great ones may also include the Bourne trilogy. These are two very off the cuff anecdotes, so please don't blast me. Christopher Nolan's trilogy is more akin to The Godfather trilogy in the weighted impact of popularity among fans. Yet we do not remember The Godfather, Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola for The Godfather III, nor will we remember Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy for The Dark Knight Rises.

On to UV vs AIV. For all of you who believe iTunes is the end-all for digital ecosystems, keep this I'm mind: all they care about is getting you to trade up to the latest device. You cannot port your music and videos to a device other than an Apple device. Sure, you can download iTunes to your PC and buy media there, but good luck viewing that on a Kindle Fire or a Samsung Galaxy Note. Amazon is more interested in selling you the actual music and video. They are agnostic to which device you consume the content on. In fact Amazon would likely rather you be an avid consumer of its video and music content on an iPad than a Kindle Fire because then it doesn't have to subsidize your purchase of the device. The bottom line is that Amazon is much more aligned with the consumer's interests than Apple is, so all of you demanding iTunes versions of this and other movies should actually be advocating for Amazon Instant Video versions instead.",1355011200,2,1543,4.471631205673759

4427675,5,B004LWZWGK,"I just finished watching this for the second time (the first time was in the theater) so I thought I would write my review now. I was eagerly awaiting the release of this movie. I have been a huge fan of the franchise ever since the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-Begins-Blu-ray/dp/B000PC6A3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman Begins [Blu-ray</a>]. Whenever I am really excited about a new movie, I tend to feel a little disappointed the first time I see it. That is why I watched this movie a second time, and I definitely enjoyed it more the second time around. I am not going to give an overview of the plot. Other reviewers have done that. I am going to simply list what I liked about the movie (and one thing, at the end of my review, that I did not like). There are some spoilers in my review so if you have not seen the movie yet you probably should not read my review. This is also a very long review. Once I start writing I usually find it difficult to stop. Alright, enough preface, onto the review!

I have always liked the idea of super hero movies, but there are actually very few super hero movies that I really enjoy. In fact, I do not even watch very many of them, because in my experience I am almost always disappointed with them. The three Nolan Batman movies are really the only super hero movies that I think get it right. There are a number of reasons I think these films work so well. Here are some of the reasons I think this particular film works so well.

First, it is set in the real world, and not some cartoonish world. I realize that some super heroes can only exist in a cartoonish world. Batman is one of the only super heroes that is, ultimately, just a guy in a suit. When you start talking about actual super powers you have obviously left the real world. Still, I am amazed at how few super hero movies attempt to create realistic characters, with understandable human motivations. Christopher Nolan has done a great job in this film, and the other Batman movies, creating a whole host of interesting and realistic characters. Ra's Al Ghoul, The Scarecrow, The Joker, and Bane are, in my opinion, the most interesting villains I have ever seen on screen. Each one is different, they have different motivations, and, most importantly, they are each unique. Most movie villains are essentially interchangeable with one another, you cannot tell them apart. The villains in these movies are real, full blooded and fully realized, characters, and so are all the other characters. That, on its own, is a real achievement.

Second, the writing is very good. I did not think that the writing in this third movie was quite as good as in the first two. There were some lines, which I did not write down and cannot remember off the top of my head, where I thought ""I have heard that before"". But mostly the writing is quite good. I have been noticing lately how many cliched scenes tend to show up in films and television. I am starting to get the feeling that there are ten or twelve scenes that literally get passed from writing room to writing room, implanted directly from one movie right into the next (how many times have you seen the ""it's not your fault"" scene?) I did not get the feeling that any of the scenes in this movie were stock scenes that I had seen in half a dozen other movies. The writers put some thought into what they were attempting to say. I especially liked the underground prison which, I thought, was a particularly good metaphor for a kind of Chekhovian despair, and the solution (climb without the rope) was a good piece of writing. I had a few minor quibbles with the overall plot, holding the city to ransom with a nuclear device, but ultimately I think it worked.

Third, it is more complex than the standard super hero flick. For example, is Cat Woman a hero or a villain? I love the way that they decided to make her both. All of the Batman movies tend to move past the simplistic good guy/bad guy dichotomy. The world itself is more complex than that. Everything is not all black and white. It is rare to see any kind of moral complexity in a super hero movie.

Fourth, the acting is superb all around. Christopher Nolan has a knack for picking really good actors. The repeat characters, or the characters that appear in all three movies, are all excellent of course. Some of the best actors in the world. And all the new characters in this movie were equally excellent. Tom Hardy is excellent as Bane, Anne Hathaway made an excellent Cat Woman, I have always been a big Joseph Gordon-Levitt fan, and Marion Cotillard, who I have had a minor crush on for years, was also excellent as Miranda Tate.

Fifth, I love everything about Bane as a villain. Super hero movies are, in my opinion, more about the villain than the hero. If you have a really interesting villain then you are on your way to a really good movie, if you have a lackluster, or overly cartoonish, villain, then the movie is already ruined. Evil, for some reason, is just more interesting than good. The super hero is almost like the straight man. You need a good straight man. A bad straight man, or hero, can ruin a movie as well. But the hero represents us, the viewers, and our values. That is not where the true interest lies. The true interest lies in the villain. Bane is a very interesting and compelling villain. You feel his presence as soon as he enters the screen. Just the way he walks is enough to mesmerize. There is a scene where Cat Woman and Batman are fleeing from Daggett's, and there is a moment where Cat Woman turns around, there are probably a dozen henchman firing guns at her, and then there is Bane, just silently walking, and somehow Bane walking is far more interesting, and menacing, than all the henchman firing guns. He draws the eye, his presence is so much more powerful. It is only a split second, but it is one of my favorite scenes in the movie.

Sixth, super hero movies need to be visceral and stir up emotions. I am a philosophy student, and I have actually spent quite a bit of time thinking about why people enjoy super hero movies. I do not really know the answer, but I have a theory. I think that super hero movies empower people. I think most people probably walk around with some unconscious fear or anxiety in their everyday lives. Bad things happen in the world. Even those of us who have never been the victim of a violent crime, know that they happen, and we have all probably been in situations where we were unsure of the outcome, where we felt things could go either way, or where we thought ""If things go badly here I am going to be in a lot of trouble."" I think that super hero movies are cathartic in the sense that they temporarily purge us of our fears. This movie does a good job tapping into that. There were a lot of ""goosebump"" moments in the movie for me, and when Batman finally starts to get the upper hand with Bane, you can feel it viscerally, in your body. That is what movies do, I think. They make you feel helpless (which is why you need a strong villain) and then they empower. This movie does that exceptionally well.

Seventh, I know some people have complained about what they perceived to be the political message of the movie. It seems as if Bane represents the Occupy Wall Street movement. I do not know what Nolan's politics are, but I saw an interview where he said that they were just trying to show the cracks of society that people would try to wedge open. I actually think that was a good device. It made the movie more realistic, and it tapped into emotions that are already there. That is part of what made the movie visceral. Movies cannot create emotions in people out of thin air, they have to tap into emotions that are already there. I think the movie did a good job tapping into emotions that already exist in our society, complains that people already have, without becoming an overt political statement one way or the other. I think it made it a more powerful movie.

There is one minor complaint I had with the movie. I know there were some plot holes, but plot holes, unless they are particularly gaping, do not usually bother me that much. I try to look at things from the writer's perspective. Movies are not meant to be carbon copies of real life, so it makes no sense to demand absolute realism from a movie. If you want absolute realism just live your life. Life itself is very realistic. So I am not going to go through the movie and pick apart the plot holes I thought I saw.

There was, however, one place where I felt like the writer's made a real mistake, and that is the way that Bane was killed. Now, it makes total sense that Batman would have a ""no gun"" policy. When I say ""it makes total sense"" I do not mean that it makes sense from a moral standpoint, or from the standpoint of realism. No one has any moral objections to cops carrying guns, so they should not have any moral objections to Batman carrying a gun, and I am not sure it is really realistic to assume that a vigilante would adopt a ""no guns"" policy, for the same reasons that police officers do not have a no guns policy. When I say it makes sense I mean that it makes sense from a movie maker's perspective because Batman is a super hero. No one wants to watch Batman have gun battles. People want to see Batman fight, hand to hand, up close and personal. A hand to hand battle between Bane and Batman is way more interesting and engaging than a gun battle would be. However, it is not a good idea, in my opinion, to constantly remind the audience of the fact that Batman has that ""no gun"" policy. Particularly when a nuclear bomb is involved.

The notion that Batman would still object to using guns when the city is being threatened with a nuclear device is obviously ridiculous. Now, I am not saying that the writer's should have given Batman a gun. Like I said, the audience wants to see Batman fighting, or using his bat stars, not shooting. What the writer's should not have done, in my opinion, is remind the audience over and over that Batman is not using guns. By having Cat Woman ride in on the bike and just shoot Bane the writer's are just reminding the audience that Batman could have killed Bane at any time if he had just been willing to use a gun, and just in case there are any audience members who do not make that connection immediately, they have Cat Woman make a ""humorous"" quip about Batman's no gun policy right after she does it! Why would you remind the audience that Batman could have killed Bane at any time? Perhaps they were trying to ""own it"" by getting out ahead of the criticism, but it tends, in my opinion, to undercut the whole movie.

Bane took over an entire city because people were afraid of him. Why was everyone so afraid of him when anyone could have just shot him at any time? You do not want the audience to be thinking about such things, which is why I think they should have found another way to have Bane killed, and they should not have highlighted Batman's no gun policy (like the fight scene with Cat Woman). The no gun policy was already established in the prior movies, it should have gone unspoken in this one. That is a minor issue, and it certainly did not ruin the movie for me. All in all, I felt like this movie met my expectations, which were extremely high after the first two movies. Alright, that is the end of my review. Sorry it is so short. I just could not really think of much to say...",1355011200,3,11518,4.435521965044875

The whole reason I purchased this specific version was to get a digital copy of the movie. To my extreme irritation, I was instead asked to join TWO services and download and install a program before I would be able to access my movie that I would only be able to watch through their service. This POS service has now crashed all four times I tried to download the video to my computer so that I can watch it without streaming. One of the reasons that I like digital copies is so that I can have them available through my Apple TV and watch my movies even if I lend the disc to someone else, or in the case of Up, the movie can still be watched after my toddler ""hid"" the disc in the dryer and ruined it...

The point of this is save your money and just buy the DVD or just buy the digital version on iTunes. There is no reason or benefit to having the ""UltraViolet"" copy.",1355011200,9,1027,4.239795918367347
4427678,5,B004LWZWGK,"Christopher Nolan had a lot of living up to with the runaway critical and audience successes of Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. In this concluding volume, we are introduced to the masked terrorist Bane, as he covertly subverts a CIA plane and swiftly proceeds to exterminate the crew. His physical prowess is matched only by his talents for cruelty and breaking people in mind and spirit.

Cut to Gotham, where Commissioner Gordon gives a speech on the eighth anniversary of Harvey Dent's death. Not only is it now a public holiday, but it made possible the passage of legislation that empowered the police to round up a thousand members of organised crime. The war on crime appears to be won (with their next task, according to a young officer by the name of Blake, being chasing up overdue library books). Power-hungry politicians predict Gordon's early retirement, courtesy of the mayor. After all, who needs heroes in a time of universal peace? A week is a long time in politics, and eight years is an even longer time for Bruce Wayne, who has become disheveled, disillusioned and jaded. The loss of Rachel Dawes has turned him into a cripple with a goatee.

There is action, romance and black humour aplenty (Johnathan Crane makes a brief appearance in the movie's latter half). While there are a few elements in common with The Dark Knight, these do not detract from the overall entertainment value of the film. Plotwise, everything comes full circle, character development is wrapped up very nicely, and there is little more that one could ask from a summer blockbuster. Although clocking in at 2 hours and forty minutes (before credits), nothing feels padded out.

Unexpected twists abound, but without giving too much away, The Dark Knight Rises boldly goes where no other Batman film has gone before. This is an action film that borders on horror.

This is edge-of-your-seat entertainment with a profound meaning. It is impossible to watch this film without rethinking the foundations that our 21st-century society has been built on.",1354924800,,2046,4.938953488372093

Don't get me wrong, it was entertaining to watch, and I'm not sorry I rented it.  It just felt like it was missing something in comparison to the previous two.  I did like how they brought the trilogy full circle and tied it all together with a bitter-sweet ending though.

In concluding this review I'd say I like Subway sandwiches, and I really like a full steak dinner with potatoes and red wine.  Both have their place and will be dinner from time to time.  If the previous movies were juicy porterhouses this movie was more of a sandwich sans pickles.",1354924800,,810,4.506849315068493
4427680,2,B004LWZWGK,"OK, the movie is pretty good for a trilogy ending and we know that. I had fun in the movie theater despite of some serious goofs you might find in the IMDB page.

However, the ""Second Screen"" app on your iPhone, iPad or whatever forces you to watch the movie looking at another screen, something you have to buy additionally. What if you don't have an iPhone or a Samsung Galaxy? You're pretty much toasted. The Dark Knight DVD had a feature in the BD that let you watch the features while the movie was playing, same way as Inception. This ""App sync"" is a scam.

Oh and I agree 100% with the 1-star reviews about UltraViolet, essentially a way to compete against Netflix with low-quality streaming. A rip-off worthy of LucasFilm or Apple (The Beatles' Apple and Cupertino's).

4427681,5,B004LWZWGK,"In my opinion, this is the best of the Batman movies.  And not just of the Christian Bale movies, but out of all of the movies dating back to Michael Keaton's.  What a way to finish the story began in ""Batman Begins""!

As I have stated in my movie reviews, the best stories are those driven both by plot and by character.  To some extent, this particular one is more character-driven than its predecessors.  But, do not assume that the plot is secondary.  Both are given equal attention here.  And what a masterful job from director Christopher Nolan, who also co-wrote the screenplay.  Obviously, this is a high-budget movie, and as such, the production quality, and the stuff that make you think ""wow"" are all beyond reproach.  The special effects and the sets are the best that money can buy.  The Batman's toys and high-tech support are all here.  But this movie is really about Bruce Wayne, much more so than the Batman or his high-tech arsenal.  The story that began in the first movie has now come full-circle, and builds up to an awe-inspiring, surprising, and fitting finale.

The story picks up eight years after the second movie.  Batman, with the help of Gordon, has taken the blame for the death of Harvey Dent.  The death of Harvey Dent spurred the people of Gotham to pull together to enact some rather draconian laws in order to fight the criminal elements.  Eight years of very, very aggressive tactics have cleaned up the city.  Gotham is a safe and a peaceful place to live in.  Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne has been living a very reclusive life, holed up in his mansion.  Detached from Gotham society and his company, the billionaire has allowed his business adversaries to gain a foothold within the board rooms of Wayne Enterprises.

Meanwhile, beneath the city streets, in the sewers, Bane has been putting plans together to take over the city.  This Bane has a mysterious connection to Bruce Wayne's past.  As Bane's power starts to grow, Bruce realizes that he is now a  threat to Gotham and must be stopped.  Alfred, ever mindful of Bruce's broken body, pleads with him not to don the cape again.  The loyal Alfred frankly tells Bruce that he is now past his prime and tells him that he can not hope to beat Bane in a fight.  Alfred tells him not to confront Bane.  Bruce stubbornly decides to get back in physical shape so that Batman could rise once again and save the city.  Unwilling to have to be the one to bury Bruce, Alfred decides to quit his job and leave the mansion.

Now alone, Bruce meets up with the mysterious burglar, Selina Kyle.  Gordon is in the hospital, recovering from a run-in with Bane's thugs.  A young policeman named Blake has managed to work out the true identity of Batman and pays Bruce a visit.  At Wayne Enterprises, the ambitious board member Daggett has worked out a plan with Bane that would give him control of the company and all of Bruce's assets.

As the plot unfolds, we see Bruce Wayne brought down to as low as a man could go.  Without his wealth, health, and gadgets, he must find a way to rescue Gotham from Bane and his thugs.  Yes, I agree with one of my fellow reviewers who said that this one has a slower pace than the previous two movies.  And that is primarily because the attention here is on Bruce and what happens to him.  This is the character-driven part of the story.  Watching this, you cannot help but feel sorry for him.  This movie will make you care about this character and will make you really root for him as he brings himself back up from the pit of despair.

Nolan really gave Christian Bale an opportunity to shine as an actor in this movie.  We know Bale is good.  We've watched him since he was a teenager in ""Empire of the Sun"".  But now, with this movie, he has established himself as one of the best actors out there.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt played Blake.  Anne Hathaway plays Selina Kyle.  Michael Caine and Gary Oldman are both back for their respective parts, along with Morgan Freeman.  And Tom Hardy plays the very scary Bane.

Ok, yes this is a movie about a superhero.  But this is not anything like Ironman.  Bruce Wayne and Tony Stark are as different as two people can be.  And this movie is dark and weighty, not light-hearted like the Ironman movies.  Both franchises are good, both of the lead actors are terrific.  But the tone of the films are as different as night and day.

This is easily one of the best movies this year, perhaps second only to ""Prometheus"", in the humble opinion of your reviewer.  I rented this movie from XBox, but you can also rent it from Playstation and from here.  If there is a movie worth having on your Blu-Ray library collection though, this would be near the top of the list.  This is one of those movies that would make a great addition to any respectable Blu-Ray or DVD collection.",1354924800,,4822,4.5098265895953755

The supporting actors have some goofy lines and the extras who got a few lines needed some acting lessons.

Is this even a Batman movie? Batman shows up so little, it doesn't seem like it!  We continually see a ""woe is me"" weak and broken down Bruce Wayne.  He has completely lost the spirit that made him so captivating in the other films.  I understand the loss of both Rachel and Harvey took their toll, but there wasn't much in DKR to make you care about Bruce and his mission.  By the way, what -is- his mission in this film?

Anne Hathaway does a good job with what she was given.  She has a lot of spirit, although her purpose isn't all together clear.  Either the picture was dark or there was lots of poor set lighting because there weren't many opportunities to get a clear look at the ""controversial"" cat woman suit.  Doesn't matter though.  She kicks butt!

There is an understanding of what makes them tick-and progression. It is almost shocking,when we eventually catch up with Bruce Wayne...to discover his plight, and where he is. But the clues are there. Oh,yes-the clues are there. Once you know how this third film ends,what Nolan has been showing us does have a pay off. And that really,is the whole point of this film. Parts one and two have been leading to this. Even if Nolan at first didn't even realise it himself...his version was three dimensional. Batman,the most human of superheroes. Our figures of the printed page,have always had the most grand of beginnings-now with this third movie,we finally have closure. Do I recommend it? Of course...But how highly it should be thought of,probably comes down to the individual. How satisfying,you find the outcome. Rest assured though,there is a truth about it. Without a doubt, the greater reality is,is that the BAT will surely return. Just not in the form of the excellent Mr Bale. Or any time soon. Who then should follow in his nimble footsteps?Be the new king of comic-book films? Everybody knows Batman,and everybody would like to know. The support will be there. Well, the answer kids,is that he's here already. Yup-you heard. The problem is, that not everybody knows about HIM,and he d o e s need your support. Like your graphic novels gritty,dark,and adult?Want your comic movie heroes cool and funky,just like BATS? Well my friend,the answers simple. And you can get your fix almost right away. Grip-a-thon!!! The name is "" DREDD ""...and if you missed him in the cinema he's comin' your way on blu-ray veeerry soon. Yep, Judge DREDD.British comic book classic set in a future america - and he's the biz. Karl Urban is a name who should be on everybody's lips.

I know Christian Bale was tired of doing Batman and so is Nolan and they reflected it with the story in the movie. Anne Hathaway as CATWOMAN was pure Brilliance. For me she saved the movie. She nailed Catwoman perfectly. Tom Hardy as Bane was another excellent choice. His back story was also better than the comic back story. They dropped the ball with Talia AL Ghul big time. I enjoyed Gordon Levitt's character alot. Heck he did more detective work than Batman. Overall I gave this one a two star rating because Nolan dropped the ball on Batman.

4427699,2,B004LWZWGK,"Can we get a meow? It appears not. The Dark Knight Rises is just not an entertaining film. It has a few moments of interest but otherwise demonstrates how a film maker believes that the bloviating dialogue of secondary characters can carry a movie. I've already taken the chore on, but if one wants to sit back and watch nearly the entire Batman cast fill in non action actions scenes talking repeatedly about ""the bomb"" and what it can do, and how it will hurt people, have at it. Would you watch this film again and again? Obviously many will (and have), but I have to wonder if it is just false praise because of the affinity we have for the Batman character. This is a boring movie, period. Sure there are action scenes but they are not well presented, and I could care less about them without a cohesive and thrill inducing story.

Catwomen who's name we are to secretly know through pure inference was sexy looking but dull. Her mask was bogus and added nothing to the character. Again with sequence after sequence of cut/chop fight shots that I've seen adinfinitum (even much better) in low budget martial arts films. This was a disappointing Catwomen who I'm sure advocates of the film will say was unique and introspective. Uh, no, I was just waiting for her to ""come alive"". I like live action comic book characters, not costume rote lined bores.

 When it comes to Bane, he definitely projected awesome terror but his words dragged on. In addition, many liberties can be taken with comic book characters but Batman recovered way too fast from his injuries, especially a near broken spine.
I think this film like the second Nolan Batman film  relied heavily on empty chitter -chatter. Words that ended up meaning nothing and scenes that labored on to no exciting purpose. It's great to see one of my favorite DC superheroes taking it to the criminals with a cool costume and bat-weaponry, it's a shame you must endure an act of drudgery to get to the few decent scenes of a big screen Batman. The Dark Knight Rises is a failure. The ending , which we all know is just that, a true no more ending, leaves you with  the only bright spot, the development of Robin, which looks like it would have played out better than what I just sat through.",1354924800,,2250,4.545679012345679

An evil terrorist threatens Batman's beloved Gotham City and he has to shake off his physical and mental depression and save the city or watch as it is destroyed.

The cinematography and characters were excellent and the acting was well done.  The movie was very good but for me it seemed just a bit long as if they did not know how to reduce its size.  It is an excellent close to the trilogy through. The movie contained a lot of character development and flashbacks to build the scenario of what was taking place and why the characters behaved the way they did.  I think that is why the movie was so long but it still held our interest as the storyline was good.  The character Bane (Tom Hardy) was portrayed as a cold blooded and vicious killer with no respect for personal life.  In essence he was a perfect villain to face Batman's heroic effect to save Gotham.

The result was the golden era of Hollywood.  Nowadays writers/directors once achieved certain fame and success, they were given carte blanche to make whatever the movies they wished to make.  The result is this last instalment of the most recent Batman trilogy which cost hundreds of millions to make and with the best available cinematic technology and the top actors from Hollywood.

I like Bale, Caine, Tom Hardy, and Gary Oldman: Caine is noticeable for well-calibrated delivery, and Oldman is noticeable for how natural he seems. I am surprised by Anne Hathaway, who is so good in even the most perfunctory moments of plot exposition that I wondered after each of her scenes if anyone could do that better.

So much character development and exposition happens in this movie that it's about to burst. Christopher Nolan stitches it together adeptly. I don't know if it was his choice, but the female voice ullulating on the soundtrack as Batman flies the bomb over the ocean is the only substantial irritant in the whole 2 hours and 45 minutes; time for Hollywood to dump that cliche.

The only problem with the film is the sheer number of storylines, expositions, and character arcs: everyone has a story, and something behind that story, and we see it all. I was never bored, but when so much happens in one movie, everything gets run a little fine, and it creates a sort of predictability to the plot elements which seems inevitable if you have only 3 minutes for some of them.

To avoid that I was forced to see the whole movie with black bars just because of the continuos IMAX tall shots inserted throughout the entire movie. I know that most people have HDTV sets that are 16x9 and will see the black bars anyway and the IMAX shots would use the whole screen, but not for Cinemascope home theaters projecting a movie that supose to be Cinemascope.

When I saw the movie at the local theater I do not remember if the IMAX shots forced the aspect ratio of the projection to be adjusted, I believe the image used the whole width of the screen all the time. Perhaps the IMAX theaters showed it the way the Bluray is, but there should be two versions of discs then.

Consideration should be given also to newer HDTV sets that are Cinemascope 2.35:1 aspect ratio that show widescreen movies without black bars, these TVs were specifically designed to do so and they would show most of this movie correctly, but would cut the top/bottom of all the IMAX shots.

I normally only comment on the technical and presentation aspects of DVD's.

""The Dark Knight Rises"" has a horrible soundtrack (2.0, 5.1 - I listened to both).  I could not understand most of the dialogue and NOTHING of whatever the character Bane was saying.  My experience was that of listening to a movie with mostly incomprehensible speech and gibberish.

The picture is spectacular but I prefer to understand what is said when the characters talk, not guess.  Christopher Nolan should have made this a silent movie; then at least I could use my imagination, fill in the words myself, and I would not be distracted by dialogue I cannot understand.  I should mention that this is almost a flawless DVD with one, maybe two pauses during play.

What will amaze you is the one extra feature on this DVD:  ""The Journey of Bruce Wayne"".  I played that and it was thoroughly refreshing to hear people actually speaking clearly!  Hah!  Why could such clarity not be achieved for the feature film?

2-stars for high-quality DVD [play] and picture.  Sorry, sound is important to me.  I couldn't understand what people were saying sometimes even when I was looking at their lips.  Very weird sound mixing and shortfalls for such a big-budget motion picture.  Bad experience.

ADDENDUM 2013-02-18:

This is the crappiest modern DVD I've ever heard, sound-wise.  I first watched this DVD December 07, 2012 and I had no further interest whatsoever in it ~ but decided to give it another try February 18, 2013.  I have listened to both Dolby Digital 5.1 and Dolby Surround 2.0 tracks, with the latter surprisingly being a little better.

The director and writer introduce this very powerful and threatening criminal character, and you cannot understand a word that he is saying!  Of course, most of the other dialogue comes across as gibberish, too.

It boggles my mind that in 2012 a movie would be made with such poor sound.  Save your money, and save 3 hours of your life -- buy some older DVD's and cheaper ones that have superior sound -- most will, trust me.

It's not even entertainment.  I would say classify this DVD as ""frustration"".  Very, very poor product.  This Batman series would be dead anyway based on this DVD.  It's just... junk.  What a waste of time for the actors to be immortalized in trash.

I am also going to reduce this to one star.  I hope to never sit through these 3-hours of garbage again.  And since the main characters wear masks, good luck reading lips!  The dialogue was probably dubbed in later... via a soup can!",1354838400,9,2656,4.710239651416122

4427732,5,B004LWZWGK,"What Christopher Nolan has done for the onscreen legacy of Batman is tremendous and I think anyone who takes on making a Batman film in the future will have their work cut out for them. Below is my basic list of Pros & Cons for the film.

Pros

Bane - casting Tom Hardy as Bane was the best casting choice Nolan has made since casting Heath Ledger as the Joker. Not only is Tom Hardy qualified to portray Bane's massive size/strength, he's easily one of the most underrated actors out there today and what the man is able to do with 90% percent of his face covered is pretty amazing. Say what you will about the voice, I loved it. Like everyone else, I was barely able to understand what he was saying in that first teaser that was released, but our concerns were obviously heard because the voice turned out to be both menacing and intelligible.

The Story - I thought the story was well thought out, as engaging as TDK, and overall fulfilling for most of the people that are fans of these films and Batman in general.

Selina Kyle - Anne Hathaway is brilliant as Selina Kyle and I love that she was not referred to as Catwoman in this film, further removing her from the comic book realm and bringing her closer to our world.

The rest of the cast - Christian Bale, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman & Michael Caine have all been brilliant in every single one of these films and I am happy they all returned for one last go around. I've also got to include Joseph Gordon-Levitt & Marion Cotillard as well. I'm anxious to see what his interpretation of Batman will be if/when he gets a chance to play the character. Marion Cotillard has been great in everything I've seen her in, and I'm glad that they picked her to debut the character of Thalia al Ghul on the big screen.

Cons

The End - I'm not sure how many other people are out that wanted this as much as I did, but I really wanted Batman to die at the end of this film, and this is the biggest problem I have with this film. It would have been a perfect way to end this series for so many reasons, one being how can you have a movie in which the theme throughout is ""There is no hope without despair"" and have a happy ending? To me it's a contradiction to the film and a huge contradiction to what the Batman in these films stands for.

Bane's backstory - The minute they take away Bane's backstory in this film, they've taken away the heart of Bane. They could've easily left Thalia intact without giving her the backstory of Bane.

Overall this film is great, and there obviously more Pros than Cons (in my opinion). Watch it for yourself and make your own decision.",1354838400,2,2621,4.310975609756097
4427733,2,B004LWZWGK,"...the hype, that is. Why is everyone so obsessed with this movie? It is by far the weakest installment of the entire ""Dark Knight"" trilogy. I don't want to give too much away, but here is what bugged me the most. First of all, I've watched ""The Dark Knight"" about 20 times. Am I missing something crucial here? Because I do not remember Batman getting so messed up at the end of that movie that he is left a decrepit cripple. Secondly, Bane was the worst villain we've seen in these films. Yeah, he's a big bad guy. I get that. But he looks like Brian Urlacher in a Hannibal Lecter mask with a pair of man boobs. That's more laughable than intimidating. Also, I have complained about Christian Bale's muffled Batman voice throughout this entire series, which gets harder to understand with every film. However, Bane's mumbles make Batman sound like the Enunciation King. Bane sounds like he has marbles in his mouth the entire time. I am not a comic book reader, but I am also confused about how a certain person could have his back broken in a movie, and then be up chasing people around again in just a couple of scenes. Hmm.

There were a couple of good things about the film. I adore Marion Cotillard in everything she does and thought her performance was amazing in this film. I enjoyed the twist with her character at the end, which I did not anticipate. I also liked this new interpretation of the Catwoman character. Anne Hathaway is usually a very overrated actress, in my opinion, but I thought she delivered a solid performance this time around (although I still wish someone else had been cast in that role, because AH just really bugs me). Still, the twist at the end involving what becomes of Selina Kyle was a disappointment. It was unexpected and unbelievable, in my opinion. What a lame way to end a trilogy that had been so exciting up to this point.

I waited a long time to see this movie, and I really expected it to be better than it was. That was almost three hours of my life (oh yeah, this movie drags and drags and DRAGS) that I will never get back.",1354838400,2,2076,4.4319371727748695
4427734,5,B004LWZWGK,once again the DVD special features are a disappointment but the blu ray makes up for it big time if I had it my way this would end the batman series I could die a happy man.,1354838400,,174,3.72972972972973
4427735,4,B004LWZWGK,"Excellent movie. I have enjoyed the Nolan/ Bale films as much as the Tim Burton version of the first Batman. This is saying a lot as I still enjoy the Michael Keaton batman. After Michael Keaton hung up the cape the films went downhill fast. They became campy again and didn't have the dark tone that is important for Batman. I was really excited when Batman Begins came out. It was an awesome way to bring back the Dark Knight. It really put him back to his roots again. I really hope that whoever picks up the torch to make more Batman films really does their homework and is a fan of comics and Batman. It's really hard to do an excellent super hero movie without that mindset. The only complaint I have against The Dark Knight Rises is the sound quality of the dialogue. I don't know if it's just me or not, but in the Theater as well as watching it at home I had a really hard time understanding the dialogue between the characters. Especially Bane. I could make it out enough to follow the action but it was really difficult. Awesome movie other than that. This is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.",1354838400,,1112,4.3
4427736,4,B004LWZWGK,its the best batman movie made. bruce wayne seem the most believeable. made me think he knew he had one last fight left as batman. then to hang up his cape,1354838400,,155,4.032258064516129
4427737,4,B004LWZWGK,I think it was a fitting end for a great trilogy. The dark night was my favorite batman.  Christian bale did a fantastic job,1354838400,,124,4.166666666666667
4427738,3,B004LWZWGK,"Who knew the Cat/Bat romance was a May December one.  Don't tell Adam West!  And Robin appears when Bruce is old and gray.  OK.  I thought catwoman was just a walk on.  Anne is sexy as ever, but a little lightweight for the part.  Why even bother having her in the 3 hour movie if she only has 8 lines.

Meanwhile, Bane is a super intelligent Ninja when every time I have seen him in the DC universe he is an amped up brute.  I would have liked to see him juice up and transform into the hulk.  As he was, he was intimidating only because Batman never threw a batarang at his precious mask.

Minor nit.  Bane sacrifices one of his own people on the airplane so the CIA won't get suspicious, but takes the doctor from the plane.

What is this Harvey Dent hero thing? And Ras Al Ghul's daughter is a billionaire mogul whose only goal is to blow up Gotham? Becoming a billionaire is a lot of work. Oh well.  I thought Gordon was ready to retire in the last one.  8 years later and he hasn't aged a day, but Bruce is worn out and old...  Some great action sequences.  The stupid Tom Swift plane wouldn't have been able to outrun a rocket though with that rotor on the underside, it wouldn't fly either.",1354838400,,1198,4.165938864628821
4427739,5,B004LWZWGK,"Believe it or not, my expectations were astronomical and Christopher Nolan exceeded them. I went into this movie expecting a phenomenal film and what I got was the conclusion to a trilogy that I can only compare to the likes of Lord of the Rings (LOTR) and the original 3 Star Wars (SW). Although, not even reletively similar in how the movies play (compared to LOTR and SW), the dark knight trilogy is one of the best 3 trilogies of all time. I consider the 3rd Godfather reason enough to put the Godfather trilogy 4th by a considerable margin compared to the three I just referenced. In terms of all three movies being one complete story, The best trilogy(s) of all time are as followed:

1) Lord of the Rings
2) Batman/Dark Knight (Nolan)
3) Star War's
4) Godfather
5) Bourne, Indiana Jones, Terminaor, pirates, etc... (most are more than a trilogy now).

Obviously, the above list is exponentially subjective but I feel as it accurately depicts at least by a rough estimate, the top choices for any individual to  create their own list, and in their own order.

Anyway's The Dark Knight Rises (TDKR) is such a must-see film, I won't get into any detail whatsoever about any of the movie. Based on my favorite movies, you can decide if your taste is like mine at all; then make the determination on whether you want to see TDKR. I am not a great critic, as I found zero flaw's in the movie but I do love movies... a lot. So basically, I like all Leonardo movies after titanic, Christopher Nolan is the favorite Director (due to Memento, Inception, The Prestige). I am also a huge Martin Scorsese fan (obviously, every movie he's ever done btw) and David Fincher as well (Fight Club, Dragon Tattoo, The Game, Social Network, Seven, and many, many more) I like the Iron Man movies more than every other superhero movie besides TDKR. Big time Shawshank fan, huge The Town fan, loved Enemy of the State (and most of Will Smith's stuff). I like Quenton Tarantino and think his upcoming Danjo Unchained is going to be awesome. Not a huge Matrix fan which is strange with my other movie preferences. Obviously the whole Hanibal Lector series, I'm a big fan of Green Street Hooligans, big fan of Robert DeNiro and most of the stuff he's been in too. I am a comedy fan but more a fan of a bad*** movie like TDKR. To give a more specific preference, I give The Departed the nod for my favorite movie of all-time. TDKR is up there, - top 10. I actually put both, The Dark Knight (TDK) and TDKR in my top 10 movies ever made. Only other movie series on that kind of level is The Lord of the Rings.

In conclusion, this is my first review of a movie... ever. So I essesntially just listed my preferences for a good movie, and TDKR certainly fits that mold.  I highly reccommend TDKR to anyone, but certainly someone who has taste for any of the forementioned films on my ""preference list"". Well, I don't know if this will help you but I gave it my best shot. If you read this, good for you... now you know what kind of movie's I like and got a good reccommendation for a great film. If you stopped reading after the first few sentences, also great... move on, do big things, im outta hereeeeee. watch TDKR!!!!!!!!",1354838400,,3203,4.448040885860307
4427740,1,B004LWZWGK,"Batman Begins was an ""OK"" movie in my mind. I wasn't in love with it but I didn't totally hate it. The Dark Knight was an amazing masterpiece of a movie. I've watched it several times over and over again. Can't say enough good things about it. I was pretty excited to finally watch The Dark Knight Rises.

Last night I rented The Dark Knight Rises from Amazon Instant Video. I was so bored by the beginning of the movie that by the time the action picked up towards the end I just didn't care. The ending credits couldn't come fast enough. It took forever for anything interesting to happen and when an action scene did happen it was over with too quickly and honestly I didn't care at all for the characters. In The Dark Knight I really felt for Batman, Harvey, Gordon and Rachel. I even felt the terror that all of Gotham felt regarding the Joker. I felt that Bruce Wayne/Batman was just a wimp in this movie. Gordon played a very small part of the movie, Harvey isn't around since he died in the last movie (same with Rachel). The destruction that Bane brought was big but I just didn't feel the terror from the citizens of Gotham like I did when Joker was running things.

I'll never be seeing this movie again.",1354838400,11,1215,4.348017621145375

4427742,2,B004LWZWGK,"Wow.  I thoroughly disliked this movie.  I suppose it was even more disappointing after The Dark Knight.  In my opinion, this was a long, tediously boring film that had Batman in it very little overall.

Nolan took Batman and Bruce Wayne and made a faithful, 'dark' rendition of it in Batman Begins. But in this movie, he took them and made them completely his own.",1354838400,,310,3.9365079365079363
4427751,4,B004LWZWGK,"This film is very well made, well paced, just very well thought out, and very well crafted toward what it wants to be.
It reminds me a lot of those big tentpole movies of the thirties and fourties. Hundreds of Extras, big overarching storyline, hero on a journey for self-redemption, it's just very classic in that regard.

I would definitely recommend giving this one a rental, you will not be disappointed in my opinion.",1354838400,,422,4.702702702702703
4427752,4,B004LWZWGK,"First off, I will be comparing this blu-ray to the Avengers bluray considering both are in the same caliber of movie.

Pros:
-Deep blacks in picture quality
-1 hour documentary of the batmobile spanning from the comics, to burton, all the way to the tumblr.
-Amazing IMAX scenes that pop out on a good theatre system.
-Hans Zimmers score shines through a good surround sound system

Cons:
-If you don't have a nice, large tv with good picture quality, than you won't be able to appreciate the IMAX scenes and cinematography.
-If you don't have a good sound system or headset, the music can drown out some of the quieter dialogue.
-In infamous Nolan fashion, it is skimp on audio commentary and deleted scenes. (both of which Nolan has a history of doing)
-Ultraviolet proves to be a pain in the ass and while may be streamed to any device, cannot be used through iTunes. The registration and streaming process is a hassle and proved frustrating. Don't depend on this for the digital copy.

While there is more cons than pros, this bluray is the standard for this movie and as a huge batman fan and bluray-phile, this is still a great pick up. Note: I feel like WB is holding back on another special/collector's edition that has all three movies again, but with more special features perhaps. Either that or they missed an oppurtunity to make a definitive TDKR release on bluray.

Must buy for batman or comic book fans, regardless of how you felt about the movie.",1354838400,,1463,4.637065637065637
4427753,1,B004LWZWGK,"First off I want to start off by saying that the Dark Knight Rises was a great ending to the trilogy, and I expected nothing less from Nolan this time. And the fact that he said ""No way Jose"" to 3D made it that much sweeter.

Sadly I had this limited edition Bat Cowl Blu-ray/DVD set reserved and had to cancel it due to money issues, and was looking forward to waiting until next week to re buy the product. This was going to be my Christmas present to myself. I have the collectors sets for the first 2 movies, and I collect limited and collectors editions of movies as a personal thing. So I look and see that they are sold out through Amazon, and not sold anywhere else, so I figure ""Ok this makes sense."" So I look at the re-sellers, and low and behold what do I see? A limited edition item being sold for 2-10 times the retail value, and its an item that is NOT EVEN A WEEK OLD! Now there is no excuse like ""Oh I bought it and decided I did not want it"" for any of these re-sellers, this is pure and simple GREEDY PRICE GOUGING!

I would think that Amazon would have limited the purchase of a Limited edition item per person, so something like this would be for the most part prevented. But sadly on both here and eBay I see pages of people selling this item for 10 times its worth not even a week has gone by since the f***ing thing came out.

Because of this I may never shop at Amazon again, because I am sick of greedy parasites that do not buy something because they collect, or because they enjoy the product, but because they want to make money off of people. So any company that turns a blind eye to this activity does not deserve my business. I would expect this from eBay, but not Amazon.",1354838400,6,1704,4.141993957703927

4427756,5,B004LWZWGK,"Batman is amazing. The whole series is amazing. To be completely honest I did think that the Dark Knight was a little bit overrated, I enjoyed it, but it was not as good as everyone made it out to be. This complete series is rivaled only by the origonal Star Wars Trilogy and The Lord of the Rings Trilogy! This being said if you already have the first two movies finish the collection!

4427757,5,B004LWZWGK,"Christopher Nolan really did it with the Batman trilogy. I haven't seen any movies that were as good as these, and even the last of the three movies was strong compared to many other third movies. The casting was up to par with the movie's predecessor, with Tom Hardy playing ""Bane"", the masked mercenary. The emotion of this film was probably more striking than that of the last one simply because it's a different side of Bruce Wayne that we've never seen. Even though the Joker's (Heath Ledger) mind games were enough to dazzle audiences, Bane's brutality and mental prowess prove to be more than a match for the Joker's psychotic ""plan"". This film has that re-watchability factor that allows viewers to enjoy it multiple times without fail, and proves that the more you watch it, the more you will come to appreciate how Nolan has rejuvenated Batman since Tim Burton.",1354838400,,871,4.774834437086093

You hardly see Batman as much and it irritated me. Bane was good, even though his backstory isn't exactly like the comic book. His mask being a thing he needs to keep him alive didn't make much sense, how does he eat with that thing? I hated the ending with that John Blake dude being named Robin and implying he's taking over the mantle. I didn't like the fact that Bruce faked his death in the end and move on with Selina, it leaves Gotham with peace again over another lie just like taking blame over Two Face's crimes.

I believe this is because of not being  able to understand half; of what is being said.  It was to me and this is only JMHO- not as good a move as The Dark Knight.

  I believe this was the end of 'Batman', but I believed it opened the door for "" Enter-Robin "". To Me it would have rated 4 stars, but the Sound Projection, just dragged it down to a 3 star to me.  Again JMHO.

UV (Ultraviolet) work with all my Blu ray players, all my phones, PS3, XBOX 360, Ipod touch, and a lot more than itunes does.  I have purchased a lot on itunes.  However, I kept running out of disk space, because I love moves, and have hundreds of them on my hard drive. With this movie, all I have to do is input a code online and the movie can be streamed in all the rooms in my house. With itunes, I can watch it on my laptop and PC or MAC, and can only stream through Apple TV.  UV works with about any Blu Ray player and was formed by about 100 different companies.

The movie/disks, its amazing too.  Full of features and a great movie.  I don't need to go into detail because many other reviewers have.  If you liked the first two.  Its safe to say you will like this one too.

Growing up I became accustomed to the comic book style atmosphere of Batman. If you're a baby boomer you remember that during fight scenes bursts would light up the screen with blurbs saying ""Bam"" and ""Pow."" Those days are gone.
Christian Bale returns as Batman/Bruce Wayne in this third installment, The Dark Knight Rises.
The key word is dark. Batman has disappeared for eight years. Bruce Wayne has become a recluse. Wayne Enterprises is tettering on bankruptcy. Wayne's longtime family friend and go to man, Alfred Pennyworth (Michael Caine) leaves.
The only thing that brings the caped crusader to the surface is a terrorist named Bane, who plans to get hold of a nuclear weapon and destroy Gotham.
When Batman has his intial fight with Bane he is defeated, even crippled. Bane dumps the super hero's tattered body in a foreign prison, where escape is virtually impossible. He sets up a television where Batman can watch as Gotham is brought to it's knees and eventually destroyed.
While in this hole Wayne is told by other inmates how only one small child has ever escaped from this prison. The prison is one of the coolest, dark parts of the film.
It, a variation of the Batplane called ""The Bat,"" and a new Batcave were created especially for The Dark Knight Rises.
The movie is currently the seventh-highest-grossing film of all time, the second-highest-grossing film of 2012, and the second highest grossing superhero film of all time. One cool pix.",1354752000,,1516,4.898832684824903

There are just a little too many plot holes and nonsensical things in the story that prevent me from giving it higher marks. For instance, the entire Stock Market scene was just ridiculous.

I'm a huge fan of Tom Hardy and was overwhelmed with anticipation to see him as Bane. He was scary as s***, powerful as all hell, and a true bastard - he, too, did not disappoint... Although I feel that the true show-stealer was Anne Hathaway, as Selina Kyle (not, Catwoman, as she was never referred to as such). She definitely made the character her own, while paying a subtle homage to Julie Newmar. JGL was also a brilliant choice to play the up-and-coming new masked crusader (whether it be Robin, Nightwing, or Batman, himself). As I viewed the film again, it was very enjoyable to watch the interactions between Wayne and Blake, and thinking of them as the dynamic duo.
I will admit, though, there were some holes in the story, or, perhaps, some things that I had missed or blew by me, that didn't, and still don't, sit well with me. But, being a dedicated fan and follower of all things Nolan (both Jonathan and Christopher), I will leave this as a solely positive review - I couldn't have made the film better myself, anyway... so who am I to judge...",1354752000,2,1174,4.490654205607477

4427797,3,B004LWZWGK,"OK, so all of you Batman nerds want this Limited Edition Bat Cowl Blu-ray set right? Here's the scoop on this sucker. Although it may be a Limited Edition -- it doesn't feel that way. The item is a cheap plastic ""Bat Cowl"" and it sits on a plastic base, nothing more, and nothing less. The biggest gripe you can have with this is that the Blu-ray disc(s) and DVD are stored in a plastic case. The case has cheap stickers that seem to peel off a bit on each side, which it includes the bat logo. That same plastic case that guards your discs is then shoved back into the base where the bat cowl sits on top of. It's a little annoying taking the discs out, too, because they're not only stacked on top of each other with no felt or anything between them--but the button to release the discs is a hassle to push because of the set up.

I'll say this much though, the movie (as it did in theaters) packs a huge PUNCH. If you have a surround sound, your ears will bleed and I mean that in the best way possible. If you have an expensive LED television to which you enjoy all of your films on--your eyes will gasm at the site of the picture. The special features are in 1080p; this also includes a new ""SECOND SCREEN"" feature. This feature allows you to download an app to your cell phone, which will allow you to ""play along with the film."" A little strange at first, but as long as your Blu-ray player and mobile phone are hooked up on the same Wi-Fi, you will have no problems testing this out.

Overall, I'd give this set 3 out of 5 stars. My problem was with the limited edition stand that came with it (as I aforementioned). And another small thing I didn't like was the packaging. The packaging is obviously plastic that the cowl stand is stored in, but the number of the set you received (mines 30,196 out of 35,000) is on a sticker that sits out on this plastic and isn't engraved or numbered on the stand itself. So if you want to keep your numbered plastic packaging to hold your bat cowl in (takes up a lot of room on a shelf) then great. I'm not sure why people are spending and selling this thing for over $100, because it's not worth it. Granted it is a numbered limited run, but don't let that bother you into buying the film itself. It's a sure pleasure to movie fans to watch, and will entertain those who aren't familiar with the series and Christopher Nolan's filming style.

P.S
Nothing to do with the film or plastic bat head, but Amazon shipped this 2-day shipping item with FedEx, which in turn -- turned this into a couple of days late instead of being here on time. Already complained, but Amazon shouldn't use Fedex anymore.",1354752000,2,2645,4.275449101796407

4427802,1,B004LWZWGK,"******SPOILER WARNING!!!!!!!!!!*******

I saw the movie in the theaters, and I thought it was slow, plodding, and all over the place. BUT, I had gone to the ""Marathon"" showing, so we're talking sitting in a theater for 5 1/2 hours watching the first two before even getting to this one.
So, I thought maybe I was just movie'd out and tired.
So, I rented it last night to give it a fair shake.
Didn't help.
First off, this movie broke the two rules that have killed every superhero movie I've ever seen, especially for a finale:
1. Don't introduce new characters that you have to spend all this time on to give a backstory.
2. Never have two enemies for the hero to fight in one movie, because you end up giving each character getting a half-assed story, because once again, both characters need a backstory.
The movie starts with Gotham already cleaned up and crime-free.
Why take it so far down the road?
The title The Dark Knight Rises implied, to me, at least, that Batman, now hunted for killing Harvey Dent would return to save Gotham and finally be hailed by its people as their protector.
Nope.
Instead of Bane staying what he was in the comic books-a drug kingpin-they make him a merc. They give him a mask, which makes him sound like the love-child of Sean Connery and Darth Vader, who possibly suffered a severe concussion at birth, making him hard to hear sometimes.
Then we get Catwoman, whose character does nothing but drag this thing out to almost a whopping 3 hours.
SCHINDLER'S LIST WAS THREEE HOURS!
BATMAN IS NOT SCHINDLER'S LIST!
Bane and Batman finally have a fight, and, of course, Batman never attempts to rip this pain-killing mask off his face. No, Bane, instead breaks his back a-la DC's Broken Bat.
So, now, after enduring Catwoman's needless presence, Bane's long-winded diatribes, we have to sit and watch Bruce get out of a hole while learning life lessons from his fellow hole-dwellers. It's like Disney only with ruptured discs And Bruce does try to get out of that hole. Try, after try, after try.
Meanwhile, Bane is in Gotham, took it over. Spouts, ""People of Gotham, the city is yours. You're free!"" And they are free, unless you count the fusion device he'll explode if they try to leave.
You've got the intrepid young cop, who magically knows Bruce is Batman, because he looked into his eyes. Kinda like the way George Bush looked into Putin's eyes and knew he was an okay guy.
And guess what?
He's Robin!
What?
You've got Daggett in there, you've got the Scarecrow in there, you've got Matthew Modine in there for no other reason than I guess he knows Chris Nolan, Jim Gordon has the pleasure of having his reputation ruined, Alfred gets kicked out because Bruce is all Emo now, and at the end you get . . . wait for it . . . TALIA!
Why?
Because you can't have a stew without carrots!
Let's just chuck 'em all in there for the last big bang!
But what happened to the Fusion Bomb?
Batman flies in and grabs it with his Bat Plane and carries it out over Gotham Bay and it explodes!
He saved Gotham!
He also irradiated the water supply, but that's beside the point.
The whole movie looked like a mash-up of two, maybe three scripts, thrown together to make something so dull and stupid, it was excruciating.
And, must've been an ego thing, at the end, we see Bruce in an outdoor bistro with Selena after faking his own death, ready to live the quiet life.
So, I walked into this movie expecting to see The Dark Knight Rises . . .
And what I got was The Dark Knight Retires.",1354752000,25,3508,4.48125

The trend of a pseudo-heroine character more aggravating than she's worth to the plot has long been a Hollywood staple.  The audience is subjected to her most nefarious deeds only to be forgiven by and eventually falling in love with the hero. In this regard the strange looking Ms. Hathaway does not disappoint. She has finally found a role that is actually more annoying than she is. At one point Hathaway's villainy surpasses that of Bane's, and three quarters into the movie one cannot help but hope that someone, anyone goes ahead and triggers the nuke ridding us of her odious character once and for all. Alas, wishful thinking- we must endure her presence till the very end.

To reward us (or perhaps make amends) for the time wasted on this movie, the writers include a rather pathetic variation on the ""Luke, I am your father"" bombshell. While I will not reveal this ultra-super-duper-secret identity of the real villainous mastermind, I will mention that the very lovely Ms. Cotillard does give a decent performance.

Having alluded to Star Wars, it is only fitting that I extend the analogy further to include Bain, who by all accounts is nothing more than a rehashed bi-manually intact Darth Vader but sporting a Hannibal Lecter muzzle instead.",1354665600,5,1533,5.0

I tested the Bluray version of this movie on a friend's hardware player and on my own two computers.

Both Bluray discs in this package worked fine on my friend's hardware player, which confirms the discs aren't technically defective in any way.

Neither of my computers would play either of the two Bluray discs in the package, however. Both computers (Windows 7) will play other Bluray discs. The most recent Bluray I had on hand (aside from TDKR) was a 2010 release of _Tombstone_.

The software in both computers...Cyberlink PowerDVD 8 on one and Corel WinDVD BD on the other...is the most recent version available. Updating to the current versions of those players would run $50 to $70.

I am returning this set for a refund. I don't think it's asking too much to expect compatibility with equipment that was brand new only two years ago.

His actions were more cerebral; less about the physical carnage he could inflict and more about the psychological impact that resulted. It came down to high concepts and those characters who embodied them. I expected something as grand as that in TDKR but it didn't quite get there for me. Things like the stereotypical (and under-developed) police chief gunning for the glory of taking down Batman, a clean energy technology being turned into a bomb, and then stopping that bomb from blowing just felt formulaic.

My ONLY issue with The Dark Knight Rises is UltraViolet (UV).  UV is not a true ""digital copy"" it is a pain in the butt scheme for Big Hollywood to enhance their consumer research  divisions as well as limiting the consumers right to legally copy their purchase onto their portable electronics.  UV sounds nice, in the test lab.  But when I have to login into two different websites, download a program unto my MBP and then I am only able to watch my movie when I have a Wi-Fi connection.  Sure, UV would work in an airport, at Starbucks/McDonalds, but when I am driving crossroad I do not have Internet access and therefor UV is next to worthless.

In short, Warner Brothers go back to old digital copy system to make the consumers happy.  If I buy a movie that has UV ""digital copy"" I will get my digital copy via other methods, as will other ticked off tech savvy consumers.  Stop worshiping the profit margin and start giving the consumer what THEY want.",1354665600,5,1167,4.4739336492890995

I'm too thrilled after watching the movie that I'm gonna review it in different aspects...

Sound: the sound effects are just amazing!!! It came with dts-hd, the best sound for movies in my personal opinion... The blasts, fights, environmental sounds really make you feel close to the action... As if you were in Gotham city during the whole movie... The soundtrack is also great.... It follows the previews movies style, making you vibrate along with the story... It dictates the ""mood"" so well I just couldn't imagine any other soundtrack for this movie. It fits just perfect!

The image: the blu-ray version comes in full 1080p, with excellent lighting, contrast and color vibrance. The movies runs smooth and the image is so great you can't take your eyes off the screen... You don't even want to blink, afraid to miss something...

The plot: Nolan made a really great work with this movie. It has tons of fast-paced action, it has despair, it has hope, it also has emotions.... These are so well mixed up along the story you just can't wish it was better.... Of course there are some differences between comics and this movie adaptation, but its a great movie.
I got many surprises during the movie... The story comes filled with revelations and surprises.... During the movie, there are so many revelations that almost everyone would probably say; "" oh my... I just didn't see that coming..."" The movie is a piece of art.... I enjoyed this movie so much I feel sad it was the last one.... Was it? The movie itself also prepares the viewers for a possible and most expected sequel....
There's nothing else to say.... The movie is so great it speaks for itself... If you're a Nolan's batman fan, it's a must have... No matter if you've seen it in the theaters or not, it's a must watch action movie... And I'm pretty sure that if you watch it, you'll love it.",1354665600,,2073,4.609756097560975
4427819,5,B004LWZWGK,One of the greatest movie and finale's of all time! I have never been more emotionally moved or satisfied to the ending to one of the createst sags and greatest characters ever in the history of media.,1354665600,,201,4.45945945945946
4427820,5,B004LWZWGK,"It has been eight years since the Batman took the wrap for the murder of District Attorney Harvey Dent. Eight years since the last time the Dark Knight was spotted in Gotham. The streets are safe, the police are receiving praise for doing a good job--except Commissioner James Gordon knows it's all based on a lie. About to come clean of what really happened that fateful night, Gotham is suddenly thrown into chaos at the hands of a mastermind, muscle-loaded criminal named Bane. With the city about to fall, the Batman must return to restore order to his beloved city otherwise it will fall into the hands of a sadistic genius bent on its destruction. To complicate matters, a mysterious female cat burglar is working out an agenda of her own and her endgame is tied into the legacy of Bruce Wayne.

Will Batman rise from the shadows to defeat evil once more, or has he had his day and should have stayed in the dark?

Saw the midnight screening of this gem before it hit theatres all over the world. This movie is epic on a scale that is hard to fit into a simple review, especially since I don't want to give away any key plot points and/or spoilers.

The Dark Knight Rises picks up immediately after The Dark Knight storyline-wise, and eight years later in movie-time. Running throughout the whole flick are threads from Batman Begins and Dark Knight, plotlines that reach their ultimate climax in what I have to say is one of the best endings to a trilogy I've ever seen. It's on par with, third-movie-wise, Return of the Jedi and Return of the King. All comes to a head as we're led down a deep tunnel into who Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) truly is and what being Batman has done to him. Glimpses of his scarred psyche were hinted at in the previous two movies, but really get hit home in an emotional and powerful way throughout this final installment.

Batman himself also shines as he gets to show off his physical skill against a villain that can truly stand toe-to-toe with him, something we never saw in the previous two films. The battle with Bane (Tom Hardy) is realistic, strongly-delivered, and one where this reviewer felt the punches thrown as if it was happening to him. Yeah, it was that good of a fight.

The other Bat-flicks struggled with having two villains in the same movie. To be honest, I never thought I'd see the day where a superhero movie would have more than one villain and be just as good of a movie as if it had just one. Anne Hathaway's Catwoman is the best rendition of the character I've seen on screen, both in movies and on TV. She had to play multiple roles given her identity as a thief and work her deception in such a way that a lot of the time we weren't sure who's side she was on. I'm an Anne Hathaway fan, but this movie easily contains her best career performance to date.

Bane was a crazy good villain, a kind of cross between Joker--intelligence-wise--and Ra's Al Ghul--combat-wise--of the previous two movies. Especially since most of his face was covered with a mask throughout the whole flick, Tom Hardy had to act with his eyes in such a way as to deliver a performance as if he wasn't wearing a mask at all. It was something he did in spades. Bane was one of those on-screen villains that you were afraid of because he's that smart and that powerful and that sadistic.

Gary Oldman did an amazing job, as usual, as Jim Gordon, and Sir Michael Caine nailed it once again as Alfred. In fact, I'd be shocked if Sir Michael didn't get an Oscar nomination for his emotional portrayal of a hard-headed vigilante's butler.

It'd be so easy to give away several key plot points in this review, but I'm keeping it vague on purpose because you simply need to see this movie for yourself. You might think you have it figured out, but you'd be wrong, my friend.

All dangling story threads from the previous two movies are resolved, the SFX did its job but the movie didn't rely on it, and The Dark Knight Rises had one of the best movie endings in history, to me, one equal to the incredibly-satisfying ending of The Shawshank Redemption.

Hats off to director Christopher Nolan and crew for the amazing stories and respect they delivered to Bat-fans everywhere throughout the entire Dark Knight Trilogy.

Good watch Batman. You must return to Gotham.

You must.

4427821,5,B004LWZWGK,"Why do people complain about the ""Oh...why cant they have other then UltraViolet"" is beyond my thoughts....but for the movie's plot, characters, drama, action and mostly the climax.....this was an awesome movie..",1354665600,,212,5.65625
4427822,5,B004LWZWGK,"It's been eight years since Batman vanished into the night. Assuming the blame for the death of D.A. Harvey Dent, he sacrificed everything for what he and Commissioner Gordon both hoped was for a greater good. For a time, it worked.  Criminal activity in Gotham City was stopped by the Dent Act. Everything changes with the arrival of a cat burglar with a mysterious agenda.  Then, the emergence of Bane comes. Bane, a masked terrorist who has ruthless plans for Gotham City. It is then, and only then, that Bruce comes out of retirement as The Batman.

Honestly, I didn't know how I'd come out of this movie...loving it or hating it. After The Dark Knight, there were alot of high expectations set on this film. However, after watching the movie, I'll admit..this is a satisfying conclusion to Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy. Does it outdo the previous movie? No..but, taken on its' own merits, The Dark Knight Rises is an outstanding Batman film. There's lots of relentless action, a deep(scratch that)...an extremely deep storyline and plenty of eye candy. Tom Hardy doesn't make Bane quite as memorable a villain as Heath Ledger did as The Joker but he's quite an imposing force in the movie. To be honest, I never really cared for Tom Hardy as an actor but, after seeing him play Bane, I'm more confident in his acting chops and will start picking up his movies more. Christian Bale does an outstanding job as Bruce Wayne & Batman, like always. Anne Hathaway does a wonderful job as Selina Kyle/Catwoman and she provides some much needed comic relief in a movie that'd be exhausting emotionally otherwise. Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman and Michael Caine all did great jobs as their respective characters.

Out of all the superhero movies that were out this year, I'd have to give this one the absolute top billing as the one I liked most. Even though The Avengers got the most credit and The Amazing Spider Man was the most fun, The Dark Knight Rise was the most compelling one out of them all. Highly recommend The Dark Knight Rises!",1354665600,2,2034,4.72112676056338

4427824,4,B004LWZWGK,"Christopher Nolan strikes again. Perhaps this is the final segment of the ongoing Batman epic, and if so it is going out with a big bang. The film lasts around 2 1/2 long hours but is packed with action and a continuing storyline that basically stays on line for the most part.  The special effects are fine and the cast is huge.

Without summarizing the plot, we meet a physically and emotionally broken Bruce Wayne aka Batman (Christian Bale who despite his apparent physical limitations still maintains a hunky buff body - that is, the little bit that we see of him in this incarnation), grieving over his lost love form the previous episode, and disappearing form the public spotlight.  Even his trusty allies Alfred (Michael Caine) and Fox (Morgan Freeman) fear for his welfare.  But trouble arrives in the personage of Bane (Tom Hardy, completely unrecognizable in a funky mask) who is out to destroy all Gotham policemen and Batman. The good guys are Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) and officer Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who stay in the fray despite the appearance of the vicious Selina (Anne Hathaway, who practically steals the show) and her associate Jen (Juno Temple). The supposed savior of the mess Wayne that has allowed to disintegrate as his foundation is a society dame named Miranda (Marion Cotillard), but of course she has other plans. The plan to destroy Gotham is planned by Bane and his associates and the rest is the long long long finale.

The cast includes many bit parts for some fine actors such as Matthew Modine, Alon Aboutboul, Ben Mendelsohn , Daniel Sunjata, Nestor Carbonell, William Devane, Liam Neeson, Cillian Murphy, Tom Conti, and Desmond Harrington among MANY  others.  The writing is fairly well done and does leave the end as either a farewell or a jumping off for yet another installment.  Entertaining but a bit long and oblique.

This is by far the best movie of 2012. Much better than Avengers. It is also better than Batman Begins. This movie is really, really good.

Tom Hardy is amazing as Bane.

Anne Hathaway was surprisingly good as cat woman.

It's not simply a matter of A/V quality as I noted the same problem when the movie was still in theaters. For some reason, in the case of this movie, a decision was made to bring the score to the fore, making it what I consider an unseen but definitely heard leading character.

4427832,3,B004LWZWGK,"This movie definately had it's pros and cons. Overall it IS a good movie.
DVD/Bluray product: The quality of the BR recording was excellent. This is a pro. A con is, why can't they put ANY special features on the BR disc? The purpose of a BR disc is that it holds much more data and should hold everything. I have 3 discs in my set. BR, DVD and special features. Having to change discs just to see some behind the scenes feels like a waste.
Movie: The twists are ok. Nothing to scream ""You gotta see it"" kind of twists but they are there. Overall movie was fun to watch.
Con: Fight scenes where so slow and clunky. Anyone who has ever trained in hand-to-hand HAD to see this. If 2 fighters were so well trained in advanced martial arts yelled, grunted and telegraphed EVERY move like this, they'd be laughed out of a dojo or killed on the street in a real fight.
I did not like their alternate universe version of Bane. Why was he an ""up-talker""? If you don't know what one is, I am sure youtube has videos. It's funny once or twice but it was annoying here. SPOILER: Since when was Bane ever a part of Ras Al Ghul's guild? I never read anything like that in the books. He was from South America and although he was already a big, fast fighter, he was enhanced by drugs. SPOILER: he loses one hose to his mask and it pretty much ends his fighting spirit? COME ON! I know in the comics he lost his venom so he lost the fight but it was still a fight.
The final twist...(no spoiler) That was NOT his real name.

First we start off with Bane escaping capture and then like 15 minutes later, he already has an army of men underneath the city working on stuff. And Batman's identity being solved so easily was a bit lame to me. Oh because the man scowls he MUST be Batman. If John Blake had linked Batman's disappearance and Bruce Wayne's isolation together then maybe I wouldn't be as upset about that bit.

The 5.1 Master Audio soundtrack is reference quality.  The movie had a tremendous sound design and the reproduction on the blu-ray is nearly perfect....music, sound effects, and dialogue are mixed very well.  Hans Zimmer's score is pretty darned good.

Just like The Dark Knight some scenes are shown in IMAX format and others in 35mm...............this does not bother me except it makes me wish the whole movie was in IMAX format...........the IMAX scenes are MUCH clearer and sharper.................the 35 mm portions of the movie for the most part are softer and very if not too dark.

I really liked the Dark Knight Rises though I think the first 2 movies were better...................TDKR has a lot doing for it in particular the parts with Catwoman..............Miss Hathaway makes a VERY sexy and appealing femme fatale and her scenes are the outstanding parts of the film.

Nolan ended this movie very well, and even though the movie is long, he had me wanting more............a lot more!  Overall a good end to a very ambitious and well made trilogy.",1354665600,5,1121,5.087431693989071

4427840,5,B004LWZWGK,"It is very simple. This is the stunning conclusion to one of, if not the most influential film trilogies of all time. Common complaints about this film include run-time and issues with certain plot/story elements, but those who are well-versed in the trilogy as a whole have no trouble (for the most part) delineating and identifying the reasons for these inclusions. Some people accuse Christopher Nolan of self-indulgence and excess regarding this film, I disagree, but even if it is true, does he not deserve the smallest amount of self-indulgence after the first two films he shared with us? This film is grand in scale, and anchored by powerhouse performances from a returning Christian Bale as a tortured Bruce Wayne, Anne Hathaway as the morally ambiguous (until the end) Selina Kyle, Michael Caine in his finest turn as Alfred, and Tom Hardy as the hulking monstrosity Bane. Hardy is a standout, and for those who insist on comparing his performance to Heath Ledger's legendary turn as the Joker; stop, the characters they played could hardly be more different. Heath Ledger's performance in TDK remains one of my favorite of all time, and deserving of his posthumous oscar. But one viewing of the sewer combat scene between batman and bane is enough to prove that this is a villain not to be trifled with, who threatens the dark knight in a powerful, physical way that the joker never could.",1354665600,6,1400,4.88655462184874

It is definitely in a league of its own and I am not hear to compare the Joker to Bane or any other differences. Dark Knight and Rises are two completely different films with to completely different focuses. As an avid Batman fan the best way to sum of the trilogy is this. Batman Begins is about fear. Dark Knight is about chaos. and Rises is about pain. The most common complaint is that there are too many characters and the film is too long. However, all all the characters were necessary to wrap up the series of events that took place in the first two films. As far as length, the film was prone to be long (this is the last batman movie for at least 5 years) and we may not see Batman again any time soon especially if there is no Justice League film. The movie follows the comics well (and for those who are unsure check out Batman Year One, Batman: Dark Knight Returns on DVD and the comic books to get greater understanding) The bonus footage is great and this film was phenomenal. Avengers may have sold more but Rises was a better film and DC can say that they do have a superhero who can gross a billion worldwide by himself (Unlike Marvel) Batman is legendary and this is a fitting close for the greatest superhero trilogy of all time.",1354579200,2,1406,4.349809885931559

This movie is an art, probably one of the best conclusions to a trilogy out there. I saw it when it came out immediately in IMAX and I had goosebumps throughout the entire thing.

The cast is wonderful, the storyline is full of twists and turns and the characters are very endearing. I also got attached to Anne Hathaway as Catwoman. She just transforms from shy, stuttering virgin, to sexy vixen in a matter of seconds in her first appearance.

Tom Hardy is a fantastic villain and the opening sequence of the movie is incredibly intense and sends the tone just straight for the movie. The other villain is very predictable, I knew immediately when I saw them that they were going to be very deceiving in the end.

I also loved the ending. This movie is fantastic, and I would hope that people whom are reviewing it, review it based on the plot not whine and moan about in what way did they purchase the movie.

4427867,4,B004LWZWGK,"Being a guy, I'm always a sucker for action adventure movies and the comic book genre has always been a favorite. I loved the Iron Man movies, the X-men were OK. I never liked any of the pre-Christian Bale Batman movies. Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, George Clooney. I like all these actors but they just weren't given a good script or director in this series.
This movie was far superior than any that have come before. 2:45 is a long movie to sit through but I was never bored. The story, the action, effects, were all good. If I have any complaints it was with the Bane character's ridiculous mask and voice. And then the 'oh so obvious' surprise betrayal of Miranda. I saw that coming the moment Bruce got cozy with her.
Other than those two things it was still the best of all the Batman movies.
Well worth the rental price and well worth watching, but I feel no desire to see it again.
I wish amazon would realize most of us feel that way about most movies. We just want to rent them, not buy them. Give us the option of just watching them once for $3.99 and not having to buy them.
My wife really got onto me about how stupid I was to be buying movies from amazon, when I could buy the DVD for the same price and never have to rely on internet access to watch them again. As happens all too often, I realized just how right she was. I won't be buying anymore movies here. Just renting. And maybe a lot more from Redbox for just $.99.

Eight years have passed since the conclusion of the previous entry, and now Bruce Wayne is seen hiding in his room, despite concerned Alfred advising him to move on. But, when a terrorist group led by Bane arrives in Gotham City, Bruce knows what he has to do. As Commissioner Gordon tells Bruce, ""Batman has to come back.""

And he does, though it takes some time. Once it happens, however, the story gets faster with more action set-pieces and some surprises. The character of Bane may not be as interesting as Heath Ledger's Joker, but he is convincing as a brutal and dangerous villain, thanks to Tom Hardy's effective performance, especially his voice.

Christian Bale comes back as Bruce Wayne / Batman. There are many new characters introduced here - Anne Hathaway's martial arts fighting thief Selina Kyle and Marion Cotillard's Miranda Tate - as well as some of the familiar faces like Morgan Freeman's Lucius Fox and Michael Caine's Alfred Pennyworth. But to me the most impressive is Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Officer Blake, who sometimes seems more heroic than Batman himself.

4427884,5,B004LWZWGK,"I still don't understand why people nit pick so much with TDKR. My only guess would be that because Nolan didn't want to make his Batman movies like others in past, with freak accidents, a bit more comicy and a little supernatural and instead to make his movies a bit more real to the real world. And I think he did a great job with that. I think people took that to literally and feel as if every small detail or problem must be able to be fitted into our real world.

4427888,5,B004LWZWGK,"All I can say is ""WOW!"" I completely missed this in the theater. My then-15-year-old daughter went to see it with her friends. She saw parts of ""The Dark Knight"" and never saw ""Batman Begins"", so I'm sure many parts didn't make sense in this movie. Yet, she still loved it and thought it was excellent.

The Dark Knight was my favorite of the first two, but I think this HAS to be the best one. What a way to end it. Definitely the best of the three movies.

I don't want to rehash the story, but let it be known that Batman does NOT make a lot of showing in this movie. It's more of Bruce Wayne and his struggles as a ""retired"" superhero. But when Bruce dons the Caped Crusader's costume, the excitement is still there. This isn't just about Batman. It's about a city and it's people, as well as many of the characters we know and love, that has lived under a lie for 8 years. A lie that was meant to help the city that eventually comes back to haunt it and the people who perpetuated that lie. Old friends and nemesis are revealed and come full circle to bring closure to the trilogy. And new characters are revealed that leave possibilities for new story lines for possible future movies. Just not sure if Mr. Nolan would be involved. But, this final movie of the trilogy does SO much justice for the entire Batman franchise.

Mr. Nolan must be commended on an awesome job well done. He pulled Batman out of the steaming pile of junk that Joel Schumacher created (never saw Batman and Robin when it came out and just last year, I TRIED to watch it and had to stop after the first 15 minutes. Just plain awful) and saved him. The Dark Knight INDEED has risen back to his rightful place as one of the best superheroes out there.",1354579200,5,1729,4.281345565749236

Well now with subtitles people's admiration for Bane will drastically increase I hope. Such a unique voice that contrasts with his figure producing quotable line after quotable line, Bane was just as entertaining a figure as the Joker in a very different way. I am hoping people will see that now that they will be able to better understand what he is saying. I hope the movie as well gets its due. It's not as tight of a script as TDK and it does have some 'but why?' moments that you would not expect from Nolan,but it was still a fantastic conclusion to one of the greatest film trilogies of all time.

But ""The Dark Knight Rises"" was almost ALL flaws.  It was clear to me that Nolan was coasting on his successes and didn't put any real work into this film, especially the script.

A lot of people really like this film, but I can't help wondering if many of them aren't simply predisposed to liking it simply because it exists:  they are so happy to get another Batman film that they have lost their ability to be objectively critical of a flawed film.  But your mileage may vary, I suppose.  A lot of people liked ""Lost"" and that show was total garbage, so there's no accounting for taste, I guess.

I can't recommend this movie, despite the nice Blu-ray presentation and a few nifty extras.  If this movie didn't have Batman in it, more people would see it for the lame piece of work it is.  So try not to be blinded by the fact that it IS a Batman movie.

And I used to think ""Inception"" was Nolan's worst and most bloated film.  ""TDKR"" makes ""Inception"" look like ""Citizen Kane"".",1354492800,4,1104,4.405940594059406

There are things I liked about this movie... but when I left the theater I didn't have the same feeling as the previous films. I walk out of Batman Begins and the Dark Knight ready to turn right around and watch them again, Dark Knight left me a little flat. I lot of the movie focused on what the police were doing. This is a Batman movie I want to see Batman for more 20 minutes out of a nearly 3 hour movie. It should have been called Bruce Wayne Rises, it would have made more sense. Of course this movie is well acted and produced.... Directing??? I think Chirstopher Nolan tryed to payoff too many storylines. Visually amazing as always and the effects and the IMAX flimed stuff were beautiful. I'm a huge Comic book fan and I love that Hollywood has discovered Comics as a source for these amazing stories. But as we've seen with Superman Return, Green Lantern, The Fantastic Four and others that a rabid nerd following doesn't mean a success.

The Dark Knight Rises is one of the greatest comic book films ever made. It shows viewers just what a test of the human spirit is like in the world of Batman mythology. There are numerous political,social,economic,& Spiritual themes on display in this final Dark Knight motion picture.

Will it win Oscars(who knows?) But TDKR is at worse a *** conclusion to probably the greatest comic book movie trilogy ever. It's also quite possibly the longest too. At 2hrs 45mins it's simply much too long & like it's prequel(The Dark Knight) far too violent for children & many teens/young Adult males. But for those of us willing & able to take the journey with Batman it's a hell of finish.

Kudos to Christopher Nolan & Christian Bale on an amazing,awe-inspiring trilogy closer.",1354492800,10,1840,5.202702702702703
4427913,5,B004LWZWGK,"Much has been said about THE DARK KNIGHT RISES; I won't pretend that anyone reading this is coming into it without some level of bias.  After all, films as popular and polarizing as Nolan's BATMAN trilogy tend to leave a serious impression, be it positive or negative.  And naturally, no one is ever going to be satisfied with the conclusion of such a series; we must contend ourselves with the fact that Nolan ends things HIS way, if not the way each of us would have wanted.

That being said, here is an obligatory recap of the plot: it's been several years since Batman took the fall for Harvey Dent's crimes.  Batman is no more, and Bruce Wayne has become a social recluse.  Commissioner Gordon lives every day with the guilt; he's become a ""dinosaur,"" a relic of an older Gotham.  The city finally knows a sense of peace...enter Bane: a ruthless criminal mastermind who seizes on Gotham's false sense of security, taking the city hostage.  The action forces Batman out of retirement, to face not only an old evil, but the understanding that even our greatest heroes must ultimately meet their end.

RISES is not on par with THE DARK KNIGHT; suffice it to say, DARK KNIGHT is a near-impossible film to top.  If we can get beyond that, we can examine and judge this film on its own merits.  While we lack a villain as truly engaging as the Joker, we get Tom Hardy's Bane: a truly hulking, menacing, unpredictable rogue, guided by his own sense of justice. With only his eyes and his physicality, Hardy pretty much out-acts everyone here, which is saying something when you're opposite Christian Bale, giving us his best Bruce Wayne to date.  We've also got Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine returning from earlier films (the latter deserves an Oscar nomination); making welcome, if not entirely fleshed-out additions are Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, and Matthew Modine.  Aside from Hardy, the true standout of the new arrivals is Anne Hathaway's Selina Kyle, a revisionist take on Catwoman (the name is never used); Hathaway steals every scene she's in, chewing her way through the material and oozing a sense of intrigue and sensuality.  While we're never really in doubt about where her heart lies, the character is still perfectly drawn; anyone who had doubts about how Nolan would incorporate Catwoman into his world can rest easy.

THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is not without its flaws.  As with all of Chris Nolan's blockbusters, pacing is an issue, with time changes coming swiftly and with little notification; also, the final climactic scene is filmed in ""real time,"" but this is only possible due to many cuts (it's basically the longest two minutes ever), and as such doesn't come off as very realistic.  Realism was what made DARK KNIGHT so suspenseful; here, realism is in shorter supply, and viewers are forced to suspend their disbelief a little longer.  Similarly, the political ideology here (it's subtextual; don't worry, Nolan isn't browbeating anyone) is at odds with the film's predecessor, making for a slightly uneven transition.  Still, all of this aside, this is a fantastic film.  Nolan's Batman saga has its ups and downs, but he ends the trilogy with a (literal) bang.  Perhaps a tad overlong, and maybe a bit too epic (following its intimately personal predecessor), THE DARK KNIGHT RISES swings for the fences and, if it doesn't hit a home run, it's at least a standing triple.  A solid conclusion to arguably the best superhero franchise of all time.",1354406400,10,3487,4.856418918918919

""The Dark Knight Rises"" was the longest 3 hours of a movie EVER. It's depressing, it lacks intensity and frankly you just want to run and hit Batman with his own cane.
Perhaps my criticism of this movie is masked because of the near perfection of ""The Dark Knight"" and the intensity of all characters involved: Batman, Rachel, Harvey Dent, Joker, even Commissioner Gordan was intense. This Batman just missed it... but watch it for yourself if you must, 3 hours you'll never get back.",1354406400,9,602,4.688679245283019

Sign up for a Vudu account on vudu.com.  Then when you fill in the code (on whatever website the movie tells you) select the Vudu option (most all of them work with Vudu at this point).  The movie will appear on your Vudu list within the hour.  You can then download the movie to your PC with the Vudu To Go application.  This allows you to have all your digital copies in one place AND gives you the ability to download them.  Hopefully people will stop 1-starring movies due to limitations that aren't really there.

As far as the movie goes, it was a great ending to the trilogy.  It doesn't match Dark Knight in terms of overall quality, but that would have been nearly impossible.

You may disagree with some things I have to say and you may not, but the important thing is that you remember reviews are opinionated, and if you really want to know if something is good or not, the only way to truly know is to judge it for yourself.

That being said I think this is the best film I have ever seen. Yes, it has some continuity errors and a few other slight issues, but overall it is epic, inspiring, filled with action and driven by interesting characters who you can easily sympathise for. The length (about three hours) is only a testament to its overall strength and grand scale. It is believable and realistic, or as realistic as a Batman film can be. The look of it is brilliant, and it shows you a world that you don't quite want to leave. Whether you have entire boxes filled with DVD's that you still haven't figured out what to do with or you just like a good movie once in a while, its worth giving this film a good watch.

Every time I comment on Ultra-Violet and how I am unhappy with it, I always get comments from people about how unfair my rating is, and that I should change it.

I will continue to rate movies that come without an i-Tunes digital copy, but that come with an ultra-violet copy, with a low rating.  Ultra-violet is a terrible system for digital copies.  Living in a rural part of the country, I don't have access to data speeds that support streaming a movie every single time.  I fly on airplanes and want to watch my movies also.  And I don't want to use my mobile data to stream a movie I already bought.  Ultra-violet is a sham, and I bought one movie to try it with, and will never purchase another.

With that being said, this movie is fantastic.  I will purchase the movie from the i-Tunes store and support my purchase with the format I approve of.  And while I would love to have a physical disc to play this movie with, I will not be purchasing the DVD's unless they include an i-Tunes copy.

Look how strong the Matrix started and then fell way off. Star Wars, Star Trek, and so many others did not deliver great movies all through their series. Lord Of The Rings is as close as it gets for a great trio, but even it is flawed. I feel like some are putting the bar extra high after how impressive The Dark Knight did. The Dark Knight Rises is a good film. The biggest disappointment is how predictable the finish was, which is not very Nolan like. For such a Maverick film maker, this final installment just did not have that original spin Nolan films often have.

Bottom line, if you love the first two, this is worth getting. If you thought the first two were okay, then this is a rental at best.",1354233600,3,853,4.298136645962733
4427923,2,B004LWZWGK,"*Warning: Spoilers*

First, let me just go ahead and set aside the inconsistencies between the events of TDK and the setting of TDKR and simply review the movie itself. I thought that it started well. The beginning felt a bit slow at times but the events were relevant to the overall plot of the movie. It got better and better until the scene where Batman finally shows up on the bike, and then I thought ""This movie is going to be epic!"" Unfortunately, that was where it peaked. Following that scene, it slowly devolved into a weak and strung out film that wasn't really sure where it wanted to go; multiple scenes at the ""courthouse"", random shots of the bomb being driven around, an unnecessary side plot of special forces guys trying to infiltrate the city, Bruce trying over and over to get out of the pit, police officers eating food in the sewer, and why or when did Batman spend time drawing up the bat-symbol on the bridge when there was only hours left until the bomb exploded?

I also felt bringing in the world at large was a mistake. Batman was always at its best when it was about Gotham's struggles, and the dynamic between Batman and the villains within that microcosm. Bringing in the military and special forces and all that cheapened the film and his role. It also seems like a nuclear bomb on the loose would be a problem that the country would take a little more seriously that ""ok we'll block the roads and give you whatever you want and sneak in 3 (really? only 3?) special forces guys, and when that fails we'll hope that Batman sneaks back in and saves the city."" It just wasn't plausible. There's a couple different ways they could have easily kept the same story line without have to bring in outside players.

All in all I thought it started down the right track, but drug on longer than needed and was a so-so finale to the Christian Bale Batman era.",1354233600,6,1880,4.475218658892128

Also, Amazon is for reviewing the entire product; this isn't freaking Rotten Tomatoes.  I feel my complaint is just, as many of you may if you rely on digital copies.

You not only have to create an Ultraviolet account, but an account with each separate publisher, e.g. Warner, Fox, Disney, etc ad infinitum

So, you end up with many many accounts.

Then, you cannot actually download your movie.  You stream it.  So, while it IS technically a digital copy, it defeats the (oft) purpose of owning a digital copy, i.e. taking it with you on the go (think: airplane, long train ride, vacation, etc).

Along the same lines, you thus are unable to play the movie on an iPod.  Also, don't even think about adding this to your iTunes collection-impossible.

Fail. I will honestly never purchase a movie that has Ultraviolet

Lastly, the movie is a great ending to the trilogy, and if this movie isn't on your list of must-owns already, then you should remedy that pronto =)",1354233600,53,1124,4.654822335025381

4427937,4,B004LWZWGK,"The first thing people asked me when I told them I had seen "" The Dark Knight Rises "" was..is it as good as The Dark Knight ?  I couldn't really answer since they are two distinctly different movies and TDKR actually contains plot elements that started in "" Batman Begins "".  It would be impossible to top Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker so for that reason alone I suspect that most viewers' fave of the trilogy will always be TDK.  Having said that,the character of Banes is just as terrifying in that his is a much more calculated and intentional string of crimes. The scene where he beats Batman to a pulp is disturbing and hard to watch but makes the hero's eventual rise from the proverbial ashes that much more satisfying.
  There are plot twists that you don't see coming,a sneak peak at what could ( hopefully ) be a sort of spin off from this series,and a truly clever ending that leaves you wondering up until the last few moments of the film.
  As for the ""elephant in the room ""..it is a shame that,for some people anyway,this movie will forever be tied to the awful,cowardly,heartbreaking events in that movie theater in Colorado. I talked to people who refused to see this cinematic masterpiece in a proper theater because of some fear of the same thing happening again. These folks really missed out. This is one of those films that needs to be seen on a huge screen in all it's IMAX ,full blown,epic glory. I will be genuinely surprised if this movie doesn't get some nods at Oscar time. In my opinion,this is Bale's best performance as the Caped Crusader and Gary Oldman is,again,just splendid as Commissioner Gordon. Joseph-Gordon Levitt is fantastic as...well...a police officer ( I don't want to spoil it for those people that haven't seen the movie yet ).  This is a fitting end to an amazing series of films.

4427940,2,B004LWZWGK,"When I first caught a glance at the trailer for this film, I thought to myself, ""Why the heck is the Batmobile flying?... this movie is going to be terrible"" but then I caught the next trailer of Bane blowing up a football field and I thought, ""It might be OK after-all""? Flying from Bali to Australia, I had 5 hours to kill, and we had hired an Ipad to watch movies on, and this movie was the one I was looking forward to the most... I dunno, maybe I expected it to be a major blockbuster just as good as the first two Batman movies of this directors imagination, but third time turns out to not be a charm for everyone.

The Dark Knight Rises or Batman 3 doesn't start off too well as Bane and his men hijack a plain to kidnap a nuclear physicist. The scene is ok, but doesn't create a mind blowing beginning to a movie. The background scenery was nice, the idea was there, but it felt rather too unrealistic to be possible to happen in the real world, and what made it worse was no more action comes along in the movie for quite some time from then. The plot of this movie takes place 8 years after the last movie. Bruce Wayne has hung up the Bat Cow and retired into his own misery. Which makes me wonder if spin offs of Bat Girl are going to be the next set of movies to come along of what happened in that 8 year gap? Anyway, Bane comes to Gothom City and tears up the joint, forcing Batman to get back into shape and hit the town again. Bane uncovers an unused speech from Commissioner Gordon that reveals the truth about Harvey ""Two Face"" Dent and exposes it to the city during his ""blow up the town"" campaign. The kid from ""3rd Rock from The Sun"" is a hot headed police officer who idolizes Batman and knows who he is... no big secret by now even if you haven't seen the movie, but heard people talking about who he will be most likely playing in the future spin off. Also Catwoman joins the adventure, and tho some people have dismissed her as not being hot enough to play Cat Woman, I did like the fact that she is a cat burglar, and thats how she adopts the name... and that's about the only decent idea I think this movie had.

Batman calls upon Morgan Freeman once again to show him some nifty gadgets the army made a prototype of, but never used, even tho they work so perfectly! This time Batman has a flying machine that has enough firepower to take out a Tumbler! 3 or 4 to be precise! Holy Cow Batman, i'd slap Morgan Freeman around for not showing you that thing sooner! Like I said before, it looked stupid to me in the trailers, but when you realize this flying vehicle may be slightly plausible on the way it operates as a hover copter sort of vehicle, you can suspend belief for a moment and accept it, but then when Hollyweed get there dirty little paws on it and say, ""Lets have it act like a jet plane with enough firepower to blow roofs off of buildings"" well, yeah... you're pushing it too far and trying to hard to make a kids movie more than a teen or adult action flick.

What Bane does to the City and the speeches he gives are just... I wish I could swear on here to express my utter disgust in just how embarrassing it must have been for all the actors and crew of this movie to see the final results. Bane's speeches and voice is just eff in g terrible. Catwoman was a pretty disappointing role too. It wasn't her look or acting, infact I liked that the look was more like the 1960's Catwomen of Lee Meridith, Ertha Kitt and Julie Newmar (however you spell their names). But it was the script she was given that failed to satisfy fans. Especially the ending.

Any fans of Stargate excited to hear that Christopher Judge makes an appearance (Teal'c), expect to be VERY disappointed in the 12 seconds he is on screen. Obi Whan Kenobi stops by for a flashback, and The Scarecrow has a brief moment or two for some comic relief. The rest is filled with a story that could have been so much better than the over the top rubbish that was filmed and exposed here in Dark Knight Rises Eventually.

Overall, the weakest of the trilogy. Too much talking and boring dialog, stupid speeches and not much excitement. This bat has flown high, gotten tired, stopped flapping, gone into a noise dive and crashed pretty hard into the ground... oh, and ""trilogy?""... nah, I expect Penguin and Riddler will be next, gotta help set up Robin and Batgirl for the spin off's, probably even set up Huntress and make 6 spin off movies, then combine them all for one big Bat Marathon of Super Bat Avengers taking on all the bad guys that aren't dead yet.

You have to calm down and look at what you have here- Not only the Blu-Ray for your 1080p TV needs but the standard definition DVD as well to go with the code. First let me say I am an iPhone & iPad owner but one thing we have to keep in mind is that not everybody has one or either of these devices. Typical of Apple users, we think we are the only people in existence that are on the right side when Apple is one of the biggest companies that limit our usage in one way or another other. Not only can you stream the Ultraviolet copy on the Apple devices, you can download each one to put on whatever you device you have. Sure, it takes a little longer (about 15 minutes) but it can be done, I have done it. Next- Read the package or product description. It says Ultraviolet Digital Copy not Digital Copy. In my eyes, the straight digital copy is almost useless to me and about 75% of the planet. If you have a smart TV or set top streaming box or a Google TV then you should have access to Vudu or Flixster or any of the other services that are UV compatible. I can access my account from ANYBODY's TV or box and watch a UV title and you are complaining that you can't watch this on a 9.7"" screen? Give me a break, hardly anybody watches a film on a screen that small so much that they are fighting for its existence against a superior format. All that you folks are succeeding in doing here is actually reducing the rating level on the FILM ITSELF, not what is inside the case! Out of the (at this time) 46 negative reviews, most are only about the digital copy. Maybe do a little research first, not just on the item you are buying but also on a newer format that you don't understand instead of ripping on it because it threatens your 10"" screens. We don't like what we don't understand therefore we will not embrace it, such as the case here.  I hated UV, hated it!  Until I actually read what it was, what it was capable of and who was backing it. When the big 4 studios and a bunch of the others are behind it then we can assume this may be around for a while, it could very well be the whole future of home video. I am not only buying UV titles but also titles from retailers like Amazon that are strictly in the cloud. This isn't for everyone by any stretch but it will be once ISP's get put in their place & the cost per film gets reduced more, which has been the case lately. If you are an iWhatever user then buy your films from iTunes, simple as that. If you have an Apple TV box you can watch them on an actual screen where you don't need to squint to catch the finer details.  I don't just own an iPad & and iPhone, I own a Kindle Fire HD, Apple TV box, Nexus 7 tablet, Roku box and a few other devices that have given me the opportunity to try all formats and in my opinion, this is the best route right now. They are giving us the best of both worlds, physical & digital. I thank those who took the time to read this and do not take what I am saying here the wrong way, just use a different forum. Best way to rail against something new is to not buy it. Though I think once you give it a try you will come to like it's convenience. Or not, but give it a try first. Adapt or die as they say.

4427942,5,B004LWZWGK,"Christopher Nolan's iteration of the Dark Knight began in 2005 with Batman Begins, redeeming the franchise after Joel Schumacher's campy affair with Batman and Robin. The Dark Knight Rises is the third film of the series and serves as the finale, without a doubt it's of the largest scale. A terrifying villain stirred with a militia against an altruistic hero despised by the city he yearns to save. Thousands of people trampling through war ravished streets, an aerially high jacking of a plane, the things of a blockbuster, but with soul. The film carefully caresses deeper plot points; viewers may find the emotional scenes left burning in their mind while explosions continue to spread on screen.

The Dark Knight Rises does not pick up right after the events of The Dark Knight, in fact, it has been eight years without The Batman and Gotham is doing just fine. Following the departure of Gotham's White Knight Harvey Dent, the Dent act was established, coinciding a honorary holiday founded on a little white lie about his demise. Commissioner Gordon holds attendance at the event, painfully recollecting what happened that night eight years ago, debating whether or not it's time to reveal the truth.

Seems detective Blake, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, has a hunch on what happened that night. Hot headed as he may be, his time on screen is not wasted, and he helps the audience get to the bottom of many character arcs. He is one of the few to still see Batman as an icon, a symbol of hope. This is a key point in the film as themes throughout deal with pain, false hope, and redemption.
Bruce Wayne is now a limping Hughes imbued figure that quickly permeates back to the social scene taking on his juggled persona of well Bruce Wayne ""eccentric billionaire"". Christian Bale has received a lot of flak for his role as Batman, especially for the `voice', but as Bruce he is pretty sympathetic. New comer Miranda Tate attempts to bring Bruce back to room temp, feeling he has become a recluse due to a failed project. In many ways this film stretches its history back to the first film of the trilogy while acknowledging what made the Dark Knight so enticing to watch.

Bruce is dealing with a dilemma, is Batman truly needed again? This not the same energetic Bruce, he dons a Ra's Al Ghul like beard, and only sparks to the Batcave when personal interest is at foot. He contemplates folding, he is brash, and as Alfred, Bruce's butler and all in one family, believes any attempts to wear the cape and cowl are an excuse, a far cry for help, and a death wish. Their complex relationship while briefly touched upon in this film is still deeply felt. Michael Caine could not have made for a better Alfred, displaying real concern, the wisdom of a father, and the sympathy of mother.
On the other side, better yet, the underside of Gotham resides Bane. Bane is menacing, bronze only bested by hi wit. His hulking physique would have one misidentify his voice and choice of words with a tooth pick scholar, creating a unique villain. Nolan's Bane is not a grunting leather suited goober; Nolan's Bane is a terrorist who leads mercenaries that are willing to take a punch for him before even thinking about punching off the clock. Tom Hardy nailed his performance, Bane's face may be shrouded in mystery due to the metallic contraption on his face, but what little you can see, especially the intensity in his eyes, let you know doom waits.

Anne Hathaway's slinky stature as Selina Kyle is mesmerizing. No she is not Catwoman per say but the idea is addressed in fashion, literally goggles that when pulled up resemble cat ears. Hathaway is seductive, quick to respond...and is also a jewel thief. Her role is vital in the beginning and is then seen less and less, as if her charm was too potent, and the cast elsewhere needed to be shown. Her chemistry with Christian Bale may be a hit or miss with some audience, I for one wanted to see more. A hurt and numbed Bruce talking to a callous and careful Selina had me reeling. Selina Kyle has her own agenda and perceives Bruce to be a typical playboy, which is fair considering he too plays into it for the media.
Batman now has a pet bat, one that weighs a few tons and seats two. Thank Luscious Fox and his team for always inventing the latest gadgetry. The military outfitted tumbler can be seen with a new paint job, and the batpod looks as though it was made for Selina. An emp like device makes its way into the film and one new device that would be too much of a plot device to reveal in a review.

The films audio is outstanding. Hans Zimmer's percussive elements really bring out the flare of the fire starting, the chanting inside the pit, echo and raise with such intensity the tempo increases, everything increases one might even pass out... and at times the pulse stops after the barbaric beats. Batmans theme is still epic, motivating, and triumphant. Banes voice was dubbed to be clearer, it's infectious, expect to walk out and perform a Bane impersonation or two, no worries it subsides. Cop ambiance is absorbed by the Bat taking off with its frighteningly loud entrance. Gun shots heat cold midnight air, rounds clang and rattle. Banes punches provide a impact and the audio is there to pick up the remains.
All coolness aside, the film is truly about Bruce rising, about the people of Gotham rising, about the ascendancy needed to live in a world without the need for a constant savior. The movie is not a full throttle action film, but it has enough action to pass as one. When Bane and Batman meet, it is both disturbing and alarming. This is the end game for Nolan's trilogy and it literally goes out with a bang.

Have fun, so many get caught up on `plot holes' they as might as well pigeon hole themselves in criticizing whatever new film is received with high regards. Nothing wrong with not enjoying this film, Batman is hardly in the film, it does throw a few hard to hit curve balls, Blake's all knowingness is a bit cheap.

Enjoy the 70mm film, take in the audio, know what you are viewing is not completely all cgi. Those guys dangling on a plane, the football stadium rupture, Wall street rundown, not cgi. Say it was though, it would still make for an enjoyable film. My favorite album is fine as is whether it's analog vinyl or digital mp3. This is where Nolan succeeds, he made a good movie independent on the notion of explosions and effects are everything.

Batman Begins and The Dark Knight were great films but The Dark Knight Rises was not on par. It's full of holes in an already weak plot.
- No one notices that batman and Bruce both disappear at the exact same time for the same amount of time then return at the same time.
- An already half crippled Bruce gets his ass beat nearly to death but manages to escape prison by climbing and jumping.
- All it took to turn everyone in Gotham into a post apocalyptic nut job was telling them that batman wasn't the bad guy.
- Bane holds the city hostage with a nuke for three months for no reason.
- Bane and Ra's al Ghul's daughter are going to blow them selves up for no reason.
- Thousands of cops survived under ground for three months.
- Cops armed with hand guns and sticks attack terrorist with assault rifle and some how win.
- Batman manages to take a bomb more than 60 miles(the blast radius of the nuke) in only 1 minute.
- In that same minute, he manages to get out of the batwing without stopping even though we see him in the cockpit seconds before the nuke goes off.
- He lets Alfred think he's dead which was just a real a-hole move.
- He leaves all his bat gear to Blake who doesn't know how to use it, has no one to teach him, and wasn't trained by a league of assassins.
- And he thinks that no one will notice that both batman and Bruce Wayne died on the same day.

4427967,3,B004LWZWGK,"This movie is solid to the rest, but very depressing. I don't know who started the dark bad ending writing, Stephen King, or someone, but people now days think everything must have a cost, or bad ending to be realistic. They think fairy tale endings are bad writing, but that is not always true. Especially in comic book heroes. A good writer can also put his cost through the series, and then have your happy ending. A bad ending does not always equal good writing. This writer is sold on this new age of insanity that thinks everything must have a depressing ending to be realistic. I will spoil the sad and stupid stuff below, but here are a couple things his writing did do. We get little of Batman. I beleive it was way into the movie, thirty minutes or more, before we even saw him. When we do, he is often broken down and nearly crippled. Catwoman, Anne Hathaway, is nothing like you expect, though she did steal the show. She was the one bright spot to this movie that kept it going while Batman was missing in action. A few more actors did really good, and look to have a solid acting future, but... They aren't Batman. Would I watch it again? Yes, but mostly to see Catwoman, and other cool stuff. I could not sit through the whole thing again, but some scenes may catch my eye when it's on TV. With nothing else on.

  SPOLIER.. Batman, pays the cost in this one. As if he didn't pay enough in the others right? He is broken down, nearly crippled, and severely depressed or some other mental illness. That's not enough. Halfway through the movie, the bad guys use his finger print to invest everything he owns. The stock market crashes and he is bankrupt. Loosing nearly everything. This.. I don't even think it's possible. The police and everyone knew it was a fake print. That means it's a fraud and he shouldn't owe a penny. International laws or not, I simply wouldn't pay it. No matter how you look at it, this was idiotic.. Yet we need more cost. He gets sold out and tricked twice by allies, spending at least fifteen movie minutes in a jail. Then the ending. A self sacrifice as he flies the nuclear bomb of and blows up with it. Saving millions, and dying the hero death. This is ok. It's been done a lot, but a good way to end things, but not with a whole movie full of depressing things. Maybe not in a comic book at all. I'd take the ending or his being crippled, and take the other two out. Any of those sad cost he has paid are enough. When you put to much, you have to wonder if the writer himself is insane or a criminal. A very dark mind to put all of this in. He's not of coarse. He's just copying what is popular in the world right now. Which is.. Selling out in my opinion. Pretty soon we'll shift back to where everyone has to write fairy tales for it to be realistic. We need more balance, and originality. A good mix.",1353801600,,2851,4.275925925925926

Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman were both equally as great as they have been in the previous two movies. Anne Hathaway portrayed Selina Kyle very memorably; I think she and Christian Bale have good chemistry. NOW, my complaint with The Dark Knight Rises is Marion Cotillard. I feel that they did not give enough time for character development with her character Miranda Tate. The plot does has some unexpected twists that will surprise you.

4427975,3,B004LWZWGK,"Christopher Nolan's latest and last installment of his revamped Batman trilogy, The Dark Knight Rises, is arguably the film with the most heart of the trio. This is more of a cerebral film than its predecessors. You will not see as much of Batman as before, however you will see more Bruce Wayne. You will not see the level of gritty violence or drawn-out brawling that The Dark Knight. delivered. You will also, sadly, not see Heath Ledger. You will, however, see the Dark Knight rise.

Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale or, as some websites like to call him, ""BatBale"") is a broken man, both mentally and physically. He is recovering from his injuries endured at the end of The Dark Knight, as well as his broken heart. When Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) takes him by surprise by robbing his ""uncrackable"" safe and stealing his mother's necklace, along with reports of Bane (Tom Hardy) causing some serious trouble in Gotham City, Bruce is inspired to once again don the mask and become the Batman.

Alfred (Michael Caine) fears for Bruce, so he leaves Wayne Manor in an attempt to provide Bruce with some clarity. This act of tough love is immediately swallowed up in the simmering peril lurking quite literally beneath the city. Bane is about to rain more terror and brutality on the city of Gotham than we have seen it encounter thus far and, for the first time, Batman might not be enough to stop him.

Hathaway makes an excellent Catwoman, and thankfully, because Nolan is a master of subtlety, she is never actually titled as such, nor is she dressed like a fool. She is quick, both in wit and fight, and she reinvents a character that seemed beyond saving after the crap-fest that was Halle Berry's Catwoman. Best of all, she is believable.

Hardy's Bane is a magnetic villain. I never had much interest in the character, yet I found myself anticipating his next scene. A major theme in this film is that we should not let our emotions control us, particularly our anger. While Bruce Wayne fights his own stubborn will to accomplish this task, we can see why, like the Joker, Bane is the polar opposite of Batman. Although while the Joker may have had no other motive than to ""watch the world burn"", Bane's motivation is more rational and understandable. While we both loved Ledger's Joker and anticipated his demise, we find ourselves caught off-guard in that we can honestly sympathize with Bane.

Gary Oldman is respectable once again as Commissioner Gordon, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, an actor whose work I would always gladly watch twice, was excellent as John Blake. Gordon-Levitt is an actor who rarely, if ever, lets me down. His presence in a film is almost a guarantee that it will not suck.

Marion Cotillard was satisfying as Miranda, although I couldn't seem to separate her from her role alongside Gordon-Levitt in Inception. The female leads in these Batman films always fall flat for me. Keep an eye out for a cameo from a character we have seen in previous films who may or may not surprise you in presence alone, but who delivers one of the funnier lines of the film.

Oldman and Gordon-Levitt (like Bale, Morgan Freeman, Hathaway, heck every actor in this film), never fail to capture your belief in their performances. These actors don't just act; they become the characters they play. This is appreciable when a film wants to transport you to a different world and actually takes you there.

Some have complained that The Dark Knight Rises suffers from being stretched too thin, and that it did not need to be a two hour and forty-four minute film. I will argue that this film is akin to the television series ""Mad Men"": it simmers for a while at a slow boil, but when it finally comes to a head, you will not regret one minute of your time spent. Much of the film is spent sitting at the edge of a seat, knowing something explosive is coming yet unsure of when.

One of the selling points for me to see this film, as if I needed one, was that since I had not seen it on opening weekend, everyone I knew had already seen it and told me that the last few scenes made the movie. They were correct. I never thought I'd cry at a Batman film, and that is not only a testament to how solidly Nolan can build a foundation, but how he can also properly finish what he started. Nolan was able to finish his opus with the same levels of grace and closure that we have come to expect from such a master filmmaker.",1353628800,4,4423,4.567465321563682
4427976,4,B004LWZWGK,"The title is a fancy way to say that Batman is back. Did the world need another Batman movie? No. But Wayne Enterprises; a multi-billion-dollar company owned by Bruce Wayne himself; is going bankrupt and popular superhero movies; this is the third in what is now a Christopher Nolan trilogy; make an insane amount of money. Two Face is dead and The Joker, a character who should've been mentioned if not given a cameo appearance, is in prison. Enter Bane, a strong vicious beast of a man with a gas mask stuck to his face. He wears it for a reason, but it muffles his voice sometimes to the point of being unintelligible.

Not that these characters, including Anne Hathaway as a sexy Catwoman, ever have anything poignant to say. Christopher Nolan is a lot better at directing fight scenes than composing dialogue. So the fast-cut plot, riddled with minor plot-holes and unnecessary turns; Gotham City facing its demise in the form of a nuclear bomb is the gist; gets saved by its exciting and often violent action scenes. Most, if not all, of them coincide with epic Hans Zimmer orchestral music, yes; and the new flying bat-toy is kind of cool; but this Dark Knight, while entertaining, is a sequel that doesn't quite match the level of its predecessor.

4427977,4,B004LWZWGK,"Bruce Wayne: ""You're afraid that if I go back out there, I'll fail.""
Alfred Pennyworth: ""No. I'm afraid that you want to.""

The Dark Knight Rises (2012) was without doubt one of the most realistically spectacular movies around. No mere CGI extravaganza, it presented audiences with a vision of total anarchy and the complete upheaval of society. One could even say that Dark Knight Rises is the logical realization and completion of the nightmare presented in The Dark Knight (2008).

What follows is less a 'product review' than a politico-philosophical re-viewing of the movie. From a filmographic perspective, I didn't feel this movie was ALL that much to shout about. A good sound-track, a grand plot and complex characters was, IMO, partially deflated by over-length and insufficient action. Bane and Batman boxing each other towards the end simply didn't ""fit"" a grand finale. Nevertheless, I've given the movie 4 stars for the political questions it taunts sensitive viewers with, especially in an era of 'OCCUPY' movement, growing global inequality and so on. A good movie interacts with its socio-political context. If nothing else, Dark Knight Rises does exactly this.

a) Gotham, Batman & Unknown Knowns

We can begin by contrasting the two villains. Bane is most unlike the Joker. Yet in a powerful way Bane is the fulfillment of the Joker's being and agenda. In the earlier movie, the identity of Batman was one of the central riddles the Joker was trying to resolve i.e. it was a known un-known (something we realise we don't yet know and hence want to find out). In DK-Rises, however, Batman himself was fighting to defeat a trauma (of identity, of purpose, of possibility) he had locked away for eight years i.e. it's a unknown known (something we REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE we know and hence have to undergo some crisis in order to re-know this `thing').

For the Joker, Batman was the obstacle to chaos in the city; for Bane, Batman and the city are synonymous. Bruce Wayne's reclusive behavior mirrored the `eyes wide shut' condition of Gotham which kept on singing the praises of Harvey Dent (an insane murderer), encouraged by of all people its chief of police. Wayne's problem from the start was that, as per Alfred's words, he wanted to fail but didn't know it. Likewise, Gotham, like any modern-day metropolis or Capitalism as a whole, seems all too determined to succeed whilst secretly or unconsciously being hell bent on destroying itself. This is why Bane treated Batman (or Bruce Wayne) in virtually the same way he treated the city: bring him to his knees, let him suffer slowly, with death coming only after a prolonged period. Bane needed Wayne and Gotham to see clearly and without any doubt whatsoever the disavowed rot at the kernel of their being.

If there is one thing more frightful than a terrifying truth that has remained concealed from the public, it's the publicly known truth that has remained unspoken. So a big question for societies is: What else do we ALL know full well yet cannot bear to hear repeated out loud?

b) The Good, The Bad & The Real

Bane, in many senses, was a clear `improvement' over the Joker. The Joker threatened anarchy; Bane delivered it. The Joker tried (and failed) to demonstrate that individuals were at heart completely selfish; Bane successfully revealed that at the heart of society was an impossible trauma (even as he managed to bring Batman to his lowest depths). The Joker sought to show that inside a good man, there is only bad; Bane made it clear that what we understand as Good (e.g. the justice system) is really the Bad (e.g. the unjust political `carving up' of the city) in another form. Thus, DK-Rises shows us what we choose everyday to half-ignore : the hypocrisy of the rule of law in outlawing everything except its own transgressions.

The Joker transformed the city's White Knight (i.e. Harvey Dent) into its traitor; Bane showed that the city itself, Gotham, was an intra-social betrayal on a massive scale. The betrayal of the people (in the form of community-wide lies, political corruption and so on), far from being a threat to the city, in fact, constituted it and sustained its being.
The Joker manipulated the police; Bane tore up the very idea of the police. The Joker tried to rope in the city's criminals; Bane made it a crime not to be a criminal and thus exposed the biggest crime of all: society itself. The scene in DK-Rises where a psychopathic doctor presides over a kangaroo court and sentences all the former VIPs' and public officials to death (or exile) is striking, for is it not simply the fantasmatic inverse of actual court proceedings? Don't we urgently require a ""Bane event"" for the very criminals who at present use the law to justify their crimes?

And can't the scene where Bane released all the prisoners, far from suggesting the terror of a society overrun by convicted criminals, hint at redemptive Biblical notions of `setting prisoners free'? Simply imagine the words `GTMO' in the background. To the extent that political change relies on the Law, is it not apparent that no true change can happen without the death and rebirth of the Law itself?

The Dark Knight Rises hints that true transformation may need more than sincere politicians, better police, more integrated technology, cleaner elections or even a masked vigilante. True change requires a deep glimpse of the destruction that's forthcoming. True change requires a broken body and prolonged suffering in loneliness and hopelessness. True change may even mean that our bridges to the outside world (or practical escape route out of a pit-prison) are destroyed so we're forced to look inwards and face the truth we've chosen to un-know over time. A real rising requires a real death.

In short, the movie ultimately provokes us to question what's good, what's bad, what isn't real and what it takes to make all things Real again. Most of all, it reminds us of the consequences of sticking to the status quo. What happens if we persist in lying to ourselves? What's the future like if the truly bad guys are venerated as good and vice-versa? Christopher Nolan's answer seems clear: We either continue living like a prisoner - or we face a nuclear winter.",1353542400,11,6243,4.868173258003766

4427980,3,B004LWZWGK,"By now even those who dislike Christopher Nolan's Batman triptych have been so beaten into submission that, in lieu of screaming ""uncle,"" they have conceded that the trio of films serve as a sort of repository of all of the anxieties running through the first decade or so of the new millennium.  They may disagree about the quality of the films themselves, but after seven years everyone agrees that these movies have established themselves as important cultural artifacts.  In particular, I've enjoyed that Nolan has somehow managed to hoist his personal vision of the world in front of millions and it has still connected with large swaths of audiences.  The blockbuster as personal missive approach to filmmaking has become increasingly rare, because either the audience or the studio have rejected those directors (see: Lee's Hulk, Singer's Superman Returns, and Raimi's Spiderman series).  These days it seems as if Nolan is one of a few directors with the clout to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on his own personal vision.

So where does The Dark Knight Rises, the epic finale square with its predecessors?  Does it consistently meld its fantastical premise with a real world aesthetic like Begins?  Does it successfully tangle with questions of ethics like the sequel?  Well, not exactly.  At two hours and forty-five minutes, the film is unwieldy (how could it not be).  But it still manages to stick its landing, providing a satisfying and logical conclusion to one of the most distinct movie series of the last ten years.

The Dark Knight Rises plays out like a dialectic of the first two films, stringing along the two main threads of the previous installments - the League of Shadow's terrorist attack and the moral fall and death of Harvey Dent - and combining them.  Because the people of Gotham still believe in Harvey Dent's martyrdom, the lie concocted by Batman and Gordon at the end of The Dark Knight, they have come together and passed something called the ""Dent Act,"" which has helped clear the streets of criminals.  It isn't exactly clear what was in the Dent act, but apparently it was controversial enough for some politicians to push for repeal.  The dramatic cut in crime has formed a city that no longer needs Batman as its protector, and Bruce Wayne hasn't worn the cape and cowl since the end of the second film, eight years ago in movie time.  After a stunningly shot jail break in mid air, the film opens with a large gala at the Wayne mansion, but Wayne himself is absent, leading one party-goer to suggest that he may be growing out his finger nails and filling jars with urine in solidarity with Howard Hughes.

During the gala one of the maids, suspiciously played by the headlining starlet Anne Hathaway, makes her way into a largely abandoned wing of Wayne manor.  Of course, Hathaway is playing Selina Kyle, better known as Catwoman (although that name is never used).  And after a confrontation with her reclusive host, she slips out with some pearls and copies of Bruce Wayne's finger prints.  The pearls are for her while the fingerprints are for a mysterious new player in Gotham who happen to be a front for the League of Shadow, the same terrorist organization that trained Bruce Wayne and then later attempted to destroy Gotham in the first film.

Like a lot of people, I was skeptical of Hathaway's ability to play Catwoman.  She has a tendency to find roles that take advantage of her mostly chipper attitude, and I wasn't sure she would be able to convincingly beat up guys twice her size on screen.  Luckily, my skepticism was misplaced.  Hathaway is easily one of the best elements of the movie.  Most of Nolan's Batman films are shrouded in a decidedly pessimistic view of humanity, an element that is both refreshing in a blockbuster but also, at times, oppressive.  Hathaway provides a respite from the heavier aspects of Rises because she's one of the few characters who seems to actually enjoy herself from time to time.  When she first stumbles upon Wayne during her burglary she starts by playing innocent, but when he calls her out on her lying Hathaway's entire demeanor shifts, from the way she speaks to how she holds herself.  Throughout the film Hathaway plays Selina Kyle as mercurial, and we never really know which side she's on or whether or not she has gained or lost the upper hand.

The central antagonist, however, is Bane, the new leader of the League of Shadows.  Rumors about Bane suggest that he comes from a prison pit in one of the more brutal corners of the world.  It is nearly impossible for any prisoner to scale this pit and gain his freedom, and although many of tried, Bane is the only one who has made it out alive.  Bane's approach to leading the League of Shadows is different from Ra's al Ghul's.  Where Ra's obscured the violence of the terrorist group through reasonable sounding rhetoric and Liam Neesom's proper British accent, Bane himself appears to be brutality incarnate.  Without hesitation he guns civilians down but seems to prefer killing people with his bare hands.

His followers also have a religious-like devotion, dutifully sacrificing their lives upon a simple request, which Bane makes in the same perfunctory manner that a boss might when asking for a TPS report.  But it's not exactly clear why Bane himself garners such allegiance from his acolytes beyond the mythology surrounding his emergence from the pit.  Tom Hardy, who has put in some great performances in his career, is constrained by a mouth piece that not only serves to obscure his facial expressions, but also distorts his voice, which ends up sounding like Sean Connery with laryngitis.  The end result can look menacing in a fight, but when Hardy has dialogue to deliver, his tools as an actor are hobbled.  This is no more apparent than when Bane gives an impassioned speech to Gotham's downtrodden, but the audience can't even see his mouth move, and his vocal range is electronically suppressed.

Bane's goal is not only to break Batman but also to hold Gotham hostage, cutting it off from the outside world and allowing the city residents to turn on each other.  After a vicious battle against Batman where Bane methodically dismantles his opponent, the League of Shadows proceeds to blow up any egress from the city and arm a nuclear weapon, which they are prepared to detonate if the U.S. military takes action against them.  The sequence is impressive in the way that it manages to make the stakes suitably and improbably high, a difficult task coming off of the threat of the Joker.  While Batman is trapped in the same prison that once held Bane, the citizens of Gotham plot to bring down the League of Shadows.

Bane's ideology and the film itself are peppered with pseudo-populist sentiment about inequality and class.  Selina Kyle, who has had to scramble to survive her entire life, resents Wayne and his high society peers.  And when Bane has finally cut Gotham off from the outside world his first move is to release all of the prisoners from jail.  Unfortunately, the film's handling of class issues is muddle at best and downright moronic at worst.  After Bane releases Gotham's prisoners, waves of the resentful underclass spread out over Gotham smashing the homes of the city's economic elite.  But it's unclear if all of this terror is a part of some Marxist dialectic, or if they're just angry prisoners.  The film suggests that the Dent Act, which is vaguely defined, has prevented parole for many of the prisoners and has in turn stoked much of their anger.  But later, these criminals form a twisted version of the judicial system in a kangaroo court headed up by none other than Dr. Crane a.k.a. the Scarecrow.  We're supposed to be incensed by a court whose sole purpose is to sentence its subjects because the verdict of guilty has already been determined, but we're not asked to question whether the Dent Act affected potentially reformed convicts who may have lingered in jail for years, or wonder about the potential for false conviction present in most attempts to create a tougher, more rigid judicial system.

All of Nolan's philosophizing has the bong scented whiff of a dorm room soliloquy.  In the previous films the ethical and moral questions were wonderful thought puzzles buried within exciting action movies, but here the very premise of these concerns fall apart the moment you think about them.  The obvious contemporary parallel to the film's class anger is the Occupy Wall Street movement and the 2008 financial crash.  But is the inclination to open prison doors and suspend the right to a fair trial really all that similar to increasing the top tax bracket by three percent and reinstituting economic safety guards put in place after the Great Depression, like the Glass-Steagall Act?  Nolan himself has distanced the film from real world events and claims that much of it is based off of the Charles Dickens classic A Tale of Two Cities.  And at times it seems as if Chris and his brother Jonathan want to be writing novels instead of making movies (which would explain the incredible amount of exposition that at times bogs down their plots).  But this doesn't necessarily solve the problem that, unlike much of Dickens's work, the moral quandaries found in this film are not well thought out.

But despite all of this, I enjoyed the film.  When it started to wobble, and it does from time to time, the movie got a boost from the emotional resonance that carried over from the first two movies.  Nolan does not treat this Batman series as a movie studio franchise, a fungible property that can be turned out by any number of studio approved directors.  If anything The Dark Knight Rises puts a cap on the series, and anyone would be hard pressed to awkwardly continue Nolan's story except for Nolan himself (and my guess is that he will be out of the Batman business for some time).  This is a situation where the studio should wait a decade or so, give the audience some distance from Nolan's vision of Batman, and then completely reinvent the character with a young and hungry director.  Whether you loved Nolan's movies or hated them, you must admit that the character has so clearly become his in the public eye that it will take some time before anyone will accept a Batman film that isn't helmed by Nolan.  Rises may not reach the heights of its predecessors, but its surprisingly moving denouement proves that it is possible to spin fully realized characters out of a world of superheroes.",1353542400,6,10532,4.799445983379502

4427985,1,B004LWZWGK,"Let me begin by saying this movie had some very big cinimatic shoes to fill after following The Dark Knight. Unfortunately, The Dark Knight Rises isn't worthy to even polish the shoes of its predecessor. Be aware, this review contains spoliers.

So, TDKR takes place 8 years after the conclusion of TDK, and apparently Bruce Wayne/Batman has become one of the wimpiest crime fighters in the DC universe. First of all, the Batman that all the fans throughout the history of the mythos know that Batman never quits, ever. Yet, because Harvey Dent died, his wanna-be girlfriend died, and Batman needs to be viewed as the bad guy to preserve Harvey's image, he quits. I was actually expecting that Batman would still be at work fighting crime from within the shadows and avoiding being caught by a police force that had been turned against him. Nope, Batman just wussed out like a child and quit. We as the audience are made to believe that the events of TDK and the ""Harvey Dent Law"", which incidently is never actually explained, have brought about a new age of peace and prosperity in Gotham. Now, I actually have no problem with this concept. It's actually nice to hear that the work Harvey Dent, James Gordon, and Batman paid off and that things are going right in Gotham. The problem I have is that instead of taking this positive turn of events and utilizing it to do great things with his company, Bruce Wayne pretty much dumps everything he has into an energy product that he's so sure will be weaponized he has placed it under the Gotham river with a flooding emergency protocol. This pretty much sets the tone for the whole movie, not about the dangers the people and the city faces, but the fact that this is such a wide and horrible departure from the Batman mythos that I honestly don't see how the film company can call this a Batman movie with a straight face. As many others have said, Batman himself (not Bruce Wayne) is only in the movie for maybe 25 minutes. You can't make an ""epic"" about a superhero and not have said superhero being in the majority of the film. There are also huge plot holes and completely unexplained events that seem to just been thrown in just for dramatic effect without a care about whether or not they actually belonged in the plot or story.

Let's start with the ""star"" himself, Batman/Bruce Wayne. First of all, why is this man suddenly a cripple when in the previous two movies there was no indication of such severe injury? He supposedly retired immediately after the closing of TDK, so how did he become so injured the man could barely walk? Next, let's examine the fact that Batman as presented by Christopher Nolon in no way seemed to ever represent Batman in all of the wide and varied mythos of the culture. I will freely admit that I was never a fan of Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman, particularly Batman, and it's possible that his ability to embrace the character had something to do with this, particularly his choice of voice when in the Batman persona. Whatever the reasons, from Batman Begins all the way through The Dark Knight Rises, not once did I see more than the barest glimpse of what Batman truly is. In every version of him, save for Christopher Nolan's series, Batman has been presented as someone who is highly intelligent, physically superior, and a very skilled investigator. Indeed, Batman himself in all other forms of media is said to possess genius-level intelligence, is a master of subterfuge/espionage, is a master of multiple fighting styles, and has an investigative skill-set that would leave all three CSI shows choking on dust even if they all joined forces. Not once did I see this in any of Nolan's movies. Oh sure, he did a tiny bit of ballistics in TDK, but that was it. His fighting in Nolan's movies was utterly pathetic. Batman is supposed to be an extremely strong and acrobatic fighter who has mastered numerous martial arts, yet all he seems to really do in Nolan's movies is box with an occasional kick thrown in. I can appreciate that the man is wearing armor, but make some adjustments to it to allow for a more fluid fighting style. From the scenes in the beginning of Batman Begins, it's clear that Bale has the physicallity for martial arts, but never presents that when wearing the costume. He was also never presented as utilizing his various tools during combat. Batman's fighting style often incorperated use of various weapons such as the batarang, smoke pellets, caltrops, grapple lines, etc., yet we never see that really in any movie. There's a great deal more, but I'll move on to other aspects of this movie.

There is a great deal of problems with this movie other than Batman himself, so I'll try to limit my comments to the really bad ones. First of all, let's look at the idiocy of those in positions of authority with the GPD. In what alternate universe would any police commander or commissioner think that it's a good idea to send practically every single police officer into the sewers to look for a bad guy? This decision had me practically shedding tears for Gary Oldman. In the first two movies, he gave the character of James Gordon a strong, intelligent persona with a good head on his shoulders and a damn fine police officer/comissioner. Whoever the writer for TDKR were, they and Nolan took that image and flushed it down the toilet to be replaced by some completely clueless character that seemed to have absolutely no clue what it mean to run a police force. Second of all, with the demise of Bruce Wayne via the theft of his fingerprints and the subsequent use of them to tank his company via the stock exchange that, gasp, Bane just coincidently exploded into that very day. And we as the audience are expected to believe that such events wouldn't just flat out shut the stock exchange down and such a shocking use of the exchange wouldn't be investigated? Oh yes, and let's not forget that the event that perpetrated this outrageous event, the theft of the fingerprints by Selina Kyle, was essentially ignored despite the fact that Bruce Wayne knew that his prints had been stolen. Batman is the kind of character that he has backups for backups and backups for those backups and so on. TDKR truly dumbed him down. Now let's examine the whole blowing up of the city by Bane. So, Bane sets off a series of massive explosions in the city, destroys all by one access out of the city, and declares that Gotham should be taken back by the people. So we are supposed to believe that regular people would, in a matter of moments, suddenly become violent outlaws that turn against the rich. People here have remarked on hiw this was clearly an omage to Occupy Wall Street and I can't disagree with that. What bothers me is that Nolan decided that an entire city population would happily do as Bane suggested, even after the man just BLEW UP THEIR CITY! Yes, this makes perfect sense to me, what sane person wouldn't eagerly follow advice of anarchy from a madman who just blew up their home without a care about the thousands of people he just killed.

On a side note, people have been blasting the movie for the 5-6 month length of time when the bomb degraded and Batman was in that prison. Honestly, I see what the movie people were trying to do with this part of the story. The concept was that Bruce Wayne would be stuck in that prison and that he would be helpless to do anything other than watch his city fall into decline and anarchy on the television before the nuke finally wiped the entire city from the map. It was supposed to be torture for Bruce, seeing his city and home fall into such a state of hell before being destroyed and knowing there was absolutely nothing he could do to prevent it.

Let's skip ahead to one of the worst endings for Batman ever. Once again, we're supposed to believe that his commitment to being Batman was so weak that he was perfectly happy faking his own death and moving to Europe to live happily every after with Selina Kyle while bequeathing his batcave to some rookie cop with a stupid Robin tie-in to take up the mantle? All this does is cheapen Bruce Wayne/Batman's commitment to protect his city and its people. In the end, with this movie, it seems like he doesn't even care anymore. You think after all of the insanity that the city just went through there wouldn't be a need for Batman in rebuilding it?

Like I said, there is a tremendous amount of things that went horribly wrong with this movie, and many people have already discussed them, so I'll leave them be. I will conclude by saying, as a great fan of Batman in various media forms, I thought this movie was utterly horrible and quite frankly a grevious insult to the Batman mythos that can never be forgiven.",1353369600,15,8752,4.589137380191693
4427986,4,B004LWZWGK,"This is a very good movie. All of Christopher Nolan's Batman movies have been not just really great comic book movies, they have been really good movies in general, discussing subjects like crime, definitions of justice and heroism, and the nature Batman and (in some cases more importantly) his villains. Batman Begins was a really good movie, and The Dark Knight was such a great movie that it was almost perfect, both as a Batman movie and as an adult crime drama. From the increase in quality between the first two movies, you would expect that the final Nolan movie would be the greatest of them all, building upon the first two movies and bringing it all to a satisfying conclusion in a really grand, climactic fashion, and while this is a very good movie, it doesn't really reach any of its goals. As good as it is, it unfortunately has a few problems that drag it down a bit. Firstly, the hand-to-hand fight scenes are, for the most part, pretty lackluster and boring considering that Batman is supposed to be one of the most highly trained martial artists in the world. Never even got the tiniest sense of that in any of Nolan's movies: the fights are shot too close, the costumes make movement next to impossible, and the editing is so choppy that it is hard to follow. Secondly, I get the impression that Nolan is taking too much advantage of how well known the source material is and not explaining several small but important plot points in the movie: How did Batman get out of whatever country that prison was in so quickly? How did he get back into Gotham without anyone noticing? How did Batman recover from a BROKEN SPINE in a matter of weeks?! I have other questions but they get in to heavy spoiler territory which I am trying to avoid. Some of these are probably at least partially a result of Cristopher Nolan trying too hard to appeal to the fans by setting up situations from well-known Batman stories (Knightfall, No Man's Land, Dark Knight Returns, etc.) when in the context of this movie they don't really help the narrative flow properly. Finally, the ending was not quite as climactic as I was hoping for. Not enough action, and a little too much predictability in the story progression. Finally, this is the worst the Christian Bale Batman voice has ever been. It's over the top, ridiculous, and it makes it really hard to understand what he's saying. Last two are minor complaints overall. But, with all of that said, there is still a lot to like in this movie. Anne Hatheway is a great Catwoman, and Tom Hardy is a really intimidating presence as Bane. The action scenes that are light on fist fighting are pretty damn awesome, and the Batplane is one of the coolest things I've ever seen. Like I said, it's a very very GOOD Batman movie, but seeing as its a follow-up to THE DARK KNIGHT, I was just expecting a little bit more. Still, I can easily recommend this for purchase because it's still a Cristopher Nolan Batman movie, and it's the last one we're gonna get. Pick it up now.",1353283200,,3014,4.552486187845304

The Vudu digital copy I might add, is HD, whereas any of the iTunes digital copies I've got are SD. So enough already.

Second: The Dark Knight Rises had the impossible task of rising (pun intended) above The Dark Knight. So no surprise that it wasn't able to achieve that. The attempt was probably one of the worst I've seen in a long time. First problem. They've time jumped 8 years since the Joker was captured. Batman doesn't appear, in costume, until about 45 minutes into the film. The movie itself is like a poor mishmash of KnightFall (from the comics) and the Dark Knight Returns graphic novel. There are some terrible leaps in logic, as well as plot holes you could fly The Bat through, but the main cast does well with what they are given. The exceptions being Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character, who's acting is terribly corny. Which is strange, because he's amazing in Looper. That and Tom Hardy's Bane who's voice was initially so hard to understand, they had him overdub his dialogue, which sounds strangely Sean Connery-ish, and never very threatening. Bane's motivations turn out to be nothing like they were in Knightfall. Ras Al-Ghoul's daughter does appear as well, most people figured out who she was before the movie even opened, and she has probably the most ham handed death scene I've ever seen in a movie. The final ""wrap-up"" scenes didn't surprise me at all. Typical comic book cliche stuff. A scene by Alfred early in the film, basically gives the ending up right then. So when you see it again, you knew it was coming and it's absolutely no surprise. I find it amusing for people who praised Nolan for making his Batman movies with a ""realistic"" feel, so hard pressed to defend this entry, as it's one of the most unrealistic, and comic book like of the three Nolan Batman films.

This version of Batman and this particular film can compete with any of the best super hero movies -- what makes a great super hero movie is a believable character that is fighting evil/bad guys but also fighting within to be a better person, overcome obstacles, etc. -- and the absolute best parts are when the character is willing to sacrifice him or herself -- think Passion of the Christ, Braveheart, Captain America, Batman Dark Knight Rises.

The character development was not nearly as good as the first two films and it wasn't quite as innovative. Bane's character was not as interesting as lets say the Dark Knight or The Scarecrow.

4427994,4,B004LWZWGK,"4 Stars. This was pretty damn good but it definitely had its problems. Bane's voice was almost impossible to make out most of the time. The addition of Catwoman was okay but nothing really extraordinary. There was very little screen time for Bale which he probably wasn't happy about so this really came off more like 'Bane and Robin' rather than 'Batman and Robin'. The biggest problem though is the first act.

It really drags and they could have lost about 10 or 15 minutes to tighten up the pace. Once the second act kicks in though, that's when the whole story becomes really engaging. It's awesome how Bane unintentionally 'recreates' Batman without knowing it. There is definitely some repetition of ideas from the first two which is probably why this is the last one but overall it is probably the darkest of the three. This is definitely better than the latest Spiderman.

The criticism about this third chapter not fitting in with the whole series could not be further from the truth. This one really represents the bookending of the entire series. In the first chapter Batman does NOT exist until he escapes from the League of Shadows and the same is true when he escapes from the prison in this one. The great irony of both these movies is that the antagonist in each case actually creates Batman, the only person that can stop them. This is why the first fight with Bane is dismal. It is not because of a lack of physical conditioning, it is because this is not Batman fighting Bane but Bane fighting Bruce Wayne doing the best he can. So in reality it is the second chapter that does 'fit' because Batman already exists from start to finish.

This is really the genius of Nolan in full effect. If you can overlook the flaws in directing you will be in a perfect position to see the brilliant story arc and also the spirit of Kane's creation represented accurately in all three films. In other words, Batman is not a suit or gadgets or cars and bikes etc., but a belief and mindset. When Alfred tries to explain this to Bruce, that he has not been 'Batman' for years, it does not register. No amount of physical training or gadgetry would give him the mindset of the Batman.

If you keep this in perspective that Batman is an internal mindset when watching all 3 chapters and not about discrepancies between page and screen that are really the external details, you can see that the essence of Batman has been presented here perfectly.",1353110400,59,2448,4.582191780821918

4427997,5,B004LWZWGK,"I was exceptionally impressed by this trilogy as a whole. The Dark Knight blew most people away and set an extremely high standard for this one to meet. I don't think this film met the standard for pure intrigue set almost single-handedly by Heath Ledger in his role as the Joker. I was however very impressed by Tom Hardy's performance as Bane and loved the character. I have heard many complaints about Bane from random people, but he is well constructed and developed, and highly formidable. He is a completely different animal from the Joker, and as the original story told, was meant to be Batman's arch-nemesis. I loved this movie for many reasons, including the depth of plot and for the story itself. Like most great movies, I think that it takes multiple viewings to pick up on all of the subtleties woven into the plot. (Study it closely naysayers, depth is there.) Many people complain of gaps and plot holes, but I don't give those complaints as much credence due to the subtle points woven in. Nolan does a good job of succinctly referencing most of those issues to move the story along quickly, you just have to pay closer attention. So purely as entertainment, I think this movie is incredible and well worth multiple viewings.

~plot spoiler alert from this point on~

This movie is very important, culturally, in my opinion. Nolan clearly draws a lot of inspiration from our society today, and writes a lot of cultural parallels into the movie. Much of what I am referencing here is the class warfare instigated by the cries of Bane for the citizenry to take back their city. A certain portion of the population is fooled into following a certain number of Bane's henchmen (not to mention the criminals set free) under the pretenses of rights to other people's property. This may seem like a digression, but Catwoman's character is a huge part of this side of the story. She is the caught between the two sides throughout much of the movie. She begins as one who sympathizes with movement of the [storm that is coming]. As the movie progresses however, she transforms from one who agrees with the deluded occupiers, to someone actively (however unwilling and detached she tries to be) engaged in fighting alongside the rational opposition to Bane. Catwoman's character is necessary for Nolan because I believe he wanted to show the line of logic that a fence sitter could follow to go from one side to the other. The tipping point for Catwoman was after a family was unceremoniously ripped from their home and Catwoman stood looking at a photo of the family and said ""This was someone's home..."" to which her friend replied, ""No, this is everyone's home."" She failed to buy into the propaganda machine controlled by Bane, and subsequently began to oppose those she once stood with.

There are many more details showing cultural and societal parallels written into the movie. I won't go into any more, but in case it interests you in addition to the the movie for story's sake, watch for them. That is all, it's an incredible movie.",1352937600,4,3048,4.736346516007533

4428000,1,B004LWZWGK,"And like all comic movie franchises with no exception outside Men in Black 3 (but MiB 2 was horrible, so it makes up for it), Chris Nolan's Batman trilogy ends with a massive disappointment. With the only amazing acting performance by the ensemble cast as this movie's only redeeming quality, the movie itself it's an absolute mess full of plot holes and nonsensical scenes after scenes. It starts 8 years after the Dark Knight, as it seems that Bruce Wayne have quit being Batman as soon as the death of Harvey Dent. Which tells us he was only Batman for around a year or less and then goes into retirement? As poorly the movie started, it ends even worse as Batman drags an unstable neutrocore on the Batwing, as it drags and knocks into everything in sight. This is movie so flawed, which saddens me because how good Batman Begins and the Dark Knight was. An atrocity finale for such a promising start of this trilogy. Pure garbage. Not even going to buy it on sale for $5. Highly not recommended!
Again, I'm giving it 1 stars only on how terrific the acting was from the entire cast.",1352851200,8,1087,4.494949494949495
4428001,5,B004LWZWGK,"Years after thwarting the Joker, Bruce Wayne sits alone in his mansion, his body derelict from abuse and neglect, his days as a crime fighter spent after taking the blame for Harvey Dent's crimes and death. Life in Gotham has gone on, safe and prosperous without the Batman. All of this is shattered by the arrival of Bane, a new leader in the League of Shadows. Young, determined, and unbelievably strong, Bane is more than a match for Batman, and aims to succeed where Bruce Wayne refused to act: in destroying Gotham City painfully and absolutely. Beaten, bankrupted, and betrayed, Batman will face his greatest challenge: saving a city ruled by his enemies from itself.

Let's get the obvious question out of the way first. Rises is not as good as The Dark Knight. In fact Heath Ledger owned the Joker so thoroughly it's hard to imagine ANY Batman film topping it. But in a way, Dark Knight's success was also a shortcoming: so dominated was it by its villian that Batman himself felt like a supporting character. Rises, by contrast, is soundly a Batman film, and its dives into the hero's psyche (and his bone-crunching fights) are as exciting and compelling here as they were in Batman Begins, if not more so. This is supported by excellent development of characters like Commissioner Gordon and newcomer Catwoman (who is not CALLED Catwoman in the film, since one silly animal-person name is already pushing it in these dark masterpieces).

Rises also feels like a move between the Nolan cinematic universe and the comic books. All the Hitchcockian darkness of the past two films remains firmly in place, but the action is a bit more over the top, as armies of criminals with futuristic weapons war openly against the police. Nolan's Batman films have always presented themselves as the building of the Batman mythos and this movie does a fine job showing the ultimate outcome of that movement. The resulting film is tense, exciting, and menacingly larger than life- the best way to describe it is as a combination of the climax of Avengers and the siege of Stalingrad, the second component being pretty obviously intentional.

So Rises succeeds at being a great Batman film and a solidly tense action thriller as well. However, if it has any failing it is that it leans on the comic books and other Nolan films far more than its predecessors. Still, this only means that to best enjoy it you should watch the whole trilogy- by no means a bad thing. It is also less solid than its forebearers: why does Batman waste his time erecting a flaming bat-symbol atop a bridge? Why does a city full of criminals willingly follow Bane? And yes, Tom Hardy is very hard to hear through (the audio filter of) his mask. But these weak points do not ruin the film- it starts at such a high tier that at its worst it still stands with the best releases of the year.

PROS
-Excellent performances from a great cast; Anne Hathaway in particular nails Catwoman to a tee
-Builds the Nolan Batman franchise to an insane crescendo befitting its epic earlier episodes
-Brings Batman back to the fore in a solid way
-Brilliant set design, costumes, and soundtrack create an innovative and eerie world that befits the grim, terse story
-Surprisingly affordable for a new release of a major hollywood picture in high def

CONS
-Convoluted plot has more than a few holes
-About half of Bane's lines are really hard to hear since his voice blends into background noise easily
-Lacks the panic and rough psychological hit of The Dark Knight

STUFF TO WATCH FOR
-Batman's final battle to dispose of a huge spherical bomb with an obvious timing mechanism is more than a little reminiscent of Adam West's similar quest in the 60s film, so much so that it almost must be deliberate
-One of Bane's League enforcers is played by Chris Judge, formerly of Stargate. Yay Teal'c!
-Doctor Crane makes another return cameo in this film, making him the only Batman Rogue to appear in all three Nolan films. And his cameo is AWESOME.",1352851200,2,3998,4.7206303724928365
4428002,5,B004LWZWGK,"Okay, I'm a little behind the wave of Batman mania on this one. The third and final movie in the Dark Knight Trilogy was being hailed as the most anticipated movie of the year (yes, moreso than The Avengers), was following up the most successful superhero movie of all-time (yes, not counting The Avengers), and had earned a cult-like movie status after the late Heath Ledger's famous, Oscar-winning performance as the Joker. So much hype. So much too live up too.

And, after watching the film for the second time, I can say it does live up to the challenge. The film is a cinematic masterpiece, a genuine action/adventure of the highest caliber. Truly this film secures the Dark Knight Trilogy as one of the greatest series of all-time. So as far as movie review goes, I say 5 out of 5. There's not a dull moment in the story and not a wasted moment of screen time, which is saying a lot as this movie is nearly 2 hours and 45 minutes. Calling it epic would only be cliche and underselling the film. Director Christopher Nolan knew what he was doing here. From the legend and mystery surrounding supervillain Bane to one of the greatest comebacks in hero movies to Jason Gordon-Levitt's outstanding performance, everything is of the highest quality.

What interested me the most however, is the social commentary the script writers embedded into this film and really the series as a whole. I always like, and in all honesty, cannot avoid, looking for the hidden worldviews behind the films I watch. After watching The Dark Knight Rises, I can only applaud the filmmakers for their very timely thoughts on Western Civilization, societal decay, and socialism.

I will warn that there are possible *spoilers* here if you have not seen the Dark Knight films, so read ahead at your own discretion. The first movie in this trilogy, Batman Begins, introduces audiences to the secret oganization that trained Bruce Wayne, allowing him to become Batman. Its name was the League of Shadows (LoS). We find out during the course of the film that the LoS is responsible for keeping societies in line with a general order and value system. When a society gets too far out of line and deteriorates into chaos and immorality, the LoS would take them down. The demise of the Roman Empire is credited to LoS as an example of their society policing.

I find this idea extremely interesting and not unwarranted from a Christian perspective. In the Old Testament days, God would often let the Israelites become overrun when they became too backslidden and wicked. In such cases, God would raise up a foreign power that would dismantle Israelite culture and take the people captive. This served a dual purpose of: (1) bringing the people back to Himself through the repentance that usually comes in divine breaking, as well as (2) stopping the downward spiral into sin. Romans 1 in the New Testament outlines a similar path of societal destruction, where the people fall further and further into mass depravity. The chapter could serve as a template to see how far a society has sunk, and, how much time they have left. I encourage you to read Romans 1 and see if this rings true, see where the U.S. might be in this slippery slope of sin, and how much time might be left on her moral clock.

To me, it's profound that Hollywood picked up on this spiritual principle, and though they credit man with monitoring and correcting societies, they nonetheless know that such a thing happens. The third Batman movie, Dark Knight Rises (DKR), comes back to this theme. Capitalizing on the Occupy Wall Street movement and different protests and riots around Europe, DKR shows the ""common"" people rising up against the ""wealthy"" and ""wicked"" ruling class. And in DKR, they achieve success for a time; the fruits of which is also shown. There is a scene where Catwoman and her friend are walking through a rich person's house that has been trashed by the rioting mobs. She picks up a broken picture of the family that used to live there and says something the effect of, ""This was their home."" To which, her friend replies, ""Now, it's everybody's home."" The irony is that the house was now uninhabitable. It had been vandalized and pillaged to the point where no one would want to live there and call it home. Herein is the film's brilliant commentary on socialism.

See when something belongs to everybody, it really belongs to nobody. Nobody could live in this home because everyone had ruined it. When everyone owns something (like in socialism), it's hard to establish personal worth in it. You know that no matter how highly you treasure something and work to preserve it, the next person who equally owns the thing, can just destroy it. So a house owned by the ""people,"" ends up with no one living in it, not even the family who it rightly belonged to. I say bravo Dark Knight Trilogy for highlighting and speaking to this rising threat to Western Civilization. I say bravo for pointing out how close to the moral edge Western Civ is and how right it would be for it to be taken down.

Here in the Dark Knight Trilogy, we have then not just one of the greatest action/adventures series of all-time, but a very real and prophetic insight into the times in which we live. And perhaps therein is its true strength. DKR is relevant. It carries a message. It weighs the world in which it was made and isn't afraid to judge it.

One last ideology (which admittedly feels kind of tacked on at this point in the review) that this third film specifically speaks to is that rugged individualism that so saturates the American youth. Today's kids have been taught to express themselves however they see fit; to discover who they are; to follow whatever urge they get; to be as radical as they want and push the envelope as far as they can. Reality TV and the internet have taught the youth that nothing is taboo and everything is within reach. In short, they are fearless. Consequences are an inconsideration. Who can say I'm wrong when everything around me tells me to just be myself? I confess I am tired of ringing the bell of relativism and trying to sound the alarm of postmodernism, but how fitting and inescapable are they when surveying today's social landscape? If I am empowered by culture to do what is right in my own eyes, then I am god; and if I am god, whom then shall I fear?

In DKR, Bruce Wayne struggles with fearlessness. After the immense success of the Dent Act (taken place between the second and third films), crime is almost non-existent in Gotham City. Batman, after taking the rap for Harvey Dent's death, is therefore wholly unneeded. Take that into account with the loss of Bruce Wayne's love interest in the second film, and death is no longer a foe or a fear to Batman. With nothing to live for, he welcomes death. As DKR, plays out however, this is shown to be a weakness, not a strength. And it is only when he takes back up the fear of dying, that Batman both begins to live again and becomes effective again in taking on Bane. Hear Batman kids: your fearlessness that you've developed because of your nurtured individualism is not a strength; it's a weakness. The sooner you learn that, the better off you'll be.

All things considered, great movie. Great series. Well-deserving of the aforementioned 5 out of 5.",1352764800,3,7311,4.656080557707203

THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is not just a triumphant film, but the the third part of an epic odyssey. The themes of fear, chaos, and pain as embodied by Ra's al Ghul, the Joker, and now Bane, are the catalysts that turn tragedy into the ultimate victory and redemption of one man who chooses to fight crime and corruption dressed as a bat. Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale once again take us on a journey that is both thrilling and thought provoking. As always, the acting is top tier, and the level of respect shown to the Batman mythology is something to be admired. Drawing inspiration from the comics, graphic novels, and even classic literature, this is a Batman film the likes of which will probably never be seen again.

4428008,5,B004LWZWGK,"I've spent a lot of time mulling this picture over as I wanted to check several Batman graphic novel references before reviewing (see TRIVIA & SPOILER section below).

For starters this trilogy this does not disappoint and it's an awesome and indelible finish to arguably the best Batman movie series ever. Yeah, I enjoyed the Michael Keaton/Tim Burton take on Batman but the quality dropped each movie thereafter to the point in which it was as ridiculous as the old and goofy Adam West TV series (you can watch them on the Web or syndicated TV). It wasn't worth watching by the third installment but I digress.

So it's 8 years later and crime seems to have diminished in Gotham but Bruce Wayne (played by Christian Bale once more) is in isolation (still on a cane per his injuries in the previous picture) and in emotional mourning for the loss of his alter ego. But if that was it, well, we wouldn't have much of a story so a new supervillain, Bane, shows up and at a later point captures Detective Gordon (who is carrying a guilt ridden note over the cover up in the previous film) and begins a devious plan which will call up The Bat once more.

Meanwhile, Wayne's emotional mourning is reflected in his outside world with Wayne Enterprises close to bankruptcy as it tries to develop a fusion reactor. Then, Bane strikes and puts Gotham into nuclear peril and nobody is just walking away from it.

What follows is Bruce Wayne's voyage from broken man to the Batman most of knew and loved in the first picture. This is more of a mental journey than one of physicality.
In fact, even though this tale focuses more on Bruce Wayne than Batman it also gives scenes to the supporting cast and their inner turmoils. Selina Kyle a la Catwoman is played by Anne Hathaway who does an impressive job of switching personalities on the spot as needed. Alfred Pennyworth plays the loyal and only remaining ""family member"" to Bruce Wayne and is emoted by Michael Caine. Morgan Freeman is back as Lucius Fox and Gary Oldman is Gordon and Tom Hardy plays Bane (who felt subdued compared to the Ledger take on Joker).

Yes, that was  Cillian Murphy playing the unmasked Scarecrow (did you see the bits of straw in his hair?) who was one of the death judges. Matthew Modine has a small role but does a credible job as Foley who in the end makes the right heroic decision. I would surmise that the Talia character (played by Marion Cotillard) was perhaps the least engaging of the bunch. I should mention that Blake, an up and coming detective, is played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt.

I have something to say about the thematic elements but I am going to put it down in spoilers as my information is a minor spoiler. You can probably read it without being spoiled by the movie and it might even give you a better perspective but I can see a few ""sensitive"" types whining.

Overall, this is Sterling Silver quality and therefore tremendously satisfying for a trilogy well concluded (I already said it but wanted to hammer it in again). I'm very pleased that this graphic novel based character was executed as a serious work and done exceptionally well. Now, I can point non graphic novel readers to it just like I point non fantasy readers to LORD OF THE RINGS or GAME OF THRONES.

SOME TRIVIA PIECES (Wiki and IMDB sources): the Batman suit consisted of over 110 separate pieces and several had to be remade during production. Cinematography was intended as raw and gritty. The Batman cowl was sculpted from Bale's face. Bale is the first actor to portray Bruce Wayne in three Batman films. Jessica Biel and Keira Knightley both came close to playing Catwoman. Almost 10,000 extras were used at the stadium scene.

Christopher Nolan said that this film's theme deals with ""Pain"". For Batman Begins, it was on ""Fear"", while The Dark Knight deals on ""Chaos"".  According to producer Emma Thomas, the filmmakers elected to shoot the film in Pittsburgh to emphasize Gotham's immense size and scope and because ""they literally shot every inch"" in Chicago, where the previous two films were shot.  Christopher Nolan wanted Marion Cotillard so much for the role of Miranda Tate that he modified the filming schedule to accommodate her pregnancy. Cotillard started filming two months after giving birth.  According to costume designer Lindy Hemming, she took two years to design Bane's coat; it was inspired by a Swedish army jacket and a French Revolution frock coat, to make Bane look equally dictatorial and revolutionary, ""like an amalgam of all sorts of bits and pieces he cobbled together as he passed through some very remote places.""  Bane's theme is a chant which features the term ""deshi basara"", which is Moroccan for the word ""rise"".

When Selina Kyle disappears from a rooftop, Batman's remark ""So that's what that feels like"" is lifted directly from the DC graphic novel ""Kingdom Come"". Even the circumstance is similar, except it was with Superman.  In the film there are a total of four Oscar winners: Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Marion Cotillard, and four Oscar nominees: Anne Hathaway, Gary Oldman, Tom Conti, Liam Neeson.  Bruce Wayne's doctor visit in which the doctor lists off all the degenerative injuries to his body (lack of cartilage, scar tissue, etc.) and the use of a mechanical knee brace both are reminiscent of Kingdom Come, where an older Bruce Wayne requires the use of an exoskeleton to move due to years of physical wear and tear on his body.

Each movie from the Dark Knight trilogy is 12 minutes longer than the previous one (Batman Begins is 140 minutes, The Dark Knight 152 and The Dark Knight Rises 164).  The Lazarus Pit/Bane's prison scenes were shot in the city of Jodhpur, Rajasthan. (India). In the comics, Batman visited India to learn how to control his pain.  Though the fate of the Joker is never revealed in the film, the novelization does mention his whereabouts in passing: he is the lone resident of the newly-rebuilt Arkham Asylum, held in solitary confinement and thus has no one to ""play with"" as ultimate punishment for his crimes.  Although used to soften a landing, this is the first movie in the Batman ""Nolanverse"" where the cape isn't used to glide.  Patrick Leahy:  US Senator from Vermont cameos in the movie as a Wayne Enterprises Board Member. Leahy, a fan of Batman, previously cameoed in The Dark Knight and Batman and Robin.

The budget for this film after tax credits was $230M and so far it has made ONE BILLION at the Box office.

CINEMATOGRAPHY: A minus; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: A minus to A; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: A minus to A; ACTION SCENES/SCOPE: A to A plus ; THEMES/BATMAN FOCUSES: A minus to A ; WHEN WATCHED: end of August 2012 (at the movie theater); OVERALL GRADE: A minus to A.

SPOILERS/THE MOVIE: As pointed out by ""Filmkiller"" and a few other movie reviewers the whole trilogy deconstructs the role of a hero and challenges the typical belief that we must rely on one heroic person or a group to save us. In the second film the incident between the two boats demonstrated the people of Gotham becoming the heroes of this trilogy as well (remember when both boats refused to blow each other up and mucked up the Joker's plans?).

However, the cover up at the end of the second film demonstrated Batman and Gordon were willing to lie to the people of Gotham because they felt the people of Gotham could not handle it and arguably that sometimes people need to be lied to so that their hopes are kept up.

But then in the final movie of the trilogy you see Alfred telling the truth to Bruce Wayne about Rachel choosing another man over her and that Wayne is going to die if he keeps at being Batman.

The high casualty rate for the police of Gotham as well as many other people arguably made this the darkest of the three Batman movies. That said, the police of Gotham (which includes a doomed Foley played by Modine) step up and deal with taking their city back.

I would argue that Wayne trusting Selina and then forgiving her and having a relationship with her is arguably not true to the graphic novels but I suppose you could argue this was the early Batman who was not so cynical and suspicious.

SPOILERS/THE GRAPHIC NOVELS (several of these are my own ideas and then further down are from IMDB.COM)

Christian Bale has stated that he would not play Batman if Robin appeared anywhere in the trilogy. Christopher Nolan agreed not to include Robin as it would undermine the dark tone of his series. At the end of the film, Detective John Blake's (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) legal name is revealed to be ""Robin"", and he quits the police force and is shown to enter the Batcave by following the instructions presumably left by Bruce Wayne in his will.

In the graphic novels just like the movie Bane really did break Batman's back. In the graphic novels another person took on the Batman mantle while Bruce Wayne recovered

Gotham Occupied similar to ""No Man's Land"" when villains became judges to execute people and the law went into hiding, which included Gordon.

Catwoman and Batman didn't really have a serious relationship as far as I could tell but it wouldn't surprise me if some alternate universe DC take did something with that romance. The biggest issue in the graphic novels is that Wayne simply didn't trust Catwoman and she rarely proved herself as more than a temporary ally.

Robin had an unusual intro which makes me think that actor might be carrying the series forward as Nightwing (the superhero name the first Robin took after he left Batman).

In the graphic novels Talia and Wayne had a child named Damian (who would become one of the Robins later) and Wayne at one point has mixed allegiances. In this film Talia is more of the bait and switch element.

In the comics, Bane carried an apparatus that contains a steroid that amplifies his strength and fighting ability. In the film, the apparatus he carries contains an anesthetic as he is in chronic pain. (IMDB)

The filmmakers cite the ""Batman"" comics 'The Dark Knight Returns' (an aged Batman operates in a future Gotham), 'Knightfall' (Bane pushes Batman physically and mentally, causing him to burn out) and 'No Man's Land' (Gotham descends into gangland territory and are cut off from the rest of the US) as major influences on the film.  (IMDB)

When Batman is chasing after Bane for the first time after the stock exchange robbery an older policeman tells his younger partner to ""sit back, you're in for a show"". This is an almost direct quote from the graphic novel ""Batman: The Dark Knight Returns.""  During the fight between Bane and Batman in the sewers, Bane lifts Batman above his head and drops him across his knee. This is a direct parallel to the first fight between Batman and Bane from the comics where Bane broke Batman's back during the ""Knightfall"" story line.  (IMDB)

At the end of the movie when Blake (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is exploring the Batcave, his black jacket has a blue stripe that dips in the middle on the back of it. This is very reminiscent to the character Nightwing, who the first Robin eventually became.  (IMDB)

In addition to the numerous elements from the ""Knightfall,"" ""The Dark Knight Returns,"" and ""No Man's Land"" storylines, the film also borrows from the ""Legacy"" storyline, which involves Bane becoming Ra's Al Ghul's successor and plotting with the League of Shadows to destroy Gotham City.  (IMDB)

The villainous character portrayed by Liam Neeson Ra's Al Ghul, who died by the end of the first movie, makes an appearance before Bruce Wayne's eyes, claiming to be immortal the whole time, only to be revealed as a hallucination. This is a reference to Ra's Al Ghul's comic book counterpart in which the character IS immortal by the use of Lazarus Pits.  (IMDB)

In all three Nolan Batman films, the spiked gauntlets on Batman's arms prove essential in defeating the main villain. They shatter Ra's Al Ghul's sword in Batman Begins, disarm the Joker in The Dark Knight and damage Bane's mask in The Dark Knight Rises.  (IMDB)",1352419200,5,12036,4.721241050119332

Before I get crucified, I just want to say that I really wanted to like this movie but I couldn't push myself to do it even while watching it in IMAX.  It was just so much worse the second day. A second viewing showed how sorely lacking the movie was.

I know people are screaming that this movie was Epic but I found it to be epically bad.  I took my son who is 12 and he didn't like it at all and told me that I didn't have to buy this one. My mom fell asleep and my daughters thought it was way too long and boring.  I went the first day to a crowded Manhattan theater where every seat was filled and all I heard were ""crickets"".  We spent so much time asking each other what Bane and Bruce Wayne said that after a while, it was just frustrating and we stopped asking and let the movie run its course.  The next day in IMAX was just a little bit better but not much and by then it just became louder garbled nonsense from Bane and Bruce Wayne.

Brought many themes and threads to an interesting conclusion going back to Batman Begins. Most plot holes reviewers point out do have an explanation WITHIN the narrative, Nolan just doesn't waste time showing you every train ride, bank transaction, etc. Avengers, although a good popcorn flick, could have benefited from letting the audience assume Tony Stark could fix the helicarrier's engine instead of showing it to us in real time.

4428014,1,B004LWZWGK,"The headline says it all.  Ultraviolet is just a waste of people's time.  In a couple more years, the entire program will collapse.

Filmmakers for the studios go to great lengths to make sure they make movies for the widest possible audience.  So then why do the studio executives go to great lengths to limit their audience?  They choose to endorse Ultraviolet - and not just endorse it, but actively ignore iTunes, the platform that most people use - for their digital movies.

If you are going to offer Ultraviolet, they need to at least offer a real digital download via iTunes as well.  But just offering one and not the other is just the executives at the studios proving how out of touch with reality they are, and how little they deserve to have their jobs.

As far as the movie itself, I think it was the weakest of the Nolan Batman movies, but still a good movie.  The last hour was two different third acts for two different movies, it seemed, and cut the flow and resolution of the movie.

4428016,3,B004LWZWGK,"I saw Dark Knight Rises at the movies (twice) and on a bootleg DVD. I had to watch it 3 times to fully understand what was happening. Overall, it was a disappointment, but it wasn't the worst Batman movie (Batman and Robin still has that dubious distinction). It wasn't even the worst comic book movie of the summer of 2012 (Amazing Spider-Man).

At 2 hours and 45 minutes, the movie was way too long. I nearly fell asleep watching it. It could've been condensed to 2 hours. Batman's voice sounded hoarse, like he needed lozenges. Bane's voice sounded even more ridiculous-it was a cross between Darth Vader and a James Bond villain. Bane was also too small- he wasn't much taller than Catwoman.

Alfred was annoying throughout the entire movie. We get it- he doesn't approve of Bruce being Batman. He said the same crap in the first Nolan movie. As for Bane, his plot to destroy Gotham was similar to Ra's Al Ghul's plot in the first movie. I wish they were more consistent with Bane's comic book character.

SPOILER

After Bane pummeled Batman during their first confrontation, he tossed him into the pit. Bane didn't kill Batman because Batman didn't fear death. He feared being left in the pit while Bane destroyed Gotham. The pit was set up in a way where a person who wanted to escape had hope of escaping, but ultimately couldn't. In the pit, Batman randomly met some old philosopher dude. Batman's back had been broken by Bane, but after the old man punched the vertebrae back in place, he magically healed (even for a comic book movie, this was ridiculous). Batman then did some push-ups and sit-ups and was suddenly strong enough to fight Bane.

During the final confrontation on Wall Street, the cops and Bane's minions were fighting each other like gladiators. Batman was winning his second battle with Bane when Miranda plunged a knife into him (which for some inexplicable reason didn't kill him). She then revealed that she was Ra's Al Ghul's daughter Talia and that Bane was her protector when she was a child. Catwoman, who had been a morally ambiguous character, helped Batman by shooting at Bane. Batman then used the Batjet to dispose of the bomb over an ocean. He then faked his death and donated Wayne Manor to some orphans. He was last seen in France. Alfred saw him and acknowledged, but didn't say anything to him. Batman deciding to retire and move to Europe is inconsistent with his character.

I'm not the type of person who complains just for the sake of complaining. Many people complained about John Blake/Robin's character, but I found him to be interesting (though he definitely had too much screen time). This movie didn't live up to the hype, but it wasn't garbage. That's why I gave it a 3.",1351987200,6,2726,4.680584551148225

The fact that a Batman film is set in New York City, just a year after I did a personal art project highlighting the city is amazing. The movie itself is stunning, and super-fast paced. Seeing it 10 times in theatres was not enough for me, I need to own this in splendid Blu ray, with MASTER AUDIO - which is now becoming standard for Blu rays. MASTER AUDIO is like, a cold ginger ale on a hot day.

Back to the film. The story is unusually awesome, and it takes Gotham City to hell and sets it on to a brighter future. The ""plot holes"" and ""film length"" are a product of movies that will never be fixed. People want more, and they somehow need everything explained, but that is not the case with this movie, for good reason. I'm all over the place with this review, so I'll settle it down.

This is a great Batman movie, with many explosions, flying vehicles, fist fights, hot girls, and more explosions. Also, Batman gets his ass kicked, and comes back for more.

So many ridiculous things happened that I lost count. I KNOW it is based on a comic book, but if you are going for modern times believeability, at least try to make sense. There was no comedy at all in this which could have helped some of the huge plot holes. Some of my ""favorite"" things were...

All the ""poor"" people of Gotham just decide to destroy the no crime peace and take down anyone who has any money. Yeah, that's a good idea because somebody with a face mask and a few guns thinks it's a good idea. Maybe they couldn't understand what country his accent was from because it kept moving from country to country.

The 3000 cops just rush the automatic weapons and manage to subdue them with fists while Batman and Bane duke it out. Can't one of the cops manage to use a gun and shot him while this is going on? Millions of lives are at stake-wouldn't want to be a hero and do the right thing.

And what is with Batman not using a gun? Gee, you think he might WANT to after thousands get killed because he doesn't and millions could die later? Where is the Bat Logic? ""I'm going to hit you with my fist repeatedly and hope that does the job!!""

And why does he let ""Catwoman"" keep duping him? And why does he waste valuable seconds kissing here while they are mere seconds away from an atomic bomb explosion. Just ridiculous!!! You killed my father so I'm gonna destroy a city and millions of lives.

4428025,4,B004LWZWGK,"Ok let's get something straight. Yes this is a spectacular film but is it perfect? Definately not. If I look at this from an audience members point of view then yes it does have some plot holes but it's still pretty damn awesome. From a comic book nerds point of view though the problems are easier to see.
Where's Bane's venom or better yet his South American origin? Yes I understand that the venom may have been omitted due to the film being more realistic but I'm sure that there is some form of steroid that has at least similarities to venom. Any form of steroid would've been good actually since it would make him more powerful then before. Another problem was his mask. I WAS DEFINITELY NOT FEELING IT. It wasn't that I couldn't understand him in fact I understood him pretty well. My problem was that it was so different from his comic mask that it almost felt like a different character. That doesn't mean it should've been as cheesy as the one in Batman and Robin I'm just saying that they could've easily found a way to pay homage to it. After all the luchador look of the mask immediately gave you a feel for his South American heritage. Was it a completely all out luchador mask in the comics? No but you could tell that in its own way it was like a homage to them.
Also there are people complaining that Batman wasn't in the film enough of the time but go back to the KnightQuest storyline the one that's apart of Knightfall and you can see that Batman himself was also hardly in that.",1351382400,2,1500,4.360714285714286

4428027,1,B004LWZWGK,"Ugh. I hated this movie. Huge Batman fan here, but not an invested comic nerd who can't accept certain liberty taken upon the comic book mythos. Sigh. I despised this movie deep in my gut. For the record, I never brought Christen Bale as Batman/Bruce Wayne. His Bat voice was just annoying, and I loathed the costume. Loathed it.  Nevertheless, let me just talk about this movie. In a nut shell, it's boring, over long, pretentious, and has no internal logic. Yes, even in a comic book / sf world, you need an internal logic. Especially when Nolan goes on record stating this is a ""Batman in a real world"". This nonsensicalness is accepted because the false deity Nolan made it. Take off the ruby glasses people. Spoiler Alert>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
So Bane breaks Batman's back. Brings him half way around the world, and puts him in some underground prison. A montage of sit-ups, and with the help some eastern yoga guru, his back is fixed. Wow, all that was missing was the playing of ""Eye of the Tiger"". He then climbs out of the hole, (with a rope sitting on top, while the prisoners cheer him on) and heads back to Gotham. Meanwhile some cop who is standing in for the the Robin character, is taking down the bad guys by himself. The MacGuffin in the movie, is some computer program thing which can wipe one's history. Though the infrastructure of city is destroyed, so this program would be useless.
Batman, who is supposed to be the world greatest detective, not only allows all this chaos to happen, gets duped by Catwoman, at least three times, and by Bane and by Ra's al Ghul's daughter. On his return fight with Bane, he engages him in hand to hand combat again, the same tactic which got his back broken the first time. Now logic would say, that Punch for Punch, Bane is stronger than Batman, so has the world's greast detective you think he would find another method to take him down. Sigh. It just gets sillier. Bombs in the city, car chases, Com Gordon acts like he has superpowers. Not the greatest superhero movie people. Stop the love train on this piece of c...",1351296000,22,2113,4.664879356568365
4428028,5,B004LWZWGK,"As you read through the reviews of DKR here on Amazon, one thing that will immediately strike the dispassionate buyer is how many reviews will compare ""Rises' unflatteringly to its predecessor in the trilogy, the Dark Knight. There's a completely irrational and almost obssessive need by the fan community to exalt the qualities of ""Dark Knight"" to something resembling mythical proportions. This tendency was also evident among many professional movie critics.

To a degree, the strong emotional connection of general and fan audiences to Dark Knight is understandable. As Heath Ledger's last completed film, Dark Knight stands out for his incredibly engaging performance. In the Dark Knight, Ledger disappears into a role and simply mesmerizes on screen, in a way that few actors ever do.

And while Dark Knight is legitimately hailed as simply one of the best movies ever created period, rather than merely a superb 'superhero' film, the unfortunate fact is that the esteem with which the movie is held is out of all proprotion to its actual achievements. Yes, Dark Knight is that good, but it is also flawed in some very important ways, and what's more, Dark Knight Rises is a superior entertainment in every way that really matters. But few viewers will ever admit it, because to do so would almost feel like a betrayal of their devotion to the former film. Allow me to explain.

As a film, Dark Knight suffers from three major (and one minor but significant) flaws. In the first place, careful viewers will note that, the plot of DK doesn't quite stand up to close scrutiny. There are swathes of the film where the Joker's machinations strike at first as brilliant, till you begin to consider the sequence of events and realize, they don't quite make complete sense. Why precisely police officers behave the way they do in connection with the threats to the hospital or precisely how Joker is able to anticipate certain things that seem completely unconnected to his actions never quite makes sense, but these are minor boggles that don't quite undermine enjoyment of the film. More problematic is the reversal of Harvey Dent from hero to villain. While the character makes a similarly villainous transformation in the comics, in the film he's presented as an ernest and genuinely benevolent fellow who somehow manages to fall so far as to threaten children... He does this while letting the Joker, who is really the person responsible for his grief, survive when he has an opportunity to kill him. But the really troublesome part of Dark Knight and the major reason that film will never achieve the heights for me that others claim, is that in the DK, Batman is the least interesting character in the movie. As if everyone is oblivious of the fact that this is a problem, DK suffers because Bruce Wayne is overshadowed and nearly marginalized by his villains!

Which brings me at last, to the Dark Knight Rises. In Rises, not only is the plot immaculate and completelely logical in every respect, not only do the characters behave in a manner that never strains credibility, but at last, Batman is again the most interesting character in his own film. As a movie watching experience, Rises is leagues more entertaining that the DK, (which was occasionally slow and even a little boring in parts, the minor flaw I mentioned), with set pieces that compel and stakes so high that the movie feels less like a film in places and more like an honest chronicle of something happening in a very recognizable part of the world. The cast is superb with amazing performances by Tom Hardy as Bane and Ann Hathaway as Selina Kyle. The standout however is Sir Michael Caine who is so amazingly good that I challenge anyone to watch his performance and not be moved every time he's on screen. In Rises, Batman goes through a true arc, one in which he overcomes his arrogance to find the strength to face his greatest challenge. Executed with style, aplomb and just the right dose of speed, Rises is an eminently more watchable film because it has more going on, has more interesting characters involved, revolves around incredible stakes, and makes Batman the most compelling figure of his universe.

To be sure, it's not a perfect film. Michael Caine is absent for too long a stretch and the film makers missed an opportunity to seal the ending with an even more compelling emotional cap, but for me, even those sins are less glaring than the flaws of Dark Knight. Both films are among the best movies ever made however, and both deserve your time!",1351209600,9,4541,4.82413350449294

4428032,4,B004LWZWGK,"Let me begin by saying I am a devoted Batman fan.  I know the material, the games, the gadgetry, etc.  So if my review comes off a bit too harsh or perhaps too critical, it is only because this is one character I notice when something isn't done right.  That being said, let's begin...

This is by far an excellent movie.  All of the elements that make an epic concluding tale are present; definately on the level of the second installment.  This movie will, and by no means is this an understatement, literally have you watching anxiously until the very end.  But like any movie, there are some plot holes, in this case not major, and in no way will they take away from the overall plot or film itself.

One - Bane's voice.  Really, Bane in general, let's get down to the foundation.  Bane by way of the comics is a foreigner, some say spanish, some say brazilian, doesn't matter, just either way he's not a white guy.  I'm not racist nor do I intend to come off that way, but I personally feel in cases like this, when it's clear that you have a non-american character, and you can easily get one, Hollywood cheaps out and just throws the role to a white guy.  Tim Hardy-excellent actor.  And as Bane, convincingly terrifying.  But the accent just wasn't there.  I mean honestly, it sounded more like ""Jack Ryan, you've just boarded the Red October!""....Sean Connery.  And the muzzle only made it worse on the ears.  So now you have a British accent that's drowned out by the latest facewear from the SPCA.  So by far, I recommend SUBTITLES ON when watching.

Two - Catwoman, rather, a feminine cat burglar as I believe she's described in the film.  Anne Hathaway was an okay addition to the cast.  Would I have casted her as Catw...*ahem* a female cat burglar? No.  Selina Kyle is among the sexier, perhaps among the sexiest characters in the DC universe.  I apologize if I sound sexist ladies, but that being considered, I don't see Anne Hathaway as a sexy woman.  I see her as, the girl who had it rough in Devil Wears Prada, or the innocent little princess, but not as a sex symbol.  Not that that is all Catwoman is about, but it is what you expect considering her character.  Her perfomance was okay, just not sexy.  And I don't feel it was just for her to. . . I don't want to give anything away for those who haven't seen the movie.  But let me just say that was Batman's place to take care of....""that situation"".  And the overly long kiss at the end?  That was just bad timing.

Three - No mention whatsoever is made of Joker.  Not even the tiniest reference.  And this point may be unimportant at all, but for the damage he did to the city and to Bruce's pshyche, they could have at least said something about, I don't know, ""Glad they managed to keep him in Arkham all this time"", or something like that to let the audience know he didn't just stay hanging upside down indefinately.  Also, Bruce Wayne's magical brace?  Come on.

Four - Last and final point, and this one is a spoiler alert so don't read ahead if you can't handle it.  But the character of Robin John Blake was a bit stretched.  You were able to deduce Batman's identity by the way he came into an orphanage?  Riiiight.  And in the event that the saga continues, Robin is a sidekick character, thus the Batman and Robin series.  Where could you go with him?  I'll tell you where, Nightwing, or even better, a Batman Beyond.  But now I'm trailing off topic.

Other than the above, I have no gripe against the movie whatsoever.  The movie is simply epic.  Inspiring at times, tragic in others, but surprising throughout.  Especially that one big one.  Ultimately, I will be adding this to my collection the day it comes out, and I suggest that you do the same.  You will not be dissappointed.",1351123200,2,3771,4.427113702623907

If it is too late in the manufacturing process to have the ""Reborn"" BDs inserted into the Bat-Cowl boxes, then they may attached to outside of the box within a simple cardboard sleeve or else distributed in limited quantities to the first-coming customers. I am confident that Warner Bros. Home Video can find of a way to resolve this problem.

Furthermore, please post the product details and box contents list for ""The Dark Knight Trilogy""--Ultimate Collector's Edition Gift Set, which is purported to be released in early 2013, as soon as possible, hopefully before December 4th, which is when ""Dark Knight Rises"" will be released on Blu-ray and DVD. Doing so will enable us Batfans to decide on whether to acquire ""TDKR"" in December, or to wait for the Trilogy Ultimate Set.

If there are some other powers that be that we should instead be contacting in regards to these issues, please forward this message to them or else let us know their names, phone numb#rs and/or e-mail addresses.

Thank You So Much for hearing us!
Sincerely,

4428037,2,B004LWZWGK,"I'm a big Christopher Nolan fan and an even bigger Batman fan. I loved the first two movies in this series, but The Dark Knight Rises just didn't live up to the expectations I had for it. Everything that was in this movie felt like it was destined to be a great follow up: Gary Oldman was phenomenal as Commissioner Gordon, Anne Hathaway was really surprising as Catwoman, I thought Bane was well portrayed, the acting and directing was all around very well done.

The story and plot structure was completely another matter. There was just so much in this movie that didn't feel like it fit in a Batman story. There were a lot of plot holes, and it just felt very disjointed and made no sense at times. Also, I had problems with all the new characters they introduced and how they seemed to be taking this film over from Bruce Wayne/Batman. This should really be about him, but I felt like Joseph Gordon-Levitt was getting all the attention. I reeeeeaaaally feel like his character was completely unnecessary in this movie. I really wanted to like this film, but it was very long and dragged at several points and I had to look at my watch more than once to try to figure out if it was going to be over soon. Very disappointing end to a great series of films.",1351036800,4,1259,4.4034334763948495
4428038,2,B004LWZWGK,"There's all the things the plot draws from:
1. ""The Dark Knight Returns"" (batman comic story)
2. ""Knightfall"" (batman comic story)
3. ""No Man's Land"" (batman comic story)
4. A mission impossible escape scene in the beginning, actually my favorite part of the movie
5. A James bond Goldfinger/Thunderball type ""find and stop the nuke before it explodes"" plot line
6. Some weird imaginary pit prison that seems like a leftover from inception. Here batman must have a vision quest to escape (it is supposed to be the worst prison on earth, maybe Nolan needs to watch some Oz)
7. Some half hearted attempts at an analogy between the villains and the Occupy wall street movement
8. A tie in to the first Nolan batman movies villain, who to be honest I didn't remember much about
9. I think there's also a kitchen sink in there somewhere

Of course, tying all of this together is impossible, so we have some really dumb stuff like Joseph Gordon Levitt's character finding out who batman his just by shaking his hand when he was a kid, the police all going into the sewer at once, Bruce not really caring that his fingerprints were stolen and are obviously going to be used against him, Bruce seemingly having wolverines healing powers, etc.

Because of the over abundance of material, nothing really gets the attention it deserve and the movie can't focus on anything. For instance, Bane had the potential to be a great villain, but nothing is really developed with him and in the end he's just a lackey and he has one of the most anti-climax defeats in movie history. As for Batman himself, Nolan seems so bored with him that we barely get to see him, and when we do he is so wimpy you want to go watch a brave and the bold episode.

There are good things in this movie, but don't go in expecting anything above the level of your typical summer blockbuster movie.",1350864000,6,1858,4.5568862275449105
4428039,2,B004LWZWGK,"Alright, this is by no means a 'bad' movie, but when following up a classic like 'The Dark Knight' it will make a sequel look worse if it does not come close to matching up with its predecessor.  And the 'Dark Knight Rises' does not come close.  This movie had a plethora of problems.  For one, a jabbering story line about identity theft which disappears mid-way through the film.  It merely served as a plot device so it would justify the catwoman being in the film.  Also, the complete lack of build-up to Batman's first confrontation with Bane.  It reminded me of George Clooney's Batman fighting Mr. Freeze with no build up whatsoever.  In the movie, Bane does not rely on the venom to give him super strength, which means he beats Batman without the aid of anything.  This means that some guy who grew up in a prison can defeat a man who has mastered every form of martial arts? eh,no. They should have done their homework on that one.

Another unforgivable flaw is the fact that Joseph-Gordon Levitt has more screen time than Batman. What? (Meaning more screen time than Christian Bale in the Batman costume).  The run time is a bloated 2hr and 45 mintues, filled with too many philosophical conversations.  Basically, this movie takes the plot from the Arkham City video game (Gotham becoming an isolated island with roving criminals) and the Dark Knight Returns (where batman has taken an eight-year hiatus from crimefighting).  So much for original ideas.  By doing this, Chris Nolan cuts off the cliffhanger from the last movie at the legs.  Weren't the cops supposed to be chasing batman around as a fugitive?  They just fast-forwarded that and that is how the storyline is resolved.....awful.  The puzzling romance between Bruce Wayne and Talia, one moment their talking business, the next their doing business in bed.  Again, no build-up, it just sort of happened. Awful.  The action sequences are few and far between. To make matters worse their not exciting, they come across as flat and bland.  Listen to the music during the movie, it's just the main theme over and over again.  The variety for the themes from the last movie is gone.

  I think the momentum from the last movie has carried over to this one, making people believe its better than it really is.  On the plus side, Christian Bale does a more palpable Batman voice, gone is the growl.  Tom Hardy steals the show as Bane. And the first fight between Batman/Bane was easily the best scene in the movie (despite no build-up).  As a stand alone movie, this is a decent action film.  When compared to the 'Dark Knight'.....not even close.  When they release the trilogy, the should just put the 'Dark Knight' twice.",1350864000,5,2692,4.718884120171674

While the comic book version of Bane was meant to be physically intimidating to Batman, Tom Hardy just doesn't measure up. I realize that comic books and the movie version are never gonna line up perfectly, I'm not the type to over-analyze those types of things. His voice box was intolerable the entire movie tho. I also didn't know Bane was Irish/Scottish/British all at the same time. While the action scenes were decent, living up to the first two movies was always gonna be near impossible. I admittedly may watch it again on cable when it comes in a few years. Until then I have my Dark Night and Batman Begins blu-rays to keep me company.",1350777600,3,718,4.530769230769231

4428047,4,B004LWZWGK,"You sacrifice your name, your body, the love of your life to achieve one goal. You achieved it, but someone later puts those achievements at risk. What do you do? Come out of hiding or run?

  Bruce Wayne (played by Christian Bale) has abandoned the cape and mask so that Batman could never be arrested and prosecuted for the crimes committed by Harvey Dent that he took the fall for. He's been living like a recluse for eight years while Commissioner James Gordon (played by Gary Oldman) has all but extinguished violent crime in Gotham. Gordon wants to reveal the truth during a celebration honoring Harvey Dent but decides the city isn't ready for it. At that same celebration, a congressman is abducted and, while investigating the crime, Gordon is shot. The patrolman who rescues him, John Blake (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is promoted to detective and told he's to report directly the Commissioner. Blake (Gordon-Levitt) knows Batman's true identity and pleads with Wayne to once again don the cape and mask. Commissioner Gordon echoes those sentiments when Wayne, incognito, visits him in the hospital. The kidnapper, a terrorist and mercenary intent on destroying the city, is Bane. Bane (played by Tom Hardy) was once a member of the League of Shadows before being expelled by his and Bruce Wayne's mentor, Ra's al Ghul. Bane was hired by a competitor of Wayne Enterprises, John Daggett (played by Ben Mendelsohn). We're also introduced to a master thief working with Bane, Selina Kyle (played by Anne Hathaway) who is, of course, Catwoman, though she's never addressed by that name.

  I was a latecomer to Nolan's new take on the Batman story. I saw The Dark Knight in theaters, but I didn't catch Batman Begins, the first film in the series, until it began airing on cable. Once I did, I bought the DVD. I bought The Dark Knight on DVD the day of its release. Bale as Batman was amazing in the first two films and he is just as good, if not better, in the third. Hardy as Bane is nowhere near as mesmerizing as Heath Ledger's interpretation of The Joker, but he is far more intimidating. Hathaway as Catwoman is the best version of this character that I have seen to date. Of course, the other versions, portrayed by Michelle Pfeiffer and Halle Berry, were beautiful but one-dimensional. I was hoping this film would be better than its predecessor. Perhaps it's the notion that this means the story is over, but I thought The Dark Knight was the best in the series. That said, Rises is brilliant and anyone who's seen the previous films should see this latest one as soon as possible.",1350518400,4,2601,4.730684326710817
4428048,5,B004LWZWGK,"Christopher Nolan accomplishes the impossible by bringing his third and final installment of the Dark Knight legacy to a satisfying and extremely entertaining close. Christian Bale gives, in my opinion, his best performance as the title hero, and while Tom Hardy's Bane may not have the unpredictability and chaotic nature seen by the Joker, he does a great job at coming off terrifying and menacing, all with a mask covering most of his face. The film doesn't quite meet the standard set so impossibly high by it's predecessor, but it doesn't need to. While it may not stand quite as tall on it's own, it concludes the trilogy in a spectacular and satisfying fashion. It's a remarkable feat to string together three movies so seamlessly, which only increases by respect and love of Nolan's films.

The BD set itself has a lot of great extras, including a bunch of featurettes on the making of the film. I've always been a fan of Nolan's work because of his insistency to do as much as possible without CGI. The making of the plane scene is astounding and it's remarkable that only a few shots within that scene include the use of CGI. I also enjoyed getting an inside look into how Hans Zimmer created the score for the film.

This is a great set if you're looking to finish your collection of the Dark Knight trilogy. The movie is great and the features are very entertaining. I highly recommend it.",1350432000,10,1401,4.645161290322581
4428049,4,B004LWZWGK,"Um, if you have not seen the Dark Knight Rises, I think you are missing out. I think you should go see it, too. If you have a cheap theater in your town that plays movies that our out of the big screen, but not on DVD, GO SEE IT! I personally have seen it three times, but by the 3rd time I did fall asleep. Haha. Nevertheless, great film.

But there is this part that really stuck out to me, and I feel as a Christian (someone who follows Jesus), not Christian Bale, ha, it really had a profound impact! But, it did take three times to make the connection and actually understand what it meant. And I had to draw on other information in my life to make the connection (which I call The Web of Knowledge, when these connection happen). So, here is the seen, most of us probably missed it, but it is worth your time!

Bane had put Batman in the pit, so quickly let's cover the pit, if you do not know what the pit is, it is a prison, that tortures a man mentally. The reason it tortures a man mentally is because he can see out of the pit, but can not make the climb (well, there is actually a place midway through or so that a person has to make a jump from one part to the other that is humanly impossible, so it seems, so basically a person can't make the jump) out to freedom because it is pretty much impossible, but wait, one person has (run on sentence)! As you can see, this is the perfect way to torture Batman, because he is not afraid of physical pain. So Batman not letting a challenge defeat him is determined to get out of the pit to go save his city that is being destroyed. (The climber wears a rope so he can't fall to his death) After he heals, he gives the-climb-to-freedom a try, and well, he falls, he does not make it, bust. We see in another scene he tries it again, and again on his 2nd try, epic fail, he falls, total bust.  =( Sad face. Then, this old doctor guy starts dialoguing with him and it goes like this:

Old Man: Your afraid (to Batman).

Batman: No, I'm angry.

Old Man: You are, that is the reason you can't make the jump.

Batman: (looks like he starts really listening)

Old Man: Your fear of fighting Bane is the reason you cannot make the jump, if you make the jump, you will fall, because you have the rope.

(My commentary: so what the Old Man is saying is because he has a safety net, the rope, to catch him when he falls, his fear of Bane is not allowing him to make the jump. Because deep down in the subconscious he is afraid to fight Bane and his body can't summon up the necessary strength to do it, it's a physiological infirmity, his fear of failure is keeping him in the pit, and his mind not letting him make the jump)

Batman: (looks at Old Man and gives a nod to go on and tell him what to do)

Old Man: You have to make the jump with out the rope

So, when he makes the jump with out the rope, he will then be able to actually make the full jump, because now he has a greater fear, the fear of death driving him on. He can then summon that strength.

So for me, it made me think, in our life what ropes do we have that keep us from doing something? What ropes are holding us back from our goals, our dreams? What holds us back from being all we can be, is it fear of failure? It is a job that pays well, but not something we enjoy? Is it how people see us and the molds and patterns they have us in, so we now we can't break out of the mold people have us in? I'm not sure what you are going through, but as a Christian, we can give God the rope, we can give God the rope to go forward, and let Christ live His life through us. God will give us the strength, through faith to make the jump, and go to freedom, and do what we were meant to do! Amen! Haha.

Yea, I know, I did not see it coming either, it was just there...

Anyhow, hopefully that lifts you a bit. Now let's review the movie.

I thought the movie was okay, it had some good parts, and overall was a good movie that is worth watching. Though having seen it 3 times, a person starts to notice some of the errors and problems. There seems to be a lot of leaps of logic, and to-close-of-calls for me, and some all-too-coincidental-parts, like when Bane fights Batman and Batman is defeated, and then they blow the bottom out of Wayne Enterprises where all Batman's gear is. C'mon, too coincidental. Then, was Bane super human, cause he was breaking cement at the end with his bare hands? And what about the breathing apparatus, what did that do? There are more, I will just have to watch it again.

I did not get how Batman was alive at the end, I know there was auto pilot, but where did he eject and swim to safety? And stop the bleeding after we was stabbed, furthermore, the water would be so polluted from the nuclear fallout from the bomb it is ridiculous!

Also, I thought there was some corny comedy in it, like when Catwoman leaves Batman, and he is like, ""so that is how that feels."" And when he kicks the guy after Robin says he missed a spot, lame!

Then the antagonist woman dies in the truck thing, that was terrible acting! Horrible! Awful! She died so weird, and fake!

One thing, America can not get away from the sacrificial leader, even as anti God as society becomes, we still love Jesus to some degree, because a hero that dies for humanity is what Jesus did, that is the hero type we have as the West. I thought that was funny!

Things I did really enjoy was the movie, I liked it cause I love Batman, he is a human, and struggles with life. But in his struggles he does the right thing, and makes a difference, and does not focus inward. Good message! Also, I love the soundtrack, I already got it! It is great, I really enjoy the that Hanz Zimmer brings to the table on this!

But in comparison to the other movies, I give it an 8, with the other two a 9.5!

It is worth your time, and is a great cinematic adventure, but there was to many inconsistencies for me, that I could not stand! I will have to re-watch and get back to guys to point them out! Thanks for reading, also let me your thoughts, I would like to hear!",1350432000,6,6061,4.083333333333333
4428050,3,B004LWZWGK,"This movie has no real sense of plotting or pace. The final confrontation with Bane is so lousy. (Catwoman shoots him, and that's it. Yikes, that's awful.) The plot twist, where we find out Bane isn't even the main villain, was quite possibly the worst thing Nolan could've done to us. It made little sense and felt completely unnecessary.

The plot holes and continuity errors are very noticeable: the sudden shift from day to night after the Wall Street heist took me out of the movie for a few minutes, and why did Bane take Gotham City hostage for THREE MONTHS? Obviously it was so Bruce could have enough time to return, but Bane didn't think he would. It was a lazy plot device by the filmmakers. Everyone keeps praising Anne Hathaway for her performance as Catwoman, but I can't help wonder what was so special. She practically whispered every line in the movie and that's it.

I've never liked Nolan's disrespectful approach to the material, refusing to use some of the best villains just because they're silly, never referring to Catwoman AS Catwoman, changing the Batmobile to some dumb, ugly tank. He nearly ruined Batman for me, especially with this sad last film and its cliched nuclear-bomb finale. That was sillier than Killer Croc and The Penguin put together.

The story line disjointed and Batman had left the scene. The best part of the movie is Cat Woman. She's sexy, she's smart and she's more interesting than the villain or the Batman. Yes, there are some spectacular action scenes. Scenes that are getting to be very predictable. A massive implosion. Stealing a prisoner off an airplane. Batman miraculously recovers after barely being able to walk because his body is so worn out from crime fighting. The story line actually would have been better if it stayed with the storyline of the comic book it was based on. The Batman would have been older but still strong, with the kind of aches that come with the territory of aging. Instead we get Christian Bale, slumped over, with a goatee, as a virtual cripple. The bad guy was completely boring and unintelligible until the end of the film, which is where all the bombs are finally dropped. This was probably two movies crushed into one movie and it made the storyline run full tilt and all over the map trying to tie it all together. I think the very end was the best part of movie because you know there's going to be a second chance to do better than this film.",1350345600,2,1310,4.531645569620253

4428056,5,B004LWZWGK,"Somehow he did it. Christopher Nolan has completed, for me, the ultimate Batman series. Ever since I was a child reading Batman and Detective Comics in the late 70's I've always wanted to see Batman on the big screen. But the Tim Burton/Joel Schumacher films didn't quite satisfy me. No, I wanted a grittier Batman, not necessarily the darker Frank Miller style, but still somewhat grounded in reality. A Batman, Alfred, Commissioner Gordon and Rogue's Gallery that bares resemblance to that of the Denny O'Neil era, or possibly the later Jeph Loeb years.

Then, in 2005, BATMAN BEGINS is released into theaters. Compared to Bat-movies of the past, it arrived with surprisingly modest hype. I guess we were all weary and cautious from the BATMAN & ROBIN debacle that came before it. Still, I had fairly high hopes as I sat in the theater. And before my eyes I saw the greatest Batman film ever...well, at the time anyway. Here was the ideal incarnation of Bruce Wayne/Batman as played by the intense young Christian Bale. Gary Oldman was a happy surprise as a Jim Gordon not that far removed from the depiction out of the graphic novel ""Batman: Year One"". Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, a character from the Denny O'Neil comics, which was wonderful to see. Also included from the O'Neil years is the character Ra's al Ghul, and who better to portray an older yet sufficiently intimidating warrior than Liam Neeson? Finally, they cast Michael Caine, my favorite actor, as Wayne's loyal Butler Alfred. Add a fantastic version of the Scarecrow (aka Jonathon Crane) and my dream was realized. The movie was well filmed. The screenplay was intelligent and the source material taken seriously. By the end, I felt like I was watching the Batman onscreen for the very first time.

Three years later The Dark Knight is released and presented probably Batman's greatest crime thriller put to film. Featuring a fully formed, terrifying Joker. I always thought Batman's arch enemy should not be so much ""funny"" as he should be scary as hell. And, as we all know by now, Heath Ledger succeeded beyond all expectations. He created one of the all time great movie villains. Factor in the central character of Harvey Dent (and a personal favorite villain Two-Face) and we have what many consider the greatest Comic Book movie of all time.

Which is why Nolan's follow up had such high expectations. Everyone wondered how THE DARK KNIGHT RISES could top THE DARK KNIGHT. That was never a question for me. I never expect a sequel to top a prior film in order to be good, or even great. I expect it to be a good story. If Nolan had one more good Batman story left in him, I'd be one happy Bat fan!

And did he ever!

Nolan and the screenwriters decided the only way to make a third film was to conclude Batman's story. It's a stroke of genius. Whenever I review movies on Amazon I usually stray from synopses and plot points. This is primarily out of laziness and because I'm more excited about my general feelings regarding the film. I'll just say that eight years after the final moments of THE DARK KNIGHT, Bruce Wayne's body and spirit have been damaged. He's a recluse, leaving Alfred to take care of Wayne Manor and Fox to run Wayne Enterprises. Batman and Gordon have seemingly made Gotham City a better place, with less organized crime, yet it's only a facade. There's evil brewing underneath the streets of Gotham with a grand scheme to turn the city on it's head. This evil is led by an international terrorist known only as Bane. And caught in the middle is cat burglar Selina Kyle. Anne Hathaway is a thief alright as she steals every scene she's in. Sometimes Nolan's Batman films have been called too dark and serious, but I have to say Hathaway's Selina (let's call her what she is, Catwoman!) is one of the most fun characters to grace any Batman film. I admit I've never appreciated the character Bane in the comics. He seemed like such a conveniently brainy yet brawny bad guy. Plus Bane looks like a Mexican wrestler...which is just weird. So, while I don't want to say I was worried, I was curious why the filmmakers chose Bane of all characters to pit against Batman. Now I know. Given the story, the villain could only be Bane (well, perhaps not only, wink). Instead of tights and a wrestler's mask, Bane sports a military uniform, hulking muscles and a contraption on his face that allows him to breath painlessly. His mask intimidates and conjures slight recollections of Darth Vader. And Tom Hardy's Bane is an absolute force of nature. He is smart. He is strong. He's a field general and a soldier all his own...

...and the initial confrontation between he and Batman is one of the greatest moments of any Batman film, certainly the most horrifying. I think it will be as classic as the Batman/Joker interrogation scene from THE DARK KNIGHT.

As I've already given away, Bruce comes out of ""retirement"" to save Gotham once more. There's a heck of a lot to discuss regarding this film. There's all kinds of subtext and plot points and twists which I will leave alone. I will simply say that Bruce Wayne's journey in this film is (and perhaps has always been) about tragedy, triumph and sacrifice. THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is epic. It's large scale. It covers a lot of ground. I've heard a few say there's not enough Batman and not enough fights. I must respectfully disagree. There's plenty of Batman and plenty of incredible action, with refreshingly few digital effects. There's also a lot of Batman's alter ego, Bruce Wayne. And why shouldn't there be? This is Bruce Wayne's story. And while Wayne and Batman were always considered different personas in the previous Nolan films, both are closer than ever here. Batman and Bruce Wayne are almost one and the same this time around. This is not a continuity error. This is an indication that Wayne is no longer interested in carrying on the rich playboy public image. It seems he's long since taken off that mask and has no intention of putting it back on. That's my take anyway. My point being while watching THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, I no longer felt I was only watching Bruce in some scenes or only watching Batman in others...it was always the same guy. Although the Batsuit is still really, really cool!

While Bale has been excellent in the trilogy, he gives his best performance of the character in THE DARK KNIGHT RISES. Freeman is solid, as always. Oldman is an older Gordon, also scarred emotionally from the events of the last film. Consequently, Oldman gives perhaps his best performance in a Batman film. Marion Cotillard and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are new additions to the series yet are critical to the plot and certainly leave a lasting impression. And, as you might expect, Michael Caine's Alfred provides the heart of this story. There is an emotional impact to THE DARK KNIGHT RISES that I've never experienced in a comic book movie. Caine is one of the reasons why. There is a heartbreaking speech by Alfred that feels so genuine one could have heard a pin drop between sniffles from the audiences around me.

That's what makes this Bat film unique. I have nothing against the other fine comic book films out there. This year alone provided a couple of incredibly fun, fantastic superhero movies that I enjoyed tremendously. But when it's all said and done, they feel like sweet dessert to THE DARK KNIGHT RISES' steak dinner. Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy has given us substance, thrills, scares, twists and, with this final film, tears.

People want to compare THE DARK KNIGHT RISES to it's predecessors. That's just not how I view Nolan's trilogy. All three films are critical by themselves. BATMAN BEGINS is the perfect Batman origin film. THE DARK KNIGHT is the perfect Batman crime drama. And THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is Batman's perfect finale. Together they make a phenomenal series and one of the greatest trilogies of all time.

So...I can't tell you THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is the best of the Batman films, but I can tell you it's my favorite. Maybe that will change one day and I'll decide it's THE DARK KNIGHT or BATMAN BEGINS. That's how much they mean to me. That's how thankful I am that Chris Nolan brought my Batman to life.",1350086400,9,8204,4.698191933240612
4428057,5,B004LWZWGK,This movie was very realistic. I like how it explains about Batman's absences in Gotham City and what was very hilarious was how Bruce Wayne was losing his fortune. Tom Hardy did a great job playing as Bane which was ten times better than what the late Jeep Swensen did in that terrible 1997 Batman & Robin. The ending was brilliant how Wayne was still alive and moved to Italy  with Catwoman and the rookie becoming the next Batman. Very enjoyable.,1350086400,6,449,4.54320987654321

4428059,5,B004LWZWGK,"(Minor spoilers)
  The Dark Knight Rises is third and (supposed) final movie in The Dark Knight series. I will try to keep this movie review as spoiler free as I can. First, this is my favorite movie of the year but not just for reasons you may think. Yes, the action sequences have good build up and the tone of the movie show a more vulnerable Bruce Wayne/Batman.  The vulnerability of Batman is what has helped make him become on of the favorites.

  If you truly look past some of the stuff on the surface (for instance Bane silly voice) you will find a message on manhood and helping others. This movie is more about Bruce Wayne as he struggles with his past decisions and defining himself. My favorite scene in the movie is where Bruce has to get out of a pit and keeps failing. In order for him to get out of the pit he has to confront his past and realize you cannot change the past. Instead the movie shows the best you can do is confront your fears and move forward.

  The movie's villain Bane helps show the vulnerability of Batman and I understand why he was chosen for this film. He's imposing, stronger,faster, and more ruthless. Batman has never faced a foe such as him in the other films. But as the theme of the movie states ""You don't have to wear a mask to a be a hero"" and Batman is not alone.

  Everyone gives a strong performance and are aided by a great soundtrack (though more subdued than The Dark Knight). Some others will eloquently point out things in story that could have flowed better which are valid points. The Dark Knight Rises themes make it worth checking out and as always Batman does what he does. That's be a BOSS. I highly recommend this movie even over The Avengers.",1350086400,4,1709,4.356466876971608

Believe me, not for <way> too long a time.

This movie has no story, it's characters have no heart, it has no sensible back story, it's just one explosion after another, one betrayal after another, with nothing that makes any sense to hold it together.

And we need lots of explosions - let's make him blow up ALL of Gotham City.  Why?  Who cares?  Nobody who sees the movie will care, so why should be bother to come up with a reason?""

4428067,5,B004LWZWGK,"Many have said ""The Dark Knight"" is the strongest entry in Christopher Nolan's Batman Story starring Christian Bale.  It is a strong film that cemented Nolan as a master at directing bigger pictures.  However, as many times as I have seen TDK I always walk away feeling there is still something important missing in the film.  The only part of the film that worked beautifully was Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker.  Bale's performance as Bruce Wayne that was handled with care in ""Batman Begins,"" was greatly overshadowed in the overall story of TDK, despite the intensity of his acting in the suit.  As a result the story in TDK was just focused on its commentary of control versus chaos placing the growth of its hero in the background.  In the end I felt Chris Nolan and his crew could do even better and that the second film was a prelude to greatness.

I am not giving away any spoilers, since this is a film best seen if you know as little about the story as possible.

In ""The Dark Knight Rises"" Nolan and his crew more than made up for the shortcomings of its predecessor.  Along with his co-writers, his brother Jonathan, and David S. Goyer, Nolan returned the focus of their story to what gave its initial strength:  the main hero.  Christian Bale gives his best performance as Bruce Wayne as a recovering, but very wounded individual whose life as Batman has physically and mentally drained him of living a balanced life after eight years of retirement.  Bale manages to convey more emotion in his face, body, and voice than he did in the previous two chapters, taking Bruce Wayne beyond the boundaries of a superhero. Instead he portrays Wayne as a fragile man turned freedom fighter bent on purging Gotham of it's remaining threats to give the people of his city the living environment they deserve.

Going back to Bale's emotional performance, one factor I loved about Bruce Wayne's character in ""The Dark Knight Rises"" was that we got to see more of Bale's performance without the bat suit.  After seeing Bale's reinvention of the character in ""Batman Begins"" I grew to care more about the man underneath the mask.  He is an awesome actor and it was tiring to see the majority of Bale's acting in the suit for ""The Dark Knight.""  As a result, Nolan maintains the heart of Bruce Wayne's story in ""The Dark Knight Rises"" by keeping him unmasked.

While focusing his final chapter on Wayne's character arc, Nolan still manages to create an enthralling equation with his rich ensemble cast, both with new and returning characters.  Bale shares some of his strongest screen time with every actor in the film and vice versa.  Michael Caine is magnificent as Bruce's butler, Alfred who portrays the character with a aching fatherly love that is difficult to look away from.  Gary Oldman portrays Commissioner James Gordon as a man desperate to maintain his humanity after everything that has happened in Gotham City.  Then there is Joseph Gordon Levitt as Detective John Blake who is a great supporting character that serves as a bridge for Bruce Wayne and Gordon to unite again for their mission.  As Lucius Fox, Wayne's weapons engineer, Morgan Freeman portrays the character with more of the comic warmth and resourcefulness that has made his supporting role special.  Another character who turns out to be a surprise is Matthew Modine as Deputy Commissioner Foley.  He develops from an arrogant cop to a selfless figure of the law, willing to lay down his life to protect the city.  Every character in the film has an important purpose in Wayne's story as they are inspired, or influenced to combat the conflict in his journey.

While not as hypnotic as Ledger's Joker, Tom Hardy still creates a powerful portrayal of Bane that brings a different kind of threat to Gotham City.  Through out the film half of Hardy's face is covered in a mask, but the viewer easily forgets that he has one due to the amount of attention he utilizes in his forehead, eyes, and voice.  Bane ultimately serves as the worst case scenario in Nolan's story, if everything the characters worked for was undone.  Bane's physicality and brain become essential to the hero's development.  He is a villain who parallels Wayne, representing his accumulated pain as a result of his journey.  If the filmmakers had gone with a villain similar to the Joker, it would have diminished the film's intended message and would have been a redundant mess.

A massive plus in this film that was lacking in both ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight"" was the love interest for Bruce Wayne.  It was a wise choice for Nolan to retire Rachel Dawes from the series.  No matter how hard I tried I could never grow attach to her character.  She had a cold demeanor, was bloated with attitude, and rarely showed affection towards Bruce.  It was difficult to see how a love relationship began between them in the first place besides sharing a childhood together.  In ""The Dark Knight Rises"" there is the beautiful Anne Hathaway as the iconic Selina Kyle/Catwoman and the equally hypnotizing Marion Cotillard as Wayne board member, Miranda Tate.  Both women are sexy and desirable who share wonderful chemistry with Bale.  In staying faithful to Nolan's universe, Cotillard and Hathaway brighten their characters with a genuine humanity that makes them both feel as if they could exist in our reality.  As opposed to Rachel Dawes, Selina and Miranda are women who are reflections, or equals to Bruce himself.  Selina is a ""Robin Hood"" type who admires Bruce for his lack of selfishness and Miranda for his dedication in honoring his family's legacy.

Wally Pfister's cinematography for the film is nothing less than extraordinary.  The footage looks exceptionally beautiful for being such a dark film.  Whether shot in an ancient prison or in the snow at night, or day in the city, every frame manages to capture your senses and never let you go.  Nolan and Pfister maintain the reality of the Gotham they've developed for the previous films and at the same time create a beautiful atmosphere of dark contrast with bright color to bring life into the dying city.  The scope of Gotham City and the world around it has been increased due to the fact that Nolan decided to shoot the film in New York, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, London, and Jodhpur.  As a result the film has the feeling of a grand epic that helps expand the world of Bruce Wayne and the freedom of the lead characters.

Hans Zimmer's soundtrack for The Dark Knight Rises is the most powerful and heartfelt of the trilogy.  He brings the urban bass tone from the previous films while mixing fresh tracks of operatic noir with beautiful tones of calm closure for the characters' story.  The chant ""Deshi Basara"" (Moroccan Arabic for ""Rise up"") that Zimmer composed with his chorus and the voices he collected on UJAM gives the viewer an incredible surge of inspiration in bringing Bruce's destiny full circle.

Christopher Nolan brings his best skills as a writer and director in ""The Dark Knight Rises.""  It is the best film about Bruce Wayne/Batman and a fulfilling conclusion to one of the most epic trilogies in cinematic history.  As opposed to most third entries in popular trilogies (The Matrix Revolutions, The Godfather Part III, Spider-Man 3), this one looks and feels as if the filmmakers took their time to get everything just right.  It is a different kind of superhero film that is unmatched.  Even at 164 minutes the film never has a dull, or wasted moment and the viewer will forget about the time that is passing by outside the theater.  Nolan has completed a near perfect story as a result of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" with careful storytelling and passionate performances from every actor in the cast.",1349827200,4,7746,4.782706766917293
4428068,1,B004LWZWGK,"This film really was awful  other than the fact its much to long and Batman himself is in it 15 minutes and when he is in it he is more like a supporting character in Bane's story and the story itself is just wacky.

Then one day arch criminal Bane comes along and steals this nuclear device and turns it into a bomb to hold Gotham to ransom. Agains the wishes of Alfred who leaves him in objection Bruce once again dons the bat suit. He goes has his first encounter with Bane and the result is he has his back broken bones sticking out and all and then taken to a far off land by Bane and thrown into some prison in a deep pit. Well after a couple of months in the pit with no medical attention Bruce's broken back heals, he is fitter than he has ever been and manages to climb out of this pit which it turns out Bane was the only one before him whoever managed. Well Bruce somehow gets back to Gotham gets himself a new bat suit goes to have another showdown with Bane but this time he kicks his ass but just as he is on the verge of finishing him off Bruce gets literally stabbed in the back by his new love interest who turns out is the brains behind the whole plan of Bane's and is the daughter of the late Rhas Al Ghul. Cat Woman ( now Batman's ally ) and with a good old fashioned shotgun kills Mr super strong Bane who has had his trigger on a nuclear weapon and creating mayhem in the city for months. ( If only Bruce had thought of that first time round ). Well Rhas Al Ghul's daughter steals the nuke and arms it oh no it looks like Gothem is about to go up un a mushroom cloud until Batman gets out his flying machine and flies the nuke out tosea where it detonates away from Gotham.  Result is the people of Gotham now see Batman as a hero and build him a statue, Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, a rookie cop John Blake who has been helping Batman and Gordon who now both know his secret identity along with Alfred hold a funeral for Bruce at Wayne Manor which has been left to the orphans, turns out Blake's real name is Robin and he quits the police to go work with the orphans and he discovers the bat cave. It finishes with Alfred taking a holiday abroad and he is sitting in a restaurant and he sees sitting at a table across the room Bruce Wayne having a romantic dinner with Cat Woman. They acknowledge each other but say nothing. So looks like Batman can even survive nuclear bombs Between all this there are lots of plots and sub plots which seem to fizzle out before they reach a conclusion.

Christian Bale, Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, and Morgan Freeman were wonderful AS ALWAYS.
I'm sure Marion Cotillard was great as an actress- but I am a little bias because I did not like her character. And I didn't get the deal with her and Bane. Were they supposed to be romantic or not?
Anne Hathaway... puke! I don't know, I felt like some of her lines sounded cheesy like, ""My mother told me not to get into cars with strange men.""

4428075,5,B004LWZWGK,"I was probably more excited for this film than any other I've ever seen (with the possible exception of its predecessor, the Dark Knight), and it did not disappoint. TDKR was a more-than-fitting conclusion to what is, in my opinion, one of the greatest film trilogies of all time.

Performances were stellar across the board:

- Christian Bale's portrayal of a grief-ridden/nigh-broken, yet genuinely heroic Bruce Wayne only further solidifies my view of him as the best Batman to ever grace the big screen. Those who take issue with his heavily gruff ""Batman voice"" will find no comfort in Rises (no surprise), but, as someone who embraces that aspect of Bale's spin on the character and appreciates his understanding of what Batman is ultimately about, I'm more than pleased with the Caped Crusader.

- Tom Hardy was a brilliant Bane. Nolan did well not to follow the comics too closely with this character (TDKR's Bane is close enough to his comic book version to maintain adequate familiarity, but not ridiculously so). Furthermore, while I can understand the complaints about Bane's mask sometimes muffling his voice, I was highly, highly fascinated and entertained nearly every time he spoke. In that regard, I believe that Hardy made the character his own - turning in a performance that reflected enough of both our world AND the spirit of the comics to please a wide array of audiences. One thing I love to sense about a film's villain is a great presence, and that's something I felt each time Bane made an appearance. It's not the easiest thing to explain, but all of the villians in this trilogy had it. There was little-to-no wasted screen time with Scarecrow, Ra's Al Ghul, or the Joker in previous installments, and Bane is no exception here.

- I was probably in the minority with Anne Hathaway; I expected her to do well. Even so, I was surprised by just how well she did. She captures Catwoman's ethical ambiguity and strong personality beautifully. Never does she seem overmatched or out of place in scenes alongside Bruce Wayne or Batman, and, like Hardy, she fits rather seamlessly into Nolan's film-world overall. Though the internal conflict she struggles with isn't something I haven't seen before with characters of her type, she expresses it in such a way to make it worth caring about. Great stuff.

- Marion Cotillard and Joseph Gordon-Levitt also leave their marks on the film in a very good way, albeit in smaller roles (or so it would seem). Gordon-Levitt especially shines as police officer John Blake, who's genuine desire to serve and protect is much like Commissioner Gordon's. Also like Gordon, Blake is a largely unheralded, yet courageously dedicated combatant in the raging battle between good and evil on Gotham's streets. Don't confuse goodness with cheesiness here though; the air of innocence surrounding Blake is as engaging as the corruption for which Gotham's finest is mostly known. Marion Cotillard (or Miranda Tate, as she's known in the movie) probably had the least to work with of any major player as it pertains to character development. Still, she was more than interesting enough to keep me wondering about her true role in the plot. Great twist involving her character.

- Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman are all brilliant as usual. No more need be said about them.

The performances above also contribute to some of the movie's best scenes. One in particular - Batman's first meeting with Bane and the developments which ensued - might be my favorite of the entire trilogy. Hardy was brilliant here at capturing that combination of genius and cold, calculating physicality which makes Bane one of Batman's deadliest enemies. Gordon-Levitt, Hathaway, Oldman and Caine also come to mind when I think of the movie's best moments. No need to narrow it down though; the Dark Knight Rises itself is a masterpiece.",1349654400,9,3879,4.949308755760368
4428076,3,B004LWZWGK,"On my first day of third grade, my teacher delighted every school boy or girl present, including myself, when she said, ""Class, as of today, everyone has an A."" The smiles were huge, but they were soon followed by grumbles. Could it really be so easy? Of course, it wasn't. My teacher explained, ""Everyone has an A, but from this point on, each grade beneath it takes away from that A."" In short, it was a trick--a way to make students prone to thinking they were starting with nothing and working towards greatness as thinking they were starting with greatness and they only had to sustain. In regards to Christopher Nolan, who is one of the greatest living writers period, this scale is no trick. It's a requirement. You must judge Nolan on a scale of greatness, then determine if he sustained it, and while Christopher Nolan has never made a bad movie, he got dangerously close in The Dark Knight Rises (DRK).

So, what's wrong with the DKR? How can the third movie of a successful franchise, using the same creators, the same cast, and one of the biggest budgets in movie history fall short? It's the same thing that sinks most movies in its position, the writing wasn't there. Post DK, Christopher Nolan has been extremely busy, including making his dream movie, the mega-successful and mentally-titillating Inception, and he (I'm including his brother in ""he"") never got the opportunity to finish the DKR script, which is the script's largest problem--it's not bad, it's incomplete. Nolan is one of the most technically sound writers in Hollywood. This guy never makes a mistake, his every line of dialogue pushes the story forward, he follows storytelling theory to its core, focusing on building familiar settings, strong antagonists, helpers who have clearly defined roles, breaks his scripts into three clear acts, and always pays off in the ""final battle,"" and upon its conclusion, the protagonist always become ""the master of two worlds."" These aren't talents Christopher Nolan was blessed with, they're signs of a precise, obsessive, and brilliant writer, someone who's entire existence is devoted to the page, and to top it off, Nolan frequently flaunts his flare for non-chronological timelines, which are nearly Shakespearian in their careful balance and meticulous execution.

All of this is missing from the DKR.

Is it the result of a bad script? Or was the story anemic?

First off, there were signs that Nolan's Batman franchise was fatigued. (Many noticed that DK was a rewritten version of The Prestige). In DKR, these signs became reality.

Bruce Wayne's butler Alfred, played by Michael Caine, is Bruce's wiseman and trusted source of perspective. In BB, after Bruce returns from saving Rachel from Scarecrow, Alfred shares needed insight to Bruce by saying, ""You're getting lost inside this monster of yours."" This comment returns the story to one of identity before Ra's re-enters the plot (like one minute later). Alfred's informing the audience that only by being Bruce Wayne and Batman in unity will Bruce defeat Ra's al Ghul, or else Bruce is ""just a vigilante."" It seems heady and unnecessary to analyze the film this deeply, but man does it ever pay off, especially during the final battle, when Bruce fights Ra's al Ghul on a train, which Bruce's father built, that's on a collision course with Wayne Tower, a destiny Bruce has long feared, in a fight where Ra's al Ghul tells Bruce, ""You were just an ordinary man in a cape, that's why you can't fight injustice."" In the end, Bruce does become more than himself or Batman, finding a superior identity, he defeats Ra's and preserves the Wayne legacy despite his father's home and train being destroyed. In DK, Alfred offers needed insight into Joker when he shares the story of a crazed man stealing jewels in the jungle, which informs Bruce that Joker is not a ""common criminal,"" and it informs the audience that Bruce is underestimating the Joker. By doing so, Alfred is also sharing with us how, should Bruce choose to gain this sacred knowledge, he will eventually triumph.

In DKR, Alfred does not deliver a story of immense insight, he's asked to simply set up the ending, where we see Bruce Wayne living a new life away from Gotham. To complicate things, this scene also sets the tone of what is DKR's worst flaw, indulgence. For a writer who's known for his restraint, Nolan packed DKR with little needed side-scenes. Here you have Michael Caine, one of the greatest actors of all time at his rare specialty, the actor who makes boring but necessary dialogue interesting, an under-appreciated day laborer working for bosses making huge bonuses off his sweat, and all you really have to do, in Nolan's position, is not over think it. Do what you did in BB and DK and let Michael Caine tell the story, let the camera watch him stoically, and do absolutely nothing else. However, Nolan chose to cutaway to a depiction of Alfred's story, which was heart-wrenching as it gave away the final twist. It was an unfortunate risk that didn't pay off for Nolan, and that happens, but it's an indulgence because (I feel) it's likely the audience would've remembered Alfred's story without the cutaway. It's doubtful that Michael Caine is anyone's favorite actor, yet we all know one thing: When Caine speaks, we listen.

Before I stray too far from my premise, I will concede that my argument thus far begs the question. If Alfred always has insight to offer on the antagonist, why does Alfred have none to offer in DKR? Alfred has none because, technically, DKR has no antagonist. In any good story, the antagonist is the character who represents all the protagonist's fear, guilt and denial. (This is why the Joker is Batman's ultimate villain). Or to be brief, it's the character who wants to prevent the protagonist from reaching his/her goal. So who is the antagonist of DRK? Is it Bane? No, it's not. We find out at the end that Bane isn't doing what he's doing to stop Batman from fixing Gotham. He's doing it because of an immense, and subsequently pathetic, love for Talia al Ghul. But, wait... It's obviously Talia al Ghul, isn't it? Wrong again! Talia claims that her motivation is finishing her father's work. If her father's dream was to blow up Miami Beach, she'd have done so. It's a powerful motivator for her character, but it also means she's not Batman's nemesis.

So who is the antagonist of DKR? It's Ra's al Ghul.

It turns out that DKR is a bigger version of BB, which might've worked, except it ends up being hollow, we don't get a pay off, because Ra's al Ghul was defeated two movies ago. We know he cannot beat Bruce, and we know Bruce has already gained all the ""sacred knowledge"" necessary to defeat Ra's, and so Bruce is already the ""master of two worlds"" in this challenge. He's just, you know, older. Sometimes Alfred pointed out at nauseum.

At the end of BB, Bruce tries to tell Rachel that Batman is just a symbol, and Rachel tells him it's untrue, that Batman is no longer a mask. In DK, she writes Bruce a letter telling him that he'll always need Batman. Both of these stories confirm Alfred's insight in BB, which was that Bruce had to become something more than Batman or Bruce. By having Bruce face Ra's al Ghul again in DKR, we draw Bruce into another identity crisis, but this one is harder to maneuver without Rachel. There're few characters who know both Bruce and Batman equally, so it falls on Alfred to do it, and he proceeds to abandon Bruce, essentially equating Bruce's drive to save Gotham to that of a deranged and suicidal alcoholic.

Using Talia and Bane worsens the identity crisis plotline. As the saying goes, the protagonist is only as strong as the antagonist, and as Christopher Nolan knows, and temporarily forgot for DKR, all antagonists should be fanatical in their pursuits. Consider BB, where Ra's knows no limit in his view of justice, and then DK, where Joker so radically subscribes to anarchy that he mocks ""cause and effect"" theory by changing the origin story of his scars on his every recollection. In essence, despite being the most radical of the three movies, DKR is not a story of fanaticism, it's a story of love---it's the tragedy of Bane's love for Talia, and Talia's love for her father, and since neither pursuit represents fanaticism, we know our antagonists don't actually believe in their actions, which means they lack identity, as well.

For plenty of DKR, we listen to unintelligible speeches about how Gotham's being ""returned to the people,"" which feels engineered since none of Gotham's citizens are actual planners or participators in this revolution, except for maybe a few hundred people in the sewers and 1,000 released prisoners. (BTW, in DK, didn't Nolan show us that even prisoners have morality? Why are they so willing, in DKR, to supplant an entire society? If it's true that these prisoners are locked up by Dent's law, then they're locals and they have families who're going to die.) Because of this, when Batman arrives at the final battle, beating down Bane, shouting, ""Where is the trigger? I know you wouldn't give it to an average citizen"" it feels anti-climatic. As an audience, we've known this data for hours, but Batman's only now catching up? Where is the journey we take with one of the world's greatest detectives? (Answer: We can't take it! He was stuck in a hole on the other side of the world...FOREVER.) Sure, Bane's claims of giving the button to an ""average citizen"" is, I suppose, a nice play on what the Joker did in DK, but I don't see why it was necessary in DKR.

As if the final battle in DKR wasn't flawed enough, it's felt like Batman says more than he does in all of BB and DK combined. We're talking about a dark, mysterious figure so powerful that his nemesis's often speak for him. In DK, when hung off the edge of the building, mobster Salvatore Maroni surmises the situation for Batman, saying, ""From one professional to another, if you're trying to scare somebody, pick a better spot. From this height, the fall wouldn't kill me,"" which of course leaves Batman to say in his cold as ice manner, ""I'm counting on it."" When confronting Bane in DKR, on the steps of Gotham's City Hall (I believe), in response to Bane's taunt, Batman blandly says, ""I came here to stop you."" (If Nolan had been on his game, Bane would have said, ""Have you come here to stop me, Batman?"" and Batman would've said, ""[enter comeback here]."")

All these elements in DKR are tied together by the classic movie convention, a time bomb, which is, in actuality, a writers way of saying, ""Since the entire universe is going to end simultaneously, all these plotlines must be related, right?"" But, in this is where Nolan becomes the victim. How could he have anticipated the Japanese tsunami and pursuant reactor crisis? When he wrote the script, he had to feel comfortable with it, yet when his audience sees it now, things like ""blast radius,"" ""radioactive decay,"" and, ""weaponized,"" are not terms we let graze past us. We know nuclear reactors can't detonate like a bomb, they need to be designed specifically as a bomb, and that weapons grade materials aren't safe for day-in and day-out power generation. Had Nolan known that we'd know this, Lucius Fox would've given a sentence or two to dismiss it, or invented a reason why fusion generation can explode catastrophically. Regardless, when we learn that it takes months for the radioactive decay to reach a critical point of instability (which I think is backwards, but I'm not a nuclear physicist, so what do I know), it feels eerily similiar to Japan's reactor meltdowns, which took weeks to be stabilized, yet because of the Japan crisis, we know it's ridiculous to even contemplate that the process, the decay or the meltdown, can be bolted down to an exact second five months in advance.

The science of the bomb plot bit Nolan in the butt, but where Nolan owns fault is in his story application of the bomb, which is problematic. Supposedly, Batman flies out over the bay, sacrificing his life to save the city (something which would resolve his identity crisis and confirm that, yes, the merged identities in BB did happen). Though, because of the DKR's beginning, I was expecting Alfred to go on vacation, stop for a drink, and look for Bruce, so the fake funeral beforehand was tedious, cause I was 2hrs 30mins in and I still hadn't gotten a pay-off, I was still waiting for Bruce to become the master of two worlds for DKR, and I knew that was impossible if he was dead. Of course, DKR does cut to Alfred drinking and looking up at Bruce with Selina Kyle, which offers its own closure. If Bruce needed Batman to come to terms with his parent's death, perhaps ridding himself of Batman, and using the ""Clean Slate"" program to give both him and his new love a chance at happiness, represents becoming a master of two worlds, but that is also problematic since, if it's true, then Bruce was his own antagonist in DKR, and if he was his own antagonist, why bring back Ra's al Ghul? And if Bruce was his own antagonist, and Ra's was just a symbol of that antagonist, and if Bruce didn't actually die on his helicopter flight, and he always knew he wouldn't die on it, then what exactly was the final battle, who won it, and does it even matter?

In the end, Nolan created a meaning paradox. Everything about this movie begs the question.

These contradictions in DKR null and void more than just the antagonist question. Most of the plot is built on the political and judicial reforms enacted after Harvey Dent's death, and it ties the deception involved in Harvey Dent's death to the failure of these protocols (crime goes down, but it's only because they've pushed all the poor and downtrodden into the sewers). Lots of time is spent in DKR talking about the ""truth"" and bringing it forward. Indeed, Bane does read Commissioner Gordon's unread speech, spilling the truth about Harvey's demise, which I guess every Gothamite wholly believed since no one questioned it. In fact, after Bane said this great secret, it was barely mentioned again. At the conclusion, Harvey Dent is outed as Two Face, and Batman is recognized as the true white knight of Gotham, but this in itself represents another contradiction. When Bruce decided to fake his death, or Batman's, he may have metaphorically killed Batman, but in reality, Batman becomes just another Harvey Dent, another fallen martyr who didn't actually die for Gotham.

Wasn't that what caused the conditions for the third movie?

In the end, I guess, Bruce's identity crisis between himself and Batman gets resolved when defeating his mentor, a man talented at multiple identities and deception in Ra's al Ghul (BB), goes onto to create a lie about Harvey Dent's death to stimulate collective action in Gotham and squash the Joker's plans for anarchy (DK), yet in DKR, we find out that Bruce didn't really resolve any identity crisis in BB, he never really needed to become Batman, and while it was a mistake to tell the lie he told in DK, it's okay to tell it again so that he can move to Europe and hook-up constantly with Selina Kyle.

(Not that I blame him!!!!)

So what could've given DKR a puncher's chance?

Two movies.

What Christopher Nolan tried to create, he is more than capable of doing, but he needed an extra ninety minutes to balance it in the special way only he can. Being such a traditionalist, Nolan might despise the idea that Harry Potter, Twilight, and the Hobbit are being turned into multiple movies from singular sources, but DKR would have done well to have a Part I and Part II, six months apart from each other, a la Harry Potter. The first movie ends when Batman gets his back broken. The second opens on a montage of him healing. It saves us the twenty minutes where he lays around immobilized on a mat, and it provides time to fill story holes and develop a proper antagonist. Ra's al Ghul can easily be a big part of this story, but he needs to be an inspiration to Talia, a catalyst for bigger things.

All that said, you can fall too far down the rabbit hole in regards to Christopher Nolan. He still gets top notch performances out of Christian Bale, Jason Gordon-Levitt, and a bit to my surprise, Anne Hathaway, who's an understated master at facial expressions (who knew?). The script, while flawed philosophically, has all the witty banter one expects from the likes of Nolan, including a few good jokes between Alfred and Bruce, a few good love-jabs between Selina and Bruce, and I think even Bane managed to turn a phrase or two. To paraphrase what I said earlier, it's not that this movie is bad, it's not that the script is bad, it's just not finished. Nolan could've done better with these pieces, and I think in time, he will say, ""If I could do it again, I'd have given myself another 2 years to finish Batman."" Who knows if that extra time could've have taken DKR to the level of BB and DK, aren't all the third movies in trilogies awful? In the end, the standards and protocols, ""the way things have always been done,"" states that no series is complete unless it's a trilogy at the minimum, but perhaps in Nolan's Bat trilogy, two movies were more than enough.",1349654400,33,17208,4.7130984042553195

The Dark Knight Rises borrows many elements from The Dark Knight Returns and Batman: Knightfall, but DO NOT think this is a straight forward adaptation of those storys. This just borrows some key plot elements, and becomes a stand alone movie. It's alot like what Nolan did with Batman Begins, as that one was heavily inspired by Batman: Year one, but became its own story.

WARNING: I may SPOIL The SECOND installment, The DARK KNIGHT, in DETAIL.

So at the end of The Dark Knight, Batman took the blame for Harvey Dents fall, now becoming enemy number 1 of the police. The Dark Knight Rises takes place 8 years after the Dark Knight, and as it turns out, Bruce Wayne gave up Batman and is now retired. Meanwhile, Gotham City is currently celebrating a time of peace. The Joker was captured at the end of The Dark Knight (and although his fate is uncertain in this film, all you need to know is that he's gone) and the police have cleaned up the rest of Gotham. Although peace has been achieved in Gotham, our heros have pretty much been eaten alive by this lie. Bruce Wayne hung up the Batman symbol, but never moved on. He is a recluse in Wayne Manor, not knowing what to really do with is life. As for Jim Gordan, lets just say he has been messed up the most mentally after Dark Knight. His wife has left him, and he has been speeking this lie for 8 years, PRAISING Dent going ""oh, Harvey Dent, truth, justice, and the american way!"" while thinking ""yeah, Harvey Dent, the jerk that tried to kill my own son!"". So in a way, Jim Gordan is on his own, having nothing but this lie he has to live with.

Things change, however, when our terrorist Bane steps in Gotham. He has one purpose: take control of Gotham. He starts a series of attacks in Gotham, forcing Bruce Wayne to pick up the mantle of Batman again to reclaim his city. Of course, there is much more to Banes plan, as he wants to break Batman both mentally and physically. Why? Because Bane is associated with a previous villain in this series, and seeks revenge. This all leeds to a number of sub plots and character arcs (along with the introduction of several new characters) all leading up to an ending where everything is tied together.

The POSITIVES:
-The writing is great (not as great as Begins and The Dark Knight, but still great).

-The action and effects are sensational! 90 percent of the action of this film is done with practical effects and death defying stunt work. There isn't really an iconic ""money shot"" scene like the truck flip in the Dark Knight, but the action is still really good. Also, the fist fights between Batman and Bane aren't as good as they should be, but are still alright, and improved over Begins and Dark knight. But, the dialogue between Batman and Bane makes up for it.

-The acting is incredible. The characters are written and portrayed well, and are all great. There are probably too many characters to take in one film, but, they are all still done well, and you don't want any of them to have been cut out of the film.

-There are some great moralls too. Plenty of emotion, and some good character analysis.

-The ending: there are no words to describe but EPIC. It's written great, filmed great, and acted great. Somehow, Chris Nolan wraped everything up PERFECTLY, and I am shocked he was able to do so. Trust me, he MEANT IT when he said this would be the final Batman film of this series.

SURPRISES:
-One of the main charcters in this film was Anne Hathaway as Catwoman. Her role isn't EXTREMELY pivotal to the plot, but important to Bruce Waynes story, and she has plenty of screen time. I didn't think Hathaway would be a good Catwoman, at all, but I was wrong! She was cast PERFECTLY, and gave a great performance. Tom Hardy I already new would be a great Bane (and he was).

-In The Dark Knight Rises, ALOT of new characters are introduced, but thankfully, almost every character gets enough screentime, and they all give great performances.

-Another newcomer particularly is Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who gives a great performance as Officer John Blake. Although an original character by Nolan, he has several chatracteristics of a few charcters from the comics. He was acted and written so well, that I WANT to see this John Blake character in the comics.

-And lets not forget the plot twists. There are moments of BRILLIANCE in this film. Obiously I won't spoil the plot twists for anyone though. Sure, I saw 1 or 2 of them coming, but there were a few I DID NOT expect.

The NEGATIVES:
-one nitpick I have is how Batman immediatly retired after Dents cover up. Instead, I would have stated Bruce continued  to be Batman for 2 or 3 years (as a fugitive being hunted by the police) and slowly faded away, and by the point of this film, he has only been retired for a couple years. This is only a nitpick, since the starting off point of the film would stay the same, and this change wouldn't have made much difference to the plot. And it would still take place 8 years later, the only difference being he has just been retired for a couple years, instead of all 8.

-Banes voice is an issue for alot of people. Trust me, you can understand him... 97 percent of them time. There are a few lines of dialogue that you can't quite understand, but overall, the voice was fine. BUT, in the opening, Banes voice was TERRIBLE! Yeah, I could understand him, but you couldn't help but laugh whenever he talked. After the opening act, however, they got the tone right, and Bane started to sound cool later, just bad in the opening.

-editing was alright, but felt kind of ""choppy"" at times.

-The pacing was good for the length, but still not that great.

-alot of people think the film was too long. I disagree, I thought it was to SHORT!

-The movie is 2 and a half hours long, but, this movie is the definition of a 3 hour movie. If it was just 15 minutes longer, almost all of my problems would be fixed.. The pacing would have been better, and the film just would have ""flowed"" better, instead of feeling clutered with information. And considering that some of our most successful films (Titanic, Lord of the Rings, and a few others) are well OVER 3 hours, I doubt extra length would have been a negative effect on this film in any way.

-Despite the large amount of characters cramed into 2 and a half hours, most of the characters get enough screen time, except for one. Marion Cotillard as Wayne interprise member Miranda Tate. She gets a good amount of screentime, but still needed more. If the film was 10 to 15 minutes longer, 5 extra minutes JUST with her would have given her character more time. She was the one character that just didn't get enough development.

-I have a few other nitpicks, but only a few are worth mentioning. There is a scene with a bank robbery in broad daylight, but 8 minutes later, it's pitch black! And when it comes to the plot midway through, it may seem a little illogical, but no more than Batman Begins or Dark Knight, so you can't question what is realistic and what isn't WITHOUT questioning the others. You can't ask one question without asking another.

Overall, The Dark Knight Rises is, whether you like it or not, a good film, and an incredible ending to Chris Nolans trilogy. And alot of people complain about the ending, saying ""MY Batman wouldn't do this!"" well, it's not anyone elses Batman in this series, it's Chris Nolans Batman. We all have out own interpretation of the Batman character, and Chris Nolan gives us his. And personally, I don't think Chris Nolan could have ended his take any better. So, if you ignore the comics, forget your personal opinion on the Batman mythology, and view The Dark Knight Rises as a STAND ALONE MOVIE, you should be fine. The main reason why the ending works is BECAUSE it's forshadowed in the previous 2 films (if you payed attention, of course). ""if you make yourself more than just a man, if you devote yourself to an ideal, you will become something else entirely. A legend."" As a man he can be destroyed, but as a symbol, he can live forever. THAT is a comman theme illustrated in this entire trilogy. If you can accept that, then you should know that The Dark Knight Rises has a very fitting end.

If you liked Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, there is no good reason to NOT like this one. If you liked Begins (but didn't care for The Dark Knight) this should be a pleasant surprise, as this movie ties in ALOT to Begins, and I would even reccomend everyone to rewatch Begins before viewing Rises. But, if you DIDN'T care for Begins or Dark Knight, this film probably won't win you over, but everyone should still check this out. For me, this film gave me everything: Suspense, action, genius writing, great performances, 2 great cameos, plot twists, and an incredible ending, Nolan book ends everything as a trilogy should.

Another word of warning: If you are looking for a nonstop ""Batman"" film, well, this may not be for you. This movie features less screentime for Bruce Wayne in the Batsuit than any other Batman movie. But that's the point. We got plenty of Batman in The Dark Knight, so now, we have Bruce Waynes story being completed.

If you don't like Chris Nolans take on Batman, that's fine, but don't HATE on these movies just because they aren't for you. Sure, it is pretty illogical at times, but just as much as every other movie in existance. And if someone is going to tear this film apart over nitpicks or small plotholes, trust me, if I tried I could EASILY do that to any other movie. Just acknowledge that these ARE good films, instead of complaining about what you DON'T like. It's not that I ignore the problems in this movie, it's because there is MUCH more good than bad, so I can still give it 5 stars.

Also, some people were dissapointed with The Dark Knight Rises because the expectations were SO overwhelmingly high. PLEASE, do NOT let your expectations get the best of you! Think logically (like me) before viewing this movie. Sure, this film isn't 10 times better than Dark Knight as that was to Begins, but, it's still great! I still love all 3 chapters of this trilogy (something alot of trilogys fail at).

So, if you enjoyed Batman Begins and Dark Knight (and payed attention to the themes illustrated in them) you should enjoy this. Is this the PERFECT everything a fanboy could want Batman film? Well, no. But heck it'll do! It's still a great Batman movie, and succeeds in doing what was most important: giving the trilogy a fitting ending. Sure, the movie isn't perfect, but quite frankly, a perfect film just doesn't exist.

And if there is anything else that anyone is confused or scratching their head about, please comment. After seeing this film 3 times, I have been able to explain nearly every plothole or problem I had when I watched it the first time. If you were confused in any way, feel free to ask questions :)

Everyone should check this out, as it is a truly incredible ending to this amazing trilogy.

Now that I've had the opportunity to watch the DVD with sub-titles, I've upped my rating considerably.  I missed so many subtleties of the film in the theater.  Major themes and plot developments were incomprehensible to me due to several characters' slurred speech and the rapid editing of some parts of the film.  Now, I see The Dark Knight Rises is a complex work that requires multiple viewings to be fully appreciated.  I still find the depictions of physical pain endured by several characters excessive, and it's not the perfect work that The Dark Knight is.

I found it completely worth the extra price as it provided multiple ways of watching the movie I bought, and I could download movies to my IPad.  I travel frequently for work, and watching movies on my IPad while on flights and overseas in third world countries has saved my sanity.  With the move towards UltraViolet, I will no longer be buying any movies that don't include a real digital download.  UltraViolet won't allow me to watch movies while on my flights or overseas.  It is completely worthless.  The idea of UltraViolet was to cut down on piracy, but I think it's steering  more people to it.  Film studios need to quit punishing individuals like me who are actually willing to provide money for good packages.

By far, Christian Bale is the best ever, there is no comparison with the other actors who have played B.Man before.  This third (and hopefully not final) installment was excellent.  Every actor in the movie gives an outstanding performance, Michael Caine as Alfred really breaks my heart, love him!  Anne Hathaway is really great, and Tom Hardy after just seeing him in ""Warrior"" is quickly becoming one of my new favorites.  But it is Christian Bale who ""rises"" the Batman movies to a whole other level, he is spot on, all the time.  To be honest, with all that happened with the tragedy at the D. Knight Rises movie in Aurora Colorado, I was hesitant to venture out to the movie theater to see it.  I am now SO glad I did.  It did not disappoint.  And although I heard it was really lengthy, the time flew by; it flows smoothly and without any dull moments whatsoever.

4428092,5,B004LWZWGK,"I've enjoyed this movie more than I did The Dark Knight and that's pretty hard to accomplish, but The Dark Knight Rises pulled it off brilliantly. Christopher Nolan is a brilliant director and I love the cast, they were all great too. There was a lot of surprises that took place. I won't go into detail, for those of you who haven't seen it, but trust me it is worth it.

I enjoyed this movie more than I did the other superhero movies this summer. The Dark Knight Rises was a masterpiece and Oscar worthy, compared to the superhero movies that were released this year, I am very impressed with The Dark Knight Rises.

Anyways the fact that this has Blu-Ray, DVD and UltraViolet was enough to make me wanna own this version of The Dark Knight Rises. Don't listen to the reviewers that are complaining about UltraViolet, it's not as bad as they make it out to be. They're most likely iTune users, which I'm sure they can download their copy via iTunes, hence why it's not included in this package. That's the way they get their music, right? I myself prefer physical copies over digital, which is why all my CD's and DVD's are official store bought copies, but I love that the digital copy is included.

4428094,1,B004LWZWGK,"I have seen most of Christopher Nolan's films and liked them and I have been a Batman fan since the Early 80's. I understand many people liked this film, please do not jump all over me, this is just my opinion. I was so excited for this movie in the theater at midnight as it was about to start and by the end of the film I was only frustrated and angry. After having led up to this film so well, I feel Christopher Nolan had just lost interest in the Batman character and was obligated to make this film. So much of it was like Nolan was trying to entertain himself while compromising the Batman character all along. Here's my issues:

1.) Too much focus on Bane who was uninteresting and not enough Batman screen time.

2.) No Background on Catwoman. Just appears, and then retreats with Batman at the end. Why should we care about this character?

3.) The Character of Batman would never A.) Give up Crime fighting for 8 years (even if he had to stop petty crimes. It is who he is!) or B.) Retire from being Batman. Not in the characters nature.

4.) I hate the whole time you think you are learning about Bane, then it turns out you don't know much about him, but you do know the entire story of Talia who is in the film for a whole 10 minutes.

5.) No payback. Batman never really overcomes his villains. They whup the hell out of him and he still gets pummeled at the end landing one or two lucky shots. Batman should have done better against Bane in the first fight, even though he hadn't been crime fighting for a while, his instincts, past training should have helped him out more. Bane was practically invincible. Nolan's method was all Shock value for the first fight and that equals lazy filmmaking. It was disrespectful to the Batman character. Made him look like a loser.

6.) Batman had absolutely no detective skills in the whole series. This series did a poor job of showing Bruce's intelligence. All brawn and no brains. Untrue to the character of Batman. He is a scientist/genius/detective before a fighter.

7.) Ridiculous death for Bane. So anti-climatic. Disrespectful to the character.

8.) Bruce received no training in the prison that would make him come back and beat Bane. Also, back injuries do not heal that fast.

9.) Bane tells Bruce to experience ""The Hell"" he grew up in. The prison was actually pretty nice, with a few helpful and friendly inmates.

10.) Cheesy Cliche ending. I did not think Nolan was capable of such a predictable ending.

11.) John Blake Character was great until the cheesy Robin comment. Why even Bother? Then Robin is going to be Batman? Confusing.

I could go on, but ultimately I just felt Nolan took too many liberties with the characters. Even If I tried to view this as a Nolan film first, it was just a poorly written messy story will no sense of flow or direction. The first Christopher Nolan film I haven't liked...it's too bad it had to be a Batman film too.

UPDATE: Judging by some of the comments I think some people have the impression that I didn't understand the film...let me clarify. I think, many people like myself understand what Nolan was trying to do, they just don't like it. It's not that I didn't understand the movie...it's that I understood it and was unhappy with it's direction. I don't want a ""Nolan Universe"" Batman. I want Batman...a representation of the character I have grown up with. Batman has always changed and evolved, and I like that about the character, but I DO NOT like when some pompous director comes along and changes the core elements of one of my favorite characters.

ALSO for the many comments claiming I should read ""The Dark Knight Returns"" by Frank Miller...Not only have I read it but I have a collector's edition hardcover version of it. There is no comparison here. Frank Miller wrote a great story which is also a stand alone book not to be considered cannon in Batman's history. It is an alternate take on Batman. Read the comments from Miller himself who has done this often with comic characters. Miller can take liberties because he wrote a great story. Nolan did not, so his liberties have become flaws and a lazy script because he could not close up that trilogy in a proper way without Heath Ledger's Joker.",1349222400,58,4229,4.532808398950131

As far as Superhero movies go Dark Knight is still #1 but this Dark Knight Rises is only slightly behind...Avengers was great..but when you compare the two..everything in Avengers looked childish compare to the Rises..and Avengers in my mind a distant third.  What Nolan did with Batman is just remarkable..its amazing how dead Batman was in the late 90's and how Batman rose because of these three movies...I thought LOTR were the best trilogy of all time..but this trilogy is the best..the acting in all of three was top notch..even though Heath Ledger outperformed Christian Bale (and everybody)..Bale shows just how great of an actor he is in this one..JGL & Anne Hathaway were surprisingly good in their roles..so was Tom Hardy as Bane...at times I felt this movie is not about Batman but battered Bruce Wayne..which was a good thing. Michael Caine, Gary Oldman & Morgan Freeman were great as usual...all and all..just an Amazing movie.. as you can expect from Nolan & co. and great ending to Bruce Wayne saga..",1349136000,,1231,4.752336448598131
4428103,4,B004LWZWGK,"And Bane is no Joker.  I liked this movie and want to watch several more times...but it is no where near what Dark Knight was.  Dark Knight is one of my favorite movies of all time, I can watch it over and over, and it is a masterpiece - perfect pacing - all of the story lines mesh beautifully.  Dark Knight is a piece of art - all the performances are top notch - the Ledger performance is one of the best of all time - not exaggerating.

Dark Knight Rises?  Good movie, some cool scenes and some signature moments - but long, and dragging in places, and sometimes even nonsensical in my opinion.  Kind of choppy too - it doesn't have the beautiful ""flow"" of Dark Knight - Dark Knight is simply one of the rare perfect movies...Rises is FAR from that.  Bane just has no charisma.  He is very ""blah"" as a character, whereas Joker is one of the greatest characters in the history of movies as portrayed by the great Heath Ledger.

It was supposed to continue directly from The Dark Knight and end with a grand showdown between Batman and The Joker but sadly this did not happen. Having said that, this movie is spectacular. For many reasons. However, I am going to cite some negatives for a moment, as I feel not enough people have acknowledged these issues. This movie is seriously loaded with plot holes and insane leaps in logic, some I still can't quite get over. I won't get into specifics just in case there a few hermits out there who never made it to the theater to see this (seriously, what's wrong with you?) and also because they're very obvious once you see the film but needless to say, there are many a ridiculous moment in this movie. That's not to say you can't overlook them and still enjoy it. I did. Millions of others did too. I absolutely love this movie. One of my all time favorites. The good significantly outweighs the bad. I can't help but wonder/wish though, what it would have been like if Heath Ledger hadn't died. Think of how THAT movie would have been. *Sigh* Oh well. No sense in dwelling on things like that. We should all be thankful Nolan and the gang even made this movie at all. He was understandably reticent at first. So thank you Mr. Nolan, and the rest of the brilliant cast and crew for giving the world  this movie. Bravo.",1349136000,3,1391,4.43359375
4428105,5,B004LWZWGK,"I loved this movie. This was a great way to end the great Dark Knight Trilogy. I have to give it up to Christopher Nolan because he single handedly (figuratively speaking of course) proved to all cinema fanatics and critics that creating a great superhero trilogy is possible, if handled with care. What I loved about The Dark Knight Rises is that it tied in all 3 movies together pretty damn well. Some sequels to movies tend to abandon the storylines of the previous film to some extent, but Nolan was able to mesh Batman Begins and The Dark Knight into this new film well enough that it never seemed too forced or irrelevant. The actors for this particular film were chosen perfectly in my opinion; Anne Hathway played an incredibly sexy Catwoman and arguably the best Catwoman ever captured on film, Tom Hardy as Bane was an excellent choice for his strong body and great acting as well, although the voice acting/voice dub has been harshly criticized for it's sound clarity. Joseph Gordan Levitt's character was a personal favorite of mines and his character winded up being significant to story which was a relief.

I'm not going to spoil anything about the film, but in it's long running time of 160 minutes, I was surprised to find myself wanting more. To be honest I wouldn't mind if the film was 3 hours long or maybe even a bit longer than that; in fact it should've been because some segments of the movie felt a bit rushed especially the dialogue. However the plot, actors, action and cinematagraphy is some of the best I've seen in 2012 thus far. The only sad part about this movie is that this is indeed the last Dark Knight movie Nolan will be creating, bringing the great trilogy to a sealed close. But all good things must end and this a wonderful way to go out. Fans will always wonder how it could've ended if the late Heath Ledger (The Joker) was still alive, but under the circumstances I don't think Christopher Nolan could've done any better. Buy this movie, and buy the entire trilogy if you haven't seen it, it's worth every penny and every minute of your time. I feel sorry for the the director that decides to reboot the next Batman films, because they have a whole lot to live up to.",1349136000,2,2212,4.53

4428107,5,B004LWZWGK,"""The Dark Knight Rises"" not only ends the trilogy made by Christopher Nolan nicely, but it does so with plenty of action, spectacle, and a very memorable conclusion!  While I do not believe it to be a better film than the 2nd film in the trilogy, ""The Dark Knight"", I do believe it to be better than the amazing ""Batman Begins"".  This film is very dark, violent, well acted, and very intense; it will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the whole film.  The movie opens with an amazing introduction to the film's main villain, Bane, and continues from there where the last movie left off.
Batman is now a fugitive, believed to be a murderer, and has now been in hiding for 8 years.  Eventually, Bruce once again dons the cape and cowl to become the dark knight, and from then on, the action and suspense does NOT let up in the slightest! The acting by the A-list cast of actors is very well done! Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, and Michael Cane once again do amazing in their roles.  New notable actors to the cast are: Tom Hardy, Ann Hathaway, and Joseph Gordon Levit; all of which do an amazing job in their roles!
Even though this film is amazing and engaging, it is not perfect.  There are some plot holes and some very noticeable editing flaws (most likely due to the PG-13 rating).  There is even a scene where a hallucinating Bruce Wayne sees an image (or ghost?) of someone from his past; this scene was poorly done and fairly confusing.
Obviously the film is not released yet, not until December 4th, but I will be buying the blu-ray combo pack the day it is released! Everyone that is a Batman fan, superhero fan, comic book fan, or just an action movie fan should not hesitate in buying this phenomenal movie as soon as it is available.

4428108,5,B004LWZWGK,"If you haven't heard anything about "" The Dark Knight Rises,"" you've probably been living in a cave for the past few months. This amazing superhero thriller has been making box office records since its opening weekend. Although a tragic shooting was involved with this movie, it's a movie that's worth seeing.

 The movie itself is very well done. Intriguing the viewer, the script does not bore you, and it's complemented by flawless acting. The special effects are done perfectly, with explosions that never bore the audience and plenty of good fights. Gotham, the fictional city in which the story takes place, has so much detail that you often forgot it doesn't exist.

 This movie has very interesting characters: Bruce Wayne/Batman, Bane(the villain), Robin John Blake(Batman's sidekick), and Selina Kyle/Catwoman. Wayne, a billionaire socialite looking to protect Gotham, is an appealing character who never really says much, but is easy to understand. The villain of the story, Bane, has a brutal style of fighting that's only purpose is to cause the victim excruciating pain. He communicates with people in such a manner that makes it impossible to read his emotion, making him an even better antagonist. Batman's sidekick, Robin, wants nothing more than to protect Gotham and its orphaned boys, making him an excellent character that you grow to respect. And lastly, there's Selina Kyle, a cat burglar who steals jewels, who offers a character that isn't violent like the others and prefers to run away from dangerous situations, much like a cat would do. Throughout the film, she works her way into Wayne's trust and eventually wins his heart.

 Overall, ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" a wonderful film with a good combination of action, romance, and suspense, will definitely keep you entertained. So be sure to stop by a movie theatre and check it out. You won't be disappointed!",1349049600,3,1886,5.087378640776699

4428111,5,B004LWZWGK,"Any Batman fan knows what the state the of the franchise was (movie wise) after Batman and Robin. Nolan's trilogy of Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and Dark Knight rises not only brought it back from the dead, it outdid Tim Burton's movies (both of which were very good). What Nolan did best was never treated the story as strictly a superhero or action movie, and as such did not take many of the easy shortcuts (see the Transformers movies) that many of those movies can take.

While I do not think that any character in this movie came close to being as good as what Heath Ledger did with the Joker in Dark Knight, I do think all the actors played their characters well, and they were all well written. I did not have as big an issue with Bane's voice as some. Granted I found I could understand him better seeing it the second time than the first. I also think they did a great job of tying in the other movies (especially Batman Begins) to this one whether through flashbacks or bringing back some of the other characters. I also thought Anne Hathaway did a very good job as Catwoman. She definitely played the ""out for herself"" role well, and balanced the kind of good, kind of bad that the character called for.

My only issue with the movie is that there were a couple editing spots where Batman would have literally had to have been two places at once. When he saves Gordon after the ""trial"" and then saves Blake moments later is the big one. Nor is it ever explained how Bruce gets back to Gotham City after he escapes from the prison, which given what happens earlier in the film should have been no easy feat.

That said, I think they did a good job tying up Christian Bale's part of the story. The ending certainly left the possibility of future movies open, and I am sure the studio wants to do more of them. Hopefully if and when that decision is made whomever is put in charge will follow Nolan's approach and focus on quality acting and writing, and blend elements of realism into it when possible. That is what makes the movie (and the entire trilogy) work.",1348963200,,2075,4.384415584415584

4428113,5,B004LWZWGK,"The final film in Christopher Nolan's Batman vision, THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, is a worthy conclusion.

Perhaps more than the Batman mythology I was fascinated by how current-day real-life themes made their way into this movie. The most prescient was that of the 99% vs. the 1%, Wall Street vs. Main Street, rich vs. the poor, embodied by Selina Kyle vs. Bruce Wayne/Batman and Bane's attack on the stock exchange.

Anne Hathaway again stole the show, this time with her portrayal of Catwoman (though that name is never used in the film), and Nolan decided to go back to her roots as a ""cat-burglar"" for his rendition of the character.

Bane, totally mangled in BATMAN AND ROBIN, this time is believable, terrifying, and the perfect villain. The sequence that leads to and includes his and Batman's first fight was thrilling; easily the best fight in all three films.

Another real-life theme is that of the search for a clean, realistic, renewable energy source in order to sustain life with the obvious paradox being that such an energy source can also lead to great destruction. On this end, the finale to the film requires a suspension of disbelief (maybe beyond all belief) and may have been drawn out about a half hour-plus too long.

As is invevitable in such an epic as Batman (especially with Nolan's final two installments earnings over $1 billion in box office receipts worldwide) we movie fans are going to rate it among the all-time great trilogies. As I think about some the classic conclusions--RETURN OF THE JEDI, RETURN OF THE KING, THE GODFATHER: PART III, ALIEN III, THE LAST CRUSADE, BACK TO THE FUTURE: PART III and MATRIX: REVOLUTIONS, among others--I put it well ahead of Revolutions, Back to the Future III, and Alien III, but not quite as satisfying as Jedi, Godfather, Crusade, or LOTR.

Which begs the question as to why I'd give it 5-stars if it didn't quite meet the all-time great conclusions. And I suppose the answer is that I thought the character arc ended as I would have desired for Bruce Wayne/Batman (with the hint of a successor); the villains (Bane and Catwoman) were potrayed uniquely and interwoven with real-life themes in a very believable and disturbing way; the special-effects were top notch; and Hans Zimmer did his usual outstanding work as composer.

The bottom line is that if you are prepared for a movie that goes on a touch too long (by about thirty minutes or so) but includes top-notch special effects, music, acting, and storyline within the Batman mythology, this is a must-own movie in your library.",1348444800,4,2555,4.819634703196347

I never got the chance to see ""The Dark Knight"" in theaters but completely blew me away when I got it on DVD {Since then have upgraded to Blu-Ray for both 1 & 2}. I was not excited for the ending movie... ""The Dark Knight Rises"". Especially after the movie theater shooting in Colorado. I thought to myself ""Is it even worth it to go see this movie?""

My husband was begging and counting down the days until it came out. Of course we saw it Friday afternoon of Opening Day. I was literally blown away... yet again. HOW can you hit 1,2&3 movies completely out of the park & out of this world? Well if you are Christopher Nolan, I guess it's just another day at the office.

I am completely obsessed with these movies. I love how Nolan took the concept of Batman and made him modern. Made the whole thing dark and tangible to our generation, unlike the 60's versions. He made the characters possible and real. You feel as if bad guys do exist and Batman will find a way to make things right.

Oh and I might add, I really did not like Bane. I much prefer The Joker {and Harley Quinn, obviously not in the movies, I was hoping she'd show up in the 3rd giving a reason as to where The Joker is} as villains. I never liked Scarecrow either. And I also thought 'Cat Woman' would be AWFUL in this movie especially due to the fact Anne Hathaway is very different than the 'darkness' of Nolan's Batman movies. I thought she'd totally make the movie Bomb. But... It didn't happen. She came into her character very well. Even with me going into the movie wishing they had cast someone else. She portrayed the character very very well. After the first 5 minutes of her in the movie, you are convinced of her character.

I loved the fight scenes in this movie... you can tell they really went all out. And you can also tell throughout the whole movie that it's the ending. Which I really liked... the fact that the end didn't pop up 20 minutes before the credits. The whole movie is a progressive movement to the end of Batman.

And the subtle hint of ""Robin"" at the end of the movie {That my husband didn't even catch, by the way}... I almost died of Happiness. I LOVE that they didn't make Batman have a sidekick... but I still love Batman and Robin. The fact Nolan detached them for the sake of the ""legacy living on"". Superb. 5 Stars.

I can't say enough about these movies. I only can wish Heath Ledger would have lived to make it into the final film.",1347408000,2,2502,4.27906976744186
4428117,4,B004LWZWGK,"***This review contains spoilers***

  The title of this review paraphrases the question an exasperated Captain America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) levels against Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) in ""The Avengers"".  Without hesitation, Stark coolly answers that he is an industrialist, billionaire, playboy, inventor, etc.  Of course, you could ask the same question of Batman/Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) throughout the Dark Knight trilogy, especially the second sequel ""The Dark Knight Rises"" (hereafter ""DK Rises') and essentially get the same answer, albeit without Stark's smug insouciance.  But is that all there is to Batman/Wayne - just the Gotham legend?  What about the man himself?  Who is he?  To my amazement, among all the Bondian plotting, intricate intrigue, nihilistic villainy, and apocalyptic despair, ""DK Rises"" manages to take a deeper peek into Wayne's soul than any other Batman medium and painfully extract more of his true, human essence.

  Unquestionably, the Batman character is a remarkable legend and symbol - resourceful, agile, nimble-witted, incisive, daring, and persistent.  But, in my opinion, for many of us, the non-superpowered Batman ironically suffered from Superman's impediment - he was too good.  Independently wealthy, and seemingly free from mere mortals' mundane concerns, Batman had the time to employ an almost endless panoply of weapons, gimmicks, and devices to indulge his ""favorite pastime"" - foil all his hapless enemies, even the most grotesque ones.  Batman was so charismatic that he inspired even his most implacable foes to ""play by the rules"" and defeat Batman fair and square.  True, he suffered the trauma of seeing his parents killed by hoodlums, but for a long time that was treated as just the catalyst for his transformation to Batman.  Except for that, Batman/Wayne led a charmed, cocooned, almost-bland life.  Wow, what a near-perfect presence Batman is, and how ""perfectly"" boring!

  Subtly, ""DK Rises"" evokes the inspirational aura of Batman by keeping him (for at least the first 40% of the movie) as a morale-boosting, if hidden, ideal for the citizens of Gotham, even if he was (wrongfully) implicated in District Attorney Harvey Dent's death.  But gradually, we see the frail, almost decrepit shut-in within the Wayne Manor fortress, doted upon by faithful, paternal manservant Alfred (Michael Caine).  Quite logically and understandably, Alfred has so far persuaded the aged Wayne to give up the Bat-madness and lead a more conventional, comfortable life.  But Bane (Tom Hardy), a cross between Hannibal Lecter, Marvel Comics' Juggernaut, and a WWF refugee, arrives in Gotham to insidiously lull and encourage the proletariat masses to oust their 1% bourgeois oppressors, then traitorously blow them up with a nuclear device almost no one can disarm. Before that, he must humiliate and crush Batman, first the spirit then the body.

  In a perverse way, in ""DK Rises"" it was gratifying to see Batman/Wayne at the nadir of his fortunes and clawing his way back. Incrementally throughout ""DK Rises"" he loses just about everything - his precarious health, an initial, punishing tussle with Bane, his vast financial resources, his palatial home, and even his freedom as the battered ex-tycoon is flung into a cruel abyss with other wretches in a nameless wasteland.  As we find out, it was the same abyss the orphaned doppleganger Bane inhabited until he finally crawled out.  The abyss is cruel not only because of its depth, but also because it offers a tantalizing, Sisyphean route to freedom.  If you can scale the walls and make a dangerous leap to a ledge near the top, you are free.  If not, back you go, alive because ropes support you but demoralized.  Wayne has no Batsuit, no nothing.  Does HE HIMSELF, the man, have what it takes to escape and return to Gotham to save it. (SPOILER: After many agonizing trials and ""Rocky""-style regimens, Wayne does escape that hell and return.)

  Besides the personal physical strength, it was also gratifying to see Wayne's humanity come to the fore.  We learn that he fights crime not simply out of an emotional vendetta or to fill the empty time.  The orphaned Wayne has always cared for the downtrodden - especially other orphans.  He sees to it that the orphanage he has self-pityingly neglected for so long gets renewed funding.  Personally, he listens to and aids fellow orphans -the upstanding, principled detective John Blake (Joseph Gordon Levitt) and morally ambiguous catburglar Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway)- in their individual crusades to be better, caring people and help turn the tide against Bane.  He does so with his words and by the example he sets.  In a second slugfest, the rejuvenated Batman floors Bane, but (SECOND MAJOR SPOILER) finds he is not the primary mastermind. The true instigator of the Gotham siege reveals that the nuclear device cannot truly be disarmed.  Gotham is doomed.  Batman hooks the device to his revamped Bat flier and soars out to Gotham harbor where the device detonates harmlessly, except for Batman/Wayne (maybe).  The device had a 6-mile radius of destruction.  Batman/Wayne could not have ejected beyond that in time.  Could he?  Batman/Wayne was certainly self-sacrificing, but is he a martyr?

  Whatever the outcome, within the senses-pounding, absorbing action, drama, and suspense of this ambitious near-epic, I think ""DK Rises"" proves that Bruce Wayne a complex, admirable, inimitable guy who doesn't need a suit to be a hero.

(P.S.:  Again, perversely and paradoxically, I hope Batman/Wayne did not survive the explosion.  If he does, I think it will diminish the magnitude of his compassionate martyrdom and reinforce the old ""perfect"" Batman cliche.  I hope the corruption-weary Mr. Blake, a worthy successor, legitimately assumes the Bat-mantle and continues Bruce Wayne's legacy - as Batman, not as Robin, please (though I like Robin))

(P.P.S.: I was somewhat disappointed that the menacing, mellifluous, and articulate Bane was somewhat reduced to ""second banana"" status in that ""real mastermind"" twist - just another muscular mercenary.  Can't a villain be super-smart, super-strong, AND a leader?)

(P.P.P.S.: See this movie in IMAX if you can.  It will literally rock you!)",1346976000,3,6271,5.250503018108652

I saw this movie 3 times in the movie theatres and it's the only movie I have ever saw at the theatres more than once!

4428119,2,B004LWZWGK,"The story was falling apart bit by bit as it went on to the point of seeing how ridiculous and unbelievable it could get was more entertaining than the movie itself. And how can you call this a Batman movie when he is only in the movie for 20 minutes at most? It's a 2-hour 40-minute movie which could have easily been cut shorter. And they ruined the Bane character with the final reveal of the mastermind, also the way he was killed just made him look like a joke. The fight scenes are some of the worst choreography I've ever seen in a major blockbuster. Don't get me wrong, it has some great scenes like the first face-off between Bane and Batman, how Brcue Wayne eventually climbs out of the pit. The score was loud and really gave the movie an epic feel. Anne Hathaway's Selena was the standout character, very cool and sexy. But all these cannot even make up a decent movie.",1346544000,7,881,4.345454545454546
4428120,3,B004LWZWGK,"Half a loaf rising.

The first two installments of the Dark Knight series - ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight"" - provided plenty of cerebral fodder to chew on when not regaling us with vertiginous fist fights, wild villains and novel weapons. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" has ditched the brain food for an occasionally dreary pate of mass boxing, an obnoxiously booming soundtrack and smaller-than life heroes. Not that this is a bad movie. It is plenty entertaining. But it fails to complete the brains-and-brawn arc drawn by the first two installments.

Telling the entire story would spoil the plot twists in this film. Suffice it to say that after his long-ago encounter with the Joker, Bruce Wayne has hung up his cape and cowl and retreated into self-pity and isolation. The Wayne empire, source of his wealth and philanthropy, has been ignored and is on the verge of collapse. Wayne needs a major kick in the cape to propel him out of the doldrums and back into the fray. The kick comes in the form of a nasty bad guy - Bain - a brawny psychopath who wears a Darth-Vader-ish mouthpiece. Bain and his henchmen have focused their attention on Gotham City, and plan the beginning of some global-sized hijinks.

What the film lacks in depth, it gains in length. At two and three-quarters hours long, no viewer can say they didn't get their money's worth. The film's pace, just a hair above languid, gives the director plenty of time to spin out his series-ending plot. It's hardly a spoiler to tell that the League of Shadows, the bud guys from Batman Begins, have not taken their sights off Gotham City. Like avenging angels with a fixation on sin, the League still wants to destroy Gotham for its crimes. The convoluted plot involves boardroom attempts to save the Wayne empire, stories from a mysterious Middle Eastern prison, a distraught Alfred, a talented cat burglar and Bruce Wayne's battered and aging frame.

My criticism is that the film only hinted at themes that could have made it a killer film. The bad guys are given a ridiculously long time to harry Gotham, giving their enemies plenty of time to regroup. Good thing, because Bruce Wayne is aging, depressed and out of shape. A doctor confirms that his knees have no remaining cartilage. But a few pushups, pull-ups (and in one case, a punch in the spine) later, and all is well, infirmities forgotten. An inexplicable conflict with Alfred manages only to be mawkish and embarrassing. The fight scenes, especially one in which Batman and a few thousand cops engage in a ridiculous and dull street brawl with the bad guys, make Batman look small. And, people, we must never, never see Batman *walk* anywhere! The bat drops in unexpectedly or is silhouetted against the moon - not taking an evening stroll in that goofy getup.

Sure, there are plenty of explosions, peril, close calls and coolish gadgets in the film. But how cool are they when an extraneous character jumps on the Bat bike for the first time and rides it as well as  Batman? How neat is the Batmobile when a police chopper shadows it without difficulty? How bad is a boss when a mere fistfight can take him out. How deep can a movie be when it cheats the audience of a challenging ending? A weird, disappointing movie, full of plot holes where its brains should have been.",1346112000,8,3306,4.691379310344828

Catwoman was done well enough in batman returns. i mean an hathaway did a good job. but they didn't have the batman/catwoman flirtation like it is in the comics and tv show. and they nevfer fought once and she wasn't even called catwoman in the whole movie. so far that is two villians christopher nolan messed up with. two-face and catwoman. don't get me wrong his movies are good. but you do not put two major supervillians in one movie if you can't concentrate on them. Batman returns is a great example on having two major bad guys and concetrating on both. But i'm glad that they did the whole break batman down and have him rise feel in it. i;m not going to lie i loved this movie that was just some of my little quricks. i was happy with it and with the ending now maybe dc can do justice league since they had the ending the way they did. if you have not seen this movie i recommend you do",1345680000,6,1514,4.083892617449664

4428124,4,B004LWZWGK,"Director Christopher Nolan helped legitimize the comic book hero Batman, as grounded in the real world in Batman Begins and its landmark sequel, The Dark Knight.  Many trilogies fail to maintain the promise of the superior sequel (Spiderman II, The Godfather Part II, and Road Warrior), but in rare cases, there have been great third acts like Toy Story 3, Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, Star Wars: Return of the Jedi, and now The Dark Knight Rises.  Though it fails to surpass its predecessor, as an ambitious film with grand designs and elaborate themes, it mostly succeeds.

Several years after the events of The Dark Knight, the legacy of Harvey Dent lives on as crime has been stifled in Gotham City and the wealthy and elite hold sway.  Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) has become a hobbled recluse whose masked hero, Batman, has been hunted and banished under false pretenses.  Gotham is pristine and ready for a new age, and relics like Batman and even Commissioner Gordon are not needed anymore and obsolete.  A mysterious masked villain named Bane (Thomas Hardy) begins a calculated reign of terror which paralyzes the city.  But what is his motive and what does this have to do with Batman? As Gordon (Gary Oldman) pleads for the return of the caped crusader and the city cries out for salvation, Batman must overcome a very powerful Bane to save the city.  He is aided by his servant Alfred (Michael Caine), technical wizard Lucius (Morgan Freeman), and a young cop, John Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), and bedazzled by two mysterious women, Selina (Anne Hathaway) and Miranda (Marion Cottilard).  But first, Bruce Wayne must return from the abyss to confront his past and battle for Gotham City's future.

The briskly paced 2 hour 45 minute film is always engaging with memorable moments.  The opening sequence is a marvelous midair hijack right out of a Bond film. (Come to think of it, Nolan's got the Bond thing down as in the snowy climax of Inception.)  A scene where a doctor gives Wayne failing marks in his physical is amusing.  The climactic action between the forces of good and evil recalls the finale to Metropolis and the face off of its protagonist and antagonist are right out of Enter the Dragon.

Nolan likes intricate puzzles; witness Momento and Inception.  He takes previous storylines including the convoluted ending of The Dark Knight and serves some nice twists here.  The film is a cleverly built trap, and Batman's fall from grace is a rapid decent into the depths of hopelessness and despair. To be great again, he has to literally and figuratively climb his way back; in a sense, the fates of the masked avenger and Gotham City are linked.

The film is able to explore some interesting relationships both past and present, and duality of key characters is a recurring theme. For Wayne, Commissioner Gordon and Alfred are fatherly figures through his orphaned childhood and adult life.  Selina and Miranda are women with different backgrounds and agendas.  Blake, the idealistic, honest cop shares a common bond with Wayne.  Even Batman, the tortured, self sacrificing hero has a counterpart in Bane, the ultimate, super terrorist, who is intelligent, cunning, and ruthless.
With so many characters, it is remarkable how Nolan and screenwriter/brother Jonathan Nolan are able to weave together storylines featuring each role prominently.  In particular, the paradoxical Selina is a `cat burglar' and a survivor who has to learn how to trust another person.  Her interaction with Wayne always intrigues as they play out a kind of dance, and we wonder her true motives.  She is a kind of outsider and observer of the events that will determine the fate of Gotham City.

The film boldly tackles major themes adding layer upon layer.  It's about past sins and morality: the great deception over Harvey Dent for the greater good presents risks and has severe consequences here.  Amid complacency there is class warfare: as Bane incites the masses and bolsters his numbers, the city faces a dichotomy of the proletariat versus the bourgeoisie.  The film also tests the concept of trust and faith: sometimes the ones we trust betray us while others may surprise us with their loyalty.

There are minor missteps e.g. immaculate streets when the city's infrastructure is at a standstill.  A brief moment at a cafe at film's end reveals a bit too much of a truth when subtle reactions could have sufficed.  The film's tone is dark, angst filled with rare moments of humor. That's not a knock on the film but don't go expecting Avengers type of laughs.  There's also an amusing cameo in the role of President and a macabre return of a key villain.

Hans Zimmer's minimalist pulse keeps the mood humming along.  Visuals are technically outstanding with minimal use of computer generated effects, and this is where it deviates from the more colorful, super heroes of The Avengers and X Men.  Here we have a hero and backdrop that is set in a believable world which heightens realism and credibility.

Brimming with ideas as it challenges us in ways most action films movies don't, The Dark Knight Rises is a strong conclusion to the trilogy.  A deeply allegorical film that demands repeated viewings to truly appreciate its intricacies, it dares to bend and reinvent the mythology of the caped crusader, and although it doesn't quite trump The Dark Knight, which set the bar impossibly high, its vision at times carries its audience to wonderful, lofty heights.",1345507200,3,5490,4.910075839653304
4428125,3,B004LWZWGK,"Oh, boy. I really wanted to like this. As in I wanted to be gushing a REALLY positive review just because of it's release. It's a Christopher Nolan-directed Christian Bale-staring Batman film which brought back Catwoman/Selina Kyle. So nothing could go wrong?

Umm...

The Selina Kyle/Catwoman in this film is not as likeable as Michelle Pffeifer's role. She's a con-artist who's not that smart despite already having hung around the less desirable elements of society. Sheesh!

Selina believes that corrupt businessman John Daggett will help her expunge the record if she delivers stolen Wayne Enterprises merchandise. Unlike Wayne, Daggett represents capitalism-industrialism gone corrupt. He's only using money to benefit himself and does not care about improving the human condition. This is an especially interesting parallel to make against today's economy.

Selina comes around to realizing what to actually do, that prior consciousness raising just did not add any 'good' tension to the screenplay. Her earlier role is not as wholly likeable for audiences.

I liked the movie, but the screenplay would have been fantastic if it did re-establish just the right kind of characters and character relationships. Building up Selina's street smarts would have really convincingly sold her to theater audiences.

On the plus side, this movie had excellent special effects and costume design.  It's something which is a good watch. But I'm not going to put it on my must get DVD list.",1345507200,2,1484,5.316239316239316
4428126,3,B004LWZWGK,"In what should have been a fantastic finish to the greatest rendition of Batman, this movie sure left us feeling cheated and unsatisfied.

Right away, the 8 year gap seemed unnecessary.  Everyone still acted as if Harvey Dent's death had just happened.  Too much time had passed for anyone to still feel strongly about Batman being responsible for Harvey Dent's death.  8 years is way too long for Bruce Wayne to still be grieving for his lost love.  It also seemed as if Rachel Dawes' death had just happened.

On to the head scratchers......

Bruce's mother's pearls had a tracking system?  Really?  The necklace that was broken during the night of his mother's murder.  They were re-assembled, and survived the fire that destroyed Wayne Manor?

Every single policeman went underground for go after Bane?  This is NOT practical.  Then, they become trapped for months, during winter, and then emerge still looking healthy and clean, as if no time had passed.

Bane was able to hold the city hostage for 5 months without any outside intervention?  What was the point of waiting so long?  If his plan was to destroy the city, why not do it sooner?

Why would Bane go through all the trouble of sending Bruce Wayne to the desert prison that he was formerly in?  Why not just kill him?  What was the point of keeping your greatest threat alive?  And how did a broke Bruce Wayne get home from the prison so fast?  And how did he enter the city undetected?  This part of the film was nonsensical.

How did Bane know that Bruce Wayne was Batman?  During the months that Bane was in Control of Gotham, why didn't he seize Wayne Manor and destroy the Batcave?

How did Batman survive the stabbing from Miranda Tate/Talia al Ghul?  She sunk the knife fully into him and twisted the blade to leave the wound open.  He seemed quite immobilized and would surely have lost a significant amount of blood.  Somehow it didn't seem to bother him at all.

How did Batman survive the blast radius from the bomb when it clearly showed he was still in the cockpit with less than 5 seconds to go?  I doubt he could have safely ejected and escaped the 6-mile blast radius with such little time.  The fixed autopilot explanation doesn't make sense.

It was very convenient to have a wise old man that was also a doctor to help out Bruce Wayne while he was in the desert prison.

Apparently the ol' Rocky Balboa formula worked for Bruce Wayne.  A few pushups and pull-ups and he's all back to normal.  Ready for the big fight.

Gary Oldman, Michael Cane, and Morgan Freeman are very important to this franchise.  All 3 were extremely under-utilized.  Their characters were absent throughout most of the film.

What was the point of Catwoman?  Her character seemed mysterious, but didn't offer anything relevant to the story.  I don't believe anyone truly cared that she was in this movie, aside from the meat-heads that just want a pretty girl to look at.

The relationship between Bane and Talia al Ghul seemed like it could have had a greater backstory.  We barely understood how Bane came-to-be, and there was some great potential for those 2 characters to have a deeper relationship.

The greatest scene of the movie is the first fight scene between Bane and Batman.  No music, just the fight.  A slow and weak Batman facing a monster and rightfully getting brutally beaten was excellent.  Unfortunately, everything after this moment seemed to get worse and worse.

This movie just didn't have the same feel as the first 2 did.  The unbelievable storylines and unrealistic sequence of events made this movie bad.  The pace seemed rushed and slapped-together without anyone questioning why these plot elements are the way they are.  It is definitely the weakest of the 3 films.  Please ask yourself these same questions when watching the film, and hopefully you'll realize:  this doesn't make any sense.",1345420800,14,3881,4.723467862481315
4428127,4,B004LWZWGK,"I feel The Dark Knight Rises is the best of the three in overall entertainment. The hallmark of this series is its dark, gritty realism, at least as realistic as you can get for a superhero movie. I prefer this approach to the semi-goofy style of the 89-97 series.

Bane's a formidable villain and Anne Hatheway surprisingly plays a good ""Catwoman"" (I say ""surprisingly"" only because I thought she has too innocent/sweet of a quality to pull off the role). Also on hand is Marion Cotillard, who's stunning as Miranda Tate, and Joseph Gordon-Levite, who's effective as police officer Blake. Beyond these we get the principal characters/cast of the first two films, minus the Joker and Harvey Dent.

My only beef with this series is that the plots are convoluted and there's an overload of characters, which means you really have to pay attention or you'll get lost in the process. This is never a problem when the story is ultra-compelling, but none of these films are, although The Dark Knight Rises is definitely the most compelling of the three. This factor is what keeps this series from being great, which explains the 4 stars rather than five.

But don't take that the wrong way; I'm just being honest. The The Dark Knight Rises is a quality Batman film.",1345161600,3,1259,4.739726027397261
4428128,3,B004LWZWGK,"I had a few misgivings when I learned of Catwoman being in this final part of the saga.  The Michael Keaton/Catwoman movie was a bit too silly (still better than the two that followed) and I was afraid that the same thing might happen again.  While the young lady that plays the part seems like a fine actor and certainly looked great in the catsuit I still felt that the character detracted from the movie.  It was formulaic.....Batman trusts her from the outset to do the right thing, she disappoints repeatedly, finally she does it.  Not exactly new.

The movie tries to combine the best of the comic book storylines of ""No Man's Land"" and ""Knightfall"" and it's simply too big of a task.  Those stories went on for months; to try to adapt them to less than three hours is ....a tall order.  Just as those comic book stories had their weaknesses so does the movie.  The Batman is too accessible, too public, too much in the daylight.  There is no element of mystery and very little finesse.  Batman doesn't outthink his enemies as much as he simply goes through them.  In all fairness, the same was true of these comic stories.  Batman is less ""the world's greatest detective"" anymore than he is violent and this is part and parcel of the movie.

While it was good to see Batman back on the big screen it wasn't that good.  Here's hoping they don't wait a decade to redo him again.",1344988800,3,1383,4.45816733067729
4428129,4,B004LWZWGK,"I saw this film to complete the Nolan trilogy. Nolan has realized a large vision with solid,definable characters,who anchor the wild and less plausible aspects of a comic book transferred to screen. So you look for Gary Oldman's Police Commisioner,Jim Gordan,you look for Michael Caine's Alfred,you look for Morgan Freeman's Lucius Fox,you especially look for Christian Bale's definitive Batman. His dark growl is less pronounced and it was a pleasure to hear him speak,better,more vulnerable. Bale is the only actor who has come to own the role.

These films(and Inception) court a mass audience,but unlike other blockbuster franchises,he treats his audience with a measure of respect for their intelligence. His Batman attempts to connect with the zeitgeist,here it's the Occupy movement and the resentment against the bankers and the rich. He also picks up plot strands from the earlier films,Batman Begins,The Dark Knight. Christian Bale's limping Bruce Wayne,is scarred from the effort and has drawn down the guilt of Harvey Dent's death.

Nolan wiped away the kitsch debacles of Joel Schumacher's Batman films by turning to the character's origins as created in Frank Miller's graphic Batman:Year One & The Dark Knight Returns. The nourish elements mean women are treated as archetypes,the femme fatale,the victim or ingnue, often in parts that are underwritten and don't allow development, to be distrusted,longed for or mourned. Hathaway provides the spark of fun and sexuality,the catburglar coopted by Wayne in the battle for Gotham's soul. Cotillard is a mystery philanthropist with a twist.

In this film we get a recycling of the Liam Neeson Ra's al Ghu'sl League of Shadows. Tom Hardy's Bane is little more than an anarchist in a sheepskin jacket,inflated to physically menacing,broody and mean proportions,revenge offspring for the death of the villain in Begins. He offers liberation to the people but as in the French Revolution there is the aftermath:terror. His mask occludes his face, Lecter-like,but what he says can be heard. The fight with Batman provides one of the film's centre- pieces,putting Wayne in a hole from which he has to rise out of to rebuild his heroic identity. Bruce's other fight is with his inner demons.

There's no central character of the order of Ledger's Joker. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's Officer Blakeis the honest cop who you look for,a guide in the chaotic frenzy that breaks out. There are chases with new Bat vehicles(a flier and an attack bike),street battles between armies of cops and mercenaries. The soundtrack pounding score by Hans Zimmer soars,but at times occludes some of the dialogue. Nolan seems like Shakespeare and Dickens(Two Cities) to have a fear of large mobs. Again he's largely free of CGI,preferring pure film stock and action freshness. This is a worthy end to a fantastic trilogy,with an opening for another director. Nolan the guru of escapism.",1344902400,3,2916,5.264516129032258
4428130,4,B004LWZWGK,"With The Dark Knight Rises, director Christopher Nolan makes it official: his Batman trilogy is not only the most satisfying Batman film series yet, but perhaps the best trilogy ever filmed. There is no deterioration in the quality of these films from ""Begins"" to ""Rises"", although I will admit that the second installment is still the best. Usually, by the time a third installment is released (The Godfather part III), the franchise collapses under pressure to top the predecessors. Even Return of the Jedi had to include those irritating ewoks!

Nolan even manages to pull off (for the second time in a row) a two villan film, which is usually disaster. What's different about it here is almost a reversal of his two villan strategy for The Dark Knight. Harvey Dent was introduced as a symbol of hope and was turned into a villan. (Spoiler alert from here on) In ""Rises"", Selina Kyle travels that road in reverse.

Many have claimed to have difficulty understanding Bane's dialogue through the mask. I don't share this issue with them. A couple lines were hard to hear, but that happens with most characters in any film, depending on the score and other sound effects. Overall, Bane's voice is clear and Tom Hardy gives the character a vocal variety that is almost charming and not the cliched booming deep voice of masked comic book villans.

Then there's Joseph-Gordon Levitt, who compliments Batman as the everyday example of a superhero. It's risky to make a comic book film where your main charatcer's alter ego is absent for forty five minutes or longer, but Levitt's Officer John Blake is perfectly set up early on to fill Batman's shoes during the film's second act.

One problem I have with the film is its occasional sloppy editing. An example of carelessness is when Selina Kyle drive across Gotham on the Batpod near the film's climax. The streets are abandoned and there isn't any traffic. It is pre-dawn when she leaves, yet by the time she arrives at her destination, the sun is shining as if it were seven or eight a.m.!

That said, the editing and cinematography actually show improvement when it comes to the fight scenes. Gone are the frenzied close ups of hand to hand (and foot to trunk) combat from the previous two films. Here the audience is allowed, or should I say dared, to take in the full spectrum of each blow. For all the stunning visual effects in this film, from batpods to a jet simply called ""the bat"", to bike chases and massive, stadium crumbling explosions, the most impressive and jarring moments in the film are the brutal fist fights between Bane and Batman, the first (and best) of which is presented without any score. Kudos to Nolan and composer Hans Zimmer for knowing music could not add anything to that scene; perhaps only cheapen it.

As I write this review the film is still playing nationwide, and my advice is if you haven't seen it im IMAX yet, do so. I've seen it in IMAX three times; perhaps I've gotten my fill, but who knows? The three to four months until the blu-ray comes out sounds like a long time to wait.",1344902400,5,3071,4.66728280961183
4428131,5,B004LWZWGK,"I have little to say about this film because it is a good film by its special effects and by the various components it contains, from the strong and barbarous terroristic emotions to the powerful and human passions and to the political meaning it conveys.

Starting with the last point the dark knight that rises is a direct allusion to the rising of Jesus after his crucifixion and to his rising some time later to heaven. The next film will be the second coming with some self-appointed successor. That will be hard to renew the genre but I am sure they can find some authors to write the next episode.

As for the political discourse the film also presents terrorists as people who have suffered some injustice and who come back for a vengeance. They are manipulated by a slice of the top society who thinks they are going to fill up their pockets and their bags. Of course they end up manipulated by the terrorists and dead because the terrorists only have one thing in mind, their vengeance. That's the extreme right alluding to the Tea Party movement and the Tea Party Patriots with Paul Ryan who is coming from that section of society, the presentable faade of this extreme right violence.

On the other hand the extreme left and the Occupy Wall Street movement is not very far and the discourse about a revolution to give power back to the people and to get rid of the rich, the powerful, the exploiters and the profiteers and then to redistribute the recuperated riches is common in our countries where it is easier to be unrealistic than to be sober and clean-minded. Ask Hollande how he was elected and look at what he is doing. Brilliant hypocritical demagogy.

Both movements bring armies of volunteers whose objective is looting, killing, destroying and torturing. You can have a lot of volunteers in our society. Marx called them the lumpen-proletariat, those who have nothing to lose except their chains, but not their souls because they have none. You have to add to these the anarchists who consider society has to be destroyed to liberate the collective mind and the small delinquents who find in the opportunity the possibility to steal a computer here or a telephone in some pocket or whatever can have some value or can be a trophy. In both cases these movements start with opening the prison to liberate all the prisoners who are obvious social and political prisoners. Havoc comes in both cases anyway.

Then you have the strong and barbarous emotions of the injustice suffered by those who are going to become terrorists. They are sent to prison on a whim or for some vengeance. Children can be born in prisons that are nothing but dying hospices. Then some escape. Then some are tortured to the extreme of their possibility to resist and they die during that barbaric treatment, or should I say processing, like raw meat in a butcher's shop. And you end up with a daughter and a protector and a father and a dead mother and a lot of sad horror.

On the side of human and powerful passions there are plenty too with Batman of course, an orphanage and the children there, the blind violence and fake justice imposed to anyone who is not favored by the new masters. The suspense of the bomb and the count down. The constant choice of being killed when resisting, or being given the choice by some revolutionary tribunal to die by hanging or to die by drowning when going out into exile. And some amorous passion comes up too, and the valet Alfred betrays his master.

A film to see if you like strong action. If you prefer comedies, author's films, manifesto films or hefty social and cultural stuff, abstain from this one that is none of these. But it is entertaining enough to even make you think. What did I say about Paul Ryan? Interesting, Dr Watson, interesting indeed.

4428132,5,B004LWZWGK,"The Dark Knight Rises

Great film, action packed drama in the conclusion to Nolan's Batman trilogy.  Like Batman Begins, we get a fully developed view of Wayne, the state of his company and empire, and more importantly his own personal struggle, as he sacrifices his reputation of both his Wayne ego and Batman persona to help Gotham City.  His selflessness knows no bounds.

Unfortunately his selflessness grates on his long-time friend and butler, Alfred.  The dynamic between the two was quite emotional and powerful.

Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon really takes a beating in this film.  The guy is barely out of the hospital and is running not only the remnants of the police force, but pushing for a ""hot head"" cop to head his detective division.  This young guy plays a few twists and harrowing experiences especially towards the end, which foreshadows (for me at least) a possible fourth film?  Sure, Gordon jumping onto trucks and tracing a nuclear bomb may be unreal, but it was a lot of fun!

Best characterization goes to Anne Hathaway as the Catwoman.  Unlike other versions of this character, Selina Kyle is a cat burglar with no superhuman powers other than her extreme athleticism, sly wit and martial arts moves as she dances with the devil and flirts with the Bat.

Bane was an OK character.  Clearly Nolan paints this guy to be the ultimate in terrorists.  Shooting up the stock exchange, blowing up a few bridges and terrorizing the populace was a bit overwhelming.  The fight scenes with the Bat and Bane were great, but I did not expect the Bat to lose so quickly!

Themes:

Some of the themes of the film were old, but they were warmly familiar.  The father figure of Gordon, his personality and strength coming from several places: wanting to protect reputations, taking a hot-headed cop under his wing, and finally some flashbacks to Batman Begins where he comforts a boy who just lost both his parents in a mugging.  The Gordon character was over the top by the way.  Let's get past that!

Loyalty to a vow, betrayal and trust run throughout the film.  Ms. Tate plays a strong role in this as well as the continuing vow from the League of Shadows (introduced in Batman Begins), all play well and to the hilt!

Bottom Line:  Catwoman takes the film to a whole new level; more humor and struggle than the other characters.  Bruce Wayne's ""Howard Hughes"" move was hard to take, breaking his vow and helping Gotham one more time.  The betrayals from the Board of Wayne Corp and from friends who are enemies and enemies who are friends, may be hard to follow in the first viewing.  Just enough explosions and firefights to satisfy the fanboy as well as the casual viewer of these Batman films.

4428134,4,B004LWZWGK,"The technical errors in THE DARK KNIGHT RISES are enough to warn viewers that they'll wish there were subtitles for some of the quiet scenes between Marion Cotillard and/or Anne Hathaway, both of whom have a habit of dropping their voices at key moments. Miss Cotillard has whole sentences that are key to an understanding of her character that are barely intelligible at a crucial plot point. Surely, whoever designed the audio mix has some explaining to do.

Otherwise, fans will get their money's worth of action and thrills despite a lumbering plot that takes far too long to unwind after a breathtaking opening shot involving mid-air hostages.

And the performances are uniformly fine from the large cast--Christian Bale, Tom Hardy, Anne Hathaway, Matthew Modine, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Gary Oldman and Michael Caine. But the flaws are there in the script which has too many strands of sub-plots to cover and too many humiliating fights between Bane and Batman before the man of steel redeems himself again.

Nevertheless, there are moments where it kicks into high gear between some dull stretches. Christopher Nolan sees to it that the action sequences are given top priority to any other values inherent in the script. All of the gadgets are as slick as ever.

Personally, I still prefer the first and second ""Batman"" films to this one which is sometimes too muddled in content. Biggest drawback is the fact that the sound mix of voices vs. explosions (and Hans Zimmer's music) has been poorly handled at key moments in plot development.

Fans of ""Batman"" will probably overlook the audio weaknesses in the long run, but I felt they should be pointed out, especially since so much expense was put into the visuals of this action epic.",1344297600,2,1741,4.948630136986301

When a psychotic ex-prisoner named Bane appears in Gotham and threatens to destroy Batman and the city Bruce is left to make a difficult choice. I have liked every Batman movie that has been made (except Batman & Robin) and this most recent trilogy has been amazing. They have all been really rich in story and they feel like movies and not just comic-book movies. I said when THE DARK NIGHT came out that no movie can live up to the hype of that movie but that came as close as you could. That movie set the bar for the franchise to an almost unreachable height and no sequel can really compete with that movie...but this one came as close as you could. While not as psychotic as the Joker, Bane is a great companion villain to him and is more calculating then the Joker was. There are many sub-plots going on but the movie doesn't feel jumbled at all. I have to say for Nolan to end this the way he did shows huge guts and if the studio was smart this would be the end of the franchise. While the Tim Burton movies were fun and good the Nolan trilogy had much more substance and I really don't think that the Batman character can benefit from a new director and style. He said this is his final Batman and as much as I hate to say it this should be the final movie in the franchise as well. In Hollywood though its the money and not the quality that dictates what is made. Overall, a perfect conclusion to the trilogy. I give it an A.",1344297600,130,1884,4.26536312849162

He is huge and strong plus he has those fancy gizmos and loyal men who work for him. He is a seemingly impossible foe for ailing Batman who kept reminding me of Rocky V.

Anne Hathaway makes for an interesting Catwoman who freely walks the line between good and evil. She is perhaps the most complex character in the story. The film has an incredible amount of action with important plot points happening nearly all the time. You don't want to go out for popcorn during the feature, you will be lost when you return.

4428138,5,B004LWZWGK,"""The Dark Knight Rises"" is the conclusion of director Christopher Nolan's superb ""Batman"" trilogy, with Christian Bale as the Batman.  This is no ordinary superhero movie, even by the high standards of Nolan's two previous Batman features.  This is movie-making on an epic scale, with a large and capable cast, tons of special effects, and a narrative that appears to draw heavily from Charles Dicken's novel ""A Tale of Two Cities.""

The scale of an evil plot by the League of Shadows against Gotham City is so vast and complicated that fully two thirds of the movie is expended getting it on screen.  Bruce Wayne and Batman are reduced to a supporting role for long stretches, while the narrative focuses on an especially nasty villain named Bain, a police commissioner with a bad conscience, a cat burgler with more conscience than she can admit to, an ambitious but cowardly senior cop, a young cop with too much conscience, the violent mob that overruns Gotham, and the people who betray Gotham from within.

The theme of the movie is redemption, especially but not only for Bruce Wayne.  Bruce and Batman will be humiliated, beaten nearly to death, and finally consigned to a place called Hell, before the story calls for his heroic return and even more heoric act of sacrifice.  It isn't pleasant to watch in places, but the ending should make it all worthwhile.  There are plenty of action sequences and lots of excellent special effects along the way.

Anne Hathaway was probably not the obvious choice for Catwoman, but she can act.  She does an excellent job portraying the complex and conflicted cat burglar Selina Kyle, a woman in search of a clean start.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt almost steals the movie as the honest cop John Blake.  Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, and Morgan Freeman reprise their roles from the earlier movies.  This reviewer wishes ""The Dark Knight Rises"" had been a little shorter, but loved the ending; highly recommended.",1344038400,,1951,4.8936170212765955
4428139,4,B004LWZWGK,"What a mess. A thoroughly entertaining, ridiculously over the top, with plotting you could fly a bat through mess. A convoluted, unstructured, fanciful and even at 2 hours 40+ minutes, incomplete mess.

That said I love it! What DKRises lacks in the relative realism of the first two it makes up for in Kapow!

If the prison doesn't seem particularly deep and dark and Wayne's recovery seems a little too miraculous and Bain's marshal law seems predictably easy to come by, to live with and predictably easy to topple, Dark Knight Rises slaps you in the face with some throwaway humour and gleefully piles on the coincidences, baddies and death defying escapes as camp as anything from the Adam West series. Significantly, straight edged new rookie cop is told ""You're a detective now; you're not allowed to believe in coincidences."" Except for those on every page of the script, of course...

Anne Hathaway shoots to the top of my Sheldon-o-meter as the best of Batman's cat-burglars. Christian Bales' performance seems phoned in from The Machinist, for an actor of his calibre and considering the journey Nolan's Batman has taken, he's given very little actual acting to do. Bain is successfully intimidating but the mask does reduce him somewhat to comic book villain whereas Ledgers Joker, despite the face paint, was scarily real.

And finally, where the first two films were true in a great many ways to the revamped vision of Batman as a real hero in a real world torn between justice and revenge, love and duty, in DKRises we're given a CGI'd fairy tale full of crammed in flashbacks, wide scope storytelling, and over reaching set pieces that dissolve any sense of atmosphere, threat and danger and continuity with the previous two movies.

So Batman Begins was great, The Dark Knight was a classic, DKRises is... Well, truly, there is a lot here that is risible and poorly done but suffice to say Nolan has finished off his trilogy with a bang: A big, loud, vacuous bang... Michael Bay would be proud...",1343865600,3,2013,4.840116279069767
4428140,4,B004LWZWGK,"The third and (supposedly) final of Christopher Nolan's Batman films ends on a rising note.  This film is quite long at two hours and forty-four minutes, but is hardly lethargic; it takes that length of time to address the many plot threads left dangling from ""The Dark Knight,"" as well as introduce a number of new characters.

These new characters are culled from the comic book's past; for the uninitiated, they work quite well on their own, whereas Batman devotees will feverishly compare them to their preconceptions of the way they remember them.  This film avoids most of the pitfalls found in other third acts; while addressing previous installments, this film is not a mere repetition of them.  It develops and expands on established themes, and reaches a strong conclusion.

Set eight years after ""The Dark Knight,"" ""The Dark Knight Rises"" finds Bruce Wayne a hobbled recluse, shut off from the world due to regrets about his past.  The appearance of the cunning thug Bane, as well as the cynical thief Selina Kyle forces Wayne out of retirement and into a final reckoning with events established in the past two films.

Like Selina Kyle, director Christopher Nolan steals from the best - in this case, the Charles Dickens classic ""A Tale of Two Cities.""  ""Rises"" even copies the convoluted moral about class struggle in Dickens book: the working class is oppressed, and does have legitimate grievances, but for Pete's sake don't let them take over.  Pretty clever; both the ninety-nine percent and the one will feel vindicated.  The ending borrows from Dickens' novel, and if there's any doubt, the ending of the book is read aloud.

One humorous problem with the film is Bane's muffled voice.  Speaking behind a tangled breath mask, wheezing like Darth Vader's love-child, Bane is often incomprehensible.  Arguments between Bane and the Dark Knight will have everyone turning up their hearing aid's.  Perhaps it is Nolan's act of defiance against viewers who complained about Batman's gruffly-garbled verbiage.

And what's a trilogy without completion of a thematic circle?  Wayne/Batman must escape a pit which is strongly reminiscent of the well he fell into as a child in ""Batman Begins.""  Schmaltzy perhaps, but it works.  So does the film.",1343779200,4,2256,5.035040431266847

4428142,5,B004LWZWGK,"What cannot be said about ""The Dark Knight Rises""? Eagerly anticipated by many, I myself have been counting down the weeks to its opening release. I've seen some not so good reviews written about the third Dark knight film and well...I don't see it, much less agree with the over analyzation of the story and characters. Folks, you have to remember. This is a film series based on a comic book universe and characters within that universe. Picking it apart and over analyzing the script, story and characters is well...really kind of pointless in my opinion. It's made for entertainment and well...the third film not only delivers that promise, but it also adds closure to ""Bruce Wayne"", and the first two stories as well.

Without giving much away about the film for those of you who haven't seen it, Bruce Wayne has turned himself into a recluse. Battered and crippled, he hung up his cape and went into hiding for eight years. On the horizon a new evil and threat to Gotham emerge. Bane, a hulk of a man with not only the physical strength, ferocity, cruelty and willingness to use it, he also bears an incredible mind and intelligence that others before him lacked. While The Joker just wanted to screw with Wayne's mind attempting to bring about anarchy and chaos to Gotham, Bane's intentions on the other hand are far more sinister. To not only finish what his predecessor Raz Algoul and the League of Shadows plan in the beginning, but to burn Gotham to the ground, turn its people on each other and immerse society into chaos. More importantly, to not only destroy the city, but to destroy Wayne's soul, but to break him. Wayne answers to this threat, but is it too much for him to handle or too late?

Seeing is believing my friends and I urge you to not take the negative reviews to heart or word for word. They are opinions spouted out by a few who are hard to please. This isn't Saving Private Ryan, Shindler's List or ""The King's Voice, it's a film based on a comic book and comic book characters.

4428143,4,B004LWZWGK,"""The Dark Knight Rises"" concludes the Batman trilogy that Christopher Nolan started seven years ago with ""Batman Begins,"" an epic installment that builds on its past while providing a cracked lens view of the rising social inequality of the present. It's a testament to Nolan's team that he was able to pull off three superhero movies that are tightly integrated yet excellent films in their own right.

""Rises"" takes place eight years after ""The Dark Knight,"" with Gotham City in a state of peace under the Dent Act (named after district attorney turned psychopath Harvey Dent/Two-Face). Like the beginning of Frank Miller's seminal work,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dark-Knight-Returns/dp/1563893428/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dark Knight Returns</a>, Batman (Christian Bale) has retired from crime fighting after the death of those closest to him. Like the end of that same graphic novel, Gotham's peace is merely a patch over a festering corruption. On the anniversary of the Dent Act, Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) plans to tell the world the truth: that Batman took the fall for murders committed by Dent and the Joker (nowhere to be seen). When his courage falters, Gordon's investigation into a congressional representative puts him squarely in the path of Bane (Tom Hardy), a guy so villainous he was thrown out of the League of Shadows.

I was unhappy with the changes to Bane, who was stripped of his ethnic heritage and his steroid-like Venom. But having seen the movie, I now understand -- the plot requires Bane to be a white guy. He's been transformed into a sort of anti-Batman, second guessing everything Batman does. Less forgivable is his Sean Connery impersonation, a Scottish burr muffled behind a mask that makes Bane sound like a jovial Santa Claus. It's disorienting to say the least, and at times almost indecipherable, particularly in a THX theater where the soundtrack rattles your ribcage.

Meanwhile, Wayne Enterprises is in disarray. Having already lost control of the company because Bruce Wayne shelved his weapons division, business rival John Daggett (Ben Mendelsohn) strikes a fatal blow by bankrolling Bane's attack on the Gotham Stock Exchange. Like so many Americans who have lost their wealth, Wayne is now bankrupt as the rest of us.

After being badgered into returning to the outside world by father-figure Alfred (Michael Caine), Wayne is torn between two love interests: board member and global do-gooder Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard, stilted) and jewel thief Selina Kyle (Anne Hathway, better than expected). They are both more than they appear, a duality that shadows every character except Alfred, which becomes an irreconcilable difference between he and Wayne.

Batman finally rouses to action to take on Bane, only to discover that his false reputation as a murder causes more harm than good, just like it did when the Joker framed Batman for his own murder in The Dark Knight Returns. When Bane's plan goes into full swing, the plot diverges into two story lines: the breaking of Batman's city (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Man-s-Land/dp/0671774557/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Man's Land</a>) and his body (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Knightfall/dp/0760754381/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Knightfall</a>).

What ensues is an all out war that veers from the unbelievable to comic book levels of audaciousness. Nolan's grim and gritty take on the universe doesn't always make sense (3,000 cops for millions of citizens and enough food ferried in to feed them all?), but it makes up for it with spectacle and the chilling parallels to American society today.

That's what makes ""The Dark Knight Rises"" so good. A villain rises from the Lazarus Pit. The police rise from the ruins of Gotham. Batman rises from the wreckage of his ruined body. Wayne Enterprises rises from fiscal ruin. And, Nolan warns, if we don't do something about social injustice in America, the people will rise too.",1343606400,6,4082,5.563607085346216
4428144,4,B004LWZWGK,"For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  I just want to give my thoughts on this movie...

I'm fresh from the theater, having just seen The Dark Knight Rises.  For me, it's the second best movie of the three Christopher Nolan Batman movies.  These Batman movies courtesy of director Christopher Nolan are gritty, realistic, and have the feel of cop dramas, and The Dark Knight Rises is no exception.  This has both its positives and negatives, as I feel that these movies have little or no hint of being comic book movies, but at the same time, they are a new ""realistic"" take on the Batman character and the villains, so it's refreshing, I guess.  I'll put it this way - I like the Tim Burton movies the best, when when I'm in the mood for a more serious take on Batman, I'll reach for one of the Nolan movies.  This movie (as well as the others in the series) is heavy on violence.  This movie, I feel, is by far the darkest of the three in terms of atmosphere, grittiness, and violence.

Anne Hathaway?

THE.  BEST.  CATWOMAN.  EVER.

She was superb as Catwoman.  Her looks, her attitude, her wardrobes, everything was great.  She totally kicked major you know what.  When it was announced in early 2011 that she received the role of Catwoman, the general public just said, ""What?  I can't see her as Catwoman"".  People couldn't see her playing Catwoman for the lamest reasons, such as the fact that she's been in comedies over the years.  Just because she's been in comedies over the years doesn't mean she can't play a serious role.  What people fail to realize is that Anne Hathaway's occupation is ACTRESS.  Actors are paid to ACT.  What does that mean?  Very simply, it means that the person should be capable of playing all kinds of different roles, in other words, be versatile.  Johnny Depp is a good example of this.  So many people seem to have a problem separating what an actor has done in the past with what they're currently doing.  It's a shame.  There is one scene in this Batman movie where Selina Kyle (Catwoman) is wearing a wardrobe that is strikingly similar to what Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn) wore in Breakfast At Tiffany's (1961).  It has been known for many years that many people view Anne Hathaway as a modern day Audrey Hepburn, so I personally feel that director Christopher Nolan gave a tip of the hat to Audrey Hepburn through Anne Hathaway.  Her catsuit, I feel, was a tip of the hat to catwomen Julie Newmar and Eartha Kitt from the 1960s Batman TV series on ABC Television and to Lee Meriwether, who played Catwoman in Batman: The Movie (1966).  I added one star to my rating of this movie simply because of Anne Hathaway alone.  Anne Hathaway has received praise for her role as Catwoman and has silenced her critics and doubters with her great performance.  Back in 2007, when the general public learned that Heath Ledger would be playing The Joker, people did the same thing they did when it came to Anne Hathaway - ""What?""  Then when the movie came out, people were blown away by Ledger's performance.  Personally, when it comes to live action Jokers, Heath Ledger is my least favorite between Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson, and Heath Ledger.  My favorite is Romero.  However, I do give Ledger respect for his performance in The Dark Knight (2008).  When the public learned that Michael Keaton would be playing Bruce Wayne/Batman in the 1989 movie ""Batman"", people couldn't see him playing these roles and they threw a fit.  Then when the movie came out everybody shut up.  I don't know, people always seem to count chickens before they hatch.  People always seem to write somebody off early even before the person has a chance to prove his/herself.

Tom Hardy did a great job as Bane.  I agree with a lot of other reviewers that a lot of the time it was hard to understand what he was saying with his electronically altered voice.  Other than that, his character delivered.  Christian Bale gave his best performance as Bruce Wayne and Batman.  Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman were good as usual.  Michael Caine was great as Alfred, as he was in the other movies.

The musical score by Hans Zimmer is a big improvement over the two previous movies, especially when I compare it to the score of The Dark Knight.  The music isn't as repetitive as the music in The Dark Knight.  It is more epic and emotional as well.

The overall story in this movie is on a much deeper level, more emotional, and with quite an ending, something I won't reveal in this review.  There are plots holes galore throughout the movie, but then again all three of Nolan's Batman movies have plot holes.  Also, there are things that don't make sense.  In the trilogy, Nolan made a lot of unusual changes to the whole Batman experience when it comes to the characterizations of Bruce Wayne, Batman, Alfred, The Joker, The Catwoman, etc.  A lot of the changes that were made have been hard for me and a lot of people to accept, at least initially.  I guess the best way to deal with it is that you just have to accept these changes and shift gears in your mind and tell yourself that these are Christopher Nolan movies and not comic book based movies.  I'll tell you one thing - if Bob Kane was still around he wouldn't like what Nolan did to the whole Batman universe he created.

One thing that so many people complain about is the fact that Batman is fighting crime during daylight hours.  Gee, I didn't know that every crime out there takes place at night.  Batman is a crime fighter that answers the call no matter what time of day it is.  Let's see, Bane is up to his evil deeds during the day, but because Batman is a ""bat"" so to speak, bats are nocturnal, so Batman should only come out at night to fight crime.  A lot of people (especially the young people of today) have this same ""fighting crime in daylight"" gripe when it comes to the 1960s TV series.  How lame.  Where's common sense?

If you want to see an interesting conclusion to Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy, then see The Dark Knight Rises.  This movie ranks second in my rankings behind Batman Begins (2005).  The Dark Knight (2008) is my least favorite.",1343520000,6,6161,4.545950864422202

4428146,5,B004LWZWGK,"I read the reviews for ""The Dark Knight Rises"" saying there were a lot of plot holes and I wasn't expecting much, I should know better, I thought the ""The Dark Knight Rises"" was the best Batman movie, period.

Christian Bale back as Bruce Wayne/Batman, who has been a recluse for eight years because Batman is wanted for the murder of Harvey Dent and Bruce Wayne is mourning the death of Rachael Dawes, his only companion and confidant Alfred, once again portrayed by Michael Caine, who has been urging Bruce to get back into life and move on, Bruce can't. While Lucius Fox played by Morgan Freeman tries to lure Bruce back to Batman by showing him some cool new weapons, including one called ""The Bat.""

During a fundraiser at Wayne Manor, Bruce is staying in his private quarters and discovers a cat burglar, Anne Hathaway, the first catwoman (although she's never called that in the movie) that has some real claws, stealing his mother's pearl necklace, but taking an acrobatic leap out of a window, evades the hobbled Bruce Wayne.

And emerging from the sewers of Gotham is Bane, a muscle bound mercenary bent on the destruction of Gotham city by nuclear bomb, he cuts off Gotham from the mainland by blowing the bridges and instituting a sort of French Revolution cum ""Escape From New York"" scenario.

One of the most frequently mentioned drawbacks of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is that Batman doesn't make an appearance in the film until 45 minutes into the film, but in that time the story, the plot and characters are being developed so Batman's physical presence doesn't leave a hole in the film or a sense of emptiness at his absence until he appears, as we know he will. The other plot holes are minor and while you may notice one it is soon overwhelmed by the story and the progress it makes.

Director and writer Christopher Nolan (along with brother Jonathon Nolan) wrote an elegantly plotted thriller that has eliminated some of the clunkiness of ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight"" that has enough misdirection in it to keep viewers guessing as to what will happen next and who the real villain is. It's obvious the Nolan's were bringing their Dark Knight saga full circle, there are references and cameos to the other two movies including one by Liam Neeson that almost detracts from the film because it almost seems like he's a force ghost from ""Star Wars."" ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a violent movie but it also has some real emotional depth at the end brought to you by Michael Caine's Alfred.",1343433600,7,2512,4.67420814479638
4428147,3,B004LWZWGK,"""The Dark Knight Rises"" is still fresh in my mind and thus opinion is subject to change with the course of time. That aside, it was an alright movie. Performances were strong, with the exception of one or two, and action sequences were exciting. I also love the fact that its connects more with ""Batman Begins"" than it does ""The Dark Knight"" in regards to its overall narrative.

One of the biggest trouble spots for me was the film's score. I kept wondering why it felt relatively unbalanced or unlike the previous two and lo-and-behold, now I know why. James Newton Howard's contributions was missing from it (I think the only theme I liked in the film was Catwoman's; it was exactly the kind of music you'd imagine to play in the background while a cat is slinking around). It was all Hans Zimmer.

It took a while to realize why Bruce was walking around with a cane, let alone a recluse in his own house. The general disconnect between this film and the Dark Knight was pretty big outside of knowing where it was coming from --- Harvey Dent's death and it's repercussions. I like the fact that his physical deterioration may have stemmed from that fall he suffered from TDK or the general abuse his body underwent before he decided to up and quit. However, in regards to this plot, I'm not sure why they decided to go with the downtrodden recluse instead of having Batman continue to fight the ""good fight"" as a wanted vigilante (I seriously expected them to handle this in the same way did in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-Mask-of-Phantasm/dp/B001P5S6FU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman: Mask of Phantasm</a>""); its literally the impression ""The Dark Knight"" gives you with its finale. What made him give up, what made him (or Gordon) think the death of Harvey Dent would have such an impact on the people that it would force the city to pull itself off its own ass and do something about the crime?

Which brings me to another one of the biggest things that bugged me about this film: the ""Harvey Dent Day"" and the ""Dent Act"" just reeked of a narrative gloss-over. There's telling your audience that the death of a man driven mad has done some kind of good for the city, then there's what they did. The eight year gap didn't help matters either. There was all this talk how the ""Dent Act"" helped clean up the streets, gave the police ""teeth"" (because that's always a good idea) and how Gotham City was in sitting idle in a time of peace, but honestly there was nothing to even speak of this in the film outside of all the mention it gets. All it reminded me of were scenes from the previous films wherein criminals weren't attacking or stealing in order to showcase Batman's beat-em-up style. But then, ""Batman Begins"" did a better job of showcasing a corrupt and troubled Gotham streets than the efforts TDK and TDKR did combined. ""Harvey Dent Day"" (its silly name aside) just made me feel a little ill inside, primarily because, I as a viewer knew the truth about what happened and it just seemed incredibly wrong that they were idolizing Harvey Dent like the second-coming for Gotham city. Especially as a means to maintain morale within the city which later, as one character points out when the ruse is revealed, doesn't count for much in the end.

The movie doesn't really deliver on the hand-to-hand fight choreography like I hoped. It's the same close-up-cut-quick-paced editing that is clearly meant to hide and not illuminate the action sequence your watching unfold before your eyes. I thought it was the sloppiest with Catwoman when she faced multiple opponents. The chase sequences, however, at least never failed to be on point with the choreographed delivery and flow of vehicular and armament slaughter. I've always been of the mind that chase sequences involving vehicles has been Nolan's strongest point in regard to action sequences.

Anne Hathaway's performance as Selina Kyle is something of a hit and miss. On one half she captured the ferocity and unapologetic side of Kyle nicely (she kinda reminded me of Eliza Dushku's performance in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-Year-One/dp/B005CSYQ2S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman Year One</a>""), even if she jarred me with how quickly she switched between dominant and whatever submissive role she was playing to worm her way through particular situations. (And, yes, there was undoubtedly the part of me that was looking for that aged and silky Selina Kyle from ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-The-Animated-Series/dp/B00023E894/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman: The Animated Series</a>"" who played with her cat, Isis.) And yes, her costume works better in motion than it does frozen in a picture. I also love that her goggles play on the cat ears, that was a nice touch. On the other, you had Anne portraying what was basically a unrealized character playing second fiddle to Batman and complicating things for him plot-wise when necessary. She was intriguing, but there was nothing about her that made me even think for one second ""why should I care about her?"" And this, I think, is a pattern you see a lot in Nolan's female characters in his Batman films.

All of them serve a particular character archetype, but none of them ever actually become fully realized as characters or personalities (either because of their short-lived lives or misrecasting). It was largely the same with Marion Cotillard's Miranda Tate/Talia al Ghul. Instead of giving you a reason to care about her in the same way they did with ""Henri Ducard"", she was a brief love interest for Bruce Wayne (a relationship that is defined by nothing and ends as nothing) and a woman he once did with business with for the sake of a Greener tomorrow. Her entire backstory is the definition of ""sacrificed for the surprise"" even if I knew who she was from the get go. Juno Temple was just a waste of screentime and talent. Why was she even there when her role could've been filled by any old character actor, especially since the character is not even named Holly Robinson?

Tom Hardy as ""Bane"" was another weak point in the film. This guy did not embody anything that I even found remotely interesting or compelling about Bane (either in the comics, the DCAU or even Young Justice). He had none of his gravitas, personality or physical presence. He was big white thug who liked to tug on his lapels and turned out to be Talia's ""gentle giant"" friend from her childhood days in the metaphorical embodiment of the Lazarus Pit. I had no problems understanding him, but whenever he spoke all I heard was a mixture of Sam the Eagle and Master Roshi. I could never take him seriously at all. The his part in the ""Knightfall"" aspect of this film was disappointingly weak when it didn't concern Blake and that was more of a nod-and-a-wink than anything.

I love the that the story decided to focus more on Bruce as a character outside of Batman and how he muddled through his non-life in a ""post-retirement"" era. Christian Bale gives a great performance here as a aimless and heartbroken man, but the biggest problem was that he was competing with the likes of Officer John Blake. While I sympathized with Bruce's plight, I found myself wanting to go back to Blake and his escapades more than I wanted to see Batman pull himself out of retirement, injury and deal the repercussions of his personal life crumbling down around him (thanks to a thief and the truth about Rachel finally revealed by Alfred). He almost seemed to become unnecessary in his own film, everything happening around him or being told to him was decidedly more interesting.

John Blake does indeed come off as a mixture of the three prominent Robins (Grayson, Todd and Drake), but struck me more as a Nightwing/Dick Grayson persona, especially given the that the character is a bloody cop in almost the same position as Dick was during the 1998-2000 run of ""Nightwing"". The explanation behind as to why/how he knew Bruce was Batman was a little sloppy, especially since the film seemed to give me the impression almost everyone who mattered seemed to know that Bruce = Batman (heck, I thought, with the way Blake was talking, Gordon already knew before the end of the film). Nonetheless, I could buy it given his and Bruce's circumstances. Blake almost has nothing to do besides chase vapor trails left behind by the villains or Batman, but I love the fact that he was probably one of the few proactive protagonists in the film besides Bruce himself. (While Gary Oldman gives the usual great performance, Commissioner Gordon is criminally underused and almost forgotten about until the semi-end of the film.) The only thing that bugged me was the fact that he had to put on a suit to play detective. All I could think of was ""Inception"" when I saw him the threads. I seriously preferred him wearing the Blue Uniform, but it hardly prevents Levitt from excelling with a really great performance.

Other strong performances stem from Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine as the wizened Lucius Fox and Alfred Pennyworth, with the latter's only detraction being that he was crying or tearing up in every other scene. I get that he's supposed to be convey his heartbreak and concern for Bruce, the boy he's raised for God-knows-how-long, but I dunno. I kinda expected him to use the same steady emotion he did in ""Begins"" and ""Dark Knight"", but I guess this was just was the character's breaking point and man did I want to hug him at the end.

Overall, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" was a enjoyable film. It does its best to conclude up storylines that began in the first or second film and the end, I think, wraps up things up nicely even if was telegraphed from a mile away. I like the idea of a Bruce Wayne being able to pull himself away from the shadow of Batman, even if he is ultimately burdening the shoulders of another (no matter how willing they may be to carry it in the end). That, I think, was the only ""Knightfall"" element they got right and did it in a way that respected both Bruce and ""Robin"". Narratively, I appreciate the fact that it acknowledges and hinges itself more on ""Batman Begins"" instead of relying entirely on ""The Dark Knight"" like I would expect a threequel to do. If it weren't for the Harvey Dent storyline, I believe you could watch the first film and jump straight into the third without trouble. However, it makes the mistake of repeating the same climax in its finale (where it worked in the first film, it's just makes me wish they'd done something different with it's finale). The sacrifice of Selina, Talia and Bane's characters leaves me extremely disappointed as well.",1343433600,17,10745,4.8597161572052405

The only reason why the Avengers made more money was because they showed it in 3D, if this film was in 3D, it would beat the Avengers hands down.

4428150,5,B004LWZWGK,"The Dark Knight returns one more time in the finale to director Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy, The Dark Knight Rises, and like the first two films in the set, the movie does not disappoint. It transcends the comic book adaptation, as more than an action thriller. It's a cerebral film, taking on big themes and psychological issues, and it succeeds in every way.

It's been eight years since the events of the previous film, since Batman (Christian Bale) took the blame for the actions of the fallen District Attorney Harvey Dent (not to mention his death). Bruce Wayne has given up the mantle of the Bat and withdrawn into himself, worn down physically and emotionally. He spends much of his time holed up in his manor, while the city he once protected has rejected him. His company has seen better days, and is now steeply on a decline. All he has left for company is his butler and father figure Alfred (Michael Caine), who worries about how deeply Bruce has been battered by the events of the last few years.

Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) knows the truth of his innocence, but is obliged to maintain the facade of Batman as an outlaw, and he has his own issues to deal with, from political concerns and senior officers jockeying for his post to an arrogant belief in the city that major crime is a problem of the past.

Into the mix come two wild cards. Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) is a cat burglar with an agenda all her own. And Bane (Tom Hardy) is a ruthless anarchist who unleashes hell on the city, in a series of attacks meant to draw out and destroy the Dark Knight, which is only the beginning of what he has in mind.

The finale of the series is a harrowing journey into darkness. The film, scripted by Nolan, his brother Jonathan Nolan, and David S. Goyer, takes on themes that are very prevalent today: the conflict between rampant capitalism and rights of the people, the fear of terrorism, the role of justice in the world. It follows a hero who's just a man, at his lowest point, and asks the question of what can bring him back. There are influences from some of the biggest Batman stories of the comics: The Dark Knight Returns, Knightfall, and No Man's Land are obvious ones. There are also shades of the storming of the Bastille and the French Revolution underlying the story.

The production values of the film are, as before, well worth it. The cinematography is spectacular; there are camera shots throughout the film that will leave you breathless. The special effects serve the story, and not the other way around; explosions for instance, in this film, are done properly, unlike the wildly over-exaggerated garbage we'd see out of a hack like Michael Bay (yes, Michael Bay, you are a hack of the first order. You are a hack in a hack class all of your own). And the score by Hans Zimmer (this time on his own, without his collaborator for the first two films, James Newton Howard) brings back some of the previous themes but goes off in other strong directions. Nolan has chosen his crew well, once again.

The cast itself is splendid in their roles. Marion Cotillard is a newcomer as Miranda Tate, a tycoon with an energy device that may be the salvation of Wayne Enterprises. Cotillard is a gifted French actress who you might recall from Inception, another Nolan film. She plays the role with sublety and nuance, and fits very well into the tapestry of the film. Another Inception veteran is Joseph Gordon-Levitt, playing John Blake, an inherently decent Gotham Police officer. There is a curious quality to his nature, and a basic integrity to him. He becomes the audience point of view character, the everyman we can relate to, who steps up to do right just because it's the right thing.

The returning veteran players inhabit their roles once more perfectly. Gary Oldman as Gordon is as good as ever; Oldman is one of the great character actors of our time, and as Batman's one time ally, we see a man who's deeply unhappy at having to publicly be against the Batman early on, and then finds himself confronting the worst possible crisis of his life. Morgan Freeman returns as Lucius Fox, the Wayne executive and father figure to Bruce who's provided much of the Bat tech in the past. There continues to be a wise strength in his portrayal of the character. And Michael Caine is very much the heart of the film, a foster father to Bruce Wayne, the guiding conscience, the Horatio to Bruce's Hamlet.

Tom Hardy is another Inception veteran, and in that film, he completely stole the movie from the star, Leonardo DiCaprio (admittedly not that hard to do). He plays the monstrous Bane just as I'd expect him to be: a clever and brutal man, hidden behind a strange mask, a ferocious force of nature, and utterly nihilistic. Bane first appeared in the comics in the aforementioned Knightfall story, and has appeared in film, in the cinematic abomination that was Batman & Robin, where the character was a brainless idiot who happened to be nothing more than muscle for the two primary villains. For that and many other Bat-reasons, Joel Schumacher has more than earned his place in the seventh circle of Hell. This Bane is a decisive, bold leader, intelligent and sadistic, willing to do anything to achieve his objectives.

Anne Hathaway plays Catwoman, though she's never once called that through the film. It's probably impossible to outdo Michelle Pfeiffer's take on the character, so Hathaway doesn't even try, instead playing the character closer to the comic book version, a woman who's straddling the line between hero and villain. She brings a strong energy to the role, and her character draws Bruce out of the darkness he has descended into. She's got the look of the character just right, and gives the character just the right dramatic touches in terms of personality.

Christian Bale gives arguably his best performance of the trilogy in this film. His Batman has become brooding and withdrawn, consumed by losses in his life and the rejection of the people he once vowed to protect. The character is at the lowest ebb, and has to find his way out of despair and back to himself; he has to reinvest himself in his mission, to once again be the hero to a city that doesn't deserve him. Bale has an intensity and a drive as an actor that makes him fascinating to watch, and he inhabits the dual role of Bruce Wayne the tycoon and Batman the driven vigilante perfectly. In each of these films he's understood the basic truth: the real man is the one driven by his own tragedy to wage war on crime, to seek justice, and the facade or mask is the carefree socialite.

Nolan has given us three outstanding, spectacular adaptations in this trilogy. The Dark Knight Rises is exhilarating, demanding, and rewarding, and not only is it a great comic adaptation and thrilling action film, it's also one of the best films of the year. It makes us care about the characters, surprises us in unexpected ways, and makes us ask ourselves questions. It makes us think, because it's a film with depth.

Something that can never be suggested of Joel Schumacher, who, rumour has it, still wants to make his (self described) masterpiece Batman & Robin & Batgirl: More Bat Nipple Costumes, All The Time.",1343347200,5,7235,4.674783974862529
4428151,3,B004LWZWGK,"After watching this film the first time, I wasn't quite sure what to think of it. I knew it wasn't a bad film, but at the same time it just didn't sit right with me for whatever reason. So I went back and watched Begins and TDK and I think I figured out why I didn't really care for it. In my opinion it doesn't seem to fit with the other two films.

Warning: Some spoilers

First there's the setting. The concept of a broken and retired Batman living as a recluse is interesting, but it seems to sort of contradict what we saw in the other films. We learn that he hasn't been Batman for 8 years since Dent was killed, which made me wonder, why is he in such bad physical shape then? Rewatching The Dark Knight, I didn't see anything to show where these injuries came from. Why is his leg screwed up? The last scene of Dark Knight was him running away from the camera. If he hasn't been Batman since then and has been living like a hermit, how did he screw up his leg? Also, why did he stop being Batman? Rises seems to suggest it was stress over Rachel, although that happened midway through The Dark Knight and didn't seem to stop him. He sort of suggested at the end of Dark Knight that since Dent died, he had to be the hero. That was sort of the point of Dark Knight that Gotham's savior had to be either Dent or Batman and since Dent died, it had to be Batman, but then Rises suggests that Batman just kinda went home literally right after that. Rises sort of gets around this by introducing what I consider to be a highly implausible ""Dent Act"" in honor of Harvey Dent, in which all of Gotham's criminals are apparently just straight locked up with no sort of legal due process, the streets become clean as a whistle, and Batman ""isn't needed anymore"". The Dent Act also asks you to believe that everyone now believes without a question that Batman killed Harvey Dent, despite having saved him very publicly from the Joker in Dark Knight. I find it strange that things like this are considered realistic, yet more cat features on catwoman's suit are not. Anyways..

Second, the villains. I found Bane to be just plain underwhelming. Physically intimidating sure, but I felt like they had to seriously water down Batman's competence in order to artificially make Bane more threatening. In Begins and Dark Knight Batman would fight using his surroundings. That's basically how he fights, something he learned from the League of Shadows and Ras Al Ghul. ""Always mind your surroundings."" Yet when confronted with Bane and reminded of the League, Batman simply charges at him swinging like a brawler. No tech, no using the environment around him, just straight fisticuffs. I realize that he's been ""retired"" for 8 years, but again, that felt forced and unexplained as I mentioned in my first point, which just reinforces my belief that this was done simply to make Bane seem more threatening. As for Talia, she just felt too much like Ras, and a lesser version at that. Not only does she not get the character development that Ras got to make him interesting, but in the end she's only doing it to carry out Ras' will, which just made her feel like a pawn. The main villian and she doesn't even have her own plan. Overall they felt too similar to the Begins villians. In Begins the villains worked within the system, using it to try to destroy Gotham. In Dark Knight the villains worked to try to destroy the system and induce chaos in Gotham. In Rises, I was expecting another progression to give the villains an overall theme to work with, but it just feels the same as Begins. Talia manipulating the system to try and destroy Gotham.

Third, not enough Batman. Having Bruce trapped in a pit for the better part of the film's second half served no purpose imo. I don't think anybody thought that he wasn't going to escape this pit and return to face Bane. I realize this sort of had to happen based on what we know of Bane and Batman in the comics, but the way it was handled only served to take us away from Gotham and Bane where things were getting interesting, and into a dull situation miles away in which we already know the only possible outcome. Obviously the movie won't end with ""And then Batman died in the pit"" It employs odd and often confusing time jumps that the previous films didn't have, taking away from the pacing and making the film feel frantic. Once Bane starts implementing his plan and things start to pick up, there's literally a 5 month time skip that glosses over Gotham transitioning from normal society to anarchist warzone in favor of Bruce's previously mentioned antics in the pit.

Warning: Spoilers!!!!!!

Fourth, John Blake. I liked the character and portrayal but I felt the ""big reveal"" about him at the end was totally unnecessary and handled in the worst possible way. First off... his actual legal name is Robin? ....... I'll leave that at that, but what bothered me more about how this was handled is that again, this doesn't seem to be consistent with the previous films. In Rises we get Bruce spouting a bunch of nonsense about how Batman was supposed to inspire people into action and that ""anybody can be Batman"" Oh really? What about those guys in The Dark Knight who were trying to help Batman take down Scarecrow and some drug dealers? They tried to be Batman and Bruce responded by kicking the living cr@p out of them, breaking all their weapons and then making fun of their outfits. They did exactly what he's talking about in Rises and he personally beat them up for it. Just seems weird is all..  Also, how did Blake know Bruce was Batman? You can assume that since he's a cop he could've done the detective work and figured this out, but he doesn't say that's what happened. He says he literally figured it out by having met Bruce once a long time ago and recognizing he had the same hidden pain that Blake had from losing his parents? Really?! That's it?! How can you reasonably make such a huge assumption based on meeting someone once and looking at their face?

Fifth, Catwoman. Again, nothing wrong with the performance, but I felt her character was unneeded. Nothing she did in the film seemed to matter, except of course for the fact that they decided to let her be the one to kill Bane. The romance between them felt forced as well imo. I don't see why he would be attracted to her. Her ideology is almost the direct opposite of his. In the comics there's a sense that she genuinely cares about him and a lot of that is due to their long history, none of which we get to see here. I never really get the sense that she saw him as anything other than a 1 percenter or necessarily cared about his well being. When Bane ""breaks"" him, she doesn't seem concerned about him, just concerned about what Bane will do to the city and how it will effect her. It's all about her and I just don't really see what draws him to her in this film.

Finally, the ending. I get it, he retired. Batman gets to live a happy life in Europe or whatever with Catwoman. Great for him I guess, but isn't Gotham gonna be worse than ever now? Gordon will likely lose his job as commissioner because of his 8 year lie to the public and for knowingly framing Batman for Dent's murder. Dent has been revealed as a murderer, meaning the Dent Act will likely be repealed and all these criminals are gonna come pouring back to the streets, including Joker, who isn't dead and who happens to be the direct cause of almost everything that happens in Rises to begin with. I get that they can't use Ledger anymore, but I for one found it strange that they deliberately chose not to once mention the Joker even though nothing in Rises would be as it is without him.

And who's left behind in Gotham to handle this new mess? ""Robin"" John Blake, a man who now has Bruce's suit and gadgets, sure, but none of the League of Shadows training that would let you take on dozens of thugs/SWAT officers at a time, meaning the first time he suits up and hops down into a group of 5 guys thinking he's a bad@ss, he's gonna get wailed on. Bruce didn't even bother to train the guy like the real Robin. Not only that, but Bruce only met this guy what... twice, for a total of 10 minutes and he trusts him with the Batsuit? But I guess Bruce isn't concerned with any of that anyways. He's ""moved on"" and I should be happy that he doesn't have to be the hero and protector Gotham needs like we've come to expect from him over the course of this trilogy, right? I just feel like it sent a strange message where you should do what you feel is right but only until you're tired of it, then you should sit back and have some ""me-time"" with a foxy lady despite the fact that there's still more to be done. I dunno about you but that just struck me as not very admirable and as something no respectable version of Batman would EVER do...

Overall the film is well acted and looks and sounds great, but it's only mildly entertaining and drags in a lot of places. I also felt it was the least realistic of the trilogy which I found unfortunate since the realism is what drew me to the trilogy in the first place. Things like the Dent Act, an old man in a pit who can heal a broken back by punching it, a usb drive that can erase your name from every computer on the planet and a cheesy imo nuclear bomb plot that emerges somewhat randomly near the end of the film serve to make it the most comic-booky feeling film of the three. All that said, again it's not a bad movie by any means and I'd say it's worth a watch, but it's easily the weakest of the trilogy in my opinion.",1343347200,546,9575,4.385698198198198

4428153,4,B004LWZWGK,"I like a good story. In recent years, storytelling in movies seems to become a dying art. Like our culture is too busy to deal with a mature plot and a good story. Not so in Batman. The plot is layered and each character gets an interesting back story.

You don't have to have seen the last movie with the Joker to get what is going on because they do flashbacks. But it helps if you saw the very first Batman. It is three hours long  and I noticed most of the kids and some tweens looked either very scared  or really bored and miserable. Although one very little boy who looked about 6 or 7 seemed to be having a blast.

Their are so many amazing actors in this movie, but I will only highlight two.
Watching Joseph Gordon Levitt in  a juicy meaty role as a young but tough beat cop was a joy for me. I used to love him in different Disney movies when I was a kid. Even then you could tell he was more than just a cute kid.

The scene in which Batman ends up in a pit like prison was beyond tedious. It was forty five minutes to a hour of him trying trying to get out of there. It should of been 15 20 minutes tops. Also, I didn't need to see Batman getting his vertebrae cracked back into place. I know it is a part of life, and I am too sensitive but, it was freaky for me and for the eleven year olds sitting next to me. Also too much time of Batman moping around in the beginning.

Loved Anne Hathaway as Catwoman, she usually plays the same goody goody character over and over again. Although they should stop making her wear super red lipstick. It is not her color. There was no cheese to her part whatsoever, unlike some of the previous cat woman. There are no cats hanging around whatsoever, she acts like your typical tempermental cat. It was nice to see her branch and try something else. The way she speaks and all that reminds me of a certain busty red head on Mad Men",1343260800,2,1882,4.084010840108401
4428154,4,B004LWZWGK,"You have to hand it to Christopher Nolan.  He took it a children's comic, and turned it into something much darker, subtle, and adult.

""Batman Begins"" was raw, ""The Dark Knight"" was ponderous, and ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a satisfying end to the trilogy.

There are a lot of issues with this movie.  The script is more pretentious than it is compelling, the similarities of the plot to the French Revolution amateurish, and the climactic fight between Bane's followers and the police disturbingly silly (what kind of police would run into an army with machine guns?).  And Nolan being Nolan he has to add meaning and substance and parallels and symbols, which burdens the movement of the movie (Christopher, we're just looking for a lot of cool gadgets and big explosions!).

The best part of the movie is the on-screen chemistry between Anne Hathaway and Christian Bale, and it's this on-screen chemistry that brings coherence and order to an otherwise incoherent and disorderly film.  Hathaway is simply ravishing as Catwoman, and Bale has developed grit and character since we last saw him in ""The Dark Knight.""  It's simply enough to see the two together.",1343260800,2,1162,4.923076923076923
4428155,5,B004LWZWGK,"I can understand that many who walk into the theatre to see The Dark Knight Rises do so with incredibly high expectations, believing that to be a success the movie must somehow beat the odds and find a way to eclipse its predecessor.  I must confess I did not walk in with this thought.  I never expected (or even hoped for) better, I simply wanted a new and different experience comparable in quality with the films that came before it, the way The Dark Knight was when compared to Batman Begins.  I am not sure there will ever be another comic book villain portrayed as brilliantly on film as the Joker in TDK, and I felt it unrealistic to even expect such.  Still, I did go in expecting an amazing film, epic in its scale and one that would deliver a satisfying conclusion to Bruce Wayne's arc in this trilogy.  I am happy to say TDKR not only met, but in fact exceeded, these expectations.

The film has an excellent  story, and as an old time comic book fanboy (I still remember reading the first Ra's Al Ghul story arcs) even I was surprised at some of the beats literally lifted from the comics.  That may sound like a bit of a rip off, but in this case the spin Nolan puts on these scenes makes them often more visceral, accessible and believable.  As with the entire trilogy, this movie was like seeing some of my favorite Batman stories literally spring to life, but in a world much like ours rather than in some hyper-reality ripped from the comic book page.  The thrill I feel at this cannot be justly expressed in words.  I have really enjoyed many of the comic book films of the past several years, but this one still serves as notice to the rest of the superhero movie community that they are, by comparison, more or less making live-action animated movies.

The performances, already discussed ad nauseam in many other reviews, are great.  I do believe there are two that stand out just a bit from the rest, with Christian Bale's finest performance of the trilogy as well as Joseph Gordon-Levitt's exceptional turn as police officer John Blake.  Anne Hathaway was very impressive as ""cat burglar"" Selina Kyle and I felt Tom Hardy's Bane was everything the story needed him to be: imposing, intelligent and merciless.

I have read many criticisms of the film, but for me those boil down to nit-picks and likely too much comparison to TDK.  It is long, but those nearly 3 hours fly by.  Yes it does go to some dark territory, but honestly those who were put off by this should really read some of the arcs in the comics that make this movie look downright cheery by comparison (in other words, the story is true to the character).  I do agree there was a lot of character development, which likely could have been done more effectively over the course of two movies.  On the other hand, credit the Nolans for always putting all they've got into each of these films.

Taken on its own merits, TDKR is an excellent film, with awesome pacing and a memorable story that really hit the mark.  As part of what is now my favorite trilogy of all time (sorry George, that episode six is a wart on the OT that only gets worse with your tampering), it is an outstanding conclusion to Nolan's epic Batman tale.  This is a trio of movies that, for me, are simply without peer.",1343174400,3,3277,4.4630872483221475

AS ALWAYS, NO SPOILERS HERE:

How difficult must it have been for Christopher Nolan to have put together this movie?  With such lofty hopes (and $$) placed upon his shoulders, such fan expectations?  And then, to have had the terrible tragedy attached to its premiere...

""The Dark Knight Rises"" really had a mountain to climb in order to even come close to pleasing the general public.

And, the verdict?

Here it is: ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is absolutely amazing.  I loved this movie, and consider it a remarkable achievement.  Sure...there were a few faults with it (and I'll address them in a few paragraphs) but all in all Nolan has provided us with not only a great adventure and a dramatically compelling storyline, but also a fitting ending to Nolan's trilogy.  It is a graphic novel with real gravitas, a fully considered finale to a sweeping epic.

And DON'T WORRY, I will NOT include any spoilers as I discuss it.

First of all: you should know what kind of movie you're going to see.  For those about to leave home to plop themselves down in a (hopefully) comfortable movie theater, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is not ""The Avengers""...for good reason.  While the latter film is all action, action, action from the get-go, ""TDKR"" is much more drama-oriented.

I've heard some complaints from people who said it was too slow, or too long, and this equated to boredom.  However, I think they simply didn't realize that Christopher Nolan is a serious director, and wanted to tell a ""real"" and serious story, not just create a typical pop comic strip in film format.  This is not to knock ""The Avengers""--I think it's one terrific movie, one of the best I've seen in recent years.  Of its type.

The beauty of ""TDKR"" and its predecessors is that Nolan and his brother Jonathan have created a three-story arc that sets a tale into motion, full of backstory and motivation, progresses that narrative through an exciting and sweeping character-driven tale that questions not only the ethics and morality of a single, powerful law officer, but then examines what outcome such an iconic man might expect.

IF HE WERE REAL, in other words, what toll would crime-fighting take upon such a figurehead, especially given the motivations of those who chose to battle him, and how might a man of Batman's stature hope to conclude such an occupation""?  He couldn't expect to go on forever--so how might his story be resolved?

In other words, this is not your grand-daddy's Batman who just went on forever, dispatching foes by the end of every comic book.  Nor is this even the movie begun under Tim Burton's initially competent hand, unfortunately fizzling out and all but sent to the death chamber under the inept Joel Schumacher (""Batman Beyond"").

No, ""TDKR"" is a real and plausible third and final chapter for this particular Batman legend --and please note that I am leaving the ending completely open to all possibilities.  I am only saying that Nolan is done; he is not coming back and he has fashioned his film in this manner.

Okay: ""TDKR"" is not a perfect movie, as there were some rough edges in the story-telling.  For one thing, the time scale seemed off as the story progressed from Bane's takeover of Gotham City and neared its end...you weren't prepped as to when weeks between scenes switched into hours and then into minutes.  And certain developments weren't clear, either: where was Batman placed after his first entanglement with Bane?  And in this post-revolution city, which police officers were imprisoned and which weren't--and how did those who weren't stay out of the jailors' reach?

Some of these questions will probably be resolved for me upon further viewings...and I do plan to see this film over and over again.  As with other really good movies, one can expect to see deeper and deeper levels every time they watch.  Christopher Nolan is one of those directors, and he populates his movies with all sorts of important dramatic planes that bear up to more intense scrutiny, allowing the movie to evolve from one viewing to another.

As one might be able to tell from this review, I am a huge fan of Nolan's, and have followed him from his beginning in, well, ""Following,"" as atypical a movie as one might find, perhaps with the exception of ""Memento,"" his next one, which is told in reverse order.  In and around the Batman tales, he has also directed ""Insomnia,"" ""The Prestige"" and ""Inception,"" which are no slouches as films, either.  (Incidentally, he and screenwriter David S. Goyer are the writers of the next ""Superman"" movie, due out next year.)

I hope this year Nolan's ""TDKR"" is recognized by the Academy as one of the best movies of the year--it was an injustice that"" The Dark Knight"" was not.  Whether a really great film started from a more entertaining genre like a graphic novel should not count against it--""A History of Violence,"" ""V for Vendetta, "" ""Road to Perdition"" and ""American Splendor"" are all landmark films deserving of serious consideration on their own.

After all, Mark Twain and Charles Dickens were serialized in newpapers each week.  I think they've stood the test of time, don't you?",1343174400,4,5144,4.803409090909091

""If you make yourself more than just a man, if you devote yourself to an ideal... you become something else entirely. A legend, Mr. Wayne, a legend!"" Here we are, seven years since Christopher Nolan saved the Batman legacy from the pit of bat crap that it fell into during the `90s. Batman Begins was, as the name implies, a fresh beginning, a reimagining of something that held great potential in a post 9/11culture. So, it is no surprise that the words of Ra's al Ghul should bring us full circle in The Dark Knight Rises. These words, ""...an ideal...a legend..."" expose the shadow of Liam Neeson's too-benevolent cultist throughout Nolan's trilogy. They unmask the difference between men and their legacies; they contrast the polarizing sacrifice Ra's al Ghul made with the Bat's sacrifices; and they reveal a story not just about superheroes and absurd villains but symbols, ideals, icons and the things which make them.

The Dark Knight Rises begins with two symbols bred into Gotham's collective unconscious eight years earlier with the death of the white knight, Harvey Dent, and the betrayal of the dark knight, Batman. The Batman, billionaire Bruce Wayne's alter-ego, has gone into retirement. Meanwhile, Gotham is getting along well under the guidance of commissioner Jim Gordon (played once more by the always-talented Gary Oldman) and vigorous, noble cops like John Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). That is until a slinky Selena Kyle sets into motion a chain of events that lead to the arrival of one of Batman's most notorious villains, Bane (Tom Hardy).

The plot that unfolds involves monstrous action scenes, looming cityscapes, and a music score that, while not at all subtle, does exemplify Nolan's current embrace of epic, booming sounds. That said, if you come to this movie looking for constant emotional grip and release, you will certainly find it, not to mention a cast that becomes itself in terms of character and character development. You will also find socio-political satire that comments on both wings of American politics. And surprisingly, there is a comic lightness (in act 1) that was missing in The Dark Knight. But, above all of this, what really makes this film worth watching is Nolan's insistence on converging the physical world of Gotham, the mental planes of Bruce Wayne's mind, and the metaphysical shroud that makes objects like the Batsuit, Batcave, and Pit so enthralling for audiences. So how does he do this? That is where the making of symbols comes in.

Throughout this trilogy, Nolan has taken a man and conveyed physicality, mentality, and metaphysicality all through his desire to create a society capable of knowing good. Of course, this is paradoxical--how does a man become more than a man and less than a man at the same time--and it is what drives so many to wonder if the Bat will die or live on at the end of this movie. Because ultimately, we come to realize that a man cannot live as a person and become a symbol at the same time. While he lives, he is judged by the actions he makes and will make. But, when he dies, like Harvey Dent and Ra's al Ghul, he is seen by what he has done. In truth, he becomes a legend.",1343174400,4,3211,4.822141560798548

4428159,5,B004LWZWGK,"In 2005, filmmaker Christopher Nolan gave the Batman film franchise, which had stagnated with the dreadful ""Batman & Robin,"" a powerful rejuvenation with ""Batman Begins,"" a darker, more psychological take on the character that delved into how Bruce Wayne, the son of a slain billionaire and his wife, becomes a fearsome, cloaked hero known as the Batman. Thanks to Nolan's powerful direction, a brilliant script from Nolan and David S. Goyer, and terrific performances from a cast that included Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman, ""Batman Begins"" restored faith in the franchise. This was followed in 2008 by ""The Dark Knight,"" which pits Batman against the Joker and his plans to bring anarchy to Gotham City. This film became a box office phenomenon, and won a posthumous Oscar for Heath Ledger for his brilliant, and downright creepy performance as the Joker. With these successes behind them, Nolan and the team decided that, instead of dragging the franchise out indefinitely, they would close their version of the Batman story down with ""The Dark Knight Rises."" With high expectations set from two brilliant films, Nolan and his brother Jonathan came up with a brilliant, epic, and emotional story to bring their version of Batman and Gotham City to a powerful conclusion.

Like ""The Dark Knight"" before it, the film actually defies the expectations of the viewer, but in a brilliant way. When watching the film, one expects that our hero, with help from others, would successfully end the plans of the villain to take over Gotham, preventing any destruction to the city. Instead, Nolan decided to go against the more traditional route. Here, we see Bane, the main villain of the piece, severely injure our hero, and take him to a prison deemed escape-proof on the other side of the globe to rot, allowing Bane and his army of mercenaries to succeed in the plans to take over Gotham City, and create a ""police state"" with martial law, where the villains control everything, and it is up to a band of ""resistance fighters"" to figure out how to stop Bane. Wayne realizes he must overcome his injuries and fears to escape from the prison, and return to Gotham to stop Bane and his plans to wipe out the city with a Hydrogen Bomb. Wayne also realizes that he might have to give his own life to save his city.

At 165 minutes, the film's first hour is somewhat slow, but picks up when Wayne, having been in self-exile for eight years after taking the rap for Harvey Dent's crimes, once again dons the Batman suit to face his toughest enemy. Here, the story kicks into high gear, and leaves viewers on the edge of their seats for the remaining 105-or-so minutes of the film. Nolan's vision to bring grandeur back to the cinemas is clearly evident, as he has crafted a truly epic film, but never forgets the heart of the story, as we see the story of the Dark Knight come full circle, as he faces his greatest test, and must overcome tremendous odds to defeat the enemy. Christian Bale proves once and for all that he owns the dual role of Batman/Bruce Wayne, giving everything he has to make his final performance in the role truly memorable. Tom Hardy is very good as Bane, despite a tendency to be incomprehensible due to his mask (Which I think was a deliberate choice by Nolan, which makes him more menacing by not knowing what he is saying all the time). Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman also shine in their final performances as Alfred, Commissioner Gordon and Lucius Fox. Newcomers, such as Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Anne Hathaway, and Marion Cotillard also give inspired, solid performances. A welcomed cameo by Liam Neeson as Ra's Al Ghul is also great.

Once again, Nolan shows his strong craftsman as a filmmaker, crafting a film that mixes the Comic Book film, war epic and tragedy together in an intense, action-packed film that will leave fans of the trilogy pleased with the outcome. It's not quite as good as the previous film, and it doesn't top ""The Avengers"" as the greatest comic-book film of 2012 (or ever, for that matter), but it definitely ranks with ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" and ""Return of the Jedi"" as one of the best trilogy-cappers of all time. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" comes with my highest recommendation to Batman fans, and those who love great films!

4428160,4,B004LWZWGK,"""The Dark Knight Rises"" presents a bruised and fatigued Batman trying to find inspiration, which is gradually pushed upon him by the realisation that the wellbeing of Gotham City and those he is close to need him to be revitalised.

The film begins quite dramatically and the viewer's attention is regularly stimulated by various shifts in the narrative.

There are many subtle and overt undertones to the story, which includes: a changing social order that advocates wealth collectivism, clean energy production advocacy, and helping the socially disadvantaged.

As a superhero movie it surprisingly delves quite deeply into mainstream social issues, and asserts wealth collectivism as unsustainable revolutionary anarchy.

Batman's own struggles in the film are emblematic of a society that needs to re-evaluate its priorities, but not at the expense of the beliefs and attitudes which are central to its identity.

Therefore, Batman's own journey of forced self-rediscovery is a representation of finding greater purpose and self-meaning for the betterment of Gotham City.

4428161,5,B004LWZWGK,"I went to see the midnight showing that had the longest line for a film I've ever seen, and The Dark Knight Rises was beyond well worth the time I waited in line which was nearly three hours. The Dark Knight Rises is an achievement of film that hasn't been done in well in film in years and you will be reminded of great films like back to films like Lawrence of Arabia, Ben-Hur and Seven Samurai in their story, message, grandeur and scope. It's a rarity to see a film attempt it now days let alone be successful, and The Dark Knight Rises it that kind of film that everyone should see. The film is more than an event film or summer movie. The Dark Knight Rises is simply one of the best movies of all time.

I've never been a big fan of DC comics never really getting into or finding a connection with their characters, but Batman was the exception. I loved the dark tone of the comic and the villains along with the more adult story lines it became one of my favorite comics outside of Spiderman, and the X-Men. Since Batman's conception in 1939 Batman has become one of the oldest comic book characters and one of the most popular, and there have been many TV and film adaptations, and most of them I've seen have been surprisingly good. From Adam West's fun but campy late 1960's version to Super Friends, to the best television Batman in Batman: The Animated Series, to Batman and Batman Begins and Batman: Mask of the Phantasm. There have been many different takes on Batman, but Christopher Nolan's is the best surpassing my favorite Batman film Mask of the Phantasm. What Nolan has achieved here with the Dark Knight Rises and his trilogy of films is truly something special, but I get to that and the director later.

As for The Dark Knight Rises let me get to what I like first, which was everything. I'll address some of the issues some of the critics had later. The story I can't go into too much detail, because it will give away some plot points and there are a few brilliant twists in the movie including the amazing and satisfying ending. The Dark Knight Rises takes place eight years after the end of The Dark Knight. The crime in Gotham has gone way done, because of the Dent Act, which gave more power to the police. Bruce Wayne has disappeared from the public eye hiding in his mansion as a recluse living in his self-pity. He's brought out of his hiding by Selina Kyle and a mysterious Bane who brings death and destruction everywhere he goes. There really isn't much mention to The Dark Knight in the plot of the film or the Joker, and you won't notice that. The Dark Knight Rises does have many connections to Batman begins as Batman's story comes full circle. I'll stop here before I give anything away. I will say that the plot written by Christopher and Jonathan Nolan is well written in story, pace and tone.

Michael Caine is truly a superb actor and he truly wait he had better get a supporting Oscar for this film and he should win it. He is superb as Alfred and has been in the previous two films. Bring such emotion and humor as Bruce's butler, father figure and friend. He wants the best for Bruce just like any parent wants the best for their children. Another old timer who steals many of the scenes of the film is the great Gary Oldman as James Gordon. I again think he should at very least be nominated for supporting actor. Christian Bale again does great job as Bruce Wayne and a good job as Batman. Unlike the other actors who've taken on the role I think he's done the best job getting into the mind of Bruce Wayne and totally embodying the character. There are many new comers to the film. I like I think many people were a little worried about Bain played by Tom Hardy. Tom did a great job. I know people want to compare Bane to the Joker and Heath Ledger, so I will. Tom Hardy made a more vicious bad guy, but is less charismatic, which Ledger embodied in the Joker. They are two different types of villains. I wasn't as upset like most after seeing the Catwoman suit months ago. I was more upset that Anne Hathaway was cast for the part. I thought she was an overrated actress, plus I was honestly hoping for a hotter actress. My doubts were alleviated as the film drew closer and I saw that she could fill out a cat suit. Out of all the new comers to this film series I think she might have done the best job. She brought sexiness and emotion to the character and to be honest I thought she's a better Catwoman then Michelle Pheiffer. Next is Joseph Gordon-Levitt as John Blake. It honestly took a while to get used to the character who is important to the plot, but Joseph does a really good job. Finally we have Miranda Tate played by Marion Cotillard who I thought was the weakest addition to the film even though she plays an important role. Still she isn't perfect but Marion does a good job with the character and time on screen. The only real problems I had with the cast were the supporting cast. Matthew Modine was I thought miscast in the role of Deputy Commissioner Foley. He just never seemed to get into the role or do it justice. Nestor Carbonell the mayor of Gotham who I loved from his days on LOST is barely in the film. I wish they had given him a little more screen time.

I know people may think that at nearly three hours long that it will be boring, but Nolan doesn't let the pace slow down for too long before it quickly picks up again. The special effects and action is spectacular. I like that Nolan tries to avoid using effects unless he has to instead using live actors and vehicles instead of digital renderings. It adds for realism to the action especially the climax in the streets of Gotham. The score done by Hans Zimmer was the best of his job on the series.

To be honest I had never heard of Christopher Nolan until Batman Begins. I had heard of, but had never seen Memento or Insomnia and I question how he got the job for director of Batman Begins. He proved me wrong with the film, and I'll never doubt him again until he forces me to. After Batman Begins I've seen every film of his, and he hasn't made a bad film yet. Insomnia was the worst and it is still a pretty good film. Nolan does a masterful job of bringing his visions to life creating captivating stories and memorable characters. Through his eight feature length films Nolan truly has become a master film maker. The best in the last decade and if he continues the excellent work will go down as truly one of the greatest. What he achieved with The Dark Knight Rises and his Batman trilogy is truly something special. He's created the best comic book film trilogy and the best trilogy every. Yes even better than the Lord of the Rings. I know people would like Nolan to come back, but I don't think he should. Nolan had a vision he admitted to thinking of years ago and brought it to an end with The Dark Knight Rises. Sure he could go on, but like George from Seinfeld said always leave on a high note, and there is no higher note for Nolan then The Dark Knight Rises. Sure he continues making Batman films, but I honestly don't think he could surpass what he's done with The Dark Knight and this film. It's best to leave people wanting more, and I'm sure everyone will. Let Nolan go he's created and done something special with these films. It's time for him to create his own vision, which I'm sure he will in a few years.

Now as I said earlier I was going to address some of the criticism critics have of the film. First some people are saying the films to dark that it's not comic booky enough. First Batman has always been dark. If you don't think so you haven't read the comics or seen the cartoons. The only Batman adaptation was Adam West versions. Even the bad Batman and Robin was a dark film. It was only funny because of how bad the film was, and now as to the general dark tone of the film. Hello almost all of the best films of all time are dark films. The Seven Samurai, The Bridge on the River Kwai, Lawrence of Arabia, A Clockwork Orange, Das Boot, All Quiet on the Western Front and Jaws. I could go on, but I won't. All of these films had a dark theme to their films, and these are truly great films. Dark themed films make some of the best films, because the feature adult stories with flawed and damaged characters trying to survive in a chaotic world as the seek peace and redemption. They don't always win or survive nor do they always get their redemption. That's what makes them great characters, which makes great films. The next criticism I read that the story was incoherent or hard to follow. I had no problem following what was going on. Maybe the people complaining should go see the film again and this time pay attention. Sure there is a lot going on, but the story isn't hard to follow.

Why do people keep wanting to compare The Dark Knight Rises to The Avengers? Is it a better film? Will it make more money? Fine I will answer those questions for you. Is the Dark Knight Rises a better film? Without question The Dark Knight Rises is a better film. The Avengers is a true summer film. With lots of glitz and glamor, and explosions, but if isn't rememberable outside of it being cool to see all the hero's in one film. If you dig deeper into the film there isn't much there. The Avengers could have with Hawkeye becoming free of Loki. I know these are tuff men, but they could have delved deeper. The same could be said for Coulson's death. I thought it was good, but they could have done more. As for the money I don't think The Dark Knight Rises will make more money. The Avengers had a few advantages. First is 3D. Then there is the running time, which I think is about twenty minutes shorter than The Dark Knight Rises, which means it can be shown more often. Then there is the tone and themes of The Avengers, which is more lighthearted. That attracted the tween kids and the parents who will likely allow the children to see the film. The Dark Knight Rises has darker tones and themes along with more violence. That will keep away parents with kids who might be wanting to see the film, which in all honesty I think, is a good thing it's too dark and violent for the tween crowd, or at least that is in my opinion. Finally there are the Olympics, which start next week. That will hurt The Dark Knight a little. All of that combined will keep The Dark Knight Rises from beating The Avengers. I think it might have a chance if the word of mouth gets out about how great the film is and people keep going weeks and months from now, along with people going to see the film multiple times. Though no matter what The Dark Knight Rises is going to make a ton of money.

The Dark Knight Rises is Nolan's Batman trilogy, and his best film in the series along with being one of the best films of all time with a special story, great acting, and amazing action and special effects. Everyone needs to go see the best filmmaker at the moment in his culmination of his work with Batman. It will leave you amazed and satisfied. The ending to the series the film, which I won't give away, is truly something special. Go see The Dark Knight Rises. I will be seeing it multiple times.",1343001600,3,11158,4.322673031026253
4428162,5,B004LWZWGK,"To state that Christopher Nolan's crescendo-building finale to the Dark Knight trilogy is richly plotted is a gross understatement. There is so much going on in the intricately detailed screenplay co-written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan that it's a wonder that he pulls it off with not only cinematic gusto but with surprising clarity. In fact, the artistic success of this epic 2012 adventure has primarily to do with Nolan's virtuosic filmmaking style which reflects an uncompromising level of commitment that stubbornly doesn't translate into the level of Cameron-level hubris you would expect from such a surefire studio rainmaker. In fact, as he showed most effectively in 2008's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dark-Knight/dp/B001OGWY1W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dark Knight</a>, Nolan can take the most ludicrous material and invest it with so much belief and inflate it with unbounded imagination and intelligence, so much so that he can overcome any lingering skepticism (if not endless critical feedback) that belabors the incredulousness of the venture. Unlike 2010's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inception/dp/B0047WJ12K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inception</a>, where he does get carried away with the blinking creativity of its mind-altering concept, the well-grounded myth of Batman tethers him irrevocably to the fastidious demands of an established fan base of not only the 73-year-old comic books but of the movies themselves from the serials in the 1940's to the Tim Burton pictures to ""The Dark Knight"". He also has a firm grasp on the narrative from an emotional standpoint and can still stage a sharp albeit often far-fetched action scene.

Although it's only been four years since the release of ""The Dark Knight"", the story has moved forward eight years since the pivotal moment when Batman disappeared after taking the blame for D.A. Harvey Dent's crimes in order to salvage the hope he represented to the populace in the wake of the Joker's rampage.  Those intervening years have been an extended period of quiet for Gotham City, but it's all based on a deception of misplaced heroism. Bruce Wayne's lifelong love Rachel Dawes was killed in a fiery explosion, and he has become a recluse in his manor under the delusion that she was leaving Dent for him. A clever jewel thief named Selina Kyle unexpectedly enters his life stealing his mother's pearls just as Wayne Enterprises begins to crumble due to Wayne's long-standing absence from the board.  He retreats from his decision to invest in board member Miranda Tate's clean energy, fusion power project after he learns that the core could be modified to become a nuclear weapon. At the same time, a brutalizing terrorist named Bane makes his debut in Gotham City attacking the stock exchange and forcing Wayne to liquidate his assets. Although the act appears initiated by the Machiavellian impulses of a rival board member, the ensuing revolution turns out to cut much deeper as a war against the wealthy with the entire city being held hostage and a deeply personal vendetta against Wayne that inevitably goes back to the story in the first film, 2005's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-Begins/dp/B0014D6PCO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman Begins</a>.

To give away any more would be sacrilegious. Suffice it to say the circumstances become dire leading to powerful images of devastation and visceral showdowns that don't disappoint. If anything, Nolan eschews much of the expected violence in favor of genuine suspense probably due to the pre-release speculation of rabid bloggers who were trying to guess how Nolan would wrap up all the storylines. Obviously if you have some idea of the original comic book storylines, you'll know where the plot is going. Regardless, Nolan has really figured out how to provide the film a climax that is ultimately satisfying. As both Wayne and Batman, Christian Bale proves that he is the actor who best understands the dichotomy of the mythically contrarian role, and in this film, reveals the vulnerability of a fallen public figure with the appropriate gravitas. Several other veteran actors are back for their third round and reveal more depth to their characters - Michael Caine conveying the burdensome weight of Alfred's melancholy while witnessing Wayne as he tortuously resuscitates his secret identity, Morgan Freeman erudite as ever as Wayne's armorer Lucius Fox, and an especially effective Gary Oldman, who as the world-weary Commissioner Gordon, agonizes over the guilt of his long-held secret about Batman and Dent. Even Cillian Murphy and Liam Neeson show up to reprise their previous roles as Dr. Jonathan Crane and Ra's al Ghul, respectively, in memorable cameos.

Nolan also scooped up members of his ""Inception"" ensemble for key roles - a comparatively pallid Marion Cotillard as Wayne's benefactress and burgeoning love interest Tate, Joseph Gordon-Levitt showing more grit than before as police officer John Blake whose idealism remains unabated despite the grim circumstances, and Tom Hardy virtually unrecognizable as the menacing Bane, a deliberate contrast to the chaotic anarchy of Heath Ledger's well-missed Joker. In particular, Hardy sharply conveys the imposing physicality and florid pontification of a relentless terrorist leader, and he and Bale engage in a couple of hand-to-hand combat sequences that viscerally epitomize the good-versus-evil conundrum at the center of the story. The biggest surprise of the cast turns out to be Anne Hathaway who eschews her usually sunny screen persona with infectious abandon as Catwoman (although she is never referred by this moniker in the film). She not only captures her character's slinky amorality and acrobatic moves but also provides clear insight into Selina's nihilistic behavior with welcome economy. It's also her character who acts as a touchstone in announcing to Wayne the coming revolution, which has obvious parallels to the Occupy movement that has monopolized recent headlines. In fact, the one storytelling misstep may be an underlying presumption that an anti-Wall Street screed would automatically establish the moral tone of the film when I think more widespread evidence of such villainy is warranted versus the greed-driven acts of a single company's board.

But let's not forget this is all based on a comic book, and on that level, it enthralls with impressive set pieces, state-of-the-art gadgetry (the high-flying ""Bat"" is cool), and thrilling action sequences beginning with an airplane dismantling sequence worthy of James Bond. I applaud Nolan for not being afraid to stage the group fight scenes with the deliberately superficial expedience of the original TV series. He also doesn't harp on any particular political agenda (despite what professional critics and rhetoric-crazed pundits may claim) and never forgets that balance in his cerebrally meticulous approach all the way through its 145-minute running time. Granted there are some moments of forced humor I could have done without. Regardless, this is one of the few occasions when I felt the movie was actually not long enough. As you would expect, the film's production values are superb from Wally Pfister's dark-hued cinematography (he also lensed the first two films) to Hans Zimmer's appropriately stentorian score to the outstanding production design by Nathan Crowley and Kevin Kavanaugh (Gotham City never looked more realistically like Manhattan) to the multitudes responsible for the special effects (the football game scene is a stunner even from the trailer). Despite my misgivings about the overly expository nature of the first film which comes back somewhat in this one, this is a genuinely spectacular finale to a great trilogy.",1343001600,3,7882,5.558701082431307
4428163,3,B004LWZWGK,"This film contained both good and bad elements. The story, such as it was, was bad. But the acting and the characterizations around the bad story were often well done. When the film was successful, it was successful in spite of itself.

As far as the story goes, a bunch of one-dimensional villians organize a conspiracy of breathtaking nonsense. None of their motivations make any sense at all. None of their plans really seem to have much purpose either. For the most part, the plans simply exist to create a contrived situation where the forces outside the city that would intervene in such a situation cannot intervene. Nolan's three films have all had the problem that most of the leading antagonists are insane nihlists. This one is no exception. Given the material, I give films like this a degree of latitude in terms of story. But the main plot in this film just crossed way over the line.

But on the other side of the coin, we are presented with an excellent characterization of a man in a state of mental, spiritual and physical decline. A fighter who is past his prime and has to start solving problems in other ways. He has to recognize his own limits. He has to move on. Everyone mostly tells him this but he doesn't listen. We get the literal fall of the man and then his reconstruction. All mostly well done with the exception of having him come back physically brawling toward the end as if nothing had changed. In my opinion, he needed to evolve to a point where he was outsmarting people rather than trading stand-up punches with them but it never happened. But still all-in-all good drama within the otherwise ordinary action film.

I liked the twists in the story. I'm not going to spoil them, but they did a good job with things often not being what they seemed.

Anne Hathaway turned in an excellent performance as well. It was another character along the lines of reaching a dead end (in this case a criminal career) and having to change but resisting it. Her character was played smart (mostly) with understandable motivations.

Gary Oldman (as usual) also put in a good performance. He played a sympathetic fanatic which isn't easy. And bringing back Cillian Murphy as the ""judge"" was a nice touch though they didn't really seem to point it out to the audience.

Nolan also deserves credit for carrying his three films on the character to a satisfactory and I hope final conclusion. Anything beyond this film is going to require a substantially different approach.",1343001600,5,2491,4.688787185354691

4428165,4,B004LWZWGK,"Gotham has, against all odds, become a prosperous metropolis, a safer place to be. The Commissioner's anti-crime Dent Act has put a serious crimp on organized crime. It's been eight years since the Batman was last seen, eight years since he was accused of murdering Harvey Dent and the Commissioner allowed the lie in order to serve the greater good. Except there is no dearth of cowardly, superstitious lots. On the rooftops of Gotham and in the secret dens of the priveleged, an elusive cat burglar begins to prowl. And, compelled by a terrifying agenda, the zealot Bane begins to exert his insidious influence over Gotham City. It's been eight years since the Batman deemed his work done. But today his city is once more threatened. Retirement's over-rated.

Never mind that one dude snoring away in the corner of the movie theater late Sunday night. Everyone else walked away fairly impressed. Christopher Nolan has done a wonder. THE DARK KNIGHT RISES caps off one of the best ever cinematic trilogies. Put it right up there with the original Star Wars trilogy and the Lord of the Rings and the Indiana Jones and Toy Story franchises. Is it perfect? No. THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is a tour-de-force but with a few flaws, a masterpiece with scuff marks. It's still unmissable.

Eight years after the horrific climax of THE DARK KNIGHT, we catch up with a hobbled Bruce Wayne. Wracked with guilt over his inability to save Harvey Dent and Rachel Dawes, Bruce has abandoned the Bat suit. Once regarded as Gotham's favorite son, Bruce has become an eccentric recluse, his wealth steadily seeping away. This allows Michael Caine's faithful butler Alfred to deliver several emotional motivational speeches. And maybe one of them finally resonates with Bruce. He straps on a brace on his busted leg and steps out. Whispers of a monster named Bane circulate, and Bruce, who had shied away from his base of operations, ventures down to the Batcave. Good thing he'd long ago installed an advanced copy of Windows 2010, because, even after eight years of neglect, the Batcave's computer system is still cutting edge stuff.

Okay, plot SPOILER in the last sentence of this next paragraph.

Nolan applies elements of BATMAN: YEAR ONE, KNIGHTFALL, and NO MAN'S LAND to his narrative; longtime Batman readers can draw certain plot points from that. This film's scope is amazing. Nolan takes advantage of his near three-hours-long running time to tell a story that is rich and sprawling and occasionally breathtaking, never mind that the staff of JAMA and the New England Journal of Medicine are probably rolling their eyes at how rapidly Bruce resolves his grievous medical ailments in such a constrained timeline. Unless, of course, you really can remedy a broken back just by pushing a protruding vertebra back into the spine.

Nolan is masterful with the technical bits, from cinematography to sound to score to use of the color palette to help establish mood. We're watching a great director at the height of his powers. Let's enjoy this guy. The acting performances, as expected, are across-the-board superb. There were doubts going in about Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle, but remember that people also scoffed when Heath Ledger was cast as the Joker. Hathaway pulls it off. She makes a convincing Catwoman, although no one ever calls her that in the film. I like her character arc, although it's an obvious one. She lends depth to the role, serves as a fantastic foil for Batman. I love Selina's quicksilver personality shifts and that she's razor sharp with her delivery, and that she comes across as equally playful but dangerous. Hathaway's is miles ahead of Halle Berry and Michelle Pfeiffer's interpretations. Hells, she may even be the film's breakout character, although Joseph Gordon-Levitt's resourceful rookie cop also effortlessly commands the screen.

In the excessive neck snapping portion of the discussion, I predict that Tom Hardy's ominous big bad will be the most slighted performance. But Hardy exudes presence, and, contrary to the early trailer, I understood most of his dialogue. But why did Bane have to go out with a whimper? He deserved a bigger finish.

THE DARK KNIGHT RISES isn't as good as THE DARK KNIGHT. How could it be? As solid as this cast is, no one reaches the sublime heights of Ledger's Joker. But this is a deserving finale that, judged on its own merits, achieves its own measure of brilliance. Nolan had ""epic"" in mind when he closed the books on his franchise. His Batman is traumatized and gets put thru several kinds of hell. Even Frank Miller wants to give him a hug.

There are scenes heavy on exposition, yeah, but only rarely did I feel they were slow. There are at least three twists in the third act, one of which we see coming from jump. But never mind. THE DARK KNIGHT RISES meets expectations but doesn't exceed them. Predictably, it combs the darker psychology of the superhero. It's even a bit of a social commentary. It is brooding. It is epic. Its scale is ambitious. It builds its hero into a grand mythic figure. It's not as ""fun"" or bright as THE AVENGERS, but it's as equally rewarding and, at times, goosebumpy. Okay, Christian Bale's harsh Batman voice still aggravates.

Stay for the post-credits scene in which the Batman is in a diner eating shawarma.

No, don't do that.",1343001600,2,5329,4.8719646799117
4428166,5,B004LWZWGK,"Christopher Nolan puts the human element front and center, taking the cartoonish out of super heroes and making ""The Dark Night Rises"" seem a lot shorter than 2  hours. The aches and pains of being a super hero or super villain one wouldn't think compelling but in the hands of Nolan and an all-star cast it's riveting. Nolan is producing Superman ""Man of Steel"" for 2013 release. I can't wait.
 Erstwhile political commentator Rush Limbaugh saw something nefarious in a ""Dark Night"" villain being named Bane in the same year that the Republican presidential nominee is a Bain Capital alumnus. Leaving aside that Bane dates back in the comic books to 1993 and that Nolan and Daniel Goyer wrote their script in 2010, Rush is right that the film may do damage to neoconservatives/establishment Republicans but not in the way that he thinks. The fact that Bane's act of love and protection is the reason for his damaged face/mask does damage to the neocons' simplistic view of evil. That Batman, too, wears a mask because of love and acts of protection and factoring out megalomania and unconcern for collateral damage that he's very much like Bane (they both had the same mentor) is more firepower directed at the unthinking neocon intellectual edifice. Yes, Rush, be afraid, be very afraid.
 Perhaps Rush can relax because ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is the third in Dolan's trilogy although I got the sense that this excellent movie will be seen historically as the end of the beginning. At film's end Detective Blake is ready to pick up the mantle as Robin/Nightwing. Nobody calls him either name until five minutes before closing credits but those with soul to see can tell early on that Blake is on his way to Robinhood.
 Gary Oldman (""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"") is at his usual tortured excellence as Commissioner Gordon, hiding the terrible secret of District Attorney Harvey Dent's descent into Two-Face madness for the good of Gotham City. Batman/Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) goes along to his own psychological detriment/physical endangerment.
 Dent's legacy reminds us of the double-sidedness of the law - essential for social order yet an instrument of oppression when taken too far (as rigorous enforcement of drug laws today falling disproportionately on the poor demonstrates). Glory-seeking by some police is given respectful, honest treatment.
 Conservatives will appreciate the treatment Nolan and Goyer give Bane's ""power-to-the people"" revolution. That thievery and kangaroo courts are the main offspring of ""people's"" movements is not something that should surprise any serious student of history although these tendencies are neatly camouflaged by the ""civilization"" we take for granted. Bravo to the script writers for their astuteness about the human psyche.
 Additional kudos for leaving off the super hero titles which further displays the brokenness of the people. Bruce Wayne doesn't don the Batman suit until at least 30 minutes into the movie. At his heels is Alfred (Michael Caine) pleading for Bruce to help Gotham in a different, more lasting way. Alfred issues a Clubber Lang-type (see ""Rocky III"") warning about Bane that is ignored and their friendship isn't the only thing that gets broken as a result. Selina Kyle is a cynical, reluctant heroine as Catwoman. The fact that she isn't labeled Catwoman makes us listen to her heart.
 That Noland and Goyer didn't just retell the DC Comics classic ""Knightfall"" tale (available in graphic novel and hardcover book) is in keeping with The New 52 movement launched by DC last year. Both endeavors take pieces from the classical canon and arrange them in new and compelling ways. As the folks at Bain Capital might say, this adds value.
 Nolan hits it out of the park with a late plot twist revealing that Bane is not the central villain and that the central villain has been hiding in plain sight. Backs are important in this movie - I urge you to study them. The body language communicates itself subtly but assuredly - a pretty face or a mask can hide an evil mind and the key to combating wickedness is to understand what's gone before (or at your back as some might say) and stand boldly for your truth.",1343001600,,4186,4.977110157367668

There are times when I really hate being obligated to a star rating system, because some parts of the movie were 5 star caliber and other times it was 1 star caliber, and everthing else in between. The pacing was relatively good, but still could have done with out a few scenes here and there. The main villian's presence did offer that ominous impending doom that was absent from The Avengers movie, but TDKR hero payoff was somewhat shallow. And after a while it got pretty old watching the same method Bane would rid his helpless victims. As I was watching this I was wondering "" Is this movie a bit too apocalyptic for a Batman movie?"" For many people the greatness of a movie is measured in the number of explosions, how big they are, and how fast and long chase scenes are. So for those people this movie will rate very high. But for people like me who place story, intense drama, and great scripting first, and action and great visual effects to move the story along second, Batman Begins is by far the superior of the trilogy and the best Batman movie ever made. Watch it again, for the first time.
FANBOY REVIEW:***** 5 stars. I wish it could be 20 stars. This is the greatest movie ever made. It's equal to The Dark Knight, only better. But The Dark Knight is better. Bane was just as awesome as the Joker, but he wasn't as awesome as the joker. The Joker wasn't as awesome as Bane. I can't believe how awesome this movie is. I'm going to throw away all my other dvds , and only keep my Dark Knight. Then when The Dark Knight Rises comes to dvd I'm going to buy two TV sets another dvd player and play both movies side by side all day everyday for the rest of my life, because after seeing these movies I simply can't make up my mind which one is awesomer. Or is that awesomest. Oh I simply can't get over how perfect these movies are. Especially this one and especially the other one. You know what I'm going to do I'm going to take as many days off from work while the TDKR is in the theatres and watch it over and over all day long. Then I'll go home and watch TDK on dvd all night long until TDKR comes to dvd. Then I can watch both at the same time like I mentioned before. : END OF REVIEW. There.

4428168,3,B004LWZWGK,"Much must be explained about why Christopher Nolan, who put together a trilogy of the most celebrated Batman movies of all time, would say that this one, ""Dark Knight Rises"", would be the last. It is most likely because he is now producing the upcoming ""Superman"" series as well, or maybe it's the typical Hollywood excuse of, ""I'm more than just Batman. I want to be more than just this."" Whatever the reason, it's a shame. Apparently, fans showing up in drones and giddy with glee isn't good enough for some.

For the third and final outing, the anticipation may be better than the movie. It has a lot to follow up on after the second movie. ""Dark Knight"" blew up beyond recognition behind a posthumous Oscar winning performance by Heath Ledger. With a larger than life storyline and some characters existing only to make small stories come to life, Nolan has a lot on his table and was trying to make a gigantic splash for his last trip to Gotham.

The entire trilogy, beginning with ""Batman Begins"" has always been more about the man behind the mask than the man wearing the mask. ""Dark Knight Rises"" is no exception. Why does he do what he does? Why is he so special, other than the costume he wears that most of us would get laughed at wearing? Nolan answers all the questions and that may be part of the problem. For most of the movie, it seemed he was trying to cram every Batman apologue into his final hours before he left it. At one point, we know that Gotham's fate is on a timer, yet Batman stops to kiss the girl and reveal childhood secrets to Commissioner Gordon before taking off.

Batman has been around since before World War 2 and many have taken liberties with the back-story and characters since. Nolan is no exception. Forget everything you've seen in the past or your expectations of what the villains Bane or Catwoman should be. I found the liberties taken here, were good ones, although Anne Hathway's Catwoman was way too interesting to be way so underused. Along that same line, there are many surprises that you won't see coming.

You really can see the wheel of fortune of story-lines fluttering by in the first half of the movie as scenes jump from story to story. All of the story-lines come to form eventually and mostly begin to flow better toward the middle. Yet, like ""Batman Begins"" and pretty much every other Hollywood superhero movie, you have to wait for Bruce Wayne to rise to the occasion as he battles with demons and sits in a hole for most of the movie. I'm starting to think that this is a superhero movie tactic to save money on budget costs and shoot just enough action to make a great trailer and get money carrying patrons fired up.

As a Batman fan, I'm not sure if I'm disappointed that I know that there is no more future to Nolan's Batman universe, or if the final trip there was less than I expected and I'M GLAD IT'S OVER. ""Dark Knight"" managed to be Dark and fun, ""Dark Knight Rises"", did not. We waited for most of the movie in ""Dark Knight Begins"" to get a taste of Batman and you get to do that again for the grand finale. For a Batman trilogy finale, I wanted Batman and he sat in a hole. ""Dark Knight Rises"" leaves you unsatisfied in more ways than one.",1343001600,10,3216,4.434856175972927
4428169,5,B004LWZWGK,"A perfect fit alongside Christopher Nolan's preceding Batman films, with no single chapter standing clearly above the others. Where The Dark Knight played up the conundrum of Bruce Wayne as a public mask for Batman, this installment flips the script and focuses more intently on a well-rounded civilian identity at the expense of Wayne's more notorious alter-ego. That shifted focus fits snugly alongside the presence of a more grounded, topical-tinged foil in Bane, whose grand plans aren't all that different from those of his two predecessors, but reverberate in the modern social atmosphere. The strict black-and-white nature of the very real debate at the core of Bane's scheme is my sole disappointment, really, as the shades of gray I so appreciated in the first two episodes have been subtly brushed aside. Tom Hardy performs admirably in full pantomime as the big bad, with Anne Hathaway playing a fine Catwoman (though the role seems inessential for the majority of the film), but it's Michael Caine who steals the show in a very brief, emotional final turn as Wayne's infamous butler Alfred. Although he enjoys only five minutes of screen time, when the curtain falls it's his vivid performance you'll most remember. A brilliant, daring, explosive climax that expertly puts the lid on one of modern film's finest action/adventure trilogies, it surprised and impressed me from the very first word.",1343001600,2,1407,5.175438596491228
4428170,4,B004LWZWGK,"The level of anticipation and hope surrounding this movie has been beyond the pale. Already, backlash against negative reviews from fans who haven't even seen it has caused major changes over at Rotten Tomatoes, and by now everyone's heard of the horrific events at Colorado. Even in Seoul, I witnessed yelling fights, crying, and at least one person telling his friends, in all seriousness, that he didn't want to hear anymore joking about the film since ""this was something they should take seriously.""

The story of Batman is one that lends itself to grimness, that much is true, and this latest installment is no exception. In fact, it is arguably the darkest of the trilogy, all of Batman's ""rising"" notwithstanding. The film picks up eight years after the second. Batman hasn't been seen since the death of Harvey Dent, both Bruce Wayne and his businesses are noticeably crippled, and although Gotham City seems to be experiencing a (relatively) strong era of peace, it is based on a lie that Commissioner Gordon can barely bring himself to tell over and over again at public functions.

Enter: Bane, a beefed up anarchist with an intelligence that's probably on par with his max bench press. Bane's troubling influence begins causing serious challenges that Bruce Wayne feels compelled to rise to meet, and along the way he encounters some of the same old faces (Fox and Alfred), as well as a few new ones (a brash young cop named Blake, an equally brash & young cat burglar named Selina, and a beautiful energy investor named Miranda). Our hero doesn't rise as smoothly as one might hope, though. His corporate enterprise is on the verge of collapse, and he must contend not only with Bane but also with a public that has long-since scapegoated him. He's beset on all sides, and the clashes -- emotional, spiritual, financial, and physical -- begin to overlap in a slapdash, nearly exhausting way. Viewers hoping that the movie will provide a sort of moral rifle scope will be disappointed, and why not? When a building collapses, it is impossible to trace the path of every crack that appears in its foundation, and when the movie hits its grim, second act finale, the only thing that's really clear is that things are about as bad as they can possibly get.

There's no sense in giving away where things go from there, although I will say that the movie starts to hone back in on what really gives the Batman ethos most of its juice: the conflict you get when revenge pretends to be justice, when a would-be-noble-savior finds his greatest motivation out of hate and fear, and whether or not a world is worth saving when it seems perfectly willing to sacrifice itself for a present and momentary safety. In spite of the film's sprawling script and wild-n-wooly plotting, the end result is crisp, clever, and satisfying (without succumbing too much to the Traditional Happy Ending).

It's too bad, however, that so much is lost in translation. Give the film a good post-viewing musing (or watch it a second and third time), and serious flaws can be seen in quite a few places, most notably Bane and his story arc. I've since had Batman-philes tell me that all of these supposed plot holes are ably explained by the comic books, but people have got to start realizing that adaptations of books are not supplements to those books. They are (or should be) self-contained. If I have to go read a book just to understand that book's movie, then the movie has failed. Likewise, there are some serious fudges in a few of the film's timelines (let's just say that, on more than one occasion, the film pretends like some things -- even small things, like landing/boarding/taking off in a plane -- take far less time than they really do).

Ultimately, the film suffers (if not mildly) from a common Third Movie Flaw, which is the attempt to spread the audience's sympathies over far too many characters. Instead of providing rich and compelling conclusions to the tales of two or three people, we are asked to empathize with something like over half a dozen completely different people. There's just not enough butter for the size of the bread that this film holds out, and as a result, the movie lingers on people you don't care about (Modine's Police Chief Foley) and gives unforgivably short shrift to major names (Bane's story is dismissed so cavalierly that it plays like visual whiplash).

Overall, I would call it a satisfying film, but its own pomp is meant to inflate too much more than it should (this is even evident in the Hans Zimmer score, which is so over-the-top in places that it seems to be mocking the emotions that it is meant to impel). No doubt many will find it a bit sloppy and hard to follow, and others might feel like, in spite of its 150 minute run time, the movie is oddly insubstantial. Then again, maybe Nolan was just trying to put as much in as he could for his coup de grace, and I don't fault him for that. The end result is certainly worthy of its placement in the Nolan/Batman oeuvre, even if it feels like Batman only rises long enough to have time to wave goodbye.",1343001600,2,5101,4.681159420289855

The more extremist cross-section of fans view co-writer/director Christopher Nolan's BATMAN films as ""too real"" and ""too boring"". Some of the critics reviewing this film feel this film, THE DARK KNIGHT RISES which is Nolan's finale to his epic DARK KNIGHT trilogy, is ""too unrealistic"" or ""too cartoony"" because of his brilliant and more realistic takes on the Batman mythology in the two previous films BATMAN BEGINS and THE DARK KNIGHT. Basically, everybody wants their cake and eat it too with these films. However, if you truly look at this film for what it is and not what you think it should be or what you want it to be, THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is still an excellent film and a perfect cap on the end of Nolan's BATMAN trilogy. It's also worth knowing that as you read this review, you will probably notice that I am something of a fan of Batman, not only these films, but the comics as well.

The film opens with almost a similar epilogue to THE DARK KNIGHT, with Commisioner Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) espousing the virtues of Harvey Dent, who tragically had succumbed to grief and madness by the end of THE DARK KNIGHT and the murders he committed while in that state were covered up by Gordon and Batman (Christian Bale) in order to make sure that Harvey's reputation remained as pure as he was believed to be. This opening begins just one of the themes that this film will deal with throughout. Once that opening ends, we find that it has been eight years since the events of THE DARK KNIGHT. Bruce Wayne, devastated by the death of his life-long love Rachel Dawes and hunted by the Gotham Police since he (as Batman) took the fall for the murders Harvey committed as well as Harvey's death, has become a recluse and is no longer Batman. Gotham is apparently cleaner than ever because of the systematic removal of organized crime and imprisonment of over a thousand offenders due to a municipal law called The Dent Act. There is still discontent amongst the populace and that is represented partially in the daring and sultry cat burglar Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway). She represents some of the downtrodden of Gotham who feel that people like Wayne have far too much when so many more have so little. It is also represented in Officer John Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), an idealistic young police officer and an orphan like Wayne himself who sees behind the veil of lies perpetrated by Gordon, but with a different perspective than one might originally think. And most surprisingly, it is represented in Alfred (Michael Caine), who has been Bruce's most loyal confidante over the years as well as his father figure who sees no future for Bruce as Batman other than death. Unfortunately for everyone involved, a new villain comes to town in the form of Bane (Tom Hardy), a masked steel-eyed hulking predator with a mind for war and a desire for destruction. Wayne, finding some new purpose not only due to a specific crime perpetrated by Kyle (who, while costumed similarly to the comic character of Catwoman, is never referred to as such in this film) but also in the form of Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard), a woman who represents hope for Gotham in the assistance of funding a fusion-powered renewable energy prototype and also as a potential love interest, once again dons the cape and cowl to fight the chaos that Bane seems to be trying to bring to Gotham. In a brutal fight between the two, Batman comes out very badly on the losing side and is cast out of Gotham into an underground prison in a distant land; the very prison Bane was born into, as we find ties into BATMAN BEGINS with the more we learn of our new villain and how he knows Batman's true identity. Upon returning to Gotham, Bane begins his ""liberation"" of Gotham as we see a terrifying display of city-wide destruction that separates Gotham from the rest of the world and the same device Wayne Industries planned for Gotham's salvation has been retro-fitted for its destruction. Meanwhile, Bruce has to watch as Bane holds kangaroo courts for Gotham's priviledged and its protectors which ultimately leads to execution or exile across its frozen river, and as he watches, he begins to feel the fire rising within himself once again as Gotham's race against time is coming to a close.

It's obvious that Nolan (and his co-writer brother Jonathan) found inspiration in two, maybe three very important works of the Batman comic mythology; the most obvious being KNIGHTFALL, which was when we first were introduced to Bane and his epic battle with Batman; also NO MAN'S LAND, where Gotham has been deemed an isolated island city-state of sorts; and somewhat with Ed Brubaker and Darwyn Cooke's reinvigorating of CATWOMAN, where she was still a femme fatale jewel thief, but also was a guardian for those that were considered expendable by Gotham society. All of these elements are on display here, and done in a far superior and more emotionally-charged way than what was in the comics (perhaps with the exception of the Brubaker/Cooke work on CATWOMAN, which was brilliant).

I have to admit, despite the brilliant, genre-defining work Nolan had done previously with Batman, I was a little less than enthused to see Bane as the villain of the film when it was announced. He was someone I felt originally that was a bit of a one-trick pony; a new character created solely for the purpose of upsetting the status quo. As years went by, Bane had been given more of a back-story with more motivation and some of that characterization is brought to vivid life here by Nolan's storytelling and Tom Hardy's hypnotic performance. Bane's face is covered by that strange but purposeful mask during almost the entire film, but Hardy, having done incredibly charismatic and brutal work previously in films like BRONSON, INCEPTION and WARRIOR, brings a swagger, attitude and cruelty to Bane simply through his eyes and his body language. The addition of Selina Kyle to Nolan's universe also seemed equally fitting as someone who always SEEMS to be looking out for Number One, but ends up as having something of the proverbial heart of gold. Hathaway, who has been impressing since her work in more dramatic work in films like BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN and RACHEL GETTING MARRIED but has been primarily a staple of rom-com work with films like LOVE AND OTHER DRUGS, THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA and BRIDE WARS, is on equal footing with the rest of the cast here. She brings a necessary dynamic with Batman/Bruce Wayne and moments of brightness and humor in this almost unrelentingly bleak film, but don't expect purring. Gordon-Levitt continues his run of tremendous performances he's been turning in since his revelatory performance in BRICK through THE LOOKOUT, (500) DAYS OF SUMMER, INCEPTION and 50/50, proving that he is rapidly becoming one of the great actors of his generation. Other Bat-verse newcomer Marion Cotillard sadly doesn't have as much to do here as an actress of her caliber should, at least not until the third act. It does seem like while Nolan was doing INCEPTION, he just asked if a lot of his actors would be willing to make this film too; hence Hardy, Gordon-Levitt, and Cotillard.

As far as the returning actors are concerned, Oldman continues to redefine his place in these films. He is, at least in part, the conscience of Batman, but in this film, there's a very deep weariness he evokes because he's partially corrupted himself in order to serve ""the greater good"". Morgan Freeman returns as Lucius Fox, and has some strong moments, but there's not many moments here for him to sink his teeth into. Caine rounds out this trinity of Bruce Wayne/Batman's most trusted friends, and gives a more raw and emotional Alfred than we've seen in the past. He is much less the wisecracking and wisened Merlin to Bruce's King Arthur, but is the voice of regret. He doesn't see Batman as a failure, but he loves Bruce too much to let him continue on with that life. But the film ultimately belongs to Bale. This is the most emotional and most complex Bruce Wayne/Batman we've seen yet, and he brings him to very vivid life in this film. At the film's opening, he's bearded and gaunt-looking. He's become so much more damaged from the result of the last film that he feels he's lost everyone he loves and believes could give him a normal life. As stated in THE DARK KNIGHT, he doesn't want to be Batman for his whole life, but for better or worse, it's part of who he is.

The film as a whole is a tremendous achievement thematically, dealing with a lot of things you don't see in a big-budget summer release: things like economic disparity (keep in mind, though; this film was in production before the whole ""Occupy"" movement began, but because of the economic crises in Europe and the U.S., it was definitely something worth approaching) the corrosive nature of the truth and the fall of a city from without and within.

The film is also, and not unusual to expect of Nolan, a technical marvel. From the incredible skyjack opening sequence to the city beneath Gotham to the hellish decimation of the city to the desolation that follows and pretty much every frame of the third act, it's all incredible to watch and breath-taking to behold. The action to this film is also far more visceral than anything that the Batman films have presented in the past. In the two major confrontations of the film between Batman and Bane, every blow is felt (some much more so than others), and the fight choreography is more of a street brawl rather than a MATRIX-esque gravity-defiant martial arts melee, but there is one scene with Batman and Catwoman taking on a gang of thugs that is much more graceful in its choreography. The effects work is particularly effective on the practical side of things. Very few moments feel like they needed to be CG'd, but the moments of the destruction of the football field and surrounding areas, and all the sequences involving The Bat, an airborne version of the Tumbler, are pure gold.

But there are problems too. The first significant problem is us as the audience and Nolan as the director of a Batman film post-THE DARK KNIGHT, which I firmly believe is the best film of the last decade. I saw the entire marathon showing at a local theater and found how amazingly simple it was to sit through THE DARK KNIGHT after seeing it a few times in the theater before and countless times on Blu-Ray and TV. We have the expectation of seeing something better than THE DARK KNIGHT and it simply isn't going to happen. Just as we hoped each subsequent film in every popular trilogy or series of films would improve (of which there are several examples in genre filmmaking), it rarely ever happens. You will never get another Heath Ledger as The Joker. We expect more than we get, and that's on us too. Another problem is that there is a LOT of story here. You have several different tales being told with several different characters and several different themes, and certain sacrifices are made in order to tell those stories, usually at the cost of character and honest dialogue. There are times where it does feel that there's almost too much story for just one film...

...but I can't truly fault a film for being TOO ambitious when there are so many films out there that are just floating along with just the ambition to make good money. Nolan fills the screen to a point that is evocative of a film of the silent era. There very rarely even needs to be dialogue; you can tell so easily what's going on just by looking and watching and that's a huge testament to Nolan's abilities as a storyteller and the actors and how superbly they play their roles. But if this were a silent film, you might miss out on the dangerously percussive score by Hans Zimmer, who is sadly without his former Bat-film musical collaborator James Newton-Howard, but there's still everything you need from this films' score and more. It's not nearly as quiet and unnerving as the score for THE DARK KNIGHT, but this is a film of a much grander scale. And that brings us to the word for this film: EPIC. The Dark Knight Trilogy has been an epic of storytelling; It gives us the beginning, middle, and end (?) of the tale of The Batman, and all of the films reflect the character at moments in his life that are natural in this cinematic universe Nolan has created. And as with any three-act structured story, it's only logical that the third act be the climax of the tale, and THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is that climax. It's bigger than either of the previous films, it has a wider scope on screen and in storytelling, it's more exciting and there's much more at stake here. This is a finale of a trilogy, and anything goes. Lives will be very possibly be lost. Even the hero of our trilogy isn't safe, and that makes the stakes higher than the previous films; Nolan is a smart enough filmmaker to make you afraid of the ending.

And yes, the final act of this film more closely resembles something out of a Batman comic book than just about any moment of any of the previous films. It is no-holds-barred. Nuclear annihilation is imminient. The entirety of Gotham is trapped on its island. Only a few stand between Bane and the total obliteration of Gotham City. Who will live? Who will die? And most importantly, will I as an audience member leave the theater satisfied that this epic has come to a conclusion?

Now be warned: This is not THE AVENGERS. The levels of sheer glee that you may have felt during that film will not be omnipresent in this film, but there will be moments that you will want to stand up and cheer. And there will be moments that will devastate you.

After waxing linguistical about this film, these three points are ultimately all you need to know:

A: THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is very much a Christopher Nolan Batman film.

B: THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is THE finale to Christopher Nolan's Batman films.

C: THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is the perhaps greatest final chapter in a trilogy of films ever.",1342915200,10,14093,4.672844480257856
4428172,5,B004LWZWGK,"I am blown away by what I just saw. Christopher Nolan concludes the trilogy with perfect thoroughness and yet makes you think at what you had just seen after you've left the theater. Nolan throws curve balls galore throughout this film, and I actually gasped in awe and excitement at a few particular moments that would be blasphemy if I told you.

Taking place 8 years since the events in ""The Dark Knight."" Bruce Wayne(Christian Bale)is a broken recluse, taken care of by maids and hobbling along on his cane, he has put the Batman behind. Until Bane arrives(Tom Hardy),with an army and as the current leader of ""The League Of Shadows"" to finish what Ra's Al Ghul(Liam Neeson)failed to do in ""Batman Begins.""
Bane is a monstrous brute, a man born in the darkness and destined to burn Gotham to the ground, releasing all criminals from Blackgate Prison and trapping the city's police force underground. But where is Batman?
After an epic battle between Batman and Bane, Bruce ends up defeated and placed in the bowels of a Ukrainian underground prison, body broken, while Gotham citizens are unprotected by the anarchy and under the watch of Bane.

Will Bruce ""rise"" one last time, and will ""Catwoman""(Anne Hathoway)quit her clepto ways and help Batman? And who is this Lt. Blake(Joseph-Gordan Levitt)and why does he know Bruce so well?

Solid performances from everyone, and surprisingly Tom Hardy himself, who played Bane. His face is never seen, but his eyes and menacing tone made me shiver. The new ""Bat"" toy is pretty damn sweet. Of course Anne looked stunning as Catwoman, but I wish she had more screen time.

As always, Nolan doesn't just make superhero action movies, he makes films. Lots of emotion in this film, which even had, IMO, an ""Inception"" like ending, making you wonder, Is that? That's Not? Could it be?  And that is the splendor of a Nolan film. Easily the best superhero movie ever, which was ""The Avengers"" until now.
Nathan Cranes(Cillian Murphy) appearance as a judge of the citizens was a perfect addition to the insanity of the character and the situation. Very humorous and dark, it reminded me of Frank Millers Batman.

And thank you Christopher Nolan and everyone involved in the making of the greatest hero trilogy of all time. This is the way Batman is done, DARK, AWESOME, and EPIC. No need EVER for a reboot.",1342915200,3,2345,4.792079207920792
4428173,2,B004LWZWGK,"Let's start with the only big positive from this movie - Ann Hathaway as Selina Kyle (the name of Catwoman never appears in the movie) was just terrific - lithe, athletic, slinky, sexy, cool, empowered, and better at fighting than Batman.  She's probably the best and most dynamic Catwoman ever, displacing Michelle Pfeiffer's more neurotic version from first place at last.

And she is the only reason not to give this movie zero stars.

Some terrific actors are in this movie, which drags back characters from the previous two movies, either freshly on camera or in photos or flashbacks (e.g., Liam Neeson as Ra's al Ghul, Cillian Murphy as Dr. Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow).  Curious, only Heath Ledger's Joker did not re-appear in any form or even in a brief mention.

Unfortunately most of the characters get wasted in this tedious, overly long and complicated plot which absolutely makes no sense at all.

Yes, I like plot and logical character development and there was none of that here in this movie.

****SPOILERS*****

Worst of all, for an action movie, the action scenes were poorly done.  OK, the opening sequence with the air to air hijacking was mildly interesting, but I got distracted because during the scene I kept wondering, hey why is that agent torturing the prisoners to find out which one of them is Bane, when one of the prisoners with a hood on turns out to be Bane, mask and all?  Presumably his captors saw him that way BEFORE THEY PUT THE HOOD ON.  And Bane is massively bigger than anybody else, so it's not like he's hard to pick out from a crowd, right?

Lots of gigantic plot holes like that in this movie.

Two really cheesy fight scenes - one where Batman flies in with his Batplane, shoots off the cannon of one of the stolen Batmobiles, and then GETS OUT OF THE BATPLANE to fight Bane mano a mano.  Huh?  Why not just stay in the Batplane and mow him down?

And then the charge of the blue brigade fight at the end - ahem - one does not charge en mass down a street packed shoulder to shoulder when your opponents have automatic AK-47s and you are armed only with pistols.  Human wave attacks against machine guns went out of fashion in the Western world at the Somme, 96 years ago.  Even more stupifying, the crooks armed with automatic weapons don't just take cover and mow down the charging cops, THEY STOP FIRING AND CHARGE OUT TO FIGHT HAND-TO-HAND WITH THE COPS.

A seriously cheesy CGI moment in this film - I wish filmmakers could figure out how to do a nuclear blast properly.  Try doing some research for starters.  There are archival films of scores of nuclear explosions over water that are more terrifying than the one in this movie, which looked like it was part of a beginner art student's matte painting of a stereotypical mushroom cloud.

Alfred is reduced to a blubbering nag, Commissioner Gordon is reduced to fumbling and stumbling around, and the two main new characters introduced - Joseph Gorden-Levitt and Marion Cotillard undergo way too many plot twists that again leave me asking, Huh?

Bruce Wayne's story arc here in this movie is just a total mess.  Can you spell Deus ex machina?  Miraculous to have somebody paraplegic from massive spine trauma suddenly get up and start walking, much less regain full form fighting skills.

And Bane, poor Tom Hardy - did he really bulk himself up with 40 pound of muscle only to show this muscle in just a few seconds of film footage?  The rest of the time, Bane could have been played by an extra like David Prowse, behind that mask and that bulky clothing, and nobody would have been wiser.  What a waste of talent and muscle.  Bane's story arc needless to say is also all twisty and barely makes sense.  And his ending ... wow, the very definition of anti-climax ....

One of the final scenes, with Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle at a cafe in France, now that was touching, and reflected well the sexual tension between the two that flashed only occasionally in this movie.

Too bad, this could have been a terrific movie if it had just focused more on those two.",1342915200,18,4063,4.6

4428175,5,B004LWZWGK,"SPOILER....

I saw the movie in IMAX opening night in Hawaii and it was incredible.

The plot was decent: the story begins 8 years after the Dark Knight ended. Commissioner James Gordon has cleaned up the streets but framed Batman for the murder of Harvey Dent. Bruce Wayne/Batman went into hiding in Wayne Manor and becomes a recluse. Selina Kyle/Catwoman robs his safe- steals his mother's pearls and he chases after her. Anne Hathaway's portrayal of Catwoman was more believable than Michelle Pfeiffer and Halle Berry's portrayals in Batman Returns and Catwoman. Selina Kyle winds up working with Bane (the new villain in Gotham City) and lures Batman into a trap. Bane beats the crap out of Batman and breaks the ""hero"". Of course, Batman has to have a girlfriend, none other than what turns out to be a new bad guy, Miranda, who takes over Wayne Enterprises and turns the nuclear reactor supposed to provide clean energy to the world, into a nuclear bomb. Fight scenes later and dramatic interludes lead to the conclusion, which was open-ended. At least this trilogy didn't end the way the writers of LOST decided to end their series- lame.

Chris Nolan is at his best with this one. The story makes sense for a simple girl such as myself (having never read a single Batman series comic book) to understand. Also entertaining. Bane made sense in this story, unlike in Batman Forever. What the f was that?! At least in this version, Bane wears the mask because his face was torn apart trying to save Miranda. A morphine addict in incredible pain- makes sense to need the respirator that makes him sound like Sean Connery when he speaks, but still eerie.",1342915200,2,1657,4.746527777777778
4428176,5,B004LWZWGK,"Let's get the elephant in the room out of the way first: Heath Ledger's The Joker is a hard act to follow. Impossible, some might even say. Wisely The Dark Knight Rises doesn't try to outdo itself by bringing in a bigger and more colorful villain, for if it had that inevitably would have took it down the road of self-parody (Batman Forever, Batman and Robin anyone?). Nor does it sacrifice character in its rush to get to the next big action set-piece, the Hollywood thinking being that what audiences want from their summer blockbusters is lots of bang for their buck; after all Spider-Man 3 gave us that, and look how well that turned out.

Make no mistake though, the scale of The Dark Knight Rises is huge: the plane hijack at the beginning, Batman's first appearance on the streets of Gotham after eight years sees him being chased by what looks like ever cop car in the city. How the film's villain, Bane, spectacularly cuts off Gotham from the outside world and traps all of its cops at the same time. Gotham's finest in blue charging Gotham's scum-of-the-earth for a Gangs of New York-style street rumble.

But is all stays grounded, helped in no small part by the fact that Batman is one of comic's and cinema's most accessible superheroes, because he isn't a superhero; at least not in the sense that he has supernatural powers. I pointed this out to my brother when he saw Watchman and he said, ""But there aren't any superheroes in the movie, apart from Doctor Manhattan. The rest as just vigilantes."" ""Yeah,"" I said, ""but so is Batman."" You could see him thinking about it, and then the realisation dawning. Oh, Bruce Wayne's got lots of fancy James Bond-style toys to help him out, but in the end he's just a guy in a Halloween costume beating up the bad guys.

Which leads me to one of the best sequences in The Dark Knight Rises - Bane and Batman's first fight. Other movie maker's might have gone down the road of staging some big, dump wow encounter, but Christopher Nolan brings it all down to gut level. No music. A strip of metal walkway. And two guys just slugging it out with their bare hands. Or Batman's slugging it out and Bane, for the most part, is allowing him to go at it... and thus clearly sending a message: is that it? Is that all you've got vigilante boy? An expensive costume and some boxing moves? And that's when the audience realises that Batman truly has met his match, and Christopher Nolan didn't need to bring on a big and colourful villain in order to do it: all he had to do was introduce Batman to an essentially ordinary man, but a guy who's just as determined and single-minded in achieving what he feels he has to do as Bruce Wayne is.

And what else the movie brilliantly achieves is neatly tying its storyline into the previous two movies, to form a true unified three-part story. In fact, I would say the story development is The Dark Knight Rises' greatest achievement, in terms of how it not only shows the fallout of Harvey Dent's death but deftly weaves back on itself to echo scenes and dialogue from the previous two movies (James Gordon placing his jacket around a young Bruce Wayne's shoulders, the excellent scenes of a fallen Batman in an underground prison where the only escape route is a wide shaft leading to the hope of daylight, like the well Bruce fell down as a child ... ""Why do we fall, Bruce?...""), to bringing in the League of Shadows and Ra's al Ghul. All of which culminates in the movie's brilliant sting in its tail when you discover that Bane isn't really who Batman is up against. And whilst with seeming effortlessness it does all that the movie also manages to bring in Catwoman (although she's never referred to by that name) and pair her with Batman in such a way that not only does it feel natural, but also never makes the character feel like a sidekick. At one point Batman opines to Selina Kyle/Catwoman that she's got more to give, and that's the way I've always felt about Anne Hathaway, that she's not just a chic-flick actress (as her role in Rachel Getting Married showed). She's superb as Selina Kyle/Catwoman.

Anne Hathaway's character doesn't distract or steal the show. Indeed no one does, which is another plus in the movie's favour: all the characters contribute equally, all of them serve the story. As I've said, the movie doesn't lack for big action moments, but nor does it lack for emotional moments either. In this sense Alfred, terrifically played by Michael Caine, in many ways embodies the heart of the movie. The moment he tells Bruce that he didn't want him to come back to Gotham, that what he wanted was to go on his annual trip abroad and to sit at a table with a drink and to look up... and see Bruce sitting a few tables away, with a wife and perhaps a kid and to smile and to know that Bruce Wayne had moved on. Or the moment Alfred tells Bruce about Rachel's letter. There are just enough of these moments between various characters to not only pace the movie between its action sequences but to give it emotional weight.

Simply put, Christopher Nolan is the best thing to ever happen to the summer blockbuster. Like film critic Mark Kermode pointed out in his superb book `The Good, the Bad and the Multiplex: What's wrong with Modern Movies?' summer blockbusters don't have to be big and dump like a Michael Bay Transformers movie, they can be big and smart and still be hugely successful at the box office, as both The Dark Knight and Inception proved.

We all know this isn't the end: Batman is too lucrative a franchise for Warner Bros. to abandon... although pity the poor sod who's eventually tasked with a reboot after Christopher Nolan's trilogy! (And, hey, how amazing would it be if years hence Nolan and the gang got back together and did an adaptation of Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns? ... now THAT would be the ultimate summer blockbuster!) But for the moment -

The legend ends -

- and the quality of the summer blockbuster rises (well, at least until Michael Bay comes along with another Transformers movie and promptly flattens it again!).",1342915200,6,6086,4.555758683729433
4428177,5,B004LWZWGK,"Superb storytelling, intense percussive music by Zimmer along with steller performances by Hardy, Gordon-Levitt and Hathaway lead the film to conclude the darkest and most distinct Batman trilogy on a fantastic note.",1342915200,,216,5.78125
4428178,4,B004LWZWGK,"Well, here's what I'm going to say at the outset: this isn't a perfect film. It has a few flaws and a few plot elements that don't make much sense. But while it isn't a perfect film, it is, in fact, a perfect ending to the Chris Nolan Batman film series.

The movie also does an excellent job of avoiding the three film problem that many super-hero film series seem to have. I'm thinking of works of ""art"" like X-Men 3, Superman III, Spider-Man 3 and, of course, Batman Forever.

The movie shows us a version of Bruce Wayne who has holed up in his mansion, unseen by the public. Life in Gotham has moved on, and Harvey Dent is held up as a paragon of virtue to the people of Gotham (something that greatly troubles Commissioner Gordon). Aside from a cat burglar named Selina Kyle, all appears to be reasonably well.

And then Bane arrives.

What to say about Bane? His master plan is...well, something I can't reveal here, as it would really spoil things. It makes sense for him, his past and his character, at least as established in the movie. What follows once his plan starts is a series of crushing defeats for Batman, the city of Gotham under siege and a great many twists and turns that I didn't even remotely expect. I also didn't expect that the movie is really more of a sequel to Batman Begins than to The Dark Knight.

Tom Hardy gives an excellent performance as the man with the plan. Also excellent are the returning cast of Christian Bale, Michael Cain and Morgan Freeman, as well as newcomers to the series Joseph Gordon-Leavitt and Marion Cotillard. Nolan does his usual excellent job as a director, and despite some minor plot holes, I really did enjoy this film. I wish that I had more to say about it, but it's hard to do so without venturing into spoiler territory. So I will simply say that if you liked the previous movies, you'll probably like this one, and if you didn't, you're not really in the target audience anyhow.",1342828800,3,1945,4.452247191011236

You felt real horrow when he spoke, when his plans come to fluition, and when he gives you his eyes. Ann Hathaway played Catman flawlessly and stole the show in her scenes.

4428180,5,B004LWZWGK,"I intend here to delve into the film and discuss it on more than a superficial level. While I want to respect that many may not have seen it yet, and won't reveal what I deem to be major spoilers regarding the much discussed fate of Batman, my goal here is to discuss it on a level that will inevitably cause spoilers pertaining to the film and even its third act revelations (at least if you haven't read the comics), so be forewarned and avoid this review if you must. For those who have seen the film and may have come to this page, like myself, wondering what others thought, please read on and let me know your thoughts in the comments section.

I have now seen the film three times, once in the Dark Knight Marathon after having viewed Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. The Second time was after having had some time to reflect upon the first viewing. Before the third time I went back and watched Begins and Dark Knight once again to see what weight they may have gained with knowledge of how the trilogy now ends. SO now to the review of Rises... which begins with how it fits into the overall trilogy.

The Dark Knight Rises is a genius film in that it not only completes a trilogy it gives the previous two films greater meaning and provides characters and scenes in the earlier films with even more depth and levels. The plot goes back and provides new context that adds enjoyment and helps the trilogy feel more cohesive. This is especially true regarding Batman Begins, specifically  a scene that occurs at about the twenty minute mark of that film. Ra's Al Ghul is expanded upon and his discussion of his lost love now carries heavier emotional impact. Also, a revelation about what Alfred was up to during Bruce's early travels around the world before becoming Batman also helps add more emotion and new meaning to Alfred's conversations with Bruce throughout the first third of Begins, and even to conversations they share in Dark Knight. It is amazing that Nolan grew as a filmmaker during the trilogy and crafted a final film that rose above where he began, but even more amazing that he took the time to craft a finale that makes the entire trilogy stronger, especially the first installment. Scenes that were clearly crafted on their own initially now seem like they were crafted with this final installment and the trilogy as a whole in mind.

The Dark Knight, especially its final scenes with Two-face, Gordon and Batman are given a greater weight because Rises shows us the results of their decisions and gives us deeper understanding of what Gordon was thinking during those moments. What the film relies on from the Dark Knight, aside from Batman taking the fall for Harvey Dent, is the grittiness based in our reality. Begins had elements of this but Dark Knight pushed the parallels between Gotham and our world even further. Heavier real world issues were seeded throughout that film and that continues perfectly and seemlessly in Rises (financial strife, terrorism, disillusionment with social structures, etc.). The sheer ferocity and insanity of Bane is clearly only made possible by the astounding portrayal of the Joker. The fight, shown in many trailers, where Bane first fights Batman in the sewers is frighteningly real and has been primed by the realistic hostage tapes and menace produced by the Joker. Dark Knight clearly prepared us for Dark Knight Rises, but oddly the film seems to relate more strongly back to Batman Begins in that it provides a more emotional connection. Overall though the trilogy as a whole feels completed by this entry, and though Dark Knight will always stand out as the most provocative (it was so unexpected and something we were so unaccustomed to), in an entirely different sense Rises also stands out as something unique and compelling.

How does Rises stand as a film on its own? Most people seem to be speaking in favor of it. I obviously agree with them. A few people have expressed not enjoying it and have been received very poorly for doing so, I just want to say regarding that, let's respect that each individual is entitled to their opinion. I can actually appreciate their stance as my first viewing was more of an enjoyment and my love and admiration for the film only came through repeated viewings I had planned ahead of my first viewing, despite the dismay it caused my wallet. Dark Knight Rises has many levels when paired up with the previous two movies, but it also has many levels contained within itself. There was a lot to take in and I admittedly had to process it and put it into the proper intended context. There are a slew of new characters, there are huge time jumps, there is not a great deal of time devoted to characters we already know and there are several plot revelations saved for the third act.

Ultimately the thing to keep in mind when watching Rises is 'A Tale of Two Cities'. The story begins here and it really is the best of times, it really is the worst of times. The entire film is based strongly on themes found notably in the classic Dickens tale. Nolan's love for the motif of doubles/dualities throughout the franchise never plays more strongly than it does here. For example, Bane breaks Batman after a crushing blow to the forehead of his mask. Batman later deals crushing blows to Bane by wailing on his mask. Both men only became known for putting on masks. Gordon is a jaded cop who got his hands dirty, Blake is an idealistic squeaky clean cop, Miranda Tate and Selina Kyle also play opposites in their positions relating to Bruce Wayne. Even the film's ending has a quote from Dicken's classic and I think it speaks volumes not only regarding the themes of the film but to the ending and the dualities I believe to be found in it. It is this kind of writing, courtesy of the Nolans and Goyer, that I believe finds the film ""being received... ...in the superlative degree of comparison only"".

The obvious things are all done with the craft and capability one expects from Nolan's team. The directing is great in that is follows traditional patterns but breaks them at key moments for planned effect (the dropping out of any score during a Batman and Bane brawl makes the hits that much more painful for example). The music plays with themes from the previous films but Zimmer pushes it to a wonderfully operatic crescendo here. The acting is the best of any summer blockbuster (Freeman, Oldman and Caine deliver as alwas) and Bale seems most markedly improved (he's given arguably heavier material to work with here than in Dark Knight and has notably won an Oscar since then). All the newcomers (Hardy, Cotilliard, JGL and Hathaway) fit into the series better than anyone portraying Rachel Dawes ever did (sorry but I couldn't believe Holmes or Gyllenhaal in Nolan's universe). The writing is, as noted above, layered and well done if not slightly compacted due to so much happening.

Some weaknesses, a proper review should discuss the good and the bad and the film does have some issues, at least for me. The villains (Bane and [as most fans guessed early on] Talia) were well crafted by the writers and actors, but their final scenes felt somewhat anti-climatic to me. This may just be due to the fact that they weren't traditional in the Hollywood sense. Bane is sent off ultimately, after an earlier defeat, rather quickly with a joke (though a successful one) made at his expense. Talia makes her exit rather quickly without a direct confrontation and without much of a fight, it is troubling in the sense that she only gets one monologue after her big reveal and then is gone. She is given greater depth by a revelation regarding her childhood but her plan is never really presented in context of her desires other than the classic desire for revenge. She also never seems as strong as her provided origin would have us believe she is. Another annoyance is a character's death by car crash (despite every other character seemingly surviving similar or worse crashes during the trilogy, Joker survived a semi flipping over for example).

Another potential weakness, from my view at least, was that though Gotham was seen falling into despair and decay, there was actually quite little seen of its citizens coping with the horrors inflicted by Bane and the League of Shadows. The majority of the citizens reactions seem to be done in one montage at the beginning of the occupation. Other than their faces during this montage and earlier at the football stadium we are left to guess what life for the everyday citizen in the occupied Gotham is like. That said we do see how the cops and Wayne executives are surviving and a nice reaction shot of Selina Kyle watching the initial looting does provide a great deal of weight and context. Still, seeing more of the everyday men and women trying to cope or survive would have added more weight to Batman's eventual attempts to save them all, it can almost feel like he will only be saving the main characters because few others are seen in the city.

The last big question in my mind, how does everyone seem to know when the bomb will go off? Sure Lucious tells Gordon, Blake and the cops, but Bruce Wayne arrives in Gotham not having spoken to any of them and he already knows when the bomb will go off too. Then Talia always seems to know the exact minute count despite not having even looked at a watch. To a similar but greater point, how does Bruce get back to Gotham, get back into the city when its cordoned off so well and find Selina all luckily on the day before the bomb goes off? Great timing but no indication that he's planned any of it. It's all very coincidental and glossed over, some quick nods to how it all came together would've been appreciated. Further his plan in the finale is still somewhat murky to me, he gathers the police force for the huge wall street battle royale but why didn't he try using The Bat to fly in blasting away and take Bane personally, or using his stealth for that matter, there are many reasons he probably does this (can't take on an entire army at once) but he never explicitly states any and no one questions him.

Debatable weak spots aside, the strongest part of the film overall upon repeat viewings is indeed the ending. What upon initial viewing seems to be a somewhat cathartic and happy ending reveals itself to be a multi-layered and ambiguous one. It is an ending that merits endless deciphering and inspires questioning while provoking thought. I won't put any spoilers in this regard as I don't want to risk anyone accidentally reading it, but I would like to discuss further with any willing participants in the comments or a discussion thread. A crucial scene at the end of the film and a few quick scenes as well as one crucial shot during the final climax all leave room for interpretation to various possible outcomes. Initially I went with the masses and believed Nolan had provided a more traditional and cathartic ending, but upon repeat viewings I think the ending is meant to be ambiguous, just as Inception was. Personally I am drawn to the darker more traditionally Nolan ending. What makes it so genius though is that fans/viewers can seemingly have it either way. Happy ending for all, or a more somber ending with seeds of hope for the future.

That the ending can be interpreted so differently is a testament to the time, effort and genius Nolan and his team put into making this film worthy of the trilogy. I believe it is.

This was not the film that we deserved, but its the one we needed right now. This is a far, far better 'superhero' interpretation than has ever been done. This is a far, far better trilogy than we have ever known. I want to thank you Nolan, even though you'd say we never have to, for producing/creating smart, big budget films that don't condescend to the viewer. Hopefully you've started something...",1342828800,4,11884,4.647954329210276
4428181,5,B004LWZWGK,"""The Dark Knight Rises"" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: It has been eight years since Batman vanished into the night, turning, in that instant, from hero to fugitive. Assuming the blame for the death of D.A. Harvey Dent, the Dark Knight sacrificed everything for what he and Commissioner Gordon both hoped was the greater good. For a time the lie worked, as criminal activity in Gotham City was crushed under the weight of the anti-crime Dent Act.

But everything will change with the arrival of a cunning cat burglar with a mysterious agenda. Far more dangerous, however, is the emergence of Bane, a masked terrorist whose ruthless plans for Gotham drive Bruce out of his self-imposed exile. But even if he dons the cape and cowl again, Batman may be no match for Bane.

The cast led by Christian Bale (as Bruce Wayne / Batman), Michael Caine (as Alfred), Gary Oldman (as Commissioner Jim Gordon), Anne Hathaway (as Selina Kyle / Catwoman), Tom Hardy (as Bane), Marion Cotillard (as Miranda Tate), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (as John Blake) & Morgan Freeman (as Lucius Fox) is brilliant. The directing by Christopher Nolan (who also produced) is brilliant. The story (based on Bob Kane's comic books) by Nolan & David S. Goyer & the screenplay by Nolan & his brother, Jonathan, is brilliant.

The music by Hans Zimmer is brilliant. The cinematography by Wally Pfister is brilliant. The film editing by Lee Smith is brilliant. The casting by John Papsidera is brilliant. The production design by Nathan Crowley & Kevin Kavanaugh is brilliant. The art direction by Toby Britton, Kate Grimble, Zack Grobler, James Hambidge, Naaman Marshall, Jonathan Kevin Ong, Tom Still, Gerald Sullivan, Su Whitaker, Dean Wolcott & Robert Woodruff is brilliant.

The costume design by Lindy Hemming is brilliant. The stunts coordinated by Tom Struthers, Sy Hollands, George Cottle & Monique Allen, fights arranged by Buster Reeves is brilliant. The make-up by Audrey Doyle, Doug Fairall, Jay Wejebe, Maggie Elliott & Conor O'Sullivan is brilliant. The special effects supervised by Chris Corbould & coordinated by Jeff Brink & Scott R.

Franklin, Pete Bebb, Rob Hodgson, Andrew Lockley & coordinated by Beverly Abbott, Katy Mummery, Max Rees, Katie Stetson, Jeff Winkle & Leanne Young is brilliant.

This is a brilliantly well-made finale that is entertaining and well-crafted. This is also an impressive film, visually and thematically. This is just as brilliant as ""Batman Begins"" & ""The Dark Knight"". This is another terrific film from Christopher Nolan.

4428182,5,B004LWZWGK,"What can I say other than The Dark Knight Rises lived up to my expectations and then some. The Christopher Nolan Dark Knight trilogy comes full circle by the end of it and it easily holds up with The Dark Knight, Batman Begins and is more epic in scope than both.

This is Christian Bales best outing as Bruce Wayne/Batman. He just feels more central to the story and he gets to show more of his acting chops here. Anne Hathaway turned in a performance I didn't know she had in her as Catwoman and Tom Hardy was as physically scary as any villain in the series. While Heath's Joker will always be the best in terms of performance, you fear for Batman's life when Bane is around. For the record I understood about 85% of what Bane said, so the rest will have to wait for Blu-ray subtitles. Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine (given the hardest job with some heavy emotional scenes) and a great new addition in Joseph Gordon-Levitt round out another stellar cast.

The fight and action scenes are grounded in reality for the most part and very little CGI is used, which is always a plus.

Hans Zimmer nails another loud and powerful music score.

I saw this in IMAX and it was well worth it. About 40% or so was shot with those really expensive cameras and those scenes are pure eye candy.

More than half of my sold out theater clapped at the end. The Avengers got maybe a dozen or so. I loved both films, but I think only one will last the test of time. I'm sure I'll be seeing TDKR at least one or two more times before it leaves theaters. Thanks Nolan for not letting us down.",1342828800,2,1586,4.308724832214765
4428183,4,B004LWZWGK,"One question remains after viewing the last epic installment of Christopher Nolan's `Dark Knight Trilogy,' `The Dark Knight Rises,' ""What more could we expect?""  Surely the final chapter is as much a visual masterpiece as its predecessors.  The action scenes are ample; the wide angle chases still fill one with vertigo; and in every way the special effects are stunning.  Expect plenty of Oscar nominations (and some wins) for `The Dark Knight Rises' for its technical achievements.

There's no lack of acting ability in the film, either.  Besides old staples like Christian Bale (Batman), Michael Caine (Alfred), Morgan Freeman (Lucius Fox) and Gary Oldman (Commissioner Gordon), there are fresh characters fully fleshed out, especially  Detective Burke, a Harvey Dent successor (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a Bruce Wayne laisson (Marion Cotillard) a chief, new super enemy in Bane (Tom Hardy), and Batman's new frenemy in crime, Cat Woman (Anne Hathaway) stand out especially.  (Note that Gordon-Levitt, Murphy, Hardy, and Cotillard join the talent pool as alumni from `Inception.')

The plot is not simple, but most of the movie surely reflects the themes with a post 9-11, Great Recession resonance.  Newly minted misfit Bane takes over Gotham City--first with a stock exchange takeover and later with a planted neutron bomb.  He looks like a WWF character with a muzzle, and sounds and talks like a second cousin to Darth Vader.  (He even has some dialogue with Batman more than reminiscent of the former trilogy.)  In the background is Bruce Wayne/Batman convalescing over the bruises to his image as well as to his body.  There are many side-plots that crossover, but much of the movie spends time--almost too much--revealing the background, the identity, and the motivations of Bane and several other criminals who have brought new chaos to Gotham.  In the midst of pandemonium, is a vigilante group of law enforcers (or wreckers), including a rogue court held by a self-appointed judge (Cillian Murphy).  One of the movie's problems is it goes from exposition, action, to exposition, action until we get exposition past the first half of the movie, and the movie is not short by any measure.

As a roller-coaster entertainment `The Dark Knight Rises' wins.  It takes the threads of `The Dark Knight' and neatly picks up where it left off.  The points made, the resolution brought does bring closure in a satisfying way.  It keeps to the premise that to build suspense the central hero has to be on the ropes for as long as possible.  The biggest drawback to the finale' is that it takes on too much.  Surely chaos in the real world is complicated--one with many subplots and strings attached--but in a movie, the story needs to be told in a simpler way.  (The first two movies had several plot points, but they were more finely honed.)  While `Batman Begins' hit the refresh button on the franchise, and `The Dark Knight' took comic book movies to heights unseen before or since, the final installment sometimes bites off much more than it can chew.",1342828800,4,3054,5.015873015873016

4428186,2,B004LWZWGK,"DARK KNIGHT RISES REVIEW

This is a good but severely flawed movie and despite all of the negatives I am going to point out, this movie is definitely worth a rental or cable watch and nothing else.

SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!

The first major problem with this movie takes place within the first 45-60 mins.  For the first hour of the movie, the film is just all over the place introducing, reintroducing, and focusing on characters that didn't need to be in the movie (Matthew Modine I'm looking at you).  Even though I feel like some scenes and lines with Catwoman (and her friend) were not needed and they took away from Batman's story, I was able to slightly accept her character sucking away screen time from the main character, Bruce Wayne/Batman.  What I wasn't able to accept was how much screen time and lines the other ""nonessential"" characters took away from Wayne.

Everyone from Joseph Gordon Levitt's character, to Gary Oldman's character, to Matthew Modine's character, all consumed way too much screen time and lines even when Wayne is on screen with them.  There is this one scene where Levitt's character is talking to Wayne about how he met Wayne when he was younger that not only takes up way too much time, but also makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.  Scenes like this are scattered all throughout the first hour of the movie and these scenes take away from what was really interesting which was Bruce Wayne's depression and Alfred's desperate attempt to kick him out of it.  Bruce Wayne's sorrow is so ignored within that first hour that when he eventually decides to start ""rising"" from his slump that you feel like it was rushed.

I feel like this movie is perfect for those suffering from schizophrenia because it is all over the place, especially in the first hour, which then takes away from scenes with Batman that should have been more drawn out, so that you can feel a sense of triumph or relief when Wayne/Batman eventually overcomes everything that is being forced upon him.  Scenes with Wayne/Batman are consistently cut short in this movie to focus on characters that should never have had so many lines and some of these characters shouldn't have even been in the movie.

To get a better understanding of this huge flaw simply think back to the much better previous movies Batman Begins and The Dark Knight.  In Batman Begins Wayne/Batman was the main character and all of the other characters revolved around him and his story line.  In the Dark Knight, Wayne/Batman was one of two main characters, but every other character's story or plotline either revolved around Wayne/Batman, or how Wayne/Batman could come to love, fight, or work with these other characters within his world.  In this movie, The Dark Knight Rises, you get this feeling that every character exists on completely separate plains from each other, minus the Wayne/Alfred relationship, and when these characters do eventually interact with one another, it feels slightly jarring, awkward, and out of place.  Kind of like watching two people on a first date where neither one have anything in common with each other.

The next major problem with this movie involves the main bad guy (Bane) and his motives.  As a comic book fan in my youth, who enjoyed the Bane story both in the comics and even in the animated cartoon from the 90's, I somehow was able to get myself to accept this Mini-Me version of Bane in this movie.  I even liked Bane's voice in this film, and Tom Hardy's interpretation of the character.

The problem with Bane in this movie was his completely unoriginal motives.  Bane basically wants to destroy Gotham City simply because The League of Shadows wanted to.  Bane is metaphorically speaking, a younger, stronger, reincarnated version of Raz Al Ghul from the first Batman Begins movie, hell-bent on destroying Gotham City.  And like Raz Al Ghul from Batman Begins, Bane steals a very high tech weapon/bomb from Wayne Enterprises in order to crush Gotham altogether.  At one point in the movie, Bane even verbally announces that his motives are basically Raz Al Ghul's motives, which means, the screenwriters were completely aware that they were regurgitating an old idea.  I really don't know what is worse, the screenwriters consciously recognizing they are essentially creating the same ""bad guy"" in a different movie, or them subconsciously not realizing they are!?

What makes Bane's plan absolutely nonsensical is the fact that midway through the movie Bane is able to steal the nuclear bomb that will destroy all of Gotham.  Instead though of detonating this bomb once he obtained it, Bane decided to wait a very long period of time just holding on to it while Wayne/Batman was recouping outside of Gotham.  Keep in mind, this movie convinces the viewers that Bane's plan was to destroy Gotham all along, and if that was Bane's plan all along then why did he not detonate the bomb the second he got his hands on it?  Why was detonating the bomb so important and dire when Batman came back to Gotham, but before hand, Bane and his secret partner were very nonchalantly just sitting on a bomb they were going to blow up anyway?

The same writers from the previous Bat films seriously dropped the ball on this one and made the same huge mistake the Spider-Man 3 writers made, by regurgitating ideas from the first film and also by focusing on way too many character plotlines and the feelings and thoughts they possess.  The director and the editing crew also dropped the ball.  Due to their thoughtless approach to this supposed epic finale, The Dark Knight Rises falters on so many occasions that it becomes very hard for me to recommend this movie to anyone even though I was a huge fan of the previous films.  I still recommend a rental for those that want to see how this series ends, but keep in mind, when you watch it, I just briefly touched on some of the flaws with the movie, not all of the flaws, and I can keep going for double the length of this review... Yes, there are that many problems with this movie.",1342828800,19,6044,4.757662835249042
4428187,5,B004LWZWGK,"There may be spoilers...

Spoiler number 1:  Bruce Wayne is Batman.

After Batman's (Christian Bale) exile as a perceived criminal and murderer of Harvey Dent, Gotham City becomes a relatively safe and peaceful city.  Some of the credit goes to the illusion that Dent was a hero whose legacy included a new law which cracks down on organized crime.  Many of the familiar characters return including Gary Oldman as now Commissioner Gordon, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox and Michael Caine as Alfred.  During this tranquil period of time, the city's underground (literally) is teaming with bad guys, led by a raging bull named Bane (a partially masked Tom Hardy).

Bane has captured a device created by billionaire scientist/philantropist/environmentalist Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard) and owned by the Wayne Corporation.  It was developed to help with a cleaner environment but Bruce Wayne mothballed the project as too dangerous given its potential as a nuclear weapon.  Bane provides a demonstration for Gotham's population on a televised football game, showing the device's destructive powers during the game.  Cool CGI which I'm sure most have seen in trailers.

Bruce Wayne has become a recluse given Batman's renegade credentials and the death of Rachel.  After Bane and his gang manage to wipe away Wayne's already diminished wealth, Batman rises once again.  In a one-on-one confrontation with Bane, the Bat man finally meets his match.  Imprisoned in a far off gulag, Wayne must once again not only rehabilitate physically but mentally, before his ultimate return.

He is aided by a young policeman (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) whose honesty and enthusiasm catch the attention of both Wayne and Commissioner Gordon.  John Blake (Gordon-Levitt) provides much of the intelligence and courage needed in the film and Gordon-Levitt is excellent in the role.  Wayne/Batman also manages to enlist a cat burglar named Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) in the final battle.  Hathaway manages to steal almost every scene she's in and that goes beyond her Catwoman suit.  There are some other wonderful performances.  Christian Bale gets to show a broken side of the Wayne/Batman character.  He's failed and he's lost his true love and struggles to get it together.  Michael Caine's Alfred gets some of his best scenes in the trilogy as he tries to guide and motivate Wayne.  In addition to some tense, exciting scenes filmgoers are treated to a couple big surprises.  See if you can see them coming.",1342828800,2,2485,5.185929648241206

4428189,5,B004LWZWGK,"Back in 2005, when I first heard of this new reinvention of Batman courtesy of Christopher Nolan, I didn't know what to think. I had not known of Nolan's previous work, and just didn't know if this new take on the superhero legend would do it for me. Now, 7 years and 3 movies later, I can safely say that, oh yeah, it worked! And now, here we are at the end of Nolan's trilogy, which will no doubt go down as one of the greatest film trilogies of all time.

I won't go into too great of detail, as it's stuff to discover as you watch, but these are the basics. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" takes place eight years after the events of 'The Dark Knight'. Batman no longer exists as we learned he took the fall for the murder of Harvey Dent at the end of the last movie. Commissioner Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) is the only one to know the truth. Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) has become a recluse and getting a Howard Hughes reputation among the citizens of Gotham City. But when a new evil strikes the city in the form of the hulking, mask wearing Bane (Tom Hardy, who sounds like an evil Sean Connery), and the sneaky cat burglar Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) also appears on the scene, Bruce is pushed back into action and Batman returns to save his beloved city from utter destruction.

Obviously, there is a lot more to it and a lot more to say, but part of the fun is watching this movie unfold with your own two eyes. Actually, it's hard to put into words what I think of this movie. It's really one of those ""just go see it for yourself right now!"" kind of movies. Timely and relevant, TDKR is a superhero movie that will be talked about decades from now. I don't know if I loved it more than TDK, but I loved it just as much. No one will ever be able to touch Heath Ledger's Joker, but the epicness of this movie is just unmatched. Director Christopher Nolan is a man with fierce talent. He films a Batman movie like no other. The movie is just large and epic in scope. Thankfully, Nolan also uses real, practical in camera effects and stunts when so many others would do everything in CGI. CGI probably is in use here, but it's completely seamless, and Nolan's use of doing practical effects is something more should get back to doing.

Then there is the cast. This is the movie's strongest point. All of the returning regulars give the best performances of the entire trilogy, and that's saying something. We've known this Bruce Wayne for a few years and movies now, and you feel for him. You feel his pain, his sadness, etc. It's testament to Bale's acting and interpretation of the character. Michael Caine as Alfred has never been better. In fact, there will be a moment or two where he might have you in tears. Anne Hathaway holds her ground as well. She's confident in the role and has a way with delivering a humorous line. Her costume may not be as memorable as Michelle Pfeiffer, but she just may give Pfeiffer competition as the sexiest Catwoman ever. Tom Hardy as Bane is a hulking presence. I am not overly familiar with the character, but he is absolutely chilling. Hearing his Sean Connery meets Darth Vader voice come out of nowhere actually sends chills down your spine.

Honestly, there is so much to say about TDKR, and so much more praise I can lay on it. But as I mentioned before, it's a movie that is best left to experience and see for oneself. Throwing in a few words here isn't really going to do it justice. The movie is just an amazing piece of work in what has been a phenomenal string of movies. Everything and everyone is top notch and in the finest form possible. TDKR is thrilling, chilling, emotional, epic and you just aren't quite sure how it's going to end. It's one of the best superhero movies ever.",1342828800,5,3735,4.362068965517241
4428190,5,B004LWZWGK,"Christopher Nolan's triumphant, apparently final installment in his Batman saga, THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, is a compelling, exciting piece of modern filmmaking - more of a direct sequel to its initial entry, ""Batman Begins,"" than its immediate predecessor, the repetitive ""The Dark Knight.""

Set several years after the events of TDK, Gotham City finds itself once again under siege - this time from a mercenary named Bane (Tom Hardy) who wears a mask and talks like a muffled version of Darth Vader by way of Christopher Plummer in ""Star Trek VI."" Nobody has seen The Batman since the night of Harvey Dent's death, with Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale, seeming less uptight this time around) hiding out as a recluse in Wayne Manor, much to the chagrin of Alfred (Michael Caine), who just wants to see his master join the ranks of the living again. Bruce's world is initially perked up by a cat burglar named Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway), who's gotten herself wrapped up in the new world order that Bane's ""Occupy Gotham"" army represents - but it's just a teaser for the resurrection of Batman himself, who's desperately needed by its residents and a beleaguered Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman), who finds a new ally in crusading young cop John Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).

""The Dark Knight Rises"" is confident, visually compelling and just a bit overlong. The script, by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, is better balanced than the redundant structure of ""The Dark Knight,"" which found Batman continuously trying to save Gotham, only to be thwarted by a psychotic act from The Joker. This picture is less sadistic as well, with more of a redemptive finale that proves to be enormously satisfying as Nolan at last breaks out of the constant doom and gloom that the last picture was dominated by.

Most of the additions to the cast help enormously, from Hathaway's fetching turn as Catwoman and Gordon-Levitt's tireless police detective, to welcome on-screen appearances by veteran actors Matthew Modine and William Devane, and a few surprise cameos from veterans of Nolan's earlier Batman pictures. Bane himself is a little goofy, but Hardy packs a muscular presence, and series veterans Caine and Oldman have several fine scenes as well. Less effective is Marion Cotillard's red herring role as the new head of Wayne Enterprises and Bruce's latest love conquest - given where the story ultimately concludes, there should have been more of the relationship between Bruce and Selina, though romanticism has never been one of Nolan's strong suits.

A few elements also fall short - a somewhat bloated stretch where Bruce finds himself in Bane's prison drags the film down with Batman sidelined for too long a duration (ironic that, no matter if it's Burton, Schumacher or Nolan, the focus always seems to drift off the Caped Crusader in every one of these pictures). There's a bit too much Bane and several pretentious, accompanying monologues, while Hans Zimmer's ridiculously over-scored soundtrack feels the need to punctuate every scene - even the quieter dramatic beats - like a sledgehammer.

Still, it's hard to envision fans and casual viewers alike not being satisfied with this rousing third installment. Speaking of which, though billed as the concluding entry in Nolan's trilogy, it also doesn't feel like the end, unless the director is truly content in ending his series with some light finally infiltrating the darkness.",1342828800,16,3428,5.08170515097691
4428191,5,B004LWZWGK,"This film is amazing.  Christian Bale should win an Oscar for his astonishing performance as Batman.  Anne Hathaway was the best Catwoman so far and Tom Hardy was the best vilan I have ever seen since Darth Vader.

The movie does start off slow, but it builds itself up to the epic fight between Batman and Bane (Tom Hardy).  I love the way Bane intimidates you while astonishing you.

This movie should be fine for children 12 and up.  The film has a very dark tone.  Bane breaks peoples necks with his hands which is often on screen.  Near the end the film turns from scary to sad which might be too much for younger children.

Don't be discouraged from seeing this movie because of the shooting at the midnight screening in Colorado.  I have sympathy for the families who lost their loved ones indeed, but don't let that moron who killed those innocent people destroy it for you.

The Dark Knight Rises is epic so please go and see it, it is worth every cent that you pay to go and see it.  Trust me, you'll agree.",1342828800,49,1017,4.351063829787234
4428192,5,B004LWZWGK,"As someone of the unpopular minority who didn't like Christopher Nolan's previous Batman film 'The Dark Knight' (but really liked 'Batman Begins') I find 'The Dark Knight Rises' a pleasant surprise. It carries a lot of the elements of the first two films, especially TDK's darker tone but manages to off-set it's self-seriousness with a strong story, terrific action-scenes and characters I wanted to root for!

The story of 'The Dark Knight Rises' takes place eight years after the events of 'The Dark Knight' Gotham Ciy is seemingly crime free and the Batman hasn't been seen since (still wanted as a fugitive after the events of TDK). In steps Bane: a super-strong, methodical terrorist leader intent on destroying Gotham and ends up forcing Batman/Bruce Wayne out of retirement. There's a lot of elements at work in this dynamic story (taking obvious influences from the Batman comics Knightfall, No Man's Land and Dark Knight Returns) and the movie's almost 3-hour length is felt, but Nolan's strong directing and script manage to bring it all together and he keeps things moving at a brisk pace.

As much as I like the story in 'The Dark Knight Rises' it's the characters I found myself most vested in. Regular greats Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman return as Jim Gordan and Lucius Fox, while Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays honest cop John Blake and Anne Hathaway the thief Selina Kyle (each giving the film both an every-person to follow and moments of comic-relief). Marion Cotillard gives protagonist Bruce Wayne a business partner as well as a love-interest in Miranda Tate. Tom Hardy doesn't make Bane as memorable as Heath Ledger's Joker (no one could) but he's an imposing presence and a terrific foil to Batman in terms of strength and ingenuity.

All the characters in 'The Dark Knight Rises' have a chance to shine, especially in their personal journey's and relationships but the one holding it all together is Bruce Wayne/Batman himself. It's fun seeing Batman  drive through the dark in the Bat-Pod, stealthily take down criminals from ceilings and dodge gun-fire between muzzle-flashes. Watching a middle-aged and physically impaired Bruce Wayne build himself back up (especially after a nasty beat-down from Bane) is almost as awesome as watching him become Batman for the first time! Christian Bale's amazing performance sells this character in every scene and I especially liked how his relationship with his Butler Alfred played out (an equally compelling Michael Caine with much more screen time). This is the hero I wanted in the first two films!

While the direction is sharp and the story exciting, 'The Dark Knight Rises' does have some obvious faults. Hans Zimmer's musical-score is strong as ever but the film's sound kept drowning-out character's dialogue, even during some key moments; Bane's voice-box really didn't help matters either. Nolan's usual self-seriousness is also most apparent in this film, and while the dialogue is less artificial this time around (with much more humor) the movie still got a bit heavy-handed.

Even with it's short-comings 'The Dark Knight Rises' is an original and exciting superhero epic. Most fans will probably still favor 'The Dark Knight' as the best of Nolan's trilogy but I'm just glad TDKR is such a great conclusion.",1342828800,185,3288,5.090909090909091
4428193,5,B004LWZWGK,"First, I'd like to express my sorrow for the tragedy in Aurora. This is a shame and another disgraceful, cowardly act. Thoughts and prayers to the families of the victims.

Now, the movie. Stunning. I had to see this movie twice in order to make a proper review. Like Inception, this was so complex I had to see it again to fully appreciate what I'd just seen. It is simply brilliant. A perfect, satisfying conclusion to one of the very few great trilogies ever. And simply the greatest superhero/comic book trilogy. In fact, I don't know if that feat will be accomplished again.

This movie collects its parts and puts them together well. Christian Bale was great as Bruce Wayne and Batman. This series showed us the hardship of being a human who decides through grief to take on really an impossible mission against all odds. And somehow, he actually succeeds to a certain extent. This wasn't so much a story of a superhero but of a man and his extraordinary journey to find closure to a trauma in his life and at the same time sacrifice himself for others in duress or without hope, showing what a true hero is. Compelling.

There's so much going on that easily this film could've been lost. Few have the talent to hold it together and Christopher Nolan did it like a master. What a storyteller. He is the leader of the new breed of master storytellers with the likes of Joss Whedon, JJ Abrams and Matthew Vaughn. These guys control their worlds with great crews and casts.

Everyone brought their A game. Gary Oldman, JGL, Morgan Freeman, Anne Hathaway, Marion Cotillard, Tom Hardy. Great character portrayals.

Catwoman was cool and very relevant. No camp here. Good job.

Bane. This villain was great. Now, people keep comparing him to Joker. Not similar whatsoever.  And that's what makes these villains great. They're not the same. Ra's Al Ghul, Scarecrow, Joker, Two Face, Bane. All their own person. I love that. Let me say, out of them all, Joker does stand out the most. Not because he's a better villain but because of the type of villain he is. He was so unpredictable in his actions. However, for the type of villain Bane is, he was even more dangerous. I love those differences. That way I don't feel like I'm watching a repeat. Bane was cool, cold, calculated, powerful, confident evil. He and Batman's brawls were intense. I loved his voice. It had class at the same time with ferocity. And, unlike some who must blast loud music in their ears causing hearing loss, I understood everything Bane said, and it wasn't that hard. You definitely couldn't be a passive listener though. You have to focus.

I loved the twists in the story and, not to give anything away, the comic nod and conclusion left me completely satisfied. I love this trilogy. No superhero film has captured the humanity of its characters the way Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and now, The Dark Knight Rises did. The closest ones that did are Iron Man, X-Men First Class and Watchmen. As far as realism is concerned I mean. There are other comic films, like The Avengers, I love. In fact, The Avengers and The Dark Knight Rises are my favorite movies this year. And both so different.

This movie has its critics, but like each film in this series, it garners far more praise than negatives. So negative reviews will be nothing but a whisper in the wind.

I tie this with The Dark Knight. This trilogy is spectacular. Go see it.",1342828800,4,3414,4.618811881188119

4428195,5,B004LWZWGK,"It's been 4 years since The Dark Knight came out, and while only time will tell if this movie will live up to the ridiculously high standards set by fans of the franchise, one thing that is indeed for Sure is that The Dark Knight Rises is seriously awesome. A long time fan of Batman, I haven't missed a single opening day of Btman, and last night I decided not to break that tradition. The minute the tickets went on sale a month ago, I frantically pulled out my Blackberry and opened the cineplex app, frantically hitting the ""reload"" button nonstop and finally got ahold of IMAX midnight premiere tickets, and while the wait for the midnight show was long and torturous, it was worth every single hour of the wait.

Now I consider myself to be a rare breed, one of the few who prefer Batman Begins to The Dark Knight. Don't get me wrong, I love The Dark Knight to pieces, but it's always been about the comic book feel and how Batman and Bruce Wayne continue their inner battle against himself for me. I mean, while I love TDK, there's too much Bruce Wayne for me, and it's more of a Christopher Nolan action thriller than Batman. So I hoped that TDKR would deliver... in short, it did.

Eight years have passed since Batman took the blame for Harvey Dent's horrible crimes. Bruce Wayne is disgraced, shamed, and living in reclusion, with exceptionally poor health. Since Harvey Dent died, an Anti-crime act named after his belief in cleaning up the streets has been put in place, and a Harvey Dent day has been put in place to honor his beliefs.  However, that can't last; a sexy but mysterious jewel thief named Selina Kyle, with feline tendencies, has been wreaking havoc in Gotham and even worse, a terrorist named Bane has arrived in Gotham, and has an underground army who are planning a tyrannical nightmare of a plan that will turn Gotham into gangland territory. This means Bruce Wayne has to come out ofnhiding and return as Gotham's caped crusader for once and for all!

Man, I couldn't have asked for a better finale to the series. This film pulls the blockbuster out of its comfort zone and gives us something that feels so intimate, yet so grand scale. The action is big, epic, and bombastic, yet the drama is intimate, up close and personal. And another part that made it so great: comic book Batman is back! While the dark and grim tone is still there, the tongue in cheek, quirky comic book feel is inthe air, specifically during Batman and Catwoman's scenes. Mind you, Heath Ledger's Joker isn't around, and Bane is the villain but up to 11 with the brutality and minus the wit and comic charm, so we're relying on Catwoman for those sparks of verbal wit, and it does work... Way better than it should, even! And the villain. Bane. He is one scary mofo. He can snap someone's spine in half like a lobster without even any effort. The mask he wears is terrifying and as a result, your heart fills with fear and dread every time he shows up.

Another reason to see this movie is the IMAX cinematography. It's an ultimate sin to miss this in IMAX. 72 minutes of the movie were shot with IMAX cameras, and it helps enhance it much more. They're not just for big set pieces like TDK, they help enhance the narrative of the film. Without a doubt the most interesting use of the IMAX cameras is the fight scene in the sewer between Bane and Batman. No music, violent and brutal, and a few shots where Bane's all, terrifying image fills the 8 story screen just make for one of the most memorable scenes in recent memory.

Never has Batman been done this much justice, and thank Nolan for finally getting Batman exactly right. I felt like a kid during several scenes, like Bat riding his batpod through the tunnel, the Batjet scenes, well practically the whole film,  and overall I was overwhelmed with that childlike happiness and joy- the batman I always wanted to see had finally unfolded before my eyes.

Do not miss this film... You will regret missing it!",1342742400,2,3973,4.515994436717663
4428196,1,B004LWZWGK,"I need to re-evaluate everything because right now I'm gobsmacked by all the raving reviews. In some ways I feel like a villain. Ive become bitter and cynical about society today in the same vain as every batman villain to ever  grace us with their presence. People need to wake up!! What is everyone talking about!?! Seeing dark knight's stock rise the way it has... I ve got to interject.

No Way. I'm pretty sure I saw what appeared to be a very cumbersome movie. Christopher Nolan really struggled with this one. The structure of the story was poorly derived. He had no handle on the momentum of the film. Right from the beginning with the first scene it felt like the drama was unfolding on a hot air balloon for some reason. It was unengaging and sporadically paced. And this problem extended right to the end of the movie. What a mish mash of action scenes, subplots, and story arcs. Directed with such poor direction.

And in between all the mumbo jumbo deep sentiment (mostly from Alfred... Get a grip old man) we are entertained with one liners ""it's not a car"", and silly action scenes with police marching right into the line of fire like it was 1917 again. Or how about the mammoth cliffhanger ending for bane. I mean, batman goes to the pits of eternal hell trying to compete body blow for body blow With this incomprehensible turtle and all it took was a Shotgun blast to the stomach from catwoman. What a gripping conclusion! Even less satisfying was the twist, that someone else was behind all this. How on earth this Woman, born in prison, became a derivative of complete evilness... We will never quite grasp. And this so in turn really highlights what I'm trying to say. How does a 2.5 hour movie not have time to really make this a believable character twist? Why does this momentous occasion feel so rushed?

Every momentous occasion feels so underwhelming, meanwhile we get long drawn out scenes of dialogue between characters that we care little about and story arcs that make this film so tedious to watch. I can't even recall when Bruce Wayne finally dons the suit. As a ridiculous example I was watching the latest Rambo film on cable today and I was stunned how well Sylvester Stallone got it right in comparison. 350 people get torn apart in that film but I distinctly remember the moment Rambo awakens from reclusion (on that boat). His veins pop out and his teeth clench POW! What a scene! His back! It was so well weighted... Dark knight rises? When? Oh that's right when he gets his vertebrae shoved back in his spine and does a few push ups.  What was it? He has to feel the pain of being born in prison to climb out. Took him all of 2 minutes in the movie. The pacing is sooo bad. Meanwhile a conversation between two irrelevant characters in the first half of the film would carry on for much longer.

The villain was not a strong enough menace and I'm tired of the same one dimensional Pursuit to reign destruction on Gotham city. How many times does Gotham city need to dodge apocalyptic catastrophe? why can't a bunch of well paid writers come up with something more meaningful a third time round. I'm so confused how people don't see how this seemingly lost Wayne character finding his mojo again is not just a rehash from the first movie.

Nothing worked for me. But then here you go. Apparently it worked for everyone else.",1342742400,44,3365,4.542904290429043
4428197,4,B004LWZWGK,"After years of not being Batman (Christian Bale), Bruce Wayne must come out of retirement to stop a mad man named Bane (Tom Hardy) who wants to destroy Gotham. Batman may be outmatched this time though and needs the help of resourceful cat burglar Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway). As well as Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a promising young cop who's one of the only who believes Batman didn't kill Harvey Dent.
  The plot is much deeper than I make it sound but it's hard to get into more without giving too much away. Does the film live up to all the hype though ? Yes, since it is from Christopher Nolan and there is plenty of excitement and twists but Dark Knight was still better since this one is much slower. The strongest things about this one is the Batman and Catwoman scenes and Tom Hardy's intimidating and scary performance as Bane.
 However, despite being a really good film,  everything isn't wrapped up in one great package, 3 films isn't enough when so many villains were yet to be seen in Nolan's Batman films and there's so much more that could be explored, even the ending made me want more and when I say more, I don't mean a reboot. The end leaves more possibilities than Nolan intended.",1342742400,4,1204,4.534562211981567
4428198,3,B004LWZWGK,"Yes, the movie was good, but it wasn't great. It was about on the same level of Batman Begins, but that was already done. Then there was the Dark Knight, which was a step up from Batman Begins. This final film is then a step down. An ""ending"" should always be a step above the last. So, the movie kind of disappoints. Perhaps it was because I watched the whole trilogy at once, or that it was late and I was kind of tired and hungry, but I'm not surprised. Christopher Nolan himself has said the problem with movie franchises is that the first films are almost always better. In this case, the second one is the best.
SPOILERS AHEAD
I'm just going to jump right into it. How can this be an end when that would totally contradict the first movie? Batman isn't a man. He's a symbol, an ideal, not flesh and blood. Men can die. Men will die. But Batman will always live on as a beacon of hope for the oppressed and a nightmare of fear for those without decency. And the actual ending to this final film? Yes, Bruce Wayne ""dies"", but so does Selina Kyle as she obviously wiped her record clean or even from existence. So, legally, they're dead, or at least one is and the other no longer exists, but physically speaking, they're alive and well and seem to be together romantically. Batman's not dead as Robin John Blake (his full name) has inherited the batcave and will obviously assume the mantle, even though he hasn't been as highly trained like Bruce. So, right there, you can already make a fourth Batman film and even a spinoff 'Midnight in Florence' romantic film about two lovers, no past, many secrets, questionable source of income, and much more. As for Bane, he truly is a student of Ras Al Ghul as in I felt like I just watched a longer version of Batman Begins. I mean, statistically, he should be the scariest foe of all the movies as he killed the highest number of innocent people and destroyed the most property, but he never came off as menacing as the Joker. And it was hard to understand what he said sometimes with his Darth Vader meets Sean Connery voice. And how could Bruce Wayne not figure out he had Talia Al Ghul in his presence? It's supposed to be realistic. Am I supposed to believe Bruce Wayne doesn't do background checks on his business associates? And he also slept with her. He only kissed Rachel and he technically stalked her in the first two movies. He found out everything he could about Selina Kyle before kissing her. But if he sleeps with a woman, he won't even google her? That's just nonsensical. The movie was disappointing. I figured the whole thing out before the 40 minute mark. The Dark Knight was way better. That movie blew me away. The only things that surprised me in this movie was that Alfred left Bruce Wayne which, to me, came out of nowhere, Wayne Enterprises was bankrupt (before Bane even showed up), and that someone would actually name their son Robin. I see why John Blake never said that name once throughout the whole movie. I guess I should review Anne Hathaway's performance as Selina Kyle/Catwoman. Not going to lie, better than I thought it would be, but still forgettable. She did well as Selina Kyle, but her Catwoman wasn't very good. It just didn't seem natural. I could buy her girl next door turned femme fatale, but the tights just seemed too far for her acting range. That reminds me, Bane's death sucked too. He should've died in an explosion, preferably with the Wayne tech built device threatening the city like Ras Al Ghul before him. That gives me an idea for a better ending. Tragic, but better. I'll keep that to myself for now. Enough spoilers for one day.",1342742400,8,3639,4.481927710843373

This movie, despite being waited for and anticipated for over a year, has managed to exceed my expectations. It will be really hard to explain how great the film is without spoiling one or two of the surprises so if the review seems incomplete, you might want to see the film; it is most definitely worth seeing. The third and likely final installment in Nolan's Batman film series focuses more on Batman and his lifelong struggles than anything else. From the beginning of Batman Begins, Batman has been struggling to find himself as a person due to the loss of his parents and strong desire to find justice when no justice seems possible. That is why the Batman/Bruce Wayne in this third movie struggles to live when being Batman is nearly impossible due to age and Gotham only reminds him of the loss of his family and Rachel. The movie is heavily grounded in action and the movie is paced so that we get occasional action throughout followed by a long and intense battle sequence at the end. The action is exceptionally paced and executed, keeping you so gripped that you easily let the film grab your entire attention and move you wherever it pleases. The acting is what you would expect from so many high quality actors: nothing short of fantastic. The story starts slow, but moves more quickly as the time wears on, but never falters or misses a spot to shine; the script and storyline are truly as good as Nolan said it would be. I don't feel like I can critique much further without spoiling something so I will leave you with this: the movie definitely goes all the way back to complete the entire trilogy and gives a true sense of closure for the legacy of Batman. This may be one of the best, if not the greatest superhero franchise of all-time.

4428201,2,B004LWZWGK,"I am a HUGE Batman fan and had nothing but excitement in mind when I saw the previews for this. Unfortunately, Christopher Nolan decided that the worst movie he ever made would be his third Batman film. What went wrong? (No major spoilers here...if you've seen the ""I'm Gotham's reckoning"" previews for the film you know as much as I'm going to share)

1. No Batman. You are 45 minutes into the film before you see Batman for the first time. After that, he's in and out for a grand total of about 25 minutes of screen time in costume. In the third film of a trilogy about Batman, this is pathetic.

2. A boring villain. Yes, Heath Ledger is dead and it would have been a mistake to try and replace him, but to decide you've had a charismatic villain in the previous film so it's time to go with a plodding boring one in Bane for the second is stupid. Everything that made ""The Dark Knight"" interesting is lacking here. And thanks for deciding to make Bane's voice so hard to understand. It's just like in the comics...no, wait, it's not anything like the comics. It's just a stupid plot contrivance to be artsy. Oh, and the whole ""rich people are evil"" plot point was unnecessary.

3. The sudden introduction of a major character for convenience's sake. Remember in the third Lord of the Rings movie where Sam picks up Frodo and carries him the final steps to Mordor? Now imagine if we'd never heard of Sam before the third film, and suddenly he has more screen time than Frodo. Nolan decides to conveniently take Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Lucius Fox, and even Batman out of the film through one circumstance or another and put all the focus on a brand new set of characters we don't know or care about. Yes, Blake was an interesting character...but he should have been in all three films if he was going to be that important. And if you haven't figured out who he really is within the first 15 minutes of the movie you aren't trying.

4. The plot. Trying to combine ""The Dark Knight Returns"", ""Knightfall"", and ""No Man's Land"" into one film seemed too grand...and it was. He should have taken something like ""The Long Halloween"" or even just ONE of his three choices and made it a movie.

The only plus in this is Catwoman. Anne lights up the screen when she's there with the missing action and charisma we get from absolutely no one else. She needed Blake's screen time though.

All in all, I was incredibly disappointed. Yes, I understand the whole thing was ""Batman is human""...but why in the world did Nolan decide the way to end his trilogy was to make it this horribly plodding film that should have had at least 30 minutes cut out of it. I'm sorry to see DC's movie franchise falter like this after Green Lantern. They just can't catch a break.

If Nolan comes back for another Batman film, I'll give him another chance and definitely watch it. I mean, seriously, it couldn't get much worse than this.",1342742400,21,2912,4.483018867924528
4428202,5,B004LWZWGK,"I don't even feel like I'm capable of writing a review for it having seen it only one time.

There's so much going on in the film, and it's so hard hitting in an emotional sense, it Was hard to even grasp all of the more subtle nuances of the film. It's one of those movies you feel more than you necessarily comprehend.

The movie very much mirrored it's villain; it's a beast. Massive, overwhelming, and unrelenting. The various subplots and character arcs of the film all intertwine and come together in an incredibly satisfying way ultimately - and pretty much every single cast member turns in a memorable performance with great emotional resonance.

If it has one downfall, it may be that it's a little TOO big and monstrous to fathom at times, and I'm guessing many fans will come to enjoy TDK more purely because it's a bit simpler, less emotionally taxing film. But TDKR is very much the summer extravaganza done right. It's what Transformers 3, or The Matrix 2&3 or POTC 2&3 SHOULD have been, it improves upon what's already been done in HP and the Deathly Hollows and, most strangely, it both compliments and contrasts Avengers in every sense of the word - It's the ting to TA's yang, it's the night to TA's day, and thats really cool to see; for one superhero movie to elevate another to even greater success.

I need to see it again. I need explore Bruce's character arc and journey a little bit more in depth. I need to let the shocking power and viciousness of Bane sink into my skull a little bit more. I need to gain a better grasp on the plot structure and exactly how each subplot ties into each other, and most importantly, I need to really explore what TDKR is trying to say socially, individually, and about the superheroes in general.

Overall though, I'd say at least a 9/10 or 10/10. If its not the best movie of the year, it's the second best (I do love Moonrise Kingdom), and it will most assuredly go down as one of best movies - and possibly best superhero movie - ever made.",1342742400,17,2004,4.449591280653951
4428203,4,B004LWZWGK,"As soon as ""The Dark Knight Rises"" begins, you're practically guaranteed to have goosebumps. The opening scene is hair-raising; it's exciting, it's blood-pumping, it gives you an idea of what to expect over the next two hours and forty four minutes. You're practically tossed around, choked out, and physically manhandled by Bane nearly every moment he's on-screen. No, he's not as big as he was in the comics but he's still pretty freaking big. Tom Hardy is sensational. His eyes are so expressive, angry, and cold. Even though his actions will probably be the first thing you remember about the character, his eyes will practically haunt you during his performance.

The entire cast is really phenomenal though. Christian Bale is still a solid Bruce Wayne/Batman, but it certainly seems as though he's more of a foundation for the rest of the cast to be greater than he is. Anne Hathaway is mesmerizing as Selina Kyle. Her being cast in the role seemed a bit underwhelming at first, but she surprises you. She makes the Catwoman character her own; she's intelligent, sexy, always has something quick-witted to say, and you figure out just enough about her to want her to be around more often than she is.

The direction the Alfred character goes in is really interesting. He just wants what's best for Bruce, but does something that is easily the most difficult decision of his entire life. Michael Caine is extraordinary. He plays the father figure so perfectly. Gary Oldman shines, as well. Oldman is pretty great in every role he has anyway, but this is the first time in one of the Batman films where he's had to defend his actions. Oldman is so absorbing and enticing whenever he loses his cool or gets angry in a film. Newcomer Joseph Gordon-Levitt also deserves some recognition. Constantly called a hothead by his superior, Jim Gordon takes him under his wing. The John Blake character is so passionate about what he thinks is right and what he thinks Batman should be doing and Joseph Gordon-Levitt does a fantastic job portraying that.

Hans Zimmer's soundtrack for the film is easily one of the best this year has had to offer. There's enough familiarity in the soundtrack to trigger nostalgic moments from the two previous films, but it adds something raw and visceral during the chants and during anything that plays in the background when Bane is on screen. A song like ""The Fire Rises"" is haunting in a way and the music is so sharp; it cuts to your very bones. Pounding drums, horns that seem to bide their time and start low and then scream when you least expect it, and strings played so vigorously that you expect to hear them snap and break at some point. Meanwhile, the slower songs like ""Mind If I Cut In"" rely on something like a simple piano arrangement but also seem kind of playful at the same time to adhere to Selina Kyle.

There are certain things in ""The Dark Knight Rises"" that make it really solid and one of the best third installments of any franchise, if not the best; the main one being the last twenty minutes or so. The conclusion is spectacular and it seems like Christopher Nolan built this entire near-three-hour spectacle around these key moments. It is near perfect and satisfying in almost every way.

The other thing is how Nolan was able to bring so much back from not only ""The Dark Knight,"" but also ""Batman Begins"" and makes this feel that much more conclusive. Characters you remember are mentioned, Bruce's childhood is brought up on more than one occasion, and the whole movie is just littered with references and throwbacks to what this franchise has already accomplished. It feels like everything comes full circle and that this chapter of Batman is indeed over.

Everything in between the jaw-dropping opening and the amazing conclusion feels so familiar though. There are new characters while old ones are taken down new paths and the destruction being done to Gotham is on the biggest scale this universe has ever seen, but if it wasn't for the well-written screenplay it would feel a bit repetitive. As you play the movie over in your head after it ends (and you will, more than once), you begin to see things and wonder why they weren't expanded on.

One of them being that Selina Kyle is terrified of Bane. She's obviously familiar with what he's done in the past or had some sort of run-in with him. Their past is never really fully explained and the two characters don't really have any screen time together. Then there's the obvious nitpick of not being fully able to understand Bane at all times. It'll just give you an excuse to see it again, honestly.

""The Dark Knight Rises"" is final in the best of ways. It is overflowing with explosive action, features passionate performances from every part of the cast, and is just completely and totally engrossing from beginning to end. Some are calling it a masterpiece, but it doesn't quite reach that status. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is really quite good and even great at times, but doesn't obtain the same level of brilliance its predecessor did.",1342742400,3,5060,4.735527809307605
8435194,5,B004LWZWGK,"The final film of Christian Bale's stint as Batman is, I think the best of the tree films. I was a fan of the comics when I was a child and I was glad to see someone take a more serious approach to Batman than The earlier Micheal Keaton films which were a little ""campy"". Not to mention that grotesque TV show of Adam West's! Gad, that was awful! Anyway, this is a great way to complete the trilogy and I find it highly entertaining. Recommended to all fans of ""The Dark Knight"" and not the fans of Adam West, God rest his soul!",1528416000,,528,4.086538461538462
