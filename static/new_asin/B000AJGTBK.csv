8078627,5,B000AJGTBK,"It was hard to get hold of Lamb to the Slaughter, but well worth the effort. This episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents is justly famous. Utterly delightful.",1401580800,,156,4.814814814814815
8078628,5,B000AJGTBK,"My wife and I have been telling our children and their kids about, 'Lamb to the Slaughter' episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents for a long time.  When they finally got a chance to see it, they were absolutely floored.  They all asked, ""why isn't there anything like that on TV today??""  For myself, I was surprised by the excellent acting and quick plot development,without obviously playing up the comic aspect of the story.  Great Stuff.",1401148800,,439,4.8133333333333335
8078629,4,B000AJGTBK,"I bought this mainly for ""Lamb to the Slaughter"" which is a short story by Roald Dahl that I teach my 10th grade students. It is a good adaptation, although with some differences from the text. I also use ""The Case of Mr. Pelham"" with a unit on ambiguity. Pros: The episodes are short and therefore do not require a lot of class time. The episodes are effective tools for comparing text to film and facilitate comprehension of texts for ELL and SPED students. Cons: The kids find Hitchcock odd and his humor goes way over their heads. The acting is over the top by today's standards so the kids have a hard time finding the characters believable. Kids hate black and white movies.",1389744000,2,680,4.491935483870968

8078631,5,B000AJGTBK,"The tape is definitely vintage Hitchcock. I bought it for my ESL class after they they finished  reading the short story by Roald Dahl. They loved reading the story, and they really enjoyed the video. Seeing the story, reinforced our discussion of characters and helped them ""see"" how the main character changes.",1364947200,,312,5.0
8078632,5,B000AJGTBK,"After reading and analyzing the story, my students enjoyed watching it.  I highly recommend this to high school English teachers.",1356652800,,129,5.45
8078633,4,B000AJGTBK,"""Lamb To The Slaughter"" is among the four episodes shown on this  tape and it's the reason I bought this VHS years ago.

""The Case of Mr. Pelham,"" ""Back For Christmas,"" and ""Banquo's Chair"" are all ""fair"" episodes, decent but nothing to get excited about.  ""The ""Lamb"" story is the key one here in this edition. It's  one of the most famous episodes in the history of this long-running TV series.

Barbara Bel Geddes, was the star of this particular story, She plays a sweet wife, something she was good at doing with her soft voice and pleasant face.  Her husband comes home from work and is strangely silent. ""Mary"" (Bel Geddes) couldn't be nicer to the crabby hubby and finally he speaks up, saying coldly that we wants a divorce because he loves another woman. Although devastated, Mary exacts revenge pretty quickly by slugging the brute in the back of the head with a big club of frozen lamb as he is about to leave the house. It kills him.

The rest of the show, which comprises the bulk of it, is the police investigation headed by Lt. Jack Noonen (Harold J. Stone). The fun part is near the end when we see what happens to the murder weapon.

I defy anyone to watch this episode and not laugh at Barbara's smile and chuckle at the end!

Note: Roald Dahl, who became famous for writing ""Charlie And The Chocolate Factory"" and other bizarre kids' stories, wrote the screenplay!",1247011200,,1384,4.526104417670683
