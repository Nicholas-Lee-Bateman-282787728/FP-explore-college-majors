7878191,4,6304830823,I enjoyed this film very much.  It was a fun movie to watch on a Saturday afternoon.  My boyfriend and I got a lot of laughs.  It was like hanging out with a group of close friends.  Good one liners and easy likable characters.,1349913600,,227,4.090909090909091
7878192,3,6304830823,"I saw this movie ages ago and really liked it.  Glad to find it here and I bought it pretty cheap.  BUT - it's REGION 2!  This isn't TOO big a deal because I can actually copy this onto a new DVD and make that region free.  I'll lose some quality, but this isn't exactly a special-effects blockbuster.  I just wanna see the movie again.
Anyhow just note that not only is this Region 2 (won't play in your DVD player) but that it ships from the UK so it takes a couple weeks to show up.",1345507200,,485,3.9587628865979383
7878193,5,6304830823,"very few plan As work out

Plan B is hardly the end and can be richly satisfying on its own.

A wonderful hopeful film- truly enjoyable.",1151798400,,136,4.1923076923076925
7878194,4,6304830823,"I'm not a real Jon Cryer fan, though i usually like the characters he plays.  Too bad this one panned in theaters...it's a gem.

Writing was fantastic...lots of zingers and one-liners i still use in everyday life.

LOVE the Thanksgiving scene where after everyone has gathered at Clare & Jacks - only to find them (by looking thru the window), in the back bedroom...and 'boyfriend' Flash says;

""Is this Thanksgiving tradition in your country?""

""Not at MY house, it isn't.""

Maybe it's just my odd sense of humour, but i love this movie!  Only wish it would be pressed onto DVD sometime soon...my VHS is gonna scrape off all the oxide from my tape before long!!!",1132876800,,663,4.663793103448276
7878195,5,6304830823,"Great casting, nice characters, and clever writing. You'll love every minutes of it. The music will put smile on your face.(is there a CD out there?)",939686400,,149,4.769230769230769
7878196,5,6304830823,"It reminded me of pictures made 4 decades ago. Sincere, meaningful and a pleasure to watch. Exited the theater with a glow.",933724800,2,123,4.636363636363637
