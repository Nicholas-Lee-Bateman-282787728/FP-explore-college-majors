7824641,4,6302328020,"It's amazing! After an operation for tonsilitis, Sach (Huntz Hall) can suddenly croon like Bing Crosby! The boys know the power of such talents, so Slip (Leo Gorcey) uses Louie's (Bernard Gorcey) cafe to show off ""The Bowrey Thrush"" and rake in money. The nightclub across the street isn't too happy about that, so they try to trick Sach into joining them so that they will not go out of business. Hilarity ensues.

A cute plot makes for a cute movie. It isn't anything substantial, but it is a fun ride. Gorcey slips in as many word malfunctions as he can and Hall is as dumb as can be, just like always. Most of the gang has disbursed by this time; Bobby Jordon is nowhere to be found and former enemy Billy Benedict is present as part of the gang. Bernard Gorcey is entertaining as the high-strung but generous club owner.",1184457600,2,825,4.4635761589403975
7824642,4,6302328020,"This is the 20th film in the Bowery Boys film series.  It began with the first film DEAD END (1937) when they were so young as The Dead End Kids and later The East Side Kids.  As the Bowery Boys, they did in additional 48 films for this series 1946-1958.  For this review, I will also include the age of the main Bowery Boys cast, Leo Gorcey 35, Huntz Hall 30, Gabriel Dell 31, Billy benedict 33 and David Gorcey 29.  Huntz was in the hospital for a simple tonsillectomy. Bernard Gorcey (Leo & David's father) as ""Louie"" is having a fit because it's up to him to pay the outrageous hospital bill.  So the gang must find a way to help Louie with the bill.  Leo is angry that the radio is on.  He needs to think.  When they realize the radio was not plugged in, they look over at Huntz who miraculously is singing like Bing Crosby or Frank Sinatra.  With the help of Gabriel Dell, they decide to make some money with Huntz'es new ""voice"" singing in nightclubs.  It is the voice of John Lorenz you hear singing.  The next two films in the series are Bowery Battalion (1951) AND GHOST CHASERS (1951).",1080345600,11,1096,4.271844660194175
7824643,5,6302328020,"Wonderful movie.  Full of Bowery Boys adventure and mishap.  Huntz Hall and Leo Gorcey were a great team bringing laughter, comedy and outrageously unlikely situations to always happy endings.  I would recommend this video  to everyone as a great introduction to the Bowery Boys.  My only wish would  be that there would be more of this movie series offered.",929750400,10,358,4.983050847457627
