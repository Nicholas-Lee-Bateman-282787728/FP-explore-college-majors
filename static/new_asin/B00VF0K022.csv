7087853,5,B00VF0K022,"This is a very informative and entertaining collection of four classic 'Reading Rainbow' episodesthree from the 1980s, and one from the '90s. I purchased it because I was very interested to see the episodes featuring celebrity readers Gilda Radner and Phyllis Diller. In addition to colorful narration of the stories 'The Tortoise and the Hare' and 'Ludlow Laughs,' respectively, the on-location footage that accompanies these episodes is quite educational and fun to view. LeVar Burton takes part in a race and shows the value of physical training in the former; in the latter, he learns tricks of being a comedian in the vein of old-timers from a clown. Furthermore, the 'Animal Cafe' episode has some really cool footage of Manhattan at night in the mid-'80s via a discussion of graveyard-shift jobs that shows employees at facilities such as a radio station and bakery. All in all, this is a worthwhile purchase that should be appealing and enriching to readers and viewers of any age.",1436227200,4,989,5.036585365853658
