I enjoyed listening to the Marlon Brando tapes, listening to him talk about his life.  I was just hoping to discover something I didn't already know.

7425299,5,B0150QGRSM,"Gifted beyond words; one of the greatest actors of our time, and a multi-millionaire; in real life, Marlon Brando was wracked by self-doubt, and low self-esteem. His method of self psychoanalysis was to record hundreds of conversations with himself on a tape-recorder. Tapes made by Marlon Brando, and never heard until now.  ""My father and my mother were both alcoholics. I had to watch my father beat my mother. My father's mother deserted him when he was four years old. He never had a chance..""..""Listen to Me Marlon"" is the new hypnotic documentary on this movie icon. It's also a treasure trove of home movies, film clips, TV interviews, and shots of his beautiful island home in Tahiti, and his lovely young daughter, who left this world too soon. Brando won two Academy Awards for Best Actor. He won the Oscar in 1972 for ""The Godfather"". Brando sent a young Mexican actress(Maria Cruz), renamed Sacheen Littlefeather, to the Academy Awards in Hollywood in 1973, to accept his award for him. Instead, as the film shows, she refused to accept the Oscar, because Brando objected to the US government's  treatment of the American Indians. Miss Littlefeather was booed by the chic Hollywood crowd, and then cheered. On TV's Dick Cavett show, Brando explains: ""When the American Indians laid down their arms, we murdered them. We lied to them. We cheated them. The government made more than 400 treaties with the Indians. They broke every one of them "". Film clips show Brando at 1963's Martin Luther King's March on Washington. But Brando got revenge on Hollywood. The Salkind brothers paid him $3.7 million for 13 days of work on ""Superman"" in 1978. And Brando picked up $2 million for a small part in Francis Ford Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now(1979)"". Coppola later complained that Brando showed up over-weight for the movie. Brando then said it was crap, and that he wanted to re-write the entire script. But sadness followed Brando. In 1990, Brando's oldest son, Christian Brando, was arrested for killing his half-sister's boyfriend, Dag Drollet.. Christian Brando was sentenced to 10 years in prison. At the trial, Brando breaks down in tears. In 1995, Brando's lovely young daughter, Cheyenne, commits suicide on their island home in Tahiti. Late in the film, Brando is seen being interviewed by Connie Chung for ABC's ""Nightline"". Connie Chung says: ""Do you know that many people believe that you are the greatest actor of all time?"" Marlon Brando lowers his head, he turns to the right and mumbles something. He laughs.....",1450828800,2,2532,4.96933962264151

7425301,4,B0150QGRSM,"I was EXTREMELY excited to view this film.  I championed it strongly to a good friend before watching it fully, and now need to give a more tempered, complete review.

Before watching the film, my understanding was that it would publish private personal audio tapes made by Marlon Brando.  My expectation was that the audio would give special insight into his acting process and way of life, how he lived and worked on an intimate everyday level.  From the title, I thought it would share his own personal coaching, how he directed and disciplined himself.  I thought it would give a window into his inner monologue, the voice that we all have and use to talk to and guide ourselves.  The chance to hear Marlon Brando's little voice inside his head felt like finding gold.

The film is more of a biography of Marlon Brando narrated by Marlon Brando.  Clips from his films and some television interviews are shown along with some staged visuals to illustrate the audio.  This is a documentary and I appreciate that no talking heads, reenactments or modern interviews were used.  There are for the most part no other voices telling the story.  It's thrilling to hear Marlon Brando, speaking as himself, throughout the film.  His voice is wonderful, of course, with much variety and a few moments of emotion exposed bare.

However, because this is Brando by Brando it is inevitably one-sided.  When stories are told of issues working with him on set, Marlon only comes across as a misunderstood wounded victim.  The viewer does gain more understanding of his perspective but it feels unfair at times and unbalanced.

The staged visuals carry the viewer through an empty house that feels like visiting Marlon's place, where he made the recordings and you just missed him leaving.  For the most part this works fine and can give a sense of connection and presence to the disembodied audio.  Unfortunately a few literal and cliche visuals took me away from the imagination place and felt random and silly.  Some sagging Ugg boots, a dangling wall phone off the hook, cassette tapes in trash bags after Marlon says metaphorically, that his thoughts from the day are now used tapes that need to be thrown away.

In a segment where Marlon details the crimes committed by the US government against the American Indians, unidentified sepia photos of American Indians come on-screen with a push-in camera feeling like detouring into a Ken Burns film.  There was, often, an unrelenting soundtrack keeping viewer emotions at a peak that almost cannot be tolerated.  If your emotions are completely held captive by the score you might not notice, but I did and it caused me to feel some exploitation.  It brought me to the conclusion, especially with the American Indian segment, that the film was heavy handed.  Which is unfortunate because it is totally unnecessary.  The subject, his life and work, are 100% compelling.

There was not as much of a window, or an ear, to Marlon's little voice as I was hoping.  There was some, not much, and I didn't leave with great learning from the master actor.  'Listen to Me Marlon' refers to a tape of self-hypnosis made my Marlon Brando, where he coaches himself, in his sleep, to control his desire for food.  About his work and his values he speaks with intensity and conviction, and at times contradicts himself, which is human, but also a little painful.  Maybe that comes from my own desire to follow someone so engaging who seems so earnest and clear.  His passion for authentic work, his pain, and his search for himself are devastating and touched my soul.  His life through his acting and his own story are tragic and incredible and so far reaching and so larger than life.  It's ironic that his inner monologue is to coach himself to lose weight because he has a food addiction, which is so common a struggle.  And he recognizes that the addiction comes from needing comfort in his childhood when he was abandoned and abused, which is so fragile and again, human.

This film is not perfect, I'm so glad it was made.  To credit the filmmakers, the highly emotional music is often achingly beautiful and the staged visuals are done well to accompany Marlon's spoken visualizations that take him into sleep and self-hypnosis.  A 3-D computer graphic of Marlon's head looking like a living death mask, speaking along to the audio, is a bit overused but a strong image.  'Listen to Me Marlon' touched my soul in the first half, and in the second, when the heavy handedness came down, I felt a little ridiculous and embarrassed for recommending it so highly.  But it touched my soul, it happened.",1450742400,14,4628,4.7808564231738035

7425305,1,B0150QGRSM,"Awful film, ended up switching off after 60 minutes, though what a wasted 60 minutes it was.

Knew very little about Brando the before the film and hoped to find out about his life however the film was simply a collection of film and interview clips with no structure or explanation.

I'm sure he was an interesting subject however all I found out was he was in a Street Car Named Desire, which did well apparently and Mutiny on the Bounty, which he didn't enjoy (no explanation of why or idea of how the film did). We also found out he liked women though we're not sure who, and at one point appeared to end up with kids with a woman who had been mentioned 10 seconds earlier.

Apparently he also didn't like his father very much and was involved with the Civil rights movement (again glossed over in 30 seconds worth of clips with no narrative).

Wouldn't recommend the film unless you already have a good knowledge of this actor as it'll end up being the most frustrating thing you've watched this year.",1479513600,,1006,4.451086956521739

A witty, cleverly edited and ultimately sad doc that, quite amazingly, utilizes decades of Brando's own spoken-word tapes, which amounted to his personal diary. The film is extraordinary. A must -- not only for those who appreciate the actor's work -- but for any adult with the capacity for empathy. Which leaves out 75 percent of the contemporary movie audience. The rest of us will welcome this high level of film making.",1463529600,2,466,4.8375
7425314,5,B0150QGRSM,"""Listen to Me Marlon"" is a superb experience. Experience, because it is not a traditional straightforward biopic documentary. It is told by Brando himself, using audiotapes that he was recording during his life. We do get so see glimpses and most important aspects from his life from a childhood till the end. It shows a bit about the infamous movies he made. But more it is about listening to his thoughts, and they are haunting. It is like listening to extended version of Kurtz himself.

Overall, i highly enjoyed ""Listen to Me Marlon"". It is informative, superbly paced and very self confident and fascinating documentary. It is a haunting experience, not for everyone i guess, but if you liked the acting of this screen legend and would like to go a bit beyond the face of a man, ""Listen to Me Marlon"" is a must see.",1463270400,6,821,4.623287671232877

What an interesting guy and what an anti celebrity. He lived more life than every reviewer here did combined yet seemed never content or found his place in society.

7425323,3,B0150QGRSM,"Marlon Brando was one of the cultural icons of the Forties and Fifties, who became more and more of a recluse as he got older. He purchased an island near Tahiti and retired there, making occasional reappearances in movies in return for huge fees. In the end he became fatter and fatter, and when he died at the age of eighty in 2004, he was a mere husk of the superstar who had wowed audiences fifty years previously.

LISTEN TO ME MARLON tells his life-story in his own words. Entirely composed of extracts from tape-recordings he made himself and stored in his private collections, it tells the tale of a lonely boy from Omaha with an alcoholic mother and a violent father who learned how to make his way in life through a combination of sheer guile and strength. He made his way into the theater, and was quite literally plucked from obscurity to become one of Broadway's biggest stars, with iconic roles such as Stanley Kowalski in A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE.

We learn a lot about Brando's meticulous approach to preparation for a role; rather than seeing it as a combination of gestures and vocal tricks, he quite literally inhabited his parts. At his best he exuded a danger that made him at once attractive yet frightening to audiences of stage and screen.

Yet beneath that confident exterior lurked a fundamentally insecure person, or so the tapes suggest. Brando's turbulent family upbringing left him with little or no moral pointers to guide him; he had to devise them for himself. Sometimes this need for self- reliance went too far; he became violent, almost obsessive in his behavior, especially towards women. He reveled in his ability to conquer them; we have no indication of a softer side to his nature.

And it is this reluctance to reveal much about himself that constitutes the film's principal shortcoming. Although the tapes were never intended for public airing, we get the sense that Brando is still giving a performance; leaving a legacy for posterity that portrays him as a passionate actor concerned to maintain a tough-guy image. Even when we see him breaking down in court at his son's trial, we feel that it is no more than a performance designed to curry favor from the jury.

LISTEN TO ME MARLON could have benefited from a more dispassionate directorial perspective - perhaps through inclusion of reminiscences from some his friends, colleagues and family, or through a script that invites us to reflect on what we hear from him.",1454544000,2,2464,4.788235294117647

8732237,5,B0150QGRSM,"This documentary starts off SLOWLY.
After 10 minutes it begins to take shape and you hear not only the words Brando recorded (in depth) over the years, but interviews and news footage. This is an interesting look into the life of Marlon Brando: his philosophy on life and on acting and how the two merged.
Some of this footage is really available on YouTube (On The Waterfront screen test), but I dare say I've never seem such an in depth, well rounded look into the man and the myth.

Perhaps I should give the film 4 Stars because it started off so slowly. I gave it 5 Stars because I came away learning, in Brando's own words, the truth behind the headlines (at least his point of view).

*My one gripe is that the film portrays Stella Adler as a devotee of Method Acting. After studying abroad with Stanislavski, Adler abandoned teaching Method Acting. Brando, too, used Stella's approach rather than Method. The documentary DOES shed light on how Method Acting almost psychically killed Brando after doing Streetcar on the stage.",1496275200,,1034,4.707182320441989

8732239,4,B0150QGRSM,"Marlon Brando was the great film actor of his generation. He was to acting what a dynamo is to electricity. He had dynamism, an intuitive genius of the 1st order. This film is about his own desire to look inwards and self-analyse his drives, his torments,his troubled early life. He had made hundred of hours of audio recordings and in these he scrutinises his lack of love, his alcoholic mother, his violent father. There is also home-movie footage in this 2015 documentary, giving us Brandos own story in his own words, with clips from his main films. This is as close to the mercurial,
mischievous, tragedy-riven icon as were likely to get.

He talks of his initiation into acting through the Method, which he learned from Stella Adler,who also took him in, when he travelled to New York from Omaha. Brando wanted to know as much about a characters inner life as he could, but he did it through empathy (as in A Streetcar Named Desire, On the Waterfront and The Men). Brando brought life into his acting by observing other people. Of himself, he says, We establish that hes a troubled man, alone, beset with memories in a state of confusion and sadness, isolation, disorder. Brando did this for therapeutic reasons. Brando chooses naturalism towards his family, nature, the profession of acting, the nature of celebrity, his relationship with women(always highly flirtatious),his ex-wives, his children. He develops a life-long hatred of his father,who denigrates him. Later he thinks he's closer to his father.

There is a downhill path from preternatural talent and beauty, to bloated ,eccentric egomaniac, demanding his next pay check for little work. He thinks if he hadnt chanced upon acting hed have been a con-man manipulating people. He at times loses faith in acting while also thanking it for giving him freedom. He has an amusing view of the kind of actors that had been the usual fare before him:Cooper, Bogart, Gable, seeing them as different varieties of cereal. You can see his iconoclastic intent and his dislike of the Hollywood system. At 1st acting for him is driven by intellectual curiosity to find the truth and can be explosively physical; later he sees it cynically as a way of lying and conning people and making money. Then he turns in cameos for walk-on parts.

With his disillusion with celebrity, he became a political activist for the civil rights movement,being so moved by Martin Luther Kings speech. He also supported the rights of native American Indians, seeing they had been betrayed again and again by the white man. He famously sent an Indian squaw to turn down his Oscar and make a speech about the sufferings of the Indians, and their misrepresentation in Westerns, when he won for The Godfather(1972). Receiving a few boos at the time. The very last great role he pulled off ,Last Tango in Paris with Bertolucci(1973) was pulled from inside his own lifes autobiography, where he criticized Bertolucci later for making him reveal, nakedly his own soul. He does something like this again in Apocalypse Now, where he is shot in shadow,is grossly overweight,quotes Eliot.(The Hollow Men),rewriting many of his own lines.

Brando had the experience of meeting his 3rd wife in Tahiti while shooting Mutiny on the Bounty. He felt hed reached paradise like Gauguin before him. He purchased an island and lived there and had many children. However Marlons psychological wounds deepen with age. His son Christian is imprisoned for murder, his daughter Cheyenne commits suicide(1995). He regretted due to flaws in his make-up how he had treated women and children. For an actor so deeply ambivalent about his own craft, he still had high ideals about it. He finally concedes sagely that  acting is just making stuff up, but thats OK- life is a rehearsal. We get a 3D Brando in episodes where hes shown in Mulholland Drive, reciting Macbeths  Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow speech. Brando here expresses thoughts about the future of acting:  maybe this is going to be the swansong of us all. Excellent film from Riley, well crafted and a thoughtful end product. Brando died before the film came out.",1484438400,,4135,4.932471264367816
