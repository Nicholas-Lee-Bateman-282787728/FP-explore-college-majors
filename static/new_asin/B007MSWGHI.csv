8519567,1,B007MSWGHI,One of the crappiest movies ever to come out of Korea. Don't waste your time or money.,1404604800,,86,4.117647058823529
8519568,5,B007MSWGHI,"I loved this drama. I liked the romance,confusion,life and hilarity. I watched it more then ten times and laughed each time,cried and was caught in its web. Try it and see for yourself.",1402876800,5,185,4.636363636363637
8519569,5,B007MSWGHI,"I've been watching this drama on netflix and love it.  So I decided to purchase the dvd. I picked this one since it was affordable.  However, the quality of the picture is sub par.  The movements reminds me of the way silent movies were done.  It's giving me a headache.  The subtitles are also not the best they are chunky and reminds me of space invader characters..  I like the subtitles from the netflix version better.  I'll probably purchase a better quality version of this dvd.  I'll pay more but it will be worth it.",1395014400,2,525,4.4526315789473685
