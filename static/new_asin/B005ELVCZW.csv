8468578,1,B005ELVCZW,"I am highly disappointed that Amazon is selling this DVD as a ""Spanish DVD"". There is absolutely NOTHING on the DVD written in Spanish nor is there a Spanish audio track available on the menu. Also, do not let the cover fool you, the cartoons are not the brightly color vivid ones you see on the cover. The videos on this DVD are from 1988! Beware if you have young children. I purchased this for my 3 year olds who are learning Spanish, but allowed them to watch Peter Pan after we were so disappointed that the video was in English. The Peter Pan cartoon shows characters calling one another ""idiots"" and saying some overall not-so-nice things that I'd never want to hear my Preschoolers say. I would NOT recommend this DVD.",1352419200,2,726,4.507575757575758
