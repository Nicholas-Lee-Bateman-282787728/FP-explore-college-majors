2257282,1,B00083B2VU,I read previous reviews and ordered it anyway.  There is only one Mighty Mouse cartoon and it is repeated twice.  Poor quality and very boring cartoons.  The best part is the packaging with a nice Mighty Mouse character on the paper.  I will never watch this thing again as I already threw it away.,1178755200,22,298,4.462962962962963
2257283,1,B00083B2VU,"Advertised as Mighty Mouse, but only the first cartoon is of it.  All the others are old cartoons of very poor quality  circa firts years of cartoons.",1146009600,35,150,4.518518518518518
2257284,1,B00083B2VU,"The quality is bad, sounds skips, bad picture. Pass on this one.",1142208000,29,64,4.416666666666667
2257285,1,B00083B2VU,"Although the cover picture and the title of this DVD might lead you to believe that there is a lot of Might Mouse material on it, the truth is that only the very first cartoon (Wolf-Wolf) is a Mighty Mouse episode which lasts only a couple of minutes. The DVD contents should really have been listed since you have no idea what you are getting when you buy this DVD. The only reason I wanted this DVD was Mighty Mouse and I have to say I am sorely disappointed.",1138838400,7,461,4.191011235955056
8055528,1,B00083B2VU,Horrible quality.  Looks like someone used a camcorder to record this off of their T.V.  Most of the cartoons are not Mighty Mouse and they are terrible.  Some of the cartoons are even shaking.  Picture quality is super bad.  This is definitely a boot legged DVD.  Do not buy this!!!!!!,1465344000,,286,4.62

8055534,1,B00083B2VU,"Very disappointed in this item.  Only three cartoons on it, and only one was a Mighty Mouse cartoon.  Not nearly as long as stated on information. Won't take a chance on ordering any other.",1401753600,,189,4.529411764705882
8055535,2,B00083B2VU,"Fair quality copy of one public domain Mighty Mouse short: ""Wolf, Wolf"" from 1944. Released to television December 1955, only 25 of the total 80 Mighty Mouse shorts were even made in the 1950s; majority are 1940s cartoons.",1321142400,6,222,4.868421052631579
8055536,1,B00083B2VU,Poor quality.  I got the exact same dvd...from the dollar store.  I may watch it again.  Ok for $1.,1252195200,,99,4.105263157894737
8055537,1,B00083B2VU,"I agree with the review that said this DVD was complete waste of money.  Two Mighty Mouse cartoons on the whole DVD, and they were the same cartoon.  I was looking for Mighty Mouse cartoons not the other garbage that I got.  I was not happy with this purchase at all. This should not be advertised as Mighty Mouse, it is very misleading.",1184284800,9,337,4.317460317460317
