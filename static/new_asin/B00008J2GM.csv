7984671,1,B00008J2GM,This video is dated.  China changes every few years.  I visited in 1997 and then in 2008 and the country and its people were remarkably different so I would buy a more recent video.,1231632000,8,181,4.294117647058823
7984672,5,B00008J2GM,"Since our daughter is from China I've been looking for a Dvd that would show my daughter her province (Guangdong)and some other provinces in China like: Beijing and it's Forbidden City, Tiananmen Square & Great Wall, Suzhou, Hangzou, X'ian, where the Terra Cotta Army stand, Guilin, Shenzhen, Shanghai, and Hong Kong.

The scenery is beautiful and the guide is present only by his voice which is very nice. This is very important because if China is your child's birth country you want a DVD that is done professionally and not with a guide / host who is going to make fun of China's people or it's food. Granted, food around the country is different and what you and I might think of is normal and not normal pretty much depends on where you are raised. You need a host that will not only be informative but professional. This is also a good DVD to watch is you are planning a future trip to China, it is truly a beautiful country!",1210809600,7,932,4.482352941176471
7984673,4,B00008J2GM,"Not bad as a first info.
Duration is just over 1 hour, not 100 minutes as written in product characteristics.",1208476800,9,109,4.5
7984674,5,B00008J2GM,"Of late, the world is paying increasing attention to China (Middle Kingdom) because it is just a place to travel and experience the Chinese hospitality and the mouth-watering cuisines.

So what better idea than before the actual visit to China as a tourist is to get hold of a informative DVD and familiarize oneself of what one is expected to see and enjoy prior to hopping into a plane and fly to this wonderful land  of the mystifying Orient.

I have gone through the whole series of DVDs on sale at amazon.com and I am inclined to feel that this  is perhaps one of the best discs to watch.

This DVD covers are very wide range of subject matter and should be of immense interest to either an armchair traveller (like myself at the moment) or contemplating of becoming a potential tourist to China.

China has changed a great deal since your last visit and the changes would be startling if you intend to pay the next visit to places of interest and be brave enough to  sample the thousands upon thousands of food dishes offered.

Forget about the well-trodden paths by the usual  tourists, don't join any tour group and boldly venture out on your own as you go to China.

So I highly recommend this DVD about China to potential travellers as it covers lots of tourist grounds and with 100 minutes of documentary subjects to offer,  it should not only be a good bargain but also a journey into superpower China today...!

Cheers & thanks.

Happy Chinese New Year of the Golden Hog 2007, too!",1171929600,26,1494,4.529850746268656
