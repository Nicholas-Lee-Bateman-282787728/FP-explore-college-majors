4857982,5,B005QAGBSY,"I purchased this set last year, and I love each movie.  I have watched each movie many times, and I never get tired of them.  I would rather sit and watch these old, silent movies than any of the newer movies of today.  I also wanted to say, that I received my purchase in a very timely manner.",1339027200,3,294,4.0344827586206895

8482995,5,B005QAGBSY,"Obtaining  'Silent Movies""  of Rudolph V are a real treat.  I can see where he was the first true MOVIE IDOL of his day and he did not have to say a word.  That's Acting!!!  They say he might not have survived once the ""Talkies"" came into movie theaters, but he really knew how to portray a
Romantic Hero for the time.  I know I will always enjoy these films and  a few others that I have of Rudolph and his expressive eyes!!11",1429660800,2,427,4.072289156626506
8482996,5,B005QAGBSY,"The heartthrob, the beauty and the pioneer of cinema. One can not actually call themselves a lover of cinema, a nerd of movies, unless they have seen or fallen in ultimate passion and love of the mastery of Rudolph Valentino. This contains three of his ultimate classics. He was the very reality called performer. He was a master at so many films. These three are pivotal pieces. I am one of the hugest, lovers of his talent and I become breathless at his persona in film. He died way to soon and we lost such wonderment in him. I can only think what could have been. Thankfully we have many of his films to look back on, and these three are must sees. Great product and great price.",1427673600,2,683,4.34375

8483001,5,B005QAGBSY,"Great film from one of cinema history's most talented actors! A classic! Don't miss it!

On a trip to LA  I was fortunate enough to visit what is left of Falcon Lair, Valentino's home, and I decided to purchase some of his films on Amazon. This is one of his finest performances!",1371513600,7,279,4.346153846153846
8483002,5,B005QAGBSY,"I don't like bullfighter movies but I liked this one. Valentino was an extraordinary actor who managed to tell a story with his body as much as his expressions. Silent films aren't for everyone but for those of us who prefer them to what's coming out of Hollywood today, they are a gold mine.",1356825600,5,292,4.425925925925926
