Actors are good but the story is inarticulate and lacks credibility...",1525132800,,127,5.4
8755828,5,B01DF3U6X4,"I saw the first Missing series and was saddened there would be no more , but at last , how surprised I was to watch the great writing , directing , acting and genius of this second series! I loved the back and forth time sequence because it kept what was actually happening with the mystery of the missing parts of the story so hard to wait for in the next episode. The show really bothered your intellectual thinking process .
I do not know who had the idea to place the first premier episode on my Facebook page but it was an AWESOME way to drag in your fans and new fans too! I really wish there could be some way to have more mini series in the same line as  the Missing series . You guys work great together ! your work !!!",1490054400,,728,4.020689655172414
8755829,5,B01DF3U6X4,I liked the first series but thought series 2 was even better. The acting was excellent.,1489968000,,88,4.5625

8755831,4,B01DF3U6X4,"I found this quite absorbing, for the psychology and the the excellent performances.  I didn't find the various time periods difficult to follow; they're labelled and after a while one can easily tell by the clothes, hairstyles, etc. where the story is in time.  If told in a strictly linear fashion, I don't think it would have been as effective.  I did not at all mind the insertion of personal elements of the detectives' lives; I thought it added realism and dimension.  This show is a useful antidote to all those twitter headlines of ""she's missing, she's been found, everything is okay again"" -- well, no, it's not, not for her nor for those who knew her, and it may never be ""okay"" again.",1485302400,3,696,4.588709677419355
