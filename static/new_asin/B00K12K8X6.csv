8655085,2,B00K12K8X6,"Let me be very upfront with this. I could not finish this at all, it wasn't funny, if it was supposed to be. It wasn't suspenseful, if fit was supposed to be. It wasn't entertaining, if it was supposed to be. I loved Frankie Muniz in that TV show he used to do, Malcolm in the Middle but this movie shows that he really can't act and neither can some bygone wrestler as the bad guy....diamond Dallas Paige, this was told to me by a friend, I had no idea who he was. I am issuing a very strong warning against this movie, I am not sure what these other reviewers saw. Sometimes I will try a movie again thinking I wasn't in the mood....not this one....EVER.",1514505600,,656,4.173228346456693

8655087,5,B00K12K8X6,this is a pretty good movie. I had no idea what this movie was about but I thought I'd give it a chance and I liked it. I was surprised to see adam west and stan lee in this movie. I would not expect them to be in this movie cause it was a straight to dvd film. the movie had a good story and good acting. this is a good movie. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do,1424822400,,383,3.5714285714285716

8655090,5,B00K12K8X6,"Matt Burns (Frankie Muniz) works at the family Pizza Parlor owned by his mother (Shelly Long).  He attends college and has a love interest in Susan (Amber Borycki) who dates muscle headed Todd (Ashley Parker Angel). On Fridays Matt delivers Pizza to his college professor (Michael Gross) who is working on a regeneration project for E.D.G.E. corporation. They throw tomatoes against a wall to see if they regenerate. Through a series of circumstances Matt acquires the power of regeneration and strength with the corporation wanting world dominance being the antagonist.

This was a fun cheesy film. There are cameos by Adam West who claims he left his car in a cave. KAPOW! There is another cameo by Stan Lee, the writer of numerous superhero scripts and Roddy Piper being a tough guy. Wrestling star Dallas Page has an accident with a grill and becomes a ""two face"" with half his face looking like a cheese pizza. David H. Lawrence XVII of ""Heroes"" plays the investigating detective.  Oh yes. Pizza Man does have a ""kryptonite"" type weakness to make the film even more silly.

The film didn't take itself seriously. Just a bunch of actors having fun at their job.
