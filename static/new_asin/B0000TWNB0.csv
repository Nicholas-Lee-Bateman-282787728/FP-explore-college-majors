1946163,2,B0000TWNB0,"I have now seen several Gerry Anderson projects, many hits and some misses, this one is close to dead last for me (wait, it is dead last). A priest driving a model T is the hero in this one. He also has a shrinking ray (shrinks to like 1/3 normal) that he uses on his assistant who is a groundskeeper/secret agent. Sound interesting? Well, I got the set cheap so why not buy it? If your an Anderson fan as I am, it was worth the price, just don't expect to show it to your friends as it's really tame and slow plodding with model T car chases and not a whole lot of action. Here is my ranking of the shows I like from Gerry Anderson so take that into account of your own tastes. #1 UFO (a live adult sci-fi show with some great character development), #2 Joe 90(the concept is great and the non continuous storylines work good here), #3 Captain Scarlet (I love the concept and a lot of the shows fit in with the current war on terror to me), #4 Thunderbirds (had a Corgi toy as a kid, it was the best show for kids on TV at the time), #5 Stingray (for the time, it was a great action kids show), #6 Fireball XL5 (like a Stingray except in space and black and white), #7 The Protectors (eh, it's OK), #8 Space 1999 (this is where my recommended shows stop, this show was so highly anticipated and quickly got really stupid even I couldn't stay with it in the 70's),#9 Terrahawks (just started watching it now it may move up above Space 1999 and the Protectors), #10 Secret Service. I haven't watched his other stuff and I know there is stuff out there like Supercar but that would probably rank above Secret Service for me.",1168560000,,1622,4.201923076923077
1946164,5,B0000TWNB0,"The Secret Service, Gerry Anderson's final Supermarionation series, sounds so odd that it might put off fans, but that would be a pity. This 13 episode series combines numerous Anderson trademarks, with both Supermarionation and live action, in a daring and delightful show. British comic Stanley Unwin voices Father Unwin, a priest (or is he?) and secret agent. Factor in Matthew Harding as the faithful operator, a shrinking ray, and the good father's odd eccentricities: talking in an offbeat language called ""Unwinese,"" driving a 1919 flivver, and you've got the makings of a quirky Anderson classic. For some reason the opening recalls the British cult series, The Prisoner, with all sorts of other ""anglo echoes"" throughout. As a fitting finale to Anderson's Supermarionation series, The Secret Service is last but not least.",1107043200,13,831,5.303030303030303
1946165,4,B0000TWNB0,"'The Secret Service' was a transition for Gerry Anderson, going from ""supermarionation"" ala 'Thunderbirds', 'Captain Scarlet', et al, to live action like 'UFO' and 'Space:1999'.  This sort lived series had a creative mixture of puppets and people. Witness the opening credits with the real ""Father"" Stanley Unwin. At several points in the episodes, the real Unwin could be seen from a moderate distance, entering buildings, driving 'Gabriel' his car, etc, while the real acting was performed by his manufactured counterpart. Equally interesting is the use of the 'minimizer', which would shrink his partner, Matthew, to make him conveniently two feet tall.
There was much charm, imagination, wit in this series. Standout episodes include ""Errand of Mercy"", ""Recall to Service"" and ""More Haste, Less Speed"".  Also, keep an ear open for an occasional sample of ""Unwin-ese"", the humorous doubletalk jibberish for which Stanley Unwin was famous, to confuse the bad and good guys alike!
One drawback to the show was the dreadful theme song. A combination of Mormon Tabernacle Choir and Ella Fitzgerald, it made me cringe before and after each episode.
Although no direct contribution was made by Gerry Anderson (Derreck Meddings actually did the production work), the Anderson influence is unquestionably there, even with Sylvia Anderson providing the voice of Mrs. Appleby, the short-lived housekeeper (she was absent from the last few episodes).
This series, the last of the 'supermarionation' process after 'Captain Scarlet' and 'Joe 90', is definitely recommended for fans of the genre, young and old alike.  Those who are new to this type of entertainment should look toward 'Captain Scarlet' and 'Thunderbirds', or even 'Stingray', first.",1095897600,15,1739,5.433333333333334
1946166,5,B0000TWNB0,I bought my DVD player in the UK so it is designed for PAL.  I knew it supported NTSC but didn't realise you had to switch on Quasi-PAL to make it play properly.  I did this and the picture is perfect.  I have just watched the additional commentary by David Lane - a very interesting addition to an excellent boxset.,1073260800,3,316,4.233333333333333

Brings back fond memories and excitement.",1423612800,,114,4.428571428571429

8002965,5,B0000TWNB0,"Overall a interesting concept by Gerry Anderson. I've read some reviews saying the scenes where the action jumps from puppetry to real life is distracting, but to me I find it appealing and creative. My only complaint is those darn church bells that ring at the beginning and ending of each episode. This is a two disc series and another interesting facet in the Gerry Anderson line. Good stuff!",1287360000,2,395,4.739130434782608
8002966,5,B0000TWNB0,The Secret Service is the best of the series. It has great stories and is well done. The mixing of live or rather real people is better than my much loved Thunderbirds. I am enjoying Secret Service more than I thought I would.,1244332800,2,226,4.27906976744186
8002967,4,B0000TWNB0,"In short, if you like Supermarionation then you should enjoy this short-lived Gerry Anderson entry. However, if you prefer the big-headed Thunderbirds style puppets to the realistically-proportioned Captain Scarlet type then you may wish to steer clear. Series' star Stanley Unwin makes this show; plain and simple. His low-key acting style and classic gibberish dialogs are the main attractions here. The interesting use of much more live footage inter-cut with the marionettes is a daring departure, but the obvious and jarring transition is distracting. Even so, I found THE SECRET SERVICE quite charming. 4 STARS",1241913600,5,616,5.494736842105263
8002968,5,B0000TWNB0,This is good.  Gerry was just beginning to expand into the live-action market from marionettes and I think he did a spot-on job of combining the two.,1217548800,,149,4.518518518518518
8002969,5,B0000TWNB0,"Its not Thunderbirds but it was never meant to be.  It is more subtle approach but well worth the buy.  Like Thunderbirds it was meant for adults as well as(if not more so in case) then kids.  Some good humor and themes keep this series fresh.  Though you can still see a few strings from time to time, it is not annoyingly obtrusive.  This and UFO were Derek Meddings(special effects) TV swan song before moving onto making a man fly in Superman, the Bond and Batman films.  Without Derek the Gerry Anderson world might never had grown in its popularity.  Its unique in the fact that it combines live action with Supermarionation.  Frequently when outdoors, walking or driving a car you see the real thing, rather clever idea.  I highly enjoyed seeing this series for the first time as an adult!",1207958400,2,796,4.588652482269503
8002970,2,B0000TWNB0,"I love Gerry Anderson but this really is a dud. For me and most people, I think, the main attraction of these shows was the production design-it just looked so freakin' cool!! Cool sets, great gadgets, etc. That's sorely missing from this. Not to mention the fact that to my American ears, ""Unwinese"" is completely unintellible, and, as another reviewer pointed out, a pretty thin thing to hang a series on. Having said that, since you can get it for $5 plus shipping, if you like Anderson you might as well take a look.",1187136000,,520,4.542553191489362
8002971,5,B0000TWNB0,This is essential for any fan of Gerry Anderson.  Or marionettes.  Or even James Bond.  The episodes play like you always wished your action figures and homemade dioramas would come together in the fifth grade.  My husband likes to watch these in his office/man cave so he can enjoy the plots without irony (or my snarky comments). I love the human hand close-ups and the cheesy voice-work.,1184371200,2,390,4.776119402985074
