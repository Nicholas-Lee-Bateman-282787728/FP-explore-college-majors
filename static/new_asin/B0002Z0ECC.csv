2150995,5,B0002Z0ECC,"It surprised me to read somewhere that Richard Linklater, who directed both films, did not actually have the experience of falling in love with a French woman on a train in Europe.  Both ""Before Sunrise"" and ""Before Sunset"" benefit from a feeling of complete authenticity, as if the people responsible for delivering and interpreting the storyline must've ""been there, done that...""

Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy inhabit their roles to a point of perfection.  Delpy creates such an indelible image of a young Parisian woman (with Left Bank leanings) that she could not be anything but.  And Hawke incarnates perfectly the type of inquisitive, literary, and (romantically) intense young American male who stands a chance with a woman such as we find in Delpy.  The 2nd film opens with Hawke doing a reading from his own novel on the second floor of Shakespeare & Co., wedding beautifully character and setting, as Hawke is exactly the type of young American who would be at home in George Whitman's Left Bank bookstore.

An American, I spent my youth and then some in Paris.  In fact, I met my wife, who is French, on a train, which is the way Hawke and Delpy meet in the first of these films.  And like our two protagonists, during our ride together we wrapped each other in words and our own special dialogue, which is the right word, as we were busy creating a moment which would have no place in real life: this was, after all, only a train ride.

We knew we would never see each other again, which meant time was both our prison and our liberator, confining the duration of our experience yet setting us free within it.  And, that's how things stood for four or five years, until chance (nudged along) brought us together, again.

One more thing about the 2nd film. Linklater, Delpy, and Hawke create a paean to Paris, a song of enrapture for the city that succeeds like nothing else since Hemingway and Fitzgerald lived there in the early 1920's.  Unstated, it's all in the afternoon and evening light, which seems to dissolve off the screen in total realness.

The film was like an exquisite French meal of the sort you can easily find when dining out in Paris with French friends.  You leave completely satiated.  What has satiated you, though, beyond the food and wine which have touched your palette, is the conversation you've had with your company, built over several courses and all the pauses between.  It's the conversation that you share and create together that lifts a good meal and wine to greatness.  This is a relevant note as this pair of films is carried on dialogue as much as it is on beauty.

Neither film could be better; they're as good as it gets.",1148515200,122,2674,4.653191489361702

2151005,5,B0002Z0ECC,"I could start this review with storylines, character descriptions and technical details, but I won't.  Instead, I will relate how my head and heart responded to the stimuli that was laid out in front of me... the film, the Actors, the emotions.

Both main characters (were there others?) were living their lives as ""complete"" people.  They themselves didn't realize that they were both living ""single"" existances without the warmth and pleasures of sharing their lifes with someone they loved and loved them in return. They suddenly come to the realization that they were seeing the world differently than before they met, quite by chance on a train heading through Wein (the European/Local name for Vienna).  It could have been anywhere in the world for their emotions to start kicking in and kick in, they did.  A city as magnificent as Vienna could have been intrusive in a lessor story, but even with all the simple or elaborate backrounds afforded by the sites used, my eyes watched the Actor's faces and my ears collected all the things they chose to share.

Some plans are made...

Ten years later, we meet our ""Lovers"" again, but this time in Paris.  Once again, the shortness of time they can be together without drastic life changes, is the protagonist that pushes them forward towards their destinys together.

Both films could stand alone, but I whole-heartidly suggest commiting the time for watching them both.  ""Before Sunrise"" first, then ""Before Sunset.""",1257811200,,1471,4.991803278688525
2151006,5,B0002Z0ECC,"So I've been on a pretty big Richard Linklater kick here lately.  His profoundly minimalist and surreally thought-provoking films never fail to intrigue and perplex me.  ""Before Sunrise"" and its companion ""Before Sunset"" are thus far among his most charming and engaging works.  I must say though, after experiencing the absolutely mind-bending journey that is ""Waking Life"" (which I can only describe as a mad cross between ""Slacker"" and ""The Wall""), something like this, while still pretty far from mainstream, seemed pretty pleasant and benign by comparison.

However, that's a relative measure, as this is not your average love story.  It begins with ""Before Sunrise"", in which we see a young man named Jessie (Ethan Hawke), a tourist from America traveling across Europe.  While on a train to Vienna, he meets a lovely French girl named Celine (Julie Delpy), and the two immediately hit it off.  They end up spending the day together in Vienna, but both know that soon they must go their separate ways.  This brings us to the sequel, ""Before Sunset"", where fate brings them back together 9 years later.

First of all, I'm glad to see that I'm able to review the two movies as a whole here, because to me it feels more like one continuous journey, even with the 9-year gap in between.  After watching the first movie, I was a bit worried that making a sequel would ruin everything somehow, but it felt like such a perfect and natural continuation and the ending (which also could have potentially ruined everything) was about as flawless of a conclusion as they could have possibly done.

In true Linklater fashion, the structure of both films is very minimalist.  The whole thing is essentially one long conversation, with the two characters moving from one setting to another (think ""Slacker"", but if they stayed with the same characters instead of constantly moving to new ones).  The two touch on various deep and philosophical subjects, as well as goofy random things, and their chemistry is so perfect and natural you keep forgetting that you're watching a movie, and not just two people having a real conversation.  As always, Hawke deftly delivers Linklater's cerebral dialogue like an Olivier to his Shakespeare, and Delpy brings to her character such a perfect combination of wit, sophistication, and charm.  The two characters are both very intelligent, but not in a pretentious way that detracts from the human quality.  That way, they still feel like ""real people"", even if they're not your average joes.

In the second film, we see the two reuniting in Paris, and while they've both moved on with their lives, that connection between them is obviously still there.  This one gets a bit more intense emotionally, as the past 9 years have created a lot of unresolved feelings and issues between them that finally have the chance to come to the surface.  This sort of takes away from the randomness and brings forth some semblance of (gasp!) a plot, but still the whole ""movie about nothing"" feel is never completely lost.

Overall, this is the kind of love story that I enjoy.  It's never overly sappy or romantic for its own sake, and it doesn't insult your intelligence with some outrageous farfetched story.  It's just a very natural and realistic story, and the circumstances create this sort of serendipitious romance that still somehow feels plausible.  We've all experienced that ""one that got away"" kind of situation, and usually you just never see them again, but sometimes life gives you that sort of second chance, and it feels like some sort of fantastic fantasy.  And, I like how they show that this second chance isn't without its complications, as opposed to just being ""Yay, we're back together"".  That's what makes it feel more realistic and believable to me, that it's not perfect, that there's a lot of reality to go along with the fantasy.

Anyway, I feel I'm rambling a bit now, but I thoroughly enjoyed both of these films, and I think it's essential that they be viewed back to back.  As with most Linklater films there is the inevitable ""this isn't for everyone"" disclaimer,  but I think these are actually among his more accessible works (not including the more mainstream stuff like ""Newton Boys"" and ""School of Rock"").  While I enjoyed films like ""Slacker"" and ""Waking Life"", those were more like a pure assault on your mind, while here there's more of an emotional aspect to go along with making you think, and I really appreciated that.  It manages to be simultaneously sweet and cerebral, which is very difficult to do this well.  Even if you're not a Linklater fan, and you just appreciate a heart-warming if not unconventional love story, these two films are a must-see.

(Also, if you're brave enough to take on ""Waking Life"", Jessie and Celine make a sort of cameo appearance in it. It's not supposed to be canon with this story, but it's still pretty cool.)",1236902400,23,4908,4.8547418967587035

8035047,5,B0002Z0ECC,"Every once in a while, there comes a movie or a pair of movies that make you so thankful that they can open your eyes to something much deeper and much grander than you ever expected. Upon my latest viewings of Before Sunrise and Before Sunset, I noticed a few different things, such that have heavily changed the way I look at movies and the boundless amount of creativity that can go into them instead of the standard clichs that are presented to us too often.

The whole concept of the film is inspired by experience: six years before the first film's release, director Richard Linklater met a woman in a toy shop in Philadelphia; they walked around the city together, talking as the night went on. In writing the screenplay for Before Sunrise, he chose Kim Krizan for a co-writer for the dialogue between a man and a woman to be strengthened. And what a screenplay they (along with the lead actors) wrote.

The dialogue in these two movies is so unbelievably fresh that it shames nearly all romantic dramas made today. This is not just due to the dialogue, but the pacing and the events that take place are smartly devised to make us actually believe in a screen romance. For all those who have not had the fortune of seeing either film, I'll briefly sum up: in 1994, an American mal, Jesse (Ethan Hawke), is on a train heading for Vienna when he meets a French girl, Celine (Julie Delpy). After briefly conversing, he asks her to get off the train with him, even though he doesn't have enough money for a hotel. She agrees, and they walk up and down the city, and within several hours, they begin to have a romantic connection. At the end of the movie however, he has a flight to board back to the U.S. and she is heading back to college in Paris; so they agree, as they are about to leave, to meet back in Vienna in six months. The movie ends completely ambiguously.

That is of course, unless you've seen Before Sunset as well. The story picks up nine years later, and Jesse has become a successful writer. He is on a book tour on his last date in Paris discussing the book, primarily its ending, when Celine shows up. The problem is that they can't pick up right where left off, so once again, they have to make the best of their time before Jesse has to once again pick up and leave for America.

In my latest viewings of these two masterpieces, I worked from a different method: the first time I saw the two films, I absorbed the superb dialogue and how the line deliveries were so natural, so genuine. This time however, I decided to watch how the other performer was responding to the dialogue. And what a pair Hawke and Delpy make, for they not only make magic while talking, but through their subtle performances and their absorbance of each other's words, they help to create sincere human emotions without the use of sentimentality.

Take for instance, one of the last scenes in Before Sunset when Jesse and his driver are taking Celine home. She has just lost complete control on how so many people ruined her, and how she blames Jesse for reminding her of her misfortunes with his book. He tells her that his life hasn't been as perfect as she had imagined. He speaks of his troubled marriage, and how the only thing keeping it together was his son. As he looks away out the window, she leans over to touch his hair (some say shoulder) but quickly pulls away. This is so subtly powerful because it plays out for about a split second, and then it evaporates.

Their conversations in these two films are exactly what they should be: about real life, not hopes and dreams. They discuss religion, politics, problems with the world, their past, and even misguided relationships. It shows how two extraordinarily intelligent people who just happen to be complete strangers can speak of some of the strongest topics in modern society and they can fully understand one another.

One of many things that helps make these movies work is the fact that Hawke and Delpy put some of their lives into the writing, particularly in Before Sunset: people have often drawn connections between Jesse's troubled marriage and Hawke's troubled marriage with Uma Thurman, while others drew the connection that both Celine and Delpy studied at NYU. Putting authentic experiences into a screenplay is often the smartest thing to do, and that's part of the reason why these movies work unbelievably well.

Both films have endings that are completely ambiguous: in Before Sunrise, they promise to meet in six months time. In Before Sunset, Celine has just played for Jess a waltz she wrote, intended for their encounter in the first film. While she is then dancing to a Nina Simone CD, he fidgets with his wedding ring.

I'm reviewing these two films primarily because of the impending release of Before Midnight, which I hope concludes the story (after all, less is more, right?). But if all goes well, together, these three films will be absolutely timeless. The first two are already enduring enough, but if Linklater and friends can pull if off a third time, than the world will be forever grateful.",1364774400,11,5093,4.606394707828004
