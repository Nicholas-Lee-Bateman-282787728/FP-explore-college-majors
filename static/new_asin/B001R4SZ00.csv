3773370,5,B001R4SZ00,"Purchased after reading many reviews for $54.00 New.
I had not heard of this show before coming across it here at Amazon.
It looked interesting and the reviews were all very good, and now Ive seen it myself I cant disagree.
I watched all episodes in just a couple of days and was by no means disappointed.
Please also read the more comprehinsive reviws, I recommend it, Give it a go!",1282348800,3,383,4.408450704225352
3773371,5,B001R4SZ00,"The Third: The Girl With The Blue Eyes is a must see for anime lovers.  At first I thought I wouldn't like the main character, but as I kept watching it she started to grow on me.  I love Honoka the most but the rest of the characters are just as great!  Seriously it's so smooth I wish the series was longer.  But I don't mind going back and watching it all over again :)  This is an anime to keep!",1278633600,2,399,3.876543209876543
3773372,5,B001R4SZ00,This series is awesome with a great story and really heartfelt moments between the characters. The CGI is done great here and the animation in general is great. It has to be pointed out that indeed some episodes seem to have been done by another studio and many anime spend too much budget at the beginning to the detriment of the latter episodes although I never found it to be disturbing enough to pull me out of the enjoyable series as a whole. If you are on the fence rent the first volume and the rest will not disappoint you.,1271808000,3,531,4.32
3773373,5,B001R4SZ00,"Just going to keep it short. At first I was very skeptical thinking that this series was just some typical sci-fi post apocalyptic series that was nothing short of just a girl running around kicking butt. Don't get me wrong the action in the series is great. But what really captured and pulled me in was the story and characters. Its was hard putting in that last DVD knowing the series was about to end, but a wonderful ending it did have. If the series continues in the future I'll be buying it zero day.

5 stars for Animation, Story, Characters, Action, Personality

If you a fan of anime in general I highly recommend this. If your looking for more of a comedy check out Desert Punk.",1260662400,3,689,4.417322834645669
3773374,4,B001R4SZ00,"To start with this Box Set itself is excellent. It is done in the same style as ""Raxephon"" Noir"" ""E's Otherwise"" & Fullmetal Panic the only difference is that these are full size DVD cases and has a total of 6 with one DVD per case. Like the old ""Kiddy Grade"" set. It comes in a widescreen format and the sound moves from speaker to speaker depending on where the character is on screen..for the most part. Voices are well done and do not come across as hokey. As for the animation it ranges from average to above average with the exception of Episodes 13 & 23. Episode 13 looks like someone else drew the characters..you will see what I mean. There is CG in this and it execellently done...vehicle movement is fluid and they did an outstanding job with the AI battle, that was a thing of beauty.
  About the story..There are the Humans and then there are ""The Third""..a mutation born with an Astral Eye. Yet they do not have the ability to reproduce, the third are born of human parents and they are the ruling class. Honoka was born with such an eye but was deemed to be defective by ""The Third"". Honoka never fit in with ""The Third"" & does not fit in with humanity so she lives a life of wandering in the desert. Taking odd jobs to pay the bills and maintain her AI tank, Bogey, whom is more like her Father..Teacher...mentor...than just an AI.
  A job lands in her lap and goes by the name Iks whom quickly hires Honoka to take him where ever he wants to go. How ever Iks is someone that ""THe Third"" are interested in. That is how the story starts and from that point on you follow Honoka and Iks on his journey of knowledge..a journey that puts them at odds ""The Third"" because there have placed restrictions on humanity. What kind of technology they are allowed to have...where they can go..etc.
  These are not self contained episodes...it plays as one continious story ...time may lapse in between but is explained. The story moves forward at solid pace and I did not notice any episodes where the story got bogged down. With the exception of a couple of Episodes there is not much blood yet there is a lot of fighting and this is due to the fact that most of the fighting is between Honoka and robotic enforcers.
  This was an enjoyable series and has good replay value. The type of series that I enjoy are ""Black Blood Brothers""..Death Note.. Fate Stay Night...Last Exile..Trinity Blood..just to name a few.
If you liked any of those you should find this worth your time.",1251417600,2,2481,4.425438596491228
3773375,5,B001R4SZ00,"great plot
I have no complaints it is a solid TV  series and any one who loves anime need to see it",1376092800,,99,3.5
3773376,5,B001R4SZ00,I am not in anime but my husband and daughter are really into it. And when my husband showed my daughter the movie she knew she had to have it. She watched it all the first day she recieved it.,1376092800,,193,3.85
3773377,5,B001R4SZ00,"I really liked this anime, featuring a young heroine whose story is told over the entire arc. I will watch this more than once. This is an older series, and I had never heard about it before I stumbled over a review of it on another site. In the end, the story isn't as black and white as the viewer is lead to believe in the beginning. There is some mecha, some ""magic"", swordplay, giant insects (ewww), a talking tank, pointy eared protagonists, mythology, lots of anti-war visions and political situations. This one stays in my library.",1371945600,,539,4.56701030927835
3773378,5,B001R4SZ00,"Honoka is what The Third is all about.  She is a great Anime heroine that would make any story good.  I would have liked to have seen Honoka instead of Alice as the heroine of Pumpkin Scissors.

The Third does have a firm conclusion.  That it will have a firm conclusion is not evident until the end of the series.  Initially, The Third seems to consist of episodes in Honokas life presented in chronological order.  Reminiscent of Glass Fleet, the conclusion is misty and mushy. I wasn't expecting that type of conclusion.  The rest of the series wasn't that way.  Unfortunately, the conclusion makes it difficult to ever be able to continue The Third to another series.  Weve probably seen all of Honoka that were ever going to be able to see.

The characters Honoka and Millie are well developed.  The others are somewhat shallow, but adequate to tell the story. I wish that there could have been more of Millie in the Series but the writer of The Third felt that she should make her cameo appearance early in the series and move to the background afterwards.

The animation is good.  The colors are bright and the scenes are well detailed.  Honoka is a Sword Dancer and depicting her required a great deal of animation and that was well done.

Some reviewers objected to the commentary.  I admit that it didn't add anything to the story, but it didn't ruin it either and I felt that the commentery should be given a pass.

I feel that The Third would be a good addition to most Anime science fiction collections.  Admittedly, Honoka overshadowed the plot, which is decent but not exceptional, and The Third wouldnt have been nearly as good without her.  The Third is very heroine centered.  I gave The Third five stars because I liked Honoka and also Millie. Without those two, it would have been four stars at best.",1361577600,,1820,4.593167701863354
3773379,4,B001R4SZ00,"In a devastated world overrun by monstrous bugs and outlaws, Honoka is the protector of the innocent. She has a 6th sense for danger, sword skills that rock, and an A.I. tank that acts as her partner and home. She is ready to take on any job that her clients are willing to pay her for. While crossing the desert, she finds a man wandering alone. This man has a secret, and a mission that will change her life forever. Her skills are about to be tested like never before.

This anime is a lot better than I expected. I has good animation, voice acting, a unique story, and a pretty good soundtrack. There is a lot of action, drama, mystery, adventure, and some pretty interesting characters & plot twists. There isn't another anime out there that I can really compare this to. It's pretty original, despite that, I still found it lacking a little something that would make it a 5 star show. It's hard to put my finger on what it is, but The Third is comes just shy of being incredible. Even so, it's still really good, and definitely worth watching. I recommend it to any anime fan.",1353974400,,1082,4.383084577114428
