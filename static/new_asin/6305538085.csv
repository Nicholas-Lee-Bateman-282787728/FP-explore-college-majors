But, it showed spirit, and Issac's terrible return. This  should of been, part 2. Not 6. It was about time Issac showed up....",950313600,4,286,4.9375
1043634,3,6305538085,I love and respect John Franklin. I'm glad he made a come back in this movie. But I have to be honest this movie could have been better. It starts of with some girl name Hannah who is looking for her birth mother back in  Gatlin. She walks into a hospital where she finds Isaac in a 19 year old  comma. Her touch awakens him. From there Isaac tries to finish what he began  in the first COTC movie. I don't want to spoil the whole movie and give out  the ending to those who have not seen it. But I will say that the only  action parts are the scenes where Isaac(John Franklin)is in. Like I said  before I love and respect John Franklin but this movie could have been  better.,949622400,4,676,4.075757575757576
1043635,5,6305538085,this one should be the 2nd COTC.they shouldve wiped off the other 4 becuz the 1st and this one are both classics! This one is about a girl named hannah in search for her birth mother in Gatlin. she is stopped and taken  to the hospital and sees isaac (john franklin) in a 19 yr coma. however her  touch woke him up and hes back to spread the wwisdom of He Who Walks Behind  The Rows.but while hannah is looking for her mom she doesnt realize she is  making a prophecy come true. If youve seen the other COTC but not this 1 SEE  IT! Not to give it away but it shows H.W.W.B.T.R! This movie includes blood  and a few curses. it shows hannah fooling around but it doesn't show nudity  just her kissing with a guy she fell in love with (his name is Gabriel)  however there were r a few parts i didn't get like the begining it shows  someone walking and then someone falls down half dead and in the 2nd COTC  one boy said Isaac was dead not in a coma.?  i dunno but i must say this a  great sequel with excellent acting from everyone. especaill Isaac(john  franklin)Hannah(Nataile Ramsey) and Gabriel (? ). So get some popcorn sit  back oh and leave the lite on!,947203200,15,1157,4.176470588235294
1043636,4,6305538085,"Although all of the COTC movies seem to skirt around Steven King's truly brilliant short story, this one and the first come the closest.  The original and part 6 are the only two movies that really seem to go  together.
I think that Dimension films has brought a whole new edge to  the cheap horror flick, and COTC has benefited.
Great twist at the end,  great twist to the orginal story throughout (I don't want to give the  suprise away - although you may guess it early on).
Paul Popowich is  one actor I would definately like to see more from in the future.",945388800,2,561,4.346153846153846
1043637,1,6305538085,"I am a fan of the original Children of the Corn, and for the life of me I can't figure out how the five sequels could be so poor, for one, and for two, so poor, and yet have so many fans.  I'm dumbfounded.  This movie is terrible!  I can't find the words to express how truly awful this movie is.
It begins with a young girl, Hannah, who is traveling back to Gatlin to  find her birth mother.  (Incidentally, they have the location of Gatlin all  wrong -- It's not the original town.)  On the way, her car breaks down and  some old man, who has absolutely nothing to do with the movie, reads her  some strange passage out of the Bible, then mysteriously disappears.
She  gets to Gatlin, and we find that Isaac didn't die like he, well, DID in the  first one, but rather has simply been in a deep coma for the last  twenty-odd years.  Hannah's mere touch awakens him, of course.  And here's  Isaac, once again, to wreak havoc on the sleepy little town of Gatlin as he  once did before.  But wait.  I'm confused!  Isaac is an adult now...  Shouldn't he be sacrificed to He Who Walk Behind the Rows?  Is Isaac  suddenly immune to what he taught?  Also, since when did the children in  the original reproduce?  Isn't that supposed to be a great sin?
Well, I  won't give any spoilers, but I will warn you:  This entire movie is full of  continuity blunders and, above all....The story is absolutely weak.  I saw this movie in the hopes that it would  be the one COTC sequel that I would enjoy.  As it turns out, it's the worst  one yet....Save your money on this one and buy a  better movie.  This one is horrible.",944611200,9,1609,4.253333333333333
1043729,2,6305538085,"This is like arriving in the middle of a film and trying to figure out the story. I did not see any of the preceding Corn movies which, presumably, provided the framework within this  episode fits....or maybe not. At any rate, if you are in my position, I would recommend skipping this one until you have seen some of the preceding ones. If you accept the magic  premises, the story is simple enough: girl comes to a small town in the middle of nowhere to find her birth mother. How she knew where to look we do not know. She has some spooky experiences and ends up in a hospital of some sort which seems to be run somewhat along the lines of a 17th century insane asylum (as they were called then). Here we come to the highlight of the film: she meets Stacy Keach, the only performer I know of in the picture. He plays a guy who appears to be the  physician (?) in charge; we quickly learn that he drinks and smokes heavily. Finally, drifting aimlessly through the hospital, she sees a patient who is barely alive; thias is the Isaac of the title, as we later learn. From there it goes downhill, with frightening experiences, meeting young men, staying in a Motel out of Hitchcock, and various other events of which I better not write. At any rate, she is given a hard time........
At its best, the film resembles an episode of a creaky television series with a continuing story. It begins and ends up in the air. If you must see everything connected with Stephen King or every episode of the Corn series, then, of course, you will see this regardless of anything anyone says. For the others, I cannot recommend it, but, if you want a short (hour and 25 minutes roughly) movie that will not give you nightmares, but will fill the time, this could do, if the cost is minimal.",1370304000,,1775,4.372727272727273
1043730,3,6305538085,"This was probably the best written out of all of the Children of the Corn movies, however it really didn't fit with the storyline. First of all, there weren't any children in it, (except for Issac) there weren't any recurring characters, and there was even a steamy sex scene?! It was entertaining and very well written, but it wasn't your typical Children of The Corn movie. I have to admit, I was kind of disappointed.",1361664000,,420,4.613333333333333
1043731,3,6305538085,"CHILDREN OF THE CORN 666
ISSAC'S RETURN

After watching the first ""Children of the Corn"" this past month I decided I would sit all the way through the entire series. That included 8 films and 1 remake and over all I think they were all just your average horror flicks. Some better than others but none were classics. Any way this one is actually the sixth film and the second to feature evil cult leader Isaac. That is the most appealing thing about this, well there is the twist at the end that was kinda cool.

Hannah is traveling to Gatlin to find her mother and learn about her history in this town. Turns out she is a child from the original children that plagued Gatlin. On the way there she picks up a man who starts to preach and warn her about things to come. He then disappears and she crashes into a corn field only to be picked up by a police officer who takes her to the town hospital. In town she learns more and more about the town and its strange people and history. These people include a comatose Isaac, the original leader of the cult and a young man who seems to be befriending her.

Now for any one that has not seen this I will tell you right now that this one does not feature children running around killing adults. In fact it is the adults who are the killers here since they are the kids all grown up. I will admit that when this film first came out I was excited for it, the idea behind is a good one. Unfortunately it ends up being a average film in a average series for the most part. I did like that Isaac was brought back but that along with so much more does not make sense if you have seen the other films. Then again it is a horror film and a COTC flick at that.

Speaking of the returning Isaac the man playing him John Franklin also co wrote the script with Tim Sulka, this is the last thing they have written if I am correct. At least the direction here seemed on point thanks to Kari Skogland who went on to direct much better things including her latest, an episode of ""Boardwalk Empire"". The other thing I liked here was the little twist at the end, I know some who didn't like it but I kinda did.

In the end I would say that the film deserves some of the hate it gets but there are some good things to find here. In fact it is a COTC flick so people should have expected some of the cheesy stuff to be honest. Was it a mistake to bring Isaac back, when looking at the other films and wanting to make sense, yes. But being a B horror movie I think for the most part it was ok. My question though is this, why didn't they bring back Malachi? Also I would have loved if this film had a commentary from John, Tim, and Kari or John and Tim at least.",1354492800,2,2686,4.079545454545454

1043785,1,6305538085,"Where to begin, I have no clue. A talentless pool of unknown actors assemble together and do their best to act their way to an undeserved paycheck. The script was juvenile and the acting was just as bad. It is only appropriate that bad acting be accompanied by bad dialogue, don't ya think? There was some unintended comic relief in this messy film. Guess what folks, Isaac returns and he is a midget with a whiney voice. I almost felt bad for Isaac for having been in a coma for so many years only to survive as a silly looking buffoon. I couldn't help but laugh every time poor Isaac had something philisophical to mutter. Utter nonesense and not scary one bit. The whole movie is trash. Oh geez, why do is waste my time.",1139011200,2,723,4.362962962962963
1043786,2,6305538085,"Well, looks like I'm about done with this.  The past two viewing tend to suggest that I'd have been better off if I'd stopped with 4, but then I would just spent the remainder of my life wondering what might have been.  Much like in 5, I don't know if their is anything too terribly grating or stunningly incompetent about the film as a whole, it's just rather uneventful and fairly dull.  As you may have surmised, Isaac is back, and he's still a jerk. This is kinda fun, but John Franklin's mere presence isn't worth too much, and he really doesn't do much of anything.  Another plus is that the film is occasionally slightly atmospheric.  Only occasionally, and only very slightly, but it's somethin'.  Unfortunately, CotC 666 lacks the laugh out loud hilarity of the better portions of 2 and 3, and the slightly intriguing plot and decent gore of 4.  So, we aren't left with much.  The climax is passably involving, and amusingly nonsensical, but overall it's a long journey to nowhere.  That, and where's the killing?  This film has only got a single sexy teen, rather than a pack of them, so we have very few preliminary killings. (Well, the protagonists in the CotC films usually weren't very sexy, but you get my meaning.)  A few of those would've spiced things up substantially, but this is all we got.

I had an okay time watching this, but I really can't think of any reason why you ought to see it unless you have some bizarre compulsion to see all the CotC films. Not that I'd know anything about that.

1043787,2,6305538085,"No other author in recent memory has had as much consistent success selling books as Stephen King. For roughly three decades the Maine writer churned out book after book, each one selling more and more copies. He's a world unto himself, the lucky fellow! He's so successful that he could throw out his pens, put away his typewriters, bury his word processor six feet under, never write another word in his life, and STILL have enough money to wallpaper the Great Wall of China five times over. In many respects, it's Stephen King's world and the rest of us are just living in it. But, and this is a gigantic but, an enormous number of metaphysically bad films based on his novels threaten to put a serious dent in his legacy. We all know the good ones, the ones that not only scared audiences stiff but also helped propel King's career to even greater heights. ""Carrie"" is probably the best example, followed by ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Dead Zone."" These are wonderful, magical films that one can watch again and again without wearying of them. Then there are the rest: the truly wretched refuse that reminds one of dental plaque or the junk that washes up on the shores of a filthy river. Welcome to the Children of the Corn franchise.

""Children of the Corn 666: Isaac's Return"" introduces us to Hannah (Natalie Ramsey), a young lady heading back to the now infamous Gatlin, Nebraska in order to answer some important personal questions: why am I drawn to a town out in the sticks? Who is my mother and where is she? Will accepting this role in a schlock, straight to video clunker enhance my career opportunities? You can quickly grasp the metaphysical importance of such ponderings. In quick succession, Hannah runs into a string of problems. Pushy town cop Cora (Alix Koromzay) gives her sass before she even arrives in town. Doc Michaels (Stacy Keach), the town quack, insists on imprinting his own weird impressions on the girl. But the most bizarre occurrence confronting Hannah during her first visit to Gatlin is the sight of a short man hooked up to a slew of machines in a hospital. This figure is none other than Isaac (John Franklin), the original apostle of ""He Who Walks Behind the Rows"" in the first film. Apparently, the boyish preacher did not perish at the end of ""Children of the Corn,"" although it sure looked like it then, but slipped into a deep coma that has rendered him helpless for all these years. The arrival of Hannah, however, fulfills an old prophecy that will see Isaac out of his coma and possibly bring about a reemergence of the corn demon.

""Children of the Corn 7: Revelation"" is apparently the end of the road (row?) for one of the most unlikely horror film franchises in history. Once again, another hapless female falls prey to the malevolent corn cult and its evil machinations. On this outing the individual in question is Jamie (Claudette Mink), a young professional who heads to the Midwest to check up on her ailing grandmother at Hampton Arms, a condemned structure housing a host of miscreants and other assorted characters. Grandma disappears immediately before Jamie arrives at the building, so the young lady decides to stay in the old woman's apartment in an effort to discover the causes of the disappearance. Jamie runs into a lot of opposition to her various inquiries right from the start. Armbrister (Kyle Cassidy), a cop at the police station, initially doesn't take her missing person's report seriously. A visit to a few of the neighbors in the building doesn't pan out at first, either. The resident stoner Jerry (Troy Yorke) is so out of it an a regular basis that he couldn't tell Jamie what time it is let alone what happened to her grandmother. Then there is Tiffany (Crystal Lowe), a woman who works at the local gentleman's club, who is friendly but generally unable to help. What happened to grandma? Lots of bodies and a few ""revelations"" help explain the whole thing.

""Children of the Corn 666"" is such a mess of a film that it easily ranks as the worst entry in the franchise. So many characters parade past the screen, from Gabriel (Paul Popowich) to Jake (William Prael) to a dozen others that it's impossible to keep it all straight. Only the presence of the attractive Natalie Ramsey and the very gorgeous Sydney Bennet in the role of cranky Morgan help keep this film down on stomachs made queasy with banalities. John Franklin, who also co-wrote the script, doesn't do much beyond what he did in the first film. Sure, he issues the usual biblical mumbo jumbo pronouncements to adoring audiences, but his middle age mug and rougher voice tell us this isn't the Isaac we remember from the first film. ""Children of the Corn 7"" is only a tad better. The only memorable scene in this film involves a storekeeper's head sitting in a freezer. This movie spends more time building the characters and trying to imbue the picture with creepy atmosphere, with decidedly mixed results. ""Revelation"" does give us Michael Ironside in what amounts to a totally useless cameo as a priest investigating the corn cult.

The disc for ""666"" contains no supplements. Extras for ""Revelation"" consist of trailers for parts four, five, and six of ""Children of the Corn,"" ""Mimic 2,"" ""Dracula 2000,"" ""Halloween: H20,"" and ""Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers."" Perhaps ""Revelation"" is a fitting end to the ""Children of the Corn"" franchise, but the only revelation I received after watching the final two films is that the whole series should have ended much sooner. Never say never again, however, when dealing with a story from Stephen King. The corn cult may yet return!",1104019200,2,5638,4.761758691206544

As ""Children of the Corn 666"" progresses, not so much in a linear manner but in a serious of jerky fits and starts capable of inducing whiplash in the viewer, more of the ""storyline"" emerges for our consumption. It appears that many worshippers of ""He Who Walks Behind the Rows"" survived the Peter Horton induced apocalypse at the end of the first film and grew up. They've been waiting all these years--raising their own children and acting like responsible adults--for Isaac to awaken from his slumber and call forth the demon. Why? I don't know. Since cult members always considered anyone over the age of eighteen the enemy, I can't imagine why grown people would welcome the malevolent corn god with open arms. Wouldn't he just pop up out of the earth and rip every person with age wrinkles and five o'clock shadow into bloody pulp? The whole subplot involving Hannah's reunion with her mother Rachel (Nancy Allen) withers when confronted with fundamental questions the movie refuses to ask, let alone answer. It should go without saying that numerous individuals find the idea of a possible Isaac/corn devil reconciliation an unpalatable situation. These are the people who end up on the wrong end of scythes and other sharp objects.

What we have here is such a mess of a film that it easily ranks as the worst entry in the franchise. So many characters parade past the screen, from Gabriel (Paul Popowich) to Jake (William Prael) to a dozen others that it's impossible to keep it all straight.

Sure, he issues the usual biblical mumbo jumbo pronouncements to adoring audiences, but his middle age mug and rougher voice tell us this isn't the Isaac we remember from the first film. Is it possible for the chief apostle of a demon to collect Social Security checks, particularly when said demon makes it a point to hype the virtues of youth? Like I wrote earlier, there are more questions here than answers. By the time the film shudders to a halt, all I could bring myself to praise was the gore, and there is precious little of that floating around compared to other entries in the series.

The DVD contains no extras, which is just as well because that would require the viewer to spend more time with this no account film. I suggest you skip, forget, overlook, reject, condemn, avoid, cast off, jettison, exile, dump, burn, pass over, disregard, denounce, discard, and abandon ""Children of the Corn 666"" as quickly as possible. Rearrange your sock drawer, change the furnace filters in your house, or reattach those plastic thingies to your shoelaces--do anything you can think of to avoid this atrocity. If you must see it, good luck and may god be with you.",1103932800,9,5540,4.720041322314049
1043789,5,6305538085,"To be honest, I rented this out of sheer desperation a couple of years ago, having seen virtually every other horror movie for rent in town (this was before everybody started stocking a dozen new horror titles a month, a welcome development).  I'd seen 2 or 3 of the earlier installments and not been impressed and given up on the series.  I'm not trying to bash them, I know alot of people really love the whole series, but the original and the first sequel just didn't do anything for me personally.  I'm not sure whether I even saw ""Urban Harvest"" or not -  I guess I couldn't have cared for it too much if I did.  But I took a chance on this one, breaking my own rule of Never skipping ahead in a series (3, 4 and 5 weren't available) and was certainly glad I did.

  Very few times have I gone into a movie with such low expectations and been so totally blown away in surprise.  ""Children Of The Corn 666: Isaac's Return"" is an absolute treasure find!  It involves a young woman in search of her past and ending up in the farm town central to the series, notorious for events that happened there previously.  The town's cult of children are apparantly in remission, maintaining a facade of normalcy in a community where adults now live as well, the children of the cult biding their time and waiting for some kind of promised dark messiah.  I don't really know how closely this fits into the overall series continuity; after seeing this I decided to see all the other chapters but have only seen the follow-up, ""Revelation"", a good movie but not on par with this one and quite unconnected to it.  The previous chapters can't be found for rent and I've already decided I'm going to have to eventually buy them sight unseen (the only reason I haven't done so yet is there are about 500 other movies on my personal 'waiting-to-be-bought' list) but haven't seen them yet, so I don't know if everything fits together or not.

  A soaring high point of the movie is a romantic angle which I won't go into too much here, occuring as it does later in the movie.  It includes one tremendously sexy scene that achieves its appeal not by being especially overt (not that I'm opposed to other, more openly sexy scenes in different movies), but through the high romanticism and beautiful tenderness.  And yes, the female character's limited clothing in the scene certainly doesn't hurt things either, although it would have been gorgeous even without that added benefit.

  Intelligent, suspenseful, and well-acted, this is highly recommended for either longtime fans of the series or those who (like me) never were into it before.  I might even give the original another try someday and see if there's something there I missed.  My only grievance is the ending - this isn't giving anything away, but it could have gone in either of two directions and I would have preferred the road they didn't take.  That's purely subjective and doesn't mean the final minutes weren't just as well realized as the rest of the movie.  I hope there's a direct followup to this entry with the same characters - the next sequel was a totally different path and different people.  Still good, but this one is awesome.",1103328000,7,3190,4.591872791519434
1043790,1,6305538085,"Before I watched the film, I already had an excellent plotline going on. First, I rumored that Isaac would return yes, and then try to gether his once followers and basically realizes that He Who Walks Behind The Rows does not exist and his talk was nothing but a bunch of lies, and rebels against his own religion. And in the end he burns the corn down and in the background Of course, it did not go that way at all. The plotline was stupid, about a girl named Hannah who wishes to know the whereabouts of her mother and goes to Gatlin. The plotline didn't make sense, the clues to find her mom went nowhere and truely the writers were probably stumped themselves, even though the clues were going to the hole, she still found out about her mother. And by our future series, we know what was going to happen to Isaac. But the plot could've been better, don't you agree?  the whole movie should be a remake. The Gore scenes were weak and the movie felt like a boring History lecture. The only ""good"" parts of the film was in the ending where they start to kill each other off. And what was up with that old man who had nothing to do with the movie? Seriously, people, my thought on the movie was better then this mess. It was just a movie made to burn off money. Even Stephen King could've shaken his head at this. It simply killed off and made a bad movie out of a wonderful King talent. Too bad that King never directed or wrote the screeplay. For all I know, he could've spiced up the film or gave it a new meaning.
The acting was alright and that alone sorta ""Saved"" the film, but honestly if this was a COTC film, where the hell were the children? Sure, I saw this odd kid but that was it.

For a slasher/horror flick their's not much killing or gore... untilt he very end.  So you have to sit through an hour and a half of hilariously confusing monologues to get to the good stuff.  The sotry doesn't make sense and the acting is ridiculously over the top (this is Children of the Corn part 6, not Schindler's List).  Watch parts 2, 3, and 7... those are fun, gory, entertaining, well made (ok 3 and 7's FX (...)) flicks.  Avoid this film like the plague.",1068422400,3,561,4.4411764705882355

I liked it, but it wasn't as exciting as the rest and way better then COTC 7. But all in all I loved it!",1055289600,2,413,3.9879518072289155

If it weren't for the fact that I am very liberal with the way I view movies I would never of have picked this up.  Here is the basic idea, the children form the first are grown up.  In the mean time the daughter of one of the origional children returns to find her birth mother.  The birth Mother is played by Nancy Allen for a whole 15 20 minutes.  Issac also returns to raise hell.  There is a new prophecy, the first son and the first daughter of the origional children will mate and then he who walks behind the rows will be reborn.

The first thirty (of the 82 short minutes) minutes of the film actually brought me in the mood, more than the average film. Scary isn't it? Then it becomes a little boring, and the last minutes are clich&eacute;s...The directing was pretty amazing for what I expected, and it is partly responsible for the nice atmosphere. The main actress sounded a little like those high-school-superficial-cheerleaders (What kind of stupid expression is that???) and looked like them...the storyline is pretty stupid though...and very simple...but I have to say that this film corresponds a lot more to the ""Horror movie"" kind than most movies that are classified as Horror movies. I almost feel guilty saying all this...but it's true. Too bad most of the actors were bad, the scenario was stupid and the ending very clich&eacute;, because the first impression it gives you is that you'll be scared from the beginning to the end...not true...and only the fact that this impression is there gives points to this film.

Not nearly as good as 2 (my favorite) or the original, but better than the past few. Maybe it's just because Isaac was in it, or maybe it's because the movie didn't have any really dumb special effects (what ruined 3 for me); whatever it was, I'm now hoping that 7 can do something with this series, maybe end it!

7890975,2,6305538085,"I will give ""Children of the Corn 666: Isaac's Return"" credit for attempting to get this series back to it's roots. ""Isaac's Return"" is a direct sequel to the original three films in this series, yes, John Franklin as Isaac is back, and they reference Rachel, who was seen pregnant in the first film when her lover/husband Amos willing sacrificed himself to He Who Walks Behind the Rows. This film is set in Gatlin, Nebraska, the same as the first, and the town of Hemingford where events from Part 2 took place gets a mention. And finally the book written by Isaac which was used in ""Urban Harvest"" is mentioned.

As the film opens, we meet Hannah, Rachel's grown daughter from the first film and the first child born of the Gatlin kids. Hannah is on her way back to Gatlin to find her birth mother, but along the way she begin suffering from odd visions and she crashes...into a corn field naturally. Taken to the local hospital in Gatlin, Rachel meets Dr. Miichaels (Stacy Keach) who fills her in on the ""true"" events which occured in Gatlin. Hannah soon learns that Isaac is still alive, but in a coma.

Hannah sneaks off for a quick peek at Isaac only to have him awaken wearing green contact lenses. She soon had visions of him stalking the halls of the hospital in a bathrobe and using a walker to get around!?!? Hannah meets some wacky towns people and every time someone gets near a corn field, kids magically appear, and after a whole lot of not much, Hannah is reunited with her mom, and she soon learns she's part of a prophecy to bring back He Who Walks Behind the Rows and....blah, blah, blah.

And as first seen in Part V, ""Nebraska""'s mountain range is showcased, they even feature a repeated shot of the sun breaking over the mountain tops?? The only thing worse than California trying to pass for Nebraska was the green contact lenses the give Isaac. No wonder he's mad, he's been in 20-year coma and never took out his contacts...his eyes must be itchy as all get out?

Honestly, I think there is a nugget of a good story here. I liked the idea of Isaac coming back, but why they make him so frail and toothless is beyond me? He was a creepy little dude in the first film, and here you worry that he'll break a hip walking through the corn. Once He Who Walks Behind The Rows finally shows up, I'm embarrassed for him. For some reason they decide to give him the personality of a Wacky Morning DJ.

Boring, not scary, and just dull. If there were any teeth left in this series they've been pulled and replaced with dentures at this point. I'm really hoping part 7 can give me something more enjoyabel, even if it's a so-bad-it's-good something.",1402617600,2,2662,4.457905544147844
