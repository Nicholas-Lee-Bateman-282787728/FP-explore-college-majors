8186069,5,B000OPOCIC,"My two-year-old loves all things Sesame Street and Elmo and this is no exception. The program is like most Sesame Street programs and does a great job helping young children learn what to expect in school.  After discussing what graduation means, two characters reminisce about their first day of school, their feelings, and how they solved a conflict with the help of their teacher. Elmo convinces Alan to play school with him with some humorous results, especially when an elephant shows up to learn to rhyme. Baby Bear tells about his feelings of missing his family on his first day of school and the strategy he learned to deal with his apprehension.  It is a fun, educational show that my daughter enjoys watching over and over.",1451606400,,733,4.809523809523809

8186077,2,B000OPOCIC,"(1.5/5 stars)  In this video, some of Elmo's Sesame Street friends tell him all about the wonders of school, such as learning to share and listening to the teacher sing the alphabet song. It is not an exaggeration to state that is as exciting as this video gets. It all begins with a halting start as Gabi and Miles, two of the kids who grew up on Sesame Street, get ready to graduate high school. This provides the cause for them to reminisce about their first day of school, which they proceed to do in excruciating detail. Then, it's Baby Bear's turn to recall his first day of school, where Mother Goose was the teacher. There was potential here for something interesting to happen because Baby Bear's classmates are characters from Mother Goose rhymes. Unfortunately, that is where development of the concept ends since the characters are given nothing fun to do or say. The one idea that is somewhat cute is Hansel and Gretel act like Hans and Franz, the Kevin Nealon and Dana Carvey characters who mimicked Arnold Schwarzenegger on Saturday Night Live about twenty years ago. Any apparent cleverness in this idea is probably lost on the intended audience, since pre-schoolers likely have no idea who Hans and Franz, let alone the Governator, are.

The folks behind Sesame Street are normally reliable for producing educational material that also happens to be entertaining for both children and adults. It is not apparent to me what they were thinking when producing this video because the entertainment value is almost non-existent. Aside from ""The Alphabet Song,"" which is sung by Gabi and Miles' human teacher, the only other song is ""Elmo's Off to School."" Kids might know this from Elmo's ""Greatest Hits"" CD, though they might not stay awake long enough to make it to the segment where he sings it. Additionally, there aren't any classic Sesame Street clips, new animation clips or merriment of any other sort to break the monotony of these sketches. This video is as dull as dull can be. I'll give them a half star for trying something different and one star for the educational value, but awarding two out of five stars would be too generous.",1198022400,2,2156,4.793010752688172
