8554378,5,B00AMXFRRQ,"Barenboim and Mehta are in fine humor throughout this concert. As usual, Barenboim's pianism is excellent, and his demeanor on this special occasion is worth witnessing. So is Mehta's expressive face and posture. A treat in all respects. I've heard better Tchaikovsky concerto-playing and better recording of the deep strings in some passages, but the concert is great.",1403222400,,369,5.379310344827586
8554379,5,B00AMXFRRQ,"The Tchaikovsky is a revelation---a little lest bravura and a little more intelligence.  A unique approach to such a familiar work. The man who has recorded all 32 Beethoven sonatas is ideally suited to do the concerti, one of which is included here.  I can do without the Elliot Carter---why not a Chopin concerto, but it is still a great set",1384041600,2,343,4.60655737704918
8554380,5,B00AMXFRRQ,"It was rare privelege to be present at the Daniel Barenboim ""70th Birthday Concert""
As they say,the ""Old Firm""of Barenboim and Mehta ""Triumphs Again""
This was especially true of the Tchaikovsky First Piano Concerto
i have never heard the Maestro play it before,either on Disc or Live.
Quite a Revelation!",1379203200,4,304,5.1
8554381,5,B00AMXFRRQ,"With family and friends present, Daniel Barenboim celebrates his seventieth birthday in the company of Zubin Mehta, and the Staatskapelle Berlin. He starts with Beethoven's Piano Concerto in C minor (No. 3) and ends with Tchaikovsky's Piano No. 1 with an Eliot Carter short atonal piece sandwiched between. Both the Beethoven and Tchaikovsky are exquisitely and passionately performed by Barenboim as he commands the piano and dazzles the audience. The structural composition of each comes alive; especially in the 2nd movement of the Tchaikovsky Concerto when the beautiful Claudia Stein opens with a sad flute introduction repeated by the piano. One marvels at the nuance of the Russian composition played an Argentine Israeli with a German orchestra conducted by a man born in Bombay.  Mehta in his marvelous laconic way might be seen as the onlooker but the generous Barenboim does not allow it. He brings in Mehta and makes him part of it at all times. These are two masters performing, enjoying the music and the moment together.

If you have Barenboim's Beethoven Piano Concertos with the Staatkapelle at the 2007 Klavierfest Ruhr, then this DVD is your visit with old friends. The warmth between conductor and orchestra is real and palpable and adds to the splendor of this musical feast. Barenboim and Mehta, two old pals, eye winking, humorously gasping and nodding together at various times and notes like two peas in an exquisite musical pod.  After each piece, Barenboim embraces Mehta, hugs him and drags the reluctant Mehta to the adoring crowd as if to say ""this may be my night, but this applause is for you too, come with me, old friend."" Barenboim's warmth and congeniality extends to his orchestra; to Concertmaster Wolf Batzdorf and to the glorious woodwinds, especially to the wonderful Gregor Witt, oboist extraordinaire.

Saving the best for last; at the end, after three tumultuous electric calls, a visibly surprised Barenboim, is bussed while being presented with a rose by each of the women members of the Staatkapelle. The DVD radiates warmth and the charming personality of this impresario, one of the best in classical performances, who dominates the evening. Added to the aural beauty of Beethoven and Tchaikovsky is the visual, the moment to be seen and felt; the precious human element.

One of the previous reviewers comments that he was at the concert; what luck, what a night to revisit !!",1373932800,17,2426,5.055
8554382,5,B00AMXFRRQ,Daniel Barenboim has memorized the greatest piano concertos.  He plays so effortlessly.  I buy his recordings reguarly.  He seems like such a friendly person.  Seventy years old is just another milestone in his career.,1372032000,6,218,5.323529411764706
8554383,5,B00AMXFRRQ,"I would recommend this DVD to every music makers/lovers. It is the best lesson in every aspects of piano playing. Phrasing, tone production, sobriety, style etc. It is the combination of the best pianist turned great conductor.",1368748800,8,227,5.162162162162162
8554384,5,B00AMXFRRQ,"I was at this concert. I have also seen the TV coverage of it which, I am sure, the DVD was based on and ordered this but have not viewed it yet.

It was a wonderful evening in which Barenboim, Mehta and the Staatskapelle all rose to the occasion. The rapport between the two old friends was apparent. Barenboim played a few encores and came out for multiple bows at the end, obviously not wanting the evening to be over. Throw in music that everyone will love (OK, the Carter is a new piece, but it is short)and you have an ideal concert DVD.",1363132800,8,543,4.221153846153846
