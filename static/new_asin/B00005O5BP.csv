7948206,4,B00005O5BP,"Was able to see this again last night as a preliminary to San Diego Cinema Society kick off event for 2008.  Very funny, keeps you guessing, and if only it were true.  Wonderful acting and actors in this entertaining short film.  I'm buying a copy.",1220400000,2,248,4.466666666666667

7948208,5,B00005O5BP,"I saw this short film at the Telluride Film Festival. It was shown in a section with other short films and this was by far the audience favorite. The audience roared with laughter and gave a standing ovation at the end (the ending was really special; the story made sort of a crescendo to the end). It's amazing to me that the writer could tell such a funny story in 10 minutes. Bravo! The story is a witty take on the age-old adult ""peep show"" places. The story is not offensive at all, for men nor women, no nudity, but the humor is geared to adults who have some knowledge of these sorts of places. It's a very funny movie. If you are looking for a hearty laugh, I strongly recommend this one.",1207526400,,696,4.2406015037593985
7948209,5,B00005O5BP,"I saw this when it ran on cable a couple years ago - a really funny short film!  A woman enters a Peep Show where men SAY all the things women really want to hear, but never get to.  There are alot of good gags along the way and a hilarious ending.  Very clever - why can't Hollywood make movies this funny?!",1061510400,8,308,3.935483870967742
