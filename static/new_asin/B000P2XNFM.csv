8188689,3,B000P2XNFM,"I have 9 other Petra workouts, have been working out at home for over 25 years, and cannot recommend this DVD.
It is 75 minutes long, broken into 6 segments; Warm-up, Upper Body, Lower Body, Total Body, Core, and Cool-Down.  It requires a medicine ball, 2 sets of exercise tubing, a step, a mat, and various hand weights.
The warm-up uses the medicine ball, so the potential for pulling something straight out of the gate is a possibility.  Several minutes in she instructs you to turn your upper body to each side, the muscles are not yet warm and the possibility of back injury or strain is there.
The Upper and Lower Body segments are done using the tubing, which due to carpal tunnel I cannot use, but she offers a weight alternative.  Unfortunately she doesn't cue to tell you what muscles you'll be working, she begins the exercise standing and using the tube while you scramble to get your bench, mat and weights, and get laid out on the step.
I did the entire workout and barely got warm.  There is no aerobic component, just weight work.  The Core and Cool-Down sections were inefficient and incomplete.",1421712000,,1112,4.624365482233503
