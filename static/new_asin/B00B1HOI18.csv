The video it self, didn't learn any more then what I/We already knew. Interesting to watch.
Came with a music disk as well, haven't heard it yet. I have the book and this DVD is a very condensed version.
Didn't know what to expect yet not bad watching it either. Does make for some fun though.",1361923200,,384,4.273972602739726
