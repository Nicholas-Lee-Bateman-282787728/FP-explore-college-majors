2080527,5,B0002DSPZW,"For general maintenance there is absolutely no better power yoga DVD than Baron Baptiste's Long & Lean Yoga.  The reason behind this claim I am making can be summed up in one word - timing.  Before I became interested in yoga, I spent years at the gym lifting weights.  After studying Ashtanga and purchasing a number of less balanced yoga tapes and DVD's, my introduction to this simple but physically challenging workout has made me feel stronger and look better than any other hatha program.  I know it doesn't have every asana in the world and is a little heavy on the boat pose, but when I am done, I feel strong, alert, and ready to begin my day.  I really enjoy Baron's added upper body workout, his sequence of primary standing, power poses, and his quick but efficient abdominal routine.  Most importantly, something in the pacing of this sequence makes me breathe deep and sweat.  I have memorized this routine and when I travel, this is the power yoga set I do.",1143072000,25,972,4.583815028901734
2080528,5,B0002DSPZW,I have tried about a dozen of yoga dvd. And this one stands out as one of the best exercise DVD I have seen. Some of the moves are Challenging; but that is needed for a good workout.,1136332800,4,182,3.8157894736842106
2080529,5,B0002DSPZW,"If you are looking for a challenging yoga dvd.. this is it. Baron's latest in the Vinyasa Flow style we have all come to know, expect and love from Baron. There is a new strength sequence in the series... its incredible. Challenging. Men will love this DVD... for its challenge... Women for Barons graceful and soothing style. The message is a clear one...be who you are completely and fully.. .in your poses, on your mat, and in your life!!! My all time fav Baron DVD.",1127952000,23,469,4.529411764705882
2080530,4,B0002DSPZW,"If you own Baron's ""soul of strength"" or ""journey into power"" there's nothing really new here.  Some poses are held longer, and there's more focus on upper body & core strength.  this dvd seems more ""western"" not as much attention to going within, not much of a relaxation segment.  I'll return to this from time because I really like Baron's style but it's at the bottom of my pile.",1093737600,40,383,4.521739130434782
2080531,5,B0002DSPZW,"I love this video. Yes, Baron is chatty as others have said, but it's nice because you don't have to stare at the screen to know what is coming next. I am in decent shape and the upper body portion of this workout is kicking my upper body booty! It is the perfect length at 50 minutes. Just when I start to wonder how much longer, he is wrapping it up. I would definitely recommend this video. I see a difference in my arms, abs and butt after using it for just a few weeks.",1310428800,2,474,4.0
2080532,4,B0002DSPZW,"I will admit, I got bit by the yoga bug a few years ago when we got our wii fit, unfortunately the stop go between each exercise gave me a good work out, but I really wanted the flow of an actual workout. I thought about buying a DVD but was nervous about trying one. All the classes at my local gyms (I've checked several) do not fit in with my schedule so I thought DVDs would be my answer. I started reading reviews (keep in mind I am a TRUE beginner, but HIGHLY/naturally flexible), and came across one that said something about trying yoga DVDs out on netflix... whoa what? Netflix has workout videos?! Yes, and this was one of a few that I tried, and I liked it so much I moved it to #1 of my instant queue and will definitely use again and again. I like how he emphasizes that not everyone will be on the same level and shows many easier modifications to the more difficult poses. As he suggested when the workout got to be too much (I like an idiot decided to attempt this right before lunch after skipping breakfast so became a little lightheaded, my own fault) I paused, relaxed and started it up again a minute or two later. He says it's important to stick with it even if you can't do everything right the first time, in time you will, and I'm sure he's right, but it's nice as a beginner to be encouraged, instead of made to feel like you SHOULD know this and be able to do it. I thought the flow was a little fast, but for the most part kept up, I'm sure after I get the swing of the movements (in a day or two) I will be able to keep up just fine. I am also sure as I continue to strengthen my body will still be challenged for quite sometime (I DID have to use some of the easier modifications and hope to be able to do them properly soon).
My biggest complaint about this is while he emphasized breathing he wasn't always clear which movement went with the enhale or exhale, and should have reminded the audience to do so more frequently (as I have experienced with other beginning videos). I found too often I had to take extra/rushed breaths to sync a movement with what his instructions said to do and it left me behind and then rushed. I suggest if you have the patience, watching the video first to know what to expect next (as it is often hard to watch his models and do the exercises properly)... but this is a problem I've seen with a LOT of yoga DVDs, can't turn your head to see when your body is twisted and contorted in ways you didn't even know you could bend!
At the end of the video I was sweaty (he says it's my body cleansing itself of toxins... I'll remember that next time my kids tell me I stink after a workout), and felt as if I had a GOOD workout, WITHOUT that feeling of oh no I'm going to hate myself later because I can't move. I'll probably sleep like a rock tonight and be no worse for wear. I feel no tightness in my body (no pulled muscles or stiff joints) like I have had in the past starting a new workout program. I wish he would have taken a little bit more time at the end to ""wind down"" and stretch to relax.
OVERALL: I thought it was pretty good for me, I will use it again, and would recommend it to anyone who hasn't (and those who HAVE) tried yoga before!",1306368000,3,3212,4.11624203821656
2080533,4,B0002DSPZW,"I would say this dvd is a great program, its a very good challenge for  beginners. It holds poses longer wish increases strenght and stamina. The down side of this is that it really has virtually no inner yoga or really much of a spiritual practice in it.",1296172800,,255,4.3125
2080534,5,B0002DSPZW,"We have this on Netflix and for the past month I've been doing it twice a week while the nanny watches my kids.  It's Me-time when I put this video on.  I get a great work out, feel wonderful afterward, and always look forward to the next time I do it.

This is my first regular yoga work out and I thoroughly enjoy it.  I have recommended this to other people, and I am getting my husband to join me.  He is a runner but only does some leg stretches.  This would really help him, I believe.

Recommend!",1295222400,,503,4.071428571428571
2080535,5,B0002DSPZW,"I love love this workout. I have been practicing yoga for the past couple of years. I regularly attend a yoga class which emphasizes on balance stability and lean strength. this is like an extension of that class. On the days that i don't have my class, i work out at home with this tape.
This video is not for beginners. some level of yoga practice is required to know the poses. As a novice may not know clearly how to get into upward dog, downward dog, chaduranga etc.
even if you are unable to get into the asanas completely, over practice one should be able to do better.",1293062400,2,576,4.293577981651376
2080536,5,B0002DSPZW,"I would consider myself an intermediate-advanced yoga student.  This class is well suited for an intermediate to advanced student.  There are some advanced balancing poses and the sun salutations are sure heat your body.  This video would not be for a beginning yoga student as the balancing poses may be discouraging and the sun salutations require a good amount of stamina and strength.  However, if you are a serious yoga student, this video definitely meets the criteria.  I enjoyed it immensely and felt very energized afterwards.",1274745600,,535,5.174418604651163
2080537,2,B0002DSPZW,"Not that a yoga video has to be super entertaining...It just has to be interesting enough to keep me watching.

There are a couple of nice challenging poses in this video -however, watching this trainer hover over the yoga models and give boring, vague instructions is just difficult to watch more than one time.",1267142400,,312,4.777777777777778
2080538,2,B0002DSPZW,"Yes Baron Batiste is a great teacher but I was very dissapointed with this Dvd, it has had many rave reviews however I found this dvd lacking in originality.
I also found the adjustments and touching of his female yoga models unnecessary.",1207180800,2,238,4.690476190476191
2080539,3,B0002DSPZW,"Baron Baptiste was clear & easy to follow while using 2 women to demonstrate the poses & modifications. The set is minimal but the music was very forgettable, a basic beat, kinda rock, but not conducive for either relaxing or for inspiring you to move more & very annoying to me.
The pace is VERY slow so he can give you in-depth, detailed instruction on what the pose helps, how to make sure you're doing it right & few things to watch out for. He always reminds you to relax. This is why it's great for beginners. Intermediate or advanced practitioners may find the constant talking annoying.
The poses done:
Sun Salutations & Standing Poses:
standing forward bends, mountain pose, plank, low push up, upward dog, downward dog. Added in is: powerful pose, warrior 1, warrior 2, side plank, 1 legged downward dog, twisted side angle, twisted chair pose, eagle.
Upper Body Workout:
A lot of normal plank, low push up, upward dog & downward dog.
Lower Body Workout & Spine:
bow 2x, camel 2x, boat 6x, laying on back legs raised ab work, laying down butterfly, foot to knee hip stretch then turning into 1 legged tabletop, legs crossed seated spinal twist, sitting fwd bend w/straight legs, last is tabletop.
Relaxation:
sitting for 1-2 min while Baron tells you relaxing is important the whole time.
There is a bonus 10 min cardio blast (old aerobics style) workout with Petra Kolber.
The reason I took off stars was the music & Baron's energy on this dvd. I've read others have said & a girlfriend & I have felt his energy is a bit jumpy, slick/overly sexual though he does nothing physically to show this. My gf even couldn't take him for more then a few minutes though she was a novice, but sensitive to energy of others. She loves Rainbeau Mars, Rodney Yee, Seane Corn & Wai Lana much more in comparison as do I. I found the energy of his ""Unlocking Athletic Power: Live"" DVD better, though stiff, maybe because of the better energy of the 30? people in the room. I didn't come close to a sweat, but it is quick 25 min.
Others may not be as aware/sensitive to this energy & like the more physical only development Baron focuses on rather then any mind/body spiritual connection.

You can see a preview at collagevideo com & the first 2 min if you look up on google video",1173312000,16,2273,4.54390243902439
2080540,4,B0002DSPZW,"I am a big fan of Baron Baptiste, and bought this one to complete my collection.  My impression is that this is intended to be a great introduction sampler to yoga, and that the producers brought in a great teacher to make it a fair and exciting introduction to the practice.  If that's your situation, this is a good DVD to get, as Baptiste is terrific.

If you already familiar with Baron Baptiste, there won't be anything new here, and you'll find the early sequences slow.  He takes extra time to explain everything, and his patter emphasizes the benefits of yoga in sort of an Elevator Speech style.  The core sequences at the end are novel, though, and worth owning if you're a Baptiste fan.  But I wouldn't expect this to be your favorite DVD if you already have others.

The music is aerobic class electronica, but not intrusive.",1154131200,15,837,4.577181208053691
8026866,2,B0002DSPZW,"I wish this guy did something himself instead of touching pretty women and talking all the time. I'm a woman and don't understand this approach to yoga videos. If you are a teacher then you suppose to show poses yourself. That is why I like Rodney Yee. He is quiet, works alone and it is very easy to concentrate on exercise.
Obviously, best videos do not usually end on Prime. Noone likes to give good stuff for free. :)",1517702400,,421,4.341772151898734
8026867,5,B0002DSPZW,"Baron Baptiste is my #1 yogi.  This video is what got me started on yoga, and I still love it and use it frequently. It's a great, challenging workout.",1515542400,,151,4.206896551724138
8026868,5,B0002DSPZW,"This is a phenomenal video, and I highly recommend it.",1486252800,,54,4.5
8026869,5,B0002DSPZW,I've had this for four years and still enjoy it! This is great for all levels. Some poses will be challenging for beginners and it's a great video to work up to completing. Even those who have been doing yoga for years will enjoy it.,1477958400,,233,4.2
8026870,4,B0002DSPZW,It was slower than I expected but it ended up meeting my expectations.  I would describe it as only moderately difficult.  This is not for the extreme athlete.  In the past I could do a kick boxing class several times a week but not any more so this was perfect for where I am at this point in my life.,1386892800,,302,4.0
8026871,3,B0002DSPZW,"This is a great, challenging workout if you have just 45 minutes. But the more I do it, the more I get annoyed with how much he TALKS. He literally doesn't go two seconds without talking. It's distracting, and I'm pretty good about not being distracted during my practice. I think he just loves to hear himself talk, but it's too much. I wouldn't buy another dvd of his.",1349827200,2,370,4.3768115942028984
8026872,5,B0002DSPZW,This is not your typical sissy yoga. This is actually a good workout that will strengthen your muscles and make you sweat! It's pretty hard.,1326412800,,140,4.64
8026873,5,B0002DSPZW,I have been doing this dvd daily for years. I love it.  It is a great solid yoga workout.  What I like most about this dvd is the flow and movement.  You will sweat.,1323475200,,165,3.7941176470588234
8026874,5,B0002DSPZW,Netflix used to have this on streaming and I became hooked so once they no longer offered it I bought the DVD.  Great overall workout.  Not meditative at all but great strength building yoga with stretching.  Can kick your butt at the start.,1319673600,,241,4.558139534883721
8026875,5,B0002DSPZW,"I was wanting to get into yoga and found this video on Netflix. I used it several times and then Netflix removed it so ended up purchasing the DVD. I wasn't that knowledgeable about yoga and this video helped learn more and feel great.

It starts slow with a warm-up and moves into poses that are a real workout. Then it takes you into cool down and relaxation.

It is great way to prepare for an actual class and have a great home class.

Prepare to sweat.",1317427200,,457,4.2298850574712645
