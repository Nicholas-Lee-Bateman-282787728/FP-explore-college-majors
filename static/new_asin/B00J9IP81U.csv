But what I really wanted to say for those of you who look through the description and are curious, this collection is in both Japanese and ENGLISH Audio, for those of you who enjoy dubbed series.  I actually really liked both, other than a few creative decisions with some of the words.",1430870400,2,353,4.515625

8649025,3,B00J9IP81U,"As someone who has played the game, I was expecting quite a lot from the anime. Unlike light novels or manga, adapting a video game into an anime can be very difficult to pull off, because usually there isn't a good part to just end should the show need to. Devil Survivor 2 was able to bring forth some interesting concepts if you haven't played the game, but ultimately, the game is superior. Fans of the games will find themselves being extremely critical of obvious flaws and most certainly want to give this an even lower rating. Those who have never played it will most likely find the idea very interesting, and might just want to pick up the game. However, I must review it fairly for both fans and newcomers. If you are new to this series, watch a few episodes online if you are insistent about the anime. The game is loads better for many reasons:

Hibiki and his friend find a video on Nicaea where they are killed by a collision with a subway-ouch! They don't believe it, but the next day they die when a subway hits them. Presented with a second chance of life, they are given Demon Apps, which allows them to summon demons to fight for them-a staple for the Shin Megami series, which is what Devil Survivor is a part of. From there, the story expands from high schoolers fighting demons, to the government and some task force called the JPs who recruit Hibiki and the others to keep the monsters from encroaching on the world.

Yamato, the leader of JP, tells them that 7 insanely powerful demons are coming, and the monsters they've faced so far are nothing like these 7. So, from there Hibiki and the others must stop these 7 demons from destroying the world.

Nicaea ends up falling away as a plot device, so you never hear of it again. The anime starts out very dark, doing its best to create a grim atmosphere like the game. Lots of innocent people are killed in an ""earthquake"", but Hibiki and his friends discover that it's really the doing of these demons.

Like with the games, the idea of conflicting ideologies plays a role. Yamato believes in doing whatever it takes to protect the world from the monsters, even if it means killing innocent people to do so. Hibiki constantly questions the validity of that as the JP continually root out the weak to keep the strong for the 7 demons. Hibiki has a rough start naturally after his ""death"" so it's understandable that he would be upset, scared and unsure. BUT the fact that it takes SO freaking LONG for him to man up is a huge disappointment. When he finally does stand up to Yamato, I was a little taken aback. It almost happened out of nowhere-granted he did develop, but how he did felt a little jarring. Still, I have to admit that this was one of the better parts of the anime.

The anime also ""dumbed down"" the demon fusing and all of the greatness in the franchise, so don't go in expecting the game.

Overall, if you haven't played the game, the story will conclude very well for you. The only characters that truly were developed well were Yamato, and then Hibiki. Almost every single character were completely forgettable-like that one guy ""Joe.""

If you're going in as a massive fan-or just a fan in general-of the games, please take note that this is NOT going to be amazing. It does NOT live up to the games at all. So, you will be very disappointed. If you turn off your critical eye, you might find something you'll like. However, as a newcomer, you will like this because you are going in blind. Just note that this comes nowhere near to how great the game was because the game had such a gripping storyline that this short anime sadly couldn't pull off. I hope if you do check it out, you will consider the games because those honestly have such an amazing story and gameplay.

So: fans probably won't like this at all.
Newcomers: I recommend the game most highly, but if you insist, I recommend streaming.",1413676800,3,3897,4.471167369901547
