8662101,5,B00KW3A6F4,"My wife and I really love this movie.  We had it on dvd, but wanted to see what it was like in blu-ray.  I really can't say that I can tell that much difference, but still love the movie.  It is very entertaining and thought Keaton was very good.  I would say that you would like to watch the science fiction, thriller types of movies to like it though.  Just an FYI, that there are 2 of these movies.  This one and a sequel.",1422403200,,425,4.0
