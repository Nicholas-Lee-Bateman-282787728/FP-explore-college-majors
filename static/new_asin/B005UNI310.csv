8486979,4,B005UNI310,"ive watched this twice now, and while it won't appeal to everyone, its got all the elements true horror fans look for: slimeball kids who deserve whats coming to them; a spooky old house; a suspenseful final 30 minutes; and a socio-political conspiracy backstory that makes sense...if you liked marilyn burns in the texas chainsaw massacre-check out megan hutchings as the terrified teen girl trying to make it out alive.",1327190400,6,421,5.0285714285714285
8486980,1,B005UNI310,"Ultra low budget, but not in a good way. Bad lighting throughout, annoying and ridiculous characters, cheap blood and gore effects/cgi, this here was truly a piece of sh**. A close group of friends who are heroin addicts hide out in an abandoned house after one of their buddies kills himself.. they get messed up on a bad batch and start killing each other.. yep. Avoid this movie at all costs. Waste of time.",1326412800,4,410,4.554054054054054
