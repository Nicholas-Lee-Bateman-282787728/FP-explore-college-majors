6248826,5,B00I4581F4,"China Beach was the critics' choice for best television drama at its time but never was able to get decent ratings.  As a Vietnam combat vet, I find situations I relate to & situations that approach incredulity.  The third season seems to have turned toward more stock plots (love stories, mysteries, etc.) but it does have some tense episodes (even if unlikely) such as McMurphy being kidnapped then released by the Viet Cong.  I loved it, you may hate it - but the war's over & the overriding plot line of women being able to rise to what was always considered only men's level of courage in the worst of times is still (and will always be) relevant.  If you were there, it's nostalgic.  If you weren't there, consider yourself lucky.",1401148800,3,736,4.587786259541985
6248827,5,B00I4581F4,"Once again I come to this spot to review one of my most favorite of television series.  I now own, and I have viewed all three available seasons of China Beach.  This series means so very much to me, and I am sure to many of my fellow Vietnam Veterans.  For those of us who were up in the North part of South Vietnam in I Corps, and in my own case Phu Bai. Quite a bit of what is portrayed in the series is very familiar.  I  was in Da Nang many times, and visited the ""real"" China Beach a few times as well.  The real place is/was the beach near Da Nang called My Khe Beech.  It did have an evacuation hospital, and did have a recreation center for what we called ""In-Country R&R"".  Whether the doctors and nurses were anything like those in the series is neither here nor there.  What is important, is that those folks did serve there, and performed the same medical services as did Colleen McMurphy, Samuel Beckett, Lila Garreau, and ""Dick"" Richard.  I am sure that there were others like ""Boonie"" and ""Dodger"" around as well.  I served with and knew many people in Vietnam, and all of those individuals have some degree of similarity to those in the series. My subsequent role in life after I retired from the Army, was as a VA Social Worker.  I retired from that position after 23 years, just eight years ago.  The veterans, from all of our 20th Century Wars and conflicts, deserve the best care that our nation can provide. The same goes for those currently serving in this newer century.  Many of the medical personnel who served in Vietnam, also worked with the VA later on.  I had the honor to work alongside some of these professionals within the VA system, and they continue as valued friends to this day. I would like to believe that we will someday have no more need for Medevac, ""Dust Off"", and combat medical personnel.  I know this will not happen though, and I thank God that those filling these positions are still there.  I love the China Beach series 3, and give it a 5 Star rating.  Now, please release Season 4, and I will be a bit happier still.",1400198400,24,2068,4.327272727272727

6248964,5,B00I4581F4,"As a Vietnam veteran I was greatly impressed with this series when it was on television.  It shows a side of the Vietnam experience that is not often portrayed in the documentaries nor is it often talked about among the vets.  This is the final season and the series is a compelling, competent and compassionate treatment of that most difficult time in our history.  Wonderful product at an equally wonderful price.",1403654400,,415,4.816901408450704

6248969,5,B00I4581F4,"I am glad I bought all 3 seasons, but wonder what happened to some of the stories I remember.  Did they also make a few made for tv movies?  Dana Delany did the most marvelous job with MacMurphy.  I understand she learned that silence was more effective in many scenes than dialog.  Her eyes mirrored the agony of the terrible wreckage of bodies.  I recommend watching them in order.",1402876800,,383,4.492753623188406

6248975,5,B00I4581F4,"I'm of an age where the war in Vietnam was part of my life in my formative years.  I joined the Air Force in 1970.  This series tells the story of what it was like for the people kept the soldiers alive better than any previous war.  It's not a story of fighting the Viet Cong, but rather a story of fighting Death, suffering, and impossible hours and work loads.  Great music from the '60s and '70s helps to tell the story and set the scene.",1402099200,9,442,4.104651162790698
