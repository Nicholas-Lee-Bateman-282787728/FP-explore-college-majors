8652957,4,B00JPQ1ID8,"I really liked this show.  It was clean family fun, with terrific cast members.  The only cast member that was not really funny, was Dick Sargent.  It's sad that Dick York was replaced.

Mill Creek has put this season and season 3 in a case with all 3 discs stacked on top of the other.  This will surely scratch after a while.  Now I have to have three cases each for two seasons.  Purchase Sony dvd's instead.  They stiff the consumers to save a buck.

My four stars are for the show.  Would be nice to rate Mill Creek.",1420243200,,521,4.171717171717172
