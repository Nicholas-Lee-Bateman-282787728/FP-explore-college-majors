1072129,5,6305796297,"The scenery is plentiful & beautiful, the acting is done well, the story is a good portrayal of St. Patrick (a Catholic Bishop) who had a major role in converting a paganistic Ireland to Christianity.  The movie is not 100% accurate but it doesn't take away the essential devotion and conversion of the Saint.  See this movie and learn about the great Saint.",1015804800,14,358,4.666666666666667
1072130,5,6305796297,"This made for television movie is entertaining, inspiring, and educational.  St. Patrick is one of the most well know, yet least ""known about"" significant personalities in world history.  God used Patrick to transform Ireland and Ireland's influence helped shape the world.  The story starts with Patrick as a reckless youth, captured by slave traders.  In slavery to a Irish Warlord he has a Divine encounter that grows into a holy passion for God.  He is miraculously delivered from Ireland and returns to his family.  Back in his British homeland He hears the call of God to return as a missionary to Ireland.  Despite numerous obstacles, he refuses to let go of the heavenly vision and soon returns to Irish soil as the Bishop of Ireland.  Through power encounters with the druid priests and a servants heart of love for the Irish people, Patrick becomes the catalyst for a spiritual awakening. Patrick Bergen's portrayal of St. Patrick is convincing and compelling.  Malcolm McDowell ideally personifies the religious hierarchical antagonists who oppose Patrick.  The special effects leave something to be desired but they do not take away from the powerful and moving story of St. Patrick.  I highly recommend this movie to all those looking for inspiring family entertainment.",995932800,93,1283,5.14975845410628
1072131,4,6305796297,"I would give this film 4 stars for the story, acting, and entertainment value, but I have to deduct 1 star for the costumes and cinematography. As this was a television production, I can overlook that however. The movie retells the legends that surround the memory of Ireland's patron saint. From Patrick escaping slavery to his driving out the snakes in Ireland, converting the island to Christianity, and taking on the Church hierarchy, the film does a great job in telling these legends with flair and pacing that keeps the modern audience's attention. A special acting nod goes to Malcolm McDowell as a scheming Church official that plots to bring about Patrick's downfall. If you've celebrated St. Patrick's Day and never knew who the man was, pick up this movie. It's a very entertaining education.",994118400,13,804,4.962962962962963
1072132,5,6305796297,"All my life I celebrated St. Patrick's day with little knowledge of what I was celebrating.  Saint Patrick: The Irish Legend is the first cinematic representation of this great Saint's life.  I was so impressed with the  life of this Saint, and this video, that I highly recommend it to anyone  who loves Saint Patrick and his Church.
From his abduction as a teenager  and enslavement by Irish marauders to his conversion on the solitary  windswept hills Ireland while tending his master's sheep, Saint Patrick is  a shining example of what God can do in the life of a single soul.  Through  his intense and mystical prayer life, Saint Patrick is instructed on how to  escape his captors to return home to England.  Upon his return to England,  Saint Patrick perceives in a vision the ""Voice of the Irish"" and  is instructed to return to preach the Gospel to those who once held him  captive.  It is many more years before the Saint is able to return to  Ireland, but in a serious of miraculous events he is called back to Ireland  to shepherd a pagan people to God.
Although, no doubt, there is some  fancy to the legends portrayed, I do believe that there may be more than a  little truth in them.  Saint Patrick: The Irish Legend is a powerful and  moving story that is well worth viewing.",960422400,60,1292,4.530434782608696
1072133,5,6305796297,"This is a wonderful movie, and Patrick Bergen gives a wonderful performance as the Irish Saint.  Besides beautiful scenery, you have the story, based on Saint Patrick's own writings.  The message of Faith and  God's Love and Protection is clear throughout.  The special effects are not  overdone and accentuate the impact of the message in the story.  I highly  recommend this movie, whether purchased in DVD or VHS format.  (I purchased  the DVD.)

1072322,5,6305796297,"A very talented cast featuring Patrick Bergin as the adult Patrick and Luke Griffin as the young Patrick. Malcolm McDowell, Alan Bates and Susannah York seemed flawless. St. Patrick is probably one of the best known saints in the Western World, and certainly America's most revered one, his shamrocks and greenery covering New York and other great cities on his day. But even those devote Irish who proudly parade in or out of uniform, will learn something about the man who brought the Gospel to Ireland, in this splendid biopic which takes Patrick as a young Christian Scot who is captured and taken to Ireland as a slave, only to fall in love with these heathen people, and dedicate his whole life to save them from paganism.",1438300800,3,728,4.74015748031496

1072543,2,6305796297,"Whoa! Got St. Patrick's personality all wrong. He is known for tremendous compassion and patience with the ancient Irish Druids that held him as a slave for six years before he escaped back to England,(his nation of origin), only to return after becomming a RC Bishop. He was a deeply devout true follower of Jesus and helped the Druids understand Christ in a way that they could; thus the mixing of Druid symbols in Celtic Christianity. Despite this, the central tenets of Christianity were held to. The ancients accepted Christ as the Saviour of mankind  through the repentence of sin and monotheism as expressed in the triune Godhead of Christianity. Patrick's methods of introducing the truths of Christianity into ancient Irish culture without destroying that culture were groundbreaking and serve as a model for modern Christian Evangelism.",1394496000,,846,5.175182481751825

1072545,1,6305796297,"Every Aspect was deplorable....the actors were terrible...st. patrick's actor looked dishevelled, mean, arrogant, and protestant....the other bishops looked like some protestant gathering of clerics where there is no hierarchy but group jurisdiction.  The costums were terrible.  Laity and especially Priests and Bishops were by Church Law forbidden to have long hair and Church Tradition and History proves they even from pictures in the Catacombs of Rome that they adopted in short Roman Hairstyle of the Time and remained so in Western Civilization until the Hippie 60s!  Yes,  the pagans of Ireland and the Barbarian tribes that invaded the Roman Empire in the 5th Century and later all wore long hair as they came from the east (Germanic Tribes) but when they converted to the Catholic Faith they no longer kept the long hair of men.
The penances St. Patrick did for years prior to going to Ireland as a Bishop and His Schooling days in the best Colleges of the Holy Roman Empire is not covered, nor that He raised 33 people from the dead and not one of his quotes!!!!How can there be a movie about St. Patrick if they don't use the Church History of the Saint!
I had to throw this in the garbage because it would be a sin to keep it around to make light of the Real St. Patrick...I did keep the case after I ripped out the wrapper.

I only knew about the snakes leaving Ireland but it seems he was one whose boldness required God to work extravagent wonders. It shows well the foolishness of church politics when those with institutional powers try to bring down one supported by God. Patrick reminds me of Peter, Paul, John, Mary Magdalene, Philip, etc. I hadn't known he was such a firebrand. His fight against the Druids smack of Elijah vs Baal's prophets. It's quite amazing what he accomplished in his God-call and the eternal legacy he left for Europe and thus the modern world.

1072751,5,6305796297,"I had seen this film before, and I enjoyed it. The title character is portrayed by Patrick Bergin, and very well too. Wilfrid, the Archbishop of York, I believe, was the crusader against the Celtic church, as you probably know, and had taken the connection to Rome so far that he had reportedly used stone from Hadrian's Wall in building the cathedral. He is played by Malcolm McDowell.

The conflict there is pretty dramatic, at least it appears more dramatic than it might otherwise appear to those who know the argument is largely about the date for Easter, and how the clergy cuts their hair.

It has a nice denoument, with the bishop who had once heard Patrick's confession and then revealed the embarrassing details to Wilfrid, who used it to accuse him of heresy, ends up being forgiven, and joining the little colony for Christ on the island, and the film ends with the little band continuing their mission.

Oh, in the beginning, Patrick puts his staff down in the sand, upon his arrival, and snakes crawl out of the earth and into the sea. This is fictional, there have been no snakes in Ireland since the ice age. Vikings, Normans, Scots under Edward Bruce, and Oliver Cromwell, but no snakes.",1270857600,3,1204,4.669811320754717

1072848,2,6305796297,"This is a simplistic made for television movie based on the myths surrounding St Patrick the ""legendary hero"" rather than the facts about the actual historical person. For example, some rather cheesy special effects are used to depict Patrick's supposedly God inspired visions and magical powers.

I suppose this could be considered all in good fun, especially for kids. But the problem is that some people are going to believe this is based on real historical events rather than legend and mythology. Of course, the true story of St Patrick the man is far more interesting and I would have preferred a movie about him rather than all this silliness about using magic to defeat the ""evil pagan"" enemies.

Still, somehow I enjoyed seeing a version of Patrick's life (how accurate I couldn't say) and somehow ended up finding the film entertaining, though not always in the ways the filmmakers intended.

Older people have been influenced enough by Hollywood magic to consider its limited effects rather old fashioned.  Its style reminds me of Cecil B. DeMille's ""10 Commandments"".

If you want an intertaining film on the life of Patrick, this is it.  If you want a study with a little more depth and little less legend I'd pick the docu-drama PATRICK.  Liam Neeson narrates and Gabriel Byrne provides the voice of Patrick.",1128988800,12,534,4.877777777777778
1072852,1,6305796297,"If you want a film that, as has been previously and repetitiously described, is a ""feel-good movie"" about the patron saint of Ireland, then look no further.  The kids will love it.  Younger ones will, at least.  It's only 90 minutes long, so it may even keep their attention.

If you want real substance, however, do not waste your time or money on this film.

I realize that this movie was made for television, and that it was made for Fox Family, at that, but I sincerely wish that the producers had spent a little more time and effort on this film.  St. Patrick's is a wonderful story that should be told with much more reverence and sincerity than this production offers.

The plot of the film is very rushed, the acting is very cheesy, with the exception (barely) of Patrick Bergin and Malcolm MacDowell, the costuming is questionable for 5th century Ireland, and the special effects are of little better qualtiy than those late 1950s/early '60s Hercules and Jason and the Argonauts movies.  I think someone's middle-school son or daughter created the FX for a class project.  There is absolutely no depth to this movie.  I'm not sure if any real research went into the making of the film, since it is based almost entirely on the Patrick of myth than the Patrick of history.  The movie is based more on what someone would learn in Catholic school as a young child than on what we learn from history.

Then, again, this may be the whole point, and I am ranting for nothing.  I believe the target audience was the wee lads and lasses, rather than those of us who are older, and inspired more from the real St. Patrick than the fairy-tale Patrick, driving out nonexistent snakes and breaking up pagan virgin sacrifices which probably never happened, either.

Please pardon me if I am overly critical of the technical merits of the film, as I realize it was probably never intended to enter into the running for an Oscar.  Perhaps I simply had higher expectations for the film, as an Irishman and a big fan of St. Patrick.  This movie hurt my feelings.

If you are truly interested in being inspired by the story of St. Patrick, read Philip Freeman's ""St. Patrick of Ireland: A Biography,"" at least as a start.",1109548800,28,2212,4.587786259541985
