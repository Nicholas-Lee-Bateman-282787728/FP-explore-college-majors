4173151,5,B003R0MF3K,"I have been a huge fan of this man and watched his Fry and Laurie series, among other offering he made in Britain and this is a perfect addition to my Laurie/House dvd collection.",1289952000,39,179,4.294117647058823
4173152,5,B003R0MF3K,"SEASON 7 HAS NOT LET ME DOWN, STILL LIVES UP TO HOUSE ON SHOW,  ITS REPUTATION ALTERS, IM NOT  QUITE USE TO HIM  HAVING A RELATIONSHIP I HAVE PREPRDERED BEFORE IT COMES OUT, I HOPE IT CONTINUES IN SEIES TILL I DIEID BE SAD TO  NOT SEE HOUSE ON",1289606400,,243,3.8979591836734695
4173153,5,B003R0MF3K,I've never seen this done on series tv before.  The writers of this show need a special award at the Emmys for being the first show to successfully put the lead in a romantic relationship without ruining the rest of the show.  There are great bits throughout this episode on their relationship while a very fascinating case plays out as well.  I found the case especially absorbing but I can't much more about it without ruining it.  An ordinary person can actually figure out this disease by careful watching.  Thirteen is still missing but her name is on the credits so I assume this is a story arc which will be coming back shortly.,1286841600,,635,4.535087719298246
4173154,5,B003R0MF3K,"Whew....I am glad to report that I can stay with House.  He has not gone all soft, gentle and sappy.  Well, he has with Cuddy but he's himself with everyone else.  They now are working on establishing a working relationship too.  They try being nicer to one another at work and you can imagine the problems that creates!  An interesting case is before the team as well plus a family facing an impossible choice.  Glad to have you back, House.",1285718400,4,442,4.4625
4173155,5,B003R0MF3K,"I have seen every single episode, and I was scared that it was going to suck or be icky once they were together, but they did a great job of it and I loved that they started right where we left off.  It wasn't half as awkward as I thought it would be. It was a great treatment of really difficult material, this show has great writers and I was cheering by the end of this one. Also interesting was the whole 13 exit.  I am not a huge 13 fan, but she had some great lines and is just smoking hot.",1285372800,2,496,3.8529411764705883
4173156,4,B003R0MF3K,"This wasn't a bad episode by any means.  However, they tackled something very difficult in taking the House character and having him be in love.  I give the creators a lot of credit for doing this.  It certainly is a radical departure for series television.  Usually ten seasons of unrequited love is the norm. I do hope the drama, scathing wit and baffling cases are back next week. I don't know if I can handle a whole season of a softer, gentler House M.D.",1285027200,9,459,4.428571428571429
4173177,5,B003R0MF3K,"I LOVE him.  Hugh Laurie is hilarious, and so BEAUTIFUL, I can hardly stand it.  I bought all seasons...  People are upset it was taken off of sites like NetFlix.  Well, here you can watch them any time you want and not have to worry about connecting online.  All you need is a DVD player, and they're cheap nowadays.",1515628800,,317,4.305084745762712

4173180,5,B003R0MF3K,"As its hard to separate the seasons, I'll be posting a generic for all. House is a doctor who has more than a few issues, but is brillant so is allowed to get away with his rude, offensive, and at times, dangerous behavior. All this makes it so that the show never has a dull moment as the viewer isn't quite sure what House will do next or if he will be stopped in time. There are a lot of great moments and even for those who aren't fans of medical shows, this is still a show that should be checked out. It is not a family show as there is crude humor, but at least the viewer is never board.",1514160000,,595,3.925619834710744

4173788,4,B003R0MF3K,"House is a fascinating series which centers around a unique character, but I would never go so far as to say it's realistic in any way with regard to the medical aspects of the show.  If I thought my doctor and his ""team"" would go so far as to rifle through my garbage at home to discover clues to my sickness, well, that is just too far out there to be considered realistic.  I doubt that would ever happen in real life.  If you watch the episodes one after the other you start to see that it's just the same show with a different illness thrown in for good measure.  I'm sure the researchers for the show had fun looking up obscure illnesses.  What stands out about this show isn't so much the medical side of it, but the relationships between the characters and House and his own development and downfall.  The sickness is only a backdrop to the real story, which makes this show so compelling.",1397433600,,897,4.341317365269461

4173824,5,B003R0MF3K,"Without a doubt, the best medical drama ever on television, or even on film.  It skillfully combines precision and unusual diagnostic medicine with the Human Equation.  Other medical shows typically neglect the medical aspect, and focus on the soap opera love interests of the hospital staff; but House delivers Medical School level academics, along with the drama seen in only the best of literature - the unexpected, realistic, and non-linear events we all have in our lives, rather than the mundane writing of hacks who are pandering to what the TV executives think will sell the products of their advertisers.  House is tantamount to The Sopranos, in its approach and methodology, and the true swings from the gritty to anguish and from transient humor back to despair, rarely - if ever - seen in the media, yet ever present in the daily reality of life.  House makes the so-called Reality Shows look stupider and more contrived than they actually are.  House hinges somewhere between a documentary and a true masterpiece of the art of film.  This is not a must see, or a summer blockbuster, but a treasure that will reside in the archives of the consciousness of all who embrace it.",1385683200,4,1187,4.851485148514851

4173859,5,B003R0MF3K,"Why is it that televisions shows go on for one season too long.
House was not the first Ive felt the final season as disjointed and irrelevant to the over arcing story.
This penultimate season is actually the last season I own. The last 1/2 hour of the final episode completes the story perfectly and, to me, is exactly how Dr. House would end this chapter of his life.
I found every episode of this season relevant to the characters in a way that season 8 made me regret watching.
Gilmore Girls did that to me also.

I seriously believe this season ends the series House in the most thorough House-like way it could end. I highly recommend this season to anyone who doesnt have it yet, although I really cant imagine anyone watching and loving the show and not all ready having this.

SO I guess my review is more of a caution.

If you come this far, before going into season 8 consider whether or not the final moments of this season sum up the story of House or if you need more episodes of Taub being the sort of comic relief, Foreman being not Foreman, Wilson being not Wilson, no Cuddy, and new interns whose characters are actually old characters with new actors but less realized. Yep you guessed it, I was not a fan of season 8. I wrote a review of it(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House-M-D-Season-Eight/dp/B0053O89JM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House, M.D.: Season Eight</a>) that was not kind to anyone but Chase.",1379116800,,1464,4.824701195219124

4173876,5,B003R0MF3K,"This show is brilliant. Season 7 only gets better and I cant stop binge watching. House is not alone anymore and it makes him, to quote Cuddy, ""a better person"". The expressions on Hugh's face when he acts in this season are inspirational and timeless. He, along with the entire cast, seem to be having a great deal of fun. Perhaps it is because they have settled into their roles and now have the depth of knowledge to be insouciant as things come full circle. The cast is comfortable with each other. Their characters are exploring how it feels to move on also and it seems to be a time of searching into new forays.

We have seem House grow and now he is ""happy"", something we never thought would be possible given his personality. This show is brilliant. The writing is top notch, the actors are expert and the directors really bring it all together.",1374278400,,854,4.4743589743589745

4173998,2,B003R0MF3K,"I bought this season hoping that the writing may get overhauled after a disappointing Season 6, but it was only slightly better than Season 6 with some episodes boring or almost unwatchable.  This is disappointing since I was a real fan of Seasons 1-5, thinking that House was a heroic character seaching for truth and willing to take risks, not just for his own curiosity, but to save other peoples lives.

Season 6 transforms the show into a soap opera with high budget fantasy scenes, dredging up everyone's personal life, and demoting the patients to sort of a Perry Mason style ending of magically finding a correct diagnosis at the end of the show after almost killing the patient with tests or several wrong diagnosis instead a more step by step educational process of diagnosis.  House becomes a self-centered, drug addicted, outlaw losing any sympathetic or redeeming qualities he seemed to have initially.

Having been through severe pain only helped with morphine and only given before several surgeries in a week, and knowing that the only bright side was believing it would end some day, maybe it was therapuetic to see a doctor feel some pain that they usually fail to comprehend, otherwise.  Maybe it also was interesting to see someone get enough pain relief to function even though I haven't seen anyone moaning 24 hours a day like I had to until I passed out/slept, and lost 40 pounds that week. I had heard from pain doctors that narcotics to treat actual pain is not addictive, so it does bother me that House is able to abuse the great priviledge of getting needed pain medication and turn it into recreational use.

The show has morphed into something not even resembling the believable plot that gained it success.  If they lost writers from Seasons 1-5, they need them back, because the show's creator doesn't seem to have a clue what made the show great.  I think most people still watching after season 5 are just hoping for a few more great episodes or even an accidentally good one, but it looks like that is a delusion based on the end of Season 7.

Worth watching at least once. For some reason, I didn't like seeing House get softer as he did in many of these episodes (as his relationship with Cutty developed). Soft wasn't what I liked about him, you know I liked the witty, ill-tempered b*tchin House. I did like the episode where he played games with Cutty's daughter (trying to work the system, of course, this time it was to get her in to the ""best"" preschool to make Cutty happy so he would be happy). Still, that and the last episode were the best, the remainder of the episodes were ok. House also kicks the Vicodin habit, and I'm sorry to say that I honestly preferred him chewing up a couple vicodin as he actively participated in the cases (he spent too much time away from the hospital in this season). I agree with another reviewer that he needed more clinical duty, LOL. I just didn't feel that extra ""edge"" that made the prior seasons great was present in most of these episodes.

4174012,4,B003R0MF3K,"I have mixed feelings. I've loved House from Season 1 and have always considered it a 5-star show. But I somehow think it should have ended around Season 5 or 6. It just seemed like they were taking things a bit too far. At least I THOUGHT they were, until I saw the final episode of this season. Then I KNEW they were. HOUSE has gone from a groundbreaking medical drama to an evening soap opera! I have no idea how there can even be a Season 8 after how 7 ended. I guess Season 8 is actually about over by now. I've never actually gotten to watch them on TV; I just buy the DVDs. I am actually looking forward to it, because I HAVE TO KNOW how it all ends! Despite the dip in quality, it is still pretty good.

In my own personal opinion, I think House and Cuddy should have hooked up much earlier, like in Season 5. It's not like we didn't know they had a thing for each other. All the waiting was just silly. The series could have ended while it was ahead. It's not like we viewers would have had this delusional idea that they would have lived happily ever after! We knew they both had issues, especially House, and would have to work on their relationship. (Like most normal couples.) But at least we would have had a decent ending. Instead, we get total tragedy!

*SPOILER ALERT*
I always liked House (the person). He's not someone I think I could tolerate as a personal friend, but he's an enjoyable character to watch. He's a jerk, yes, but I always thought of him as the one who will say what everyone is thinking, but is afraid to say out loud. The honest one, if you will. He's the one who isn't afraid to get judged. But... this season he went WAY TOO FAR. This show had always been revolutionary, I think. The medical mysteries, solved by House's brilliant mind. Now, it's almost a completely different show. House was already ""damaged,"" as everyone calls him. I really don't need to see him deteriorate even further to be entertained. Everyone deserves something good to happen to them once in a while. Having Cuddy break things off with him for one little slip-up with Vicodin was just ridiculous. Like she didn't know what she was getting into. Especially being a doctor! And then, to have House turn into the nightmare ex-boyfriend from Hell! Geez, he's a grown man, not a teenager. His pranks with Wilson were always funny, but not this.

The finale was beyond shocking. It made for great TV, but... we've gotten to love these characters! House could have killed somebody! Or multiple people! What's to become of our ""friendly neighborhood doctor"" now? Commitment to an asylum? Seeing how he obviously can't handle anything. Incidentally, how come the police didn't manage to arrive before he hobbled away on his cane? I'll be waiting for Season 8 now. I can't wait to see how they keep it all going. I saw another reviewer said maybe they'll explain it all away in a dream sequence. That would be so lame, but how else can they fix things now?",1334102400,,2962,4.4511970534069984

If their point was that a person can not be entirely self absorbed and long survive, they've made that point.  But, in doing so, they have also taken away any sense of entertainment left in the series.
While we began with a Sherlock Holmes sort of brilliance in solving medical mysteries, we have been left with almost no mysteries to solve, and the show has become concerned with the various sex lives of its characters.  It has lost its penetrating moral dilemmas and become a portrait of a ruined man.  Like the performance artist in the finale, it is self absorbed and almost entirely devoid of actual art.",1326499200,7,870,4.62987012987013
4174056,5,B003R0MF3K,"House M.D. has now gone through seven seasons. Each season has consisted of approximately 24 episodes (with the exception of Season Four, when the writer's strike of 2006 brought the show, along with most every other show, to a complete stop, and resulted in a truncated season). This means that House M.D. has moved significantly beyond the 100-show mark, that perilous and generally inflexible salient of a show's quality. We saw this as far back in the early 1960's with The Dick Van Dyke Show, when, at the height of its acclaim and popularity, Carl Reiner ended it so that the show could always be remembered as one that went on a high. We have, arguably, also witnesses multiple cases since that time when other shows, remaining huge money makers pass the 100-show threshold, because of fiduciary interests continued to move on, resulting in episodes that were increasingly awful to watch. (I will spare the listing. But by the way, one of the few shows to have overcome that ""rule"" is the acclaimed BBC show MI-5, which is now filming it's 10th, and final Season, perhaps giving nod to this unwritten truth surrounding television shows.)

House M.D. could have easily gone down this same route, extinguishing its quality as it progressed. But after going through the complete Seventh Season, I can happily report that, in my opinion, House M.D. has not yet suffered that fate. In spite of some unusual twists in story line and a number of unexpected diversions in the show (which I will not point out to help eliminate spoilers), the show fundamentally remains the fascinating story of a genius medical doctor who struggles with a terrible physical condition which seems to defy physical and psychological treatment. The writers and producers of the show have managed to keep the show refreshingly interesting and engrossing, and although the writers seem to manage to paint themselves into a corner at the end of each season, the next sees the story grow and change. Season Seven is no different.

Some House M.D. fans have written that they do not like of the story line changes of the past couple of years, some going as far to say that the show should have been ended at the completion of Season Six. I can see easily their point, and the argument has merit. On the other hand, there can be little denying that Season Seven has given everyone in the House M.D. family a chance to soar and to open their characters in a way we did not see in the earlier seasons. Much more physical comedy and biting sarcasm, for example, seems to be the rule in Season Seven. Strange settings and events, no stranger to House M.D., arise aplenty, and there is seemingly no end to the dramatic and sometimes ingenious devices used to brings the main characters into conflict, support, new paths, and old alliances.

All of this makes Season Seven incredibly interesting, fun, and dramatic. If you have not seen House M.D., this is not a good Season in which to enter, because it is largely built off the understanding of the previous six seasons. (I would rather recommend for you that you go back to Season One, and start there. Then the rest will be much more enjoyable and powerful to you.) But for those who have watched House perform his skills over the past six years, I can't really do anything but recommend Season Seven. And perhaps, more than any Season, when you watch this, sit back and enjoy the more pronounced (and relaxed) dramatic, comedic, and musical skills of the group. They are allowed to sail here more than in any other Season. It's really quite a story to watch.

House M.D. I'll miss it when it's over. It can't go on forever, and there is talk that the upcoming Season Eight may be its last. But its been one of the most unusual and entertaining shows I've ever seen. I don't agree with all of it, and can't go along with House himself in some of his beliefs and actions, but its one of those stories that has been cast with an actor--Hugh Laurie--who could pull it off with aplomb. Wow. Even with its shortcomings and twists that not everyone agrees were good ideas, this has been an amazing show.",1326067200,4,4118,4.6680440771349865

I don't know what is going on in season 8 and I'm not want to imaging (""House The Sociopath"") but I think that the writers and producers can not save this show.

One is from a troll and two are from people dissatisfied with the purchase and the packaging respectively, neither of whom mention the show. The other seven are from people who all claim to be fans of 'House' who say that this season is so bad it only deserves one star. Hey, folks- it's the same show. The cast is largely the same, the writers, directors and producers are the same. The show didn't suddenly go from the best thing on TV to a one-star show. House is still House after all these years and if you want to substitute 'crazy' for 'House', that would be equally true.

This season has highs and lows like every other season. I enjoyed some episodes very much, others somewhat less. The introduction of Martha Masters was successful; the episode 'Last Temptation' was one of the best of the season (and incidentally gave Wilson the rare opportunity to deliver the funniest line of the episode). 'Fall From Grace' was also a great episode with a real twist in the tail. I didn't care for the penultimate episode very much, just too dark for me, but the last episode delivered a suitable punch for the series conclusion.

This isn't my favorite season of 'House', but it's still a very good show. I'm looking forward to seeing what will happen next season.",1323561600,7,1382,4.568548387096774

4174082,5,B003R0MF3K,"For six seasons Cuddy and House circled each other with a relationship, season seven finally gave them it to them. Although the Cuddy/House partnering could not possibly last in real life, in TV dramas stranger things have happened. It was nice to finally see them as a couple (odd certainly) and their give and take was genuinely funny most of the time and biting the rest. Lisa Eldelstein and Hugh Laurie are excellent actors and their timing continued to be Tracy/Hepburn like in execution.

The stories for the seventh season were thoughtful and well written and the supporting cast was stellar as usual. As Wilson and House's relationship remains humourous for the most part, Peter Jacobson takes over as House's main foil with his personal issues giving Laurie wonderful deadpan opportunities as an actor. The season adds Candice Bergen as Cuddy's mother who brings both humor and tension to the already frantic pace. The episode ""Two Stories"" joins ""Help Me"" as the best episodes in the show's award winning history.

As the show continues to evolve within the context of its storylines (not ""whodunit"" but ""whatdunit,"") the character driven writing continues to be top notch and the actors deliver as a well coordinated team.

""House"" with its many cast changes and single setting, manages to stay fresh and remain an iconic TV show. Season Seven is a great addition to the legacy.",1322524800,,1389,4.978448275862069
4174083,4,B003R0MF3K,"I'll try and leave out any big spoilers (as long as you have seen season 6 that is):

Being a long time fan of House, I have to say that I was apprehensive about purchasing this season after the ups and downs since season 4.  Instead I checked the season out at my local library (aren't libraries great!?!).  Watching through the season I am left both satisfied and disappointed.

Several episodes really take off onto the personal relationship tangents and seem to forget about the cases.  In my opinion, this is unacceptable for a show that built it's reputation on quality medical drama with interesting side stories that were just that: side stories.  When the relationship between House and Cuddy takes over an episode so overwhelmingly that you forget what the actual medical case was about...

I also have a problem with Cuddy's character becoming kind of weak.  In her relationship with House (especially in the first 8 episodes) we see her sad and confused and generally being played easily by House.  This truly does not fit her strong feminine role, and I for one do not like this portrayal.

Later in the season the show definitely picks back up.  The real turning point is episode 9 ""Larger Than Life"".  We really see the case as the focus of the episode.  The side stories with Talb and his wife and House and Cuddy are interesting but don't hog the spotlight.  It also picks up a bit more with the secondary characters getting more screen time.  I also enjoy Chase and Forman and their banter and rivalry.  The addition of a new team member starts as an annoyance, but once she gets comfortable in her role, Amber Tamblyn is good at being the 'annoying smarty pants'.  The other team members seem exasperated with her at times, and it really brings an interesting dynamic.

Like previous seasons, most of the cases are based in part on real life cases and events.  The medical mystery aspect is still fun and interesting, and the writers do a good job of portraying the cases without 'dumbing it down' too much.  I found myself googling certain terms on my phone at times (such as checking out when smallpox was eradicated and about the discovery of smallpox scabs in an envelope in a Civil War book that inspired an episode on this season).

But overall the episodes are three to five stars.  None of the weaker episodes are as bad as the worst episodes in season 4 (with the American Idol type fellowhip-off).  The weakest episodes in season 7 are just less focused and have muddled roles.  The strong episodes are very strong, and really showcase a nice variety of themes.  The acting is top notch, especially Hugh Laurie, Jessie Spencer, and Robert Sean Leonard.  There are some good guest appearances, and Candice Bergen is fun as Cuddy's mother.

All in all a good season, and worthy of watching through at least once.  It's still not up to the level of seasons 1 to 3, and it shows that overly sensational style of any series in it's later seasons (look at later seasons of Friends, Frasier, ER, or pretty much anything that went over 6 seasons and was one of the network's top shows).  But at the core, it still retains the medical mystery drama that we have all come to know and love.  And it stars Hugh Laurie.  And he's awesome.",1321488000,,3254,4.60695652173913

4174129,5,B003R0MF3K,"I have been a die-hard House fan since it came out a few years ago. Yeah, I definitely think Season 7 had more drama issues, but I'm not sure if it is really to the point of a ""soap opera"" as one reviewer says. As the end of Season 6 shows, Cuddy and House establish a relationship that is more than co-workers and friends. Cuddy tells House that she loves him and he never says it back. I really think that deep down he loves her too, but he is still displayed as an arrogant, conceited ass. And he spirals downward when things just don't go his way.

House definitely pushes the limit in quite a few episodes and it leaves you with your mouth open, thinking he's a crazy maniac. Thirteen's story is interesting how she comes and goes in several episodes. When she is absent, a new member, Martha Masters, a genius student that has over the top morals and ethics shines a new light on the team. I keep going back and forth if I like her or not because there were just some parts of Season 7 that I didn't think she made the right choice. She is an intriguing character though for sure.

Taub really has some drama in his life with wife, Rachel. On another note, the director and behind-the-scenes people did some amazing work on a few episodes that I think is worth noting: Bombshells and Get Happy. Talk about artistic and creative! Scenes show: a twisted, kind of creepy musical; zombies; 50s style kitchen; and a gunfight. HOW COOL!

Next, it's funny how some people wrote review of whole season after only few episodes. That's so stupid, my friends, cause you gave ""one stars"" because you didn't like that main characters had relationship...  If you're really fan of this great TV show you should know that at the end comes answer on everything.
Now about TV show. Mister Hugh Laurie is great as usually and I didn't say that because I like to watch at him whole episode like at in model, but because he is brilliant actor. He did a great job, at his face you could see happiness, sadness, pain, ... everything what House passed. Other actors are good, too, but everybody knows who is the boss. Okay, there were a small oscillations from episode to episode in story, for example - Taub's story was so boring to me, but other was really great.
As a big ""HOUSE M.D."" I'll watch this TV show until the end. Even if I wouldn't like some stuffs there, I'll give a chance to story. At the end, I have to repeat that people which call themselves ""great HOUSE fans"" and which spit on this TV show just because story wasn't on the way they wanted to be, should stop to do that.

The one constant has always been that he is an egotistical jerk, but absolutely brilliant at last minute diagnosis.  We forgave him being a jerk as long as he saved the patient.  Also in previous seasons he was an opiate addict, which added dimension to his character (in a very negative way).

Finally he ""kicks the habit"" -- until this last season.  What the writers failed to understand is that viewers don't mind their heroes having serious character flaws, as long as there is the possibility that this can be overcome -- it's called character arc in the business.  For House to slip back into addiction is lazy, bankrupt writing, which therefore makes all of the plots, and sub-plots depressing and ""we've seen this before"".  All of the other major characters don't fair well either -- they are charactatures of previous episodes and bring absolutely nothing new to this seasons plots.  They are redundant.

Viewers wanted to see House's brilliance in solving impossible medical cases -- that's what makes this semi-medical series fun -- not him continually gulping down a hand full of Vicodin every ten minutes and making stupid decisions (personally and professionally).  We wanted to see House conquer Mr. Everest and be at the top of his game -- we wanted to see a guy we could like.  The writers didn't understand this.

The viewer finally concludes at the end of this boring season that House does not deserve to be called a medical doctor, nor should he ever be allowed near a patient even as a candy striper.  He is not a friend to anyone, least of all himself, or the viewer.

If you have to see this last season -- which you no doubt do -- then rent it, because you will only watch it once.",1317772800,3,1918,4.663690476190476

With Cuddy constantly badgering him about talking about their relationship, and then she decides to break it off after one slip up, House is devastated and returns to his addiction. All along, Cuddy was heard to say ""I don't want to change him."" and yet that is exactly what she starts to do, all for herself. (Personally, I'm glad she's gone!) As Cuddy faces a possibly serious illness, she expects House to be  by her side through it all. In her true style, she prefers to ignore the fact that this is the first time in his life that House loves someone enough to be scared of being alone again. He takes Vicodin just once to ""give"" him the courage to be by her bedside, and when it's discovered she's not in any medical danger, she dumps him. Even Wilson gives her a berating because she expected him to change. The rest of season 7 deals with Cuddy and House trying to work together, with an ending that leaves the fans screaming ""WTG GREG!! About time someone took care of the witch!""

4174190,5,B003R0MF3K,"House M.D. has now gone through seven seasons. Each season has consisted of approximately 24 episodes (with the exception of Season Four, when the writer's strike of 2006 brought the show, along with most every other show, to a complete stop, and resulted in a truncated season). This means that House M.D. has moved significantly beyond the 100-show mark, that perilous and generally inflexible salient of a show's quality. We saw this as far back in the early 1960's with The Dick Van Dyke Show, when, at the height of its acclaim and popularity, Carl Reiner ended it so that the show could always be remembered as one that went on a high. We have, arguably, also witnesses multiple cases since that time when other shows, remaining huge money makers pass the 100-show threshold, because of fiduciary interests continued to move on, resulting in episodes that were increasingly awful to watch. (I will spare the listing. But by the way, one of the few shows to have overcome that ""rule"" is the acclaimed BBC show MI-5, which is now filming it's 10th, and final Season, perhaps giving nod to this unwritten truth surrounding television shows.)

House M.D. could have easily gone down this same route, extinguishing its quality as it progressed. But after going through the complete Seventh Season, I can happily report that, in my opinion, House M.D. has not yet suffered that fate. In spite of some unusual twists in story line and a number of unexpected diversions in the show (which I will not point out to help eliminate spoilers), the show fundamentally remains the fascinating story of a genius medical doctor who struggles with a terrible physical condition which seems to defy physical and psychological treatment. The writers and producers of the show have managed to keep the show refreshingly interesting and engrossing, and although the writers seem to manage to paint themselves into a corner at the end of each season, the next sees the story grow and change. Season Seven is no different.

Some House M.D. fans have written that they do not like of the story line changes of the past couple of years, some going as far to say that the show should have been ended at the completion of Season Six. I can see easily their point, and the argument has merit. On the other hand, there can be little denying that Season Seven has given everyone in the House M.D. family a chance to soar and to open their characters in a way we did not see in the earlier seasons. Much more physical comedy and biting sarcasm, for example, seems to be the rule in Season Seven. Strange settings and events, no stranger to House M.D., arise aplenty, and there is seemingly no end to the dramatic and sometimes ingenious devices used to brings the main characters into conflict, support, new paths, and old alliances.

All of this makes Season Seven incredibly interesting, fun, and dramatic. If you have not seen House M.D., this is not a good Season in which to enter, because it is largely built off the understanding of the previous six seasons. (I would rather recommend for you that you go back to Season One, and start there. Then the rest will be much more enjoyable and powerful to you.) But for those who have watched House perform his skills over the past six years, I can't really do anything but recommend Season Seven. And perhaps, more than any Season, when you watch this, sit back and enjoy the more pronounced (and relaxed) dramatic, comedic, and musical skills of the group. They are allowed to sail here more than in any other Season. It's really quite a story to watch.

House M.D. I'll miss it when it's over. It can't go on forever, and there is talk that the upcoming Season Eight may be its last. But its been one of the most unusual and entertaining shows I've ever seen. I don't agree with all of it, and can't go along with House himself in some of his beliefs and actions, but its one of those stories that has been cast with an actor--Hugh Laurie--who could pull it off with aplomb. Wow. Even with its shortcomings and twists that not everyone agrees were good ideas, this has been an amazing show.

4174212,2,B003R0MF3K,"What has happened to the series in Season 7 is just so sad.  And I don't mean House's relapse and the loss of his relationship with Cuddy.  I mean - bad writing, bad direction, losing an intern who would have been a big bonus to this show, relying on gimmicky scenes to move the story forward (see the episode ""Bombshells"" - did we really need House's versions of 'Butch Cassidy', 'All that Jazz', and some ancient TV shows?).  I could go on and on.  It's just so sad.

I love ""House"", I adore Hugh Laurie, I've never missed an episode in 7 seasons, and I'll keep watching through Season 8.  But, in my humble, unimportant opinion , this series was the antithesis of all that was good in Seasons 1 through 6.

4174215,3,B003R0MF3K,"I bought this blu-ray pack because I love House and I can't imagine anyone would be on the fence of buying this pack. You're either a House fan or you're not and reading amazon reviews won't change that. However, I wanted to talk about the packaging of the actual discs and the experience I had watching the first couple episodes.

Short version: it's terrible. If you bought House Season 6 or movies such as In Bruges or Quantum or Solace (I think?) you'll be familiar with this god awful freeware that Universal uses in all of their Blu-Rays. Load times are way too long. From putting the disc in to seeing the start of an episode, that process can take upwards of five minutes. You might be thinking ""Well it's only five minutes."" But you have to imagine situations of when you'd watch House. Probably with some friends or if you're eating dinner and want to watch something.

In five minutes you can lose interest or be half way through your meal. Now add on the fact that you basically have to repeat the process once per episode and in three hours of watching House you've probably spent upwards of 20-30 minutes starring at a black screen. It's ridiculous. Every Blu-Ray I own that has this BD Live set up has the same problem. Other Blu-Rays that have their own system, they work perfectly, load instantly and have no issues. The fact that this Menu setup is still being used is because not enough people are complaining, I'd suggest either buying the regular DVDs if you can do without HD or find a customer contact for the maker of these Blu-Rays and complain, it's really terrible.

I also forgot to add in there that if you pause the show, after about thirty seconds a screen saver of the ""Universal"" logo shows up. Sounds great except that screen savers are for one purpose: to save your screen from burned-in images. This screen saver is incredibly bright and more importantly you can't resume from the screen saver. You have to hit stop and then press play, which reloads the disc from the beginning. Remember that five minute wait I was talking about? Imagine if that happened in the middle of an episode and you had to do it again, plus added time to get back to your positioning. It's garbage.

____________________

As for the show itself: I'm a House apologist. I loved seasons 1-4 (minus Tritter and Vogler) I didn't mind the transition of a new cast, it made sense, besides House's Head is the best episode of the series and it wouldn't exist without Season 4. Season 5 and 6 definitely declined in quality but it was more-so individual episodes that were cringe worthy not the series itself (Anything with Foreman and 13 was awful and pretending that Wilson was going to leave the show was a joke).

Despite all that I've stuck with the show because the good episodes are really great. I haven't seen the entirety of Season 7 (I missed the first few episodes) but from what I did see, outside of the very first episode and the very last episode, this is one of the better seasons. I might even rank it in the same category as Season 4. The show has been going for so long they've obviously lost the mystery and excitement of ""what crazy thing will happen next"" but they've done so much already I can't imagine how they'd escalate it. With that in mind they focus on just interesting individual cases which are medically interesting and I think the drama elements are more toned down overall which is how they should be.

The first episode is pointless at the last episode is frustrating but everything in between is great. Like I said before, the Blu-Rays themselves are garbage but if you can grit your teeth through it or decide to buy the regular DVDs (that don't have the same menus set up) then you should enjoy House Season 7.

P.S. The packaging of the discs themselves is three holders, with discs 1 and 2 stacked on top of each other and discs 3 and 4 stacked on top of each other on the different holder. Disc 5 is by itself. I don't know if this is better or worse than the Season 6 holders since this new version may cause scratches (I think? Not sure) but at least they're trying.",1314662400,3,4116,4.500669344042838
4174216,3,B003R0MF3K,"Unlike many other longtime viewers House, I passionately defended this show throughout the cast reboot in Season 4 and thought that Season 5 might have been the best effort yet. Then the writers decided to moralize House by getting him off the pills, and everything fell apart. House is not a sympathetic character, and it's almost impossible to successfully portray him as such. Season 3 did an admirable job of contrasting him against Tritter to prop up his good traits, but most viewers still recognized that he can't be changed, he is a character of habit defined by his moments of lucidity during his Vicodin binges. His sarcastic, monotone, pessimistic worldview is at the core of the show, but instead of embracing the good, the writers decided to delve into the rehab plotline, almost as if they seemed forced to merely because the main character was a drug addict and it was ""the right thing to do"". This change brought forth the black hole that was Season 6; a meandering, forgettable, and downright mediocre 22 episode entry, defined by a cliche-packed magic music box moment in the premier and a cringe-worthy monologue in the finale where he expressed his feelings for Cuddy.

Thankfully, Season 7 is a slight step forward, but it still isn't close to matching seasons 1-5. The musical chairs game of characters continues after Cameron's exit in Season 6. Thirteen randomly disappears yet again, while new protege Masters kicks it around admirably for about a 8 episode binge before being written off, possibly out of boredom by the writers, possibly because they never really had a purpose for adding her to the show. The once exciting interaction between House and Cuddy is toned down with their developing relationship, but still has its moments. Like many other reviewers here, I have to ask; what happened to Wilson? He is outright missing in a handful of episodes this season, and even in the episodes where he is featured, his screen time is well below 10 minutes. When an episode does revolve around Wilson, it usually centers on the pointless and obviously doomed rekindled romance with his ex-wife Sam. Thankfully, there are handful of bright spots in the season. ""Two Stories"" is a classic episode which left a big grin on my face, a perfect balance of humor, unique storytelling, and something completely new not seen before on House. The same can be said about ""Bombshells"", a surreal musical themed episode containing a classic parody of ""Two and a half Men"" featuring House, Wilson, and Cuddy's daughter, easily one of the funniest moments in the history of the show. If you ignore the head-scratching and frustrating finale, this season wasn't actually that bad, but that doesn't mean it was great. Fans of the show will probably find something they like in Season 7, but I would highly recommend that people wishing to get into House start from Season 1 so you fully understand how great this show was during 2005-2009.",1312934400,2,2949,4.898

Season 7 of ""House"" is definitely different than any of the previous seasons, and I believe it is arguably one of the best. Although these episodes are quite different from the ones we're used to, I think the show is going in a direction that is both creative and intriguing. In his relationship with Cuddy, we are able to see House in a way that we've never seen him before. He shows us that after everything he's been through, he's still capable of loving someone. Some of the best scenes can be seen in Season 7, especially the scene where House jumps from his hotel balcony. This is one of the most intense scenes I've seen throughout the entire series. While it's only a couple minutes long, it is able to give the viewer a ton of information and creates so many different emotional reactions. If there was any inclination that House had changed for the better after rehab and his relationship with Cuddy, those feelings are completely gone after this scene. House is even more destructive and unpredictable than he was in the previous seasons. As strange as it seems, this is the House character that fans have grown to love. I'm interested to see how the story will pick up in Season 8.",1310860800,3,1203,4.574074074074074
4174252,5,B003R0MF3K,"The relationship between House and Cuddy has been coming, and in season seven it is here. Many have complained about the writer's not doing justice to the relationship. And that is where I strongly disagree. The writers have created a character from season 1 who has been damaged beyond repair. Every relationship with any woman, whether it be Stacy, or even Cameron, has failed. I don't think it could have been more in character the way everything played out this year. Who really expected the relationship between House and Cuddy to be all kisses and hugs? Knowing what you do about the character, you know that this is incredible growth: the act of trying to be with her. But, there is only so much our damaged doc can offer. Whether or not that is enough is something I'll let you watch and see.

(up above is spoiler free, down below is the review for those who have seen the season. If you haven't I suggest reading the above paragraph and stopping)

Let's get into the fabric of this season. It is all about change, all about House trying to be happy. In the first episode ""what now"" he tells Cuddy they shouldn't be together because he'll eventually do something to make her leave him. In different words it's what he says to Stacy before breaking it off with her in season 2. He knows he is damaged. He knows that anyone who gets close to him will eventually leave. Cuddy becomes an exception to this rule... for 15 episodes, and then like everyone else leaves him.
I blame Cuddy for what ultimately ends the season. She kept pushing House to let out his feelings, even after (in many ways) she tore out what was left of his heart. No one can say that House wasn't trying in the relationship. He was trying a lot harder than Cuddy. The fact that she ended it over one slip up shows that she never really wanted it to begin with. She took advantage of him in his most vulnerable state, and went for something she didn't fully want. I feel she was lucky that she only lost part of her house because of it. A lot worse could have happened. House was not House driving that car up her yard and through her dining room. That House was years of anger manifesting, possessing him to do something he never would have done otherwise.
As a huge fan of the show, I feel a need to defend the negative reviews. If you are a casual viewer, go back to the beginning and start this incredible story from the pilot on. Let me talk about the negative reviews. Critics and fans alike attack the ending of the season, saying ""House could have killed Rachel. He didn't know where she was, and for that reason I find the character now unwatchable,"" or ""House has jumped many sharks, but this is the biggest"" which by the way is the most overused term in the world. It's an argument with some weight to it. But, I have a better one. As I said above, in that moment it was the anger manifesting. That wasn't the House of season 1 or even earlier season 7. That was a House trying to pick up the pieces of what was left of his life, only to have them knocked out of his hands over and over again. In many ways I think that's the point of the ending of the season. He has gone too far. He has cut ties with everyone close. If he returns, won't he do time in jail? Won't he lose his medical license?
To answer those questions, I'll say this. I have absolute faith in these writers to take us to the next point in House's journey. It will be realistic, in character, and must watch tv. According to Hugh Laurie, season 8 is probably the final season. Why would you jump ship now? See it to the end. Maybe you'll appreciate the show for what it's always been: nothing short of amazing.",1308960000,81,3666,4.334788937409025

I give this season a 5 star rating along with it's other companions.

This season you could work things out before they happened. I felt the love arc was poorly handled and I don't believe Cuddy would have acted that way. It wasn't like she didn't know what she was getting into. I felt the final episode was a bit silly. House is reckless, but he isn't stupid. Everything he does is a calculated gamble and I don't know if its because the show has new writers or what has changed, but I was left wanting more. Still it is a great show. I think the high standards of the earlier series is what I am after. I will happily watch season eight, but I think they could have done so much more with season seven.

Even the most outlandish of stunts seem plausible because no character ever strays from their core values. However, in season 7, House is showing its seams. The universe of House completely unravels in the second half of the season as House's character is reduced to the basest, most ridiculous plot ploys. Fans suffered every week as they watched their favorite characters, especially House, reduced to shallow, hypocritical parodies of themselves.

If House can survive for a half-way decent ending (since any chance of redemption was thoroughly murdered, let's say, like a car driving through a dining room) the writers are going to have to do something drastic - ie, returning to the shows roots and not being so [insert expletive here].

4174291,2,B003R0MF3K,"I am a fan of ""House"", have all the previous seasons on DVD, and while I will be getting this one, it won't be with much enthusiam.  There are episodes from previous seasons I can watch over and over (Three Stories, Birthmarks, Wilson, numerous others), some like ""Houses' Head and Wilson's Heart"" that are hard to watch because of their emotional intensity, and some, like ""The Down Low"" which mixed farce and tragedy so brilliantly.  But to be perfectly and painfully honest...there has not been a single episode this season that I'm in any hurry to see again; in fact, many of them I can't even remember...the scripts were just so lacking.  Lacking in interesting plots, interesting PoTW, and, most importantly, interesting and believable character development.  ""House"" has an emotional setback, goes off the rails, and does stupid, dangerous, self-destructive things.  Seriously?  What is new about that?  And yes, i too was bugged by the whole ""House and Cuddy"" romance,  Why?  Since day one, the Powers That Be have stated that ""House"" would never be able to settle down and be happy..so what was the point of the whole broken romance?  Since they, and we, knew it was doomed from the start, there really didn't seem to be any point to it, other than some sem-nude scenes for Laurie and Edelstein. And don't get me started on the others.

But I have to say this..the interaction between ""House"" and ""Wilson"" has always been my favorite part of the show, and those moments were sadly lacking in this season. Many of Wilson's scenes seemed forced, as if they knew they needed to include a ""H & W"" moment, but couldn't come up with one that actually fit with what was going on in the episode; many of them were generic ""House does something stupid/dangerous/pointless and Wilson berates him"" moments. Most of the time I couldn't help thinking ""and why are these guys friends?""

I can understand why Lisa Edlestein left, since I can't see where they can go with her character, and I hope they can come up with a decent plot line or two for ""Wilson"", because otherwise they're wasting Robert Sean Leonard's time and talent.  I'll be watching season 8, if for no other reason, to see how they get themselves out of the hole they dug for ""House"", and I will get season 7, but I have to hope they have some decent extras to make it worthwhile.",1306540800,12,2342,4.682926829268292
4174292,3,B003R0MF3K,"""House"" has, for six years, put its best foot forward in creating compelling, character-driven drama and astounding its audience. And, occasionally, this latest seventh season did that as well. But that's the problem. It used to do it regularly. The show begins where the very gritty sixth season finale, ""Help Me"", left off; House and Cuddy have agreed to start a relationship together, and this becomes the cornerstone of the season. The first half deals with more comedic storylines and delves into the other characters all in one package. As a whole, they're fun, enjoyable episodes, but they lack that extra bite House is infamous for, which I blame on the disconnect between the patients and the doctors' personal drama. What once was intricately woven together now scrambles on top of each other; cockfighting for attention. The second half of the season gets progressively darker in tone, and while this was a thematic that House had no trouble with in the past, it really fell on its face here. The thirteenth episode, ""Two Stories"", is where we enter questionable territory. Gimmicks became the norm, and all the problems this season had already had remained. That disconnect between the doctors and the patients I mentioned earlier is easier to forgive with lighter stories, but when aspects such as murder, betrayal, and insanity come into play, things become convoluted and messy. It's not all terrible, however. The final three episodes are a real treat, and while they may not be remembered as the best, they've cemented themselves firmly in the show's middle, I believe. The very last episode, ""Moving On"", ends with a pretty big game changer that should leave everyone who saw it wondering where can the show go from there.

If you stopped enjoying House long ago, there's no need to pick this up. If you're still with it like myself, I don't see how this was bad enough to not complete your collection. I got into the show the summer between the fourth and fifth seasons, which resulted in first-day purchases for Seasons 5 and 6. I certainly will be buying Season 7, but considering the content, I'll wait for a price reduction.",1306368000,5,2147,4.898351648351649

4174296,4,B003R0MF3K,"Yes, it would be completely unfair to review a DVD set no one has had the opportunity to buy. I am not commenting on a non existent box Set. I am here to analyze Season 7 of House as a 'worthy"" product. First, Season 6 was the worst. I hated the entire second half of the season (right after Cameron, who showed great sense, departed). As soon as she left, the producers felt the need to 'change: the tone and look of the show. GONE: the haunting music, melodramatics, and handfuls of Vicodin. IN:Moralizing, A rather forced (it seemed to me) beginning of a relationship between Cuddy (the most boring character on the show next to TAUB)and House. Almost all of the 'cases"" in the second half of season six were completely forgettable.  Season six...ended with the House-Cuddy relationship in a teaser (was it real?).

Season 7 only confirmed it was indeed the real deal. And it dragged on and on, week after week. Gone again were any references to HOUSE IN PAIN Wasn't he addicted to vicodin and shooting Morphine because he has a deformed LEG ? They had the audacity to blame his vicodin need on emotional crutches in Season 7.  Let me get this straight---his leg only hurts when he is emotionally insecure? Obviously the writers are pandering to the AMA, the FDA, and the FBI in not showing their best character as a strung out drug addict in need, week after week. It worked well for the first few seasons. Fine, change it up, but don't INSULT the viewers and anyone else in PAIN by dismissing his mangled leg and need for Vicodin as an emotional crutch. It's bad writing and irresponsible. I can't wait for marijuana to become LEGAL in Jersey so House can start toking in the halls of Princeton-Plainsboro. What will Cuddy have to say about THAT (lol).

Season 7  is up to episode 18 as I write this as they just aired the return of ""13"" tonight in in episode I was almost bored with. There were some nice moments but the medical case seemed too difficult and then too easy to solve , especially without HOUSE there to 'cure"" or find the right answer. Let's face it, without HOUSE in the mix, as a patient, your chances of Chase, Taub, Cuddy or Foreman finding the real cause of your illness is  near nil. You think after 7 seasons Foreman and Chase would become better diagnosticians.

So Season 7..episode for episode--is BETTER than Season 6 as of episode 18. A lot of well written and interesting cases this season. I think even some of the best (but not THE BEST) episodes in two seasons. Nothing will top ""Three Stories""  for pure genius, or ""House's Head"" for bothe emotional and intellectual completeness or  even ""Games"" for its amazing human emotional core appeal. Those are the kinds of episodes that made House a one-off. A unique entity that no other TV series on network dares to go. Most other 'dramatic"" series show characters who just  REACT to situations. We know nothing of them as human beings (every one of those CSI or LAw and Order type shows fit the same mold) HOUSE , the series, and the character is the exception. Even compared to other ""medical"" shows, Hosue is far and above them in terms of human interactions, meaning, philosophy and lessons in life.

For that reason I did not buy the entire Cuddy-House fiascao this year because House will always be House. It took most of the season and One great episode (the one where House is Born-Again by jumping into a pool) to prove to both House and the audience..he is who he is. Godo riddence to Cuddy and her set ways. A decent season but still dragged out by a dozen episodes of a relationship that seemed forced from the start. Still the writing improved and the cases were far better than Season six. Olivia Wilde's hiatus and Jennifer Morrison's departure defintely left a void in the sex appeal department (Sorry, Cuddy in her low cut tops doesn't 'cut"" it for me..she's far too annoying as a character. Masters, well, she's almost virginal. A few episodes to go this season. If last season and Season 5 were any indication, you can be sure there will be some major twist or cliff-hanger ending to this season. Many good episodes, I give it 4 stars, but a far cry from the first 5 incredible seasons that made house the best drama EVER on TV and House it's best character.",1302566400,8,4260,4.5483028720626635
4174297,4,B003R0MF3K,"Update:  I just saw a pre release screener of episode one of series 8 of HOUSE.  I sat there stunned afterwards.  It was totally different from anything I was expecting.  Hugh Laurie does his usual outstanding acting job.  Every other cast member is someone new because he is serving out a prison sentence. I'm not sure what this is.  Is it a dream or a psychotic break due to more drug ingestion?  I have no idea. It seems fairly real but I'm just not sure.  It seems weird that not even Wilson visits him.  I know a lot of viewers are not tuning in for season 8 because season 7 was so bizarre, especially the ending.  If you are one of these viewers, you may want to reconsider that position.

My original review, filed before above rant:

I am a fan of this show from day one.  I am a Hugh Laurie fan from back when no one knew who he was, when he was playing Bertie Wooster with his comedy partner Stephen Fry as Jeeves. Big a fan as I am though, I have to say the quality has been all over the map this season.  If you asked me whether to buy it, I'd say ""maybe"" and caution you that the whole thing might be no more than 3.5 stars.

I still think he is the best thing in the show. There is no one else even close to giving him a run for the money.  No one else has his range.  His supporting cast varies in how much one can stand of them.  Taub's ""problems"" for me this season have been a real turn off. His problems are all self created and he whines about them constantly.  The other three supporting doctors en suite score a little higher with, surprisingly, the new one, Amber Tamblyn, scoring the best.  The other two just don't have much to work with this season and overall come off a bit blah.

Faring much better than the team are both Cuddy and Wilson.  I enjoyed both of their roles this season.  Cuddy tries to handle House as her boyfriend and her mother as a patient. Some of the best episodes are with these two, with Candace Bergen as the mother going to head to toe with House.  Wilson is back on the singles market after more problems on the romance front.  He and House are well cut out for one another as they are both disasters when it comes to women.  For entirely different reasons they wreck up but they are disasters nonetheless.  I know many people HATE this aspect of the show but frankly I give the writers credit for trying to explore and get underneath a real problem for many doctors: the inability to form lasting marriages.

Many of the cases are not interesting this season.  In fact, often when they went to work on their cases I found myself rooting around for something else to keep me occupied until the show got interesting again. Perhaps the cases got so esoteric and remotely plausible that I had about as much interest in them as House (hardly any).  House is often out of the office doing something else while the team has to phone him for advice.  I can understand why he is bored with the whole thing but the problem is that the viewer shouldn't be!

House has some very cute episodes with Rachel and the school Rachel aspires to attend.  I didn't expect to enjoy those but I did.  This was yet another example of House being better outside of the hospital.

All of these shows have a natural cycle and it could be that everyone is just running out of something interesting to do with these characters. Seven years is a long time to last in series network tv.  It could be that the well is just running dry creatively and there is not much creative life left in the show.

The very last episode of this season was the best one.  In it, Hugh Laurie conveys a moment of sheer distilled rage with absolute mastery. It is triggered by devastating emotional loss which he conveys almost wordlessly.  No one else in the cast is capable of this kind of acting which is why he remains the whole show.

4174316,1,B003R0MF3K,"(Disclaimer: Huge ""House M.D."" fan, with Seasons 1-6 in my DVD collection. Season 6 was a bit mediocre but there were some redeeming episodes.)

If the saying is true that it would take a million monkeys a million years to produce the works of Shakespeare, then Season 1 of House is probably 100,000 monkeys at 100,000 years. Not immortal, but really damn good.

Season 7, on this same scale, is ""100 monkeys with a case of Jaegermeister, one weekend, tops."" 99% of the wit and cleverness is gone. Also gone is any pretense that these are believable characters, in that their actions appear to spring from character, rather than whatever maze the writers feel like shoving them through that week. Also, in a medical drama, I expect *patients* to be in life-and-death struggles. But two weeks in a row--in March, 2011, as I write this--we get episodes where the leads are supposedly in a life and death struggle, only to have some deus ex machina explanation at the last second, where the writers pop up and say ""just fooling!""

Another mystery: after being a lead in the show for Seasons 4-6, Olivia Wilde gets a title credit in this season...but has not yet appeared in a SINGLE episode. Not that I'm begging for her return, but it's just one more instance of ""what the hell is going on with this show?""

I haven't stopped watching yet (more fool me), but I'm about to. And I have no intention of buying this season on DVD. I fervently hope that they kill the series at the end of this season, and let Hugh Laurie move on to better things, 'cause he deserves them. The blame, 100%, is on rubbish writing.

*** Update from after the Season 8 series finale: I lied (everybody lies, right?). I kept watching, every episode of Seasons 7 and 8, right up to the finale. Too much of a fanboy to quit, I guess. In retrospect, I still stand by my opinion that Season 7 was dreadfully written, and is useful only for purposes of understanding why Season 8 started where it did.

The acting throughout the season was good with Hugh Laurie, Lisa Edelstein, and Robert Sean Leonard leading the seasoned cast. The costumes and sets were nice. But the scripts and direction often left a good deal to be desired.",1295740800,16,653,4.945454545454545
4174337,1,B003R0MF3K,"At first glance, House seems like just another banal sitcom masquerading as something more ""smart"" and/or ""sexy,"" which is true--but look a bit deeper and you'll see its success rides on the fact it's a love letter to generation Y detachment and forced irony; bittersweet emotional pornography for those whose lives have failed them.

Just look at the DVD cover. ""Love sucks."" Cue a thousand soul-numbingly  boring housewives nodding their heads with a knowing ""MMMM-hmmmm."" These producers really know their audience, I'll give them that.",1293926400,9,539,5.329411764705882

4174339,5,B003R0MF3K,The makers of this show went out on a limb to do this episode and I couldn't be more grateful.  The script was well done and the acting was marvelous.  This is a keeper.,1290816000,,169,3.9411764705882355
4174340,5,B003R0MF3K,"So far season 7 has been ""House Light"".  It was good to see House happy and life finally going his way - great girlfriend, great job, challenging and winnable cases.  However, really light scripts, unknown actors and actresses, virtually every scene shot in the hospital set and it was getting tedious.  It was as if the budget for House was reduced so much that they could barely afford to make any show at all.

THIS episode, fortunately, brought back the real ""House"" with a vengence.  Top actors brought in for visiting parts, some scenes shot outside in Florida on open water, great CGI opening, period opening sequence, House being socially unique in getting a Dutch translation and a case so difficult even House was making mistakes.  It is episodes like this one that make House a great show.",1289952000,,800,4.760869565217392
