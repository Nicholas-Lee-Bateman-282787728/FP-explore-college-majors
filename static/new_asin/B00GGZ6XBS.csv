8622947,3,B00GGZ6XBS,No clips with the mighty Gary Moore line up unfortunately.....but seeing the beast John Sykes play makes this worth a watch.  Decent live doc...but certainly not great.,1525824000,,168,5.222222222222222
8622948,3,B00GGZ6XBS,"If you are looking for a live compendium of some of Thin Lizzy's most well-known songs, this is a decent one.  It lacks some of the intensity of their live albums, but each song is competently performed and is a good introduction to the music of Thin Lizzy.  Average, but still worlds better than today's Top 40.",1522281600,,312,4.456140350877193
