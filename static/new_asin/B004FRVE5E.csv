8428253,1,B004FRVE5E,"I was so excited to have order this Soul train DVD by Time Life but was so disappointed.  DVD states performances by Luther vandross, the Spinners and Stylistics but it mainly featured the soul train dancers.  Showed no performances by these artist except War.  What a disappointed.  I would never order another product by Time Life.  Will wait until Don Cornelius or producers of Soul Train release the DVDs of the actual performances as viewed by us back in the 70s and 80s.  You're better off saving your money.  Very very disappointing.  Shame on Time Life.",1327622400,13,561,4.770833333333333
