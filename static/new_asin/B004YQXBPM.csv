4503132,5,B004YQXBPM,"I am a complete WWII nut and the amazing political and military leadership that were on the stage during that period. None is more compelling than the difficult and self-important DeGaulle. My study of him led me from WWII, to the French in Vietnam and finally the French in Algeria. Mind blowing documentary about that period of time for the French coming out of Vietnam and how so many of the Algerian Soldiers who fought with them, having been captured or defecting decided to go home and liberate their country from the French.

Nor did I know that the size of the French population was so large in Algeria; I knew about it's Vichy collaboration but this documentary takes it to a whole new level; too include something I really did not know, the coup de etat in Algeria and how close it came to the mainland before DeGaulle returned with the backing of the Algerians who thought he would keep them French. Fascinating stuff this documentary.",1365206400,,946,4.664670658682635

This excellent DVD set ""Algerian War 1954-1962: Roots of Counterinsurgency"" is a very good produced period documentary covering this conflict in detail from its ""roots"" to independence. The Algerian War was a revolution against France by the Algerian independence movements from 1954 to 1962, which led to Algeria gaining its independence from France. An important decolonization war, it was a complex conflict characterized by guerrilla warfare, maquis fighting, terrorism against civilians, the use of torture on both sides, and counter-terrorism operations by the French Army. The conflict was also a civil war between loyalist Algerians who believed in a French Algeria and their insurrectionist Algerian Muslim counterparts. Effectively started by members of the National Liberation Front (FLN) on November 1, 1954, during the Red All Saints' Day, the conflict shook the foundations of the French Fourth Republic (1946-58) and led to its eventual collapse.

Despite complaints from the military command in Algiers, the French government was reluctant for many months to admit that the Algerian situation was out of control and that what was viewed officially as a pacification operation had developed into a major war. By 1956 France had committed more than 400,000 troops to Algeria. Although the elite colonial infantry airborne units and the Foreign Legion bore the brunt of offensive counterinsurgency combat operations, approximately 170,000 Muslim Algerians also served in the regular French army, most of them volunteers. France also sent air force and naval units to the Algerian theater.

The French Army shifted its tactics at the end of 1958 to the use of mobile forces deployed on massive search-and-destroy missions against FLN strongholds. Within the next year, Salan's successor, General Maurice Challe, appeared to have suppressed major rebel resistance. But political developments had already overtaken the French Army's successes. Anybody interested in the study of counter-insurgency will find this set of DVD very interesting. I highly recommend this DVD set!",1353542400,9,2111,5.652996845425868

4503136,4,B004YQXBPM,"The Algerian War was long and torturous for both France and Algeria.  This documentary covers the troubled conflict rather well. It combines very well restored footage with a compelling narrative.  The only caveat is that while it covers the progress of the war well, the Algerian War was very complex.  A little background might help one understand everything covered by the documentary.  But, for the price and time invested, it's a real bargain.

4503137,5,B004YQXBPM,"Documentaries addressing the war in Algeria are rather scarce. I was very pleased to find this one. It contains footage, as well as interviews with participants in the war from both sides, and bystanders that got in the way, like newspapermen (who were tortured).
I gained some unexpected insights into this war that I hadn't realized before, or read anywhere while pursuing this subject. I won't mention what they were, because I would prefer you to find your own.
If you are at all curious why Marsailles burned a few years ago (along with a lot of other French cities) you may find some reasons here, in these films.

I enjoyed how each film stands alone, but viewed in sequence, gives a detailed background about how things came to pass, and how bad things got, and how things ended.

Perhaps this set of documentaries leans a bit left, perhaps not. But I found the story telling even-handed and insightful.",1328313600,6,911,4.723270440251572

...If I could, I would give this four and a half stars.  There are five segments plus a ""bonus"" on U.S. welcoming Algerian independence.  Filmed at the time, the ""bonus"" has some interesting footage, but seems to have been produced by somebody hopelessly optimistic... almost to the point of WW2 propaganda.
.
...The other five segments command far more attention and respect.  The first... the background is good enough... but sets the stage for the remaining four... each more powerful than the last.
.
...There will be some on either side who might complain that it is not ""objective...""  Blood, guilt, shame earned by both sides and amply demonstrated here.  Unlike (the splendid propaganda piece) ""The Battle Of Algiers"", it is close enough to objective.
.
...The misguided violence of some of the more rational in the OAS related to France having promised safety to Vietnamese allies in one war... then abandoning them... and preparing to do the same to Moslem allies in Algeria becomes at least understandable.  The military is never fit to rule... and the actions of some in the French Army in Algeria reinforced that reality.  But the French government's actions deserve little more respect.
.
...The FLN had no intention of an enlightened peace... an ""Appomattox...""  While the documentary mentions the many Jews that fled when the Pied Noirs did... it's one lapse was failing to mention that many Jews had supported the FLN.  Their reward was to be told by the FLN to leave or die.
.
...As one author said about the Korean War... ""The lesson is that it happened...""

4503140,5,B004YQXBPM,"Since this title looked suspiciously familiar, I did a little research and found that this is a re-issue of the excellent ""La Guerre d' Algerie,"" by directors Yves Courriere and Phillippe Monnier.  It was released in France in March 1972 and later released to English speaking viewers in 1975. It has been re-released a few more times since and I recall watching portions of this excellent documentary on a PBS channel in the late 1980s.  The original was 4 hours and 40 minutes long, but this version is divided into four sets, each with three DVDs ranging between 104 and 150 minutes of viewing time. As I recall, it provides not only a history of the conflict, but its origins, and shows contemporary news footage of the conflict as well as interviews from the various participants, journalists who covered this conflict, and political advisors of the time from the Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN) to the office of French President De Gaulle.

The documentary was originally released only 10 years after the end of the war when the conflict was still fresh on the minds of both the French and the Algerians as well as other participants.  According to the IMBd, ""cobblestones were thrown at the faade of the Saint-Sverin Cinema as a screening of ""La guerre d'Algrie"" took place in Paris on 22nd October 1971"".  The war still has a bitter impact on both countries to this day. It was not until 1999 that the Algerian War was allowed to be taught in French public schools.

This whole tragedy might possibly had been averted as late as only five years before the war had France recognized the Algerians as French citizens and bestowed all the rights of citizenship. However, many French politicians feared that French culture would be deluded and become Moslem oriented, and would result in a shift of political power. They were supported by the Pied Noir, the French citizens of Algeria, for whom the status quo gave them political and economical advantage over the native Algerians. The end result was tragic.

An observation I may want to add is that we Americans view this sad episode as just another hopeless colonial war.  However, for the French, Algeria was France and was considered another department of Metropolitan France no different than one of the 50 States of our Union. Therefore, a majority of the French people viewed it as a war no different as if Texas or California decided it wanted to secede from the U.S. and become independent. The French tried to convince NATO to enter the war claiming that Metropolitan France was being attacked by an insurgency supported by an external threat - Nasser's Egypt and the Soviets.  The Eisenhower Administration refused to buy that line of thinking and voted against it. This added just another reason for resentment and mistrust by the soon to be elected President Charles de Gaulle and would have significant ramifications on American-French relations within the decade following the war.",1410566400,4,2960,4.904
4503141,4,B004YQXBPM,"This three-DVD set containing the documentary in five episodes produced for British television in the 1980's is quite excellent, and highly recommended for those who are interested in the French experience in Algeria, but have little background knowledge of the period.  The first disc attempts to cover the history of the French in Algeria, and the cultural and social makeup of the region.  This, because of its function, is a trifle less dramatic than the following episodes.  The second and third disc have two different hour-long episodes each, which describe how the insurgency began, the Pied Noir's reaction, the French army's reaction, the tactics used in fighting the insurgency, the return of Charles de Gualle as the Algerian problem broke government after government, the political maneuvering to find a solution, and the terror campaign conducted by the OAS.

There is no such thing as an objective documentary, but some wear their opinions more openly than others.  Unfortunately, I've reached the conclusion that the less subjectivity one sees in a documentary, the more careful you should be, because that only means the filmmakers were better at concealing their bias from the viewer.  In ALGERIAN WAR, it is nearly impossible to pick up a 'slant', or an outright bias toward one side or the other, though there are groups and personalities involved in the war that come off as less admirable than others.  One has to determine whether he was 'led' in that direction by the filmmakers, or if it derives from the actions of the historical participants.  The producers of ALGERIAN WAR try to sidestep this question by relying heavily on newsreel footage from the time, and on interviews with many of its leading figures still alive years after the conflict.  Still, it is difficult to come away from the production without forming an opinion that such-and-such group was in the wrong, or that another group was justified.  Perhaps it is human nature to form such opinions, but I have to remind myself it is unproductive to judge past peoples for their action because that leads to an attitude of 'it can't happen here'.  Better to simply try to learn from the outcome, and decide whether the past's attitudes and actions are those we would choose today.

And that leads directly into an almost uncanny moment of dja vu as the documentary details the French army's intelligence-gathering tactics.  The descriptions, the recrimination, and regret over the use of torture during the Battle of Algiers and other periods parallel so closely the debate 50 years later that went on in America about Guantanamo that it was startling.  And, even though we are not as far away in time from the 'War on Terror' as we are from the Algerian conflict, I think the judgment on both those policies is properly negative.  Which brings me back to the point about judging peoples from the past: If we judge the people to be 'wrong' or holding the wrong ideas, then that leaves open the possibility that the *tactics* of those people could still be employed as long as *we* are right-minded.  To prove the point--the French were less than fifteen years away from the terror of the Gestapo, yet many people in a position of authority (but not all, by any means) saw no problem employing similar tactics on the Algerians.

This insight, or reminder, if you will, into human behavior and the use (or un-use, in this case) of the lessons of the past made ALGERIAN WAR worth the viewing, even if there had been no other positives.  Yet the whole series is well-done, if, perhaps unavoidably, condensed. It is a very easily digestible way to become familiar with a subject that I have not seen or heard much more of than only the most cursory treatment.  It is, I think, an excellent overview, and perfect for launching into deeper study, should one wish, or as a way of rounding out one's education about mid-twentieth century history.

4503146,5,B004YQXBPM,"If you've read Alistair Horne's excellent A Savage War of Peace(Algeria 1954-62),this is a superb accompanying DVD, made originally for Channel 4 ,written/directed by Peter Batty. But you'll need to keep the book to hand to check up on a lot of the key figures from both sides,who are interviewed,as no names are given or the roles they played,nor the localities or the dates when things happened or localities,although you may be able to deduce these through the structuring of the film into 5 chapters over 2 discs:-

Part 1:The Road to Rebellion,how France became involved in Algeria, the rise of nationalism, the critical early months of the uprising in 1954 and 1955;
Part2: A Question of Conscience,includes theBattle of Algiers(1956-7),the collapse of the 4th Republic(1958),the issue of torture,with tortured /torturers speaking frankly;
Part 3: I Understand You,showing DeGaulle's return to power with the extraordinary events of May 1958,with his victories during 1959 that brought the Algerian rebellion to near collapse;
Part 4: To the Barricades,the increasing disillusionment amongst French settlers and French Army officers in Algeria with De Gaulle's policies that found expression in rebellion ,fierce rioting,the founding in 1961 of the secret anti-government OAS;
Part 5:The Suitcase or the Coffin,the bloody climax of the Algerian independence struggle,the negotiations that led to the ceasefire of March 1962,the eventual self-rule for Moslem Algerians and the mass exodus of the European settlers from Algeria.

This account has real authority and remarkable accuracy,with unique historical footage gathered from both sides, both in black and white and colour,some footage of people being shot,the grisly,macabre result of savage killings, mutilations,the brutality,pitiless terror, monstrous cruelty,flagrant torture,practised on both sides. But also lots of footage of daily life and the beauty of the landscape. The cameras seem to roam in both countries,and many ofthe interviewees speak frankly for the first time of their role in the struggle. There is both heroism and tragedy in this last and most significant of the old style colonial wars. Miltarily the French had almost won the war,but in doing so lost the battle for hearts and minds. Their grim determination to hold on increased with the discovery of oil and gas in the harsh desert.",1383004800,2,2370,5.49041095890411

8448770,5,B004YQXBPM,"This is truly an outstanding documentary.  Because it is nearly five hours long, it has time to delve deeply into the issues surrounding the Algerian war of independence.  The documentary is anything but superficial and the history of the war is treated with balance and depth.  The footage and sources presented are incredible and far beyond anything I had hoped to see.  There is footage of the 1930 centenary of the French conquest of Algeria; there are interviews with female FLN bomb carriers; there are interviews with FLN leaders like Yacef Saadi (featured in the Battle of Algiers movie) and FLN terrorists like the man who blew up pied noirs at the infamous casino bombing.  There are a wide range of interviews on the French side as well, including a French communist who details his torture at the hands of the French army, and also interviews with key French figures like Soustelle and Massu.  Then there is the remarkable footage that brings to life the whole terrible trauma of the war in Algiers--pied noirs rioting, tanks on the streets of Algiers, French paratroopers trying to contain FLN demonstrators, shootouts between French and FLN forces, and pied noirs burning their possessions in the streets of Algiers before packing up for France.  The descent into anarchy, violence, and ultimately the exodus of the pied noirs and the end of French rule is set forth with vivid imagery and cogent explanation.

If you have read Alistair Horne's ""A Savage War of Peace"" or watched ""The Battle of Algiers,"" this documentary is not to be missed.  But even if you have no familiarity with the Algerian war of independence, the documentary is accessible and would be of interest to any student of history.
