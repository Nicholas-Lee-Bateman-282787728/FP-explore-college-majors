It looked like it had some real potential, what little bit I could endure with the screen jumping around and the sound fading in and out between barely audible and loud. Not happy, but it is a VHS tape after all.",1429401600,,312,4.131147540983607
7916924,5,B000035Z52,"This version is in VHS, but a DVD is also now available. This is the biblical the story of the Creation from the Book of Genesis in the Old Testament of the bible. Interspersed between the story of Noah and the Flood, they have a neat cutaway of Noah telling the story of Creation in a different style of animation. I really enjoyed this and have watched it several times this past month after I purchased the DVD. The Testament series is notable in that they used smart writers to try to turn each story they chose into a 30 minute program, but also their choice of different animators and styles of animation for each of the episodes. THIS one uses a traditional 2D hand drawn animation. There are some changes made to keep the story flowing, but nothing insulting. The other animated versions of Noah that I have seen all take liberties with the story. To get the most accurate details, you always will need to return to the bible. I think the point of animating the story is to get the basic message to a wider audience and to artistically present the story.

The series, produced over 10 years ago by Christmas films in Wales and Russia for the BBC, is not made for kids, but for all ages. I believe HBO family channel ran these for awhile a few years ago. There are other DVD's in the series that are stand alone title's, also about 30 minutes each. The series includes ""Daniel"", ""David and Saul"",""Moses"", ""Jonah"", ""The Creation and Noah"", ""Elijah"" (my favorite), ""Ruth"", ""Joseph"", and Abraham. The last 3 are in claymation or stop motion animation, like the holiday TV specials).
But if you want a good deal, there is another set from the same company that has 4 of the 30 minute stories from this Testament series in a 2 DVD box set. ""Testament: The Bible in Animation Collection"" is the title to search for, and Amazon.com is where I bought it. The price is almost the same as buying one individual story. That set has Jonah, Abraham, Elijah, and the Creation/Noah story. I highly recommend for biblical viewing as well as the great animation.",1259625600,,2052,4.545945945945946
7916925,3,B000035Z52,"This video has a surreal quality to it, especially during the flashback to the Garden scenes.  The result is a splendid emotional appeal.  Be aware that it depicts nudity in cartoon form, but not too graphically.
Sadly, the film chooses to propagate some traditional, but unScriptural notions, such as the origin of Satan.  Though most people have heard that ""Lucifer"" was God's choicest angel, fallen due to his pride, the Bible never makes such a point; in fact, the only reference to ""Lucifer"" is in regard to the King of Babylon -- a HUMAN king, not an angel at all.  The Biblical account speaks figuratively of this braggy king falling from heaven (i.e. - he is to lose his power).  Other than that, reference to Ham as the ""youngest brother"" is speculative and unlikely (he is always listed in the middle); it stems from a traditional attempt to cast blame on Ham (in a post-flood account of sin) rather than his youngest son, Canaan (who is more likely Noah's youngest ""son"").  And the concept that people ate meat before the flood is also against the Biblical record, for it was after the flood that God allowed people to eat meat as well as vegetation.
Yet in favor of the film, Noah makes some very good theological points regarding the nature of God (just and loving), the need for obedience, freedom, and the battle between good and evil.  This video is worth having, if you are careful to search the Scriptures to prove what is good and true and not simply rely on an artist's rendition of it.",1041984000,5,1506,4.617977528089888
7916926,5,B000035Z52,"All the videos of this series are excellently crafted. Some of them have different animation techniques, but all of them are well within the parameters of responsible conformity to the witness of the Biblical documents. This one is particularly good theologically. It does not dumb down the creation story, nor does it side-step the tricky business of imagining a pre-fallen Adam and Eve and the nature of the original sin. I have never seen or heard an adequate rendition of the account of the Fall. Until I saw this video. Additionally, the remarkable graphics concept aids and abets the teaching of such a difficult subject. I strongly recommend this set to the educator who wants to take the next few steps beyond ""veggie tales"".",1033603200,3,733,4.919354838709677
