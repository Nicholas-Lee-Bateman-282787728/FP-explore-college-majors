3647748,5,B001ICUVP8,"I ordered these videos for my daughter, who is now about to turn 3.  She has had them for about 6 months and knows every bit of information on each of the DVDs.  She LOVES them.

The real win is that my 1-year-old loves them and also knows every ounce of information: from the shapes, the colors, numbers and upper/lowercase alphabet.  My son even recognizes a few sight words!  Now they watch the DVDs in SPANISH to learn even more.

These are TERRIFIC tools and an absolute MUST for any family with children under 4.  The earlier you can start the better.. my one-year-old has learned so much from these that he actually can do the classwork in my daughter's 1 day/week preschool class of 2 and 3-year-olds!

You will NOT be sorry, this is by far the best educational tool I have purchased for my children to date.",1239753600,2,816,4.429530201342282
3647749,5,B001ICUVP8,"I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR MY THREE YEAR OLD SON WHO S NOW BEGINING TO READ, AND THIS PRODUCT IS VERY HELPFUL. WE WATCH THESE DVDS' DAILY AND HE KNOWS THE WORDS AND RECOGNIZE THEM WHEN WE ARE OUT.
I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT, I THINK ITS A MUST HAVE.I WISH I HAD LEARNED ABOUT IT EARLIER, BUT I AM TELLING OTHER PARENTS ABOUT HOW GOOD THIA PRODUCT IS.",1238025600,,353,4.130434782608695
3647750,5,B001ICUVP8,"My son, who is 2.5 years old, loves these DVDs and all the other Preschool Prep series.  I couldn't get him to read books as he can't sit still, but he can watch these will full concentration, over and over again.  He also learns very quickly from the DVDs.  I also some DVDs from Leap Frog but he just wasn't interested in them. Highly recommend these.",1237507200,,353,4.318181818181818
3647751,5,B001ICUVP8,"My son is 2, a late talker and in the Autism Spectrum. After a few weeks of meet the numbers and meet the letters he can pick out almost all of his alphabet and he can point to all his number from 1 to 10. A great learning tool.",1235606400,10,228,3.673469387755102
3647752,5,B001ICUVP8,"That is the tagline for Preschool Prep and it is absolutely true. I would never have bought any of the DVDs but for a friend loaning us Meet the Letters, Meet the Shapes and Meet the Colors. My son went crazy for them and picked up information from them like a sponge, so for Christmas I bought him this set and they were his favorite gift by far. He loves the videos and has mastered recognizing all of the sight words and spelling most of them. I find that they have also been an excellent jumping off point for learning other words. (After learning ""at"" and ""that"", he has been able to learn ""bat"" ""hat"" ""cat"" ""fat"", etc.) It really is amazing. Between this and learning a few other words, my 2 year old can read a few books. He loves to point out his sight words when we are out and about and people never cease to be surprised that he is 2 and picking out words like ""play"" and ""they"" by himself. I don't know if all children will be as interested, but my little one thinks these DVDs are the best.",1234224000,36,1003,4.175257731958763
3647753,5,B001ICUVP8,After having these products for less than a month I am happy to report that my 26 months old twins are able to recognize all the sight words on homemade flashcards. The boys are able to point out the sight words while we are reading as well as hand me the correct flashcard when asked each and every time. Learning these words has also helped them to learn to read and recognize other words on flashcards. They get excited when they see the cards and love to view all three of the dvds. This is a great buy and a great jumping off tool to get your child ready for reading. The graphics are fun and entertaining. This is a great product and I'm 100% happy with this purchase. Now I wish I had purchased it months ago. If you are interested in getting your child a head start to reading I highly recommend this product.,1233532800,,817,4.243589743589744

3647755,1,B001ICUVP8,Way too boring. I was hoping they would be some engaging cartoons with the words but it's just the word on the screen and them saying the word ten million times. It was so boring we haven't even watched 2 of the discs. Had I known this before I would not have purchased these.,1501027200,3,276,4.12962962962963

He loves meet the sightwords and I know he learned words from it. He asks to watch ""sightwords"" everyday. We bought the books that go with it and at almost 3yo he can read 75% of the books independently. I wish they sold another set for more words. 4 stars because the images don't always match the words.",1480291200,,454,4.2298850574712645
3647762,5,B001ICUVP8,"These videos are great, but my four year old thinks 5+8 equals ""the tank"".  Just a funny side note, usually these videos are very effective.  The sight words videos have made our daughter into a star reader.",1478304000,,207,4.5675675675675675

3647765,5,B001ICUVP8,"My toddler watched these while waiting in the car for her older sister to get out of school. They were perfect and she is a great reader for her age. With these videos she had at least 25 sight words by the time she was 3. Not entertaining for an adult, but was fantastic for our second-  wish we had them for our first, it was hard to see her struggle.",1475193600,,353,3.971830985915493

3647769,5,B001ICUVP8,"My daughter LOVES these videos! She watches them over and over. They are very repetitive and feature an animation with the sight word as a character. I got the books that go with this series, too, and within about a week, my daughter was easily reading level one and we were starting on level two! I highly recommend this series to anyone with a 2 or 3 year old that shows an interest in reading!",1462752000,,396,4.293333333333333

3647771,5,B001ICUVP8,"wow, wow, wow! I have a 4 year old who now knows ALL the sight words on this video. I also purchased the flashcards that go along with this, and she can identify all the words. It is so fun because she will see the words around our house, out in the community, and in books and loves to point them out. I love that she has so many sight words before kindergarten! It has really encouraged her to learn more. I can't say enough good things about this!!!!! I will admit, it is BORING for adults but my kids have learned from it (my 2 year old can also pick out words in addition to my 4 year old)",1458000000,,594,3.9583333333333335
3647772,5,B001ICUVP8,What an amazing series this is! It is a great value for your money and I would suggest that any parent of a pre-schooler purchase these! Children love the nice and colorful graphics and the repetitive nature of the DVD's make it easy for children to quickly pick-up on what is being taught. Every pre-school age child that I have seen watch these DVD's loves them and will ask to watch them over and over again. This type of engagement is a beautiful thing as they learn about sight words. This pack is a bargain and can save so much time versus using worksheets or flashcards. After one viewing you will be amazed how quickly your child has already learned quite a few of the sight words for the video and with each review they continue to learn and memorize these words with ease.,1452988800,,782,4.4375
3647773,5,B001ICUVP8,"Awesome, as a mother of multiple children I can say that these movies are loved by many ages.  My oldest son struggled to learn the sight words in kindergarten, but now my 2 year old knows most of them.  I LOVE preschool prep!",1452470400,,226,4.232558139534884

3647776,5,B001ICUVP8,"This can be a great tool for learning to read when introduced to kids at the reading age who learn from electronic media. My kid was 4 yrs when we bought this for him. He learned all sight words from this set. At the end of the video there is a child''s voice reading sentences using the sight words from the video, that worked so great for us. We used the same small book that came along as first book to read by himself, that gave him confidence & he has never stopped reading after that. We ended up buying tons of books from scholastic flyers. Today in 1st grade he is considered as proficient as a 3rd grader and reading chapter books already. He attempts to spell big words by himself. However it didn't work for my sister's son who was never interested in sitting in one place to watch this ""boring"" video in his words. As much as my kid loved this, I know 2 other kids who did not like and did not learn from it. If you know that your child learns from watching ABCs in youtube or even Mickey/Dora then I highly recommend this.",1449705600,5,1035,4.206030150753769

3647781,2,B001ICUVP8,Those who said it was boring were correct. It in no way compares to the education and entertainment level of a leap frog video. Will continue looking for sight word video that the kids want to watch.,1443139200,,199,4.405405405405405

We played them in car and at home. Mine really liked the colors DVDs. The workbooks, books and flash cards were a hit from 2-4 years old into Kindergarten. Also wanted to note the board books were especially good between 1-3 years old and the packet of 12 reader books for 2 years old onwards.",1434240000,,441,4.261904761904762

3647791,4,B001ICUVP8,"I checked these out at my library before purchasing them on Zulily.  I have the three DVDs, a set of flashcards, and three sets of books.  A lot of reviews complain about not spelling or using letter sounds in these DVDs; however, that is not the point.  From my understanding, ""sight words"" are words that a child should just see and automatically know.  As a math teacher, I think it is similar to expecting students to know multiplication facts off the top of their head without too much thought.
As for these DVDs, each word has an animated character, it goes around on the screen with some background music, and a voice repeats the word several times.  Then it will change from the animated character word into normal print.  To watch all 16 words on a DVD, yes my daughter loses interest.  I only show her the ""mini lessons"" of four words.  She will usually watch two lessons.
It is very interesting how she will connect the music and even motions of the character with the word, and I think this is the point, getting their brains to make the connections and eventually recognize the word in print.
If you buy the flashcards, one side is the cartoon word and the other is print.  As we are learning our sight words, some she only recognizes the picture word, and that is okay.  She is making progress.
Finally, I have not checked out other resources for sight words really.  These are pricey, but I believe they can be effective depending on how you choose to implement them with your child.
I left this review because I thought this product deserves better than the several 1 star reviews I saw.",1428537600,2,1603,4.53125

It was very bland for me to watch and I worried that my boy would lose interest in it.  Not only has he not lost interest,  he caught on to the sight words quickly and enjoys pointing them out in books while we read together at night.  I like these so much I bought the blends DVD, and he's also enjoying learning how to blend sounds with that one.

3647815,2,B001ICUVP8,"The movies were so boring, even to me! The first word is shown about 6 times, the speaker repeats the word in different tones like 6 times. That part totally killed my daughter's attention. I understand the purpose, that sight words need constant repetition, but it was just so boring.

It gets interesting when the words come alive and are animated, but sometimes the animation of the word doesn't match. Like, for the word ""for"" (I think), it become a boat, and it sails around. A boat and the word ""for"" are not related UNLESS the speaker provided a sentence for context. ""The boat sails around the ocean for days before landing on shore"", but there's not sentence.",1402617600,,668,4.661016949152542

3647822,5,B001ICUVP8,"This series worked great for my oldest son (now 7) when he was 3, and I'm doing it now with my youngest who is almost 3. I played it to  them 1x per day usually when they were in the high chair and both were fully engaged (my youngest actually brings me the video to play for him)  I also have Leap pad and Your baby can read.  What I like about this series is it has just the right amount of animation to keep kids interested and focused on seeing and learning the sight words without OVERstimulating them. (Baby can read was too dry for me, no music or animation as part of the learning process, and Leap pad is  but there are so many options/apps for kids to choose  that It's difficult to keep them focused on just learning sight words.) Using this system in conjunction with nightly reading to my kids and sight word charts when they were 4 really prepared them for early reading. And watch it WITH them!  It's important.",1390953600,,926,4.2628571428571425

3647826,5,B001ICUVP8,These series of learning DVD for toddlers is one of the best I've seen.  My grandson loves them and learned his ABC's so easily.  I have given this series as gifts on several occasion and the parents have always loved it.  Thank you!,1386028800,,233,4.372093023255814

He clearly learned them from this video because he'll tell me stuff like, ""There! That's a submarine!"" I'm ordering the blends and digraphs videos today based on our experience with the sight words videos, and we might try the other early Preschool Prep videos with my younger son when the time comes.

Preschool Prep, if you're reading this, please produce more sight words (or ""high frequency words"") videos for this series. My son is always disappointed that there are only three!",1384128000,,593,4.757281553398058

3647831,5,B001ICUVP8,"When I first put on the DVD I thought it seemed so simple my kids would get bored watching it.  After all it's just the words being repeated over and over.  However, they love it and want to watch it all the time.  While watching it with them we talk about the characters and I make up sentences using the word in context with what is on screen.  The characters are really simple but they are super cute.  Both my 4 year old and 2 year old can pick out the sight words easily after only a few viewings and we clap and cheer when they get the words right.  It's fun for all of us!!",1380326400,,580,3.956896551724138

3647834,3,B001ICUVP8,"So yes, the videos are boring for me. But my daughter is 3 and she loves letters so I figured she would like this. It held her attention the first few times but now she doesn't want to watch it. She didn't see it enough to learn the sight words and does better with a more interactive teaching method. This is really, really passive and I think a game (like jump to the card with the right sight word) excites her much more. I do like the book they 'read' at the end of each video using the words just covered in the video.",1377648000,,523,4.038461538461538

3647840,4,B001ICUVP8,"I like these videos, but not as much as the Blends, Digraphs, or Letter Sounds.  My son has learned quite a bit from it so that should be all I need, and I know this is not made for me.  It's just that I saw the other videos first and loved how they were portrayed to be an actual object containing the letters (SH was taking a SHower).  With Sight words, the words are just cute pictures, like ON is a pig, no relation, but I guess it is cute enough and simple enough to teach the child.  My son does enjoy these videos so I still highly recommend these.",1373068800,,555,4.0181818181818185

3647842,5,B001ICUVP8,"I cannot recommend these videos enough!  I love the whole preschool prep series!  Why? These videos (while I think are incredibly boring) capture any kids attention.  My kids (8, 7, 5, 4, 3) have learned all of their sight words before they enter school because of these videos.  My 3 year old knows every sight word on these videos and can identify them in text!  He started watching them when he was 18 months.  I cannot take any credit, except for putting the video in (insert smiley face)!  My youngest (by the time he was 2) knew all of his ABC's (phonics included), numbers, shapes, colors, and sight words.

Now to defend myself because I know some people will judge that my child has consumed way too many hours in the TV.  I keep these DVDs in my car.  I played these DVDs everyday (M-Th) while I picked up my 5 and 4 year old from preschool.  I needed something to keep my youngest from falling asleep in the car because I wanted him to take a nap at home and not in the car and these did the trick.  The bonus was they were educational and he learned while watching them!  Ironically they were the only thing that would keep him awake.  If I put in anything else he would fall asleep.  Now at 3 the same still holds true.  Now when I put them in he likes to race his siblings to see who can say the word faster!",1371168000,,1322,4.207171314741036

3647847,3,B001ICUVP8,"Before I returned to work, I received this Sight Words DVD that I ordered and was really excited about it.  I tried the first DVD and allow him to watch it a couple of times but he would get bored, I assume and start playing with his toys. I then tried the second one and it seemed much more interesting; more sight words to look at and it was longer.  He was actually trying to repeat the words but he is 18 months so he has some time.  Then soon after I returned back to work so I haven't been keeping up with it.  I was only able to give this product three stars because I definitely like it but haven't used it that long to see some results with my son.",1364428800,,657,3.9545454545454546

3647849,5,B001ICUVP8,I'll admit that I was a little shocked at how much our son loves these videos. He even chooses them over Mickey Mouse Clubhouse or his other disney movies. The videos are very engaging with cute animation/music that really engages your child while teaching them valuable words! Highly recommend!,1363305600,,295,5.040816326530612

3647855,5,B001ICUVP8,"We purchased the entire set of the Preschool Prep Series when my daughter was 14 months old.  We started with shapes and colors and my daughter learned them in a matter of days, to the point where she could point to various shapes and colors outside of the video and name them (of course we worked with her outside of the videos as well, but these were the perfect starting point).  We decided to try the Letters and she too was able to pick those up watching a little bit daily, after about 2 weeks.  Then, a little later when she was about 17/18 months old, we tried Site Words and she had all video's words down in a couple of weeks.  Her doctor was astounded at her 18 month checkup.

Yes, my daughter is a smart cookie (I know I'm biased!) but I think any kid could learn from this series since it makes for such a fun learning experience.  We underestimate little minds' capabilities.  I think it helped to get her introduced to all of these concepts early, but I recommended this series to a friend with a 5 year old son who just wasn't ready for kindergarten because he had difficulty learning these concepts, and he began picking up on all of them in a matter of days as well.  The Preschool Prep Series offers amazing tools to both children and adults.  Even though my daughter is over 3 now and has known her shapes, colors, etc., for quite some time, she still asks to watch these videos because she enjoys them.  Just remember, with any learning product including this one, you need to interface with your child too and not just leave it up to them and the product, while also respecting that every child has a pace at which they're comfortable with taking in new information.  Don't rush it!",1358121600,,1705,4.398089171974522
3647856,5,B001ICUVP8,"I cannot sing this series enough praises. My two children, ages 3 and 1, watch one of these DVDs once a day. As evidence of their effectiveness, my three year old daughter can pick out any of the sight words in this series any time we are reading a book togehter, when we are out in public, and if she happens to look at a page that I am reading. My son, who can barely speak, has also memorized these sight words due to this DVD series, and in his limited speech capacity he is able to distinctly verbalize these words. I really don't care if some educators are against memorization in this way - that is what you have to do with sight words. They do not follow any rules that are understandable to children. This is hands down the best way that I have found to teach my children the sight words - and my friends and family are literally blown away by what they have seen my children read at such a young age.
