8200547,3,B000RGU5WU,"The production quality seems amatuerish, but it's not bad.  Seems the filmmakers used the auto-focus function on their HDcam and ended up focusing mostly on the background instead of the model.  The model also doesn't know how (or seem to like) to pose, which is distracting.  Also, editing could have been cut down to 30 minutes, plus there should be more continuity in the shots.  Pretty model, but she didn't get the proper exhibition she deserved.  Pretty much, for indie filmmakers, it's not a bad start, but if they can afford the equipment and the model, then some of that budget should have gone towards production. Won't likely purchase another from the series unless you guys step up that game.",1201046400,3,704,4.833333333333333
