8247640,5,B0012SCZHK,"With such great films as M*A*S*H, Nashville, and The Player under his belt, I would not have expected Altman to suddenly veer into producing live rock performance videos so late in his life, especially for a discordant noise band like HEALTH.But this video shows Altman is truly a master-- the shaky camera work, quick ""strobe"" edits, and extensive use of dutch angles really capture the spirit of this performance. Kudos also to the cameo from Carol Burnett-- seeing her in the mosh pit at her age was just amazing. The rest of the supporting cast all give strong, though considerably less memorable performances, but nonetheless I cannot give this any less than a 5 star review!",1383264000,,680,4.870689655172414

I prefer to view it by chapters, so that I can easily go to my favorites.  The chapters are generally about 5 minutes long, making it very easy to watch and reap the benefits.
I feel this video is good for anyone, but I think the most benefits will be seen in those that are suffering with anything from mood disorders, such as depression, to those with autoimmune ailments.  I believe even those dealing with terminal illnesses will find the video useful and uplifting.
I believe it is impossible to watch chapter 7- ""Feel Great"" and not feel great when it is over.
I find the ""Night time"" chapter so relaxing and soothing, and so conducive to a restful night's sleep.
I highly recommend this to anyone wishing to have healthy thoughts and a healthy life!",1207958400,7,841,4.6
