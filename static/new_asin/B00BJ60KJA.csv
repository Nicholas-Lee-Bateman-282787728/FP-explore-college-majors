5633797,3,B00BJ60KJA,"Fans of Jeeja Yanin will most likely be puzzled by this film. The action is minimal and when it happens it's shot poorly and not choreographed very well. It never delivers that ""oomph!"" action fans thrive on. The comedy is definitely not for all tastes either and much gets lost in the translation (which is horrible) as others have noted.

HOWEVER, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I would rather watch this movie, where the film-makers and actors all seem to be having fun and there is a clever, creative atmosphere at play here (emphasis on PLAY, I swear, the actor who seems to be half Western, is cracking up in a lot of scenes!), than any amount of paint by number Hollywood tripe that lands at the local cineplex. There are bizarre characters (the two mob bosses, the lovesick Duang), weird and strange scenes that make no sense (the birthday scene), but that just infused the vibe of the film with a trippy kind of zaniness that I found infectious and completely cheerful!

If you're looking for great action, look elsewhere, if you want a light diversion that will tickle you and you enjoy looking at Jeeja (who doesn't?) try it!

I would watch this again, it's not great but it has some heart, creativity and life. More than can be said for most movies from this country.",1372204800,,1273,4.599118942731278
5633798,4,B00BJ60KJA,"Unlike her other films this one has more comedy than action. The action scenes are great but they are not as frequent as the quirky comedy characters overacting for a laugh. THIS GIRL continues to do amazing action which is the only reason to watch a film like this. There are many other films that are more humourous  but few with a better looking female martial artist. If you enjoyed her other films you will enjoy this one, just don't expect too much action because this is more of a comedy than a action film. THIS GIRL has charisma which carries this film and displlays her talent as an actress not just  a martial artist.",1371772800,4,628,4.452173913043478
5633799,3,B00BJ60KJA,I'm a fan of Jeeja Yanin. She was incredible in Chocolate. She is my favorite martial artist. This movie didn't highlight her abilities at all. I wasn't impressed with the scenes involving the use of her bike as a weapon and there were very few fight scenes. There are some hilarious scenes but otherwise its just an okay movie; the plot wasn't very good overall. Not really worth a second watch.,1371686400,,396,4.591549295774648
5633800,2,B00BJ60KJA,"Let me start by saying that I love martial arts movies. I couldn't begin to tell you the number of times I've watched ENTER THE DRAGON but it is in the double digits. I've enjoyed the new comers to the genre when they began like Steven Segal, Chuck Norris and Jean Claude Van Damme. I've liked the more current round of stars like Tony Jaa and Gary Daniels. That being said there is something that folks should realize when looking for a new martial arts film.

The films made overseas in the Far East sometimes lose something in translation. Some don't like the historical martial arts films of the past. A few of the police films featuring some top fighting sequences lose something. But the ones that lose the most are those that are based as much in humor as in fighting. They lose tons in translation. What is funny in one country falls flat in another.

That being said, THIS GIRL IS BADASS loses almost everything in translation. The film offers martial arts that are fairly weak and should be the foundation of the film. Instead we have a girl using her bicycle as a weapon and not believably so. But let's get to the plot first...if I followed it correctly.

Jukkalan is a bicycle courier who speeds around town delivering items for various people. Currently she's been assigned to transport some packages for some underworld types who then want to take back the money they paid her after she delivers their package. Why they would risk so much for so little is beyond me. Instead of dying though she uses her aforementioned martial arts/bicycle skills to take down the gang sent to dispose of her.

Then she gets another job to transport another package for another mobster. The first one apparently wants to sit back a while before tangling with her again. Once more she's attacked after delivering the package and yet she continues to work the same job. Not only that but she's been lifting a portion of the profits from each delivery.

If this wasn't enough of a plot we have a few others as well. One involves her uncle, a man in love with the woman who lives next door and who does laundry. But her uncle has some sort of shady past we don't find out about till near the end of the film. Then there's the boy next door, a goofy looking guy who is in love with Jukkalan. But she's in love with the hunky guy who lives nearby and sits around playing guitar all the time.

The plot lines in this film are as lame as they can be and the mixing of one storyline to another fails miserably. The acting is one of two things, either really bad or simply so unlike that seen in other countries as to appear terrible. Perhaps these would be unnoticeable in the country it was filmed in but here it's the main thing we see. The worst sin of all though is the fighting sequences which seem forced at best and lame at worst.

There is nothing I can say that would make this film an enjoyable experience. It was truly a movie I wouldn't waste time on. I would only recommend it to those who feel the need to watch every single martial arts film ever made. Myself, I'll watch the good ones over again.",1371600000,,3101,4.410839160839161
5633801,4,B00BJ60KJA,The martial arts choreography in this movie is phenomenal. It reminds me of some of Jackie Chan's best work from the '70's. I'm looking forward to her next film.,1371427200,3,161,4.586206896551724
5633802,1,B00BJ60KJA,"Due to finances, time considerations, as well as the laws surrounding international releases, I am not always able to watch the movies I want when I want. As a result I sometimes find myself making an impulse buy to satisfy movie watching desires that have remained unfulfilled. Case in point was my purchase of This Girl is Badass. The movie stars Thai actress 'Jeeja' Yanin Vismitananda, from Chocolate and Raging Phoenix fame. Jeeja has become famous as she is a martial artist who has been compared to another Thai actor, Tony Jaa. I am a sucker for a good stunt based martial arts flick. I wanted to see both of these other movies of hers, but never had the opportunity. So, when I was standing at the store and saw the Thai action-comedy, This Girl is Badass, starring the famed female butt-kicker, I thought this was my chance to finally see her in action. My wife took one look at it and warned me it would be stupid. The impulse was too much, it overpowered her warning.

 The cast is hard to critique for the script is so bad I can't honestly believe that the most talented actor could save it. There is no explanation for what is going on or why. You never quite understand what people are doing. For example, everyone seems to have a plan and they talk about this plan, but never talk about it and you're never shown anything that helps you understand what the plan is. ""What are you going to do about the plan?"", would say one while another says, ""Don't worry, I have a plan."" Most of what is said is some kind of joke and most of those are horribly lame. The few times there is something funny it seems to come about from the natural talents of the comedic actors staring in this film. These moments seem like improvised acting that the director decided was better than the script.

 Jeeja plays a young woman named Jukakalan, who is a bike messenger that delivers drugs for different crime bosses. She has an adoptive uncle named Wang, played by Petchtai Wongkamlao (a.k.a. Mum Jokmok) who is known as being a funny man and is the director of the film. She also has a very stupid friend named Naew, played by Bawriboon Chanreuang, who is always wearing bike riding uniforms. Her boss, Samureng, played by Akom Preedakul, is always dressed in some outlandish outfit that makes him look like a pornographic circus clown. She has an admirer named Duan, played by Chalerm Yamchamang, who is always dressed in white with bad pastel sweaters and bow ties. So many of the actors play their parts with outrageous accents, making them sound cheesy and cartoonish. It seems the idea was that if the actors were dressed like idiots and spoke like idiots the jokes would go over better. Jeeja begans stealing from the bosses, though why is never made clear. They want their money and thus we have incredibly unimaginative plot.

 I am ok with a martial arts movie having a poor premise as long as unbelievable stunts follow each other back to back. I watch these movies for the same reason people go to the circus, to see crazy unrealistic things happen before your very eyes. Jeeja's fight scenes, however, are few and far between with so much weak and annoying dialogue to wade through before you get to one. The action itself seems slower than it should as well. It is as if they didn't film it right, slow setting maybe, or Jeeja just isn't as good as Tony Jaa. There are too many times the film slows down so you can watch a not very impressive stunt play out. Normally in such movies you don't get to see a punch or kick coming. That is good. You want to be taken by surprise like the poor bastard taking the punch. Unfortunately, every last punch in this movie was telegraphed.  You knew what was going to happen because the actors are standing there preparing for the foot to kick them. The choreographed moves look like unpracticed choreographed moves. The imagination behind the scenes as well is weak, only there to showcase something that they thought would be cool, but never bothering to develop a natural flow that would get the characters riding a bike rack being pulled by a van logically. Yes, this happens in the film, but you don't know why and it is not impressive.

 There is also a fun little public service message you're subjected to. Uncle Wang runs a store that sells movies, DVDs and VCDs. He has competition across the way from person who sells pirated DVDs. This guy does pretty well for himself, better than Wang, until he is arrested and sent to prison for selling pirated DVDs. Wang then gives the viewer an after school special speech about how the law is changing. It will bring harsh punishments to people who pirate movies and how pirating a DVD is theft, just like any other kind of theft. He holds his head in frustration over why anyone would want to steal someone else's idea. If only Hollywood had Uncle Wang as a spokesmen to talk to a nation of people as if they are little misguided children.

 While I still have a desire to see her other movies, for she got famous for something, I am certainly not spending any money on impulse buys. If you have any interest in watching how the Thai film industry is developing, and it is, you might want to watch this. Though, I don't see this movie doing a lot for the reputations of Thai film makers. However, I am willing to bet you care little about that, which means you have no reason to watch this film. Unless you think Jeeja is cute and just like watching her, which I am sure will sell some people. As the movie was wrapping up, it has a very long and painful ending like a villain who just won't die, my wife said, ""See! I told you it was stupid. Don't listen to me, waste money."" Yes, I should always heed my love's warnings.",1371168000,,5723,4.4879923150816525
5633803,3,B00BJ60KJA,"Jeeja Yanin, the spectacular kick boxer who made a huge impression in CHOCOLATE and RAGING PHOENIX, is given more of a humanistic characterization in this romantic/comedy action film directed by Petchtai Wongkamlao (aka Mum Jok Mok), who is also the director who brought Thai kick-boxing marvel Tony Jaa to stardom in ONG BAK and its sequels.  In THIS GIRL IS BADASS, Wongkamlao also stars as the guardian of Jukkalan (Yanin), a teenager who works for a bicycle delivery service that also serves as a front for drug trafficking, which inevitably leads to conflict between two pairs of mob bosses.  The supporting cast all does a good job, especially Wongkamlao who generates a lot of sympathy as a troubled guardian who tries his best to help the ungrateful Jukkalan.  Both are supported by a fistful of wildly eccentric supported actors playing over-the-top caricatures of mob bosses and gangsters - as if every Thai comic was given a role in this film and way more screen time than their character deserves.  The film becomes a bad cartoon punctuated by too infrequent action scenes, although some of those are pretty terrific (including one in the bicycle repair shop with various bicycle implements being used, Jackie Chan style, in the fight), there are also a lot of really unfunny humor and inane puppy love moments which are likely to try the patience of Western viewers used to far more sophisticated and provocative comedic romance.  But despite the film's innocently silly humor, it's an entertaining watch, and Yanin proves to be as capable a leading lady as she is a raging wild woman in the fight scenes.  Viewed from a Thai cultural perspective, the story's level of humor and caricature is perhaps a little more tolerable.  The 99-minute USA release from Magnolia reportedly (and thankfully) trimmed some extended subplots out, and fortunately retains the original Thai voice track with subtitles that are inconsistently translated but follow-able.",1369958400,2,1964,5.099688473520249
5633804,2,B00BJ60KJA,"I became a fan of Jeeja Yanin since seeing her debut film, Chocolate.  And while her next movie, Raging Phoenix, wasn't quite up to it story-wise and continuity-wise, it still contained excellent fight sequences.  Of all the
Thai films (including Tony Jaa's films) that I've seen up to now, story-wise, Chocolate is still the best, IMO.

When I bought This Girl is Badass (in a store), I really wasn't expecting an improvement over her first two starring roles, but I at least expected a very good end fight scene.  In these and most good martial arts films, the fights get progressively better/more intense/sophisticated throughout the film, leading to a memorable end fight.  So I was willing to excuse the mostly lame comedy that dominates this movie, the most annoying involving an effeminate crime boss with a falsetto voice.  (Note:  I prefer to watch Asian movies in original language w/English subs, whenever possible).  Unfortunately, when the end fight came, I kept waiting for something memorable to happen, and ended up disappointed.  The action sequences in this movie can't even approach the level  in Jeeja's first two movies.  The fights aren't bad, but they just don't stand out like they could have.

**Slight spoiler alert**.
I watched it last night, and there's very little I actually remember about the end fight scene, except for one villain who hums his own soundtrack, and a man and woman fighting each other who die simultaneously, and inadvertently kiss as they fall to the ground.  The action sequences lack the sharpness and excitement of other films, although there is some interesting bicycle fighting early on in the film.  Not to mention the lack of any formidable opposition for Jeeja to face...I thought the group of female assassins would provide that, but that didn't happen.
**spoiler alert off**

I give it two stars for some of the bike stunts, but I'm being generous.",1369872000,,1907,4.9905063291139244
5633805,5,B00BJ60KJA,The Blu-Ray claims to be English audio so the Thai audio with English subtitles was a pleasant surprise.  I almost didn't watch it here because I hate dubs.  Jeeja is awesome as usual.,1369526400,3,184,4.545454545454546
5633806,4,B00BJ60KJA,"The title, ""This Girl is Badass"" is the English language release of Jeeja Yanin's third movie, called ""Jakkalen"", ""The Bicycle Messenger"" The film, written and Directed by Thai TV comedian, Mum Jok Mok, (the co-star of Tony Jaa's ""Ong Bak"" and ""Tom Yum Goong"") is a kind of patched together version of Mum's TV shows, featuring his cast of Comics with TV type gags. For many, who don't speak Thai, the jokes make no sense, even with the subtitles, (whose translations are BAD) and won't like the humor. Mainly, this is a story about a young orphan, Jakkalen, a super-mega Tomboy, (still cute) raised by her Uncle Wang, (a former mobster himself, now selling DVD's in his video store stall in the market) and she is a Bike Messenger, who happens to be delivering ""Stuff"", (red powder in plastic bags, presumed to be drugs). Jakkalen, is playing a dangerous game, trying to rip off the mob, while playing rival gangs against each other. Because she is Jeeja Yanin, of course the girl can fight like crazy, and does. Also, a sub theme is a really ugly guy has fallen for her, and is constantly, painfully, stupidly, scheming to win her over. Jakkalen, in the meantime, having her first crush, falls for a musician who is not all he seems to be, which eventually she finds out the hard way. The film has gags featuring absurd costumes and get ups worn by some cast members, Midget Muay Thai, and keystone cops gangsters who are either not straight, or can't shoot straight either. Really, the plot doesn't have much substance to it, and it is very difficult to divulge it with spoilers, since it is too difficult to follow anyway. I watched this film in the Thai release version, and its Western release version as well, for one thing only, and that is to watch Jeeja kick ass. One thing that is interesting, is that the English version includes about 20 minutes of Jeeja fight scenes that had been cut from the Thai version, with the distributors obviously sensing that the market in the US and England was for fans of her Martial arts prowess, and not for the strained humor of Mum and Co. So, for that reason alone, the newly released English subtitled version, is far superior, even though whole sections of the so-called plot are excised in order to get in more of Jeeja's action scenes, which is fine with me, but will make the plot even more confusing for those who haven't seen the original. The fight scenes are well done, as always, by action maestro Panna Rittikrai, the Thai stunt trainer who discovered and trained Tony Jaa and Dan Chupong. I won't spoil it, but what Jeeja does in her first two fight scenes will remind people of Jackie Chan, in the way she uses her environment, and every object in it as a weapon and/or a defense. It is very creatively done, and accompanied by some fun music that rocks and gets the pulse going faster.  This film is enjoyable, entertaining, and a good opportunity to enjoy both the physical and comedic acting talents of a rising star, who I think is the new action Queen of Asia. The film doesn't match her debut, Chocolate, and is just different than her other movie, ""Raging Phoenix"", and not quite as well made as the Thai/Korean martial arts film ""The Kick"", in which Jeeja has a secondary role. But, it is worth watching, and will whet the appetite of all of Jeeja's fans for the upcoming, soon to be released sequel to Tony Jaa's spectacular film, Tom Yum Goong 2, starring both he and Jeeja, Marrese Crump, RZA, and Tazu, as well as Mum Jok Mok reprising his role in the original.

5633825,5,B00BJ60KJA,"I am not a film critic. I am a huge fan of Jeeja Yanin.

As other reviewers have mentioned, the plot of this film leaves a lot to be desired. I don't watch these types of films for the plot so if you're going in with similar expectations to my own (which is that the film is silly, action-packed, and super-cliche) you're likely to love it as much as I do. There certainly was more humor than action and what action there was was even more silly and nonsensical than usual for a Jeeja Yanin performance. The slap-stick humor reminded me of Stephen Chow's films. It was completely over the top but I laughed so hard, I cried. Unlike some other reviewers, I don't think the subtitles are bad or that the jokes are difficult to understand for an English-speaking audience. On the contrary, I found the jokes very entertaining and even picked up some Thai slang which you can be sure I'll put to good use.

With the multitude of negative reviews for this film, I was hesitant about buying it but I don't regret it. This is not Chocolate or Raging Phoenix so I'd advise viewers not to harbor false expectations from associations with those films.",1391644800,3,1141,4.480769230769231

So, with this Thai film, not only are the characters really annoying, but the comedy is terrible too. And as an added disappointment, some of the action scenes are so exaggerated, that they too, come off as annoying.

And what's more, the pretty girls in this film just isn't worthy enough to want to watch this film again, so this DVD will be either given away or thrown away.

5633845,3,B00BJ60KJA,"In her latest movie ""This Girl is Badass"" Jeeja Yanin plays a bike messenger Jukkalan, who is attacked by a group of local thugs. Jukkalan happens to be a martial arts fighter, and using her bicycle and other props, she fights back those thugs in a style that slightly reminds us of Jackie Chan.

In fact, ""This Girl is Badass"" is not a bona fide action movie. This is more like an action comedy with too little martial arts and too much comedy. The film's storyline is almost non-existent. You meet the heroine's kind ""Uncle"" Wang (Petchtai Wongkamlao, who also directs) and her love-smitten childhood friend Duan (Chalerm Yamchamang). You get several nice action set-pieces in ""This Girl is Badass,"" but, entertaining as they are, they need more energy and creative ideas.

The comedy with cartoonish jokes (with a few rom-com elements) is a change of pace for the star Jeeja Yanin. The ""Chocolate"" star is surprisingly effective as an ordinary girl who has a crush on a handsome singer in her neighborhood. It is unfortunate that the thread is discarded rather unceremoniously.

It seems there is more than one version of the movie. If so, that will explain some subplots that do not make sense at all (like Uncle Wang's past, for instance).

Whichever version you watch, ""This Girl is Badass"" is not an action-packed movie that you might be led to believe from the name of the star.
