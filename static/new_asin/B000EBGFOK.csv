8108136,3,B000EBGFOK,"Movie was ok and was shot in and around Owosso, Michigan where I live so I bought it.
Portrayal could have been much better. The story was set in the fictional town of ""Ottawa"" which is actually Owosso, Michigan. It is based upon actual fact. A killer found 35 years after the murder by DNA on a cigarette. Awesome real life story, but is not portrayed very good in the movie. A 20 year old married woman was abducted, raped, and killed by an unknown killer at the time. I remember when it happened as I was just married 2 years myself.

8108137,5,B000EBGFOK,The DVD arrived in good time and was exactly what I thought it would be.  I haven't watched it yet but plan to soon.,1312243200,,116,3.8333333333333335
8108138,3,B000EBGFOK,"If you like whodunits, this one is for you.  Though it ran a little long, it is quite entertaining even with a sub-par script and acting.  The best part of the film is how law enforcement uses its CSI tactics to identify suspects.  3 stars.  Not as bad as some of the reviewers make it out to be.",1291852800,,296,4.051724137931035
8108139,1,B000EBGFOK,"Over wrought acting and subpar writing make this film for the most part unwatchable.  At a little over 2 hours running time, it is a feat just to finish.

I saw this story on a Cold Case from A&E, so I thought I would like watching this.  It is interesting to note that this film was shot on location in Michigan, and even features real life sites, like the actual crime scene.  But interesting trivia aside, this film sounded terrible with its initial dialogue and poor acting.  It is a doggedly slow paced film, so the 2 hours feel like 4.  What Cold Case managed to do in 1 hour with suspense, drama, and humanity (and commericals) this film could not accomplish if you gave it 3 more hours.

If you are interested in the story then watch a true crime show, but leave this film alone.  It is slow, poorly acted and written, and there is no sense of suspense after the first 15 minutes.  Just awful sweet pea.",1274227200,,911,4.311764705882353
8108140,1,B000EBGFOK,"This is the very worst acting I have ever seen in my life.  It is really just horrible.  I feel bad for the victims' families.  The families suffered the injustice of having their loved ones murdered and having their stories portrayed so sickenly in this disgusting excuse for a film.  On a lighter note, yes that is Mr. Belding from Saved By The Bell, playing the victim's dad.  Please don't waste your time or money on this piece of crap.",1264809600,,440,4.45
8108141,4,B000EBGFOK,"This movie is a typical independent film, but it tells an important story, especially for the people in this Mid-Michigan area. It is well researched and for the most part well done.",1231718400,3,182,4.71875
8108142,4,B000EBGFOK,"This relatively low-budget indie production is based on a true case that haunted Michigan investigators for 30 years. Although the killer took several lives, beginning in 1968, it is the 1973 murder of a young mother that forms the core of this movie. An accompanying documentary feature gives a rundown of the actual case, culminating in a 2002 conviction, made possible by DNA techniques developed in the intervening years. Don't watch this until you have seen the movie - it'll take some of the edge off the mystery.

For dramatic effect, the writers have taken some liberties with the lives of some of the investigators, and names have been changed. Nevertheless, they clearly went through the true case files and selected from the long list of eccentric suspects, leading to some interesting characters as the investigation unfolds. The victim had been running errands all day prior to her disappearance, so a number of town citizens were prime targets for scrutiny, all of whom admitted some interaction with her, but claimed she was alive and well when they parted.

The murders took place in central Michigan, and the movie is set near its original spot. Everything here has a true-life, small town feeling, down to the grey skies and barren winter landscapes. Still, evidence is convincingly presented to the viewer, and the only thing that separates this from an episode of CSI is the glamour, location, and high-end production. In the end, they get their man, and yes, he is painfully ordinary.

Recommended for CSI fans and those who have enjoyed real-life crime exposes, such as Michael Baden's Autopsy on HBO, or A&E's Cold Case Files.",1198713600,4,1649,4.989090909090909
8108143,5,B000EBGFOK,"This is a great movie shot with some new ""no name"" actors who are actually very good. Joel Albright was amazing. It was great to see some big time names lend a hand to this small town film. Dan Haggerty from Grizzly Adams fame does a nice job.

The acting is very good and believable! I highly recommend this film.
