1566838,4,B00005JOUX,"If you like all those campy horror films that came out in the 80's, you will have a blast with Slither. This movie does a good job combining gross out effects and a wicked sense of humor. I am glad they used very little CGI, because practical effects are much more disgusting (and believable) in films like this. I will be adding this one to my DVD collection, and I have a nice spot for it beside Re-Animator. Who would have thought this would be the highest rated movie of the year so far on rottentomatoes.com?",1143763200,12,513,4.354166666666667
1566839,4,B00005JOUX,"Good Lord, I am tired of reading John Q. Public's drivel about every movie. Somehow, this person manages to see every movie on every opening day, sometimes sees them before they open. In addition, he also sees every DVD, every graphic novel, and every movie soundtrack CD. And he is snarkily dismissive about everything!

One of the few positive reviews I have read from him involved a DVD season of Beverly Hills 90210. So, we know where he's coming from.

This person appears to derive his sole enjoyment from being the first person to post a review on anything and to bitch about the quality of Everything! Rarely does he comment on actual items about the movie, which leads me to believe he doesn't even bother seeing many of them.

1566840,5,B00005JOUX,"You two are so full of $hit. This movie isn't copying Night of the Creeps, it's just taking a premise of something like it. That's like saying Dawn of the Dead is a ripoff a Night of the Living Dead.",1143763200,4,199,4.0
1566841,4,B00005JOUX,"Just 2 let everyone know, this movie basically copied Night of the Creeps 1986 which was released by Columbia TriStar which has yet to be released on DVD. Night of the Creeps was a dark comedy, horror, monster sci-fi, slugs invading the mouths of human to take over their brains and turn them into zombies just like Slither. Night of the Creeps is far superior. The slugs in this movie look so fake with CGI crap.",1143590400,,413,4.447368421052632

1567004,4,B00005JOUX,"Slither is a fun and delightfully gory horror/comedy from Guardians of the Galaxy writer/director James Gunn, that is sadly overlooked and underrateduntil now! Once again the awesome folks at Scream Factory have given a flick the respect and treatment it deserves with this new special edition. This title in particular has always been a personal favorite and this disc was obviously anxiously awaited. Lets find out if it delivered

On a technical level the film image is clear and sharp with some nice contrast, while maintaining the original color palette that Gunn filmed it in. The flesh tones, both human and in-human being the most vibrant colors aside from the gore. The movie is presented in the original 1.85.1 aspect ratio, preserving the films original dimensions. The sound is in 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio with alternate 2.0 DTS-HD for those without home theater sound systems. The original extras from the DVD are presented in the video format ratio of 1:33:1 that they were filmed in. Remember it was 2006 and the TVs those extras were made for still came in the square format.

Now on to the extensive extras which make this disc so worth having!

Scream Factory has added some new features in addition to including all the fun extras from the initial DVD release. We get new commentary from James Gunn with Nathan Fillion and Michael Rooker, aside from the original commentary with Gunn and actor Nathan Fillion. We also get new interviews with both writer/director Gunn and actor Gregg Henry and it is interesting to hear Gunn reminisce about the flick now that hes had such success with the Guardians of the Galaxy films. From there we get deleted and extended scenes with optional James Gunn commentary. We get a step by step of some of the films visual FX. We get a fun tour of the set with actor Nathon Fillion, followed by an amusing profile of his character Bill Pardy. Theres a documentary from the original release called The Sick Minds And Slimy Days Of Slither. One of the FX crew humorously gives us a fake blood recipe in Brewing The Blood. There is another FX documentary about how the slimy critters were brought to life and a short video diary with Troma creator Lloyd Kaufman on set for a cameo, which sadly was cut from the final print. The extras wrap up with a fun gag reel and the original theatrical trailer. A nice batch of extras for a movie only now starting to get the notice it deserves.

This is a personal favorite and a flick that is finally finding an audience after being overlooked upon initial release. Its a fun horror/sci-fi flick that pays homage to many of its influences, yet not without having its own identity. If you're a fan of the film, its a must have disc. If you are just discovering James Gunn through his Guardians movies, than this is definitely an item you may want to check out. Another great disc from Scream Factory.",1515801600,3,2885,4.695652173913044
1567005,4,B00005JOUX,"This is a cult classic horror/scifi/comedy. An interesting combination of themes reminiscent of movies like Grabbers and Feast. At first you have no idea what is going on but once things are explained it follows a fairly straight forward plot line. Nathan Fillion fans rejoice as he puts in his usual A+ performance. The rest of the cast also performs well. This is a fun, yet slightly disturbing film that leaves you feeling refreshed with the genre after watching.",1513987200,,466,4.9113924050632916
1567006,5,B00005JOUX,"Do you like John Carpenter? Do you miss the days when creative body horror was all the rage, and stylish film-making only elevated the disgust and weirdness we got to see? Well, James Gunn, master of subversive genre-bending (see Super, his Dawn of the Dead remake and the short-lived comedy series called PG Porn) brings us a trippy, in-your-face throwback to Cronenberg and Carpenter that deftly balances humor and gross-out horror in both hands.

The plot is basically a rip-off (sorry, ""homage"") to Invasion of the Body Snatchers: an alien parasite lands in small-town America, infects innocent townspeople, and then mutates them into disgusting Clive Barker-monsters brought to hideous life by a talented and creative design team and an expert, innovative special effects department. As Body Snatchers is one of the greatest horror movies ever made, cribbing from it isn't a bad thing. We follow Nathan Fillion, star of my favorite TV series, as he tries to keep the peace as Sheriff of the most inbred, redneck town in all cinema. As I was a DnD-playing, five-foot acne-riddled teenager in a small town like this back in the primeval days of my youth, this added an extra punch to the movie's sharp-edged satirical appeal: watching Cronenbergs tearing ass through the rural wasteland of bumf*ck nowhere came straight out of my disturbed teenage power fantasies, and I loved every second of it! (I wish I could tell you Gunn exaggerated this for the movie, but if he did it was only slightly).

The movie is a blast from beginning to end, poking fun at southern stereotypes while also going balls-to-the-wall with practical effects and an undertone of Gunn's pitch-black humor that brings the whole thing from standard body-horror territory to biting, sharp-edged wit that we never knew we wanted in a horror movie like this one. Love The Thing, The Fly and mean-spirited Rick and Morty-style comedy? Then this is the film for you! If not, why the hell did you read this far and where are your parents?",1513209600,,2007,4.93491124260355

The new commentary won't add a lot to understanding how the film was made (the original commentary is better), but it serves to show how much fun director James Gunn and Michael Rooker must have when they work together they're pretty entertaining.

The new interviews are fun and informative, and the original batch of extras were all informative and a lot of fun.

1567068,5,B00005JOUX,"My love for this movie started the day I saw it in theaters. It was weird, but after the opening scene, establishing the Mayor honking and yelling vulgarities, going to a talk about ""Survival of the Fittest"" where Elizabeth Banks asks in a kind of dopey southern accent if humans or cockroaches are the more successful species, I knew that this was my kind of product. I had an idea of what was ahead of me, but at that point (and noting that the town of Wheelsy where our story takes place has a high school with the mascot 'The Cooters') I felt like I was right where I belonged. The movie does hit half a dozen horror scenarios (i.e. giant alien slugs, dual tentacle injectors, acid-spitting zombies, etc.), but it never felt like it was just going from one reference to another. ""Slither"" has an organic plot that stops at those points when writer/director James Gunn fits them in, and the timing between the scares and the laughs hits ""Evil Dead""-related highs. This is one of my favorite horror-comedies right up there with ""Evil Dead 2."" The references are aplenty, so horror movie, specifically sci-fi horror movie, knowledge helps one enjoy this classic work of camp but such knowledge isn't necessary. Plus anyone who has seen ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" can spot a 'bathtub scene'reference from a mile a way- just look at the cover. I just can't sufficiently put into words how happy this movie makes me, so I won't try any more.",1502582400,2,1440,4.62890625

1567118,5,B00005JOUX,"I love ""Slither"". It's icky, disgusting and gross and James Gunn (who would later write and direct the two ""Guardians of The Galaxy"" films) channels both his inner Cronenberg and Carpenter with this creature feature (also inspired by the original ""The Blob"" as well).

SPOILERS:

A meteorite crashes near a small town and, when Grant (the marvelous Michael Rooker) investigates, he discovers an alien creature that bonds with him for its own nefarious purposes including going after the residents of the town including Grant's own wife (Elizabeth Banks) and the man she is secretly in love with Sheriff Bill Pardy (Nathan Fillion from ""Firefly"" and ""Castle""). The only person standing between the thing that has come to Earth and his town is Purdy.

END OF SPOILERS:

Aside from ththe fact that this is an older unrestored transfe  done for Shout by Universal, the film does look pretty good even if it is the same source as the older Blu-ray from overseas from 7 or so years ago. Texture is nice as is detail, blacks are solid and color's robust. It's a solid looking transfer but if you were expect No a new one, you will be disappointed.

The lossless Audio 5.1 is VERY active and improvement over the HD-DVD available in the U.S.  Subtitles are available in English but no other language same with audio. The static menu isn't exactly... static with a very clever bit on of activity.

The special features shine with two audio commentaries by James Gunn one with Nathan Fillion and the other with Fillion and Michael Rooker. Each one is filled trivia and fun particularly the banter on each.

We also get a new interview Gunn (with plenty of clips between the various parts of the interview). We also get a gag reel, a vintage on set featurette. We also get a new interview with Greg Henry, two featurettes on the special effects and making of the film, deleted/extended scenes, a Who is Bill Purdue, Brewing The Blood, Lloyd Kaifman's video diary and a theatrical trailer.

Shout Factory has loaded this disc with terrific special features and, while this is an older transfer, it looks quite good. Audio is lossless. If you like icky, slimy films with creatures that are really gross looking, this is the movie for you so slither on down to your store or order it from Amazon.",1501545600,,2282,4.73989898989899
1567119,5,B00005JOUX,"This review is for the Shout! Factory blu ray release on 1 Aug 2017. As usual, Shout/Scream Factory did another great job on a blu ray with plenty of extras. The new 30 minute interview with director James Gunn is great, as well as the interview with actor Greg Henry (8 mins). There is a new audio commentary by director James Gunn & cast members too. It looks like they ported all the extras over from previous releases as well. The movie itself looks great on blu ray. I thought they did a great job on the practical and optical special effects for this film. Plus, it has a great cast. Michael Rooker, Nathan Fillion, Elizabeth Banks, and Greg Henry. All in all a great throwback to horror/comedies of the past with modern day special effects! A must own for James Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy) fans!",1501545600,,805,4.482993197278912

1567284,5,B00005JOUX,"This is one of my favorite go-to movies for nights when I need a guilty pleasure. It is not, however, recommended for bath night for reasons that the poster makes abundantly clear.

Slither should have been a huge hit. I'm sure that 'cult classic' has been bandied about, and I'm rebandying it. You've got your drop-dead-gorgeous Elizabeth Banks in a little white slip. You've got your drop-dead-ruggedly-handsome Nathan Fillion, rendered nearly speechless (always good for a laugh) and, when actually able to talk, choking more zingers out than a viewer should reasonably expect from a small-town cop. You've got your cheerfully menacing Michael Rooker slowly turning into a giant sex-crazed slug with reasonably healthy teeth. You've got your foraging pork-tenderloin-sized sluglets foraging for new prey to turn into zombies. And there is... THERE IS A ZOMBIE... (spoiler) no. I can't say it. But not all the zombified organisms in Slither are people. Things just keep getting worse, more disgusting, and probably smellier. The fun escalates, as well, as an entire small town is brought to the edge of world annihilation.

With snappy direction by James Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy, Super) the movie features a witty script even among the unwitting and downright witless; a healthy dose of parody (you'll recognize nods to The Blob, Arachnophobia, and several other classic schlockfests); and also wedged into the fun, something amazing happens: Elizabeth Banks takes a really deep turn for a moment, as her character tries to show her alien-monster-husband some sympathy.

Slither isn't for everybody, but if you're looking at a review in contemplation of buying the DVD, it's probably just great for you. Also I'd probably love you because you're smart enough to have read this far. So you're a good person.

Note, I hear that among the DVD extras is a live commentary by Rooker & Fillion. They're both good at improvisational high-jinks so I expect that will be worth the cash, but I haven't heard it yet.",1464307200,,2013,5.109422492401216

1567461,4,B00005JOUX,"Rather than present an original premise, ""Slither"" combines elements from a number of other horror movies, from ""The Blob"" to ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" to half a dozen zombie movies. As for its status as a horror comedy,  The special effects are decent, the action is entertaining, and, considering how difficult it is to portray terror and agony, the acting was actually pretty good.  Nathan Fillion and Elizabeth Banks star in a B-movie that knows what it is and doesn't pretend to be more. The special effects aren't great, but the dialog,
and laugh out loud one-liners,  and characters are so much fun you won't care.

The basic plot is that an alien species makes its way to earth on a meteor and begins its conquest of the planet in a small midwestern town. There is just enough gross factor in the alien larvae (the wigglers on the poster) and the way the infected people look and act that you will be reminded of the heyday of Freddy Krueger, Critters, and Toxic Avenger. The uninfected fall quickly, leaving only a brave few to save us all from destruction. Formulaic, but fun.  The dialog between characters is fun banter and doesn't come across as lines, but more what you would expect of actual conversation you would expect between friends and coworkers you've known in your life.  If you're in the mood for a well-made horror comedy this is a good choice.

If you enjoy these kinds of movies, I suggest you checkout ""Svengooli"" (previously called Son of Svengooki) Svengoolie is a hosted horror movie show.  The show's title is taken from the name of the character host. The show is a long-running local program in the Chicago area and in recent years expanded nationally, airing Saturday nights on Me-TV.

The last hour of the film has the alien slugs, the (sort of) Zombies, and the somewhat funny fight scenes starring Nathan Fillion and Elizabeth Banks.  In the first half, the dialogue sounds corny but once the slugs start showing up the corniness becomes actually hilarious.

1567563,2,B00005JOUX,"A meteor comes crashing down on the small southern town of Wheelsy. The meteor is unnoticed by the locals, their too busy celebrating the imminent the opening of deer season. A few days before, local rich guy Grant Grant (Michael Rooker) wanders off into the woods with Brenda, the little sister of an ex-girlfriend, where they run across the meteorite. The alien creature inside infects Grant who slowly turns into a horrible monster over several days. The alien/Grant monster has a loving wife who is a local school teacher. He needs to spawn a mass of fast moving slugs to take over the townspeople and turn them into zombie-like minions so he can take over the world. Rather than infect his lovely wife, he goes after Brenda while everyone is celebrating the countdown to midnight. It's up to the local sheriff (played by Nathan Fillion) and whoever is left to stop the monster before the whole world falls under his control.

The movie is a blend of horror and comedy, a formula I usually find appealing. The humor here is so-so. Too many of the jokes rely on a character swearing as the punch line. I don't mind two or three such jokes but after several it just seems like the writer doesn't know how to write a punchline and relies on the actors to deliver the line well enough to get a laugh. Fillion is good at varying his delivery for comic effect but other cast members weren't. Plenty of other jokes work well but not enough to make this more than a mediocre comedy.

The horror aspect is full-on gory with lots of dead, eviscerated animals and at one point, a guy is split open and all his insides fall out. The alien/Grant monster becomes more repulsive throughout the movie with his final incarnation being a lumpy, room-filling monster. The high-speed slugs that he spawns are quite effective at being creepy and scary. They move fast and there's hundreds of them, giving them the sort of menace that was completely lacking in a movie like Don't Be Afraid of the Dark, where the small monsters just weren't scary. The slugs climb into people's mouths to take them over, quite unpleasant in a proper horror film way.

I have mixed feeling about the film. The monster, with his back story and his blending into the Grant character, is interesting and original, even if his plan is typical. Nathan Fillion is a charming actor but the script doesn't give him enough to shine. The gore level is pretty high but there's no off-setting level of humor (like in Evil Dead II) or thematic weight (like in Day of the Dead) to make it worth enduring. Gore for its own sake is not good. And, I am afraid, neither is this film.",1411948800,2,2629,4.5774946921443735
1567564,5,B00005JOUX,"Are you kidding me?  This was a charming movie with a wonderful ensemble cast of actors and writing, and the creatures were well done with plenty of wry, black humor.

FROM WIKIPEDIA:
""Slither was released on regular DVD and on HD DVD/DVD hybrid disc on October 24, 2006.[14] The HD version is presented in 1.85:1 widescreen encoded at 1080p and Dolby Digital-Plus 5.1 surround. In addition to the film, the DVD contains two making-of documentaries, one being solely dedicated to the visual effects. The DVD also contains deleted and extended scenes, a blooper reel, visual effects progressions, a set tour with Fillion, and an audio commentary by Gunn and Fillion. Also included are featurettes outlining how to make edible blood, and Lloyd Kaufman's documentary discussing his day on set, and the shooting of his one line (which was eventually cut from the film). Finally, there is an added bonus entitled ""Who Is Bill Pardy?"" which is a joke feature made by Gunn with the sole purpose of roasting Fillion, and was shown at the film's wrap party.[15]""",1411171200,7,1187,4.856435643564357

That entity is the whole performance of Nathan Fillion.

I wouldn't call it a tour DE force, like Ben Kingsly in Gandhi or anything; but it is good enough to keep one genuinely entertained.

Elizabeth Banks does a nice job playing a small town, gold-digging wife with daddy issues.

Nathan Fillion plays the sheriff who's been in love with Starla for years, but he just couldn't get it right.  Starla winds up with Grant Grant.  Grant is the first infected.

In general, production quality appears to be akin to cable television level.  However, due to the level of profanity, one would expect movie channel level.  That being said, for the most part, the profanity is not excessive and the special effects are not cheesy.  Parts of the movie do get a little cutesy; however, other parts give good laughs.

One major flaw involves when the survivor kid, Gina, is bitten on the tongue/gums/mouth area afterward she is able to speak without any affectation.  Due to the delicate nature of the tissues of the mouth, there would be major swelling.  Furthermore, how is a teenager able to pull out the super strong leech-like creature while adults are not?  Yet this hole is the understandable tool used to explain the origins and functions of the alien.

Otherwise, the movie was fairly enjoyable with a consistent plot.  The cliffhanger at the end was a bit cheap, however, there was another potential cliffhanger that appeared to be missed:

***SPOLER***It was mentioned the alien could spread through pregnancy.  At one point after Grant's contagion, Grant and Starla had sex; therefore, the chance of pregnancy was there.

What do you get when you mix ""Night of the Living Dead"" with ""The Body Snatchers,"" with ""The Thing,"" then add hilarious black comedy? You get ""Slither,"" the surprise sci-fi/horror/comedy of 2006!

The makers of this film had an obvious love for 50's sci-fi & 60's, 70's, zombie movies. They rolled it all up into one highly entertaining film, with winks & nods all over the place to their beloved genres.

The direction is top notch! It's hard to make a film like this successful, but there is nary a flaw in it. The casting is superb, especially Greg Henry (""Payback"" & ""Body Double"") as the hilarious foul mouthed, hard drinking, deer hunting, mayor of a redneck town, filled with all assorted characters slithering around leaving their slimy imprints on your laughing belly muscles. The make up of the main alien/monster was fantastic, & very reminiscent of the main monster in ""From Beyond"" mixed with ""The Thing."" All other make up & CGI was done with great love & affection. Especially well done & funny as hell was the killer Deer in the police station, getting a little payback for all it's Bambi brothers that fell to the hunter's bullet.

He's Bill Pardy though we all know him as Nathan Fillion. He's the sheriff of a charming little red-neck paradise in South Carolina where a small meteor crashes and begins an alien invasion right there in everyone's backyards. Laugh-fest ghorror ensues, and not just on screen. Fillion hogs the camera with his natural charisma, but he does a good balancing act between wise-xxx and xxxhole. Throughout the film, he'd done a number of gag jokes with the punch-line ""I'm Bill Pardy"". All of the bit is caught in the special features. The film also comes with 2 featurettes, one alone set for the special effects. Also included is a set tour with Fillion and a commentary track with Director James Gunn.

But wait.... There's more. There's a ton of material for a film that was less than a critical success. And that makes them mighty. Or so the protagonist might say.

The film cannot be over-stated for any fan of the genre. Who's ready to Pardy?",1318982400,,1156,4.741293532338308

Writer / director James Gunn largely succeeded in his goal of producing a horror comedy that pays homage to the many films that could share the above summary.  He understands that there is a lot of humor to be gleaned from the reactions of everyday folk to extraordinary events.  When things are happening on screen, this film is quite entertaining.  However, there is too much of a slow build-up as we watch the gradual transformation of patient zero (Michael Rooker).  We already know where this is leading, so I found myself impatient to get there.  In addition, I was often put off by the disgusting parts.  I can appreciate gore as much as the next horror movie fan, but I don't share Gunn's aesthetic (if that isn't too grand a way of putting it).  Bloated, veiny characters wallowing in the guts of dead pets and lots of morbidly obese fat suits doesn't make for a good time at the movies for me.

1567840,5,B00005JOUX,"Director James Gunn, a veteran of Troma videos, blends the fun atmosphere of a Troma movie with the budget and cinematography of a studio production. This was not a high budget affair within the scope of studio fare, though aside from a few effect compromises (which the director admits in the commentary) the low budget kept the production focused on fun storytelling. Slither straddles a unique mood that combines an homage to classic horror with a slick progression that some of those older movies couldn't quite hit. It is more a hip horror movie with comedy than a straight horror-comedy (a la Shaun of the Dead). It is well cast across the board and I think it does a great job of representing how people would react in real life to a wild situation.

I'll admit I was tempted to go for the blu ray update of this movie, but to be honest cutting edge effects aren't the focus of the movie. The narrative and the satire are the meat. So the value of the DVD was worth it, especially with the upconversion of my blu ray player.

1567844,4,B00005JOUX,"Writer/director James Gunn's Slither (2006), is an entertaining horror feature that provides some scares, as well as some funny gross out moments.  For what it is, the story holds together well, and contains some unexpected twists, as the people in the small farming community of Wheelsy, South Carolina must deal with some very hungry aliens.

Out for a little extra-marital fun in the woods with his girlfriend Brenda (Brenda James), Grant Grant (Michael Rooker) is infected by an alien that starts to take over his body, and make him insatiably hungry.  Later Grant infects Brenda, and then holds her prisoner in the woods.  He eventually gets violent with his wife Starla (Elizabeth Banks), and is forced to flee into the woods to escape the police led by Sheriff Bill Purdy (Nathan Fillion).

Feeding on local farm animals, Grant soon becomes a huge gross freak.  He infects Brenda, using her to breed a huge quantity of wormlike alien creatures, who after an explosive start, begin to attack the population, entering through the mouth, and turning them into mindless creatures under Grant's telepathic control.  Kylie (Tania Saulnier), a teenager, barely manages to prevent one of the worms from diving down her throat, is then attacked by members of her own family who have been taken over the aliens.  Fortunately, Purdy comes to her rescue, and based on information provided by Kylie, the pair attempt  to hunt down Grant and rescue Starla, leading to a wildly explosive conclusion.

As far as goofy alien monster tales go, the film combines well executed special effects, with a pretty interesting story, that features some grotesquely humorous elements, and lots of gooey liquids.  The tone is generally edgy, with a serious attitude most of the time.  The acting performances are good, with Michael Rooker getting a chance to go a little crazy.  Tania Saulnier is cool, in a role that is more significant than it first appears.

An alien menace threatens to destroy the small town of Wheelsy when the parasitic slugs begin to turn its citizens into mind-controlled zombies. Director James Gunn firmly denies having seen Fred Dekker's NIGHT OF THE CREEPS prior to filming, however the two films share far too many similarities to be ignored. Numerous other nods to 80s classics (including ""Henenlotter's Lodge,"" a cameo by Lloyd Kaufman, and a modified version of the PREDATOR theme) only strengthen the case against him, but regardless of the alleged plagiarism, SLiTHER provides enough originality and entertainment to distinguish it from its predecessor. The acid-spitting, slug-infested creatures make for a refreshing change-up from the usual zombie fare, and their group consciousness gives them another unique edge. Michael Rooker's off-beat performance as the mutated Grant is as creepy as it is disgusting, while each of the other characters hold their own as they shoot and stab their way through town. SLiTHER also offers an even blend of practical and digital FX, only relying on computer imaging for shots that could not be realistically completed in-frame. With its sharp wit and buckets of blood, SLiTHER makes for a ton of gross-out fun!

1567870,5,B00005JOUX,"Despite hearing bundles of praise for ""Slither"" I was on-the-fence about renting it. The thing is, it's one of those genre-bending horror-comedy flicks and I find those too contrived and cheeky to like. The only one coming to mind at all being Eli Roth's ""Cabin Fever"" -- which I'd recommend to fans of ""Slither"".

""Slither"" impressed me completely. I found myself cringing at the (top-notch) effects and laughing at many of the deftly-executed jokes throughout. For me this movie succeeded in its two objectives -- grossing me out and making me chuckle. And what more could I ask for?

In order to appreciate this you need to have an open mind while viewing. Don't watch set out to deliberatly not laugh or else the hilarity of the movie will be in vain. Don't watch and expect nightmare-inducing images of horror because this movie is not like that -- it's a pure splatterfest. Never did I feel scared but the awesome gore and flawless creature design were admirable and nasty (aka *NOT* a CGI free-for-all a la ""The Midnight Meat Train"").

Every character you encounter from the major to the minor is perfect. They're all 100% genuine and could easily exist among us. We have no He-Men or Wonder Women who can have their arm torn from its socket and four rounds embedded in their chests and still pummel the baddies.

While on the topic of characters I MUST mention Gregg Henry (who played Mayor Jack MacReady). He is comedic gold and is quite possibly the most quotable dude in cinema history. His role made the movie for me (well, that may be a stretch...) and I need to commit some of his one-liners to memory to use day-to-day. In any other movie the lines would've been pure cheese and killed the feel, but the timing of the comedy is brilliant.

Most horror-comedy crossovers have an atrocious story with trite ideas and try to force snickers out of you with sheer ridiculousness alone, but not ""Slither"". This had a feasible plot with clever ideas (though it may have borrowed a thing or two from creature-feature heavy-weight ""Alien"") and if it wasn't such a riot it would've made a damn fine alien invasion flick.

An 80's horror throwback, a knot-inducing riot, and a splatterfest like no other, I have nothing negative to say about ""Slither"". Hopefully this week I'll track down a copy to buy so it can snake its way into my horror collection.

Slither consists of way to many timeworn clich's to list here but in general it is an Eighties style creature feature. What sets it apart from is brethren is a top notch cast, (Michael Rooker and Tania Saulnier both put in excellent turns), great special effects, (a minimum of bad CGI and a lot of good make-up effects) and a generally funny script.

The only problem with the movie (outside of a tendency to overplay the campy) is that is eminently forgettable. Unlike recent straight horror films such as Saw or Hostel or even recent horror/comedy hybrids such as Shaun of the Dead, Slither doesn't have a single original thought or scene in its pretty little head.

It's like that girl you dated in college that was pretty good looking but boring in and out of the sack. (No, I cannot remember her name either.) I have to concentrate to recall even a couple of scenes from Slither and heck I just watched the thing. I can remember about every scene from American Werewolf in London and I have not seen that in many moons (Please pardon the lame stretch for a pun.) One critic called it empty calories and I could not agree more. No doubt, it is a good time for horror and action fans just do not expect any lasting impression.",1258329600,,1486,4.496296296296296
1567873,4,B00005JOUX,"No animals were harmed or killed in the making of this film.  One would hope this statement is true.  The same may not be true of the humans.

James Gunn delivers one of the best horror/ science fiction films that I have seen in years with the right amounts of action and humor to make this film recipe a county fair winner.  The setting is a small Southern town with the poor and the rich sections very visible to the candid observer.  However, the film was shot totally in Vancouver based on the film credits.

With the premise presented in high biology class that evolution is more than who can survive based on fitness, etc. this theme is played out as the film progresses.  Man has only been around for a short period on the time scale. An alien, older than humans, arrives on earth to conquer the planet, perhaps to add one more notch to its slimy belt.

Of course, in some ways this is a modernized western- the pretty school ma, the brave sheriff (chief of police), the rich dude (there's always some rich dude involved), and the bad guy and his ruthless gang of blood thirsting sociopaths. The deputies are a hoot.

The mayor is not afraid to use verbal adjectives to describe the situation and his own feelings.  This colorful commentary runs throughout the film which adds a touch.  His only serious moment comes in the end of the film, and it is a powerful one.

Of course, the young school teacher is married to the old rich guy.  The chief of police is still in love with her, and she knows it so well.  However, she and her rich husband take their wedding vows seriously which is another theme in this film.

The scene with the young farm girl in the bathtub is one of the most gripping moments of the film as she fights to survive against the increasing alien hordes.  Her mother, father, and two younger siblings are not so lucky against the invaders.

Special effects and the music are good.  The acting is well executed.

Nathan Fillon and Elizabeth Banks are well cast as the leads.  Gregg Henry is the mayor, an avid Animal Planet viewer-go figure.  Tania Saulnier is the terrified farm girl who shows why an alien should not mess with an American country girl.

This is not suited for children.  There are too many dead things lying about in various states.",1246147200,,2279,4.478155339805825
1567874,3,B00005JOUX,"In Slither James Gunn has created an homage to the 1980's monster movies of his youth. The film borrows heavily on antecedents from those films and is quite entertaining if not absolutely original.

Nathan Fillion stars as Sheriff Bill Pardy who must deal with an alien invasion of his sleepy southern town. Michael Rooker plays Grant Grant (yes he has identical names) who is infected by the alien on a night out in the woods with a woman who is not his wife (Brenda James). It is on his return home to his wife Starla ( Elizabeth Banks) that the fun begins.

This is not a film for everyone as it exceeds most releases in the gore level present. It was however a pleasant little suLloyd Kaufman rprise of a film. If you are looking for sophisticated entertainment this may not be for you. It is also an homage to the late seventies and early eighties Troma films that were so bad they were good. In this regard look for a cameo by Troma founder Lloyd Kaufman as a drunk in the police station.

The widescreen disc contains a good audio commentary by Gunn and Fillion, extended and deleted scenes, a gag reel and several making of featurettes.

1567907,5,B00005JOUX,"The greatest thing about `Slither' is that it never feels regurgitated or like mere mimicry; as so many other so called horror spoofs do these days.  No, `Slither' feels one hundred percent original.  Instead of being a blatant movie spoof (ala `Scary Movie') it is more a comedy horror film, infiltrating its inspired plot with enough of its own originality to warrant multiple viewings and ones praise and admiration.

The film is about these alien slug creatures that make their way to earth on an asteroid and infect this town, turning everyone they contact into flesh eating zombies.  It starts when a young teachers older husband Grant gets attacked, turning him into this tentacle wielding host slug.  After his initial infection the town starts to spiral downhill until there are only a few human survivors staging an all out war against the zombies.

Using the right breed of humor to mix with the right amount of gore, `Slither' manages to be both funny and scary.  Sure, its not going to send you to bed with nightmares (unless you are deathly afraid of bugs) but it will send shivers down your spine and give you the creepy crawlies as you sit huddled on your couch.  Don't get too comfortable though, since the unending humor and laugh out loud sequences will keep you writhing in laughter.

The actors here all carry their weight well, Elizabeth Banks and Nathan Fillion taking center stage as Grant's young wife and the local sheriff who is vying for her affection.  Michael Rooker is effectively slimy as Grant and Gregg Henry (from `The Riches') is hilarious as the mayor Jack MacReady.  There is not a moment where I really felt the film could have been improved upon, although I'm sure that it could have been.  My best friend just got done telling me that he hated this movie (precisely the inspiration I needed to write this review) and I spent like twenty minutes fighting violently about his warped opinion.

Honestly, some will hate this, I know...but really; why?

In the end I confess that this is a guilty pleasure, but one that you do not need to feel guilty about.  It's gory, uncomfortable and gross, not to mention hilariously capable of making that gore totally warranted and acceptable.  I fully enjoyed this rompfest from start to finish and hope that you will too.",1221177600,,2299,4.767676767676767
1567908,4,B00005JOUX,"Who would have thought that in 2006 that someone could take the cheesy horror vibe involving alien subplots, slimy stuff, and zombies from the 80's and modernize it with enough great actors, story, gore, and wit to satisfy the masses (I'm referring to the horror loving mass and more)? Well, James Gunn successfully accomplished just that with Slither.

 The story to Slither is simply that an alien pod crash lands on earth and strangely infects a man. The -whatever- infecting the man begins to gather its army by impregnating a woman (whose ""birth"" scene is definitely one for the books) and creating an army of ""hosts"" (this is where the zombie-likes come in) to accomplish its world domination (this plan is seen through flashes of a girl who was almost infected). We are then thrown into all of this through the story of a local cop (played to perfect wit by Nathan Fillion), the wife of the man infected (Elizabeth Banks, you are a beauty), and a teenage girl who watched her family get brutally infected.

 Gunn treated us to so many throwbacks that it was almost too pleasurable to view. Slither is very reminiscent of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Night-of-the-Creeps/dp/6301935136/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Night of the Creeps</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Night-of-the-Comet/dp/B000MDFTHE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Night of the Comet</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blob/dp/B00005N5RM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blob</a>, and so many other alien invasion / hosts horror / comedies from the 80's that the film instantly gives a true feeling of nostalgia.

1567909,5,B00005JOUX,"""Slither"" is great science fiction horror that manages to be both frightening and humorous.  ""Alien Slugs"" would have been a more apt title in lieu of ""Slither,"" which makes one think of snakes.  This slick film reminded me of a plethora of science fiction classics ranging from ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" to ""Alien"" to ""Xtro"" to ""The Puppet Masters.""

  A small meteor lands in the woods.  A slug-like alien emerges.  It attaches itself to the brain of a human host, Grant, which develops an insatiable appetite for meat.  Each time it feeds, it mutates until it resembles a nebulous creature (a similar fate befell an astronaut in ""The Quatermass Xperiment"").  This creature creates more hosts (for producing more slug-like aliens) and it creates zombies that find meat, both animal and human, for the hosts to consume.  Soon an entire town is threatened with annihilation.  This film contains some scenes that are tense, frightening, and gross.  It is also punctuated with redneck comic relief that makes you laugh out loud, thus relieving you of some of the tension.

  Kudos to the casting director for picking extras who actually looked like real people who would live in a small, rural town.  They could've been in a John Cougar Mellencamp video.

  The action was well paced, I laughed aloud at some of the one liners, and I can't complain about the body count - it was very high.  Good science fiction theories were provided.  The aliens had Collective Thinking; if one saw, they all saw.  Many of the zombies acted, spoke, and thought like Grant, which had humorous consequences.

  ""Slither"" is a must see for fans of modern science fiction horror or for fans, like myself, who enjoy all types of horror.  If you can withstand the slimy goo and gore, you will enjoy this movie.  ""Slither"" has something for all horror fans.",1221004800,2,1840,4.832797427652733

In Night of the Creeps, alien slugs turn human hosts into zombies by going into a persons mouth. SLither seems like a remake with added special effects and a different plot..slightly.

An alien crash lands in a small town and infects Grant. After him not feeling to good, he begins to transform into a hideous creature that needs a human host to breed and create the slugs that you see on the cover of the DVD. The way these slugs turn humans into zombies is by way of the mouth. A young girl almost is turned into one of them but manages to not swallow the slug. However her whole family wasn't that lucky. Anyway, somehow she sees Grant as the alien and what its plans are when the slug was trying to turn her into a zombie. The only ones left in the town that is totally infected are Kylie (the young girl who stopped the slug from getting her), Starla (Grant's wife), the chief of police Pardy, and Wally. Can they stop Grant the alien's plan? Will Grant get these survivors? I don't want to give away too much so I will stop here.

All in all this was a decent thriller. It has a decent amount to get you to watch it, then you might watch it a few more times. It won't scare you or making you jump out of your seat. Heads are blown up, some stabbings, a creepy deer, and lots of zombies are the ingredients to this movie. It's more like an entry thriller. It does have some good comedy moments. Pardy (Nathan Fillion) and especially Wally (Don Thompson) are funny. Listen for the song at the end of the movie. The song is funny. Listen to the lyrics.

The DVD features a clean widescreen print, great sound, and an absolute ton of extra features.

OK let's forget the last two because ""Slither"" is a surprisingly entertaining film. It may not be a groundbreaking horror film and probably needs a better ending, but for most horror fans this one should not be missed, with several (intentionally) grotesque scenes that might make you giggle or grin.

The slim story doesn't need summery. A meteorite falls onto a sleepy town. The townspeople are attacked by some slimy, squirming creatures. Humans led by Nathan Fillon's sheriff fight back. That's it. But this time you shluld never, ever scream even if you see them crawling on the floor (for the reason you should see in the film). The film's often squirmy set-pieces include one huge lady in a barn (one of the highlights of the film), gross-out jokes and one big squid-like monster.

Some people say (perhaps rightly) that ""Slither"" is a horror comedy, but to me it is homage to the horror films made in 1980s. Unlike them, ""Slither"" makes use of CG effects when it has to (like the slug-like creatures), but at the same time James Gunn insists on using the old-fashioned way, I mean lots of slime, and it is easy to imagine the hard work that the cast and crew had to do, especially Michael Rooker. His transformation process is also impressive.

Despite some weaker moments where things get a bit familiar, ""Slither"" is one of the better films in the increasingly overcrowded genre of the undeads.",1199318400,,1570,4.764705882352941

Some people think that horror and comedy don't work well together. I disagree. With the theaters flooded with Freddy and Jason and Michael, let alone the many imitators, those icons have become a parody of themselves. I love the Nightmare on Elm Street movies, but Freddy Krueger is no longer scary. Jason Voorhees is not scary. Nor is Michael Myers. If you see them in a theater, there is always laughter from the audience, most of the time, unintentional. Why not play that angle up and have the audience laugh because they're supposed to? I just do not understand how this movie bombed at the box office. I certainly hope that international ticket sales and the sale of the DVD helped this movie make a profit. That said, this is a fun, well crafted, gross out movie that I can not recommend enough!

It happens all too often, though there really is no accounting for taste especially when it comes to horror movies.  Well, as a minor validation of my title, I don't get too excited about movies very often (for what that's worth) and I have pretty broad tastes in movie.  I can accept ""stupid but entertaining"", ""great story bad acting"", ""simple plot with lots of good action"" and of course ""great movies"".  I can't enjoy ""The plot to nowhere (see ""The Ring""), ""pretentious and pointless (see ""suspect Zero"") and I really draw the line at ""boring no matter how intelligent"".

When I first saw trailers for this film, I thought ""Cool, a movie about killer slugs!"" and then quickly gave up all hope of actually going to the theater and seeing it (my wife hates horror movies and I don't enjoy going alone).  As a busy father of 2 young kids, I don't get to see these types of films. It won't fit in the schedule.  So, I forgot about ""Slither"" until I recently went on one of my annual Halloween DVD buying binges.  The good reviews here and the low price convinced me it was a good choice.  (Sorry this is taking so long)  The point is; I really had ""Low budget, entertaining horror film"" expectations.

Boy; was I wrong.  This film is entertaining on so many levels. Here's a list of superlatives that easily describe this film:

-funny, scary, gross, intelligent, creative, genuine, well-acted, high-quality, shocking, surprising, fast-paced, entertaining, crazy, demented...  well I could just keep going.

Don't get me wrong, this is not ""Citizen Kane"" or even ""Alien"".  What this is is a great horror-homage film that sets its own standards for horror-comedy.  It's not so funny that it's ok if you don't like horror.  You really need to like horror to appreciate this film.  It's not so scary that it's ok if you don't like comedies.  This film takes itself seriously enough to give it credibility, but also pokes fun at itself constantly. It would also help if you can appreciate sci-fi horror.  It also would not hurt if you were a fan of Nathan Fillion (Firefly).  He is absolutely perfect as the reluctant, de facto hero.  If you like ""Dead Alive"" or ""From Beyond"" then this is nirvana!

What this film lacks are characters that do unbelievably stupid things (like walk alone, BACKWARDS, into a dark room), Unnatural human behavior (people are truly stunned and flabbergasted by what is occurring) and convenient caveats to help the characters weasel out of trouble (nothing ever goes according to plan).  Lacking all of these standard horror movie ""flaws"" makes ""slither"" a pure joy for fans of this genre.

A fun game for horror/film fans is trying to pick out how many films ""slither"" references throughout.  Here's a list of some of the references I caught after 1 viewing;
""Streetcar named Desire"", ""From Beyond"", ""Night of the Living Dead"", ""Return of the Living Dead"", ""Alien"", ""The Thing"", and ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"".  See if you can pick these and other references out.  There are definitely more.

A strange review, I know, but this film excited me so much I just had to share that with people.  This DVD is chocked full of good extras, so a great value.  Just so you know; the slugs are minor player in the overall appeal of this film.",1191974400,35,3418,4.700336700336701
1567977,5,B00005JOUX,"Just try watching this film without asking for some meat.
Slither doesn't waste time building up, it jumps right into the squirming nest of its plot.  Grant, dissatisfied with Starla's bedroom rejection, goes out for a drink and meets Brenda.  Fooling around in the woods, they stumble across a strange, gooey sac.  The sac fires a little worm dart into Grant, and Grant immediately becomes infected.  With the strange changes going on within him (eating meat, making a leaf nest in the basement) he visits Brenda again and gives her a little wormsperm from his new tentacles.

His wife Starla knows something is wrong with Grant, but isn't fully alerted to it until Chief Bill Pardy shows up at her house with news of the missing Brenda.  Its then that Starla discovers Grant's basement full of treats.

Grant's changes are quite noticeable now, and the town goes hunting for the ""squid"" that's attacking local livestock.  During the course of the hunt, there's a great bloody scene where one of the hunters ""splits"" from the group.  Approach the barn, and we find Brenda again, but boy has she changed.  (I'm so hungry, would you mind handin me a piece of that possum over there?)  Enter the worms.  Now the hunt is really on for Grant, or rather what used to be Grant.

Zombie-like victims begin stalking Starla, Bill, Jack (the mayor and comedic relief) and Kylie (the only survivor from the farm they found Grant on).  There's a lot more slithery, slimy, ooey-gooey fun, you'll simply have to watch the movie to take it all in.

The FX is quite good in this 'B' grade horror film, the acting is decent and the film is fast moving and filled with surprises.  The ending is great (love the beast), but make sure to watch the film all the way to the end of the credits.  Any fan of the squiggly, the squirmy, is going to love 'Slither'.  The movie gets a strong 5 star rating from me.  Enjoy!",1190851200,5,1894,4.583333333333333
1567978,4,B00005JOUX,"Enjoyed it just as I thought I would.  Nothing earth shattering but a pleasant enough horror comedy along the lines of--remember TREMORS with Kevin Bacon?  This is like that, except than Nathan (FIREFLY) Fillion is filling in those big Bacon shoes as the local lawman puzzled by an outbreak of disgusting, wriggly, phallic looking roundworms that aim for the victim's open mouth so if you don't talk they can't get you I guess.

Nathan Fillion is appealing in the backstory too, when he was a teen the girl next door approached him and asled him to help her run away from Wheelsy to Hollywood where she would be a star and he could be her bodyguard.  All his life he's regretted saying no to the cute little tyke, all the more so since she grew up to be Elizabeth Banks and got herself hitched to the richest son of a gun in town, Grant Grant (played by Michael Rooker and even scarier than he was as HENRY PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER).  The romance between Fillion and Banks has enough emotional resonance so we never give up on the film as a grossout contest, and it provides for some outstanding scenes in which first she sacrifices herself to save his life, then vice versa--TROMEO AND JULIET all over again.

They should publish the screenplay of SLITHER, it's so clever, although a little of Gregg Henry went a long way for me.  Somebody gave him fifty cents for every time he'd holler out his dialogue instead of speaking it, and he wound up with five hundred thousand dollars.",1188691200,2,1484,4.535580524344569

Mutating and manifesting inside his body he starts to infect some of the locals and turning them into vicious zombies and ugly mutations, only his wife (Elizabeth Grant) and a local sheriff Bill Pardy (Nathan Fillion) must destroy these creatures.

Extremely entertaining, gory and hilarious Sci-fi horror comedy that pays homages to Sci-fi horror movies of the 50's, 60's, 70's and 80's in a well done and funny manner thanks to the wonderful mind of former Troma filmmaker and writer of ""Dawn of the Dead (2004)"" James Gunn. The acting is terrific especially from the star of the cult 1990 classic ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"" and Fillion who always does excellent roles, the make-up effects & gore with the CGI creatures are fantastic and there's a cameo appearence by Troma co-founder Lloyd Kaufman, it bombed in theaters and has now become somewhat of a cult fave. If you want a movie that delivers the goods then this could be the movie for you and it's an instant cult classic for the new millenium.

The DVD offers great picture and sound with fantastic extras like deleted & extended scenes, gag reel, an audio commentary by the writer/Director and Nathan Fillion, a load of featurettes and more.

Well, this is an equally fun homage to 80's-style horror/gore flicks.  If you're open-minded enough(and can stomach the gross-out efx), i strongly recommend you give this a try.  The first 3'rd or so is a little slow(deliberately according to the commentary), but hang in there as the rest of the film picks up the pace and is really a lot of fun.  Speaking of the commentary, it's actually worth listening to but even if you don't there are plenty of other extras worth your time including making of's and a gag reel.  So let's see: fun horror movie that doesn't skimp on the gross-out effects, tons of bonus content, and all at a low price.  It sort of recommends itself.  (overall, 4 stars for movie rounded up to 5 for the dvd content)",1185926400,2,906,4.654088050314465
1567981,5,B00005JOUX,"We've all seen the place or heard its mention - a sleepy little town where everybody suffers from the six degrees of Kevin Bacon in more ways than most can imagine, where ""agro"" is the culture and where time seems a little slower - and sometimes the angle seems worked to death when it comes to horror movies. The seclusion is wonderful and the echoes don't have to fade rapidly, sure, but it seems you always have to import people to watch the story progress or follow some type of clich&eacute; lay-out. In a way that's what makes Slither such a superb hit; you know a lot of the pieces that make up the puzzle and there's no attempt to hide it. You know there are going to be scenes that are hideous and you know there are going to be wide-open acres that seem to stream together, but things like dialog and wit and the way effects are combined seem to take the old and remake it into something renewed again.

One of the things that immediately made me want to see the movie was a cast led by Nathan Fillion. While he isn't a name that immediate springs to mind when it comes to a comedic sense, he has to be one of the best when it comes to delivery and better still when it comes to convincing his audience. Watching his facial expressions and the range he brings seems to push me into the moment in a different manner, still leaving things horrifying and repugnant but making them deliciously funny at the same time. I, for instance, didn't really think I would be laughing at some of the things I laughed at in Slither because, quite frankly, it is a reallly gory film.
Still, it manages to filter in zombies, slugs, monstrous aliens, and more and do so in a humorous manner.

I've heard a lot of opinions on the movie and a lot of the pros I listed for the movie were used against it as well. And while I can see how that can be justified, I always try to lower my expectations that have been built by random hype and different types of media, try to forget the type of movie I think I'm going to see because the best movies are genre-benders, and then see if the movie is for me. I guess that's the trouble with movies and reviews; you can say that a person should watch something a million times over but, in the end, one person's pearls are another person's, ummm, pencils?
Still, this comes highly recommended for people who like their gore with humor and the feeling of stepping into a cinema time capsule.",1184803200,3,2420,4.316483516483516

Nathan Fillion does an excellent job, even though his southern accent sounds fake (I'd know since I live in Georgia).

Overall, this movie is kind of cheesy, but that is what made the movies of the past so much fun. It doesn't take itself so seriously, but still entertains remarkably.

Along the lines of such cult classics as The Toxic Avenger and Nuke 'em High, this film is fun and funny.

The cast is great. Unlike so many movies, horror and otherwise, they seemed natural, and not like a bunch of people acting like other people. Nathan Fillion is one of the rare actors who seems to be this way in everything he does, and it's such a pleasure to watch, from Firefly to Slither. The director, Mr. Gunn seems to be really good with people who can work this way, and I say Kudos!

Not for young kids, and not for people who prefer nothing but hack & slash gore. It's a pretty good story, well done on the visual effects and creature creation, only, they forgot the slime trails....tsk, tsk... But overall, a pleasure to have in my collection.

1568028,5,B00005JOUX,"""Slither"" is not a particularly scary horror movie, and indeed in one of the copious extra features the director James Gunn tells us that his goal was to make an 80's style fun, slightly comedic horror movie.  He certainly succeeded.  It's fun without being overly jokey.

From almost the first scene, horror and sci-fi fans will pick out a plethora of bits of homages to different classic horror and sci-fi movies.  Gunn did a good job of referring to these classic bits without relying on them, ripping them off or making them too obvious.

Michael Rooker is fantastic, as always.  And Nathan Fillion plays the same character he always does, but he always does it so well!

One of the secrets of a good genre movie - particularly in the horror, SF and heist genres - is to just keep it moving.  If the movie slows down enough to let you think about it too much, it lets you think about plot holes and implausibilities, taking you out of the moment and preventing you from suspending your disbelief.  Not that keeping it moving can compensate for a bad script, but it helps the viewer not sweat the small illogical stuff in any movie.  ""Slither"" not only keeps the plot moving, but it has a decent script played out with good to great performances.

""Slither"" is at least worth a rent, even by non-horror fans.  If you liked ""Cabin Fever,"" you'll definitely like this.",1178755200,2,1369,4.588477366255144

1568030,4,B00005JOUX,"`Slither', written and directed by James Gunn, is, by its own admission, a comedy / horror pastiche of just about every sci-fi horror device known to man. So, the question is largely does it work better as a comedy or as a horror flick. Unfortunately, I cannot give a definative answer, since it probably depends so much on the viewer's history and taste in horror movies.

Even before I watched the movie with the director and lead actor's commentary, I saw many sly references to both major and `cult' horror movies. The most obvious ones are to `Alien', `The Blob', `Psycho', `Critters', `The Puppet Masters' (the one based on Robert Heinlein's novel), `Tremors', `Night of the Living Dead' (and other `Dead' flicks) and even `The Return of the Jedi' (a sly homage here to Jabba the Hutt). The commentary adds the fact that the character names and signs on the street of our little hamlet venue all slyly refer to some major figure in horror writing or filmmaking.

One piece of evidence tipping the balance toward comedy is the improbability of events, especially of the ending, even after you accept some of the film's basic premises. The film follows the tired plot device of exposing the primary heros to danger over and over, without their falling victim to the monsters, while everyone else in the village seems to sucumb without so much as a `how do you do'. A strong contrast can be made here with `Invasion of the Body Snatchers', where the spread of the alien infestation is much, much more believable, and therefore, far more scary.

Since so many of the scenes are derived from other films, there is far less surprise than there is the fun of recognizing that ""oh yes, that's a piece of business from `Alien'"". That means there is also less scariness. The film makes up for this in lots and lots of second rate special effects gore. In the bonus features, there is a piece on how their synthetic blood was made, which clearly explained why it was so unbelievable as blood on the screen.

Two of the more positive aspects of the film are character actors Greg Henry and Michael Rooker, who routinely show up as guest cast members in TV dramas and whose faces, therefore, are far more familiar than either leads, Nathan Fillion or Elizabeth Banks.

As a DVD package, it has somewhat more than the average number of special features, including a good commentary soundtrack and lots of explanations for how the effects were done. Of course, as a special effects fest, one expects these, and their execution is a bit better than average, which pushes my rating from about 3 and a half stars to four, since a good commentary track essentially doubles the rewatchability of the film.",1177632000,2,2691,4.717021276595744
1568031,5,B00005JOUX,"This had it all: (well it had a lot) - Creatures coming from a falling meteor, zombies, comedy, yokels. The mayor was a hoot.  Grant was amazing and Starla was somewhere between Ripley in Alien and Clueless.  This was just fun to watch as it obviously had no intention of taking itself seriously.  The movie just spent 96 minutes entertaining you.  As for the plot?  Well,  it had one.  It was a plot that has been in dozens of other films.  Oh, and stick around for the ending...Not the one when the credits start to roll.  The film doesn't end until after the credits and it is worth sticking around for.  Stupid cat.  One complaint though...The use of the 'F' word.  A lot of unnecessary language that could have easily been toned down and would not have hurt the film at all.",1176854400,2,779,4.408450704225352
1568032,3,B00005JOUX,"If you're a fan of sci-fi and horror movies, particularly those that are heavy on gore and goo, then you'll enjoy ""Slither.""  It opens with a sequence straight out of ""The Blob"" - meteor crashes near a small town; icky blob of alien goo emerges - and proceeds to incorporate scenes and motifs from a wide array of old movies. Among those borrowed from are Psycho, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Night of The Living Dead, Alien, Tremors and The Exorcist. This patchwork approach to plot development results in a fairly sketchy storyline, but if you aren't too concerned with such things, ""Slither"" will keep you entertained almost continuously.

A couple of warnings, though:  First, there's a LOT of pretty gross splatter and gore. And second, there's a lot of rough language throughout the movie.  But if these things don't bother you, and you like this genre, have at it!",1176508800,3,874,4.806666666666667

The characters have no personality, the whle thing is one dimensional and the comical bits are so uncomical it is ust stupid and misplaced. It is actually so bad, it looks like some amateur thing that was put together in high school. No storyline, no tension, nothing. Diabolical.

1568034,3,B00005JOUX,"Take equal measures of the 1970s classics ""Squirm"" and ""Night of the Living Dead"" and throw in ""Shaun of the Dead"" and you get ""Slither"", a film clearly inspired by 1950s sci-fi with a new century splatter, humor first seen in ""American Werewolf in London"", and the best modern special effects. The sum of all these parts is a slick, smart and funny horror film about a space invader that looks like a big slug who goes about infecting the townspeople in Small Town America to prepare for an alien invasion.

If this all sounds familiar, if should. There is nothing unique about this film. It has just about no stars big or small (Michael Rooker, who played one of the Black Sox conspirators in ""Eight Men Out"" is the most accomplished character actor in the cast). It contains hardly a single memorable performance or characterization and only one or great really great line: ""Are you having a good night?"" the sheriff asks some of the townfolk, whose friends and relatives have all been alternatiely eaten and infected by zombies while the marauding invader has spawned a million little slugs. The ending is just as much fun as everything else, with a big explosion of flesh and blood that helps truth and honor win out.

I really enjoyed this movie while I was watching it butbut don't think of it as being memorable. It's not like really good horror films such as ""The Hidden"", the original ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" or any of the atomic-induced monsters from the 1950s invading USA that were metaphors for Communism. Perhaps if the invading monster slug was somehow cast as a radical Muslim whose goal was to eliminate Christianity, I'd have felt some of that metaphoric hysteria.

But, alas, all we have here is an invading monster, a lot of pretty stupid people in Small Town America (Wheelsy, S.C.), a copy of ""The Blob"" that leads to ""Night of the Living Dead"" with something like ""Outbreak"" going on but not as individual as any of those films. Still, ""Slither"" is fine entertainment in its own right not to be missed by fans of the horror genre that gives you a lot of laughs along the way. It's B movie material all the way and proud of it.

All you have to do is go to your collection and get ""Night of the Creeps"" and ""The Faculty"" which were much better by far than this, and that's where you get ""Slither"". It's a rip off, and not a very good one at that. This movie is far from Horror or Comedy because it was way too stupid to be scary or funny. Honestly, I don't see how anybody could say that this movie is good. I guess it's a matter of taste in this case, and this movie left a very bad taste in my mouth. Frankly, I'll tell you exactly what this movie is in 1 word..NASTY! This movie shows you a lot of disgusting scenes to entertain you that's all. I don't know when people will realize a lot of the movies these days are only trying to distract the audience from the fact that the movie actually sucks with a capital S. Then again, what you can always expect from American Film makers is either gonna be.. GORE! OR DISGUST! to replace actual STORYLINE! and PLOT!. They don't make anything the way they used to.

What happened to classics like the ""Alien"" franchise or ""The Thing""? Better yet, what about the classics with actors like Christopher Lee, Boris Karloff and Vincent Price. What about movies like ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" or zombie movies like ""Night, Dawn, Day, as well as, Return of the living Dead"". Instead you get movies like ""Slither"" Is that the best they could do? Is this all Hollywood has to offer now? I certainly hope not. At any rate, my intention is not to go on and on about old movies, but I just miss those days when we had people like Alfred Hitchcock around.

Grant strikes me as a grody fellow flicking his wife's nipples at a lame attempt to ""turn her on"" like a light switch. And policeman Bill isn't any better. He is overbearing and rude. When Starla sweetly tells him to be careful and stares longingly at him waiting for his reply, he brusquely says, ""Yeah, now there's a thought."" Starla had dreams to move to LA and frankly I think she had a better chance dealing with the sharks there. Screw these hillbilly jerks.

Also, the subplot of the Sheriff lusting after Starla was underdeveloped. I didn't feel a connection between them at all and love developing there seems unbelievable. A simple flashback to them at an earlier age could have helped to fix that. Or, you know, he could have pretended to like her in a heterosexual type of way.

Call me crazy, but there were weird sexual undertones that I do not understand. There is talk of Survival of the Fittest during the film and I couldn't help, but think this was referring to the men and women on screen. There is the preacher hammering on about God eating fishes while Grant preyed on a lonely woman. And then there was the zombie dude who accusingly asked Starla, ""How could you blame someone for acting their nature?"" as though this is explanation enough for her horny husbands cheating ways.

The three main women are playing stereotypes- the gold-digger, frigid wife, the trailer trash single mom desperate for attention, and the 16yo naughty girl with painted nails in the nipple-flashing bathtub scene. Oh and the 2 tentacle, double penetration rape scene was oddly exploitive for such a mainstream movie.

Now, don't get me wrong. Slither is not a terrible film. But I am deeply disappointed after hearing the nonstop hype about the ""Best Horror Movie of 2006"". I felt overall it lacked in gore considering the lengthy articles Fangoria wrote on how they ran out of SFX supplies because it is just that darn gory. And the story was not original. It was part The Blob, part Shivers. And I really disliked the how the female characters were portrayed. But hey, other than that it was a fun film.

By now you should know who James Gunn is. He wrote ""Tromeo & Juliet"" ""Scooby Doo 1-2,"" and ""Dawn of the Dead."" I think he has strong skills as a writer, however, Slither suffered in the writing area probably because Gunn also takes over as director here. Tromeo was well written and had several likable characters and I bet it had less than half the budget Slither did.

Presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 with a running time of 96 minutes. The SFX were okay, but I heard that they used mostly real props and make-up to create the effects, but about 80% looked like fake CGI.

Trivia: Lloyd Kaufman, James Gunn, and his real life wife Jenna Fischer all make appearances. Kaufman had lines, but they were cut.

(Read Molly's Interview W/Lloyd Here) Favorite Quote: Kid asks, ""What's a 'gina'?"" Sheriff replies, ""It's a country. You know, where ""Ginese"" people come from."" DVD Extras: Making of, Deleted Scenes, Commentary, Gag Reel, and Slithery set tour.

Bottom Line: An okay horror-comedy, but if you are interested in a classic, stick with The Blob. And if you want exploitation fun, try Cronenberg's Shivers.

Rating: 6.5/10

THe movie itself is a throwback to 80's gross-out horror. Disgusting slugs squirming to get in your mouth and some of the best and disturbing scenes you'll see in any horror movie of '06. But what sets this movie apart form the other fair is the light and dark humor that permeates the story. The humor just fits with the story of a little hick town envaded by these slimy aliens. The humor reminds me of the Return of the Living Dead flicks from the 80's...mixing strong horror with equal laughs. Very enjoyable and fun...even if your stomach flips.

The movie does tread on many horro cliches, but the humnor is what keeps it fresh. I dare anyone not to laugh at any of the scenes including the mayor. From alien invasions, slimy slugs, zombies- this movie has it all. Without the humor- this would have been just another derivitave throw-away plot. The humor and very inventive gore scenes (some of which are disturbing) keeps this movie fresh.

The HD DVD version is a fantastic print and the movie never looked cleaner. I was amazed that a movie of this nature would look this good through HD DVD. Audio is equally up to par. This package is a great deal, giving you both the HD and regular versions of the movie.

If you like horror movies with a fair amount of gore and humor...then you will really dig this pic. People who like: Return of the Living Dead, Shawn of the Dead, and The Stuff will feel right at home with this title- a great homage to 80's splatter gore.",1171324800,3,1620,4.39
1568083,5,B00005JOUX,"The asteroid roars out of deep space, out of the inky, fathomless, crushing pressure of the infinite gulf of darkess, tears into our atmosphere, screams across the horizon and buries itself in the lower-40, or the dismal swamp, or the spooky woods.

What's left of the alien orb bubbles, and hisses, and spews, and crackles, and finally the hard crust of the meteor cracks open and something soft, pinkish, faintly luminescent, maybe pulsing with light, even, God, with hunger---something slithers out. Oh, and leaves a slime-trail behind it, as a kind of interstellar calling card and homing beacon for the Doomed & the Damned.

So this is what I want to know: when the hapless farmer, or drunken derelict, or in ""Slither""'s case the town tycoon Grant Grant (the great Michael Rooker with this glorious Deep South rasp), happen across our little alien day-tripper, this little blob of Intergalactic horror that looks for all the world like a glow-in-the-dark pound of snot---why do they feel the need to explore? To find out about it? To, you know, poke it with a stick?

Whatever the cause, the effect is swift and brutal and pretty sticky: a billions-of-years-old cosmic evil with a real hankering for Ground Round (rare!) sets up camp and puts down roots---or tentacles---in the hapless Grant, and faster than you can say ""Mid-Life Crisis"" the town of Wheelsy is in danger of being devoured---and the New Neighbors have their multi-faceted slug-eyes greedily set on the rest of Earth.

Now: we've heard this one before---the meteor crash, slugs that wanna try on our corporeal bodies like some kind of cheap tux on prom night, the townie Chief of Police (here played by Nathan Fillion, who owns his role like a champ and spookily channels a little Brendan Fraser---or is it just me?) who carries a torch for his old flame Starla (now Grant Grant's sweet thang, played by Elizabeth Banks, who does what she has to do), the single, desperate chance to kill the Hive Mind Superbug and save the planet.

Director James Gunn takes all of these timeworn & beloved splatter tropes and forges something approaching mad horror genius out of them. I'm telling you: if you love classic, goopy horror (Night of the Creeps, The Thing, Society), then ""Slither"" will make you giggle. It's got loads of goop, it's got body-hopping slugs, it's got slime, it's got poor old single-mom townie Brenda, who made the mistake of acting on a girlish crush on old Grant, swollen up like Godzilla's medicine ball whining ""something's wrong with me"". Indeed: let's talk about a bun in the oven.

It's sick, it's demented, it's actually astoundingly disgusting in spots, and it's even disturbing. For all its twisted humor---& in ""Slither"", much like ""Shaun of the Dead"", the jokes work more out of circumstance than hilarity---""Slither"" is a freakishly disturbing piece of grue, its nastiness underscored---maybe even alleviated---by the nervous laughs.

Take the sequence at the roadhouse, the countdown to the Deer Cheer, with Wheelsy's filth-spewing Mayor MacReady (Gregg Henry) lauding man's Dominion even as our interstellar New Kid on the Block (working out of his new digs in Grant's gut) pops the cork on a little major remodelling project of his own---it's a sequence that ratchets up the nerves, brings the blood to the face, and makes all but the most cold-blooded squirm.

It really does take a Village, after all.

I was very pleasantly surprised. It has a story line, and it actually does have plenty of scares, lots of gross stuff, and some pretty good humor. It has so many different aspects all in one film, that you would think it would be a bad flick...but it WORKS !!
I loved it !!!

It is not the type of movie such as the ""Scary Movie"" series, but more on the order of ""Shawn of the dead"" or ""Dead and Breakfast.""
Perhaps it is closest to ""The Blob."" It does put you in the mind of that movie the most, because of the rate the thing gobbles everything (AND everyONE) and the rate at which it grows !

It really is great fun!!!
I guarantee you will enjoy this movie !",1169251200,2,686,4.0
1568085,5,B00005JOUX,"Slither serves up a bloody good time indeed.  Knowing nothing about the movie going in, I initially thought this was going to be a somewhat disappointing horror film.  It didn't take long, though, for me to figure out that what we have here is a real gem of horror comedy.  The secret to its comedic success is the fact that, instead of going over the top for laughs, the characters pretty much play it straight throughout.  This thing is just full of terrific one-liners, not to mention subtle in-jokes that extend even beyond the horror genre.  There is also plenty of blood and guts for gorehounds to enjoy.  This is just one of those films that actually manages to balance that fine line between horror and comedy almost perfectly.

The basic storyline isn't anything new.  A meteorite crashes to Earth, unleashing a malevolent life form that gets right to work taking over the bodies of the locals and turning them into zombies, leaving a handful of main characters running around and fighting to survive.  And, of course, there's also a sort of romantic thing between the leading man and lady.  Wheelsy was a nice, quite, Southern town until this unexpected alien life form dug its way from the chest to the head of Grant Grant (yep, he has the same first and last names), played by Michael Rooker.  Grant's a really annoying dude before he turns into a meat-devouring zombie, and you spend the first part of the film wondering why as pretty a young lady as Starla (Elizabeth Banks) ever married him.  She's really committed to those wedding vows, but Grant isn't - not anymore, at least.  Soon a whole army of big, nasty, zombifying worms are unleashed to crawl down the throats of anyone and everyone in the local area.  These new zombies are not mindless, though - in fact, they all share Grant's mind.

Grant himself undergoes some rather dramatic physical changes as the story progresses.  There are basically three stages in the process: 1) leper, 2) squid, 3) Jabba the Hut.  As Grant grows, his opposition shrinks - eventually, there are less than a handful of individuals left to try and destroy him.  This includes local top cop Bill Pardy (Nathan Fillion), who has carried a torch for Starla since they were kids.  The whole story gets pretty ridiculous by the end, but you won't care because it's all so dadburned funny.  I give Fillion tons of credit for his performance.  Besides delivering some of the funniest one-liners, he injects the seriousness required to counterbalance the humor almost perfectly.  Without him, I don't think this film succeeds at all as a well-balanced horror comedy.  My favorite character by far, though, is Jack MacReady (Gregg Henry), the foul-mouthed mayor whose constant, profanity-laced grumbling never failed to make me laugh.

With so many badly written, unfunny horror comedies out there, it's refreshing to see something new come along and show just how effectively these two different genres can work together.  Writer-director James Gunn delivers big-time with Slither: hilarious dialogue, a veritable bounty of blood and guts, and even a tribute of sorts to many a classic horror film of the past.  I enjoyed the heck out of this movie.",1169164800,,3196,4.861367837338262

1568100,4,B00005JOUX,"I'm not going to go in to what the movie is about, because many people have already said that in these reviews already.

What I will review is the video itself. I really do appreciate the fact that many new movies are coming out with a 1.7/8x:1 aspect ratio (fills screen on hdtvs, no black bars.) True 2.3x:1 televisions could be another 20 years away, and so many newer and older movies are shot at in this aspect ratio.

2.3x:1 movies are actually recorded with the black bars encoded in them, with just slightly more resolution than let's say a letterbox movie. A letterbox movie is hard-coded with black bars larger than that of anamorphic widescreen dvds and hd dvds, at 4:3 aspect ratio. VHS, laserdiscs (with the exception of a hand full of titles near the end of the laserdisc era), and some dvds used the letterbox format, as opposed to anamorphic widescreen.

An example of 2.3/4x. 1 ratio movies are the star wars series, and 1.7/8:1 movies are this title (slither) and hell night.

Full Screen or Pan N Scan (4:3) = Stretched Image on hdtv.

Letterboxed w/2.3/4:1 movie (4:3) = Stretched Image on hdtv w/ black bars

Letterboxed w/1.7/8:1 movie (4:3) = Stretched Image on HDTV

Anamorphic 1.7/8:1 (16:9) = Stretched Image/Full Screen on hdtv

Anamorphic 2.3/4:1 (16:9) = Stretched Image/Black Bars

HD DVD at 1.7/8:1 (16:9) = Full Screen on hdtv

HD DVD at 2.3/4:1 (16:9) = Black Bars on HDTV

Let's talk about overall picture quality. I've read several reviews about the video quality on slither, which so many people think it is terrible. Yes, it's sort of in a b-movie style, and no, it's not King Kong quality, but it's still pretty good for what it is.

The flick itself is decent, worthy of watching, not to mention you get both the DVD version and HD DVD version on the same disc. This is a great HD DVD to add to your collection.",1168300800,,1850,4.589665653495441
1568101,3,B00005JOUX,"Writer/director James Gunn's fondness for fright flicks like Night of the Creeps is evident in Slither, one of those creatures-from-space-infest-humans-in-the-form-of-slithering-slugs-in-an-attempt-to-enslave-humanity-and-take-over-the-world movies.  Attempts at humor (not all of which are entirely successful) and doused in buckets of blood, some interesting special effects and a good performance from Nathon Fillion, Slither is a horror film for horror fans made by a horror fan.  It's fun, but ultimately lacking in that certain something that made the genre flicks it pays homage to had.

1568103,5,B00005JOUX,"I love horror movies- low budget, high budget, direct to video and in theater- I like them all. But because of this it takes a heck of a lot to actually impress me, rather than simply entertain me. Slither is easily the best horror movie to come along in more than 2 decades since we first saw Sam Raimi's brilliant Evil Dead. Yes, as a horror movie fan I know full well I am on the edge of committing sacrilege here, but trust me, there are many parallels.

Nathan Fillion is very much like Bruce Campbell, an undiscovered diamond. He has the good looks and charms to pull of the romantic lead with ease (Serenity and Firefly prove me right) but he also has perfect comedic timing, allowing him to break tention with a simple flick of his eyes or perfectly timed one-liner. Not only is his dialogue delicious, Fillion delivers it flawlessly.

The plot, script, directing, and editing (yes, even editing) contribute to the smooth flow of this movie, witch moves along at a perfect clip, dragging you forward with action and plot while letting you become invested in the lead characters. The dialogue is pure perfection ,only Fillion's dialogue, but everyone's dialogue.  You're laughing without being compromised on a good scary movie. The plot itself is part 50's drive in, part HP Lovecraft. I won't give any spoilers, just watch it!

Honestly, this movie gets my highest recommendations. I've seen thousands of horror movies, but only Evil Dead is this good. If I could give it higher than 5 stars, I would.",1167868800,2,1510,4.708333333333333

It starts out with some character drama that might make it feel to be a slow start, but it is always entertaining. Perhaps in a way, it is like The Fly (if the fly had a zombie army). The first infection occurs within the first 10 minutes of the film so I don't know that it can really be called a slow start.

The special features are a hoot (gag reel, Nathan Fillion tour set, who is Bill Pardy?). There's even a short cooking show on how to make fake blood.",1167696000,,585,4.0344827586206895
1568105,5,B00005JOUX,"Slither is the rare movie that succeeds in being what it set out to be.  An absolute superb blend of scares, gore (lots!), and laughs.  I laughed out loud, jumped, and cringed more than once.

The movie doesn't waste much time in character development.  It's not necessary.  The alien being (slugs, meat-devouring humans, zombies, etc.) is the story.  Elizabeth Banks as Starla, Nathan Fillion as Bill Pardy, and Michael Rooker as Grant Grant are great however.  Fillion's deadpan delivery left me in stitches.

I was very impressed by the special effects.  The gore is so over the top, but incredible.  Two scenes really stand out.  One is when one of the slugs tries to invade a young girl.  We see what is happening in her brain as the creature tries to take hold.  Very impressive.  The other is definitely the best disemboweling scene ever.

The part where the wolf attacked the guy was as fake as you could get. You could actually see that the wolf was stuffed with fake marble eyes, everything was very un-realistic and looked way too fake. I have seen several movies that have a fakeness about it to an extent but this movie took the cake of them all. More than anything this movie had two or three laughs and even a times where someone was dying you couldn't help but laugh. It was like everyone that would die it would be made out to be almost comedic in a sick way. The movie was kind of slow in the beginning and then picked up pace towards the middle but still had a very awkward feel to it.

1568148,4,B00005JOUX,"In general, horror films have gotten smarter in the past few years, but as the genre has become edgy, it has lost much of its humor.  There used to be a time when horror movies were both intelligent and funny.  SCREAM brought those types of movies back to life, but after all the copycatting of that particular franchise the industry forgot that a horror movie can both be intelligent and humorous.  There have been some exceptions, such as SHAUN OF THE DEAD, but overall scary movies just aren't very funny anymore and many of them in attempt to up the gore-factor have even lost what little wit they have had.

A fairly recent entry into the genre and one that attempts to rectify the situation is James Gunn's SLITHER.  Gunn worked his way up the ranks with Troma films and before now is best known for writing the SCOOBY-DOO films and the re-make of DAWN OF THE DEAD.  Gunn not only wrote SLITHER, but he also directed it.  The film is a homage to the action-horror films of the 1980s. It's witty and humorous.  There's also plenty of gore for those horror gore-hounds who judge a horror film based upon the amount of blood and guts shown.

The film takes place in the small and sleepy town of Wheelsy, N.C.  A meteorite from outer space lands unnoticed in a nearby forest with barely a thud (that's one of the many conventions that the film turns upside down).  The first half of the movie is full of back story and exposition.  That keeps the pace of the film during the first half somewhat slow, but that's okay.  Gunn is a filmmaker who knows what he's doing.  In order for a movie to be worthwhile, the audience has to connect with the main characters and the beginning of the film does a good job of establishing that relationship between the central characters and the audience.

A day after the tiny meteor landed in the forest, one of the town's wealthiest citizens, Grant Grant (Michael Rooker) finds himself walking through the forest with a woman he is contemplating committing adultery with.  He doesn't give into the temptation, however, because he loves his wife, Starla (Elizabeth Banks) far too much.  While in the forest Grant discovers a strange, slimy organism (can you say ALIEN?) and pokes it with a stick.  The organism opens up and shoots a spiny worm into Grant's body.  The worm is actually an alien from a world billions of miles away.  It crawls through Grant's body and plants itself in his brain, fusing itself with the mind and memories of Grant.  Grant returns home, but he begins acting strange.  He cries for the first time around his wife.  He has a strange craving to eat only meat.  He also has a strong urge to implant someone with his alien spawn.  Grant's body also begins to change.  At first it's very subtle, and Grant tells Starla he was stung by bees.  But, soon after, Starla discovers that Grant has turned their basement into a rotting meat locker and it becomes quite clear that there's something much worse wrong with Grant than just a simple bee sting after he tries to choke Starla and his arm turns into a lengthy appendage that would make Mr. Elastic jealous.  From that point the hunt is the local law enforcement attempt to hunt Grant down and find a kidnapped woman.  The alien that has taken over Grant is smarter than the average bear and he leads the would-be heroes into his lair where his wormy children are soon to be born.  Once the worms are loose, they begin entering people's mouths and turning them into flesh-eating zombies that are actually just extensions of the Grant Monster's collective mind.  It's the end of the world as we know it with just a bumbling sheriff, Grant's beautiful wife, the town sheriff, and a teenage girl standing in the way.

I really enjoyed watching SLITHER.  It's a horror film that is both smart and funny.  The film is a tribute to classic 80s action-horror films (references to these pictures abound in the movie from the name of the high school to character names to names of the town's stores), but is also a throwback, albeit more gory and intense, to the alien-horror movies of the 1950s and 1960s.  In lesser hands, the film could easily have been a trainwreck, but Gunn did an excellent job and brings everything together towards a satisfying conclusion.  I'm eager to see what Gunn will do next.

The DVD has several interesting features.  There are the usual deleted scenes and outtakes.  There's a feature commentary with Gunn and actor Nathan Fillion that is interesting as well as slightly informative.  There's short video diary by the guy who made the TOXIC AVENGER movies because he has a small cameo in the movie.  There are several behind the scenes featurettes as well as a special effects guy explaining how a person can make their own buckets of blood.  For such a small film, the features on the DVD are well worth the price and are equal to several classes of film school, the only thing missing is meeting the people in person and making some connections.",1166659200,,4982,4.608399545970488

This movie has all the great things good icky bug needs. Plenty of humor, gratuitous graphic gore, lots if icky bugs (of course), and the requisite sex scenes. What I really like is that the sex scenes were tame and did not detract from the story. So many times, we have to put up with the more graphic gratuitous sex that has absolutely nothing to do with the story. Some executive wants to sell more tickets so he makes the director throw in the naked breast or whatever. In this case, the sex was an integral part of the story and for once, was not overdone. I loved the dialogue, and the special effects were awesome. This movie does not take itself too seriously and I found that very appealing.

With plenty of funny moments to go with the gore, Slither did hold some homage to past horror flicks, Tremors included.  However, this movie takes the low road in some places.  The foul language is overly glorified and the gore is pretty nasty at times.  However, I still found it entertaining as hell.

The movie certainly puts it's roots in movies like `The Blob' and the classic zombie movies, but with a certain Science Fiction twist.  The Sci Fi part could certainly have been expanded into a much larger aspect of the movie but it was kept at a minimum for the sake of the story.

For a low budget movie the affects are very good and it has the potential of being a cult classic at the low end of the spectrum.  Writer/Director James Gunn knows his stuff and is obviously a fan of the genre.  His direction is clean and efficient.

A meteor looking like something from The Blob lands in the forest and something crawls out.  Successful businessman Grant Grant finds it and is stung.  The sting causes a change in Grant that causes a craving for meat.  An extramarital affair helps spread the infection to a young woman.  Grant keeps her locked up on a farm and feeds her tons of meat.  Meanwhile Grant continues to change and mutate.  Finally the police manage to locate the missing woman and Grant but their problems are only just beginning.

No sooner do the police arrive then birth is given to thousands of red slugs that crawl into people's mouths and infect them.  They spread toward the town.  People infected become zombies.  The zombies also seem to have Grant's memories.  An idea springs up among the few survivors and they set out to put a stop to the problem.  Can they stop the slugs and the mutant Grant before the whole planet is at risk?  You will have to watch the film to find out.

Rated R for violence and some sexuality, there is also some brief nudity.  The acting is above par for this type of movie.  Fans of the field will catch small tributes to many other horror/monster films.  My only real question is why don't they drive instead of walking at the end?  Who knows?  Hyped more than this type of movie usually is it deserves a bit.  A lot of familiar elements but they have been put together in new ways.

1568152,2,B00005JOUX,"Slither is the type of film you just hope will put a new director on the map and give our lead star of ""Firefly"" a chance to do some hero stuff as the next generation action star. Knowing that the director, Gunn, has had experience with Trauma productions and knows his genres well enough to make Slither a mix of ""Slugs"", ""From Beyond"", ""Videodrome"", ""The Faculty"", ""MIB"", ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" and ""Shawn of the Dead"", we would hope to be in for a surprise treat. While casting Michael Rooker as a bad guy was a great move unfortunately Slither doesn't do enough action which takes about an hour to get into. B-Movies are supposed to be hammy, but at times Slither does take itself too seriously at the wrong times and when it comes to being funny unfortunately just fails to crack the giggles that you thought you would be splirting out by this stage. When funny is considered a foul-mouthed mayor who curses ever other word Slither has only really got gore-for-laughs left going for it and apart from some memorable scenes, such as the psychic flashback of the alien conquering another lifeform in a distant galaxy, and the exploding fat women, there is not much in Slither that gets your attention and for many will remain a boring attempt to resurrect the B-movie horror genre. While certainly medals should be awared to all involved this doesn't seem all too different from the recent one star Australian horror budget movies that have done the rounds. High expectations are unfortunately not often rewarded and Slither is just another nail in the B-Movie horror coffin that died out in the 1980s. Better options would be to watch the films this one tries to spoof or better yet watch ""Shawn of the Dead"" which is heaps funnier or ""Firefly"" which has much better action.",1165881600,2,1788,4.697452229299363

It wasn't scary, it wasn't funny, it wasn't interesting.  HD DVD picture quality was decent, but noth breathtaking.  Not even worth renting.",1164412800,,417,4.736111111111111
1568154,4,B00005JOUX,"When Grant (Michael Rooker) is denied intercourse by his wife Starla (Elizabeth Banks), he goes out of the house and finds a former flame: Brenda (Brenda James). As they prepare to get it on, an odd-looking space rock injects him with a space virus. Grant's bizarre actions on his way home, such as the so-called ""teary-eyed"" face, touch Starla and they finally have sex. However, it doesn't last long when he eventually turns into a full-blown slug and terrorizes the town. Starla calls upon wise-cracking sheriff Bill Pardy (Nathan Fillion) and several other willing participants to help save the town before it's too late.

James Gunn is a mixed bag of a filmmaker. He wrote the screenplay for both ""Scooby Doo"" live-action motion pictures. Sadly, both of them were mauled by critics, who had to put up with over-the-top campiness, fart jokes a-plenty, and funny girl Sarah Michelle Gellar being an annoying B-I-T-C-H. But he redeemed himself with his screenplay for the 2004 remake of the George A. Romero classic ""Dawn of the Dead"". So, where does this young filmmaker go next? Enter ""Slither"".

The directorial debut of Gunn, ""Slither"" doesn't follow the formula of PG-13 rated horror clunkers like ""Stay Alive"" and ""When a Stranger Calls"". Instead, it pours on authentic scares, blood and guts, and wry comedy that other directors fail to bother adding to their rancid work. Mind you, if you expect fart jokes and annoying dames, you will either be disappointed or surprised.

There are a lot of shocking scenes: Starla continuously pounds a zombie with a pole repeatedly, a citizen split in half and his guys spilling out, a bloated Brenda explodes and slugs crawl out, a mother vomits blood, a lot of racy female comments, and a very funny joke that one of the creatures looking like something that falls off a man's penis. I bet you can't top that.

There aren't many big-named stars in this movie, but it's offset by some really good performances that these people make. Fillion brings his off-color commentary from ""Serenity"", now with a Southern accent and profanity that Browncoats (aka ""Firefly"" fans) will be shocked to hear. Banks, fresh from her comic turn in ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"", pulls a 180 with plenty of sex appeal (for horny males, she's often in her bra and panties in this movie), sympathy, and a Souther drawl that would make Reese Witherspoon reconsider her Academy Award win. And Michael Rooker, as Starla's husband, brings down the roof with a deliciously over-the-top performance.

It's a shame that this movie (and ""ATL"") didn't break box office records when it came out. But it's a humdinger of a slasher film that does not carry the labor of a PG-13 rating which made an onslaught of teen slasher films disappoint at the theaters. Plus, it's funny and really ballsy at times. And this is coming from the screenwriter of ""Scooby Doo"". If this is a sign of things to come for James Gunn, then horror films can get back to the R-rated thrills that the genre is known for.",1164412800,4,3006,4.840466926070039

Maybe it was my low expectations, but i enjoyed this movie immensely. I found this movie to be absolutely hilarious! It was obvious that the movie was supposed to be campy and cheesey from the get-go and completely tongue-in-cheek. There were a few ""gross"" moments but those, too, for me held a comedic overtone.

In my mind this movie doesn't qualify as a horror film, becuase it's not scary in the slightest, but as a sci-fi action/comedy.

Ever since I saw ""Serenity"" at the movies, and then started watching the TV series ""Firefly"" I have been a big fan of Nathan Fillion.  He is brilliant in this movie too.

The premise is nothing better than the usual 80s horror flick, but that is part of its charm.  The effects are gross, the ""heros"" are scared, the monsters are slimy.  What more could you ask for?

Well the answer to that is you want to be entertained.  ""Slither"" is a movie which does entertain.",1163548800,,652,4.193548387096774
1568189,3,B00005JOUX,"With a cast loaded with third-tier stars and up-and-comers such as the ever-reliable Michael Rooker, Nathan Fillion, Elizabeth Banks, Gregg Henry and Tania Saulnier and a writing/directing crew raised on Troma Pictures and cheesy 70's/80's gore flicks, you'd expect ""Slither"" to be both funny and vomit-inducing.  It's got the vomit-inducing part down, but the ""funny"" falls a little bit short of expectations.

The story is a rehash (or homage) of a ton of old gore flicks.  An alien craft crashes in small town Wheelsy, South Carolina.  Said craft contains an alien parasite who latches onto the first unlucky bumpkin to stumble upon it (Michael Rooker).  It then goes about impregnating another bumpkin to spawn even more splatter-happy creatures.  These creatures are all mentally connected with the alpha alien and they systematically begin to take over the town.  All the while a bumbling sheriff (Fillion), a saucy sidekick (Banks), and an unlikely hero (Saulnier) come together and devise a plan to destroy the alien.  Sounds very formulaic, but that's part of the humor of this flick.

The cast does a very good job with what they have to work with.  Especially Rooker, who's character actually garners the sympathy of the audience.  It's a tragic love story not unlike ""Dracula.""  However, this story plays out under the guise of ""Dawn of the Dead,"" ""Critters,"" ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" and ""Shaun of the Dead,"" among other horror flicks.

The entire story, from character names to local stores, is an homage to old horror flicks.  That's a nice touch, but the story's humor doesn't keep up to par with the gore.

I will say that the DVD is spectacular, including the standard commentary, deleted scenes, gags, etc. and a few unique features such as a segment which teaches the viewer how to make home-made blood.

It's all done with very good intentions, but it comes off as a bloated SciFi channel Saturday Scinema flick.  In fact, I expect to see this film ending up on SciFi before the end of the year.  Fans of gore will appreciate all of the nods to older flicks.  Fans of ""Firefly"" will be happy to see Fillion once again.  Unfortunately, ""Slither"" just isn't worth a purchase in my book.  Better films to buy would include any of the aforementioned titles, as well as any of the ""Evil Dead"" flicks for those who enjoy humor in their horror.",1163462400,3,2366,4.865
1568190,5,B00005JOUX,"There is an audio commentary by writer/director James Gunn and actor Nathan Fillion. They get right into the origins of the movie and what films influenced him, namechecking the usual suspects: Sam Raimi, David Cronenberg and John Carpenter. The director also recounts numerous filming anecdotes and challenges he faced as a first-time director. Fillion's dry humour comes through as he comments on his performance with self-deprecating wit. The two men deliver a chatty, engaging track that is a lot of fun to listen to.

There is a ""Gag Reel"" featuring cast members blowing lines, props not working properly and some extreme flatulence.

Also included are eight deleted scenes with optional commentary by Gunn. He points out production difficulties (like weather) that plagued some of these scenes. He also puts them in context with the rest of the movie and talks about why they had to be cut (i.e. iffy staging, slowed down the pacing or just didn't work).

""Visual Effects: Step by Step"" is a montage showing the various stages for the CGI effects in a few scenes with music.

""Slithery Set Tour with Nathan Fillion"" is a featurette that has the actor take us backstage with a camera as he has fun messing with cast and crew members. Everyone goofs around in this amusing extra.

Also included are four extended scenes with optional commentary by Gunn. Not surprisingly, these scenes were trimmed because they ran too long. He talks about how they faired with test screenings and why they are better in their shortened form in the movie.

""Who is Bill Pardy?"" is a montage of outtakes where the phrase, ""I'm Bill Pardy,"" is said again and again in some kind of cast and crew in-joke. We also see what various cast and crew members ""really"" think about Fillion.

""The Sick Minds and Slimy Days of Slither."" Gunn wanted to bring back the gory, over-the-top monster movies from the `80s. To this end, he put in countless references to horror films from this decade and takes us through the casting process.

""The Gorehound Grill: Brewin' Blood"" is a step-by-step tutorial on how to make authentic-looking fake blood. This is a great idea and these kinds of how-to's should be included on more horror movie DVDs.

""Bringing Slither's Creatures to Life"" takes a look at how Gunn wanted to go back to prosthetic monsters as opposed to the current trend of predominantly CGI. So, he decided to mix the two together.

""The King of Cult: Lloyd Kaufman's Video Diary."" Kaufman is the President of Troma Entertainment and the director of all three Toxic Avenger movies. Tromeo and Juliet (1996) was Gunn's first feature film screenplay made into a movie and as thanks had Kaufman do a cameo in Slither.

""Slither"" never aspires to being anything other than an over-the-top gore fest wit a lot of tongue-in-cheek humor.  After a meteor crashes (right behind an unaware police cruiser), red, slimy slugs start crawling around seeking human mouths.  Of course, they gestate and the poor victims turn into George Romero type zombies that spit deadly poison.  The first to get infected is the richest and horniest guy in town, but his wife has a headache.  He infects others by impaling them with two slimy hose-like spikes (you have to have two to get infected, ya know).  Its sex and gore zombie-ism combined.  Pretty soon the whole town is sex starved and infecting each other.  The good guy sheriff comes to the rescue with the rich guys wife after many a tight squeeze and lots of thrilling near misses.  With more than enough clever lines and gruesome site gags, these folks bring on a fantastically guts filled splatter-filled ending that's creepy and disgustingly sexy all at once.

1568193,2,B00005JOUX,"I think this film wants to make you vomit. I don't know about you, but that is not a quality I am looking for in my films. Being scared is fine; being in suspense is great, vomiting is not. I really think that is what this film was going for. It has some pretty disgusting moments. While I was watching it I kept feeling this retching feeling at the back of my throat during certain scenes. In fact, I am feeling it now as I write this review and think about the movie.

The story runs like this: A meteor falls to earth. It has an alien life in it which shoots into people and uses them as an incubation device. This of course means then when the aliens decide to hatch out of incubation...well its not a pretty picture as you may imagine. In the meantime the people who have aliens incubating inside them turn into rotting-corpse looking creatures, or in the case of the head alien, just a big pile of disgustingness.

The idea itself isn't a bad one, and its executed in a relatively skillful way. In fact, the idea is much more original than many other horror movies. But as I said before, it's just too disgusting to be really enjoyable. This movie was confused as to whether it wanted to be a comedy or a horror and while it was trying to figure that out it failed in both categories.",1162857600,,1290,4.261224489795918
1568194,4,B00005JOUX,"The goofy writer/director James Gunn, who wrote the well-received remake of DAWN OF THE DEAD (2004), longed to hearken back to them 1980s horror flicks and their over-the-top gory sensibilities. Thus, SLITHER. So if this modest horror offering reminds you somewhat of RE-ANIMATOR, THE FLY, THE BLOB, THE EVIL DEAD trilogy, and John Carpenter's THE THING, then Mr. Gunn considers his task gleefully accomplished. SLITHER, a film about alien invasion of the slimiest ilk, is ickily grotesque, somewhat terrifying, and very tongue-in-cheek. The make-up, puppeteering, prosthetics, and CGI are very, very nice and the horror sequences will sometimes make you jump, but, honestly, the modern horror audience is by now so de-sensitized by the proliferation of cinematic shockfests that it's gonna take a lot more to elicit honest gasps of fright. But, having said that, SLITHER will make the viewer appreciate its efforts.

The humor is, of course, the movie's saving grace, is what makes SLITHER stand out from other, more solemn splatter-flicks. The comedy meshes nicely with the storyline, is never forced, but surfaces naturally thru the situations that arise. Of course, it helps that Nathan Fillion, with his mastery of the tight-lipped one-liner, and Gregg Henry, with his verbal diarrhea of profanity, seem to be naturally funny people. You could tell, in the special features segments, how much these cats, as well as the rest of the cast, liked to laugh.

SPOILERS RIGHT HERE!! Plot breakdown: The outskirts of hicksville Wheelsy is the site of a meteorite crash one quiet evening, an event that somehow goes unnoticed by the redneck citizenry. Grant Grant (Michael Rooker), after being spurned by his wife Starla (Elizabeth Banks) for the night, goes into the woods with a chippie he picks up at a bar. But Grant Grant's devotion to his wife makes him have second thoughts about cheating, and, instead, he is diverted by a gross thing he espies on the ground. Of course, the usual happens and Grant Grant becomes infected and soon is hungering for MEAT and undergoing some pretty gruesome changes. In due time, the Grant monster feels the need to procreate and impregnates a woman who later spews out a crapload of moist, speedy, little red slugs that, in turn, slurp into the mouths of the Wheelsy denizens and zombiefy them. These slugs have a direct connection to Grant Grant; thus, whatever they and their hosts see is channeled right back to the Grant monster. Anyways, it's ultimately left up to four people to save the world: Sheriff Bill Pardy (the great Nathan Fillion), Starla Grant (who Pardy has been crushing on for years), the vulgarian mayor Jack MacReady (Gregg Henry), and teenager Kylie (Tania Saulnier).

Because this is supposed to be a B-movie homage, director James Gunn didn't want any A-listers in the cast (besides, it was doubtful if he could've gotten any). The complement of actors he handpicks, while falling somewhere in the B-list category, is energetic, committed, and, yep, perfectly cast. Nathan Fillion, who I hope will do more movies, eschews his wry, no-nonsense Firefly hero/captain, Mal Reynolds, and signs on here as a less competent, but still wry, small-town sheriff who, while out of his depth, nevertheless, attempts to do the right thing. Sexy Elizabeth Banks (SEABISCUIT, SPIDER-MAN films) is lovely and sweet and you could see why a cavalcade of one-minded zombies in love, instead of craving her flesh as a snack, would rather play footsies with her. Michael Rooker is here and I chuckle at the making-of segment, wherein it's revealed that the writer/director fawns on Rooker and thinks of him as some kind of an acting demi-god (please, it's Michael Rooker! He's the guy that takes the roles Michael Madsen's turned down). Lastly, Gregg Henry, Gregg Henry, Gregg Henry! I laughed my you-know-what off every time this scene-stealing guy opened his mouth. Please, someone just hand him a Mr. Pibb already.

The pleasingly loaded and profanity-laced (but hilarious) DVD special features offer up:

- a robust Feature Commentary by director James Gunn and actor Nathan Fillion
- ""The Sick Minds and Slimy Days of SLITHER"": the behind-the-scenes featurette
- Gag Reel
- ""Who is Bill Pardy?"": a wink-in-the-eye segment on Nathan Fillion
- Extended Scenes: with optional commentary by James Gunn
- Deleted Scenes - with optional commentary by James Gunn
- ""Slithery Set Tour with Nathan Fillion"" - they gave Fillion a camera and let him run loose on the set
- ""Visual Effects: Step by Step"" - progression of several special effects scenes shown in stages
- ""Bringing SLITHER's Creatures to Life"" - 18-minute segment about the monster f/x
- ""The King of Cult: Lloyd Kaufman's Video Diary"" - a few minutes spent with the president of Troma Entertainment and director of TOXIC AVENGER
- ""The Gorehound Grill: Brewin' the Blood"" - an f/x mini-course on how to make fake blood, using home ingredients.

In addition to the 1980s horror films, there's also a touch of KING KONG here, manifested in the doomed love story of Starla and the lonely billions-of-years-old monster. So, turns out, there's nothing new in SLITHER. All the token horror criterias are met, the usual cliched sequences touched upon. But, here, it's not a bad thing. When comfortable derivativeness is partnered with panache, competent f/x, a decent plot, and earthy humor, well, it becomes very palatable, indeed. 4 stars for this very fun ickfest.",1162684800,3,5461,5.068965517241379
1568195,4,B00005JOUX,"Feels something slimy crawling up your back? Don't scream! It wants to get into your mouth and take over your body. These reddish slug-like creatures crash landed in a small grove near a hick town in the U.S. and, unfortunately, Chief of Police Bill Pardy (Nathan Fillion, SERENITY) didn't notice right away. The meteorite carrying these interstellar parasites lands right behind his police car one night.

Bill Pardy is too occupied with his infatuation for Starla (Elizabeth Banks, THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN), a woman now married to a wealthy townsman named Grant (Michael Rooker, DAYS OF THUNDER). Pardy pines away for Starla, but he's soon forced to deal with something far more important: saving the Earth.

Starla's husband, Grant, is ""infected"" by the first of these creatures and begins changing both mentally and physically. He needs meat. Any kind of meat. Dog. Possum. Cow. Human. He must grow. And he does grow ...into a hideous human-slug hybrid that has to find a mate that'll give birth to thousands more of the slug invaders. He finally meets up with an unfortunate soul and ""impregnates"" her then locks her away in a barn, feeding her local varments and making her grow to unheard of pregnant proportions.

Once Grant's impregnated human ""pops"", the slugs rapidly travel through the countryside, looking for humans. Once they catch up with them, the slugs enter through their mouths and take over the human host, thus turning them into a sort of zombie starving for meat.

Bill Pardy must destroy the main creature, Grant, before he's able to take over the entire town. All of the little slugs are now a smaller piece of Grant's consciousness and he sees whatever one of his little sluggers sees, giving him millions of eyes and perspectives.

That James Gunn (screenwriter for DAWN OF THE DEAD, 2004) did SLITHER is no big surprise. His zombie-esque, interstellar, slug-infested hometown citizens ring familiar with a sort of INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS theme.

Nathan Fillion does an outstanding job as the calm yet determined police chief. That he delivers some excellent comedic lines in the midst of terrible events only added an extra punch to the story (""We'll just say that I saved you instead of the other way around, okay?"")

Special gore effects are carried out perfectly by Joe Colwell as we see Michael Rooker go through his disgusting transformation, and watch the slugs forcibly enter a multitude of mouths. Gross!

The one major flaw with the film is that it simply isn't that original. Parallels to the aforementioned Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Dawn of the Dead are easily apparent. But the characters are excellent and the script strong. Fierce dialogue mixed with dark humor keep the story moving at a great pace (the entire film is only 95 minutes).

I was also surprised to see how poorly this did at the box-office, 8 million made with a 16 million price-tag, ouch, not so good. But, i just gotta say how amazing the make-up effects are, they really did a impressive job. There are two major monsters in Slither, one is the 'Brenda Monster' who gives birth to all the worms (she is the incredibly fat one in the previews with her little head sticking out) and then the 'Grand Monster' at the end who's body takes on a whole house and most of the towns population. Be sure and watch the special features, the number of materials and goo they went through to make this movie is nothing short of a miracle.

Nathan Fillion from Serenity plays our hero, the police captain. He, as usual, is in top form and really drops the one liners well. Also Michael Rooker plays Grand, the unfortunate man who first comes in contact with our meteor/aliens, and he too is very good. The rest of the cast is ok, our leading lady is rather bland, but very pretty.

Slither is a B movie Horror satire. It's kind of like The Blob meets Night of the Living Dead meets Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Scary at times. Funny at times.

It's a good movie. But if you walk away from Slither with a 5 star experience, man, a movie like Pulp Fiction or, sticking more closely to the genre, Predator must send you into fits of ecstasy.

I won't give away any of the plot details.  I hate spoilers, and theres enough written about the actual plot on this board already.  I'll just say that ""Slither"" is sick, twisted, and perverted, and just plain gross.  I loved it!  I was absolutely floored by this movie.  Fans of H.P. Lovecrat will also be pleased with this film.  Like ""In the Mouth of Madness"" and ""Alien"", the best ""Lovecraft"" films are the ones that aren't actually adapted from a specific story.",1161907200,,1260,4.4605263157894735
1568256,4,B00005JOUX,"Okay I didn't mean the part about where it's for the whole family lol. I did mean the fun part though. Well you will have fun if you don't easily get sick to your stomach that is. It's about slimy creatures that come from a host named Grant who gets infected in the beginning. He's well played by Michael Rooker (Cliffhanger). Elizabeth Banks plays his sexy wife that sheriff Pardy (Nathan Fillion) regrets not getting with when he was younger. When other people get infected they act like Grant because they have his memories and feelings. Since the creatures came from him.

  Since this is from the writer of the bloody fun Dawn of the Dead don't expect the film to be like Gremlins or Eight Legged Freaks. Yes it has humor but it's creepy and scary at times too. This is a well made creature feature. I like the cast too. Nathan Fillion who showed in FireFly, Buffy season 7 and Serenity that he's a king of one liners. He's a bit of a limited actor but as long as he has his one-liners and his character has a sense of humor the guy is a hell of a lot of fun.",1161820800,,1064,4.231527093596059

1568258,1,B00005JOUX,"I watched Slither right after watching the movie Rest Stop.  Strangely enough, I found Rest Stop to be far more entertaining and disturbing than this movie.  I was a bit surprised to find out that this movie was suppose to be a ""horror comedy"" when I didn't find it funny at all.  Then again, maybe it is because I don't find South Park humor to be that funny either.  Yes I realize this was suppose to, in a bit of a way, to be a take off and a wink-wink toward the 50s and 60s horror (i.e. Body Snatchers).  But the movie didn't work well for me at all.  The characters were boring.  The gore was pointless.  There was not a thing funny about the action and interactions.  To be honest, I found myself fast forwarding through some parts, other parts I just read a book through waiting for something...anything...to happen that might catch my eyes.  Sadly, nothing occurred.  Rest Stop, which is a secondary movie, a movie that went direct to DVD from what I can tell, is far better at presenting a story, at presenting horror and gore, than Slithers ever will.  Sigh.  I wasted money at the DVD store on this one.",1161820800,3,1115,4.380487804878049
1568259,4,B00005JOUX,"I'm not as big on horror-comedies as your average horror buff.  I like 'em and all, but I tend to consider most of the hallmarks of the sub-subgenre to be merely good rather than brilliant. (i.e. Dead Alive, Evil Dead II, Re-Animator, Return of the Living Dead etc.)  My general problem is that I'm just pretty damn picky when it comes comedy though I'm severely indiscriminate when it comes to horror, so I suppose it evens out.  Ultimately, I would prefer that most horror-comedies take themselves a bit more seriously.  Not necessarily enough to make them truly horrific, ya know, but enough to make it so that there some actual drama to the violence and whatnot instead of just slapstick.  Anyway, 'Slither' stands out a bit in the style because it finds a better balance of horror and humor.  Now, I don't think anyone is going to be genuinely scared, much less terrified, by 'Slither', nor does the film take itself seriously, but it's not an utter farce either.  (i.e. sometimes, when it looks like a character might be killed, you are somewhat concerned.)  Furthermore, the humor here is more to my taste than you'd find in your average horror comedy, more witty dialog and less physical and visual stuff.  Beyond this, it's got some nice gore and fun fx as well as some relatively appealing characters, so it's definitely worth a look for any horror fan.

You've heard the setup plenty of times before: An asteroid containing an alien organism lands near a small rural town late one night.  The alien proves somewhat less than hospitable and proceeds to take control of and kill the townspeople, all presumably in preparation for further, more sinister conquests.  A small group of civilians discovers what is going on and must fight back to save the world etc.  Plus we've got some of your standard characters: the corrupt mayor, the previously indifferent cop who must rise to the occasion, the young, beautiful and innocent looking heroine and so on.  As with many of these movies, ""Slither"" hasn't got much in the way of original ideas, but it's got the wit and energy and panache to make the old clichs fun once again.  The performances generally have a pleasant haminess to them, but w/o turning into the wildly overblown caricatures that often dominate this kind of film.  (And while the characters tend to be stereotypes they're somewhat more affectionate than they might've been.)  Nathan Fillion is the particular standout as the cop Bill Pardy, who is pretty much the same as his character in Firefly/Serenity, though perhaps a bit less dour, and w/o a space ship.  His dialogue isn't nearly as witty as it is in those other things, but it's not bad by any means, and Fillion knows just how to play this kind of reluctant hero.  I also like Gregg Henry as the slimy mayor.  This role is another one that's often screwed up, but Henry makes him appealingly slimy, and even a bit sympathetic at times.  Elizabeth Banks plays Starla, the heroine, and she's appealing enough, not too mention hot.

""Slither"" is low-budget by modern standards at 15.5 mil, but that sum allows it to have production values miles away from what you'd find in the films that inspired it, so it's generally very slick and well put together.  It's pretty fx heavy for a moderately budgeted film with plenty of gooey slugs, zombies and a few giant, tentacled monsters.  Occasionally the fx does falter, particularly during the climax, but this isn't the sorta film that's gonna be killed by some cheesy fx, of course.  ""Slither"" isn't any gorefest, but it's got some effective moments, though they're weakened by being poorly digitally inserted into the scenes at times.  It's also got plenty of slime, goo and slug related grossout stuff, if that's your bag.  I also like how ""Slither"" actually has a lot of different creatures/antagonists.  Lotsa movies lose there impact cause you see the same damn monster again and again, but ""Slither"" mixes it up very nicely.

Hmm, dunno how much more I've gotta say.  This is just a cool, well-paced horror-comedy.  It's never outrageously funny, and it's not scary either, but it's definitely a fun pastiche/homage.  Check it out.

1568260,4,B00005JOUX,"There should be more movies like Slither.  Seriously.  Most horror movies take themselves seriously to the point of self-parody, and those that try to mix comedy with horror rarely come out on top with a few exceptions (Dead Alive and Shaun of the Dead were spctacular).  Slither, from Troma veteran James Gunn who also wrote the surprisingly good remake of Dawn of the Dead, is a goofy, gorey treat that gets the formula right for the most part, thanks to it's gross out effects, superb makeup, and great cast, while paying homage to past horror films, most notably the 80's blast Night of the Creeps.  Michael Rooker stars as an unlucky breeding ground for intergalactic slugs that soon run amok in a small town and turn their hosts into hungry zombies.  Nathan Fillion (from Firefly and Serenity) stars as the sheriff who is in over his head, Elizabeth Banks is Rooker's terrified wife, and Gregg Henry is a blast as the foul mouthed mayor; all of whom play pivotal roles in Gunn's exercise of gross out gags.  Though it loses some steam as it winds down, Slither is a delightful horror treat that long time fans of the genre should appreciate.",1161734400,,1147,4.681592039800995
1568271,4,B00005JOUX,"""Slither"" is the horror movie that I have been waiting for. Is it overly scary? Not really, but how many horror movies are? What ""SLiTHER"" does is, in a way, pay homage to the horror movies of the 80's. That whole campy horror/comedy appeal that has made movies such as ""Evil Dead"", ""Fright Night"", ""Vamp"", ""Dead Alive"" etc. favorites amongst horror fans favorites.

While the idea behind ""SLiTHER"" isn't extremely original (think ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" meets ""Night of the Living Dead""), it not only pays its respects to those types of movies, but in slight ways, makes fun of them the way ""Shaun of the Dead"" did the Romero zombie flicks.

1568273,4,B00005JOUX,"I've been waiting for a handful of movies from the 80s to come out on DVD and one of those was a little gem with no stars called NIGHT OF THE CREEPS. I absolutely loved it when I was in high school. Aliens crash land in 1950s America and spread like a virus through the community in the form of large wormlike leachs that dives into people's mouths and turns them into zombies. It was just a well done movie that was never, throughout the entire movie, uninteresting.

So, when I saw that SLITHER was coming out, I was disappointed and excited in the same breath. No, it wasn't NIGHT OF THE CREEPS, but it looked similar. A remake? Something similar?  More something similar than remake, SLITHER was not a disappointment.

Although the theme was the same, the comedy was prominent and the wormlike leaches were again on the loose, I wouldn't call SLITHER a remake. It was a whole other direction, and a pleasant one... if you like blood, guts, more guts, shocks and more shocks and some tongue and cheek comedy mixed in... SLITHER is the movie for you.

NATHAN FILLION plays Bill Pardy, a small town sheriff who unknowningly finds himself in the biggest mess this side of hell. As the virus like worms destroy everything and everyone they come in contact with... feeding, growing and craving more and more, the town becomes more and more void of life and the blood splattering insanity boils over.

SLITHER is a horror movie lovers dream, and is in the same note, a great comedy. I wouldn't recommend this to the queasy, but if your not, go along for the SLITHER ride.",1161561600,,1568,4.546099290780142
1568274,4,B00005JOUX,"James Gunn is a genius in scriptwriting, and he is a very rare species

of people making it in the Hollywood scene without selling out. His

scripts always show his true sense of humor and cynicism. He always

puts a lot of Troma in there. Before Directing and writing Slither he

wrote a number of highly successful theatrical hits, and he managed to

make even Scooby Doo highly enjoyable and even did the impossible by

writing an absolutely amazing script for the remake of absolute classic

amongst classics of horror-films Dawn of the Dead - something me and

many others always thought of as being totally impossible.

However brilliant, none of Gunn's scripts, including Slither, although

it comes close, are as GENIUS as the first one he ever wrote to be made

in a film: Tromeo and Juliet, directed by Lloyd Kaufman (with Gunn as

assistant director). Although not selling out, is it clear that all

films for larger studio's need some concessions here and there, while

Tromeo and Juliet has none of that, and truly shows Gunns genius

without any restrictions (and it is, incidentally available on a tenth

anniversary double disc, with huge contributions of James Gunn

himself!!). All this said I can only conclude that Slither is a

fantastic film, with a script as good as or maybe even better than his

DAWN remake, and with it James Gunn shows he is perfect for directing

his own work, because the film as a whole is far better than DAWN. An

absolute must see, must have.

film-legend Lloyd Kaufman, who has a cameo in Slither.",1161302400,,1615,4.73021582733813

Slither may not be groundbreaking but it is a rarity: a horror-comedy that does both its genre-parents proud. You just have to take it for what it is.  Guilty pleasure entertainment.  I just happened to go see Slither at the box office on a whim one Saturday night, and found myself loving this film. It was a hidden classic.",1159574400,5,611,4.541284403669724
1568277,1,B00005JOUX,"This could well be the worst film I have ever seen. I don't say that lightly, because I love films and movie stars. Movies rarely get one star from me. Movies also don't go back to the store but with 'Slither' I had to make an exception. It went back to the store. I rewrapped it in plastic and the blue seal preventing it being returned was untouched. I can say with absolute certainty that no other movie deserves it more then 'Slither'. Granted I am not a horror fan and have never professed to be one. I have seen the 'Scream' trilogy, and enjoyed the films 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' and the sequel 'I Still Know What You Did Last Summer'. I've also seen 'Wolf Creek' and 'Hard Candy'. I'd much rather watch a love story then blood and guts going everywhere. This movie gives new meaning to the word disgusting. It is totally sick and full of blood and gore. I don't mind a little blood, but this really goes out of it's way to be vile and tasteless. It also uses puppets and while Jim Henson was not involved in this futile venture I just know he'd be appalled at the results of this film. I did watch this film right through, and the special features. I'm really glad though that I can add this movie to my list of one star films.

The cover looks lovely a bit like 'American Beauty'. The way the red creatures surround the bath. It looks like red roses surrounding Mena Suvari. That is a film of quality and 'Slither' is anything but quality. The attractive cast could not even save this film. From the preview I saw of Elizabeth Banks on the pillow it looked a little like Leighton Meester was in this movie. She thankfully is not. Leighton is a wonderful actress and I'm so pleased she is not in this film or was ever considered for it. I also saw the cover with the naked leg in the bath. It looks tempting, but don't even bother.

My Mum thought the film could be like the creature in the film 'Dreamcatcher' based on the Stephen King novel. I'm happy to say they are nothing alike. I am a 'Firefly'/ 'Serenity' fan but Nathan Fillion could not convince me to keep this. He has a wonderful line in the film that perfectly describes this film, but I won't repeat it here because it is unnecessary. Those who have seen the film and enjoyed it will be able to recall it. This film is a waste of time and good film. Flush the disc down the toilet or better yet save your money. If you want to see a good use of human waste see 'Kenny'.  It too might not be five star material, but it will come a lot closer to a five star rating then this film ever will. I was exstatic to have 'Slither' released from my grip.

1568278,4,B00005JOUX,"Some though by no means all of the reviewers seem to be missing the main point of this film:  it is a comic parody of creature and zombie horror films.  And a very good parody it is.  There is some horror, some suspense, and they do want to scare you at points, but mainly they want to make you laugh.  I'm sure James Gunn and the others involved in the project would be disappointed if they didn't scare the viewer from time to time, but they would be crushed if they didn't make you laugh at least a little.

Like a number of people, I watched this for two reasons.  First, I loved Nathan Fillion from his work on FIREFLY and SERENITY, and frustrated by the paucity of films featuring him, saw him in one of the few things he has been in.  I'm happy to report that he is superb in it.  Some outlets have described him as the next Bruce Campbell.  While that would not be an entirely bad thing, I hope he can get more mainstream roles than Campbell, the king of B pictures, has gotten.  Second, I saw this because word of mouth.  Most critics and everyday viewers have had good things to say about it.  I completely agree with those viewers and critics.  It isn't a masterpiece, but you could definitely describe it as a great example of its genre, the horror parody.  It compares well with other films like it, the most famous being, of course, Sam Raimi's EVIL DEAD films and ARMY OF DARKNESS.

In addition to Fillion's strong performance in the lead as the town sheriff, I really enjoyed Elizabeth Bank's job.  She is someone I've seen in a number of small roles, but could enjoy seeing in more.  I loved the way she played across genre type in this one.  Most horror female leads tend to be rather weak, but Bank's Starla is close to fearless and you have to admire her sheer gumption.  She may be familiar to fans of SCRUBS as the character who gave JD such shocking news at his front door in the Season Five finale.  Fans of FIREFLY will remember that Gregg Henry, who does a great comic job as the foul-mouthed and obscene town mayor, and Nathan Fillion appeared together on that show in the episode ""Train Job.""  Henry played the town sheriff in that one.  Fans of THE OFFICE will recognize in the receptionist in the sheriff's office as the receptionist in that series, though Jenna Fischer has achieved far greater success in Scranton.

Director/Writer James Gunn is someone I'll be paying attention to in the future.  For a low budget film he did a great job of creating something that is fun, interesting, and always compelling, if sometimes a bit gross.  There are many truly funny moments, including an hysterical bit where the sheriff has a fight with a possessed deer.

If you want to see a horror film, I definitely suggest that you look elsewhere.  If you want to see an unusual and unique comedy, give this a try.  But be warned, it frequently comes close to crossing the line on gross.  But also be warned, you will laugh.",1158796800,7,2943,4.428305400372439

Nathan Fillion, of Firefly fame, plays the lead role of the sherriff, and does a damn good job. My one annoyance is that this role is almost exactly like his role in Firefly, and he plays it the same way - possible typecasting of himself? The other characters, short of the girl, are nicely introduced and rounded out, making you care about them.

1568326,5,B00005JOUX,"Slither (James Gunn, 2006)

I have to admit, James Gunn has really impressed me in recent years. Despite beginning his career as a stable boy for the moronic (at best) Troma, since branching out on his own, he's dome some fine, fine work-- first writing the screenplay for Zack Snyder's surprising Dawn of the Dead remake, then coming up with the highly underrated mockumentary LolliLove. Now, he turns his attention back to comedy/horror with Slither, but worry not-- all traces of Troma seem to have left his system.

Slither is everything you liked about brainless eighties horror-comedies, and nothing you didn't. The movie has gotten (surprisingly) some of the best reviews of the year, and has certainly garnered the closest thing to unanimous praise from critics of any movie that's popped up yet in 2006; it's all warranted. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll remember why on Earth you found yourself loving movies like C. H. U. D. 2: Bud the Chud and Ghoulies.

Grant Grant (Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer's wonderful Michael Rooker-- great to see him back on camera) and his wife Starla (Seabiscuit's Elizabeth Grant) are not your typical husband and wife. Well, maybe they are; Starla married Grant as a way to get herself some respectability. He paid for her education, etc. And now their marriage is on the rocks. After a fight, Grant storms off to the local bar, where he runs into Brenda (The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants' stunning Brenda James), and the two of them stumble off into the woods to do things that married folk simply shouldn't do. They get sidetracked, however, by a slime trail leading away from a meteor. They find the thing that left the slime trail. It attacks Grant. If you've seen a single eighties alien-invasion horror flick, you probably know what's coming next.

Much of the criticism surrounding the film-- what little there has been-- has centered around the word ""derivative."" And, sure, there are elements of any number of eighties horror films here, most notably the brilliant cult flick Night of the Creeps. But to call it derivative is simply silly; one of the best things about Slither is that Gunn knew exactly what he was doing, both while writing the script and behind the camera. It's useless ripping off a film that nine-tenths of your projected audience has already seen. He's paying homage, folks. (And if the Night of the Creeps reference was the only one you caught, do you really know enough about eighties horror to be making such pronouncements?)

A lot of the American horror films that have come out over the last few years-- and I include even the best of the lot in this estimation-- have either tried too hard to be high art, or have been brainless remakes (or, worse, both). Slither gets us away from all that. It wants nothing more than to be a stupid, silly horror-comedy. With a good stable of actors, a terrific script, and competent direction, it delivers in spades. Slither is, quite simply, one of the best American horror films of the past two decades. See it. **** ?",1145577600,11,3048,4.787072243346008

There are odes to other movies like ""Night of the Creeps"" and George Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"" but ""Slither"" manages to stand on it's own and be a very great horror movie.  An alien plague arrives in a small town and starts infecting people most notably Grant Grant (Michael Rooker, horror and movie veteran). His metamorphosis into the huge ugly boss monster near the end is incredible and gross.

His minions which include alien slugs infect the town folk and transform them into alien zombies all the while they spit out pollutants into anyone in their path. Elizabeth Banks is
great as Starla Grant who witnesses her husband turn into a monster. She is terrific in this. Gregg Henry is also good in this although he serves mostly as comic relief through the movie playing a suburban ahole. Nathan Fillion (Serenity, Land of the Dead) is great as well as one of the heroes in the movie Bill Pardy.

""Slither"" delivers some nasty gross scenes elevated by great special effects. The story never drags on , and the directors James Gunn shows all the signs of a veteran with good pacing letting the audience catch their breath during close calls and then scaring us the next minute. Everyone who did this movie should be extremely proud of themselves. ""Slither"" beyond a great horror movie really is just an entertaining movie period.",1145577600,4,1530,4.7406015037593985
1568328,3,B00005JOUX,"Slugs take over a little country town in the fashion of The Faculty. It starts off alittle slowly, but then it takes us on an ride of fun and jokes that's pretty much hit or miss. Pretty much everything about this film and the characters are as stereotypical as they can be. While some of the jokes and comments are funny, it just doesn't fully suceed in what it's trying to accomplish.

I was told that this movie was somewhat like Evil Dead 2, but it lacked the horror part. Nothing really creepy about it... Perhaps it's because it works with such a big budget. I think that big budget did bring the movie down alot.

Think of all the best horror films... Night of The Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Evil Dead 2, Texas Chainsaw Massacre... None of these really had a big budget. Which helps the film have a more sincere feel to it.

With all of this being said, it still has some good humor and the film does have some gross parts. I'd suggest renting this and viewing it once. It just doesn't contain enough scares or humor to keep coming back for more.",1145404800,,1057,4.301507537688442
1568329,3,B00005JOUX,"I'm struck with the thought that with the proliferation of VCR's and DVD's the cinematic experience has been lost.  We complain about people talking in the theater and peoples cell phones going off.  But as I was sitting there in the theater watching SLITHER I dreamed of a time when cinema was about the audience, when people laughed at movies, screamed when things were scary, and I long for that time when going to the local theater was a collective experience, and not about total silence and good behavior.

James Gunn's SLITHER is a throwback film.  A horror comedy that feels like it was written in 1985 from a screenplay that was written in 1954. One night in a small West Virginia town a meteor falls to ground and an alien life-form is released from it's core.  That alien infests a local man, and then through some amazingly  gory special effects creates small slug like creatures that infest the local population and turns them into zombies.  It's now up to the local sheriff, his childhood sweetheart, a foul-mouthed mayor, and a teenage girl to stop this menace from taking over the rest of the world.

Trust me if you've seen NIGHT OF THE CREEPS, CRITTERS, or GHOULIES you've seen SLITHER.  If you like that kind of thing then this is the movie for you.  It's short, sweet, and too the point.  You won't be gushing about how wonderful it is or anything, but as a diversion the movie works.

The film jumps when it needs to jump.  The characters while not very developed are alive enough that you care about them, and while the film need more laughs, it still winks back at you with its tongue firmly in cheek.  You leave the movie not very fulfilled but satisfied.

What would have helped the movie was some more humor, a ton more gore, and well just more.  The first act just goes on and on, and the finale is really lackluster and breezes by an breakneck speed.  I easily could have given this movie fifteen or twenty more minutes to build to something a lot more substantial.  But alas it begins and ends without really paying off.  What's there works, but with all the potential it had, the final showdown was so fast I felt a little cheated.  For once I just wanted a little more.

But if you like this kind of thing, a fast moving silly horror movie with a lot of gore than the film benefits from the cinematic experience.  An audience that likes silly horror comedy's and gets the in jokes will make it more fun. The experience is also enhanced by the jokers who throw popcorn, and the teenage girl who screams after every jump scene.  Alas that experience is probably few and far between in the modern multiplex but it would certainly help those who go see SLITHER.",1144800000,2,2688,4.508264462809917

Slither is the horror movie that carries such a traits.  Movie takes a place in small country town, and aliens/slugs became devastating threats to local people.  Only help they can get is local sheriff played by Nathan Fillon.  This movie contains very strong graphic violent as bad as today's standard horror, but goofy humor toned down the edge of reality and intensity to make this film as great 80's style fun splter movie.  Nathan Fillon effectively use his goofy side.  Old school Micheal Rooker was great for mayor of the town.  If you looking for innocent stupid fun at the theater on any week days, this could be a wise choice to see.......and don't you dare forget getting popcorn and jumbo size soda!!!",1144713600,2,1058,4.645161290322581
1568390,4,B00005JOUX,"""Slither"" is about as effective and funny as a grossout flick  is going to be, a gory, less chilling version of any number of horror films that combine alien invasions with zombie hordes, although ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" comes to mind. Writer/director James Gunn (screenwriter of the new ""Dawn of the Dead"" and, strangely, both ""Scooby Doo"" movies) weaves in some commentary about American consumption - all the aliens/zombies crave raw meat  - but ""Slither"" is meant as fun fiction, which it is.

Starla (Elizabeth Banks) is a cute schoolteacher who hooked up with a possessive sugar daddy named Grant (Michael Rooker) right out of high school. The one night Starla rejects him in ebd Grant cavorts in the woods with a local tramp (Brenda James), get a conscience, and stumbles upon a space slug. It shoots him with a poison dart, take command of his brain and turns him into a slug while it hatches plans to impregnate the tramp and create thousands of baby slugs. The impregnation sequence - one could term it a rape - it's simply, well, remarkably disgusting. It passes the wretch test.

""Slither"" zips by in 96 minutes but Gunn wisely keeps off the gas until the movie's second half, when we get a look at the tiny aliens slinking their way into the mouths of townspeople and Grant decomposes into a mound of pus and flesh, with two giant tentacles to defend itself. Only Starla, a sheriff (Nathon Fillion) and the teenage Kylie (Tania Saulier) remain to battle the town, and they form a two-prong assault on the lair, although Gunn plucks a prop right out of ""Jaws"" for the Grant's ultimate demise. Banks injects Starla with sincerity, gravitas, and, eventually, empowerment, while Fillion lopes along disbelievingly, as if the knowledge of dying a very interesting death is better than another night on the highway, waiting for speeders.",1144540800,3,1853,4.8544303797468356

1568395,4,B00005JOUX,"Over the last year or so, the true horror films (meaning, the non-PG-13 teen fests) took themselves very seriously.  We had enough hacked off limbs (Saw II), weird decapitations and spewing blood (High Tension), torture (Hostel and Wolf Creek) and just plain good scares and gore (The Descent, The Hills Have Eyes) to last a lifetime.  Most of these films had some connections to the 70s gore flicks in which the premise is made to instill terror and to disturb those watching it.  While you can't call some of the films ""fun"" exactly, they are all excellent in instilling terror and disturbing their viewers.

Into this fray comes a little film by James Gunn, the writer of the Dawn of the Dead remake/re-imagining, this time as not only writer but also director.  James Gunn began his career making Troma films like Tromeo and Juliet.  If you don't know what these films are, well I'm not about to explain them to you just go rent one.  Slither feels like a Troma picture with a bigger budget, a better script and with better actors.  What you can expect here is tons of gore but done in a fun, gross, over-the top way that makes you laugh as well as cringe.  Its about as close as you can get to the previously mentioned films while at the same time being so far removed.

Slither is about a very sleepy town in which the town's police use the speeding radar to track how fast the local birds fly and in which a meteor crashing into the forest behind them goes by totally unnoticed.  It's also a movie in which a man can be named Grant Grant, be an egotistical arse and become a host for a slug-like parasite.  It's also a movie in which seeing a squid-man, slugs and a bloated woman elicits nothing more than a ""this is some f---ked up sh-t.""  It's campy, but it's supposed to be.

It also is a movie that ends up being a total homage to movies from the 80s.  Everything from Evil Dead to Aliens to The Thing to even Predator (listen carefully to the music in one scene) to, of course, The Blob pops up.  By far, the most inspired moments are zombies who are all crying ""STARLA!"" in reference to A Streetcar Named Desire and the famous line ""STELLA!""

This is a good time to be a horror fan.  Slither is a fun film that will leave most horror fans giggling.  It reminds me of the 80s and the time when horror films were gross, maybe scary, but mostly fun.  Don't get me wrong, I will be the first one in line to see the other intense and disturbing films that bring back memories of the 70s goresploitation films.  But sometimes its nice to grab a bag of popcorn and watch alien slugs try and take over the world.",1144022400,57,2617,4.354639175257732
1568396,2,B00005JOUX,"While Slither is a much better horror movie than many that have been released in the past year or so, it still doesn't do quite enough to make sure that it doesn't just get lumped in with the rest of the pack.  For some reason, yet again I allowed myself to get excited for a movie without really using my reasoning and logic skills to ask myself if I should really be expecting that much.  There were a few reasons that I let myself get excited to go see Slither.  First of all, it is (somewhat) a zombie film, and I will go see any zombie film with no discrimination whatsoever.  Secondly, James Gunn wrote the film and I thoroughly enjoyed his Dawn of the Dead remake from last year.  Finally, I let the critics sway me once again.  Even though I hardly ever agree with their take on movies, I saw all the glowing reviews this movie was getting, and I finally decided that I couldn't wait to see it and it was going to be great.  Well, it wasn't great, but it was OK.

Slither is basically half creature flick and half zombie flick.  The movie begins with an asteroid crashing into Earth, and we are quickly introduced to the man who will become its first victim, Grant Grant, played very well by Michael Rooker.  After being infected, Grant goes on a rampage of killing innocent animals and kidnapping a local woman to become a womb for the nasty little slugs that turn innocent townsfolk into murderous zombies, all basically just an extention of Grant.  In short, a band of policeman join together, and the ones who dont' get killed off make their way to a final showdown with the much-mutated, disgusting Grant.

The best part of the film is definitely the dialogue.  Gunn has written another really good script, and all of the actors do exactly what is needed of them to make the film funny, and lighten the mood from all the horrendous events taking place on screen.  Story, obviously, is not one of the film's stronger points, and neither is pacing.  It starts out rather slowly and when it finally gets going, I found myself a little bored from the prolonged set up.  Basically, the few really funny moments in the film aren't enough to make up for all the slow parts where it tries to be a real horror film that just doesn't work.  Once again, a film seems to be torn as to whether to just be a spoof, or try to be a spoof and be a real horror flick.  Newsflash: you cannot do both, and Slither unsuccesfully goes down that road.  This is unfortunate, because I was expecting a lot from this movie, and I am once again let down.  I would recommend this movie to horror fans, but to anyone else, stay away.",1143849600,6,2617,4.37888198757764
1568397,5,B00005JOUX,"James Gunn first got his chance to work in the horror-comedy genre with his time in Troma Films. His first contribution to the genre being a send up of Shakespeare's Romero and Juliet aptly titled as Tromeo and Juliet. He next moved on to penning scripts for the major studios with his first two being the critically-panned, but profitable two Scooby-Doo live-action films. Gunn next moved on to writing a script reimagining George A. Romero's classic Dawn of the Dead. Despite howls of protest from the original film's legion of fans, the film went on to be a modest success and helped bring about the renaissance of the current zombie mania in all facet of entertainment. Gunn follows up the success of his Dawn remake by not just writing the script but finally getting behind the camera and directing it himself. I'm glad to say that James Gunn's first directorial debut with Slither has turned out to be one fun, gross-out, disgustingly hilarious horror-comedy that brings to mind the splatter-comedy films of the 1980's.

I say that Slither has alot in common with the horror-comedy during the 80's just for the fact that we've not seen a film of this kind since. Slither brings to mind such 80's B-movie shlock classics like Critters, Return of the Living Dead, and Night of the Creeps. But Gunn also pays some an homage to cult classics like John Carpenter's The Thing. One of the character's in the film and a store are even named after The Thing's badass antihero, R.J. MacReady. Then there's the tip of the hat to Romero's zombies, though this time around I would say that Gunn had more in mind the quickthinking and funny undead from John Russo's Return of the Living Dead. There's even a shout out to Invasion of the Body Snatchers as the alien slug-controlled populace are actually part of a much larger organism who thinks for all.

The story Gunn came up with for Slither was pretty straightforward and simple. Intelligent alien organism bent on world domination hitches a ride on a meteor which travel the depths of space until it falls on an unsuspecting planet. Unfortunately, the planet in question for the film happens to be Earth. Right from the get go the comedic aspect of the film begins even as the alien-laden meteor crash lands its way to one Wheelsy, N.C. A podunk town where the most interesting to happen each year is the annual Deer Cheer which signals the start of Deer Hunting season. We get to see the mundane day-to-day life of the townspeople from the pretty high school teacher Starla Grant (adorably played and with a strong sense of marital fidelity by Elizabeth Banks from 40-Year Old Virgin), the town's obnoxious and foulmouthed Mayor MacReady (Gregg Henry's performance was hilarious and he gets pretty much all the best one-liners), to its Chief of Police Bill Pardy (Nathan Fillion in Han Solo mode).

The alien soon finds a host in the town's richest person who also happens to be Starla's much older husband, Grant Grant. Michael Rooker (Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer) plays Grant and his performance was both funny and sad. He pretty much starts morphing into a creature somewhere between Jabba the Hutt and a Lovecraftian squid-person. But through it all, Grant's love for his wife manifests itself by way of the alien's collective intelligence. When the townspeople all start getting infected by the large, slug-like offsprings of the main alien, it's hilarious to find that they all share Grant's love for Starla. It would seem that the alien collective learned abit or two from Grant about marital love and also a love of Air Supply's syrupy ballad, ""Every Woman in the World."" These zombies chant the word ""Starla"" instead of ""brains."" The rest of the film was pretty much Starla, Bill Pardy and a small band of survivors trying to stop the Grant-alien, the slugs and the zombified townspeople from spreading out of Wheelsy and out onto the rest of the planet.

The film balances well between horror and comedy. The horror aspect of Slither comes from the many gory scenes. Trust me when I say that this film has more than its share of blood, gore and splatter. We're shown dead and gutted pets and farm animals. Not to mention the requisite flesheating performed by the zombies. the great thing about the scenes of horror in Slither was the absence of CGI except for a scene or two and even then it was difficult to pinpoint which was CGI and which was animatronics and make-up effects. Slither's monster effect owes alot to the work of Rob Bottin and his crew who did the disgustingly creative effects on Carpenter's The Thing. I'm glad to see that Gunn decided to forgo CGI for these scenes and went for more realism. Even if such realism were nauseatingly disgusting and gross. Just what a horror movie was suppose to be. The comedy part came not from the aliens and the scenes of horror, but from the characters reactions to the unfolding events around them.

Just like Shaun of the Dead, Slither's characters stumble, bumble and trip their way through the crisis. Even Fillion's character of Bill the Chief goes against the stereotypical hero from these type of film. He's a smartass about his job and how he sees the people he's suppose to protect, but when the time came to do his job as protector he tries to do the best he can even though the best he can doesn't measure up to what we're suppose to get from our heroes. The dialogue is fast and crisp which made for alot of hilarious one-liners and most of the m coming from the mouth of Slither's Mr. Pibb obssessed Mayor MacReady and his penchant for overreacting to everything and also for calling everyone c**ksucker. Gregg Henry's character by far got the most laughs whenever he said something on-screen.

Slither doesn't try to be anything but what it set out to be: a funny horror film with a large helping of slapstick, splatter and slime. In thet respect, James Gunn succeeded with his writing and directing of Slither. The movie doesn't bring any originality to the horror-comedy genre. To be honest, there's not much originality left to bring to the genre, but Slither takes all the usual conventions from those 80's horror-comedies and gives it a new millenium vibe. The acting by the cast was well-done and showed that they must've have fun doing the film. The special effects were done old-school style with nary a CGI-effect to be seen except for a few brief scenes. In the end, Slither was one fun rollercoaster of a movie that scared the audience into jumping and recoiling in their seats and at the same time making them scream, shout and laugh when doing so. I've never had as much fun these last couple years watching a movie like I did with Slither.",1143763200,90,6689,4.722602739726027
1568398,3,B00005JOUX,"In Wes Craven's ""Scream,"" Jamie Kennedy gave a list of rules that teen slasher films tend to follow (""The virgin never dies,"" and ""Never say, 'I'll be right back,'"" come to mind). He was definitely on the right track; a lot of those movies do make use of the same storytelling formula. And I think the same can be said for alien invasion movies, the ones that have disgusting creatures hitching a ride on a meteorite that crash lands on Earth. Here are the rules I came up with: 1) The meteorite will always land in some middle of nowhere town in the Midwest; 2) The first victim always becomes the main villain (for lack of a better term); 3) The most annoying character will be killed last; and 4) The only ones who can take care of the problem is a group of well meaning but unqualified country police officers.

This formula is followed to a tee in ""Slither,"" a science fiction/horror/comedy founded in the tradition of such cheap-thrill fests as ""Critters"" and Tobe Hooper's ""Invaders from Mars."" I'm not using ""cheap-thrill fests"" lightly here; this is a B movie right from the get go, and the audiences these types of movies attract aren't the kind you'd want around when watching romantic comedies or historical dramas. To say it's a limited crowd would be just as much of an understatement as saying that the story formula is incredibly overused. The only noticeable differences between these grade B Alien Invasion films are the creatures themselves. For ""Slither,"" we have an army of slimy slugs that can penetrate the body and take over the mind. Another difference is that this time, the creatures are computerized (this isn't exactly a plus so much as it's a product of the age we live in).

I've already established that a meteorite plummets from space and crashes into a rural area. Now let's get to the more specific details. The location is a farming community called Wheelsly, a place where--you guessed it--nothing much happens. The very first scene shows two cops in a cruiser on a night watch, one of them falling asleep, the other measuring the speed of a passing bird. It's obvious why this scene was included: to show that the humdrum lives of these simple folk are soon going to get very interesting. And boy, do they ever, especially for a man named Grant Grant (Michael Rooker, and yes, his character's first and last names are the same). He's the stereotypical dominant male, the overprotective controller who keeps a fairly tight leash on his wife, Starla (Elizabeth Banks).

But more importantly, he's the first to discover the meteorite's crash site and make contact with the creature it contained. He finds a white, gooey blob that shoots a barb-like organism into his chest, one that travels up to his brain and settles there. He soon thereafter develops a ravenous appetite for raw meat, especially if it's fresh; why else would a number of the neighborhood's pets disappear so suddenly? He also begins to show physical changes, which eventually progress into a series of tentacles that protrude from the wound in his chest. We eventually learn that those tentacles can impregnate a person with thousands of little slug baddies. This unfortunately happens to a woman named Brenda (Brenda James), whose body swells to a balloon the size of an entire room. (""I think there's something wrong with me!"" she says when the cops find her. Was I the only one thinking of Violet Beauregarde from ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory""?)

Apparently, Starla had been right to grow suspicious of her husband's increasingly odd behavior (but not before he comes home that first morning and gives her the best sex she's had in a while). The local authorities were also right in connecting Grant with Brenda's disappearance. The one who shows the greatest concern for Starla is Chief Bill Pardy (Nathan Fillion), who's had a crush on her since they were both teenagers. It's quite obvious that she has feelings for him, as well, but because of Grant--and the situation their little town is in--they never had a chance to explore a meaningful relationship.

Does the audience care about this? Not really. All they want to see are messy alien encounters. Luckily they have nothing to worry about; plenty of those moments are seen after Brenda ""gives birth"" to a multitude of baby slugs. Many of them go along their merry ways, entering the mouths of the residents and turning them into flesh-eating zombie minions of the now completely transformed Grant (a blubbery, slimy, tentacle-laden mass of flesh that looked like Jabba the Hutt on acid). This aspect comes off as a bastardized reinterpretation of ""Star Trek""'s Borg Collective in that all of Grant's thoughts and feelings are shared among the possessed automatons (even women and children come up to Starla and say things only Grant would say, a lot of which can't be repeated on a public website).

It was an interesting plot device, no question, but it also seemed like an excuse to include unnecessary bits of humor. In fact, the entire movie attempts to show a sick, twisted sense of humor. It does succeed occasionally (like in the case of the town's mayor, a foulmouthed Phony with a capital P), but it mostly fails. The moments of horror were too serious to let the funny moments take off. Likewise, the funny moments were too ridiculous to allow any of the horror to sink in. As I sat in the theater, I had the feeling that the filmmakers wanted this to be a fun movie. Unfortunately, what they wound up with was a movie that tried too hard to be something it wasn't. I suppose I have to give it credit for trying; its unabashed display of gore will keep fans of the horror genre entertained, and a couple of the comedic one-liners are amusing.

I don't know; maybe the age of Meteorite Alien Invasion films has passed. Or maybe the idea just wasn't handled properly. Casting choices, editing, and continuous script rewrites may also be to blame. But any way you look at it, ""Slither""--for all its intentional shamelessness--is a film that doesn't quite live up to its reputation.",1143763200,9,6061,4.7831900668576885
