4233584,5,B003ZFN3O2,"It went way beyond my expectations of a good Senior exercise program to use in my living room.  After doing exercise training in a women's gym for 9 years, as of now, I have experienced this DVD as a outstanding way of teaching body nourishing movements slowly with gentleness needing NO equipment. Not only this, but Lee has arranged the DVD into 3 sections with slow gentle guidance along the way of the Basic Qi Gong/ standing by chair Qi Gong/ his mother sitting in a chair beside Lee standing with a chair Qi Gong for us to watch and listen before we try it. The whole Practice is filmed in color, outdoors in California around moving water and with the most calming sound of relaxing music in the background.  AND for me the High Point is the final section where Lee tells of WHAT,WHERE and HOW the energy of our body moves and triggers Healing from within our own bodies by using our own Immune System.  I could go on and on, but you need, as I did, to LEARN things about your life and your body that you never
knew or would not believe, until this experience.",1434067200,19,1067,4.351758793969849

4233591,5,B003ZFN3O2,"We bought this video from Lee Holden, not Amazon. I didn't know that I could get one here.

This was our first Qigong video. We were looking to learn by following along. That's what this video does. We stand in front of our big screen TV with the video playing and we follow along. As such, we are not interested in length theory or background discussion; that's a separate pursuit. Lee provides just this sort of video and it is very, very good.

My wife and I were married at Lake Tahoe and so Lee's use of the lake Tahoe setting is cool and has additional meaning to us.

These practices are fairly gentle and we got into doing them very easily.

There are some breathing practices (the spinal cord breathing being one of the best for any age), balance, joint movements (every joint is gently exercised), and a bit of flow. I recommend adding Lee's ""Deeper Flow"" video because qigong flow is where the sweet spot in life is..

Lee is very conscious of what we are looking for, it seems to me. Each practice is done several times. Lee explains the movement and how to do it. He usually names it. Then a bit into it he tells you how to breathe, what part you inhale into and what part do you exhale. Often he follows this a bit later with what the move does. Thus, you get the move first, the breath, and the what in stages, not all at once. Lee consciously lets you know when the practice you are doing is coming to an end and prepares you for a change.

Lee offers alternative practices for some of the moves, and there is a complete second video where his mother accompanies him and she does the practices seated while he stands. Some seniors may find this better suited to them than all standing.

An exceptional video. I highly recommend this video to any one my age and older. Even the younger Baby Boomers can benefit from these videos.",1383523200,40,1844,4.358600583090379
4233592,5,B003ZFN3O2,"I first saw and participated in this class at the community center in the retirement community where I reside.  It was the first time I'd exercised on my own, 7 months after spinal fusion surgery.  Sitting down, I was able to accomplish all the exercises in the 30 minute session.  The room was dark and my friend from China said it's best to do Qi Gong in light, so I bought the DVD to do it at home.",1379894400,25,401,4.115384615384615

8410228,5,B003ZFN3O2,"I have been doing a tai chi class at the local senior center; having heard about qigong, I did some online research and bought this dvd. I haven't seen Lee Holden's qi gong on our PBS station. But, having done this dvd several times, I can vouch for his teaching. Depending on what kind of work day I've had, I do the modified qi gong (shown by Lee's mother or Lee using a chair for support) or I 'go for it' and do Lee's version. The moves are easy to follow, Lee and his mom are good together. The Lake Tahoe scenery is lovely, water is soothing for me and the music is gentle, not loud or 'in your face'. I am glad I tried this.",1466467200,3,631,4.015873015873016

The Amazon description was very clear and accurate. The Amazon customer reviews were helpful. It was well packaged and arrived on schedule.",1454976000,9,278,4.673469387755102
8410232,5,B003ZFN3O2,"Lee Holden is a marvelous teacher. I do this with my 91 year old Mom. A year ago she had to do this sitting,now she does it standing. I believe Qi Gong is the key to longevity.

I would recommend any of Lee Holden's Qi Gong videos. The senior DVD is less strenuous than his Bone and Joint one, but just as beneficial.",1436227200,2,283,4.68
8410234,5,B003ZFN3O2,"This is a fantastic DVD for seniors like me who have arthritis.  It relaxes me quickly and even gives me ideas for exercises I can do quickly throughout the day.
