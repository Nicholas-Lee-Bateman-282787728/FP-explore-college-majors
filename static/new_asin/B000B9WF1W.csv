2409504,5,B000B9WF1W,The Night Before Christmas shows all of Chicago during the Christmas season in its true holiday form.  I loved this movie as it reminded me what is important in life when things get rough.  A great gift for someone in need of a lift in life.,1127347200,2,241,4.217391304347826
2409505,1,B000B9WF1W,So Sorry but I hated it very boring and slow....Wish I could sell it back,1196380800,2,73,3.933333333333333
2409506,1,B000B9WF1W,I was very disappointed in the movie as a whole. the film was very difficult to view looking like it had been made and copied from tape to tape many times! The sound was difficult to hear and it was hard to follow the story line because of this.,1192406400,2,245,4.020408163265306
2409507,4,B000B9WF1W,"It was good enough for Lifetime Television (one of the original Lifetime Movies), so I do not understand the ""put downs"" as they relate to the production.  The DVD has bonus features and interesting commentary from the Director not found on the VHS.  Nice little movie, which is most certainly not a comedy, but a look at how it feels to be alone on a major Holiday, and how one deals with the lonliness.  This film received several awards, so it is not a fly by night production.  It is however a low budget attempt to do something different.  I do not regret buying it.  Support Independent Filmmakers!  They are the future.",1142985600,22,626,4.535714285714286
2409508,5,B000B9WF1W,"While watching this film, I found that I could relate to the main characer, Nick, very well.  I'm sure most people can relate to being down at Christmas, or at least a particular Christmas.  This film shows us that sometimes it's just the small things, the brief encounters that can lift our spirits and remind us of the joy of this holiday.",1134000000,19,341,4.483870967741935
2409509,4,B000B9WF1W,"This movie has a great Chicago ""feeling"" to it.  In fact, my favorite parts throughout the film are the shots in and around the Windy City.

Most everyone can empathize with the main character and his tribulations on Christmas Eve.  The theme of unrequited love during the holiday season is especially poignant.

Be warned that the production values are kind of poor (sound and picture are more reminiscent of VHS than DVD).  To me this was a forgivable shortcoming, only adding to the independent feel of the movie and ensemble cast of relative unknowns.

One of those rare movies without any bad language or violence that the entire family can enjoy!",1132876800,31,652,4.828828828828829
2409510,5,B000B9WF1W,"I found this film a delight. Not just because I could totally identify with Nick, but mainly because of the need to find something good to believe in when I feel down and lonely.

To me, this movie is about a journey about the need to reach within oneself to find the happiness we are all searching for.

I found some parts (the car incident!) wickedly funny, as this whole situation was so recognizable. I loved to see Chicago! Especially in Winter!

Michael Kelley (Nick) I really liked because he was so approachable, that and his good looks ;)

Everybody goes thru something like this, at least ONE Christmas in their life's and the feeling after watching the movie I am left with is: hope!

No mushy squoeshy, no sex, no violence and no cussing: what a relief!

Finding the true spirit of Christmas and reminding all viewers that happiness, hope and faith is in the little things we see around us everyday, and the good we can do if only we DO IT!

Like one line in the movie goes: Christmas is not about getting what you want, but getting what you need!

And that is also true about this movie!

You NEED to see this wonderful uplifting indy movie! And if you can't find it uplifting, you seriously need to take some anti-depressants!

2409511,5,B000B9WF1W,"Having recieved the film and watching it in early November, I thought I wouldn't enjoy a Christmas film simply because I wasn't in the mood.

 But I am happy to say I was pleasently suprised with this film.

Overall I thought it was a very nice, clean, and enjoyable movie.

In my opinion evry aspect of the film was very enjoyable and done very well. Of course it had its minor flaws but what film doesn't.

 In particular I really enjoyed the character of Nick and the story in which he takes part of. There was something about Michael Kelley's performance in the role that made him very relateable and fun to watch.

 Bottom line, I really enjoyed the movie. I plan on making this one of my annual christmas viewings. A great Christmas film for the whole family.

2409512,1,B000B9WF1W,"I always make a point of reading other peoples reviews of a movie before I purchase it, although I do not write them myself; and purchased this one solely on the 6 glowing endorsements that were listed here for it.  This is the first time I have ever been totally let down by what was written versus the actual movie.  In fact; the only real facts to be noted from the reviews are that this 45 minute movie, which was obviously cheaply made and with very poor audio, are the bits about it being in Chicago and that it is a story about Christmas despair.  There was nothing uplifting, nothing cheerful, no happy ending and the DVD is now residing in the trash can - it's just that bad.  If you want to see a Christmas movie that will make you so totally depressed by the time you finish watching it that you want to stick you head in the oven and turn the gas on, then this one is for you.",1131494400,41,888,4.145348837209302
2409513,5,B000B9WF1W,"I first saw this on Lifetime in the nineties and then searched for it on video a few years ago when I was on a Christmas movie kick.  It ranks as one of the all time best in my opinion, even though it was an independant film with no famous actors.  I enjoy every scene, as well as the acting performances.  Especially from the lead actor, who I think adds a lot to the film.  There is some funny audio commentary about how his performance in the latter scenes were enhanced.  It may not have much appeal for kids (or it may) but I think every fan of Christmas movies will enjoy this.  It really captures the spirit of the season and makes me wish that I lived in Chicago during Christmas.",1130544000,12,688,4.174242424242424
2409514,5,B000B9WF1W,"This is one of them.  I found this movie to be very thought provoking and a very well told and acted story of Christmas despair.  A good family film, although with a little minor language, this movie may not be for the very young.  The DVD is also packed with lots of special features making this a refreshing DVD to view.",1128297600,3,322,4.245901639344262
8083994,5,B000B9WF1W,Love the movie,1485648000,,14,4.0
8083995,1,B000B9WF1W,Very poor quality and a bit of a sleeper. I only like the fact that it was filmed in Chicago.,1438992000,,93,3.7
8083996,1,B000B9WF1W,"My family wasted over an hour of our lives watching this incredibly slow-moving film. We kept asking each other when the interesting part would start; it didn't.  Even beautiful Chicago seemed gray and sad.  It basically shows a young man who ignored his family's invitation to spend Christmas Eve with them because ""they all talked at the same time and didn't listen"", hurting his mother's feelings by not even calling; whose flakey ex-girlfriend is insulted when he buys her a videotape of a film she liked; who walks about town looking at others who also don't seem to have a life, family traditions or values.  His enlightenment in the end is poorly filmed and edited.  All in all, one of the worst films I have ever seen.",1357948800,,726,4.692913385826771
8083997,4,B000B9WF1W,"The Night Before Christmas  is not a big budget production, it is a little film with a decidedly independent movie feel. Originally released in 1994, as an hour long (with commercials) film shown on Lifetime TV, the DVD was issued as an anniversary edition in 2004 with versions in standard and widescreen, along with extras. Unfortunately, it is a grainy copy and the sound is a bit muffled in spots, which is the reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5.

The story is a quiet one more in tune with how most of us live our lives. There are no huge dramatic moments, no death, no job loss, no sudden wealth, just a series of small events and meaningful realizations. By the end the main character has refocused on what is important instead of looking at what he doesn't have, like his girlfriend or a raise. The essence of the holiday spirit is that it is intangible, it isn't about an armload of gifts, it is about family, friendship, enjoying life and helping others

This movie isn't depressing, it is hopeful. No viewer will be brought to tears from an artificially created plot twist, this movie simply reminds us that the small gestures we make, often without even realizing it, can touch others deeply. It may seem like they've had no effect, because unlike a Hollywood movie, in real life we usually don't know the outcome of our small kindnesses. If you are looking for a movie off the beaten track, and not expecting the usual holiday fare this is a good one.",1258761600,,1472,4.526315789473684
8083998,5,B000B9WF1W,"I truly enjoyed this Christmas Movie! All the characters were great!! The star of the movie, Michael Kelley was Exceptionally Good, and was very well casted in this movie!

This Motion Picture gave me a very 'Good Feeling' about the Holiday Season, and was indeed a very uplifting movie! I loved the Christmas Background Scenery that was set in Chicago. I thought it was very clever how the main character 'Nick Allman' appeared to be mostly observing people at Christmas Time instead of truly joining in with them, but seemed very content, and pleased with his observation role, and what he was observing. It was a very touching movie indeed!

The only thing that bothered me about this movie because of the fact that I was enjoying it so much, was that it seemed too short. Also the Audio was a bit soft during various parts of this movie. But, I enjoyed very much the character of 'Nick Allman' (immensely) because he seemed so very 'real' thanks to the very natural and believable acting of Michael Kelley.

The Special Features that concerned the making of this movie were fun to watch too! Overall, this was a very Enjoyable Product! I am glad that I had decided to purchase it, and I surely will be watching it again very soon!!",1255046400,,1235,4.63013698630137
8083999,1,B000B9WF1W,"I was suprised to get an email from Amazon about my marketplace order of this film. Although I had a dim recollection of ordering it, after reading the item description I was scratching my head about WHY I had ordered it. Me, a Lifetime film?

Well, I got kinda new age in my rationalizations and thought ""there is a special reason. There must be a message for me in this film. etc."" So, it arrives today and I order pizza and gather the kids and put the film on. This flick is AWFUL--bad production values, lousy actors, overdubbed like a Godzilla film. However, I sit through it anxiously awaiting my personal message, since I must have bought it for some reason. I finally recognized an actress in a minor role from her steamy shower scenes in a woman-in-prison film (which I highly recommend) that I had watched earlier this week.

Well, folks, I got my message and it is very clear; stay off Amazon if you've been drinking!",1229644800,,928,4.517857142857143
8084000,1,B000B9WF1W,This movie had a decent story but the picture was so 'grainy' that I didn't enjoy it like I would have.  And the sound wasn't the best.  I don't recommend anyone paying this much money for something that looks like it was made in a garage!,1229126400,,239,4.173913043478261
8084001,5,B000B9WF1W,many People Can relate to the story and the main character. One of many Jerry Vasilatos's great works. Very well directed and acted.,1226707200,,132,4.782608695652174
8084002,2,B000B9WF1W,"The main character had no Christmas spirit, but tried to find joy. His girlfriend had broken up with him and got mad at him for sending her a gift. He is shown walking the city looking for joy and things to do. He runs into a few people who try to cheer him up. For me this movie was dragging on with boring characters. It may have had a decent ending with him getting back with his girlfriend and going home for Christmas, but those were just brief showings, nothing to hold unto. I watched about 15 Christmas movies through November and December and this movie was the most boring and un-interesting.",1199318400,2,602,4.383928571428571
8084003,1,B000B9WF1W,"Weak story, obvious outcome, flat singing, super sweet, very short movie. It did not deserve to be in my Christmas collection so it is gone. Sorry I wasted my money.",1198108800,,165,4.533333333333333
