6780778,5,B00P0E48EK,"This is the best movie that I have seen in a very long time. This should have been an Academy Award winner for Best Picture. Best Actor in a leading roll, and Best Director. Wolfgang Peterson and this major cast was Cheated out of their Academy Awards.",1486166400,,252,4.382978723404255
6780779,5,B00P0E48EK,have the directors cut very good,1480291200,,32,4.5

6780782,1,B00P0E48EK,"I love this movie but I don't like the fact that it's necessary to change discs in the middle of it. The features could/ should have all gone on disc 2.  And frankly,  the additional dialogue and scenes in this director's cut only seem to slow the movie down.  In other words, the edits they made for the theatrical release were judicious.  I want the other version back.",1473206400,5,371,4.411764705882353
6780783,4,B00P0E48EK,"The combat scenes were outstanding. Swords were flashing, and spears were being tossed. Fighting was up close and personal as combatants hacked each other.
.
The details in the Blu-ray version were outstanding. These were evident in various scenes.
.
CLOSEUPS ON THE KING AGAMEMNON: The viewer could see the individual hairs on his head and beard with their varied shades and tones. Brown spots, hair stubs, lines, and pores on his aged face were noticeable.
.
COSTUMES: The Bronze Age armor was intricate with their geometric designs. The encrusted colored gems produced different shadow tones and sparkled in the sun.
.
CLOSEUPS ON THE COMBATANTS: The sweat on the soldiers' faces glistened and rolled down their pores, leaving wet trails on their faces. The sweat also bunched strands of hair together, while the dust settled and caked them.
.
My only complaints were the inaccuracies of the film. The producers took artistic interpretations to extreme. There were many things that contradicted Homer's ILIAD.
.
1. Hector did not kill Menelaus in combat. In the ILIAD, he and Helen sailed to Egypt and to Sparta after the Trojan War.
.
2. Paris and Helen did not escape together after the sack of Troy. In the ILIAD, Paris was wounded by a poison arrow and died.
.
3. Hector did not kill Ajax in combat. In the ILIAD, Ajax was not awarded Achilles' armor after his death. He vowed vengeance and plotted to kill the Greek leaders during the night. The gods cursed him with madness, and he slaughtered a herd of sheep instead. Coming to his senses, he was ashamed and committed suicide.
.
4. King Agamemnon did not die during the sacking of Troy. He lived and sailed home. His wife knifed him on his homecoming. This was in revenge for the sacrificial killing of their daughter to appease the gods and bring favorable winds during the voyage across the Aegean Sea.",1470528000,2,1865,4.777089783281734

6780786,5,B00P0E48EK,"Brad Pitt brings Achilles to life in this epic story. It's long, but never dull.",1462665600,,80,4.4
6780787,5,B00P0E48EK,"Probably way out there as history even if Troy existed, but enjoyable movie with epic proportions.",1456617600,2,98,5.1875
6780788,5,B00P0E48EK,In one word---EPIC!!!  Much better than the original.  If you haven't seen the 'Director's Cut' then you've never truly seen this movie.  I will almost always get Director's Cut editions just because there are always great extras.,1455580800,6,230,5.162162162162162

6780795,1,B00P0E48EK,The dvd kept freezing at certain points of the movie. I tried 3 different did/blu-Ray players and the dvd froze at the same points on every player. If you feel like wasting money please buy this.,1425427200,2,195,4.444444444444445

8685994,5,B00P0E48EK,"What can I say about one of my favorite movies that was so well done with plenty of Action!
Arrived quickly and well packaged !",1530576000,,127,4.12
8685995,3,B00P0E48EK,"A high drama adventure, but it does not follow the traditional mythology. The only reason for it that I can see is that you need the star, Brad Pitt, who plays Achilles, to survive to the end of the Trojan War, which Achilles does not. There are over twenty other violations to the traditional myth.",1524009600,,299,4.454545454545454
8685996,5,B00P0E48EK,A good mythology movie,1523059200,,22,4.75
8685997,4,B00P0E48EK,"Between the 3 versions I have, all take liberties with Homer. This is a modern adult version, more sex and bare skin. Still a good watch.",1515369600,,137,4.3076923076923075
8685998,5,B00P0E48EK,"This Director's cut is outstanding. I have watched it so many times and every time I do, I see something new. Brad Pitt is excellent as Achilles. This is the best version of this incredible movie. I bought two copies. There are many scenes in this movie that are not in the other version of TROY. If you really want to know the incredible history of Greece , you need to buy this. Men and women will both love.",1513468800,,410,4.2025316455696204

8686001,3,B00P0E48EK,"Pretty Good, Considering this is from Hollywood & not from The History Channel.  The only ""Gripe"" I have with this is Orlando Bloom's character, Paris.  Yeah, I know, it's how it's supposed to happen in  Homer's epic poem/story.  Paris falls for Sparta's Queen Helen, rumored to be ""The most Beautiful Woman in the World."" She was the daughter of The Greek Kind of the Gods, Zeus & Leda, also a Queen of Sparta.  He's basically everything that girls/women hate in men; unfaithfulness, untrustworthy, etc.  I did love their uses of Special Effects in this movie, though.  Congrats to Hans Zimmer on the awesome misc.",1504569600,,615,4.855769230769231
