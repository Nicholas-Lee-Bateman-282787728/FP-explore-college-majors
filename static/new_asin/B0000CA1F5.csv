7998359,2,B0000CA1F5,"This DVD is a terrible disappointment. The dancing is good but the visual quality is bad and the audio is horrible. Watching it once was painful and I don't want to see it again. I'm going to give it to Good Will and feel sorry for anyone that gets it. It's sad to see ballets marketed with such awful sound qualities. I'm being generous to give it two stars, but that's because of the dancing. As to audio I'd give it zero stars. Don't waste your money on this one.",1358899200,6,466,4.188888888888889
7998360,5,B0000CA1F5,"This is a MUST have for fans of the National Ballet of Canada, and NUREYEV! In Sleeping Beauty you get Nureyev in his prime as the Prince, Veronica Tennant, Prima Ballerina as the Princess, and a very young Karen Kain and Frank Augustyn in the Bluebird Pas de Deux! This si the production that brought Canadian ballet into the international spotlight. It is history in the making.
Giselle stars Karen Kain and Frank Augustyn, early in their careers. Giselle is always an emotional experience. This is another jewel.",1104969600,5,515,4.863636363636363
