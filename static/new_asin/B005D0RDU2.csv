4655563,5,B005D0RDU2,"I was happy to find this movie on Amazon as it has been removed from Netflix. Although it is an unauthorized biography of J.K. Rowling's life, I enjoy this movie and can only hope that it is true to some degree. Poppy Montgomery's performance was truly magical.",1493683200,,261,4.574468085106383

4655565,5,B005D0RDU2,This film was so uplifting.  I always wanted to know the story behind the creation of the Harry Potter books; now I do and its just as sweet as I expected.  Poppy Montgomery was the perfect choice to play J. K. Rowling.  Wow!!!  What a performance.  I have such respect for J. K. Rowling and how she faced so many challenges with grace.  Great movie!  I think I'll go watch it again.,1491609600,,383,4.236111111111111
4655566,5,B005D0RDU2,"Excellent story. I saw it on TV several years ago, and thought about it ... and then found Magic Beyond Words on Amazon. I will continue to watch MBW several tomes a year. Some writers dreams do ... come true. With belief, persistence, and a fantastic imagination. Or was it? Her stories, in another life?",1490832000,,305,4.5636363636363635
4655567,5,B005D0RDU2,"This is the best Biography movie that I ever watched in my entire life besides Gifted Hands The Ben Carson Story that stars Cuba Gooding Jr who plays Ben Carson which is one of the main characters . J.K. Rowling went through a lot in her entire life as a author. Here are a few for example, her mother's death on New Year's Eve, Divorce with her first husband because of fighting and yelling reasons mostly with a little shoving and hitting. Writing the first Harry Potter Book and being ejected more than once I believe they didn't mention it in the movie. Best movie to watch with or without your kids...",1486166400,,606,4.419642857142857
4655568,5,B005D0RDU2,"As a Potter fan, I really loved this movie. It's the unofficial story of J.K Rowling's life from childhood leading up to the first Movie premier. Poppy Montgomery was completely believable in this role.",1485648000,,202,4.970588235294118

4655585,5,B005D0RDU2,"Even though it is an ""unauthorized"" biography, I found ""Magic Beyond Words"" very inspiring and enlightening. I had no idea JK Rowling went through as much as she did. Having been recently diagnosed with MS, I now have a particular interest in what her mother went through as well. Thank you, Poppy, for a wonderful portrayal of a wonderful and much-loved author. This is now one of my go-to Cinderella movies where dreams really do come true.",1479254400,2,442,4.753246753246753

4655606,3,B005D0RDU2,"I was disappointed that the biopic didn't include any information about how Rowling got the idea for the seven books. The flashbacks weren't enough. I did learn about Joann Rowling's difficult life -- I had no idea about her past. I truly felt her disappointment about not being accepted to Oxford University, a school I attended for my post-graduate degree. It must have bees devastating.",1468800000,3,389,5.0

4655622,5,B005D0RDU2,"As both a life story and the tale of a legend of literary success, Magic Beyond Words is an excellent portrayal of a complex woman.  The movie traces the early life and later development of JK Rowling -- and as nearly as I could check in other sources, with both dramatic flair and accuracy. Poppy Montgomery is brilliant as JK Rowling in adult life.  She is well supported by a competent cast.",1462924800,,394,4.458333333333333

I have all the books and movies. To see the story of JK Rowling though... It made me love and appreciate them even more. This movie has inspired me to write. I've always had stories I wanted to tell but was too afraid to write. I'm no longer afraid. I watch this movie every couple of weeks, usually when I'm feeling like I no longer want to write. I love it!",1460419200,3,511,4.12

4655628,4,B005D0RDU2,"Inspiring, if it is not a Hollywood fictionalized story about JK Rowling.  I only read her first Harry Potter book and this was after I read her first adult novel, A Casual Vacancy, which I enjoyed.",1458604800,,198,4.5
4655629,5,B005D0RDU2,"What an inspiration for writers who have a series on sub with their agent! My, God. It's stunningly well-produced with one of the most beautiful music scores I've ever heard. I just love Poppy in this role, she downplays her sexual presence and shows incredible emotion and sensitivity, a great honor and accuracy in portraying Jo Rowling. I'm a 64 year-old brutish ex-cop, but my eyes flooded with tears during several scenes. I know exactly what Jo went through in her writing--I've lived it, but much more tougher than she had. All eight of my published books are not equal to one of hers.",1456876800,,592,4.701923076923077

4655637,3,B005D0RDU2,The stars are for the acting; the lead actress did a good job with a poorly-written script.  Rowling herself had a life like many of ours; but this provided a reminder to creative people to push forward and follow that dream.,1447372800,,225,4.487804878048781

Everything about this was magical within it's self, including the depiction carried out in her struggle to derive from a poverty  stricken person to wealth. She developed a passion for writing like it was second nature to riding a bike almost. Her imagination was brought on by events in her life from a kid to an adult; she took that, and imagine what it would be to make it fun.

There was no in depth study of the agonizing personal struggle demanded of a creative artist.  That is probably difficult to depict in such a superficial production.

The actress Poppy did a credible job, but she was much more exuberant than any interviews Jo Rowling has ever given.

This movie is basically a brainless way to spend a little time.",1407715200,,511,4.827586206896552

It is a Lifetime Channel style, limp biography that suffers from an insipid script and even worse direction.  Poppy Montgomery, and definitely Joanne Rowling, deserved better than this. Rowling has changed the literary world (and film world) in so many ways there is no telling when or where her influence will stop. This biopic can't seem to wrap its arms around that, and settled for a slapdash treatment that aimed more at ""just get something out there to capitalize on this Harry Potter thing,"" than delve beneath the superficial.",1407369600,,635,4.990566037735849

Also, there is a small problem/break in the timeline.  Suddenly, without introduction, J.K. Rowling has a husband.  Seemed oddly scripted to me.",1406246400,,313,4.849056603773585

4656234,1,B005D0RDU2,"HORRIBLE ACTING!!!  I thought that this was a documentary on JK Rowling and her harry potter stories.  But to my GREAT dissappointment, it was a movie depicted by terrible acting actors portraying JK Rowling and the people whom she worked with to came up with her stories.  I couldn't even sit through this whole thing, it was so painful watching this!  The acting was so terrible and seems like all of the actors were a bunch of amateurs student actors.  All of the expressions and their acting skills screams, ""you are trying too hard.""  All of the scenes and acting expressions and lines spoken seemed so forced and unnatural.  Real people don't talk like that or give reactions like that.  Who ever was responsible for casting the actors should be fired on the spot.  And I don't see any of the actors in this movie making it further than this terrible movie.  JK Rowling would have a heart attack if she were to watch this.  Don't waste your time or money (if you have to pay for it), to watch this.  SKIP!! SKIP!!  SKIP!!

Some of you reading this might think that I am being too harsh, well I am not.  If someone was brave enough to try and touch something so huge like JK Rowling and Harry Potter, they should be prepared and do a better job.  Don't try to run a 5K marathon if you can't even walk 1 mile!  And I hate that they try to disguise the ""movie"" in the form of a documentary.  The way that this title was marketed and categorized was in the documentary category...this is clearly NOT a documentary.  I would much rather see a real documentary of this topic than to watch this movie.

This title deserves ZERO stars.  But Amazon makes me put a minimum of 1 star.  So this is one star more than this title deserves.  Terrible acting and deceiving titles do not get any rewards in my book.",1406073600,3,1804,4.38368580060423

The other part of this that I really did find interesting was the number of literary agents and publishers passed on Harry Potter.  I might have to jump off a tall building once I realized I passed on a writer that would have made me hundreds of millions of dollars.",1403740800,,529,4.0673076923076925

4656414,5,B005D0RDU2,"This was a wonderful way to show how Ms. Rowling went from a single mother on 'the dole' to the inspiring woman she is today. I love the Harry Potter series - both books and movies, even if some of the directors took a lot of liberty with some of them. If all of the events in the movie are true, one can see where some of the inspiration for the smaller elements in the series came from.

As an aspiring writer myself, I could relate to the angst of writing and publishing the first book. So glad she stuck with it. Watching this gives me that nudge I need to crack open that book file again and get busy.",1403222400,,606,4.05

The acting is suburb - a lot of times these bio stories are not done very well, not in this case. The story really is very inspiring - gave me the incentive to follow my dreams --- and what i love to do the most. Not many young girls get that message - just as she did NOT get it as a young girl....but she went after it!

If you're a fan of the Harry Potter world this will nostalgically appeal in a lot of ways as Rowling's character in the movie is writing her book. Technically and Production value, it leaves a lot to be desired, but otherwise entertaining if there's nothing else to see. In the end, give it a go.",1402444800,4,398,4.391891891891892

It's the first movie we've watched at our little cabin up north in Michigan (where TV reception is limited to 6 channels - 2 of them cooking and 1 weather!).  My husband and I both liked this film and it wasn't too ""girly"" for him (he's a big Harry Potter fan).

Being of the older generation, who would have thought that a book intended for young children would be added to our watch list. After watching this movie of the author's life and her writing the books that would captured the Imagination of the children of the world, it also captured ours as well. We are now looking forward to the viewing of some Harry Potter movies taken from the author's writing. What a delightful story her life was, from the beginning of only a dream and the determination of a young girl to do what she felt was her purpose in life. A rise from poverty to one of the richest women in the world. The riches she accumulated were not only monetary, but all she had always hoped for in life.

The post office representing the bank of gringotts and the trolls stamping the papers, to ron weasley from her childhood friend sean. Loved it all, was really reeled in and experienced it with her.  Harry Potters books and movies are a family treasure that will last for centuries i think. I'v read the books many times and have all the DVD's.

I liked it cause it went back in her days and I love movies like that can't go wrong also made me cry when her mom got sick and passed. But it's a must watch in my eyes.",1400803200,,477,3.9791666666666665
4656484,4,B005D0RDU2,I really enjoyed watching and finding out more about the life of Ms Rowling struggle to her fame to her books,1400716800,,109,4.238095238095238

4656486,5,B005D0RDU2,I have been curious about this story as soon as I started reading Harry Potter back when it came out. It was so truly imaginative and I love Harry Potter and the freedom of dreams it embraces. The first book is my favorite because it was so new to me. I totally enjoyed reading about Rowling and her life that sprang out of the everyday scenario and into a world of freedom to continue to write about her dreams while thrilling her readers with fantasties beyond anything I've ever considered.,1400716800,,493,4.488888888888889
4656487,4,B005D0RDU2,I was a good story.  Especially for a Harry Potter fan which my house certainly is.  My husband did not enjoy it as much as me.,1400630400,,127,3.8461538461538463
4656488,4,B005D0RDU2,I didn't think it was going to be a feature I thought it would be more documentary but I was pleasantly surprised when the screen writing and acting seemed accurate in depicting the actual life of JK Rowling. Really spot on.,1400630400,,224,4.487804878048781
4656489,4,B005D0RDU2,"The acting in the movie wasn't the best, but I wanted to watch this movie simply because it was the story of one of my favorite authors.  I love the Harry Potter books. Some consider it a children's book (which maybe it is, but not entirely), but i enjoy the books for their ability to take me to another world.

This movie was amusing (it had many HP references in it and computer graphics that are reminiscent of Harry's world) and if you don't pick apart everything about the movie is entertaining.  I had read a background on her, but did not know the whole story.  It was nice to see that.",1400630400,,594,4.276785714285714
4656490,1,B005D0RDU2,Absolute garbage. And I normally love all things Harry Potter related but this was so bad. Don't bother trying to watch it.,1400544000,3,123,4.636363636363637
4656491,4,B005D0RDU2,"I'm not even a Harry Potter fan but the name JK Rowling is known world wide so I was curious.  I loved the story, especially with Poppy Montgomery playing JK Rowling.  It reminds us each how we can overcome but so often, just may not have the fight and energy or the passion we sometimes misplace in our lives. What did you want to be when you were younger that you have lost along the way of living?",1400371200,,400,4.115384615384615

4656498,3,B005D0RDU2,Not that interesting. Could be the actors. You'd think it would be a little more entertaining. Don't know how much is true.,1400284800,,123,4.636363636363637
4656499,5,B005D0RDU2,"Really enjoyed the movie.  It is such an interesting tale and well written and acted.  Sounds like a fairy story but how wonderful to think that it really did happen and that Ms Rowling persevered with hardship and came out winning the hearts of millions of children (and adults) with her books.  Better still, she's still writing!",1400284800,,331,4.771929824561403
4656500,4,B005D0RDU2,"I had originally thought that this was a documentary but it turns out to be a work of fiction with the various roles played by actors.  Overall, watching this show is an ok way to spend an hour and a half.  There is a certain amount of historical perspective provided in terms of Rowlings rise to fame which is interesting.  The content of the show is hardly investigative journalism at its best but worth viewing nonetheless.",1400284800,,426,4.578947368421052

4656503,4,B005D0RDU2,"I found this story about JK ROWLING very well done.  It was detailed about her history leading to writing
the Harry Potter series.  Insights into her life and reasons she became a writer were done well and very interesting.
Her struggles with marriage and family helped to understand how difficult it was for her to commit to writing.
The acting was believable and well done. I particularly enjoyed the actress who played Rowling.",1400112000,,430,4.876712328767123

4656518,5,B005D0RDU2,I found this to be a great story because it shows how one can still make it in the world and become successful even after all else fails. Also that a woman if she is determined and has a family can take care of her family herself by continuing to work hard and never give up.,1399939200,,275,3.9285714285714284
4656519,3,B005D0RDU2,"This film is a ""Made For TV"" piece and for that, it's not bad.

4656538,4,B005D0RDU2,"This movie is an unauthorized biography of J. K. Rowling that was shown on Lifetime network.  It is done in a recollection theme where it starts in a limo at an event after she has just become world famous and she thinks back to her beginnings.

It then gives background and shows it shaped her and lead to the writing of the Harry Potter books.  I've only seen the movies and haven't read the books but I found it interesting/entertaining.  I won't get more specific because I don't think there is any additional insight that would warrant spoilers.  That said if you already know everything there is to know about the subject matter and/or don't like Lifetime movies you may want to steer clear because this is typical of made for TV movie genre.

In addition, it was free with an Amazon Prime subscription so no extra cost beyond that $99 to rent it so that means no complaint related to rental fees.  If I did have to pay extra I would not have seen the movie.  So you can take that into consideration before take the time to watch it.",1399766400,,1039,4.403141361256544

With that in mind, she was really in awe watching this.. to see that the creator of such a series is ,as we are, a muggle, this story truly captures the essence of writers and the struggle it takes to be noticed in the literary world. Going through the movie gives the viewer a humbling perspective of JK Rowling and the many ideas that shaped characters of the Harry Potter universe.

Low budget films rarely reach the peak of the quintessential box office hit, but low budget aside this was a great film.
With the material available I believe that the director got the most out of J.K. Rowling's story. J.K. Rowling's life as portrayed in the film allows the viewers to feel both compassion and empathy as J.K. Rowling is bullied in school, told she should choose a practical career, her mother develops a deadly disease, her father marries his secretary, her husband is abusive, and the government keeps her in a point of no return. Pure elation is felt as soon as foreshadowing tells us that her book will be read when it is first sent in, because if the book is read it will not be put down and millions have now experienced this very phenomenon.",1398902400,,859,4.620915032679738

4656602,4,B005D0RDU2,"I'm so glad I decided to watch this, in fact I actually watched it twice back to back. First by myself then again with my 14 yr. old daughter who is a big fan of J.K. Rowling's work and an aspiring writer herself.  She thought it would be boring but was soon caught up in the story and engaged in interesting conversation with me about it while the story unfolded. What I found most appealing and inspiring about it is how a single mom struggling with the system, as I , never gave up on her art. When she decided to follow her heart and do what makes her happy everything came together. As her mom told her, when the time was right  with hard work and tenacity the words came. Good for her to do it and become so wealthy in just three years. That's a story we all need to hear and it spoke to me particularly as I plan to do something with my life long passion for writing songs. I'm grateful to those who made it even though it was an unofficial biography and I was skeptical about the quality at first. For those of us who do not have the support and encouragement from their family like J.K. Rowling did according to this story, the movie is motivating. Therefor I am thankful to then and You Rock Rowling!",1398643200,,1210,4.1888412017167385

4656623,5,B005D0RDU2,"It was so exciting to see JK Rowling's story and follow her through her years in writing Harry Potter. I watched it twice because that's how much I liked the movie. The first time around I missed the text at the beginning of the film that said it was based on an unauthorized autobiography of her life, so that was somewhat disappointing to know afterwards. However, it doesn't take away from it being a great story and I think it does hit on the major points of JK Rowling's life before, during, and after Harry Potter, even if not all the details were the same. Her life struggles are ones people face everyday and it's inspiring to know that she took a chance doing what she loved so she could be happy (not to mention she achieved great success doing it). I commend her for all that she has achieved with mainly her passion for writing.

I recommend this movie to any Harry Potter fan!",1398384000,,889,4.387878787878788

4656629,5,B005D0RDU2,"This biography of JK Rowling was well done, although it is not approved by Rowling. It seems credible in light of what I have heard about her prior to watching this biography. She is certainly an impressive lady - her ability to imagine and fabricate Harry Potter's world of wizardry and write it all down. I am in awe of such people - it is a natural gift. Her tenacity to overcome the pitfalls of life is equally impressive. She deserves all the money and fame accorded her. BTW, the film is well acted with an excellent screenplay.",1398211200,,534,4.459183673469388

It was actually quite good though. I'm sure the story was kind of boiled down to the key points and that JKR might be able to point out some discrepancies, but it was pretty well-acted and enjoyable, and it moved along at a good pace. Its also such an inspiring story ... its nice to see a person's life turn around like that, and her dreams come to life.",1398124800,,514,4.364583333333333

I am a huge fan, and loved what her books did for children and adults.  Reading was renewed through this author from a modest background.  The movie does a nice job of including some wonderful scenes in Edinburgh that inspired the Potter stories and inspirations.  The characters are cast with sympathy.  It is a charming story to watch including  painful and heart wrenching scenes.  Rowlings' difficult writing and personal journey is detailed along with painful parts of her life.

4656643,3,B005D0RDU2,"This movie tries so hard to be the female version of how Harry Potter's life really was. It starts with her and and her sister ""practicing magic"" in the woods with a boy who they convince must say magical words if he wants to go into the woods alone and come out alive. First day in a new school where they all wear uniforms the teacher says the first thing she must do is get you all ""sorted"". Then a chubby girl and her gaggle of friends is a bully to her just like the boys in the books are to Harry. Then she tells her best friend that he is so ""Weasely"". It's as though the story is telling you that Harry Potter was really JK Rowlings as a child. That she didn't really create the story from her imagination but basically embellished her own childhood. I've seen her interviewed on TV and she always says she made up the entire Harry Potter Story and never once have I heard her say she drew on her own childhood for exact story lines. I loved the Harry Potter books and movies and if it were created out of her own childhood as an outsider I would have no problem with that at all. But seeing as how this is an unauthorized biography it seems as though they are trying to throw as many of the Harry Potter story lines in there as possible. If you can get through the weak beginning its a cute story. It does start to get to be a rather enjoyable movie about halfway through the movie if you can last that long. Poppy Montgomery does a credible job of portraying JK Rowling. They really should have claimed that it was ""loosely"" based on JK Rowling instead of an ""unauthorized biography"". That would have made it much easier for me to accept this version of the story. I wasn't interested in watching this for a take off on Harry Potter but as more of a docudrama on JK Rowling's life. I didn't realize that unauthorized meant ""made up"". They should give her more credit for creating the world of Harry Potter and themselves credit for creating the make believe world of JK Rowling.",1397865600,,1988,4.275862068965517

4656678,1,B005D0RDU2,"This movie is just so incredibly stupid, I thought it had to be a joke of some kind.  Honestly, what were they thinking?  Ms. Rowling's story is really compelling and a real triumph over poverty.  It can be inspiring to some and perhaps less so to others.  It can be difficult to sympathize with someone who had to go to Eaton because Oxford wouldn't let her in.  Still, she was on welfare and had an abusive husband all of which she overcame and became one of the richest women in the world, so, generally, one could take some measure of inspiration from that.

This movie, however, will just make you want to throttle her, the director, the writers (using the term loosely) and everyone associated with it.  It's so incredibly bad.  I don't even know where to begin.  Look, made for TV movies are generally terrible, but this one aspires to be terrible.  At least the terrible ones are kind of campy and you can laugh at them.  This one just makes you sit in stunned horror.  The actors aren't bad they just have terrible material.  The harder aspects of Ms. Rowling's life are just glossed over and trivialized which is completely unacceptable.  It's been widely reported that she is not the nicest of people, but the movie makes her out to be this angel blessed with the gift of writing.  It's crap.  Total crap.  If you get it for free, no worries, if you don't save your money.",1397433600,2,1383,4.48995983935743

4656684,4,B005D0RDU2,"The acting wasn't anything to write home about (pun intended) but the story is inspiring and uplifting, which is what saved it. This is an unauthorized biography of J.K.

The beginning and end feel contrived, but hell, a great watch none the less that will make you feel good.",1397174400,,392,4.614285714285714

Found this to be even better than I thought it might be. It's not a dry writing bio. but a real woman with doubts, fears, and life's obstacles that many,many, people face now.

We had both heard the story that Ms. Rowling was homeless and lived in her car at one point. The story explores her personal situation and, at one time Ms. Rowling is shown as homeless after her marriage broke up, but a car never entered the picture. The best part was how (spoiler alert) the movie shows her as having a vivid imagination since early childhood and how she utilizes that imagination to develop the characters most of the movie watching world has come to love. It is worth the time to view if you are a Harry Potter story fan and wish to learn more about the creator.",1397001600,,681,4.412698412698413

JK Rowling is an amazing woman, with an amazing career and a fantastic heart and this story is done with more taste and class than a lot of other biopics I've seen.  It's kid-friendly and paints a very positive and uplifting picture of her life.

It was clearly produced for TV production and I gave it a 'Liked It' instead of 'Loved It' because they didn't cut it to a continuous running movie after removing the commercials.  The breaks were disruptive and affected the continuity of the movie.

My wife and I are 'Possibility Thinkers' and this film exemplifies following one's passion and the gifts will follow.  We would recommend this to everyone who has ever had a Dream.  Just follow watching it with some Action.",1396915200,,523,4.766666666666667

However, sometimes the way it jumped forward and backward left you feeling like some important pieces were missing somehow.  I liked the storyline and think the movie did a good job of giving you a great feel for the characters but it just left me wishing there was more at the end.  I wish they would have continued a bit further and showed more about her life after the success.",1396915200,,472,4.402298850574713

4656702,4,B005D0RDU2,"I can't give this made-for-TV movie five stars, as that would be perfection. In fact, Magic Beyond Words may warrant more like 3.5 stars. Yet, as a lifelong creative person, this movie did cause my cheeks to become wet a few times. I do, in fact, recommend this movie highly. My less-than-five-star review is not based on content or emotion, but on the made-for-TV feel, and some minor production concerns. To have given this film five stars would have been unfair to the movies that make your jaw drop to the floor. Aspiring artists will be especially moved by this work.",1396828800,,572,4.673267326732673

The English Government makes no sense on their poverty level and how you can't get off assistance cause you will make too much.  Its like they encourage you to stay on welfare.

It was pleasant to watch without too much hyped emotional tricks.  The heroine, although occasionally foolish, was a nice person doing her best and ultimately successful.

4656739,4,B005D0RDU2,"It was a really good movie--very engaging and well acted. Given that the audience undoubtedly includes children (my 10 year old watched  it first, then asked me to watch it with her), some of the content is more appropriate for older audiences, like the depiction of domestic violence, which frightened my daughter.  I suppose the feeling was that it was important to be truthful about the depictions of turning points in Jo Rowling's life, and that it was worth it.  Perhaps, but still uncomfortable viewing with children.
My daughter's review:
Her life kind of explained parts of Harry Potter in really cool ways.  The movie was inspiring in ways that are inexplicable.  I admire JKRowling.  I've always loved writing and now I love it even more.  Harry Potter feels real to me. I recommend this movie but its true that I closed my eyes for 1 part. Harry Potter is part of me.",1396051200,3,878,4.699346405228758

I love anything Harry and life's been a little on the dreary side since Rowling's last Harry book has come and gone. In short, Harry Potter fans everywhere would LOVE this movie. It's very well done and I loved how the filmmakers incorporated lots of little items that might have inspired her work in writing the books--from the little diamond-argyle shaped box she kept the book in (inside lining of each HP book is that same pattern), to more overstated sequences where candles are floating in their air as she's working and imagining it all. It's a real-life rags to riches story of the life of the woman who brought Harry Potter into being and it really can't get any better than this. Whether you're a young writer looking to be inspired, or a mom who's grown up with Harry Potter as a child and enjoys sharing the stories with your own children now--this movie will move you. You'll laugh, cry, and cheer. For a feel-good movie night, do yourself a favor and watch this!! And then go back and re-read the books!

4656756,5,B005D0RDU2,"I have to admit that I honestly didn't realize what this movie was all about when I first started watching it - picking it merely because I saw it alongside the other Harry Potter films - but found it surprisingly very interesting and entertaining at the same time! I had no idea about the life of JK Rowling, and her actual background. I'm not sure how much of it is completely true about her personal life in this film, but if it was an accurate account of her real life story, it was just wonderful! It certainly explains how she came up with each of the characters for her Harry Potter series. Each person in her life played an integral part in her story writing, and ties together her thought process in creating such a wonderful story for children as well as many adults world-wide! I truly enjoyed it and the choice of actors to portray each character were also well selected! I was captivated from beginning to end, but then again, I love anything to do with Harry Potter and this is a MUST SEE for my fellow ""addicts.""",1395705600,,1027,4.410526315789474

4656766,5,B005D0RDU2,Liked the actors and the plot.  Kept you interested and that's good enough for me.  Ms. Rowling made her mark in history and is still writing.  We need more JK Rowlings in this world and more good children's books.,1395446400,,214,4.435897435897436
4656767,5,B005D0RDU2,"This was a awesome movie I have always wondered how Harry Potter came to the mind of J.K.Rowling, it is truly magical. It is amazing to see how a writer comes to write wonderful stories, I was also surprised to see that she had all seven of the books partially written before the publication of the first, guess that is what great writers do. She had a real tough life struggling single mom, she was just so determined and yet patient about writing, and then it all paid off for her. I would recommend this movie to anyone, if you think ""Oh its just another biography"" watch it and she what you think, you will be surprised.",1395446400,,624,4.3418803418803416

4656769,5,B005D0RDU2,"JK Rowling is an example of what a determined person can do with their life.  She is a wonder of this world.  The missing parts that were not there was the research she done to create this series.  Harry Potter is not just a kids story.  There is psychology, philosophy, mythology, creative art and read between the lines messages that teats the mind.",1395446400,,351,4.523809523809524

4656775,4,B005D0RDU2,I like Poppy Montgomery.  I felt she did a good job with her portrayal of JK Rowling.  I know there is so much more to Ms Rowling's life and I would be interested to see her autobiography.,1395360000,,188,4.054054054054054

4656777,3,B005D0RDU2,I didn't know it was going to be a dramatization of J.K. Rowlings life. I thought it was going to be more documentary style movie based more on the path of the books and movies with interviews with real people,1395360000,,209,4.25
4656778,4,B005D0RDU2,"I really enjoyed this movie. It's nice to know how Ms. Rowling rose from the bottom to the top. It goes to show you that talent and skill could be hidden anywhere or where you least expect it. It also shows that even if you come from a ""good"" family that you can still hit rock bottom (well, almost, in her case). I liked how it showed that you can be courageous and also how you need to never give up on your dreams. I know I'm talking about the story/person and not the movie. Regarding the movie itself, I liked the movie a lot. It was an eye-opening to me. I had no idea who JK Rowling was, I only knew how much I loved every single book and how it was hard to let go at the end of the last one.",1395273600,,699,3.861111111111111

4656784,5,B005D0RDU2,"For anyone who has ever read the Harry Potter books, to come to know their creator even a little bit is such a treat.  Joann Rowling wanted to do only one thing:  to write.  Once she started writing there was no stopping her.  Determination incarnate.  And the wonderful part is that...well that would be giving away the end of the movie, wouldn't it?  You'll just have to see it for yourself.",1395187200,,393,4.464788732394366

I knew that JK Rowling wrote Harry Potter while homeless with her kid and then struck it rich, but the rest of it was news to me. No wonder people admire her so much. She's got a very interesting history, and despite knowing that she gets a happy ending, you still are surprisingly happy for her by the end.

Her father wanted her to be practical and get a job to support herself and her mother encouraged her in what ever she wanted to do. She was smart enough to divorce her abusive husband and I am so glad the divorce was final before she became rich and famous. She has given the world more than a series of books.

4656807,4,B005D0RDU2,I had no idea of the life story of JK Rowling and was amazed and touched by this A&E network movie.  I have not read the Harry Potter books but one of my closest friends is a published author so this story showed me how difficult it is to encourage publishers to read a book and agree to publish it.  I have seen one or two of the Harry Potter movies and they are wonderfully well done.  In this age of eBooks I think that publishers need to pay closer attention to other well written books.  This A&E movie was quite touching and shows the spirit of a woman who writes so well and still had difficulty getting her work published.  It shows that persistence and the backing of family members and inner strength can overcome anything.  I really enjoyed this movie.,1394928000,,763,4.338028169014085

Well, here I am still awake and righting  a review  which is a rarity as this is only the 2nd time I have written a movie review.  Poppy Montgomery did an excellent job. I only gave  the movie 4 stars because even though I thoroughly enjoyed the movie I would not pay to sxee it a theater, purchase the Bluesy/DVD, nor would I have payed anything over a dollar to rent it.

However, be warned... it is a 'made for television' production in the style of the Lifetime network. That means that the only character drawn with any depth is Rowling herself. The rest of the characters are what I like to call 'Lifetime' stereotypical - men are generally bad unless they are being supportive of women / women are generally fun loving and caring and always supportive of one another. Moreover the production value of this movie is quite poor, and the direction left much to be desired technically. However, I gave it 3 stars instead of 2 which was my initial reaction, because upon reflection there are some decent performances in it by the actors.",1394668800,6,777,4.8059701492537314

All & all it seems like an honest journey through the important events of Rowling's life.
As nicely done as it is, it remains on a level of nice. It just feels that something is missing

She is very cool and it's great to learn about her life.

4656829,3,B005D0RDU2,I started watching this but it just didn't grab me. To be honest I wasn't sure what it was supposed to be. At first I thought it was an autobiography but something about it just seemed made up so I stopped watching.,1394409600,,215,4.142857142857143
4656830,1,B005D0RDU2,"You see this movie and you're like, ""Oh cool, it's a Harry Potter documentary!"" But then you realize its not a documentary, it's a dramatization and it's a Lifetime Original movie. And it sucks.",1394323200,5,194,4.735294117647059

4656838,3,B005D0RDU2,"It was a nice way to pass the time and also get a mini-boost for a struggling writer, but as a writer it wasn't as magical as I expected a story about a woman who constructed perhaps one of the best magical worlds ever.",1394323200,,219,4.0
4656839,3,B005D0RDU2,Not a bad story if you want the basics. I would watch it again but not at top of my list.,1394236800,,89,3.2857142857142856
4656840,4,B005D0RDU2,I am not a big Harry Potter fan so that is not why I watched the movie.  I really wanted to see who was behind all this magic...so to speak.  The movie is well done and provides some great insight into how she struggled before making it big.  Great success story and well worth watching.,1394236800,,287,4.181818181818182
4656841,4,B005D0RDU2,"O.K. so this is a simply simple pleasure.  A life compacted into 1 hour and 20 minutes.  How truthful it is, I don't know, but it sure is a nice way to spend a few minutes.  It flies by like a good game of quidditch.  Only for the Potterphile.  It is pretty fluffy. Available on Amazon Prime members for free.",1394236800,,309,4.083333333333333
4656842,5,B005D0RDU2,This was a very inspiring story or a woman who was disconnected in so many ways yet very connected intuitively. I was surprised by the struggles she endured and felt happiness to know that her mother was such a great inspiration to her. Good story and short enough to feel guilt free watching it.,1394236800,,296,4.5

I was told that the books go into a deeper darkness with each book.  That I don't know about because I didn't read the books.  I'm not interested in that.  I am more interested in knowing about the person behind the words, who wrote of a book.  This movie is a very good movie to watch.  Many women all across America will be able to relate to Ms. Rowling's life.  I think everyone should watch this movie.  It is inspiring and could possibly encourage many, many young mothers.",1394150400,2,595,4.345454545454546

4656850,5,B005D0RDU2,Always interesting to see how a writer starts off before they are famous. This movie does just that. Gives you a peek at what Jo Rowling was before she created what made her famous.,1394064000,,181,4.352941176470588
4656851,4,B005D0RDU2,Great movie about the author but not enough about her creative process. I would have like to see where she got the intricate story lines because a lot of the background characters and stories are more than average and require lots of research. She didn't seem to have the time to do that when writing the first and second books.,1394064000,,328,4.483333333333333

Inspiring to watch and the acting was incredible, even the child actors were impressive. Great for all ages (in my opinion) even though there were a few parts that may need some parental hugs around.

Watch and feel the magic!",1394064000,,353,4.430769230769231

4656858,3,B005D0RDU2,"Entertaining movie. Typical biopic that hits only the major events. Does not reveal any deep insight into why she wrote, or why she didn't for such a long time. But still it was interesting if you know nothing about her.",1393977600,,220,4.525

4656861,5,B005D0RDU2,"What a nice surprise to see this is an actual movie about JK Rowling's life, not just a documentary.  Very interesting and I enjoyed watching it and continue to be amazed by her instant (after all her hard work and finally being published) fame.  I was teaching 3 & 4th graders at the time an many of them began their love of reading have this book available.

4656863,5,B005D0RDU2,"I loved every part of this true story and the casting and acting was prefect. Following your natural gifts is the only way to live. We all don't become monetarily wealthy, but we are at peace doing what we love.",1393891200,,211,4.3

4656870,2,B005D0RDU2,"Liked the story of her rise to fame, but the constant reminding of how things related to the books she wrote was very heavy handed and likely not factual like her playing in witches outfits. I fast forwarded some of it but did want to see her become famous.",1393891200,,257,4.26530612244898
4656871,5,B005D0RDU2,Inspiring story for anyone trying to live their dream. JL Rowling is an amazing story teller. This was so wonderful to watch about her life and how Harry Potter came to be.,1393891200,,172,4.40625

4656876,4,B005D0RDU2,"Had a very good air of mystery and kept me on edge wondering what would happen next.
Have only view the first show but, reminded me a lot of the tv series ""Lost"".
Sincerely hope the writers have answers for all the questions raised and not be like the
""Lost"" tv series that kept leading you on and on and then nothing.  It would be very disappointing.

The above mention was not meant for ""Air of Mystery"",  my bad.

Now that having been said, ""Air of Mystery"" was revealing not knowing anything about J.K. Rowling.
It was a fascinating biography and good to see how doing something you love can pay off in the end.  I understand Walt Disney had a similar life story.  Sticking to what you believe in.",1393804800,,701,4.3538461538461535

4656883,5,B005D0RDU2,"Both the story and the acting are amazing. It demonstrates how our society is still biased against the women and their potential.

4656888,5,B005D0RDU2,"This is an uncritical feel good story about JK Rowling and the Harry Potter phenomenon. It should be titled ""Good things happen to nice people"", what comes across strongly is just how sweet and how nice JK Rowling is. The inspiration for many of her characters is striking, particularly touching is the ""Trolley Cart Lady"" with the ""liver&tripe"" flavored licorice cheering her up during one of her ""down"" moments.

Many authors have difficulty breaking into the business, finding a for real literary agent and hooking up with a publisher who is willing to go all out on a first book is almost always ""a bridge too far"", while Ms. Rowling did have some level of rejection and frustration in getting the first book published her experience was relatively gentle compared to other authors. She had incredible good luck in finding an agent who actually represented her faithfully and excellent timing in finding a publisher willing to take a chance on an unknown author's first book. Highly recommended.",1393718400,,999,4.982035928143713
4656889,4,B005D0RDU2,I am a middle aged fan of the Harry Potter series. Both the books and movies. So I was very interested in the J. K. Rowling's story. Now the movie has a disclaimer that states it's an unauthorized biography. So I accept that there may have been some incidents added for dramatic effect. But I assume for the most part it's pretty much how things evolved in her rise to success. Having said this I admit I enjoyed the movie and was very moved with her story. It is truly a magical success fable.,1393718400,,494,4.26595744680851
4656890,5,B005D0RDU2,"This was an outstanding portrayal of outstanding author who in real life actually did go through extreme adversity and emerged from those very rough times to success that is a magical as her stories.  That she is still writing is a thrilling thought.  She repeated her resounding success with each Harry Potter book.  I hope she has more magical characters on paper soon!  I want to meet them!

4656892,4,B005D0RDU2,"I enjoyed this movie quite a bit more than I'd expected to.  I'm a Harry Potter fan, but I'm never been intensely interested in JK Rowlings life story.  But even without the Harry Potter connection this would have been an interesting movie and with the connection it became quite a bit of fun to watch.  I'd recommend it for the HP crowd.  It's better than I'd expected.",1393632000,,370,4.477611940298507

4656900,3,B005D0RDU2,"I couldn't stand it after about 20 minutes or so, it just was so slow and boring.  But it was fascinating to see J.K. in her youth and her preoccupation with witches and the mystical. I thought the casting was great.",1393545600,,216,4.2682926829268295
4656901,1,B005D0RDU2,"I spend more time listening to movies than watching them. I generally find it a nice distraction while doing mundane tasks around the house. That said, I let this movie go on for about 15 minutes before I realized I was feeling irritable and cranky so I turned it off. I don't know if it was the continuous whining or the British accents that put me over the edge.. JK Rowling probably hated it too.",1393545600,,399,4.333333333333333
4656902,4,B005D0RDU2,This film proves that you can succeed if you are willing to work hard and stay focused. An inspiring rags to riches story.,1393545600,,122,4.3478260869565215
4656903,5,B005D0RDU2,initially i thought it was a documentary of the author of harry potter and i wanted to stop the movie because it seamed to be boring. but as the movie went on it got better and better. i though it was a great story and would love to see it again,1393545600,,245,3.823529411764706

A wonderful movie for a Friday or Saturday night.

I love the way we see a person transform into who she was always meant to be, and the subtleties of those things around her of which inspired her writings and the world of Harry potter by quite simply having been near her when and where she chose to write. It is truly magical! I could not watch this movie without a smile nor a tear. It's amazing what perseverance and dreaming big can do, but also a wonderful and real illustration of getting that one big chance in life; whether it's from someone lending you a helping hand, believing in you, fighting for you, pushing you, or backing you. It can make all the difference when applied. If this story teaches us anything, it's that we should pay it forward and always live with respect and integrity towards others around us, as you never know the person next to you could very well be the next J.K.Rowling.

It was wonderful to see how the ideas came to her and it made me want to read the all books over again (for the umpteenth time).

I have read the Harry Potter series through 7 1/2 times so far, and I gain new insights, new understanding, and real pleasure with each rereading.  No other books have so fed my imagination.  This movie is a delight.  To try and add more would have created a film that was unwieldy and overly long.  I highly recommend this movie and all the Potter books (though Professor Snape perhaps would not!).  I cannot make the same recommendation for the movies, for they are like totally different and incomplete stories.  See this movie and read the books.

Sure, there were a few interesting tidbits, but, again, nothing was delved into in any great detail.  There were a lot of gaping holes to the story.",1392422400,2,601,4.4363636363636365

I was going to give this less stars than I did until I realized this is a Lifetime movie...which explains why the quality barely reached up and touched mediocrity.

This gives a loose outline of Rowling's life, nothing exciting, not much detail. Typical conflict and climax of a lifetime feature.

4657095,3,B005D0RDU2,"The movie depicts events in JKRowlinga life as well as can be expected. It is not the events that irritated me. It was the sugar coating of HER. I have seen her in interviews and read about her. She never ever was this sweet, approachable woman as portrayed in the movie. Rather, she was always this arrogant, snarky person who thought she was the intellectual superior to everyone around her.
I anticipate someone saying, ' oh, so you know her ? Right.'
Well, i don't but as a fan of Harry Potter i was curious a out the author who created this magical world.
And that is what I found. An arrogant, albeit shy person who looks down her nose at everyone who does not meet her intellectual standards. When asked if she would make a follow up movie , she said, she had done enough for Daniel Radcliffe than to reward him more.
In an extensive interview with her, they took her back to the apt the state got her. She was condescending and hardly grateful for the help she received during that time, making fun of the place.
JKRowling may be brilliant . And i suppose we wish that the person who wrote these iconic books to be sweet, caring, approachable and modest. A nice fantasy.",1391990400,2,1178,4.408256880733945

4657100,5,B005D0RDU2,I was half expecting a documentary but this movie truly takes you along on an inspirational journey. I dare say JK Rowling has no idea how many lives she has changed with her writing and her own story. Truly inspirational stuff here.,1391817600,,233,4.571428571428571

4657102,5,B005D0RDU2,"As a writer myself, I wanted to watch this movie just because it had to do with another writer, but as the story played out it was a lesson in faith in oneself.

Knowing you want to be something as J wanted to be from the time she was little, but not knowing is what WE all go through. Whether you're a writer, singer, artist or engineering. Our gifts are given to us when we're small, but as adults it is up to us to remember and find ourselves all the while dealing with the lemons life throws our way.

Now in J's case not only did she make lemons with what was given to her (leaving her husband, going on aid and still trying to get a ""decent"") she put a little umph in it by still going after her dreams and not giving up.

Most of all, I love that she stayed humble. She stayed with the one thing she always wanted to do... write.

That is awesome and this movie was a great showcase of her life, struggles and a lesson to all of us. Don't give up. Use your gift and share it with the world.",1391817600,,997,3.97

My husband and I are huge HP fans and we almost turned this off midway through. But, the second half was a lot better than the first half. That's when the HP references kind of simmer down and you actually get to see Rowling as a person and her struggles. I wish the movie would have put SOME focus on her college years. I read in an article about how she loved those years and I watched this movie with the hope that it'd contain some of those years. But nope! She goes off to college in one frame and is graduated the next. So that was disappointing for me. Overall, this movie isn't something that is must-see.",1373500800,3,769,4.273972602739726

It truly made things much more interesting. You also see how hard her life was and how she was able to go from being so very poor to one of the richest people in England.

Very clever how the movie shows the inspiration of parts of the story and characters--anyone familiar with either the Harry Potter books or movies will immediately recognize the significance and how Rowling translated the event in her life or imagination to the Harry Potter story.  Rowling was destined to be a writer, it was a passion from childhood and to go from a single mother on welfare to one of the richest women in England in three years is truly inspirational for anyone who wonders if they should give up their dream for something more ""practical.""  This would be a great gift for a Harry Potter fan or someone with a passion for writing.

Watching Rowling get her inspiration, and saying ""Hey! I recognize that from the movie!"" was such a good time. Honestly, there are few movies that make me laugh out loud, not out of amusement, but out of sheer, unadulterated joy. This movie was one of those movies. I wore a huge, cheesy smile on my face the entire movie and clapped my hands in delight more than once.
