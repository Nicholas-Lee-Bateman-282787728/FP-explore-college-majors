8343241,5,B0012VQ15E,"I used to LOVE to watch this show on A&E, as I work in car sales. I felt it was a pretty realistic view of what customers do not see behind the scenes in car dealership. I thought I had seen more episodes than what comes on this dvd set. I could be wrong. The episodes seem to come to a dead halt, but knowing some of the story behind the dealership this show followed, I realize there is a probability the dead halt was the end of the show. If you work in car sales and have not seen this show, you should. If you are thinking about buying/leasing a new or used car, you should watch this show and then take some pity as you go to the dealerships to spend your dear sweet time taking income away from the salespeople.",1373241600,,718,4.027972027972028
