obviously a heart warming film.",1039046400,2,89,4.625
572919,5,6303148255,This movie is based on a girl named Vada who has to do a report for school. The report is looking up someone who you have not met and has achieved something. So she looks up her mother and flies to L.A. With help she has a boy named Nick to help guide her around L.A. and to find information on her mother. While searching for information she has some trouble finding information and gets confused here and there but everything turns out to be okay. Its a great movie with some feeling in it. Its great for the whole family and is a pleasure to watch. Its just fun to watch. What are you waiting for? Don't hesitate and buy it!,999043200,2,627,4.147540983606557
572920,5,6303148255,"Although I love Macaulay Culkin (he's a great actor) I found I enjoyed MY GIRL 2 a whole lot better and more enjoyable than the first. In MY GIRL 2, Vada (Anna Chlumsky) is now 13 years old. Her father Harry (Dan Aykroyd) married Shelly (Jamie Lee Curtis), and Shelly is preganent with their first child together. Vada is trying to get through with the problems and confusions of being older, and soon be an older sister. She is also starting to learn about the relationships guys and girls have when they get older. She thinks a boy at her school likes her, but then it turns out he actually likes her friend, Judy. When Vada's English class gets an assignment to write a paper on somebody they admire - and it has to be somebody they never met - Vada decides to write about her mother, since she never knew her. Then Shelly gets the idea of having Vada fly off to Los Angeles, California to visit her Uncle Phil because her mother grew up in LA and Shelly thought she could learn more about her mother if she went down to LA. When Harry reclently lets her go on the trip, Vada meets Rose, Uncle Phil's girlfriend, and Rose's 13-year-old son, Nick (cutie, Austin O'Brien). Nick accompanies Vada on her search to find friends of her mother and other clues who could help her find out more about her mother, because Uncle Phil had paid Nick to help Vada out. But as their adventure goes on, Nick and Vada find a sweet romance where they never expected it in the least. Heartwarming, moving, and very excellent. I really do think this was better than MY GIRL because MY GIRL 2 was more fast-paste and much more energetic. If you loved MY GIRL, you will definitely love MY GIRL 2.",992131200,3,1677,4.395498392282958
572921,5,6303148255,"Usually sequels aren't as good as the original (although there are exceptions such as the Star Wars trilogy and the Back To The Future series), but this movie is much better than its predecessor, ""My Girl."" It is a warm and fuzzy family film with a great soundtrack featuring songs of the early 1970s. Vada is now 13, tackling a school assignment in which she decides to write about her mother's life. A trip to California to visit her uncle aids in her quest to track down her mother's high school classmates and friends. With each person she interviews, Vada makes some unexpected discoveries about her mother. Her search culminates in a touching, sadly sweet moment when she is able to ""meet"" her mother. Along the way, Vada finds love from Nick, (played by Austin O'Brien), her somewhat reluctant escort who was paid by Vada's uncle to accompany her around town. I love the fact that all of the primary actors were retained for the sequel (except for Macauley Culkin, whose character died in the first film). Jamie Lee Curtis and Dan Akroyd give fine performances as the happily married Mr. & Mrs. Sultenfuss expecting their first child. While ""My Girl"" was sad and depressing, ""My Girl 2"" is positive, upbeat, and great fun. Don't let that surly old curmudgeon, Leonard Maltin, influence you with his review. This film is great family entertainment and quite enjoyable.",986169600,40,1374,4.826271186440678
572922,5,6303148255,"I love these My Girl movies! I thought the 1st one was defenatly more sad than this one. Vada is now off to California on her own to vistit her uncle, his girlfriend and son, Nick who is Vada's age, 14. Nick takes Vada through the city of ange;\ls to find clues to her mother's history. Nice happy ending!",972691200,,305,4.186440677966102
572923,5,6303148255,"Pixie-ish spitfire Vada Sultenfuss has grown up quite a bit since the first film.  She's now thirteen years old, is no longer obsessed with death, and seems to have fully come to terms with the deaths of her mother  and best friend.  In the last film, Vada's father, Harry, got engaged to  Shelly.  In this one, they're married and Shelly is about eight months  pregnant with Harry Jr., and Vada seems okay with it.  Vada's a little  miffed that her father still doesn't seem to understand her passion for  writing, and she's worried that Shelly might die in childbirth like her own  mother did.  She also wants to know more about her mother.  ""I wish I  could see her just once, even if it were only in a dream,"" says Vada.  A school assignment to write about a person who's achieved something great,  who she's never met, prompts Vada to research her mother.  Her father,  unfortunately, had such a ""whirlwind courtship"" with the late  Maggie Muldovan-Sultenfuss that he can't tell Vada very much about her  mother.  ""Everything I know about her fits into one little box,""  Vada sadly tells Shelly, showing her stepmother a blank passport, some play  programs, and Vada's almost-empty baby book.  Shelly eagerly suggests that  Vada go to California to find out more about her mom--after all, that's  where Maggie grew up, and Vada's Uncle Phil lives there now.  Harry, after  a lot of arm-twisting, allows Vada to go, and she sets off on what becomes  a crazy one-week adventure.  Her uncle has a live-in relationship with his  boss, Rose, who has a son just Vada's age, Nick.  Nick is forced (bribed)  into being Vada's tour guide during her stay.  Together, they locate some  of Maggie's old classmates and teachers, many of whom remember Maggie  fondly and tell Vada she looks just like her mother did.  However, one of  the classmates reveals some disturbing information about Maggie's past,  which eventually leads Vada to someone who can actually show Vada her  mother--in the form of old films.  Vada is mesmerized by these films, and  she realizes that her mother's greatest achievment . . . was Vada.  This is  a sweet, bright, funny, and romantic film.  It's not as sad as the first  film, but it doesn't lack in the emotional department.  Anna Chlumsky  (Vada) delivers quite a different performance than she did in the first  one, and Austin O'Brien (Nick) is a fine Macaulay Culkin replacement.  (Culkin's character, Thomas J., is remembered in this film briefly, proving  that he is still a part of Vada's memory, but that she's moved on.)  Vada,  like in the first film, learns a lot about herself, and the ending leaves  the viewer with a sense that Vada's future looks bright.  Quite a change  from the Vada at the beginning of the first film, who was convinced she had  a chicken bone stuck in her throat. :)",958694400,10,2828,4.729338842975206
572924,5,6303148255,"Wow, I didn't think that a movie could be so touching.  From beginning to end, I was blown away by the determination of Vada to find out about her mother. Although I was born a decade after this movie takes place, I felt  that it depicted the late '60s and early '70s very well and there was such  a good feeling throughout the movie. The actors are amazing, especially  Anna Chlumsky. RECOMMENDED!",946339200,7,398,4.486111111111111
572925,5,6303148255,"I loved the first one, but I would have to say this movie is slightly better than the first since it is a little more moving and energetic.  The plot is also intriguing and original.  I thought it was fascinating how we  get a better look at Vada's mother's life, especially around the time when  she gives birth to her child.  While I have a feeling that Vada is going a  little too overboard on just a school project by flying to the other side  of the country to research (I hate research, the most I'll ever do is look  up a couple sites on the 'net!  Travel to another part of the world?  BLECH!) for her assignment, but it all turns out well and those just happen  to be 'very, very, special circumstances.'  I thought Vada and Nick's  relationship was a bit too much, they should have stayed just friends.  All  in all, it's a touching movie and indeed very original.",943747200,,874,4.308641975308642

573147,1,6303148255,"Seriously and truthfully, the only My Girl for me is always and forever and eternally the original. The sequel has infinitely many flaws that infinitely annoy me but most of all angers the you know what out of me!!!! I'll start out with Vada's dad and Shelly forcing out of her room which has been hers since she was a baby and not to forget the room that her late mother dedicated to her before she gave birth to Vada which also is one of her only gifts to her. Another flaw to this sequel is that Vada's new best friend Judy became such a backstabbing witch to her in the sequel. She was so nice to Vada in the original especially when Thomas J died. Now for the number one flaws of this sequel: the most horrible flaw of this sequel is that there wasn't any scene where Vada goes and visits Thomas J at his gravesite. That is the most heartbreaking flaw of this sequel. I was hoping with all my heart that Vada would bring flowers to Thomas J's grave and stay in front of it for a few minutes and talk to his spirit and tell him how her life has been going. Another flaw of this sequel is that jerk new boyfriend of Vada and how he makes fun of Thomas J's memory and the mood ring of Vada which he saved for her and died because of that and which is Vada's greatest memento of him. That new bf of hers said she was sorry but only to kiss her and be her bf. this movie not heartwarming at all. Whoever says that the sequel is better than the original is out of their minds!!!!!",1453852800,,1479,4.085910652920962

573247,4,6303148255,"The original My Girl from 1991 was a quality drama about a 10 year-old girl experiencing tragic death. In My Girl 2 shes now 13 and goes to Southern California to learn about her mother she never knew. Her companion is played by Austin O'Brien. Dan Aykroyd and Jamie Lee Curtis play her father and stepmother while Richard Masur and Christine Ebersole co-star as her uncle and potential aunt. The beautiful Angeline Ball has a small role as her mother in flashbacks.

This is just a solid drama, as good or better than the original. The adventures of the two 13 year-olds as they go from person to person searching for information about Vadas mother compels the story along. The people they meet are colorful or interesting. The peripheral subplots are good too, like will the Uncle propose to Rose or allow some rich dude with a Jaguar to snatch her up?

The film runs 99 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles, California, including Topanga Canyon.

573539,4,6303148255,"Picking up the story several years after the events of the first ""My Girl"" (a surprise worldwide sleeper hit in 1991), 1994's MY GIRL 2 reunites us once again with the irrepressible Vada Sultenfuss and her wacky family.

With new stepmother Shelley (Jamie Lee Curtis) heavily pregnant and the entire Sultenfuss household overtaken with baby plans, a pensive Vada (Anna Chlumsky) decides to investigate her own mother, who died during childbirth.  Shelley arranges for Vada to spend a vacation in Los Angeles with Uncle Phil (Richard Masur) and his new ""family"": Rose (Christine Ebersole) and her adolescent son Nick (Austin O'Brien).  It's a summer of discovery, soul-searching and heartache, as Vada uncovers her mother's past and the events which led to her own birth...

Anna Chlumsky again delivers a solid turn as Vada, settling the character nicely into the awkward teen years with great skill.  Jamie Lee Curtis and Dan Aykroyd (as Vada's parents) don't really figure into the plot this time but it's nice having them ""around"" anyway.  Austin O'Brien provides strong support as Vada's verbal sparring partner (much the same as Macaulay Culkin's Thomas J. from the first film); Masur and Ebersole undercut the possible sentimentality, always a problem in this sort of story.

Providing a fitting finale for Vada and the events of the first movie, MY GIRL 2 is that rare sequel which can stand proud against it's predecessor.

Veda is a young girl who is quite the tomboy and loves to spend time with her best friend, Thomas Jay. Her house is a funeral home, her father is a man who is dedicated to the dead and not falling in love again. In comes a young, sassy divorced make up artist who steals his heart and steals away Veda's daddy, so she feels. In this movie, a very young girl comes to terms with life, death, jealousy, and love.

In part two, Veda is a little older now and having to write an essay on someone who she never met that inspires her. She decides to learn about her mother, who died after giving birth to her. She is now going to be a big sister too! With much protest from her father, she flies to L.A to visit her Uncle and to learn about her mother.

The two embark to find who exactly was Vada's mom, was she loving? flighty? did she want to have a family? all these questions are answered and we learn a wonderful fact about her mother.

573590,4,6303148255,"""My Girl 2"" continues the story of Vada Sultenfuss and her family, set two or so years on from the original. It's a pretty good sequel, I thought.

Vada (Anna Chlumsky) is a little older and a little more sophisticated these days, it seems. She's not just writing poetry, she's reading it, her favorite poet being a certain Alfred Biedermeier. Her father's (Dan Aykroyd's) new wife (Jamie Lee Curtis) is due to have a baby, and soon Vada will be a big sister. In between school and home, she's trying to figure out boys, but hasn't quite got there yet.

At school, Vada is given an assignment. She has to write an essay on someone who she admires and has never met. She decides to write it on her mother, who died while Vada was still a baby. Vada knows virtually nothing about her mother, and decides to travel to California, where her mother went to school. She stays with her uncle, and with the help of a certain young man (Austin O' Brian) tracks down her mother's old friends. What Vada discovers shocks her, some of it disgusts and confuses her. Still, there are other discoveries that fill her with pride.

""My Girl 2"" is a little different to the first. In terms of the style of the film, it looks a little fresher, a little less dusty. Perhaps it's the California scenery, I don't know. It still has that retro feel, which is good (the film is set in the 1970s). Also, it feels a little more subdued. Vada/Anna isn't quite as hyper as she was in the first film, if that makes sense. She's still a great actress, and a shame she hasn't really been in anything lately.

Rather than being in a set few places, like the first film was, ""My Girl 2"" goes from one place to another, which kind of alters the way the film flows. I wouldn't say there is a lot of chemistry between Anna Chlumsky's ""love interest"" Austin O'Brien, but considering they're almost cousins-in-law that's probably not such a bad thing.

If you enjoyed the first film, ""My Girl 2"" is definitely worth picking up. A nice continuation of the story. Shame there wasn't a ""My Girl 3"", I reckon.",1157241600,,2067,4.443271767810026
573591,5,6303148255,"I rented ""My Girl 2"" after watching ""My Girl"" and I really enjoyed it. I liked how they got all of the same characters from the first movie, instead of getting all new actors and actresses, because I really hate when sequels are like that. Of course, they had to get a new boy for Vada to get to know since Thomas J. died in the first one, but for goodness sakes.....GET A BETTER NICK! AUSTIN O` BRIEN WAS NOT A GOOD ACTOR IN THIS MOVIE AT ALL! MACALUAY CULKIN WAS SO MUCH BETTER THAN HE WAS. HIS HAIR WAS EXTREMELY TOO LONG, HIS MAKE-UP LOOKED TERRIBLE WHEN HE WAS ABOUT TO KISS VADA, AND HE JUST...WAS NOT A GOOD ACTOR! THERE ARE PLENTY OF BETTER YOUNG ACTORS OUT THERE THAT I WOULD HAVE CHOSEN OVER AUSTIN O` BRIEN. HE IS JUST NOT THE TYPE OF PERSON THAT I WOULD HAVE PICKED FOR THE PART OF NICK. Other than that, I really enjoyed it.. it was a sweet movie full of laughter, happiness, romance among Vada and Nick at the end of the movie and both of them getting to be cousins and I also liked how Vada finally got to know some more information about her mother. I also liked how this movie was not as sad as the first one. Overall, I would definetely recommend at least renting this movie if not going ahead and buying it.",1145664000,3,1226,4.133891213389122
573652,3,6303148255,"I saw both these movies on Cable.  Predictable, but fairly well acted fare.  Fairly realistic view of life and relationships from the young Ms. Chlumsky's character.  Dan Akroyd and Jamie Lee Curtis also star, but, it's Ms. Chlumsky's vehicle.  Try to catch both movies on cable - Then go out and buy it - the early seventies live again in film!!

573654,4,6303148255,"I have to say, I have loved every Anna Chlumsky film ever made. So maybe I'm partial to giving her movies good reviews, but who didn't love her in ""My Girl?"". I know probably the first of the two is mostly everyones favorite.. However, the 2nd one was my personal favorite.

We get to watch Vada growing up..well already grown-up somewhat. We watch her go off to California in search of finding out everything about her mother for a school report on ""Someone you've never met"". She finds out some good, some bad-- she discovers achievements & disappointments. But her biggest discovery is herself. She finds out who she is, where she came from, accepts a new sibling, and meets a boy along the way. This is a great film not only for teens but for anyone of any age. So get lost, and rediscover yourself in ""My Girl 2"".",1130889600,5,818,4.453333333333333
573655,3,6303148255,"Three years after the original My Girl, and bringing back most of the original characters, and introducing some new ones is My Girl 2. With rumours of a My Girl 3, to possibly bring Anna Chlumsky back into showbusiness, it's always best to review these movies the way they were meant to be: good!

The thing that really gets me about this movie is Austin O'Brien. He's just not the kinda guy that I would be swooning over. Earrings are a barbaric custom?! Excuse me?! Why on earth did they include THAT line. The guy needed a serious hair cut before any sort of swooning should be done. I definitely reckon they should have brought back Thomas J (Macaulay Culkin). I don't care if he died in the first movie, movies do anything these days.

To me, the first one was always the best, although the second one has a lot more depth to it. Vada's first love will probably always be Thomas J, and lets face it, no one forgets their first love.

This sequel can stand well on its own, without the need of having to have seen the first to understand. Sure, there are some references to Thomas J. It's still as sad as the first one, with Vada 'seeing' her mother, and you feel like crying at that point. Feel like being the appropriate words - I cry at the first one every time I watch it, and get teary at the second.

If you're wondering about the song that Vada's mother sings, it's called ""Smile (Though Your Heart Is Breaking)"", and there are a few versions out there by Lyle Lovett & Natalie Cole. The full lyrics go like this:

Smile, though your heart is breaking

Smile, even though it's aching

When there are clouds in the sky you'll get by

If you smile through your pain and sorrow

Smile, and maybe tomorrow

You'll find the sun come shining through for you

Light up your face with gladness

HIde every trace of sadness

Although a tear maybe ever so near

That's the time you must keep on trying

Smile, what's the use in crying

You'll find that life is still worthwhile

If you'll just smile

That's the time you must keep on trying

Smile, what's the use in crying

You'll find that life is still worthwhile

If you'll just smile

Lovely song and a lovely film. You must see this if you liked the first one. Just throw Austin O'Brien back into the wilderness and bring back Anna Chlumsky!",1096934400,11,2298,4.370283018867925
573656,3,6303148255,This is a pretty good movie but whatever his name was Austin whatever was trying way to hard to be the tough guy in the movie. And it was so obvious that he was just there to replace Macualay Culkin. It would have been really nice if at the of My Girl 1 Vada and Thomas had gotten together. Because I personally think that Vada and Thomas were sort of the right ones for each other. It depends on how you look at it. I also know that deep down inside Thomas had a little soft spot for Vada you could tell by the way he was acting around her. Vada and Thomas 4ever.,1089244800,3,564,3.956140350877193
