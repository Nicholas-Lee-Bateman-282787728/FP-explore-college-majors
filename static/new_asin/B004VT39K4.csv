4484477,5,B004VT39K4,"I just received my copy of the Blu-ray ""The Day of the Triffids Special Edition"" from Amazon UK. The Blu-ray includes the 3 hour movie and more than 3 hours of extras for a total running time of 401 minutes (off the back of the case). I always liked the 1962 film starring Howard Keel and Nicole Maurey and was looking forward to seeing this BBC version of the John Wyndham novel. I enjoyed it very much. The image is very sharp and the CGI is very good too.

  This Blu-ray is region free so it will play in North American Blu-ray players. The extras (standard definition) however are probably PAL and not NTSC so that could be a problem unless your Blu-ray player has a PAL to NTSC converter. My relatively old Panasonic DMP-BD10A apparently has one as I can watch everything the high definition movie and the standard definition extras with no problem

  And apparently the 1962 film has been restored and hopefully will be released in the very near future.",1271808000,27,960,4.520231213872832

4484492,4,B004VT39K4,"BOTTOM LINE: This two-part mini-series adaption from 2009 is an interesting take on the classic horror story yet still takes numerous liberties with the source material and while enjoyable as is, it still isn't as good as the Steve Sekely-directed 1963 movie - from the perspective of a traditional horror movie. That film is a genuine classic frightfest in its own right and, sadly, the only versions currently available are horrendously faded, washed out pan&scan prints from unscrupulous lowball public domain outfits. The 1963 TRIFFID film is in dire need of a complete frame-by-frame remastering in high-def 4k/1080p Blu-ray. Please! Someone? Anyone!? Maybe one of these days...  All-in-all, I found this particular version of John Wyndham's apocalyptic novel to be an enjoyable diversion suitable for late night/weekend watching. 4 STARS.

THE STORY (contains spoilers): This 2009 re-interpretation opens in a not too distant future where a new species of carnivorous plant, dubbed ""Triffids"" by the husband & wife scientist team who discover them growing wild in Zaire, are also found to produce a plentiful oil. Specimens of the plants are transported back to civilization and, after some subsequent bio-engineering by man, are now cultivated on HUGE factory-farms around the globe to produce massive quantities of the naturally occurring, endlessly renewable & sustainable fossil fuel alternative. (Not sure how the Triff-Oil solves global warming, as the narration claims, but whatever.) However, we are informed that, in addition to being carnivorous, the triffids are also mobile, making them a very real threat to every living thing on earth. Thankfully, they're all securely locked up on these large farms. Male specimens are kept in very limited numbers and only used to pollinate the female of the species under controlled conditions, as needed. So, they are scary but basically we're all perfectly safe, right? Uh-huh. A massive solar flare, the not-to-be-missed event of a lifetime, occurs shortly after our story opens and the resulting nerve damage caused by said event leaves almost everyone on earth permanently blinded. Dr. Bill Masen, a triffid botanist stung in the eyes by one of the nasty plants shortly before the solar flare, has undergone corrective surgery and thus his bandaged peepers escape the celestial light show. In the resulting chaos that occurs the morning after the blinding solar flare, Masen removes his bandages and discovers that he is one of the few sighted people left in all of England... and perhaps the world.

THOUGHTS: The movie details the plight of Dr. Masen and a ragtag band of sighted survivors who attempt to navigate through the quickly deteriorating remains of civilization while at the same time defending themselves from roving bands of flesh-eating triffids. Dougray Scott & Joley Richardson are a likable pair as Bill Masen & Jo Playton, a TV reporter who also escaped blindness. Eddie Izzard has a grand time playing ""Torrence,"" a vile, self-absorbed man with subjugation on his mind. Ex-""Beverly Hills 90210"" alumni Jason Priestly has a small but pivotal role as Major Coker, a U.S. soldier (what exactly IS he doing in England?) caught in the midst of the mess and trying to do the right thing, whether anyone else agrees with his solution or not. Vanessa Redgrave has a brief but memorable part as nun who goes to extreme lengths to protect a small group of people from the triffids. And Brian Cox is his usual terrific self playing Dennis Masen, Bill's estranged scientist father; but his role is woefully small and seems tacked on as an afterthought. There are a lot of plot holes (some of them pretty stupid) and it is disappointing that this version of TRIFFIDS strays as far as all previous attempts. I don't think it helped that the filmmakers compressed the years-spanning events of Wyndham's ground-breaking novel into a few brief months, either. I suppose the only way to film a truly faithful version of Wyndham's novel is to make it a period piece. I understand that a big budget Hollywood remake is in the works (surprise!), but it is reportedly based more on the 1963 film than Wyndham's novel. Oh, well. Either way I'll give it a look, I suppose. I have a soft spot for the horrific walking houseplants as the 1963 version of ""The Day of The Triffids"" scared the crap out of me as a little tyke. I was thrilled to recently obtain an original copy of the 1951 novel and I enjoyed it immensely. Let's hope that some day someone will make a spot-on adaption. In the meantime, this film is an enjoyable diversion - if you take it with a grain of salt and lump it in with the '63 version as simple horror/adventure movie. If you do you may enjoy it. If you're looking for a word-for-word novel-to-film translation then keep searching, cause this ain't it.

THE DVD: Audio & video presentation of THE DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS is pretty decent in this standard-def format. There was some light pixelation and occasional artifacting, but overall it looked & sounded quite good. The two-disc release includes a 30min or so making of featurette on disc two which covers several aspects of the film's genesis.",1423180800,6,5176,5.0011600928074245
4484493,5,B004VT39K4,"Not the most faithful rendering of this classic sci-fi story, but beautifully produced with a restrained hand on the violence and cgi special effects. This production could have gone horribly wrong but good taste won the day.  While John Wyndham's story is changed in many places, the spirit of the original book remains intact. Sometimes you can see plot points coming from a mile away, but that doesn't spoil the overall effect of the film. The cgi triffids look very believable and they are carefully designed and animated.  Although I think this production takes 2nd place to the BBC version it's still satisfying and well worth your time.",1421539200,,643,4.944444444444445

4484495,4,B004VT39K4,"Overall this is a good adaptation of John Wyndham's classic 1950s science fiction novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Day-of-the-Triffids-20th-Century-Rediscoveries/dp/0812967127/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Day of the Triffids (20th Century Rediscoveries)</a>. Now set in a world saved from global warming due to the mass cultivation of triffids for their oil (although it is unexplained just how burning a renewable oil instead of burning a mined fossil fuel reduces global warming), the main story plot follows along the track of the book in a loose way as the new world reveals itself to John Masen, triffid biologist.
It is an entertaining adventure romp with a few additional or changed characters, such as Torrence (Izzard) as a ruthless, directionless opportunist rather than Wyndham's Beadley, and a very different Coker. It is also set over a much shorter time period of weeks/months rather than years. There are moments when the actions of the characters don't seem logical, such as the insistence on not taking basic precautions of using goggles and gloves, or making barricades from materials which will be easily breached, but I put that down to artistic license to keep up the suspense.

Worth watching, but not a patch on the original book.",1420848000,2,1307,5.737113402061856

4484505,4,B004VT39K4,"Not a bad updating in terms of script.  And the acting
was, for the most part, adequate.
Two irritations.
One: needed a stronger lead villain.  It was brave
casting, but Izzard just didn't have the innate nastiness
that would have made this revision more intense &
created a sense of danger which, despite human
foibles and greed, simply wasn't sufficiently sinister.
Two:  Spielberg's moving plants in 'Minority Report'
were more alarming and fearsome than these leafy
Triffids, which lacked the menace and didn't build the
growing panic essential to the story as their skills
supposingly increase with their freedom to communicate,
roam and strike at will as well as actually  plot against
human life.
Triffids are vicious.
Sure these killed, but they simply didn't build up that
fear we're supposed to be feeling.
This came so very close to working, and I was happy
enough to watch it.  I just wonder if anyone will ever
eventually get the menace done appropriately. Sure hope
so!",1378684800,6,983,4.969512195121951

To see it brought to life like this is great. I have a universal DVD player so I was able to watch this British DVD. I highly recommend this film as the acting is good, the CGI is good, and of course, the story is excellent.

4484511,2,B004VT39K4,"One of my favorite sci-fi books and previously captured on film twice before.  This one really comes up short for me when compared to the 80's version mini-series from the BBC that ably starred John Duttine and Emma Relph (see my review).  So many problems... beginning with the overblown Eddie Izzard character who awakens from a deep sleep on board an airplane, instantly diagnoses the situation and emerges from the horrific crash via a plot device I sure hope nobody ever really tries!  The storyline barely establishes the main characters, there is no real connection made between them and a soulless semi-romance ensues quite late in the story.  Frankly, it sure seemed that the writers had a bunch of original character names and stuck all of them in along the way without regard to the fabric of a storyline.  The time frame given is over the course of two nights - Superman himself would be hard pressed to cover all the ground, resolve all the plot lines and accomplish all that occurs in this movie.  This is plain old derivative sci-fi, only slightly elevated over the SYFY channels usual pablum.  Sorry, BBC - you got it right 3 decades ago!",1370304000,6,1154,4.74

I could understand why the director will not follow the book in all details, but he goes over the top and the film is utterly different.
It reminds me a mix of Mad Max, 2020 texas gladiators and some other post-apocalyptic second rate flicks.
The beginning is gorgeous, with wonderful special effects. Unfortunately it becomes an urban ""western"" where triffids had rather develop their killing skills in town. Why not? But they remind me nasty weeds in Evil Dead or some other horror film.
The acting? Rather average but for Dougray Scott who is quite good.
The characters are very shallow: the villains are so bad, much more than in the book, the heroes are not attractive either. Everyone act by the script and sometimes without logic,triffids included(!).
I quickly lose any interest in them, either good or bad and I use the forward button of the video remote controller to the end.

The 1962 movie was very good for it's day, and the bbc 1981 version which is available on dvd is very good too. Niether of course had the cgi effects this one does. However they are superior in content to this one;  this one as good as it is; seems to take place way too quickly. This story takes place over months and not a week?  but to be honest; my mind was while watching this  assuming that it was taking place over a long time.  On amazon.uk this was trashed by reviewers but I think they are wrong ,it's an ok flick. And Vanessa Redgrave is excellent as a deranged nun , but you can see the point of reviewers there; the bbc is out to make alot of flicks with christian badguys; but then rarely has muslim ones. And they are faced with muslim mobs chanting ""death to england!"" why don't they go out and shout 'stop stoning women in iran!""? , anyways the movie follows the story well enough; but  the 1981 version is better acted and more character driven. You should watch that one for sure!  This has a few deleted scenes and lots of extras too. The picture is fantastic on blu ray and they need to put this out over here. However you can play this on your blu ray player anyways.  This movie did horrify me , just as the first two versions did , the thought of a world blinded is terrible enough, but one blinded with man eating plants on the loose and everyone is doomed is a true nightmare. You can't go wrong with any version of this movie. OR the the classic book this came from either.  But if you must buy this one , then get the others because they are great views even if their effects are not as good as this versions.

8444050,1,B004VT39K4,"Just don't bother. Please just trust me on this. Don't reduce what little you have in your bank account for this complete mess of a movie. Good cast, of course. Let's not forget all their fine body of work. But this script is TOTALLY unworthy of the talent and follows the sourcebook material only about 8% of the time. I'm surprised they all didn't walk off the set after the first cold reading before filming began. Destined to be made fun of on a remake of MST3K someday, perhaps.",1463184000,,483,4.438202247191011
