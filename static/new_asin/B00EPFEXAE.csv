8608004,4,B00EPFEXAE,It was interesting.  It does start right in the middle of everything.  There's a little bit of introduction into what's happening but if you don't know a little bit of history it may be a little confusing.  Nothing that Wikipedia can't fix though..,1500422400,,248,4.72093023255814
8608005,2,B00EPFEXAE,"Too soap-opery for such an important historic figure. His writings on the rights of man, adapted by the United Nations 130 years later are not even mencioned, nor his continued devotion to his priestly calling. Such a historical giant deserves a better biopic",1474761600,,259,5.046511627906977
