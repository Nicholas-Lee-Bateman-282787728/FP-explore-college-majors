2561311,4,B000FDEVAM,"This is a good Sci-Fi, Action, Horror/Vampire Movie with tough characters, even the women hunters who  are cool with attitude. This is what movies are made for, to enjoy and I hope more viewers enjoy this Heavy Metal, Vampire Future, WILD RIDE through the Universe kicking tail!",1185667200,7,278,4.914893617021277
2561312,5,B000FDEVAM,"Absolutely hilarious, gore filled vampire fest.  For fans of Starship Troopers, Evil Dead, Slither, Undead, etc.  Great gore effects, hilarious one liners, hot chicks... this movie has it all.",1178668800,12,192,5.586206896551724
2561313,3,B000FDEVAM,"I saw this movie on the Sci-Fi channel when it aired. Normally it isn't my kind of genre to watch, but I am a fan of Joe Lando and the work of Matthew Hastings from the series they did together, Higher Ground. For a B-movie I thought it was credible. These are not your ""usual"" vampires.  These vampires come in different species.  Some like to eat you, not just suck your blood. This is where I found the movie to be gross.  But for horror genre fanatics, this is right up your alley!  I am purchasing this DVD because I found the movie to be entertaining for the most part. I agree that some of the acting was a bit over-the-top, but so what. I found Michael Ironside to be quite comical to tell you the truth.  I thought Joe Lando and Dominic Z were very good with what they had to work with. It might not be a movie that would be nominated for any kind of award, but it is still entertaining.",1149379200,23,896,4.126436781609195
2561314,1,B000FDEVAM,"Why doesn't Amazon offer negative stars, cause seriously there are some DVDs & CDs that deserve them.  Seriously, this movie ""Sucks""(get it, sorry that was bad).  Where do movies like this get their funding from?  Answer: Lionsgate(that definately should say something about the quality of this picture).  It obviously has a descent budget though, the special effects aren't bad for this kinda movie.  This actually isn't a bad plot, as far as bad sci-fi B's go.  Sadly though, the acting and writing don't hold up in the least.  The story goes like this:  In the future the universe is over run by Vampires(wait, it gets better)and there are these teams of macho(every bad & cliched stereo type in the book for big bad tough guys)vampire exterminators called ""V-San Crews"" meaning vampire sanitation(man the script guys musta been up all night thinking up that one).  Their motto is ""The Toughest Job You'll Ever Hate"".  They fly around in their little space ship hunting different types of vampires badly named after horror icons such as ""Vorhees"", & ""Leatherface""(Who gave them the right to soil those good names; lawsuit maybe?:)).  This movie is a train wreck, I guess if you like watching garbage Sci-Fi Channel shows you might be able to forgive the horrendous bad/over acting, & the horrible directing(seriously you get these quick scenes in the beginning where they're supposed to be hunting vampires and it shows 'em all, all of a sudden popping out from behind tree's & popping up from behind big rocks like a bad looney toons cartoon).  This movie is movie is a bad Starship Troopers wannabe(Paul Verhoeven you ain't, Mr nobody director guy)but with vampires instead of bugs, it's just too stupid for words.  I'd rather sit through a Uwe Boll marathon than ever have to even think about watching this movie again.  Consider yourselves warned.

P.S.  BURIED.COM says ""If there's only one vampire movie you want to see this year--then this is the one"".  Well, buried.com are obviosly on drugs and should not be trusted because I can't imagine ever recommending this movie to anyone, at all, ever.",1145923200,9,2106,4.9375
2561315,5,B000FDEVAM,This is a awesome movie. this is the best low budget vampire movie i've seen in a long time. the story is awesome and the actors are great. this is just a good movie. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do,1349913600,,222,3.847826086956522
2561316,4,B000FDEVAM,the deluise boys use there sg1 money to turn the old andromeda sets into a side project thats kinda like firefly meets zombieland with a slick rock and roll soundtrack... funny too!,1326844800,,181,4.6875
2561317,3,B000FDEVAM,"In 2210, mineral rich planets are cleansed of Vampires by a rag-tag group of Corporate Mercenaries. This interesting blend of Sci-Fi, Action and Horror, plays out like a lost episode of STAR TREK, though it has been updated to contain gore laden imagery. One might argue that it also has the swagger of a Western in a Sci-Fi setting, replete with the half breed guide, (a Vamp/Human in this case), who was brilliantly played by Natassia MALTHE. Though not without misfires, other credible performances were delivered by Joe LANDO, Dominic ZAMPROGNA and Michael IRONSIDE. Natassia MALTHE, however, stole the show as the Kate BECKINSALE-UNDERWORLD like heroine who wears black leather and kicks inter-galactic Vampire butt. An interesting and entertaining blend that is worth checking out!",1261958400,4,787,5.304
2561318,5,B000FDEVAM,"I must admit that I purchased this movie because Dominic Zamprogna was it and I figured I'd suffer through it just to watch him.  Imagine my surprise when I actually enjoyed the movie.  I have never willingly watched or purchased a horror movie before, but this one actually had a plot (our heros work for a corporation and go out and exterminate vampires from planets so that the miners etc. can do their job) and a B plot (the crew has to learn to trust each other after a tragedy befalls them) and a C plot (a misguided group of humans acting like Vamp-peace, believe that the vamps are just misunderstood and that humans are bad and makes bad choices that gets humans killed).

The original crew of 5 (which quickly is reduced to 4) actually manages to give us some backstory and a reason to care about them.  Dominic Zamprogna as First Officer Damien Underwood gives a great performance and really carries the film.  He even manages to keep it together in some of the campier scenes.

Michael Ironsides is a bit over the top, but then again, since I've never met a vampire perhaps his performance was spot on.

I am happy to have this movie in my library and know that it will get many viewings, especially when I need some escape and an excuse for a beer and popcorn.",1258070400,2,1273,4.437768240343348
2561319,4,B000FDEVAM,"""VAMPIRE WARS: BATTLE FOR THE UNIVERSE"" (released on DVD in Canada by Maple Pictures as ""BLOOD SUCKERS"") is fantastic!  Don't miss this fun, EXTREMELY(!!!) campy movie that is a combination of the best elements of BUFFY, FIREFLY, STARSHIP TROOPERS and EVIL DEAD!!!  I'll quote from the back of the DVD box: VAMPIRE WARS: BATTLE FOR THE UNIVERSE: ""The Year is 2210.  The universe is overrun with hundreds of vampire species that prey upon humans in brutal, surprise attacks.  That's when intergalactic Vampire Sanitation teams are called upon to lay waste to these vile predators.  V-SAN crews, who've come to know their line of work as 'the toughest job you'll ever hate,' are comprised of rough and rugged men, women--and i the case of the Heironymous crew--a half-human vampiress named Quintana (Natassia Malthe), who draws upon her psychic prowess to help the V-SANS track their quarry.  Led by Captain Nicholas Churchill (Joe Lando) and second-in-command Damian Underwood (Dominic Zamprogna), the Heironymous team becomes the target of a deadly trap that has much deeper and darker purpose.  Directed by their vile leader Muco (Michael Ironside), the vampires have no plans of living peacefully with humans...they want to rule the universe.""  If you're a fan of vampires and space adventure movies and TV shows, then VAMPIRE WARS definitely belongs in your DVD library.  Echo Bridge Home Entertainment (formerly Platinum) has come a long way in improving the quality of their DVD's.  The picture and sound quality of VAMPIRE WARS is crystal clear with no pixelation whatsoever.  The animated Menu that opens the movie is exciting and interesting as well.  Don't overlook the ""scene select"" option--each of the 3 scene select grids have different rock songs from the movie playing in the background.  VAMPIRE WARS will be in my DVD collection forever!  TRIVIA NOTE: on the DVD box of BLOOD SUCKERS, the Canadian release of the movie, the year is 2205--while on the box of the VAMPIRE WARS version, the year is 2210!  Also, on the BLOOD SUCKERS DVD box, the team are referred to as ""Nosferatus"", instead of V-SANS.  Take your pick!  For the sake of completeness, I'll quote from the back of the BLOOD SUCKERS DVD box: BLOOD SUCKERS: ""The year is 2205.  After exhausting Earth, we now import vital natural resources from other planets.  Suddenly Earth finds itself invaded by alien vampires in search of their own natural resource: human blood.  Now it's up to a team of combating specialists known as ""Nosferatus"" to save our planet and our species against these highly intelligent and savage bloodsuckers.""",1245110400,2,2609,5.07981220657277
2561320,4,B000FDEVAM,"This movie is a sci-fi horror with obvious tips of the hat to Joss Weadons Serenity, and Buffy the vampire slayer.  While the movie does take itself seriously, there are obvious tongue in cheek moments.  The action is well choreographed, the characters are well developed and...it's just fun.  I must have watched this movie a dozen times since buying it...and no..it doesn't get better..but it is always a bloody good ride!",1235952000,,424,4.943661971830986
2561321,5,B000FDEVAM,"I think this film was great! I'm not so much into the whole ""sci-fi"" things, I really don't like Star Wars. The best part is that it looks so real. This movie has all kinds of vampires in it, which was fascinating to watch because you never knew what type of vampires they were up against. If you like Alien vs Predator or any gory vampire movie you'll love this. I really like this movie.",1231113600,,389,4.2
2561322,1,B000FDEVAM,"Premise interesting
Cheesy special effects
Lots gore
Don't waste your time or money",1228780800,,83,5.461538461538462
2561323,2,B000FDEVAM,"Second movie in the boxset. Originally titled Bloodsuckers, This movie was pretty average. It is kinda boring in some parts but there is some good gore effects, but they're not great though.

The movie takes place in the year 2210. Vampires have pretty much taken over the whole world. The V-SAN (Vampire Sanitation) Squad, which also has their own spaceship and is lead by Churchill,  who is captured by the vampires, recieves a message from an Earth and the team, formed by Quintana (Played by the very hot Natassia Malthe), the rookie officer Damian and the rebels Rosa and Roman (Roman being played by Aaron Pearl from Wrongfully Accused.) V-SAN later meets up with the leader of the vampires Muco, played by Michael Ironside from Total Recall. He has no plans of living peacefully with humans, as he is bent on world domination.

While this movie was not a waste of time, I doubt I'll be putting back in the DVD player anytime soon.",1221177600,3,937,4.701219512195122

8120943,4,B000FDEVAM,"I got this one because I'm a Joe Lando fan.. Not as good as Devil Winds. (Joe dies at the end) but I can see that this one was designed as series beginning and probably as a showcase for Dominic Zamprogna ( now Dante Falconeri on General Hospital)

this movie should probably be marketed to Domnic's fans for than Joe's, but I still like Joe.",1375488000,,342,4.2615384615384615
