8319141,5,B001LNOMRC,"""Master Stroke"" (1967) is an ingenious, clever film that turns up missing when one looks for it except on amazon as presented by Sinister Cinema which found this little gem somewhere out of Cinecitta studios.  Richard Harrison stars and he was an American actor that appeared in Italian spectacles like ""Invincible Gladiator"" (1961) and 1993's ""Angel Eyes."" It also stars Margaret Lee, an English actress appearing in European roles and Adolfo Celi, the best known, who had just been the villain in ""Thunderball.""  The film unsurprisingly seems to be dubbed.  Directed by Michele Lupo, it is a well written espionage film that is a real surprise, its twists always stunning, with exceptional music by Francesco De Masi. The film should never have seen the obscurity from which this film seems to have been unearthed by Sinister Cinema.  I am sure they would have never have released the DVD from such a terrible 16mm print if that were the only way the film could be seen, and seen it should be.  The technicolor by Movielab is so faded the film is almost completely drained of all color.  But I loved this film anyway, something shining in this dull world that could have never have seen the light.  It makes me feel sad for the cast and all involved in it.  The film was released by the Walter Reade organization.",1331337600,,1315,4.7368421052631575
8319142,4,B001LNOMRC,"Although you'll be as confused as the protagonist at first, MASTER STROKE is really clever and quite entertaining through the end. Definitely worth viewing if you can ignore the quality issues.  What are they?  Well, the print is panned & scanned and faded.  At least it's not worn out/excessively scratched.  I'd love to see a restored widescreen version of this.",1316044800,3,364,5.016666666666667
8319143,5,B001LNOMRC,"Director Michele Lupo gives us an entertaining spy movie which starts out as a spoof of Spaghetti Westerns and then gets deadly serious in the spy department. Richard Harrison, in one of his best roles, plays an actor in Euro genre films who is approached by the secret service to impersonate the security chief in a major diamond factory for a one of a kind jewel heist.  Harrison is a dead ringer for him and we see him play 2 roles.  Naturally after the job is complete, the double crosses emerge and keeps the film rolling in  unexpected twists and turns.  The film boasts a great cast: The always brilliant Adolpho Celli plays the head of the secret service(or is he?), the drop dead gorgeous Margaret Lee plays the femme fatale who juggles personalities at just the right pace , Gerard Tichy, Alan Collins(Luciano Pigozzi)in a great cameo, Eduardo Fajardo as an extremely slimy villain and George Eastman(Luigi Montifiore) in a great cameo for the western sequence.  The music by Francesco De Masi, a stalwart of Euro westerns, gives the film the icing on the cake.  I will not devulge anymore of the plot because it would definitely destroy the excellent viewing experience of this underrated film.  Quality looks like it comes from a 16mm print with splices ,scratches, and color fades throughout.  Its a testament to the film that the quality of the source does not distract from the quantity of thrills in this great Euro thriller.  It deserves a better reputation and a proper wide screen digital release.",1276387200,5,1516,4.8
