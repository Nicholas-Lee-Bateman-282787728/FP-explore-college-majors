Decent length. Video is nonstop beautiful girls and yes, beautiful boobs.
Forget the brew, it's all about the boobs. But I guess a title of just ""Boobs"" wouldn't get much attention, though I think that would have sufficed enough.
Enjoy a sexy fun film.",1389225600,,277,4.791666666666667

8333526,4,B001PKQSLY,"THE GOOD:

THE most explicit Peach title that I've ever seen, loaded to the gills not only with spread-leg explicitness but even tantalizing touches (basically Penthouse territory). Really almost startled me with how racy that this one gets--great stuff! Especially when I've seen some other Peach titles that didn't even get as hot as Playboy.

Some really great-looking chicks, some of the best in the Peach stable.

Very generous run time; 10 models and 30 minutes of extras.

Peach's usual high production values.

THE BAD:

The ""Boobs & Brews"" thing was dull and pointless--Erin Avery and Cindy Pucci (the second of whom looks like some cosmetic surgeon built her out of chicken skin and refurbished auto parts) show up a couple or three times holding some beers and saying stupid things.

Even  with that I probably would have given it five stars but for one major oversight. Shay Laren is, in my opinion, one of the hottest women in the world and probably among the top five best-looking models that Peach ever has had. Yet for some reason--I'm fairly sure at this point that it's a clause in her contract--she will not  show ""everything"" (you know where I'm going with this, meow) to Peach audiences. Now I've seen her do this in Penthouse and on a bunch of different web modeling sites, so I KNOW that she has no personal qualms with it the way that certain other models do. And in this particular DVD there are 10 models and 11 vignettes (counting the three bonus ones), and out of the 11, nine of them feature explicit nudity. The only two that don't are the ones that feature some unimportant skinny blonde chick, and Shay. WHAT IS THE DEAL, SHAY?! Or should I say what is the deal, Peach? Does Shay want you to pony up more money for her to go all out? Then pay it, or don't use her anymore. I'm tired of the disappointment, because this isn't the only Peach title where Shay is the one chick who doesn't put out like the rest.

So an otherwise fantastic production has a really glaring flaw because of that--but I still recommend it highly.",1372377600,4,2054,4.602739726027397
8333527,4,B001PKQSLY,"BOOBS AND BREWS from 2009 is one of the newer Peach DVDs that I've gotten, and it's quite a good one. It's got 11 models on it, and is in the typical Peach format with each model doing a strip-tease one at a time in various settings, ending up fully nude and totally uncensored. The one exception to the format is Darenzia and Heather Vandeven doing a girl-girl scene, and it's pretty hot but remains R-rated. A couple of segments are rather tedious to me, but I'm happy with most of them. Like, I'm really glad to get new segments with Shay Laren, Erin Avery, and Jamie Lynn since they're 3 of my favorite Peach models, and I'm excited to see Erica Ellyson is now a Peach model too. I had seen her on a ""Girls Gone Wild"" DVD and thought she was exceptionally pretty and photogenic, so I'm not surprised that Peach signed her up. Also, the segment with Zoe Britton is the best I've ever seen with her. I liked her a lot in the Peach roller skating-themed DVD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roller-Booty/dp/B000LE1GC6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roller Booty</a>.

So what does the title BOOBS AND BREWS mean, and what does this have to do with beer? Not a lot! The only thing about beer here is hosts Erin Avery and Cindy Pucci holding up steins full of it, and asking 3 beer questions on the interactive bonus game. And yes, all the models DO show their boobs, but then ALL Peach DVDs do that, and the size of them varies a great deal, 4 models having moderate sized boobs and 7 models having big boobs. Pretty typical ratio for Peach DVDs.

BOOBS AND BREWS is unusually generous, since this type of program usually runs about 55 to 60 minutes, but BOOBS AND BREWS runs more like 88 minutes. The main program runs 61 minutes, but there's an interactive bonus game that has 3 complete strip-teases of the hosts (2 with Erin Avery and 1 with Cindy Pucci) that run 27 more minutes, making 88 minutes total. There's also bonuses of a good photo gallery of the models that runs as a 7.5 minute slide show, and trailers of 4 more Peach DVDs. Picture quality is quite good, and appears to be various ratios of wide screen, ranging maybe from 1.85:1 to 2.35:1.

Get it?....Got it....Good!!",1360195200,3,2225,4.670918367346939
