7931475,4,B000055ZGT,Didn't get a chance to use this. It's a VHS. I ordered a VHS instead of DVD but can't wait to watch it,1520726400,,102,3.4782608695652173
7931476,5,B000055ZGT,She guides you through stretches in a relaxing location. This video makes me feel relaxed after a long day. Tamilee's voice is very mellow.,1376524800,,139,4.833333333333333
7931477,2,B000055ZGT,this might say for biginners but not for me. Im over weight and I bought this because I wanted to lose weight and get back some flexibility but this was just to advanced for me. this is just ok for someone whose a little flexible already and just want to improve it but not ofr someone who is as stiff as me. good vid thought and I will keep trying.,1313539200,,349,4.0
7931478,5,B000055ZGT,"This tape saved my sanity last year when I was a bit low and blue.  Tamilee's voice is very soothing, the transition between poses flow nicely.  I purchased the two-tape set because the 2-tape set was still a good price (this tape plus ""Total Body Stretch for Beginners"" for the purpose of improving my flexibility.  I thought I would use the latter tape most of the time since I felt I would be more willing set set aside 10 minutes rather than the 30 minutes required for this tape. By the second viewing of this tape, ""Beginners Stretch for Flexibility"", I had learned the moves so that I now do the entire routine with my eyes shut as I simply follow along by only LISTENNING.  I do this tape several times a week, just before bedtime, I never seem to tire of it, and it leaves me substantially calmer and more relaxed than when I begin.  I am delighted that this video provides me the kind of results that I've failed to achieve with a number of guided meditation tapes.  I bought it for its promise of muscle flexibility, which indeed it has fulfilled, but the ""guided meditation"", the unadverstised benefit, is what I value most from this video.  Thank you, Tamilee, for making it!",1128902400,9,1188,4.497674418604651
7931479,5,B000055ZGT,"I've had this video for a few years and have not grown tired of it.  You stretch your whole body in 20 minutes.  It starts with standing stretches mostly for your legs, then moves to the floor for hip, quad and upper body stretches.  It ends with a nice relaxation segment.  Tamilee is encouraging.  I think she's a wonderful instructor.  She has a nice, calm manner.  This video is great to do at night to unwind.  The garden setting is very relaxing too. I prefer this tape to yoga because you don't have to psych yourself into strenuous poses.",1126137600,4,546,4.444444444444445
7931480,5,B000055ZGT,"I was searching Amazon for a stretch video.  I exercise using video's a lot.  One thing I noticed is that there never seems to be very much stretching at the end of my other workouts  (Sansone, Denise Austin).  They all seem to just want to get the workout over with.  Anyway, I decided to add a stretch video to my exercise videos.  This is the one I chose and I LOVE it.  She is very clear in her instructions, very calming and you really feel the stretch.  It feels great to do this video!  If you have an extra 30 mins. and want a total body stretch this video is a great choice!",1110931200,3,583,4.088495575221239
7931481,5,B000055ZGT,"I have found this tape to be outstanding for starting to stretch after not working out for a very long time! It's the perfect pace and nothing in is so advanced that it's discouraging. I feel so good during and afterwards. I'm addicted to this tape. I'm telling you, you feel so calm, relaxed and limber after doing this. You'll want to do it everyday. Perfect for beginners. Highly recommended!",1084320000,5,395,4.6571428571428575
7931482,5,B000055ZGT,"I LOVE THIS VIDEO!!  Tamilee is so intense with her ""of steel"" videos but she's the exact opposite with this video.  She takes you from standing stretches all the ways through in smooth transitions to floor stretches and then to a relaxation session.  If you're stressed out or if you work out a lot then this video will definitely help you relax.",1035244800,10,347,4.564516129032258
7931483,5,B000055ZGT,"This video is very easy to do, nice little stretching.
I do this video when I have zero energy. Tamilee moves with the body and without watching you naturally transition from one position to the next.
If you want simple relaxation before bed time, here is something to soothe your soul.",1016841600,7,286,4.627450980392157
7931484,5,B000055ZGT,"I have been using Tamilee Webb's videos for years.  I have nearly all of her ""Bun's of Steel, etc. videos and I think she is an excellent instructor.
The Beginner's Stretch for Flexibility is an excellent video for a person who really enjoys and ""needs"" to stretch.  The instructions are excellent and I look forward to using it, which is about 3 times a week.  I also use free weights and a treadmill.  I am 60 years old and have fibromyalgia.  Using this stretching video has helped me tremendously. I don't have nearly the pain and stiffness that I had before.
God Bless Tamilee and both her stretching videos, namely the one I have rated and also her ""Total Body Stretch"" for beginners.  I alternate them.",992476800,49,709,4.587301587301587
