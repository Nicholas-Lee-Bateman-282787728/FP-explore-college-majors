8684045,5,B00OL018XI,"I thought I was ordering the UK DVDs for Love/Hate series 5.  I received ""Love/Hate: The Collector's Edition"" UK DVD set containing all five series on 9 DVDs plus 36-page ""Collector's Guide"".  I am well pleased... would be more so had I not also purchased series 4 in the same order.  But it's all good, I now have series 1-3 that I had watched on Hulu all for my very own as well.

Seller was ""Direct From Europe"".",1478217600,,415,4.282051282051282

8684048,5,B00OL018XI,"One of the best gritty TV dramas I have ever seen. If your sensibilities are delicate and easily offended then go back to watching trite sanitized s***e on TV and save your money. If, however, you have an appreciation for something unadulterated then invest your hard earned cash forthwith.-RF",1441152000,,293,5.0
