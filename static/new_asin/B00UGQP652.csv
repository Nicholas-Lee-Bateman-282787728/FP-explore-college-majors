8706654,5,B00UGQP652,"Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein, 1948 film

This film assumes a knowledge of the Hollywood horror films it satirizes, else it may not be appreciated. In London Larry Talbot tries to call America. Wilbur has a problem unloading a wagon, but Sandra likes him. A phone call warns him about two crates shipped to the House of Horror. Mr. McDougall got them dirt cheap from Europe - the remains of Dracula and Frankenstein! Chick and Wilbur must deliver the crates personally. Their banter is full of jokes. ""Does Dracula know it?"" the comedy comes from knowing what Chick and Wilbur can't see. The missing contents lead to an investigation by McDougall. We learn more about Sandra and her interest in Wilbur; its business not pleasure. Larry Talbot arrives, and asks to be locked in his room.

Wilbur and Chick arrive at the castle. They begin to search for the missing monsters, and Wilbur discovers them. But they disappear when Chick arrives. They all show up for the masquerade party. The full moon affects Larry Talbot. There is much comic action and confusion. [The special effects have advanced since the 1930s.] Chick and Larry arrive to rescue Joan and Wilbur. But Larry is affected by the full moon. There is a comic chase down the hall, and at the party. At the end the monsters are eliminated, at least as far as we can see. There is a clue to their next film.

The horror films of the 1930s reflect the concerns of people. ""Frankenstein"" represents the man-made horror of the Great Depression, almost beyond control. ""Dracula"" represents the threat of a powerful foreign ruler. World War Two saw an end to those fears. The horror films of the 1950s represented new fears, about the environment or society. ""Them"" or ""The Creature from the Black Lagoon"" are of one type. ""The Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" represent unnameable fear. ""On the Beach"" was the ultimate horror film, one that may have prevented a nuclear calamity.",1477699200,,1941,4.8053892215568865
8706655,4,B00UGQP652,"Wasnt expecting much from this film, but it was a good blend of the horror films of the 30s and the humor of Abbott and Costello. And it works well as both a horror film and a comedy. Lon Chaney Jr. and Bela Lugosi recreate their roles as the Wolfman and Dracula. Frankenstein actually plays a supporting role. Whether you're a fan of Abbott and Costello or not, this is an entertaining film.",1472515200,,392,4.383561643835616
