8694814,1,B00RC69IBM,"It's difficult to give this story more than one star.  It has a broken storyline, substandard acting, and poor photography. We watched for less than 10 minutes before turning it off. Maybe for the adolescents there is something to hang on to, but it's weak, weak, weak.",1457136000,,269,4.723404255319149
8694815,5,B00RC69IBM,"Thoroughly enjoyed Odyssey of Destiny!  A thought provoking plot, and a great cast, this SciFi kind of carried you away into the story! Hope another film is in the making, for we will definitely buy it!  Highly recommend!",1426723200,,221,4.7894736842105265
8694816,5,B00RC69IBM,Stunning cast delivers an exciting and thought-provoking film in a beautiful setting.  Hated to see it end!!,1422316800,,108,5.352941176470588
