7289411,4,B00ZR3W40E,"I sure do love a good shoot em' up and that is pretty much what ""2 Guns"" is. Although somehow the creators managed to blend and old fashion crime, gun-slinging action flick with a movie like ""Ocean's Eleven"". It's a heist, action, comedy, western, thriller and espionage movie all rolled into one. You may think that may be a little too much for a movie to try and bite off and chew but with people like Denzel Washington, Bill Paxton, Edward James Olmos and Mark Wahlberg driving the ship. It all seems to work.

Denzel plays Robert `Bobby' Trench and Wahlberg plays Michael `Stig' Stigman. They are partners who have many complicated layers that only the viewer should be saddled with figuring out because that's half the fun. In fact, as the two men start the movie off setting up a scenario for a bank robbery we quickly realize that the chemistry between the two is half the fun. We haven't seen such great chemistry between two on screen partners since the Lethal Weapon movies.

Bill Paxton hasn't played such a phenomenal bad guy since he tortured Wyatt and whacked Gary's girlfriend on the top of the head with the shotgun in ""Weird Science"". He eats up every situation he has on screen with a twisted sense of humor and a menacing delivery that has you glued to the screen. He may have gone to waste a bit toward the end of the movie but there are so many levels to the film that it is once again, forgiven.

There were a few things that could have made ""2 Guns"" and even better movie but for anybody who likes a movie that has twists, turns, action and humor, it works. It may get a little ridiculous a handful of times and there was a minor moment toward the end that really bothered me after watching a witty, creative and realistic movie for the most part. Pull the trigger, man. You don't have to explain yourself. It is like you know the camera is on you and you have to release some plot information. No, you don't. That is small potatoes though because ""2 Guns"" is a whole lot of intelligent and twisty fun.",1376870400,,2025,4.423592493297587
7289412,1,B00ZR3W40E,"First off, I want to mention I am a big fan of the acting skills of Denzel Washington. He was fantastic in SAFE HOUSE. The acting, plot and everything about this show was off. I finally walked out with about 20 minutes left in the show. EXAMPLE: Denzel and his amigo want to burglarize a safe on a UNITED STATES NAVAL BASE. What is the plan? Drive the car and crash through the gate and get through security and then escape the pursuers and then sneak off the base. What a bunch of junk.",1376438400,14,487,4.191489361702128

Together they rob a bank on orders so as to steal money from a drug cartel. This way the money can be seized as evidence in a crime and they don't need a warrant, as if that has stopped them before. Things become confused as the there is more money than expected.

The banter between Wahlberg and Washington is what makes the film. They are too cool together. It is a fun popcorn film with comedy, dark comedy, and plenty of action. Good characters in a plot that was predictable. Worth seeing after you have seen Reds 2.

They plan to rob the bank where his money is at. Once again that doesn't go as planned and the two start to discover secrets that change everything. I had pretty high expectations for this one mainly because of Denzel Washington. I was not disappointed. Sometimes movies have twist after twist and it gets jumbled and begins to become comical to the point of almost ruining the movie. While this one did have many twists in it it never felt jumbled. It was a little predictable but that didn't really ruin the movie. The most important thing to look for in a movie though is entertainment. This was was funny, exciting and very fun to watch. Not an Oscar type movie but it is exciting and I really enjoyed it. I recommend it. Overall, funny and fun. A great movie to just watch for fun and not really have to think about. I give it an A-.",1376092800,3,1106,4.4
7289416,5,B00ZR3W40E,"In a day and age where not even the long-awaited Die Hard 5 gets good reviews, it couldn't be more refreshing to see another film like Rush Hour!

That's right. 2 Guns, like RH, is another ""buddy action comedy"" movie. You may not have Chris Tucker or Jackie Chan, but you can't complain with Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg taking the starring film slots!

2 Guns is an impeccable match for Washington and Wahlberg (a pair I'd been waiting to see work together for YEARS!): both actors are not only acclaimed, but also diverse! They both prove that here, with their tackling on of action, humor, drama, and suspense.

Meet Robert ""Bobby"" Trench (Washington) and Michael ""Stig"" Stigman (Wahlberg). Bobby and Stig, unbeknownst to each other, are an undercover DEA agent (Bobby) and an undercover Naval Intelligence Officer (Stig). Bobby and Stig, to each other, are criminals who learn the truth (about each other) the hard way (following a bank robbery)!

Enter drug lord Papi Greco (Edward James Olmos) and one of his main assets, a crooked CIA agent named Earl (Bill Paxton). With connections to the bank Bobby and Stig robbed, Papi and Earl want ""their"" money back at any cost. To save the life of his lover Deb Rees (Paula Patton), Bobby (posing undercover as a criminal with Stig, Papi, and many other drug dealers) must join Stig in retrieving the money that he stole...for a rightful cause (you will see what I mean when you see the movie; I don't want to spoil it for you)! As his lover is held hostage, Bobby has only one hope to save her: in Stig, a man who he does not completely trust...and who shares the same skepticism.

2 Guns, while hard to follow at times, keeps good mystery (for the most part....a special twist is intentionally revealed for good causes) and, in many ways, makes up for the loss of Die Hard 5 this year: it holds the same kind of action, comedy, drama, and suspense that made action films be taken seriously....while being completely original (outside the comic series its based off of) and fun! To top it off, you don't have action stars indulging in the action....you have real, serious, AND acclaimed actors indulging in it! Washington and Wahlberg may never own a comedy club, but in 2 Guns they show just how much they are capable of in comedy. Both actors give their best comedic performances yet, and yet never stray away from the hostile edge they made us fear them with in Training Day and The Departed. Paula Patton does an impeccable job at leading on an actor and character as smart as Denzel Washington/Bobby Trench and Bill Paxton's performance deserves accolades as well: he studied Tennessee Williams to perfect his character!

It doesn't get much better than this.",1375833600,2,2721,4.729957805907173
7289417,5,B00ZR3W40E,"""2 Guns"" is great! This is how the story goes: For the past 12 months, DEA agent Bobby Trench and U.S. naval intelligence officer Marcus Stigman have been reluctantly attached at the hip. Working undercover as members of a narcotics syndicate, each man distrusts his partner as much as the criminals they have both been tasked to take down.

When their attempt to infiltrate a Mexican drug cartel and recover millions goes haywire, Trench and Stigman are suddenly disavowed by their superiors. Now that everyone wants them in jail or in the ground, the only person they can count on is the other. Unfortunately for their pursuers, when good guys spend years pretending to be bad, they pick up a few tricks along the way.

The cast led by Denzel Washington (as Bobby) & Mark Wahlberg (as Stig) is great. The directing by Baltasar Kormakur is great. The screenplay (based on the graphic novels by Steven Grant) by Blake Masters is great.

The music by Clinton Shorter is great. The cinematography by Oliver Wood is great. The film editing by Michael Tronick is great. The casting by Sheila Jaffe is great. The production design by Beth Mickle is great. The art direction by Kevin Hardison is great. The set decoration by Leonard R. Spears, set dressings by Derek Bensonhaver, Gregory T. Geniusz, Ram Goradia, Prentice Randolph, David Thompson & Barker White, set designs by Wright McFarland, Adele Plauche & Trinh Vu is great. The costume design by Laura Jean Shannon is great. The special effects supervised by James Lorimer, coordinated by Ron Trost is great. The visual effects supervised by Janelle Croshaw, Dadi Einarsson & Charlie Iturriaga, coordinated by Eric Kimelton & Linda Kristjansdottir is great. The stunts coordinated by Darrin Prescott & Wade Allen is great.

This is a great action film that is entertaining and fast-paced. It is also, at times, funny, as well. Denzel Washington & Mark Wahlberg are a great on-screen team. This is also a great re-teaming of Wahlberg & his ""Contraband"" director Baltasar Kormakur. This is one of the best movies of the summer season, thus far.",1375488000,3,2093,4.920679886685552
7289418,4,B00ZR3W40E,"Theatrical review.  May contain spoilers.

It could be just my imagination but it seems that about this time every year Denzel Washington stars in an action based film with just enough comedy in the mix to warm up to audiences.  This year is no exception.  He teams up with Mark Wahlberg who is no stranger to the genre either.

Bobby (Washington) and Stig (Wahlberg) are seemingly a pair of bank robbing, drug runners doing business in Mexico with one of the feared cartels headed by Papi Greco (Edward James Olmos).  The pair, knowing where $3 million of drug money is held, decide to rob the small bank and clean out the safety deposit box.  Little did they expect that every deposit box had cash in it, totally $43 million.

It is no surprise thanks to the trailers that all is not what it seems.  Bobby is actually an undercover DEA agent and Stig is a Navy specialist also working under cover.  Neither were aware of the other's involvement.  It turns out that their bosses were both in on a complicated subterfuge and neither operative was aware.  To make things even dicier, the money actually belongs to the CIA's dirty man-in-charge (a convincingly despicable Bill Paxton).  If you're not confused enough, Bobby's sometime girlfriend Deb (drop dead gorgeous Paula Patton) is a co-worker who may or may not be involved somehow.

There is one thing for sure.  There is a lot of gun play and plenty of explicit violence, but what makes it all work is the give and take between Stig and Bobby.  It is damn funny stuff.  Washington and Wahlberg have great chemistry and perfect timing.  The film is directed by Iceland's Baltasar Kormakur Samper who is also responsible for ""Contraband"" also starring Wahlberg.  I give bonus points for a pair of surprises from Ms. Patton.  The film won't be up for any Oscars, but it's a fun time at the movies.",1375488000,2,1850,4.6687306501547985
7289419,4,B00ZR3W40E,"""2 Guns"" (2013 release; 109 min.) reunites director Baltasar Kormkur with Mark Wahlberg (they previously teamed up on another enjoyable crime action movie called ""Contraband""), and for good measure Denzel Washington is brought along to co-star. The plot is pretty convoluted, and I don't spoil anything when I simply say that you shouldn't accept anyone being who they say they are. Apart from that, everyone is chasing $41.125 million in drug money.

Several comments: first, once in a while I need to see a great action movie, and this one certainly lives up to its billing. As the movie opens we see the characters played by Washington and Wahlberg observing a bank which they've decided to rob, from across the street in a diner. Some funny back-and-forth banter between the two ensues but before you know it we are in the middle of the hold-up, and its aftermath. Second, almost more important than the actual plot is the writing of the movie. The script is sharp from that perspective, with lots of funny exchanges between the main characters. Third, the chemistry between Washington and Wahlberg is palpable, and carries much of the movie. Seems like these guys are enjoying themselves, so why wouldn't we enjoy ourselves too while watching the movie. Fourth, there are a number of smaller roles that nevertheless add a nice touch to the movie, in particular Edward James Olmos as the Mexican drug lord (made to look incredibly old for this role, which was also the case in that other recent movie he starred in, ""Filly Brown""), and even more so drop-dead gorgeous Paula Patton (a/k/a Mrs. Robin Thicke) as Washington's friend-with-benefits.

Bottom line: I really enjoyed this movie quite a bit, even more than I had expected/hoped for. I couldn't believe when the final scene came around, I mean time had simply flown by! The movie's ending incidentally would seem to open the door wide for a sequel (assuming this does well at the box office), so we may well be looking at ""3 Guns"" or ""2 Guns More"" in a year or two. The screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati today was quite well attended for a late matinee, and it seemed like the crowd was enjoying it as much as I was. No, this isn't going to win any Oscars, but if you are in the mood for a fast-paced buddy movie with great action scenes, you will almost certainly enjoy ""2 Guns"".",1375401600,42,2356,4.702179176755448
7289420,3,B00ZR3W40E,"Over the course of film history, there have been several successful onscreen duos.  From comedy to action flicks, just a few of the countless successful partnerships include Danny Glover and Mel Gibson in the Lethal Weapon franchise, Mike Myers and Dana Carvey in Wayne's World, and even Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker in the Rush Hour trilogy.  While not every partnership is perfect, the summer of 2013 has produced a series of mixed results for onscreen duos.  Most notably, the tandem of Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy stirred up the laughs in The Heat, while Ryan Reynolds and Jeff Bridges crashed and burned in R.I.P.D.  Now, two of Hollywood's biggest stars - Academy Award winner Denzel Washington and Academy Award nominee Mark Wahlberg have teamed-up in the Boom! comic book adaption, 2 Guns.  Will these two A-list film stars translate to box office success or is their partnership destined to fail?

Based on the 2007 comic book series written by Steve Grant and directed by Baltasar Kormkur (Contraband), 2 Guns stars Denzel Washington as DEA Agent Bobby Tranch and Mark Wahlberg as NCIS agent Marcus Stigman.  Unbeknownst to one another, both Trench and Stigman are working undercover together for their respective branches with different agendas, both including the same drug cartel, led by Papi Greco (Edward James Olmos).  The DEA is attempting to bust Greco for drugs, while NCIS is after the cartel's money - but after robbing a bank, both men realize they were setup by their respective agencies to take the fall.  Begrudgingly, Trench and Stiman are forced to work together to fend off their assailants and return the money to its rightful owner.  Bill Paxton, James Marsden, and Paula Patton also star in supporting roles.

On their own, Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg have created an abundance of memorable movie roles.  It only makes sense to add them in a film as co-stars and watch the fireworks - which is absolutely the outcome in 2 Guns.  These two charismatic, high-profile actors own their respective roles as they bicker amongst themselves, duke it out on occasion, and shoot the endless amount of bad guys.  There's no shortage of entertainment value with these two stars on the screen as they both incorporate comedy, gushing one-liners, and will undoubtedly eye-wink their way into the good graces of all the action lovers.  Although both Wahlberg and Washington earn an endorsement as a pleasantly entertaining onscreen duo, that's about the only positive attribute to take away from this film.

The poorly written, often horribly predictable plot is detrimental to the quality of this film.  For two supposedly smart characters, both Wahlberg and Washington's characters are played for saps on more than one occasion over the course of the film.  It's impatiently irksome at times to see the duo constantly one-up and outsmart each other, yet they are continuously played like a fiddle by the not-so-notorious villains of the film.  While the first half of the film features a great deal of mystery as to who is really pulling the strings of the plot, once the bad guy - in this case Bill Paxton - is revealed, there's really one way for the film to end.  Paxton's character is a bit over-the-top, largely due to his obsession with Russian roulette, but aside from his bark, he doesn't really offer the proper amount of bit.

The film also lacks a substantial amount of female presence, regardless of the tedious presence of Paula Patton.  She serves as Washington's love interest, only minus the interest.  For the brief scenes she's actually present, the writing for her character does absolutely nothing to enhance the plot and the final outcome of her character is even more of a bore.  Naturally, her character shows up just long enough to shed her clothes (which is an unnecessary exploitation that offers absolutely nothing to the film), only to disappear and sever the emotionally-lacking damsel in distress.  Compared to the majority of the action flicks out there, it's surprising both Washington and Wahlberg's characters didn't wind up with brain-dead interests.

It's easy to nitpick about action films and scold them for being similar to every other action flick that's ever been made.  However, despite the clumsy, unemotional plot and the lack of character development, there's still plenty of entertainment value to be found in this film.  There's just enough action to sustain the attention of most moviegoers, and it's actually refreshing to watch an action flick that isn't as typically overzealous as some of Stallone or Schwarzenegger's action extravaganzas.  As always, the number of bullets flying overhead is absurd, but 2 Guns is a nice change-of-pace summer film that didn't require a $200 million budget or the incorporation of ridiculous CGI aliens and an endless amount of buildings constantly toppling over.

Compared to the other comic book films of the summer, including Man of Steel, R.I.P.D. and Iron Man 3, 2 Guns is the most down-to-earth film out of the genre.  Most will be surprised to discover this film was based on a comic book, but that won't take away from the excitement that Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg bring to the screen.  The plot is fair and the cast is above average - making for an easy, safe film recommendation.  No, this isn't a perfect film, but it's an average summer flick that most movie lovers should feel comfortable watching.  The film can but crass at times, and it certainly doesn't exactly ooze with praise for the United States government and military - yet there's still a fair to high amount of entertainment value to be observed.  And, following the undoubted success of this film, the possibility of a sequel should loom large, especially with the recent launch of the comic book sequel, Three Guns.

I don't think Ive seen Wahlberg act in much of anything and he was probably good in The Departed because he was playing himself. If you replaced Wahlberg & Patton for some better actors or directed them in their scenes it would certainly have been much better. Theres a totally unbelievable plot but it really doesnt matter since its more about the money and the buddy cop scenario. Its another decent action movie based on a comic book and similar to a much older movie titled Charley Varrick. It started off very slowly but picked up some action after about 20-minutes. I don't like the 5-star rating system but would say the Metascore of 55 is pretty close, as well as the Rotten Tomato of 64 so thats about 3-stars on this site.",1487548800,,802,4.425675675675675

7289605,4,B00ZR3W40E,"2 Guns
 2 Guns is billed as an action/comedy and it delivers on both counts.  The producers rounded up a stellar cast of seasoned pros.  Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg headline the film.  Backing them up in various ways are Bill Paxon, James Marsden, Fred Ward and Edward James Olmos.  Wahlberg has a habit of playing tough guys who have an admirable streak of honor and loyalty but limited intellect.  In 2 Guns he stretches just a bit to portray the same traits but also hints that he may not be as limited as he seems.  But he is by no stretch in the same league brain wise as the tough, controlled and very cockily cool character played so well by Denzel Washington.
 Paula Patton plays the girl.  Her character is shamed, duplicitous, greedy, broken hearted and ultimately doomed.  It wasn't easy to squish all that drama into the small amount of screen time she is allowed but Patton pulls it off handily.
 Baltasar Kormakur directs from a script from first time writer Blake Masters.  Kormakur also directed last years gritty crime saga Contraband which also featured Mark Wahlberg, a very successful film.
 Besides the lineup of name actors in just about every scene, the convoluted, twisty plot keeps us awake.  We have the two main characters who are each undercover operatives for different agencies.  They work against one another for the first part of the movie until the corruption of their superiors becomes clear.  At one point they are being opposed, chased, and shot at by organized crime narcotraficanties, the CIA on a murderous vendetta and a gang of covetous Navy SEALS gone bad.  This makes plenty of opportunities for gunfire and violence of all sorts.  And the lover of the Washington character, another fallen agent, is also out to get her piece of $43 million that is the center of all the action.  The plot is very busy and always manages to stay just on the believable side.
 And the writing lets Washing and Wahlberg quip and joke their way through the film.  They are not in any way overboard on this.  In some of the more recent Sylvester Stallion films this kind of banter is done with a knowing wink wink to the viewers.  Here it seems to be a natural-and funny-extension of the personalities of the characters.
 2 Guns is a solid three saw blade experience.  It is rated R for lots of violence, some language and some small skin issues.  It runs one hour and 49 minutes.  The producers allowed director Kormakur $61 million to make the film.  It has taken in $27 million in its opening weekend, which puts it at number one.  Kormakur in his previous outing with Wahlberg managed to quadruple the producers investment.  I think audiences will reward 2 Guns with at least a positive return.
 Even in a less important film like this one, Danzel Washington is well worth watching.",1469836800,,2816,4.685714285714286

I suppose after playing serious roles like ""Malcolm X"", ""Training Day"", and ""Flight', one might feel the need to make a ""fun"" movie with little or no thought to characterization. There really is nothing to see here that we haven't seen before; Denzel as a crooked cop (Training Day); Mark Wahlberg as a tough-yet-sensitive, smart-mouthed-yet-lovable character (every movie Mark Wahlberg has ever done), etc, etc. If for some reason you get stuck watching this movie, or worse, decide to find out for yourself what the fuss is all about, make sure you have plenty of distractions to keep yourself occupied. You'll most likely find yourself bored with the story and characters fairly soon.",1465430400,,1195,4.6415094339622645

The story was complex, well written, like a novel and like the cover, goes all the way-mind blowing! Very intense, intriguing with an all-star cast! Bill Paxton's back but this time, as the mean-guy in the CIA and never saw James Marsden play a marine or a bad guy, but he did it justice just as well as he has done many of his other supporting roles over the past decade. Also great humor, makes me think, action packed. Everything you want in a movie. Didn't expect much, but thoroughly enjoyed it. A must-see, other wise, missed opportunity.

'Stig' Stigman'(Wahlberg) work for completely separate 'federal agencies',
Neither know the status of the other, in fact they both believe the other will
help them bust the drug cartel's money trail.
The two rob a bank stealing the deposited monies of the drug cartels...but, who's
money have they really taken.
They have certainly upped the anti as the pair are now being tracked by several
different organisations, so much so there seems to be nobody left that can be
trusted.
Plenty of explosive action on offer with a good measure of humour along the way as
the two blaze a trail across the big screen'

'Marc Wahlberg'

7289852,4,B00ZR3W40E,"Two Guns(released Aug/13)stars,among others Denzel Washington,Mark Wahlberg,Bill Paxton and Fred Ward. I found this film had a a good pace,a lot of twists and turns and decent action.
The story finds Denzal and Mark hooked up as two guys robbing a bank. But wait there is a back story.""A week earlier""  flashes on the screen and we see the two in Mexico having dealings with a drug king pin. Denzel hands over passports while the cocaine the for payment doesn't appear as promised. Instead he gets paid in cash. He leaves the passports with the dealer and says he will wait for the coke. They leave but are stopped trying to re enter the States. Here we find that Denzel is actually a DEA agent. Once released we also find out that Mark is an agent for the Navy. The kicker being that neither guy know who the other actually is. Fast forward and we're back at the moment we entered the movie and the bank is being robbed. There is only supposed to be around $3 million in it,but as it turns out there is more than $43 million.
The two high tail it out of town and sit pondering their haul. Just as Denzel is going to arrest Mark,Mark gets the upper hand and shoots him in the shoulder,leaving him in the desert. He rendezvous's with his Naval superiors but they turn on him and he is soon on the run. Before he flees he learns the money is going to a Naval Station in Corpus Christi.
Enter a third party looking for the money,Bill Paxton and friends. We eventually learn he is CIA and it was their money the two stole. Denzel having escaped the desert,gets patched up and reconnoiters Mark's apartment. Mark however is across the street on a roof with a sniper rifle. He has Denzel in his sights constantly. The two first talk by phone but soon after Naval company comes to storm the apartment and Denzel barely manages to escape. Mark and Denzel hook up once more and Denzel attends the home of his DEA boss to let him in on what is going down. Paxton however has beat him there and the two have a sit down as to what will happen from here. Simply put,Denzel will get the $43 million in question and return it to them in exchange for his freedom.
He and Mark head for the U.S.home of the Mexican drug dealer and kidnap him .They interrogate him in a garage but they are over run by the drug dealer's men and get captured. They are taken back to Mexico and are about to be tortured when Paxton shows up wanting his money. The drug dealer and Paxton reach an understanding and Mark and Denzel are set free to get the money.
The two return to the States and go to the Naval Station. The money however is not there and it seems a friend of Denzel's has turned and has been secretly working with a Navy rep to keep the money for themselves. Denzel's friend is being held by the drug dealer. But when she admits she hasn't the money, nor does Denzel(despite his saying he does),he kills her. Denzel finds her body later which has a clue as to the whereabouts of the dough. He finds it in a hotel room they frequented.
The plot comes winding down at the drug dealers farm in Mexico where Mark arrives saying he has the money in his trunk(which he doesn't).Paxton arrives and then Denzel shows up with the actual funds in his trunk. As Mark and Denzel walk away Denzel,by remote,blows up the car he drove in on. There is a fire fight and Paxton and the drug dealer finally go down for the count. As the two sit in a restaurant talking about their experiences ,Denzel reveals he just may not have blown ALL of the money up.
The fact that neither men knew each other's actual jobs was a hoot. As was introducing three other parties that had a stake in getting the money. Denzel and Mark had an excellent on screen chemistry. While I usually find Mark's acting quite lame and wooden,I found this was a perfect role for him. He brought it, and worked on a par with Denzel,no question. Edward Olmos turned in a good performance as the drug dealer and Paxton was one part menacing,one part crazy as the CIA operative.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include deleted scenes and commentary.
All in all a decent action film with some funny twists and turns. The entire cast turns in a good performance and this is bound to please all the action fans out there. 3 1/2-4 stars.",1428192000,,4316,4.354838709677419

The actors are stellar. And they are given fantastic dialogue. I just love that kind of snappy, rich conversation. You can feel the layers of interaction. These aren't cardboard characters. They have rich depth and personality.

And the storyline sucks you in. Each time you think you have something figured out, something else unfolds.

This is one of those movies you want to see without knowing ANYTHING about it. Not even a hint. I was fortunate enough to have a friend present it to me blind. I had no expectations. It made all of those unveilings that much more fun.

Well recommended.",1425513600,,850,4.761904761904762

The plot is incomprehensible.
Not good enough to be a bad episode of Miami Vice.
But that said, Denzel is always fun, and Mark Wahlberg brings a manic energy, and the bad guys are reasonable interesting.  The only casting dud is the girl who is NOT Bobby Bean's girl friend.  When she dies, you are relieved that you don't have to hear her talk anymore or watch her move carefully so that her hair covers her boobs when she's supposed to be naked.

Lots of action. Worth watching unless you haven't  yet seen any Johnny To movies. In which case come back later and we'll talk. The scales will fall from your eyes because Johnny To is the best noir/action director since Melville.",1415664000,,700,4.488188976377953

Two men, both expert-shots and experts in hand to hand combat, seem unable to get along and seem to work together, or are they able to get along? The movie is filled with other questions. Why are they working together? The DEA and Navy are both involved in combating a particular drug lord. But are they? Are the agencies involved but do the leaders of the groups combating them, or one of them, have a different agenda? What is it? Who is helping them?
Things go wrong. Why? The film is filled with double crosses. Who is double crossing who? The two men think they are robbing a bank to take out three million dollars, but they find 43.125 million dollars. Why? A new man, very vicious appears wanting the stolen money returned. He says it is his. Who is he?  Viewers will certainly enjoy this roller coaster ride. The actors are great and the plot grabs you.",1414627200,,938,4.583333333333333

When did movies get so lazy and stop putting bullet holes in things and just start using sparklers on so many vehicles and objects to pretend they were shot with a bullet?

7290127,4,B00ZR3W40E,"...and the surprise winner of the year goes to 2 Guns! The only reason I decided to watch this film is because I am a huge Denzel Washington fan, however my expectations for it were extremely low. It's rare, but occasionally, a preview can harm the reputation of a film, and that's what happened here. The previews make this film out to be nothing for than a big gun fight with the occasional cheesy line, but it's so much more than that. In a unique twist, two undercover agents, from two separate agencies, wind up going after the same man. Looking for a way into his organization, they find each other and assume the other works for the bad guy. Both Washington and Mark Wahlberg create characters and put on a good show for the other, having no idea that they're actually working towards the same goal. What really makes this film work is the chemistry between Wahlberg and Washington. Denzel is plays his usual level headed, super intense character, while Wahlberg's playing a laid back, reckless guy, who actually does have some pretty funny lines, that they weren't about to show in the previews. Together they go through on an amazing adventure, full of good guys and bad guy crossing and double-crossing each other. There are at least a half dozen factions tied to this evil man, in different ways for different reasons, and each representative is more unique than the other, leading to some amazing interactions. 2 Guns is the story of 2 agents caught in the middle of a huge conspiracy, that seemingly involves every one. While that may be confusing to some, I found it refreshing, because the truth is you never knew what would happen next. When one side struck, it could have been anyone, for any reason. The unique story and large supporting cast, paired with the terrific chemistry between the two stars, made for an absolute classic that fell under most peoples radars. If you're looking for a good movie, that will have you on the edge of your seat, then you should check out 2 Guns! I can't recommend it enough.",1404000000,,2029,4.654596100278551

7290131,4,B00ZR3W40E,"I've always marveled at how a script can be written containing really heavy stuff but will put the right jokes in at the right time to keep things from getting too overwrought. This is one of those films.

Here's the scoop. A DEA agent (Denzel Washington) and a Navy Intelligence agent (Mark Whalberg) team up and rob a bank. Neither knows the others' true identity. When the take on the heist is way more than it should have been they realize something stinks and need to dig themselves out of a huge mess.

This is a nifty flick. It's a complex plot where the information is divvied out evenly as things progress. It's loaded with clever verbal exchanges, particularly between Washington and Wahlberg. There are a lot of close calls and a fair amount of violence. There is also a decent amount of stuff happening with cars. Chases, blow-ups and the like. There were also a lot of cool tunes peppered throughout. What's really happening here though is the Washington Wahlberg enemy/buddy thing. You like how the circumstances in the plot change their relationship. Edward James Olmos is on hand as the ruthless drug lord and Bill Paxton (whom I never considered all that good an actor) really steps up to the plate as the crooked CIA agent. You just love to hate him.

On the downside. You like Wahlberg but you know that any intelligence agent won't have his demeanor. He's too friendly and optimistic. Then there's the Paula Patton character. I like Patton. She has a good camera face and acts quite well but they screwed up her part. When we find out what side of the fence she falls on it's too quick and with too dire a consequence. There needed to be way more meat on those bones.

That being said, this is still a great ride. Too few movies show this kind of assuredness in balancing the light with the heavy. This is a real guy flick for guys who want a beer in both hands.",1403740800,,1882,4.510263929618769

- Starsky & Hutch
- Tango & Ca- hold up, the list should maybe go last. It's a list of my favorite buddy cop shows, on which 2 Guns immediately ranks. I never would've thought it, but Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg make an uproarious team. These are two actors that, to me, normally wouldn't register as comic performers. But 2 Guns' core appeal resides in the sharp interplay between them. They're surprisingly well matched.

The set-up: Take two swaggerful characters, each an undercover lawman, except they don't know the other one is. Wily DEA agent Robert Trench (Denzel Washington) has spent the past three years rooting in the dirt, posing as the slick Bobby Beans a.k.a. ""I Know A Guy"" Bobby, trying to get the goods on Mexican drug lord Papi Greco (Edward James Olmos). Somewhere, somewhen, Bobby picked up an associate named Stig (Wahlberg). Stig is a bit of a wild card, a bit of a loose cannon. Unbeknownst to Bobby, Stig is U.S. Navy Petty Officer Michael Stigman, deployed on covert assignment for Naval Intelligence. It evens out. That Bobby is DEA is unbeknownst to Stig.

2 Guns opens with Bobby Beans and Stig on the verge of robbing a bank in Tres Cruces, New Mexico. There's a smidge of a flashback sequence that sets up motivation - it's all to do with that the bank contains $3 million of the drug lord's cash.

The plot thickens when Bobby and Stig pull off the heist but are shocked to learn that their haul isn't $3 million but, rather, $43,125,000. Pangs of deep concern worm in, and, me, I would've put that money back stat. Because that is way too much money and someone's bound to come lookin'. And sure 'nuff. There go Bobby Beans and Stig on the run, pursued by just about everyone from both sides of the law.

It's adapted from Steven Grant's graphic novel from Boom! Studios, and maybe that explains away the stylized action set pieces. 2 Guns absolutely mines the buddy cop formula. It's chock full of banter that probably comes off more awesome than it has a right to be mostly because Denzel and Wahlberg are just that amazing together. Denzel doesn't do a lot of comedy, so there's gratification in watching him perform out of his wheelhouse and doing so well. Still, no matter what, I never expect Denzel to suck in whatever role he takes on. What's got me gobsmacked is how funny Wahlberg is. The last time I've been this startled was when Channing Tatum proved he could be very funny. Anyway, the playful chemistry between the two leading men is what drives the film and what gets the viewer invested. Of course, it doesn't hurt that they're playing kickass federal agents who get particular joy out of messing with each other.

It's a solid supporting cast, as well, with Paula Patton and her badonkadonk providing knuckle-gnawing eye candy. Bill Paxton, Edward James Olmos, and Fred Ward lend weight as the heavies/obstructive elements. Bill Paxton, particularly, has got that devilish glint in his eye. But I don't like his tweaking of Russian Roulette because one should never mess with a classic.

7290156,1,B00ZR3W40E,"This film is well produced, photographed, and acted. The cast are well cast. The action is well choreographed. What's the problem. Why did I give it but one star?

The problem is that the movie has a message - a definite point of view that producers want to get across while you are being distracted by the charm of the two male leads and the razzle-dazzle of all the shootings.

What is the message? Simple - there are good guys and there are bad guys. The good guts are illegal aliens. The bad guys are any kind of white government figure - the whiter the more evil and corrupt. In this fevered mindset all the traditional institutions that show up to restore moral order - the cops, the FBI, the military - are shown to be crooks and sadists.

Both Washington and  Wahlberg are bent but their sponsoring organizations even more so. The really evil organization in this profoundly anti-American propaganda piece is the CIA. The script keeps hammering away at the CIA so as to make the audience conditioned to its presence the way Spielberg did with the shark in 'Jaws'. When someone says 'CIA' everyone is supposed to cringe like when you heard that driving low theme and the camera focused on the water.

There never has been a screen Nazi as cruel and sadistic as Bill Paxton is as the CIA guy in this movie. He makes Anton Differing look like Mr. Rogers. What is the agenda behind this over the top characterization? Paxton whom we remember as the clear eyed cool and charismatic tornado chaser in 'Twister' or as the warm hearted bigamist (trigamist?)  on HBO, is here the essence of corruption, betrayal and cruelty.

Normally the US Military has always been portrayed in the movies as a source of stability and integrity. In the alien invasion films like 'War of the Worlds' or 'Battle Los Angeles' the military are just about the only groups you can trust. They may lose the struggle, but they die trying. Here, this movie designed to corrode the audience's faith in all conventional sources of American courage and hope. The Navy, as seen here, is filled with treacherous, corrupt and feckless characters. It's as if when the cavalry rides in to save the stage coach from the Indians your best response would be to shoot the troopers and embrace the savages.

In this movie the murderous Mexican drug cartel hoodlums are still among the bad guys, but they are the most honorable and sympathetic of the various bad guy groups competing for our attention. They get to blame their badness on US foreign policy.

So are there no groups that are sympathetic? Yes. There is one group that is portrayed as innocent victims. We are shown their suffering and encouraged to identify with them. These are the illegal aliens, who in a gratuitous scene that has nothing to do with the plot, are shown with the two male leads walking through the desert and wading the Rio Grande. Edward James Olmos gives a little political speech to orient the audience as to whom to hate - the United States.

Paula Paton takes off her top for the very tepid sex scene with Washington. She is one of those half black female stars who looks mostly white so as to be attractive to mainstream audiences, but who still is dark enough to not freak out the white audience when she cavorts naked with the fully black male lead. At this point in our cultural evolution complete black-white romance is still taboo. Eva Mendes does much the same for Will Smith in his movies. Ms. Paton provides the gratuitous sex in a movie meal where the main course is gratuitous violence.

I think with possibly only one exception - every star and every supporting character in this movie is shot at sometime or other. The male pair of 'buddy cops' of course just laugh it off. In the bad old days the hero could walk through a hail of gunfire unscathed. In today's more realistic shoot-em-ups, the heroes can get shot - but it doesn't bother them much.

This is the kind of movie that you would like to like, but which is so transparent in its political manipulations that you are pulled right out of the fantasy experience. The motives of the movie makers are bad. The real evil people are not on the screen - they are the producers and screenwriters.",1399507200,2,4211,4.59254327563249

I wanted to see how these guys could take on the CIA and the Drug Cartels and the Navy and bad guys from them. This is the first movie that I have ever seen that the good guys can shoot and hit bottles and cans and penny's thrown in the air and still hit the bad guys. Most times they shoot 50 rounds and never hit a bad guy. One of our heros could shoot. These two guys and their girlfriend were in jobs that could never succeed but made for a wonderful exciting and very watchable movie.

I rate it almost a 4 star but it is at least one star below Parker so it gets a 3 star. I recommend the movie as great entertainment.",1395964800,,713,3.986013986013986

7290319,2,B00ZR3W40E,"Totally unrealistic.  I expect that, but I was surprised they didn't start flying.  However, they were bulletproof, which is pretty good.  Also the expected ""chemistry"" between the leading actors didn't materialize to any great extent.",1393804800,,235,5.6571428571428575
7290320,4,B00ZR3W40E,"Good cast...funny....however, lots of gunfire going on.  Denzel Washington and Mark Walberg were great.  I'd recommend this to an adult crowd.",1393804800,,142,5.714285714285714
7290321,4,B00ZR3W40E,"Non stop action and surprising humor throughout.  If you like either of these macho guys in their typical role, imagine them mashed up together fighting for the spotlight of top gun.",1393804800,,182,4.870967741935484

7290324,2,B00ZR3W40E,"I would have expected something more then just a violent movie, especially considering Washington was in the cast. Unfortunately likely the movie industry is running out of ideas",1393545600,,178,5.392857142857143

7290336,4,B00ZR3W40E,"Not too many dull moments in the movie. Denzel and Mark play fairly well off each other. There are some humorous exchanges which liven up the film. Not that it needs much else to keep you engaged. If you like two member shoot 'em ups, with some blow ups, then you'll like this one.",1393545600,,281,4.222222222222222

7290352,3,B00ZR3W40E,This movie didn't live up to it's trailer actually it shou;ld be considered a comedy . The acting was aqueduct but not up to the standard of  Washington and Walberg . if you have nothing else to watch I guess it would pass but believe me you have to be really bored if you need to view this  movie.,1393200000,,298,4.033898305084746

7290366,3,B00ZR3W40E,Reflecting on how it was marketed as a great suspense/action movie it lacked these factors that mostly do exist with a Washington and Wahlberg action movie (in my opinion).,1393200000,,172,4.9655172413793105
7290367,3,B00ZR3W40E,"Not much of a story line,lots of action,shooting and very weak character portrail.not really even slightly believable. More bullets flying than a small military invasion.",1393200000,,170,5.84

7290370,5,B00ZR3W40E,This movie was a different kind of action movie and quite entertaining. I believe it is rated R but I wouldn't let that rating prevent you from viewing this movie as it was more PG-13 than R,1393113600,,190,4.162162162162162

7290372,4,B00ZR3W40E,"Denzel saved this movie, a persuasive performance, an excellent actor.  Wahlberg was good in this movie, as he seemed to add a lighter touch, a bit of amusement or humor to his performance. If Wahlberg would take some diction lessons so he would stop mumbling his lines (see also: ""Shooter""), Wahlberg would have a better screen presence.",1393027200,,338,4.9298245614035086

DENZEL STILL CLASSY YET WITTY MARK WAHLBERG COCKY AS USUAL, THEY BOTH PLAYED OFF OF EACH OTHER VERY WELL.  THIS MOVIE WAS ENGAGING. THE PLOT TWIST WAS NOT AS INVOLVED OR AS COMPLICATED AS IT COULD'VE BEEN HOWEVER I STILL LOVED IT AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT.  THIS MOVIE WAS ENTERTAINING ENGAGING AND KEPT ME LAUGHING THROUGH THE WHOLE MOVIE.  ""WE AINT PEOPLE NOW, WE'RE FAMILY!""",1392768000,,476,4.7439024390243905

7290441,3,B00ZR3W40E,"While I am definitely a Denziel fan and I love Mark Wahlberg, there was something about this film that didn't quite live up to what I expected. Maybe because it was too average, and with those 2 stars, it should have been above average. Yes, there was action, and yes there was actually a plot, although at times it was a bit hard to follow. But there was a drag in the storytelling, which didn't need to be there, and the movie was also a bit too long to tell whatever it was they were trying to tell us.
In a nutshell, the movie was ok, but it wasn't as ok as it should have been with these 2 stars in it.",1392336000,2,607,3.9836065573770494

7290444,4,B00ZR3W40E,not a bad movie.  If you like drug dealing movies and high paid movie stars this movie delivers.  Late night movie for sure!!!,1392249600,,126,4.434782608695652

7290467,3,B00ZR3W40E,"One of those all-too-typical buddy type movies where the buddies are constantly at each other's throats.  2 Guns is okay as far as it goes, but the dialogue is just too clever; too witty.  It is so clever, in fact, that it just doesn't ring true at all.  The constant clever banter is just too good to have any semblance of realism and enters the realm of comedy much of the time.  (SPOILER ALERT) And then there's the running gag where one buddy shoots the other and then the other buddy returns the ""favor"".  But it's all okay, isn't it?  What's a little bullet in your body?  2 Guns is perfectly watchable and not intended to do anything but entertain.  No thinking required with this one.  None.  At all.

7290506,3,B00ZR3W40E,"2 Guns is a fairly standard buddy action film elevated slightly on the strength of its two leads:  Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg.  The film is based on a graphic novel published by Boom! Studios.  Washington plays Robert Trench, and undercover DEA Agent and Wahlberg is Michael Stigman, and under cover Naval Intelligence Officer.  The rub here is that neither one knows the other is undercover.  They each think the other is a criminal in the process of making a buy and summarily taking down a Mexican drug lord named Papi Greco (Olmos).  Their plan involves robbing a small-town New Mexico bank that Papi uses to launder money.  However when they rob the bank, they found far more money than they expected$43 million to be exact.

After the heist, Stigman follows orders to betray Trench and escape with the money.  Bus discovering Tench is in law enforcement; he merely wounds him, rather than kill him.  Stegman is then betrayed himself by his commanding officer, Quince (James Marsden) who attempts to have him killed in the desert.  Stigman manages to escape and later meets up with Trench to try and figure out what is going on.  When they kidnap and interrogate Greco, they discover that the money they stole belongs to the CIA and a psychotic Black Ops Agent named Earl (Paxton) is intent on getting every dollar back, no matter who he has to kill.  He begins the bloodbath by killing Tenchs superior and framing him for the murder.  The DEA Agent and Naval Intelligence Office have to put aside their own differences to stay alive and try to retrieve the money.

2 Guns offers little new in the way of the buddy cop/odd couple formula.  As you would expect Washington plays the more straight forward role while Walhberg plays the smartass part.  But both are so enjoyable that you can overlook the run-of-the-mill plot and the other one-dimensional characters.  Olmos is laughably tame as a ruthless drug lord.  At one point he captures the pair and hangs them upside down to beat them with baseball bats.  Well, beat is a little harsh; he gives them a few love taps like hes trying to bunt for a base hit.  Paxton, however, steals the show as the sadistic CIA agent who enjoys forcing those hes interrogating to play Russian Roulette.

Despite being based on a graphic novel, the film borrows a bit too liberally from the vastly superior 1973 caper film Charley Varrick in which Walter Matthau led a small-time band of crooks in the robbery of (again) a small-town New Mexico Bank only to find much more money than expected.  There are shootouts aplenty as you might expect from the name as Trench and Stigman manages to fire their way out of one tight situation after another, each with more impossible odds than the previous.  Director Baltasar Kormkur does a fine job with the action scenes but its the in-between scenes that bog things down and make the film seem even longer than 109 minutes.

The ending is predictable, especially in revealing the pair managed to stash away some of the money for them but its mostly a fun ride getting from beginning to end.

Blu-Ray Extras

Audio Commentary with Director Baltasar Kormkur and Producer Adam Siegel

Click, Click, Bang, Bang: The Making of 2 Guns (30:18)  This is a four-part making of documentary that covers some of the main material discussed in the commentary but also features interviews with the cast as well as looks at wardrobe and weapons.

Deleted Scenes (11:50)  Eight deleted scenes are included although none of them are essential and in a film that is already stretched 10  15 minutes too long you can see why these were cut.

7290575,3,B00ZR3W40E,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

If there's one action sub-genre that never fails to be entertaining, it would be that of the buddy cop variety. The concept of two very different people teaming up to achieve a common goal always brings forth this fun, lightheartedness, which makes for a nice change of pace from the usual serious, cookie cutter characters found in your everyday action thriller. This aspect alone makes 2 Guns worth it, but, unfortunately, I found the writers relied too much on this element of the story, which made the narrative feel sloppy and, at times, a little hard to follow. Complex and incoherent are far from synonymous, and 2 Guns is the perfect example of this. However, although the payoff was never satisfying, the journey itself was very enjoyable.

2 Guns follows Robert ""Bobby"" Trench (Denzel Washington) and Michael ""Stig"" Stigman (Mark Wahlberg), two supposed guns-for-hire who each hold a secret that will soon make life very difficult for the both of them. What they don't know is that each is an undercover agent with their own personal plan, and the truth doesn't come out until they rob a bank that was supposed to be holding three million dollars belonging to a Mexican drug lord by the name of Papi Greco (Edward James Olmos). However, the bank was actually holding $43 million of CIA money, and now the duo must go on the run from the cartel, the navy, and the CIA. At the same time, secrets get revealed, friends are slain, and an unusual friendship forms between the two leads.

The unique thing about 2 Guns is its ability to entertain while being incredibly ridiculous. From start to finish the writing is witty and bouncy, the story is filled with plenty of laughs, and the chemistry between the two leads is phenomenal. However, at its core, the story is a ludicrously dark representation of humanity. No one in the movie can be trusted, there is never any hesitation when it came down to double-crossing someone, and CIA agents are running around harming and killing innocent civilians. The overwhelming cynicism became extremely unbearable by the halfway mark, and by the end of the film I felt this odd form of depression because no one seemed to truly care about anyone but themselves.

In addition, there were a few personal relationships, and a handful of side characters, that never felt fleshed out or explained. For example, in my opinion, the side-relationship between Deb (Paula Patton) and Quince (James Marsden) felt as if it was shoehorned in just as a way to add some unnecessary complexity to an already off-the-rails narrative. Their reason for being together was never explained, and the viewer never actually witnessed them in the same room together. Furthermore, time and time again 2 Guns fails to flesh out the backgrounds of these personal relationships. The viewer never gets told how Bobby and Stigman meet, which feels like a vital part of the story, and the same can be said for Deb and Quince.

With that said, what truly drives this movie forward is its fun atmosphere and the great chemistry between its two leads. Washington and Wahlberg may have two very different acting styles, but whenever they were on screen together you knew you were going to have a laugh or two. In a way, this unique pairing only adds to the performances because the differences in their personalities translates perfectly to the differences in their characters. Bobby is the serious character trying to get the job done, and Stigman never hesitates to crack a joke or attempt to lighten the mood. Although neither gave the performance of their careers, the way they played off of each other was highly enjoyable.

Finally, the film's score, composed by Clinton Shorter, is anything but groundbreaking, but it does do an excellent job of creating a sense of atmosphere for the entire hour and 40 minutes. The compositions range from jumpy, country western music to these intense, dramatic pieces used to elevate the more energetic segments in the film. Thankfully, this is generally a nice combination, and both elements work surprisingly really well together. However, neither do much to impress for the entire length of the film. As previously stated, the music is very atmospheric, and it fits the film perfectly, but from an artistic standpoint it's a little underwhelming.

Overall Score: 6.9/10 - 2 Guns does the unthinkable by providing an extremely fun and entertaining movie that is littered with flaws and inconsistencies. Whalberg and Washington work extremely well together, and Denzel occasionally surpasses the emotional limitations of the script, but the narrative they're working with undeniably lacked the polish necessary to make this work as well as it should have. Nonetheless, I would still strongly recommend this as a rental, or even a purchase if you can get your hands on it for a good discount.

7290586,2,B00ZR3W40E,"The story was stale, the plot was predictable from the word go, the characters were cardboard cutouts. Just...meh. It wasn't bad enough to be fun and it wasn't good enough to be entertaining. Look, talking fast is not enough to be clever or funny. If it were, then Chris Tucker would be fighting off the job offers with a stick. And these movies are usually about juxtaposition of types. When both of your leads are smarmy, fast-talking punks, there is no one for them to bounce off of and you just get a bunch of gibberish and no punch lines. What's the main difference between the two leads? Their races. Oh, and one of them keeps changing his hat for no good reason. That's what passes for characterization in this movie. He even finds the time to change it several times while on the run from federal agents and military investigators who will kill him on sight.

The plot was a big snore. Every time a new character showed up they might as well have had a big sign around their neck that said ""villain"" or ""comedy relief"" or ""I will betray you later"". They were so blatant that I was able to tell you exactly how the rest of the movie was going to progress, right down to some of the dialogue to be used, after about 10 minutes in. There were no surprises because the ads and every single plot synopsis tells you, flat out, everything that is going to happen in the first half hour of the movie.

A quick word about nude scenes. There needs to be a reason for them to be in a movie. We get a nude scene in this movie that was so pointless that I am surprised the actress involved agreed to it. The scene is repeated, almost word for word a few minutes later in the movie, but in the second version she is wearing a bra. It seemed an awful lot like the director shot two versions of the one scene and then used them both to pad out the movie.

And the ending? Ugh...a bunch of stupid explosions and ""idiot logic"" followed by a beat for beat retread of the first bank robbery stakeout from earlier in the movie. There is a way to make these scenes work and this isn't it. By the way, why did the ""heroes"" go walking into the desert after the shootout? There were other cars they could have taken. Did the director think it looked cool for a bleeding man to fast-talk his way off into the burning desert and certain death?

If you want to see the movie the director obviously thought he was making, go watch either of the first two ""lethal Weapon"" movies. Those films were wonderfully entertaining and they contained similar elements, but those movies succeeded where this one just wheezes along.",1390089600,,2598,4.3615702479338845
7290587,4,B00ZR3W40E,"I was going to pass on this, after seeing the trailers.  It looked like a forced buddy movie that most probably was going to dump a recycled Hollywood action plot on viewers.  But it is not a traditional buddy flick.  It is not a canned action story.  In fact, it has quite a few small twists that keep the movie interesting.

The acting is superb, especially because both main characters are pretending to be people they are not when they are together.  And the supporting cast is terrific.  All well-known pros who become their characters.

The action is fun, intense, but not over-the-top.  It is always believable.  It keeps coming too.

The plot is fun because it has so many players after the same cash.  The two protagonists have to deal with each other, each one's respective group, a cruel CIA operative and his goons, as well as a drug kingpin and his cartel brothers.

So, sit back and enjoy this one.  It is a great film.  Not sure it's worth buying.  It's re-watch value is low after you see how everything unfolds.

7290598,4,B00ZR3W40E,Perfect casting.  Don't pay attention to the reality of the situation...this movie is great gun shlock for guys getting lit with friends.,1390003200,,137,5.2272727272727275
7290599,5,B00ZR3W40E,Loved the movie & Love both actors. Packed well & arrived on time as always. It's worth the money & I think everyone will like it as well.,1390003200,,138,3.9642857142857144

7290601,4,B00ZR3W40E,Lot of action and shooting in this movie. I like the 2 stars in it and thought they were good together.,1389916800,,103,3.9523809523809526
7290602,5,B00ZR3W40E,Excellent movie. Well done. Both stars did an outstanding job. I watched it 3 times right off the bat. Can't go wrong here.,1389916800,,123,4.391304347826087
7290603,5,B00ZR3W40E,Two of my favorite actors of all times.  Wonderful plot and loved the whole thing!! They both did an amazing job of acting of course!,1389916800,,133,4.32
7290604,3,B00ZR3W40E,"OK, we've seen this time and time again - Black guy and White guy get a long kicking tail and taking names. Then, the break down ""are you with me or are you not?!"" lastly ""let's work together and figure this thing out"". I thought the movie was going to be terrible but I had nothing else to watch so I purchased it. I must say, I was fully entertained the entire film. It's funny at times, action packed, and tells a good story.",1389830400,,428,4.107142857142857
7290605,4,B00ZR3W40E,"The only thing I like about 2 Guns is that there's a lot more funny punch lines than the action in the movie itself. Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg make a dynamic duo in this action thriller. Great script. A great cast, and plenty of action. That's why I'm giving this movie four stars. Because it's good.",1389830400,,310,4.456140350877193
7290606,5,B00ZR3W40E,Very enjoyable movie.....like movies that I can't guess the end.  Denzel was up to par unusual. Would recommend to others,1389830400,,121,5.05
7290607,5,B00ZR3W40E,It was fun to watch. Had some good twists. Although the ending was good the very last part was defiantly not realistic.,1389830400,,119,4.454545454545454
7290608,4,B00ZR3W40E,Entertaining but not Denzel or Mark's best by a long shot. It is worth watching and has it's good points.,1389830400,,105,4.3
7290609,4,B00ZR3W40E,What's not to love...Denzel Washington & Mark Wahlberg in an action comedy is a perfect combo.  The 4 instead of 5 is only because its a smidge predictable.,1389830400,,156,4.571428571428571
7290610,5,B00ZR3W40E,"I enjoyed this movie, it was great I just think that the shipping fees for movies and vhs are too high.",1389830400,,103,3.9523809523809526
7290611,4,B00ZR3W40E,Some good twists and turns in the plot. It keeps your attention through out the movie.  Worth watching if you like action and character interaction.,1389830400,,148,4.92
7290612,4,B00ZR3W40E,"I like the main actors in this movie, so I figured I give it a try.
I enjoyed the movie no more no less.",1389830400,,104,3.375
7290613,5,B00ZR3W40E,"D. Washington & Wahlberg are absolutely fabulous in this movie. There's plenty of action and plot twists complete with deception, betrayal and balls out revenge to keep the viewers interested and at the edge of their seats.  Don't miss this one!",1389744000,,245,4.975609756097561
7290614,4,B00ZR3W40E,"With connection operating at 10MPS or better movie would constantly buffer and lock up. This was at 2:00 am on Jan 15.
This is not the service quality that I would expect form a first rate streaming service.",1389744000,,207,4.473684210526316

7290618,2,B00ZR3W40E,This a cookie cutter action adventure shoot 'em up rivals/buddy movie that is pretty much uninspired let's collect a paycheck star fodder.  Tedious and plodding its stunt driven but there's nothing new here.  Wahlberg and Washington are talented actors but its not evident in this film.  A cut and paste script designed to showcase stunts.,1389744000,,339,5.127272727272727
7290619,3,B00ZR3W40E,"Enjoyed both the big stars in this movie. The story wa a little predictable but there was enough action, story telling and interpersonal relationships to make it worth watching on a rainy afternoon.",1389657600,,198,5.03030303030303
7290620,5,B00ZR3W40E,I thought that all the twists and turns were great. Kept me hanging on and in my seat until the end.,1389657600,,100,3.8095238095238093
7290621,4,B00ZR3W40E,Mark Wahlberg makes everything better.  And it was really funny. GREAT chemistry between Mark and denzel. Just a fun movie.,1389657600,,123,5.15
7290622,3,B00ZR3W40E,"Standard action/buddy flick. Good actors, fairly implausible plot, all in all keeps you entertained although it's fairly uneven at times.",1389657600,,137,5.9
7290623,5,B00ZR3W40E,"Really great movie, and some twists I didn't expect. My boyfriend and I watch pretty much everything with Denzel in it. There were definitely some funny moments in this movie also.",1389657600,,180,4.838709677419355
7290624,3,B00ZR3W40E,"This was a good movie, worth the watch. It had some funny moments, not as action packed as I would have liked.",1389657600,,110,4.045454545454546
7290625,3,B00ZR3W40E,It was a little hard to follow but a good watch and worth the rental.  Washington and Wahlberg are a good combo.,1389657600,,112,4.090909090909091
7290626,2,B00ZR3W40E,"In all honesty, I am an avid movie buff having been a collector since 1986, and believe me when I say 2 Guns is a total disappointment, sorry Denzel and Wahlberg Fans, better luck next time!!",1389657600,,191,4.333333333333333
7290627,2,B00ZR3W40E,I thought the movie was violent--not funny.  I have to add more words but the first sentence says it all.,1389657600,,105,4.25
7290628,3,B00ZR3W40E,I found it very interesting and entertaining. Denzel Washington's character reminded me of Training Day! Both stars were excellent in their portrayals in my opinion.,1389657600,,165,5.64
7290629,4,B00ZR3W40E,"Lots of action, good acting and compelling twist.  I actually meant to watch this video in the theatre but never made it out.  Glad I had the opportunity to watch it, I definitely recommend but not for young kids (Vulgar language and violence)",1389657600,,243,4.627906976744186
7290630,4,B00ZR3W40E,Had a few good laughs.  Little dark and violent but still funny. Always liked Denzel in comedic roles.  Would recommend.,1389657600,,120,4.95
7290631,4,B00ZR3W40E,I liked the movie quite a bit...  I would love to see them both star in other action films in the future.,1389657600,,105,3.772727272727273
7290632,5,B00ZR3W40E,"The movie was every bit as exciting as I anticipated.  Every actor fit the roles and played them to perfection.  Although I enjoyed it my wife had difficulty with the overall voice quality and I am the one that wears hearing aids.  The sounds of explosions, gun shots, speeding cars, wrecks, etc., came through loud and clear.  However the speaking roles do not come across well.  It is as if the producers want you to guess what the actors are saying.  No we had the volume up high and still were left wondering what they were saying.  In addition where Spanish was spoken and the wording displayed on the screen, it was very difficult to read.  It was to small and the color washed out into the background.

From my point of view, I understood and could follow the play of the movie and I would watch it again in the future.  However, as much as she likes all of the actors, my wife does not want to watch it again.",1389657600,,917,4.309941520467836
7290633,1,B00ZR3W40E,"stupid---dont waste your time seeing it. ive seen both actors in much better movies. dumb plot, hard to follow and not worth your time.",1389657600,,135,4.666666666666667
7290634,2,B00ZR3W40E,"I could be wrong but found it unbelievable that multiple agencies would be working on major drug busts and not communicate. Didn't buy that the Paula character would sell out the Denzel character; writer needed to give more information about her thinking. Also, not believable that the Denzel character would shoot his partner after all they'd gone through. The acting was good.",1389657600,,378,5.112903225806452
7290635,5,B00ZR3W40E,"Great movie. You won't be disappointed to watch it. Denzel and mark make a great combination.
 I highly recommend it",1389657600,,116,4.8
7290636,5,B00ZR3W40E,A lot of action. Keeps your attention. My husband didn't even fall asleep through this movie. I recommend it highly.,1389571200,,116,4.85
7290637,1,B00ZR3W40E,"I knew this was going to be a low budget film, but please!! Not so low you need a fly swatter to pick it up off the ground!!",1389571200,,124,3.4642857142857144
7290638,5,B00ZR3W40E,"Great acting and twist, lots of action. The lead actors are easy on the eyes. Great for men and women.",1389484800,,102,4.15
7290639,4,B00ZR3W40E,Lots of action mixed with good chemistry. Wahlberg and Washington work well together as well together. Their fun approach to the dialogue makes it entertaining to watch as the story builds.,1389484800,,189,5.129032258064516
7290640,4,B00ZR3W40E,Both actors did a good job in this movie. Saw this in the theater and though it did not last long it had good action and good comedy. Bill Paxton was hilarious in this movie as the heal.,1389484800,,186,3.9210526315789473
7290641,4,B00ZR3W40E,Lots of Action. Almost too much gratuitous violence (even for an old infantryman). Love Wahlburg and Washington both in this one.,1389484800,,129,5.190476190476191
7290642,3,B00ZR3W40E,I chose the move because of the major stars and because I like action flicks.  I grade the move as C+.,1389484800,,102,3.857142857142857
7290643,4,B00ZR3W40E,I really thought that it was good. I'm not a big Denzel Washington fan but he was really funny in this movie. Mark Walhberg is always hilarious enough to watch.,1389484800,,160,4.366666666666666
7290644,5,B00ZR3W40E,Husband and I loved this movie. While we're both Washington and Wahlberg fans this movie delivered great entertainment. Laughs and thrills as well. Glad we added it to our movie library.,1389484800,,186,5.032258064516129
7290645,3,B00ZR3W40E,Actually want to give this a 3.5. It is a fun movie that I will watch again at some point.  Clever twists and turns to the plot keep us amused and guessing enough to feel alive.  Some guy humor that gets a couple chuckles.  Better than Stallone's latest silliness.,1389484800,,264,4.346938775510204
7290646,2,B00ZR3W40E,"I did not like it, I thought it would have been better with these two excellent actors, so that is why my rating is low",1389398400,,119,3.8
7290647,3,B00ZR3W40E,I really enjoyed this movie as it has good action and is funny in places. You won't regret seeing it.,1389398400,,101,4.1
7290648,4,B00ZR3W40E,Good movie with some fun dialogue and great action between the characters. Mark Wahlberg has some great lines. I'd watch it again.,1389398400,,130,4.954545454545454
7290649,3,B00ZR3W40E,Fairly good movie; there is nudity that is a bit uncomfortable. This movie is what you would expect; I enjoyed it.,1389398400,,114,4.476190476190476
7290650,5,B00ZR3W40E,"This movie was both suspenseful, funny and had a few twist. Wahlberg was hilarious and Washington was, you know Denzel! The two together were greater than the parts I would love to see W&W again and again.",1389398400,,205,4.5675675675675675
7290651,3,B00ZR3W40E,Very predicable.  Usual stunts and scenes...same old same old action shoot em up.  Scenes seem very staged. Could use acting lessons from John Wayne.  I like Denzel in SF pictures or white color crime movies better.,1389398400,,215,4.916666666666667
7290652,5,B00ZR3W40E,This movie has lots of humor and extreme action.  It is one of the best movies I've seen in a while.,1389398400,,100,3.761904761904762
7290653,5,B00ZR3W40E,"Finally watched this movie.  Really humorous, funny and the storyline was pretty decent, lots of action, has all the elements of an action movie.",1389398400,,145,5.041666666666667
7290654,3,B00ZR3W40E,"i enjoy both of these actors anf usually count on good acting performances,  This movie had lots of action and disguised humor.  Sometimes a little simple faith in some scenes that you accept as simply entertainment.  Not my four star movie but by far not the worst and i would recommend watching.",1389312000,,297,4.673076923076923
7290655,5,B00ZR3W40E,"this is a great movie with denzel and mark. they did a great job interacting along with paula patton. the verbal exchanges were hiliarious and I love the ""make it rain"" scene. someone come up with another great movie script for these two awesome actors.",1389312000,,253,4.644444444444445
7290656,4,B00ZR3W40E,"and just as fun! Very funny at times, a lot cliched, but you know what to expect.  Chill and let your mind relax.",1389312000,,113,3.9130434782608696
7290657,3,B00ZR3W40E,"While I enjoyed the comraderie of Wahlberg and Washinton, I didn't so much enjoy the story. The story vacilated between gory and a little fantastic. All in all, it is watchable.",1389312000,,177,4.741935483870968
7290658,3,B00ZR3W40E,"It should be crisper, more fun, more exciting.  Instead it seem that I saw it before.  Do better guys both actors and directors, screenwriter.",1389312000,,142,4.875
7290659,1,B00ZR3W40E,"Too many bad guys, too over the top, but good acting, but not good enough to save the story. Choppy and predictable.",1389312000,,116,4.318181818181818
7290660,4,B00ZR3W40E,"The two actors together do a really fine job with this film. It is exciting, with a touch of humor and has a good story line",1389312000,,124,3.8076923076923075
7290661,5,B00ZR3W40E,"This movie is an entertaining action movie full of well-crafted insults and shoot-em-up action. If you like Marky Mark movies in general (and who doesn't?), this movie will not disappoint. It's also not as heavy as some action movies (Four Brothers, Shooter, Conspiracy Theory, anything having to do with the government), so you're not left feeling depressed about the corruption and injustice in the world.",1389312000,,407,5.276923076923077
7290662,5,B00ZR3W40E,"Enjoyed the humor, action, and plot Washington and Wahlberg are two of my favorite... the chemistry was right. Two thumbs up!!!",1389312000,,127,5.095238095238095
7290663,3,B00ZR3W40E,"I like both these actors very much, but the story was kinda weak. I think this is what Hollywood calls an ""IRS movie,""  the actors gotta pay their tax bill.",1389225600,,156,4.2
7290664,5,B00ZR3W40E,Awesome movie.  Denzel and Mark did not disappoint. They have an interesting partnership should consider doing additional films in the near future.,1389225600,,147,5.681818181818182
7290665,2,B00ZR3W40E,"The plot of this film was terrible. Far fetched to believe that three different government entities are involved in the same plot for 1 drug dealer's money who's money is getting kept in a bank owned by the CIA. It was as if the writer threw something together and the producer said ""maybe if we get a couple of good actors to do this movie maybe we can make a few bucks"". Keep the money, I want my time back.",1389225600,,409,4.125
7290666,2,B00ZR3W40E,Boring. Over rated I expected more from the great actors. Again the trailers were luring and better than the film,1389225600,,113,4.7
7290667,2,B00ZR3W40E,"This movie follows the typical buddy-buddy action formula, but everything about it is done poorly. It's hard to ell if Mark and Denzel delivered weak performances or if the bad writing and directing just left them no room to show their talents.

In any case, this is one was not worth the $$ I paid amazon to see it.",1389225600,,316,4.3559322033898304
7290668,4,B00ZR3W40E,"It measured up to my expectations and probably exceeded them.
I would recommend this to anyone that like the lead actors.
It's worth the watch.",1389225600,,143,4.76
7290669,5,B00ZR3W40E,The movie was amazing it had a great mix of humor and action which is my kind of movie and I am only hope for a sequel,1389225600,,118,3.4074074074074074
7290670,3,B00ZR3W40E,This was a good movie for guys to watch. It didn't work for me except I LOVE Denzel. My husband thought the shoot-em-up stuff was great.,1389225600,,136,4.269230769230769
7290671,5,B00ZR3W40E,"Great action, with some comedic hints. Denzel and Wahlberg have great chemistry and flow on the screen together. One of the best movies I've seen",1389225600,,145,4.84
7290672,4,B00ZR3W40E,Not only one of 2013`s best action films but one of last years best films overall . Team Denzel and Mark is the best pairing in years .Purest action doesn`t come better than this !!!,1389225600,,182,4.228571428571429
7290673,3,B00ZR3W40E,thought this movie with these 2 great actors would be more interesting . Movie was just okay for me. you need to be your own critique,1389139200,,133,4.153846153846154
7290674,4,B00ZR3W40E,"Lots of action: shooting, driving, etc. etc. A little violent, but liked it. I recommend is to Wahlberg and Washington fans.",1389139200,,124,4.9523809523809526

7290678,4,B00ZR3W40E,Denzel and Mark are a great pair! Funny and entertaining! I just wish it was a bit longer because I love these two actors!,1389139200,,122,4.125
7290679,5,B00ZR3W40E,These two together are so good. Really enjoyed this movie. Has a great twist and the one on one was what really kept me entertained.,1389139200,,132,4.32

7290682,4,B00ZR3W40E,"I guess with a name like 2Guns you have to expect violence and language, but it doesn't mean I have to like it.  I ordered this movie for my husband for Christmas because he asked for it.  He liked it.",1389139200,,201,4.0
7290683,5,B00ZR3W40E,"This is a great, high action movie.  These two actors have become two of my favorites!  The subtle humor was endearing.  The unexpected twist was engaging.  You wanted to keep watching to see what would happen next!",1389139200,,215,4.72972972972973
7290684,3,B00ZR3W40E,Entertaining but with the actors I expected something better.  Wouldn't recommend to family or friends. Spend your time reading a good book.,1389139200,,140,5.363636363636363

The real winner was the chemistry/adversity between Washington and Wahlberg and the constant badgering.

7290736,4,B00ZR3W40E,"2 Guns is a fun action comedy that delivers with both the action and the humour. The two leads are always fun to watch in action and work well together. The story is relatively simple one, an undercover DEA agent (Denzel Washington) and a US Navy Intelligence officer (Mark Wahlberg) have been working together infiltrating a drug cartel, they don't know about each other's true role. Together they steal what they think was the drug gang's money, but turn's out to be someone far more dangerous.

The strength of the film is the two leads, they both look the part of their respective roles, but more importantly fit together, making this a good buddy movie. The plot of the film isn't anything special and acts simply as a vehicle for more set pieces and opportunities for the two leads to spark of each other.

While the story isn't all that, the writing is pretty good, the lines between the two leads all hit the mark and provide a good slice of humour.  The action is well filmed and again both leads are convincing with the action.

All in all it's a very entertaining film to watch, don't expect greatness, but it is a lot of fun.",1388707200,,1137,4.504854368932039

7290739,4,B00ZR3W40E,"This movie was done very cleverly. The dialogue between the main  characters (Washington and Wahlberg) is quick, witty and quickly paced as well as humorous.

I would think the storyline is at least fifty percent pure fantasy with the CIA and Navy both involved in over-the-border drug running in one form or another--then again, who knows, there are some crazy things in the world today.  In any case, the action and the characters make it well worth watching as a rental and maybe buying when it hits the $5 bin because you'll probably want to see it again a couple of years later.",1388620800,,516,4.4787234042553195

The dialogue and interplay between Wahlberg and Washington's characters, the initial potential of the plot. Dislikes? The plot never seems to find a clear path, seemed to try to cover too many directions. Too often they easy way out was chosen by making the cliche' bad guy choices (US government via US Navy, CIA, FBI) while trying to insert semi cloaked political messages (sympathy for illegal immigrants).

Watched it with the family during the holidays and we really enjoyed it.  Now if I could get my soundbar to work correctly, I will ready for a repeat showing.",1388448000,,294,4.12280701754386
7290769,4,B00ZR3W40E,"There's no denying that Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg are two of the top action stars in film these days even though there is a considerable age difference between the two. So when the word came out that they would be involved in a buddy cop movie I was ready for it to be dynamite. Fortunately 2 GUNS turned out to be just that.

The two begin the film as a pair of crooks involved with diabolical Papa Greco (Edward James Olmos), a Mexican drug lord that Robert ""Bobby"" Trench (Washington) has bought passports for. Unfortunately the drugs that he was supposed to be paid with are being held back by Greco who would rather pay with cash. Instead, Trench tells him to hold on to the cash until he's ready to give him the drugs.

Michael ""Stig"" Stigman is another character altogether. Where Trench is a cool cat, Stigman is the hot youngster ready to go at it at the drop of a hat. Stigman, unhappy with the day's events, suggests to Trench that they do something different to get more money from Greco: rob a bank where he deposits cash every week. Their guess is the take will be about $3 million.

After the two head back to the U.S. the find themselves picked up by Immigration and are held for questioning. Here is where we learn that Trench isn't the crook we thought but an undercover DEA agent. He informs his controllers that the deal didn't go through but he's on the verge which results in him being given just 2 weeks to finish the case. With so little time he suggests to his main controller Deb (Paula Patton), who he also happens to be sleeping with, that he and Stigman actually pull off the bank job to get the ball rolling.

The duo follows through on their plan with one a few hitches along the way. First off they discover that there is more than just $3 million, more like $43 million. Secondly the arresting DEA officers that were supposed to show never arrive. And lastly when the time comes for Trench to reveal himself to Stigman, Stigman shoots him and leaves him in the dessert with a bottle of water.

Stigman reports to a group of friends and we now learn that he is working for Naval Intelligence to get to the money that was in the bank. When he discusses the fact that it was more than expected and that he left Trench alive, his cohorts open fire on him and try to take him out. He escapes but barely.

The duo reunites and puts together what information they have after kidnapping Greco to find out how much he knows. While interrogating him at Deb's house, the military guys show and the twists and turns of just who is working for who and which organization is doing the backstabbing begins to reveal itself.

The movie is filled with action from start to finish. Not only that but there is a comedic quotient on display here that harkens back to the LETHAL WEAPON films of the past. While Washington may be the cool character with some decent funny lines it is Wahlberg's character that has the more funnier moments. Between his wink, his attitude and his snappy come backs, he brings the humor to the film. As for the rest of the cast they do a remarkable job of playing out their roles and not hamming it up. Seeing as how this movie is based on a graphic novel the fact they can do so shows how well they do.

With plenty of explosions and gunplay, after all the movie IS named 2 GUNS, the action quotient is one that should fulfill the needs of all adventure fans. The stars show an ability to tussle with one another and the bad guys as well as offer some gunfire play that will make you wish that these two were on your team if the need ever arose. Is it one for the shelf? Maybe. Not mine but then some of you may be die hard fans of both actors. If so you'll want this one added to your collection. .",1388448000,,3752,4.3196022727272725

7290772,4,B00ZR3W40E,"With any other pair of actors, 2 Guns would have been unbearably corny. Yet, Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg actually manage to pull it off. It's good to see both actors taking on less serious roles without devolving to Samuel-L-Jackson-in-Snakes-on-a-Plane level.

The plot is stupid, the action gets over-the-top, the supporting cast is ridiculously bad, and almost everything is comically done. Yet, it manages to be just barely serious enough to be called an action flick. The dialogue is simultaneously childish, witty, clever, and smart. The acting is simultaneously good and horrible. The action is simultaneously roll-your-eyes weird and I-guess-that's-rather-cool entertaining.

7290787,4,B00ZR3W40E,"Born in 1966 in Iceland, Baltasar Korm&aacute;kur graduated from The Drama Academy of Iceland and is one of Iceland's most popular and critically acclaimed actors of the younger generation. He is also a director and a producer and seems to be one of the more exciting new talents of the day. He directed this work by Stephen Grant based on the Boom! Studios graphic novel adapted for the screen by Blake Masters. It is a crazy mixed up story of mistaken identities, hidden identities and corruption in every branch of the crime prevention division of the government. It works primarily of the unexpectedly fine screen chemistry between Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg.

Robert Trench (Denzel Washington) is an undercover DEA agent who takes advantage of gunman Michael Stigman's (Mark Wahlberg) idea to rob a bank to bust him and a mob boss (Edward James Olmos). However, it proves too successful with much more money seized than predicted and with Trench's forces failing to halt the getaway. Complicating things still more, Stigman turns out to be a Naval Intelligence agent who shoots Trench and takes the money. The interservice debacle suddenly finds Trench and Stigman in a bloody web of corrupt clandestine rivalries as they are hunted, blackmailed and isolated for the money on both sides of the law. Now, the fugitives must work together to find a way out of this situation with no one to turn to but themselves. The well-healed cast of characters (at times difficult to tell who is on what team) includes Bill Paxton, James Marsden, Fred Ward, Robert John Burke, Greg Sproles, and Paula Patton.

It is noisy action all the way but the script is peppered with enough solid humor and exceptional banter between Washington and Wahlberg that it keeps our attention to the very odd ending. Grady Harp, December 13",1388275200,2,1822,4.931596091205212

Denzels' ability to play a role with intense seriousness and at the same time exude extremely intelligent underlying humor in a character, and Marks' ability to toss out hilarious quips and innuendo from a character that has a ""Devil may care"" attitude because of his over inflated ego blend together to make this a truly great movie. Action packed with enough humor intertwined to be enjoyable to the man and woman of the house, actually for most of the family (violence and occasional adult themes may be a little too much for children).",1387756800,,595,4.900990099009901

7290866,4,B00ZR3W40E,"This is a high action movie that is continuous fast action. The plot is basically that the CIA is ripping off the Mexican Drug Cartel, who is getting ripped off by the DEA who is getting ripped off by the Navy Intel department.  The plot is so convoluted that at times it is impossible to try to follow who is on what side.

Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg make the film entertaining.  It is a fun movie to watch if you unplug your common sense for 2 hours while you watch it.  The gunfights are just over the top silly.  Two guys with semiautomatic pistols taking on 2 dozen guys armed with guns, rifles, military machine guns, a helicopter with a high speed machine gun, and shotguns and the two heroes don't even get scratched.  Come-on-man!  Those two pistols must have also had those magic 40 round clips in them that look like normal sized clips.

Watch the film for the entertainment but I don't know if the DVD has any replay value.  You might be better off just renting the film and watching it once.",1387584000,,1013,4.403225806451613

7290871,3,B00ZR3W40E,Ah....liked the idea of these 2 actors in same movie and the banter between the 2 is enjoyable BUT the plot is way to complicated and the movie seems to drag and feels too long. Why are scenes even included that seem to imply one of the stars is going to get killed when you know it isn't going to happen??? Watch again just for action? Nope. A date movie? Nope.

7290885,3,B00ZR3W40E,"Two guns is a movie about an undercover DEA agent  (Washington) and an undercover naval intelligence officer (Walhberg) who find themselves on the run after a botched attempt to infiltrate a drug cartel. While fleeing, they learn the secret of their shakey alliance that neither knew that the other was an undercover agent.

Considering the star power here, this is a very well acted movie, with Washington and Walhberg both playing their roles well and having very good chemistry both action and comedy wise during the movie.  Even the supporting cast do very well at playing their roles well, especially with Paxton and Olmos playing the cliche type villians very well.

The movie is action packed and entertaining and that is not where the issue is with this movie as there is lots of shooting, blowing things up and characters dying.  Like most action movies, you have to suspend your belief to enjoy this and this one is no different.  The problem is that the plot is a bit far fetched and goes too many directions at once.  DEA, FBI, CIA, Cartels, Navy Intel(which in case of the Navy, for the life of me, I can't figure out why they are involved in this plot).  The plot has way too many things going on at the same time and tends to get things confused and muddled where a better story could have been developed and still been as much fun.  Yes maybe over the top action and plot is the point of this movie and it does that well and does keep you entertained but this movie could have been better with a few tweaks to the plot.

A fun fast paced entertaining thrill ride that most action fans and fans of Washington and Walhberg will enjoy.  I liked it but think it could have been better with some different story choices.",1387411200,6,1731,4.516025641025641

Yes, but it's still a fun watch if you enjoy this type of movie.  I am not a fan of Paula Patton however and nothing about this movie or her performance changed my mind.  When Mark Wahlberg's character teases her that she's got a ""daddy issue"" for being involved with Denzel's character, I cheered a little.  At least someone acknowledged the significant age difference.

7290919,4,B00ZR3W40E,"Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlburg work well together here in something of a far-fetched heist/action movie.  Unlike a lot of heist movies, people do get killed in this one and it is violent.  The plot twists are a little silly but there is a plot.  Overall, the story moves along and is exciting and fun to watch.  Has Denzel Washington ever made a bad movie?  Four stars for what it is though, a heist/action movie.",1386979200,,418,4.52

7290922,4,B00ZR3W40E,NOT A BAD MOVIE BUT. MR. WASHINGTON COULD OF DONE BETTER. I LIKED IT BUT. THE MOVIE WAS ALITTLE WEIRD. DIDN'T REALLY HAVE A GOOD ENDING.,1386892800,,136,4.269230769230769
7290923,4,B00ZR3W40E,"This movie was surprisingly fun to watch, despite how lame I thought it would be after seeing the trailer.  I thought this would literally be another white guy/black dude pairing that just needs to go away altogether.  What I found was an action movie with some comedy in between that overall made for an enjoyable experience.  I didn't see this movie in the theater, I saw it on dvd, so I think I went in with some relaxed expectations.

The plot is not fairly complicated, its about two agents, posed as criminals, trying to out fox the other, the whole while trying to escape Edward James Olmos and his gang of thieves who are after the loot from a bank heist Washington and Walberg pull off earlier in the movie.  The movie overall is like a cat and mouse, one character chasing another, with some basic dialogue in between.

Somehow, the movie is entertaining and the characters run around, are chased, jump in and out of vehicles, crash trucks and do all sorts of things that are found in grand theft auto.  Maybe thats why I liked it, the movie was just trying to be fun action, instead of showing overblown, over the top action characters such as the Jason Bournes.

Again, a fun movie and worth a watching.",1386806400,,1215,4.5159817351598175

7290939,5,B00ZR3W40E,great movie. But then again any movie with Denzel Washington is normally pretty good.  worth watching. Also mark is pretty good in the movie too... wish it was a bit longer but oh well,1386633600,,184,4.411764705882353

7290954,4,B00ZR3W40E,"Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg are great actors to begin with, put these two together and you have a very well done movie that is like watching two of your closest relatives who like different football teams go at it.  Denzel always blends himself well into any part he plays making you leave reality and live in his world, Mark brings a similar quality and they throw humor into the mix making it a very enjoyable movie.  You probably will see these two together again as you can tell they enjoyed working with each other.",1386460800,,528,4.5473684210526315

7290956,2,B00ZR3W40E,Not believable.  Part about Navy Seals being thieves and drug money extortionist is somewhat distasteful and unbelievably uninteresting.  Light laughs eased the pain of the rental fee.,1386374400,,184,5.777777777777778
7290957,4,B00ZR3W40E,"This move had its off moments, and could have used a little editing and a little better acting, (not on Walberg or Washington's part) but despite that it was still a lot of fun to watch and a film that I thoroughly enjoyed.  I would easily watch it again.  Walberg and Washington's chemistry really make this film work and worth watching.  Both brought their A-Game and I hope to see them work together in the future.",1386374400,,417,4.4605263157894735

7290962,2,B00ZR3W40E,"I was mostly stoic throughout this movie, quietly laughed a couple times, shook my head a ton more. First off the plot was outrageous, which has been done in action comedy's with quite a bit of success, it just did not work here. Will Patton's CIA character was horrible, looks like he got some use out of his Tombstone wardrobe, glad it could still fit him. The whole CIA thing was just silly really and could have been done so much better. Most of the plot could have been done better, it just felt thrown together and rushed without much thought into it at all. The movie was fun in the beginning when you just thought they were bad guys, they actually had some chemistry....then it all got mixed up into this weird casserole with a bunch of ingredients that just don't go together well.

On another note I hate it when movies use incorrect terms. There is no such thing as a DEA ""officer"", they are agents. It is not an A-6 Apache helicopter, it's an AH-64. Navy Intel? lol. Seriously? Those guy all had SEAL tridents on, they are not intel they are Navy Special Forces aka SEALS. How hard is that? How do you work with a real Naval base, get accurate uniforms, etc....but no advice on the important stuff?

To sum it up, it just didn't work. It was all over the place and never really made me laugh out loud. Severe identity crisis, not even a fun movie. I don't need Oscar level entertainment, just entertainment. I was not entertained.",1386288000,,1442,4.437735849056604

7290966,3,B00ZR3W40E,"Meh... Big fan of Denzel and never had a problem with Mark W, but this cashing in on their name-power for a quick buck.

7290982,5,B00ZR3W40E,"I think this action movie had a deeper substance and plot to it than most.  Sure it has all of the good explosions and shoot out scenes, coupled with funny dialogue and wit, but it also spoke to a deep seated problem in this country.  There were numerous instances in the movie (and I won't speak it them I'm not a spoiler) where the little guy is trampled for the greater good of a corporation or government agency.  The frustration that brings to mind is very reminiscent of the bail outs and Edward Snowden.  I think there is a more subtle message in this one about these issues that speaks to our times of corporate lawlessness and the expendability of workers without rubbing this fact in your face.  For me a recent graduate with an advanced graduate degree who was made to take the blame for my bosses mistakes and fired it was EXTREMELY satisfying!",1386115200,,856,4.496774193548387

Bad for turn volume up for inept-whispered-too fast dialog followed by rush to turn down explosions-gunfire etc.  What a waste of talented actors.

Some that fits with the movie that is romantic or funny not crude. This was perfect. But we like Denzel and mark and would watch these two in any movie. It did get a little slow.  But that's ok.

If you don't expect too much, like a fantastic plot, high acting, etc and just sit back to watch the movie, you will enjoy it. There's a good chemistry between the two stars, which made me give the film the four stars. I liked it.",1385856000,,485,4.11578947368421

7291034,5,B00ZR3W40E,Denzel and Mark are at their best.  They both are working undercover but for different agencies only they don't know that until well into the movie.  Denzel is trying to bring down a drug lord and Mark is working undercover for the military who want the money.  They rob a bank thinking the money there belongs to the drug lord ....but it isn't and that is when things get dicey.  Plenty of action and surprises.  The humor and barbs between Denzel and Mark made me laugh.  A must see,1385510400,,484,4.382022471910112

But then you just start getting annoyed at how lame it is and how much of a sucker you were for buying it.  The action scenes were so overdone and unbelievable, we lost track of the ""yeah right"" moments.  Paula Patton was in the movie for one thing only and it wasn't her acting skills because they were nonexistent and not what was on display. It really was like they had a check list of all the b-level action movie clich&eacute;s and checked them all off.  Unbelievable action scenes, check.  Hokey dialogue, check.  Disposable bimbo sex scenes, check. Predictable ending, check (The person I was watching this with nailed it telling me how it was going to end and I rolled my eyes thinking how dumb it would be if it did go that way, but it did and he was right)  Both of us felt it was a giant waste of time.",1385251200,9,896,4.204678362573099

7291056,4,B00ZR3W40E,"As promised, my reviews for The Hunger Games, and The Hunger Games Catching Fire are vastly approaching. For the past few days, I have been watching movies that I missed over the past few months. Just today I viewed 2 Guns for the first time. Let's take a look

2 Guns starts out almost suspiciously, with superstars Denzel Washington (Bobby) and Mark Wahlberg (Stigman). Early on it is pretty obvious this is one of those ""he may not be who he says he is"" kind of movies.  Among one of the many positive things I can point out about 2 Guns; the chemistry between these two makes this movie tremendously enjoyable. Mark's character Stigman is hilarious, and you know if Denzel Washington is in a movie (any movie for that matter) you know exactly what you are getting.

To get into the story line without giving too much away, it is heavily based around these two characters Bobby and Stigman, Bobby is an undercover agent who decides to assist Stigman in stealing what they both believe to be $3 Million. However, once the job is done they find more money than either guy could have bargained for. Following the robbery, a lot more guns, and a lot more people become involved. 2 Guns is not exactly a short movie, but it shows to be a movie that is easily likable thanks to the humor, the well rounded performances, and the all around fun tone the movie has. Definitely a movie I enjoyed. 2 Guns gets a score of:

8/10

Starring: Paula Patton, James Marsden, Bill Paxton,",1385078400,,1472,4.518796992481203
7291057,4,B00ZR3W40E,"Double crosses. Triple crosses. An extra helping of crosses on top of increasingly tangled numerical crosses. 2 Guns is a buddy cop genre pic in the guise of a punchy pulp comic book actioner, one that attempts to toy with convention, actively subvert every action-movie clich in the book, and crack a few familiar, wise-crackin' skulls in the process. Trouble is director Baltasar Kormkur and screenwriter Blake Masters' adaptation of Steven Grant's original graphic novel isn't nearly as clever as it thinks it is, and never quite manages to lift Grant's colorful characters off the page. That little consolation prize instead comes courtesy of Denzel Washington, Mark Wahlberg and the duo's scene-chewing supporting cast, who at least make 2 Guns watchable. Entertaining even... if that is you're willing to switch off your brain and take the movie on its own flash-bang terms.
Meet Bobby (Denzel Washington) and Stig (Mark Wahlberg): criminals for hire, except that they're not really criminals. Bobby is an undercover DEA agent, Stig is an undercover NCIS officer. There's just one problem... each one thinks the other is exactly what he claims to be. Soon the two join forces to steal $3 million from Mexican drug lord Papi Greco (Edward James Olmos) for their respective agencies, only to discover the take is actually $43 million. The stakes are suddenly that much higher. Thirteen back-stabs and betrayals later, Bobby and Stig struggle to gain their bearings, and neither one knows who to trust. With so much cash up for grabs, the duo find themselves in the crosshairs. But who does the money belong to? And who can Bobby and Stig trust? Greco? Navy Admiral Tuway (Fred Ward)? Bobby's lover Deb Rees (Paula Patton)? Stig's commander Quince (James Marsden)? Bloodthirsty power player Earl (Bill Paxton)? Kormkur? Masters?

I couldn't help but think of Sylvain White's The Losers while sitting through 2 Guns, followed almost immediately by two-dozen other high-action shoot-em-ups; every single one of them backed by big-blockbuster casts that are far and away their films' greatest assets. Kormkur and Masters take loving shot after loving shot at the genre to scattershot ends, dropping one-liners and shell casings as if both were going out of style. 2 Guns doesn't rise above the action-movie fray so much as it takes a turn in an already crowded firing range. It's a wild free-for-all that doesn't try to hide the Big Dumb Fun coursing beneath its surface, with Olmos, Marsden and especially Paxton having the times of their lives. But it's also a shaky, unreliable, unnecessarily convoluted misfire that would tip over if Washington and Wahlberg weren't so busy steadying it. Even when next to nothing makes sense, even when gaping plot holes threaten to swallow up what little plausibility Kormkur tries to establish, even when their performances amount to one over-the-top round of mugging after the other, both A-listers deliver.

And it's a tricky balance. Get a kick out of headliners like Washington and Wahlberg dabbling in the dark side? Willing to look the other way when plot twists are obvious and plot progression is needlessly complicated? Value comic book gunplay, colorful criminals and angsty antiheroes above... well, anything more compelling? 2 Guns is for you. There's just plenty more like it out there, and plenty more on the horizon. Escapism isn't exactly a new pastime. We've been dumping billions into the hard-R action grinder for decades. Films like 2 Guns, though, are caught between genre classicism and more contemporary, self-aware thrills, paying homage to the guilty pleasures of the '90s while taking a stab at something newer and more clever. Once in a great while, a film comes along that strikes that balance and enters the new action format. 2 Guns is not that film, fun as it is if you're able to set aside expectations, switch off your brain, and be entertained by good actors knowingly sinking their teeth into a fatty, gristly script.

2 Guns takes aim with a killer 1080p/AVC-encoded video presentation that rarely, if ever, disappoints. Colors are warm and carefully saturated, black levels are exceedingly deep (with only intermittent instances of crush), and skintones look great. Detail is excellent, with crisply defined edges, well-resolved textures and exacting close-ups. Universal's DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround track kicks down door after door, guns blazing. Shootouts, explosions, throaty dune buggies, roaring engines and thundering helicopter attacks feature ample low-end heft, and the LFE channel makes its presence known. And with bullets ricocheting, shrapnel flying and debris scattering, the sound field is immersive and involving.

2 Guns fires wide and runs out of ammo long before its double and triple crosses are exhausted, making for an R-rated popcorn shoot-em-up that's big on action and little else. Washington, Wahlberg, Olmos, Paxton and Marsden keep it all entertaining, but only just. Universal's Blu-ray release is much better, with a terrific video presentation, hard-hitting DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround track, and a solid complement of special features sure to satisfy fans of the film. Even so, it's only a matter of time before 2 Guns lands in the bargain bin.",1385078400,2,5265,5.205188679245283

7291067,2,B00ZR3W40E,"Wasn't the buddy film I'd hoped for.  I didn't see the expected chemistry between Denzel and Mark Wahlberg.  Just didn't seem to click.  More than a comfortable amount of nudity once again in one of Denzel's films.  He had this in Flight and now here.  Not necessary and as evidence of that: the nudity will be cut for TV viewing, and still carry the plot.  It's just included in the film for the voyeir factor.
The plot was okay.  It kept my interest.  In my opinion, it's not a good action buddy film on the level of the Lethal Weapon series, certainly not a film to take any young people to (for the nudity -- the violence is pretty mainstream).  Probably would have gotten three stars from me without all the skin.",1384819200,,718,4.378787878787879

7291078,1,B00ZR3W40E,"2 Guns is so bad it's absolutely hilarious! It was so dopey it's still making me laugh as I write this review! But the friend I was watching it with was frowning hard. So I said, ""just think of 2 Guns as if you were watching a dream!"" The story is so outrageous and dumb!  Every single character was as  shallow as cardboard and totally ridiculous - you had to wonder if the story was written by a 12-year old! (The thought actually did cross my mind during the movie!) Nor did the story make any sense even within the weird world it created. But it was funny as a bad movie gets!

The only reason I give it one-star is because if you don't have a warped sense of humor like I do, I guarantee you're gonna hate this movie!  LOL!",1384300800,5,728,4.105633802816901
7291079,2,B00ZR3W40E,"It's 60 percent comedy and 40 percent action movie.

The action scenes are so unbelievable that they become unbearable. For example, the scene at the beginning when Mark Wahlberg burnt down the small restaurant and he and Denzel Washington got away with it.

The comedy gives me a headache. For instance, Mark and Denzel constantly argue back and forth in the restaurant or in public places.

In short, I don't enjoy it.

It is better to borrow it from the library than renting it.",1384300800,7,481,4.690476190476191

7291085,5,B00ZR3W40E,"This was an action packed movie filled with a ton of twists and turns that will keep you guessing from beginning to end. You question who is the good guy and who is not and you don't know until the end who is doing what. The writers did a great job at developing the characters that Wahlberg and Washington embody. There is some great dialogue between the two that show how well they work together as characters and as actors. The movie was a ton of fun and will keep you on the edge of your seat. I have to say that I really enjoyed it and so will you!

7291086,2,B00ZR3W40E,"This movie does not deliver on the implied promise from the great cast.
If you want to see a better Mark Whalberg movie, then rent or buy ""Pain and Gain"".",1383868800,3,154,4.166666666666667
7291087,4,B00ZR3W40E,A good story wrapped in a lot of good acting. Nothing really to dislike. Denzel and Mark should consider doing more movies together. They have that chemistry like Redford and Newman had in Butch cassidy and the Sting.,1383868800,,217,4.7368421052631575
7291088,3,B00ZR3W40E,"""Bobby"" (Denzel Washington) and ""Stig"" (Mark Wahlberg) are nice-looking and agreeable, and they look like long-standing friends. They are in fact partners in crime, and are about to rob a bank. But they end up with, well, getting much more money they had estimated. This means big trouble, as the money they get belongs to someone powerful, but Bobby and Stig have no one to trust.

Of course, in this action flick they are not what they seem. Based on a graphic novel of the same title, ""2 Guns"" unfolds like an Elmore Leonard novel, with characters breaking laws while sticking to their code of honor. The difference is that in ""2 Guns"" those characters are less memorable, and dialogue less witty.

What you see in ""2 Guns"" you have seen elsewhere, except the brilliant interplay between the leading players Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg. Helmed by Icelandic director Baltasar Kormakur (who also directed ""Contraband"" starring Wahlberg), ""2 Guns"" is always interesting when the two stars share the screen.

Unfortunately, in about half of the film they appear separately. Supporting characters by James Marsden, Paula Patton, Bill Paxton and Edward James Olmos are all disappointingly one-dimensional. After all, told with a slick and fast-paced narrative, ""2 Guns"" is an entertaining but forgettable action movie.",1383696000,,1323,5.172897196261682
7291089,5,B00ZR3W40E,"The chemistry between denzel and mark w. Is fantastic. Hilarious banter, lots of action, loved everyminute of it. I'll watch it again",1383696000,,133,5.090909090909091
7291090,4,B00ZR3W40E,"A crime thriller with enough crazed cops to fill a psych ward and enough flying lead to block out the sun.

Washington and Wahlberg (the 2W's) are both undercover feds, Bobby and Stig, that don't know the other is undercover, which gives this shootem up a distinctive spy vibe as the two, seemingly buds when the flick starts, try to entrap the other.

Onscreen, the 2W's work amazingly well together, great back-and-forth, solid chemistry, with a good spin on the buddy cop movie.

Great supporting cast too. Edward James Olmos and Bill Paxton play wild over-the-top parts that are a must see.

If you like either/both of the 2W's, or if you are in the mood for a solid shootem up, definitely check this out.

Enjoy!",1383177600,,717,4.658730158730159
7291091,5,B00ZR3W40E,"Based on the graphic novel, 2 Guns, the film follows criminals Bobby Trench and Michael Stigman, who plan to rob Papi Greco, a Mexican drug lord. But after an unexpected overflow of cash during their heist that leaves them with $43 million, they both discover that they're both undercover. Stigman is Special Forces, and Trench is DEA. What they don't know, is the $43 million belongs to the CIA, and soon things spiral out of control, leaving the duo with nothing to do but fight back.

2Guns is directed by Baltasar Kormakur, who previously directed Mark in the crime-thriller, Contraband. Here, 2Guns is filled to the brim with non-stop action, laughs, and a great story about friendship, with some bloody details thrown in. The writing is fantastic; nothing Oscar-winning, but still greatly memorable. The acting is even better, with this being Marky Mark's best film by far. Denzel Washington is great as Trench, and his role here does rank along his best (Alonzo from Training Day, Tobin Frost from Safe House, and Whip Whitaker from Flight). The cinematography is surprisingly fantastic, with a few great shots in New Mexico during a sequence where Bobby and Stigman have to cross from Mexico into the US. Honestly, the only movie I can think of that is as funny as 2Guns, is Edgar Wright's The World's End, which was also released this year.

2Guns is a must-see and own for action fans, comedy lovers or anyone who likes the two lead actors because this movie, while not a massively epic blockbuster, really shows us why we love seeing movies on the big screen. The action never stops, and the laughs keep coming.
