7926011,5,B00004XOR2,"The finale to Cowboy Bebop couldn't get any better. Though it ends in a sad, sad beat, director Watanabe Shinichiro faces us with the hard truth-all things must come to an end. Characters are coming to terms with their dreaded past, especially Spike, and openly confront the beautiful blue sky. It all ends with a bang.",1009584000,,319,4.714285714285714
7926012,5,B00004XOR2,"Volume 13 of Cowboy bebop is as my title says the best.
I was swept away after seeing it for the first time. It's one of those episodes that make you think. Especially the last one. All the action and violence you crave in an episode. After I saw it for the first time, I thought, ""watch it again!"" Unfortunately, I don't have it. It ain't easy to find out there, especially during Christmastime. But, this video, without a doubt, is one to see.",1007856000,,445,4.309523809523809
7926013,5,B00004XOR2,"Spike confronts his past with very mixed results. The final episode of Cowboy Beebop is full of action, pathos and is a fitting end to this incredible series. The animation is of a very high quality and the music is simply great.
I recommend not just this episode, but the whole darn series. Great stuff.",984787200,,304,4.545454545454546
