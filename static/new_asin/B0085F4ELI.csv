5133216,1,B0085F4ELI,"When a movie relies on a single set as the backdrop--the story, the characters and most importantly the words better be pretty darn good! None of that is true in this dog of a movie. It is tired, predictable and there is no reason to care about any of these people. Do not waste your money or your time to rent it. Pew!!!!!!",1371600000,3,324,4.158730158730159
5133217,5,B0085F4ELI,"What a refreshing romantic comedy this is!  I especially loved the ""seasons"" in the elevator scenes and the city scenes.  The actors are people that I feel like I know personally and the story is truly heart-warming!",1346112000,,216,4.8108108108108105

8525584,2,B0085F4ELI,"Some fun bits but it was ruined, as so many videos are, by the incessant STUPID 'music' noise.",1528675200,,94,4.277777777777778
8525585,4,B0085F4ELI,"A wonderful slice of urban life and the year that evolves around a young actor hoping to break into the business but having to toil away as a  boutique hotel host to make ends meet. His ""clients come and go through the span of a year, but one young woman catches his eye and stays on his radar. This is not a BIG movie. It is a very well-crated indie film which exposes some real talent both on camera and off.
Would be a good Sunday afternoon rom-com to watch and savor. Enjoy",1406419200,,477,4.129032258064516
8525586,3,B0085F4ELI,Who knew you could make a movie filmed almost entirely inside an elevator.  Movie kept my interest because the story unfolded in an unconventional manner.,1399593600,,154,5.16
8525587,3,B0085F4ELI,I would have liked to have seen more than just the elevator all the time. It was a cheap movie and it showed. The movie over all was good.,1379289600,,138,3.793103448275862
8525588,3,B0085F4ELI,Got tired going up and down but it was entertaining. Some of the characters were not well developed and some should have gone directly to the cutting room floor but overall it was okay.,1375056000,,185,4.470588235294118
8525589,1,B0085F4ELI,if your bored to death . you can waste your time and money here. . this movie  should of sold for 1.99 or  1.00 rent. I seen a 5 star rating . and I agreed  to spend 14.99 . what  a waste . out of 112 movies I purchase . if I could get one refund . this would be it. . opening and closing an elevator  is  just  not worth 14.99 . very upsetting.,1372636800,,345,3.52
