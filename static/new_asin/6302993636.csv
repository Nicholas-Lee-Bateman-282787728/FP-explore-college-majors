531374,5,6302993636,This is a great story and it is also the story that introduces Davros as  the creator of the Daleks. I always get a kick out of Davros because he  looks like a child running around in a walker only not nearly as cute.  Harry Sullivan and Sarah Jane Smith are the Doctors companions in these  stories. You will enjoy!  END,904089600,,321,4.19672131147541
531448,4,6302993636,"Two for the price of one so to speak.  A pairing of the shortest and one of the finest episodes of the entire run of Dr. Who.
As fans know the Sontarian Experement was shortened due to an injury to Tom Baker, this of course led to some changes in editing.  It seems at times to be an uneven story but Baker pulls it off.  It makes a fine lead in to the introduction of the BEST villian since the Master.
Davros is the perfect villian.  He, as the creator of the Daleks brings a measure of controled evil to the entire concept of the greatest foe of Dr. Who.
There are those who might say that the introduction of the character cheepens the Daleks.  I disagree, Davros is such a compelling character and he is played so well in this episode that he becomes the foil that Tom Baker has been waiting for.  It is a shame we will see him only one more time in his seven years, but it will again be a special moment in the series.
The episode itself is acted well and the moral decision placed upon the doctor adds to it.  A fine supporting cast makes it shine aided by one of the best scripts turned out for the series.
Clearly the best of the first year of Baker.  In the top three of  the best ""Sarah"" episodes.  Buy it.",1013126400,,1217,4.09704641350211
531449,5,6302993636,"Being an American fan of this long-running, tongue-in-cheek, notoriously low-budgeted British TV series is akin to being a member of the French underground. You take pride in it, but at the same time you ain't exactly running around yelling about your membership. Unlike with other films and TV shows I like, I've never tried to convert anyone to this particular faith and don't even talk about watching it to my best friends. The concept -- a hero who is not Hollywood handsome and who thinks, rather than shoots, his way out of trouble -- is so foreign to most Yanks (who are also snobs about special effects) that upon seeing episodes of this show, they often gag or burst out laughing. Where's the Han Solo swagger? Where's James T. Kirk's harem of space babes? Where are the  dogfights, lightsaber duels, and Scottish engineers yelling about how the engines canna take it, captain? And who budgeted this goddamn thing, Scooge? Well, it's true you won't find any of that (admittedly cool) stuff in ""Doctor Who"" but what the series seems to lack in those departments it makes up for with its chemistry, imagination, and energy. Though the show has had more than half a dozen actors playing the Doctor, I grew up on Tom Baker and this episode is, if not the best outing of his seven year run as the lead, then certainly among the top two or three. For a ""Who"" episode it has very respectable scope and effects (all things being relative) and an extremely imaginative storyline, in which the Doctor goes back in time (what else?) to avert the creation of his worst enemy, the Daleks, but then has to grapple with the morality of genocide, even on such unregenerate villains as they. Strong performances all around, but the most props go to the actor, whose name unfortunately escapes me, who played Davros, the blind, wheelchair-bound genius who creates the Daleks and is equal parts Joesef Mengele and Adolf Hitler. Thirty seconds of hearing him rant and rave in his awful I'm-speaking-into-a-fan-belt voice charming missives like: ""A little surgery on the brain will remove these stupid emotions and still allow us to make use of his effective skills"" will put him swiftly on your all-time worst villains list. ""Genesis of the Daleks"" is twenty-five years old or more, but classy, morality-probing stuff like this never gets tired. A must-have for fans. Even fans who don't admit they are fans.",1010707200,,2397,4.817961165048544
531450,5,6302993636,"This set might be the very best Dr Who adventure of all, certainly the most significant of the Tom Baker/Liz Sladen period. Significant in terms of how the story deals with very grown up ideas [war, genocide, race hatred and the Doctor's moral responsibility to the future] in a way that even a 13 year old can make sense of. Characters are richly drawn and believable, even when they only appear for a scene or two and then are killed off. This was also the episode that introduced me and my American pals to the Daleks when Dr. Who was exported to American Public Television in the late 1970's, and I can still remember waking up from Dalek nightmares in a panic; none of the Doctor's other adversaries produced such a reaction from me. They are like R2D2's sadistic, amoral bretheren and amongst the best villains ever concieved of. Going back and watching the story as an adult I am struck by how grim this sequence of episodes actually is -- we get everything from trench warefare [including attack by poison gas shells] to Daleks gunning down the Kaled Elite en masse and even a weapon of mass destruction that wipes out an entire race. Nice. Add to all the carnage the story of the Doctor trying to stem the Dalek menace before it even starts and then having to come to grips with the moral consequences of how his actions will effect the future and we have Sci Fi worthy of Kubrick or Lucas. The special effects shots look kind of phony at times, but the unremittingly bleak picture painted by the story tones their effect down. Even the traditional Dr Who camp has a droll, fatalistic air to it. Coupled with the 2 parter ""Sontaran Experiment"" quickie this is a must-have for any serious Dr. Who afficianado and a great starter for a collection. Higly recommended.",1007164800,2,1773,4.578616352201258
531451,3,6302993636,"Well, I'm not necessarily a fan of the Daleks unless the overall production makes them either truly frightening or campily funny. ""Genesis"" tries to do the former and fails miserably...at least for the tastes of someone my age. Children might be impressed, though. The Daleks are slow and stupid and none of the actors do a really good job except for Baker and the ones who play Nyder and Davros. The plot is well-paced, though, even for six episodes.
I think the real treat here is ""Sontaran Experiment"", a grim run through the heath that used to be London and is now a wilderness with not even an animal alive and a sinister alien skulking among the rocks and abducting hapless castaways. Very eerie and well-acted by all, but only two episodes long, so it can't raise the rating.
Overall, not bad and not great.",1006300800,2,814,4.620689655172414
531452,5,6302993636,"The Doctor Who two-pack, The Sontaran Experiment and The Genesis of The Daleks is a great buy. Peter Miles is chillingly realistic as Davros' Nazi-esque aide Security Commander Nyder, and Michael Wisher does a wonderful Davros, totaly amoral and perfectly willing to destroy his own race to further his mad experiment. The final scene when Davros confronts his rebellious creations is an excellent and memorable scene, as he finally realizes he built them too well.
The Sontaran Experiment was also a good, if short, show. I highly recommend this video for Doctor Who fans.",1004140800,,573,5.1063829787234045
531453,5,6302993636,"I don't really have a favorite Doctor.  They all had their ups and downs.  That said, ""The Genisis of the Daleks"" may well be the best story of the group.  Davros is cruel but almost acceptable in his own mad way.  Tom Baker's questioning of his chance to destroy the Daleks and why he might not want to do so is one of the finest moments I've ever seen in a TV series.  ""The Sontaran Experiment"" is also enjoyable, albeit short.

531454,5,6302993636,"""Doctor Who"" rarely gets better than the superlative six-part adventure, 'Genesis of the Daleks.'  The story is so well resepct in fan-circles that it was voted the best Who story of all time in numerous fan polls over the years.  And it's one of those stories that truly deserves the status as a classic--not only of Doctor Who but in all television.
The story is a simple one--the Doctor is sent back in time to Skaro to avert the creation of his most ruthless enemies, the Daleks. However, things are more complicated that that.  Soon the Doctor finds himself embroiled in the long-standing battle between the Kaleds, who will eventually become the Daleks and the Thals.  The nice thing about this story is that both sides are presented as being flawed. There's no absolute good or evil--except stopping the horror that will become the Daleks from being created.  And the scene with the Doctor questioning if he has the right to destroy the Daleks and become no better than they are is utterly rivetting.  It shows why Tom Baker was chosen for the job as Doctor as he acts his socks off and delivers a fine performance.  It's nice to see that the man can really act and deliver a fine performance--which is a stark contrast to some of his middle years when he becomes campy and over the top.
Also of note in the story is the performance of Michael Wisher as Davros and Peter Niles as Nyder. Both are chilling villains.
As for the 'Sontaran Experiment' it's a nice experiment for Who--being one of the only stories filmed all on location. The two-part adventure is just long enough to be enjoyable and not long-enough that the glaring plot holes are apparent.  It's a bubble-gum Who story.
But the real gem of this set is Genesis of the Daleks.  It's worth the price of the double tape set to see one of the true classics of all of Doctor Who.",1000080000,,1845,4.549848942598187
531455,4,6302993636,the only bad thing is the first two episodes of Genesis of the Daleks is on the end of Sontaran Experiment. what a pain just to watch Genesis of the Daleks. they should of just put all of Genesis of the Daleks on one tape. other then that Genesis of the Daleks is a great show. also they need to do all the box sets like they did the e-space box set. covers on each tape.,992217600,,371,3.8947368421052633

Genesis of the Daleks is a  fabulous story to be caught up in. An intricate tale that is both brutal  and sophisticated. Michael Wisher as Davros and Peter Miles as Nyder play  their parts to perfection, able to convey their manipulative characters  with authenticity. This is also a great place to learn of the Daleks as  this is perhaps, without a doubt, their best story. Buy this one with  confidence!",951350400,5,646,4.818181818181818

7833700,5,6302993636,"These may be two of the best Dr. Who eps of all time. Baker really had begun hitting his stride, moving outside the script from time to time. Elisabeth Sladen was one of the few companions who could actually keep up with him in these deviations, although ultimately all companions are ""screamers."" If you're looking for their best work together, you might want to find a copy of Pyramid of Mars, but back to the topics at hand...

Genesis is classic BBC story telling at its best, written and performed at a time when many broadcast writers had done (and continued) to write for radio. However, 'Who' was benefitting from some excellent set work, with directors who understood that tight settings with the right props could create a huge image in the viewer's mind when budgets and technology did not allow for the kind of FX we now are used to.

Our heros are forced to challenge their views of right and wrong, and over how far one may have to go to deal with great evil. Secondary characters provide stories of craven collaboration and heroic challenges to authority.

This story also is a good example of why the Daleks became such a fascinating topic over and over again for Doctor Who. Ultimately, they (like evil) never are completely defeated. They have no mercy, only their goal of creating a perfect, Dalek society.

The Sontaran Experiment is a little more of a straight forward adventure yarn, again populated by interesting sub characters. The Sontarans, despite their technology and vast numbers, inevitably succumb to their own rigidity. A much better Sontaran episode emerges down the road, when the Doctor becomes president of Galifry, only to turn the whole plant over to the Sontarans!

These two tales should make almost anyone a fan of Doctor Who, and the whole Tom Baker era represents much of the best of what that show ever offered.",1124150400,6,1856,4.769470404984424
7833701,4,6302993636,"I must admit - I never caught ""The Sontaran Experiment"".  I never much appreciated the Sontarans - these guys have gone a long way towards conquering time itself, yet otherwise involve themselves in a meaningless war with the Rutans.  Obvioulsy, the jewel of this collection is ""Genesis of the Daleks"".  This story is part of an arc that began with ""Ark in Space"" and concluded with the next serial ""Revenge of the Cybermen"".  Returning to the Doctor's TARDIS, the Doctor (Baker) and his companions Harry (Marter) and Sarah (Sladden) are intercepted by one of the Doctor's fellow timelords, and brought to the war torn planet of Skaro.  Who fans know that Skaro was the home planet of the insidious Daleks - horribly mutated creatures that live inside machines.  Though the Daleks would eventually extend their grip across the universe, they were for once bound to Skaro.  Anticipating an era in which the Daleks would attain dominance over the universe, the timelords sent the Doctor on a desperate mission to an era on Skaro that saw their creation.  Learn as much as possible about them, inhibit their evolution and, if possible, destroy them.  Unfortunately (and as you'd expect for a Who story), are characters become embroiled with the politics of Skaro: between the two warring humanoid races of the planet - the Kaleds and the Thals, and between factions of the Kaleds, the apparent progenitors of the Daleks.  We also meet Davros, a horribly mutated Kaled who actually engineers the Daleks.  With their planet scarred by every known form of weaponry - including chemical, bacteriological and nuclear - there seems no hope in preventing the Kaleds from mutating into globby things that will need to travel inside the machines that will become the Daleks.  However, Davros has a mind and soul to match his scarred body - he also engineers a new form of organic life devoid of conscience or any sense of compassion.  Rather than mutant Kaleds, it is these twisted organisms that will become the dreaded Daleks.  The Doctor struggles against both Thals and Kaleds, while occasionally making use of both.

This was a great episode that lives up to its hype.  Though it loses steam in the latter half - in which the insidious Davros uses every form of trickery he knows to protect his project from doubting Kaleds - it's always riveting in true  ""Who"" tradition.  The planet Skaro - burned by centuries of futile war - is a compelling setting, while Davros makes an engaging new enemy - he's something of a Dalek himself.  In a powerful exchange between Davros and the Doctor, the two debate the meaning of power over life and death and the morality that must come with it (somewhat prefiguring a similar conversation between Fiennes and Neeson in ""Schindler"").  Though a kid's story, the dilemma the Doctor faces is very mature - he finds himself empowered to destroy the Daleks before they can threaten the universe - but does he have the right to commit genocide against a then-innocent life-form?

FOR THOSE WHO KNOW NO ""WHO"" - this is one of the stand-out stories that makes a great entry for those knowing little about the show.  ""The Doctor"" is apparently human, but is actually an alien timelord (over 700 years old, two hearts, and the ability to regenerate every time the role needs to be re-cast).  Having a time-spaceship (not seen in this story) the Doctor can travel anywhere in time and space.  Though originally a kid show, this era of ""Who"" coincided with the show's inroads to older American viewers.  Though production values are low, they're more than adequate given the crisp writing which puts the shows light-years ahead of the sedate and sterile thrills of ""Star Trek"" of the late 1980's.  Best of all, the story is a perfect highlight for Tom Baker's dramatic range - his ability to go from a child's whimsy to an adult fury.  Baker was still new to the role (he held it for about 7 years) and the producers scheduled this and a Cybermen story (""Revenge"") to get him up to speed.  Toss in Sarah-Jane Smith and Harry Sullivan as prototypical modern-day British who can go anywhere (or time) the Doctor goes, but never seek to understand what they're doing there.  This was strangely the last Dalek story for years, and probably the last really good one for even longer.",1093219200,3,4296,4.798913043478261
7833702,4,6302993636,"Contrary to popular belief, the sontaran experiment was always a two parter.  Going directly on from Ark in Space, so by extension it became a six part adventure.  These two would have been better combined as the Genesis of the Daleks would have been with Revenge of the Cybermen.  I noticed this after someone mentioned it to me. Styres mission to Earth was a bit pointless, but then it wouldnt have been too dramatic, now would it?. Exactly why does he need to lure a Gal-Sec mission to an EMPTY planet?  Since they are planning to go through Earths Solar system and not the colony worlds.  It isn't a gripe at all.  I have always liked the single-minded Sontarans.
As for Genesis, like others have said, wall yourselves in your city and ignore the other guys.  But of course I loved seeing Davros for the second time,  I had seen Destiny of the Daleks first.  I thought a great design idea to get Davros and his daleks even closer subtley for the viewers would have been to make the Daleks black and silver like his chair.  And yes it could have lost the Muto subplot and the rocket subplot could have been tightened up to make it a four parter.  But over-all I was thoroughly creeped out by Davros's ability to turn life and death into a simple dinner time discussion.  ""Yes I would do it, that power would set me up amongst the Gods!""",1079308800,3,1339,4.420408163265306
7833703,3,6302993636,"The Sontaran Experiment is a snooze, which on its own would get one star from me.  It's slow moving and illogical, although the bug-like machines that the Sontaran uses to capture humans are quite amusing.
The reason to get this particular tape is for the Daleks, who are my favorite baddies in the Doctor Who series, as silly as they are. Yes, they're slow and they can't walk up stairs.  They have no opposable thumb or anything in the nature of one.  They sound utterly and splendidly silly.  If you've never heard a Dalek say ""you will be exterminated"" you won't know why merely typing the phrase makes me giggle, and these probably won't be the episodes that are going to make you fall in love with them.  But for Dalek fans, the six episodes that make up the Genesis of the Daleks are a must have.  They tell us why and how Davros created the Daleks, and give the Doctor the opportunity to stop them.  The action is decent and even though the Nazi analogy gets hammered over our heads, it's a lesson worth repeating.",1064188800,,1022,4.462365591397849
7833704,5,6302993636,"Genisis of the Daleks is the gem here, but Sontaran Experiment is very good too(especially Kevin Linsday)  Genisis starts a chain of events that leads in to Destiny of the Daleks which is also interesting but only if you watched Genisis first.  The delaupidated city in Destiny is in full form here in Genisis with shining black metal corridors, science labs, and the Dalek incubator and all the other stuff a Kaled city should have(mainly people).  Davros is introduced as the Creator of the Daleks, though William Hartnel referred to them as ""Dals"" and ""Kaled"" is inconsistant with this.  Dispite this minor annoyance(which until I watched Hartnel I didn't notice) Genisis is one of the Best Dr. Who stories ever told!  On par with Pertwee's Inferno, Troughton's Tome of the Cybermen, and Hartnell's The Daleks.  I strongly disagree with those that say that Destiny of the Daleks is not a good story too becasue it was!  Destiny was post holicost, Genisis was durning the holicost.  Resurrection was just plain bad(you can disagree if you want to, I don't mind!)If you want Tom Baker get this first!",1053561600,2,1101,4.881720430107527

Galsec colonists, who seem to have thick northern English accents, are also on Earth, having intercepted a distress call.  However, many of their number have been captured and tortured by Styre, a Sontaran.
This two-parter doesn't seem effective as a story, as we don't learn more about Sontarans, and there isn't much that's memorable, be it dialogue or human characters.  It's just a filler as a prelude to Genesis Of The Daleks.  Kevin Lindsey, who was Linx the Sontaran in The Time Warrior, plays Styre.  This was shortly before his death by heart attack.  Terry Walsh (Zake) was a stuntman during the Jon Pertwee years of Who.  (Rating: 2.5)
Half the first tape and all the second tape contain another Who classic, Genesis Of The Daleks (Rating: 5), a kind of prequel to The Daleks.  A Timelord tells the Doctor:  ""We foresee a time when they [the Daleks] will have destroyed all other life forms and become the dominant creature in the universe.... We'd like you to return in time on Skaro at a point in time before the Daleks evolved [and avert their creation] or alter their genetic development so they become less aggressive creations.""  The Doctor agrees and on Skaro, find themselves caught up in the dying stages of a 1,000 year civil war between the Thals and Kaleds.  Harry says that it's a ""war of attrition, only backwards.  At this rate, they're going to finish up with bows and arrows.""
Once captured by Kaleds, the Doctor and Harry learn that an elite group, scientists and military, are a privileged group fighting to bring the war to an end, but also to preserve their race.  The Mark 3 Travel Machine, later named a Dalek, was the means to that and was created by Davros, a mutant humanoid in a black life support chair resembling the bottom half of a Dalek.  However, the scientist Ronson is worried that the Dalek would be without pity or conscience.  He helps the Doctor and Harry escape to the Kaled city, where the leaders might help them stop Davros's work.  Sarah, meanwhile, meets Sevrin, a Muto, with whom she is captured by Thals for use as slave labor on a nuclear-armed rocket.
This story has overtones to World War I and also the Nazis, which was the basis of the Daleks by creator Terry Nation.  The Kaled elite's black uniforms, with lightning bolt insignia, mimic the SS.  Racial purity is another, in the case of the Mutos, mutants created by the use of chemical weapons in the first centuries of the war that were banished to the wasteland.  Davros' speech to the Daleks is similar to Hitler's speech in Triumph Des Willens:  ""From its ashes, will rise a new race, the supreme creature, the ultimate conqueror of the universe, the Dalek.  The action you take today is the beginning of a journey that will take the Daleks to their destiny of universal and absolute supremacy.""
The Doctor has funny lines in this grim tale on the horrors of war and racial supremacy.  ""Then he [Davros] must be exceptional.  Evern I am occasionally wrong about some things.""  To some Thal soldiers when infiltrating their city:  ""Excuse me, can you help me?  I'm a spy.""
Guy Siner (Ravon) and Hilary Minster (the Thal soldier who nearly lets Sarah drop down a pit), later starred in the 'Allo 'Allo comedy series as Lieutenant Gruber and General von Klinkerhoffen, respectively.  Minster also played Marat in Planet Of The Daleks.  Peter Miles is effective as Security Chief Nyder, a Himmler to Davros's Hitler.  He also appeared in the Who stories The Silurians and Invasion Of The Dinosaurs.
This used to be my all-time favorite story, but perhaps its grimness has plunged it down to the top twenty.  Still, it's an important chapter of Dalek history, as it introduced Davros, and set the theme for subsequent Dalek stories.  Overall rating:  3.75, rounded to 4.",1029801600,,3945,4.764359351988218
7833706,5,6302993636,"The twin pack VHS features the short, Sontaran Experiment, only 2 episodes with too many questions left unanswered but lots of action, and the Genesis of the Daleks, a fascinating adult feature, well-written and superbly acted.
In the Genesis, we learn of the origin of the Daleks. The TImeLords snatch Dr. Who and his companions from a transmat beam (the timelord says that his race has not used such crude devices since the universe was half its present age [gives a clue of how old the timelord race is]) and takes them to Skaro, the home planet of the Daleks. THe timelords see a time when the Daleks will overrun the universe and they want Dr. to stop them or prevent them from starting.
Skaro is near the end of a 1000 year war between the Thuls and the Kaleds, the planet's surface is scarred, twisted and populated with Mutos, beings mutated by the war. The Kaleds created an Elite corp of scientists to bring an end to the war.
Enter Davros, a maniacal genuis, bent on creating the supreme being. Davros creates a new species of Kaleds and creates the Dalek to carry them. Warned by Dr. Who, the Kaled govt tries to stop Davros, only to have Davros betray them to the Thuls, who destroy them. Davros then turns the Daleks on the Thuls. The Daleks cry of exterminate. Exterminate still echoes in my mind.
i won't tell the ending but it is predictable and a little dissatisfying.

Davros is the most sinister villian in the Dr. Who collection, more than the Master. His single-mindediness pursuit of the perfect race is terrifying and admirable,too. The Kaled elite dressed as Nazis is a nice touch. It shows what can happen to a culture that becomes so twisted.

The main highlights of the episode are the Dalek invasion of the Thal city, the conspiracy scenes, The Doctor's hesitation over wiping out the Daleks and in doing so commiting Genocide, and the moral debate between Davros' followers about the morals of the Dalek project.
