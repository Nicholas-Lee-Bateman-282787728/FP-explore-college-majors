8382214,5,B002VKE1CK,"This a very good movie that rises well above its limited budget.  The concept isn't new- being held for unknown reasons by an unseen manipulator- but I love how it tied itself into the Abu Ghraib history of torture and presented a picture of unchecked, domestic American authority trampling on the rights of persons, innocent persons who may only look like, in this case, middle-eastern terrorists.  Lena Bookall did a great job in a difficult role as the victimized woman and the lead villain created a creepy character with a memorable voice.  It's well worth the price, unlike a lot of horror films.",1464307200,,602,4.825242718446602

8382217,4,B002VKE1CK,"This film is more than a horror - it is a political diatribe against the forces of conformity and fear that drive our country to do terrible things. Many of the things in this film are based on well researched fact. There is branwashing, there are secret prisons, US citizens have been taken without warrent or proper legal process, and psychotropic drugs and torture are used to gain confessions, even by us. It can happen to anyone who is picked up by the rader of our internal homeland security system, and the Patriot Act gives them the power to do just about what ever they want. This is a frightening manifesto against the Bush policies dealing with potential terrorists. Be afraid. Be very afraid.

8382218,5,B002VKE1CK,"Spectacular!  A must for horror/thriller fans.  Just like the box reads, this one makes ""Saw"" look like a child's game.  Definitely not for the squeamish...definitely not for the kiddies.  Lena Bookall portrays a tortured and brainwashed kidnap victim that experiences so much physical and mental pain she resorts to anything to seek her freedom.  This one is painful...gut-wrenching...a hidden gem that ""Saw"" and ""Hostel"" fans will enjoy since it takes one step beyond the madness in those two films.  Watch it late at night...in the dark...but don't dare to watch it alone.  You'll need someone to hang onto.  All 5 stars!",1281312000,3,624,5.108910891089109
