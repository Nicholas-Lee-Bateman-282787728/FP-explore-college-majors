8695317,5,B000NQ8GA2,Fabulous piece of 1980s Caf Flore history,1450137600,,41,5.0
8695318,5,B000NQ8GA2,This is in my personal Top Ten.  It is so campy and a slice of life in San Francisco's punk and gay art scene.  Using a 50s hygiene film for the flash back sequences is too perfect. I love Marcy Clark.  That whore.,1428883200,,214,3.9302325581395348
8695319,5,B000NQ8GA2,Very campy and very 70's San Francisco.  Not for everyone.,1422662400,,58,4.8
8695320,5,B000NQ8GA2,"This is one of my favorite movies. It is unlike any other I have ever seen is more than quote worthy. It's great to have a copy on disc, finally! The video quality is much better than my old VHS copy, though still beautifully raw.

My only pinch point is that this is sold as a DVD, when it is actually a DVD-R. So beware of that but buy this movie if you are reading this!",1271808000,2,373,3.9078947368421053
8695321,5,B000NQ8GA2,"First came across this film on VHS whilst perusing a video shop on the lower east side of NYC- it was on the shop's ""recommended"" shelf. Suffice to say that when I finally moved to SF in the early 90s, there were only hints of what is captured in this amazing, campy slice of underground/new wave San Francisco circa 1980. On MY ""recommended"" shelf!",1260489600,,349,4.46875
8695322,4,B000NQ8GA2,"I saw this movie way back in 1989. I think it is quite funny, in a Vegas in Space/ Female Trouble sort of way. It has one of the best lines in a movie that i have ever heard...  ""Does he beat ya? Does he beat ya girl? You got burned if he don't beat ya girl!""",1219449600,,259,3.543859649122807
