8277238,5,B001AEFYLU,"I don't think I've ever heard as fine a performance as Mingo gives when he cuts loose on his improvisational flights of fancy; conjunto music is comfort music for many of us from the Southwest and central south regions, and Mingo's is without parallel  in that genre.  (For what it's worth, I'm a confirmed hard rocker and blues lover, and I can't say that I love ALL conjunto (or all rock, or all blues, for that matter), but I think if you give this a listen, you'll also be captivated by the Dancing Cowboy's skill and love of the music he plays from the heart.)",1394409600,,565,4.371428571428571
