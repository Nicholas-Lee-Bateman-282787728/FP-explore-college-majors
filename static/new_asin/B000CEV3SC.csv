8098345,4,B000CEV3SC,"In Vol. 1, you pretty much hit the story arc(at least what I have noticed so far. Still need to watch Vol. 3 & 4). I have to get this out of the way first before somebody writes up a review based on ignorance: IF YOU ARE EXPECTING NONSTOP ACTION, LOOK ELSEWHERE(go view shadow warriors, lone wolf & cub,etc)! If you do not mind a slow building drama where the action/assassination(minimal and straight to the point) culminates near the end of the episode, then give this series a try. This is not your hack and slash type jidageki. The basic premise is where Baian, an accupuncturist, is given assassination jobs by his motojime and is aided by his friend, Hiko. The 2 gather recon on how to take out their targets and they time their assassinations at the most critical hour. From this Volume, episode 4 is clearly the best one and i like it the most out of the first 2 volumes. There is alot more action in this than previous episodes as well. If you liked Volume 1 then you will like Volume 2. Again, don't expect this to be a free-for-all slash fest.",1215043200,,1054,4.38265306122449
8098346,5,B000CEV3SC,"Acupuncturist, Dr. Baian considers himself an asset to his community with a very Dark secret. He returns & is still an Assassin, but he only takes money for killing evil, fiendish,  people that deserve to die based on his own moral judgement using an extra large accupunture needle to the back of the neck of his victims while they are sleeping which leaves no trace. Set again during the Japanese Edo period, scenes takes place mainly in sleazy bars & brothels, capturing a sense of the Japanese underworld of that time.

A little slow with not much action so If ya want lotsa action I recommend Demon Spies, Shadow Hunters or Lone Wolf with Cub.",1145145600,4,647,4.6173913043478265
