8247926,5,B0012VEM5A,I found this video to be very informative and I would recommend it to anyone who is thinking about purchasing it.,1504569600,,113,4.428571428571429
8247927,4,B0012VEM5A,"Another average in-fisherman DVD. I was excited to hear there was going to be a segment on summer crappie fishing with lights at night. All this DVD shows is him having lights on the water and fishing with a bobber on outskirts of light and pulling crappie in. No information on where in a reseviour one should set up to do this and what to look for so in that I'm no better off.

Had a good segment of road runners in shallow water to target prespawn crappie in water temp gets around 55.

Another good section on using sonar and why fishing when fish are vertical in groups is better than when they group horizontally in the water column.

Shows winter crappie in a reseviour. Targeting outside bends of submerged creek channel in 17 plus foot of water in middle of big cove.

Use lightest jig you possibly can because depth and drop speed are critical for suspending crappie.

Just summed up everything you will probably learn from this DVD.",1435968000,,944,4.497076023391813
8247928,2,B0012VEM5A,Cheesy and not very much information. I learned one thing in the whole video I guess. I would buy a book next time.,1386979200,,115,4.043478260869565
