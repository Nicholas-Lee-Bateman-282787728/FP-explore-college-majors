8549003,4,B00AA9QHLW,"A ""Live"" sit down,  studio performance in the semi-round.  No audience present keeps the focus on the music.  The artists most listeners will know are: Dean Torrance (Jan & Dean), Jeff ""Skunk"" Baxter (Steely Dan, Doobie Brothers) and Matt Jardine (Wilson Phillips).  For playback,  the choices are high resolution DVD/Surround Sound 5.1 and on the flip side of the dual disc, DVD Audio only 5.1 Surround Sound or 2 Channel Stereo.  The performance is tight.  This is grown up music going fast forward in the now time zone.  Don Raymond, Philip Bardowell, and Randell Kirsch (Papa Doo Run Run) have the chops on vocals.  Dean Torrance doesn't hit the  high notes on this release like twenty years ago with Jan Berry. He's still though a presence and at times a class clown.  The guy who really shines is Jeff ""Skunk"" Baxter.  His technique is a pure gift to watch especially on the melodic instrumentals.  ""I Get Surround"" is not a Beach Boys/Jan & Dean/Surf music  tribute.  The Surf City Allstar Band find their own niche in the mode of the mellow  ""Five Summer Stories"" minus the cover songs - ""Surf City"", ""Sloop John B."" and ""The Little Old Lady From Pasadena"".  The bonus section has lengthy interviews and biographies bringing their backgrounds up to date.  ""I Get Surround"" is like stumbling on a rare, preserved  silver  coin.
