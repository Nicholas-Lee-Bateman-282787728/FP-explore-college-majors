7425723,4,B0152AVVOQ,"The answer to the question above is in this movie because that's what happens when 2 teenage boys living in the slums of Rio find something valuable in the city dump. This movie has a lot of heart and it comes with a beautiful message of faith, perseverance and determination. The 3 boys were fan to watch, such a group of talented boys plus Rooney Mara and Martin Sheen speaking Portuguese was amazing. Great movie but I won't say much not to spoil this brilliant plot but I might add that the scenes in the cemetery were my favorite.",1444867200,5,535,4.414141414141414
7425754,5,B0152AVVOQ,"Bought this after seeing the trailer. I love this movie about young boys who pick trash in a Brazilian dump and find a wallet. Although considered trash themselves by some in their society, they turn out to be little heros with great integrity. I don't understand why professional movie critics were hard on this fiilm as many who watched this film loved it. It is almost as if some people don't believe in the possibility of goodness in the human heart, even amidst great poverty and oppression.",1484352000,,496,4.712643678160919

7425758,4,B0152AVVOQ,An examination of the corrupt and brutal political/police state in Rio. How three youngsters (trash) who work on the garbage  (trash) heaps find a wallet incriminating a politician accepting bribes. They do what they think is the right thing to do.,1479254400,,248,5.048780487804878
7425759,5,B0152AVVOQ,"This movie is primarily in Portuguese, so reading is required to watch it. But the movie is fast-paced and you soon forget that you're reading. This is an inspiring movie about 3 boys, with the help of a missionary priest and female teacher that overcome rampant police and local government corruption. At great risk to their personal safety, they work together to expose a corrupt mayor-wanna-be and police department. It brings to light how poor people in Brazil are viewed and treated. Most of all, however, it beautifully brings out the fact that there is good and beauty in everyone, if we only take time to notice it. A very well done film worth seeing.",1477872000,,659,4.739130434782608

7425798,5,B0152AVVOQ,"I bought this because Rooney Mara was in it, but it turned out to have a compelling story-line and I was unable to look away!  The kids in this movie are amazing and I can not believe that more have not been heard about this in the U.S. That is the unfortunate truth with a number of foreign placed cinema, but I know that this is also currently streaming on Netflix.

It is a fantastic movie and should not be missed.  I was shocked at how they were treated throughout the film and how good-hearted these kids were!  Check this one out, because it is one of those stories that simply cannot be described!",1459382400,4,605,4.280701754385965

7425800,5,B0152AVVOQ,"A sad and a terrible indictment of political corruption in 2rd and 3rd world countries.  Unfortunately, it is now becoming more common in 1st world countries.

7425815,5,B0152AVVOQ,Really enjoyed this movie,1455840000,,25,5.5
7425816,5,B0152AVVOQ,"This movie is the best movie I've seen in a long time, so good I never wanted the story to end. It's the kind of movie that sticks with you, that makes you hope you and the world could be made just a little bit better, like these kids make things just a little bit better.

Without giving anything away let's just say the adventure starts with a boy finding a wallet in a trash dump in a Brazilian slum where he and his friends live and work, hoping to gather enough money to basically live. Actually before that it starts with a man running for his life, throwing said wallet into a trash truck off a bridge, and then his murder. And so begins an adventure that is far grittier and real than most coming of age/kids doing the right thing tale. Disney, this ain't. And you, much like the boys, will have no idea what is going on or why that wallet is so important either, not until the moment they do.

In short, THIS is storytelling at its finest. And it's set in a world most would simply walk past or turn their nose up at even, having no idea of the heart and soul three teenage boys from the streets could possess.

It's the sort of movie that makes other movies pale in comparison. Other movies only try to do what this movie did, which is tell a complex at times touching, at times terrifying, story of hope and determination to do the right thing even when all the odds are against one. And yes, unless you speak Brazilian you will have to read subtitles and no, it won't matter at all. I understood the whole story and wasn't really even conscious of reading the titles, because I was so caught up in the story.

If you haven't seen it treat yourself and do so. If you're like me you will forever thankful you took a chance on this unlikely titled film.",1455494400,5,1762,4.2351190476190474
7425817,5,B0152AVVOQ,Stick with he movie...you can follow the Portugese.  There are a  few English speaking segments,1454371200,,95,5.266666666666667

7425819,5,B0152AVVOQ,"I love a good ,well made foreign. It gives one the chance to see he world through the eyes of people who live in countries less fortunately than we are. Great story. Enjoyed it very much.",1452470400,,187,4.222222222222222
7425820,5,B0152AVVOQ,"This movie brings to life the story of three young boys from a third world dumpsite who find something that will change their lives. The poverty, fear and friendship they share comes across as real and genuine.

A film I enjoyed as much for its suspenseful chase scenes as I did for its sites and sounds of hidden Rio de Janeiro. I read the book when it first came out and though I assumed it was in the Philippines, nothing was lost in the change of locale.  Excellent Movie!",1451865600,,476,4.337078651685394

7425834,5,B0152AVVOQ,"This is so touching!!! The three boys are s brave! I was came for Rooney but this film is really not just about anyone since each role plays an very important part and all the characters are live and sunny! The name of it is called Trash, and there is a scene at the very last few minutes when the boys are throwing cash into the mountains of trashes, which is soooo amazingly captured, hit right to the point where money would be less than trash when people are chasing them with evil desires. Great love! 5 stars!!!!",1450310400,,518,4.295918367346939

7425837,5,B0152AVVOQ,Though the trash scenes went on for far too long.  The two nude scenes were tasteful and hardly gratuitous although five minutes of full frontal male nudity seems a bit much.,1448409600,,174,4.612903225806452

Those three children were amazing actors, and I think even Matt Damon would be impressed at their ability to do Jason Bourne type escape stunts.  I wish I could give this movie ten stars.
