246362,5,6300214044,"This movie chronicals the real life of John Merrick, or the Elephant Man as he was refered to.  Raised or discovered by a circus man, Merrick traveled 19th century England as a freak, where his incredible deformation and disfiguration brought about the curiousity of a doctor(Anthony Hopkins).  The doctor discoves although he has been treated like an animal, Merrick is actually intelligent and articulate.  He introduces him to British society and becomes his friend. The trials and tribulations of this story are what ensue. This is an amazing movie.  David Lynch is at his directorial best  creating a tale of simpathy, facination, gratification, cruelty, and redeption.  John Hurt is brilliant as Merrick giving layer after layer to such a complex character.  The make up artists also did a terrific job transforming Hurt into Merrick.  This film is a classic and anyone who loves movies should see it.  I highly recommend it.",972345600,4,931,5.112582781456954
246363,5,6300214044,"I have always had unusual fascinations, and Joseph Merrick is no exception. At the time The Elephant Man was released in 1980, I was but a mere second grader. I was enthralled by the mystery and spook factor of  such a stark and dreary film. Today, I am a film student/director. My films  are mostly in the style of David Lynch, David Fincher and Ridley Scott -  dark and eerie. The mood which low lighting creates is unsurpassed in its  ability to create a dreamlike atmosphere. Furthermore, the majority of the  stories I write and the films that I intend to make one day, all revolve  around persons whom have had to overcome seemingly insurmountable  struggles. While as a boy it was the esoteric 'creepiness' which interested  me, I look back upon such experiences as being instrumental in shaping me  artistically. I feel there is no better story to tell than that of people  who live in a world of intolerance and have the ability to create for  themselves a life despite their outcast status. My compliments to you as  well for dedicating yourself to such an endlessly interesting subject as  Joseph Merrick. His is a lesson to be relished not only from the  perspective of disabilities, but from one of self-respect, steadfastness  and determination; Very unique characteristics in a situation which might  daunt the average man.
The Elephant Man is one of the few examples of a  genuine masterpice. It encompasses all the necessary components required to  create a balanced and rythmic piece of work. The cinematography by Freddie  Francis renders a cold, hard world of poverty and strife in London of the  late 19th century. A mood which sets the stage in painting the portrait of  a man whose life was plagued tenfold on account of his ghastly deformation.  In a society where appearance was everything and pretense the norm, the  film's various themes include the fact that there always have been people  who were altruistic enough to go against the grain. In this I refer not  only to Joseph Merrick, but to Sir Frederick Treves and Dame Madge Kendall.  Two figures at the upper eschelon of Victorian society who did not permit  the trappings of wealth, beauty and power to control their need to bestow  kindness upon a person in dire circumstances. The music in this film is  perfectly calculated to complement the sadness surrounding a predicament  such as the shrouding Merrick. Other times the music boasts the lavish  entity which was Victorian society. And still at other moments, the sick  fascination of the lowly freakshow spectators crowd is demonstrated in the  ratchety strains of carnival  bells and whistles. In all, the performances  of the major and minor players in this film are beyond perfection. Not only  can they deliver the characters flawlessly, but it is obvious that the  ensemble of actors was carefully pondered and then pondered again until  coming up with the talent which could carry this monument of a film. The  Elephant Man has an uncanny ability to depict the exploited- this film  easily rivals Freaks.",961459200,2,3052,4.884765625
246364,5,6300214044,"Lynch has crafted one of the most moving films I've ever seen, but has also blessed it with his typically strong sense of atmosphere and mood.  The tender performances of Anthony Hopkins, John Hurt, John Gielgud and  others mesh beautifully with the evocative imagery and sends the viewer  immediately to the specific time and place. There is no reason why this  film should not be on the AFI top 100 list.",956793600,4,406,4.676056338028169
246365,5,6300214044,"I'm not sure what I should say, except that this film was extremely moving and has a special place in my passion for films.  John Hurt, entirely worhty of his oscar nod, plays John Merrick, a man derformed from birth and  isolated since as a freakshow so overwhelming, the London police threaten  to close the show.  Anthony Hopkins, another amazing actor, plays Dr.  Treves, a compassionate and humane man who is so stricken by the abuse this  man suffers, he offers to review Merrick in his hospital and supply  somekind of care.  As Merrick becomes more known among the social elite and  the public, his torture is soothed and provoked by the sudden influx of  attention.  From mocking party-goers to suspicious mobs, Merrick is thrown  deeper and deeper into depression as he is subjected to a new dimension of  humiliation and pain.  There is plenty to sob about throughout this movie,  but save your tears for the end, you'll need them all.",956707200,3,946,4.753086419753086
246366,4,6300214044,"It is difficult to start a review of this one because giving this film a context and a framework is incredibly difficult. Once that is done though it is easy to say that this is the sin qua non of Lynch's work. The stunning black and white photography, the languid artsy pacing, a circus of the odd and profane and at the heart the simplist most primal story of being seen as a freak by the world. Lynch, Burton and Gilliam would all tackle this topic later in their careers but here, in the hands of an un-tried and rampagingly iconoclastic young David Lynch is perhaps the clearest and most touching take on the subject. The film aches and every insult is felt by the viewer. In many ways this is both Lynch's most accessable AND most artistic vision reaching depths he has only gotten to years later with The Straight Story. Within this movie are the seeds of Dune, Blue Velvet and Lost Highway without the sense of comprimise that seeped into Wild at Heart and Fire Walk with Me. In taking a step away from the Freudian mire of Eraserhead, Lynch crafts a deeper and more incissive study of the human soul and exposes what human really means.
As for the Disc itself, well Stunning is an adaquate discription really. END",954806400,,1222,4.484304932735426

John Hurt is amazing, and so is the cinematography, the costumes, the setting, the pacing, and nearly everything about the film. Among the bonus features are:

- Jonathan Sanger went to Bobs Big Boy to discuss projects, he mentioned The Elephant Man, and Davids eyes lit up

246712,5,6300214044,"One of the first films (in addition to Star Wars, Grease and Cabaret) I viscerally remember as a child.  The heart and soul that John Hurt breathes into his portrayal of John Merrick blends all the better with Lynch's noir cinematography and Hopkins stoic, good doctor.  A beautiful, horror of one man's life - who perhaps is more perfectly human than any one of those oppressors who so mercilessly try and keep him down.  And yet, he rises above achieving as normal a life as he could hope for, realizing dreams and touching lives until he relinquishes himself to the belief that to die happy is better than to wait for a sadder tomorrow.  This captivating black and white film inspired me at a young age to overcome any personal obstacles I felt could ever be responsible for holding me back from the life I wanted to lead, for no obstacle could be as trying as having the physical deformities of The Elephant Man.  A simply grand statement of a more respectful and optimistic future for mankind.",1486166400,9,998,4.6158192090395485

246791,5,6300214044,"Would kill for a decent blu ray of this movie, but I feel that the film is a classic. It takes on a sentimental subject with a very loose interpretation of the real life events. It is very loosely based on the true story but makes up for that with its artistic representation of the characters. Many of the themes, the magical nightmare sequences, and the London setting oddly had me drawing a comparison to Harry Potter. David Lynch is not just a surreal director with a love for the weird, he is very earnest in his treatment of people, and occasionally goes overboard in pursuing pure emotions. Even the hard-hearted might find themselves tearing up by the end. The high contrast black and white cinematography, wedded to David Lynch's trademark sound design, makes for excellent movie watching.",1474329600,,798,4.7898550724637685

246840,5,6300214044,"David Lynch's most narratively straightforward and touching story of the real life John Merrick (formally Joseph Merrick) who suffered from a horrific case of elephantitis and was rescued by a kind doctor (the great Sir Anthony Hopkins of Silence of the Lambs fame, of course) from a cruel, sadistic opportunist of a freak show owner and provides him with much more than medical help, but also befriends him and introduces him to a number of equally kind people.
I've found this film to be one of the most moving I've ever seen. The ending made me cry like a little baby. I also found Laura Palmer in Twin Peaks: FWWM to be a very sympathetic character, as you feel both her deep sadness and terror, but being an emotional person, myself and embarrassingly admitting this, even Laura Palmer and her terrible plight wasn't even as utterly heartbreaking to me, partly because The Elephant Man was treated so horribly his entire life despite the fact that he was intelligent, kind, and polite man and also because it is a true story.",1463788800,3,1030,4.727777777777778

 Recently I came across a second hand copy and watched it now more mature and appreciative of the art of making movies and I was taken by the power of it what this movie says about us as human beings. The acting, the special effects, the pace and of course the directing make The Elephant Man a truly great movie and David Lynch's greatest work.

 Anthony Hopkins and John Hurt are outstanding in this and especially Hurt's portrayal of Mr. Merrick who made you just wish people would look into their hearts and let the poor guy be. I cried a bit again at times but I was almost shaking with rage in that scene when the rabble invade his bedroom get him drunk and humiliate him.

 I wonder if Mr. Merrick ever considered his life short as it was would be remembered and his story passed down from generation to generation more than a century after his death as examples of both the best and worst of humanity.",1463702400,,1060,4.328282828282828

246912,5,6300214044,"An amazing film. I believe this film expresses the affects of what its like to be alienated, segregated; what its like to feel what an animal feels when its treated harshly and abused. This film is outstanding in every department and makes the audience feel deep emotional attachment for it's characters. I saw this film in the theater when it came out many years ago and I was just a teenager, not understanding what it had to offer to the viewer. As an adult, now owning the DVD and having watched it again since the first time I saw it, it comes across with all new meaning and understanding. It's an emotional film with many high points and low points, like life itself, allowing you to really relate to the story line and the characters. Amazing make up effects and spectacular acting from the entire cast. A timeless film that will span throughout time. Bravo. Highly recommended.",1450656000,,886,4.649681528662421
246953,5,6300214044,"Wow, what can I say? This movie pretty much speaks for itself. It is difficult to review a movie this incredibly moving and beautiful, because there is so much to be said about it. I will not go into laborious detail of the movie for it has been described before. Rather, I will give you my personal feedback  for I believe those who cherish this film find a strong personal connection with it.
Some of the most fundamental lessons in life are the one's most worth revisiting. For this movie teaches us about ourselves. While we, the audience, engage in the unflattering and ignoble act of exploitation and viewing horror for our own puerile curiosity. It is only afterward we see how wrong and shallow we were  to judge and evaluate those who are different. As our title's character is slowly revealed to us, the movie builds up the anticipation with such apprehension and suspense we feel we have to embrace ourselves for that moment of shock only to realize how childish and silly we were.
The Elephant Man is a movie that does just that to us. It forces us to look within ourselves and society as a whole. Many of us with a moral compass and a heart know very well that we should never judge a person by the way they look, but we still often forget to live up to that precept.

This film is vividly photographed providing juxtapositions that work to the theme's benefit: first we see the Heightened formality and refinement of Victorian society, then we see the underbelly of the Industrial revolution in London with all the haunting images and sounds of the hissing gas lamps, machine factories, smelly wharfs, dingy brick buildings and damp streets that truly enhance the atmospheric quality. David Lynch is a bit more retrained here with his usual propensity for delving into the surreal imagery, but the few dreamlike sequences are used appropriately and help us peer into Merrick's soul.
Needless to say, this movie will force you to hold back tears and will test your viewing courage. It requires some bravery to watch this movie, but it certainly has its monumental reward. I truly contend that this movie is the most sad and moving film I have seen. There are other great and sad films, but this one just seems to be a bit more heart rending than the others. Whatever David Lynch did here he sure was effective in touching our emotions from fear, apprehension, guilt, compassion, love, hate, despair and anger.
The acting is is completely terrific. Hurt and Hopkins simply shine. Much care and detail went into the making of this movie and it deserves to be more appreciated. It is a far better movie than its winning contender, ""Ordinary People"" and better acted as well.",1450224000,,2684,4.682203389830509

247112,5,6300214044,"Based on the true story of Joseph ""John"" Merrick, The Elephant Man has long been one of my favorite films and showcases the inordinately broad talents of its main stars...Anthony Hopkins and John Hurt:  The two are impeccable in their grasp of the characters they portray;  Frederick Treves and John Merrick, as physician and his incredibly disfigured patient are truly riveting and moving.  John Gielgud as the hospital head Carr Gomm,  Wendy Hiller as head nurse Mothershead and Anne Bancroft, as Mrs. Kendall round out this fine cast but it is Freddie Jones, as Bytes...the man who had turned John into a side-show freak and whom he severely mistreats, beats mercilessly while holding him as a virtual prisoner, who all but steals the show.  Bytes earns his living from those who enjoy and cringe at seeing such grotesqueness in the flesh.  He is the man you love to hate and hate him you do!  It becomes a visceral feeling, palpable within ones self and a thing one cannot gain enough distance from!  While he was quite normal as a child, John Merrick is now covered in large, tumor-like growths which have formed all over his body, including his face and head, which are huge and frightening to see.  Bytes sells John to Doctor Treves and Treves arranges to have Mr. Merrick live within the hospital itself, to keep him safe from harm as he researches John's peculiarities and tries to make him comfortable.  While there, Treves exposes him to stimuli such as literature, art and theater...which not only seems to please him but reveals an intelligence not thought to have been there before this time. Eventually Merrick is allowed to go outside of the hospital walls and visit with Treves, or go to the theater and enjoy some of the things any normal person might. Michael Elphick, who plays the Night Porter, certainly deserves a bit more than honorable mention in the same category as Bytes.  He is a thoroughly dislikeable creature who also makes money from the afflictions of Mr. Merrick by exposing him to hoards of people including loose women, drunken men looking for cheap thrills with their lady-friends and those who are generally detestable themselves.  The hospital room he occupies is far from the inner working of the institution and no one realizes what the porter is doing on almost a nightly basis and knows he can die if his head is ever allowed to drop forward. John has much trouble breathing properly and is never allowed to sleep in a prone position or sitting straight up.  He is always propped up at an angle since the sheer weight of his head would crush his windpipe leaving him helpless since his neck muscles would not allow him to recover and quite likely, death would occur within moments!  Lovingly directed by David Lynch...The tagline for the film was ""I am not an animal! I am a human being! I...am...a man!""",1434672000,7,2848,4.762195121951219

247478,4,6300214044,"An excellent movie in its own right, The Elephant Man is a well-crafted and directed B&W movie.  It has David Lynch written all over it.  If for no other reason, it must be seen for the acting of John Hurt if nothing else.  He is superb!  It is one thing having to wear such heavy and constraining makeup.  It is quite another being able to exude emotion and pathos through it.  Hurt at his best.

Though the lineup of actors is superb (Wendy Hiller, Sire John Gielgud, Anne Bancroft, Anthony Hopkins) my pick is Freddie Jones as Bites, John Merrick's (the Elephant Man) eerily cruel and greedy owner.",1417219200,3,601,4.5092592592592595

247483,5,6300214044,"I hadn't seen this wonderful film in many years and have to say that it is one of the best films in American film history. Director David Lynch brings his own dark, claustraphobic energy to every scene here. Anthony Hopkins gives a wonderful turn as the Doctor who takes in and then befriends John Merrick, the Elephant Man. Nothing can describe Hopkins face when he first lays eyes upon Merrick. It is heartbreakingly a stunning moment in film. John Hurt, as Merrick, gives a stellar performance. He is virtually completely covered by make-up in this role and has only his eyes and voice to convey the emotions that he needs to use for this performance. Wonderfully acted by every cast member and beautifully shot in glorious black-and-white, this film at first may seem like it's going to be depressing due to the subject matter but it ultimately will leave you filled with hope by the last scene.",1416441600,,899,4.732484076433121
247484,5,6300214044,"I thought this was a very emotional story about a man who had a disease which caused abnormal growths on his head, and body.  Normal people made fun of him or were afraid of him.  He couldn't live a normal life, although he was a very smart man.  It is a good story because most of it is true.  People didn't know what to do in these cases in those days.  He was laughed at and teased. It shows how cruel people can be to each other, while others can show love,  caring and helpfulness.",1415923200,,486,4.063157894736842

247538,5,6300214044,"This is not your typical performance. When you recognize that and engage yourself, you will feel transformed from watching.  Much has already been said about the actors and production, regarding quality of production.  So I hope my review provides somewhat of a unique slant.  The movie portrays a very isolated person who not of his own doing, has been ostracized from society. Being beaten by a man who truly kidnapped him for his circus eventually lead to his ticket to freedom from that man (who kidnapped him) at that circus.  The concept of beating a bad man with a gun is by having a good man with a gun - is certainly conveyed.  Yet the doctor who saved him stepped back for a bit, saddened that HIS 'gun' was even needed.  His wife assured him that the publicity that the young man received once he became a part of their lives was much better, and carthartic for the young man.  Still, the wolves (the bad guys) were constantly trying to get to him, to use him as a freak show.  Their characters were well-played, which spoke well on who were the real beasts.  This young man lived a very short life, yet his fulfillment in truth was in his possession, because he  was found and rescued by people who truly loved him and no more was his isolation a problem, it was a victory.  He could use his talents and enjoy peace.  Despite the fact he was kidnapped again, it was apparent that justice was served on the captors.  And at the end, when he slept with his window open, it was a sign that fear was not welcome in his life.  Let this parable-like film bring your own meaning when you watch it.  Life has its way of teaching us at our own paces. In this respect, we run no race. We compete with ourselves.",1413849600,2,1713,4.3765822784810124

Based on a true story, the movie is about John Merrick, a horrifically deformed man who Anthony Hopkins' character (Frederick Treeves) finds as a sideshow freak in a carnival. Initially, he only displays him in a similar manner to his colleagues (he's a doctor), but after finding out that the man is intelligent he begins to care for him. The movie isn't quite easy to sit through, as you see the mental and physical abuse that John is put through. But for all the moments like that, there are many more touching moments that will put a smile on your face and/or a tear in your eye. I'll be honest, I cried on more than one occasion, and this has to be one of the most emotionally powerful movies I've ever seen.

The Elephant Man (1980) stars John Hurt, Anthony Hopkins, Anne Bancroft, and John Gielgud.  This movie, directed by David Lynch, was filmed in black-and-white, unusual for a movie made in 1980.  However, black-and-white was THE way to film this.  From a psychological standpoint, black-and-white fits the story so well.  This movie is about Joseph Merrick, a severely deformed human oddity who lived in late nineteenth century England, and what he went through during his life.  I don't want to give away too much, you'll have to watch it for yourself.  The acting is great, especially by John Hurt, who plays the lead role.  A younger Anthony Hopkins also gives a great performance as Merrick's doctor.  This movie has great cinematography throughout.  The musical score is good as well and is used sparingly throughout the movie.  This movie was nominated for 8 Academy Awards, but didn't win any.

I consider this movie a masterpiece.  See it.",1384819200,,1070,5.074712643678161

The `Elephant Man' is physically a horrendously `painted bird', whose deformed features are cynically exploited by `businessmen'. Being `abnormal', he is hounded by racists and fiercely attacked by the mob. Psychologically, however, he himself is the most generous of men.
Of course, this movie doesn't brush a very `bright' picture of mankind. Its harsh and violent scenes are nearly unbearable and go straight to the heart of a `conscious' spectator.
`The Elephant Man' is a horror movie, but not in the normal sense. The horror doesn't come from a seriously misshapen man, but from his treatment by his `fellow-creatures' and their barbaric slogan: individuals who are not normal have to be slaughtered.

247973,5,6300214044,"Where do I begin?

This wondrous, shattering, electrifying, deeply humane film moved me so profoundly upon first seeing it a preview studio screening that when I approached John Hurt afterward to tell him how deeply his performance had touched me I found that I could only get out a few heartfelt words before my throat closed up completely and tears spilled down my cheeks. Oh Lord -- what is the man going to think?! Well, I was stunned when Hurt put his arms around me, hugged me close, and whispered in my ear ""Thank you. That is the greatest compliment I have ever received. But those tears aren't for me - they're for John Merrick.""

Needless to say, I found myself going home in an emotionally drained yet exhilarated daze, and could not sleep because of the haunting primal power of Lynch's extraordinary artistry, the unforgettable, heartbreaking score by John Morris (a family friend), the exquisite black and white cinematography by Freddie Francis, the astonishing make-up by Christopher Tucker, and the magnificent performances by the entire ensemble of brilliant actors.

Equal parts fable, fairy-tale, and dark, brooding, industrial-revolution nightmare, 'The Elephant Man' is that true rarity - a film filled with compassionate sentiment which somehow manages to be neither maudlin nor cloying: a miracle given the myriad potential traps inherent in the subject matter.

Both hellish and heavenly, 'The Elephant Man', along with 'Eraserhead', 'Blue Velvet', 'The Straight Story' and 'Mulholland Drive', is one of Lynch's finest artistic achievements and destined to be a timeless classic. Miss it at your peril.",1376092800,11,1627,5.222222222222222

The Elephant Man is an interesting dramatized character story of a severely deformed man who transcends the abusive life of the freak show circuit and gains dignity and acceptance. I won't go into lengthy detail about the plot, but having worked with children with severe disabilities, I enjoyed this film and the way it casts a hopeful light for people who have been historically marginalized/abused.

That's unfortunate, because The Elephant Man deals with those same dark underbellies, morbid curiosities and human cruelties, while offering glimpses of compassion, empathy and redemption his other films seem to lack. Using stark black and white cinematography, he conjures up the gritty and gruesome realities of Weegee's New York City photography to depict London's industrial revolution of the late 19th century. Gaslight, horse dung in streets, walls stained with industrial filth and a cast of characters ranging from the completely depraved to social elite, are all woven together in a rich tapestry wrapped around the tragic life of John Merrick. Not a single frame of film is wasted nor is the exceptionally well crafted storyline and acting talents of Sir Anthony Hopkins, Sir John Gielgud, Anne Bancroft and, what this viewer believes to be one of the finest film performances of the late 20th century, John Hurt.

248331,4,6300214044,"John Hurt played the title role, John Merrick, but I'm betting you will not recognize him under the absolutely amazing make-up job. John Merrick was a real person, although this is not a literal biography of his life, as far as I know. [Wikipedia says his real first name was Joseph, but that Dr. Treves got it wrong in his memoirs.] He lived in Victorian England, and he had the most extreme form of his disease (I went to Wikipedia and get the technical name; Neurofibromatosis) that Dr. Frederick Treves (Sir Anthony Hopkins) had ever seen. His head was huge and incredibly distorted, much of the rest of his body was too, although his left arm and his genitals were normal.

Dr. Treves found him in a freak show, where he was being horribly abused, and brought him to the London hospital where Treves was a surgeon. He installed him in the ""isolation ward"" at the top of the hospital, and soon learned that Merrick was not the idiot he had assumed he was, even hoped he was, to avoid thinking of how miserable his life must have been. In fact, when he introduces Merrick to the head of the hospital (Sir John Gielgud, I believe), the head thinks he is simply mindlessly parroting what Dr. Treves had taught him. But when he recites the entire 23rd Psalm, while Treves had only taught him the first few lines, they both become aware that the man has a normal, perhaps even a superior, intelligence.

His speech was at first terribly slurred by the shape of his mouth, but with practice, he learned to speak pretty well. Treves takes him home to meet Mrs. Treves, who is very kind to Merrick. Eventually Treves introduces Merrick to a great many other members of London polite society, including a famous actress played by Anne Bancroft.

But the coarser elements of London are not done with The Elephant Man. One of the men who works in the boiler room of the hospital discovers where he lives, and starts charging people at the local pub to climb up to the roof and look through his window at him. One such gawking party gets completely out of hand. The boiler-man thinks it amusing to bring along a mirror, perhaps having noticed that there were no mirrors in Merrick's room, and speculating that he may not ever have seen himself. Apparently he was right, because Merrick screams and goes into shock when he sees himself in the mirror.

Included in the number is the old drunken sadist who had exhibited him in a sideshow. He kidnaps Merrick and takes him to France to renew his sideshow career. But the other freaks help him to escape, and he returns to England.

No, I haven't told you too much. There's a great deal more to the story, including especially a rather stark contrast between those who feel real compassion for Merrick and do what they can to make his life more comfortable and even pleasant, and those who just want to make money and bad jokes off him. Indeed, Dr. Treves is so sensitive that he worries he's no better than the sideshow man because he has introduced Merrick to society people. His wife reassures him that John his happier than he has ever been before, although I must say that's not the greatest compliment in the world.

This is not a horror story. It's a story of courage and compassion. Indeed, it could rightly be called a love story on several levels.",1336953600,3,3295,4.548060708263069
248332,5,6300214044,"And there WERE a few women in the movie who screamed in terror when accidentally walking in on the Elephant Man. You would think they had walked in on a body that had been hacked into pieces. It was the saddest thing ever. And this was the framework for the movie. We get a few glimpses of the Elephant Man before we finally see him full-on, including all the deformities on his face and the back of his head. And we eventually get to know him not as the Elephant Man, but as John Merrick, an intelligent human being with thoughts and feelings just like the rest of us. (The intelligence factor may be debated for some of the other characters in the movie.)

I first saw this movie when I was a kid and I thought it was old because of the black and white. I see now that it is not; it was shot that way for atmosphere. It's probably considered classic now though, even though it's not really old enough yet (in my opinion).

I love the lesson that this movie teaches. At its simplest, it is to treat your fellow human beings with kindness. There are a lot of things wrong with the world, but if everyone followed that one rule, we would be well on our way to a better world for everyone.

It really is a shame this movie did not win any of the Oscars it was nominated for. I know Ordinary People won that year (because it happened to be the year I was born). The Oscars have made some questionable decisions sometimes, choosing some ridiculous movies as winners, but at least Ordinary People was a worthy movie dealing with another very important topic.

That's the phrase spoken by one of the main characters in the play's most tender and heartrending scene. This is the tragic story of Joseph Merrick, the Elephant Man, (called ""John"" Merrick here) by award-winning playwright Bernard Pomerance.

A prominent young surgeon comes across the Elephant Man earning a living in the sideshows (which the real Merrick did fairly successfully in real life until he was robbed and abandoned by a callous manager. This is shown in the play as well.) The doctor, Frederick Treves, presents Merrick to his fellow physicians, describing his many deformities.

As Treves displays slides of the real Merrick, an extraordinarily handsome young man (Philip Anglim) begins to twist and contort himself in an approximation of Merrick, and remains that way through the rest of the play. The audience is asked to suspend belief and perceive Anglim as the grotesque Merrick, based on the other characters' horrified response to him. It's not always easy to keep that in mind, but Pomerance makes the point that beneath his deformities, Merrick was a human being like the rest of us, with normal feelings, dreams and desires.",1333497600,,1210,5.106060606060606
248334,5,6300214044,"The Elephant Man (1980)
Drama, Biography, 124 minutes
Directed by David Lynch
Starring Anthony Hopkins, John Hurt and John Gielgud

Here's a film that I was completely wrong about when I first saw it. I was about 20 at the time and was probably watching it to see how grotesque the main character appeared. Now, some 30 years later, David Lynch has become one of my favorite directors and I am able to appreciate movies on a different level.

The Elephant Man is not a typical David Lynch film. You can clearly see his style all over it (such as his fascination with machinery), but the story is not as complex and difficult as later efforts; this is grounded in reality. John Merrick (Hurt) existed in Victorian England, although he was really called Joseph Merrick. A cast of his head exists and is on display in a museum with his curved spine. It took up to six hours in makeup to transform Hurt into Merrick, but the result was as authentic as possible.

Shot in black and white on a low budget in around 14 weeks, the film was made thanks to the backing of Mel Brooks. He hadn't heard of David Lynch, but backed him after seeing a screening of Eraserhead.

The most surprising thing about The Elephant Man is how human the character is. Although his outward appearance frightened many people, he is portrayed as a gentle and eloquent man. Imagine being displayed in carnivals as a freak for the first 20 years of your life. He is punished if he doesn't ""perform"" and is treated like an annoying animal. Would you be afraid to speak or show your intelligence in such a situation? I know I would.

Merrick is discovered by Frederick Treves (Hopkins), who is a surgeon in a London hospital. His initial motivation is to display Merrick to his fellow colleagues to further his career, but he soon realizes that Merrick is a human being. One of the most interesting things about the film is how society reacts to Merrick once he has the backing of a few well-known people. Unfortunately, there are still those who wish to profit from his appearance.

The Elephant Man is one of the most emotional stories I have ever seen. I'm so glad that my tastes evolved to the point where I could see it the way it was intended. It's heartbreaking in places and you could make the argument that it's Lynch's best film (although I wouldn't agree). The cast delivers perfect performances across the board. You'll see performances from John Gielgud, Anne Bancroft, Freddie Jones, Michael Elphick and Hannah Gordon.

Lynch was relatively unknown in 1980, but he produced a film that was widely admired. Although it was poorly marketed, it received eight Oscar nominations. If you enjoy emotional stories about the human condition, you won't be disappointed.",1330473600,2,2741,4.686070686070686

248416,5,6300214044,"Roger Ebert misses the point of the movie.  It is not a film about courage; it is a film about looking.  This makes Ebert's comments about ""drawing a blank"" ironic, because his job is to look at movies, and that is, in part, what the film is about.  The movie challenges the audience to ask why it is watching a film about this disfigured man.  What the audience can expect to see is a reflection of their own motivations in the motivations of the characters.  Hopkins' character (the film's real protagonist and a stand in for the director, perhaps) questions himself in response to John Merrick.  The initially harsh head nurse reveals her true tough but loving character.  The hospital head (Gielgud) is in it for the good of the hospital.  The honest board member is cowed and forced to vote disingenuously by seeing how the Queen, of all people, looks at the situation.  The film is all about looking, not just at Merrick, but at each other, and ourselves.  The less self-reflective characters are revealed by the elephant man to be what they are as well.  Merrick is a mirror: the refined and reflective see more of themselves, both good and bad, in him and all is revealed in his presence.  The refined see the refined in him and the ugly see only the ugliness.  What does Merrick see? When shown a mirror, he screams, because his point of view is completely outward.  He seeks beauty in the world and this reveals his true character.  Those about him who seek him out to stare at his ugliness reveal their character as well.  So, what is the audience looking for?  How is it implicated in this crowd of onlookers?  What was Ebert looking for?  He assumed Merrick to be the spectacle (the protagonist) and expected a story about courage.  Hence, he came up blank. The motivations of the audience, of the director (perhaps), of the characters, including Merrick himself, are all brought to light by the effect his appearance has on everyone around him.  It is a circus, but we are all in the center ring.",1257724800,4,2010,4.589887640449438
248527,5,6300214044,"The message of this movie is the beautiful human spirit and soul that is inside John Merrick who has been displayed in side shows as The Elephant Man.  His condition, neurofibromatosis is progressive and is characterized by the growth of hard, fibrous nodules over portions of the epidermis.  They may later spread into underlying structures and interfere with other bodily processes, hindering breathing, speaking, hearing and motility of the effected parts.  It is usually not a symetrical abberation, adding to its grotesqueness, and causing imbalance.  Of course if it appears on the face it becomes quite disfiguring and startling to observers caught off guard.  In Victorian England, where John was exploited and knowledge of medicine was not in its present state, a mystery and apprehension surrounded it.  This horrible life he had to live, being feared, gawked at, examined were unbearable, but throughout the horror of his life, he was able to remain a pure and beautiful soul.  The acting by John Hurt (Merrick) is phenomonal, Anthony Hopkins is brilliant as the doctor who finally provides a kind of friendship with him, and offers him some hope of having a beneficial life, if only for the sake of science.

248528,5,6300214044,"""The Elephant Man"" is simply one of the very best movies ever made. It was made by a diverse and unexpected group of people including executive producer Mel Brooks and uber-strange director David Lynch (Eraserhead) and stars the brilliant Anthony Hopkins and John Hurt in their best film appearances ever.

The film follows the story of John Merrick (Hurt) in early twentieth century London. Merrick had been born with multiple serious deformities, and had been exploited as a sideshow attraction in a circus when he was discovered by the dedicated Doctor Frederick Treves (Hopkins,) who sought to help him and learn from him, despite much official and unofficial prejudice and dissuasion.

The film focuses on human dignity and the ability of the human spirit to overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles and ignorant prejudice and hatred from fellow human beings. I am amazed at the interactions between Hopkins and Hurt onscreen: surely this is among the best acting in any production ever. Although the movie takes certain liberties with Merrick's life story, the film still stands as a testament to both these men and what they stood for, and, more importantly, to the capability for good, love, and compassion that mankind possesses. The film has many other excellent performances from preeminent actors and actresses (John Gielgud, Anne Bancroft, etc.) but Hurt and Hopkins are the two that make this film the piece of genius that it is.

I rarely prefer black and white as a directorial choice, but in this case, the film is enhanced immeasurably by the moodiness it creates. The cinematography, direction, sets, and score are all equally breathtaking, and if you are like most people you won't move an inch for the mesmerizing duration of the film.

The DVD comes with numerous extras, including interviews, and ""making of"" segments. Certainly this was a labor of love for all involved, especially John Hurt, who had to be made up in the most difficult and time consuming manner imaginable. Their efforts were not in vain, though, as the result is one of the most important films of all time, and certainly one of the best. I absolutely could not recommend a film more highly than this one, and as I sit here, I can't think of a single one that I think is actually better than ""The Elephant Man."" Everyone should see this movie.",1242086400,5,2339,4.9440203562340965

Anthony Hopkins is superb as the dispassionate surgeon who rescues the maltreated circus freak and convincingly settles his own (and our) moral doubt as to whether he has simply replaced the morbid curiosity of the voyeuristic crowds for an equally exploitative scientific curiosity and means of personal gain. But it is John Hurt's rendition of a humanity that has refused to die that makes this film so memorable, a peerless performance that is heartbreakingly never less than utterly convincing.",1225670400,,707,5.265486725663717
248532,5,6300214044,"The film opens under the tent of a circus. The Elephant Man is the main attraction of the freak shows. A physician, Dr. Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins), passes through a menagerie of Siamese twins, strongmen, fat women, pickled abortions, etc., until he arrives at the Elephant Man's tent. Treves pays the carnival barker, Bytes (Freddie Jones), a fee for a private exhibition of the Elephant Man. Bytes leads Treves into the Elephant Man's tent. It's dark inside. The Elephant Man peeks out of the shadows. Treves is astonished.  He leases the Elephant Man from Mr. Bytes.  The Elephant Man transforms a wing of the London hospital into a freak show, and Treves is the circus barker as he catalogues the Elephant Man's deformed body. The physician waves over the reeking bags and nasty testicle-like sacs lapping out of John's back. The physician waves over the huge fibrous globes displacing John's skull; the physician waves over the swollen twisted chain of John's vertebrae.

In some, John inspires fear; in others, he inspires sympathy. His deformed body is a funhouse mirror, returning the ugliness of those who gaze at him, beat him, and exploit him. Through the first forty-five minutes of the film, John only snorts, wheezes, and growls in his mask. An ominous air surrounds him. The physician's kindness, respect, and patience win John's trust. Then, we discover that John can not only speak, but--despite the crippling distortion of his mouth--he speaks elegant English. He quotes bible scriptures. He even writes poetry. John's only possession is a picture of his beautiful deceased mother. Elephants trampled her to death when she was only twenty-one.  In John's nightmares, one of those elephants--his father--impregnates his mother.

A beautiful and sympathetic actress (Anne Bancroft) visits Merrick. Her open interest in John starts a new trend. Now, John plays the humble and frequent host to London's upper society. The hospital's head nurse, old Mrs. Mothershead--Wendy Hiller, dislikes John's growing fame. The old woman scolds Treves for making John a freak all over again. Treves is defensive--at least at the hospital, John's treated with some measure of human dignity and decency. John's not abused at the hospital as he is with Bytes, the carnival barker.

The carnival suffers in John's absence; the Elephant Man was the freak show's most popular draw. Bytes interrupts John's new life, invades the hospital, and steals back his cash cow, the Elephant Man. Bytes treats John coldly, as one would treat an unfaithful spouse. The magic was gone. The Elephant Man has become a figure of sympathy. In a drunken fit of anger, Bytes drags John out of his trailer and tosses him into a cage full of baboons. The circus's other freaks pity John. They free him from the baboon cage and spirit him out of the circus.

Traumatized, John hides his head--his face--under a sack and begins his long journey home: the hospital. He boards a train to London. At the train station, his hooded face, stooped back, and limping gait attracts a mob. They unmask him and flush him to the bowels of the station. They corner him in a restroom. Amid steampipes and rows of urinals and rusted toilets, John cries at the top of his lungs: ""I am not an animal, I am not an animal!"" The crowd dissipates, and the film moves to its final scene.

The Elephant film is a poignant straightforward film directed by David Lynch, known for eccentric films like Eraserhead, Lost Highway, Wild at Heart, and Blue Velvet. Photographer Freddie Francis shot the film in black and white, a mode that evokes the era of the story and the mystique surrounding the film's subject. All of the main actors--Anne Bancroft, Anthony Hopkins, and Wendy Hiller--performed perfectly. But the biggest star of the Elephant Man was John Hurt. How he didn't win the Oscar in 1980, I'll never know. Get a box of Kleenex and see this film.

248533,3,6300214044,"A man and the lifetime conflict of his existence and the self acception... Despite the fact it was based on a true story, something in this film recalls me the classic French novel ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"".

248534,3,6300214044,"I can cry at anything. I cry at films, reality TV shows, Neighbours *cough*, sob stories on American Idol, etc. And I've cried so much at a similar film, Mask, that I can no longer watch it. I was actually expecting to dislike this. Everyone seems to rave about it. What's to like?

For anyone who has seen this movie, the scene where the doctor (played superbly by Anthony Hopkins) takes John back to his home and introduces him to his wife - that was me. When John starts crying and says he's never been spoken to like that before by a beautiful woman, that was me for the rest of the film. I cried on and off for the rest of the movie. And was still crying when the credits rolled.

Elephant Man is based on the true story of Joseph Merrick, who was afflicted with a disfiguring disease. Some of this is similar to Mask, where Rocky (played by Eric Stoltz) is also afflicted by a similar disease. But this was in the 19th century, and little was known about this kind of thing. Because of this, Merrick is subjected to years of misery as the 'Elephant Man' in freak side shows, things that were popular on those days. There are benign tumours which grow all over his body, distorting his head, face and body, which makes him sleep sitting up or will die from suffocation.

Most of the movie is set inside the hospital, where we learn Merrick is extremely well educated, and instantly likeable. I'm still not quite sure about the beginning of the movie - where we see Merrick's mother being attacked by an elephant in the fourth month of her pregnancy. It seemed a bit tacked on to the beginning of the movie and didn't really work.

There are a few familiar faces in this - fans of UK TV show Hotel Babylon look out for Dexter Fletcher, he's appeared in films too, but that's how I know him. Fans of Anne Of Green Gables (!), look out for Wendy Hiller, playing the main nurse. She was Mrs. Harris in the sequel. There's probably others too, but those are the ones I know.

Unfortunately, I really don't see this as the kind of the movie I will ever watch again. It's just too upsetting, although I know people I've spoken to, disagree with that, and watch it over and over. It just had to much of an effect on me. Otherwise it's a really brilliant movie, with similarities to Mask, but in black and white, and outstanding performances.",1220918400,6,2338,4.377880184331797
248535,5,6300214044,"It's hard for me to formulate with mere words the impact this film has had on me.  `The Elephant Man' is so much more than a weepy drama about injustice, but in the end it becomes an overwhelming testament to the rarity of genuine kindness, and this is what serves as the catalyst for my falling tears.  David Lynch's masterpiece captures the audience, sinking every claw and tooth into the heartstrings of the viewer and relentlessly tearing it to shreds, but it does so with such graceful subtlety you barely realize you're being emotionally manipulated.  Some have balked at the idea that `The Elephant Man' does just that; manipulates the audience's emotions; but in my humble opinion I feel that that manipulation is necessary.  As a warm-blooded human being none of us want to accept the worst parts of us, and so it becomes vital for directors like Lynch to coax that realization out of us.

What makes `The Elephant Man' and the more heartbreaking is the fact that it is based on actual events, and so the audience is forced to realize that this is no mere work of fiction but an accurate portrayal of what man is capable of.  Not even in your worst of nightmares could you make something like this up.

The film tragically retells the story of John Merrick (whose actual name was Joseph Merrick), a man who, while possessing a beautiful soul, was cursed with a horrendous disfigurement that hindered him from ever being embraced by the `normal' people around him.  Paraded around as nothing more than a sideshow freak, an animal even, John's life has been reduced to slavery at the hands of Bytes, a ruthless and harsh sideshow entertainer.  Then his life is suddenly, and drastically, changed when he is discovered by Doctor Frederick Treves and ushered away from his cruel world and into the warm arms of the hospital.

It's within those small moments of acceptance that the audience can find the most emotional connectivity to the film.  Sure, the scenes of unjust violence and mistreatment are bound to well up within us feelings of pain and sadness and overwhelming hopelessness, but it's the gestures of genuine kindness that carries the most weight.  I remember in particular a moment when Doctor Treves introduces John to his wife Anne.  The moment is so subtle, so tender and pure.  It touched me in the most passionate of ways because it confronted a basic need for acceptance, a need that most humans take for granted.

`The Elephant Man' marvelously contradicts those moments of kindness with harsh depictions of hatred and ignorance as John is mistreated by those willing to use and abuse him for their own amusement.  David Lynch is able to capture the best and worst sides of human nature so vividly and fearlessly, never simplifying or downplaying anything but keeping true to an honest depiction of humanity.

What helps elevate this film is the brilliant performances by the entire cast.  John Hurt is just incredibly moving as John Merrick, captivating the audience with just the glimmer of sincerity in his eyes.  While I can't deny that Robert De Niro's Oscar winning performance in `Raging Bull' was glorious and deserved of the Oscar I can't help but wish it would have been yet another Hepburn/Streisand moment and we could have seen both De Niro and Hurt walk away with a little golden man.  Anthony Hopkins also delivers an outstanding yet often overlooked performance as Frederick Treves.  Sadly his performance takes a backseat to Hurt's, but when one looks deep into the control and dedication in which Hopkins uses to deliver this performance once can't help but become outraged at his lack of awards attention.  He compliments Hurt beautifully and it is ultimately his act of kindness that stands as the pivotal message this entire film and its emotional connectivity hinges upon.  Anne Bancroft is also memorable as the famed theater actress Mrs. Kendall and Hannah Gordon's scene with John Hurt is so emotionally wrecking I have to single her out as extraordinary here.  Even Freddie Jones captivates, despite his unarguable despicability.

Across the board `The Elephant Man' delivers effortlessly.  It is beautifully shot in rich black and white, adding layers to the rawness of the subject.  David Lynch, who is nothing short of a phenomenal and visionary director, manages to infuse so much honesty into this film I just can't help but become a part of it.  In all fairness, 1980 was a very strong year and it sports one of the greatest Best Picture lineups in the history of Oscar.  `Ordinary People' is a very well made film and is one that I enjoy immensely, but it did not deserve that Best Picture Oscar.  The film, since its win, has garnered a bad rap for `stealing' `Raging Bull's Oscar, but in my humble opinion that Best Picture Oscar rightfully belongs to `The Elephant Man', a superb masterpiece of cinema.

This is the type of film that roots itself in the heart of the audience and resides forever within it.  It is a film that will force you to recognize the evil within ignorance but it will also force you to embrace and appreciate the rare moments of warmth and kindness.  The other day someone said to me that they only wished we could remember the good things people do.  I think that in the end that's what this film does for me.  It helps me to realize that there are good people trapped in this world of injustice and hatred.  Sadly that kindness is such a rarity, such a lost treasure that one is blessed if ever he were to find it.  Lynch beautifully makes that clear in what proves to be a film filled with conflicting emotions; feelings of sorrow, pain, misery and fear as well as hope, happiness, love and admiration.  No matter which way to look at it, `The Elephant Man' is an alarming story of humanity in its truest form.",1209686400,7,5799,4.750499001996008

248597,5,6300214044,"Based on the true life of Joseph Carey Merrick (portrayed brilliantly by John Hurt), David Lynch's masterpiece more or less accurately portrays his experiences only in the last year of his life in 1889-90 once Doctor Frederick Treves (played by Anthony Hopkins) encounters him and cares for him at Whitechapel Hospital. Because of the stage play which left Merrick's physical appearance to the viewer's imagination, this film tended to be voted inferior in comparison. Being fair though, this is a very good film and an unforgettable one at that.

In arguably David Lynch's most conventional shoot, there are a couple of misleading events. The film explains Merrick's condition as the result of his mother being struck down by an elephant. He was actually born a normal child. Before the age of two, he had began growing the tumors, and his condition rapidly worsened. Believed to have Proteus Syndrome or ""Elephant Man's Disease"" which causes abnormal, unchecked growth of bones, skin, and other systems, the name came to be identified with him. Also, not revealed in the film are what happened to his parents. Research revealed that his mother, also handicapped died when Merrick was 11. His father remarried, and his new wife gave gave him an ultimatum, ""Joseph, or me."" Abandoned and cast out of the home, he went to live at the Leicester Union Workhouse, and sold shoe polish on the street. After being taunted repeatedly by other children, he had to find other work.

Desperate for medical attention, a compassionate showman, Tom Norman, UK's answer to P.T. Barnum took him in and gave Merrick a job as a museum freak. Under Norman's tutelage, Merrick accumulated 200 pounds, a large sum of money at the time. However, while touring Belgium, Merrick became separated from his guardian. Naive and sickly, he was a perfect target for robbers, and an unscrupulous Austrian (some say Italian) showman tricked him out of his small fortune. This more than likely was the character portrayed by Freddie Jones in the film.

Although those facts were not mentioned in the film, this is nevertheless very accurate. Merrick's association with the upper class, the journey to the theater, his befriending of a famous stage actress, his creativity, and intelligence, and even Merrick's death in the film was portrayed to the tee, based on the earlier reports of Dr. Treves.

The DVD has nice documentaries on the making of the film, interviews with the actors, director, and Mel Brooks (who interestingly was the executive producer), and the trailer as features. Overall, an excellent film that is highly recommended.",1208649600,,2610,5.062790697674418

John Hurt - surely one of the greatest actors ever - gives a performance of a lifetime, and shows what great acting is all about.

Its such a wonderul role that I literally had to cry. Anothony Hopkins, as the man who be-friended and helped John Hurt gives a subtle, yet perfect performance. You can tell he really cared.

You really barely notice it once you're engaged with the story. And what a depressing story it is. I was wide awake at 2 in the morning completely in tears from this film. It should not be missed.

248600,5,6300214044,"David Lynch's finest film, alongside with perhaps Mulholland Drive. John Hurt, under tons of makeup, stars as David Merrick, the real-life grotesquely deformed individual of Victorian England that was better known as The Elephant Man. Merrick is the virtual slave of a brutish man (a great performance of Freddie Jones) that parades him as a carnival freak until he is rescued by the sensitive doctor Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins). Treves decides to put Merrick in a hospital room, winning over the initial skepticism of its director, John Gielgud. In the hospital, Merrick will start to talk for the first time, begin to regain his dignity, and eventually will become a curiosity of high society before his premature death. Shot in a delicate and expressionist black and white, the only flaw in the movie might be the performance of Ann Bancroft (producer Mel Brooks's wife) as a stage actress interested in Merrick's life. Except for the surreal opening and closing scenes (in which Merrick is born and dies, respectively), here Lynch is relatively restrained, opting for a style that could be called poetic realism. The film earned eight Oscar nominations in all, but left that race empty-handed, an earlier indication that Lynch's films would not be the typical Academy material.",1201305600,,1288,5.167464114832536

Interesting fact is that Anthony Hopkins was given the role of Hannibal Lector(Silence Of The Lambs)after the director saw his portrayal of the good sympathetic doctor in this film. I have seen this film many times, but it requires time in between viewings for recovery.

248689,5,6300214044,"David Lynch is quite possibly the most underappreciated director in cinematic history.  Time and time again he has crafted baffling, fascinatingly intricate works of art that time and time again have been shunned by critics too small-minded to appreciate the beauty of Lynch's films.  Still, there is one that was universally acknowledged as the masterwork it is: THE ELEPHANT MAN, Lynch's finest work.  In 1979, impressed by Lynch's horrifying debut ERASERHEAD, Mel Brooks hired Lynch to direct a cinematic telling of the tale of Joseph Merrick, frequently mistakenly referred to as ""John"", a mistake repeated in this film.  With only one prior film under his belt, David Lynch crafted a masterpiece that ranks among the very finest films ever made, as well as the single most moving thing I have ever seen.

Anthony Hopkins portrays Dr. Frederick Treves, a young and ambitious surgeon at the London Hospital who hears talk of a hideously deformed man being showcased at a local freakshow as ""The Elephant Man"".  Recognizing a potential subject for fascinating research, Treves takes the man from his horridly-abusive ""business partner"" (Freddie Jones) and places him the London Hospital.  Though the hospital staff is, naturally, initially opposed to the idea (do we not fear what we do not understand?), they gradually warm to the ""Elephant Man"" when Treves discovers, to everyone's immense shock, that the man is in fact a very intelligent and polite 21-year-old Englishman named John Merrick (John Hurt).  Treves and Merrick become close friends while Treves studies Merrick's terrible disease, but though the public comes to see Merrick as a sort of hero, there are still those all too willing to treat him as a freak.

THE ELEPHANT MAN is one of the few cinematic masterpieces with a story as captivating as the film itself.  The story is very historially accurate, as is the makeup for John Merrick.  No doubt this is a major reason of why THE ELEPHANT MAN is so profoundly tragic a film - it all happened.  It's all real.  Angry mobs did chase that poor, kind soul, and sleazy, utterly despicable rats of men did exploit his misfortune for their own profit.  He was abused, and ridiculed, and yet through it all he remained upbeat, and a heartbreakingly intelligent and polite young man.  Though his face is hidden beneath layer upon layer of makeup, John Hurt's performance as Merrick is excellent, and though ""wonderful"" would be a fitting adjective, it just doesn't seem right for this circumstance.

Anthony Hopkins delivers what may the finest performance of his career, possibly surpassed only by his legendary performance as Hannibal Lecter in Demme's THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  His character is admirably set on doing what's right and touchingly and sincerely caring for Mr. Merrick.  In the scene in which Hopkins first encounters Merrick in a basement, he looks absolutely heartbroken and sheds one single, streaming tear; this may very well be one of the greatest scenes in movie history.

Heading up the supporting cast is Anne Bancroft, playing a beautiful actress who immediately befriends Merrick.  A testament to the movie's power is that we feel like we know these characters, particularly Bancroft.  We do not root for her character; we appreciate and are grateful for her kind attitude toward Mr. Merrick.

As wonderful as the actors are, this film could simply not exist without the masterful directing of David Lynch.  Though this is one of his more linear works, it is still distinctly Lynchian, from the surreal opening sequence to the marvelously poetic finish.  Those who were bold enough to endure ERASERHEAD may notice that THE ELEPHANT MAN feels like a sort of companion piece to that film.  Both films were shot in a sort of nightmarish black-and-white, both films feature an enhanced soundtrack highlighting the sound of the wind whisping and mechanical clunks in the background, and both films highlight industrial settings and workers.  Lynch's attention to every single detail, no matter how seemingly unimportant or simple, his appreciation for every little thing in life, is a perfect fit for this film.  Though he may have made films more fascinating or deep, David Lynch never made one finer than THE ELEPHANT MAN, his own gothic, romantic tragedy.

Another aspect that will remain in viewers' minds well after the film's end is Samuel Barber's ""Adagio for Strings"", one of the most provoking and sorrowfully beautiful pieces of music I have ever heard, which was similarly used six years later in Oliver Stone's PLATOON.  ""Adagio"" is the song that plays through the film's final moments, and it is the ultimate opus for John Merrick.  I guarantee that after seeing this film, your eyes will tear whenever ""Adagio for Strings"" is played.

Though it will always be one of film's great tragedies that David Lynch never receives the praise he so rightly deserves, it is fitting that at least one of his films, Lynch's own handmade tragedy, received the attention it deserved.  Although the film was (unsurprisingly) unrecognized in the 1981 Academy Awards, THE ELEPHANT MAN has come to be regarded as one of the finest films ever made.  It is indeed one of the all-time great cinematic masterpieces, and Lynch's masterwork.  I doubt that I will ever encounter anything that will move me so profoundly as Joseph Merrick and David Lynch's tale of THE ELEPHANT MAN.",1173312000,9,5405,5.035955056179775

248692,5,6300214044,"The elephant man is a fictionalized movie about the life of a man named John Merrick (Joseph Carey Merrick was actually his real name) who lived in the 19th century and suffered from a disfiguring disease which limited him to career working as a circus side show entertainer.

It was originally thought Merrick's disease was either neurofibromatosis or elephantiasis.  Generally speaking, Neurofibromatosis is a genetic condition that affects the skin, bones, muscles, and the central nervous system.  Elephantiasis which is also known as Lymphatic Filariasis, is a disease, often found in tropical countries, in which parts of the human body become enlarged. It is caused by small roundworms that are injected into the body by mosquitoes.

However, around the time the film came out, it was suggested that Merrick had Proteus syndrome or ""Elephant Man's Disease"", which causes abnormal, unchecked growth of skeletal, dermatological, and other bodily systems.  Clinical experts seem now to aggree that Merrick suffered from Proteus syndrome.  Proteus syndrome also demonstrates great clinical variability meaning it is not constant in its expression and fewer than 100 cases of Proteus have ever been recorded.

The story is moving and the performances delivered by John Hurt in the role of the Elephant Man and Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Frederick Treves, are spectacular.  I was touched by the manner in which director David Lynch conveys the message that ""all humans matter.""  This film also features
fine and dignified performances by Anne Bancroft and John Gielgud. Freddie Jones is brilliant in the part of Bytes and in one line immortalizes the movie when he refers to Merrick in the possessive as ""my treasure.""  The words uttered by Bytes are reminscent of Tolkiens Golem who when refering to the ring of power used ""my precious"" to signify his unhealthy attachment.

For those of you that have read about the real life of Joseph Merrick, you will notice that Hollywood used their creative liberties in creating an interesting, though fictionalized black and white version of the real story.

So when your girlfriend becomes upset and starts to cry at the end of the film, you can comfort her and let her know that in reality it was not that way.  You can explain that no one enslaved Merrick and that it was in fact Merrick who actively sought out a career in the circus pitching himself to Sam Torr, a compassionate man and small time showman portrayed in the movie as Merrick's unscrupulous exploiter Bytes.  Instead of possessing Merrick for personal gain, Torr facilitated a meeting for Merrick to meet Tom Norman the P.T. Barnum of Victorian England.  Ultimately, it was Tom Norman who generously paid for the many surgeries Merrick would require and helped Merrick become successful in the circus business.

The portrayal of Joseph Carey Merrick's death however was accurate.  Joseph Carey Merrick died of asphyxiation when attempting lie down like a normal person might.  When he did, the weight of the tumors on his head and neck had crushed his trachea.  It is not clear if he committed suicide, but you can judge for yourself.

248695,5,6300214044,"The tragic true story of John Merrick is the basis for this moving and touching film starring John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins.  Shot in black & white, `The Elephant Man' never loses a single strand of authenticity or emotional weight in its production but continues to strike a chord with the viewer with every watch.  What's so important about films like this one is that it exposes the hypocrisy and audacity of most people today, the complete disregard for the welfare of others and that fear of anything we don't understand.

John Merrick (John Hurt) was born with a horrifically disfiguring disease that made him a social outcast.  When he was found by Doctor Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) John was being paraded about by circus sideshow entertainer Bytes (Freddie Jones), living as a freak to society, as an animal for other peoples amusement.  John lived his entire life up to that point as an unwanted and unloved creature, not as a human being.  His feelings, his interests and the mere fact that he was an intelligent member of society went completely ignored by everyone around him.  That was until he was taken in by the hospital Treves worked for.

Although at first a bit reluctant, the majority of the staff at the hospital begin to take to John, and for the first time in his life he has people noticing more than just his face.  But along with the good comes some more of the bad as some of the staff still decide to profit off of John's misfortunes, tormenting him night after night.  What's so incredibly disheartening is the truth this film makes very clear.  Towards the end of the film I found myself crying, not because of the horrible way he was treated but because of the kindness bestowed upon him.  It made me realize that I was crying because that kindness is such a rarity these days and that is a sad realization.

With solid performances by the entire cast, most notably John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins, but also by Anne Bancroft who plays a famed theater actress by the name of Mrs. Kendall who takes a liking to John as well as Hannah Gordon who plays Anne, Frederick's wife.  Her acceptance of John is both heartwarming and heartbreaking.  This is surly a film that should not be missed, a film that should be on everyone's list of most important and inspirational films of all time.  If we could all just learn to accept those around us for who they are on the inside, then, just then maybe...but even that doesn't look promising.",1165276800,,2466,4.621559633027523

248786,5,6300214044,"David Lynch isn't known for making tender, emotional-moving films about compassion, dignity, and the importance of life.  Lynch is better known for making films seeped in a bizarre Salvador Dali-type surrealism full of violence and sex.  Mel Brooks isn't known for producing high class, ground breaking dramas that are nominated for Academy Awards.  The idea of putting these two filmmakers working together on a serious movie seems almost absurd.  But it happened and the collaboration between the two, THE ELEPHANT MAN, turned out one of the most powerful, elegant, and moving pictures of the 1980s.

I was probably in kindergarten or first grade the first time I saw THE ELEPHANT MAN.  I cried when watching the film and thought that because of the ending it was very sad.  I also thought that the film was a really old film because it was filmed in black and white.  It wasn't until I recently watched the film again that I discovered the movie isn't all that old and was released in 1980.  After watching it again, I also found that it wasn't as sad, either, because the John Merrick died with dignity and not a creature cast off from the world.

THE ELEPHANT MAN is about the life of Joseph Merrick (though his name has been changed to John in the film), a horribly disfigured man (he suffered from probably both Neuro Fibromatosis and Proteus Syndrome) who grew up in freak shows and carnivals until he was discovered and rescued by Dr. Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) one of the chief physicians at the Royal London Hospital.  At first the attendants and other employees at the hospital treat John (John Hurt) with horror and disgust, but as Treves works with him and uncovers the human being beneath the physical deformity the staff come to love John as a member of their own family.  Soon John becomes a London celebrity and is visited by the elite and powerful of society and becomes a favored acquaintance of the Queen herself.  But there are those in Merrick's past who are envious of his success and hate him for it--they do not view him as a man, but only as a freak to make a profit from.  It is a message that Merrick has had beaten into him most of his life and he must come to grips with it and realize himself that he is a man regardless of the shape or color of his skin.

John Hurt is uncanny as John Merrick.  He played the man at a time when it most actors in Hollywood were afraid of playing any role in which their face could not be seen.  Also, at a time when most actors couldn't imagine sitting longer than half and hour in a make up chair, Hurt endured a twelve hour make-up session each day to be physically transformed into Merrick.  It was the incredible makeup in this film that led to the creation of a Best Makeup Oscar in 1982.  Even today's era when nearly half of all special effects and makeup are created through CGI, Christopher Tucker's makeup job is most impressive.  Of course, none of it wouldn't have mattered if Hurt hadn't been beneath.  Hurt gave the portrayal of Merrick his soul.  He should have won an Oscar, but didn't.

Anthony Hopkins delivers one of his most touching film roles as Dr. Treves, the man who ""saved"" the Elephant Man only to find himself being ""saved"" by the man he rescued from destitution.  Hopkins has played numerous memorable roles since THE ELEPHANT MAN, but his role as Dr. Frederick Treves remains as one of my favorite Hopkin's performances.  Other notables in the cast include Sir John Gielgud as Carr Gomm, Treves supervisor and Anne Bancroft as the lovely actress Mrs. Kendal.

There are no cheesy lines are maudlin moments in THE ELEPHANT.  Part of that is because the film's writers based the script upon the real Dr. Treves' writings about Joseph Merrick.  Imaginary characters were created and certain situations were slightly fudged for dramatic effect, but overall the film's script is on the money.  Not a line or moment is wasted.

Some of that might have been because the movie was filmed in stock black and white film, an incredibly expensive process at the time.  Studio execs questioned the idea at the time, knowing that it would be cheaper to shoot in color and then delete the color from the film, but Lynch and Brooks were adamant on shooting in black and white and in the end the investment was the right choice.  The black and white movie that made me think it was an ""old movie"" when I was a child gives the film a certain amount of style and charm that even most period pieces lack nowadays.

As for David Lynch, since the time of THE ELEPHANT MAN he has gone on to direct and create a host of bizarre and strange projects from BLUE VELVET to TWIN PEAKS.  Lynch has a very unique style of filmmaking and much of it transcends the border of normalcy into the realm of perverted surrealism.  Not everyone can appreciate Lynch.  There are tiny moments of this surrealism in THE ELEPHANT MAN, such as the scenes with the elephants and the lady writhing on the ground.  However, THE ELEPHANT MAN is Lynch's most commercially viable film.  It is a movie that appeals to people of all ages, whether they are a child of five or an elder of eighty.  Cinematically speaking, it's even more because even though Lynch has gone on to set new boundaries and try experimental things, THE ELEPHANT MAN is his magnum opus.  It's a movie that I think everyone should see at least once in their life.

The DVD includes the theatrical trailer, a retrospective with some of the cast and crew (mainly Hurt and Brooks), an interview with make-up artist Christopher Tucker, and a narrated photo gallery with Christopher Tucker.",1160092800,7,5609,4.60261569416499
248787,5,6300214044,"David Lynch's THE ELEPHANT MAN (1980) is based (with some fictionalization) on the life story of Joseph ""John"" Merrick, an Englishman who was called the Elephant Man because of the grotesque, congenital deformities of his body and face.  Shot in black and white, THE ELEPHANT MAN opens with homage to another film classic set in Victorian England, David Lean's OLIVER TWIST (1948).  In that film, Oliver's mother struggles through a violent storm before giving birth at a workhouse.  In this film, John's mother is knocked down during pregnancy by an elephant (one of a touring menagerie).  Then a baby's cry is heard:  like little Oliver Twist, young John Merrick enters a world of hardship - made all the worse by the hideous disfigurement which will force him to work as a sideshow freak.
Next, we meet Dr. Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins), a London surgeon who takes an interest in Merrick's fate after seeing him on display at a local freak show.  Treves pays the Elephant Man's cruel manager, Mr. Bytes, to give him over to the care of the Royal London Hospital.  At first, the deformity of Merrick's mouth, and his extreme shyness and fear, cause Treves to think him ""an imbecile""; all he can do is grunt and groan or keep silent.  But in a stunning scene Merrick is overheard reciting his favorite Psalm; Treves and his colleagues realize that they are in fact caring for a man of uncommon intelligence, sensitivity, and refinement.  Soon, ""Mr. Merrick"" is set up in his own hospital suite, given elegant, gentleman's clothing, and introduced to London ""Society.""  He gains poise and shows his innate gentleness more and more.  He has tea with lords and ladies and finds a kindred spirit in Mrs. Madge Kendal (Anne Bancroft), an actress.  Yet all the time his past threatens to overtake him, in the form of old associates who lurk about, hoping to kidnap back their profitable ""freak"" attraction.  And also there is the nagging question, put by Treves himself, as to whether the drawing room is not merely a more respectable form of the sideshow, with Merrick ""on display"" before those of his visitors who come only to gape at him.
It has been suggested that the movie's Treves was conceived as an opportunist, more interested in career advancement than in humanitarianism.  But this view is at odds with Hopkins' sympathetic portrayal.  A moment early in the film sets the tone:  as Treves has his first look at the Elephant Man at the freak show, a tear slips from his eye at the sight of such degradation.  Empathy is shown also by John Gielgud as hospital chairman F.C. Carr Gomm:  his is a warm, reassuring presence, and the characterization is not without (welcome) humor.  The Elephant Man's other supporters include his nurse (a prickly but good-hearted Wendy Hiller) and Treves' wife, with whom he has a most touching teatime conversation.  In short, Merrick's new friends may not be perfect, but they are humane, unlike those old ""friends"" who would purposely humiliate him.  (Just watch, if you can bear to, their truly ugly mockery of him before they spirit him away from the hospital.)
John Hurt as John Merrick exudes spiritual beauty.  Just as surely as that refined English voice emanates from that twisted mouth, his kindness and gentleness make the viewer, in time, nearly forget his appearance, initially so shocking.  When one watches Hurt in THE ELEPHANT MAN, one feels as though one is watching the real-life Mr. Merrick (who by all accounts had the same genteel qualities).  Higher praise can scarcely be possible.
The film's sense of atmosphere is superb, its London a steamy, grimy, crowded place; constant whirring and clanking sounds remind us that this is the 1880's, the Industrial Revolution (which was itself dehumanizing).  Countless moments haunt the memory long after the film ends - Treves' appalled look and falling tear when he first sees Merrick; Byte's boy's imitation of his master's harsh commands; Merrick's comforting of Mrs. Treves (""Oh, please...Oh, please..."") when she breaks down in his presence, and his almost musical exclamations of joy over kindnesses shown him; the terrible scene in which Merrick is cornered by a mob in a train station (quite the equal in dramatic impact of ""Cortigiani, vil razza dannata,"" the deformed jester's scene before the jeering courtiers in Verdi's opera RIGOLETTO); his magical first (and last) visit to the theatre - but none so much as Merrick's transcendent death scene, accompanied by Samuel Barber's elegiac ""Adagio for Strings"" (the rest of the film's score is by John Morris and is close to the Barber in style and orchestration).  ""Beautiful"" is the word for this scene, and for Hurt's whole performance.",1153353600,4,4705,4.961783439490445
248788,5,6300214044,"The Elephant Man is the true story of John Merrick who suffered from degenerative genetic diseases that deformed most of his body.  Merrick was a side show freak call the Elephant Man.  One night he is discovered by Dr. Frederick Treves.  Treves decided to make his pet project.  What Treves did not expect is Merrick's ability to assimilate information.

Soon Merrick becomes the toast of British Society but the hospital did not like the publicity.  In a great scene the Queen's sister comes to the hospital and forces the board to accept Merrick as a resident.

But Merrick's ""owner"" is not happy about losing his cash cow and kidnaps Merrick and takes him to the continent.  With some help, Merrick escapes back to London.  Though he is a society darling, the common man is not so welcoming.  This leads to the famous ""I am not an animal, I am a man"" scene.

In the end, Merrick cannot cope with his dual role in society and just wants to be normal.

John Hurt gives a stunning performance as Merrick.  He captures his torment and gives him dimensions under layers of make-up.  Hopkins was not a major star yet but this film shows his future abilities.  Rounding out the cast is Anne Bancroft as the actress who takes an interest in Merrick, John Gielguld as head of the hospital and Wendy Hiller as the head nurse.

This film propelled David Lynch into the forefront of the new wave of directors of the 80's.

I'm put off by the numerous comments complaining about the lack of chapter stops, though. Lynch has chosen not to put them on any of his films that have been released on DVD, and for a very valid reason, I think - he states that he wants viewers to experience the film in its entirety, as he intended and assembled it, without breaks or interuptions. A fair opinion, it seems.

For those who complain: do you resent the lack of chapter stops when you go to the movie theatre? Or, perhaps, do you just start conversing anyway, even though you can't pause the action?",1150243200,,690,4.433070866141732
248791,5,6300214044,"Now, i'm no stranger to shocking and creepy/haunting films. Having seen all of Lynch's AWESOME films, i knew that after the incrfedible reviews that this got, i had to see it. Well, this is a movie that will leave you sitting for half an hour, reflecting on life and human emotions.

I have seen some of the overall saddest/most violent/haunting films that there is to see, and this takes the cake. THIS IS NOT A TEAR-JERKER. To me, the meaning of a 'tear-jerker' is a movie that makes you weep because something bad happened, this is sort of the same, but it's also miles away.

I cried after seeing this film. I'm not afraid to admit it, because i would think that anyone who did not, or at least feel deeply moved, had something wrong with them.

During the film, there were several moments when i felt an incredible warmth. Something like a desire to help people as unfortunate as Joseph Merrick. I also was severely creeped out by  scenes like when Treves first sees the elephant man, in a dark and filthy rock dungeon, lit by candle-light. That is one of the best scenes ever made.

This film is really something that you want to share with someone special. Filmed in beutiful black-andwhite that brings out the true feeling of the film, and also creates a sense of the era.

David Lynch is certainly, with no doubt in my mind, one of the greatest directors of all time. This is largely due to his astonishing ability to bring out the deepest of emotions. Joseph Merrick was such a beutiful person, and it does really crush your heart when you see the ugliness of man, how he is treated because he looks different. But, it is not a film about judging a book by it's cover. It is simply about the darkness in man, the deepest of emotions, and the beauty of life. It really is an incredible mix. In this film, you feel emotions that are as strong as any you will ever feel in real life.

This is THE greatest film of all time. I strongly, strongly, advise anyone to see it. It is a cut above the rest of modern film making, and there is, quite plainly, no other film like it.",1149379200,3,2079,4.384415584415584
248792,5,6300214044,"Allow me to start out by saying that I hate biopic-type movies. They usually tend to be formulaic and trite, and they often either reduce extraordinary lives into ordinary ones, or take such liberties with the truth that they cease to have any meaning. The Elephant Man is, though, a glorious exception. Filmed in black and white with the visual flair that only comes from a visionary director (in this case, David Lynch), The Elephant Man is the story of John Merrick, a man whose horrible disfigurement has left him unable to live a normal live, to exist in society, or even to make a living--he has to be paraded as a freak in order to survive. He is eventually discovered by Frederick Treves, a London doctor who is interested in John's medical case. Treves eventually finds John to be an intelligent and sensitive man, and while Merrick begins to find acceptance among the hospital staff and London society, Treves struggles with his own guilt about using John to elevate his own career. It is the journeys that the two men take which form the backbone of this film, which includes more than a few genuinely touching moments. John Hurt, previously best known for being the ill-fated incubator for the alien in Alien, delivers one of the most astonishing performances in film history here--he becomes this man, down to the body language, speech, and subtext--there is little suspension of disbelief required here. Anthony Hopkins plays Treves with quiet dignity and humanity, showing again why he is one of his generation's greatest actors. Plaudits also go to John Gielgud as the hospital governor and Anne Bancroft as a sympathetic London stage actress who champion's Merrick's cause.

Unlike most biopics, this one actually shows the struggles and triumphs of its character. Merrick desires nothing more than what should be his birthright--a normal life. Ultimately, this is impossible. He nevertheless manages to find happiness--and even joy--thanks to the kindness of Treves and his staff. That he was able to achieve even this modest goal, in spite of his massive physical ailments and disfigurement, is something which is truly inspiring. If the society we live in is one which is excessively preoccupied with appearances, then The Elephant Man is a film which offers an impassioned rebuttal against such thinking, and even though it is very sad, it is ultimately uplifting in that it provides an example of the triumph of the human spirit, at risk of spouting cliche. It follows some of the genre conventions, but it all seems fresh and interesting, like a work of literature, not a dime-store potboiler.

This film should have won several Oscars but didn't win a single one. It is interesting to note that the year in which this film was produced, 1980, was also the year of Raging Bull and Ordinary People, which makes three modern classics made in a single year. Has there been a similar situation in the last decade? Ultimately, these movies were the end of an era, the glorious cinema of the 1970s, where authenticity and truth were the watchwords of film. This is a movie which doesn't try to sugar-coat the story of its subject, but lets the subject speak for himself, and thusly becomes an extraordinary picture.",1148083200,6,3232,4.917582417582418

John Hurt gives a outstanding performance as John Merrick, the poor disfigured and deformed man whom they called the elephant man. Anthony Hopkins gives us a great performance in this movie also. With great makeup effects and a great cast and touching story, this film will always remain a film that I think no one can forget. It is truly sad, especially because this is a true story. Your  heart goes out to Merrick for having to live the life he was given. He truly had a kind heart but was constantly taunted and picked at and even used as a freak at a side show. Yet he was a very smart man. This film shows how cruel some people can be to someone who is ""different"". What they failed to do is see the true man behind the deformities. ""  I am not an animal, I'm a man"". Well said Merrick. Unfortunately Merrick died in his late twenties. His one dream was to be able to lay down in bed and sleep  like a ""normal"" person. Something we all take forgranted sometimes. Merrick had to sleep sitting up b/c of his condition. It is said that he knew when laying down in a normal position that he would die from suffication but he did so anyway. Suffication was the cause of death for Merrick.... from lying down on his back. Maybe Merrick decided  he had enough of the cruel world he was seeing. Regardless, at least he died doing something he wanted to do most..... be normal. Great, touching movie.

  Personally I thought COAL MINER'S DAUGHTER was OK but found RAGING BULL to be crude and offensive (although in it's sincerity an excellent picture.)
  Best Actor went to Robert De Niro for RAGING BULL but John Hurt actually was THE actor of 1980.  His portrail of John Merrick was a great moment in Cinematic History.  Robert De Niro gained a bunch of pounds for the part and was loud and obnoxious and did a great job of it for saying ""F**K"" but for pure emotional acting ability John Hurt beat De Niro hands down. ""I AM A HUMAN BEING""  (Jack Nicholson was NOT nominated for his part as Jack Torrance in ""THE SHINING"")
  Anthony Hopkins was NOT nominated for Best Supporting Actor and Joe Pesci won this award for RAGING BULL.  This is a crime.
  Best Director went to Robert Redford for ORDINARY PEOPLE.  David Lynch, , Roman Polanski and Richard Rush were also nominated along with Martin Scorsese (sorry for the previous mis-informed info on the Best Director winner)
  Best Supporting Actress went to Mary Steenburgen for MELVIN AND HOWARD but what happened to Anne Bancroft?  No nomination for an incredible job which went (even though I really liked Mary Steenburgen) WAY beyond as far as an ACTING performance.
  In a world where these discrepancies exist STAR WARS was second to ANNIE HALL for cripes sakes.  How many times have you seen ANNIE HALL ???  How many times have you seen STAR WARS ??

I had only seen ELEPHANT MAN on television and it was many years ago.  Since then, I've developed the opinion that LOST HIGHWAY is the best thing Lynch has ever made.  Now, having viewed this excellent DVD of ELEPHANT MAN, I may have to change my tune.  I do believe this film is Lynch's best work.

ELEPHANT MAN combines Lynch's quirky art-film attitude with a dramatic and heartwarming drama.  There's the art side - bizarre subject matter, odd editing, and beautiful cinematography - that only certain movie-viewers can appreciate.  But there is also a well-written and brilliantly executed human drama (brought to life by outstanding performances) that almost any viewer will appreciate.

248924,4,6300214044,"Read all my reviews at [...]

David Lynch's second full length film contains the odd assortment of freakish characters we've become accustomed to in his film. Yet, despite one of the more outlandish characters he has ever put on celluloid, it remains his most sentimental.

The Elephant Man is based upon the true story of John Merrick, a 19th century Englishman with massive deformities throughout his body. He performed in freakshows for many years until he was found by Dr. Treves who cared for him and placed him in Whitechapel hospital. It is his time in this hospital that the film concerns itself with. For here, Merrick is able to life, more or less, as a gentleman. He is well fed, well kept, and educated. He can read, write, speak eloquently and even begins to entertain well-to-dos of society.

It is filmed beautifully in black and white. It is a very well made piece of cinema. Lynch, for the most part, stays away from his trade mark imagery and symbolism, and sticks to more traditional story telling, although the elephant involving opening sequence is straight Lynch nightmare. That the characters come from real life and not Lynch's twisted imagination only serve to add to the surrealism of the film.

It has been said that Lynch is too sentimental in this movie. That he manipulates the audience too much. Ebert even goes as far as saying Lynch tricks the audience into believing that Merrick is a noble and courageous man. He suggests, that rather than being noble, Merrick is merely doing the best that he can, under poor circumstances. It is true that the film is sentimental. There is hardly a scene that does not prick the audiences emotions. Yet how can an audience not feel emotion when they see a kind, intelligent man live with such deformities. How many of us would dare to get out of bed each day with similar atrocities. And here, this man, though physically plagued, manages to keep up his spirits and even write and build card sculptures. It would be a poor director at that who could not produce a tear at such a sight. If we pretend it is not a noble feat for such a creature to retain his humanity and good cheer, while being constantly bombarded with inhumane indecencies are we any better than those who stand outside the carnival and jeer?

Yet there is something in these critiques of sentimentalism. Lynch continues to use his tricks as a director to keep our eyes wet. There is a scene in which Merrick meets Dr. Treve's wife and breaks down with tears at her simple kind acts. His tears state that no one has been so kind to him as to treat him like a gentleman. Though effective, this is using the craft of filmmaking to do nothing but manipulate emotions. In other films I would lambaste this type of sentimentalism and chastise the audience for falling for it. Yet the overall sadness throughout the story makes me fall for it here. I cannot commend such use of it in film anywhere, and yet it works for me in this particular instance.

Overall, the Elephant Man is a fine achievement for a young director. Lynch would go on to make more articulate, less sentimental films. But here we find him assured in his imagery and storytelling. He effectively sweeps the viewer into the emotional turmoil of such a sad, hopeless story.

248926,3,6300214044,"The Elephant Man tells the story of John Merrick, a severely deformed man who lived around the turn of the century, and was the subject of ridicule and general horror for those who only saw him as a circus freak. However, for those who took the time to get to know him, and saw past his physical oddities, he was a man of gentle compassion, and was as capable of fitting in with society as any other human, but only if society would give him a chance.

As the film begins, John Merrick (John Hurt) is an attraction in a freak show, being labeled as The Terrible Elephant Man. He is treated as an animal by the proprieter of the show, beaten relentlessly in order to perform for the gawkers who come to see his misfortune. The elephant man draws the interest of Dr. Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins), who rescues him from the freak show with the intent of studying his condition in a hospital. Treves is surprised to discover that Merrick is actually quite intelligent and is able to read, write, and talk, though he has been so mistreated that he often has difficulty speaking to strangers.

Soon, there are articles in the newspaper describing the elephant man and his condition, and the people who read these articles either respond with compassion or exploitation. Compassion is shown by the stage actress Mrs. Kendal (Anne Bancroft), who is absolutely delighted to find out that Merrick has a love for theater, though he has never attended a live show, due to his condition. A man named Bytes does the exploiting, bringing curious people--usually drunk--to see the elephant man and recoil in terror at his appearance. Meanwhile, while all this attention is being paid to Merrick, Treves wonders whether he has helped the situation any--people are still just as interested in seeing this deformed man, it's just in a less hostile environment--or whether Merrick's situation can be helped at all.

The Elephant Man is based on a true story, and surely the story has been embellished with dramatic elements, but regardless, once the film finds its footing, it has some compelling spots. John Hurt does a masterful job in creating a sympathetic character out of a man who is at first glance a monster. Buried beneath a veritable mountain of make-up and masks, Hurt is able to use the restrictions to his advantage, allowing us to see both the physical deformities of this man as well as his struggle to be accepted by society.

Director David Lynch filmed The Elephant Man in beautiful stark black and white--partially because of the make-up, partially because of the period in which the story takes place, and, I think, partially because of the mystery and shadows that black and white allows that cannot be rivaled by color. The message of the story is pretty clear: don't judge a person based on their looks. This is obviously a good message to preach, but I'm not sure if The Elephant Man did all that it could have to convey it.",1111017600,3,2934,4.724609375
248927,5,6300214044,"I first saw this film back in 1981 at the theater when I was 12. It frightened and saddened me though I cannot say I was really traumatized by it. However, it must have made some sort of emotional impact before I have always been terrified of viewing this film in the 20-plus years that have past since then. The most disturbing aspect to me was the inhumane treatment John Merrick received. Just today I got up my courage and bought the DVD at the music store. I sat, white knuckles and all-expecting the worst. Well, I got through it. For one thing, it didn't seem as ominous this go-round. (Funny how your perceptions change as an adult). The fact that this was a period piece works to the film's benefit in that it hasn't dated at all. I am glad the producers and director agreed to use black-and-white film because it adds to the authenticity. What surprised me most was how much I had actually forgotten: the scene in the monkey cage, the fact that Anne Bancroft appeared, and more. What did always stick in my memory was what I refer to as the ""raid"" scene. (When the sleazy Night Porter brings his ""customers"" from the pub to Merrick's room, carrying John around, forcing the cheap tarts to kiss him, and then holding a mirror up to his face to purposely shock him.) Upon viewing The Elephant Man as an adult, my favorite scenes are now the most beautiful yet the saddest ones: when John meets Treeves' wife and says he never meant to be a disappointment to his mother, and the final scene as Merrick carefully takes the pillows off the bed and places them on the table. This film should be mandatory study for all North American high school students. Though even then, I am sure there would be more than a few jaded teens who would find some sort of comedy in it.

The image on this dvd is beautiful. It is expanded to it's original theatrical aspect ratio, and the sound has never been more clear.

The Elephant Man tells the truly powerful story of John Merrick, played brilliantly by John Hurt. Horribly deformed, John Merrick is discovered by Dr. Treeves in a freakshow. His caretaker is an overbearing man who will never let his ""Treasure"" go. After Dr. Treeves convinces his caretaker to bring John to the hospital to give him medical attention, Dr. treeves realizes the remarkable find he has in his care, he tells the caretaker off and begins to care for John Merrick himself.

What follows is one of the handful of truly great stories of the search for acceptance, and the power of the human spirit.

248930,5,6300214044,"It's hard to know how much is to be credited to Hurt's acting, and how much to Tucker and co.'s make-up. Either way, it's the best acting/make-up combination I've seen (to my memory,there may be others). Hurt's expressions had to be impeccable to penetrate the heavy-duty make-up, and the make-up had to be impeccable to allow the actor's expressions to actually come across on film.
The suspense build-up to the revealing the full extent of Elephant Man's deformity, is brilliant. Some films are anti-climactic, and others drag the suspense card out so long that you just don't care anymore. This one? Perfection! The actor involved in the revealing scene was nothing short of utterly convincing. And the drama surrounding the circumstance that allowed for that unfortunate incident, was written and acted with depth and class.
The only point that could have any possibility of preventing my 5*ing this film, is that it doesn't provide insight into how Elephant Man achieves his well-adjustedness to his circumstances. I'd like there to have been at least one scene addressing the source of his strength. But, it is still touching, the courage of his coping and grace.
Hopkins is revered for his role as Hannibal Lector in Silence of the Lambs. And fairly so. But his role in this is my favourite. His representation of this man of compassion and dedication, is powerful. The spirit of helping someone without need of reason, is embodied perfectly. As is the character's self-doubt as to his own motives. And the writers deserve their due for this. The writing is as good as film-writing gets. The directing is so smooth and on the spot with everything. The directing drags the full effect from every scene that could be salvaged. The hostility and exploitive opportunism is excellently portrayed by the actors filling the roles. The incidental actors responding to Elephant Man in all the many different ways, fulfill their roles with equal prowess to the main actors.
Due to a mass quick-thrill neccessity in society, this is not a movie that jumps out as a great film of all time. It has brilliance that requires an audience member to be inward searching and morally aware.",1102896000,5,2177,4.950819672131147
248931,5,6300214044,"""The Elephant Man"", with John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins (along with Hannibal Lecter his best piece of acting) is a powerhouse of a film that makes you feel fortunate and unfortunate at the same time--fortunate that you yourself can walk in the street without provoking screams, and unfortunate that you live in a world where a person's physical appearance will cause screams.

Dr. Frederick Treves (Hopkins), a doctor and a devotee of the deformed and the lost, somehow gets wind of a carnival sideshow with a ""freak"" who is actually authentic--""the elephant man"", a hideously deformed young person whose physical appearance is so horrendous that no one seems to mind as he is abused by his sketchy master (something strange and homoerotic is ever present in this drunken brute's relentless determination to ""own"" Hurt's character), starved, and kept in a sideshow until Treves comes along and emancipates him.

At first we believe that Merrick is mentally handicapped, as all he can do to communicate with Treves is grunt and groan in fright.  It turns out, however, (and this is never explained at any length) that Merrick is extremely intelligent and very religious.  Through all the heavily layered and almost suffocating makeup Hurt brings home a characterization that is as unforgettable as it is haunting.  Merrick is a lonely, abused soul fully cognizant of his place in the world.  A side of him seems to believe he is an animal deserving of abuse, while the other side is an astute literary gentleman who wants, in his own somewhat garbled words, only to ""be good"".

There are scenes in this movie that will make you absolutely furious and scenes that are worthy of tears.  Others will make you happy as you see Merrick go from having a wretched, worthless life to an actually happy and full existence courtesy of Treves.  The relationship between Treves and Merricks is, beyond doubt, one of the most believable and heart-rending bonds between two men ever filmed.

The weaknesses are negligible and we can put most of them down to Lynch's unrelenting need to inject the depressing and  strange where they have no place.  The ending, for example, while touching, is inexcusably vague for a film which has commanded that much power up till that point.  Did Merrick commit suicide?  Are we supposed to be seeing him ascend to heaven?  Whatever, this is still one of the greatest films of the century.",1101513600,2,2408,4.911111111111111

As a kid I was pushed down the stairs, beat up and made fun of everyday at school.  I used to prey for massive snowstorms so I would get some relief.  Even now when I have the blues I put this movie on.  After viewing, nothing in my life seems so bad.  John Merrick had it bad.  This film shows the cruelity of the world, and shows what a little love and kindness can do.  Beautifuly filmed in glorious black-and-white, it uses camera angles and shadows like no other film I've seen.  David Lynch's direction is both emotional and frightning.  He shows the horrors of the world but not for shock value.  It teaches us all a lesson that even what seems to be monsterous is still human and worth love and affection.  In some twisted way this is a love story.  For love does conquer all...

Horrible, yet amazing when you think about the way he has touched so many of us.

John Hurt's insights were particularly interesting; there are so many things that could have torpedoed the project but thankfully didn't.
I only wish David Lynch could have been interviewed, as this was his first major project after Eraserhead and he really matured in terms of being able to work in a major production with so many shining talents.",1088726400,,688,4.888888888888889
249026,5,6300214044,"The Elephant Man is a film of incredible passion and power.  For those who think ""power"" in the movies involves supernatural abilities or mastery of martial arts or destructive weapons - The Elephant Man is perhaps not for you.
David Lynch's film is shot in black and white which gives a Victorian feel to the era depicted, but also gives a startling chiarascuro visual to many scenes.
Much of the information about the life of Mr. Merrick was obtained from accounts written by Dr. Treves, who became so celebrated that he was chosen to be Royal Physician, so it is perhaps not surprising that Treves comes off well in this film.  The central performances are by John Hurt as Merrick and Anthony Hopkins as Treves, and they are both absolutely stunning.  I have viewed the film a half-dozen times, and there are moments that I am moved every single time.
The Elephant Man suffers from terrible physical deformities that are only gradually shown to the audience.  But we discover that his mental faculties are not hindered at all, and the scene in which this discovery is made is absolutely astonishing.
The late John Gielgud does excellent work as the hospital administrator, Mr. Carr Gomm.  In the scene after it is revealed that the Elephant Man has normal intelligence  Carr Gomm takes  Treves aside.
""Can you IMAGINE what sort of life he has had?"" (Merrick has spent his life up to that point as a side-show freak, beaten and jeered at.)
Treves looks absent-mindedly out the window before starting to reply ""Yes, I think I ....""
Carr Gomm rebukes him sharply. ""No you can't!"" He softens his voice. ""No one can.""
And watching that scene we TRY to imagine the myriad of humiliations and sufferings that the poor man has endured simply for his unfortunate appearance.  But we realize that we cannot ""walk a mile in his shoes"" and we recognize that we truthfully can't imagine what he has been through.
Nonetheless we find John Merrick witty and engaging and pleasant. Later on Merrick has become the Belle of the Ward and there is a steady stream of dignitaries who come by to visit.  One of the wise old nurses, played by the wonderful Wendy Hillar, gives Treves a piece of her mind and suggests that Merrick has simply become a sideshow again and is being stared at all over again.  This leads to a wonderful scene at home between Treves and his wife, played by Hannah Gordon, in which Treves does some honest soul-searching.  Another scene where Treves has invited Merrick to his own home is remarkable for it's emotional amplitude.  Treves has become very used to being around The Elephant Man, but Mrs. Treves is not, and despite being ""prepared"" for his sight, there are multiple instances when she is clearly struggling to ""seem normal"".
There are several other touching scenes, such as when Anne Bancroft,playing a famous London Actress, visits and her acting ability enables her to overlook his deformities more easily than Mrs. Treves, or when Princess Alex arrives at a key hospital board meeting to personally deliver a plea from Queen Victoria for a permanent place for ""one of England's least fortunate sons"".  It would have been easy to turn overly sentimental or to pander, but Lynch knows when to reign things in perfectly.
This work has much to say about the dignity of man, and I recommend it highly.",1088380800,7,3320,4.7630662020905925
249027,2,6300214044,"There is a reason that this movie recieved so many Oscar nominations; it's a movie meant for the occasion. The Elephant Man is better shot, better acted and all round better made then the majority of Oscar nominated movies but ultimately it's sentimental and doesn't meet out its own potential. I was very excited to rent this movie because the more and more I see by David Lynch the more impressed I am. Both Blue Velvet and the Straight Story (just to name two) absolutely wowed me with their vision and totally original feel. I'm convinced that Lynch is one of the most notable and important living American directors. The Elephant Man looks and sounds great, but the handling of the material is just average. In a lesser movie, this wouldn't be as infuriating but in a movie with such amazing visual atmosphere you kind of expect a depth of emotion. I thought that this movie wore its morals as a cub scout badge. There was so much more potential in the material. I wanted murkiness and ambivalence. Why do we react so violently and hatefully to ugliness? Did the doctor really care about his patient or was he just another ringmaster? And most importantly, what of class? The Elephant Man's happiness seems to be entirely dependent on his acceptance into high society. The people shown reacting ignorantly to the Elephant Man are all poor and dirty. Quite a simplistic attitude if you ask me. If you are looking for a tear jerker, rent this movie, you could do worse. If you are looking for Lynch with balls, Blue Velvet is your best decision.",1078444800,11,1548,4.653284671532846
249028,5,6300214044,"""Time hath not altered"" the emotional impact this movie has on me when I watch it. The word ""poignant"" has grown hackneyed from overuse, but it certainly applies to this great film. Few films can equal it in terms of dramatic artistry and pitch perfect performances. There's not one maudlin note in a film that could easily have descended into bathetic melodrama in lesser hands.
Lynch was practically a neophyte at the time he directed this movie, yet to many (and to most, for that matter, save the true believers) THE ELEPHANT MAN is his magnum opus. I believe this is because of the mostly Britsh, classically trained actors that made up the cast. Hopkins and Hurt excell. Anne Bancroft (who I believe is the only American in the cast) delivers a flawless performance. Freddy Jones, as Bytes (this was before the internet, remember) is simply uncanny in his tour-de-force portrayal of arguably the vilest villain in cinema history. Who cares that the character was totally innacurate, historically? He chews up the scenery in true Grand Guignol fashion. Gielgud and Wendy Hiller are also on hand to provide levitas. One can't find a better ensemble. It's criminal that at least one of them weren't awarded an Oscar, but that's just another example of how meaningless those little gold statuettes are, more often than not.
Though this is a lot more linear than most of Lynch's movies, there is enough of the surreal on hand to keep the die hards happy. But the surrealism doesn't get in the way of the plot. Christopher de Vore and Eric Bergren, who collaborated with Lynch on the screenplay, can take some credit for that. Veteran cinematographer, Freddie Francis did perhaps the best work of his career here. The black and white images are as good as it gets. The sets are unforgettable. Victorian London has never looked so convincing on screen, yet with that nightmarish quality that defines most of the movie.
If you've never seen this movie, get your hands on a copy, soon. It couldn't be described as ""weepy,"" by any means. But if you're not reaching for the kleenex at some stage in this marvellous film, I'd ask the Wizard for a heart, if I were you. For those of you who haven't seen it in a while, give it a re-viewing. It absolutely holds up, particularly in comparison to 1980 Best Picture, ORDINARY PEOPLE...and Best Director, Robert Redford? Hopkins didn't get nominated, but Jack Lemmon did for TRIBUTE? Anyone remember that one? Gotta go find some Maalox.

Inarticulate and abused, Merrick is the virtual slave of a carnival barker until dedicated London doctor Frederick Treves rescues him from the life and offers him an existence with dignity. Anne Bancroft costars as the actress whose visit to Merrick makes him a social curiosity, with John Gielgud and Wendy Hiller as dubious hospital staffers won over by Merrick. David Lynch earned his only Oscar nominations as director and cowriter of this somber drama, which he shot in a rich black-and-white palette, a sometimes stark, sometimes dreamy visual style that at times recalls the offbeat expressionism of his first film, Eraserhead.

249082,5,6300214044,"As I sit down to write this review, my experiences with it from my youth came flooding back. I first saw it as a 17 year old high-schooler at my local movie theater, late one evening. I had seen, and enjoyed, the Broadway play a few months earlier, and wanted to see how the movie compared. The play, I should say, was very moving and had a certain spareness in its production design that was very effective. I had left the theatre with a moist eye and an interest in learning more about John Merrick, The Elephant Man (who had neurofibromatosis, NOT elephantitis, as is so often attributed to him).

Anyway, when the movie concluded, the ENTIRE audience of 150 or so sat in its seats, numbed and unmoving. It was one of those experiences where you fight back your tears, because you're worried if you let go, you'll start bawling like a baby! The film was so profoundly moving to me and so artistically brilliant, that I went again the very next day, dragging reluctant friends with me. They were all stunned. I watched it AGAIN later that week.

I've watched it on video a couple of times years ago, but until I rewatched it recently on DVD, it had been nearly 10 years since I'd seen it.

The story is set in the early turn-of-the-twentieth-century London. John Merrick (John Hurt) is, for lack of a better word, enslaved as a sideshow freak.  He has the most hideous growths on his bones, which give him a frightening appearance.  His  head is probably three times bigger than a normal human, and the shape resembles a lumpy dirigible.  His limbs are mostly tangled messes.  Noted physician Dr. Treves (Anthony Hopkins) hears of this ""elephant man"" and is fascinated so greatly by his condition that he brings him to his hospital for study.  Everyone has always assumed this man must be a mute ""idiot.""  Turns out that Merrick is a gentle, thoughtful and almost unbearably forgiving soul.  The relationship that emerges between Treves and Merrick, as well as with Merrick and virtually everyone he encounters, is at the heart of this film.

(Note of caution: The movie does not follow John Merrick's life terribly accurately...neither did the play. When I read the biography of Merrick that his doctor, Treves, wrote, I got his ""true"" story, which is just as moving in its own way.)

David Lynch, we all know, is a ""difficult"" director, at least when it comes to narrative continuity. This movie, however, is his most accessible (along with THE STRAIGHT STORY, which doesn't even feel like a Lynch movie). It tells a straightforward story...no dancing dwarfs, no little people behind radiators, no Wizard of Oz references, etc. etc. No Laura Palmer. However, the touches he brings to it are pure Lynch, and they serve the movie profoundly.

For example, the movie takes place in the midst of the early Industrial Revolution, when science was becoming more ""popular"" or ""glorified"" by the masses. It was also a time when London was awash in factories, and all the noise and pollution they wrought. If you've seen ERASERHEAD or DUNE, you know that Lynch likes to have lots of background noises of machinery. Often, those sounds are distracting. In ELEPHANT MAN, we are constantly aware, through these sounds, that we are in a very specific time and place, where the lifeblood of society was machinery, but big, dirty, unsubtle, dangerous machinery. This, coupled with the glorious black and white cinematography, truly create a mood that is unequaled.
Also, there are some brief dream sequences in which Merrick sees his mother. She flits in and out of his dreams in a manner only Lynch can evoke. No one has ever been better at capturing on film the elusive nature of dreaming...that dreams are a crazy combination of good things and bad things happening all at once. These dreams are not a ""device"" but a window into Merrick's soul.

Those of us who remember when the film first came out remember the constant rehashing of the ""I am not an animal, I am a human being, I am a MAN!!"" line that Merrick yells out when cornered in a train station. This howl of despair is one of the most gripping moments EVER put to film. I tear-up just thinking about it.

The makeup is incredible. Having seen photos of the real Merrick, I can state that the makeup crew got it right! And the black and white helps to mask any imperfections. And underneath the makeup...
...is John Hurt, a fabulous actor in the role of his lifetime. He brings a delicacy and gentleness to the part that has to bee seen to be believed. I guarantee you'll be moved.

Hurt is ably assisted by Anthony Hopkins in a role which calls for restraint, and he delivers, which is unusual for Hopkins, who can overact at the drop of a hat...I love him, but sometimes he can overdo it, you must admit.  The rest of the cast is full of familiar British character actors, as well as a brief but incandescent appearance by Anne Bancroft.  Everyone is at their very best.

Initially, the film snags the viewer because of our fascination at seeing a human being so horrifically monstrous.  It holds a lurid fascination that fades into compassion and empathy.  If a person as horribly mistreated by his fellow man, as well as by fate, can find beauty, forgiveness, tenderness and love flowing from him and to him...well, the film leaves you to draw your own personal conclusions.

I know that Lynch receives more ongoing accolades for his disturbing BLUE VELVET, and of course, for the groundbreaking TWIN PEAKS...but THE ELEPHANT MAN is the one I'm always drawn back to.

I simply cannot recommend this film highly enough. Moviemaking doesn't get any more heartbreaking and effective than this masterpiece.",1054166400,112,5658,4.720812182741117

249087,5,6300214044,"""The Elephant Man,"" director David Lynch's sophomore major film effort, seems to be groomed for greatness from the beginning.  The story of John Merrick, a horribly deformed person who lived in London in the Victorian age and became somewhat of a celebrity among medical and social circles in that time, ""The Elephant Man"" is many things: a historical throwback to an earlier style of filmmaking, a story of human triumph, and a film designed to tug at the heartstrings and manipulate with them.  Lynch isn't known for making ""easy"" films.  Even his blue-collar masterpiece ""The Straight Story,"" released more than 15 years after ""The Elephant Man,"" has a depth and complexity not found in many novels.  ""Elephant"" may stand as the one exception to this rule.
In a dank, filthy, black-and-white London, Dr. Frederick Treves (played by a much younger Anthony Hopkins before he became typecast as another, more evil Doctor) visits a carnival sideshow.  Therein, he discovers John Merrick, the Elephant Man, a person whose bone structure has been twisted so that it appears he has a tusk growing from his swollen, malformed face.  Treves recognizes Merrick as a medical curiosity, and plucks him from being a carnival exhibit to being a teaching tool for his classes.  In a fit of compassion, Treves wonders if Merrick might actually be able to understand what goes on around him, and discovers that he is correct: the Elephant Man, while deformed on the outside, has a perfectly working mind and is fully cognizant of others, language, and actions.  The rest of the movie follows Merrick as he tries to be recognized for the simple fact that he's a human being.
Because of this fairly straightforward treatment of a very serious subject - what does it mean to be human, and to have human rights and dignity - ""Elephant"" doesn't reach the same levels of depth as ""Blue Velvet"" or even ""Straight Story.""  It's unfortunate, because Lynch is a very capable director, and it almost seems as if decisions were made not on the basis of what would make the best movie, but what would appeal to more people (and more award-shows).
Don't misunderstand, ""Elephant"" manages its subject matter with far more finesse than most other films that attempt to breach the same territory, it's simply that it had the potential to be more than it was.  The acting is wonderful, and John Hurt was literally robbed for his Oscar as Merrick - the emotional range he portrays with body language alone reflects a mastery of his craft.  As with all Lynch films, the meticulous attention to detail and cinematographical excellence are welcome qualities in a time when most movies settle for computer-rendered effects and pointing the camera at some people.
Rent ""Elephant Man.""  As emotionally draining as this movie can be, you may want to watch it before you buy it, because it's not something you'll pop in the DVD player on a Friday night just to watch.

249191,5,6300214044,"This film which is one of my favorite director, David Lynchs, is made of monochrome film and talks about real story, John Merrick who was suffering from rare and incurable disease. First of all, the point is that this film is a black-and-white picture, which is extraordinary. It is probably, because the appearance of John is quite shocking and dreadful. So he is called The Elephant Man. When he has treated cruelly at the circus as he was seeing his body to the audience, he met Dr. Frederick who helped him to escape from his life like a hell. At this point, it is disprovable why Dr. Frederick helped him. He would be able to think John for an experiment. However, he is relieved of curiosity at his first sight and he becomes to be attracted by his humanity. At last, he thinks deeply and truly about the human dignity. In conclusion, this film talks about the human dignity. Although John was physically disabled person who has a gruesome figure, he was warm-hearted and pure man who really loves a literature. However, people are just surprised at his appearance, they would not have a conversation with him. This film is dealing with a pure heart man who has lived his whole life with peoples prejudice. Compared with other David Lynchs films, it emphasizes dramatic construction, because it is probably like a biography of John Merrick. In this point, it is a unique film as David Lynch who usually has made a film with a peculiar style and atmosphere such as Eraserhead which is similar to this film in a monochrome film and weird scenes. this is the most gentle film for David Lynch who always has a specific style which makes audience to understand a film very delicately, so it is easy to understand. It is because story takes the central place in this film that it is not so difficult to understand. Excellent directing, and what is more, performance of John Hurt who played in role John Merrick, and Anthony Hopkins who played in role Dr. Frederick, both of them are outstanding.

It was the beginning of the movie, I had not missed much.  All I can say is... Wow!  I purchased it immediately after I saw it.
I liked the fact that the movie, though filmed in 1982, was done in black and white for a little more authenticity.  All of the actors and actresses played their parts wonderfully.  John Hurt does a great job portraying John Merrick as he easily works his way into your heart.  Anthony Hopkins does a nice job playing the doctor whose only interest in Merrick is to advance his own medical career.  Soon, though, Hopkins character is soon emotionally attached to Merrick.

249194,5,6300214044,"There is so much that can be said about this film for a number of reasons. Much of it would spoil the film for those who have yet to view it. Let's begin with the basics:
This film covers the time in John Merick's (the Elephant Man)life where he is rescued from a life of freakshow gawk and abusive captivity and follows him to his death. I don't know whether or not to recommend studying the history of this man before viewing the film or not. Be assured, however, that this film will leave an indellible and Deep mark in your soul regardless of how much (or little) you know historically.
John Merick was born with a disease (if it can be called such) that left him almost inhumanly disfigured and with skin that hung coarse, tumor filled, and loose {hence the name 'Elephant Man'}. He was hurried into a horrific existence of tormenting sneers and gasps from ""audience"" members at the freakshow he was the main attraction of. Early in the film a doctor (played spectacularly by Anthony Hopkins)'rescues' him and takes him into the eventual permanent care of the London Hospital. Slowly, Merick captivates and enlightens his caregivers to the (nothing short of) brilliant soul inhabiting his mangled shell.
What follows is easily considered on of THE BEST FILM PERFORMANCES in existence - namely by John Hurt as John Merick. Though all that is visible behind a stunning feat of prosthesis-makeup are Hurt's eyes and voice, he carries the essence of such a trampled being to levels rarely acheivable by mankind. The fact that he did not receive an Academy Award is beyond Blasphemy! Between the director's(David Lynch!) innovative and artistic beauty, and Hurt's soul wrenching performance, the film can almost be unbearable to watch at times. Anyone who has ever tasted the slightest cruelty of another's taunting will surely buckle under the weight of this film. The importance of this film is inexpressable. Historically, and socially, it shoves to the forefront all of our damnable crimes against eachother through our own sense of vanity and conformity.
This film ought to be required for all highschool and college students - if but for their own sake. It truly captures the wickedness we are all capable of and also (even moreso) the beauty we all hold within - even in the face of total obstacle.
Simply a MUST SEE for EVERYONE!",1016236800,6,2337,4.8159203980099505

Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Original Score, Best Costume Design, Best Art Direction-Set Direction, Best Film Editing, and Best Screenplay. Unfortunately, it won none. Best Director was handed to Robert Redford for Ordinary People. I was bewildered why the Academy Awards gave it to him. Ordinary People also won Best Picture. The Elephant Man was also a better movie than Ordinary People. Ordinary People was a great movie, but The Elephant Man and Raging bull was excellent movies. Best Actor in a Leading Role was handed to the deserving Robert De Niro for Raging Bull. John Hurt gave a touching performance as the elephant man, but the audience and the critics could not see his face. That was probably why he only received an Academy Award nomination. However, Hurt won a British Academy Award for his performance.
  The direction and the editing increased the movie artistic quality. The cinematography and strange music gained the haunting and dark atmosphere of the movie. Anthony Hopkins and John Hurt gave a great performance. Anthony Hopkins portrayed Dr. Frederick Treves. Treves was the kind surgeon who helped John Merrick.  John Hurt portrayed John Merrick.

249197,5,6300214044,"The Elephant Man, released in 1980, is a remarkable film.  It is the true story of Englishman John Merrick, who was born with a rare disease that has left him horribly disfigured.  He is exploited by a sideshow circus owner until he is rescued by Treves, a physician from the London Hospital, who wishes to study his case.  But as Treves gets to know Merrick, he realizes that underneath the hideous visage lies a gentle, loving soul.  But just as Merrick finds contentment, he is kidnapped by the sideshow owner, who feels that he has been cheated by the doctor.
John Merrick is played by an unrecognizable John Hurt, who gives an incredible performance underneath all that make up.  Merrick's rescuer, Dr. Treves, is played to near perfection by Anthony Hopkins.  Anne Bancroft, John Gielgud, and Wendy Hiller play minor roles.
The Elephant Man was shot on high-quality black and white film, which adds to the Victorian Era atmosphere, and makes the deformed face of John Merrick much more interesting than color would have.  This was David Lynch's second major directorial effort, and it remains one of his best films.  And, quite shockingly, the film's executive producer was none other than Mel Brooks. But Brooks left his name off the credits so that filmgoers wouldn't misconstrue The Elephant Man as a comedy.  The only mention of Brooks's name is found in the production company, Brooksfilms.
The film received 8 Academy Award nominations, although it didn't win any Oscars.  But the creation of the make-up for the John Merrick character did begin the process for the Academy adding a new award category for Best Make Up for future years.

249199,5,6300214044,"""The Elephant Man"" is arguably the best of David Lynch's works while some may argue his best being ""Mulholland Drive"", a film which may easily lock him up as a best Director nominee for the 2002 Academy Awards.
""The Elephant Man"" takes place in England about a man called John Merrick, who's used as a freak show because of his abnormal looks and body structure, played by John Hurt, who was given a new life by a doctor played by Anthony Hopkins.  The movie later takes us to see what Merrick goes through in his life before being rescued and the life after.
It's important for many of you to note that this is a PG movie because this movie is that important for everyone to watch.  It demonstrates ignorance, prejudice, and the evils of the human race.  Watching this movie is a life-changing experience and perhaps a turning point in your life.  David Lynch's direction in this movie is absolutely outstanding right from the beginning to the end, strange and dreamy.  Lynch has long been criticized for his film to be a dreamy imagery by the film critics.  However, in this film, it works in its effect of telling the horrific cause of Merrick's looks and teaching us the main lessons of the movie.  It's evident there's so much passion put in to make this movie.
Bottom line, even though the movie could be disturbing at times, but it is compelling and beautifully made- in black and white.  If you want to see good acting and directing, this is the one.",1011052800,3,1458,4.538167938931298
249200,5,6300214044,"The true history of The Elephant Man, who's real name was actually ""Joseph"" Merrick, is one of degradation and misery, only momentarily relieved by his association with Dr. Frederick Treeves and his stay at the London Hospital.  His life as a sideshow freak was actually something he entered into voluntarily, as what he considered the only way he could stay out of the Poor House.  He was abandoned in France by the man who acted as his Barker when the show was shut down, and he did make the harrowing journey back to England much as is depicted in the film, but the mistreatment that he suffers in the movie I have to assume is meant as a composite sort of license taking, as he did spend his childhood in a dormitory for homeless boys, where it is assumed he suffered incredibly, as he would never speak of that time to anyone.  All in all, though, the movie gets it right more often than not, especially the circumstances of his death, which was the most poignant moment I can remember seeing in a movie in a long time.

249284,5,6300214044,"The Hughes Brothers' recent release FROM HELL includes a brief (and surely unexpected) appearance by one John Merrick, better known as 'the Elephant Man'.  Merrick's inclusion in a movie about Jack the Ripper points up the odd connections between these two figures.  Both represented extremes of degradation (moral in one case, physical in the other) that had never been seen before; both aroused horror and fascination in equal degrees; and both were major press sensations - all in the same district of London at roughly the same time.  Indeed, John Merrick and Jack the Ripper might even be seen as yin and yang: while the Ripper's (presumably normal) exterior masked a heart of the blackest evil, Merrick's hideous body housed one of the kindest and gentlest souls ever to grace this planet.

This beautiful soul is the focus of David Lynch's magnificent film, THE ELEPHANT MAN.  Broadly speaking, the film is a true story; while a fair portion of the details are either totally fictitious or conflated from several real-life sources, the general outline of the script is true. It follows Merrick from his first encounter with Dr Frederick Treves (Hopkins), the man who helped him regain his dignity, until his death trying to ""sleep like normal people"" - this final scene being only one of many unforgettable moments in the film.

The cast of THE ELEPHANT MAN is utterly top-notch.  With only his eyes visible beneath Christopher Tucker's extraordinary makeup, John Hurt manages to give a tremendously moving performance in the title role.  You won't soon forget his recitation of the 23rd Psalm, his heartbreaking teatime visit to Treves's wife (a fine cameo by Hannah Gordon), or his reading of Romeo to Anne Bancroft's Juliet (another great cameo).  Anthony Hopkins once again proves himself to be among the greatest actors of our time; his performance as Treves is nicely nuanced, evincing subtle and deeply human contradictions, where a lesser actor might have portrayed a mere two-dimensional Virtuous Leading Man. John Gielgud is his usual brilliant self, Freddie Jones is excellent as the sinister yet somehow tragic Mr Bytes, and the various supporting roles are all up to the very high standard set by these leading players.

Since 1980 was the year of RAGING BULL and ORDINARY PEOPLE, it is perhaps understandable that THE ELEPHANT MAN didn't win any of the 8 Academy Awards for which it was nominated - though in my opinion it is every bit as good as either of those films.  What is scandalous, however, is the fact that Freddie Francis's stunning black-and-white cinematography wasn't even nominated.  (Francis did pick up his second Oscar, for Edward Zwick's GLORY, a few years later.)

Lynch's direction, finally, is a revelation.  This was only his second film, and he was working with some of the greatest actors living at the time, but his hand has never been surer.  Not until THE STRAIGHT STORY (also, incidentally, photographed by Francis) would he again attempt so direct a presentation, but the results here are simply superb.  There isn't a hollow note or an empty image in the entire film, which is more than one can say for some of Lynch's later efforts.

The DVD's picture quality is excellent, the sound likewise.  Extras include the theatrical trailer, some interesting bits concerning Christopher Tucker's makeup, and a brief documentary featuring comments from Tucker, John Hurt, Freddie Francis, producer Jonathan Sanger, and (uncredited) executive producer Mel Brooks (yes, that Mel Brooks).  It would have been nice to hear something from David Lynch as well, but all things considered, this is a fairly minor quibble.  A great film and a great DVD - pick it up today.",1008633600,13,3707,5.0360065466448445
249285,4,6300214044,"David Lynch's Elephant Man has a cinematic style that has been called Steampunk and compared to the early fantastic fiction of Tom Powers and James Blaylock. Steampunk was coined as a retro analogue to Cyberpunk. The movie itself does not fit in that subgenre label.
Peter Nicholls, in the Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, in his entry on Steampunk, mentioned the film in this context: ""Steampunk is a US phenomenon, often set in London, England, which is envisaged as a once deeply alien and intimately familiar, a kind of foreign body encysted in the US subconscious....not so much the actual 19th century as a 19th century seen through the distorting lens of Charles Dickens, whose congested, pullulating 19th-century landscapes were the foul rag-and-bone shop of history from which the technological world, and hence the world of SF, originally sprang. Somewhere behind most Steampunk visions are filthy coal heaps or driving pistons. It was a vision that also entered the cinema, especially through David Lynch, first in Eraserhead (1976) and then in The Elephant Man (1980), and even -- inappropriately enough -- in much of the mise-en-scene of his movie Dune (1984).""
John Clute and Paul J. McAuley, both themselves accomplished SF writers, in the Encyclopedia of Fantasy, gave an entry to Steampunk as a subgenre of fantasy as well as SF, but they do not mention any movies or Lynch. They do differentiate Steampunk from Gaslight Romance, though both share the romanticized 19th-century London setting. Gaslight Romances border on supernatural fiction and fantasies of history, whereas Steampunk is more closely Technofantasy that features anachronism or alternate world settings, and urban fantasy. Dickens is mentioned again, his London a Babylon on the Thames. John Grant, another SF writer, gave David Lynch his own entry plus one on ""Twin Peaks"" (1990). He mentions Eraserhead, The Elephant Man, and Dune, but does not connect them to Steampunk. He does give Lynch his importance to fantasy with Twin Peaks and Blue Velvet (1986) and describes both as urban fantasy and surrealism.
Admittedly, both encyclopedias are not very helpful to Lynch's early work. The Elephant Man is not even presented as fiction. But neither as a documentary. Lynch has taken obvious creative liberty in his film's look, sound and narrative. It is more conservative and naturalistic than Eraserhead, its artistic flourishes are kept to a minimum, but flourishes they still are. The several short sequences of dreams and thought dot the film, make waves in the flow of the otherwise straight story. These scenes could not have come from any true source as the main story had. They qualify as fiction and as Steampunk, as they include actual steam, driving pistons and heaps of coal, as well as rampaging bull elephants.  At one point the producer was considering picking unknown talent Brett Weston as the disturbing freak of a man but he was considered to be too much to look at even with the film in black and white.  It also didn't help that just before filming was to start he was caught in a gay cinema with his trousers round his ankles and a small terrier yelping for it's life. A tragic waste of a comedy talent.
The non-fiction bulk of the film is kept historically real and accurate, no anachronisms and no fantastic technologies. Everything seen here was real, from the medical office officials and the uppper-class personages, complete with opera glasses, down to the bloody operating rooms, dusty specimen labs, squalid streets and alleyways, and the carnival. Every freakshow performer was real and documented, and actual dwarfs, giants and unusual people were among the film's cast. The makeups that recreate that infamous visage perfectly match the actual photographs and plaster casts Merrick himself taken in the 1880's. The entire cast bears the meticulous makeups and costumes that portray the period. Lynch and his crew have done an impeccable job all around.
Yet, there frequently is lots of steam and smoke, and occasionally punk kids on the streets (no trendy ""punk rock"" look here), and more often adults of the lower classes with their ill manners and nasty attitudes. No telling what types one might bump into downtown. There is that distorting lens, that peculiar conveyance that can easily be mistaken for Steampunk. No one may have thought of inventing a new niche of fantasy, no writers may have borrowed from the film. But when a critic noticed a stylistic similarity between certain novels and certain films, Steampunk was named. Lynch and his Elephant Man were labelled.",1008547200,,4594,5.099601593625498

249342,5,6300214044,"To say that this production of David Lynch and Freddie Francis is my favorite film of all time is an understatement. I have seen it so many times over the years that I have honestly lost count. At one point I was so completely fascinated with it, I was going to it two or three times a week while it was still in its first run in the theatres. After all these years and all these viewings, I believe I can finally put my finger on just what exactly it is about this film that does it for me: It is what I would now call an ""atmospheric"" masterpiece. This film really transports me to another time and place, draws me into another world, like a time capsule. I leave the theatre (or in this case now, after a home video viewing) feeling I've visited another dimension - which is what I want a really great film to do for me.
 My introduction to John Hurt - here completely unrecognizable under makeup based on actual casts of the Elephant Man's head and body - came primarily through the ""I Claudius"" television series in the 1970's, and is truly one of the most underappreciated actors of the 20'th century in my opinion. This performance of his as the historical Joseph Merrick, a Victorian Englishman suffering from severe neurofibromatosis, is truly a tour de force.  Merrick, rescued from a life of degradation as a circus sideshow freak, is taken into the London Hospital by the altruistic doctor Frederick Treves, another factually based historical figure, upon whose own written accounts the story is partially grounded.  Initially wishing to help Merrick escape his life of hopeless servitude to wandering carnival proprietor/""owner"" Bytes (perfectly portrayed by the great Freddie Jones), Treves soon faces the moral dilemma of whether he's resposible for having Merrick stared at all over again - albeit in better surroundings. This is an important film in my view, for its portrayal of human compassion. Although that having been said, the story also struggles with this issue of morality at the same time, in this comparison between Treves, Bytes and an unscrupulous nightwatchman at the hospital who all seem to want to use Merrick for their own ends.
 The beauty of Bernard Pomerance's play ""The Elephant Man"", was that the portrayal of Merrick was done without makeup - a part that would bring out the best in a qualified actor.  Here the roles are reversed, with John Hurt's features completely obscured by those of Merrick.  An astounding performance.  Another of this age's truly great actors - Anthony Hopkins - portrays Dr. Treves.  Top-notch supporting roles are turned in by Anne Bancroft as Dame Madge Kendall, John Gielgud and Wendy Hiller - whom some may recognize as Leslie Howard's personal project in the precursor to My Fair Lady, the 1939 adaptation of G.B. Shaw's ""Pygmalion.""
 Whatever the difficulties morally speaking for Dr. Treves, Merrick is given the chance to live out his last days with the dignity his actually refined mind and spirit deserve.  There are many wonderfully touching scenes -  the recitation of the 23'rd Psalm, the reading of Shakespeare, the visit of Merrick to Dr. Treves' home, Merrick asking the doctor if he can be cured, and the visit to the pantomime.  Freddie Francis' black and white photography is the real selling point in creating this atmospheric masterpiece that I mentioned before. This just would not work in color. One of the greatest shots in the whole film is a long shot of a steam locomotive inching across the screen from right to left, its plume of thick white steam slicing across the palette of varying shades of grey, that looked absolutely stunning on the big screen.  And of course, the music by John Morris.  Minimalist, yet so much is conveyed.  In short, treat yourself to this film as a fine example of a story of compassion, human dignity upheld, or as simply an example of masterful film making, wonderful acting by a slate of the best of British theatre.",999302400,,3945,4.797935103244837
249343,5,6300214044,"I first heard about the Elephant Man in the sixth grade, when, coming home from school one day, my mother introduced to me one of the many books written amout him.  Telling me a bit about him, she then turned to the photos in the center of the book, and those disturbing, then, images have vividly lived in my mind ever since.
  Thinking of the book as one I might not be interested in reading, I found myself turning to the inside of the front cover, engaged in learning about this strange human being and his even stranger condition.  (Which was thought to be neurofibromatosis, (NF) but was actually a similar, but different, condition known as Proteus Syndrome.)  I finally got to the point were I wanted to read the whole story, so I finished the book, (from the third chapter,) in a day.
  I found the story so intriguing and engrossing that I could not put it down and walk away.  My mother had also told me about the movie made for him, and that famous and powerful line: 'I am not an animal!'  These words shall never be forgotton.
  Two days ago, (August 9) I finally got to see the movie, which we rented from the library.  This moving film was equally engrossing and astounding, and never did I move away from the T.V. as I watched it.
  Joseph ('John') Merrick's story was so intricately captured in this film in which, because I had read that book, I was able to predict what a few of the upcoming events were, such as when Merrick constructed the cardboard cathedral, and when he watched the play which he so wonderfully enjoyed.  A few of the events in the film, however, were alien to me.  These had not been in the book I read, as it included some fictional happenings and was more inaccurate than some of the other books written about Merrick.
  John Hurt portrays 'John' Merrick so greatly that the two people, the actual Merrick and the movie Merrick, were near to exactly the same.  The way Hurt's character was treated is so much more disturbing than his appearance that it might count as the only thing disturbing about the film.  Compared to this, Merrick was not ugly at all.
  I still do not understand why I did not burst out into tears at certain parts of the movie, but I so thouroughly enjoyed it that, I suppose, there was no reason to do so.  This inspirational film is one that no one will, or should, ever forget.  And it is, in my opinion, one of the greatest ever created.",997488000,3,2409,4.4104308390022675
249344,5,6300214044,"I first heard about the Elephant Man in the sixth grade, when one day, after getting home from school, my mother pointed out to me a book written about him.  I found it, at first, quite bizarre,  and when I saw the photos of Joseph Merrick himself, the disturbing visions stayed in my mind, quite vividly.  Getting home, though I had thought of the book to be, back then, as one I might not be interseted in reading, I found myself reading a description of its contents inside the front cover.  This, I discovered, was highly intriguing to me.  Reading chapter by chapter each day, I reached the third when I finally decided to finish reading the book...so I completed the rest in one day.  It was so engrossing that I could not put it down and walk away from it.  And the story stayed fresh in my mind long after that day.  I recently had the priveledge of seeing the movie made for it, (just last night (8-9)) and neither could I walk away from the so vividly portrayed story of Joseph ('John') Merrick.  Since I had read a book about him, I was able to predict what would happen along the way, such as when he built the fantastic model of the cathedral, and then when he so tragically died.  I still do not understand why I did not burst out in tears at certain parts of the movie, but all the way through it, I had a lump in my  throat, and my eyes were constantly wet.  I grew to love this man more and more as I watched the movie.  John Hurt so wonderfully depicted 'John' Merrick that it was somewhat difficult to tell the difference between the actual person and the emotionally gripping actor.  This movie is one of the best that I have ever seen, and is probably one of the greatest films ever created.  And now that I have seen the movie, Joseph Merrick's story will forever stay in my mind.",997401600,,1802,4.289940828402367
249345,5,6300214044,"The Elephant Man is one of the most powerful films I have ever seen.  The story of John Merrick is based closely (but sometimes, not too closely) on the Victorian Joseph Merrick, who was so disfigured he could not go out in daylight.  Rescued from the life of a sideshow freak by Sir Frederick Treves (masterfully portrayed by Anthony Hopkins), he lives the remainder of his life in dignity and relative comfort, attracting the attention of much of upper-class society, including Dame Madge Kendall and Princess Alexandra.  The black and white cinematography is stunning; the makeup work--and John Hurt's ability to touch all of us beneath layers of latex--should have won Oscars.  The music is perfect.  One of those historical films which convinces you, ""yes, this MUST be what it was like to live back then.""  The small details matter, such as a scene where Treves is performing an operation, at a time when surgeons did not wear masks or gloves, and he coughs right on the man's chest.  Germ city--but they didn't know it back then.
OK, these were (just) some of the film's strong suits.  Now to review the actual video.  In short, this one screams out for a DVD release.  Even for a mid-priced video of a somewhat older movie, this VHS tape looks dreadful.  The black and white photography appears overexposed (all the whites are too pale, almost blindingly so, and I know it's not my TV because I did some comparisons).  For example, the scene where Treves first sees Merrick, Merrick is in almost total darkness and we must ""guess"" as to his appearance--this is how I remember it from HBO.  But heck, here everything is so light we can see the guy perfectly, certainly not the intended effect.
If this is not enough, consider that the original film was shot in widescreen, and yet most of the VHS is in full-frame, except for the opening credits.  After the credits we have a glorious split-second more of widescreen, but then we go to full-frame and don't get the original intent of Lynch's vision.  If this is not enough, there are tons and tons of artifacts on the film.  Some may think it makes it look ""Victorian,"" but I have a feeling a DVD release would clear this up as well.
So in short, this film needs a DVD with the following features: widescreen, trailer, commentary by the principals, perhaps including a historian who can compare the film to the life of the actual Elephant Man, and even deleted scenes.",996364800,3,2425,4.683962264150943

After seeing a screening of The Elephant Man at AMMI (American Museum of the Moving Image) a few years ago, I realized that the VHS shortchanges the viewer of so much.......But alas.... DVD may be the format that brings this film to the masses.

I read the play when I was in high school speech class, and it touched me so much even then that I was pleasantly surprised to see it as a movie, so I rented it and watched it.  the movie followed the book as I remember it extremely well, and I was actually able to visualize the horrible deformities that this man suffered as well as the torment.  I was surprised at how well everything was portrayed, from the storyline to the makeup.  The music was at a minimum, but that added to the overall great effect of the movie.

Filmed in black and white, it tells the true and altogether touching story of John Merrick, a young man so grotesquely deformed he was forced to spend most of his short life as a carnival sideshow attraction.
  Though he is looked upon and treated as an animal by both those who put him on display and others still who pay money to see him, Merrick's fortune soon takes a turn for the better in the guise of Dr. Treves. Treves, portrayed brilliantly by actor Anthony Hopkins, takes John into his care and tries to instill within him a sense of love, dignity, and acceptance.
  You won't see a more emotionally draining movie than this one. It's an important film and one that I truly believe parents should watch with their older children, especially given that it's based on a true story and would do well in teaching them acceptance for differences in others.

249401,5,6300214044,"This film is a masterpiece for various and very simple reasons.

First it is a real case, a real man, a real disease. The man is Joseph Merrick (called John Merrick in the film) and he was taken care of at the end of his life by the Royal London Hospital and this particular doctor Frederick Treves. His bones have been studied recently and the disease has been identified, including the cause of his death, asphyxiation.

Second it reveals two dimensions of Victorian society. The exploitation of horrible facts and beings, what they call freaks, that can inspire horror in the public. Exploitation in carnivals and funfairs, but also exploitation in everyday society in both cases by some greedy people who make money on these freaks. In reality Joseph Merrick was exploiting the public for his own survival because he was willing to do it to make the money he needed to take care of himself. The second dimension is the benevolence and empathy of this Victorian society, I mean here the doctors and medical personnel on one hand and the good society on the other hand to show they are good, for most of them, but for a few to prove to themselves they are human, humane, and for many of these few good Christians (the religious aspect that the film misses completely).

Third it also reveals that the medical personnel was ready to get out of their way to help a fellow human being who was in a state of suffering that deserved some help, and in this case we are beyond plain  suffering and beyond any kind of cure and even help. Lets say then some alleviating support. It is true too that the doctors might have done it for the advancement of their own career, but thats part of the game, isn't it?

The film cheats on some details. How could Joseph Merrick have learned Shakespeare or the Bible if he had been the possession of his carnival master? How could Joseph Merrick have carried on himself the portrait of his mother if he had been the possession of his carnival master? How did Jospeh Merrick get into that position of being a show animal in carnivals (which he was not in real life since he made it a career)? Finally the escape to Belgium, or the abduction to Belgium, and then the return to England shows clearly he was considered as a fellow artist by the other carnival attractions, but it forgets to mention the fact that his employer abandoned him in Belgium after robbing his fifty pounds, a real fortune at the time, that he had accumulated in time.

But the film remains a masterpiece of empathy and humane social thinking with the extraordinary case of the London stage actress who finds the power and courage to dedicate a show to Joseph Merrick in extremely valorizing circumstances, valorizing for Joseph Merrick, and so much so that he will decide to go to sleep like any normal person though he knew he would not wake up on the following morning.

249402,5,6300214044,"I hadn't heard much about The Elephant Man until I came across some reviews and I found myself intrigued. I am able to admit that The Elephant Man is one of the few films that made me shed a tear, and is a stunning, thought-provoking and underrated picture that deserved a much bigger audience than it got.
Based on the true story of John Merrick (John Hurt), a 19th-century Englishman afflicted with a disfiguring congenital disease. With the help of kindly Dr. Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins), Merrick attempts to regain the dignity he lost after years spent as a side-show freak.
It's very easy to feel sorry and love for John Merrick, and it is very easy to feel hate for the people who tortured him, and this really shows us that this film is able to display a heap of emotions and do in a brilliant and amazing way. Personally, I found Merrick much more beautiful than the people who laughed and made fun of him, because his heart and soul was so much in the right place that it made you believe his appearance was also, even though he seemed deformed, he was really just normal. Dr. Frederick Treves is portrayed excellently by a very determined Anthony Hopkins, and the supporting cast which includes Anne Bancroft, are splendid in never-better roles. But, it is John Hurt who steals the show, his performance is quite simply a masterpiece (just like this film) of controlled emotion, and is a performance that will leave forever in my mind.
Stunning, real, emotional and masterful, The Elephant Man awes, engages and jabs at the heart. This is one powerful movie that is one of a kind. I urge you to see it.",983577600,3,1619,4.6055363321799305
249403,5,6300214044,"I've always thought that cinema is supposed to provoke, challenge, disturb, and otherwise shake us from our mundane little lives.  No film does this better than ""The Elephant Man,"" one of the masterworks of modern cinema.  There are maybe a handful of films (and I've seen thousands) that I can honestly say are without flaws - this is one of them.  Why ""EM"" didn't win the best picture Oscar is beyond me.  Likewise, why John Hurt and David Lynch didn't win their respective Oscars is beyond me.  But the Academy wouldn't know a good film if it tripped over one.
Anyway, ""EM"" is profoundly moving, elegantly photographed, and rich with remarkable performances.  Rarely do movies elicit a lump of emotion in my throat, let alone tears.  This film managed to do both, and on more than one occasion.  I wouldn't expect today's film-going public to appreciate ""EM.""  Not enough car chases or explosions for most people.  And Jim Carrey's not in it.  But those of us left who still appreciate film as ART, or appreciate the stunning power of a truly great performance, or the splendid touch of a truly great director, need look no further than ""EM.""

In many ways, the world is still that way today, and that is why this film should be preserved and shown to each new generation so that they can learn compassion and realize that it is what is on the inside of an individual human being that counts, and not just how beautiful they are on the outside. Beauty is indeed only skin deep, and often just a mask. Joseph Merrick was a real person, he really had to live like that, and during a most difficult and judgemental time in history (the Victorian age) when people who thought themselves learned and above that which they did not understand were really just ignorant without cause. John Merrick was a beautiful angel, and this film will leave you feeling as if you knew him. John Hurt's performance as Mr. Merrick is truly remarkable, a masterpiece. Yes, the ending is sad, as was Joseph's life, but if you look at it with open eyes you will learn something from the film; it will teach you something very important about love and compassion, and empathy.",982454400,2,1168,4.462616822429907
249406,5,6300214044,"Ignore any of the criticism you may have heard of this film--that it employs voyeuristic exploitation, that it's overly sentimental, that it represents an early, less-advanced stage in the career of a brilliant filmmaker, David Lynch.  The simple truth of the matter is that anyone might have great difficulty naming a single film made since 1980 that represents so complete a mastery of the medium.
Despite much received wisdom proclaiming that film is limited to the external surfaces of reality, Lynch employs camera work, editing, and sound to conduct us deep into the innermost consciousness of John Merrick (the historic ""elephant man"").  That which produces revulsion at the initial recording of its grotesque, nauseating features (this is no moderately attractive human specimen such as the one  in ""Mask"") ultimately evokes sympathy, understanding, and love of the inextinguishable human spirit itself.
Lynch organizes the film around 3 challenging montage sequences--the opening one presents the birth of Merrick into a world of uncertainty and contradictions; the second takes us into the world of Merrick's living hell, with industrial smoke replacing the white clouds of the opening sequence; the 3rd is accomplished through a panning of the camera that seamlessly unites physical and metaphysical orders in its presentation of Merrick's sleep, thus resolving the conflicts in the first 2 sequences.
The film has minimal dialogue and only a fragmentary musical score, yet it represents one of the most imaginative, at once disturbing and intriguing, uses of sound in the history of cinema.  Perhaps only a well-produced DVD can fully disclose the ""sound of silence"" that characterizes both Merrick's inner and outer worlds, yet the subtle changes in audio ambience, together with the subliminal ""pounding"" that frequently reminds us of a dehumanized world, should be unmistakable even on VHS and low-fidelity equipment.
Finally, the acting is in perfect harmony with the filmmaker's purposes.  No individual ""sticks out.""  Heard's simple yet sympathetic Merrick, Anthony Hopkins' beautifully understated Dr. Treves, the supporting roles of Gielgud, Bancroft, and Wendy Hiller--all contribute to a sum so much greater than its parts as to defy description.  To say that this is one of the most underrated films ever made may be the biggest understatement one could ever make.",978825600,5,2387,5.452574525745257
249407,5,6300214044,"Despite the fact that ""The Elephant Man"" is about a grossly deformed man, it is truly one of the most beautiful movies ever made. Director David Lynch has peered into the souls of both the ""outcasts"" and those considered ""normal"" in our society. Lynch has never been better, and the same may also be said about actors John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins.
Would-be circus man Bytes has put The Elephant Man/John Merrick (Hurt) on display in the freak show, attempting to profit from another man's misery. Dr. Frederick Treves (Hopkins) ""saves"" Merrick from the evil Bytes, but what does he do with Merrick? Puts him on display in another freak show of sorts for a panel of doctors. Treves has again stripped Merrick of his dignity and tried to to profit from his misery. So who is worse? Bytes or Treves?
And this is only the first 15 minutes of the film...
What eventually saves Treves is that he actually gets to know Merrick. Behind the deformity he discovers a human being.
There are so many beautiful and touching moments in this movie: Merrick's awe at watching the play, Merrick removing the pillows from his bed so he can sleep like a normal person and, of course, Merrick trapped at the train station and shouting out ""I am not an animal!""
But my favorite moment comes when Merrick's fellow ""freaks"" in the circus help him escape. As they put him on a ship so he can hopefully find his way back home, the dwarf (Kenny Baker) says to him ""Good luck, my friend. And who needs it more than us?""

7805893,5,6300214044,"For David Lynch's second feature film, he directed an adaptation of the life of Joseph Merrick aka The Elephant Man, a real life Victorian era man who was born horribly disfigured yet became something of a media darling. The resulting film, 1980's The Elephant Man, is a truly superb film and a truly moving film. In it we have the late, great John Hurt as John Merrick (the name was different in this film) totally unrecognizable in all of that makeup. He is helped by a kindly English doctor, played by Anthony Hopkins is what is probably his first truly great film role. Also featured are Anne Bancroft, Wendy Hiller and Sir John Gielgud, among many other fine supporting players. But this film belongs to 2 people: John Hurt and David Lynch. This would be nothing without them.
  Hurt has the difficult job of just simply moving about in that makeup, which took most of a 24 hour day just to apply and remove. Yet he becomes the person he is playing like very few actors in the history of movies. You feel for him, you root for him, you sympathize with him, and most importantly you empathize with him. It's become almost cliche to say that we have all felt ugly, inside or outside, at some point in our lives. And it has become trite to say something like ""we're all beautiful on the inside"". But John Hurt's performance transcends triteness or mere cliche. It reaches the level of palpable emotion, raw and unfiltered. It's one that could move a stone statue to tears, and is one of the greatest acting performances in all of film history. Amazing that he lost the Oscar to De Niro for Raging Bull, which IS the greatest acting performance in all of film history IMHO. 1980 was pretty good year for movies, don't you think?
  And the other side of the coin is David Lynch. This was his second film after Eraserhead, that bizzaro freakout masterpiece from 1977. This is one of only two Lynch films that do not take place in current times, along with Dune. (Unless you want to count most of the ""Got a Light"" episode of Twin Peaks, Season 3). He was a brilliant choice for this film, which was produced by Mel Brooks of all people. The industrial nature of London circa 1888 is shown in true Lynchian fashion, as industrial images are a hallmark of his movies. The shooting in black and white was also an inspired choice. Could you imagine this film in color? Plus you get other Lynch hallmarks, like a camera that slowly moves through a room and hallways to create a sense of dread. And dream sequences, which bookend this film. It also sounds brilliant, as pretty much every David Lynch movie does. You can see in this film, along with Eraserhead and his numerous short films, the building blocks to a legendary film career being carefully placed and constructed. For example, did anyone notice the stars at the end of this movie, similar to the stars at the end of The Straight Story? It's been said that every director keeps making the same movie over and over again, and even though this one may not look it, it is pure David Lynch. An indispensable part of his oeuvre.
  One thing I must mention. Many critics, back then and now, have stated that the film's failing point is that it is too sentimental at times. This is most likely a reference to the use of Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings in the final scene. Keep in mind: this movie was made several years before Platoon helped make that music the epitome of mawkish sentimentality. Since then it has been used everywhere, from the solemnity of 9/11 memorial videos, to the ironic context of episodes of Seinfeld and Daria. But back in 1980, the music was pure and unsullied. And hence the scene it accompanies is also pure and unsullied. I find nothing sentimental about the scene, and I think it is the most moving and powerful part of the film. One of my favorite scenes of all time.
  All in all you really can't go wrong with this movie. It is far from boring, and doesn't have the slightest trace of a Merchant-Ivory film, which British period piece films can often suggest to the average film goer. It is a great movie, plain and simple. Great movies hold up over the years. And this one will continue to hold up over the years. Absolutely recommended.-----------------------PEACE",1520208000,,4252,4.570866141732283
