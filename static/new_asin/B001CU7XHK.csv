3520025,4,B001CU7XHK,"i bought this for my son.  he loves ghost stories, and the haunted history series is very entertaining, and not too scary.  we got this episode because we've been to some of the locations.  the only reason it doesn't get five stars is the length.",1250640000,2,246,4.4222222222222225
3520026,5,B001CU7XHK,"""Haunted Hawai'i"" is a must-see for both tourists/would-be tourists and kama'aina. Spiritual tales include the ""night marchers,"" the Goddess Pele, the ""choking ghosts,"" and Waimea Bay on Oahu's North Shore. Interwoven with these tales is a solid, albeit basic overview of Hawai'i history that viewers unfamiliar with Hawai'i will find useful.

Definitely worth watching!!",1233878400,3,371,5.87037037037037

3520036,5,B001CU7XHK,"This is one of my all time favorites in the series by The History Channel. Well narrated and the stories are wonderful and insightful.
The local cemeteries are covered as they have paranormal stories for each including a couple that died in a carriage accident and now haunt the locale. ~ St. James Cemetery.
The Valentines Day Massacre by the mob gangs during the ""tommy gun"" era.
The bricks that were behind the unfortunate men that got shot are known to bring exceptional bad luck if one has them in their possession.
A mysterious lady in blue haunts a tavern for years, seen standing in front of a music juke box by an employee one evening.
Bachelor's Grove Cemetery is also talked about in detail as is the nearby woods where an apparition of a standing 2 story farm house from long ago is known to have been seen.
A boys death at the hands of two teens is disturbing enough, but as the boy's ghost haunts his family crypt in the cemetery, the teens accused are found guilty and sentenced to Life in prison plus 99 years. One dies in prison and the other paroled, but later dies of cancer. The ghost is then not seen again.

I want to get the entire series of this show as I found it excellent! I have thus far 10 episodes. LOVE IT!! Highly recommended viewing!!",1439251200,,1267,4.414529914529915

3520039,5,B001CU7XHK,"I enjoyed this show,I'm fascinated by the supernatural and it's hard to find good documentaries on it, so I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this one, well worth the modest cost.",1433376000,4,188,4.7272727272727275
3520040,2,B001CU7XHK,OK but more talking about history than talking about hauntings and not much evidence proven to any hauntings. OK for the price but a bit disappointing.,1432598400,,151,4.846153846153846

3520059,3,B001CU7XHK,"This is an A&E series put onto DVD.  The focus is on supposedly haunted places
and the history behind them.  Unless you are very knowledgeable about US history,
you'll probably learn some things that you did not know (it doesn't matter whether
or not you believe in hauntings).  I even learned about a mass murderer in the
area where I grew up, that I had never heard of before.  So, if you like hearing
about the seedier side of US history, you might find it interesting.",1387670400,14,472,4.453488372093023

3520062,4,B001CU7XHK,"You can really see the roots of shows like the ghost hunters and ancient aliens in this series.

However, this set is a useful tool. I am a teacher and I am using the Salem section to reinforce the background in a unique and fun way (just time for Halloween, homecoming and the crucible). It is the right mix of scary and history and my kids are very interested in ghost, witches, and the devil. Also, the video did have a good bit of ""history"" with names and the Puritan mindset.

The graphics are great and it is really interesting. Now, as adult I did have hard time not rolling my eyes at the goofiness of it all (like ancient aliens) because it takes itself too seriously, but it was overall a good experience and I am glad for the set. I am going to watch the other episodes for fun because it is interesting to anyone who loves this kind of thing.

Now on the 2 disc you get 8 episodes Ghost of Gettysburg, Salem witch trails, murder castle, lost souls of pennhurst, Katrina Cannibal, a deadly possession, the torso murders, the Manson murders.

The price is high but I can see using it again.",1382918400,17,1100,4.325242718446602

3520064,5,B001CU7XHK,The book is full of information of haunted Chicago and more that we don't even realized  A must read book,1360972800,,105,4.25
3520065,3,B001CU7XHK,I was excited to see this come out as my husband and I took an 11-day Southern Caribbean cruise. I was disappointed they only covered a few of the islands. I was hoping for more islands and more coverage of the ghost stories.,1297987200,,225,4.255813953488372
3520066,4,B001CU7XHK,"Powerful portrayal of the haunted cemeteries and buildings in Chicago. The history of each haunted area, the possible candidate that became a ghost and the relevant incident(s) leading to his/her death or murder are portrayed very well. Interviews with individuals who have seen or experienced the presence of the ghosts, and descriptions by authors who have written books on the Chicago ghosts are remarkable.

The portrayal of Bachelor's Grove Cemetery is the spookiest. St James Cemetery is also very spooky.

The only drawback is that some of the major ghosts of Chicago are omitted. All in all, an excellent program.",1268697600,7,621,5.2
8289340,3,B001CU7XHK,Not as interesting as I had hoped. Eight 2012 episodes with run time approximately 6 hrs. Some stories I've already seen on regular television. There were only a few episodes that held my interest.,1520726400,,197,4.823529411764706

8289348,2,B001CU7XHK,"The original History Channel Haunted History was much better. this was as another reviewer put it mostly about murders. the only reason I give this 2 stars is because the episode Ghosts Of Gettysburg was very good (it's on youtube) but other than that I was not impressed. The episode on Pennhurst Asylum was very disturbing, I've heard went on inside asylums but seeing actual footage if the inside really boggles the mind. If you watch it I doubt you will a second time, honestly that's why I put it on swapadvd. I didn't even remotely wanna keep it at that point. pass this set up  and go get the original Haunted History shows and History Classics: History's Mysteries is very good too.",1487203200,3,690,4.609756097560975
