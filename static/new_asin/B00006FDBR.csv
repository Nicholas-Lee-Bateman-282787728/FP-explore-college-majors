8158667,1,B00006FDBR,"oh my, this movie was just wrong! I give it a single star for the australian girl-friend. You knew what was going to happen, before it happend, your typical horror movie that played with the ""boo effect"" that has gone to crap over the years. You have the actress who played: Switch, in the first matrix with Joshua leonard from the Blair Witch movies. Together, their acting clashes terribly. This movie had no substance to it, and the CGI didn't help it. It just made it more cheesy",1096588800,,483,4.5
8158668,1,B00006FDBR,I just rented this movie for the cover art hoping to get a nice surprise.  The script is just your average gate way to hell open by little kids.  I wouldn't even recommend it as a rental.  Bottom line is this movie is horrible avoid it like the plague.,1031529600,2,252,4.1020408163265305
