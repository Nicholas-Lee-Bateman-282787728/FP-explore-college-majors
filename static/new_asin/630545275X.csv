1041602,4,630545275X,"I liked it.  I liked how they all delt with the remaining Ginyu.  I don't mind the new voices, I understand (unlike most of the whiney revewers and buyers), by what ever means that led to Funimations termination with their  affiliation with pioneer, that some things would have to change.  Since  Funimation no longer has access to Poineer dubbing equipment, or its voice  talent, things would be off scale a little bit.  And I really don't care  anyway.  I'm just happy that fiftey new episodes are being translated and  aired here in america! The only problems I had with the new videos was the  mixing in the sound effects and voices.  The voices were too high and the  sounds were too low.  I keept hearing Vejita below a war cry while the huge  blast surrounding him sounded like no more than squeeking mouse in a  mousetrap.  That and the acting wasn't very good, though I do admire the  new actors accuracy in getting most of the characters orgional voices as  close as they could--with a few small exceptions.",931564800,,1017,4.612359550561798

1041605,5,630545275X,Any true dbz fan should love this. Cartoon Network has been keeping its dbz viewers in suspense and now we can get the video. It is great,927763200,,137,4.111111111111111
1041932,5,630545275X,I loved this tape. Especially the part where Captain Ginyu turned himself into a frog!,977097600,,86,4.8
1041933,5,630545275X,"OH MY GOSH. Let me take a deep breath. This is it. This is what all DBZ fans have been waiting for. We have been waiting for these DVDs forever.  This is it. It is DBZ uncut. Translation is perfect. Everything they are  saying is what they should truely be saying. I have creditble sites that  have told me this. The original Japanease soundtrack. Just hearing the  Funimation soundtrack next to the original makes me laugh. DBZ has long  been considered one of the top animes, and now everyone see what we are  talking about. And did i mention uncut. The VHS are not even really uncut.  Do you think Funi wants you to know that. These DVDs are truly uncut. I am  gonna collect the whole series. Don't buy any VHS DBZ. This is what you  have to put your money towards.",966384000,6,768,4.314685314685315
1041934,5,630545275X,"This is a great DVD for any and all Dragonball Z fans.  The only down side to the DVD is the fact that the horrid Funimation dub version is on the  same DVD.  Other than that there are no complaints.  Buy it, buy it right  now.",966384000,,227,3.847826086956522
1041935,5,630545275X,"You couldn't have picked a better DVD than this, it's completely uncut, with no rewrites in dialogue. Buy it now, I guarentee that you won't be sorry when you buy this. If your curious, or just want to compare, you can  watch the american version. If you don't like that version just go back to  watching the Japanese version. Our prayers have finally been answered!  Thank you God!",964224000,2,382,4.588235294117647
1041936,5,630545275X,"For all those people who haven't seen DBZ in its original form, you would be suprised how much was changed for the US version.  I personally think that the dubbers did a very poor job in trying to ""add value"" by  changing things.  A very poor business decision, in my opinion (I never  bought their dubbed tapes because of this).....but judge for yourself.  Buy  this dvd and see if the original is better.",964137600,,406,4.493150684931507

1041938,5,630545275X,This is what you should be spending your money on. It's the original Japanese version with exact English subtitles. This is the best thing to ever happen to DBZ in America. Stop wasting your time reading this review  and buy the DVDs now.,961372800,8,238,4.534883720930233
1041939,5,630545275X,Great DVD!!! Amazing sound quality and excellent video image. Not to  mention that now you can see the original japanese version unchanged. With  the original text and the original music. This is a must have DVD for all  Dragon Ball z fans out there.,961286400,,250,4.636363636363637
1041940,5,630545275X,"I thought DBZ was good in edited format, but now when they are also avaliable unedited they totally ROCK! Watching the unedited episodes gives a totally different feel to the series. The only thing I can remark on is  the changed voices, but you get used to that after 1-2 episodes. All  unedited episodes are a MUST for a DBZ-fan! If you get the edited version  you will regret it if you ever watch the unedited one.",957830400,,417,4.3896103896103895
1042156,4,630545275X,"I've waited months to see these episodes, and now find that none of them sound the same.  Vegeta, he sounds horrible now, where as he used to have a  voice to had all of the personality that he deserved.  Someone tell the  people who cut these to RE DO THEM!!!!!!  Get the right voices!  Also,  editing is way off.  In the whole series, they've taken out the best  scenes, thinking that they were too much for us.  They're not!!!  Ok, now  I'm going to watch the old ones and wait till they get it right...",941155200,10,506,4.2105263157894735

1042158,1,630545275X,"DBZ fans, this still ISN'T ENOUGH!!!! Just because the new englishe dubbed tape are on video and their uncut, doesn't mean it's gonna be uncut on TV. Infact, the UNCUT version is not all the way uncut. ON the UNCUT version,  Captain Ginyu, says: ""I'll be done like Dinner"" HA HA HA LoL!!!  That's like the most funniest remark EVER in DBZ. He REALLY says something  about him going to hell if he dies. CRAPimation is still going to show these  stupid eps on TV. And I mean STUPID. Why all of this? They think we can't  handle the violence and they treat us like babies. You wanna know  something? In the beggining eps of DBZ when Radditz came, and he took  Gohan, you know what CRAPimation edited out??? THEY EDITED OUT A BIT OF  TEARS FROM GOHANS EYES!!!!!!!!! THEY THOUGHT THAT THE TEARS WERE VIOLENT  TOO US!!!!! And, here is a stupid part, you know when the people die in  DBZ? Like Yamcha, Piccolo, etc when they die? Their bodies would dissapier,  & THAT'S NOT THE WAY IT GOES! CRAPimation thought that it was to scary  to actual so a live cartoon charector laying on the ground dead. And here  is one more stupid thing CRAPimation cutted out. Remember when Goku went to  the hospital? CRAPimation edited a part when Goku had to get a shot. And  for once reason: THEY THOUGHT A SHOT IN THE ARM WAS WAAAAAAAAYY TO VIOLENT  FOR US!!!!So here's some advice, ignore EVERY SINGLE english dubbed DBZ.  Buy a subtitled tape instead if you want some REAL DBZ.Can anyone forward  this message to FUNimation? OR like print my message and send it to them? I  want FUNimation to see what a HARDCORE DBZ fan thinks of their wasteful  crap they call, ""Anime."" They make it seem like a kiddie  cartoon.<Please don't e-mail me saying where to buy the subtitled tapes,  but if you would like to ask ANOTHER question, go ahead and e-mail me>",934329600,3,1829,4.4787878787878785
1042159,5,630545275X,I believe that keeping the same voices would have been excellent and i am sure funanimation would have if they could. But by the end of the tape you will probably be past the fact that the voices have changed. In fact you  might like them better. Vegeta and Nail are major highlights in this video.,932515200,,298,4.321428571428571
1042160,4,630545275X,"This is not the best, there still are more Dragonball Z episodes yet to come. This is the best of the Dragonball Z saga so far. The next to videos are much much better, which they entitle you to get into the Frieza saga.  This is a good movie along with Assualt but Goku could have and should have  gone Super Saiyan. He was about to and Ginyu stopped him. If you are a  hardcore DBZ fan or just a begining DBZ and Anime fan get this, it's great!  bo",931824000,,450,3.966666666666667

7890799,4,630545275X,"If you love DBZ and grew up watching the original Funimation dub on Toonami, you owe it to yourself to buy this DVD set.

PROS:

All episodes are uncut.

All episodes are dual audio (english with english bgm & original japanese with optional english subtitles)

Dale Kelly as Captain Ginyu and The Narrator as well as Mark Britten as Burter. (whose voices are dubbed over in all future releases. Brice Armstrong replaces Captain Ginyu, Chris Sabat replaces Burter, and Kyle Hebert replaces the narrator)

Dale Kelly is amazing as Captain Ginyu and Mark Britten is a more fitting Burter, not to mention Dale Kelly's beastly narrator voice.

The Captain Ginyu saga is short, but awesome.

CONS:

This was part of the first home video release of DBZ in North America, back when Funimation didn't own the rights to episodes 1-67 and movies 1-3, so the first 67 episodes are missing from this release, making it forever incomplete.

The majority of the recaps and next episode previews aren't included because Funimation couldn't/didn't get the rights.

The voice actors were just starting out at the time, so many of their performances are lacking (in particular Chris Sabat as Vegeta and Sean Schemmel as Goku. Schemmel does ""ok"" most of the time, but some of his lines come across as downright wooden)

The cover art for the set is downright lazy. All it is is screencaps from the show with text and a title slapped on over it.

Some of the script changes are downright stupid. For example, Vegeta says: ""This is going to be easier than coloring inside the lines!"", Frieza says: ""Any last words before you go the way of the dodo?"", ect.

Funimation has a VERY bad habit of adding additional unnecessary (and downright stupid) dialogue into their shows. Example: (Jeice has just been punched by Goku) Burter: Jeice, are you alright? Be careful Jeice, or you'll stain your gloves.",1388966400,,1876,4.825
7890800,5,630545275X,This fills in a lot of the gap between the Namek and Frieza sagas.,1140480000,,66,3.7857142857142856
7890801,5,630545275X,"This is an excellent DVD in all respects save the cover. (The cover is incredibly stupid if you didn't notice. An irrelevent screen shot.) There are two versions on this DVD, like all Dragon Ball Z DVD's except for Saiyan/Namek Sagas. This is actually the second DVD of the first uncut saga in American Dragon Ball.
The two versions it contains in the English Dubbed version and the Japaneese Subbed version. I reccommend watching both, although some hardcore fans only watch the Subbed. Even though most of the dialog is changed in the Dubbed version (and the music is much worse) it is still a very fun watch and highly enjoyable.
The DVD and story itself is really good. It has an exciting battle between Goku and Ginyu and the demise of Ginyu is really great and pretty funny too. It's an excellent DVD and I highly reccommend it.",1072742400,,834,4.604026845637584
7890802,5,630545275X,"This is a great DVD cause first off you get 4 episodes instead of 3, so already its off to a good start. Second you get crafty Captain Ginyu. Then you add alot of Vegeta kicking butt and then you get even better. Last but not least you add a hilarious ending to the whole thing and you got yourself a winner. Please buy this DVD today its a real treat.",1050278400,,352,3.971830985915493
7890803,3,630545275X,"The Japanese version of DBZ is infinatly better than the English, so I would reccomend buying this instead of a VHS. The whole thing is kind of plain (no previews, boring menu, and only 2 chapters per episode) so only get it if you really like the Ginyu Saga or if you're trying to make a complete DBZ collection.",1019260800,,313,4.322033898305085
7890804,4,630545275X,"This DVD contains four episodes of the fight between Goku and Captain Ginyu.  Nail tries to stall by ""fighting"" Frieza.  The menu is the worst I've seen and exactly the same as Captain Ginyu - Assault.",1006387200,,201,4.555555555555555
