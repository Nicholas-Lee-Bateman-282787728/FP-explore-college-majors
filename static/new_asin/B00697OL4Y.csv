8495150,5,B00697OL4Y,"As a Jewish preschool Morah, I have to say this is an unbelievable DVD depicting sefer Bereishis.  The music, the scenarary, the costumes are fantastic. I love the children involved in this DVD.  I show this video on Fridays before our Shabbos party to review the weekly parsha.  They love it and ask to watch it again and again!",1382486400,,329,4.5423728813559325
