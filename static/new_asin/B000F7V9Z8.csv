8118772,5,B000F7V9Z8,"Not a ""chop'socky"" film but an actual Martial arts drama. There is a certain elegance that these older Shaw B films have that I was unaware of. Even thought the plot is fairly simple and straight forward, the characters are real and likable. Even the villain, as twisted and evil as he is, is still a guy you really can't hate. The action is old school methodical style but the whole film has an effortless flow that draws you in.

Yes we all know who and what Red Sun is. But considering they are giving us an UNCUT (unike the Dragon Dynasty release)  film
with acceptable (great) image quality...well...
Expect the audio to switch to original language for a few seconds here and there. This is the lost footage that was never translated so no subs for these parts either.",1394928000,,773,4.514285714285714
8118773,3,B000F7V9Z8,"While the movie itself is excellent...the audio track leaves something to be desired.  As awith a number of other titles this one jumps back and forth between the English and Chinese language tracks...with no sub-titles.  AND...at about 55 minutes into the move there is a loud beep.  I don't know if no one bothers to check the master they are using to copy from, or if there is a problem with something else in the process but they really need to go back and recheck these things.",1390608000,,482,4.517241379310345
8118774,4,B000F7V9Z8,"THis is one of my favorite Martial Arts movie, it has an excellent plot and great fighting.  What more can you ask for?  There was only one problem, some parts in the DVD I received has the characters speaking in Chinese(that was weird).",1218067200,2,237,4.488372093023256
8118775,5,B000F7V9Z8,"This movie is almost perfectly remastered.  The sound quality is loud, picture is clear, and the color is vibrant.

Just to confirm, Morgoth's points are correct:
-It does change from the english dub to chinese dialogue two separate times in the first fight scene versus the Iron Boat Clan.

- And there is a short loud beep in the movie where the characters are in a grassy field talking.

These are two very small things to an otherwise great movie!",1216166400,,451,4.6
8118776,5,B000F7V9Z8,"This is one of the few movies I remember from waaaaay back when I was around 15 or so, watching ""Black Belt Theater"" on Friday nights at 10 o'clock.  The thing that makes this movie so memorable is the fact that it doesn't follow the standard ""wimp finds teacher, learns Kung Fu, teacher gets killed by Bad Guy, wimp gets butt kicked by Bad Guy, wimp finds another teacher, learns UNBEATABLE KUNG FU STYLE, and avenges teacher's death"" storyline.

Take a very good storyline, and then throw in Alexander Fu Sheng and Ti Lung, and you've got a movie that anyone who ever tried to mimic the kung fu fights (complete with sound effects, and you know who you are...)would have to watch over and over.",1204243200,,696,4.515873015873016
8118777,4,B000F7V9Z8,"This film came as a bit of a surprise.  A good story, good acting, good fights, and a great pace.  I won't say it's perfect, but I can't think of too much that would have made it better.  Maybe if they laid off of some of the ""pause-before-impact"" photography, but that's only used a couple of times, and briefly.  There's some obvious coincidence that I could do without, but then the story wouldn't work.

Ti Lung is a man who (after a change of conscience) has defected from his former gang, the 13 Eagles (a subsidiary of the Iron Boat Clan), who raised and trained him since childhood for their own sadistic acts.  Alexander Fu Sheng is a man, searching for revenge, who helps Ti Lung fight off his former brothers.  Many fights ensue, mostly with weapons.  My man, Ti, uses triple irons, one of my favorites.

The picture and sets are as beautiful as anything I've seen from Shaw Brothers.  This whole movie is gorgeous.  I thought I was buying the Red Sun version, but got another, whose distributor is anonymous.  Other critics have mentioned some forgivable flaws in the Red Sun version, so I may have made out because there are NONE on this one.  To you old-schoolers who haven't caught this yet, get a mitt.  4.5

8118778,5,B000F7V9Z8,"This is one of my favorite movies ever, kung fu or not.  The tale of a runaway reformed gang member being joined by a wandering stranger has a great twist.  The martial arts are second to none, with masterful displays of every weapon you can think of.

Ti Lung and Fu Sheng are at their best in this movie, both as martial artists and as actors.  That's right, the acting between these two is fantastic.

You won't just fastforward to the fight scenes in this one.  It's the Godfather of Kung Fu movies.",1195516800,5,503,4.354838709677419
8118779,5,B000F7V9Z8,"the movie is  about a kung fu expert running from his  enemies.he decides to change his life for the good because he was raised to be evil,bad. another twist is the person he travels with who he doesnt know is another who want  him dead. together they work to find the truth and  kill the ultimate  master. get this. its a classic,great story,sick fights and shocking ending.  peace out.......
