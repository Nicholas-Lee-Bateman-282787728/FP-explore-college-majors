8629674,5,B002D4GOI8,"I'm almost 62 and a friend of mine who is 65 do the beginner portion of this video every other day or so.  Exercises are simple and work.  We were both a little wobbly when we started, but today we noticed that neither of us are having trouble with our balance doing the exercises.  We've only been doing these for less than a month.  The video characters are fun to exercise with and it's the first exercise program we knew we could do.  We are both very very overweight and my friend had knee surgery a couple years ago, so we can't do just anything. I highly recommend this video if you hate to exercise but know you need to.",1471305600,2,628,4.2
