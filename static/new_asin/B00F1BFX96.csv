5962866,5,B00F1BFX96,Love castles to begin with; and all the inner workings of them.  This is a fascinating look at a historical castle.,1393286400,,115,4.476190476190476
5962867,5,B00F1BFX96,"'Secrets of the Tower of London' presented viewers with the origin of this London landmark, along with its history up to today. I especially appreciated the opportunity to learn about the lives of those who now 'guard' and take care of it, along with views of areas not open to the general public.",1391385600,6,297,4.622641509433962
5962868,5,B00F1BFX96,"This is a 60 minute film, with English subtitles that tells the story of The Tower. With the exception of showing the Crown Jewels (cameras are not allowed) the cameras go into almost every nook and cranny of this historical monument.  Except it is also shown to be a home to some - the guards, the Beefeaters and we also hear their story as well as that of the ravens.

Aerial views and even Tower Bridge are shown. There are very few talking heads - (interviews that go on and on, just showing the person narrating their story). Instead we are led around the grounds and into various rooms and told their history and significance, even about the menagerie that used to be a tourist attraction - especially an elephant, that was given a gallon of wine a day to help him keep warm. At least he, as we are told lived a short, happy, drunken life.

The narration and sound, as well as the photography are excellent. Lovers of history, England and London will enjoy this film.",1390608000,11,973,4.455056179775281
5962869,3,B00F1BFX96,"William the Conquerer successfully invaded England(the only one), and built the Tower of London in 1099. For a thousand years, the mighty white towers guarded the land. Here PBS opens the secret doors; and  reveals to the public(for the first time) the prison chamber where Sir Thomas More was held for a year, before he was murdered. Thomas More rebuked King Henry the VIII(and his new religion), and paid a mighty price. Here also is the courtyard chopping-block, where Henry the VIII sent his former wives who....eh....let him down.....PBS films the Royal Palace, the royal mint, the site of the royal menagerie, and more. Sir Walter Raleigh was an English explorer and writer who was imprisoned in the Tower of London in 1603. Some years ago, I toured Tower grounds and was shown Sir Raleigh's lofty prison home. But here it is not photographed by PBS. Also, there are no shots of the Armory's massive musket and pistol collection(A sight to see). PBS's ""Secrets of the Tower of London"" is a professional, sometimes grim documentary. I was disappointed not to see the Royal Crown Jewels, valued at 46 billion dollars(They may be priceless). The Royal Crown Jewels are not filmed. Naturally. It is illegal.",1386806400,7,1209,4.926470588235294
5962870,5,B00F1BFX96,"This is an intriguing look at one of England's most enduring historic places: The Tower of London. Royal plalace, royal mint, royal menagerie, infamous site of royal executions & the Crown Jewels ~~ The Tower of LOndon is all of these as well as home of the Beefeaters.  It not only provides a look at the Tower's 900+ year history, it gives a rare glimpse of the Beefeater's life inside the Tower as well. I lived in England for 8 years & visited the Tower often & never failed to learn something new about this historic shrine.",1383782400,13,529,4.453608247422681
5962871,5,B00F1BFX96,"Really well done production, very informative and interesting. This is a must for history buffs. You'll want to visit after you see this, or you'll want to see this after you visited to see what you missed. Excellent!",1434412800,3,217,4.7368421052631575
5962872,4,B00F1BFX96,I had seen this movie before. It is really not so much secrets but little known history to the Tower. Most of what is talked about is fairly widely known.,1430870400,,154,4.166666666666667
5962873,5,B00F1BFX96,"Great video. Lots of great info, interesting topics within the Tower. I really enjoyed the casual interviews with the Yeoman Warders. Our daughter used this to get a feel for the Tower before researching for a school project. It was appropriate for our 7th grader, but might not be for younger ones (particularly the section about torture and executions). Overall this is an interesting look at the Tower.",1426291200,,405,4.970588235294118
5962874,5,B00F1BFX96,exactly what we saw but more in depth-nice to see again,1420675200,,55,4.090909090909091

5962879,5,B00F1BFX96,I saw this on PBS last month and jumped to buy it for my woman friend who loved re-living the tour for her as she gushed with excitement pointing at everything that she had seen so many years ago but this was done in 2013. An update in dress and autos but the British accents were still the SAME!,1403654400,5,296,4.033898305084746
5962880,5,B00F1BFX96,"several years ago, I spent a day touring the Tower of London - after viewing this DVD I realize there was much that I missed - this is far better than fighting the crowds - it's well filmed and gets the viewer into corners of the Tower that might be unknown to the visitor - would love to see a similar DVD on Windsor Castle",1399507200,8,324,4.0
8611416,5,B00F1BFX96,Excellent Program. Rented a copy at the public library and decided I wanted one for myself. Highly recommended.,1508284800,,111,5.222222222222222
8611417,4,B00F1BFX96,Enjoyed very much!,1505174400,,18,5.333333333333333
8611418,3,B00F1BFX96,"The program claims that there was only one attempt to steal the crown jewels, that being in 1671 by a Colonel Blood.  For political reasons, or whatever, they seem to have forgotten the 1967 attempt by Lord fFogg and his gang.",1492732800,,226,4.512195121951219
8611419,5,B00F1BFX96,"Interesting and entertaining account of a most daunting and perhaps in modern times, most ""taken for granted"" medieval structure in England. The Yeoman Warders featured in the show were the same ones we saw and listened to on a very early morning visit to the Tower in 2016. So I see this DVD as a nice piece of memorabilia from what was a MOST CRACKING English holiday!",1490486400,,370,4.537313432835821
8611420,4,B00F1BFX96,Having visited with my sister back in 1999 amongst crowds of people I missed some of the backstory so it was interesting to watch this documentary to fill in the blanks.,1474675200,,169,4.483870967741935
8611421,5,B00F1BFX96,"After visiting the Tower in 2008, this was a great review of what we saw and a wonderful look back at the history within.  We enjoyed it throughly!  Thank you.",1470441600,,159,4.266666666666667
