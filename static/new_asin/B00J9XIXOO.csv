8649153,5,B00J9XIXOO,"This video is great! Don't be fooled into thinking you only want these designs for St. Patrick's Day. The rainbow you will use again and again, the construction on the leprechaun makes him perfect for any human figures, and Holly tells you how to use the pot of gold for other holidays!

Holly's video is perfect for new twisters AND advanced ones.  Her tip section is brilliant. Her teaching style is clear and enjoyable.",1395964800,,422,4.6891891891891895
