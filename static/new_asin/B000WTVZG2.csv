2991782,5,B000WTVZG2,"Good FAMILY movie.
It will be a reference point for family discussions about life, values, even death of a parent.
Best of all, no part of this movie is not child friendly.

It didn't ""hold"" my older girls attention....but I bet she will want to watch it again.
I bought the book too and hope to start it soon.",1200787200,14,310,4.254237288135593
2991783,1,B000WTVZG2,"I had never read or knew of ""The Redemption of Sarah Cain"" until I had seen the trailer for ""Saving Sarah Cain"" on another DVD.  I borrowed a copy of the book and read it in preparation for when the movie itself would be on DVD.  I bought it and watched it last night, and I will be throwing it in the trash.  What a waste of $18!!  The sexual inuendo is one thing that bothered me; I also had to mute it many times during transitions as they loudly played rock type music.

As for the story itself, Ivy DID leave a will, the children never left Lancaster County(much less the state of PA), Sarah becomes born again, and those are only a few of the major discrepancies I found.

While there were some cute and funny parts, (which were not in the original book), they don't make up for the shortcomings of the story otherwise.  Why did Mr. Landon even bother with this book, if he was going to butcher it so badly??",1200787200,18,914,4.188571428571429
2991784,5,B000WTVZG2,"I've read only a couple of Beverly Lewis's books, but even seeing the trailer for this movie on another DVD inspired me to look for the book this movie is based on (""The Redemption of Sarah Cain""). Our family enjoyed this movie very much. We're always looking for wholesome movies, and this one fit the bill. It was touching and well-acted. I liked the ending, too.",1200614400,9,365,4.545454545454546
2991785,5,B000WTVZG2,I was hesitant to buy this movie since I love the book by Lewis and thought no one could make a film to do it justice. I also live in Western PA among Amish and know many well. I didn't think they could be portrayed right either. I was so wrong! Landon did an excellent job! I cried! This movie is so touching! The acting is EXCELLENT! The story of redemption shines through clearly. I have to buy this movie for many who feel like Sarah in the beginning...hurt by life and very hard toward God and others...this movie shows the way back home to God & family... We need more movies like this!,1200096000,79,592,4.201754385964913

2991801,3,B000WTVZG2,"The children in this movie are adorable, especially the youngest daughter.  The eldest daughter, played by Abigail Mason, sometimes came across too strong and overly dramatic at times, in contrast to the main character, portrayed by Lisa Pepper, who didn't seem to act with much depth. Being able to see a morally clean and Christian movie is a breathe of fresh air.  What grabbed my heart the most was the exceptional music.",1488585600,,425,4.888888888888889

2991841,4,B000WTVZG2,"A wonderful, bittersweet story and well worth watching.
The writing did not carry the strength of the story nor create enough realistic creative tension in the story arc.
The directing felt soft and cliche at times--even though I think the actors were well cast. Sarah was the weakest--she didn't offer the depth in moments that were critical.",1463702400,,343,5.035087719298246

2991885,5,B000WTVZG2,"Loved it! I love movies about the Amish, and this particular setting that showed what might happen if Amish children had to adapt in the secular world was both touching and gratifying, since I think the Amish have a lot of good ideas about how to raise children and have a commendable lifestyle. I thought it was great that the middle children both became accepted and admired by their peers for their inherent gifts and good character. I thought it was good how Sarah was able to work through her sadness about her past by entering a closer relationship with her nieces and nephews. Loved the story and the ending was satisfying, too. A typical Michael Landon Jr. film - something akin to a Hallmark movie.",1444521600,,707,4.619047619047619
2991886,3,B000WTVZG2,"This is totally different from the book. In the novel, The Redemption of Sarah Cain, Sarah stayed in Lancaster to care for the children. And came to faith.

I rented this movie because I loved the book, The Redemption of Sarah Cain and I can trust movies from Michael Landon Jr. to be good movies.  But I was disappointed with this movie.  While it was a nice story, it was hardly based on the book at all.  The job Sarah has is different, she does the opposite with the children as in the book and the story of the two lifestyles and true redemption of Sarah is almost non- existent.  I gave this a 3 star review because it is still a nice movie, but I am disappointed I paid for it.",1425168000,,586,4.150442477876106

2992009,5,B000WTVZG2,This is a great movie.  I have watched it many times.  My one complaint is that they deleted the scene of Hanna doing a seashell prayer with Sarah.

2992013,5,B000WTVZG2,"This is a wonderful, heart-warming, uplifting, godly movie. Our family loved it, just loved it. The movie is very deep, but it also has some humor. I can't say enough good things about this film.

One person said that as an evangelical Christian they wished the movie had mentioned Jesus and had shown baptism and salvation, and that these things are missing from the movie. But the movie does mention Jesus--and in a very positive way. The movie also mentions salvation, at least twice.  True, it doesn't show baptism, but it's a very godly, uplifting movie. It's not in-your-face overt in its religious message, but that message is clear and unmistakable.

I highly recommend this movie. The acting is superb. The screen work is first class. The plot is fascinating. And the message is wholesome, uplifting, and even spiritual.",1422748800,,829,4.9496402877697845

Moreover, I know how special it is since it is the only movie in several years that my wife has stayed awake throughout, eyes wide open while we viewed from the couch... the place that normally causes her to catch only 5 minutes of anything else.  We discovered this movie through listening to Pandora, streaming it into our stereo.  The music caught our ear during dinner, and we quickly left our chairs to study the screen for the title.  The theme song is that beautiful.  We suspected it was from a movie, and went in search of it.  The sound track is as much a treasure as the show.

I also don't know much about the Amish community, so this opinion is based entirely on my enjoyment for the movie, and not on facts. No, the lead actors weren't the best, but they did a good job, and I enjoyed their roles. The children were better, and excellent with their emotions. The story was heart-wrenching (I cried a couple of times), and I came away feeling uplifted. What I enjoyed most was the contrast portrayed between living a quiet life in a quiet community versus life in the big city. During the time in Portland, I kept thinking about how much better the children's lives had been at home, and I was overjoyed when everything worked out the way it should have. It shows how children struggle with their identities in a world that is already unfriendly to ""normal"" children, let alone kids from different backgrounds. All in all, time well spent. I highly recommend this as a family movie.",1392681600,,983,4.52808988764045

2992190,5,B000WTVZG2,"This is one powerful movie that somehow manages to transcend the wide chasm between mainstream and message. The acting is superb, the writing is fresh and believable, and the production qualities are top notch. Considering the unlikely premise, this had all the makings of just another manipulative barf bag of Hollywood drivel. But in the sensitive hands of Michael Landon, Jr., it speaks to the audience with the voice of truth. Can I single out one performance above all the others? No way. The kids are wonderful, Elliott Gould hits a home run, Tom Tate is convincing and likable in a thankless supporting role, and Lisa Pepper is absolutely ""real,"" causing us to see her character as an actual human being instead of a screen persona. Resembling a young Jennifer Aniston, she knows just how far to take her character before crossing the line into screen histrionics. Terrific! Mark McKenzie's music, while not quite reaching the sublime heights of ""The Last Sin Eater"" (2007) is lovely and unobtrusive, at times punctuating the dramatic moments with a light and never maudlin touch. Even the high school students are not the expected stereotypes. It is clear that Landon set out to craft a special film of honesty, solid values, and cinematic integrity, and he succeeded brilliantly on all counts. I recommend ""Saving Sarah Cain"" without reservation.",1366934400,2,1355,5.053571428571429
2992191,5,B000WTVZG2,"Wonderful movie!  Endearing, sweet, tender, loving.  I recommend it to all.  It's good family entertainment.  We could learn a lot from the Amish way of life!",1366848000,,158,4.961538461538462
2992192,4,B000WTVZG2,Just a little melodramatic with the whole kids-crying thing.  But very sweet and worth watching.  I recommend this movie for families and couples.,1365552000,,146,5.304347826086956
2992193,2,B000WTVZG2,"""Saving Sarah Cain"" has an arresting premise -- what if a worldly, self-absorbed New Yorker  (I'm assuming that's what the city is) was forced to become legal guardian to her five nieces and nephews -- who happened to be Amish? The contrasting values and lifestyles between her and her wards would conceivably make a first-rate comedy-drama. Unfortunately, this film takes that potential and throws it away, saddling it with forced, stilted dialogue, a director who casts a gloom over the whole project, and hiring mediocre actors and actresses. The only exceptions are Abigail Mason as Lyddie, the oldest child who takes the position that if it isn't Amish, the siblings will have  nothing whatever to do with it, and Danielle Chuchran Anna Mae, the middle girl who finds herself torn between the way she was raised and her attraction to a secular lifestyle. Elliot Gould also turned in a first-rate performance, but that goes without saying.
Unfortunately, the rest of the cast gives performances that are either at or below average. True, this is mostly through no fault of their own -- despite the screenwriters' attempts, the supporting characters never veer beyond stereotypes. The children are admirably fleshed out, often at the expense of Sarah Cain (a pity, because she's the film's eponymous heroine) -- although whether that's the fault of the writers, director, or actress is difficult to determine.
Basically, ""Saving Sarah Cain"" is not completely without merit, but it's still hard for me to recommend that someone spend two hours watching it when they could be watching a much better movie.
If it's a decent Christian film you're after, you're much better off ""Saving Sarah Cain"" for later, and putting on ""Facing the Giants"" instead, a film so well-crafted one may well think it's an award-winning, studio-produced indie drama instead of a ridiculously low-budget church project.",1365465600,2,1896,5.152597402597403
2992194,5,B000WTVZG2,"I loved the book by this title and was looking forward to seeing the movie ""like the book.""  Although it is certainly based on the book, it had many variations; primarily, that Sarah took her Amish nephews and nieces to the big city.  In the book, she stays in their Amish home in their Amish town.  It was a bit disappointing that the movie portrayed two of the Amish children trying to ""fit in"" at their new city school, as the book had the children remain utterly faithful to their roots.  But the movie was still very enjoyable and had a logical, rounded out, happy ending.  Not quite like the book, but a great story just the same.",1365292800,,636,4.3559322033898304

2992207,1,B000WTVZG2,"I have read all of Beverly Lewis' books.  The Redemption of Sarah Cain was my least favorite, but still an enjoyable book.  There was not much similarity comparing the movie to the book.  In the book Sarah is redeemed from spending time among her nieces and nephews and the other amish by living in Lancaster Co with them.  She is struck by the way they live, their simple ways and their complete trust in God's divive providence and this is how she comes to terms with something horrible that happened in her past.  I understand there may be issues with the amount of time in a typical movie, but there is so much departure from the book that it should not even be associated with it.  I may have liked it better had I never read the book.  I was looking forward to some of Lewis' characters come to life, but there were too many inconsistencies and omissions.

2992213,5,B000WTVZG2,"When I first heard of this, I was hesitant to check it out, knowing it was a very independent movie (yes, Fox Faith Films is very independent, unlike 20th Century Fox, so it's more like a Christian-based Fox Independent), I was thinking it'd have a seriously cheesy visual filter (sorry, Kendrick Brothers, but I can't help but think of Flywheel stating that), yet I checked it out from the local library, just in case. To my pleasant surprise, it was a real good visual filter along with a nice storyline.
Yes, its Christian (don't let the 1-star reviewers who hate the momentary cleavage drive you away, they can't see a good movie for a single moment), but it's nt like it's preaching to the choir stupid. In fact, thouh my great-grandmother was Amish (so my mom has more experience around her than I did), my mom never complained about a single moment wih the Amish family (actually, we all laughed at the Amish twist of the Wizard of Oz one-liner). And, though my family is devoutly Christian, we had nothing bad to say about the forementioned cleavage. For one, there's not enough to incite lust (at least, not for me and my brother), for another, even if it were, it's not there long enough (nor being camera-ogled) for me to consider fantasizing. Period. I also appreciated the social visual symbolism of innocence nearing the brink of corruption and being confused on how things work in the world (specially when a former Amish boy is seen dresses as a goth and smoking, revealing that no one is safe from human nature).
One curious train-of-thought, though: sinc the eldest Amish niece is sixteen, I was surprised that she wasn't on Rumspringa (it's an actual Amish tradition for all teens, 16-20, to go on, then they decide on their own if they'll stick with the Amish church or stay in the Outside World while having connections with family), but I suppose liberties had to be taken for the story.
Overall, due to that slight hitch, I'd giv this a 4.75/5",1328918400,,1966,4.6685878962536025

2992215,5,B000WTVZG2,"This movie is based on the book by bestselling author, Beverly Lewis. It is a well-made movie with strong redemption themes. Sarah Cain is given custody of her nieces and nephews when her sister dies. However, there is a huge difference between Sarah's life and the life her sister led. Sarah is on the fast track as a journalist in Portland, Oregon. She has only herself to worry about and is set on being a well-known syndicated columnist. Her sister, Ivy, on the other hand, had joined the Amish and her main focus was her family.

When Sarah receives the news, she has no idea how her five Amish nieces and nephews are going to fit into her neat and tidy self-absorbed life. Add into the mix Sarah's dysfunctional upbringing and her dedicated fiance, who wants nothing more than to marry Sarah and spend his life with her.  So Sarah decides to bring her nieces and nephews to Portland - away from the life they've known. How will this affect them?

This movie has many great discussion opportunities. Among them are greed, selfishness, temptation, following the crowd, death, and what's really important in life. Is it money and a career? Or is the little lives an adult can shape and mold for God's glory?

Younger children will not understand the plot and will likely be frightened by the death of the mom (although how she died is not shown). Therefore, I would highly recommend it for those ages tween to adult. This is a movie that will stick with you long after you've watched it. Kudos to Michael Landon, Jr. for directing another film void of violence and objectionable language.

2992220,1,B000WTVZG2,This so called 'Christian' movie was not about Christ at all. How could Sarah find redemption or salvation without turning from sin to faith in Christ? Instead- the movie depicted that her acceptance of this simplier way of life was somehow her 'salvation' The most shocking during family viewing was the zoning in of the camera onto a very seductive lady's cleavage! And how a fellow employee kept lusting after this lady. The 'nice' story-line was ruined. How many young boys would watch the show simply to arouse their own curiosity! Christians should understand that lust (of the heart) equals the act. Are we to chuckle and take lightly the 'sin' of immoral behavior that the Bible depicts as wickedness?Christians should influence one another into a life of holiness and righteousness -not leading the flock back into the strongholds of sin.,1288828800,6,847,5.01418439716312

2992242,5,B000WTVZG2,"In a way this movie is a reversal of A Stranger Among Us. Instead of an outsider visiting an isolated religious community, members of that community visit the outside.
I have long admired the Amish for their steadfast keeping of their faith in the midst of an alien world. And for their colorful traditions. In this movie we show the clash between the two worlds.
The plot is somewhat predictable. A jaded columnist by a curious chain of circumstances, ends up as the guardian of an Amish family. The Amish learn to live among ""English"" and endure tests to their integrity with varying success. In the process, the collumnists, Sarah Cain, becomes a better and less cynical person. This plot has been seen a thousand times; that isn't really the point. It works because it is good when well done and it was well done here. It was a great movie.
My favorite character was Lyddie the big sister. She was pretty, and had integrity and strong leadership qualities. She could have raised the whole brood herself and in fact Sarah would have been smarter just to delegate almost everything to her.",1238025600,,1091,4.6875

However, I was disappointed in the poor and uninspired acting of Elliot Gould and Tess Harper. Their ""star status"" brought nothing to  the movie at all. As far as I am concerned, the rest of the cast were better than these two (especially Lisa Pepper). They should have gone with lesser known actors for these two roles, and used the budget difference to totally revamp the movie. The beginning and ending were fine, but the entire middle was a huge disappointment.
This movie falls short of being a truly good classic because of the bad plot in the middle. The best part of the movie was the ""flash-back"" to the main character's childhood memories on the beach. That was incredible and made the entire movie worth watching!  All in all, this movie shows that Michael Landon Jr. has tremendous potential as a director.",1237507200,,994,4.706896551724138

The accents were terrible (Lyddie's was the only one that pulled it off throughout the whole film), they totally changed the character's personalities, namely Caleb and Josiah and even the main character, Sarah! Changing the plot and characters so much just didn't make the story 'gel' together right. It came across that the only way to be a good christian is to be plain which is way off and anyway their was no mention of Christ anyway.

Her sister and children were Amish, so on top of everything, there are strong cultural differences.

This is a powerful story about selfless love, a higher call than simply what we personally want.  I found it very touching emotionally and inspiring to live for other's sake.  We desperately need these reminders in today's culture.

There was absolutely no reason to have their cleavage, and more, showing. (What was the purpose?)  The story would have been just as powerful as far as getting the point across of the differences between the Amish and the city people without their cleavage showing and the tight clothes.  This has been billed as a family movie, but we would NOT recommend this movie to ANYONE because of the immodest dress.  We will not watch it again.  Also, I was quite disappointed that there are so many reviews claiming it was a movie you could watch with your family, seemingly ignoring the immodest dress.

This is one of those rare cases where the film is so much better than the book. I am so thankful that Michael Landon Jr. made the changes that he did!

This is a great ""family-friendly"" movie that I am so glad to own. The actors are all great and the story really draws you in. I can watch it over and over again!",1210550400,9,592,4.130434782608695
2992261,1,B000WTVZG2,"Having read Beverly Lewis' book, ""Saving Sarah Cain"", I was deeply disappointed in the movie.  From the very beginning the story line diverged from the book.  The book explored the dynamic of Sarah Cain's arrival and acceptance of the ""plain"" lifestyle and her coming to understand the Amish people from living among them while struggling with the dilemma of what was to become of the children.  I believe if the movie had followed the storyline of the book it would have been more compelling and certainly not as disappointing as the movie.  If you have read and enjoyed the book as I did do not view the movie as you will most probably come away terribly dissatisfied.",1210464000,4,670,4.700854700854701

Lisa Pepper, whom I've never heard of before, does a good job in the lead as does Abigail Mason and the other kids. Elliott Gould is good too, and David Clennon appears briefly.

Unfortunately, while the movie starts out very good, by the last half hour or so it turns into another sappy Hallmark style movie. If you like that sort of thing, you'll love it. If you don't, you may enjoy most of the movie anyway.",1209686400,,1044,6.352112676056338
2992263,5,B000WTVZG2,Very enjoyable family movie. The differences between the Amish lifestyle and what we consider normal today make for a very different contrast.

2992264,1,B000WTVZG2,I'm a die hard Beverly Lewis fan and have read every book she has written. I bought the book The Redemption of Sarah Cain and I LOVED IT. While reading the book I noticed the bits in there that told about the movie. I never knew there was a movie. After reading the book I went to the local Blockbuster and rented the movie. Well let me tell you I was soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo disappointed because the movie doesn't follow the book. Also I thought the actress(?) who played Sarah was terrible. That's my two cents. PLEASE READ THE BOOK BEFORE WATCHING THE MOVIE - MAYBE AFTERWARDS AND THEN YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.,1207785600,3,626,4.598214285714286
2992265,3,B000WTVZG2,"Two stars for the film, one star (extra) for the stunning cinematography, especially the flashback scene of Sarah and older sister, Ivy, as children, frolicking at the seashore.  As another reviewer commented, that scene was ""beautiful, ethereal, evocative, and expertly photographed and edited"", and if not the rest of the film, this sequence is worth watching again and again.  It is too bad the rest of the movie wasn't more subtle in its emotion (as in the case when Sarah, along with boyfriend, Bryan, and the children have returned to Sarah's stark and modern condominium in Portland, Oregon, after the children find out Sarah has been publishing stories about them in her column (it's too bad we didn't get to read any of them).  It's not that the kids cry (I mean, they just lost their mother, and before they had time to fully absorb that, they were whisked away to the West Coast--the loony left--and forward about a hundred and fifty years), it's that they overdid it.  That scene was not effective because I didn't cry (and I usually bawl my eyes out), but this had little effect on me.

The script could have been punched up a little bit (more interesting, like including some of Sarah's columns and more of the Amish beliefs and way of life, and a lot more humor instead of just lightheartedness).

My heart sank into my stomach when I saw that man at the bus station approach little Josiah who had run away.  Sadly, because of the bleeding heart liberal society we live in, I automatically think pedophile, but, I think it turned out he was just a crazy man (because of the nonsense the man was spouting, I would guess a Vietnam War veteran).  Thank God!

I think all the children did a wonderful job, stealing the candlelight from Lisa Pepper, though she was by far the best-looking.  Tom Tate, the guy who played Bryan, was excellent.

The only really cheesy line was when Caleb, upon first entering Sarah's upscale condo, utters, ""We're not in Pennsylvania anymore.""

This film could have definitely benefited from laughs (instead of just smiles) and from a better soundtrack and score--both of which are very forgettable.

The major plus of this mildly touching film was that it followed the great rule of writing:  show, don't tell.  Most Christian films lack subtlety in their proselytizing, thus alienating some viewers and diminishing its entertainment value.  ""Saving"" did not.  That automatically makes it much better than the asinine ""Left Behind"" features, not to mention the annoying Kirk Cameron.

Another good recommendation is ""Joshua"", even though it's not really Biblical (Joshua is Jesus who comes to this small town like an angel to help build a church, when it says in the Bible that when He comes back, it will be with loud acclaim, or something along those verses, and He tells the Pope to keep up with the good work, which many Protestants would raise Cain, or hellfire, over).",1207612800,7,2916,4.809619238476954

It places the devout orphans of the protagonist's recently departed sister in the heart of a major city and explores the effect it has on their hearts and their family dynamic.

The beginning of the film is worrisome due to extremely clunky dialogue that sounds like it was cobbled from a book of movie journalism cliches.

Fortunately, things improve dramatically once Sarah Cain starts interacting earnestly with her sister's children. Landon's skill at drawing convincing performances from kids is highlighted throughout the rest of the film and, by the end, YOU may want to adopt some of them! And leading lady Lisa Pepper (of Anthony Hopkins' indie film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Slipstream/dp/B00116GEJI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Slipstream</a>) is frequently good and shows great potential for success. She's very easy on the eyes (it's part of the Hollywood equation, folks) and definitely plays well opposite children.

What a waste of $18!!  The sexual inuendo is one thing that bothered me; I also had to mute it many times during transitions as they loudly played rock type music.

As for the story itself, Ivy DID leave a will, the children never left Lancaster County(much less the state of PA), Sarah becomes born again, and those are only a few of the major discrepancies I found.

3226382,5,B000WTVZG2,"Loved it! I love movies about the Amish, and this particular setting that showed what might happen if Amish children had to adapt in the secular world was both touching and gratifying, since I think the Amish have a lot of good ideas about how to raise children and have a commendable lifestyle. I thought it was great that the middle children both became accepted and admired by their peers for their inherent gifts and good character. I thought it was good how Sarah was able to work through her sadness about her past by entering a closer relationship with her nieces and nephews. Loved the story and the ending was satisfying, too.

I rented this movie because I loved the book, The Redemption of Sarah Cain and I can trust movies from Michael Landon Jr. to be good movies.  But I was disappointed with this movie.  While it was a nice story, it was hardly based on the book at all.  The job Sarah has is different, she does the opposite with the children as in the book and the story of the two lifestyles and true redemption of Sarah is almost non- existent.  I gave this a 3 star review because it is still a nice movie, but I am disappointed I paid for it.",1425168000,,586,4.150442477876106

One person said that as an evangelical Christian they wished the movie had mentioned Jesus and had shown baptism and salvation, and that these things are missing from the movie. But the movie does mention Jesus--and in a very positive way. The movie also mentions salvation, at least twice.  True, it doesn't show baptism, but it's a very godly, uplifting movie. It's not in-your-face overt in its religious message, but that message is clear and unmistakable.

I highly recommend this movie. The acting is superb. The screen work is first class. The plot is fascinating. And the message is wholesome, uplifting, and even spiritual.",1422748800,,829,4.9496402877697845

We discovered this movie through listening to Pandora, streaming it into our stereo.  The music caught our ear during dinner, and we quickly left our chairs to study the screen for the title.

I also don't know much about the Amish community, so this opinion is based entirely on my enjoyment for the movie, and not on facts. No, the lead actors weren't the best, but they did a good job, and I enjoyed their roles. The children were better, and excellent with their emotions. The story was heart-wrenching (I cried a couple of times), and I came away feeling uplifted. What I enjoyed most was the contrast portrayed between living a quiet life in a quiet community versus life in the big city. During the time in Portland, I kept thinking about how much better the children's lives had been at home, and I was overjoyed when everything worked out the way it should have. It shows how children struggle with their identities in a world that is already unfriendly to ""normal"" children, let alone kids from different backgrounds. All in all, time well spent.

3226687,5,B000WTVZG2,"This is one powerful movie that somehow manages to transcend the wide chasm between mainstream and message. The acting is superb, the writing is fresh and believable, and the production qualities are top notch. Considering the unlikely premise, this had all the makings of just another manipulative barf bag of Hollywood drivel. But in the sensitive hands of Michael Landon, Jr., it speaks to the audience with the voice of truth. Can I single out one performance above all the others? No way. The kids are wonderful, Elliott Gould hits a home run, Tom Tate is convincing and likable in a thankless supporting role, and Lisa Pepper is absolutely ""real,"" causing us to see her character as an actual human being instead of a screen persona. Resembling a young Jennifer Aniston, she knows just how far to take her character before crossing the line into screen histrionics. Terrific! Mark McKenzie's music, while not quite reaching the sublime heights of ""The Last Sin Eater"" (2007) is lovely and unobtrusive, at times punctuating the dramatic moments with a light and never maudlin touch. Even the high school students are not the expected stereotypes. It is clear that Landon set out to craft a special film of honesty, solid values, and cinematic integrity, and he succeeded brilliantly on all counts. I recommend ""Saving Sarah Cain"" without reservation.",1366934400,2,1355,5.053571428571429
3226688,5,B000WTVZG2,"Wonderful movie!  Endearing, sweet, tender, loving.  I recommend it to all.  It's good family entertainment.  We could learn a lot from the Amish way of life!",1366848000,,158,4.961538461538462
3226689,4,B000WTVZG2,Just a little melodramatic with the whole kids-crying thing.  But very sweet and worth watching.  I recommend this movie for families and couples.,1365552000,,146,5.304347826086956
3226690,2,B000WTVZG2,"""Saving Sarah Cain"" has an arresting premise -- what if a worldly, self-absorbed New Yorker  (I'm assuming that's what the city is) was forced to become legal guardian to her five nieces and nephews -- who happened to be Amish? The contrasting values and lifestyles between her and her wards would conceivably make a first-rate comedy-drama. Unfortunately, this film takes that potential and throws it away, saddling it with forced, stilted dialogue, a director who casts a gloom over the whole project, and hiring mediocre actors and actresses. The only exceptions are Abigail Mason as Lyddie, the oldest child who takes the position that if it isn't Amish, the siblings will have  nothing whatever to do with it, and Danielle Chuchran Anna Mae, the middle girl who finds herself torn between the way she was raised and her attraction to a secular lifestyle. Elliot Gould also turned in a first-rate performance, but that goes without saying.
Unfortunately, the rest of the cast gives performances that are either at or below average. True, this is mostly through no fault of their own -- despite the screenwriters' attempts, the supporting characters never veer beyond stereotypes. The children are admirably fleshed out, often at the expense of Sarah Cain (a pity, because she's the film's eponymous heroine) -- although whether that's the fault of the writers, director, or actress is difficult to determine.
Basically, ""Saving Sarah Cain"" is not completely without merit, but it's still hard for me to recommend that someone spend two hours watching it when they could be watching a much better movie.
If it's a decent Christian film you're after, you're much better off ""Saving Sarah Cain"" for later, and putting on ""Facing the Giants"" instead, a film so well-crafted one may well think it's an award-winning, studio-produced indie drama instead of a ridiculously low-budget church project.",1365465600,2,1896,5.152597402597403
3226691,5,B000WTVZG2,"I loved the book by this title and was looking forward to seeing the movie ""like the book.""  Although it is certainly based on the book, it had many variations; primarily, that Sarah took her Amish nephews and nieces to the big city.  In the book, she stays in their Amish home in their Amish town.  It was a bit disappointing that the movie portrayed two of the Amish children trying to ""fit in"" at their new city school, as the book had the children remain utterly faithful to their roots.  But the movie was still very enjoyable and had a logical, rounded out, happy ending.  Not quite like the book, but a great story just the same.",1365292800,,636,4.3559322033898304

3226704,1,B000WTVZG2,"I have read all of Beverly Lewis' books.  The Redemption of Sarah Cain was my least favorite, but still an enjoyable book.  There was not much similarity comparing the movie to the book.  In the book Sarah is redeemed from spending time among her nieces and nephews and the other amish by living in Lancaster Co with them.  She is struck by the way they live, their simple ways and their complete trust in God's divive providence and this is how she comes to terms with something horrible that happened in her past.  I understand there may be issues with the amount of time in a typical movie, but there is so much departure from the book that it should not even be associated with it.  I may have liked it better had I never read the book.  I was looking forward to some of Lewis' characters come to life, but there were too many inconsistencies and omissions.

3226710,5,B000WTVZG2,"When I first heard of this, I was hesitant to check it out, knowing it was a very independent movie (yes, Fox Faith Films is very independent, unlike 20th Century Fox, so it's more like a Christian-based Fox Independent), I was thinking it'd have a seriously cheesy visual filter (sorry, Kendrick Brothers, but I can't help but think of Flywheel stating that), yet I checked it out from the local library, just in case. To my pleasant surprise, it was a real good visual filter along with a nice storyline.
Yes, its Christian (don't let the 1-star reviewers who hate the momentary cleavage drive you away, they can't see a good movie for a single moment), but it's nt like it's preaching to the choir stupid. In fact, thouh my great-grandmother was Amish (so my mom has more experience around her than I did), my mom never complained about a single moment wih the Amish family (actually, we all laughed at the Amish twist of the Wizard of Oz one-liner). And, though my family is devoutly Christian, we had nothing bad to say about the forementioned cleavage. For one, there's not enough to incite lust (at least, not for me and my brother), for another, even if it were, it's not there long enough (nor being camera-ogled) for me to consider fantasizing. Period. I also appreciated the social visual symbolism of innocence nearing the brink of corruption and being confused on how things work in the world (specially when a former Amish boy is seen dresses as a goth and smoking, revealing that no one is safe from human nature).
One curious train-of-thought, though: sinc the eldest Amish niece is sixteen, I was surprised that she wasn't on Rumspringa (it's an actual Amish tradition for all teens, 16-20, to go on, then they decide on their own if they'll stick with the Amish church or stay in the Outside World while having connections with family), but I suppose liberties had to be taken for the story.
Overall, due to that slight hitch, I'd giv this a 4.75/5",1328918400,,1966,4.6685878962536025

3226712,5,B000WTVZG2,"This movie is based on the book by bestselling author, Beverly Lewis. It is a well-made movie with strong redemption themes. Sarah Cain is given custody of her nieces and nephews when her sister dies. However, there is a huge difference between Sarah's life and the life her sister led. Sarah is on the fast track as a journalist in Portland, Oregon. She has only herself to worry about and is set on being a well-known syndicated columnist. Her sister, Ivy, on the other hand, had joined the Amish and her main focus was her family.

When Sarah receives the news, she has no idea how her five Amish nieces and nephews are going to fit into her neat and tidy self-absorbed life. Add into the mix Sarah's dysfunctional upbringing and her dedicated fiance, who wants nothing more than to marry Sarah and spend his life with her.  So Sarah decides to bring her nieces and nephews to Portland - away from the life they've known. How will this affect them?

This movie has many great discussion opportunities. Among them are greed, selfishness, temptation, following the crowd, death, and what's really important in life. Is it money and a career? Or is the little lives an adult can shape and mold for God's glory?

Younger children will not understand the plot and will likely be frightened by the death of the mom (although how she died is not shown). Therefore, I would highly recommend it for those ages tween to adult. This is a movie that will stick with you long after you've watched it. Kudos to Michael Landon, Jr. for directing another film void of violence and objectionable language.

3226717,1,B000WTVZG2,This so called 'Christian' movie was not about Christ at all. How could Sarah find redemption or salvation without turning from sin to faith in Christ? Instead- the movie depicted that her acceptance of this simplier way of life was somehow her 'salvation' The most shocking during family viewing was the zoning in of the camera onto a very seductive lady's cleavage! And how a fellow employee kept lusting after this lady. The 'nice' story-line was ruined. How many young boys would watch the show simply to arouse their own curiosity! Christians should understand that lust (of the heart) equals the act. Are we to chuckle and take lightly the 'sin' of immoral behavior that the Bible depicts as wickedness?Christians should influence one another into a life of holiness and righteousness -not leading the flock back into the strongholds of sin.,1288828800,6,847,5.01418439716312

The scenery, the acting and directing are perfectly blended to deliver a captivating message that will resonate deeply within. It is so heartening to know that faith-based movie alternatives are available. I purchased this recently to view with my eight year old daughter and I cannot even begin to adequately describe the overwhelming feeling of content in my heart as I watched both the movie and my daughter's reactions throughout. It's been a couple months and she still speaks of the movie.

3226739,5,B000WTVZG2,"In a way this movie is a reversal of A Stranger Among Us. Instead of an outsider visiting an isolated religious community, members of that community visit the outside.
I have long admired the Amish for their steadfast keeping of their faith in the midst of an alien world. And for their colorful traditions. In this movie we show the clash between the two worlds.
The plot is somewhat predictable. A jaded columnist by a curious chain of circumstances, ends up as the guardian of an Amish family. The Amish learn to live among ""English"" and endure tests to their integrity with varying success. In the process, the collumnists, Sarah Cain, becomes a better and less cynical person. This plot has been seen a thousand times; that isn't really the point. It works because it is good when well done and it was well done here. It was a great movie.
My favorite character was Lyddie the big sister. She was pretty, and had integrity and strong leadership qualities. She could have raised the whole brood herself and in fact Sarah would have been smarter just to delegate almost everything to her.",1238025600,,1091,4.6875

However, I was disappointed in the poor and uninspired acting of Elliot Gould and Tess Harper. Their ""star status"" brought nothing to  the movie at all. As far as I am concerned, the rest of the cast were better than these two (especially Lisa Pepper). They should have gone with lesser known actors for these two roles, and used the budget difference to totally revamp the movie. The beginning and ending were fine, but the entire middle was a huge disappointment.
This movie falls short of being a truly good classic because of the bad plot in the middle. The best part of the movie was the ""flash-back"" to the main character's childhood memories on the beach.

The accents were terrible (Lyddie's was the only one that pulled it off throughout the whole film), they totally changed the character's personalities, namely Caleb and Josiah and even the main character, Sarah! Changing the plot and characters so much just didn't make the story 'gel' together right. It came across that the only way to be a good christian is to be plain which is way off and anyway their was no mention of Christ anyway.

Her sister and children were Amish, so on top of everything, there are strong cultural differences.

This is a powerful story about selfless love, a higher call than simply what we personally want.  I found it very touching emotionally and inspiring to live for other's sake.  We desperately need these reminders in today's culture.

I was surprised in this movie however, that it appeared that the Amish culture portrayed here was touched with more modern influences, than I had expected.

There was absolutely no reason to have their cleavage, and more, showing. (What was the purpose?)  The story would have been just as powerful as far as getting the point across of the differences between the Amish and the city people without their cleavage showing and the tight clothes.  This has been billed as a family movie, but we would NOT recommend this movie to ANYONE because of the immodest dress.  We will not watch it again.  Also, I was quite disappointed that there are so many reviews claiming it was a movie you could watch with your family, seemingly ignoring the immodest dress.

3226762,3,B000WTVZG2,"Two stars for the film, one star (extra) for the stunning cinematography, especially the flashback scene of Sarah and older sister, Ivy, as children, frolicking at the seashore.  As another reviewer commented, that scene was ""beautiful, ethereal, evocative, and expertly photographed and edited"", and if not the rest of the film, this sequence is worth watching again and again.  It is too bad the rest of the movie wasn't more subtle in its emotion (as in the case when Sarah, along with boyfriend, Bryan, and the children have returned to Sarah's stark and modern condominium in Portland, Oregon, after the children find out Sarah has been publishing stories about them in her column (it's too bad we didn't get to read any of them).  It's not that the kids cry (I mean, they just lost their mother, and before they had time to fully absorb that, they were whisked away to the West Coast--the loony left--and forward about a hundred and fifty years), it's that they overdid it.  That scene was not effective because I didn't cry (and I usually bawl my eyes out), but this had little effect on me.

The script could have been punched up a little bit (more interesting, like including some of Sarah's columns and more of the Amish beliefs and way of life, and a lot more humor instead of just lightheartedness).

My heart sank into my stomach when I saw that man at the bus station approach little Josiah who had run away.  Sadly, because of the bleeding heart liberal society we live in, I automatically think pedophile, but, I think it turned out he was just a crazy man (because of the nonsense the man was spouting, I would guess a Vietnam War veteran).  Thank God!

I think all the children did a wonderful job, stealing the candlelight from Lisa Pepper, though she was by far the best-looking.  Tom Tate, the guy who played Bryan, was excellent.

The only really cheesy line was when Caleb, upon first entering Sarah's upscale condo, utters, ""We're not in Pennsylvania anymore.""

This film could have definitely benefited from laughs (instead of just smiles) and from a better soundtrack and score--both of which are very forgettable.

The major plus of this mildly touching film was that it followed the great rule of writing:  show, don't tell.  Most Christian films lack subtlety in their proselytizing, thus alienating some viewers and diminishing its entertainment value.  ""Saving"" did not.  That automatically makes it much better than the asinine ""Left Behind"" features, not to mention the annoying Kirk Cameron.

Another good recommendation is ""Joshua"", even though it's not really Biblical (Joshua is Jesus who comes to this small town like an angel to help build a church, when it says in the Bible that when He comes back, it will be with loud acclaim, or something along those verses, and He tells the Pope to keep up with the good work, which many Protestants would raise Cain, or hellfire, over).",1207612800,7,2916,4.809619238476954

Fortunately, things improve dramatically once Sarah Cain starts interacting earnestly with her sister's children.

8225544,1,B000WTVZG2,"My wife and I suffered through about 15 minutes of this atrocious movie. Simply the worst acting, writing and directing we have ever witnessed. The first quarter hour was loaded with stereotypes, cliches, actors who appeared to be reading their lines off of cue cards, and exaggerated attempts to convey emotion. We decided to not subject ourselves to anymore of it. I wish Amazon offered a money back guarantee for movies that are so bad that you watch only a brief part of it.",1513814400,,478,4.7023809523809526
