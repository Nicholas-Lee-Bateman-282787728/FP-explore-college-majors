The History of Christmas and The History of Santa Clause have a particulary nice Christmas feel. It's a really great price, and I recommend this DVD highly.",1289260800,,314,4.526315789473684

3543472,5,B001DXS41A,"When i looked this DVD up, I thought it would only be the Christmas Unwrapped segment from the History Channel. I was pleasantly surprised to find 4 more segments from History Channel regarding Christmas on this dvd. All making for a viewing experience that lasted the better part of almost 2 hours. I especially enjoyed Christmas Tech, basically a whole show dedicated to detailing how anything having to do with Christmas (ex: decorations, lights, displays) are made. I was captured by this episode. it was great. This whole dvd is totally worth the small price. It is a great deal and a perfect buy for any History Channel fan.",1256256000,2,630,4.7889908256880735
3543473,4,B001DXS41A,"The History Channel has compiled this new DVD from four previously-aired documentaries relevant to Christmas. The first is Christmas Unwrapped: The History of Christmas, which was originally released in 1997. It traces the tradition of celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ on December 25 to the fourth century and how various cultures have developed unique ways in honoring the holiday. England's traditions around Yuletide became more and more raucuous and profane with every century between the early Middle Ages and the inception of the Industrial Revolution; one of the commentators states a contemporary observer would mistake British Christmas rites of these years for our Halloween or Mardi Gras. Debauchery, dipsomania, and depravity overruled any sense of divinity or devotion. Dear oh dear...

When the Puritan separatists established themselves in the New World, they outlawed Christmas entirely--as did Oliver Cromwell in England in the years following their exodus to America. Another historian on the program muses that one of the reasons for the Restoration of the Monarchy with the enthronement of King Charles II in 1649 was that the English missed their traditional Christmas revelries, which had been brutally suppressed by the Protectorate.

Due to its Pilgrim heritage, the United States would continue to largely ignore Christmas altogether. Congress even sat in session every 25th of December from 1789 through 1856. It was not until immigrants from other parts of Europe--Germany in particular, and, later, from southern and eastern regions--began arriving in large numbers starting in the mid-19th century that Christmas observances truly took root in America.

History Channel's Biography presents the life stories of famous people, and in 2003 it focused on the most recognizable ambassador of the Christmas season: Santa Claus. From the real-life St. Nicholas, Bishop of Myra (in modern Turkey; he died in 346), a patron of small children, came the modern-day elf. St. Nicholas has historically been significant during the Christmas holiday because his feast is kept on December 6. As a favorite help-mate of sailors, he found fervent fidelity among the Dutch, whose name for him--Sinter Klaus--was the forerunner of the English ""Santa Claus"". Another alias, Kris Kringle, comes from a German moniker--Christkindl--an idea of Martin Luther's, a patriarch of the Protestant Reformation. Luther taught that the Christ Child (Christkindl in German) was the bringer of children's Christmas gifts rather than St. Nicholas, whose Roman Catholic overtones he wished to dispel from his new church.

Descriptions of Claus varied wildly (I particularly enjoyed the sketch of a Santa looking like an inebriated vagrant being drawn in a sled...by a huge turkey...) until Clement Clarke Moore's poem, ""A Visit From St. Nicholas"", appeared in a New York newspaper in 1823. Most of us would recognize the most famous Christmas poem of all time by it's first line: "" 'Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house"", etc. His appearance as jolly, portly, and merry set the tone for his personality; Moore also both introduced and named Santa's legendary flying reindeer. The clergyman also founded Santa's modus operandi for entering domiciles: down the chimney.

Weird U.S. is another History Channel program, with hosts Mark Moran and Mark Sceurman roving across America in search of odd and bizarre historical tidbits, folklore, and traditions.

""It's A Wonderful Time to Be Weird"" (aired in 2005) focuses on sundry off-kilter Christmas activities seen across the land. They visit NORAD (the national aerospace defense system) in Denver, Colorado, where Santa's celestial progress is monitored and reported annually. The federal agency's place in the national Xmas schema dates to the mid 1950s. Denver-area children began calling a local telephone number advertised as a direct line to Santa Claus, but due to a misprint, the newspaper had advertised NORAD's emergency line instead. The staff, delighted to be given the opportunity to play Father Christmas' go-between with the youngsters, have charted his global positions every year since, and now incorporate it into their official website on Christmas Eve.

Mark and Mark also embark on a pilgrimage to Minnesota to explore the traditional Yuletide dish of lutefisk among Norwegian Americans. Translated literally, the dish means ""lye fish""--truth in advertising, as the jellied end product is indeed whitefish treated with the harsh chemical (a key ingredient in drain cleaners--good heavens!). Humorist Garrison Keillor, a native Minnesotan, recalls this pungent dish in an excerpt from his famous Lake Wobegon Days:

""Every Advent we entered the purgatory of lutefisk, a repulsive gelatinous fishlike dish that tasted of soap and gave off an odor that would gag a goat. We did this in honor of Norwegian ancestors, much as if survivors of a famine might celebrate their deliverance by feasting on elm bark. I always felt the cold creeps as Advent approached, knowing that this dread delicacy would be put before me and I'd be told, 'Just have a little.' Eating a little was like vomiting a little, just as bad as a lot.""

Their peregrinations take a local turn when the duo interviews Pastor Harry Walther, a radio personality and minister from Media, a suburb of Philadelphia. Pastor Harry enthusiastically decries the very mention of Santa Claus in any manner, claiming he is an incarnation of evil (and yes, he is in earnest, although I found him and his lunatic-fringe creed impossible to take seriously). He even sells burnable effigy Santa dolls on his website, encouraging people to light poor Santa's likeness aflame in revolt against ""the Satanic lie of Santa"" (and I'm quoting him directly!). Mark and Mark react with great indignation and amusement upon leaving Harry and his Santa-driven tirades behind them.

The final selection, Christmas Tech, checks out the nuts-and-bolts backstories to some of the season's outward manifestations. It explains how the massive evergreen found each year in Rockefeller Center is selected, acquired, moved, and erected. The much-touted street-level windows of the great Macy's Department Store of Manhattan are graphically described, from idea conception to final implementation. And the processes used to create such ordinary Christmas festoons as tree lights, glass ornaments, and fruitcake (I know--most people recoil when faced with the prospect of this traditional Yuletide confection, but I happily anticipate nibbling on some every December) are exhaustively researched.

All in all a very thorough, entertaining, and erudite (the Marks from Weird U.S. even visit a Columbia University Professor of Physics, who calculates how Santa Claus gets around the world in time to deliver hundreds of millions of Christmas treats--a segment I walked out of the room during because I break out in a rash if exposed to anything mathematical...) treatment of all things Yule, and one I think most would enjoy.",1229299200,15,7037,5.393994540491356
3543474,5,B001DXS41A,"This is an excellent compilation of four History Channel/A&E programs dealing with Christmas, all wrapped into one DVD.

1. ""Christmas Unwrapped"" (available as an individual DVD) is a delightful history of the holiday from pagan times to the present, along with the origins of several Christmas customs.

2. ""It's a Wonderful Time to be Weird"" is a holiday offering from the popular series WEIRD U.S. where the odd and unusual are documented from coast-to-coast.  It's a Wacky Wonderland of Christmas.

3. ""Santa Claus"" (available as an individual DVD) is from the BIOGRAPHY series and traces the roots of Father Christmas through the centuries.

4. ""Christmas Tech"" is a holiday episode of the series MODERN MARVELS that explores the high-tech aspect of the celebration, such as the annual Rockefeller Center Christmas tree and Macy's festive store windows.

Getting these four programs for less than the price of either one of the previous individual releases, is 2008 holiday bargain.

I'd recommend enjoying each program individually, rather than sitting through a Christmas overdose of 200 minutes.  However, as a big fan of all things Christmas, I found the four flowed quite nicely all in a row.

These are rarely found in stores, so have Amazon put this DVD in Santa's sleigh this holiday season.",1225411200,31,1304,5.14218009478673
3543475,5,B001DXS41A,"I bought this because my husband was under the false assumption that Christmas began with the Christian religion and he challenged me as to where I got my info when I said the ground work was laid MUCH earlier in history (which I learned in world religion classes - NOT church based classes - while in college).  He was willing to accept that a video from the History Channel would be grounded in historical facts, so I bought it.  The video does not go into a lot of detail about Pagan celebrations, but it gives a good gist.  I am so glad I got it, I HATE that children are raised assuming everything they learn in their Christian Church classes are ""the full truth"" ... ugh!!  This video will help round out some people's education and (hopefully) eliminate some misconceptions about Christmas.",1397260800,,797,4.591549295774648

3543478,5,B001DXS41A,"Fine treatment of the history of the holiday. Good for kids once they get beyond the age of believing in Santa, in fact a great way to augment your explanation that  ""there is no Santa.""  Price  is right.",1362960000,,204,4.315789473684211
3543479,4,B001DXS41A,"My wife and I pickup a few Christmas titles each year. When we started this, some years ago, this was one of the first. I'd remembered these holiday history lessons from their 1990s History Channel origins, with the perfect narration by Harry Smith. My wife did not recall these and although she finds them interesting, I'm not so impressed by this History of Christmas one, some years later. Where it's not so bad a history, there are simply more indepth, better ones out there. Then again, the History Channel is known for this type of vagueness. May be worth it, though, since it's actually pretty interesting. The extra ""Santa Claus"" is just okay. I have not viewed the other two bonus' here.",1358208000,,696,4.713114754098361

3543481,5,B001DXS41A,I seen this on the history channel and loved it.  I learned a lot about the holiday that i never knew.

3543484,4,B001DXS41A,"Some of the shows featured in this collection have been available separately for years. ""Christmas Unwrapped"" is fantastic, and the Biography of Santa Claus is a good No. 2.  The ""Modern Marvels"" episode also is solid. The  ""Weird U.S."" episode here is basically a disjointed throwaway that doesn't have a traditionally Christmas-y feel to it.",1292803200,,343,5.218181818181818
