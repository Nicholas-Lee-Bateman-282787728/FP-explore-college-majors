However, this movie has nothing Christian in it which was really disappointing. The plot was very hard to understand and overall it was cheesy, especially the filming. Please don't buy this movie!

6264298,5,B00II7H5SM,"Far too often we are all very good at preaching the right thing...living it is a lot harder. At first we were curious why God wasn't really mentioned, and no prayer was seen by the family or individually. But, at the end we all agreed that this was a very relatable movie for everyone of all faiths. It showed a normal family trying to do the right thing and learning along the way. This is what we all need to do regardless of religious beliefs. I think this movie would appeal to everyone. And I can tell you that as a Christian I really appreciated a movie my entire family of eight could watch together. What a breath of fresh air! It's tough watching anything as a family because our kids cover 14 years. But this was perfect. And we loved the quirky characters - every family has those guys, too ;) Thank you for a great movie!",1458432000,,833,4.2784810126582276

6264300,1,B00II7H5SM,"Wow.  I'm really glad I watched this for free on Netflix.  It was 2 torturous hours.  At the end, I don't even know what happened?  Does telling the city council that they suck as humans and ""dropping the mic"" mean he saved his business?  I have no idea.  The Eco-Activist dude getting arrested (after half the credits rolled at the end)??  Why?  What was his camera man testifying to?  I feel like during all those slow motion baseball games, there was some back story that must have been left out?  So confused!

6264304,5,B00II7H5SM,"I appreciated many of the messages in this movie.  No, the movie was not overtly Christian, as found in some of Cameron's other movies, but it had a great deal of substance and was exactly what it purported to be....a wholesome family movie.  There are no explosions, gratuitous violence, etc, so yes, I suppose it may be boring for some, however my family enjoyed it...children included.",1444867200,,388,4.863636363636363
6264305,5,B00II7H5SM,"""Mercy Rule"" is an outstanding film, one of the best I have seen in the category of independent productions coming from the growing world of Christian or Christian-friendly film makers.  Its best feature is a rich, creative, and wise script, penned by the talented writer N.D. Wilson.  If you've read some of Wilson's fiction, you will recognize some of his characteristic themes in this film--the importance of family loyalty and spirit, the legacy of outstanding ancestors (in this instance a grandfather/father), the beauty and joy of baseball, the goodness of life (even in this troubled and fallen world), and gratitude, to name some that stood out to this viewer.  The script bubbles over with zingy lines, memorable illustrations, and wonderful humor.  I haven't enjoyed the original script of a contemporary film as much as this film for many years.  But because the script is dense and deep, it isn't easy to catch every line.

Part of the script's achievement is taking an ordinary, even mundane story and transforming it into something special.  ""Mercy Rule"" depicts two interwoven plot lines.  John Miller (well played by Kirk Cameron) and his brother Ben (hilariously portrayed by Tim Hawkins) are fighting to preserve their family scrapping (recycling) business from the predations of a sleazy lobbyist allied with cash-hungry government.  John's son Cody, meanwhile, is struggling to find his place on his Little League baseball team.  Both father and son learn important lessons through these challenges.  But even more important than the specific lessons and character growth that occur for both is their realization (or ""relearning""/remembering) of where strength really comes from, and what matters more than their successes and achievements on the fields of business and baseball--their relationships, especially family.  John's wife Maddie (Cameron's real life wife Chelsea) is an anchor to everyone, while older daughter Bea dispenses stinging yet quality admonitions to Cody, like the big sister most of us needed but never had.  Perhaps the most important member of the family in terms of inspiring them to unity and achievement is John and Ben's father, dead some time now, but still guiding his family through the memory of his profound sayings, hard work, determination, and love.  Not too many films or works of fiction capture this obvious truth--that a family business built from the strong character of its founders is often more than a material legacy to succeeding generations--it can be an expression of the love and personality of one's ancestors as much as anything else.

There is a scene that particularly moved me (mild spoiler here) in which John confesses to his brother Ben a seriously ill-conceived (even stupid) business decision he made, a decision that has put their entire family enterprise in danger.  Ben gets plenty upset, but the two brothers move quickly to reconcile, and then on to face their threats as a team.  In most families such a failure on the part of one sibling would typically result in a falling out between brothers.  Mercy Rule shows that where there is real love, there is also loyalty.  And where there is loyalty, brothers and family members are truly watching each other's backs, not competing or quarreling.

I enjoyed the acting as well.  The two youngsters playing Cody and Bea Miller do a terrific job.  Bas Rutten as the eccentric but excellent baseball coach is as funny as Tim Hawkins' Uncle Ben.

The film is shot in a jumpy, unpredictable manner that has a lot of the music video style in it.  At times this camera work is compelling and fun, but at other times it is presumptuous and distracting.  If you are someone who does not like a quick moving camera, with a wide variety of shots and angles, I would not recommend ""Mercy Rules.""  It is the one criticism of the film that I can sympathize with.

I liked the slow motion scenes in the climactic baseball game, because this approach emphasizes how much happens in the very short bursts of baseball action.  On the baseball fields of America, battles are won and lost in intense struggles that normal time glosses over.  The film underscores the drama of baseball in its creative filming of the game scenes.

While ""Mercy Rule"" does not directly mention God much (""Providence"" is referred to in a key scene, and there are a few other indirect references), this story is literally God-soaked.  I see it as a depiction of how people who know the forgiveness of Christ and the power of God appreciate, truly appreciate, the privilege of simply being alive on this amazing planet, having parents and grandparents, and uncles and sisters and brothers, and work and play and sports and breakfast and can go out to slay the dragons of greed, envy, and despair together.  Like other great art, this film removes blinders from one's eyes, and transforms the dull and dreary to sparkling green fields where great deeds beckon.

While it is clear from other reviews that this film will not appeal to some, I highly recommend it!  While it may not be an easy film for all to follow and understand, my wife and I, with our children of various ages, enjoyed it, and had a great discussion about it afterwards.  A profound thank you to Kirk Cameron, N.D. Wilson, and all those involved!",1444435200,3,5306,4.950338600451468

6264325,3,B00II7H5SM,"I regret to say this, but those of you who are complaining about a ""lack of God"" in this movie are displaying a disheartening lack of imagination.  While this movie had deficiencies (the first twenty minutes had basically nothing going on and the overuse of slow motion and attempts at flashiness just distracted from the story), lack of Christianity was not one of them.

Not all decent films - even Christ-honoring ones - need to be explicitly evangelistic.  In fact, if your real goal is evangelism it is actually counterproductive for all films to be as evangelistic as something like Courageous, because only a small handful of people are ready to be ""closed"" in such a fashion.  For many others, explicit evangelism will be a huge turnoff and a barrier to them finding Christ.  You should not pick fruit before it is ripe.  People are on various parts of the spectrum in terms of their relationship with God.  Some are very far, while others are closer but not quite there yet.  We need a RANGE of movies to deal with people.  While some movies should be ""closers"", with scenes such as the evangelistic conversations found in Fireproof and Courageous, some films should simply aim to simply put a ""stone in one's shoe""... not too evangelistic to make those far from Christ throw up walls, but enough to present a certain worldview that perhaps makes people think.  And some films should be somewhere in the middle.  Why, as Christians, should we limit ourselves to only one kind of film?

We need films on ALL parts of this spectrum to be truly effective as Christian communicators.  We need to meet people where they are, as Paul did in his own ministry - he ""was Jew to the Jews and Gentile to Gentiles"", he reasoned from the Scriptures to those who held the Scripture as authoritative and used reason and cultural norms germane to the culture at hand to those that did not (his speech on Mars Hill).  God himself also could have presented Jesus to everybody right off the bat, but He did not!  He prepared the way for thousands of years before the world was ready for Jesus.  If such strategies are good enough for God and for Paul they are certainly good enough for Christian filmmakers.

But it does not help Christian filmmakers when our own audience berates us into only making one narrow kind of film, and accuses people like Kirk Cameron of being unfaithful when he makes something other than the same old thing.  You guys need to open up your thinking here.  Christian films need to meet people where they are, and thus need to come in all kinds of forms.  All truth is God's truth, and it doesn't have to all be presented in the same narrow fashion with every single film, in fact, it is counterproductive to do so.  I am thankful for films like Courageous, but I'm also thankful for films like 1937s Captain's Courageous.  This is one of the great family films of all time, and extremely edifying on many levels, but if such an accomplished piece of work were released by a Christian filmmaker today many Christian fans would accuse that filmmaker of ""not having enough God in it"".  This is extremely unfortunate, and as the core audience, those Christians who are demanding their filmmakers only make one kind of film are doing nothing short of straightjacketing their artistic expression and their cultural effectiveness.  We need to think bigger if we want to be successful as Christian communicators, and not punish those who want to start bringing people in from the further end of the spectrum.",1430697600,2,3518,4.692182410423452

I hate to be negative, because there was a lot that we did like about this movie. But there was WAAAAY too much slow-motion footage. We have never seen a movie with so much of it.

My kids begged us to stop torturing them with this movie and turn it off.  They usually love family movies.  This was the first time they asked to stop a movie.

The point was unfortunately very lost, and you keep wondering if the story line is going to become obvious and you'll get an ""aha"" moment.  But after the first 45 minutes, my 13 year-old, who is used to our family standard of conservative movies, asked if she could go to bed.  And she did.  :(  It is clean, which I am thankful for, but the main point is very, very murky.

6264389,1,B00II7H5SM,"I'm sorry but this is just a poorly produced movie.

1) It's not especially Christian.  There's no mention of God at all...ever.  Which is ok if you're just looking for entertainment, but it uses Fireproof as it's jump-off and leads you to believe it would be Christian-based.

2) The camera.  Oh my, it's horrible.  The camera angles are only distracting.  Several angles look like the camera was placed on the ground, or on the counter-top.  The close ups are out of whack so your perspective is totally thrown off.

3) Color tint.  Just stop it.

4) Slow-mo.  Without the slow-mos the movie would probably be 30 min.  Completely unnecessary and distracting.

5) Weirdness.  Kirk (the dad) jumps on the fence like a monkey.  The boy talks beyond his years.  The coach looks and acts like a drug addict in withdrawal - seriously, he's disturbing.  Council woman says 'time to drop the mic' and Kirk does this weird gangsta-rap dropping of the mic and everyone cheers and you're sitting there stupidly clueless.

6) Story line.  It's horribly weak.  You're never invested in the family.  You never care about them.  You don't care about the little league and you don't care about the scrap yard.  The story line could be completed in 45 min.  But it's dragged on for 2 hours.

7) The one worthwhile moment is when Tim Hawkins was in front of the city council - that was funny.

But I believe the reason why he made this movie, was just as he said it, ""to be a family movie."" Not to bring salvation. Not to bring the message of the cross. Not to preach the gospel. But just simply, to be a Family movie. I think he made it so families of all types may watch this movie and enjoy it.

Kirk has produced some movies in the past with wonderful messages of redemption and healing when a person turns away from themselves and to the Lord (for example: Fireproof). While this movie is 'clean' (although Kirk does say something at the end about the lives of those in power that 'suck' because of what they are doing to small business owners - not appropriate terminology)... there is NO real Christian message at all. It is pro-family, pro-small business, and anti big-government. Not saying I disagree with those things - BUT, I was expecting something with some REAL Christian substance. This movie is too long, but could have been MUCH shorter if the MANY ""slow-mo"" scenes were filmed at normal speed! I felt like they were trying to drag out a poor movie to give it more validity. The 'wisdom' of the main character's deceased father was what was focused on for much of the movie - but no mention of God's Word. With so many things claiming to be 'Christian' being so 'watered-down' - and even political - these days, this is just something to add to the sad list.

The acting was good, though the man who played the coach was difficult to understand half the time.  I also didn't like the brother's character who seemed to go from passionately angry to silly within minutes.  Some of the dialogue was awkward.  For instance, the son quotes several sayings from his grandfather one after another.  You didn't have time to digest one before he said the next one.  The scene in the restaurant between the husband and wife was a bit strange as well as the end where the councilwoman tells him it's time to drop the mic.  I really didn't like the use of the camera.  It was as if the director got a new toy and he was playing with every odd color concept and angle.  I also found it to be very slow at times.  How long do you have to follow a kid on a bicycle?  I think a lot of that footage could have had the boy narrating what he was feeling at the time.

Kirk plays a GREAT dad in the movie despite his own personal business trials.  Chelsea has an outstanding scene that every good wife could learn from.  Tim Hawkins is hilarious.  The baseball coach actually teaches some very good lessons about good sportsmanship.  There is no alcohol in this movie.  It is a root beer.  Kirk Cameron does have a cigarette behind his ear in one scene and there are some hints of having a past addiction that apparently he is over.  This movie is about family, marriage, youth sports and how a family business survives some hostile attacks from city government and the environmental movement.  This is a terrific movie for kids.

The discussion questions, the back of the movie, Kirk's trailer....everything points to faith and trusting God, but except for the one mention of God by Tim Hawkins there was no obvious tie into faith through the struggles presented in the movie. It was so blatantly absent that it makes you wonder why it was intentionally left out? The family didn't pray together, there was no mention of the Word of God, more focus was on ""Pops"" the patriarch of the family and his words of wisdom. When John the main character was shattered by a decision he had made and struggled with the effects of it he never bowed a knee, he tinkered with the idea of smoking again or drinking but he never cried out to God. He received encouragement from his wife that was certainly beautiful from a family perspective but the absence of proclaiming the foundation of our faith and family made this movie feel like a deflating balloon. It had some very good family fuzzy moments and nice breaks of laughter.

No preaching though strong family values are emphasized throughout.  It's 117 minutes (too) long and most of it is a collection of feel good montages.  Watched it with my 10 year old who said it was good.  He plays baseball and we both found the little boy Cody comical enough to be interesting as was his quirky coach. The rest of it not so much.  Both stories were very muddled without a distinct resolution though Cody learns a lesson about being patient and putting the good of the team ahead of himself.  Maybe if it had focused just on the baseball story it would have been a better movie.  Probably OK for younger kids (under 10) who won't overthink it but the length may be a challenge.
