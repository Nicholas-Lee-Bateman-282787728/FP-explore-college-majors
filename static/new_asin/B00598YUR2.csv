8462910,2,B00598YUR2,"I really liked the story. It was a mystery up until the end. But, it was very boring. 90% of the time I was bored, waiting for something to happen. Sad ending. All of the actors did a convincing job and I especially like the main actress. Seeing her in 49 Days, prompted me to watch this movie.",1378339200,,294,4.086206896551724
8462911,5,B00598YUR2,"A TV-producer tried to chase down a story about a korean stew that seems to have magically powers and finds a love story that is poignant, but also mystical.  The TV show may never air, but after tasting the stew, who cares!  All the love, care and effort that goes into making the soybean paste, fermenting with special yeast and brewed alcohol, water from a hidden spring, and fermenting pots made from clay in which is infused composted flower petals, plus pollen from passing bees, all make for a slow-pace drama that some in this microwaving cooking era might find long-drawn out.  I for one, enjoy the acting of the international star, Lee Yo-Won and her ability to endure.",1364774400,,679,4.689075630252101
8462912,5,B00598YUR2,"This film has beautiful photography, a tightly woven, tender story,  And, while it is not the happily-ever-after ending, it really ties the story together.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good story and a few tears.",1359331200,,227,4.794871794871795
8462913,4,B00598YUR2,"Doenjang (Anna Lee, 2010)

Fifteen minutes into Doenjang, released in English-speaking countries as The Recipe, I wanted a bowl of doenjang stew just as much as the characters in the movie, and at the time I had no idea what doenjang even was. (I paused the movie and looked it up.) By the end of the movie, I wanted one even more. Anna Lee, turning in her first movie, smacked one right out of the park; Doenjang is foodie paradise, with huge dollops of romance and mystery, along with a dash of fantasy, and the whole is a great deal of fun.

Plot: Hyeon-soo Kim (Arang's Dong-wook Lee), an infamous criminal, goes to the noose wishing for a bowl of doenjang stew. This is pounced on in the same way as Charles Kane's ""Rosebud!"" on his deathbed; TV producers scramble to figure out why this guy was so interested in doenjang stew. (For those unfamiliar with Korean food, this would be the equivalent of an American prisoner wishing for, say, mac and cheese on his way to the gallows.) Yoo-jin Choi (Secret's Seung-ryong Ryu) is one of those producers, and he eventually tracks down the restaurant where Hyeon-soo was apprehended. It seems there was a woman there named Hye-jin (Attack the Gas Station!'s Yu-won Lee) whose doenjang stew possessed supernatural qualities. (Yoo-jin hires a team of chemists to examine a bit of the stew, and one of the things they find is that the salt is 100% pure. ""I've never seen anything above 99.8%!"") While the other stations are putting their stories together, Yoo-jin asks his boss for one more week, and goes off hunting Hye-jin, who disappeared into thin air just after that encounter.

The bulk of the movie is Yoo-jin chasing after Hye-jin's trail, and Lee and screenwriter Se-yeong Bae (In Love and War) set this up as a typical ""Yoo-jin finds Hye-jin and they fall in love"" romance. But that is not the direction the movie turns, which just adds to the fun. The script is not afraid to ask questions, much more incisive questions that one finds in most romances, and more impressively it is not afraid to leave some of those questions unanswered (as they would be were this a piece of nonfiction). The acting is just as good as you'd expect given that roster, and Lee does a fantastic job for a first-time director. A charming little gem that deserves a great deal more exposure in this country than it has gotten so far. *** ",1355443200,3,2373,4.629453681710213
8462914,5,B00598YUR2,"This movie was absolutely nothing like what I expected it to be when I started it. I started ""The Recipe"" movie believing it to be a light-hearted, somewhat silly, and possibly rom-com kind of movie about finding the best recipe for a certain Korean dish. I could not have been more mistaken or more glad. What I got instead was a beautiful movie about patience and love. ""The Recipe"" was a truly delightful and surprising mixture with its slow unraveling of the story and its quiet, but moving representation of love. Unlike most movies of today, it does not just throw out an easy or quick explanation with a fast paced storyline that zips along and a cliched cute ending. Instead, the story steadily unfolds drawing the viewer in and building something that leaves a mark. The movie starts a little slow, but as the tagline of the movie goes ""you wait,"" and by the end of it I was completely drawn in by the story and the quite, but moving representation of love. I do not want to give too much away, but instead encourage you to view this movie for yourself and enjoy the story as it unfolds as I did.

*Quick warning: this is not for those who enjoy the quicker paced movies or for those who are looking for just a light-hearted rom-com. While I thought this movie was truly exquisite, it may not be for everyone, it is slower paced, but this results in phenomenal character development. As I said, it may not be for everyone, but I still encourage you to watch and hopefully enjoy ""The Recipe."" I sure did.",1343952000,10,1512,4.478260869565218
