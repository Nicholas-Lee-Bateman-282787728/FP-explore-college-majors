2246746,5,B0007WFUGA,"Of all the shows I loved as a kid, DangerMouse is probably holds the dearest place in my heart.  Like all great kids shows, there is plenty for adults to enjoy.  The show never insults your intelligence or panders as so many so-called cartoons of today do.

If you've already seen DangerMouse, you don't need a sales pitch from me.  If you haven't, BUY THIS NOW!

Oh, and in case anyone is reading this wondering what episodes are available on the 2 discs, here they are:

Disc 1:

Rogue Robots

Who Stole the Bagpipes?

Trouble With Ghosts

The Chicken Run

The Martian Misfit

The Dream Machine

Lord of the Bungle

Die Laughing

The World of Machines

Ice Station Camel

The Plague of Pyramids

The Mystery of the Lost Chord - The pilot episode.  This features very different voices for DM & Penfold.  This is essentially the same exact episode as Who Stole The Bagpipes, except that the dialogue and ending are different, there is no narration and the episode is about 5 minutes longer than the redone version.

Disc 2:

Custard

Close Encounters of the Absurd Kind

The Duel

The Day of the Suds

The Bad Luck Eye of the Little Yellow God

The Four Tasks of Danger Mouse",1120176000,6,1175,4.497607655502392
2246747,4,B0007WFUGA,"I got this DVD in my mail this afternoon and watched it all the way through. It was good seeing DM and Penfold back on US TV screens after so long. The only problem I have with DM on the DVD is the short segments for Custerd, and Day of the suds... Hearing the theme over and over again can be tiresome. I look at it another way too. This is the way British kids may have watched the show.
It was good to see some ""background"" on the main characters, but I would like to have seen some information on the voice actors as well. The Never before seen cartoon is a different verson of one of the cartoons that would air during the first 2 years of the show. The voices of DM and Penfold were done by different actors, also the ending was different as well.
Lord of the Bungle was a good one, but suffered with a tinny sound to the audio at times. Aside from a few nitpicks, A & E did a great job bringing the White Wonder back to US TVs... I am wanting more....",1117497600,,958,3.9947916666666665

2246749,5,B0007WFUGA,"Ah yes, who could ever forget the wonderfully madcap adventures of the greatest secret agent in the world?  I certainly can't, because as a child of the 80's I remember with fondness this wonderful British import that featured every afternoon on Nickelodeon when I grew up.  Although I was but a wee tike when I watched this cartoon series, the announcement that the show was coming to DVD was music to my ears.  It has been years since I've seen the series, but with the show coming out on DVD, I long to watch the series now that I am an adult, in order to fully appreciate the elements of satire, wit, whimsy and madcap lunacy each episode brings.

This is a show that you can easily watch with your kids, and even enjoy as an adult as well, it may have come out during the 80's, but it has an overall appeal that is simply timeless.",1116979200,3,836,4.305732484076433
2246750,5,B0007WFUGA,"This is one of the best cartoons I watched growing up. I can even recall the theme song from this cartoon. Man, you need to get this DVD when it releases. DangerMouse is one if not maybe the best crime-solving detective cartoon that I ever knew. Do not miss out on this!!!!!!!!!!",1116460800,,279,4.384615384615385
2246751,5,B0007WFUGA,"What can be said about Danger Mouse?  That it is my favorite cartoon of the 80s?  Yes, that's true.  That it is brilliantly funny yet family friendly?  Yes that's true as well.  That it is one part James Bond, three parts British (think Monty Python and Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy), and one part insanity? Spot on, once again.  As far as I'm concerned Cosgrove came out of nowhere in the 80s to deliver me a knockout punch.  A children's series that actually relies on good writing has always been a rarity.  But a children's series with humor that has even more appeal to me as an adult is nearly unique.  Danger Mouse has that touch of glorious satire that can insult every inch of you while making you laugh uproariously. The show also has a wonderful sense of the random.  One of my favorite dialogues in the series (in the episode Custard)has Penfold (Danger Mouse's head hamster) discussing bicycle clips and he suddenly compares them to toothbrushes.  This wonderful display of non sequitur is a prime example of what to expect from this series.  Hilarious absurd.  Magnificently silly. In short, what can be said of Danger Mouse is best said by the first line of his own insanely addicting theme song.

He's the greatest!

Now that DM's finally getting a dvd release.  I couldn't be happier.  All I can say to A&E is ""MORE!!!""  Why if they don't continue the releases (as well as release DM's wonderful spinoff Count Duckula), I shall do what all good secret agents do ... PANIC!!!!!!",1116028800,6,1498,4.652671755725191
2246752,5,B0007WFUGA,"Although this cartoon has been available as a DVD set in England for several years, the PAL format is all but unwatchable here in the United States. And up to now all WE'VE had available are some poorly-packaged episodes on VHS ... and honestly, who bothers buying VHS anymore? But at last this beloved cartoon (which ran on Nickelodeon back in the early 1980s) has been given its U.S. DVD release, and I couldn't be happier.

""Danger Mouse"" is a British cartoon about the world's greatest secret agent. With the help of his timid hamster assistant, Penfold, Danger Mouse is constantly saving the world from the villainous toad, Baron Silas Greenback, who in turn is assisted by his crow henchman, Stiletto, and his cute but mischievous pet caterpillar, Nero. The humor here is often very British and very dry. Example:

Danger Mouse: ""Penfold, do you know how angry I am with that toad?""
Penfold: ""No, but if you'll hum a few bars, I'll join in on the second chorus.""

Fans who used to watch this cartoon on Nickelodeon may find the voice of Stiletto a bit puzzling. This DVD collection has Stiletto's original Italian accent. Apparently Nickelodeon was concerned that Italian-Americans might be somewhat offended by a ""Mafioso"" stereotype, so the voice of Stiletto was re-dubbed with a cockney accent for the U.S.

Not much in the way of extras here, just some character files and the unseen pilot episode, which is interesting but not particularly valuable.",1114214400,16,1460,4.898785425101215
2246753,5,B0007WFUGA,"DANGER MOUSE!  I loved this series!  I'm so happy Danger Mouse has finally received a US DVD release!  The series was hilarious and action-packed, with Danger Mouse fighting it out with his arch-nemesis Greenback.  The show had a huge amount of creativity, as well as absolutely strange, absurd, yet memorable characters.  David Jason provides the voice of the main star himself, as well as Count Duckula.  I must say, he is pure genius!  Danger Mouse also introduced Count Duckula, however, he was a villain in this series!  Let's hope for a Count Duckula US release as well, as like Danger Mouse it was also very funny and inventive.  However, I am more than satisfied with this Danger Mouse set.  This is one just plain brilliant cartoon.",1112140800,6,741,4.809523809523809

2246755,5,B0007WFUGA,I've wanted to own Danger Mouse for a long time.  It was a favorite cartoon for me when I was a small child.  I now have a small child of my own and wanted to share Danger Mouse with him.  He absolutely loves the show.  He laughs hysterically at the physical humor and he immediately loved the characters.

2246756,1,B0007WFUGA,"This TV Series is very cute, but it isn't good because it's boring and it gives you a headache. Maybe some other season are better but, at least, this one's not worth buying it. It's actually made for younger viewers, but it's way different than Hanna-Barbera cartoons. The animation is horrible, the episodes are too short, and the music's even worse. You can only stand watching 2 or 3 episodes per day and the sound or the voices are horrible, too. It's that kind of cartoon you see it's really childish and for kids about 3 years-old. I don't understand why people say it's like 007 because it's a real drag.

 The DVD itself is not so good, either, because there aren't a lot of options and languages.

 It really looks like it's a good series, but it's not the kind of DVD to buy it. I love old cartoons like Hanna-Barbera, Speed Racer, and Jonny Quest but this is not the same type. I really like the character itself and I think it's vey cute, but don't buy this.",1249862400,,971,4.377777777777778

I still love the classic British humor displayed here and the cast of characters are great.

2246762,4,B0007WFUGA,"I seem to recall that when Dangermouse used to come on Nickelodeon, the voice of Stilletto was different. I mean it sounded with a British accent. Now it's more of a Spanish accent. Personally, I like the latter better. There are times when it's hard to understand what Stilletto has said in this new language of his.

I don't know what person or persons changed his accent or why but I wished they could have left well enough alone. It wasn't broken so why'd they try to fix it?

I guess we'll have to tune in next time and find out while I go and find some web sites pertaining to this act.

If all else fails for me, I'm going to just mimmic over the hard-to-understand voice of Stilletto and speak from what I remember him actually saying in the series.",1145404800,,757,4.316901408450704
2246763,3,B0007WFUGA,"This British import that aired on Nickelodeon during the 1980s and early 1990s was ironic, self-effacing, laid-back, educational, and funny. It also ripped off Warner Bros. excessively, and its portrayals of some peoples would not pass PC muster in 2006 America. Perhaps the series' biggest blunder was not having any tongue-in-cheek fun with their proto-Dr. Evil villain Baron Greenback, who only gets more tedious and pedantic with time. But the series was a breath of fresh air in an era that brought us the insufferable ""Smurfs"" and ""Captain Planet,"" the corny ""Care Bears"" and ""ShirtTales,"" and the creepy ""Pee-Wee's Playhouse.""

Penfold the hamster is one of cartoondom's most adorable characters. With the cowardice of Shaggy and the silliness and high-pitched voice of the Three Stooges' Curly, he steals almost every scene he's in. DangerMouse, ""the greatest secret agent in the world,"" is his earnest, overconfident straight man, and the rotund Colonel K is their disengaged, scatterbrained boss. Then there's the pompous narrator who delivers wonderful parodies of ""tune in next time!"" teasers from the bygone days of serial adventures.

Add to all this a little Dadaism a la Monty Python and you've got a kids' cartoon series that's due for a minor rediscovery.

This DVD contains a fun historical tidbit - the pilot episode, which reveals just how much the series was improved before it aired for real. In the pilot, DangerMouse is like a stuffier version of James Bond, sounding arrogant and deep-voiced, while Penfold is also deeper-voiced and apparently Scottish.

Unfortunately, the other features are bare-bones - the ""karaoke"" segment truncates the theme song, and the character bios look like they were slapped together by someone who was under time pressure and barely knew Dangermouse from Super Dave.",1141257600,3,1823,5.275862068965517
2246764,5,B0007WFUGA,"I really liked this DVD version of dangermouse.. i contains alot of episodes that aired when it was on the air on ""nickelodeon"".. the first seasons episodes were only 10 minutes each and the others were 20 minutes.. on seasons 2 and 3 ..i like the episodes the 'world of machines' an episode i haven't since i was a child.. i wondered how DM and penfold got back from the planet of machines.. while Greenback attention was diverted he jumped i the machine and left Greenback up there.that was great thinking..i was already buying dangermouse tapes from the U.S. and in England.. becuase that's were danger is from England-so the country that made the caroon would most likey have more copies of the cartoon than any other country..it's worth every penny..but the tapes would not work in VCR so i had to get them converted into U.S. display from some place in U.S.i still say it was worth it.. i hope they release and complete seasons and 5 and 6 soon.. i already have most of the episodes from seasons 3 and 4 anyway on VHS...Danger Mouse meets Count Duckula on one show where he tricked him to giving him his 2 feathers..for some ingredient..for greenback..i still liked DM better than Countduckla.. well i'll be collecting these DVDs until they stop making them.. at least i don't have to get these DVDS converted i can just view them right away when they come. well enjoy DM fans u won't be dissapointed..",1137888000,2,1408,4.613545816733068
2246765,3,B0007WFUGA,"The first 4 seasons have now been released in the U.S. after A&E got the rights, announced the impending release and then announced that they weren't going to be released. Seasons 5-6 are soon to be released and I'm reasonably certain that they will be released because A&E obviously isn't investing a lot of cash in the project so they have little to lose.

My biggest gripe with these DVD's is that in many respects they aren't much of an improvement over the awful collections that have trickled out so far on VHS and DVD. There was no restoration done to the video or audio that I can detect. In a couple of cases, I've gone back to my decade-old VHS copies and found the video superior to that on these DVD's.

The lack of bonus material is very disappointing. Where are the biographies of the creators? The story of the studio? How the cartoon was pitched? How it ended up in on U.S. tv's? Who is this Danger Mouse guy, anyway? Nick had a few promo bits with the creators and VO artists and how to draw the characters and none of that stuff has made it to this DVD collection. I suspect that nobody even asked the folks at Viacom for it.

At the same time, this is the only place that you're likely to find the entire collection in three small boxes (assuming that seasons 5-6 will come in a single box as 1-2 and 3-4 did). For this reason, if for no other, it's worth buying the collections if you're a fan.

I should point out that season one is not Danger Mouse at its best. I suspect that several people making negative comments about the stories compared to their happy memories are recalling later episodes when the writing and animation were much tighter.",1135209600,5,1668,4.4058441558441555
2246766,3,B0007WFUGA,"Danger Mouse is a television cartoon from the 1980's.  Created in England, it was made famous on this side of the pond by Nickelodeon in its early years on the air.  It features the adventures of the world's greatest secret agent, Danger Mouse.  Assisted by Penfold (a hamster), they must continually save the world from the plots of Baron Silas Greenback (a toad) and his henchman Stilletto (a crow).

This set contains the cartoon from the first two seasons of the show.  Season one had 11 episodes.  Each episode is about seven and a half to eight minutes each.  As such, the stories are a bit weak and decidedly short.  Still, Danger Mouse faces a planet of machines, a dream cloud tuned to Penfold's worries, missing bagpipes, attack robots, elephants turning into sugar cubes, and some deadly laughing gas.

Season two changes the format significantly.  There are only six storylines this time, but each episode is 25 minutes in length.  Originally, these episodes were broken down into five-minute segments with cliffhangers and their own intros and closing credits.  These breaks are preserved on this DVD, but fortunately, chapter breaks make skipping past the repetitive credits and intros easy.  Season two finds Danger Mouse facing Greenback in a duel for the fate of the world, dealing with a lot of bad luck, and fighting washing machines programmed to kill him.

I never watched Danger Mouse much when it was on TV, but I remember liking what I had seen.  Unfortunately, this set didn't live up to my memories.  While I still enjoyed the bad puns and corny jokes, I found them to be too far between.  Furthermore, the plots are just a little too silly for my taste, frequently finding Danger Mouse in space for no real reason.  I realize that this is a tongue in cheek spoof of James Bond and Dr. Who, among others, but this show just seems to fall a little flat to me.  More then anything it's probably because I have never completely gotten British humor.

Those who do remember the show with fondness from their childhood will like this set.  The picture, while showing a few spots of dust and grain, is very good for being a low budget show from the 80's.  Extras are limited to character descriptions and the unaired pilot episode.  Basically, this is a longer version of the ""Who Stole the Bagpipes?"" episode from season 1.  What I found most interesting was that the voices for some of the characters changed slightly when the show actually started production.

This is one part of my childhood that I didn't need to revisit.  Others, with a bigger fondness for the show, just might enjoy it as an adult as well.",1135123200,6,2634,4.708971553610503
2246767,5,B0007WFUGA,"Who's behind these nefarious deeds but none other than that prince of pandemonium, Baron Von Greenback? I toad you so. That's not a real bit from the show, but if that sort of humor evinces a wince and a groan, you'll probably like Danger Mouse. For at last on DVD, here are 17 episodes (seasons one and two) of Britain's intrepid rodent, Danger Mouse, and his sidekick hamster, Penfold. This surrealistic serial, for the deprived who haven't seen it, combines one part Monty Python, one part James Bond, one part Dr. Who and many more random bits in an entirely original, animated cartoon that gets it right, using its limited animation budget to design unforgettable characters, with minimalist, cut-out paper backgrounds.

But we must backtrack, because 17 episodes is a misnomer. The first season consisted of eleven long, single episode stories, sometimes shown with another Brit toon, ""Bananaman."" Launching in the UK in 1981, DM appeared three years later stateside on Nickelodeon. But the second season moved to the cliff-hanger format, with six shows consisting of five five minute segments per show (here called an ""episode""). Each segment recaps all the other segments so far, which works well on the show but on the DVD is slightly annoying. Nevertheless, it's a brilliant limited animation move, allowing the producers to reuse bits over and over, and landing the show securely in the long, distinguished line of episodic, cliff-hanger cartoons from Crusader Rabbit and Ruff and Reddy to The King and Odie and the kings of the cliff-hanger (which even showed them falling off a cliff), Rocky and Bullwinkle.

But as the daffy, depraved fans who have seen it know, DM's other great draw is  narrator David Jason who, starting off small in season one, really gets going in season two. Once again, this puts DM in a great lineage of limited animation 'toons driven by great narrators, from Gary Owens of ""Laugh In"" in Roger Ramjet to William Conrad reporting the saga of Moose and Squirrel. The last episode of season two also introduces Count Duckula, who had his own spinoff cartoon on Nick. A bar in New York had a sign urging silence during the Huckleberry Hound Show. What must it be like in a UK pub during Danger Mouse?",1127260800,11,2236,4.878947368421053
2246768,5,B0007WFUGA,Danger Mouse is the best.  My fiance' and I have missed this show since it no longer airs on TV.  We are really glad to see it on DVD.  The pilot episode is great.  It's cool to see the changes from the pilot to the series.  I hope to see later seasons on DVD soon.,1124409600,2,265,3.7454545454545456
2246769,5,B0007WFUGA,"I've searched and I've waited for years, and finally my prayers have been answered -- Danger Mouse has hit the U.S. on DVD!  As I sat watching, captivated and grinning like an idiot, I simply felt that I needed to do my part to spread the joy of Danger Mouse.

So what makes DM so special?  Plenty!  Though the episodes are very short which limits the depth of the stories, the show compensates in countless ways.  For one, the characters remember their past.  For instance, when Agent 57 and Buggles the Pigeon return in later episodes, DM and Penfold mention in adequate detail the last time they saw them.  This adds a feeling of continuity to the series and, ironically, makes the characters seem more ""real"".

Then there's the humor, where the brilliance of the show truly shines through.  Ridiculous slapstick at one moment can be followed immediately with a clever (and sometimes subtle) pun or cultural reference in the next.  I believe this is why the show appeals to all ages.

The show's greatest strength, however, has to be in the dialog.  It's nothing short of brilliant.  If you have a ""punny"" sense of humor, then every episode will give you something to laugh about.  The characters (especially Penfold and Colonel K) also tend to take things out of context and respond in hilarious though completely understandable ways.  It may take a moment to realize just how Penfold interpreted the statement to which he's responding, leading to a little ""ah ha!"" experience followed by a fit of laughter.

I simply cannot praise this show enough.  It has stuck with me in my memory and in my vocabulary for over 15 years.  To me, that's a testament to this brilliant and unforgettable cartoon.",1124064000,11,1700,4.744027303754266
2246770,5,B0007WFUGA,"Ah, Nickelodeon in the '80's.  Who would forget shows like ""You Can't do That On Television"" and ""Danger Mouse"" ?  I know I can't!  Like the rest of the kids, I watched Nickelodeon all of the time.  Nickelodeon had the best shows for kids.

  Danger Mouse is the world's smallest secret agent.  With his sidekick, Penfold, DM solves off-the-wall mysteries.  The one thing different about the DVD is that the show is divided into 5-parts, instead of just two.  This fact shouldn't be a problem for DM lovers, since you can skip the intro and end credits.  This show is still fresh and new, since I haven't watched Danger Mouse since it went off.  I'm looking forward to other Nickelodeon shows to appear on DVD, such as ""You Can't do That On Television""",1123200000,2,752,4.571428571428571

2246772,5,B0007WFUGA,"Quick, what is the greatest program ever to be shown on Nickelodeon, and if your answer has ""Sponge"" or ""Pants"" in the title you fail badly, the answer is DANGER MOUSE and he's on DVD!  One of the best cartoons ever, my childhood hero, and even after going off the air so long ago it still feels fresh and fun, I watched everyday when I was 4 and would probably still keep watching it had it not vanished like it did.  While the drawings do show their age with washed out colors at times it doesn't diminish my love for the program.  Keep in mind one thing folks these episodes are pulled from the British versions first of all, the second season is broken up into five seperate parts, not two like we had, this will mean alot more recapping in between the show.  Also the second season has a slightly shorter intro.  Next off Stiletto has an itallian voice and accent not the cockney british one he got saddled with over here.  Funny how even those many years ago we could be that anal retenive so not to offend anyone.  At least by finally buying these DVD's him saying ""Baroni"" all the time finally made some sense.

As far as special features go, it's a slim package.  No commentaries, no tributes or anything.  We get a lost pilot epsiode which is very similar to the ""Who stole the bagpipes"" episode.  In it Danger Mouse has a much more ""british"" sounding voice and Penfold sounds Irish.  DM is also a lot more like James Bond too with his mannerisms.  Greenback (named Greenteeth) also has a few more lines and other then that it's the same from the reular run episode.  The only other special feature is a know the characters segment.  By the way no remastering or retuning of the music....GOOD! they are just how I remember them.

A prime example of a good show for kids, little violense clean humor and imagination.  Lets get some more of those old Nick shows out there too okay, a good list to pick from would be Hey Dude, Salute Your Shorts and yes, You Can't Do That On Television (At the very least in that shows case, complete unedited epsiodes and  only the episodes with Christine of course, who watched after she left, anyway....).

I will be on my hands and knees praying that we get all of the other seasons on DVD, and at only $20 or so a pop, you can't beat that price.  Heres hoping that Danger Mouse will save me from lousy programming again!",1120694400,2,2366,4.38302752293578

I watched great shows like Herge's Adventures of Tintin, Mysterious Cities of Gold, & of course Danger Mouse.  I liked it back then, I really liked it when I discovered the VHS tapes a few years later but now I have to admit it is by far my favorite comedy series of all-time.  I can watch all the good episodes over & over & laugh each time.  Sometimes, I laugh more in subsequent viewing then the first one believe it or not.  And the humor's good-natured 100% of the time, not cruel like Looney Tunes is sometimes, nor is it gross like too many cartoons these days.  I love just about all the characters.  My favorite is Penfold.  He's a hysterically funny coward, who spouts puns that seem to come out of nowhere (""The engine's knocking.  Perhaps it wants to come in."").  My second favorite is the Narrator, or as he's really named Isenbaed (Yes, that is his actual name.  It's in 2 episodes at least.).  He constantly knocks the show down a peg while making some great puns of his own.  Danger Mouse himself is my 3rd favorite.  The puns he makes are so terrible you think you could've seen them coming a mile away.  Colonel K is pretty funny as well.  The only weak character in this show is unfortunately the main villain, Baron Silas Greenback.  He's not very funny, & he's in just about every single episode for the first few seasons.  That gets annoying at times, but his henchmen do their best to make up for him.  His pet caterpillar Nero is cute & funny, & his right-hand Italian-accented crow Stiletto is one of my favorite henchmen ever.  I think it's neat how his voice actor was one of the head writers, so he made sure he always got good lines.  Great show overall, but something that should be addressed is that it took a bit before it hit its stride.  I have seen worst first seasons of shows (The Animated Series for Iron Man & Fantastic Four), but this is still my least favorite Danger Mouse collection.  I would personally recommend getting seasons 5 & 6 first to try, & if you like that get the rest of the series.

The 2 seasons have different formats.  The format for the first season is 11 minute episodes, of which I like to watch 2 or 3 in one sitting.  The second season has stories consisting of five episodes that run for 5 minutes each with openings & credits, but thankfully the DVD allows you to skip them when you want to watch them all in one go (again, that's how I do it).  I like the second season a bit more, as each individual episode has the Narrator recapping the previous episode(s) (some of these recaps are really funny) at the end asking silly questions & even criticizing the show at times (""Is there any way I can get off this show?""), though not to the extent in later seasons.  That's one of the biggest reasons I like them better.  Here he's funny & all, but he's too nice.  It always cracks me up whenever he rants about how bad the show is.  In 2 of the best episodes ever he even demands the action be stopped while he points out some fallacies in logic or scientific inaccuracies, & while he does so the characters grow bored.  Now that's genius writing!  But really, what's here isn't bad.  The synopsizes come from Wikipedia.

1. Rogue Robots:  Danger Mouse discovers that Baron Greenback is behind a wave of attack robots that have been going after agents that work with DM.  An above average first episode.  A-

2.  Who Stole the Bagpipes?:  Danger Mouse and Penfold travel to Scotland to keep Greenback from destroying the world with music from all the bagpipes in the world.  Pretty funny.  B+

3.  Trouble With Ghosts:  Greenback captures Colonel K and has the Colonel send Danger Mouse and Penfold on holiday to a haunted castle in Transylvania's Castle.  Some real good laughs here.  A-

4.  Chicken Run:  Greenback steals a growth serum from Professor Skwakencluck and with it creates giant chickens to take over the world once and for all. And for once, Penfold saves the day!  Not the best, but it is funny & it introduces 2 recurring characters.  B

5.  The Martian Misfit:  Greenback creates a 'Martian' to keep Danger Mouse busy while he sets out on a crime spree!  Not very good, but the ending is funny.  C

6.  The Dream Machine:  Greenback drives Danger Mouse and Penfold crazy with his dream machine.  The best episode of the season.  A very funny & surreal episode.  A+

7.  Lord of the Bungle:  A fall causes Penfold to think he is the Lord of the Jungle when he and Danger Mouse try to find out why elephants are being turned into sugar cubes.  A great episode.  A

8.  Die Laughing:  Greenback is causing the world's leaders to laugh themselves to death in his latest plot to become ruler of the Earth.  Another great episode that introduces another recurring character; Agent 57, the master of disguise.  A

9.  World of Machines:  Greenback kidnaps Penfold to lure Danger Mouse into a spaceship and send both of them to a planet ruled by machines.  Just like the Martian Misfit, not good but it has a great bit with the Narrator at the end.  C

10.  Ice Station Camel:  Danger Mouse must stop Greenback who has stopped the Earth's rotation which in turn has cancelled gravity.  A funny episode with some good continuity nods.  A-

11.  Plague of Pyramids:  Danger Mouse discovers Greenback is behind a plague of pyramids which are popping up all over England and threatening to sink.  Again, not one I could watch over & over again, but there are a couple funny moments (including once again the Narrator's bit at the end).  C+

Season 2 begins on disc 2 with:  12.  Custard:  Danger Mouse travels to outer space to find the Custard-Mite Of Glut and bring him to Earth after Greenback floods the world with instant custard.  I've always loved this episode, with its spoofs of various sci-fi films/series (there's references to Alien & Doctor Who), & some very surreal scenes.  A+

13.  Close Encounters of the Absurd Kind:  Aliens capture Danger Mouse and Penfold for use in an experiment when they journey to the Bermuda Triangle out in the sea on the trail of Baron Greenback.  The worst episode of this season.  There are some funny moments, but they are few & far between.  C

14.  The Duel:  Greenback tells Danger Mouse that he will go straight and be good, if Danger Mouse beats him in a duel and if Danger Mouse promises to quit his job if he is the loser. Unfortunately, the Baron has some tricks up his sleeve.  Something of an old plotline, but this is still pretty funny.  B+

15.  The Day of the Suds:  Washing machines under the control of Greenback threaten to destroy London City.  A funny concept & the script lives up to it.  A-

16.  The Bad Luck Eye of the Little Yellow God:  Greenback has stolen a bad luck charm for use in a bad luck ray. Danger Mouse manages to get it and attempts to give it back to the original owners who don't really want it back.  The best episode of the season.  This is a constantly hilarious gem that gives a taste of what's to come in the later seasons.  A+

17.  The Four Tasks of Danger Mouse:  Greenback kidnaps Penfold to get Danger Mouse to bring him four ingredients needed for an evil spell to take over the world.  Danger Mouse meets Count Duckula when one ingredient turns out to be the feather of a vampire duck.  Any episode with Duckula in it is great, & though he's only in it for one part, the other parts are good too.  A

So let me see, that's 11 short episodes, which given my need to watch 2 in one sitting makes it 5 & a half, minus the 3 I didn't like makes it 4.  Plus the five good episodes from season 2 make 9 good episodes out of 11 & a half total.  So I give it 5 stars because I love Danger Mouse and what's here is good but it does get better next collection & gets incredibly good with the last 2.",1368662400,,7861,4.394700139470014

8052859,5,B0007WFUGA,"Do you like British Comedy? Do you like animation? Do you like really bad jokes? Do you like anthropomorphic animals? Then you'll LOVE Danger Mouse.

DM is a British kids show from the '90s that is a sendup of every spy thriller ever made done with typical British ""zany"" humor and an apparent love of the genre that kids AND adults will love. In fact, if you have young ones who are just a bit too young for Monty Python/Benny Hill type humor, Danger Mouse is a good way to have them cut their teeth on Jolly Ole England's brand of yucks until they ARE old enough.",1354752000,2,565,4.280373831775701
