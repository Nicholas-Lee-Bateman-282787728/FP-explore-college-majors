8244278,4,B00126N9YA,"If you want to be ""schooled"" about the history and creation of the Federal Reserve system, this is a documentary for you. It's not a flashy or entertaining in a ""Hollywood style"", but it's an excellent historical and educational video about the creation of the Federal Reserve, the IRS, etc. Most Americans would be shocked to learn that the Federal Reserve is a PRIVATE business entity and NOT part of the US government! It's owned and ruled by elitist banking people in the US and Europe who don't give a hoot about the average guy. Our politicians may be guilty of mis-handling OUR money, but the Federal Reserve and their ilk are actually much worse violators. This video was produced by the Mises Institute [...] and you can watch a low resolution version of it on their site. Mises also has a channel on YouTube as well called ""misesmedia"".",1210118400,8,846,4.684563758389261
