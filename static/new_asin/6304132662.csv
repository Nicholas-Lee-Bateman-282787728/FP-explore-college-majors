8170173,5,6304132662,"We had this video when our kids were small, and unfortunately I sold it in a garage sale when I thought they were too old for it.  Our whole family missed that video soooo much.  We talked about it, repeated lines from it, and laughed about it so much that I just had to find it again. I have been looking for several years and I finally came upon it on Amazon.  I can't tell you how happy my husband and kids are that we finally have it around again.  By the way my kids are 25 and 21 now!!!I highly recommend this video for any family who loves Kermit!!",1280707200,2,555,4.0181818181818185
8170174,5,6304132662,"This is a great video with many highlights from the series. A personal favorite is a song called ""At Your Library"", which features the ENTIRE '80s cast. You will also see some classic Kermit the Frog moments in which he interviews several fairy tale characters. Another top-notch effort from the Children's Television Workshop.
