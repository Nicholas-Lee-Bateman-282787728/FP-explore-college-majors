4285444,2,B0047T74CM,"I hate it when they take a phenomenal actor (in this case two), put them in a movie that is supposed to feature them at their best (which it does) but that comes off as the most boring waste of time imaginable. Such is the case with STONE, the new DVD release starring Robert DeNiro and Edward Norton.

The story focuses on Jack Mabry (DeNiro), a parole officer in a large prison about to retire. Jack has been detached from life for some time. His is an existence of merely going through the motions, feeling little if anything. He begins the film this way and continues on, searching for the meaning of life.

Into Jack's world enters Stone (Norton), an arsonist convicted of torching his grandparent's house after being involved with their murder. Stone is set for release depending on the recommendation of Jack. The two have conversations in Jack's attempt to discover if Stone has been rehabilitated or not, if he possesses any sign of remorse. And in these few moments the best of the film is revealed.

At first arrogant and obnoxious, Stone undergoes a series of events that bring about an epiphany in his soul. He begins to seek out religion and life and discover himself. But as he grows in his search Jack falters. Seeking out his own answers, Jack finds hollowness inside of himself that he can't seem to fill.

While these conversations go on, Stone also attempts to play his ace in the hole by having his wife, Lucetta (Milla Jovovich) seduce Jack. The pair begin an affair slowly with Lucetta first approaching Jack to just discuss her husband's release and then slowly teasing him until he falls for her seduction. Just one more attempt and connecting with someone that Jack fails with.

Whether or not Stone is eventually released is pretty much a given answer. But the question becomes is he the same man who went in or has he truly changed? Sadly this isn't the main focus of the film which is more on Jack and how the whole event affects him.

All in all while it sounds like it might make an interesting film (and it probably did on paper) the movie is a let down. I didn't walk in expecting an action packed adventure. I didn't even expect a sexual thriller, though there is some bit of that included. I did expect a better story that didn't rely so much on distant, longing looks and drawn out still life visuals. Some directors seem to forget the term ""moving pictures"" means that films do indeed move. Many times this one just sits there.

A number of critics and viewers have lauded the lead actors in this film, discussing the fact that they are among the greatest ever and that this film gives them ample opportunity to flex their acting muscles. The fact is that watching them rehearse scenes from other films would make for a more entertaining movie than this one.",1295222400,15,2795,4.578
4285445,5,B0047T74CM,"'Stone' was not received well critically. It was marketed as a prison drama in which Norton and De Niro tensely face off. It isn't. Once you get over that fact and accept the movie on its own terms, your mind and heart can be opened by its powerful reflections.

  I believe great cinema works best as a mirror. This describes 'Stone'; not all viewers will see the same story. Some will interpret Norton as a lying sociopath, while I saw him as a man who maintains the upperhand through real--though accidental--spiritual enlightenment. Actually, guilt and enlightenment are the two main undercurrents in the characters' stories. Norton seeks his enlightenment through a religion that helps him to shut his fast mouth and listen; De Niro seeks escape from his ""honest and upright"" lifestyle through sexual enlightenment. De Niro's life dissolves while Norton's evolves, and the process is nothing short of compelling. You may not expect the end result.

  Some interesting sidebars: The religion Norton seeks out is referred to as ""Zuckangor: The Religion of the Light and Sound of God,"" startlingly similar to Eckankar (which I was recently and coincidentally introduced to in a local bookstore). The soundtrack reflects this religion, so listen close for slowly building tones that indicate important moments in character development. Also on this note, watch Norton's hair.

  The acting is incredible (I was surprised by Jovovich, too!), the cinematography is thought-provoking, and the story is beautiful. I agree with the reviewer that thinks this movie will age well.",1294790400,77,1574,5.214285714285714
4285446,5,B0047T74CM,"Stone was marketed and sold as a psychological thriller/prison drama. It is not (which disappointed many viewers). It starts out that way, but as Stone wanders down a path of ""enlightenment"" the film takes an existential turn. In this Film Noir, Stone (Edward Norton) is a convicted arsonist seeking early release and inner peace. His wife, as the femme fatale, helps the cause by leading his parole officer (Robert De Niro, for once) off the straight and narrow. The film tackles issues of morality, seeking/hearing God, meaninglessness, and isolation. That said, there is plenty of eye candy with the unconventionally sexy and beautiful Milla Jovovich. And Edward Norton looks as good or better in a beater in his 40s than he did in his 20s.

Re: ""Stone""

Dear Mr. Mimran,

It has come to our attention that the script has become unworkable, a feat we feel has been quite acerbated by Glenn Beck signing on as a ghost producer. What in its original form was a meaningful study of morality and basic human impulses has lately devolved into an ambling discourse on religion that at times border on fringe spiritual cults such as Eckankar.

Since we can't afford to fall out of favor with Rupert Murdoch (or George Soros for that matter), we feel that our hands are tied at this point regarding any remedies to the script. We feel the best possible thing to do at this point would be to consider bringing in Edward Norton to play the title role. He has expressed interest because he feels pigeonholed in the ""Hulk"" franchise. And, as we all know, Edward Norton is like cinematic bacon; he makes everything better. Please get back to us about this at your earliest convenience.

Sincerely,

Avi Lerner

4285448,4,B0047T74CM,"Robert DeNiro plays a parole officer about to retire and Edward Norton is cast as a convicted arsonist, trying to convince him that he should get an early release from prison in this gripping ""noirish"" thriller from director John Curran.

Rather than ""convince,"" the wily Norton is, actually, trying to ""manipulate"" DeNiro into writing a favorable assessment.  He even goes so far as having his beautiful, off-the-wall wife (Milla Jovovich) seduce the corrections official in order to accomplish that.

Though Angus McLachlan's screenplay sometimes tends to meander, it is populated with a quartet of fascinating multi-dimensional characters, none of which are particularly likable, yet all who are seeking some sort of spiritual enlightenment.

DeNiro, in a loveless marriage (to Frances Conroy), finds that his church going cannot help him avoid his darker impulses, while Norton, after he witnesses a fellow prisoner being murdered, claims to have had a religious epiphany.  The operative word here is ""claims,"" because we're never quite sure if he's telling the truth or if this apparent change is simply a ruse to get what he wants.

What makes STONE so compelling is its performances.  DeNiro, in one of the most complex roles he has had in years, plays a man fighting the evil within him, while Norton utilizes his unique talent to bring to life a chameleon-like sociopath.  Though she does not have a lot to do, Ms. Conroy is brilliant as the mostly silent, religious wife who has bargained away her life out of fear.

Certainly Ms. Jovovich, cast as the bold, sexy wife who will stop at nothing to get what she wants, delivers the most colorful and surprising performance.  Part bimbo and part seductress, this is one of those women of film noir who would give Barbara Stanwyck's ""Phyllis Dietrichson"" (DOUBLE INDEMNITY) a run for her money.  And, it is also prime evidence that Ms. Jovovich is capable of doing material much more interesting than the RESIDENT EVIL franchise.

The DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment contains a ""Making of"" featurette.

4285449,4,B0047T74CM,"I think this was a brilliant film -- a deep, thoughtful, poetically-directed tome on the unanswerable spiritual questions of life and a probing, disturbing snapshot of the current state of the American soul -- all wrapped up in the guise of a neo-""post-American greatness"" psychological film noir.  Led by a brilliant Edward Norton and a revitalized Robert De Niro, the acting performances were excellent across the board.  It is a sign of the dreary state of American cinema, art and culture in general that a film of this exceptional caliber is not receiving the accolades and appreciation that it should.

The problem is, the film fails to answer so many basic questions: Why is the DeNiro character so tortured? Why is his wife so unhappy? Why is the DeNiro character always listening to Christian talk radio? No background is provided, so the characters' motivations are unclear.

The Norton character and his wife are despicable, and there's not much to like about the amoral DeNiro character, either.

The result for the viewer is despair and depression. I suppose the filmmakers thought they were doing something ""philosophical."" Not.",1521331200,,655,5.160377358490566

It's not about religion as much as it is about a relationship with the fishbowl of reality and the Integrity of one's convictions. The soundtrack is especially excellent at conveying the concept of four main protagonist existing in four different moral realities.

There's an honesty to the four protagonists. They are all reptilian and driven by selfishness as we all are. Consequences happen that are beyond their control because of their choice of behavior. Some bad some good some lateral some forward some backward.

But the movie doesn't tell you that there are any honorable choices, only that there are choices and consequences and not necessarily that consequences are moral or not but they affect one's perception and relationship to the fish bowl of reality.",1516924800,,925,5.0

8418310,1,B0047T74CM,"I am tired of Hollywood's intolerance of Christianity.  Its clear they know nothing about Christians or the faith.  I'm ok with that, but Hollywood should not create lies about the faith either. The movie's theme is that Christians are really not people of faith...that they really liars, drunks, adulterers, phonies, and hypocrites.  The movie makes fun of Christianity throughout...imagine if they switched the faith of De Niro to Jewish?  Imagine the outrage Hollywood would display. Being Christian doesn't mean you are perfect...far from it.  When a Christian fails and does wrong, it doesn't mean he's a hypocrite...it means he is human, with all the human failures that entails.  Christians are also generally filled with joy...not the sad, boring, pathetic people the movie depicts.  Study after study proves this to be true...Christians (and Jews) tend to be happier, long lived, have lower divorce rates, have lower substance abuse issues, and are better off in general than other groups.  Christian woman, despite how the wife is portrayed in this movie, even have happier and more fulfilling sex lives (USA Today even ran a story on their front page years ago).  Hollywood's goal with this movie is to make people watch it and think ""Man, those Christians are miserable, ugly people"", which is ironic since so many Christian converts do so because Christianity turned their lives around and brought them happiness and peace.  Hollywood even depicts DeNiro, a Christian parole officer who has devoted his life to the rehabilitation of our societies criminals, in a worse light than the man convicted of participating in his grandparents' murder!  So Hollywood, spare us the anti-Christian propaganda....the main theme of this entire movie.  If you think I'm over reacting, listen to the background radio stories playing throughout the movie....most of them deal with politics.  There's a reason for that...those audio clips were hand-picked intentionally.",1516406400,,1966,5.3441558441558445
