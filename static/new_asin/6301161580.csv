330524,3,6301161580,"If Franco Zeffirelli hadn't tampered with the music and made a couple of awful directorial decisions,this could have been a legendary film of a great opera. The singing and the voices themselves are breathtaking,and the acting is also quite good. The print I saw,however (on cable) has a curious  flaw---the voices and orchestra (the famed LaScala Orchestra) are all an  octave (or maybe a semi-octave) lower than they should be, and this is NOT true of the film's soundtrack album. But at least the film corrects the album's greatest flaw,of making the orchestra practically blast you out of  your seat while the voices sound like they're in some kind of tunnel or drainpipe. The disastrous decisions include cutting important small bits of  the opera,inserting the ballet music of the French stage production into the opening celebration, where it does NOT belong,and the most hideous mutilation of all, cutting the awesomely heartrending and beautiful ""Salce"" (The Willow Song), Desdemona's most important solo aria,from the film. (It can be heard on the soundtrack album--Zeffirelli cheats us by having his singers and orchestra pre-record the ENTIRE opera, so that it can be released complete on a soundtrack album, then cutting chunks of the opera only in the actual film.)

This isn't the only crime Zeffirelli commits against this most beautiful of Verdi operas. He leaves in or inserts sound effects and unnecessary flashbacks right into the middle of  his arias,so that while Domingo and Ricciarelli sing their love duet,we see  and hear,in a flashback to Otello's childhood,marauding soldiers on  galloping horses snatching Otello from his mother while she screams  hysterically.(This over the beautiful music and singing!)

On the plus side, Domingo, Ricciarelli and Diaz are memorable, and the photography,sets,and location filming are beautiful.",922838400,37,1859,5.379310344827586

I used this recording for a class on opera I taught in prison and my students loved it and had a very lively discussion about it. It is a very interesting film. It poses many problems about cuts in the original text and insertions of symbols through images to convey meaning that is not necessarily in the words or music. It is Zeffirelli's Otello, as much as Shakespeare's or Verdi's Otello, as Marcia Citron clarified. But the quality of the music and images is superb. The problem, which infuriates many opera lovers, is with the cuts. The willow song is gone! And many other details.

330542,2,6301161580,"Notwithstanding (or maybe because of) all the hallmarks of a Zeffirelli production- lavish costumes, sweeping scenes, etc,- this film succeeds in cheapening this magnificent tragedy. There are some visually impressive scenes, but the wonderful balance that Verdi and Boito attained in their distillation of Shakespeare's play is lost.

I know producers often edit a score to suit their needs, but here Verdi's music is butchered time and again in an eccentric fashion that defies logic and shows complete disdain for the composer. The result is a loss of dramatic impact, and loss of continuity.

The artists act well, but it's difficult to assess the singing: the sounds have been 'rounded', so Ricciarelli (who looks great) sounds like a contralto, and Domingo's voice is unrecognisable. The orchestra is muted much of the time, providing background music to Zeffirelli's fantasy Otello.

The subtitles are geared either for deaf people or very stupid people: Apart from the words we are given handy prompts like 'blaring trumpets', 'twittering birds', and when Otello kills Desdemona we are told that 'she gasps' and 'he moans'.

Other than as an introduction for a novice, or as a collector's piece for somebody who knows Verdi's Otello, this film is not worth buying.",1404259200,,1272,5.220588235294118

330545,1,6301161580,"This film is a stunningly opulent production of Verdi's Otello, featuring three really outstanding singer/actors. You know them all, and how brilliant they are - no need to discuss them.
It is also unnecessary to discuss the chorus and orchestra, and the conductor, this time because they play hardly a discernible role.
They are pushed so far into the background that any opera company anywhere in world might have done the job as well.
So La Scala is nothing more than a sign on the door to confer prestige.
Zefirelli has no feeling for Verdi's opera. This is his production. Within 5 minutes you are plunged into Act III and hear parts of the ballet music for that act.
And so it goes, all the way through. The great oath duet between Iago and Otello is cut right in the middle. The willow song is omitted, so is much else of Boito and Verdi's inspired masterpiece.
I have no idea what contractual arrangements were made with the artists for this video production. But I am frothing at the mouth with disgust for Zefirelli's hubris, presuming to know better than Verdi what is good theatre!
There was never a man more deeply acquainted with the theatre than Verdi, other than Shakespeare himself.

330548,1,6301161580,"It certainly is not Verdi's.

Franco Zeffirelli opened the new Metropolitan Opera House with his production of Samuel Barber's Antony and Cleopatra. He was determined to use all the bells and whistles of which the new house was capable, and in doing so he upstaged the world premiere of the opera, to such an extent that the opera ""failed"" and has never recovered at the Met.

All this is to say that he's done it again. Meat cleaver, as someone else has said, to Verdi's score and the libretto. Visuals may tell a story very well, but when the music which is presumably the raison d'etre of the film is sacrificed, something is clearly out of focus. Anyone looking for a film of Verdi's Otello will have to look elsewhere; this is Zeffirelli's Otello, first and last. A gigantic waste of visuals and a stellar cast.

330550,1,6301161580,"When it comes to a film of an opera I am no purist. I am open to new interpretations. However, I tend to approach film versions of opera with suspicion. And especially Zefferelli productions. He favours 'realism' or rather his luxurious, over the top version of realism. But opera is among the least realistic of media as more enterprising opera directors (Sellars, Carsen, the Alden brothers) accept.

With  Zefferelli, therefore, we can expect lavish 'authenticity'  to be the keynote. Much thought goes into the look of his productions and if you accept his basic approach then you will not be disappointed. It looks great, if conventional. I think he has no imagination, all in all, but copies renaissance paintings and dwells on beautiful imagery.

All this is fine. But musically the man is a barbarian. One expects and accepts cuts so out go the bonfire chorus, the great third act ensemble, and the Willow Song. I can accept these cuts, even as I regret them. What is totally unacceptable to anyone who knows the opera is the constant cutting of musical phrases. There is scarcely a scene which is left intact. Scarcely a minute of music goes by without a disfiguring cut. A few bars here, half a dozen there... I am not sure if this offends against Verdi's musical key schemes but it certainly offends in terms of musical cadences with a phrase bearing no relationship to what has gone before. It is profoundly unmusical. Music is sacrificed always for the picturesque in terms of visuals.

If you are new to opera... It might work. Though it will hardly convince you that opera can be the most intense of all dramatic and/or musical experiences. Better to get a DVD of a good stage production which has musical integrity. This version is simply appalling.",1310342400,3,1765,4.792763157894737

330553,4,6301161580,"We all know that one of opera's greatest qualities is the ability to have two, four or eight people express their emotions at the same time.  Zeffirelli's wonderful gift to us allows us to visualize the places Verdi envisioned as well as each character's inner and outer life.  For example, the marvelous scene where gifts are being brought to Desdemona is an exquisite Botticelli canvas. Anyone can criticize anything - but can we appreciate this unique film?  Domingo and Diaz are incomparable;  if they entrusted their time and effort to Zeffirelli, we can certainly SEE and hear this work of genius in this form.  The lighting alone is worth a serious viewing !",1257724800,,665,4.849557522123894
330554,4,6301161580,"The story is simple, Shakespearean to the absolute extreme you can imagine. The peace and happiness of Venice is disturbed by the simple fact that a Moor, Othello, is welcomed as a hero after a battle he won in Cyprus. He is married to the daughter of a high ranking family, Desdemona, who is carrying in her own name the fact that she has a very doomed, demonized lot due to this very disruptive situation and love. This creates a rivalry, antagonism with the captain of the fleet, Cassio, and the extreme envy if not hatred from Iago is enough to turn a disruption, a breach of balance into a major catastrophe. A handkerchief and its supposed or alleged circulation will sign the end of Desdemona strangled by Othello, a strangulation that is very strange in this film since she will survive it long enough to expose her murderer and then die peacefully. Iago is then exposed in his treachery, killed by Othello with a spear instead of being tortured to death, and Othello finally kills himself with a dagger and still no blood at all. And balance is found again after the drama, the balance of sorrow, mourning and justice in a way. The play by Shakespeare and this opera reveals a deep racist inspiration. Othello is bringing this drama to Venice because he is a Moor, an Infidel, a Blackman, etc...That theme exists in other plays like ""Titus Andronicus"" or ""The Merchant of Venice"", with an anti-Semite dimension in these latter cases. The common theme is the hatred from a mediocre person who is trying to get even with better people than him by destroying them through some kind of plotting. But this plotting leads to the ultimate ruin of the plotter. We have to look over this dimension, common in Shakespeare's time, and see the more universal dimension. The man who is successful will inspire jealousy, envy and even greedy hostility. In this case, the object of that envy is Othello's wife and the game is to make the successful warrior kill his love, which he does out of some jealous lust, some possessive desire. The subsequent drama and the repentance of Othello shows how things are changing in these renaissance years, how women are little by little capturing some individual existence of their own, on the way to freedom, even if it ends up in death altogether. In fact Shakespeare in his English society is more advanced than Verdi in his 19th century Italy. Shakespeare doubles the point by making Desdemona's maid the final and lethal accuser of Iago and his lying and conspiring. We have to think of Romeo and Juliet but this latter case is pure love, no conspiration, jealousy or whatever, though the end is the same apart from the poison. A double death in the name of love. Zeffirelli does a pretty good job by creating a rich environment, at times maybe too rich. A slightly leaner production would have probably emphasized the beauty of the music and the singing. Othello as well as Desdemona reach the depth and density the tragedy requires. The cluttered setting de-concentrates our attention, even maybe our interest. The singing and the music require a stylized setting for our eyes not to get lost in the jungle of the visuals, short-circuiting our ears in their enjoyment of their listening.

330555,4,6301161580,"Okay, i come to this review with a prejudice.  I like opera and I LOVE Placido Domingo (what a warm, yummy voice he has!) so I gave this version 4 stars.  Zeffirelli did a great job in directing yet another of his opera-to-film and the sets and staging is ingenious.  I REALLY liked ""the temptation scene"" set in a learned man's library with maps, atronomy devices (astroglobe?), and the trappings of empiricism surrounding Othello and Iago as Iago attempts to drop specious comments about Desdemona.  Very smart! The  Christianity stuff was a little heavy-handed and Iago was portrayed not as calculating but as some oddly placed agent of the devil. Weird! But I think that was Verdi's fault, though, and Zeffirelli went with it 100%. Lots of fun!  Great singing! If Placido was the ""black ram tupping your white ewe,"" wouldn't you?  ;)",1211068800,,837,4.811188811188811
330556,5,6301161580,"Besides being considered the best transcription and translation of Shakespeare into another media by Arrigo Boito, Franco Zeffirelli has created the definitive film of Verdi's Otello. Placido Domingo's singing is brilliant and it is a shame that he was not nominated for an Academy Award for his dramatic acting in this opera. This film is truly a treasure and a masterpiece.",1201132800,,375,5.163934426229508
330570,5,6301161580,I could watch Placido Domingo sing Othello a thousand times and not get tired of it.  This production is no exception.  I have three of his performances on DVD and on each he finds a new aspect of this character to portray.  He is a great artist.,1167436800,,246,4.191489361702128
330571,2,6301161580,"This film is not for Opera funs especially for connoisseurs of Verdi's Otello. Franco Zeffirelli simply presents his own version of the Opera and NOT VERDI'S. The film starts brilliantly with Otello's ship in the high seas in a most spectacular storm. Problems begin as soon as Otello lands in Cyprus. (Cyprus by the way and not Venice! as mentioned at the back of the DVD by some inexcusably ignorant person). Music from a ballet score that Verdi had written for Paris emerges instead of the expected chorus. The rest of the act is fine except for the fact that Otello points to the stars (the Pleiades) at Desdemona inside his bedroom (where she can see no stars) and two minutes later he takes Desdemona on the harbour for a walk (where she could see the stars) but it is later on the score, so the point is missed. The problems really start from act 2. After Iago's credo, which by the way is very well done, Zeffirelli cuts the famous duet between Otello and Iago (I like that not!) and then alters the sequence of the music in a most indescribable way.  From there on we are watching a version of the Opera by Zeffirelli and not Verdi. I bought the Opera for Verdi, thank you very much. No wonder that the great conductor Carlos Kleiber who led the same principals at La Scala, Covent Garden and the Metropolitan Opera, refused to be associated with this film.

Domingo was at the time, at the height of his vocal powers and the Otello of the late 20th century.  He may not match vocally people like Del Monaco, Martinelli, Zanatello or Tamagnio, but these were singers of the past. Only Del Monaco has a visual record of his performance of Otello in an old black & white 50's film of the opera, with poor visual quality, but with a splendid voice. Diaz is good as Iago, but not excellent and Ricciarelli, adequate but not memorable. As for Lorin Maazel, he is an extremely poor substitute for Carlos Kleiber.

A great pity, for this had the potential to be a great film of Verdi's finest Opera. The performance with Domingo from the Metropolitan Opera is far preferable. His most recent from La Scala, wonderfully conducted by Muti, has a rather aged Domingo and very bad sets. If you can endure the bad quality off the Del Monaco film version, conducted by  Toulio Serafin, get it before it disappears from the catalogue.",1142985600,4,2329,4.548926014319809
330572,4,6301161580,"This is, hands down, the best performance of Otello. Domingo is a pretty good actor on his own, but Zefferelli really unleashes Domingo's true potential as a pure acting force. It is said that Lawrence Oliver saw Domingo plsy Otello and said ""He plays him as well as i do, AND he has that voice!"" That being said, some of the cuts are understandable, most are annoying. But i believe most of the cuts are only annoying to those people who know the score well enough to hear the change of a phrase. I would reccomend this as a firs Otello, because it is at the heart of what Verdi was getting at, a drama through music. Cuts such as ""Questa un ragna"" and the giant choral piece at the end of Desdemona's ""A terra...si..."" are beautiful, but hardly dramatically viable. But cuts, such as in the final seen in the ""Che le...otello"" really ruin the drama in that section i feel. Part of the genius of that section is the way that the music intensifies as the drama intensifies, and Zefferelli doesn't allow that to happen. However, this is nitpicking on my part. Zefferelli's Otello is a beautiful piece, the performances are more convincing than any other production i've other seen, so he cut a little. He had a reason. I don't know it. You don't know it. Enjoy it for what it is.",1055980800,5,1278,4.4425531914893615
330573,2,6301161580,"Well, to start, I am huge fan of Otello, Domingo and Zeffirelli. But somehow I was disappointed (sometimes a lot!) with this movie.
Before I bought the DVD I had read some reviews, and most reviewers were chocked by the cuts in the score and I always thought: big deal. But when I watched it I understood: THERE IS ABOUT 25 min OF CUTS!!! Most of Otellos (Levine's, Karajan's, Toscanini's) are about 2h15. This one is 1h55 with over 10 min of music and ballet that Verdi never wrote (You do the math, and remember that Maazel's tempi are much slower than Toscanini's). Also, not only are these cuts of arias or ensembles, but even worse: Phrases are just cut off here and there throughout the Opera. The 1000 words allowed for the review won't be enough to enumerate them. Why??? A reviewer argued that it's to enhance the drama!! Come on, are you going to convince me that the finale of Act II (Si, pel Ciel) needs enhancement. Even this part is cut, and worse it's ""Cut IN HALF AND I MEAN IN HALF"" as another reviewer pointed.
So what does go right?
Well the scenary is amazing and I mean amazing. But what about the performance (this is Opera after all). Well again much can be said. Domingo once said that his performance was very much influenced by Zeffirelli. He wanted him to go into some deep barytonal voice ( la Ramon Vinay of you will), and the performance suffers.
Maazel conducting is far from being ideal. Should he be blamed? Well yes, like most of the singers who agreed to represent Zeffirelli's Otello and not Verdi's.
Finally, one of the reviewer said that Zeffirelli tried to ""adapt"" the opera and those who dislike is are not open-minded. Oh Please! When you buy Verdi's Otello, you are expecting to hear some of the most beautiful music ever written adapted to one of the most successfull libretto and won't expect the director to cut off about 25 min of the score.
It is normal to be disappointed. With a cast like this one and a director like Zeffirelli (his Traviata, Cav. Rusticana, and Traviata are awesome) we could have had the most successful opera movie Ever....
Finally, I need to point out that one who doesn't know Otello ""as is"" could be thrilled with this version. It is after all a real beautiful movie.",1049760000,43,2240,4.533333333333333
330574,1,6301161580,"As soon as I started playing the DVD I knew that something was terribly wrong.  A quick comparison with my CD set of the soundtrack, and other recordings of 'Otello', confirmed my fear: the film has been transferred at a slower frame rate than was originally intended, and thus everything sounds lower than the correct pitch.
MGM DVD gets zero stars for an unforgivable error.",1046995200,15,376,4.7846153846153845
330575,5,6301161580,"Yes, this is not a true stage production (is there ever a ""true"" production?  Operas are edited/transposed/cut for the stage all the time).  This is a movie.  It is intended for a broader audience, and makes the most of different strengths and weaknesses of a different medium.  I'm always amused by those who are outraged by the ""changes"" made to the story.  Please!  Some of the best parts of Shakespeare's ""Othello"" (including its entire first act)were left out of Verdi's libretto.  And Shakespeare's Iago never delivers a speech anything like the famous ""Credo.""  So for me, cries of ""tampering"" fall pretty flat.  Verdi knew (as does Zeffirelli) that you have to *adapt* the story to the new medium.  The important question is: is this adaptation a good movie?  Yes.  The acting, the visuals, the pacing makes the story and the characters come alive. And like his work in ""Romeo and Juliet,"" Zeffirelli makes the Renaissance almost painfully beautiful to see. I imagine there are many who will respond more favorably to this treatment than a traditional staging.  This really is a work of art, and movie buffs shouldn't hesitate.  There are several taped stage productions, and if that's more to your taste, check out the Domingo/Solti DVD.",1042416000,38,1246,4.956521739130435
330576,5,6301161580,"As one who directs opera for a living, I am dismayed by some of the comments by other reviews here.  They sound like they were written by college students trying to impress themselves with their new-found intelligence.  They could never dream of making a film on this scale.  I was greatly moved when I first saw this film.  Yes, the willow song is missing.  Why?  Because it doesn't (as beautiful as it is) further the dramatic story.  Would I cut it from the staged version?  No.  But, what people many involved in the field often forget is that opera was always intended as a synthesis of the dramatic and musical arts.  It is NOT just about the music.  A good director tells a story.  In addition, telling a story in film is not the same as telling a story on the stage.  When people see this film (and I have shown it to many) they love it!  They even weep at the end.  Of course these are people who have no preconceived notions or generally have not seen the staged version.  It does its job.  It is absolutely beautiful, powerful, breathtaking and dramatic.  Iago getting harpooned was a stroke of genius.  We all wanted it. Composers write the music and do not pretend to write the staging.  So what--if it wasn't written in the score as a dramatic notation.  The film did not draw attention to the director but had the opposite effect--it drew us into a different world and made me personally forget that I was watching a film.  That is the mark of a good director.  Were their flaws?  Sure.  But all artists are flawed.  Get over it.  This is a monumental work.  From a dramtic standpoint, I prefer it to most staged productions.  If you want something from a musical standpoint, get the CD.  Those who hate the fact that opera is a synthesis, should stay out of the opera house.  The art form has been ruined by these kinds of people  (especially at the Met) where fat singers dying of consumption ""park and bark"" their way through a piece intended to be dramatic--where two singers will stand on opposite sides of the stage and sing undying love to one another without any connection at all.  Bravo to directors who are not afraid to take risks and actully tell a believable story.",1031529600,33,2194,4.473417721518987
330577,5,6301161580,"I disagree that this is a poor version - it's just different from the score and most staged productions.  The cut of the ""Willow Song"" was bad judgment, perhaps, but I found the flashbacks regarding his childhood and the ballet interesting and well done.  Zeffirelli always has the courage to be innovative and tries to bring some new vision to his productions.  I have all the filmed versions that are available and have this one on VHS and LD, therefore, have shared it with many friends and those new to opera.  Everyone just loved it without having a staged production to compare it to.  The staged production from Covent Garden, Solti and Te Kanawa is wonderful and highly recommended (5+ stars).  However, I liked the excellent performances in this movie, the settings and photograpy if not Domingo's makeup and teeth, which I can live with.  Katia, Placido and Justino were a great cast and did a very good job of acting and singing.  I feel it is a credible MOVIE version of this, which required dubbing.  It is one of my all time FAVORITE operas, (I've seen Placido perform live 25 times between LA and NY with various other cast members).  The best version is one from The Met with Placido, Fleming and Morris but not available commercially.  Write to The Met and request they release it for production on DVD - then the best would be available.  Placido wasn't totally pleased with this film either and it was shot at a sad time in his life as well, having just lost his beloved father.  I recommend this as a really good buy if you like opera movie videos.  It sure beats anything Hollywood has churned out in the last 10 years!  Thanks to Amazon for making all these opera videos available!  We Opera Buffs can never get enough of the sport and need videos to keep us going in between live performances! They are a great way to initiate others into a wonderful world for which they get little or no exposure in today's public ""educational"" system and crass mass media/ entertainment void.",997401600,14,2001,4.610169491525424

7811772,5,6301161580,"A soaring, sophisticated spectacle directed by the brilliant Italian filmmaker Franco Zeffirelli (renowned for his classic film, ""Jesus of Nazareth""), Otello is the cinematic adaptation of Opera composer Verdi's musical adaptation of the play, ""Othello, The Moor of Venice"" by William Shakespeare.

With its cavalcade of lush scenery, bright and verdant musical compositions and gripping work by Opera Star Placido Domingo in the title role of a Black Military Genius in love with a White Spanish Noble woman named Desdemona, Otello reshapes and ignites the imaginations of both the well-initiated, most well-versed Shakespeare enthusiast along with the literary novice in ways far exceeding and outside of the conventional purview of the schlocky films usually produced and funded by the distributor of this film, Cannon Films (the producers of such utterly banal fare as Charles Bronson's ""Death Wish"" series or Chuck Norris' ""Missing In Action"" films).",1446336000,,955,5.586206896551724
