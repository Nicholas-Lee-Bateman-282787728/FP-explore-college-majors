3150956,5,B00164FLSK,"I read the book 'Shaman, Healer, Sage' a few years ago and it changed the way I think about healing and medicine. Alberto Villoldo has to be the most open, disarming and funniest shamans alive. In this film version of his book, he doesn't try to be cryptic, doesn't try to hide his knowledge, although he does warn you that the shamanic path to healing is long and difficult. This film really shows him as a person, how he developed from a western medical scientist into someone with a deep, practical understanding of the Amazonian and Incan shamanic medicine. You won't be a shaman after watching this film, but you will understand what it takes to become one. Highly Recommended.",1360195200,6,682,4.691666666666666

3151005,5,B00164FLSK,This is a very enlightening movie about an amazing man. No matter what path you choose this is inspiring and shows what is possible.,1403740800,,132,4.541666666666667
3151006,5,B00164FLSK,great man great movie. was able to take one of his classes years ago. makes me want to take the trek again. so much wisdom he shares and a fascinating story.,1400803200,2,157,4.096774193548387
3151007,3,B00164FLSK,"He seems clear about his history and actions but the viewer may not be. Is he doing ayahuasca ceremony during his visions? It is certainly the tradition in those regions to use the medicine, and that would be very important to know about his journey.",1400457600,,250,4.5777777777777775
3151018,5,B00164FLSK,"I do not understand the negative reviews.  The movie gave insights into the world of shamanism.  But it cannot be viewed from the mind, It needs to be viewed from the heart as a meditation.  This is (for me) the best way to access what the producers were trying to transmit through the movie,  My mind could not make sense of it, but something within my being did.  I feel nourished and re-ernergized after watching the movie but would not be able to tell why.  This is precisely what happens with shamanism.  It is not about the seen.  It is about the invisible worlds. The true world.  I could sense a change in me because I could sense the sincerity of the seeker, the pain in the seeker and how he overcame it but this is something that requires humility and quietude to be able to see.  I watched this movie in total presence.  This is why I say, it deserves 5  stars.  Enjoy!!!",1398988800,9,883,4.310975609756097
3151019,2,B00164FLSK,This was not a very informative doc. It felt a little bit like a self-agrandising autobiograpy. I would not recomend this to anyone who actually wants to learnin something.,1397520000,6,172,4.9655172413793105
3151020,5,B00164FLSK,"I've heard/seen Dr. Villoldo's name for many years, but had not really become intimate with his work.  The documentary, ""Shaman, Healer, Sage,"" is, in my opinion, an excellent, useful look into the what and the why of Alberto Villoldo's work, and also an insightful overview of this history, meaning and intent of Shamanism, both ancient and modern!  I enjoyed it very much and will watch it again, probably multiple times!",1397347200,3,423,5.0285714285714285
3151021,3,B00164FLSK,"This film is really boring (I rarely say that about anything)!  Part biographical, part informational (the chakra system, connecting with nature, etc.), this documentary had so much potential!  I can't articulate why this work didn't grab me.  I am practically obsessed with this type of (holistic) healing.  I enjoyed a couple of the author's books prior to watching, so I was very enthusiastic to see this film. However, the commentator, and the author himself, are bland.  Is it because they are soft spoken?  Perhaps.  Regardless, my interest fell flat.  Even the nature scenes seemed bland.  Even though it was produced last year, it has an 80s vibe to it.

Is it that I'm not connecting with the film, or is the film not connecting with me?  I give up trying to pinpoint it.  I still believe in Dr. Vs work.  I hope others enjoy the film.",1396828800,9,844,4.698630136986301
