5967768,4,B00F5GIQFK,Six year old thought it was funny. Penguin was very entertaining & a little weird. As an adult I lost interest.,1387929600,,111,4.333333333333333
5967769,2,B00F5GIQFK,The animation is very primitive and the dialogue is lackluster. Most attempts at humor fail. And would film makers please stop pairing penguins and polar bears (two species that live on opposite sides of the planet).,1387065600,,216,5.027777777777778

5967788,5,B00F5GIQFK,"My 2 year old son loves this.  We watch it every other day and it's one of those children's movies you won't find annoying to have on in the background.  The plot is complex and the story is long for a 2 year old, some might say, but it consistently keeps my son entertained while he is playing on the floor.  He asks for it whenever we go to browse things to watch together.  He loves the workshop scene, the penguin bank scene and the huge robot scene, and laughs and acts out those scenes.  Cute characters, beautiful and complex animation, rich story and plot - I am currently looking for more films like this on Amazon and hope the creators have similarly good content available to stream on Prime.",1456185600,,703,4.376923076923077

5967898,2,B00F5GIQFK,"Cute animation with a potentially interesting plot ruined by terrible writing and one dimensional characters. Minimal bad dialogue performed by subpar voice actors. Overall, tedious to watch  - I don't recommend it.",1418601600,2,215,5.71875

5967926,4,B00F5GIQFK,I thought this was a rather entertaining movie.  The penguin was funny and could leave younger viewers with a moral of never give up as he kept trying over and over to accomplish a certain action.  I did read about lack of morals and I semi agree with that at one point when they lied about a particular incident at first but then owned up and were honest about what happened.,1399161600,,376,4.28169014084507
