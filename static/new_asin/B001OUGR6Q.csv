8331600,1,B001OUGR6Q,"$182 + Postage bought a product that was not anything like what was advertised, a three + month wait and surly emails from the supposed 'seller.'

We received:
- A TV series, not movies
- #1 episodes, not the 39 episodes advertised
- It states 'J Carol Nash' on the cover and did not feature the actors SIDNEY TOLER, WARNER OLAND

We returned the item at a cost to ourselves and the seller sent another package out, which was STILL missing three dvd's.  While the seller was initially helpful, this changed and she sent me emails through this site calling me a liar.

I am not at all surprpised by the spate of terrible feedback received, I hope all potential buyers take heed.  I don't think I have ever received a worse service in my life, the neurotic emails served for a laugh though.",1320537600,28,788,4.444444444444445
