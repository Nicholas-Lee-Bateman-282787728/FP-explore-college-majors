8564630,1,B00B9GD0OC,I watched this before including it in a media library that I manage for our Bible study class. The opening scene shows a young woman laying on a bathroom floor dead from a drug overdose. The paramedics cut open her blouse and expose  her chest and bra while they work on her. That alone made me question whether I wanted to circulate this to our class. But even aside from that scene there were other issues. The plot was choppy and hard to follow. The acting was so-so. Not really anything spiritual until it gets tied together at the end. Didn't care for it at all.,1472342400,2,567,4.349056603773585
8564631,5,B00B9GD0OC,"This film is one of those rare pieces of art that keeps ones attention throughout.  I watched the film over 3 days---NOT because I wanted to but because of my schedule.  Each time I started the film where I had left off, I was again instantly intrigued with the plot.  I would recommend this film to anyone--little kids may be frightened and there are some thematic elements.  Over all a great film. I found myself standing and applauding at one scene in the film.  Worth watching.",1442707200,,481,4.546511627906977

8564633,2,B00B9GD0OC,"I was bored, seriously bored. This movie produced by Citipointe Church Group and at the start says this is approved by some ""family"" outfit, lead me to the conclusion that I would be watching a religious themed movie, I'm not anti-religion but I didn't realize at the time that is what I was watching when I bought the DVD. Dull acting, dull story, very predictable too. 81 minutes of monotonous torture.",1427846400,,404,4.704225352112676
8564634,4,B00B9GD0OC,"This is put out my Bridgestone Media, a faith-based organization that creates Films for churches, schools, home entertainment with a message. This one is awarded the Dove Approved for it being family oriented.

You start out with a 911 phone call. A young girl is laying on the bathroom floor, drug overdose. The paramedics come and try to revive her at the college dorm. A party in progress. They cannot revive her and she passes away in front of a stunned group of college kids. This moment was actually stunning and emotionally dramatic. The whole set up, lasted a good 2 minutes by itself giving it a very real reality for the viewer.

You then flash to a college classroom where the teacher hands out an assignment which is to analyze one creation myth or theory. The students have to choose to create an essay on the idea of intelligent design or evolution or any other creation myth.

You are introduced to Sarah Goodall and her friend Sam and a new transfer student Mike. These will be your main characters throughout the film.

Sarah is confronted by the teacher. Her grades are slipping. She has had a bad year. Her mother has passed. Sarah is very smart and intelligent but she can't stay focused. Her mind drifts, she wonders, she's lost in the past.

Sarah ends up giving into some dorm girls pleas to mess around with a Quiji board. Soon she meets Dane a mysterious young man that seems to pop up out of no where every time Sarah try's to study.

The lady who died at the first of the drug overdose was Sarah's best friend, she not only lost her mother but also her friend in one years time. These moments have created a rift in emotions in Sarah and it's slowly destroying her.

Like all faith-based films there is always a message that it try's to spread. Sarah is slowly falling away from her achievements and grade's. Sarah is threatened in losing her scholarship. The message basically in this film is when you are vulnerable, that's when the devil plays his tricks. Sarah can't study, she can't focus because they're seems to be one distraction after another stopping her from achieving her goals and lifting her grades.

This is actually a really good independent Australian drama mixed with a lot of supernatural means. It's a faith-based film about the aspects of good and evil God and the devil.

8564635,5,B00B9GD0OC,The DVD arrived instantly. The promptness exceeded my expectations.,1408406400,,67,6.555555555555555
8564636,1,B00B9GD0OC,"I expected this movie to be a really good movie, and was completely disappointed in it.  It made me feel bad watching it and just kept thinking maybe it's going to get better.  I had a young couple watching it with me & they felt the same as I did.  I would not feel good passing it on to someone else, and am going to trash the movie.  The concept of spiritual warfare is good, but it gave me an eerie feeling.  We came away disturbed.  It made a bigger negative impact rather than positive.",1366675200,5,492,4.126315789473685
