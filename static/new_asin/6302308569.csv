7823947,5,6302308569,this movie is somewhat fun. we don't get to see the Sundance Kid or Butch Cassidy but this one shows Elizabeth a strong individual and an affectionate one. there are some jealousies and disapproving townsfolk but Mrs. Sundance doesn't take their crap. has a great ending too.,1396310400,5,275,4.872340425531915
