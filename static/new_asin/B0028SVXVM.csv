3874410,5,B0028SVXVM,"As a Grobanite, I must admit that I mainly bought this DVD because of Josh Groban's involvement in it, but that is not to say that the other performers don't deserve credit for a fantastic, very well done show! Chess In Concert is nothing short of an amazing production! Everything from the costumes to the props to the amazing cast pulls you into the story and keeps you there until the very last curtain call. As Anatoly Sergievsky, Josh Groban's performance is nothing short of amazing. He owned the role throughout the show, and he made it all his own. Idina Menzel and Kerry Ellis are given a glorious moment to shine during a duet of ""I Know Him So Well"". Josh Groban's heart-wrenching version of ""Anthem"" literally brings me to tears. There are simply too many shining moments in this production to list them all here, but this is one DVD that no Grobanite or theatre lover should be without. I wasn't there to see this one personally, but the immense special effects and the sheer power of the performers' voices made me feel like I actually was.

Chess is one of those shows that grabs you from the first moment of Act One, and doesn't let you go until the curtain has fallen at the very end!
I am so glad I bought this DVD, and I know you will be too!",1244764800,19,1261,4.388888888888889
3874411,4,B0028SVXVM,"Four items make this a must-have.  The first is Josh Groban singing the classic ""Anthem"", where, as the Russian chess champion, Anatoly, he avows his love for his homeland.  As Anatoly's discarded wife, Svetlana, the amazing Kerry Ellis totally nails ""Someone Else's Story.""  There's ""The Story of Chess"", where the Chorus perform Tim Rice's witty take on the evolution of the game.  Finally, the Quartet, where Florence (Idina Menzel), Anatoly, his minder Molokov and the Arbiter deplore how chess has sunk from ""a model of decorum and tranquillity"" to ""a battleground for rival ideologies to slug it out with glee.""

Having seen the original London West End production in 1986 with Elaine Paige, I was lucky enough to witness this superb 21st Anniversary production in the Royal Albert Hall, London, last year. Tim Rice has tightened up the plot of love and betrayal played out in the setting of chess championships in the Cold War.  Florence, who manages the American champion, falls for the Russian; complications - political, ethical, personal - ensue.  From the moment the outstanding Chorus bursts into ""Merano"" - blending chess with commercialism as a tiny Central European town prepares to welcome the world - right to the devastating ""Endgame"" and final twist, the dramatic pace never lets up.

In this DVD, hopefully the sound difficulties of this production will have been ironed out.  As to the cast - they were fantastic!!  Groban is a revelation: a brilliant actor as well as singer.  Kerry Ellis was a showstopper.  As Florence, Idina Menzel, (so good in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wicked-2003-Original-Broadway-Cast/dp/B0000TB01Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wicked (2003 Original Broadway Cast)</a>, was too strident for my taste, lacking subtlety and roundness in acting.  (""Heaven Help My Heart"" doesn't register, and ""Nobody's Side"" pales away.)  However, her ""You and I"" with Groban still tugs the heartstrings:  ""we go on pretending / Stories like ours  Have happy endings.""

The wonderful David Bedella  (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jerry-Springer-the-Opera/dp/B0000TSRII/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jerry Springer: the Opera</a>), makes a great, sinister Molokov.  And Adam Pascal gives his charismatic ALL as Freddy, the tormented American bearing luggage from the past:  ""Pity the Child.""  Marti Pellow (of pop group Wet Wet Wet) was a disappointment as the Arbiter, a little under-performed I felt.

Rice's lyrics are trenchant, tender, intelligent, witty.  The music, by Benny and Bjorn of ABBA, is a perfect rock score, conveying all the emotions and tensions necessary and fully matching the lyrics.

In the main, this is a superb production of a classic and underestimated musical.",1244678400,103,2800,5.75669099756691

Hunting all over for a replacement, I found a new one on Amazon.  Unable to believe my luck, I ordered it and was both delighted with the delivery (to New Zealand) being as stated by Amazon but the DVD has been wonderful.  It keeps the actual show alive for me, even though it has ""stuff"" in it that was not in the original seen live.  But it ties in beautifully.

Beside the wonderful Josh Groban, there are also four further awesome singer/performers.  But get it and see what I mean!",1473465600,,591,4.288288288288288

3874446,5,B0028SVXVM,"This is a very nicely recorded video -- very excellent sound, and semi-staged. The soloists all do a fine job of singing and the limited acting of a semi-staged production.

I'm a fan of Chess from when it was first recorded on CD. This production is equally good in every respect, was enjoyable to watch, and I know I'll watch it at least several more times.

If you're interested to learn more about the production, look up references to the various versions of the show. This was all new to me, and I enjoyed learning about it.",1469404800,,530,4.453608247422681
3874447,5,B0028SVXVM,"Absolutely awesome.  I really need say no more, but I will...
The original Chess recording from 1984 has been and continues to be one of my favorite recordings ever.  I have listened to it thousands of times.  I read some of the reviews here of the Chess DVD before purchasing it but I was going to buy it no matter what other reviewers said.  I am of the opinion the Picture Quality is as good as it gets for a DVD, my Oppo 103 upscales it very nicely for my LG 55"" LCD TV.  The Audio Sounds great.  The chorus, orchestra, individual performers, all sound clear.  This is a live recording, not a studio so if you go in with that in mind you won't be disappointed.  It differs in some small ways from the original 1984 recording, Tim Rice details that in the liner notes.
I just received it today and have only watched the first act but I am completely enthralled.  A few reviews were complaining about Josh Groban and Idina Menzel.  I don't what they were expecting but I was blown away, especially on the song Anthem sung by JG.  Incredible.
In short, if you're a fan of Chess or musicals or just well done productions, you need this DVD for your collection/library.  If it ever gets a Bluray release I will upgrade without question.  I'm planning to buy a few copies for friends of mine who appreciate this musical.",1465689600,6,1318,4.374485596707819

3874450,5,B0028SVXVM,"I've watched this more times than any other movie.
It is fresh and interesting.
Upbeat and sad.
A realistic story (in silly trappings) with interesting characters.

If you ask someone ""who is the main character?"" You'll get a wide variety of answers.
My vote is it is Florence, since she opens and closes the musical, but also because the other answers are less satisfying.
But the fact that you can watch this 20+ times and then only be sorta sure about this is very fun!

However, it it is very strange.  I always try to keep people's minds open to a wild adventure when I pitch it, and make sure they leave expectations at the door. (I don't ask them to have low expectations, I expect them to have NO expectations).

You don't have to know chess to understand and appreciate it.

Edit:
This is a video taken of a live performance on a minimalist stage.  You can see everything someone in the audience would see, including the shenanigans of the live chorus, the orchestra, and the splash screens projected to frame the various scenes.  You even see the writer and director introducing the play to the audience.",1455235200,,1114,4.595959595959596

I have loved the music of Chess for many years, but because the show is not performed anywhere that I can find, I have never actually seen the full stage production.  This, however, was a great substitute. I still hope one day to find the complete show.",1451433600,,336,4.403225806451613

3874473,5,B0028SVXVM,"Were this rock opera of to have ended tragically it would have stood well, both in the beauty and power of the music and the all too human story, to Verdis or Puccinis operatic best.  But Chess ends with honor and hope, with both Anatoly and Florence finding their own separate winning lines through the maze of political, organizational, commercial, and personal life obstructions.
  Chess has it all: beautiful duets, trios, quartets, and sextets of conflicting forces, a choral ensemble to amplify the power of the moment, and songs whose every word carry the story to its moral end.  Bravo to all those who were not satisfied with Chesss original form but who, 25 years later, produced this wonderful incarnation.  Whence the 4k, 3D, Blu-ray version?",1435708800,,754,4.9523809523809526
3874474,5,B0028SVXVM,"My love this this musical goes back at least 10 years with the original recording which was just the music and the CD liner notes filling in the story gaps. As a teen, I listened to it over and over, making up the rest of the performance in my head in between belting out the songs in the privacy of my room or car. I think it was not wanting to mess with that version that kept me from this one for so long - I came across it once on spotify but the songs were weird- they were out of order, some of them had lyrics changed and my god - the American and the Russian have names now?! Finally, only after recognizing another name on the cast list (sorry Josh, I was holding out for Elsa :P ) I steeled myself for the worst and bought this version to sit down and watch - and I'm so happy I did. The changes make sense in context of the performance. Starting out with the end song is not going to be the end of my childhood. The performance is absolutely stunning and it was amazing to watch something that I've held in my head for so long.

I have a small gripe and a small praise. The gripe- I think the love between the Russian (old habits) and Florence should have been more expressive. What he does to be with her are dramatic and he sings about being in love but I don't really see that expressed - and ok, this is a concert, they're not supposed to be doing great acting here, but just script in some more romance or maybe stand slightly closer to each other? The praise is that her dress at the second act looks great AND has pockets, which is a minor miracle in women's fashion. I'm willing to trade my love of that dress to the lack of chemistry of the two main characters of the play though, so I'm still saying this is 5 stars.",1434844800,,1737,4.0641399416909625
3874475,5,B0028SVXVM,"Chess is my favorite musical. Chess in Concert is a refined version and I believe it can be classified as a masterpiece.  Indeed the plot is complex or in the words of Tim Rice ""...intelligent or sophisticated.""  The lines and lyrics need careful listening.  In the two and a half hour concert version there is no wasted material.

By the time the show made it to Broadway in the 80's it could be said that it has become dated relying on a plot involving the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union at the time of the collapse of the Soviet empire, in real time.  But now, it can be seen as relevant in a historical perspective.

The cast of Chess in Concert is exceptional.  Josh Groban turns in a performance that is superb vocally with impressive acting.  Idina Menzel, Adam Pascal, Kerry Ellis, and Marti Pellow are equal in their exceptional talent.

I enthusiastically recommend this version to anyone who is a serious musical fan.",1433116800,,957,4.648809523809524

The music was written by Benny Andersson and Bj&ouml;rn Ulvaeus of ABBA & the lyrics by Tim Rice all of them extremely talented. So you can see the talent in the making of the music.

I am not sure exactly how someone unfamiliar with chess would react to it but the music is great as are the performances so anyone should be able to enjoy it. My wife does does play chess often but she also really enjoyed it. In general, I do not enjoy musicals (although I am a musician) but I can't stop watching this one.

I'm into music, used to sing myself, and have listened to many wonderful voices, but Josh's voice reaches higher heights and  has a uniqueness that transcends many voices.  I wasn't familiar with ""Chess,"" a musical with few spoken words, until I saw this DVD listed among Josh's other works.  The performance takes place in London at the Royal Albert Hall, and Josh is one of the lead characters.  What a pleasure to hear him sing, and see him act, through a musical.

Rice said he wants this version to be the official one. It seems this show can be put together in an endless number of ways, like the game of chess itself. There is a gap between the plot and the ABBAesque songs of Benny Andersson and Bjorn Ulvaeus. Adam Pascal plays the American. Josh Groban plays the Russian. Rice spent a good bit of his life wrestling with this show. My own paper brings traffic to my website. CHESS is the most spiteful, cynical, pessimistic piece ever staged.

This unique collaboration from Bjrn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson and Tim Rice is terrific and the performances of Josh Groban, Idina Menzel and Adam Pascal accompanied by the City of London Philharmonic and West End Chorus are fabulous!",1370390400,,515,4.840909090909091
3874515,3,B0028SVXVM,"By the early 1980s Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice had come to a parting of ways and Rice--always interested in the mixture of media and politics--turned his attention to a musical that reflected the Cold War rivalry between the USA and the USSR via international chess, the central characters and their battles very loosely inspired by grandmasters Bobby Fischer, Viktor Korchnoi, and Anatoly Karpov.  Rice worked with Benny Andersson and Bjorn Ulvaeus, formerly of the world-famous band ABBA, and the result was the critically acclaimed 1984 concept album CHESS.  A London stage version starring Elaine Page and Murray Head opened in 1986 to generally positive reviews; it ran about three years.  A New York stage version starring Judy Kuhn and David Carroll opened in 1988 to generally negative reviews; it ran about three months.

There was a significant difference between the London and New York versions.  In London, the play was essentially a modern opera similar to EVITA, sung throughout with very little in the way of spoken dialogue.  In New York, the play was re-tooled as a book musical, with a detailed script used to support a truncated score.  In both instances critics and public admired the performers and the music, but in both instances the productions were simply to elephantine for success, with the play dwarfed by overpowering fits of tempermental multi-media that sometimes worked and sometimes did not.  There was a generally feeling that a simpler production would be more appropriate, and over the years there have been numerous ""concert"" revivals of the play, usually following the original London style but with the cast playing directly in front of an orchestra placed on the stage.  The results have sometimes been very fine.  Unfortunately, the 2008 Albert Hall concert production isn't one of them.

Once again, producers have been unable to resist the temptation to over produce the play.  There is a fifty piece orchestra, a one hundred performer chorus, and a large cast of singers and dancers.  There are endless and extremely annoying multi-media graphics.  The show is so buried under these details that it never had a chance: there are a few moments when it comes to life, but on the whole it drags itself along in a series of unhappy gasps, not the least of which are caused by a series of horrendously miscast singers.  Much has been said of Josh Grobin's performance as Anatoly, and his voice is quite fine, but he's about as Russian as Cary Grant.  Idina Menzel, who plays Florence, and Adam Pascal, who plays Freddie, both came out the musical RENT--and they sound exactly as if they are trying to impose that show's musical style on a significantly different work.  I might also add that Menzel has an extremely nasal voice and that Pascal tends to flounce.  Marti Pellow and Clarke Peters are weak, Kerry Ellis is merely okay, and the only person who actually nails the thing start to finish is David Bedella in the role of Molokov.  To ice it over, the sound is weak and the cinematography is poor and this has to be one of the most incredibly dire performances of ""One Night In Bangkok,"" the show's signature song, ever put on the professional stage.

In spite of these glaring flaws, CHESS: IN CONCERT is worth seeing for the simple reason that it probably the closest thing that exists to a full recording of the original score.  Rice has fiddled a bit with it (again) and makes the very odd choice of giving ""Someone Else's Story"" to Svetlana, but on the whole this is very close to what Rice, Andersson and Ulvaeus had in mind for the show in terms of content and sequence.  If you're a hardcore fan of the musical, as I am, you'll want to see CHESS: IN CONCERT, but you're likely to prefer the stylings of Elaine Page, Murray Head, Judy Kuhn, and David Carroll instead.

This version is closest to the original one that we saw many years ago, but it is even slightly changed from that one. This version uses mainly people that are singers not actors so the acting in minimal. That said, the singing is well done with David Bedela as Molokov the most accomplished. Idina Menzel was a little skreechy and we would have perferred a singer with a little lower voice range. Of course Josh Grogan never had a Russian accent in any of his lines or songs.

It was a wonderful play and played with great verve by everyone involved. Although the songs are somewhat dull and the only two I really like are One night in bangkok and I know him so well....the others are played out so well that I enjoyed it nonetheless. Whilst the concept of the play is truly outdated (the cold war setting), it is still fun to watch and enjoy.

My only real complaint was Josh groban. While he is a brilliant singer, he has the acting range of a tree trunk. He spent the entire play just basically staring and I found it hard to relate to him at all. Many times I was screaming ""Christ man put some effort into your acting, at least change your facial expression"". His statue-like performance was the only downside to this great effort.

Josh Groban truly captures the part perfectly, looking as if he truly is a tortured soul,
Idina Menzel has been criticized for rushing her songs, but I believe she lives up to the original intent of her part; and ironically, the twist at the end of the show reveals the story is about her.
Adam Pascal is as just as bold and brassy as John McEnroe while revealing his deeper motivations while selfish, are ultimately about Chess.

Apparently Andrew Lloyd Weber was supposed to have a role in the music development back in the early '80s, but the males from ABBA got the nod instead.  The result is music that has lasted longer and is better constructed.

And I fell in love with the songs instantly, especially ""Someone Else's Story"",  ""Nobody's Side"", ""Heaven Help My Heart"", ""I Know Him So Well"" and ""You and I"" to name a few.  Watching this DVD of ""Chess In Concert"" has brought back all those emotions and I was practically singing with the players, especially when they were singing the songs which I mentioned above. I was amazed at myself since I still practically know most of the lyrics, considering that I only saw the stage production of CHESS only once. What moved me so much and which also brought me to tears was Anatoly's ""Anthem,"" where he became very emotional with his decision whether or not to leave his beloved Russia.  I fell in love with Josh Groban who portrayed the role of Russian chess champion, Anatoly Sergievsky. I labeled this musical production a ""Love Story with a powerful twist"" considering the many attributes that this musical has - suspense, drama, tears, heartbreak,vivacious personalities and those powerful tunes, which only a musical of this calibre can generate.  Ever since I got ""Chess in Concert"", I have watched it several times already. Back in Long Beach, I bought a DVD of ""Lyrics by Tim Rice"" which also contains some songs from Chess but someone borrowed it from me and I never got it back.

Idina Menzel, who also had a guest appearance in the Glee (she played Lea Mitchell's long lost mother) was the primary singer.  I'm not a big fan of hers nor do I like her singing.

Chess is a Broadway musical that dates back to the early 80s and is the music of Bjorn and Benny.  I found this show to be quite boring and I only got through the first half hour before I decided not to watch anymore.  I don't like the music and I couldn't quite figure out what was going on.

3874569,4,B0028SVXVM,"Unlike others, I think that Josh Groban, Idina Menzel and Adam Pascal make a powerful trio.  It's easy to envision Idina as the feisty Hungarian emigre that is aware that she could easily become a pawn (pardon the pun) in global politics & greedy commercialism while trying to protect her love and relationship from those forces. She is a modern Florence.  Josh hits the high notes with a tense, exciting timbre and Adam's distinctive voice is perfect for the rakish, flawed Freddy. Their voices resonate perfectly in duets and group numbers.  Kerry is an excellent Svetlana - she plays the angry, abandoned wife beautifully and with sympathy. It's a different portrayal from the Elaine Paige, Judy Kuhn, Murray Head, etc approach.  I love those performers too, but there's something exciting about this orchestration, the voices. The other principal singers and chorus are a rich backdrop to the soloists.  Forget about the staging!  It's gratuitous, e.g.,the dancing during the chess matches. There are some irritating, prosaic moments. For example, during ""I know him so well"" the focus should be on Florence & Svetlana, but there is a spotlight on Anatoly staring at his chess board during their solo.  Ridiculous!  It's great to watch the singing and the DVD sound is good.  So with those expectations you will thoroughly enjoy this version of Chess!",1346716800,,1355,5.0675675675675675
3874570,3,B0028SVXVM,"I listened to the original cast recording of Chess for many years before I finally saw the show. I have also listened to many different versions. The worst versions were always the American versions, sadly. And in this recording of the show it pains me to say that Idina Menzel is the weakest link. Neither her voice nor her performance have the required gravitas to convey a woman in a relationship with a difficult man and having to deal with the politics of a nation who may or may not have her father in custody somewhere.

The other aspect of the show that felt like a great weakness to me was how small the staging felt. Having seen the 25th Anniversay edition of Les Miserables as well as Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall, the filming of  this production simply felt small.

Apart from the performance of miss Menzel, all the vocals were outstanding.

I love Chess and don't feel that this recording quite does the show justice. Perhaps a Blu-ray version of this recording with better sound and clearer picture will make it so much better. But this recording leaves much to be desired. It just felt small.",1344470400,,1125,4.554455445544554

3874573,3,B0028SVXVM,"I own the soundtrack of Chess featuring Murry Head, who, for me, was the definitive Judas Iscariot in Webber's Jesus Christ Superstar.  Sadly Chess was a fantastic musical that slid under the radar for most people, including myself, save for a singular popular hit, 'One Night In Bangkok'.  I have the fortune (misfortune?) of being around when 'One Night In Bangkok' climbed the pop charts and was thrilled to hear Murry Head once again rise to prominence with his power and passion. It wasn't until many years later, though, that I was exposed to the remainder of the soundtrack only to realize what a great production I had missed.  Needless to say, I was quite excited to see that there was a video production of this musical featuring such talented modern artists as Edina Menzel (Wicked/Rent), and Adam Pascal(Rent).

Sadly the video looks like it was made for an Atari 2600. Forget seeing freckles or makeup lines, you'll be lucky if you can make out the performers.  While the performances are passible, they don't measure up to the original or even my expectations of the artists. While technically good, the presentation of the production as an oratorio somehow fails to convey any sense of emotion that might have been present in the orignal stage production.

I unfortunately never had an opportunity to see the original, but the music in the video often sounds more like a vocal exercise than a theatrical production.  I can almost hear someone saying ""Hey, let's do Chess, won't it be fun? Maybe we can squeeze it into our schedules.""  I think the cold war passion and intrigue that was the foundation for this musical got lost somewhere between line 1 and line 2 of the lyrics.

If I close my eyes, it's worth the $11-$12 I paid for the virtual copy, but beyond that I'd recommend buying the original cast recording for $24. If you have money to burn after that and haven't bought video copies of the stage productions of Les Miserables, or Phantom of the Opera, then by all means give it a shot, just turn off the television.

There is one consolation and that is that if this copy made it to video, that there's some hope of me seeing Alan Cumming and Cyndi Lauper in Kurt Weil's 'The Three Penny Opera'. Regardless of what anyone thinks of a particular production, one should at least have the opportunity to judge for oneself and that's one that slipped by me.",1333497600,,2379,4.683453237410072

It was all over the radio when I was in college and I couldn't believe a song like that could have a place in a quality musical, much less one by the guys from ABBA.  When I think ABBA I think cheesy pop/disco, not beautiful and melodic theater.  I was wrong.

This DVD is the concert performance of this show at the Royal Albert Hall.  It is not a filmed version of the original stage musical or one of its MANY other incarnations in the years since its West End debut.  This staging concept alone strips away most of the theatricality and brings the singers and the songs into the forefront.  A good musical lives or dies by its material and the singers, not its production value  -- no matter what AL-W may have you otherwise convinced.

I'm not a big fan of Josh Groban but he holds his own rather well here.  But he's no actor, that's for sure.  The rest of the cast buoys the entire production and even at its thinnest moments it still coasts along very well.

Josh Groban was wonderful as Anatoly.  His singing was quite angelic.  The same could be said for the badly underused Kerry Ellis.

It would have helped if they'd made Freddy Trumper less sympathetic, and I would have liked to have the rival chess player in the second act get something to sing.

Oh well.  Idina is an excellent singer.  She's a true talent and she blew Wicked away.  But she's just not Florence.  Florence requires a certain sweetness.  Perhaps if Kerry and Idina switched roles?  Idina's natural power would work perfectly for Svetlana.

It would have been nice to do without the Embassy's lament and the Merchants' song.  Though impressive spectacle numbers, they slow the show's plot down and don't really contribute much comperatively.

And the Arbiter's rather lackluster performance is just another reason they should reassign the part to a woman to play.  A lady clad in grey, but operating with her own innate power, would balance out the male/female numbers and the Arbiter's gender is really unimportant for the part.",1320105600,,1246,4.970873786407767

Tim Rice creates a world of music that makes you forget that some of the story may not make sense.

I was enthralled and purchased LP and audio tape in an attempt to relive the magic I experienced at the theatre.  Forever hopeful a DVD might be made (such as was done with 'Phantom of the Opera' although a different cast and production to the stage presentation), I happened to stumble upon this DVD whilst looking through Amazon.

Although the reviews were a 'mixed bag', I decided to get the DVD anyway and how estatic am I that I chose to do so.  It is awesome and while I could nit-pick over the choice for the arbiter, who, in my opinion had a relatively weak voice but excellent acting ability, all else was spell-binding.

If there was a fault, then I suggest it was with the technology used for the 'sound-mixing'.

Being a female, I confess to being a little surprised at the choice of clothing styles for the leads (or the tailoring), but again, this is nit-picking and has little to do with the product.

THis 2008 DVD was brilliantly conducted and the orcestra and singing was wonderful.  The performances were first rate. After sveral years of trying to produce a play based on the story ""chess"", this was done right. Well done!!",1303344000,2,342,4.7

I like it, but it wasn't exactly what I'd hoped for. I'm not a fan of the concert style that has the principals all just standing in front of microphones singing their parts and little else. Groban does a great job; some of the other voices seemed to be not quite right to me, though. Menzel I like, but seemed a bad choice in this. Her voice was not suited to the part, for example. I'm glad to see the show is still around and apparently still popular, I just hope to see a really great production of it someday.",1303084800,,668,4.1461538461538465
3874617,5,B0028SVXVM,"I have had the soundtrack from the London production forever. My first was on vinyl,(a friend did an internship as a stage hand,just knew I would love it),quickly converted to cassette,then to cd.
Still,I have always wanted a visual reference. Always seemed to be a day late and a dollar short in aquiring the video,then saw this version. Read some of the reviews,I think I was predisposed to not be thrilled with the music,but still wanted the visual(and to be honest had a gift certificate) so took the plunge. Well,it's worth it! At first I kept hearing my old soundtrack overlaid,but was quickly captivated. It's still the same wonderful music,just has visual punch,also makes the plot clearer than just the old sound track. I realized that it's along the lines of new tricks for old dogs,LOL,new voices,a couple changed lyrics. I even have some new fans on the bandwagon,my Mom,(watched from the perspective of a PBS special)my sister,anything with Josh Groban is up her alley,(funny she snarled her nose at the original cassette blaring in my car),co-workers that wanted to know what I was humming and or singing. So if you loved the music and can accept change(dare a little) this is the DVD for you! I won't be ditching my original but this is a great addition. Now I'm off to get the audio version,which will be converted to MP3,then to flash drive,then who knows what?",1298678400,2,1378,4.818565400843882

3874619,2,B0028SVXVM,"When I was young, I would listen to the original cast recording of Chess, and I recall the amazement I had for the songs, especially ""Anthem"", ""I Know Him So Well"" and ""Someone Elses Story"".  When I saw that Chess was recorded in the new-fangled ""in Concert"" format, I was excited to say the least.

I sit here tonight watching the mess that is ""Chess in Concert"".  NONE of the actors touted in this edition are believable.  Adam Paschal oversings everything AGAIN, Marti Pellow as the Arbiter is painful to listen to, and the strange ""dance"" interludes are just weird.  Idina Menzel, my dead Idina, who I love in most everything, just doesn't play off Florence like she could.  Yes, Tim Rice has tightened up the lyrics a bit, but that wasn't hardly enough.  This musical is all over the proverbial ""chess board"".  The sound editing is perhaps the biggest crime - whoever was recording and editing this was either hard of hearing or just not there.

TO be honest, the second half is better than the first half, but just barely.  Groban and Menzel shine during their duets, and they are even believable as love interests.  I really do wish I would have loved this more - I really do.  I just sit here, staring at the credits running by, and ache that I spent money on this.",1295049600,2,1273,4.510917030567685

3874621,5,B0028SVXVM,"OK, so every performance of Salome or Madame Butterfly will never compare to the productions at Santa Fe Opera in the 1966 season....yes, they were my first live opera performances. Ah and Tosca! But, life goes on, and True Art Lives Forever and is forever reinterpreted for the next generation. Yes I was a great fan of ABBA, and had heard of 'Chess' but was not familiar with any of the songs except 'One night in Bankok'. Imagine then, last year flipping through channels, I stopped on the local PBS station to see Adam Pascal singing 'Pity the child'. Love at first sight and sound. Then Edina singing 'Nobody's on nobody's side'. Then Edina Menzel with 'Heaven Help my Heart'. Then Josh Groban and 'Anthem'. My God, I thought, where has this music been? Where have I been?  So I waited for the DVD, ordered on Amazon, got it about 5 days, and showed it to my best friend. We both sat in amazement as the show unfolded. Tears, laughter, amazement and joy are what this production gives you in 245 minutes. You will see a Josh Groban you never knew. You will hear Edina Menzel and Kerry Ellis and the chorus in emotional duels, the dancers punctuating the action; a spectacular orchestra - rock infused. And Adam Pascal steals the show and makes you love him in spite of himself. Yes I bought the CD also, for the car. I then found the 1984 concept album/CD used from an Amazon dealer. But except for Elaine page I was disappointed. So you see, all is relative. I have shown the dvd to several friends, pop, rock, classical alike found it spectacular...I usually show it without any introduction, and then after the first act (Josh's Anthem) tell them they have been listening to ABBA...by then they are hooked. I have had to explain to the 40- somethings 'the cold war', Bobby Fisher, world Chess, etc for context. I have watched and listened for more than a year - countless viewings on my bigscreen lcd/surround sound, and it remains in my car cd player. Everytime I hear/see something new. I am obsessed with the music; it is complex and classical in compostition, motifs recurring and reprise for several numbers (pity the child); crank up the volume, and you will be astounded. For the Chess old-timers: open your minds and ears. This performance was given twice in London; I can't imagine the joy, but you can see it in the audience.",1289260800,3,2343,4.605263157894737
3874622,3,B0028SVXVM,"I own all the official recordings of Chess...in sequential order...Original 1984 Concept Album, Broadway Cast, 1994 Gothenburg Concert, 2001 Danish Cast, 2002 Swedish Cast...and was hugely excited about this release. I suppose mainly for the fact that it included the rare tracks ""Commie Newspapers"", ""Press Conference"", ""One More Opponent"" etc. which were removed from the original Danish release - now deleted. (Although I have finally just found a copy of the deleted complete Danish recording).

So much of this recording should have blown the socks off all the others, but sadly where it succeeds in a few places it hugely disappoints in others. However, to review this Royal Albert Hall concert it's impossible not to compare it with the others.

The success of any recording of Chess largely depends on the three principals. Not surprisingly, the strongest trio of all is the Swedish Cast. I know the fact that the recording is in a foreign language may put people off but believe me there is no better recorded Florence than Helen Sjholm. Even in Swedish you are hit by the full extent of her emotive singing. Anders Ekborg is a stunning Freddie, coping admirably with the demands of the role whilst Tommy Korberg cements his role of Anatoly in his third recording; the years having hardly touched his voice. You simply cannot better these three and it's a huge regret that they didn't record an English version - although you can find Sjholm singing ""Someone Else's Story"" in English on YouTube.

So the good points about the RAH concert...
The recording boasts the very best start to ""Endgame: the chorus of the past masters"". Listen to this with the volume up full, it's amazing! The CD is worth it for that alone. Generally, the chorus work on ""Merano"", ""Merchandisers"" etc. is stunning and it's fantastic to hear such a large choir. David Bedella turns in the best recorded Molokov period - even outshining Denis Quilley on the concept album. Kerry Ellis gives a fantastic portrayal of Svetlana and sings ""Someone Else's Story"" very well indeed - although I do prefer Judy Kuhn's take on the Broadway Cast. So the 3 principals: Adam Pascal is definitely the best English speaking Freddie, the right level of petulance, strong control and a very touching rendition of ""Pity The Child"". Josh Groban does his best, sometimes producing beautiful tone and it's hard to decide whether he is better or worse than Stig Rossen on the Danish Cast. It's true he improves as the concert carries on but there is some emotional depth lacking but he can't match Korberg. As Florence, Idina Menzel is a huge disappointment. As others have argued more eloquently, it just doesn't work. This is nothing against Ms Menzel per se, it's just that she doesn't have a voice naturally suited to the role. She is too shrieky and yet lacks power; far better to listen to Emma Kershaw on the Danish Cast. Also Menzel and Groban don't have a great rapport, the voices don't gel well together. And strange that they reverted to the awful amateurish Broadway lyrics for ""You And I (reprise)""

So in my order of preference:
1. Swedish Cast - best trio of principals, and some interesting and moving changes to the score - watch the DVD, the stage production is brilliant.
2. Danish cast - even if you can't get the deleted version, the re-release is almost the entire London production.
3. Royal Albert Hall - mainly for completeness, David Bedella, Adam Pascal and the Chess Masters Intro
4. Original Concept Album - Paige and Korberg nailing the roles.
5. 1994 Gothenburg Cast - awful histrionics from Anders Glenmark, but Korberg is fantastic, and Karin Glenmark (Florence) sings the [] out of it. Also a great encore of ""Merano"" but terrible supporting performances.
6. Broadway Cast - only for Judy Kuhn; a terribly mangled version of a fantastic score.",1287792000,7,3840,4.875957120980092

3874624,5,B0028SVXVM,My husband introduced this to me on CD many years ago.  The version he had was from the 1986 production in England with the original cast (including Elaine Paige).  He actually got to see it live in England.  The original CD was a great way to get to know the story because some of the words get pretty complex in some of the songs.  The complexity of the music is something I really love so the trouble with hearing some of the words doesn't take anything away from how great I think this is.  It's well worth watching more than once to pick up all the details.  This version with Josh Groban & Idina Menzel was such a joy to see & hear.  Josh Groban has a beautiful strong voice and I wish he'd do more productions like this.  His abilities to portray the emotion appropriate to the story was something that really made this so engaging.  I loved watching his acting as much as hearing his singing.  Idina Menzel is always great on stage and she was the perfect choice for the role of Florence.  Adam Pascal as Freddie also did an amazing job.  The entire cast gave such incredible performances.  Top all that with London Philharmonic & the 100 member West End Chorus and the results are outstanding!  All of the music is so memorable and interesting thanks to Tim Rice from ABBA for the story & lyrics & Benny Andersson and Bj&ouml;rn Ulvaeus for the music.

3874636,4,B0028SVXVM,"I got this video, because Josh Groban is in it -- and I'm currently obsessed with him.  He gave a superlative performance, hopefully assuring that he'll have more chances to do musical theater, which is, apparently, what he really wants to do.

Curiously, there were only three really top notch solo voices in the piece: Josh Groban, David Bedella, and Clarke Peters.  The other soloists had disappointing vocal instruments.  It seems odd to me that it is apparently so hard to find people who can really sing.

The chorus and dancing were well done.

The story is not so hot.  It's overly complex and contrived.  The motivations of the main characters are puzzling.  Why does Anatoly leave his more attractive wife for this strange chess groupie, for instance?  Perhaps it's the acting.  The three I mentioned above who sing well, also manage to convey more drama in their roles.  The others seem superficial, not truly engaged in their parts.  As a result the whole thing lacks the emotional drama it should have.

I'm glad I got it, though, because I wanted to hear Josh & that I got from this.  He just sort of blew everyone else off the stage.",1274140800,2,1148,4.67
3874637,3,B0028SVXVM,"Recorded live at Royal Albert Hall, London, May 12-13, 2008
There is also a single CD Highlights version and DVD version which were released both in the United States and Europe. This concert version stars Josh Groban and was taped a full year before it's release. This is yet another reworking of the ever changing Andersson-Rice-Ulvaeus musical.

This time, Tim Rice took the lead on the redo duties. Bjorn Ulvaeus Andersson and Benny did not get directly involved with this concert ,though perhaps they had a veto, if they did not like the project as a whole. This record is an attempt to issue a fairly complete version of the musical, based generally on the original London staging. Somewhat annoyingly, Tim Rice has once again changed a few lyrics. On the plus side, you get to hear a few of the songs that were written long ago, which had not been available on any available recording of CHESS (other then a temporary release on the original version of the Danish Version of Chess) the songs are ""Commie Newspapers"","" Press conference"", ""Global TV fanfare"", ""Talking Chess"" and ""The Interview"". These are not great songs, but it's still nice to have them. Most of the songs found only on the American Broadway staging did not make it on this recording, but otherwise this is most complete recording of the Chess score available.
The album was recorded live, and as a result many of the performances sound a little shaky, but most of the performances do have enthusiasm.  Another problem for me with any re-recording or theatrical staging of Chess is losing out on getting Benny Andersson and the ABBA band play the music as it meant to be played. I would say that if you want the definitive CHESS album it would seem that it is still your best bet to go back to the original 1984 studio album.

Josh Groban, in particular is close to perfect as the Russian chess competitor - he dosen't miss a beat and his pathos is right on target.

I'm used to the old 2 disk LP so some of the performers didn't seem to fit into their characters, they seemed to lack the ""bite"" of the older performance, but that probably has more to do with my prior expectations that any flaw of theirs.

They don't emote; they don't really engage each other.  Sort of like opera, but without the sets.  I don't really see the point of putting it on DVD; there's very little to look at.

I have to find a new creed.  This concert version of Chess messed with the lyrics, added songs, moved songs and changed the plot of one of my favorite musicals of all times.  And I'm thrilled.  It was a masterful retelling of the original story.  Almost every change, every expansion, every redirection helped the story.  My one minor quibble was that they sang *Endgame* before the game was over.  But that was minor.  The filler, the backstory, even the moving *The Story of Chess* to the beginning of the show were all moves that were beneficial to the show.

Chess has always been a bit of a Broadway oddity, with it's unconventional plot and occasional oddly arhthmic song.  It is hard to understand unless you read the synopsis carefully.  It's dated too, being a product of the Cold War.  But those problems were swept away by the masterful rewrites and edits.  Yeah, I missed a favorite line or two, but the ones that replaced them were just as good, probably better than the originals.

And no doubt they brought the top talent to this piece.  Groban and Menzel nailed every note and sang with emotion and lungpower. Adding a bit more grist for the Soviet wife and inventing the role of the Broadcaster were not just filler.  They were sweetners.  I knew the musical back to front, but now, I understand it better.  If you are a fan of Chess or of Brodway at its best, I recommend this in my most enthusiastic terms.

Josh Groban plays the Russian chess master in a strong and sweet voice. The musical score plays nicely with the choreography,illuminating life and death choices with each move on the board.
One sees a variety of enigmas from which there appears to be no extraction, and these are truly heart-provoking and gripping. Music is emotion that must come out to the world from the depth of the singer's soul.

3874654,5,B0028SVXVM,"Since its debut in 1984, Chess has been relentlessly reworked in productions and recordings around the world.  In its liner notes and introduction, Tim Rice explains that ""Chess in Concert"" was produced to be the definitive version.  However it may be reworked in the future, this is the vision of its creators.  Having never seen or heard any of the prior productions or recordings, I have no frame of reference for comparison.  Judging this production on its own merits, however, it is a breathtaking success.

To be fair, there is plenty to nitpick.  As a concert, there is very little in the way of staging.  A large screen reveals setting changes and is used for other effects.  Whereas there are some hokey chess square graphics, the screen was largely used to good affect.  The chorus' participation particularly in ""Merano"" was a bit over the top.  Yet how else could they create a sense of fanfare?  You pretty much have to go all the way if you attempt it at all.  Is that rapping I hear in ""One Night in Bangkok""?  Rap can certainly fit naturally into a musical (e.g. ""In the Heights""), but here it sounds too contrived (someone trying to be edgy).  Despite this, that chorus is awfully catchy!  The modern choreography for ""The Arbiter"" was equally jarring on first pass (it has grown on me since, however).  The dancers have some truly beautiful choreography throughout.  Regarding the story itself, the character of Florence Vassy seems insufficiently developed.  Knowing she lost her family and that she follows her heart does not seem to be enough for such a pivotal character.  Finally, the ending leaves a lot in the air.  No tidy conclusions here.

Despite these qualms (which really are minor), the production succeeds brilliantly where it needs to most.  The cast was superb.  Adam Pascal fully commits to the role of Freddie Trumper.  Josh Groban is equally convincing as Anatoly Sergievsky.  They are in top form vocally and all three leads (including Idina Menzel as Florence) should be commended for portraying their flawed characters so sympathetically.  The other major characters were also played with verve and passion.  Kudos also to the dancers and soloists who have prominent roles and perform admirably.

Equally as important, the score is largely phenomenal.  There are beautiful ballads and powerful anthems.  The melodies are instantly catchy but complex enough not to lose their appeal after repeated listens.  They strike a strong emotional chord - equal to any other I have experienced in musical theater.  The crescendo in ""Endgame"" where a man firmly resolves to remain true to himself though he fails everyone and everything else is simply compelling drama.  Several of the songs grip the heart in one way or another.

One highlight exhibiting the genius of the story is ""The Deal"".  Here, in his silky smooth voice, the Arbiter narrates the political and emotional wrangling of the characters as just another game of chess.  The device is ingenious, the devious interactions are captivating.  ""Nobody's on nobody's side,"" indeed.

If unlike me you love a previous version of Chess, you may not benefit from this production.  If you are new to Chess, however, prepare to be blown away by an engrossing human drama.",1252281600,,3256,4.970315398886828
3874655,4,B0028SVXVM,"Chess is a really odd musical. Despite the music being quite fitting, the story fits together a bit like a mad lib. The cast of this performance however does a spectacular job of making the best of what they have. Particularly good are David Bedella and Adam Pascal- both commit to their characters and are quite enjoyable to watch. Josh Groban does a interesting interpretation of Anatoly, making him a very sympathetic character; although a closer analysis of Anatoly also makes it apparent that he could just as easily be a rather callous jerk. Altogether, this musical is very enjoyable if you are willing to engage in a suspension of disbelief with regard to the story.",1252022400,,674,4.818965517241379
3874656,4,B0028SVXVM,"I saw the origional play and there have been some changes to the show, but overall I really enjoyed it.",1251936000,,103,4.2
3874657,5,B0028SVXVM,"I join the masses who have been following the progression of this musical for the past 20+ years. Having only seen one live production, this was a fabulous treat - full orchestra, awesome chorus. The staging was terrific, as was the dancing, especially during the chess sequences.  Josh Groban was terrific - powerful, articulate, just the right amount of Russian reserve. Idina Mendel seemed stronger in the first act, but I still thoroughly enjoyed her performance.

The music is amazing. It will move you in ways you can't imagine with it's pathos and passion. I know I'll watch it again and again and share it with my other musical-loving friends!",1251936000,,651,4.909090909090909
3874658,5,B0028SVXVM,"Now, when I first heard about this, I had almost no clue what Chess was.  I had balked at the idea for some time, actually.  But upon hearing that Josh Groban, Idina Menzel AND Adam Pascal were going to be performing this together, my, uh, fangirl side went into overdrive, being huge fans of all 3 of them, and I started to look up everything on Chess.  It began to sound very interesting to me.  I watched Murray Head's music vid for One Night in Bangkok, and that was it.  I knew I had to see this.  Unfortunately, PBS wasn't too eager to show it again where I was, so I took a chance and bought the DVD.  I can say that I am very happy I did.
I have already read a lot of reviews on here about the DVD, and I am a little surprised to see how many people were so hard on Idina.  I didn't see anything horrible about her performance at all.  I liked her performance of ""Nobody's Side"" and ""I Know Him So Well"" the best.  Perhaps someone to better match Josh's rich tone of voice would have been a little better, but Idina was perfectly acceptable, considering that she's quite a bit older than Josh...
Now I go to the supporting characters.  I will start with Kerry Ellis.  What a revelation she was!  And I will agree that she was used WAY too little in the show.  But she nailed it in whatever little time she had.  I will greatly look forward to hearing her in bigger roles.
Another highlight for me in the supporting cast was David Bedella as Molokov.  He gave a very delightful and believable Russian accent without going over the top, and it was simply pleasurable to see him in each scene despite his rather sinister character.
Marti Pellow as the Arbiter...His big song has become one of my favorites from the show.  After hearing other versions of it, I will not be so harsh about him as others have been because like Idina, he was acceptable for the part in this situation.  But I have seen Raul Esparza do the song on Youtube and I think it would be a great deal of fun to see him in that part.  But Marti is a fine Arbiter as well.
Now for my favorites.  Josh Groban.  That goes without saying.  I always knew he was an amazing vocalist.  It was also a refreshing change to see him act a role.  My mother and I both agree that he completely hit the nail on the head with ""Anthem"" and ""Where I Want to Be"" (2 of my favorites.)  His performance in Chess is a simple reminder to all his fans of his immense talent.
The other favorite...Adam Pascal.  Oh. my. God!  I have followed his stuff since I became a Renthead at 15, but this was absolutely MINDBLOWING!  He could not sound more different from Josh, but he has an equally powerful voice, if not better at times.  His moments where he sings to Josh and Josh back to him work surprisingly well.  The only time his performance wasn't his absolute best was ""One Night in Bangkok.""  I personally liked Head a little better.  But even that was an absolute pleasure.  My absolute favorite song in the show has to be ""Pity the Child.""  Here Murray Head does not do better.  Adam NAILS it, doing things with his voice I had never seen him do before.  It may be one of the finest moments in his career.
In conclusion, the concert of Chess is something I highly recommend to everybody, if not for Josh and Adam alone, for everyone, minor flaws and all.",1250726400,,3308,4.262057877813505
3874659,5,B0028SVXVM,"After seeing this on PBS, while peddling on a exercise bike at the gym, I bought it because, though wearing very cheap head set, Josh Gorban's voice sounded great. Amazing amount of music and singing talent was assembled for this production. Josh Gorban, Idina Menzel, and Kerry Ellis sing some amazing solos and duets. Their voices sounded even better on a good sound system. The City of London Philharmonic was great. The story line has a definite European flavor. But using Americans as the lead singers brings emotional drama.",1250294400,,530,4.966292134831461

Since I am a low-income senior citizen I appreciate getting music, dvds' and such from your affiliates,  at a savings. I would use Deep Discount[...] again if need be. I have been enthralled with Josh Grobans' voice since I first heard him sing in 2001.
Of course the other performers in it were very good too, but as you can tell, I am prejudiced.",1249516800,,480,4.274725274725275
3874662,2,B0028SVXVM,"I've been a fan of this musical since 1984. I know almost every lyric by heart, so I was looking very forward to this DVD.

I only had to get as far as Idina's first song to realize how disappointed I was going to be. For the life of me, I can't figure out why they chose her for this part. She simply does not sound good. It is is so awful for my ears that I haven't been able to get through the entire DVD - and I have had the DVD since release date - and don't forget, this is my favorite musical of all time (I only like rock musicals).

It's a shame that one woman's voice so irritates me that I can't even bear to watch something that, when done right, I absolutely love.

Adam Pascal irritates me, as well, but not nearly as much as Idina. Murray Head defined Freddy Trumper as a laid back, cool, character. Pascal brings to much power and rock and roll. He's too uptight.

The only reason this doesn't get 1 star is because the music is so darned good and because Groban does such a great job.",1249430400,6,1001,4.040404040404041
3874663,5,B0028SVXVM,"I have been a fan of Chess since I was lucky enough to perform in the chorus of a concert version in the 80s.  It's a musical that never caught on as a stage version, but has had life in various concert versions in Europe and the U.S.  I'm so glad that Tim Rice, Benny Andersson and Bjorn Ulvaeus never gave up on this piece.  As Tim Rice says in the intro, this time they finally got it right.  The story is enhanced and tightened for post-Cold war audiences, and the traditional concert version showcases the chorus and orchestra but adds just enough staging, dance and costuming to make a compelling and moving production.

The highlight (and surprise!) of this production is Josh Groban.  I've never been a fan of his classic-pop singing, but in this production, he displays a much wider range of acting and even singing ability.  The score requires him to use a wide vocal and dramatic range and he makes the most of every second, especially the powerful ""Anthem,"" which brings down the house and deserves to become a musical theater classic.  Kerry Ellis is stunning in the relatively small part of Svetlana, and Adam Paschal makes one of the most difficult roles in musical theater look easy.  His big number, ""Pity the Child,"" is often called ""Pity the Singer"" because of its difficulty, yet he pounds it out with ease and dramatic gusto.  Although others have found Idina Menzel's performance irritating at times (and I admit, her voice could cut through glass), she acts the role of Florence with complexity and has much more subtlety in her voice than many give her credit for.

Do this show a favor and spend some time with it.  It has much more meat than most musical theater and will give you pleasure on every viewing.",1249430400,7,1733,4.609120521172638
3874664,4,B0028SVXVM,"The original Chess album is great fun; Murray Head, Tommy Korberg, and Elaine Page nailed their parts.  The 2008 version shows Josh Groban, Kerry Ellis, and Idina Menzel to be up to the task, but Adam Pascal's version of Trumper (""The American"") was too strident for me compared to Head's more cynical, less braying performance.  Marti Pellow lacks the power and authority Abriter role demands, compared to Bjorn Skif's excellent 1984 performance.  (Pellow's acting is good in the DVD version of the concert.  His voice just isn't at the same level.)  So on an individual performance level, the 1984 version has an edge.  On a production level, the 2008 stage presentation of rock songs like ""One Night in Bangkok"" and ""The Deal/No Deal"" isn't as punchy as the 1984 originals.  Between the singing and the production, I never found myself thinking, ""Wow, the 2008 version of this song is so much better than the 1984 version.""

BUT (and it's quite a big ""but"") the 2008 recordings contain so much material not present in the 1984 version, most notably the terrific ""Someone Else's Story"" but also all the little song snippets and reprises that connect the big showpiece tunes together.  As a result I'd be hard pressed to say which version of ""Chess"" I'd give to a neophyte.  Anyone who likes the 2008 recording owes it to himself to get the 1984 recording, and vice versa.  (As for the myriad other productions, I have no idea.  The musical lives up to its namesake game for variety across time.)",1249344000,,1497,4.782101167315175

3874666,3,B0028SVXVM,I caught this show on PBS in progress and had to find out how it began and what the premise of the story was.  Interesting concept and staging.  It was delightful to see how Josh has grown in his performance.  His anthem was magnificent.,1249171200,,237,4.340909090909091
3874667,5,B0028SVXVM,I saw this when it was presented on PBS.  I had never paid much attention to Josh Groban before this.  After watching the PBS telecast I was awestruck by Groban's performance and eagerly bought the DVD.  I have watched the dvd 3 times now and each viewing like this show more. The ABBA composers have created a wonderful score.  Obviously this show was on Broadway years before its time. Perhaps the success of Mamma Mia and now this concert performance of Chess will inspire a staged revival...  But until then I fully recommend this concert performance.,1249171200,,555,4.739583333333333
3874668,4,B0028SVXVM,"Funny how different people see things like this so differently sometimes. The production as a whole is amazing. I have loved Chess its whole life. I saw a touring production several years ago. Frankly the production has gone through so many updates and changes that it hardly resembles that original recording from the 80's. That's fine of course, because Chess still really works. I love Josh Groban, but I disagree that he did a good acting job here. He wasn't the worst by any means, but he had almost no range of emotion in his face, etc. His voice is excellent of course and his ""Anthem"" is awe-inspiring; but his inexperience in acting showed. The ladies were fantastic. No one else is Elaine Page though so we gotta' give that up. I realize that this Florence wasn't to everyone's taste but I actually think she DID show more emotion and genuiness in her delivery of some critical lines. I bought into the dreaminess of her ""great expectations"" and then the devastation at her utter loss (lover, friend, father, etc). I agree 100% that Kerry Ellis was flawless and probably the very best performance. The look on her face when she is telling Anatoly off at the end (""Liar"") is POWERFUL! I'm glad she wasn't looking at me right then.

My wife and I agreed that the Arbiter had all of the right mannerisms and attitude, but he was announced at the beginning as the ""sensation from Scotland"" (never heard of him) and then didn't deliver in my opinion; I was looking for a much more powerful and edgy voice for this role - dare I say, flamboyant. Molokov was good, as well as the others. Nothing really stands out in those areas. But I have to comment on the West End Chorus - has there ever been a better use of the chorus? To stand in for the local crowds in Merano was inspired; and the Chorus obviously really got into it. You could tell that they just had a ball. Then near the end when they sing the names of the former chess champions was gorgeous.

I really loved this whole production and will be glad to have it in my collection of Chess (joining the original recording, the awful American version, the original Chess program from England a friend brought back to me and my own program from a US tour). This DVD is very worthy of high praise.",1248393600,,2255,4.484184914841849
3874669,5,B0028SVXVM,"Almost all the negative reviews of both the DVD and CD versions of this concert are from long time fans of Chess.  These people had expectations that I didn't because I had never  heard of the musical before I saw it on PBS.  I do agree with some of the negative comments, but overall from start to finish I thought this was a wonderful production.  It took  a few airings before I understood the story, but I enjoyed the staging, singing (including the chorus) and dancing from the beginning.  And the more I see it, the more I discover something new to appreciate.  I love David Bedella as the Soviet ""handler"".  His facial expressions are a perfect balance between sinister and falsely sweet.

Keep in mind  this is a recording of a live performance. You can't expect everyone to be spot on as they would have been in a studio production.

I also happen to love Rent and although I have never seen Wicked, I own the soundtrack.  I remember One Night in Bangkok being performed by Murray Head back in the 80's blaring on my car radio often.  So, I'm pretty primed for this musical.  I enjoyed the concert setting and the bare bones approach to the performance.  There was no need for extravagant sets, everything you need for the story to be told was right there on the stage with the musicians, the chorus and the star performers.  Josh Groban has admitted in many interviews that I have read that he wanted to do musical theater.  With this performance, I'd say he succeeded immensely and I will buy tickets to see him in concert as well as on stage in another musical production like Chess.

Imagine my suprise when I then purchased the original concept album, with all the additional songs and different storyline (on Broadway, Anatoly and Freddie play the chess match together and Freddie wins).

I was so excited when PBS broadcast this concert but I was thrown by the fact that there now additional pieces of music I never heard before and sorry to say, Idina Menzel really didn't seem to properly inhabit the part of Florence.

However, I wanted to get the CD to listen to again and I've got to say that this concert performance has really grown on me...ALOT.  Divorcing the music from the visuals has given me a brand new appreciation for this performance.  The orchestrations are amazing, and the singing is uniformly fantastic.

I intend to purchase the DVD to relive the whole experience, now that I've settled into this performance.  I'm just really grateful to have an opportunity to see this production finally.",1246924800,,1009,4.8654970760233915
3874681,2,B0028SVXVM,"Let me get this out of the way up front: as a musical, Chess doesn't work. It didn't work in London, it didn't work on Broadway, and it hasn't worked in any of the innumerable versions that have cropped up since. And it certainly doesn't work in this concert version, a mostly tasteless affair partly redeemed by the music of Bjrn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson, and the presence Josh Groban.

I pay virtually no attention to popular music, so although I was aware of Josh Groban, I had never heard any of his work. I may need to seek out some of his other stuff, because I really liked what I heard. Groban has a rich, sonorous voice and terrific stage presence. And he shows admirable restraint amid the crass production (one word: choral-ography) and histrionic cast mates surrounding him.

Leading the charge toward excess is Idina Menzel as Florence. Oh, she can scream with the best of 'em, but her style has no subtlety, and her acting skills are rudimentary at best. Close on Menzel's overwrought heels is Adam Pascal, who exhibits here the same cloying vocal catches, scoops, slurs, and growls evident in the cast recording of Rent, as well as the same cardboard acting style. Although I do have to say that there seemed to be some genuine pathos in evidence during ""Pity the Child.""

The appeal of Chess has always been the gorgeous, chill-inducing music by Bjrn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson, combined with Tim Rice's often-inspired but sometimes-clunky lyrics. The stripped-down book of the concert version renders the relevance of many of the songs opaque, if not incomprehensible. But even if Chess the show doesn't work, the songs do, particularly the soaring ""Anthem"" and the thrilling duet ""You and I,"" both of which feature Groban to positively stirring effect.

The concert version of Chess reverts back to the structure and song list of the concept album and the London version of the show, restoring a number of admittedly fun songs that don't belong in the show, including ""Embassy Lament,"" and ""The Merchandisers,"" the levity of which throws off the show's tone. And ""One Night in Bangkok"" remains, as always, an irrelevant cheese-fest.

But the concert also includes ""Someone Else's Story,"" which was written for the Broadway version, to be sung by Florence. However, in the concert version the song goes to Svetlana, Anatoly's wife. This makes no sense at all. Here is a song about someone deciding whether to stay or leave, but this character is not in that position; Anatoly has already left her. This change was probably made to accommodate one Kerry Ellis, who is currently playing Elphaba in the London Wicked. Which makes sense, because Ellis here has all the vocal restraint and acting talent of Idina Menzel. Which is to say, not much.

So, there are two reasons to be interested in this concert: Josh Groban and the music. I say skip the DVD and buy the CD. Better yet, just buy the songs that have Groban on them. The folks at iTunes seem to understand this, and have priced the separate cuts accordingly: any track that features Groban costs $1.29, while the rest are 99 cents. (Heads up: All the songs are $0.99 at Amazon)

Chess has always been a show that's very close to my heart, ever since I bought the concept album in college. But I've long since given up hope that it will ever work as a show. It's probably time that the show's creators do the same.",1246579200,11,3390,4.735593220338983
3874682,2,B0028SVXVM,"While I hope more people are introduced to this musical, I found this production a disappointment. Josh Groban was surprisingly good singing musical theater, I hope he does more in the future. Adam Pascal's performance was also a treat; I had only seen him in Rent and thought his performance as The American was really outstanding.

This musical has been a ""work in progress"" since the mid-80's. The original concept album is outstanding - if you haven't heard it, I strongly suggest you get it. When the production was brought to the US, they tweaked it - ugh. And they've been messing with it constantly since then.
The result - what was a reasonably streamlined, musically gorgeous story has been chopped up and - I think - overengineered for the masses. Kind of dumbed down (and uglied up) in the process.

Bottom line: if you want to own a musical performance of Chess, get the original concept album with Tommy Korberg, Murray Head and Elaine Paige. They got it right the first time.",1246320000,23,990,4.716763005780347

For me this is the beauty of music - any music - something gets under your skin and won't leave...amazing :) If you've never heard Chess - now is the time to start. If you are a veteran since 1984 - this version has it all. Highly recommended.

Where did the song ""Someone Else's Story"" come from? It wasn't in 1984 score. I love it..",1246233600,2,454,4.341176470588235
3874684,4,B0028SVXVM,"I like that this handsome new version conveys a fairly coherent story, and the physical production quality is rather good.  About as theatrical as it can be in a concert hall.  I look at this thinking a return to something like the original London production's movable Chessboard floor flanked by media walls could serve this show well.

I too would have preferred a somewhat better cast, but the weakest link to me is the gentleman who did the Arbiter.  Probably a very nice and talented fellow, his vocal performance here is just too soft and lacks the sharp articulation to be fully understood and convey the attitude of the character.  Whatever his native accent may be, it's not terribly hard to adopt ""Stage English"" and simply enunciate.  His voice may be very pleasant for a softer romantic lead, but here it is just not easy to make out his words.

Overall I'm very happy to have this and will eventually buy the audio album (why are Downloads no cheaper than the physical CD?  I'd rather pay the same or a bit more and get the booklet.)  Speaking of which, this DVD has a very handsome 10 page booklet, with interesting text and nice photos - quite beyond the single card one usually gets.

Creatively, I also like that the original logo art was retained, as it's one of the best of its kind.

A big disappointment is the total lack of video extras on the disc.  We all know interviews have been done with the cast to promote this production.  It's not like there wasn't room for them on the disc.  I wonder if the Blu-Ray will have a bunch of extras that us poor folk don't get.",1246147200,3,1589,4.472222222222222

I was also excited to see and hear Kerri Ellis after reading reviews from her Elphaba run.  But I was very disappointed in it.  I didn't enjoy the story, the ""filler"" music didn't keep my interest, and the songs I have loved for so long didn't match up to versions already done.  And I'm not just talking about Elaine Paige or Judi Kuhn (both of whom I love), but when you've heard Michael Ball's stirring rendition of Anthem, Josh Groban just didn't match up (which surprised me); or Lea Salonga's version of Someone Else's Story, Kerri Ellis didn't come close with her strange diction.  So I'll just stick with listening to my favorites.  I did enjoy the last You and I with Josh and Idina, and I'm glad they made it a DVD so I could finally see it.",1246060800,2,850,4.382165605095541
3874686,5,B0028SVXVM,"I must admit that my take on this wonderful performance seems to be a little bit different from the majority of the opinions here. I am a huge Josh Groban fan and an even bigger RENT head so this show was perfect for me. Having never seen the original and thus having noone to compare it to, I can honestly say that this performance truly lived up to its expectations.

A few things, Josh Groban has a wonderful operatic and pure voice, but for me he was the one who was miscast in this role. As we move along he seems to get more comfortable and more in tune with the cast, but overall his acting was poor in the role. Kerry Ellis was phenomenal in her role as Svetlana, as with most who have written a review, I wished that she had more screen time. Martel Pillow as the Arbiter was fantastic, although at times I wish that they had increased the volume in his mike as sometimes the orchestra seemed to be playing over him. Idina Menzel has always been a favorite of mine, her first few notes in Merano were a bit timid and pitchy for her, but from then on she soars as only she can. In my opinion she more than held up her end of the bargain and I actually thought her acting was quite good in the role. The real star of the show was Adam Pascal. From the first note as Freddy he becomes the role and is totally believable...hoenstly Ive never heard him sound better.

True fans of any of the cast should definitly buy or rent the dvd or download the songs...it is well worth it and youll find yourself playing several of the numbers over and over again",1245974400,2,1556,4.20066889632107
3874687,3,B0028SVXVM,"I'm as big a devotee of ""Chess"" as the next musical fan, but this concert version does not make a great case for a revival in the near future. The score, with music by ABBA members Bjorn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson and lyrics by Tim Rice, remains sublime, as it contains some of the best songs from any modern musical. The mix of pop-rock and classical music is still thrilling, and Rice's lyrics are thoroughly literate--sophisticated and witty. The score is the best reason to recommend this DVD (though if you're new to ""Chess,"" you should get acquainted with the original concept CD first).

The problem with ""Chess,"" as clearly evidenced here, is its lack of dramatic... oomph. (Rice readily admits this, and the show has been endlessly tinkered with, including a major rewrite for Broadway, after the London version).  The conceit of the show, which uses the World Chess Championship as its backdrop, and the intricacies of the game as a metaphor for 1980s Cold War politics and love relationships, is still a clever idea. Unfortunately, it just never really comes together--as much as the songs are fantastic on their own, the characters and plot are just not compelling.

The cast here does pretty well. Adam Pascal as the American chess champion Freddy comes off best, effortlessly conveying a laidback charm and powerful rock voice, and delivering mightily on ""Pity the Child."" Josh Groban also does well as the Russian Anatoly, using his BOOMING VOICE effectively most of the time. Idina Menzel, though, as much as I admire her, feels vocally miscast as Florence (Freddy's lover/assistant, later Anatoly's lover/assistant). By the time we get to her duet with Kerry Ellis as Anatoly's deserted wife Svetlana (""I Know Him So Well""), it occurred to me that the ladies should have been playing the opposite roles. David Bedella, so good in ""Jerry Springer the Opera,"" has fun in the rather thankless role of Molokov, Anatoly's handler.

Watching this concert, I couldn't help but think that there must be SOME way to make this show gel better. Can't Freddy and Florence's relationship be better defined? Can't her motivation to move on to Anatoly make better sense? And what's this business about Hungary 1956, and why is that important? And Florence's father is alive? Why don't we care about any of these characters? In fact, who are we even supposed to care about?? They're all sort of unlikable. If that's the point (and it very well might be- to paraphrase a lyric, ""Eveybody's playing the game/ but nobody's rules are the same/ nobody's on nobody's side""), make the characters more truly devious in their plotting. The thing is, I don't think these problems are unsolvable. I think we just need a few more nicely positioned numbers. I would suggest changing a LOT of the beginning, especially ""Merano"" and stuff from the opening of the Chess Championship (""Arbiter's Song,"" etc.). Yes, I like these songs, but they do tend to drag things down just when we should be starting to get interested.

The concert itself is not particularly well conceived, and doesn't do a whole lot to cover the show's flaws. There is a lot of background mugging by the choir and various ensemble members, making the proceedings more corny than necessary. Also cheesing things up are some horribly amateurish looking graphics, projected on a big screen above the stage. Most cringe-inducing is the choreography throughout the opening chess ceremony (another reason to cut a lot of that), and, especially, the use of ballet dancers during the chess matches (I thought this was called ""Chess,"" not ""Ballet""! With all the talk about the wonders of the game, you'd think they would want to focus us on the game, instead of distracting us. I guess there's no getting around the fact chess is sort of boring.) Still, there are those fantastic songs...",1245801600,6,3837,4.924265842349304
3874688,5,B0028SVXVM,"tThis production was mounted to celebrate the 25th anniversary of this  well-balanced concept album. The score includes symphonic, edgy rock music and pop ballads. The production features a stellar cast, headlined by Josh Groban, to whom has been entrusted the work's best ballad.  He does not disappoint.  I read a moronic comment in another customer review suggesting that Groban should  ""pretend that he's struggling through a bridge or fighting for a note.""  Well, Mr. Cowboy, Groban is a professional fully up to the task he has undertaken.  Try not to take the term ""critic"" so seriously and to makeobjective substantive comments.  Groban does indeed sail through a difficult role and his acting is natural.  Adam Pascal(""Rent"") shows great personality and stage presence performing the album's biggest hit  ""one Night In Bangkok,""which he sing/talks and dances with the chorus. The rest of the cast is grand standouts include Marti Peller as the Arbiter(referee), who gets to sing the line ""Don't try to tempt me, there's no hope, I don't like women and don't take dope."" and David Bedella as the sinister Soviet Molokov",1245715200,2,1127,5.148351648351649
3874689,5,B0028SVXVM,"I've been listening to the original pre-production cast recording of ""Chess"" for decades and never tire of it. I will always remember seeing ""Chess"" in London in 1986. The end of the Cold War sounded a death knell for such a topical piece of musical theater at the time but it's been long enough for a revival and I'm overjoyed to see that there is a new DVD out of the live from the Royal Albert Hall concert version of ""Chess"". Perhaps this will draw some interest among the multitude of Josh Groban fans and the world will finally sit up and take notice of this highly under-rated and long-neglected masterpiece. Can't wait to view this DVD - it's been far too long in coming.",1245628800,,679,4.44
3874690,4,B0028SVXVM,Did you know that a limited-edition CD/DVD release of the CHESS concert is exclusively available through Josh Groban's and Idina Menzel's websites?  Check it out!,1245628800,5,162,5.48
3874691,5,B0028SVXVM,"The 2008 production of ""Chess in Concert"" is a masterpiece in my view.  Moreover, it contains my favorite score of music ever composed for the stage.  For someone like me who loved the original production back in 1984, it's like an old friend coming back to life.  No, we don't have the sexy little blonde, Elaine Paige, to hit all the high notes with ease but we have a lot of other things.

Anyone who views the storyline of ""Chess"" as trivial is simply wrong.  I remember back in 1972, when Bobby Fischer beat the Russians and the chess world was sent tumbling.  Even a person with no interest in chess could sense how the Soviet mystique was shattered.

16 years later, the USSR collapsed and the West had won the cold war.  Bobby Fischer may have flipped out later on and embarrassed himself but he did his part in helping mankind survive.  In January, 2008, he died in Reykjavik, Iceland, the place where he won his world title.  Rest in peace, Bobby.

Back on ""Chess in Concert,"" Tim Rice says ""after 25 years we may finally be getting it right."" My wife and I agree.  What Sir Tim and his collaborators have given us are 2  hours of one great song after another, joined to a now-coherent story, and beautiful visual effects.  It all builds to a stirring conclusion that surpassed all our expectations.

The show has everything--drama, humor, dance, visuals, music, and some of the best lyrics anywhere.  If critics continue to say that it's too cerebral that's their problem.  I think I know when something's good and this is very good indeed.

Which songs do we love most? Are they the lively ones, like ""One Night in Bangkok?""  ""The Arbiter?""  Or, the playful witty pieces like ""Merano?"" ""The Diplomats Lament?"" ""The Merchandisers?"" ""A Model of Decorum and Tranquility?""

Then what about the moving ballads?  ""Where I Want to Be?"" ""Heaven Help My Heart?"" ""Anatoly's Anthem?""  ""I Know Him So Well?""  ""Someone Else's Story?""  ""You and I?""

Even the rough-edged numbers like, ""Nobody's Side,"" ""Difficult and Dangerous Times,"" and ""Pity the Child"" are dramatic and memorable.  Pick a favorite or high point?  You make the call.  I certainly can't.  There's so much here that the uninitiated might want to view Act 1 the first night and save Act 2 for another time.

Comparing this cast and performances to those of 25 years ago is not easy.  There still is a lot to recommend the 1984 cast and staging.  Nevertheless, the new version has Josh Groban; he is a marvel in his role as Anatoly, the defecting Russian.  The range and power of Josh's voice are well-suited to his part.

Did Idina Menzel make us forget Elaine Paige?  Maybe not.  But Idina has a big voice, too, and fine stage presence.  To me, she holds her own in the comparison.  My wife and I see the role of Florence as key to the whole show.  Idina carries it off beautifully.

Well into Act 2, Kerry Ellis appears as Anatoly's estranged wife Svetlana and almost steals the show.  Her rendition of ""Someone Else's Story"" is as moving a song on lost love as we've ever heard.  Later on, Kerry sings a duet with Idina in ""I Know Him So Well.""  Would someone help me to my feet?

There are several other cast members worthy of note, including Adam Pascal as Freddie, the American champion; Clarke Peters as Walter, the West's impressario; David Bedella, as Molokov, the Russian head man; and Marti Fellow, as the Arbiter.  They all turn in fine performances.

We also have the western diplomats, the marvelous dancers, the 50-piece orchestra, and the 100-person choir.  Masterful coordination is done by the director, Hugh Wooldridge and David Firman, the conductor.  Yes, Sir Tim, you've got it right.

At 2 hours and 15 minutes into the program, my wife and I were exhausted.  (Who knows how the cast was able to keep going?)  I couldn't imagine musical theater getting any better.  But then the finale came with Josh and Idina singing ""You and I"" at the top of their lungs while holding hands.  Wow, is all I can say.

To our surprise, PBS did a broadcast of ""Chess in Concert"" the day before the DVD was released.  For those who might have recorded the program off TVa question might be why buy the DVD?  Answers include widescreen format and the ease of a) adding Subtitles, b) invoking SurroundSound, c) navigating to favorite songs, and d) reading end credits.

Video transfer of this DVD concert is impeccable.  Nevertheless, more ""making of"" interviews and features would be nice.  Maybe those will come with a Collector's Edition?  If so, we might hear from the Swedish geniuses, Benny Anderson and Bjorn Ulvaeus.  Without them there'd be no ABBA music, no ""Mamma Mia,"" and no ""Chess in Concert.""

Is ""Chess in Concert"" perfect?  No.  Why Sir Tim Rice would throw in an ""F--- You,"" from the American to the Russian toward the end was vulgar and out-of-place.  But I'm giving this work five (5) stars for all its grand design, innumerable classic songs, choral and instrumental accompaniment, choreography, and stunning visual effects.  At twice its current price, this DVD is a real bargain.",1245542400,11,5069,4.698177676537585
3874692,5,B0028SVXVM,"I've been a fan of Chess since the concept album was released. Although I wasn't able to catch the original show in London, the couple of US versions I saw left me cold. When I heard the London concert was going to be filmed and released for PBS/DVD, I was hoping that they would go back to the London version. I wasn't disappointed!

As far as I'm concerned, Kerry Ellis as Svetlana made the show. Her version of I Know Him So Well sent shivers down my spine and the quick smile on her face on the last phrase of the duet told me she knew she had nailed it!",1245456000,2,558,4.072727272727272
3874693,5,B0028SVXVM,"Finally a concert that makes justice to one of the most underated musicals of all times. A flop when it opened in Broadway, CHESS is and always will be a most beautiful loser, containing a wonderful score and terrific songs. I had always wanted to see this show. This DVD gives the opportunity to all of us who did not see it live on stage to get a clear idea on what it is and what may become on stage. After seeing it the doubt comes whether this is a concert or a full-scale theatrical production. The thing is that there's acting, costumes and choreographies, which makes it closer to a theatrical staging rather than a recital. The production is simply awsome and the interpreters...well, silly would be to praise Josh Groban 'cause he simply does not need any presentation, being one of the best singers in the world at present. The rest of the cast, to Groban's standards: simply magnificent. The orchestra and the impresive choir rounds up a show that will linger forever in your minds. By any means, don't miss this: just the experience to watch it at least once pays the price of this priceless, unique and marvelous show.
One last thing: the box brings a detailed account on the history of the musical written by Tim Rice and a complete summary of the plot, besides, it has english subtitles.",1245456000,3,1303,4.572649572649572
3874694,4,B0028SVXVM,"Pros:
-Almost everyone sings amazingly.
-The music is wonderful.
-The fact that all of this was rehearsed in UNDER A WEEK is nothing short of mind blowing.
-Adam Pascal is mind blowing in his reprise of ""Pity the Child"". It is the ultimate show stealer.
-Idina is amazing, if a little vocally stressed sometimes. The same goes for Josh and Kerry.

Cons:
-Terrible book. Get another writer, one who is coherent and can keep the show running in under 2 hours and 30 minutes.
-Yes, it is over two hours. Worst of all, it feels like that sometimes in some of the instrumental pieces or unnecessary moments.
-Someone please recast the Arbiter. I don't care if Marti Pellow is ""The Pride of Scotland"", he can't sing a note if his life depended on it.
-Josh Groban is an amazing singer. Acting wise...well, thank God he's a great singer.
-Kerry Ellis is woefully underused and her songs feel rushed, as if the director said, ""Holy Sh**! We forgot to put her in the show!"" Her songs do nothing to advance the plot and take up time, but they do sound pretty.
-David Bedella could have done this without the Russian accent. It's distracting from an otherwise fun character, and no other ""Russian"" in the show speaks as such.
-LONG. ORCHESTRAL. PIECES. They sound good, but don't know when to end.
-Clarke Peters suffers from having a character that isn't well defined, which leads to a few plot holes (for example, the entire climax of Act II). He has a beautiful voice that never gets proper usage, and is reduced to mugging the stage for most of Act II.

It's a good show, but just has too many flaws. If you are a die hard fan, you will love this regardless. Otherwise, get the soundtrack. And fast forward through the Arbiter's songs.",1245369600,3,1728,4.570967741935484
3874695,5,B0028SVXVM,"Having only been familiar with the concept and cast albums and loving the score, I never really understood the storyline which seemed to change from production to production. With this amazing concert, it all becomes clear and once again proves the old adage: the play's the thing.  All great musicals have great stories (GYPSY, WEST SIDE STORY, MISS SAIGON to name just a few).  Now, finally seeing the work as a whole, I could fully appreciate the entire production.  And what a production it is: I personally thought the cast was perfect right down to the smallest part and must say, my wife and I were extremely impressed with Josh Groban's performance. He has never sounded better and his acting was wonderful. Very natural and believable. Actually we thought everyone was above par in the acting department considering how difficult it can be to ""act"" in a concert form. Technically, everything was excellent.  This is a brilliant concert from start to finish.  One that we will watch repeatedly.",1245369600,,1002,4.940476190476191
3874696,4,B0028SVXVM,"I've been looking forward to seeing this production ever since I heard about it over a year ago when it was originaly produced.  I admit to being a Grobanite and am pre-dispositioned to automatically love anything he does.  This, however, was so much more than I thought it would be!

Although this is shown as a concert, the simple stage sets makes it seem as if it were a full production with scenery changes.  The characters are brought to life by the performers with some (unexpected) wonderful acting talent in addition to the vocals!

My only discontent with the finished product is the ""nails on blackboard"" voice of Idina Menzel.  She has incredible power in her voice - her notes fill the hall with sound - but she overpowers the other singers and the nasally tone kept me constantly adjusting the volume down when she was singing.  I know she's popular and has a huge fan base, and to be honest I was looking forward to seeing what the fuss was about. But it didn't do it for me.

The fun song ""One Night in Bangkok"" was also a mild disappointment.  I remember well the original top 40 version of the song, and it was silly, fun and catchy.  This one was - not.

Don't let my personal disappointments stop you from listening to this!  Again, Idina Menzel has a huge fan base so most people will probably disagree with my critique.  Either way, the rest of the show is so fantastic that it's worth a couple of cringes on a note here and there to experience the rest of this powerful musical.

Josh Groban steals it and holds it hostage, and it's in wonderful hands!",1245369600,6,1574,4.458041958041958
3874697,5,B0028SVXVM,"I saw the Actor's fund production of Chess in Concert in 2003, and this production is a VAST improvement, not only in the production value, but also in the story line.  The cast was, for the most part, amazing!!  Adam Pascal was born to play Freddy, the arrogant American champion.  Josh Groban was superb as Anatoly, the level headed an subdued Russian champion.  David Bedella was great as Molokov, and Kerry Ellis was also wonderful as Svetlana.  But unfortunately, this is where the good moves as far as casting stop.  Marti Pellow was fine as the arbiter, but in comparison to the amazing Raul Esparza (who played the arbiter in the one night Actor's fund performance), Pellow was just ok.  I know Idina Menzel is a superstar of the stage and she was phenomenal as Elpheba.  However, she did NOTHING in the role of Florence, she was for me, the biggest dissapointment of this production.  Her acting was mediocre at best.  After watching it, I wished that Kerry Ellis had been given the part of Florence instead.  Josh Groban did a better job at acting and he practically has no acting experience.  I was even disappointed in Idina's singing.  I think ""Nobody's Side"" is a great song and it should be powerful, but her version of it was just cold, no fire...it just fell flat. Other than that, the music in Chess is always fantastic and it didn't disappoint.  The orchestra and the choir were incredible!! The vocal stand outs in my opinion were Josh Groban and Kerry Ellis.  The performance of `Anthem' and `Where I want to be' by Groban, literally gave me chills.  Kerry's ""Someone else's story"" was great!!!  I think Tim Rice did an amazing job at reworking the book.  The show made more sense that it ever has.  I think it could be better if a few more lines of dialogue are added to clarify points and make the story line flow better, but it was really, really great!!!!!!!  Overall, this was AMAZING!!

3874699,5,B0028SVXVM,"For all of you Chess fans out there, this is what we have been waiting for.  Tim Rice was right when he said they finally got it right.  Musically and thematically, they took the best from both the London and Broadway versions to come up with yet another storyline to this storied musical.  Spoiler alert......the Russian wins again at the end of the show.  There were some other changes as well, such as Svetlana now singing ""Someone Else's Story"" and it works fine with the story.  The casting was on the whole, superb.  Maybe Josh's huge classical voice would not be my first choice as the Russian, but you will still have chills running down your spine during the last minute of ""Anthem"" to close out act one.  The rest of the cast was uniformally excellent with special kudos to Adam as Freddie and Kerry as Svetlana.  There was also a terrific huge chorus.  Idina has become the female singer of choice for rock type musicals.  Although I would have loved to see Judy Kuhn or Elaine Paige reprise Florence's role again,  Idina does not disappoint.  Considering that this was a concert version, there was quite a bit of acting going on, and some of it was quite amusing( the dancers during the arbiters song had me laughing out loud).  If you are a fan of this show(which is probably a safe statement to make since you are this far into the reviews), go buy it.  Just go buy it.  I'd give it 6 stars if I could.  Go buy it.....Right now.",1245369600,5,1442,4.4465648854961835
3874700,4,B0028SVXVM,"I've heard of ""Chess"" but never got around to seeing a live production or listening to a soundtrack. As an ABBA fan I was always curious what kind of musical Benny and Bjorn would produce since their ABBA pop-rock tunes were so incredible. Then PBS announced a special concert version of ""Chess"" featuring Josh Groban, Idina Menzel and Adam Pascal. So I watched it....

Wow! ""Chess In Concert"" really looked and sounded impressive. The only thing was I had trouble with the diction. I had to put the captions on to truly understand what was happening on stage. Once I got to view the lyrics with the vocals I was very impressed and kinda blown away by it all.

I'm not a ""Grobanite"" but I have to admit that Josh Groban (Anatoly) did a good job both vocally and dramatically. Adam Pascal (Frederick) never disappoints me. I could listen to his raspy rock voice all day long. Same with Idina Menzel (Florence). No, I'm not a ""Grobanite"" but this ""Renthead"" was very pleased to see the original Maureen and Roger share the stage again.

I also liked Kerry Ellis as Anatoly's wife, Svetlana. Ellis has a really neat voice that seems to be very sweet but with a touch of edginess (and what an irony that both Menzel and Ellis played the role of Elphaba in ""Wicked""). The cast had a nice mix of classical operatic voices and rock opera wailers. The score is the same way with a blending of ballads, anthems, and toe tapping dance tracks.

Aside from the lavish staging (including a huge on-stage orchestra and a small army of choir singers), the powerful vocals and the dramatic score the story of ""Chess In Concert"" was easier to follow than I thought it would be. It's your basic love triangle scenario with Frederick losing his partner, Florence, to Anatoly except that Anatoly is already married with kids. Then things get more complicated because of politics, greed and chess tournaments.

Overall, even if you don't buy ""Chess In Concert"" then you should at least rent this or catch it on public television because this is a sensational performance by a large assortment of talented singers and dancers. One way you can identify a good musical is if you're caught humming the tunes after the show is done. I've got at least five on my mental IPOD as we speak (The Arbiter, Nobody's On Nobody's Side, Pity The Child, One Night In Bangkok, I Know Him So Well). ""Chess In Concert"" is good.",1245283200,46,2387,4.620283018867925
3874701,5,B0028SVXVM,"The real star here is Kerry Ellis as Svetlana. She has far too little stage time, and I would have liked to have had her try her hand at Florence.

3874702,5,B0028SVXVM,"I watched ""Chess in Concert"" last night as PBS featured it on ""Great Performances.""  I imiagine that I will now have to purchase both the DVD (Since I don't imagine it will ever be turned into a regular feature film) and the CD, which will be the third different version in my collection.

I fell in love with the show when I first heard the original concept album with Murray Head, Elaine Paige and others back in 1984 when it was first released, and it is still the version I listen to most.  I saw the original Broadway cast featuring David Carroll and Judy Kuhn in one of its 48 performances at the Imperial Theater in NYC.  That production was very underrated and should have run much longer, but it was the same season that NYC got ""The Phantom of the Opera"" which swept the Tony Awards.  When David Carroll sang ""Anthem"" to end Act I, he had the audience out of their seats cheering and applauding even before the song was finished, something I only saw one other time (Jennifer Holliday's ""And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going"" from ""Dreamgirls"").  I also saw a nice production of it by the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera in the 90s.  One can only imagine what it would have been like had Michael Bennett not become ill and having to withdraw from staging it...Trevor Nunn did it instead.

Which brings us to this version of ""Chess in Concert.""  As Tim Rice explains at the beginning, it has been a work-in-progress, and they have tightened up the book quite a bit, keeping the best of the songs on both of the CDs I do have.  The plotlines regarding Global TV were not there originally which give the character of Freddy more to do in Act II. However, the Broadway version had a slightly different ending regarding the Soviets' release of Florence's father who supposedly had been imprsoned since the 1956 Hungarian uprising--they gave her an old man who turned out not to be her dad at all.  This version leaves it up in the air at the end.

There have now been reprises put in which were not there at first, as well as a couple of new songs I previously did not know.  The performances here are quite fine, with Idina Menzel being the standout as Florence.  Her character now has the weight of that of Anatoly, which makes the romance between them more plausible.  Josh Groban as Anatoly does well in his acting debut, and Adam Pascal is good as well.

And the staging of some of the big numbers (""The Story of Chess,"" ""The Merchandisers,"" and ""Bangkok/One Night in Bangkok"") is excellent, given the concert setting, using the choir and dancers effectively.

Anyone who is into this show will want to purchase the DVD for their collection, as well as the audio CD.",1245283200,15,2671,4.496894409937888
3874703,4,B0028SVXVM,"I attended the concert, and it was the most extraordinary concert I've ever attended. But it was not sublime and it had it's problems.

When I watched the concert I fell in love with Marti Pellow's Arbiter right away. He performed ""The Story of Chess"" brilliantly. In fact, so brilliantly that the audience held it's applause. Everything was wonderful and grand until ""Anthem"". I have to say that Mr. Groban's performing was less than satisfying. First off, his acting is horrendous. Secondly, his voice is strong and beautiful, but it didn't quite fit the character. And thirdly, he sang was out of pitch at the leap from ""How could I leave her"" too ""Where could I start?"". And from there on and out the song was overall ruined. Even though he ruined the first act finale, he didn't do as bad in his other songs. He was actually pretty good in ""Where I Want to Be"". But enough with the criticism of Groban.

Chess in Concert was fabulous. The cast was overall quite good, and the chorus was excellent. I can't quite understand why so many people were complaining about the sound quality. From where I sat in the audience, I could hear everything perfectly fine.",1244851200,4,1162,4.635922330097087
3874704,5,B0028SVXVM,"I saw Chess  back in the 80's  in London at the Prince Edward theatre after purchasing the LP.  The cavernous venue and poor staging didn't help realize the album's full potential on stage.  There was a hydraulic lift similar to Cats.  It worked wonderfully for the duet Wasn't It Great?  But became hackneyed with repeated use.  I have an old video of 4 songs from the album done as  clips in the 80's style.

I will certainly consider purchasing this new DVD version  in order to experience the full potential of the great score.",1244764800,2,531,4.553191489361702
8356976,5,B0028SVXVM,"I've probably watched this fifteen times since I got it.  Josh Groban does an outstanding job as the Russian, and really, there is no letdown in this.  The SOVIET MACHINE is a piece not in other versions of this.  Really great.  I'd have to say that Murray Head still owns PITY THE CHILD and ONE NIGHT IN BANGKOK, but Adam Pascal brings so much to the role across the board. Play it for your FROZEN fangirl, for Idina Menzel does an awesome job. Kerry Ellis, awesome.  One interesting thing about this performance: Queen Elizabeth II was present when this performance took place, so when Florence and Anatoly are saying their farewells, they only hug, but do not kiss. It's against the rules of etiquette to kiss before a monarch.  Think of that when Adam Pascal is getting a bit of an upper thigh massage during ONE NIGHT IN BANGKOK.  lol.  Special mention of Clarke Peters and David Bedella.  Dance fans will enjoy this, too.  Truly a special performance of an underrated musical.",1523923200,,982,4.656976744186046
8356977,5,B0028SVXVM,"American Broadway version really botched the transfer from England.  But the music by members of ABBA is MOVING.  This is one of my favorite musicals and favorite recordings.  Beyond this, I recommend the British Original cast recording over the Broadway version.  Either would be very satisfying.",1523059200,,297,5.391304347826087
8356978,4,B0028SVXVM,"I thought this was a superb production and suited the Albert Hall as a venue to host it. It certainly
plays much better than the actual musical show. It was a gift and the recipients certainly enhoyed it
too  The orchestra and chorus were just lovely and the leads especially Josh Gorban was just
superb.",1518134400,,304,4.527272727272727
