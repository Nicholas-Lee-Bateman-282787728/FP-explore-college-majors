7833276,5,6302977150,"My wife and I were first acquainted with Bethie when we picked up a cassette entitled ""Bethie's Really Silly Songs About Animals"" at a thrift shop, several months before our 4-year-old daughter was born. The tape kept us quite entertained during the hellish trips in the car we had to take while our daughter was a baby. It usually stopped her from crying. We know all the songs by heart, some of which are on ""Really Silly Clubhouse."" We obtained the video in a bargain bin at a Burlington Coat Factory/Baby Depot store. The only thing disappointing about the video is that ""Sittin' on a Farm"" -the best song from the ""Really Silly Songs"" tape, isn't featured.
In case you've never heard the aforementioned song, it's a hilarious ode to the wonders of the food chain!
Now we have a three-week old son, and he's destined to become a Bethie fan, too! We'd love to buy more ""Bethie"" creations, but she seems to have fallen off the face of the Earth.
Bring back Bethie!",1021939200,,966,4.557471264367816
7833277,5,6302977150,"My wife and I accidentally stumbled on this video during a trip to California a few years back.  It's absolutely delightful.  We bought the cassette too; the songs are so clever and bouncy.  We particularly like  ""To Dance with the Bears.""  The video is energetic.  Too bad only  one episode was made.  The programming departments for Saturday morning  television missed the boat on this one.  If you can find this tape for your  pre-school kids, you won't be disappointed.  A classic!  Bethie, where are  you now?  You deserved as much success as Barney (and when they were small  my daughter and I liked Barney!) because your songs and dance routines are  much better.",946252800,,670,4.787610619469026
7833278,5,6302977150,This is a wonderful video for children.  Bethie uses lots of music and silly fun to help her friends learn about animals.  Your kids will have fun singing along with Bethie and all her pals!  Even I enjoy watching this  video with my kids!,911779200,,239,4.363636363636363
