8301319,4,B001F7UDKE,"The five-disc version does have the sticky book and the script, but the fifth disc is not made up of the special features from the regular-edition discs, as was stated by the previous review.. I bought my copy of this edition as a Target exclusive, and the fifth disc is a Q&A with the cast from the Office convention. The script is housed inside of the case as well. It's certainly not necessary, but is entertaining. The case is slightly wider than the standard one due to the extra case and script, however.",1259452800,3,510,4.494623655913978
8301320,1,B001F7UDKE,"You might think that the 5th ""Bonus Disc"" offers something new, but all they did was take the regular Season 4 collection, take all of the bonus material off the individual discs, and put it on a 5th disc - trying to make it seem like material you can only get here. Essentially you're paying 15 extra dollars for a sticky book and a script. Just buy the regular Season 4 Collection.",1238976000,28,383,4.333333333333333
