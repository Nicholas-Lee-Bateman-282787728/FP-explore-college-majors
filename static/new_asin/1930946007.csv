203021,4,1930946007,"Mr. Romano has created a seies of strange, quirky vignettes starring these bouncy talking heads that insult each other in variously accented voices -- 2D characters existing in a beautiful 3D environment.  Break out the beer  and munchies and have a ball watching this bizarre ""cartoon"".  This is one you won't forget five minutes after you stop watching, it'll  stay with you.",961113600,,377,5.032258064516129
203022,4,1930946007,"When I saw a preview of Mr. Romano's work with the dreamboy character on the web a couple of years ago, it struck me as the product of a reasonably bent perspective on life.  Enough so, in fact, that I was eager to see  where Romano would go in a longer format.  It takes a lot to get the  assignation of ""weird"" out of me, but ""Dreamboy and the  Clam"" is definitely all of that!
Technically brilliant, visually  unique, conceptually tweaked - ""Dreamboy and the Clam"" is a must  see for anyone like me, who is in love with the strange.  I'd like to know  if there is a support group to help me deconstruct this pearl.",961113600,,617,4.205128205128205
203023,4,1930946007,"I don't know what this guy is smoking (or dreaming) but when he writes it down and animates it, he comes up with some weird, freaky stuff.  Very funny.  Very bizarre.  Very surreal.  If you can't stand another episode of  bland-TV-animation (i.e. Pokemon meets Scrappy Doo), give  ""Dreamboy"" a chance and take a look at the future of animation...  well, the future of animation if you're kind of sick in the head.",961113600,,413,4.652777777777778
203024,4,1930946007,"This video artist is crying out for the safety and security that only our finest mental institutions can offer. When I wasn't worrying about his mental health, I was laughing my head off! This is a world of crazy,  vibrant color and broad cartoon strokes.  The characters are hilarious, and  reminded me of, yikes, people I know.  You'll see your friends here too, If  you've got the cajones to look. I recommend this video.",961113600,,424,4.675675675675675
7801435,5,1930946007,"He's depressed and funny...he's perfect!  I loved ""Dreamboy"" shorts from Spike & Mike's Animated Film Festival, but this longer episode of Dreamboy & The Clam is even better. The 3-D animation is just great.  The bathroom scene made me pee my pants.",987552000,,249,4.904761904761905
7801436,5,1930946007,"Just minutes after recieving DREAMBOY AND THE CLAM in the mail, I asked my wife to sit down with me and watch it. While eating our lunch, we were both captivated by not only the awe of the animation; but the ""probing sequence"". Yes, this one scene, (which probably took hours to make using Romano's special blend of something) caused my wife and I to laugh out loud. Then there was the bathroom scene. I won't give anything away; but your life would not be complete, until you see DREAMBOY AND THE CLAM.",972604800,2,503,4.419354838709677
7801437,5,1930946007,"Finally got my hands on my very own candy coated copy of D-Boy & Da' Clam.  Mad props to Mr. Boy.  Ferociously foolish, intensely infantile and packed with visuals that are nothing less than spectacular!  As for the  story, well let's just say the experience of taking a crap will never quite  be the same.
Don't let this millennia pass you by without getting a  gander at the most eclectic collection of characters this side of  cyberspace.
Not recommended for children over 80.",967248000,,479,4.698795180722891
7801438,5,1930946007,"It was like delinquently satisfying eye candy, with dynamic vibrance and great contrast in the color and lighting schemes as well as including the  element of unpredictability, something animation is not always known for.  And it was tastefully vulgar when necessary without being gratuitous about  it.  It made me slightly nervous, creating a feeling of comforting anxiety,  like drinkin' on the job or eatin' hot soup on a 100 day if you enjoy that  sort of thing, and who doesn't, right?",967075200,,490,4.987654320987654
7801439,4,1930946007,"'Dreamboy And The Clam' is disjointed modules of funniness, painstakingly rendered in bouncy 3D which defecates all over that 'Reboot' show. While  you'll find an extra level of humour to it if you've been exposed to  Romano's short-form work already, it also makes a great introduction to his  family of twisted characters. What 'Dreamboy And The Clam' lacks in  cutting-edge Disney visuals it more than makes up for by NOT being really  vacant, annoying and full of songs by Elton John and Tim Rice. Having been  conceptualised and realised principally by one man, this film will not be  all things to all people. But since you are only one person, you should  watch this. And then tell your TV executive uncle to pay Chris Romano to  make some more.",966384000,2,752,4.767441860465116
7801440,5,1930946007,"Excellent stuff and much more substantial than the MTV shorts for the Romano fans craving more Dreamboy sequences.  Dreamboy and his friends hang out at a stand-up club and watch the new Cyclops routine.  A cat-themed  stripper seems strangely evocative of a Mr Rogers Neighborhood fantasy, but  maybe that's just me.  Be sure to catch the cameo in the restaurant by  ""Grump"" and his girlfriend, stars of Romano's earlier effort  ""Trash Toons.""",963964800,,444,5.083333333333333
7801441,5,1930946007,"Dreamboy and the Clam? What next? More. Much more. As Producer of ""HomeMadeMovies!"", Christopher Dante Romano has been among our favorite submittors. Follow this man. Investigate his other works. Don't  stop now. You haven't seen anything yet. The future is what Chris makes of  us.",963187200,,282,5.2444444444444445
7801442,5,1930946007,"Welcome to the sideshow that is Deam Boy, wherein PacMan meets Satan in the Brundle-fly booth and decent folks are forced to ask, ""What in the name of God...! "" You'll writhe as you peer through parted fingers at  this moral car-accident, with content revolting enough to make a freight  train take a dirt road. I loved it.",961977600,,323,4.551724137931035
7801443,4,1930946007,"Animation festival favorite ""Dreamboy"" stars in this  bizarre series of vignettes loosely tied to his trip to a nightclub.  This CGI tour-de-force will leave you laughing, wincing, and scratching your  head.
Production values are first rate, especially the audio and music.  The plot is a little weak, but the creativity and just plain bizarre events  compensate nicely.
If you like 3D computer animation and can read books  by smart people and laugh at stuff like ""South Park"", you'll love  this.  It's definitely not for everyone, and certainly NOT FOR KIDS!",961372800,,560,5.144444444444445
7801444,4,1930946007,"""Dreamboy and the Clam""  is a crazy romp through a funny zoo of devilishly round characters that populate Dreamboy's world.
You'll love this unique ensemble. They are kookie, insecure, and unlike other popular  toons, these little fellows and gals have oodles of charm - enough to charm  the shell off any bivalve.
Sure the scene in the bridge of the spaceship,  and the whipping post in hell are a riot, but that scene in the men's room  stall - it's so funny it had me gasping for breath!
This stuff absolutely  should be a regularly scheduled tv series.
FOX where are you!
We want  more Klaus!",961200000,,596,4.566037735849057
