7399477,5,B014HFOANQ,"Wow...what a great collection to have. It just doesn't get much better than this. In addition to this DVD sold on Amazon, Walmart sells the entire ""audio"" live performance on double CD. To hear both of Skynyrd's early 70's albums ""Pronounced"" and ""Second Helping"" played live from start to finish was better than I had ever imagined. Johnny VanZant's vocals on this album is as good as I've ever heard them on a live recording. Gary Rossington plays ""lights out"" on all the tracks. The real highlight being his guitar work on ""Gimme Three Steps"". Ricky Medlocke is great as always. The whole band is tight and in good spirits. The sound and video quality is simply amazing. Definitely worth the purchase and a great addition to any Skynyrd collection. Hopefully the boys will someday follow this up with a  live version release of Nuthin Fancy,Gimme Back My Bullets and Street Survivors. Former band members that have passed on are not forgotten as the band references them during the concert and on the ""backstage"" clips. The fact we still have any incarnation of Lynyrd Skynyrd still touring and recording is amazing considering all the happenings and tragedies this Rock and Roll family has endured. God bless and long live the Lynyrd Skynyrd Band.",1445904000,21,1251,4.873239436619718

7399492,5,B014HFOANQ,"Lynyrd Skynyrd ""LIVE"" DVD from their intimate hometown Historic Florida Theatre in Jacksonville, FL for 2 nights in a row!  The most interesting thing about these shows were that the band went back to their roots and re-learned all the songs as they were originally written and played the exact track listing for each album.  Being a long-time fan and at both shows, it was awesome being able to re-live both epic nights.  There is bonus footage of ""behind the scenes"" with the band and more footage with attending die-hard fans.",1497398400,3,529,4.791208791208791

I got their first album in autumn of 1973, and everything from there on, not the same band now, but a very fine tribute, their first blu ray release, great sound and picture quality, their first and second album played live in one gig, as true as possible with this new line up, If one is not familiar with the band's history, you wouldn't notice all the band's changes,with only one original surviving member(Rosington, guitar) it's nostalgia, as far as I'm concerned.

7399609,5,B014HFOANQ,"The list of Skynyrd pickers in R & R heaven is a long one.  So.....what can one expect when the current line-up plays the band's first two classic albums live in their entirety?  You might be quite surprised!  First of all, the performances are pretty faithfully done with the group's three guitar attack on full display.  Peter Keys' keyboard work is great and at times you might even think you're listening to the late Billy Powell.  Gary Rossington's guitar sound really hasn't changed since these albums first arrived on store shelves in the early seventies and it really anchors these tracks.  Rickey Medlocke, the band's ""showman"" has been an integral part of the ""new"" Skynyrd since he re-joined the group in the mid-nineties.  His playing is hot and similar, but not identical to Allen Collins' pickin'.  Not bad for a guy who played drums in the band before these records were even originally recorded.  Johnny Van Zant  is a man who just seems to love his job.  Once in a while he flubs some lyrics, but he really would rather have fun out there, than to worry about being a perfectionist.  The band is full of characters and continues to be very Skynyrd-like in spite of the loss of so many players. My opinion?  This is a treat to be enjoyed by anyone who has loved these two recordings in their original studio versions.  I sought out the 1 DVD / 2 CD version and I'm glad I did.  These days, Gary Rossington ""is"" Lynyrd Skynyrd, but the rest of the musicians really love ""being"" Lynyrd Skynyrd and it shines through on this DVD. Secondly, you might get quite a bit of enjoyment from the interview section, the majority of which features Gary, Rickey and JVZ.  You'll also hear from the rest of the band and crew.  All told, this DVD is enjoyable and packed with good music.",1450051200,8,1787,4.569182389937107
7399610,4,B014HFOANQ,"Do yourself a favor and go to Wal-Mart and get their exclusive version. You get the 2 audio cds AND the dvd for $13.88. Man, I played the dvd tonight on a 55 inch big screen with Klipsch speakers and I closed my eyes and was transported back almost 40 years ago to Barton Coliseum in Little Rock, Arkansas. I saw the original lineup several times and had 2 tickets (at $7 a piece) to see them 2 shows away from the crash. The sound is awesome and the camera work is superb. They stay pretty true to the originals and Ricky Medlocke does Allen Collins almost as well as Allen Collins. Johnny sounds a lot like Ronnie, but without the 'Yeaaaow' that Ronnie used to do. This is good stuff.",1449532800,4,686,4.244274809160306

7399612,5,B014HFOANQ,"Difficult to say much more about the quality of the performance than a couple of the previous reviewers have referenced.  The performances are outstanding. Having stated that, this review is more in regard to the technical aspects of this DVD.  The good:  The DTS-HD Master Audio sounds fabulous on a quality system.  Beautifully done.  The video quality in the blu-ray version is outstanding.  The less than good:  This DVD suffers from the common issue with so many concert DVD's  -  too much camera shifting.  It's far better than most concert DVD's but not quite up to the standards by which I tend to reference concert DVD's. That said, this is easily in the top 10 of concert DVD's that I own and a great value.  Buy it.",1448668800,4,726,4.637795275590551

7399614,5,B014HFOANQ,"Some people complain about these guys playing as Lynyrd Skynyrd but as for me, a Skynyrd fan since early 1977 (thanks to buying the Second Helping album only months before the plane crash), I feel this line-up pays proper homage to both the integrity of the music and the legacy of the band.  With Ronnie and most of the original (and classic) line-up deceased, there is just no other way to let post '77 new fans (all fans unfortunately) experience these songs live these days.

I feel this line-up performs with more energy and emulates the original instrument parts/vocals for these two albums as good as any group of qualified musicians possibly could.  Since Ronnie, Allen, Bob, Leon, and Billy are gone,  I feel it is great to have these two classic albums played live, with modern video and sound recording, to document to fans -old and new- just how fantastic these songs are and to get a realistic feel of how the original line-up intended them to be played live ... Gary Rossington's current Skynyrd line-up delivers in my opinion.  Their performance and words on this DVD prove to me that they care that proper respect and care is given to the original line-up and how they played on these albums.  It would have been ideal if Ed King (the only remaining survivor from the original albums other than Gary Rossington) would have been invited to participate as his guitar playing and compositional skills are etched all over the Second Helping album in particular.

I recommend this CD / DVD to any Skynyrd fan ...period.",1448150400,22,1530,4.7293233082706765

 which is visible from their hand positions and then the DVD soundtrack is a half note flat throughout the performance.  (How do you do that ???)  I am a guitarist and know what fingering is visible as they play their songs.  Then attempting to play-along with the DVD, it is all a half step lower.  Free Bird was originally recorded in key of G and all other recordings are in G.  The DVD plays in Gb (F#) while you see them playing the chords corresponding to the G progression.  Gimme Three Steps was recorded in D, they are playing D chords, etc. and the soundtrack is in Db.  Otherwise, the concert is excellent.  OBTW - they did not ""tune-down"" their guitars as the keyboard is similarly visible playing on-key while the soundtrack is a half-note flat.",1520467200,,905,4.565217391304348
