3422608,2,B00194DFFS,"I was a little, actually very dissapointed in the video.  The quality was not good at all.  It is so poor it looks like the trees are almost a cartoon.  I have a good TV and DVD player so it is not my TV.  Also don't have this problem with other video's.  Also music is not good at all.

I got this video to help inspire me as I ride on my trainer since outside is not a good option with all of the snow and ice on the ground currently in New York.  I picked this one out of the series since it appeared to have lots of hills to push me a little.  Unfortunately it is just a car ride going at high speeds some times through the area.  In most videos that at least show somebody on a bike for part of the time.

The only reason I gave it two stars at all is if you just want a video to cycle to at a slow pace just relaxing it may be OK, but if you are looking for something to get your heart rate up this is not it.  If I could return it I would, but since I already opened it I will have to keep.  I was looking for something that gave more of a spin class type of a workout and this is not it.  The videos where bikes are in the film push you when you start to slack off a little.  As you see them start to pick up the pace you do it with them.

Don't believe the other reviews as they were written by people who got the DVD for free with a coupon from the company.  If you are a road biker and want to get in shape this is not good.  If you are an older person just wanting to ride the stationary bike at a slow pace then this is OK.",1294531200,5,1536,3.6625766871165646
3422609,3,B00194DFFS,"The idea is great and the scenes are good but the quality of resolution is like an old VCR recording. I thought maybe it was because my TV is too large and wide screen, so I tried it on a small computer screen. It looked the same. The red/orange color of the rock was quite off. Again I tried color and saturation adjustments but couldn't get it to look right. I will still use it, but the color and low resolution is bothersome to me. If that is ok with you then you will probably like the product.",1292371200,,499,4.1020408163265305
3422610,5,B00194DFFS,"If you're like me, its not always easy to keep up with working out during the busy week.  Bike-O-Vision DVD's are the perfect way to pass the time on your workout while having something interesting and beautiful to watch!  Zion National Park & Southern Utah are absolutely gorgeous regions, and I've driven through there numerous times.  I think these DVD's really do it justice, and I like how they tend to edit out passing cars (as much as possible) to really give you the feeling of biking solo through this majestic landscape.  Highly recommend!",1291852800,,549,4.808510638297872
3422611,5,B00194DFFS,These DVD's are wonderful. The scenery is fantastic and the music is well done.  I use them for riding my stationary bike and they make my workout 100% more enjoyable.,1288828800,,167,4.566666666666666
3422612,5,B00194DFFS,I enjoy this when I am stuck inside. I use this with the volume down and play my own music but he views are awesome.,1279497600,,116,3.68
3422613,4,B00194DFFS,I purchased this DVD for a Christmas present for my husband.  He uses a trainer in the basement during the winter.  He liked the DVD so well he order two more.,1263686400,,159,4.096774193548387
3422614,5,B00194DFFS,"Beautiful scenery and I get a great workout.  I play my own tunes because the classical music is a bit slow and is not as motivating for me.  There is no coaching but I am able to challenge myself so that is not an issue.  I have Bike-O-Vision's Grand Canyon/Sedona AZ, Zion Nat Park/So Utah & California Coast which are all over 74 minutes.  I am very happy with all the DVD's and would recommend them.",1241740800,4,403,4.2631578947368425
3422615,5,B00194DFFS,"Can't write enough about how wonderfully motivating it is to cycle to this DVD. I agree with all that was written by the first 2 reviewers.  The scenery is awesome and the way the DVD progresses is so well done that I lose all track of time while I'm spinning.  I like to use my own music while spinning.  Yet I listen to the music provided when I'm warming up and cooling down because it really compliments the beautiful landscape. This is one of my favorite DVDs in the series. All of the DVDs are fantastic in their unique ways.  I especially like spinning to this one as well as to the California Coast, Nevada, Grand Canyon & Sedona, Victoria, and Puerto Rico DVDs.",1231804800,7,670,4.379032258064516
3422616,5,B00194DFFS,"This is the first Bike-O-Vision DVD that I purchased, and it's definitely my favorite!  Zion's National Park and the surrounding area in Southern Utah has some of the most beautiful scenery on earth.  As a road cyclist, I bicycle commute and tour over 3000 miles per year.  For wet or wintery days, this DVD is an excellent indoor alternative to outdoor cycling.

WHAT REALLY WORKS:

The idea is to incorporate this video into a bicycle touring simulation, and make it as realistic as possible.  I play this DVD in a portable DVD player on my recumbent style stationary bike's book stand (so the screen is right in front of my face).  The closer you can get to the screen, the more realistic it will seem, and the easier it will be to get into the ""zone"".  Using this DVD, I am able to really focus on my workout and enjoy the scenery... just like a bike tour (whereas, when I worked out to a movie, I'd tend to get distracted and lose my intensity and technique).

WHAT DOESN'T WORK:

This video is NOT a movie!  Don't expect to pop in this DVD on a Saturday night, recline on the couch with a pizza, and be entertained.  YOU HAVE TO BE PEDALING (or walking/running on a treadmill).  But, it also doesn't work if you're pedaling with the video screen on the other side of the room.  YOU HAVE TO BE CLOSE TO THE SCREEN (or you need to have a very big screen).

ABOUT THE MUSIC:

Personally, I really like the music!  This DVD includes a great variety of instrumental style music.  However, others may prefer to work out to their own music.  If this is the case, just turn down the volume on the TV, and crank up whatever motivates your workout.  The value of this DVD far surpasses the selling price based on the video alone!

BAD WEATHER DAYS:

This DVD is an effective cure for the bad weather blues!  Until I discovered this DVD, I didn't have a good alternative to outdoor cycling.  Rainy days and winter days used to mean that I wouldn't really enjoy my workout.  Now, I honestly look forward to getting up early in the morning to bicycle tour through the red mountain cliffs and monuments of southern Utah.",1229040000,19,2112,4.423376623376623
8271837,5,B00194DFFS,This is the one I go to for my stationery bike ride in my living room.  I love it.  I play my own music and put it on mute. Not that crazy about their music but I love focusing on the road as if I'm really there riding my bike.  I love the scenery and the first one is 20 minutes. Perfect for when I started and I worked up to an hour.  It is very enjoyable.,1422662400,,358,3.6103896103896105
8271838,1,B00194DFFS,Horrible....just video from a camera mounted on a car and driven around.  Even shows footage when the car pulls over to let people pass.,1406851200,,136,4.666666666666667
8271839,5,B00194DFFS,"Again this is the ultimate virtual reality video for indoor exercise. I used these bike-o-vision videos during physical therapy and they kept me on that bike, so thanks!",1393459200,,169,5.071428571428571
8271840,2,B00194DFFS,"love this ride, wish there was a visible timer or something to let me plan my ride. Different sections were of different lengths, but until you do them all you don't know.  Music is great, but again, unless you know how to plan you can't profile the ride.",1392940800,,255,4.3125
8271841,1,B00194DFFS,Not what I expected. Simply shot from the front of the inside of a car. I wanted a workout (like the spinervals without looking at people).,1387929600,,139,4.384615384615385
8271842,3,B00194DFFS,"Nice color, clear scenery to much highway.  I wanted to scenery to actually take me away so that I would realize I was inside on a stationary bike.",1361836800,,147,4.25
8271843,3,B00194DFFS,There is a lot of footage here for the price. The soundtrack is not really my style but that is just preference. It lacks the interactive coaching that makers like Global Ride use. If you're looking for some good scenery while you strap on the headphones then this might be your ticket. All the filming is POV out the dash of a car which is not my favorite but it works.,1327017600,,370,4.225352112676056
8271844,5,B00194DFFS,"I loved this video so much I ordered the South Carolina and Amish Country Videos, also gorgeous. The music is well matched and keeps you on pace. These videos successfully replicate riding a bike through beautiful countryside. Pair these with the GelTech Eleven81 seat pad, also sold by Amazon.com,and you'll be in heaven.",1324598400,,322,5.09433962264151
8271845,4,B00194DFFS,"Bought this for my husband for xmas to watch while riding his bike during the winter inside the video was just ok but the scenery was nice, didn't use it as often as I thought he would even though he rode his bike alot during the winter inside.",1298851200,,244,4.104166666666667
8271846,4,B00194DFFS,This DVD delivers a collection of scenic views to entertain You while riding indoor on Your bike. And they deliver! I really enjoyed it. I would have given top grade if they were accompanied by an .erg-file like the Ergvideos for CompuTrainer or if they work like the interactive videos from RacerMateInc.,1297036800,,305,4.884615384615385
