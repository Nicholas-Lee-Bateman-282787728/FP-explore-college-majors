3677574,5,B001L2ZSG2,"This was actually a decent movie in most aspects of production EXCEPT the visual effects. The story is the usual story you would expect to see on a SciFi channel flick. The acting is was certainly decent and the photography was pretty good. The VFX....HORRIBLE. I'm embarassed for the Bulgarian VFX company that did the Ogre effects. If you can get past that (I actually anxiously waited for the next horrible vfx shot in anticipation of seeing crap) you find a decent popcorn flick.

I would suggest this flick to anyone that is a visual effects fan, since these effects are an EPIC FAIL. A few good laughs in between the decent movie plot points.",1264291200,,648,4.6347826086956525
3677575,3,B001L2ZSG2,"These 1-Star reviews are hilarious. What were these people expecting, ""Citizen Kane""? An award-winning film? Look at the dvd cover and the name of the film ""Ogre."" Why would anyone even waste their time on a flick like this if they didn't at least embrace them as guilty pleasures?

Directed by Steven Monroe and written by Chuck Reeves, 2008's ""Ogre"" is a low-budget tv monster flick in the manner of ""It Waits,"" ""Sasquatch Hunters"" and countless other Syfy movies. These films are the modern counterpart to the low-budget creature features of decades ago like ""Gargoyles"" (1972), ""Prophecy"" (1979) and the Kolchak: The Night Stalker films/tv series. You either enjoy these types of pictures or you don't. I do. As reviewer John Patrick Fischner so perfectly puts it: ""Imagination and legend is... about good and evil and the power of selfless courage against impossible odds. There is nothing more heroic than man against monster.""

THE PLOT: Four youths hike into rural Pennsylvania looking for a legendary lost town and are amazed when they actually find it. The town's inhabitants are still stuck in the 19th century and living in dread of a hideous creature to whom they must sacrifice one of their own once a year. Adventure and horror ensue.

Most viewers will note that the story is a mishmash of numerous other films like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Village-Widescreen-Vista-Series/dp/B00064LJVE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Village (Widescreen Vista Series)</a>,"" ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bay-Cove/dp/B0001WTV8Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bay Cove</a>"" (i.e. ""Bay Coven""), ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blair-Witch-Project/dp/B00001QGUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blair Witch Project</a>"" and various other monster-in-the-woods flicks.

Although this is essentially a serious story the film naturally pokes fun at the whole notion of an ogre. The youths take it as a joke and so do the cops; my wife and I cracked up numerous times and so will you. It's just really hard to hear or say the word 'ogre' without giggling. Be that as it may, the joke stops when the creature literally starts ripping people's heads, legs, and arms off. Of course, some people may continue laughing, but that's all part of the enjoyment.

""Ogre"" no doubt tried to capitalize on the surge in popularity of ogres with the success of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shrek-The-Whole-Story-Boxed-Set-Shrek-Shrek-2-Shrek-the-Third-Shrek-Forever-After/dp/B0046A9RMM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shrek: The Whole Story Boxed Set (Shrek / Shrek 2 / Shrek the Third / Shrek Forever After)</a>&nbsp;franchise. In fact, the beast in the film even resembles Shrek, albeit less cartooney and more malevolent-looking. Another comparison would be the cgi Hulk in Ang Lee's notorious 2003&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hulk-Widescreen-2-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B00005JKC3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hulk (Widescreen 2-Disc Special Edition)</a>; the ogre here sorta looks like that Hulk's homely brother, if you can imagine that. Interestingly, unlike other monster flicks you'll fully see the creature right from the get-go. Although this destroys suspense it didn't personally bother me (as I don't like it when films play out the same way all the time).

Believe it or not, John Schneider of Dukes of Hazzard fame is on hand as one of the main characters and he does a fine job. He also looks great for being nigh 50 years-old. I don't get why people poke fun at him being in the film. So he played Bo Duke, so what?

Other cast highlights include Chelan Simmons who plays one of the two female protagonists. Chelan is one of the cutest freckled blonds you'll ever gaze your eyes upon next to Juliana Dever of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sasquatch-Hunters/dp/B0007OCG6K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sasquatch Hunters</a>."" Chelan also starred in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chupacabra-Terror/dp/B0007V6IV2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chupacabra Terror</a>."" She has a very winsome disposition. Also on hand is Katharine Isabelle of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ginger-Snaps/dp/B000A2X3U2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ginger Snaps</a>"" fame. Both of these cuties have significant roles here.

Although the story takes place in Pennsylvania the film was shot in the sticks outside of Vancouver, BC. It's a good stand-in for PA except for one shot with a mountain in the background (the mountains of Pennsylvania are roundish ridges and look nothing like the mountains of the Great Northwest). Anyway, it's obvious the film was shot in the late Autumn; it has the cold/dreary Fall vibe throughout.

FINAL WORD: My wife and I had a fun time with this monster flick and so will you if it sounds like it'll trip your trigger.

3677576,4,B001L2ZSG2,"The Sci Fi Channel has taken it upon themselves to create the equivalent of the good old drive-in, Monster Of The Week event. Even though most of the viewers don't remember such things that is exactly what these flicks are. Cheep CGI has replaced cheep rubber suits or the rare Harryhausen spectacles. Now impossible monsters like the Ogre, Cyclops, and Basilisk are reviving the good old ""monster movie"".It's not about acting; that helps. It's not about plot. At least not original plots. It's all about 21st Century 91 minute comic books. ""Show me the Monster!!!! Bring on ithe impossible stuff!""
  Man against monster is the stuff of cave paintings. And that is why they are a guilty, or shameless pleasure and always have been ever since Edison first screened his version of Frankenstien in 1919.
  If you cann't have fun with this stuff, change the channel and keep your crabby attitude to yourself.
  Every Saturday when another one of these shows up, Forry Ackerman must smile down from some odd little spot in Heaven where plastic vampire fangs,black capes, scaley skin, and roaring dinosaurs are the norm.
  Imagination and legend is not about blood, gore, and sadists with sharp edges. Mythos is not about space ships. It's about good and evil and the power of selfless courage against impossible odds. There is nothing more heroic than man against monster.
  We all have to age. But if ""growing up"" means abandoning imagination and fun, day dreaming and creating, I totally refuse. As a life long sculptor, this has served me very well. Fun is mandatory.

3677577,1,B001L2ZSG2,"Ogre (Steven R. Monroe, 2008)

I often let reviews simmer in my head for anywhere from a few days to, well, we won't say how long it took me to get around to reviewing Edward Scissorhands after the last time I saw it. But there are some movies I feel the need to review as soon as I see them, because if I let them go too long, I'll have entirely forgotten the movie by the time I get around to writing the review. In the case of Ogre, Monroe (House of 9) has turned in yet another forgettable stinker that, candidly, I'm not sure why I finished watching.

The story concerns the town of Elmsford, which some unknown time ago (but we're talking hundreds of years) made a bargain with the title character (played only by some desperately bad CGI)--eternal life in exchange for the sacrifice of one villager per year. All is going relatively well, or as well as can be expected when your village's population is decreasing at the rate of one person per year (it seems all the villagers were rendered sterile in the deal), until a group of young-and-beautifuls searching down the urban legend of the Lost Town of Elmsford come calling. Or, well, some of them do. While they're hiking through the woods, Terry (Freddy vs. Jason's Kyle Labine), the guy who got them all out there in the first place, falls and breaks his ankle, so he and girlfriend Leah (The Stranger Beside Me's Kimberley Warnat, who, coincidentally, also had a bit part in Freddy vs. Jason) stay behind while Mike (Storm Cell's Ryan Kennedy) and his girlfriend Jess (Katharine Isabelle from the wonderful Ginger Snaps series of movies) head on to see if they can find a doctor in this legendary town. Well, they find the town, but the reception they get doesn't lead them to believe they'll be sending a doctor any time soon...

I couldn't find a way to work top-billed John Schneider into the synopsis. Yes, that John Schneider. He who was Bo Duke thirty years ago. From the top of the television world to, well, Ogre, a Sci-FI Channel Original Movie whose biggest draw is that Katharine Isabelle is just as gorgeous as she always is, and here may actually be rivaled by Chelan Simmons (from TV's Kyle XY) as the one townsperson who seems inclined to help the outsiders. (Simmons' beau, while I'm at it, is played by Brendan Fletcher--who also had a part in Freddy vs. Jason. Are you seeing a pattern here?) But what else is there to attract viewers? The special effects are embarrassing, the script is horrendous, the acting is competent in places but overall below average. There's really nothing at all to recommend this one; as with every Monroe movie I've had the misfortune to see, I have to say this one is something to avoid. *",1243814400,2,2700,4.562886597938144

Skip a century. On a trip to the woods Friends accidentily unleash the titular demon [My bad, Ogre] early from it's annual slumber before it can eat one of the town's sacrifices. The Ogre goes to kill the town. The two friends surviving escape but go back to help the town's people after trying to tell the average non-believing police played by Simon Longmore and Don Thompson.

Ogre has alot to say about obsession of power, how to feel courageous in times of fear, and some ideas about the thoughts of magic that would have been interesting if it had not been so straight-forward like it is for the simplifying of a TV film. It wants to be the Paths of Glory of Sy-fy Original Movies. But again, what's wrong with that line? Oh yeah, Sc-fy Original Movies. And with the great kills it could have been a fun monster movie if it were not for the CGI that can be noticed from the get go. These ideas all come together for a satisfying ending but before that we have to wait through horrible acting complementing horrible characters. John Schneider actually seems to be trying to give the subject matter but the rest of the cast [Starring Ryan Kennedy, Katharine Isabelle and Chelan Simmons] are very undisciplined.

3677618,3,B001L2ZSG2,"Syfy movies are tricky things.  They are usually made to capitalize on a trend, or to optimize searches on Google, or to confuse grandmas who are Christmas shopping for their grandchildren. It pays to be derivative, especially if the budget is relatively small, like so many Syfy movies are.

Once the original inspiration has faded, it's easy to forget why the movie was made in the first place.  Ogres have been long a part of folklore before they were associated with being green and disgusting. And there's the rub - Ogre was inspired by Shrek.

That's right, Shrek. As evidenced by its tagline: No Donkey. No Fairy Tale. Just TERROR.

I have to agree.  When I watched Shrek I kept thinking: You know what this movie needs?  An ogre that eats people. A plague.  And immortal 1800s-style Puritans who believe in magic.

You might think that a movie about a man-eating ogre would be set in a time when people believed in such things.  That's part of Ogre's charm - it utterly defies expectations because, hey, what has it got to lose?

Although this movie is superficially about a CGI ogre, the similarities between Shrek and Ogre end there. Other films might explore the same themes of timeless puritanical villages (The Village) and being lost in the woods in modern times (The Blair Witch Project), but Ogre has more high-minded fare in mind.  Its inspiration is Shirley Jackson's The Lottery.

Published in The New Yorker in 1948, The Lottery is about a town that follows a tradition long since abandoned by the civilized in keeping the crops fertile - whoever draws the short straw gets stoned to death.

And just like The Lottery, Ogre follows the travails of a Puritanical town that made a deal with the devil, pledging a sacrifice each year for eternal life. Unfortunately this is a modern tale, because every Syfy movie has to have a couple of meddling kids.  Said meddling kids muck everything up. They're so inconsequential to the story that they could have all died (and nearly all do) and Ogre would be no worse the wear.

Throughout Ogre winds a lot of talk without use of contractions, simple townsfolk dressed in plain garb, and the nagging question that a two hundred year-old magical town hasn't managed to evolve beyond flintlocks.  But then a giant fat guy with sharp teeth comes shuffling into view and all is forgiven - this is, after all, a movie about an ogre.

Just not the cute green kind.",1288051200,6,2417,4.7007125890736345

Like the title for my ""review"" says, how could I resist a Horror story centered around an OGRE - a HUGE ogre at that!?!?  I just can't.  Turned out that I really enjoyed this little stinker!  Yeah, I'm very surprised at myself - maybe it's because I knew what I was getting myself into.  You see, that's how you approach these films (haha).  Well, I won't go into detail about the film itself because others have already put their two cents in (haha).

What we have is a hidden-in-the-woods, cursed, 18 century town still ""surviving"" in modern times only because some warlock-like guy who happens to be ""pagan"" ""helped"" magically put a stop to a deadly plague and by this action, it caused the townspeople, along with him, to become immortal.  For this to happen, he would have to create a vile beast to put all the sins and illnesses into.  To please this now existing Ogre, the townspeople would have to sacrifice one of their own once a year.  The funniest thing about this film is that these people suddenly grow a guilty conscience and decide to stand up and fight finally in modern times (haha).  Long story short, 4 young campers/explorers come along and discover the mythical town and its problems.

Anywho, my only complaint is the CGI - it could of been better.  If its got to be CGI, than it has to be good!  I'm more into old school FX (its more organic & believable than most CGI close-ups), therefor, I'm a little stern when it comes to judging flicks that use mostly CGI.  I'd have given it a 4-star rating if the CGI was better and if they used some good 'ol animatronics!  There's some scenes where they could have used some of the practical FX, but maybe it's the case where there's little time and money.  Other than my one complaint, 'OGRE' is fun to watch!  I loved the design of the creature and its size is awesome when standing close to its next victim!  There's enough blood and gore to move the story along.  The acting is so so.  Don't expect to have any scene from this flick to make you jump with fright (haha).  Just enjoy it for what it is - a good 'ol creature flick!

This movie borrows heavily from other sources like The Lottery and The Village.  Its not very inventive.

The plot begs the question, who is the real monster, the ogre, or the pompous idiot who used dark powers to create the ogre.

The best part of this low-budget hack job is Katharine Isabelle (Ginger Snaps) as one of the hapless intruders to the doomed village.
The CGI monster is oddly designed with a HUGE roly-poly body and a teeny-tiny head.  Its more of a curiosity than something truly fearsome.  And it looks every bit the cartoon that it is.

8316981,3,B001L2ZSG2,"Getting quite old now, 'Ogre' is a 2007 Canadian made-for-TV movie.

A group of twenty-somethings go out in search of a mythical village which is supposedly located in the middle of nowhere. Of course, they manage to find it and stumble into a place held in time where the Ogre demands an annual sacrifice.

While done fairly well for a TV movie, unfortunately the story just isn't as interesting as it might have been. It is actually structured reasonable well (with shades of 'The Village' being seen in the idea of the lost town and the brave heroine trying to set right the years of wrong), but  it's all completely predictable and most of the characters just aren't that interesting. It's also a bit long at 97 minutes and would have benefited by an increase in the pace if 10 minutes had been cut out of the middle section which did tend to drag a bit.

For a 2007 production, the digital effects are passable with the Ogre being a big cartoon but better than you might expect.

At the end of the day, it's a bit much to be too hard on the production - this is a small budget film which does what it does competently. Just switch it on with your expectations suitably set.",1474675200,,1178,4.410138248847926
8316982,4,B001L2ZSG2,I actually liked this one.  Kind of fun to see John Schneider in a different role.  Don't expect too much; It was a bit off in places but overall entertaining for the price.,1465430400,,173,4.212121212121212

8316987,2,B001L2ZSG2,I don't understand most of these viewers! I found it unbelievable and ludicrous. It made no sense at all. However it DID hold my interest for a few quick moments but that's all. A tad funny a few scenes is why I even bothered giving it even 2 stars..,1446940800,,250,4.122448979591836
