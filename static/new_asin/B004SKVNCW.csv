4463957,5,B004SKVNCW,"Into the Cold is bone-chilling. The real life brutal and dramatic adventure of two men trekking on foot for 400 freezing miles over the course of two months while dragging 200 lb sleds is a tale (and film) even Hollywood could not make up, let alone capture in high def. The explorers (Sebastian Copeland and Keith Heger) face and document challenges that only few men would even considered facing. Frostbite. Low food availability. -50 degrees and a melting ice terrain that is nothing short of incredibly dangerous. THAT is the story line.

As for the filming, no movie set could ever do this justice. And likely, no Hollywood actors are going to go to the real place to get the job done. These men are in THE real place on THE very top of our planet capturing its incredible glory. It's stunning and beautiful and courageous, and it takes you somewhere you will never go....to The North Pole.

Envigorating to watch. Visually beautiful! Impossibly daring. Into the Cold is a story of unbelievable determination against incredible odds. And, if you have a big screen, all the better, because Into the Cold is even bigger than that.

One thing to note... I highly suggest you bring your coat, because Sebastian and Keith are taking you INTO THE COLD.

Absolutley recommended!",1358899200,6,1276,4.812785388127854
4463958,5,B004SKVNCW,"I caught this at the Arclight doc festival in LA and it was, for me, the pick of the festival. The photography alone is stunningly beautiful, but I think the reason it struck such a chord with me was the way that you become sucked into the story of Sebastian and Keith struggling through incredible difficulty, including the very real possibility of death, as they trek on foot to the North Pole. You're almost there with them, except you're incredibly thankful you're not in reality as it is no joke what they are going through. The melting ice at the pole is the message from Sebastian, but regardless of your feelings about climate change, this is a must see doc for anyone interested in arctic exploration and human will to survive and conquer. Highly Recommended.",1358208000,8,768,4.696296296296296
4463959,5,B004SKVNCW,"Into the Cold is a compelling documentary about a very important contemporary subject.
Sebastian Copeland and Keith Heger set off an expedition to commemorate the 100 year anniversary of Perry and Henson's treck to the North Pole and in the process teach us about the importance of polar ice caps.
The images are stunning and the message is unmistakably clear;  The polar ice caps are melting at an alarming rate and if we don't change the way we pollute our environments, our future generations are going to have a really tough time.
The photography makes a lasting impression, at times you actually feel that you are right there with them in the most inhospitable place on earth.
Mr. Copeland should be applauded for caring so much about the world that he is willing to risk  his life to bring this message to the everyone.
I encourage everybody to see this film.  It is visually amazing and covers a desperately important subject-matter.",1303689600,9,940,4.826086956521739
4463960,5,B004SKVNCW,"Into The Cold is a truly amazing film with a powerful message. The images of the North Pole are both stunning and eye-opening (and in HD!)  I highly recommend this film to anyone who is passionate about the environment and the outdoors, and I hope that everyone who watches it will share it with their friends and family. It is virtually impossible to watch this film and not feel inspired on a number of levels.",1301788800,14,412,4.493333333333333

8439949,5,B004SKVNCW,"""Sebastian Copeland's disappointing film about his trip to the North Pole on the anniversary of Perry and Henson's first trip there a hundred years before.

Visually stunning the film gives a good idea what its like to be alone on the ice. The visuals in this film are amazing and and are the reason the film should be seen.

The trouble is that the film is kind of a mess other wise. The film is very much a self love letter to Copeland with narration that is much too purple and self congratulatory. I came to despise the central figure of the film because its all about him.

How much is it about him? We get a good look at his life, but at the same time we learn almost nothing about Keith Heger who made the trip with Copeland. Sure he's there, but he's more a body than anything else, its all Copeland. The film also gives almost no background on the original trip of Perry and Henson. It was something that happened and other than a couple of pictures and an odd mention about how they had to walk back and were not helicoptered home (as Heger and Copeland were).

There is also way too much talk of climate change. Its clear that there is a problem, but Copeland the director drones on repeatedly about it at every opportunity so that it isn't long before we want to scream ""enough"". It would be fine if he had managed to work the subject into relevant parts of the narration, but he doesn't with the result it seems out of place. (actually it's like being hit over the head with a toaster).

However with all that is wrong with the narrative, there is the images. the images are amazing. The images are the films saving grace. If it wasn't for the spectacular images the film would be a major bust.""",1448236800,,1708,4.325

8439951,1,B004SKVNCW,"Ridiculous. The horrific, imminent doom-and-gloom melting of the Earths ice capswhich Al Gore predicted would disappear completely by 2013 are doing quite well, thank you very much.  Indeed, satellite images show the Arctic ice cap has grown and thickened 43-63% since 2012 (See University of Illinois's Cryosphere project).

The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) website still claims that the ice caps are the canary in the coal mine and harbinger of things to come for global warming climate change.  Back in 2009, global warming climate change soothsayer James Hansen of NASA warned the globe that President Obama only has four years to save the earth.  Of course, Hansens wild exaggerations and data manipulation have been debunked, but this doesnt stop the leftists, since we all know global warming climate change isn't really about climate at all, but about wealth redistribution.",1430611200,2,894,5.364285714285714
8439952,4,B004SKVNCW,"Into the Cold: A Journey of the Soul (2010 release; 87 min.) retells the preparation for, and then the actual attempt, to recreate the polar expedition of Admiral Keary and his team from 1909 exactly 100 years later. It basically involved a 6 week trek on foot, covering over 300 miles, towards the north pole. As the documentary opens, we are introduced to Sebastian Copeland, the writer-director-photographer-editor and all-around star of this movie. We learn a bit of his background and then things start to get serious with the final preparations of Sebastians and Keiths trek, which Sebastian calls the Mount Everest of polar expeditions, but as the DVD jacket cleverly points out: In the last century, fewer than 150 people have made it to the North Pole on foot. By comparison, 77 people summited Mt. Everest on May 22, 2008 alone, so its pretty clear which of the two is hardest. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, youll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, the initial 40 min. or so of the documentary are devoted to background stories and preparations for the expedition. So when we finally do get to the actual expedition, I was more than ready for it. Im happy to say it is very much worth it, and then some. We see Sebastian and Keith dealing with rubble fields, pressure ridges, fatigue, and the cold. Ah, yes, the cold! Temperatures exceed minus 50F at times, just unreal. Second, the footage from the North Pole is nothing short of stunning. And the beauty is that we get to see it in the comfort and warmth of our living room. Third, despite all the fluff about searching for myself or a souls journey, Copeland has a clear agenda for doing this, and the movie is basically a plea for a renewable and sustainable world. Last but not least, the documentary features a great soundtrack (courtesy of Didier Lockwood), and the occasional song (best of all: Canadas own Besnard Lakes epic Like The Ocean. Like The Innocent, which plays over the end titles). Somewhat surprisingly there are no bonus materials of any kind on the DVD (unless you want to call a 2 min. commercial for Copelands Antarctica: A Global Warning book a bonus feature, as the DVD jacket actually does).

I stumbled upon this movie while browsing the documentary section of my local library. So glad that I found this. For another recent documentary with even better jaw-dropping footage, I can instantly and readily suggest you check out Chasing Ice, dealing with glaciers in Greenland, Iceland and Alaska. Meanwhile, Into the Cold is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1426809600,2,2601,4.79064587973274
