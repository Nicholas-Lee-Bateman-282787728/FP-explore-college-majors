Strange Brew, Layla, After Midnight.  Here how they played then versus  now.

6672558,1,B00NMNYHSS,Un authorized.  I would bet the farm this is an unauthorized DVD of Eric Clapton.  Everything legitimate Clapton has ever done is of very high quality.  In the last few years there have been a few DVDs that are not authorized.  Why Amazon allows this trash to be on their site is beyond me.  Buyer beware,1420761600,,304,4.357142857142857
6672569,2,B00NMNYHSS,I wish there were better descriptions.  It seemed like it was an amatuer job,1420588800,,76,4.428571428571429
6672570,1,B00NMNYHSS,"Horrible. Obviously taken from other sources and poorly done. I've seen all these ""rare"" videos years ago in much better quality Much better video on YouTube for free!",1420329600,12,167,5.0

6672572,1,B00NMNYHSS,I picked up at the library today and didn't even go through the whole thing.  As others have said the video quality is very poor like they took a VHS tape and transferred it to DVD.  Really unwatchable.  It was interesting to see Clapton sporting a fro' from his Cream days though.,1419984000,15,281,4.365384615384615
6672573,3,B00NMNYHSS,I am a Clapton fan but this one leaves short on good stuff.,1419984000,,59,3.6153846153846154

6672575,1,B00NMNYHSS,"Shame on you Amazon! The quality of this DVD is appalling. We love Clapton and enjoyed hearing the music. Do not try to watch it, you'll get a headache. Would not recommend anyone buy it, much better quality Clapton out there",1419811200,2,225,4.512195121951219

6672577,5,B00NMNYHSS,"This video was a gift for my husband, a big Clapton fan.  He really enjoyed these scenes that had not been included in the previous videos we bought.

8679182,2,B00NMNYHSS,"I would give it one star if I had bought this DVD. The local Iibrary checked it out to me and after viewing found to be not worth the time.  Nothing best, rest, or rare here.",1458518400,,174,3.8333333333333335
8679183,5,B00NMNYHSS,"Poor album at best, could be why the title claims ""rare"". arrived quickly and intact. I should have researched.",1444089600,,111,4.894736842105263

8679188,1,B00NMNYHSS,"So, tell me: When someone tries to match audio and video from different songs, as happens here with Muddy Waters, is that going too far to make a buck? Most of this collection seems to be a shabby effort by someone splicing things together, with a camera in front of their VCR. The only ""rare"" stuff would be, in my opinion, some stuff from the 80's. Mark Knopfler is included on guitar, with Elton John guesting on one song. Neither does much of note. Maybe, if you're a real Claptonphile and feel a need to have absolutely EVERYTHING you can get by him, you might find this somewhat interesting. Otherwise, avoid it.",1428624000,2,618,4.526785714285714
