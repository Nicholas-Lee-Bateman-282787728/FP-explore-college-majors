7959882,2,B000063JZW,"Like a sucker, I read the description for No One Can Hear You and expected a really good thriller.  I got all my chores done, got a shower, and prepared myself for a quality movie.  I couldn't possibly BE more wrong.  The plotline about a murderer who invades homes and kills people had a LOT of potential.  Sounds really appealing, right?

Well apparently the message that *every single thing about it* is intended for kids should have been mentioned somewhere.  It's basically a Scooby Doo-like mystery.  The blood is nonexistent, the actual violence is extremely low budget and unsuspenseful with the actors and actresses barely touching each other and pretending they took a brutal hit, the storyline mystery surrounding the murders and the victims is especially intended for children or young teens because there's too much useless drama that does nothing to enhance the murder mystery, the search for clues is forced and unbelievable, and it's just a terrible movie overall.

Alright, to be fair, they mention things that are sort of inappropriate (such as one scene involving two teenage sisters sitting in a car and mentioning a man grabbing a womans chest) but let's be realistic- the description was completely misleading.  I expected something more interesting and adult-like and didn't get it at all.  If this aired on a family channel I'd understand, but it didn't.  Skip it like the plague.",1319414400,4,1404,5.008620689655173
7959883,4,B000063JZW,"Trish Burchall(Kelly McGillis,Witness)is a newswoman who begins to investigate a series of brutal murders in her town. As young women and their families are being slaughtered, she begins to uncover a serial killer whose twisted version of love brings the deadliest of intentions. The sheriff wants her to keep things quiet while he tries to crack the case, but what she discovers will put her and her daughters next on the killer's list.",1254268800,6,437,5.0
7959884,2,B000063JZW,"Kelly McGillis who was so radiant in ""Witness"" and ""Top Gun"" looks out of place in this well-crafted but ultimately frustrating movie.
What starts out as a fairly interesting, and rather puzzling who is doing it, culminates in an ending that is so out of kilter you wonder why the director allowed the screenwriter to force this ridiculous ending on an unsuspecting audience.  Just when you think the killer has been identified (and the killer admits he's the killer), a coda at the end suggests otherwise, WITHOUT any resolution.  Like leaving it open for a sequel?  Hardly, in this 2001 New Zealand film.
Overall, even though it holds your interest until the end, it's a cheap thrills movie.",1073520000,4,693,4.8559322033898304
7959885,3,B000063JZW,"I'd have to say, in all honesty, I saw this movie solely for Craig Parker. And though I wasn't expecting much, it turned out to be quite interesting.
**SPOILERS TO FOLLOW**
The story follows a series of murders in a small town, which focus on young teenage girls and their familes. All the murders take place in the same fashion, and all seem to relate to a murder that took place not far from there in the 70's. The twist at the end took me by surprise. With the way this mystery/thriller lays things out, you are left guessing who is responcible until the end.
I wouldn't recommend this to everyone. Its a bit 'hoaky' and the gore is rather fake. The characters are also dangerously unrealistic, but the thick plot that slowly unravels throughout will keep anyone intrigued. But be warned; this definately ISN'T an incredibly scary movie.",1070150400,4,840,4.644295302013423
