Second of all its too much talking. I had to fast foward half the movie because it got boring. The movie had only one good fighting sequence & that was the end fight. This combined with the acrobatic sequences makes this movie O.K.but thats about it.",1019260800,,408,4.1125
8194739,2,B000050ILH,"While boasting the full complement of Venoms, one of the few they all appear together, the story here is uninspiring and weak.  While I'm more than willing to overlook a weak plot if the action is compelling, such is not the case here.  The box art heralds that ""there is no shortage of action.""  Not only is there a shortage of action, there's a drought of action.  The movie drags along at a snail's pace for four-fifths of the movie, then culminates in an extended, longer than most, arguably tedious, final showdown, featuring clever acrobatics and only slightly better than average fighting.  This is clearly one of the weaker Venom flicks...BUT if you're an avid Venom fan, you still gotta get it, of course.",991008000,,714,4.725806451612903
