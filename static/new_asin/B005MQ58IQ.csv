8479603,5,B005MQ58IQ,"After the Towers fell..... ( 9/11 THE DAY AFTER )..... gives us heaps more knowledge. As this Is the TITLE of one of the discs in this three disc 10th anniversary commemoration set.  And it takes in the days, immediately following the fall of the Twin Towers. A very busy non stop Documentary, showing us so much more...Filmed close up. (  perhaps too close  )  but it does give the feeling that we are there too. With all the Fireman, the Volunteers, and People.  This is one of the best of all the 9/11 DVDs....Don't miss it.",1500076800,2,527,4.391752577319588
