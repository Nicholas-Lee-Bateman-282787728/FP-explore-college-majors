7344743,2,B012AN281S,"Jack (Robert Scott Howard) is a Vegas detective who is constantly telling us he hates his job. He has a reputation of being honest and hangs out at the private and exclusive  Red Herring lounge. A string of murders points to a businessman friend. Detective White is called in to work with Jack who wants to excuse himself from the case because he knows the suspects.

The acting was very stiff. G. Eric Miles who played Detective White was noticibly bad. The dialogue was bland as was the sound track. The whole film had a made-for-TV quality to it. Jack suffers from lame flashbacks. He sees a man in a mask and we don't know if that is the real killer or a symbol of an unknown killer. On occasion, Jack gives us some first person narration with a faux noir quality to it.

And yes with a title like RED HERRING one expects a major twist.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. Attempted rape.",1448150400,2,890,4.375757575757576
7344744,5,B012AN281S,"I really liked this movie. It was fun, had lots of twists, and looked amazing.  The actor who played the cop was cute and the guy who played the mob guy Roy was SUPER sexy. Who is he and where else can I see him??!!!  I want more of him.  MORE.
Sexy guys and a twisty plot are two must haves on my list for action movies. I also liked the music.",1447891200,3,345,3.763888888888889
