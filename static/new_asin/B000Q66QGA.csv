2831433,2,B000Q66QGA,"Edgar Allan Poe's own ""Fall of the House of Usher"" is classy 19th century gothic horror fiction. Updated and modernised, it does not really make quite the same impact. Hayley Cloake's film based loosely on the story is, well, downright cheesy, cheaply produced and lacking in finesse. Sexualising the tale, I suppose, could make some sense, but just how ""Jill"", the female visitor at the manor in this version, comes to perpetuate, in whatever way, the movie's incestuous Usher family line is not very clear. After all, she is not related to the incestuously inclined Usher family present-day and ancestral. On seeing Maddy (i.e., Madeline Usher), Rick Usher's supposedly dead and buried sister, at last, Maddy is all bloody at the groin, making one wonder if Maddy's twin children somehow have been excised from her womb, thanks to the wonders of sci-fi modern medicine, to be placed, again somehow, alive in Jill's uterus, unbeknownst to the recipient, but this is no more than guessing on my part. (If that had been the case, however, one would have to wonder why there is no evidence of it on Jill's person; she only feels the discomfort of early pregnancy.) Well, there are references to a ""surrogate"" (who else but Jill?) in the novel which Rick, a writer of pop mass-marketed fiction, is portrayed as writing, obviously based on what is happening at the House of Usher, so at least this seems to me to be a reasonable surmise. (Maybe something like Voodoo is the mechanism through which this could have been accomplished, if the twin babies' parentage really has to be Maddy as well as Rick; somehow, though, I sense that my supposition is falling apart!)  A film so sexually explicit as this one should have made that more clear.

There are some rather very low-tech sci-fi touches, especially that eerie tank in which Rick, Jill, and Maddy all immerse themselves, at various points in the movie, into its putatively healing and revivifying waters. The tank is illumined, but that is about all that Cloake and his crew did to make it look spooky. The same goes for all of the movie's effects, under-impressing the viewer, because they are done ""on the cheap"". The male lead, ""Rick"", is a pleasantly (but too blandly) good-looking and reasonably well-built lad, as one can see when he gets out of (or is taken out of) his rather foppish clothing, but he does not have the hulking and haunted look that should come naturally to actors who set out to portray Poe's Roderick.

The movie does not have a continuous feel to it. It just seems to be stuck together, moment-by-moment, scene by scene, with too little flow or tension in transitions. The background sounds, both music and effects, seems to be computer-generated and no more than minimally convincing sonically.

""Take a pass"" on this one; I bought it at a pawn shop for very little and I would not advise spending any more than I did ($1.50 Can. for the used copy, if I recall aright) to have it, if one really desires to satisfy one's curiosity about it. Maybe that money, if one is seeks Poe-based ""camp"", is better used towards buying David deCoteau's even cheesier, but entertaining, all-male (fetchingly well cast for laddish ""eye-candy"") gay ""take"" on Poe in that notorious director's film equally or even, obviously, more loosely based retelling of the fate of Poe's doomed Usher family.",1379980800,,3358,4.824652777777778

2831435,3,B000Q66QGA,"I've seen the ""Fall of the House of Usher"", which this is merely named after; there are a few 'similarities' (hyper-sensory). I had rented this movie a couple of years ago, and even though it's not with ((Vincent Price)), it's still a fairly good movie in it's own right.",1376697600,,271,4.551020408163265
2831436,1,B000Q66QGA,"I teach English (10th grade) and ordered this video for my students to watch in addition to reading the Edgar Allen Poe text and the viewing the original video version.  Bad idea.  The film was not very good and the story line did not keep me. I was unable to show the video to my students as it did have sexual content, but even without the sexual content the movie was not that good. Nice attempt, but I would not suggest for those who are Edgar Allen Poe fans.",1275955200,2,463,4.191011235955056

2831438,4,B000Q66QGA,"MY REVIEW:

THIS IS A GREAT GOTHIC DARK SEXY FILM. WHAT I MEAN BY SEXY IS NOT NUDITY BECAUSE THERE IS NONE IN THIS MOVIE. THIS FILM GOES BACK TO THE CLASSIC STYLE OF FILM MAKING THAT HAMMER HOUSE OF HORRORS KNEW SO WELL. MIX THE WONDERFUL DARK SHADOWS T.V. SHOW AND JUST ABOUT ANY HAMMER MOVIE AND YOU HAVE THIS WONDERFUL MODERN TALE OF EDGAR ALLEN POE'S THE HOUSE OF USHER.

I ENJOYED THIS MOVIE. THE ACTING WAS GREAT. THE STORYLINE, THE UPDATE IS PERFECT. THE SENSUAL SEXY DARK NATURE OF THE MOVIE IS PERFECT. THIS FILM IS FUN AND FILLED WITH A GREAT MYSTERY AND SUSPENSE TYPE OF FEEL. IT WORKS IN MANY WAYS AND IS PERFECT TO VIEW FOR FANS OF HORROR. FOR FANS OF DARK GOTHIC TYPE HORROR.

A WOMAN NAMED JILL IS CALLED BY RICK USHER TO BE TOLD HER BEST FRIEND MADDY HAS DIED THAT SHE HAS NOT SEEN IN THREE YEARS. RICK IS MADDY'S BROTHER. RICK AND JILL WHERE ONCE BOYFRIEND AND GIRLFRIEND BUT RICK AND MADDY PUSHED JILL AWAY THREE YEARS AGO. JILL RETURNS TO THE HUGE HOUSE IN THE WOODS TO WATCH HER BEST FRIEND BE BURIED. SHE IS ASKED TO STAY BY RICK USHER. THE HOUSE IS COLD, DARK AND FILLED WITH MYSTERY. THE MAID MRS. THATCHER (WHO IS PLAYED BY THE WONDERFUL TALENTED AMAZING BETH GRANT ) IS A MYSTERY IN HER SELF. SHE IS LIKE A BRICK WALL, NO EMOTIONS, DEEP AND DARK AND TO THE POINT.

THE MOVIE IS FILMED IN AWAY THAT IT DRAWS YOU IN AND PLACES YOU INSIDE THE HOUSE OF MYSTERY. INSIDE THE DARKNESS YOU WALK AS YOU LISTEN AND SEE THE STRANGE THINGS HAPPENING TO JILL. YOU BECOME APART OF THAT SEXUAL TENSION AND MYSTERY BETWEEN JILL AND RICK. YOU PLAY ALONG WITH THE COLD STARES OF MRS. THATCHER AND HER MEDDLING WAYS. THE FILM TAKES YOU INSIDE THAT CLASSIC GOTHIC REALITY THAT EDGAR ALLEN POE WOULD HAVE LIKED.
AS TIME GOES ON JILL STARTS TO REALIZE THAT WHAT SHE HAS BECOME INVOLVED IN IS A MASTER PLAN OF THE USHER'S. THIS MOVIE TAKES YOU ON A JOURNEY INTO A DARK ATMOSPHERE OF LUST, LOVE, PASSION AND A SENSE OF PURE DARKNESS MIXED WITH AN UNEXPLAINABLE EVIL. THIS MOVIE HAS YOU GUESSING UNTIL THE END AND ONCE THE TRUTH COMES OUT THE MOVIE IS JUST BROUGHT TOGETHER WITH MORE FANTASTIC DEEP DARK GOTHIC HORROR. [...] com/",1216598400,8,2129,4.262376237623762
2831439,1,B000Q66QGA,"Edgar Allen Poe is a very creative and masterful story teller, so take my advice when I say just read his work on this one. I was flipping through the movie channels one night and came upon this, and with Edgar involved I decided to give it a chance. It's one of those movies that you are asking yourself the whole time, why am I watching it? Being a huge fan of low budget horror films, I was kind of exciting to see what this had to offer. The answer is nothing. House Of Usher was very boring and unnecessary to make with Edgar Allen Poe as the involvement around the whole thing. As great as he is, he should never be degraded so badly.

 Jill recieves a phone call one day stating that her best friend Maddy Usher that disappeared from her life with no explanation three years prior has died. Not really wanting to go back Jill decides because it was Maddy's last wish to attend her funeral. At the funeral Jill sees Maddy's brother Rick, who she had a relationship with three years ago, he also disappeared with no explanation. After agruing with him about the reasoning behind their disappearance she finds out they both had nerve diseases and didn't want to put her through the pain of seeing them like that. She forgives him and starts to rekindle their old relationship. She has no idea what family secrets are hidden in The House Of Usher.

 The storyline was the only thing that was enjoyable, which is because of course Edgar Allen Poe. I am actually very disappointed to have watched something this bad with his name anywhere near it. As I said before just stick with reading the story.",1215993600,14,1600,4.450511945392491
2831440,1,B000Q66QGA,"This is one of the most pathetic movies I have ever been forced to watch. Horrible acting, stunted editing, weak cinematography, weak plot. Don't bother watching, read the short story by Edgar Allen Poe; it takes up less of your time and is, unlike this movie, masterfully written.",1208476800,3,281,4.875
2831441,5,B000Q66QGA,Don't understand why this movie only has two reviews? This movie is extremely interesting and suspenseful. The cinematography and the acting was great. A must have for the movie collector that is looking for the unknown and a original plot. Has a very dark overtone and haunting feel along with a beautiful lead.,1194912000,7,312,4.90566037735849
2831442,5,B000Q66QGA,"I am into this movie!  I have seen lots of Edgar Allan Poe movies, including about a billion-and-a-half different remakes of ""House of Usher"".  Poe is kind of my thing.  This one is DEFINATELY watchable, though I think it should have had Johnny Depp in the Roderick part instead of Austin Nichols.  The really hot (OUCH!!!) newcomer is Ann Howland as Edith.  Perfect!  When will we see her again?  Izabella Miko is always great (Bye Bye Blackbird will become a classic, I'm sure) but when you see her face to face with Edith (Howland) you know who is has the top star quality.  Just that ""something"".",1189382400,9,600,4.59433962264151
8194384,2,B000Q66QGA,This was... an interesting take on Poe's story. It is modernized and the narrator is a woman for the purpose of a relationship between Roderick and the narrator. The ending is not quite like Poe's story and there is uncertainty about the exact relationships of all the characters. The video editing is... below average and quite comedic at times.,1490054400,,346,4.88135593220339
8194385,5,B000Q66QGA,"this movie was very thrilling & suspenseful. the caretakers had just the right amount of creepiness to keep you spellbound. another great by Edgar Allan Poe, just as creatively alluring as the Raven.  twists & turns to keep you guessing & wondering what is next.  i really enjoyed this movie & i would recommend it to anyone that enjoys intense thrillers.",1482710400,,355,4.80327868852459

8194390,4,B000Q66QGA,"I liked this version as an updated version to the classic story.  Of course it isn't exactly true to EAP, but it gave me chills.  When I listened to
the audio comments and learned how there was no budget for this movie and everyone came together anyway-that made me love it even
more.  I respect it for that!  I have watched horrible actors before and these are good actors!  Well, maybe not the friend back at the bar in
town, she sounds staccato.  Beth Grant is an incredible actress.  The houses used are lovely and often I rent a movie just to see that aspect.
The fact that they have one of EAP's descendants at the funeral scene-OMG!!!  Of course the Roger Corman productions are well-known and
I love VP in those, but they are very cheesy!  This movie at least uses real houses to film and not cheesy sets.",1437868800,,813,4.366666666666666

8194393,5,B000Q66QGA,"I have been looking for this film for about 4  years . I liked it so much. Its strange and thrilling and a little ""WTF"". But I loved that and it has Austin Nichols so I liked it even more the plot is interesting .But I will say this version isn't for everyone.
It is not big budget so don't go wanting all that cash and flare its simpler but just a nice rainy day film if your into the strange.",1419292800,2,394,3.8641975308641974
