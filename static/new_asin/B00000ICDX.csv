1222396,3,B00000ICDX,"Before this match started they quickly took the camera to the back and they showed Goldberg on the ground hurting,holding his leg. He said get out and threw a chair at the camera. Then match 1 started.

Match 1

Mike Enos vs. Chris Benoit

This match was a pretty boring match. The crowd wasn't that in to it. During most of the match the announcers would rather have talked about Goldberg and the nWo rather than call the match.

Benoit sold alot of moves to Enos. Enos executed a real nice tilt a whirl backbreaker at one point. This match was very drawn out for the simple reason of taking up ppv space. Benoit ended up winning with the crippler cross face.

Winner: Chris Benoit

Before match 2 started they showed highlights of what led to the Hall/Goldberg match later in the card.

Match 2

Norman Smiley vs Chavo Guerrero

Norman came out carrying a small red urn. Its obvious what was in it. At one point Tony referred to what was inside the urn as ashes but quickly corrected himself. Chavo came to the ring mad as hell and ran Smiley out of the ring before the bell rung. Chavo hits a crossbody to the outside on Smiley. Then he followed that up with a springboard into a bulldog from the top turnbuckle on Smiley. Smiley started mounting a comeback and hinted the ""wiggle"" to the crowd but later changed his mind and said he would do it later. Smiley used a few submission moves for the next few minutes and Chavo came back for a brief moment then Smiley put him back on the mat again for more submission holds. Smiley hits a superplex from the middle turnbuckle and both men are out but Smiley quickly gets up and dances. Smiley ended up getting Chavo in somewhat of a doggy style position and preceded to smack his ass. Tony refused to make any comments about that move. Smiley ends up hitting Chavo in the face with the urn and Smiley locked on the chicken wing and get the submission win.

Winner: Norman Smiley

Before match 3 started they went to the internet insiders location where Mark Madden had Konnan as his guest answering questions. Konnan talked about the nWo.

Match 3

Fit Finlay vs Van Hammer

This again, was another boring match. The fans weren't into it at all. The crowd showed no emotion what so ever. Finlay ended up winning with a tombstone piledriver.

Winner: Fit Finlay

Before match 4 started they showed highlights of the events that led to tonights match between David and Ric flair against Windham and Hennig.

Match 4

Wrath vs BamBam Bigelow

Wrath sends Bigelow out of the ring early. The rest of the match both men took quick turns in having the momentum on their side. At one point both men hit a lariat on each other at the same time and knocked each other out briefly. Bigelow gained the upper hand toward the end of the match when he shoved Wrath into the corner and Wrath hit his head on the post. Bigelow then hit Greetings from Ashbury Park and got the win.

Winner: BamBam Bigelow

Match 5

Konnan vs Lex Luger

Before the bell rung Konnan got on the mic and did his stuff and told Lex he could toss his salad. Luger gets on the mic and says Konnan can take it the easy way by walking out or getting his brains beat out. Konnan attacks Lex before he is finished on the mic and the match starts.

The first few minutes Konnan is all over Lex and lex ends up leaving the ring and Konnan goes out and attacks him and they end back up in the ring with Konnan still in control. Luger's first offensive move is a defensive move and it pays off as Lex takes control over the match. Lex starts to focus on the lower-back area of Konnan. Konnan makes a comeback and hits the rolling clothesline and then dropkicks Lex in the face. Crowd starts to erupt and Liz walks out and at the same time Konnan had Lex in the Tequilla Sunrise Liz sprayed Konnan in the face with black spray paint and Luger got up and applied the torture rack for the win.

Winner:Lex Luger

Match 6

Chris Jericho vs Perry Saturn 'Dress Match'

At the beginning of the match Tony made sure to point out that the ref was Scott Dickinson. Ralphus carried a bag to the ring which had the dress in it. Saturn hits a springboard into a leg drop at one point. Dickinson seems to be calling it down the middle so far. Jericho hits a missile drop kicks which sends Saturn to the outside. Saturn comes back when he catches Jericho out of the corner with a t-bone suplex. Saturn hit a real nice splash from the top but only got a 2 count. Jericho rolls up Saturn into a small package and Dickinson makes a very fast 3 count and Jericho gets the win. Saturn ends up putting on the dress and Dickinson and Jericho have a good laugh.

Winner:Chris Jericho

Before match 7 started they went back to the internet insiders location and David Flair was the guest this time. David talked about the upcoming match.

Match 7

Kidman vs Juventud Guerrera vs Psychosis vs Rey Mysterio Jr 'Four Corners Match'

This match was too fast to call but here are some of the highspots during the match:

Rey with a flying head scissors on Kidman.

Rey and Kidman collide in mid air when both attempted cross bodies.

Kidman and Rey seem to be working as a tag team early in the match.

Winner: Billy Kidman

Before match 8 started they went back to the internet insiders again. This time Bokker T was the guest but Chris jericho interupted. Jericho was calling BookerT ""Mister T"". Booker said that Jericho's match was tainted. They both made a challenge to each other to fight tomorrow night on Nitro.

Match 8

Barry Windham and Curt Hennig vs Ric and David Flair

Arn escorted David and Ric to ringside and stayed for the match. Before the bell rung David and Ric rushed the ring and Curt and Barry ended up running out. Flair got on the mic and called Windham and Hennig Horsemen rejects. Hennig got on the mic and said he was gonna whip David's little ass. Flair got back on the mic and at one point he said they could go work in the WWF. Bell finally rang and David insisted that he start off the match. David got in a couple of moves on Windham and eventually tagged in Ric. Ric comes in and starts cleaning house till Windham got a shot in on the eye of Ric and tagged in Hennig but Flair quickly came back with chops and sent Hennig to the mat but Hennig regained the edge again rather quick and even knocked David off the ring apron with a cheap shot. Hennig and Windham start making quick tags to each other and double teaming Flair. Early in the match Tony starts making comments about David making no attempt to come in and help his father and they blame it on his inexperience. Arn ends up getting involved in the match by attacking Hennig but Hennig regains control over Anderson with a double axe handle blow to the back of the neck of Anderson. David comes in and racks Hennig but he ends up paying for it as Hennig beats the tar out of david. This promts Anderson to bring his tire iron in and hit Hennig with it. Hennig falls out and David makes the pin.

After the match the whole nWo comes out along with the Horsemen but there are way too many nWo members. The nWo handcuff Flair to the ring and start beating up on David Flair. Hogan beats David with his belt. Hogan spray paints EZE on David's back. This was one of the most cowardly things the nWo has ever done by making Flair watch as they beat up his son. Flair was very emotional after the match when they let David go.

Winner: David and Ric Flair

Match 9

Scott Hall vs Bill Goldberg

This is a ladder match with a stun gun hanging from the top. The first man to get the gun and zap his opponent wins.

Before the match started Hall got on the mic and said he had some good and bad news. The good news was that everyone gets a chance to see him. The bad news is the former champ-Goldberg, wet his pants, slipped in it and hurt his knee. He says there won't be no match tonight and tells the ref to raise his hand. Then Goldbergs music hits the loudspeakers and Buffer apologizes to everyone for Hall's announcement.

The match finally begins and Hall teases Goldberg alot with his smart ass remarks and gestures but every time they lock up Goldberg gets the advantage. Early in the match Goldberg is showing signs of his knee hurting. Hall notices it and then begins the attack on Goldberg's knee.

Annoncers made it a point to tell us several times in the night that Hall has experience in a ladder match but they never mention where from but yet they can talk bad about Foley a couple of weeks ago.

Other highlights:

Goldberg is bleeding from the forehead.

Hall hits a elbow from the top of the ladder.

Goldberg picks back up the gun and shocks Hall for the win.

Bigelow comes out and beats up Goldberg.

Hall grabs the zapper and shocks both Goldberg and Bigelow.

1222397,1,B00000ICDX,"If you ever wanted to see the most shxtty wresting event of all time, look no further than this. With the exception of the World Heavyweight title match, and the hardcore title match, every match is bad. Where was the Luchadores? Where was Bret Hart? Hell, where was that musclehead Goldberg? Even Benoit finally winning the world title cannot help a very shxtty pay-per-view. Thankfully, someone taped it for me, and I didn't buy it.",1068508800,,434,4.8
1222398,4,B00000ICDX,"This is the video that really put the nail in the WCW coffin, Beniot finally gets the strap as WCW tries to presuade him to stay, it didn't work and WCW floundered to Vince in little under a year see the last performances of the Radicalz here, worth it.",1009584000,,253,4.183673469387755
1222399,4,B00000ICDX,"The Undercard was a little better than usual. Two matches stood
out and they were the 4 Corner cruiserweight title and the Smiley/Chavo ones. Goldberg and Hall had a very good ladder match as well.",999129600,,197,4.6571428571428575
1222400,4,B00000ICDX,Some of the matches were kept short thankfully but the main event was worth it. It was rewarding to finally see Benoit rewarded for all the years he's been in WCW.Him and Sid had a classic for the world title.,998352000,,209,4.25
1222401,3,B00000ICDX,"For starters, choosing to start any ppv with Chris Benoit is excellent thinking, however, when the opponent is a jpurneyman with no belt, no gimmic, and no future with WCW, then even Benoit couldn't carry this stinker. I know Kevin Sullivan was particularly fickle with Benoit, but why screw your company by having him face Mike Enos, who is better known for his lame WWF tag career as a member of the Beverly Brothers? The crowd did react well to the match, and particularly well to second match, featuring Norman Smiley and Chavo Jr. The match was good and their styles meshed well, given Chavo's lame ""PePe"" gimmick. The battle of undefeated WCW super heavyweights was next, featuring Bam Bam Bigelow and Wrath. This was a good King Kong versus Godzilla style matchup. This match was supposed to build up Bigelow's character for a feud with Goldberg, but in typical WCW fashion this storyline got lost in the shuffle. With the rival NWO factions joining together, Konan was given his pink card. This set up a gruge match involving Lex Luger and Konan. This match started well, with both stars getting their turns on the mic to get heat with the crowd. Once the talking stopped, the brawling began, with a newly silicon enhanced Ms. Elizabeth aiding in the outcome. Excellent brawl, with lots of pops. The next bout featured a soon to be WWF bound Y2J versus Saturn in a dress stipulations match. Jericho was supposed to lose this one, but flake that he is, Saturn chose to lose, figuring it would get him over with the fans. The match itself was excellent, with many near falls and Jericho's silly antics. Next up was the cruiserweight four way title dance. This was the only title match and it featured LWO members Psichosis and Juvi, in addition to Rey Mysterio, and the champ Billy Kidman. This is the best match on the tape. I wish WCW had the forsight to have made this a tlc style gimmick match. The next match consisted of NWO sympathizers Curt Hennig and Barry Windahm, vs. the father and son team of Ric and David Flair. The three vets were great, but David Flair looked lost. This match had the crowd jacked. The roof really blew, when both NWO factions arrived and made a helpless Ric Flair watch as they beat his son senseless. Excellent face/heel work by Flair and Hogan. The main event was the Scot Hall and Goldberg taser gun/ladder match. Prior to the show, Goldberg was assaulted and suffered a knee injury. Goldberg played up the injury angle to perfection. This match was very physical, with both wrestlers taking dangerous bumps. Goldberg was busted open in this match. Run ins took place with Bam Bam and Disqo. All combatents felt the wrath of the taser. This was definately match of the year material. It was a good ppv, but not for the price asked.",996019200,2,2775,4.642276422764228

1222403,3,B00000ICDX,"Souled Out was Benoit's nite to shine, what WCW could have had in Benoit if they had not let him go.  Injuries to Bret Hart and Jarrett hurt the PPV, but they managed to put on a decent show in their absences.  Benoit/Sid turned out to be an excellent contest.  The program had 12 matches, and the downside there is you have several short matches(although some of those you are glad they were short, less painful).  DDP/Bagwell match was too short for a last man standing match.  I thought Kidman performed well in the 3 matches.  Nash vs Funk laid an egg.",972691200,,556,4.401960784313726
1222404,1,B00000ICDX,"I can forgive ppv's and wrestling shows with a few lame matches, as long as they have other matches that make up for it. This one had the bad matches... and that's it. The lucha match was ok but not as good as the  three way at starcade of 98. And the Goldberg x Hall ladder match. There  were only two cool bumps in that match, one was an elbow drop almost from  the top by Scott, and the other was when Goldberg hit his head on the rope  as he fell with the ladder, it looked liked he couldv'e seriously hurt his  neck but got lucky. COME ON! The best slam of the night was a flub, an  accident... boring tape don't get it.",946425600,,625,3.96

7910577,1,B00000ICDX,"The one thing I can say about Souled Out 2000 is that it's not as bad as SuperBrawl, which was an excruciatingly lame mega-card with zero memorable matches. Souled Out fairs a smidgen better if only because it had a few half-decent matches on it. The event opens with almost ten minutes of damage control as the card had to be radically altered since Bret Hart and Jeff Jarrett were both injured before the show.

What really brings this show down is that the bad matches aren't just bad; they're abominable. The shoot fight is a sink-hole of time and the Nash/Funk match is a totally worthless beat down of a true legend. Another glaring problem is the Kidman/Malenko opener that is cut short because NOBODY was sure of the rules!

On the bright side, Saturn and Kidman had an okay match and Vampiro vs. Crowbar vs. David Flair was tolerable for the time given. The only really good match was the main event between Sid and Chris Benoit, which greatly surpassed their previous match the year before. It wasn't a classic, but it got the job done. Unfortunately, the events of the next night made the match pointless, and the whole company was embarrassed.

Overall, the night alternates between forgettable and painful until a solid main event that would be recanted within 24 hours, so there really is no point in seeing it. But, If you like train wrecks...",1407024000,,1358,4.65
7910578,3,B00000ICDX,"The Catch-as-Catch Can match between Billy Kidman & Dean Malenko was so-so at best. The Vampiro-David Flair-Crowbar-Triple Threat match was pretty much a handicap match but the action itself was pretty good and the same goes for The tag team match between Johnny the Bull & Big Vito against The Harris Brothers(Ron & Don). The Oklahoma-Madusa-Crusierweight title match was a pointless dud. The Fatal Four-Way match for the Hardcore title(Brain Knobbs vs Fit Finlay vs Meng vs Norman Smiley) was a weapons-heavy brawl but a good brawl to say the least. The Bunkhouse Brawl between Perry Saturn & Billy Kidman was pretty good and everything was crisp. The Booker T-Stevie Ray match started off okay but then fell apart as the bout went even though Booker was trying his best. The Tank Abbot-Jerry Flynn match was a short dud. The Last Man Standing match between ""Diamond"" Dallas Page & Buff Bagwell started off as a good Attitude-era brawl but went downhill in the end. The Steel Cage match between Billy Kidman & The Wall was a pretty good David-and-Goliath battle but this time:Goliath won. The Hardcore match between Kevin Nash & Terry Funk was fun compare to most of the card but still pretty bad. The World Heavyweight title match between Chris Benoit & Sid Vicious was not great but pretty good and one of WCW's better main events compare to the main events yet to come.

The real duds are Benoit/Enos, Luger/Konnan, and Bam Bam/Wrath. The good and alright matches include Flair/Henning tag, smiley/chavo, Saturn/Jericho, four corners, and Ladder match (hall carried goldberg).

7910583,3,B00000ICDX,"This PPV is in the last few years of WCW's existance and the cracks are really starting to appear here. This PPV was in the same month as WWE's Royal Rumble 2000 and the comparisons between matches and storylines are huge with WWE having a huge edge.

Billy Kidman vs. Dean Malenko - I was expecting a brilliant match between these two but it is ended in 3 minutes by a stupid stipulation i don't think the wrestlers understood. This was very poor to start off a PPV. 2/10

David Flair vs. Crowbar vs. Vampiro - This was really a handicap match and was an ok effort from all involved. David Flair is in decent form and puts on a good fight with Vampiro. 6/10

The Harris Boys vs. Big Vito and Johnny The Bull - What a bore fest this match just seems to carry on forever and you seem to fast forward near the end. Poor tag team match which was not enjoyable just a torture to watch. 1/10

Cruiserweight Title

Oklahoma (c) vs. Madusa - Why these two are wrestling for the title i do not know. Never can wrestle at all and this match is just full of sloppy moves, big decline in cruiserweight title which used to guarantee a good match. 2/10

Hardcore Title

Brian Knobs (c) vs. Norman Smiley vs. Fit Finlay vs. Meng - A good enough hardcore title match with lots of weapons involved and lots of brawling even if Meng doesnt get hurt by ANYTHING! 5/10

Billy Kidman vs. Perry Saturn - This is much better than Kidmans first match and these two put on one of the better matches of the night, Kidman takes alot of good bumps. 7/10

Booker T vs. Stevie Ray - Bad match! This is not Booker T's fault who tries hard with Stevie Ray, the match is bad enough but the run in at the end just makes the match worse. 3/10

Tank Abbot vs. Jerry Flynn - Not even a match just boxing. It seems like your 3 seconds into this brawl before Flynn gets knocked out by a punch! 0/10

Last Man Standing

Buff Bagwell vs. DDP - Better match one of best on card with lots of fighting around the arena and both putting in a good effort, one of Buff's better matches in WCW. 7.5/10

Caged Heat (Really Just a Hell In A Cell)

Billy Kidman vs. The Wall - What a waste, Kidman had already been though two other matches so was never going to be in top form. Also why have a caged heat match? they might as well of had a normal match, doe not live up to expectations. Looking at the hell in a cell match one month later in WWE this is extremley poor bad booking. 2/10 (For Kidmans effort through 3 matches should really be 0)

Hardcore Match (Nash wins becomes commissioner of WCW, if Funk wins nWo disband.)

Kevin Nash vs. Terry Funk - Second best match of night and were night begins to pick up. Funk takes some nasty powerbombs and gets busted open by chair shots, shame crowd was super sucking up to Nash during his power hungry days and booing Funks brilliant effort. 8/10

WCW Heavyweight Title (For vacant title)

Chris Benoit vs. Sid Vicious - Best match of night and Benoits last in WCW. Good technical match with a few silly mishaps at ropes which sort of spoils ending. Even Benoit knew WCW was sinking and after winning the title left for the WWE the next week. 8.5/10

Not really a good PPV worth money if you see in bargain bin. Watch for really the last two matches and to see Benoits last match in WCW.",1124064000,,3288,4.223642172523961
