7902775,4,B000003KAR,"I always wanted to pick this one up.  A time ship arrives and starts blasting at Voyager.  Why?  Because in some future time, Voyager will cause the destruction of the Solar System.  Janeway fights back, doesn't buy it, but gets sucked into a 'temporal anomaly' and there's our adventure.

Tom Paris, romantic and Bond-like.  The time ship captain stuck on Earth for 30 years -- not only is he a homeless person, he had to relive the Disco craze!!

The holo emitter and other such gadgets are introduced here as well as the realization that this incident started the microcomputer evolution -- oh my.

This VHS tape does not come across well with HDTV screens -- time for a DVD upgrade, I'm afraid.

Better:

7902776,4,B000003KAR,"There is a recap of Part I of ""Future's End"" at the start of ""Star Trek: Voyager,"" Episode 51, ""Future's End Part II"" (Written by Brannon Braga & Joe Menosky, Aired: November 13, 1996), but it is really hard to try and summarize everything that happened.  Fortunately there is no reason for anybody to watch Part II without watching Part I.  Suffice it to say that the ""Voyager"" crew is back in the 20th-century where computer mogul Henry Starling (Ed Begley, Jr.) has come into possession of a timeship from the future future (in other words from the 29th century, which is the future for the ""Voyager"" crew as well).  This will make billions for Starling and, incidentally, destroy the time line and life as we know it in the Star Trek universe.
Starling has also downloaded the EMH into his computer and has provided the Doctor (Robert Picardo) with a 29th-century portable holo-emitter that allows him to appear in places not equipped with holographic emitters.  Starling wants to travel to the future to steal more advanced technology.  Of course, Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) and the crew are trying to get both the Doctor and the timeship back, at which point returning to their own time would be a really good idea.  The convoluted set up for this episode was pretty good, but I think it is pretty much impossible to come up with a payoff that is equal to the task.  However, I do find the idea of a Temporal Prime Directive to be a nice ironic touch and the episode will have some long term significant consequences for one of the ""Voyager"" crew.",1064793600,2,1549,4.631386861313868
7902777,3,B000003KAR,"This show was in trouble from the very first episode and it never quite got over its slump. Hammy or bad acting and goofy plots often make the show a painful viewing experience. Here is one example of a fairly good Voyager episode.
  Time travel stories seem to be one of the standard plot lines in Voyager (along with those abysmal holodeck-themed stories) but this is one of the better ones, if not the best one. The big negative is that ""Future's End"" has a Gilligan's Island style ending; where they wind up stuck back in the Delta quandrant for no GOOD reason.
I should have expected that ending, it is ""Lameager"" after all.",979776000,,629,4.508771929824562
7902778,4,B000003KAR,"Janeway and crew start where they left off in episode one, desperately trying to find a 29th Century timeship that has forced Voyager to be  transported to Earth in the late 20th Century. It's great to see the  Voyager crew running around on Earth, reminding me a lot of the Star Trek  IV movie. The plot has plenty of twists in it and runs a lot faster then  the first episode.
There are some great scenes with Tuvok trying to  pretend to be human and a good solid ending where everything turns out fine  but Voyager is STILL in the Delta Quadrant after all is said and done.",966902400,12,576,4.287037037037037
