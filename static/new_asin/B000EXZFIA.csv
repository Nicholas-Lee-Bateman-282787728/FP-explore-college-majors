8115678,3,B000EXZFIA,"EIGHTY MILLION WOMEN WANT - ? (original title) is a story of the Women's Suffrage movement that includes prominent ladies from both sides of the Atlantic. England's Emmaline Pankhurst and New York's Harriot Stanton Blatch (daughter of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and granddaughter of Edwin Stanton, Lincoln's Sec'y of War) appear as themselves in a film sympathetic to their cause.

Inherent flaws and abuses of the early 20th Century voting system (ballot stuffing, multiple voting) are also examined. Somehow, a love story is woven into this; the young lawyer tells his activist girlfriend of government corruption that would deny her and all women the vote.

8115679,1,B000EXZFIA,"Just a quick word to warn the silent film fans to stay away. The film is almost nonexistent - there's no the slightest hint of any kind of direction, and if there are good actors, the copy is so miserable that you just won't be able to see. It's a mediocre story of a woman and a bad, corrupt man, and somehow the moral seems to be ""Votes for Women!"". How it ever got there, beats me, since my attention faded very soon. Too bad.",1168387200,2,429,4.0588235294117645
