Both of the men provide insightful commentary that deals directly with the issues pertaining to activists and others who are concerned about today's status quo in the United States.

8563485,5,B000EZ8F80,"An excellent evening spent remembering the legacies of Malcolm X and Dr. Martin Luther King.  I was very impressed by both Imam Zaid Shakir and Dr. Cornel West.  The talks given by both of these luminaries were uplifting, encouraging and insightful.  The messages in these talks are extremely relevant to the issues faced by most of us today.  These talks are excellent for those who are looking to learn from our past to make a better future.

Imam Zaid address the social problems faced in America today such as alcoholism. According to him the blame lies at the facilitating institutions and not on individuals who are caught up in the system.  He explains that Malcolm X and Dr. Martin Luther King had the insight to blame the institutions and not the individuals.

Imam Zaid also explains that the key to Malcolm X and Dr. Martin Luther King's transformation was knowledge.  He said knowledge is power but it requires a humble heart, which both Malcolm X and Dr. Martin Luther King possessed.

Dr. Cornel West in his usual charismatic way, talks eloquently about the legacies of Malcolm X and Dr. Martin Luther King.  He said both Malcolm and Martin spoke from their heart, mind and soul.  They forced America to look at itself to unearth the racism, slavery and genocide.

He also explains what brings Malcolm and Martin together is that they directed so much of their energies to the younger generation.  They wanted the young people to know that their struggle for freedom and justice was a species of love for them.

This DVD is excellently produced with many extras.  You won't find any lecture quite like this one anywhere in the market.  I highly encourage all to buy it for their libraries.",1145750400,3,1703,4.761092150170649
