8503097,3,B006QQCSMA,"Pretty good early film with Madhubala as a stolen baby turned gypsy girl.  A bit of an overload on the musical sequences for my taste, but overall, enjoyable.  One or two songs definitely stand out.  I couldn't stand the abusive male gypsy's antics, and a lot of the acting and storyline is a bit maudlin and cliche, but it's meant to be lighthearted and entertaining (for that era), which it is.  I'm a big Madhubala film so there's not much she can do that's wrong for me.  She doesn't disappoint here either ands she makes the most of a rather chintzy role that could have been so much better -- would love to have seen her acting into her late thirties and forties to see what she would have done with bigger roles by more daring directors in a less repressive social and political environment that was India in the 1940s and 50s (and beyond).  Anyway, this is definitely an essential film to own if you're a Madhu fan because it showcases her early acting skills and contains some delightful musical sequences.",1513382400,,1015,4.549450549450549
8503098,5,B006QQCSMA,An old black and white movie but also like gold with the family drama and played by some of the veterans like Madhubala in Mughal-E-Azam and Geeta Bali in Albela. Both are hard to recognize as very young when this movie was made. Most of the songs are hits. Good quality video and audio. Very reasonable in price.,1476576000,,313,4.413793103448276
8503099,5,B006QQCSMA,Wonderful movie! :)  So lovely to see young Madhubala.  Great songs...  amazing to see the difference between back then and now.  Back then was really the golden Bollywood.,1431302400,,172,5.035714285714286
