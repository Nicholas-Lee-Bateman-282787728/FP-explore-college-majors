1689619,4,B0000639HC,"This package may disappoint purists because of newly created animated ""bumpers"" in between segments, a synthesizer score from the '80's rather then the original music ... and perhaps other small ""knits.""  I purchased it, however, to share with my two small boys and it was (and remains) a hit!
A beautifully crafted package for the 7 discs, lots of episodes and a small Gumby toy made it well worth the purchase for some family fun time.

1689620,1,B0000639HC,"Received this DVD set today and to my surprise, it is missing the ORIGINAL 'CAPITAL MUSIC' score and original theme song and open.  ...  If you are going to do an elaborate collection of CLASSIC ANIMATION, it must be restored to it's original elements.  These cartoons have a horrible synthesizer score that were added in the 1980's.  Word is, they didn't want to pay the money to keep the CAPITAL score in.  ... IMAGE issued two GREAT ART CLOKEY 'DAVEY & GOLIATH' discs with wonderful packaging and original CAPITAL MUSIC score!
I can't even watch this with the score they used and the continued use of bad music in the menus and NEW animated bumpers.  This is a BIG disappointment!  Small Children may still enjoy this collection BUT not the people that grew up with this series as kids....and for this price, those are the only people that would be buying this so RHINO cut out their target audience.  I rated it One Star for the kids.  0 STARS for Adults.

I have a hard time watching this.  the music was 50% of the gumby nostalgia.  i just went to a local dollar store and picked up a $1 dvd of 8 orginal episodes that gives me a full gumby experience. the only thing missing from the $1 dvd is the opening theme song..it just starts up",1102377600,25,645,4.128

1689631,4,B0000639HC,"Here it is!  All the Gumby episodes packed into one collection.  It is great to be able to watch all the episodes of Gumby, and they are even in chronological order.  However, the set could have been put together way better.  It receives four stars because it is a Gumby box set, the first time all the episodes were put together like this.  Here are some notes on the features of the set:
The Soundtrack:  This is a partially annoying part of the set.  They used the synth track made in the 80s for the episodes.  I have many VHS sets made by F.H.E. and they used the original soundtracks.  So, its not as if the original sound was lost or anything like that.  However, Gumby's voice is done by the same person and the rest of the voices are done well enough.
Episodes:  I hate the way the episodes are cut up into different parts.  The original 22 episodes were 12 minutes in lenght and then cut up to make 44 6 minute episoeds.  This is not done by Rhino, but was done by the studio way back when.  I have no idea why they did it, but it is annoying.
Packaging:  The DVDs do fold out in an awkward way.  I like it though because it is different and makes it unique.  The set also comes with a Gumby figurine.
Special Features:  There are several of Clokey's original clay featuers that are cool to watch.  The interview with Clokey himself, however, is very boring.  The interview with the voice of Gumby is better.  It almost seems as though the voice of
Gumby likes the series more than the one who created it.
Bad points:  The menus and navigation in the set is very annoying.  The Rhino introduction is retarded.  Between each episode there is an introduction to the next one.  The intros are repetetive and really stupid.  I don't like the new gumby song that plays during the menus.  I hate the children singing it.  The navigation is so overly childish that I think even children would be annoyed by it.
Overall Value:  The value of having all these gumby episodes availible in this way makes this set worth everything.  The packaging and presentation could have been way better and I have no idea why they chose to go with the soundtrack that they went with.  Maybe they thought modern children would enjoy it more.  Who knows?",1081728000,3,2238,4.396088019559902

1689633,1,B0000639HC,"I agree but as a baby b0oomr who grew up in the Sixties and Seventies and who remembers the (freelanced) Capitol Records-Licensed (incl. among others, the Sam Fox, MuTel (sic), Langlois and others) library music-you'll still hear it on (among MANY others!!!!) Jinks, the Huckster and others on Hanna-Barbera's early, 1958-59 HUCK show, on Quick Draw (also a Hanna-Barbera production), a host of Universal (like HITCHOCK and BEAVER) and Columbia (DONNA REED<DENNIS, THE TEXAN, FATHER KNOWS BEST, and the obscure THIS IS ALICE and early BEWITCHED which switched, no pun intended to original score) shows, as well as shows from indivdual companies like MY THREE SONS (Don Fedderson) and REAL McCOYS (Desilu)(1960-1965/ABC and 1965-1972/CBS and 1957-63 ABC), as well as on GUMBY's fellow Art Clokey stop-motion mates DAVEY AND GOLIATH's series, and even six LOONEY TUNES and MERRIE MELODIES in 1958), as someone who grew up on the old light orchestral/instr.country music just mmntioned above,utilizied on GUMBY, and the later 1960s rock-score, I find it a personal slap (see other comments from me and others here, Rick Goldsmidt and Akira and a few others), to have the music replaced.
It isn't just the music replacement issue, the music itself IS (as someone said), a ""lame Barney mix""--Continuiny seems odd esp.in the 1995 flick with Gumby going with a EW girlfriend Tara, when he still has Goo Mermaid (Voiced by the late, beloved Norma MacMillan of Sweet Polly (UNDERDOG) immortality, and also a sixties voice of CASPER the FRIENDLY GHOST when veteran Mae Questel left for other things).
Also the classic ""If you got a heart"" sixties them is gone!! The aforementioned canned score (a book by historian Jon Burlingame, TV's BIGGETS HITS from 1996, about the time of the Gumby flick, mentioned the stock music in chaper one HOI YO SILVER< and the music on Gumby, without any reference to the show itself, from Capitol, is mentioned on pp. 11-12,with words from Jack Cookerly, a composer of this music as was the great W.G.Loose. It's Wm. G.Loose who did a lot of themes for Columbia/Screen Gems in the late 50s like DENNIS THE MENACE and DONNA REED..both of which were hanging around before). the Music on Gumby atually made the show, when we're talking about the how as it sounded in the fifties and sixties anfd reruns thru 1988.(I am veyr happy to have the earlier videos of the show, three of them, as they were done..)",1080172800,4,2424,4.958230958230958

I guess I would never in my wildest dreams imagine that Rhino would screw up so badly, and mis-lead (by mentioning nothing) so severely.  It's true that finding these treasures so de-faced can cause severe depression and feelings of being betrayed in a middle-aged collector.  The fact that they managed to collect almost all the cartoons and the art pieces in one box is impressive and admirable -- but the nauseating scores and re-dubbed voices make it almost impossible to maintain the gratitude.  What's even more depressing, it is completely unlikely that this will ever be corrected.  Ah, life is a bitter mystery!",1076025600,6,814,4.74468085106383
1689636,1,B0000639HC,"Although I LOVE Rhino, and am forever grateful for their ever-expanding catalogue and preservation of potentially lost pop culture arcana, this set is disastrous.  I wrote a letter of complaint to the company, and was told that the original music could not be afforded, so Rhino chose to release the botched rehashes from the 1980s.  What galls me (in addition to the mere fact that they would dare release these treasures in this format in the first place) is the marketing which makes NO MENTION of the rotten synthesizer musak and the chopped up episodes.  The packaging gives the altogether false impression that you are getting the real thing, in its original glory.  WHY???!!!???",1061424000,29,685,4.982456140350878
1689637,2,B0000639HC,"The shorts are not in order so that you have part two of an episode before part one. The soundtrack is not the original one so that you have a synthesized keyboard playing in the background of shorts made in the late 1950's - this can dull your nostalgia experience. The pamphlet (not booklet) that comes with it gives no history, no original air dates, etc., You will have to guess when an episode is from by its look.  The box unfolds in a bizarre manner and the individual DVDs have no jewel boxes. They are also difficult to free from the hard plastic holder. I had to pry mine loose very carefully. I ended up keeping the DVDs in a plastic bag as the box was totally useless. The Gumby figure toy that comes with it is a miniature and not the original size that was marketed for years.  The extras on disc seven are mostly worthwhile but why didn't they have an entire episode of Howdy Doody (where Gumby was first introduced)? The Gumby transfers are generally good with only a few episodes faded as far as colors go. My biggest beef is that you have to watch the FBI warning and the short Gumby/Rhino intro every time you press the menu button on your DVD player. This was very annoying. Rhino has done an incredibly sloppy, thoughtless job with this release. It is as if they just threw all of the episodes together with little concern that many fans were expecting the ultimate Gumby collection - for themselves and for their kids.  Instead, we have to put up with this collection as it is unlikely that Rhino will ever correct their mistakes.",1060214400,15,1552,4.43859649122807

1689639,5,B0000639HC,"After reading a number of negative reviewes about this set, I was pretty sure I didn't want to buy it. People complained that the music wasn't original. They said the original print looks bad.

After buying this set a couple of months ago...I'm really glad I did. I love it!

Firstly, the music: I'm 35 and I remember watching Gumby on TV very very early in the morning. You know what I don't remember? I don't remember what the music sounded like. Mind you, I would absolutely love to hear it with the original music. At the very beginning of the Gumby The Movie there is some kind of martian person sitting in an easy chair watching an episode of Gumby. The music that's in it is probably the original soundtrack. Strings and flutes. I love that stuff. Kind of like perky 101 Strings. I love the fact that old TV shows had lots of neat incidental music. (crash your fathers new Buick, you get a bassoon or whooping trombones, that's all gone. Too bad, I never get sick of it.) The music that's on this set however just..fits. In fact, it sounds a lot like the music in the Gumby Movie. It's made with some kind of electronic keybord. I never think about the original music anymore..like I did before I actually bought and watched the set.

Secondly, the print: It's fine. The colors seem a bit washed out. I recently bought a new TV and it looks better. These are old films. They sould look old. Any jumps or hairs or whatever is bothering people in the print is minimal.
 Once again based on reading the reviews, I expected it to look crummy and I expected it to sound lousy. I like reviews. I like Amazon reviews. Reviews are one of the best features of Amazon. In this one case, I think some people could be misled by the reviewers who remember Gumby either differently or more accurately than the rest of us. So, they're disapointed with this product. Maybe I remember Gumby just well enough to know I wanted this set, but not so well that I felt any kind of let down.

My only complaints are that: The DVD takes about a minute and a half to go through it's pre-menu deal. You have to watch an FBI warning, then you have to watch a Rhino ball bounce up and down with ""splat"" and ""whisker pluck"" sounds thrown in, then you have to watch a lame newly claynimated Gumby, Pokey and Rhino rhino sitting on a couch before you can get to the main menu. Then, there is a canned intro to each and every single episode. There's a Pokey one, a Gumby one, a Goo one, and a Ma n Pa Gumby intro. They're brand new and very bright. They say the same exact thing every single time. I hate them. Lastly, the packaging is akward. I'm going to buy 7 CD/DVD envelopes instead and throw the box into the fire.

Don't be too much of a purist here. It's a great set, it's fun, it's damn good, it's loaded with lot's of cool vintage toys, situations that don't make any sense, and plots that don't resolve.

Lastly, the interview with Dal McKennon (Kinnon?) is useless. He's a kook, you hear the answers, but not the questions. It had to have been pieced together by an amateur.
I wish there were more than 112 episodes.",1056758400,7,3102,4.337931034482758
1689640,4,B0000639HC,"Negative reviews of this box complain about the ""new"" musical soundtrack (still thirty years + old, but not the original) and bumpers, but this is an excellent hunk of Gumby.  Not the perfect package for reliving childhood memories (if you're old enough to have seen the original broadcasts) but perfectly adequate for showing today's kids and entertaining them hugely.  The sly square/hip wit is still intact, and the synthesizer score is not nearly as bad as it could be. The material itself holds considerable charms, especially when the characters shut up and surreal events unfold.  If you can find this package for a reasonable price and want your claymation in a super-size party-pack, go for it.",1033430400,5,703,5.043103448275862
1689641,4,B0000639HC,"The last reviewer made some very good points, but I must correct some things.  The episodes, for the first since the early 60's are presented in the order in which they were produced.  This was carefully done to give the ""classic"" Gumby fans a look at how the look of Gumby evolved through the years up to the late 60s.  The episodes were not ""cut up"" for this boxed set.  They are in the same form/length that they've been aired since the very early 60's.  In '56 & '57 there were 22 12 minute episodes produced and aired.  To fit the proper format, Art Clokey re-edited those into 44 6 minute shows.  He did this in the late '50s to early 60's.  It's just more obvious in this set because of the correct order that they're in.
The new music/fx were put on in the 80's because Art clokey did not have the video release rights of the old music at the time, and did not have the money to afford it.  Lorimar, who was funding the new series offered and encouraged and paid for the new tracks.  The original voice actors for Gumby, Prickle, Pokey and many other bit characters were used.  Great care was made to make these voices better.  Of course, the original tracks had several other Gumby's on a few of the very early and very late episodes, that this does not.  I can't disagree with the music thoughts, but i've noteced that kids like the new music.  It would still be better to have the old music, and of course the original gumby song is a classic that is sorely missed.  I'll bet it'll show up on the 80's boxed set.  Our kids, and their friends are loving this collection.  It would be great to get the old music back, but the other point's needed correcting.  this is a great collection.",1028764800,15,1696,4.313291139240507
1689642,1,B0000639HC,"This is my first Amazon review, because I feel so strongly about Rhino's poor production of this boxed set. I did not grow up with the original Gumby series, I learned about Gumby sometime in the 80's, but was exposed to the original series (original music, sound effects, and voices).
I can't tell you how excited I was to find this DVD set available. As a long-time Gumby fan, I purchased it immediately. I've been unable to find Gumby on TV, and most of the merchandise is unavailable.
If you're a Gumby fan (older than about 8 years old), you need to strongly reconsider your purchase of this DVD set. Rhino made all of the mistakes in putting out a DVD boxed set...
1) They did not use the original character's voices from the 60's, but used the new voices developed in the 80's.
2) They did not use the original musical score and sound effects from the 60's, but used a new CHEESY synth soundtrack that is utterly distracting and too loud. Also, they used new sound effects that sound more like a cartoon than the original brilliance of the series.
3) The DVD Menu button takes you all the way back to the FBI warning, and you have to watch all of the long credits and intros before you get back to the menu itself.
4) They dumped the original Gumby theme song and replaced it with the cheesy, warm-and-fuzzy theme they created for the 80's show relaunch.
5) There is no book in the boxed set. At this price, I would have expected a colorful book about the series and its creator. There is a small book (maybe 5 pages) that gives an episode synopsis.
I don't know who the audience is for this boxed set. I guess it's the children who watched gumby in the 80's. The problem is, the vast majority of the Gumby fans out there want the original productions.
Rhino - you need to release a Classic Gumby boxed set and mark this boxed set very clearly as a ""remake"". I wasted money on this purchase. The only reason I am going to keep this and not ask for my money back, is because I am so desperate for Gumby, that I'll take anything over nothing at all.",1027814400,13,2054,4.337662337662338
1689643,1,B0000639HC,"I want my money back.  I thought Rhino was all about celebrating the originality, creativity, and genius of past media.  So why is it they're duping us with defaced work here?  This is an absolute OUTRAGE.  The magic that is Gumby has been all but trashed.  The beautiful, eerie, awe-inspiring soundtrack that included original compositions, all sort of innovative sound effects, and the great character voices have been replaced with a modern ""Barney"" mix.  I want to cry.  I thought Rhino would understand the importance of sound having started out in the audio product business.  This is clearly a case of bottom line or ignorance or both.

Unfortunately, the impressive orchestral soundtrack and timeless sound effects have been replaced with cheap-sounding ""modern"" imitations.  The voices are not original either, but they are much closer to the original soundtrack then the music or sound effects.  Truly a large disappointment to anyone who has ever seen the originals.  The ""A GUMBY ADVENTURE"" introductions were all removed too, replaced with a greasy-looking Pokey announcing ""Hey kids, here's another GUMBY!""  So sad.  It could have been glorious if they just left it alone, and released the classic original versions as-is.  Recommendation to buyers:  Pass, until a truly ""ALL ORIGINAL GUMBY"" is released.

Who is spending [the money] on a Gumby set, the casual shopper...  or those who fondly remember the quirky look, feel and SOUND of theshow, and want exactly that in a compiled set?

I have to agree with the appalled reviewers who are disgusted with this box set. A young child who has not seen the originals will not know the difference in the music and may enjoy the set, but a seasoned Gumby fan will not be happy with this purchase.
The extras and the packaging are supurb, but the main features, the Gumby cartoons, are utterly ruined by the awful synth soundtracks. The new music is irritating and annoying to the extent of disrupting the action on screen. The plunky goofy nursery rhyme melodies are often louder than the dialogue. Instead of underscoring what is going on in the shows, the music competes and many times overpowers the wonderful images. To add insult to injury, the incompetent engineer who mixed the sound somehow caused an ""echo"" /reverb on the characters voices, which gives their voices a distracting tinny quality that is franky just poor sound mixing.
Can someone at Rhino explain why they spent so much time on the extras but aren't presenting the cartoons the way they were originally intended?",1019174400,122,1344,4.951327433628318

I grew up with the original Gumby shorts. I found this collection here at Amazon a few weeks ago and preordered it. When it arrived today, I eagerly popped disk 1. To my dismay, after watching a few of the shorts, I found out that the original music had been completely replaced by a new synthesized score. Also, some dialogue had been added and/or replaced, as well as, what I could tell, new SFX.
I've been sad and disappointed all day. I'm not displeased that they released the Gumby shorts, and I'm not displeased with the packaging or the extras. But I am displeased that they would replace most of the original audio.
Like previous reviewer Rick said, I can't watch the shorts. I just can't. It's not the same. Unless the come out with another version, which is 99% guaranteed not to happen, I will just watch my worn copies on VHS.
I expected more than this from Rhino.",1018915200,14,904,4.484848484848484

7959036,1,B0000639HC,I brought this few years ago and I have to say it was disappointed with the content when I watched the first 2 episodes I realize that they are the same episodes  meaning rhino played with true gumby fans but I rather download the original episodes or just wait until they truly release original episodes,1425945600,,304,4.527272727272727
7959037,1,B0000639HC,"Rhino failed us yet again by screwing up the soundtrack on such a classic series.
Much like the morons in hollywood do trying to convert analog music to digital, Rhino does pretty much the same thing. They do not know the first thing about digital transfer.
You would be better off avoiding this set if you want a good gumby experience.",1304035200,5,336,4.524590163934426
7959038,5,B0000639HC,"I was a child of the 80's. So, I grew up watching these versions of Gumby. I never knew about the original soundtracks at the time. Since then, I have hunted down some of the original versions of the show from the 50's and 60's to see what all the hubbub was about the Rhino set with the 'ruined' soundtrack. I came to find out I do not at all like the original soundtracks. It probably has something to do with the fact that this version is the Gumby I grew up with, but I also feel that the weird, synth soundtrack just seems to fit the surreal nature of the show that much better. It all is going to come down to personal taste and what you are familiar with, I guess. But as for me, this set has been an awesome addition to my DVD collection, and me and my kids watch it together all the time. I totally prefer the 80's weird music and redone audio over the original versions generic music, so I am glad I went ahead with this purchase and didn't listen to all the Gumby purists bashing this set.",1292457600,6,1000,4.107142857142857
7959039,3,B0000639HC,"Gumby is one of the outstanding forms of entertainment.  I enjoyed watching this set, but could not help but notice changes in the music on early episodes.  I see I am not alone on this.  Here's an additional observation.  Some of the synthesizer music works well for later episodes.  But it is good to see that interest in the original music is helping to restore an element that created some of the charm of the series.",1242518400,,421,4.4868421052631575
7959040,2,B0000639HC,"I grew up with Gumby in the 80s.  I like to consider myself a true Gumby fan, as I sport Gumby gear.  But getting to the point, I got this set at a used record shop in Hollywood.  I was excited at first because I finally had every episode of Gumby in one boxset on DVD.  I anxiously got home and put disc 1 in only to realize in horror...THIS IS NOT THE GUMBY I REMEMBER!  And why is that?  Because the original soundtrack and voices are GONE!  Instead theres this nasty electronic music that many times takes over the episode.  I was watching the first episode with a girl and she got so irritated with the annoying music...and shes not even a Gumby fan!  WHy Rhino did NOT include the original music is a mystery to me, even though I've heard that its because of legal issues with the music rights.  And if there were legal issues, why didn't they simply WAIT until the problems were resolved BEFORE putting together a set only to disappoint the hardcore Gumby fans??  The only reason I am keeping this set is because it has every episode, along with the little gumby figure in the box. For all the set's faults its better then nothing.  Until they come out with a set that has the ORIGINAL VOICES AND MUSIC, I'll stick to my old VHS recordings and transfers from BETA tapes.  At least this way I get the really cool commercials and everything else to really take me on a trip down memory lane.  For someone that loves the things he grew up with, this was a let down.  For he average little kid or to anyone who knows little to nothing about Gumby, then this set will be ok.  To the Gumby fans pf the past like myself, it was a let down.  I hope for the day when I can sit back on a rainy afternoon or evening and watch all the Gumby episodes, in their original forms and sounds.
Bottom line:  If you are a hardcore fan, DON't Bother.
If you are a parent looking for good, safe entertainment for children, then this is good or ok for you.",1233878400,6,1940,4.211382113821138
