2221025,4,B0007N4AW4,"This is, without question, one of the best series on WW1 that I have seen.  The narration by Kenneth Branagh is perfectly paced and not overpowering.  Though the computerized coloring does add some flavor to the series, it would be worth the cost even if in the original black and white.  If you are looking for the bright colors of today's films you will be disappointed.  The colors are muted and dull, but still there. Since the amount of film available from WWI is limited, some of the film footage was used multiple times, but the way it was integrated into the history kept the flow perfectly.  Though my main interest is in WW II, I wanted something in my collection to help clarify the beginnings of that war.  This series did just that.  If you are looking for a clear, unambiguous description of the story behind WW I, look no further.  This is it.  Brilliant!",1124150400,13,870,4.5256410256410255
2221026,4,B0007N4AW4,"This is the greatest documentary so far I have ever watched and the story telling part is especially interesting. It sheds tremendous lights on how things started to happen and how it ends.

On top of the contents of the DVD, the ""colouring"" of those motion pictures gave a more realistic feel of the war, setting audiences with a virtual environment where war is really happening around them.

It is amazing that WWI survivors were also being (and able to be) contacted and interviewed to add more spice to the documentary.

Though, some scenes were actually being used repeatedly throughout the film and it is a little boring and seemed BBC has limited footage in this subject area.

All in all, it's a great documentary and it is especially useful to be a medium in instilling interests in youngsters to get more involved in history and fact-findings of the past.",1123545600,13,866,4.753333333333333
2221027,5,B0007N4AW4,"I have been a student of this conflict for many years, and while it is certainly impossible to cover every nuance of this unbelievable struggle in a few hours of film, the makers of the program have come as close to the mark as one could reasonably expect.  The addition of colorization only serves to bring the videos closer to the present; slowing down the motion also helps eliminate the ""silent movie"" jerkiness of most old flics, end result being a realistic, poignant and sobering representation of the war and the bravery with which the participants faced daily horror.

What is most notable, aside from the technical aspects noted above, is the narrative, which accurately depicts the underlying reasons for the conflict as well as the all-important opening weeks which directly led to the slaughterhouse of trench warfare. Most histories deal superficially with set-piece battle information and vague overviews.  Watching this series actually presents an accurate and insightful understanding of the roots of the conflict as well as how and why events happened in the way they did.  I was reminded of Barbara Tuchman's Pulitzer-prize winning ""Guns of August"".  All in all, a somber, informative yet thrilling work.

This would be an outstanding asset for any secondary school history department.",1122940800,23,1304,5.185714285714286
2221028,4,B0007N4AW4,"I am not much of a ""history buff"", but I enjoy good history programmes, especially about military history and campaigns. Although ""World War I in Colour"" is not as comprehensive and thorough as ""The Great War"", it is a great mini-series giving a detailed account of the 1914 war.

I was a bit disappointed at the electronically coloured archive footage at first, but I changed my mind. The producers added sound effects, which help the viewer experience the battles first-hand. The colouring process is also top-notch. Letters from the front are read by actors while the footage is shown, which enhance the experience (the fake accents for the Russian, German and French letters are quite irritating, though). Finally, the narration of Sir Branagh is excellent - very calm and articulate.

This is a great item for history buffs or people simply interested in war history. If you are looking for in-depth analysis of the World War I, though, turn to ""The Great War"", still the best reference for that conflict.",1119744000,17,1010,4.935294117647059
2221029,5,B0007N4AW4,"Some of the best historians of the Great War have contributed to this feature, Gary Sheffield and Norman Stone are among the finest in all of military history.

The colorization process is excellent and the historical accuracy is even better.

This is not a day by day running of the war but is rather more of an overview. This is essentially a true account of how the allies came to win the war. It is not however the accepted 'schools' version of events and is in my view all the better for that.",1118534400,77,498,4.344086021505376
2221030,5,B0007N4AW4,"I'm not a real big history buff or anything but I caught this one night on the History Channel and I was hooked. Unlucky for me I missed the first part of it but thanks to this release I can finally catch it all. It was very informative and I don't know if it's just me but the fact that it's in color just gives it that extra bit of humanity. Wathcing black and white footage you can seperate yourself from it easier. It doesn't look as ""real"" to you. But this really blew me away.

I don't watch that much of the History Channel at all really, but I'm glad nothign else was on that night or I would have missed this great show. It gives you a great indepth look at World War 1 and creates more of an interest in it than I've ever had. Kenneth Branaugh does a great job narrating it as well.

Awesome series. I'd reccomend it to any history buffs, military buffs, or really just about anyone with a thirst of knowledge.",1115164800,16,920,4.134078212290503

2221053,2,B0007N4AW4,"World War 1 in Color (2003) is not of the high standard of the ""in color "" series of documentaries that includes Britain at War in Color (2000), The British Empire in Color (2002) and Japan's War in Color (2005).

The reasons why World War 1 in Color (2003) is so inferior to the documentaries listed above, is because the narrative is not dictated by the authentic color footage available. So in effect World War 1 in Color is a light weight and omissive overview of the whole conflict.

The color footage is not real color  footage but tinted black and white footage, which gives a very ugly look to the whole documentary. The look of this digitally colored footage is similar in quality to hand tinted black and white footage from the silent era of motion pictures. This means the colours look like what they are; color overlays over black and white stock.

This digital process has many faults because the black and white stock remains dominate. A case in point are the scarlet tunics of the colorized footage of the Coldstream Guards on parade. The correct scarlet color is rendered impossible to attain because the red tint is layered over dark grey or black. The unsubtle impression of digital colorized footage makes World War 1 in Color almost unbearable to watch.

The narrative of the series is also defective. The history is generally simplified to the point that the documentary is often misleading.",1438300800,2,1412,4.746938775510204
2221054,2,B0007N4AW4,I found it disappointing.  The colorizing did not add anything to the History of the First War,1434412800,2,94,4.529411764705882

2221094,5,B0007N4AW4,"Probably one of the best collections of information about WWI. Added attraction is that it is in color. From the first episode to the final one, the information is presented in a clear & concise tone. There is very little of the over-dramatizing seen with many history collections. If you are looking to understand the road to war and the groundwork this war laid for the next one, this collection will give you the cast of characters that shaped the world for decades. A good beginning for anyone really interested in understanding politics in the world today.",1404950400,,561,4.793814432989691
2221095,5,B0007N4AW4,Great documentary! I love how it explains the war from all sides.  It gives the viewer a understanding of not only the battles but of the pre and post war era's as well.,1404259200,,169,4.121212121212121

2221097,5,B0007N4AW4,"It's very sobering to realize that all of the people you see onscreen have died very recently. The oldest WWI veterans were over 110 years old; the last one died in 2012.

The intent seems to be to present the war from the standpoint of the ordinary soldiers, so it doesn't talk much about missed opportunities or extreme strategic detail. They have chosen to present all the major topics of WWI rather than focus on a single theater or period. There is also some discussion of the associated revolutions and social and political background of the war. However, they tend to eschew testimonies of generals, discussions of massacres or atrocities, and focus on the tragedy of the war as a whole.

What you get is an extremely respectful and beautifully produced documentary that is a fitting tribute to some of the final survivors of the Great War. In perhaps 20-30 years, we will lose the oldest veterans of WWII as well; I hope that filmmakers then are just as prescient, and produce something as magnificent as this to commemorate their experiences.",1388793600,,1051,4.801104972375691
2221098,5,B0007N4AW4,"This is an excellent production that shows how terrible World War 1 was.  The addition of color to the original film is brilliantly executed, for anyone interested in major historic events this set of DVD's is a must.  I believe this set must also contain the only color film of the late Queen Victoria, possibly the only film that there is of this monarch.",1385337600,2,357,4.5625
2221099,5,B0007N4AW4,This series takes the uncharacteristic step of rendering wars we no longer comprehend into a more tangible plane of cognition by adding the equivalent of technicolor tones.  Definitely worth watching in classrooms.,1380412800,,214,5.6875

2221121,5,B0007N4AW4,I am always skeptical of these collections when I buy them because today's historians are more likely to change hsitory to suit their politics.  Not in this one.

2221126,5,B0007N4AW4,"I greatly enjoy the  study of history and WWI is a huge part of our American History and World History. This WWI in Color is the VERY BEST PRESENTATION I have ever seen, it is first quality in content and in its manufacture.

Please don't misunderstand I enjoy history and the study of history, I don't enjoy war and never will. I want to learn something from the study of war, that it could avoided and would never need to happen again.

It doesn't get any better then this WWI in Color and having Amazon behind the shipping and selling completes it nicely.",1335484800,,558,4.398058252427185
2221127,2,B0007N4AW4,"Much effort and money was expended to make a color version of old black and white films and stills. I do not think this adds to the excellent books, available on Amazon [The Guns of August by Barbara Tuchman, The First World War by John Keegan] or the ten part video series based on the work of Hew Strachan. In the opening volume, insufficient attention is paid to the diplomatic drama which immediately preceeded the shooting and slaughter. The discussion about the Battle of the Marne is shallow; the German commander Von Kluck turned in front of not behind Paris, in part due to an error in judgment which was compounded by the removal of troops from his right flank to go east and defend Prussian land under attack from the Imperial Russian troops. It is not correct to show the Taxi brigade ferrying troops without explaining what else was happening. No colorization can make up for these errors. Also, the interviews with the few survivors could be enhanced with subtitles. I am not going to comment on the remaining discs. In sum, better history is readily available in the books listed above. Colorization cheapens not enhances the telling of history. Oh, and not a good view of the red trousers that the French infantry wore, until it became apparent that red is a good color for a target against a field of brown and green. Thank you, and I ask one of our military experts to review and comment.",1334016000,4,1406,4.628
2221128,5,B0007N4AW4,"I watched this series with a strong feeling of wistfulness. I looked for shots of my grandfather, a World War 1 Doughboy. Something about the colorization kept me watching for glimpses of him as a young soldier in the American Expeditionary Forces. It was like finding a sepia colored family photograph in the attic and seeing your grandparents as young people. Few movies or shows cause me to have feelings like that. This is among the best World War I historical series I have ever seen. The colorization, the music, the narration combine with the pictures to make an outstanding historical series with an emotional depth, the best that I have ever seen. I wanted it to be longer, and in more depth, but I learned and saw things on this set that I had never seen or known.
The colorization is not loud and brash, nor do the colors overwhelm, but instead, the colors are subtle, almost as though you are looking at gently faded color movies of yore. Pastel coloring, nice narration, well ordered and appropriate music, all combined with very good pictures,  which lead to producing a beautiful and educational set of DVD's. If you are interested in acquiring a DVD set on World War 1, this is it.",1332028800,5,1197,4.64622641509434
2221129,2,B0007N4AW4,"The discerning viewer, in search of insights into the genuine cause of the war, and a production that plumbs the depths of the passions the propelled so many into desperate actions, will find this documentary superficial.

I consider this effort - ""World War I in Color"" - to be third rate. Many of the not abundant scholars interviewed either don't understand the war or weren't asked the right questions to illicit responses that supplied worthwhile perspective. Interviews with surviving veterans had value, but it was vexing that many of the interviews were repeated, often more than once.

Some of the footage was fresh and demonstrated some effort to have obtained it, but a great deal of footage was replayed over and over again.

Shortcomings like those listed above might be overlooked if critical campaigns, like Verdun, were treated with an abundance of revealing footage and cogent commentary, but that was not the case.

Likely, the producers counted on the colorization of their old WWI footage to carry their water for them, and the colorization does have its appeal, but it eventually wears thin without the substance detailed above to bring the project home.",1327622400,7,1175,5.072538860103627
2221130,5,B0007N4AW4,This is an amazing DVD. Even has interviews with people who fought during that time. The color process really adds to the enjoyment. It goes through the causes of the war and who fought in it. It is British and sometimes hard to understand some of the older veterans but that is what subtitles are for. A very impressive film to add to your miliary collection. Kenneth Branaugh does a great job of narration.,1320278400,,408,4.527027027027027

Hence, if you, like I, purchased the 2005 release, you will not find anything new in this 2010 re-release.  That being said, the 2005 release is difficult and expensive to procure especially new (Amazon does not carry it).  It is an excellent series where the colorization does indeed add to the experience, even if sometimes (one must also remember the usually low quality or the original B&W footage to appreciate the result)the colorization is a bit disappointing.

2221173,1,B0007N4AW4,"With all the original footage out there of the Great War, someone finally decided to ""enhance"" it by colorizing it.  Did this need to be done?  No.  How does anyone living in this day and age know what all the colors were in the scenes from over 92 years ago?  Does our glorious modern technology know?  I don't think so.  So it becomes re-written history in a way (altered historical film footage).  It is too bad that today's people can't simply learn from the original black & white footage.  They need ""assumed"" colors to enhance their learning pleasure.  This colorization is garbage and it belongs with all the other black & white movies that were colorized.",1293494400,18,664,4.655172413793103
2221174,5,B0007N4AW4,"Stunning! COLOR makes this footage more realistic than any other documentary of ""The War to End All Wars"". Today's technology makes a huge difference, but the narration (Kenneth Branagh) and personal accounts from men who were in the war make even more impact. This series is a great overview-not a complete history, but certainly covers the important segments. More than that, it offers the emotion, the feel of that war, the hardships. I personally learned a great deal about the war that my American grandfather lived through. Most who will watch this amazing footage will have never talked to a living soldier that survived, there are few left, and most of today's population is too young. This is an important piece of DVD saved history, necessary in every library and historical department of school.

As important as the technologically added film color, is the educational focus on war machinery and weaponry that WWI inspired. I learned carriers, folding winged planes, tanks, flame throwers, and so much more was first used in WWI, not WWII. WWI was not all horse drawn equipment. The civilian footage (now in color) is dramatic as well. Literally seeing those early 20th century lifestyles & people on footage that is typically only found in still B/W photos is powerful.

ALL 6 episodes as well as 2 excellent Bonus segments (one longer than an episode) provide SUBTITLES. The bonus material is as interesting and well done as the episodes. 20 bios, facts bonus, a time line, plus a booklet pack even more of the war into this set. Topics reachable in scene selections: classroom friendly.

Episode details:
1___""Catastrophe"" The cause: assassination in Sarajevo-1914, trenches, death, fighting, letters, wounded, survivors, diaries, air fighting, subs, steam and horse power--all there--now in color.
2___""Slaughter in the Trenches"" 700+ miles of trench warfare proved a stalemate 1915-17, going 'over the top' meant almost certain death, new weaponry-more death.
3___""Blood in the Air"" Dog fights, bi-planes lifting off a rigged battleship, ace hero's, bombing raids seen in color. Aerial reconnaissance, bi-planes with machine guns (fighters), Red Baron (in red), Flying circuses, sea planes, astonishing footage of air force action only 11 yrs after Kitty Hawk.
4___""Killers of the Sea"" U-boats or submarines replaced battleship warfare, Lusitania-1915, Dardanelles, Jutland sea battle, ships going down, Hydrophone, depth charge, all covered with period film, now in color.
5___""Mayhem on the Eastern Front"" German, Austrian & Russian western front trenches were horrific and as much a stalemate of the eastern trenches. The Russian Tzar falls leading to revolution and Lenin. Russian defeat adds to the eastern front difficulty.
6___""Victory and Despair"" 1918 scenes of the bloody final year, victory, the cost, the aftermath, all of the pageantry and destruction colorized. A suspenseful final year for both sides. Then: 11th hour, 11th day, 11th month.

For anyone that enjoyed this i would recommned Fall of Eagles which also deals with the relationship between Austria, Prussia and Russia.  I would recommend this video to any history buff",1185321600,4,318,5.34
2221177,5,B0007N4AW4,"I'm not going to write about the scope of this DVDs military/historical merit because I'm not a historian and don't want to offend the sensibilities of those who are. I would instead like it known beforehand that I have read a lot on the subject, have watched a lot on the subject, and have delved into some of the more bizarre intrigues of warfare. My great-grandfather, a doughboy himself, sparked my interest when I was a child and, with that still impressing an ever-impressionable mind, I purchased this set to perhaps see a little more clearly into that mirror in time.

While it isn't the image that makes the tale but the way it is actually told, there are a few images in the series that really did make an immediate impact. The first were the naval sinkings; when I watched those in black and white I had always seen the ship roll over and start to sink and had thought of how horrible that must be. When it went to color I didn't see it as a ship anymore, however, but more as a floating fortress with thousands of little people trying to dive into the water while hoping to escape. That really brought home how horrible this was, with the color etching little moments into a larger affair that really made an impact.
And what an impact it made.

Some of the other things that were brought out quite stunningly were the multi-cultural aspects of war, with the British colonies showcasing an astounding array of people I had never envisioned, and the sheer variation in uniforms that moved from nation to nation. As you watch the Germans march you could see how they stood apart from their Austro-Hungarian allies, for example, and when you stared down a line of trenches you saw some of the people that seemed to blend in with the surroundings. That meant exploring the mud and the foundation and seeing a little more of the condition, knowing all-the-while that those people ""going over the top"" were really more like myself than I had ever explored.
That was really terrifying to think about, and especially so in some of the major conflicts where tens of thousands lost their lives in less than a day of fight.
Then there were the machines of war, the tanks and the air battles especially, and how they looked. I never imaged the German aircraft being so colorful, truth be told, even though I had seen them in books and had seen recreations. It just didn't connect - but seeing it there made it seem all-the-more overwhelming.

On the merits of that and that alone, I would say this is an excellent buy. If you go by price alone, World War 1 is actually the true forgotten war, with entire volumes on the conflict costing meager sums when compared to its more contemporary counterparts. It is short, true, and the longer sets do lay down a better foundation. Still, the set is quite amazing in scope and detail.",1184889600,11,2826,4.559055118110236

Several historians also give their insight, and the war is very nicely explained. Although several pieces of footage are reused quite often throughout the video, it is still enjoyable for anyone who has a genuine interest in the history of the war.",1167782400,6,510,5.011764705882353
2221201,2,B0007N4AW4,"The presentation of computer enhanced b&w images that in some cases were sort of new added limited value to my extensive video library, legacy of my father. However, the aural commentary of Brannagh was repetitive and boring, each episode basically repeated the same 6+ octagenarian survivors exact same comments and reflections.",1160697600,8,329,5.470588235294118
2221202,5,B0007N4AW4,"This is perhaps one of the most enjoyable documentaries I have seen in recent years.  Do not be put off by the colorization process used to tint the existing archival footage; indeed, it actually improves upon the viewing experience and compliments Sir Kenneth Brannah's lucid and absorbing narration. Everything is included here and covered with enough detail to satisfy and entertain either the armchair historian or the seasoned PhD.  It is good to see that more high quality documentaries are being made about WWI--in many respects a war that was truly the world's first ""modern war"" that changed the map of Europe forever.",1148688000,34,627,5.077669902912621
2221203,5,B0007N4AW4,"If you're skeptical of colorization, fear not, these guys did an outstanding job that makes everything very watchable, if not definitive. Some of the downsides are that they tend to recycle their material as the series progresses, and that they show next to no footage of the physically and mentally scarred veterans. Apart from that, this--of all the WWI programs I've watched--is easily the definitive WWI DVD.",1142985600,8,412,5.164179104477612
2221204,3,B0007N4AW4,"A much better dvd series on WWI would be The First World War: The Complete Series (2004). World War I in Color is not a complete set, but less comprehensive and informative.  The colorization is an attractive feature to augment the more complete version.",1142121600,18,254,4.7727272727272725

2221206,5,B0007N4AW4,"WWI in Color is not simply a hodge-podge collection of colorized WWI footage.  While the colorization is certainly muted and tasteful, the color is, in fact, the least significant aspect of the series.  Had the footage been entirely in black and white, the documentary would still be a superb visual introduction to the conflict.

Clearly, several episodes are not enough to cover every detail of WWI, but major battles, strategies, and technologies are covered nicely. The series devotes separate segments to trench warfare, the air war, the conflict at sea, and the eastern front.  A background introduction to the conflict takes up the first episode and the sixth segment presents the conclusion of the war.  Two bonus segments round out the series -- a discussion of tactics and strategy and a ""making of"" piece.

Of course, WWI in Color contains copious footage (for the time) that gives the viewer an invaluable visual sense of the conflict.  Many of the film clips are stunning and unforgettable.  Yet the series also interviews the few living veterans of the war and asks military historians to expound on various topics.  The well-paced narration provides numerous and interesting details.

All in all, a fine and worthy effort that deserves to be viewed.",1130457600,129,1264,5.06280193236715
2221207,5,B0007N4AW4,"World War I in Color is a wonderful documentary.  It provides a surprisingly comprehensive look at World War I.  The footage is remarkable.  I am not a fan of colorizing black and white movies, but in this case it works well.  I am a fan of military history and have a blossoming interest of World War I after having toured Verdun, Somme, and Ypres battlefields.

The only fault I have with the DVD is playing chapters and picking scenes.  It is awkward.  There are four major sections and about five or six chapters in each section.  The chapters play smoothly one into the other, but the Sections end and you have to start the next section manually.  This is a minor problem in an otherwise wonderful documentary.",1128038400,19,715,4.566929133858268
2221208,3,B0007N4AW4,"The colourization is well done despite the improbably ginger mustache of Ludendorf and a pale blue (only) Union Jack. The repetition is often irritating. Delville wood and Pozieres are NOT mentioned with Vimy ridge only in passing. The commentary on the trench warfare tends to be of the ""donkeys"", ""butchers and bunglers"" and "". . . . planless, gutless lot of buffoons""  persuasion - Haig was the best of them all but was still an employee subject to sanction and in the beginning was starved of munitions and man power. Remember the northern section of the front was only 2 or 3 days march from the channel coast (Dunkirk etc). Haig DID NOT declare war, DID NOT invade Belgium, DID NOT destroy large tracts of France but he DID hold the show together between the French mutiny and the arrival of the Americans.",1127779200,10,812,4.678321678321678

2221210,5,B0007N4AW4,"I agree with some of the other posters that this video production does have its flaws. But, despite its flaws, I'm giving it 5 stars anyway because it absolutely excels in its central purpose: the colorization of World War I films.

As a World War I buff, I have a fantasy of time travel becoming possible someday, and I would then travel back in time to see World War I for myself. That's not going to happen, but this video is the next best thing. Its colorization brings World War I so close that I felt as if I were actually standing there by the side of the road watching the soldiers march by.",1126310400,10,599,4.254385964912281

8049174,4,B0007N4AW4,"Excellent dvd of Ww1. Of course the colour which brings an imediacy to it. And above all the interviews with British, survivors which is totally moving.
Also it Gives attention to the important and key eastern front and how Russian imperial army kept 160 enemy divisions held down for three years at horriffic cost.
Faults are few, as calling Enver Pasha, who was a general, the ottoman Sultan and showing film made after the event of lenin's 1917 autumn coup, as authentic newsreal showing enthousiam for coup. Was not true. Enthousiam for initial Feb.revolution  yes but not fo lenin. Lenin's communist party only got 20% support in 1917 constituent assembly election.
The  totally negative views re Austro Hungary are not considered so accurate today when seen within context and what came after.  And indeed seeing it was victims of state terrorism  by Serbia useful to think how certainly countries would have  reacted today.
It also tends to blame Germany totally for war and again today that not general view with blame shared and by uk which did not make clear it's intention to back France ( Entente Cordiale not a formal treaty) until last moment. One wonders if Germany understanding uk intention much earlier it maybe might have restrained it's Austrian ally, that had however every right to see some justice from Serbia.",1516924800,,1333,4.959641255605381

Fortunately the colorization process is good enough that it doesn't distract. Kenneth Branagh;s narration is also competent and doesn't get in the way of the movie; as happens with most actors who think they can narrate--and can't. The gold standard: Charlton Heston, Michael Redgrave, Edward Hermann, Laurence Olivier and very few others. The Great War (1964) is another doc I highly recommend.",1499904000,,512,4.965116279069767
