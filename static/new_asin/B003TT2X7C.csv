8405428,4,B003TT2X7C,It's an interesting story but a bit depressing.  The family places such a burden upon the boy to be like them and they are what you would want a boy to grow up to be like.,1424649600,,171,3.75
8405429,5,B003TT2X7C,"This is a great film, which, for some reason, seems to have gone unnoticed considering the few reviews there are. I am not a fan of coming of age stories, because of the array of cute clichs that usually joins them together, but this one has become one of the few exceptions. Another unusual coming of age story that I really enjoyed was Waititi's 2010 film called ""Boy"". Neither of these films are your typical first experiences movies, where they discover everything for the first time, from books, love, sex, responsibilities and so on.

Gunther is part of the Strobbe clan, a family of misfortunates. Gunther seems to be destined to a misfortunate future, but he struggles for this not to happen. Although this is supposed to be a comedy-drama, it's more of bittersweet film. The film goes back and forth within three periods in the life of Gunther, a baby, a teenager, and an adult. This gives it a fast pace and makes it interesting all the time. I like films whose characters are deeply developed, and ""The Misfortunates"" is one of these. We get inside the psyche of Gunther, and, by the end of the film, I was left wanting for more.",1370736000,4,1140,4.588235294117647
