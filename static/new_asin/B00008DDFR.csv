7981939,3,B00008DDFR,"I bought this DVD as a Christmas present for my dirt bike crazy 5 year old son. The footage was great and it was a full 40 minutes, showing really cool stunts. What I didn't like: this would have been a five star rating except, at the risk of sounding like my mother, there was stuff in here that made it not a good match for kids under 16. There were many scenes of scantily (quite) clad women doing various inappropriate things. Secondly, many of the scenes showed bike riders doing very unsafe things such as going down the freeway in a t-shirt and standing up on their bikes, riding backwards and popping wheelies going 60. Lots of riding with no helmets. While I'm sure this is great for adults watching who know better, it is not suitable for children. In defense of the video, it does not advertise itself for kids but I still wish to see videos like this promote at least the minimum motorcycle safety so it doesn't influence 16 year olds to do bonehead things.",1324771200,,969,4.418994413407821
