8373770,4,B002MAPFVK,"This SOV style movie was really good very much a homage to Halloween in my opinion I actually thoughts this was done in the 80's shocking it was done in 2009.
Movie is about Bobby who gets a cruel prank played on him many years later he is all grown up and now wants revenge on the kids who tease him kill scenes in this movie was good for a home made horror.",1483142400,,359,3.9315068493150687
