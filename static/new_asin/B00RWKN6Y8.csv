6936315,3,B00RWKN6Y8,"I must say I was kinda disappointed with this film after being so thrilled at it's debut release on dvd and blueray  Being a fan of the action adventure
genre of the 1970's  I expected something along the lines of the star packed 70's films like ""killer force"" or ""Golden needles"" both films which need a
new release treatment. But even with the ever beautiful Sophia Loren and charismatic James Coburn in the driver's seat this one seemed kind of a
runaway train of whatever. Sure there were explosions and car chases, the slick one liners and the great location shots but there was nothing to hold
it together.,that see thru-paper thin wire that suppose to pull the story a certain direction. ""muddlement"" is a term that comes to mind. Anyway I'm not
sorry I purchased...It's a great print , in it's correct widescreen ratio and comes with the original theater which plays much smoother than the film.",1427068800,12,903,4.708860759493671
6936316,3,B00RWKN6Y8,"This movie is so lucky that I gave it 3 stars. could have gone to the dark side on this. First let's get an aging James Coburn, but he still does an okay job, get an actress who really never was much of an actress (some films maybe, but not many) Sophia Loren, get O'J. Simpson, never, ever an actor. Then get some cool veterans, Eli Wallach and Vincent Gardenia and shake and throw in a very predictable plot and solution and here you have it one of Sir Lew Grades not so good movies. some of them were good bad this was just not good. You can avoid this and hope you can see it for free somewhere if you really want to. I say don't go out of your way for it.",1426291200,3,660,3.9328358208955225
