4992727,5,B006J6ZOYG,"We are great fans of the Inbwetweeners TV series and had been looking forward to this movie for months. It was no surprise that it was not shown on the local movie theater as the material is perceived as too raw and raunchy for general consumption in the US.
Highly recommended, but be warned if you don't know the series! The Inbetweeners Movie is a story of teenage boys with a one track mind being unshackled on a vacation in a Spain - be afraid!
The acting and delivery of one-liners of Simon Bird, Joe Thomas, James Buckley and Blake Harrison as well as other cast members is superb and the movie delivered to our expectation and had us both cringing at times and in tears of laughter at other points. The Inbetweeners Movie is fully deserving of all awards!",1329955200,,763,4.457142857142857

4992729,5,B006J6ZOYG,"I am a huge Inbetweeners fan and was quite upset that the movie was not shown in my area when it was released this year. To make it worse, my extended family in England was quoting how incredibly funny the movie was. I received this movie for Christmas and enjoyed viewing it on Christmas Day. It was as funny as I had expected it to be!  The comedic timing of all of the actors is priceless and I loved every minute of the movie. I would recommend the movie to any fan of the series!",1325116800,9,484,4.094736842105263
4992730,4,B006J6ZOYG,"The Inbetweeners Movie is awesome and finishes off the Inbetweeners series in a great light.  If you've never seen the British comedy on TV you can watch the film on its own but I highly recommend watching the series (there are three of them) first.

This seems to be a marmite film - you either love it or hate it.  I'm British and love it - it's gag a minute and one of the best films to come out of the UK this year.  Yes it's been done before, and yes much of the film is cringeable but if you have a sense of humour I see no reason why you won't like this film.  If you don't like British comedy or the thought of watching four teenage boys on holiday, you probably won't like this film.

I'll be gutted to see the Inbetweeners go, they've been a big hit in the UK... and in my opinion, rightly so!",1324944000,6,803,4.018867924528302

4992739,4,B006J6ZOYG,"The Inbetweeners Movie takes us past form school (high school to us Americans).  The ""normalist"" of the lads, Simon (Joe Thomas) has had a life long lust relationship with Carli (Emily Head).  She dumps him.  Friends ""awkward"" Will (Simon Bird), gullible Neil (Blake Harrison) and pathological liar and perv Jay (James Buckley) decide it's best to take Simon on vacation to get his mind off things.

Each of the characters seems to be a stage in the typical young man's life, with one exception.  These four cannot get past the hormone driven portion of puberty.  It's all about the ladies.

4992754,5,B006J6ZOYG,"Just as the eponymous TV show is simply one of the best, so too is ""The Inbetweeners"" feature movie. This movie is absolutely hysterical and a true joy.

As is fitting for a leap to the big screen, the movie does everything the show does, but in a bigger and better way: raunchier humor, fouler jokes, more gratuitous nudity. But then the film also ramps the stakes up higher as well, sending the four heroes onto an exotic sex and booze-filled holiday in a gorgeous foreign recall, with their very friendships and love lives on the line.

Perhaps the lone knock against this movie is how it gets a little more serious in the grand finale, so the jokes slow down a bit. But to fans of the show, it is a truly fitting finale to their epic misadventures.

While newbies to the characters will still enjoy the film just fine, I must admit, that as a longtime fan of the franchise, I felt a little tense at points knowing that this was the final fling for the fellas. The ending does not disappoint.",1404086400,,995,4.396739130434782

4992761,1,B006J6ZOYG,Rewatch American Pie if you want a gross out high school comedy. Lower production quality than the show.  It feels like the same number of jokes as a single episode of the show but streched out.  You're not getting anything else than can't be shown on a British TV except some meat and 2 veg (seriously) and fake poop photos.,1376870400,,325,4.4

4992763,4,B006J6ZOYG,"This is not a new idea. A group of less than socially functional boys/girls go on a holiday to try and break away. This movie takes that format and sends it way over the top.

Here's the scoop. Four buddies, gorpy to the enth degree, go to Greece for a holiday. The plan, as usual, is to drink themselves into a coma, find some luscious babes and lose their virginity. Of course, things don't quite turn out as they'd planned. But sometimes the unexpected journey proves more fruitful.

This was a near surreal experience to watch. We've seen this. Many times. But this is totally bizarre. First off are the four friends. Many of us have seen photos of Walmart shoppers and know that there are a lot of socially inept folk out there. But these four aren't stupid, so it's difficult to understand how they got so far afield. And then they meet up with four young ladies. By all rights the girls should have run, screaming, from the premises. But, counter to logic, a small spark begins to smolder and eventually ignites. I'd like to say these guys run through the gamut of misadventures, but somehow, through the gorpiness, it takes on a gravity all its own. As in these  kinds of movies, the good guys win and the cromags get their comeuppance. They cheat here and there by putting things up on the screen that wouldn't even work in bizzaro world, but you like the characters so you let it slide.

This is taken form the TV show of the same name so it must have had some degree of following. If you want a truly bizarre, over the top experience, have at it.",1375142400,3,1557,4.414634146341464

4992767,3,B006J6ZOYG,"After three seasons, the raucous award winning British comedy,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Inbetweeners/dp/B0074JOD8U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Inbetweeners</a>&nbsp;(2008-2010) concluded its run on television.  The program followed the adventures of four schoolmates through their high school years, as they dealt with situations typically encountered by boys of that age, school, girls, cars, drinking alcohol, and sex.  While featuring plenty of crude and vulgar elements, the humor had a certain level of sophistication and irony, as things seldom turn out well for these lads, as the series concluded with graduation approaching.

The Inbetweeners (2011) movie takes up shortly after best buddies Simon (Joe Thomas), Will (Simon Bird), Neil (Blake Harrison), and Jay (James Buckley) have graduated.  Before going their separate ways, they embark to Malia, on the island of Crete, where Simon's former girlfriend Carli (Emily Head) is on holiday.

Continuing the story in a feature film, provides the opportunity to push the bounds of the humor to new levels, but unfortunately, while the film gets off to a decent start, it soon becomes bogged down, and never really takes flight.  The humor that played well for schoolboys in England, can't seem to find much traction in the sunny Mediterranean.  The movie does feature some nudity, but sadly it is mostly of the male variety.

In Malia, the guys eventually hook up with a group of four girlfriends, Alison (Launa Haddock), Lucy (Tamia Kari), Jane (Lydia Rose Bewley), and Lisa (Jessica Knappett).  Ever the optimist, Will attempts to get closer to the striking Alison.  Lucy seems interested in Simon, but he remains fixated with reconciling with Carli.  As usual, the only one having any success with the ladies is Neil, who is working a slightly older demographic.

The Inbetweeners worked brilliantly in the school setting, but the premise seems to flounder a bit, on the larger stage of the real world.  Although the personalities of the primary characters remains mostly true to the TV series, the screenplay can't seem to find a way to make the humor work, in this particular situation.  It's nice to see the guys finding some success with the fair sex, but the romances play out with very little warmth.  The acting is decent, as more often, it is the writing that fails to measure up.  The movie may appeal to ""Inbetweenites"", but general audiences may not find it very amusing.",1372896000,,2499,5.402061855670103

4992772,5,B006J6ZOYG,After watching the entire series on netflix i was hoping that the movie would not fall short. And boy it didn't. British TV is so different from American TV they spend more time on the writing and character development and less on production value. That is why one easily falls in love with the characters. They are so funny. Your typical teeneagers just wanting to drink and get laid. I absolutly love the series and the movie was just as good.,1368230400,12,445,4.506172839506172

Four high school males vacation on the island of Crete to drink, party, meet girls, and have sex. As always in the movies our diverse foursome meet a foursome of women and learn lessons in life.

The film is funny. No doubt about, I had several laughs from it. Much of the humor is sexual in some shape or form. There is a lot of young male testosterone which results in various conflicts. Not being familiar with the series, this was a run of the mill spring break comedy.

4992780,4,B006J6ZOYG,"There are a few things about the Inbetweeners movie that makes you go ""hmmm?"" Most of these things revolve around Carly being such a total Bit... Well, you can figure it out. Her relationship with Simon has always been awkward, but she was never downright cruel or selfish. In the movie, she seems to be nothing more than a horrible person that takes advantage of Simon's obsession. It doesn't quite fit her persona from the television show.

Neil is another character who seems to switch from bumbling idiot who doesn't know better to devious liar. It seems completely off for the character who ""can't promise that"" whenever you ask him not to do something to suddenly be trying to trick everybody around him.

Those two characters aside, the rest of Inbetweeners works pretty well. The relationship between the four boys is still strong and interesting, the jokes hit and actually made me laugh loudly on a few occasions. This isn't the kind of movie you should go into for oscar winning performance or deep character driven drama. It's about horny boys and sexy girls meeting up in a romantic location. The boys struggle to have sex, and the girls are much kinder and forgiving towards them on film than they would ever be in real life.

If you have Prime, you can currently view the television show for free, if you don't, think of American Pie, it's close enough to that.",1362873600,,1376,4.7012448132780085
4992781,3,B006J6ZOYG,"""After sometime of anticipation for Simon, Neil, Will, and Jay getting up to no ruddy good, The Inbetweeners Movie, released around August 2011 stays true to the nature of teenage shenanigans and British chauvinism but falls short of concluding its excellent series. All the characters have a place and time here and the film takes a look at their time in a heavily Anglicised Greek tourist resort. As a whole, it was funny but it was a bit weak (not as hitting and hilarious as the show), slow at parts (timing could be a little tighter), and underdeveloped (this is especially the case in the ending and climax) compared to the series which managed to have time and variation in its plot. I wish the film would have concluded it the film better by providing more emotion (like showing Simon going to university). The same concern could be said sometimes for The Simpsons Movie, another film based on an excellent TV series. For a film that is full of crude material, this feels a tad shallow and predictable as of now with the usual cues found in films like Superbad and Project X. However, unlike those films, The Inbetweeners stands on its own ground being a British creation based on the kind of youth culture existent and many of the film's crude qualities share similarity with the 2000 cult comedy Kevin & Perry Go Large. Unlike The Inbetweeners, Kevin & Perry does not lack the independence, musical vibes, and edgy humour that it had when it first came out. In other words, it works in many spots as it as but it is far from spectacular. Nevertheless, for any Inbetweeners fan, it is required viewing but more could have been asked for.""",1362873600,,1647,4.6438356164383565

It was great to see the gang together again and the movie was lots of fun, I just think the BBC show was all around better than the movie.  Hope they do a sequel and it is even better!",1358726400,,268,3.6842105263157894
4992793,5,B006J6ZOYG,"This movie was a step in the right direction from the show in my opinion.  As the boys grow older,so does some of the sassy and inappropriate things they do and say. 30 seconds in and I was already laughing loudly. The best part of it all is every single character is played by the same actor/actress, that's sometimes rare in a Tv to movie situation so its definitely worth buying and/or renting.  You'll most likely cry from laughing so hard. :)",1358553600,7,447,4.439024390243903
4992794,1,B006J6ZOYG,"This movie is terrible.  If you loved the series, then do yourself a favor and don't ruin it by tainting your memories of it with this ghastly ending.  The series is raunchy, hilarious, and even touching, and this movie lacks all of those charming qualities.  It may as well be a National Lampoons movie with a British accent.  The writers of the show should be ashamed that this movie exists.",1358121600,2,393,4.571428571428571

The movie does the series justice. The characters, their antics, their naive stupidity, the embarrassment you feel on their behalf - it is all there!

4992797,5,B006J6ZOYG,"It is infuriating that series such as Downton Abbey or the Inbetweeners come out almost a year later in the U.S. and are usually edited (censored). This movie recently arrived in theaters in the U.S. even though it was already available through iTunes UK. You can watch all three seasons online, but I'm not driving two hours to watch the movie in a cinema.",1351555200,,357,4.59375
4992798,3,B006J6ZOYG,"NO SPOILERS:

The freedom allowed on UK TV didn't result in the R-rated movie upping the raunchiness quotient.  Frankly, given both the 3.5m (Pounds) production budget and time that had past since the end of the series, I expected an over the top effort.  Other than the change in location (Malia, Crete), there was nothing to distinguish the 97-minutes movie from any 4 of the TV episodes.

There is nothing inherently wrong with the movie.  Will (Simon Bird), as the moderator and perfect wit, shines.

A definite watch, though I wouldn't pay much more than the cost of admission.",1346630400,3,582,4.828282828282828
4992799,5,B006J6ZOYG,do you know when you watch a film which has came from an established tv series and it is almost certainly a let down? Well the inbetweeners film does not do this. The story follows the 4 main characters on their last 'lads' holiday together where they demonstrate all of the profanities and vulgar ideas in which they are famous for. this film will have you laughing and is a great way to end the series.,1335225600,14,404,4.328947368421052
4992800,4,B006J6ZOYG,"What's it about?

Based on the popular television series, four young British teens finish high school and travel to the Greek Islands for some holiday fun.

Is it any good?

It is everything you would expect of a bunch of teens on holiday, disgusting, awkward and so much fun. If you have watched the series, this film is essentially a 90 minute extended episode. Or, if you are like me having known of the TV show (of the same name), though never watched it, you'll pick up what's going on very quick. It definitely pushed the boundaries in terms of a 'gross out' comedy, so if you are turned off by these types of films, best to steer clear. But, for an 'Inbetweeners' novice such as myself, I really enjoyed it and highly recommend it to anyone...except maybe my parents.

Best bit?

The boys dance for the girls attention in an empty club.

Did you know?

The film set a new record for the most successful opening weekend ever achieved by a comedy film in the UK.",1330560000,2,967,4.429378531073446

8499210,3,B006J6ZOYG,"The Inbetweeners Movie takes everything great about the show and creates this slow burn cringe worthy mess
I had this blu-ray in my Amazon.uk wish list for years (was always gun shy about buying it cause i didn't think the movie would be good)
I should've trusted my self... Needless to say the import blu ray was on sale for $8.00 american dollars so one less item in my wish list
Talk about a waste of $

I love the tv series but, this is nothing like the series
Maybe I'm to old to understand what makes this film a comedy

Three of the characters seem to be cranked out to 10 on being just unaware loathing human beings
Are they saying that Millennials are all hopeless out of touch smocks???
Almost all the characters are despicable (People are disappointing in real life i get it) But, almost all these characters are unrealistic
parodies of bad people

As much as i hated American Pie (That runs circles around this)
A poor excuse for a teen sex comedy even by today's lazy standards
Massive let down and a terrible way to close out the series  5/10",1453593600,,1056,4.4
