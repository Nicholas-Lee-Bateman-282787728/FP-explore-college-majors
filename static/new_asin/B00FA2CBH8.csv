5972822,5,B00FA2CBH8,"I just watched this today and I loved it. It is from Mary's point of view and its very realistic. She's scared unsure, her parents are terrified for her and doubt everything she is saying. Joseph is very reluctant and doubts as well.  This is not a squeaky clean kids book its about how real people would react. The acting is very good. The various characters such as the wisemen and the shepard have a more important back story. The only thing I wish they would have done was use some angel lighting for when Gabriel shows up he appears and disappears only and not on camera it would have been nice to have seen that but again realism on this film so who knows maybe that was how it happened appeared one second gone the next. The gal playing Marry was really great and had to be because this was definitly her front and center. I might also note the costumes top notch and again realistic in texture and quality. This was not like the 50's and 60's Bible epics were the costumes were so perfect that it didn't look right. These costumes were worn and aged. Overall the entire production had this look to it and it made it all the better. One of the best versions I've ever seen and most honest. I'll be buying it forsure and adding it to my Christmas movie traditions yearly.",1419379200,9,1277,4.343096234309623

5972825,2,B00FA2CBH8,"Biblically accurate? Enough. HISTORICALLY accurate? Ummm... The events portrayed were supposed to take place two THOUSAND years ago. Dyes would have been plant-based, leading to muted colors, not to mention probably expensive. Yet this world was clothed in vivid chartreuse, purples, and even PRINTS! Even the villagers of backwoods Nazareth wore bright reds and blues (indigo dye was a luxury product!). The clothing all looks garish and modern--the Magis' tent seems to have been furnished at Pier 1. (Maybe they had tasseled umbrellas 2000 years ago. But I'm having a hard time believing it.) Of course, equally bad are Joseph's white clothes that somehow remain white while he works in the swirling dust as a carpenter. The Nativity Story's portrayal of a world of dirty grey seems much more likely to be accurate than this Technicolor Dreamcoat world. I'm sure for many people these seem trite details, but for me, I couldn't feel like I was getting closer to the real experience of Mary and Joseph when it felt like a theatrical retelling rather than an attempt to imagine what their lives were really like. Like, I'm at what's supposed to be the moving birth scene and I'm intrigued by the idea that Joseph was able to find a woman to help--sure, it's not mentioned in the Bible, but maybe it just went without saying--of course she needed the help of another woman!--but I'm too distracted by the woman's flower-print dress and brightly colored eyeliner to get into the scene.

Everyone seems too well-off. Mary has her own bedroom! The Nativity Story's portrayal of Nazareth as impoverished as a result of Herod's taxes brought home the reality of Judea being an occupied country much more than I got out of this film.

And further, Joseph is a fine actor--but he looks about as likely to be a Middle Eastern Jew as ... well, he just doesn't. And again, if we're trying for a work of history here--even just our best guess at history--this just sticks out in a very distracting way. Again, unlike The Nativity Story, most of the actors here don't seem Middle Eastern at all--even Mary with her dark curly hair doesn't really look right. (And if you don't believe this is history, think of it as historical fiction--it still needs accurate casting....though I'm not honestly sure why you'd want to watch it if you didn't believe.)

In terms of taking license with the story, I can live with moving Joseph's dream exonerating Mary until later in the show to increase suspense--but the rationale for having her travel with him to Bethlehem was weak in the extreme--how on earth was arriving in a small town where she knew no one, pregnant and unmarried, going to help Mary? And I'm NOT going to give you a pass on how pregnant she was--a woman soon to give birth looks like she's smuggling a beach ball--Mary on the road to Bethlehem looks the way people like pregnant women to look--about 6 months. And she walks like she's not pregnant at all. Because Joseph's mad at her, she's not riding the donkey--and I'm sorry, there's NO WAY a woman who was about to give birth walked 100 miles, or even most of 100 miles.

I thought it would be interesting to see another imagining of the human side of the Nativity--I certainly don't think The Nativity Story is THE perfect ""what it must have been like""--but this one just didn't work for me at all. The first time I saw TNS, I thought once would be enough, but I was drawn to watch that one again this Christmas. This one--once is too many times.",1454112000,2,3497,4.709150326797386
5972826,3,B00FA2CBH8,"My problem with the film is:  why do we always have to modernize historical depictions?  The actors sound more like a squabbling 21st century couple from Manchester than 2 young Jewish people, caught up in a frightening situation.  There were parts I thoroughly enjoyed, but the modern-sounding and acting Mary and Joseph kept taking me out of the movie.",1430265600,3,354,4.966101694915254

5972832,5,B00FA2CBH8,I love this movie!  It is the best one so far!  I bought 5 more and sent them as Chrismas Gifts.  Right on with the Bible. I would rate this for ALL ages.  It gives gentle and true understanding of events leading up to the birth of Jesus. With the subtitle captioning you do not miss anything!,1419897600,4,293,4.087719298245614

8613673,1,B00FA2CBH8,"Ha ha. We were looking for a ""new"" nativity story, but this was terrible. I repeat, terrible. If you want to see a good nativity movie, go with ""the Nativity Story."" Although if you watch 2015's Ex Machina, it's disturbing to see ""Joseph"" from ""The Nativity Story"" as a robot-building sociopath. :-)",1458604800,,299,4.769230769230769
