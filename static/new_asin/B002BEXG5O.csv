8361313,4,B002BEXG5O,"I'm sure this documentary will not be to everyone's liking but the man lived an interesting life. His story is told truthfully, warts and all ( he would say sins and all). His artistic talent is genuine. A worthwhile documentary for those who like Outsider Art.",1438819200,,261,4.695652173913044
8361314,5,B002BEXG5O,"""God and art saved the Reverend Albert.""

And he needed saving. Albert Wagner did some awful, terrible things in his life. Subsequently, his art is raw and truthful; a purging of his soul. The many lines found in his work are like road maps to a spiritual awakening. His ideas are often controversial, but even those are thoughtfully handled throughout the film.

Other interesting quotes from this great documentary of American history:

""The walk to school was long. Me, my brothers and the other Black sharecroppers children had to cross obstacles to get there.""

""Was I anybody? Am I anybody? Will I ever be anybody?""

""...at the time I was having kids, They didn't have birth control pills...If it did, I'd a been a junkie right now.""
(Magnolia Wagner, the Reverend's wife who had 16 of his 20 children)

""Aint nobody on Earth responsible for your soul but yourself. That's what my work is about.""

""...God started to guide my hand to paint. I had to leave my sinful ways behind and begin anew. It was time for me to go forth. Time to show my true self.""

""I feel that God has forgiven me for all of my sins.""",1381708800,,1114,4.535

8361316,5,B002BEXG5O,"Director Tom Miller has made one of the most interesting documentaries of the last few years.  This movie dissects the shocking life of one of America's premiere folk artists.  This movie is insightful, witty, poignant, dramatic and perfectly made.  Bravo to Tom Miller and his wonderful film crew!  Perfect movie!",1254787200,3,314,5.22
8361317,5,B002BEXG5O,"I have seen this documentary several times and each time come away deeply affected by its emotional impact.  It is an engrossing story of the transformation of a man through his artistic exploration.  Outsider art, which has gained real currency in recent years, has a power all its own. This is also seen in  ""Inside Out""  a documentary by Cindy Kleine's that so effectively captures the intriguing nature of this art form.  Clearly Mr. Mingo is unable to connect to the art form and thereby misses the premise and the power of Thomas Millers' sensitive and well honed documentary.  Highly recommended!",1254787200,5,603,4.920792079207921
