1371316,5,B00004Y6C2,I own this video and have watched it several times since my parents bought it for me in 1987. It was my favorite then and is definately on my top ten list now. Lots of action as well as humour and if you went to school in the 80s this movie will bring back a lot of memories. Great movie! A steal at $9.99,972518400,4,305,3.78125
1371317,4,B00004Y6C2,"A Grease storyline with modern day setting (in which gangs weren't as ""nice"" as they used to be).  I happened upon this movie by chance about 13 years ago and I have seen it at least 20 times since.  The music in this film is excellent.  A must have for those still collecting VHS.  Definitely worth the price!",970963200,,310,4.293103448275862
1371338,5,B00004Y6C2,"I discovered this movie on pure accident and can't believe it's not more popular. It's a stew of every 80s movie ever made and honestly seemed to inspire most John Hughes movies that came after it.  I loved Kim Richards in this movie; she should have been a bigger name during that time.

Since watching for the first time two months ago I have watched Tuff Turf five times as I recruit other 80s fans to watch it.",1465257600,,414,4.294871794871795

1371344,5,B00004Y6C2,"There movie is in my top ten under rates movies. To see James Spader and Robert Downing Jr at the start of their careers and ""little"" Kim Richards all grown up. Here you have a person who family lost it all in the early eighties only to move west for a new start. While on his way home Spader breaks up a mugging and in doing so incurs the wrath of the gang. To make matters worse he falls for the leader's girlfriend. One of the funniest  is Spader attends a rave and arrives in style in a luxury sports card. He is jumped by the gang and their leader takes the keys and triumphly walks away. His friend Downing Jr says: ""Sorry about your card."" When Spader answers: ""I don't have a car."" Sure enough the misfits are pulled over for GTA leaving the path wide open to the girl. At first it is the traditional rejection but after awhile MS Richards realizes there is another world out there and she doesn't have to accept being some miscreant's ""old-lady"". Of course you have the climatic closure and they all lived happily everafter.",1440201600,,1033,4.352331606217617
1371345,5,B00004Y6C2,Thanks,1439596800,,6,6.0
1371346,5,B00004Y6C2,"I agree. Whether a Spader or Downey, Jr. fan, you'll love this as they both have terrific roles and are excellent in those roles. A by-the-book teen angst drama made special by the casting. (Nice direction and editing as well) I disagree with one of the reviewers who said that the two male leads might be embarrassed by this film now because they went on to serious careers. Why be embarrassed about starring in a pretty decent high school drama when you're starting out in the business?  Nothing but good here.",1438732800,,512,4.626373626373627

1371351,5,B00004Y6C2,The movie that made me realize that James Spader had so much talent! Young Robert Downey Jr is great in this movie also. It has action for the guys and romance for the girls. A great soundtrack for the music lover and a great cast for the movie lover. 80's movie at its finest. Make sure you pick this one up because it will probably not make the transition to BLU Ray.,1430092800,,369,4.138888888888889

1371353,5,B00004Y6C2,One of my favorite movies of all time. It brings back memories of when I had just started at a new school and how the new guy can be the cool one that gets the girl. Cool to see spader and Kim Richards when they were young and sexy. Kim now looks like a catchers mit but was sexy at one time and could dance and act so she hasn't al been a lush. Anyone that likes housewives of Beverly h will like to see her in her youth. It's a silly 80s movie with lots of cool class and style. I can watch it over and over.,1427068800,,510,3.7314814814814814

1371378,2,B00004Y6C2,"I enjoyed taking a trip back down memory lane and back to the 80's. This was a fun movie to watch and it took me back when movies were fun. James Spader was great, action, and a killer soundtrack. The reason why I rated it two stars is because the play back was blurry in parts of the movie which was distracting away from the movie and annoying. Other than that, over all the movie would be highly recommended for that 1980's fan and new fans alike.",1404604800,,450,4.183908045977011

1371383,5,B00004Y6C2,It's something unique about the 80's that completely separate itself from the other decades. A young James Spader & a young Robert Downey Jr. What more could you ask for?,1394409600,,170,4.7
1371384,5,B00004Y6C2,This is one of my favorite movies from back in the day. James Spader just cannot catch a break in this movie. This is a must see.,1391904000,,129,3.814814814814815

1371386,5,B00004Y6C2,"My very favorite 80's movie! Dance numbers, serenades, a little bit of class issues, an amazing soundtrack, and oh boy, the eye candy. James Spader and Robert Downey Jr. are deliciously hot, and at age 13 I thought Kim Richards must have been the most woman in the world. I wish I knew why this one wasn't as popular as other 80's films, but I always enjoy introducing it to people.",1386892800,,382,4.394366197183099

1371401,5,B00004Y6C2,Spader is adorable and on  his A game right out of the box with this one.  Love his singing voice as well.,1372809600,,106,3.772727272727273
1371402,4,B00004Y6C2,"I never saw this movie growing up in the 80's and it wasn't until an online review before I even knew this movie existed.  Having said that, I'm glad I didn't see this as a teen in the 80's as I doubt I would have enjoyed it.  The acting is overly dramatic, the plot is predictable start to finish and the soundtrack is forgetable.  That is what my teenage self would have said.  My adult self however, just loved this movie.  It was basically everything you remember about 80's movies in a single two hour serving.

I found myself fondly remembering my time in decade, and singing along to the soundtrack.  Yes, you will shake your head a few times at the over-the-top script and acting, but two minutes later you will be smiling at your repressed memory of the 80's.

If you are a fan of the 80's, or grew up in the 80's, do yourself a favor and watch this movie.  You won't regret the time spent.",1372550400,2,899,4.272189349112426

1371418,5,B00004Y6C2,Great 80's Flick!  Not many people know about this movie but if you like 80's flicks its a must see.  James Spader and Robert Downey Jr. at their BEST!,1330905600,,151,4.172413793103448

1371422,4,B00004Y6C2,"Love this movie. At the price that I got it for on Amazon, it was a no-brainer especially when I can't find it anywhere else including Netflix and Blockbuster. The only things that I don't like about this movie is it's not available on Bluray yet and one of my favorite songs in the movie was changed with another version of the same titled song but sang by a different singer. Other than that, I enjoyed it now just as much as I did when I was a teenager. Who would have thought back then that James Spader, Robert Downey Jr and Kim Richards would become such great actors in the future and land some pretty notable jobs (Iron Man, Boston Legal, etc.... today?

1371424,5,B00004Y6C2,"This movie, although very over-the-top, wasn't any cheesier than other teen eighties films considered classics today. I read the overly harsh reviews from critics and audiences alike and agree that it is completely out there, but it was a fun viewing experience. I bought the DVD because I'm a fan of Spader and Downey and I'm surprised it doesn't receive more attention simply because it provides evidence of some of their earliest roles. I purchased a used copy but you can't tell as it's in excellent condition. If you're a fan of the actors or teen cinema and willing to let the film critic that we all pretend to be rest for a couple of hours, sit back and enjoy Tuff Turf.",1310256000,,678,4.565573770491803

It is really funny. You know... 80's funny. Like, cheesy. Totally. But it is amusing enough to enjoy, especially if you are a Robert Downey Jr. or James Spader fan. If you like cheesy, this movie is for you.",1308787200,,352,4.1911764705882355

1371441,5,B00004Y6C2,"To all fans of Kim Richards and a young nobody(James Spader). This good guy, bad guy 80's movie captures some of the previous high school movies flair, such as Reckless, Karate kid and My Bodyguard except with it's own unique spin with a beautiful Frankie (Kim Richards)and Morgan(James Spader)just moving from a rich area in Connecticut to a middle class area in Los Angeles. The backdrop are areas of Los Angeles's San Fernando valley and some parts of Beverly Hills and West L.A. ala Karate Kid area. Frankie plays Nick's girlfriend who still stinging from her mother's death, mixes up with Nick and plays bait to hold up unsuspecting men for money. With an excellent movie soundtrack featuring the late Jim Carroll and Jack Mack and the Heart Attack, it throws in just enough comical pinnings to make this somewhat serious teen movie have a light edge. What makes this movie attractive are the actors and the excellent performance of Paul Mones who plays the bad guy Nick and his never ending pursuit of Morgan because of the threat to take his girlfriend away and him to lose control of his repuation as the bully. Also Ironman (Robert Downey Jr.) plays Morgan's best friend Jimmy who also plays drums for two Jim Carroll songs. This movie was not advertised to the mainstream but ended up being a very popular movie with a solid story and good perfomances by Paul Mones and James Spader and a young Robert Downey.",1274140800,,1419,4.725806451612903

Kim Richards from all those kids movies is all grown up. Plus, an appearance by one of the coolest bands, Jack Mack & the Heart Attack. They almost steal the show! I highly recomend it to anyone who was around in the 80's. Lets not forget Jim Carroll, just Too Cool. It is a lot uf fun and has lots of action, too.",1256169600,,452,4.206896551724138

I had remembered young James Spader's performance but could not remember the female lead.  I still haven't figured out why I forgot Kim Richards who was outstanding in the role.  A young Robert Downy steals scenes as he still does today with his talent.  The best part of the movie is the music.  Filming music performers at their best saves them and their music for posterity.  I loved this movie!,1236556800,,511,4.489130434782608

1371459,2,B00004Y6C2,"I find it difficult to feel strongly about this film one way or the other because there just isn't much there. Newcomer and rich kid James Spader moves to a new town, pretends he's a rebel and quickly makes enemies with the local high school hoodlums. Being too darn smart for his own good, he falls for Lead Hoodlum's best girl. Lo and behold, she dreams of a better life and likes him right back, but is too afraid of Lead Hoodlum to trade up. Yawn. Spader's faux bad boy act wears thin very quickly and the cheese oozes rather heavily, though Kim Richards (aka Paris Hilton's aunt) is awfully cute and offers the film's only redeeming value. Whether or not one watches depends on one's desire to see Kim.",1154995200,6,707,4.446153846153846
1371460,5,B00004Y6C2,"Here is a great movie for those 80's fans out there. With a young James Spader in the lead role, you will love the action of a young man who doesn't fit the role his mother would like him to be. So the family have moved to a new town and to another school. He quickly finds himself falling for the tough bullie's girlfriend and some major trouble. Best scene is where he thinks he is being chased by a car and it's actually his friend driving it looking for him. Definitely a movie for the die hard 80's fans.

It's a shame that some of their careers didn't last longer.  But as for James Spader, whether the character he plays is good or bad, he's still gorgeous and a great actor.

When I purchased this movie, I thought mainly of my husband's interest.  When my children watched it, they liked the movie too.  My son likes the music and the wardrobe.  He thinks it's cool.",1142985600,,487,4.393258426966292
1371464,3,B00004Y6C2,"Everybody has to start somewhere, and while Tuff Turf (1985) wasn't James Spader's first film, I do believe it was the first film he actually had the lead role in as Morgan Hiller, possibly the world's oldest high school student (Spader was about 25 years of age when he appeared in this film).  Directed by Fritz Kiersch (Children of the Corn, Gor), the film features, along with Spader, popular child actress Kim Richards (Escape to Witch Mountain, Meatballs Part II), Paul Mones (Streets of Fire), Matt Clark (White Lightning, Brubaker), Claudette Nevins (Sleeping with the Enemy), and the miracle of modern science Robert Downey Jr. (Weird Science, Back to School)...seriously, I'm surprised this guy is still around, given his love for both legal (alcohol) and illegal substances.

As the movie begins we see Morgan Hiller (Spader) riding his ten-speed bicycle through the dark, busy L.A. city streets sans any reflective clothing (kids, don't try this at home...it may seem cool, but how cool is it to be laid up in a hospital for six months when you get creamed by a car?)...anyway, we see some gang members (I use the term `gang' loosely here, as they're the typically 80s gang types, sporting bandanas and rough trade clothing, the kind that wouldn't last five minutes in the real world) rousting a businessman.  Morgan rides through and breaks up the action, raising the ire of the faux punks, who vow vengeance.  Turns out Morgan and his family were once well-to-do Connecticut types, until his father, played by Clark, lost his business, and they since had to relocate to the comparatively modest setting of  L.A.'s inner city (Morgan's mother, played by Nevins, is as WASPy as they come, and seems to be taking the adjustment harder than the rest).  As Morgan attends his first day at the local high school, the gang from the night before, lead by Nick (Mones), take notice, and begin giving him a hard time, especially after Morgan takes a shine to Nick's girlfriend Frankie, played by Richards.  After this a number of things happen like a choreographed number during a rock concert at an abandoned warehouse, a dead rat in a locker, Morgan and Frankie crashing a posh country club affair (complete with Morgan serenading Frankie on the piano...oh geez), someone gets shot, Morgan puts the moves on Frankie, and so on, leading up to the final showdown between Nick and Morgan, and, as per the tagline for the film, we learn `tuff turf' is `where enemies are made, reputations are earned and love is the most risky affair of all'...or something like that...

Well, I'll say this for Tuff Turf, it's certainly steeped in the 80s... bandanas, fried hair, too much make-up, fingerless gloves, studded belts, rayon shirts, hi-top sneakers, painters caps, hand cuffs used as accessories, an over abundance of synthesized music (there's a `synthesizer realization' credit at the end, which, to me was a fancy way of saying `keyboardist'), and so on...the movie was okay, but there seemed to be just a bit too much crammed into the story, causing the film to run a lot longer than it needed to...there's the main plot device in the love triangle between Morgan, Frankie, and Nick, and then there's various subplots that don't really go anywhere like Morgan being compared to his more successful older brother, friction between Morgan and his mother, Morgan and Frankie coming from different sides of the tracks, the angle of Morgan's family once being wealthy and now having to `slum' it, Frankie still dealing with the passing of her mother, etc.  Seemed like all of these secondary elements were touched upon as to try and force some sort of character development, but none of them were ever really explored to properly do so...in my opinion, much of this could have been left out, and the film would have worked much better.  Also, that lengthy, choreographed dance number at the warehouse, along with Spader's character impromptu piano serenade towards Frankie at the country club (by the way, I highly doubt that was Spader actually singing), were two things I could have done without, but then I'm not really big on ill-fitting musical numbers.  One aspect that really annoyed the hell out of me was the crummy, zen-like, new age bunk passed off by a couple of the characters in the film.  In one scene, Morgan's father, the once wealthy businessman, now cabbie, passes along this little nugget...""Life isn't a problem to be solved, it's a mystery to be lived, so live it!""  Uh, yeah, okay...seeing as how he was once a rich and powerful leader of industry, now reduced to (gasp!) driving a cab (night shift, no less), I'd be pretty reluctant to take any advice from him.  Another scene has Morgan spewing out the following line...""I don't think you can hold on to anything until you let it go.""  Just what the hell does that mean?  It sounds pretty...overall, the performances aren't that bad (Kim Richards is awful easy on the eyes), if you can buy off on that Spader's supposed to be a high school student.  Paul Mones, who played the main antagonist Nick, was a bit over the top for my tastes, but then there's always one in a movie like this.  The funniest aspect for me was Morgan's mother, played by Claudette Nevins...she had obviously yet to fully come to terms with her new, modest surroundings, maintaining her country clubbish attitudes that were way beyond her and her families' current means.  Robert Downey Jr.'s part was meager, and was more or less the same character he played in the film Back to School (1986), only in that latter film it was more realized.  Overall Tuff Turf is decent, but it could have been a lot better had they lost a few of the clunkier elements of the story and tightened up the running time (the film runs nearly an hour and forty-five minutes).  If you want to see a better film from the 80s with Spader (as the baddie), I'd suggest checking out The New Kids (1985), recently released onto DVD.

The picture quality, presented in widescreen (1.85:1) anamorphic, on this Anchor Bay Entertainment DVD release looks sharp and clean, and the Dolby Digital 2.0 audio comes through well, with no complaints.  The only extras included are a theatrical trailer and an insert booklet featuring a still photo collage from the movie.

Tuff Turf has a great cast, great acting, cool music, great fight scenes, and of course shows James Spader in his best movie moment when he sings to Kim Richards! Ahhh!!!

James Spader is fantastic in this movie, and he looks hot even when he's beat up.

Kim Richards is so hot and her long hair realy defines her character!

Robert Downey Jr. Comon!!!He's awesome!!!

And of course Jack Mack and the Heart Attack comon putting them in your movie is pure genius!

The movie is really well done for its time period, although the majority of the music chosen for the film doesn't age well.
James Spader plays a sort of underdog hero role in this film compared to some of his other teen oriented 80's films where he's the antagonist.  He's new in town, and foils a mugging that is taking place.  This sets him up as the target for the local gang.  Which is pretty much what half the movie is about, how the gang wants to get him, and how he foils their attempts.  The other half is the budding romance of Spader and Richards.  Kim Richards plays the gang leaders girl friend and slowly falls for Spader.  Downey has a few small appearances, but barely seems like he's in the movie.
The story is very predictable for the most part, but is still fun to watch.
I would say buy it if you like 80's, teen or underdog movies.",1073433600,15,1004,4.149484536082475

1371479,5,B00004Y6C2,"When people are asked to name great 80's teen movies, they will almost invariably list THE BREAKFAST CLUB, 16 CANDLES, PRETTY IN PINK, etc. But no one will ever mention TUFF TURF. I wonder why this is? In fact, I'd never heard of this movie until my boyfriend showed it to me. Talk about the most underrated flick of all time! One look at it immediately took me back to my own 80's teenagehood. Did anyone notice how typical of the decade the girls dressed? Forget Molly Ringwald; she wasn't 80's. She was Pat Benatar's ""Love is a Battlefield"" look mixed with some kind of post-modern late-80's/early 90's get-up. If you want bona-fide 80's fashion, take a look at Frankie, a.k.a. Kim Richards, of TUFF TURF. Also, there were a requisite number of mullets in this movie, more than in any other 80's flick I can think of. These are the reasons I consider TUFF TURF to be the premier movie of the 80's.
I got a kick out of Robert Downey Jr., who looked no older than a middle schooler!
The story line works well. I felt sorry for Morgan Hiller and his family b/c they had sunk to such new socioeconomic lows; however, I think Morgan's travails are an entirely realistic depiction of what a kid in his situation would go through and how he would react to it.
Marianne Faithful sings the haunting theme song during the movie's opening segment. Yes, that's actually a WOMAN singing, not Ozzie with a sore throat!",1039737600,11,1407,4.52156862745098
1371480,5,B00004Y6C2,"This film has remained a favorite of mine since the first time I saw it on the big screen.  James Spader has also remained possibly my favorite actor of all time since I fell for his incredible face after seeing IT for the first time here as well.

James Spader plays Morgan Hiller, the cute(!!!!) new guy at a highschool in a seedy part of Los Angeles.  Immediately Morgan incenses the town gang by ruining a heist they're pulling by going by on his bicycle and spray-painting Paul Mones who plays the gang leader.  His girlfriend played by child actress almost grown-up Kim Fields, is secretly amused by Morgan's nerve.  Never one to back off, Morgan sees what he wants, and goes for the girl.  The result is a dangerous ""Turf"" war between the Spader and Mones characters that lead to an eventual showdown over Fields.

Robert Downey Jr. plays a great role here as well as Spaders' loyal new pal in town.  He sticks with his buddy Morgan until the bitter end.

There is great atmosphere and pacing in this film. It truly has no dull moments.  The leads are well cast, and VERY easy on the eyes.  The story makes you really care about the characters, a sure sign of quality filmakng in my book.  Spader as Morgan Hiller is particularly excellent here.  After seeing this in the theatre, I knew he would become a star.  A funny note, Spaders tattoo of a Spade on his upper arm is seen here in a locker room scene.  It is also seen in the great Rowdy Herrington classic ""Jack's Back.""  It is NOT seen however in ""White Palace"" or ""Dream Lover"" despite the nude scenes in both.  Was it removed, or covered?  I don't know about that, but I DO know that ""Tuff Turf"" remains as fresh a teen angst love story now, as it was nearly 20 years ago.  For any James Spader or Robert Downey Jr. fan, this is a must see film.",1011916800,6,1811,4.352238805970149

1371483,5,B00004Y6C2,"BUY IT !!! IT'S A STEAL AT THIS PRICE. Besides it never was sold to television and I hear that Spader and the others may be embarrased by it since he and Downey Jr. went on to have  ""serious"" acting careers. I have looked for it forever and I have never seen it on the late nite movies but it would be perfect for that. Former child star Kim Richards (Witch Mountain and numerous Disney Movies/Hello Larry sitcom/Meatballs II) plays a girl from the wrong side of the tracks who falls for a new boy in town played by James Spader. He is immediately befriended by a class clown played by Downey Jr. upon arriving to his new high school. When Kim's street-gang leader boyfriend played well by Paul Mones (actor/ writer/director of the excellent teen/coming of age flick: ""The Beat"", find it on vhs if you can, although I did catch it on late nite t.v. once) then all you know what starts between Mones and Spader. The movie plays out kinda like a cross between ""Rebel Without A Cause"" and ""West Side Story"".  But overall ""Tuff Turf"" is truly alot of fun. The music is diverse and plentiful (Jim Carroll, Lena Lovich, Jack Mack and the Heart Attack) and really great throughout the movie as is the fine score by the now renowned film composer Jonathan Elias. Poet, Novelist, and Musician (The Basketball Diaries) Jim Carroll actually makes a rare cameo appearance and Kim always an angel to me gets to look sexy finally in a more mature acting(non-Disney) role.

It really is a must-have if you like Downey films at all, or even if you don't.

Really enjoyed reliving some of the styles and teenagers proven as bad. Too bad John Hughes couldn't help with some of the dialogue to make it more realistic. I mean, who got married at 17 back in the day? So, there are some stale plot devices that really didn't apply to 80s teens, but there is the rich boy on the wrong side of the tracks conflict that is found in a lot of 80s teen movies.
