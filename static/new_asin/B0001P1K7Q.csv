2023422,5,B0001P1K7Q,"We love ""What's In the Bible?!"" This is #5 in the series. I've been buying these for my 2 small nephews, and the impact they are having on my entire family is profound. The characters are cute & funny & the kids love to follow them from one volume to the next. Best of all, the adults in my family are also drawn in. The format is entertaining and disarmingly informative.... I love the way they tackle the ""tricky questions,"" issues in the Bible that are often perceived as contradictory. It is a joy to share ""What's in the Bible"" with my family!",1353888000,4,548,4.330097087378641

2023425,5,B0001P1K7Q,"My children (ages 3 & 5 as of this reading) love What's in the Bible and even my wife and I are learning a lot through the series.  The fun and innovative series is mainly puppets discussing the bible chronologically.  This video has two parts:

1)  Samuel, Saul, and David's beginning (1 Samuel)

2)  David and Soloman (2 Samuel, 1 Kings)

This DVD was one of the most amazing because it didn't shy away from the sin in David's life but discussed it and embraced his repentent heart.  They showed how David was after God's own heart and repented when he sinned.  They discussed the consequences of his sin.

I highly recommend this to all of my kid's friends and have found it applies well to older kids as old as 9 years old.",1326326400,,727,4.358208955223881

It's not great because of cinematography or special effects, it's great because (like all Phil Vischer's creations) it's clever, funny, and gets the point across clearly. My 8 year old son understands stuff about the Bible far better than I did even in high school. Get all of these in the series!",1317945600,3,418,4.739726027397261

The above link is another great Kratt Brother Program.

Kratt's Creatures is the first program created by the Kratt brothers. Unfortunately, it's very hard to find the show in stock; this is the only videotape that I've found that is in stock. So if you want a couple of Kratt's Creatures episodes and this VHS is still in stock, I suggest you buy it because I don't think they have many in stock. This was my favorite show growing up and was very disappointed when they took it off the air. And when I found out about the VHSs', it was too late. Fortunately, this one recently came in stock and I happened to stumble upon it.

The reason this is such a great show is that the Kratt Brothers not only know a lot about animals but they obviously care about them so much and they love all creatures and it really shows in how they present the creatures in their programs including this one.

If you love animals, you'll love Kratt's Creatures.",1188172800,4,1215,5.412698412698413

2023432,5,B0001P1K7Q,"Let me start off by saying that the What's in the Bible DVDs are just outstanding. I am a mother of three and I homeschool all my children. I'm always looking for ways to make learning fun for them, especially when in comes to learning the Bible. I don't always want to stick a boring text book in front of them. I look for fun ways to engage them and hold their attention. The biblical doctrine is spot on as well so I don't have to worry about them being taught wrongly.
With this DVD, they don't even realize they are learning! Within minutes of putting this dvd in the house is filled with laughter and giggles. We also own the previous four DVDs that come before this one and my seven year old daughter is actually the one who bought this. She used her own birthday money to purchase this! That should show how awesome this series is. We definitely intend to invest in more of these in the future.",1460505600,,902,4.280701754385965

2023448,5,B0001P1K7Q,"Phil Vischer is continuing his whirlwind tour of the Bible with volume 5 of What's in the Bible?  Using puppets, he's trying to put the familiar stories of the Bible in the broader context of the God's redemption plan.  It's an ambitious project that seems to be working.  Israel Gets a King! finds us looking at I and II Samuel as well as the first part of I Kings.

As always, there are two half hour programs on this DVD.  The first looks at I Samuel, the reign of King Saul and his time chasing David.  The second hour goes through the reign of King David and his son King Solomon.

As always, these shows are filled with great fun.  Captain Pete (a pirate), sings songs from his new (slightly leaky) submarine.  The story of Saul chasing David seems to involve Star Wars.  We get quite a few jokes as characters interact with each other.

But the entertainment never gets in the way of learning.  This disc tackles the doctrine of the trinity, pretty heady stuff for the elementary age target audience.  It does keep the audience in mind when it comes to some of the more serious things like David's adultery with Bathsheba.  The story is told, but in a way that won't make parents uncomfortable.

As I said, these videos focus on the big themes and not on retelling individual stories.  For example, Samuel in introduced without talking about his childhood.  He is simply introduced as a prophet who God used to anoint Saul and later David.  Saul's disobedience to God's commands are discussed in general, and Jonathan hardly merits a mention.

Obviously, there is a lot of stuff they leave out.  They have to if they are coming to cover so much ground in one hour.  However, they do a great job of picking out the important parts and weaving together an important theme.  Obviously, we're traveling through Israel's history and introducing key figures.  But the focus on Saul, David, and Solomon allows them to really focus on responses to sin.  They leave us with a challenge about how we will respond to sin in our lives.  Will we make excuses like Saul?  Will we pretend everything is normal like Solomon?  Or will we repent and turn from it like David?  Maybe it is because of some stuff I am going through personally right now, but I had never quite thought about these kings and their response to sin in quite this way.  Yes, I'd heard about David plenty of times, but contrasting him with the other two made his repentance stand out even more.

So Israel Gets a King! is another entertaining and educational chapter in the What's in the Bible? series.  It will entertain everyone while also putting some familiar stories in a greater context.

It leaves us with just one question.  Exactly how does one flunk chapel?",1429660800,,2730,4.58592132505176

2023456,5,B0001P1K7Q,"Even the menus are fun in this series. This one begins with Michael, king of the mini-van, who has escaped to do the menu.

I beseech you to do whatever it is you are supposed to do . . . he tells us as he waits for us to push a button. Funny.

Theres no dumbing things down in this series. The vocabulary is rich. The characters, quite different from each other. And though there is only one person, Phil Vischer, doing all the puppets and their voices, their personalities are distinct, from the tiny stage manager Marcie to the bass-voiced guitar-playing cowboy Chuck Waggin.

This video covers 1st and 2nd Samuel. There is some difficult material in these books. There is murder, and Davids adultery with Bathsheba, and Absalom, Davids son, turning against his father, hoping to kill him. But it is covered gently enough so even small children can explore the Bible.

A pirate, a Sunday School Lady and other puppets help to review the material covered in this series thus far. One consistent strength of this series in every volume is that each episode starts with a review, both reinforcing information, and also keeping it in context. It makes it possible to understand what is going on even if the viewer hasn't seen the previous DVDs, or it has been some time since they have been watched.

Samuel, Saul, Davids killing of Goliath, and his actions as king are covered. The scientist puppet Dr. Schniffenhousen answers the Big Question (each episode has one) about what is the Trinity?

Theology with puppets and song.

This excellent series would be great to give anyone as a gift, or to buy for yourself. With only one puppeteer doing the writing, almost all songs, plus the puppets, costs are lower than if they had used a large team.

There is an extra bonus feature on this disk, The Boy Who Cried Melon Monkey, told with Popsicle puppets. Funny.",1418342400,,1859,4.663608562691132

2023460,5,B0001P1K7Q,"I can not SAY ENOUGH about this series. I was really looking for a curriculum that my 12 yr. old and 8 yr. old could enjoy together, but this is something even my husband and I enjoy too!

We have 1-10 now and are ordering the rest. This is something we watch as a family and discuss it as part of our weekly family bible study. It has facts and history that my husband and I (both 'church kids', and I am a PK) haven't even heard before.

I am most impressed at how it gives the great overview of covenant, showing what even most adults don't see, the thread that runs through the entire bible from sin to salvation. We just finished the first New Testament DVD #10 and can not wait to get to the others. My only worry is that we are catching up to the series and will have to wait for others to come out. =)

It's a great tool for teaching kids (and adults) about the Bible.  The kids consider it funny, love the songs and characters, and like that I'm using it as part of their Homeschool Bible class this year.  It has to be viewed multiple times for it to really sink in (since it packs so much information in some episodes) but that's ok.  It make for good conversations and teaching.  I extend the learning with hands on activities in our Bible Interactive Notebook.  Just have a few more DVDs to acquire and watch.  One improvement that could be made is to have the characters speak more slowly.  The content is hard so slowing it down would be great.
