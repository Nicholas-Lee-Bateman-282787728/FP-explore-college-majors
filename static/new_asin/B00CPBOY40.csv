8584439,5,B00CPBOY40,"A great Performer: I absolutely love this DVD. I had the VHS tape for years. Very glad to have this DVD version. This was a TV special taped in a London theater in 1973.  Marlene was in her 70's but still an amazing performer. Her economy of movement, her graceful minimalist use of her hands, arms, and various poses and postures to highlight her songs was so powerful and so skillful. Burt Bacharach had done her arrangements and they musically support her beautifully. Her renditions of  La Vie En Rose, White Grass, Where have all The FlowersGone, are wonderful. The price for this DVD is a little steep...but I am happy to have a visual record of this great performer and song stylist. Marlene was not happy with this TV special. However, I think she is superb.",1488931200,,766,4.583941605839416
