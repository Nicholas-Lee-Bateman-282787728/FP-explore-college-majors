8008708,5,B00019MS14,"This is not an all-inclusive ""recipe"" video for cruising, but rather a DVD that seems to intend many of the visceral feelings and enjoyments of the Shards... There is some valuable practical techniques here and there - water reading in the shallows, anchoring techniques, chart purchasing and the like, but this is really a better DVD for those who may be trying to interest an already boating mate into cruising longer distances... This is more about recreation, rather than recounting harrowing experiences and more about symbolic examples rather than a laundry list of everything one needs to know... for its purpose, a very enjoyable few hours with little nuggets of information and the underwater photography really gives a extremely rare and unique perspective for many things from simple anchoring, navigation in the shallows to a whale watching encounter in mid-ocean...",1249948800,,878,5.2785714285714285
8008709,2,B00019MS14,This dvd is a low content production which tells the obvious. The coverage of the Bahamas was mediocre. I do not recommend this dvd for anyone who is interested in dinding out what it is like to be cruising or how to plan for such a voyage.,1202169600,,240,4.127659574468085
8008710,5,B00019MS14,"I was impressed with the actual quality of the video.  It was informative and it was helpful since my husband and I are chartering a sailboat this summer.  We will be in the Abacos which they did not cover, but there was still useful information and they did interview another couple that had been to the Abacos.  I felt like it was a good value overall.",1140566400,2,354,4.333333333333333
8008711,1,B00019MS14,"If you're looking for a low detail travel journal without much meat this is fine, if your looking for details - not even close.  For example, on the DVD it says they talk about fishing.  To me that means a little talk about bait, time of day, what to look for in a fishing spot - there was 3 minutes of watching some guy bring in fish.  I had thought the first thing they'd mention when planning their trip across the Atlantic they'd mention how long it would take - you have to back track the math about 15 minutes into the trip.  This DVD was VERY disappointing.",1113177600,4,564,4.194444444444445
8008712,5,B00019MS14,"A very enjoyable DVD. The Shards put the viewer right on the deck of their sailboat ""Two Step"" as they explore the Bahamas and the Azores. Many travel video producers hire actor/hosts to visit the beautiful far away places they are filming who then hop back on a plane after reading the last page of the script. Paul and Sheryl Shard actually live the lifestyle of the cruising sailor. They really enjoy what they are doing. It's not just a job. They dive among the sharks in the Bahamas, they rent scooters in Georgetown and they show us proper handling of a sailboat and the maintenance and upkeep involved when it is your method of travel and your home. Watching ""Cruising With The Shards"" with my wife convinced us that we too could break the ties to dry land and explore the world in a way that is much more exciting than just getting on a plane, swimming in a hotel pool and fly home a week later. I definately recommend this DVD. Not just to those thinking of sailing to new lands, but also to anyone who may not want to cross oceans themselves but still want to learn what it takes to cruise beyond their own backyard. A first rate production!",1111190400,3,1151,4.408450704225352
8008713,5,B00019MS14,"Great DVD series. The Shards do a fantastic job of taking you along on their cruising adventures. I love sailing and have learned a great deal from watching the episodes. These are first class travel logos. I highly recommend them. Nothing better out there. Full of lots of helpful tips and places to go.

If the Bahamas is where your going get this DVD.",1106092800,3,354,4.53125
