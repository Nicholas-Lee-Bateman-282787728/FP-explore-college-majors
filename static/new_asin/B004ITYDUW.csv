4388222,5,B004ITYDUW,"Fantastic Video!  One of the most beautiful and amazing documentaries ever produced.  As with the stores of Shangri-La in the film, this film arguably captures the magic of such a place.  There are moments of true awe and amazement where you will be asking yourself, how did they captured that moment.  PBS NATURE has struck gold with this one!",1297555200,19,344,4.779661016949152
4388223,4,B004ITYDUW,"Gorgeous, inspiring.  Too much recycled video from Planet Earth though.  The snow leopard chase down a mountainside where the prey escapes into a river, etc.",1391385600,6,157,5.24
4388224,5,B004ITYDUW,"We see snow leopards, wolves and bears, monkeys and foxes as well as spiders, snakes, giant bees and high flying birds, all in HD.",1372464000,,130,4.458333333333333
4388225,5,B004ITYDUW,"The photography was excellent, I saw animals in this video I never knew existed. The chase of the Snow leopard was riviting!",1372377600,,124,4.681818181818182
4388226,5,B004ITYDUW,"LOVE IT...THE SCENERY IS OUT OF THIS WORLD....NEVER DREAMED THERE WAS SO MUCH ACTIVITY IN THE MOUNTAINS...
THIS IS A MUST BUY FOR YOUNG CHILDREN.......",1362355200,,151,5.08
4388227,5,B004ITYDUW,"After watching and listening to this DVD, my only wish is that I had gotten in it Blu-ray, though the DVD quality is very good.  The narration is calm and pleasant, describing a world where due the cold climate and thin air, species tend to be more interdependent with family members, and at times, other species.

My favorite is the sly looking Tibetan fox, though all animals seen here are amazing in their adaptability.",1356739200,,422,4.6891891891891895
4388228,1,B004ITYDUW,"This is an extremely disappointing product. Most of the footages were actually taken from the ""Wild China"" series by BBC, and the other ones do not look like HD images at all.
Narration is poor, the script is also bad. In short: do not buy this.",1331337600,23,245,4.3478260869565215
4388229,4,B004ITYDUW,"We really enjoyed this film about the life in the Himalayas.
I've seen it twice and happy to won it.",1331337600,,100,4.05
4388230,5,B004ITYDUW,"If you're one of those people who can look at the natural world without thinking it needs development, then this particular edition of PBS's Nature is well worth having in your library for multiple viewings.",1330732800,3,207,4.942857142857143
4388231,5,B004ITYDUW,"great movie - showed up on time, in great condition. Nature/PBS programs are always the best. More detailed than most.",1325376000,4,118,4.95
4388232,2,B004ITYDUW,"The original ""The Himalayas"" is a BBC HD production lovingly narrated by Sir David Attenborough. Well, the visuals are the same (and simply stunning) but only in America would the narration be changed to someone else (an unnamed voice actor). His narration is flat and uninteresting and his timing does not match the visuals. The script and music are the same as the original BBC programme.

I'm British living in America and I have found this weird anomaly of voice swap quite a bit with documentaries - overdubbing Oprah Winfrey for Sir David Attenborough in another BBC HD programme and so on. Why, I will never know. I simply find it annoying. And with the ludicrous Blu-ray Region locking (and incompatible 1080i/50hz), I can't just buy the BBC originals from England and play them in America.

Oh well... more money wasted.

Don't buy if you are expecting Sir David, otherwise it's worth a look for the outstanding BBC cinematography.",1309046400,73,940,4.89937106918239
8431204,4,B004ITYDUW,I was satisfied.,1510790400,,16,4.666666666666667
8431205,4,B004ITYDUW,"If you've never seen snow leopards this DVD has quite a few good scenes and in one you can hear them purring. That was worth watching this documentary which explores the vast area of The Himalayas. I felt this was a stunning visual feast with poetic narration. You will see glaciers, wolves traversing the terrain and even some really funny goats. They could have made this 100% happy but instead they do show some animals hunting their prey. So I would not recommend this for children as they might not like those scenes. For adults we have to face the harsh realities of nature. So for that I took off one star. Otherwise this was great and very educational. If you want to see more of The Himalayas you might want to watch the ""Winter: Music of the Falling Snowflakes"" DVD by musical aura. I love the first track called Date with Himalayas. It is stunning.
