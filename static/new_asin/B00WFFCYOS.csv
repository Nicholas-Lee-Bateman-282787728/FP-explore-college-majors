8713053,5,B00WFFCYOS,"You can almost call this a slice of life with a fantasy twist. Certainly aimed more towards the girls that want something similar, if not slightly more light hearted, to Kamisama Kiss.

A light drama with comedy to it, the story focuses on a school girl named Inari, a shy, plain girl who always visits the local shrine, even just to hang out. On one such day she saves a fox pup from drowning in one of the shrine's ponds. Later on she is approached by two foxes who thank her for saving the pup from before and tell her the Goddess of the Shrine wishes to grant her a wish. The goddess thanks her since most normally can't see the foxes, or even the goddess. But due to Inari's deep love for the shrine she has developed the sight. So the goddess grants her a wish. Inari uses the wish, turning her into a popular girl at school. Later she returns when the wish ends up causing trouble and begs her to change her back into her normal self. This task is impossible for the goddess to do because of certain rules, but she bends them by giving a portion of her power to Inari. This enables to transform Inari into any living thing and back at will. The series follows Inari on the adventures she has with this power and her friendship with the goddess.",1438732800,22,1251,4.2784810126582276
