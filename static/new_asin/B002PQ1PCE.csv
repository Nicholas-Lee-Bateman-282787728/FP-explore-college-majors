3965810,3,B002PQ1PCE,- not as good as the European series - but acceptable - for the photography and content - a good purchase but more could be done!,1366588800,,129,4.0
3965811,1,B002PQ1PCE,"The video was short, of poor quality, and I felt like the narrator was selling a product the entire length. I have personally been to New Zealand (both islands), and this bluray did not do it justice at all.",1302912000,22,207,4.333333333333333
3965812,3,B002PQ1PCE,The video is high quality but could explore the most beautiful places in these two countries in the documentary.,1285632000,2,112,4.947368421052632
3965813,4,B002PQ1PCE,"I found the scenery breathtaking on this DVD, and Rudy Maxa's presentation professional and modest. I definitely recommend this disc, but it feels somewhat incomplete. Indeed, I have seen DVD box sets that contain more episodes of Rudy Maxa's travels down under, and they should have added a second disk or provided separate discs for the New Zealand and Australia episodes on the Blu-ray version.",1285027200,9,397,5.123076923076923
3965814,3,B002PQ1PCE,"Photography was poor, brightly overdone. Scenic nature is nice, typical of remote lands. Rudy's previous releases such as France, Italy and London are much better made.",1269648000,2,168,5.5
3965815,5,B002PQ1PCE,This Rudy Maxa travel series disc has outstanding beautiful pictures.  After watching it you will want to visit Australia and New Zealand right now!  The various places tantalize your every sense and desire while showing some very exciting things to do while visiting Australia and New Zealand.  This disc should not be missed.,1264032000,10,327,5.132075471698113

3965819,1,B002PQ1PCE,"What a waste of time.  Relatively little attention to the sights in A or NZ.  Instead, there are commercials for vendors who (undoubtedly) pay to be included.  Really eats up far too much time with commercials and doesn't focus on the sights that most visitors would see.",1454112000,2,271,4.723404255319149
3965820,4,B002PQ1PCE,Informative but would prefer a documentary to a travelog.,1450051200,,57,5.444444444444445
3965821,5,B002PQ1PCE,"This Blu-ray plus DVD set is a steal (bargain) for anyone wanting an introduction to Australia and New Zealand.  It consists of four episodes (Sydney, Queenland, NZ North Island, NZ South Island) produced in the standard format of the Rudy Maxa show that many of us have been accustomed to watching on US public television.  The difference is that on public television, Rudy was usually somewhere in Europe, whereas here on glorious Blu-ray, he is visiting Australia and New Zealand.  Rudy may not be going to all the places you might go to down under, but the four programs should whet your appetites for these two magnificent countries.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

One reviewer felt Rudy was trying to sell something through the program.  From watching him on countless PBS episodes, I can assure you he is only trying to whet your appetites to all the great things to see and do in far away places.  Think of Rudy Maxa as a upscale front-door version of Rick Steves; Rudy would feature the Park Hyatt in Sydney, whereas Rick Steves would (if he were to do Australia) feature a small family owned B&B.

This Blu-ray set was done in 2005 (at least the Sydney one was, based on the comment in the Opera House) and produced in 2006.  Even so, after returning from a trip to Australia and New Zealand (Nov 2015). I found the Blu-ray set to be still fresh as an intro, and refreshing to see again to boot.  For example, the sights and things he did on the Blu-ray in Sydney (where ten years of change is significant) still seem to remind me of the way we saw Sydney just a few weeks ago, although we did not have the resources to do all he did in the program.  We instead enjoyed the many free museums in Sydney (a la Rick Steves), which Rudy did not feature in his Blu-ray.  The gorgeous opening aerial sequence of Sydney Harbour is worth the price of admission.  And the price for this beautiful set is amazingly low now.  So get it, while you can.",1447632000,2,1941,4.492877492877493

3965824,2,B002PQ1PCE,Did not cover much of Australia other than Sydney.  New Zealand was sure beautiful!,1434585600,2,83,4.928571428571429

3965827,4,B002PQ1PCE,"Unfortunately Rudy stays on the East Coast and ignores Perth, Darwin, the mineral riches, Alice Springs, and the big red rock. Most tours miss the same thinmg and this was Rudy's chance to fill a monster void !",1422748800,2,210,4.552631578947368

3965829,5,B002PQ1PCE,"The narration was great. We felt like we were there. My husband and I wanted go to Australia and New Zealand, but we learned due to an aggressive illness, we wouldn't be able to. So this was the next best thing. The photography is phenomenal. Unfortunately, we only were able to watch Austraila, but I'm sure the quality of New Zealand is the same. Enjoy your journey.",1403913600,3,368,4.507462686567164

3965834,5,B002PQ1PCE,Rudy Maxa is a wonderful host to the show.  I love his practical tips and his sense of humor.  All of his travel videos make me want to pack my bags and head to the airport.,1367280000,,173,3.7777777777777777
