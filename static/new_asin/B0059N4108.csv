8463015,3,B0059N4108,"First off  Pearl Jams appearance on Austin City Limits was awesome to watch. 10 stars out of 5.  However, Dont be confused by the title of this product that is anything more than the ACL episode that appeared on PBS, because it is not. Furthermore, the logo Rock Icons logo (or whatever it was) that appeared in the lower right hand corner of the screen was only a little less annoying than the Spanish subtitles that appeared on screen when Eddie spoke to the crowd. The quality of the program is no better than the version I have stored on my DVR that I recorded when it first aired. For my money, I ended up getting nothing more than I already had.",1412121600,,651,4.327868852459017
