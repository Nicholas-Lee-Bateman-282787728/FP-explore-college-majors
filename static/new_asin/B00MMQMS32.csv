It is brief so it gets quick attentive viewers full attention and many people can relate to this type of situation, I guess what I liked about it the most was it wasn't the old boring information giving video. It provoked a very interesting discussion between me and my therapist about change.",1425168000,,469,4.340909090909091
8673075,1,B00MMQMS32,"So I try to abide by the adage of if you can't say something nice however in the hopes of saving another poor soul the $12.99....I work in the counseling field and had the group view this tonight and needless to say, there was very minimal therapeutic value in the content of this video.  Anything that started to breach the topic of a thinking error was very superficial with no depth- rather more like a brief rambling.  I received negative feedback from the group on it's content-basically they got nothing out of it.  I will not be showing this video again and am extremely disappointed I missed my window on returning this video.",1423440000,2,634,4.592920353982301
