208309,4,6300133257,"Having moved to Seattle in 1985 this film has strong sentimental value for me. This film captures the feel of The city at that time perfectly. Quirky, gritty and a little dangerous. I love it completely if only for that reason. Sometimes stilted dialogue. They speak in the shorthand of people who understand each other.

208312,5,6300133257,I've never seen Lorie Singer more beautiful. For that reason alone this movie is worthy of collecting. Keith Carradine is the drifter who pisses away the affections of Georgia and Kris Kristofferson the ex-con and former cop who gets her attention. Genevieve Bujold glues it all together. The setting is a kind of Euro-Americana mixture. The bad guys are comically bad but the other characters not so easily told.,1422489600,,413,5.0

208318,4,6300133257,"TROUBLE IN MIND is a heavily atmospheric neo-noir from Alan Rudolph that is quite intriguing and interesting to watch. The story, if one can call it that, is about an ex-cop, a coffee shop owner and a young couple who are each trying to make their own way in RainCity, a fictionalized/alternate universe version of Seattle. Like the name implies, there is a lot of rain and there is a pervasive sense of melancholy that hangs over it like a cloud. The people who live there all have their pasts, but what really drives them is the hope that they will make it and overcome their circumstances. That, I believe, is at the heart of what this movie represents. In many film noirs past, the general thematic tone was one of fate and destiny, and it being out of human control. Here, in a similarly constructed world, we have people trying to wrest control back into their own hands. Overall, I thought the movie was rather good. Kris Kristofferson gives a great performance as the ex-cop with a checkered past, and Genevieve Bujold, Lori Singer and Keith Carradine give equally decent performances as the coffee shop owner and the young couple, respectively. Ample time is also spent with each character, so that you get to know and sympathize with them (although, to a lesser, degree with Genevieve Bujold). The effect that the city has on a person is seen most explicitly with Coop, played by Keith Carradine, as his appearance changes considerably over the course of the film, and he gets deeper and deeper into the underworld. Also worth mentioning is Divine, who takes a supporting role as the top gangster in RainCity. This is probably his best performance, and he brings shades of flamboyance and menace to it. He is only in a few scenes, but his presence is felt over the entire film and he makes the most of his limited screen time. The movie also has a fantastic jazz score and some great songs sung by Marianne Faithfull. But despite how great the film is, there are a few drawbacks. The biggest one is a climactic shoot-out which comes out of nowhere and seemed poorly choreographed. There's also some spotty acting from people in minor roles. Overall, I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I first heard about this, but I was pleasantly surprised. Alan Rudolph managed to create a neo-noir which doesn't wallow in misery, and which maintained its own unique style. I'd recommend checking this one out, especially if you're into the noir genre. You probably won't be disappointed.",1402963200,,2489,4.724137931034483

Kris Kristofferson, Keith Carradine, Genevieve Bujold, and a variety of talented fringe actors and actresses deliver a genuinely entertaining look at life in a semi-militarized future (loosely) set in what is recognizably Seattle.

208321,5,6300133257,"Having lived in Seattle most of my life, I think this the best movie ever shot there.  I like the story and the actors but it is how they used the locations in creating ""Rain City"" that really drew me in.  Mark Isham's moody score contributes a lot to the dark, brooding quality and Divine playing it straight as the gangster Hilly Blue is a surprising casting choice that I felt worked quite well.  Netflix doesn't have this movie and it seems like it hasn't been broadcast on TV in a really long time.

208323,5,6300133257,"Many here can give you what happens in the movie. Hawk leaves jail, see's Wanda, falls for Georgia, et al. But it's the dialog that drives and the continual overcast sky that moods it up with the in-the-sun-ending mirroring ""The Asphalt Jungle"" which left me liking this flick since '86. I've used lines in this movie like ""between the two of you there's one person"" so much I owe Rudolph royalties. Hawk is a good man. Can't be bought. Perhaps that's one facet of my liking this pic so much. (In a related way, why I find the character, Frank Black in the TV show Millennium similar) The score by Isham is sublime. The similarities of appearance between the police captain and mob boss was done on purpose. That's about all I can add. I believe I'll be living in Rain City, soon.",1325721600,,780,4.461538461538462

I agree with the review that said this is probably the best of Kris Kristofferson's work.  He doesn't come off as an over acting tough guy. Yes, it is a very strange movie but the ending and end title song are the best. If you've never seen this movie, or like me, it's been a long time, watch the extras first.

208329,3,6300133257,"Trouble in Mind is a very strange film. It is set in either a parallel universe or a retro future -- no explanation is offered. Rain City is obviously a fictional version of Seattle, down to the Space Needle, and other Seattle landmarks/trademarks. Though filmed in Seattle, Rain City is more of an ""It's a Wonderful Life"" Potterville. Clarence, the angel, is showing George what life would look like if he hadn't existed.

Part Film Noir, part Sci Fi, TiM opens as ex cop John Hawkins, (Kris Kristofferson) -- the Hawk, is released from prison into a town controlled by crime lord Hilly Blue (Divine, in his first and only non-drag role). The Hawk holes up in a room above Wanda's Caf, after date raping Wanda (Genevive Bujold), an old pal, whose hospitality knows no bounds. She also takes in Georgia (Lori Singer), an innocent waif with a baby named Spike and a boyfriend named Coop (Keith Carradine). Coop is strictly bad news. He makes the Hawk look like Gandhi. When Coop hooks up with Solo, a well read, literate, criminal, just back from a foreign war with a case of Post Traumatic stress Buddhism, they go on a crime spree. Their free lance heists, however, aren't sanctioned by Hilly Blue, so their days as independent operators are numbered. The Hawk has Georgia on his mind, and yearns to save her from Coop. To protect her and take care of her he's willing to do anything -- even get a job -- but will he work for the police, or Hilly Blue?

This film was an earnest attempt to merge Sci Fi and Film Noir, but something went horribly awry. Director Alan Rudolph was a protge of Robert Altman, and like Altman, Fassbinder, and other auteurs, he likes to use a core ensemble of actors that reappear in a lot of his films. Keith Carradine and Genevive Bujold are two of his favorites.

I have yet to see any of Rudolph's other films except ""The Moderns,"" but so far, I am not impressed. This is one auteur I could do without, and I think that ""Trouble in Mind"" and ""The Moderns"" are two prime examples of what I don't like about his films. They are hip, artistic, creative, all the things I look for in a film -- yet Rudolph finds a way to spoil them. On paper ""Trouble in Mind"" sounds Divine, yet in practice Rudolph the red nosed auteur will always find a way to inject something into the mix to wreck things.

Especially Keith Carradine, who in ""Trouble in Mind"" starts off in flannel, but once he parks his single-wide trailer in the alley behind Wanda's Caf, he changes into a glam rock thug, with totally ridiculous hair, make up, and accessories. ""Trouble in Mind"" is worth seeing, just to see how bad his fashion choices are. His hair do, especially, is a hair DON'T. What was Alan Rudolph thinking?

Carradine can claim that he was supposed to be an unsympathetic character, as the audience would be rooting for the rapacious Hawk to get Georgia (he is THAT unsympathetic), but he was just as insufferable in ""The Moderns"" where he was supposed to be a cool, modern painter. He is always so smug for absolutely no reason. He can really turn on the opposite of charm.

Anyway, I enjoyed watching it, just BECAUSE it was so BAD. I am still interested in seeing some other Alan Rudolph films, like ""Choose Me,"" ""Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle,"" ""Welcome to L.A.,"" and especially ""Songwriter."" That one has Willie Nelson and Kris Kristofferson playing, well, songwriters, and I think they both could do a really convincing job of that. But ""Trouble in Mind"" wasn't just trouble in mind, it was trouble in fact.

On the bright side, John Considine, brother of Tim Considine, (Mike Douglas on the classic TV show My Three Sons) played Nate, and Dirk Blocker who played Hilly Blue's henchman, Rambo, is the son of Dan Blocker, (Hoss on the classic TV Western, Bonanza);  and Dirk's brother David Blocker is one of the producers of  ""Trouble in Mind."" For players of Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon, please note that Lori Singer was in Footloose. Oh, yeah. Divine was actually convincing as a man. Much more so than Keith Carradine.

Like the Seattle Asian Art Museum converted into Divine's mansion; the shoot-out that shatters Dale Chihuly's reject glass scultures (and caused the local artists to cheer when it was shown in the theaters). Then there's our joke of a monorail built for the Seattle World's Fair (what?  You didn't know Seattle had a world's fair?).  In the movie it is periodically shown racing through the night, while in reality it's only a few blocks long.

  As I recall (it has been decades since I saw it) it is an enjoyable movie, and with such big name stars, I can't understand why it isn't out on DVD. If it was I'd buy one for mysef and several others as presents.",1181347200,5,748,4.423357664233577
208333,5,6300133257,"Trouble in Mind is a film that needs to have a DVD release, not just to satisfy those who love it, but to prove that there aren't just a few directors in the world who know how to pay homage to the best films of the '40s and '50s.  This was one of the best films of the 1980s.

The characters of the film are impressive: Hawk, Wanda, Georgia, Hilly Blue, Coop, and Solo.  As equally important as the characters is the atmosphere of Rain City, and the life it has to offer.  Alan Rudolph manipulates the characters to interact with the city expertly, as if the city were a living, breathing character all its own.  This is direction perfected by Welles in A Touch of Evil, and was so common in many films with Humphrey Bogart.

This is Film101, and needs to be on a DVD.  The storyboards need to be published.  The screenplay needs to be read.  Rudolph's commentary needs to be heard.  This film needs to be seen.",1175558400,5,912,4.280701754385965

208335,4,6300133257,"No DVD domestically for this title; I bought the obscure Dutch region 2 DVD and it's worth it. Far superior to the director's (Alan Rudolph) later attempt at noir, Love at Large (1990), this film's set in Rain City (meaning Seattle, but the map in the police lieutenant's office actually says ""Rain City""). The lieutenant, played by George Kirby, is the former boss of a disgraced cop, Kris Kristofferson, who goes by the name of Hawk, short for John Hawkins.

Hawk's just been let out of the slammer and makes his way to his old flame's place, Wanda's Cafe. Genevieve Bujold is the owner and while Love at Large made fun of chemistry between characters, thereby spoiling any magnetism it could have had, Trouble in Mind plays it straight and so the viewer feels it when Hawk and Wanda are together.

But Wanda ultimately drops Hawk; he's the past she doesn't want to continue with. Meanwhile, Keith Carradine and Lori Singer as a young couple struggling in a country shack, move to the city after Coop (Carradine) swipes some money from an open safe at a place that won't hire him. Coop falls in with the wrong crowd, initially typified by Joe Morton in a great performance as Solo, the kind of fast-talking nervous street crime guy always looking for somebody to lean on, who finds it in Coop. The two form an unlikely team focused on stealing jewelry.

Circumstances bring Hawk and Georgia, Coop's wife, together after Coop undergoes a radical change in hairstyle, clothing, and taste in women. The bad guys, played by Divine and Dirk Blocker sporting a ridiculous wig and a phony growly voice (Hilly Blue and Rambo, respectively), make things tough for Coop and Hawk both.

When the movie opens, you'd swear it was in the 1940s and in fact, Rain City was the favorite nickname for Seattle back then (not so much these days). Then as the film progresses you realize there's a mix of fashions, behaviors, automobiles, and other cultural accoutrements that places the setting in some alternate universe that's just right for a semi-surreal, edgy neo-noir like this one.

The interesting cast does a fine job. Lori Singer as Georgia is the right blend of beauty, innocence, and vulnerability which nicely contrasts with Wanda's tough (but, yes, good-hearted) exterior. John Considine as the completely corrupt lawyer Nate is fine also, and the other supporting cast chips in as well.

A great 80s American film meant to spotlight the mix of innocence and sleaze that's America at its core, Trouble in Mind delivers the goods. Worth the price of admission, no question.",1119484800,20,2568,4.838268792710706
208336,4,6300133257,"In my earlier review of another one of Alan Rudolph's movies, ""The Moderns"", I cited this film as being the ONLY movie to cover what life was like in the weird period in western pop history between 1975 and 1982. This was a period when David Bowie's bizarre influence permeated just about everything having to do with American and Western European night life and sexual rebellion. NOBODY sought to document this strange footnote in the 20th century timeline other than Rudolph, and he does an excellent job!
This is one of a trilogy of movies Rudolph directed when he was ""hot"", just after he had developed his own style, apart from Robert Altman, his mentor. ""Choose Me"" and ""The Moderns"" were the other two. (To appreciate the difference that eventually set the two apart, rent Rudolph's ""Welcome To L.A"", which could have EASILY been an Altman movie, and compare it to any one of these three.) Unfortunately, since these three movies, Rudolph hasn't done much that could be considered landmark, with the exception of ""Mrs. Parker and The Vicious Circle"". A damned shame, really.
 The story centers around Kris Kristofferson, starring in one of his few really good movies, as a disgraced cop who gets paroled back into Seattle society after serving time for murdering a crime lord for harassing an old flame of his, Wanda, played by Genevieve Bujold, whom he reunites with after he gets out. Wanda owns a popular diner haunted by weirdos and hangers-on over which Kristofferson takes an apartment she offers to him out of gratitude. Into this mix comes Coop, played by Keith Carradine, a young married with the requisite financial problems all working class young marrieds face: New baby, new expenses, a wife to support....After finding out that jobs are hard to come by, (this IS after all, set in the late 70s and early 80s,) Coop soon turns to crime after meeting with a strange, black habitue of Bujold's diner, played by Joe Morton. Coop soon transforms from an average Joe to something resembling a cross between the Joker from Batman and Bowie's Thin White Duke, turning off his young wife, played by Lori Singer. This drives her into the arms of Hawk, Kristofferson's character. Hawk happens onto her right after Coop comes home late one night from one his first forays into petty crime with his newfound friend, Morton, and Hawk just happens to be passing by their shabby motor home after the fight between the two younger people ends.
Eventually, Coop and his friend try to deal with Hilly Blue, a fey crime lord played by the well-known, late transvestite actor Divine, and nobody's life from there on in is quite the same again.
This movie captures the neon world of the late seventies new-wave/punk era near-perfectly and is unique in the fact that it is the ONLY movie to do so! The acting, specifically Carradine, Bujold and Morton, is top-notch, the music, by Mark Isham, is moody, jazzy and noir-perfect and humor abounds throughout.
One of the oddest portions of the movie is a latter part involving Coop and Morton and yet another crime lord of the city named Nate. Nate is, quite frankly, a sissy with an eye for VERY young ladies. However, he's powerful enough to make life very rough for the two punks.
Buy this movie, and I assure you, it will stay in your OWN mind for quite a while.",1050278400,43,3310,4.756521739130434

208338,4,6300133257,"Alan Rudolph has created a fascinating off-beat look at America, through the eyes of a cynical ex-cop, Kris Kristofferson, who goes by the name of Hawk.  The setting seems to lie in a no-man's land between the past and the future, as Seattle is transformed into a bleak, dreary city under martial law.  Hawk reluctantly finds himself as a guardian angel for a young woman, Lori Singer, and her baby, who have been abandoned by her erstwhile husband, David Carradine, who rather absurdly gets drug into the dark underworld of Rain City.  Hawk's old flame, Genevieve Bujold, provides most of the emotional punch in this movie, running a diner inhabited by local rif-raf, which serves as Hawk's hideout.  The story is cartoonish, but that is part of its charm.  The dead-pan performances carry the movie through its rather predictable twists and turns, highlighted by a comicly nuanced performance by the great Divine as the kingpin of the Rain City underworld.  The Mark Isham score is given haunting refrains by Marianne Faithfull.  Rudolph seemed to have fun with this movie.  It moves along well with a perfectly inane closing scene in which Hawk brings the proper forces back in order.",1041120000,18,1187,4.9296482412060305

7802780,2,6300133257,"The closer a work gets to greatness but misses, the worse the result will seem. Trouble In Mind fits the bill. The tone is uneven--is it serious, self-parodying, satirical?--and that question introduces an interesting tension. Is the script cliched and implausible by design, or just lazy bad writing? Is this a send-up of the noir genre, or an attempt to redefine it? Is rape-y protagonist Hawk meant to be a creep, or is the audience expected to tacitly endorse his toxic masculinity? When our damsel in distress runs aimlessly through the streets, is the absurdity intentional? Does intention matter in a work of art? As it progresses, the film becomes both more violent and ridiculous. It seems to be playing for shock and laughter, but there's a lingering whiff of self-seriousness. Aspects of the look and tone anticipate the Coens and Tarantino, but that might just be a forward reflection of the noir genre the film plunders. While these questions might fuel conversation, the film itself is almost unwatchable.",1471046400,,1019,5.035502958579881
