4887430,3,B005SW2RK6,"Lust in the Dust is a classic which I can't say about Beyond Therapy. I believe movie studio knew no one wanted to watch Beyond Therapy and just put in on this dvd as a filller, but hey that's just my theory",1488153600,,207,3.9523809523809526
4887431,5,B005SW2RK6,Not your typical western.  I gave this a five because I can't stop laughing.  The worst kind of spoof of westerns.  Gotta love Divine !!!,1484179200,2,137,4.4

4887435,5,B005SW2RK6,Lust in the dust - Not for every taste.  High camp.  Madeline Kahn is brilliant.  Divine is divine.  Beyond Therapy is an artistic stillbirth.  The playwright should sue...,1472774400,2,172,5.0

4887444,1,B005SW2RK6,"ugh.. i only watched Lust in the Dust and at that, sped through most of it. There's nothing good about this movie, a western parody. Divine's disgustingness, bad editing, bad lines, bad line delivery.. this is just stupid beyond belief.

Men who gush over Devine's persona will love this. They will hate my review of it and say that the review is not helpful. Just remember that Devine ate dog sh~t in a movie. Google it if you don't believe me.",1441670400,,445,4.493827160493828

4887456,3,B005SW2RK6,"When I bought this, I was looking for a reasonably priced copy of ""Lust in the Dust"".  When I saw this combo, I thought that I would take a chance, buy it, and pray for the best on the movie ""Beyond Therapy"".  That was a major mistake!  ""Beyond Therapy"" is a homophobe's dream movie with so many horrible cliches that it is sickening!  I will avoid watching it.  As for ""Lust in the Dust"", well what can I say?  C'mon, a movie with Divine, Tab Hunter, and Rita Moreno!  How can you go wrong?  But...having said that, if you can't afford the $25-$35 price range that some sellers are charging, get this.  Otherwise, do as I sometimes do and don't buy it and pray that the price will eventually go down.",1401926400,2,701,4.290076335877862
4887457,5,B005SW2RK6,I got this two movie disc for Lust In The Dust as it was cheaper this way than on it's own.  This is an excellent western comedy that should give most people a few good laughs.  Beyond Therapy I tried but couldn't find anything funny about it.  For me this is still a good buy.,1388361600,2,277,4.0

4887459,4,B005SW2RK6,"Lust in the Dust is classic. It might be totally inane humor, but you laugh inspite of yourself. One of the last staring roles by Tab Hunter, a 50's hunk...it has outrageous performances. Beyong therapy is quirky, but also very funny",1364169600,7,233,4.7073170731707314
8485581,3,B005SW2RK6,"Lust in the Dust deserves a one-star rating, and for a one-star movie, it deserves five stars. This film is so utterly zany.  It is too long and is slow at times, but has some great moments -- Margarita's dirge upon the death of her (boyfriend?) Bernardo; Rosie's accidental killing of her bedmates, the final shoot-out between the sisters, and Rosie's singing audition.  The costume designer who came up with the dresses for these ""ladies"" deserves a lot of credit.  Divine is wonderful and LanIe Kazan steals the scenes every time.  My favorite lines in the film:  ""Rosie, don't you think you've had enough?""  ""I know when I've had enough, I fall on the floor."" And:  ""You could eat off these floors, and you probably will!""",1524182400,,726,4.714285714285714

8485584,4,B005SW2RK6,"Why doesn't Lust in the Dust have its own cult following?  I got a real kick out of it.  My wife preferred Beyond Therapy.  Both are worth watching again, with or without friends, pizza and beer.",1502841600,,195,4.361111111111111
