7916198,5,B00002SSLF,Way better than the blu ray WWE recently released.,1432252800,,50,4.666666666666667
7916199,4,B00002SSLF,"A look back at Sting's career covering most of the year 1999--a year that I'm sure most wrestling historians and fans will tell you was the beginning of the downfall of WCW. It seems like the company never could recover from the colossal blunder that was ""The Fingerpoke of Doom.""

But all that aside, this is a pretty good tape--with Sting himself (in character) playing host as he covers most of his highlights (and a few lowlights) from '99. The highlights of course were 2 great matches with Flair--in particular the match Sting and Flair had in April on Nitro--imo, one of the best Sting/Flair matches ever, which makes me wish these Superstar tapes would have included some ""complete"" matches instead of just highlights--but I digress.

Some of the lowlights would be what I would call another blunder by WCW, in that they put the World Heavyweight title on Sting after a great match with DDP, only to have him lose it about an hour later.

Just imagine the possibilities WCW could have explored if they had gone with a Sting/Goldberg feud heading into Slamboree '99 if the World Heavyweight Title had been added to the mix. And, of course, another lowlight would be the dogs attacking Sting after the match with Rick Steiner.

The tape ends with the greatness that was Sting clobbering Hogan with the black bat at Fall Brawl--one of the most well received heel turns I can remember--as Sting reminds us ""The only thing for sure about Sting, is nothing's for sure.""

Overall--if you're a Sting fan--""Back in Black"" should be a very good way to while away about an hour of your life.",1416096000,,1588,4.697841726618705
7916200,4,B00002SSLF,"Good synopsis of Sting in 1999. One the best Superstar Series entries. Sting narrates the video in character and takes us from his return at Spring Stampede through his heel turn and victory over Hogan for the World Title at Fall Brawl. Considering the shape the company was in at that point, this is a well made documentary and should please any fans of the Stinger.",1414886400,,367,4.575757575757576
7916201,4,B00002SSLF,"Thanks to a friend of mine finally cleaning out his garage, I was given a bunch of old VHS tapes including this one that was one of the third ""WCW Superstar Series"" that WCW started releasing around late 1999 that ran around an hour long.  Sting was in character here as he hosted this tape as it picks up where his previous ""Unmasked"" tape left off highlighting his career in 1999.  The various highlights of his career include his return match in the fatal four way at Spring Stampede, his confrontation & match with Ric Flair the following night on Nitro, the night he won & lost the WCW Championship to DDP on Nitro, his Slamboree match against Goldberg, the feud with Rick Steiner, his match with Randy Savage leading to his issues with Nash & Team Madness going into Bash At The Beach, his match against Ric Flair for the title of WCW President, his alliance with Hogan & Goldberg against Nash & Steiner & Sid, his Road Wild match against Sid, and turning on Hogan to win another World Championship.

This tape was completely different than their previous ones as this wasn't a ""personality profile"" more than it was just a highlight video for Sting but most of these highlights haven't seen released elsewhere so this is another collectible I would recommend for those who are Sting fans or were fans of WCW during this period.",1300060800,,1334,4.5966386554621845
7916202,4,B00002SSLF,"STING: BACK IN BLACK (1999)

This is an entertaining WCW video with a lot of heavily edited matches from 1999.  In case you'd stopped following WCW by that point, 1999 was definitely the ""beginning of the end"" for the promotion, not only due to ratings and profits but also because of the lack of understandable stories and largely pointless matches.  Knowing this, it may surprise you to hear that I wholeheartedly recommend this tape.

Everyone knows that the Outsiders/nWo angle and the Sting vs. Hollywood Hogan buildup are what gave WCW the thrust it needed to dominate fan interest.  Part of what made these episodes compelling was that you never knew what was going to happen: Who would jump ship from WWF?  Would Sting fly in from the rafters?  Would any WCW babyface turn heel and join the nWo?  Seeing where this got them, the writers at WCW managed to turn the theme of suspenseful unpredictability into a weekly routine of bizarre randomness.  Titles would change hands on a monthly basis and feuds would be started for no reason and then never mentioned again.  The difference in the pre- and post- Starrcade 97 ""unpredictabilities"" is that the former was working towards something, while the latter was often just a desperate attempt to gain our interest without any regard for continuity.  In short, one was exciting and the other was confusing. Indeed, WCW was playing musical chairs with the people who made decisions (Vince Russo, Eric Bischoff, Kevin Nash etc) so no one person can be blamed.  This tape was made less than two years after the zenith point of Starrcade 97 and about two years before the demise of the WCW.  It perfectly demonstrates some of what the WCW was trying to hold onto and also where it was going.  Most importantly, it is also fun to watch.

Most of the matches here have introductory commentary from Sting, in character.  He is sitting in an electrical closet with smoke and weird lights around him.  Many newer fans of wrestling will find this cheesy and melodramatic, but for someone who grew up with the more cartoonish wrestling stars, it reminds me of a time when wrestling's key demographic was kids and families.  Of course by the time this video was made, that era was long gone, making this tape even more of an anomaly.  The matches themselves are edited down.

You will see a lot of strange things on this tape.  For example, Sting wins and loses the Heavyweight Title during the course of a single Nitro episode.  You will see people interfering in the matches as was common during this time period.  Bret Hart  jumps in the ring to swat Goldberg with a chair and the bewildered announcers proclaim ""He hasn't been with this organization for months!""  You will see Sting attacked by a doberman and a rottweiler during a match with Rick Steiner.  Sting also faces off with Rick Flair a few times here, in one instance to become the ""WCW President"".  However he later abandons the position, stating that ""politics are for suits!""  You will witness a HUGE missed opportunity in Hogan abandoning his ""Hollywood"" heel look for his signature red and yellow Hulkster gimmick... for an inconsequential tag match.  Can you imagine how much they could've built up a Hollywood to Hulkster storyline?  You will also (sort of) see the inverse of this, in one of Sting's attempts to play a heel at Fall Brawl.  The clip is very brief with almost zero explanation, but even so you can see in these few seconds why fans preferred him as a hero.

I will never forget that great footage of a hummer crashing into Randy Savage's limousine?  This clip is symbolic of what pushed WCW on its downward spiral.  We see Sting jump out of the back of a car to fight Rick Steiner, and Kevin Nash question Sting: ""WHO WAS DRIVING THE HUMMER?!""  We never find out because the angle was quickly dropped, but you can see numerous signs in the crowd referencing the weird incident.  Metaphorically speaking, the WCW's Hummer did crash into Vince McMahon's limo and seriously damaged it for years.  But after all the confusion, it was clear that nobody was driving the Hummer.
