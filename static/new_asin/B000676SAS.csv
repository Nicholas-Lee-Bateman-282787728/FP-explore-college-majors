2171007,4,B000676SAS,"Simple and Nicely done. Nice colorful scenery. Nice music. Nice location. Beautiful backgrounds and props. And of course nice chicks.
Her kick boxing video is even better. I didn't even have to leave my chair to get my heart rate up.",1195603200,,233,4.7073170731707314
2171008,2,B000676SAS,I bought this video thinking it was for a beginner and it is not. If you are not familiar with aerobics this is not the video to start with.,1195257600,,140,3.8620689655172415
2171009,4,B000676SAS,"The carribbean series are fun and provide a great workout.  I love how this dvd has 4 20 minute workouts on it.  2 are high impact and 2 are low impact.  Doing one of 20 minute high workouts provides enought cardio by itself (when your in a rush).  Or for a super workout, combine 2 of them.",1187049600,,291,4.052631578947368
2171010,5,B000676SAS,This video is very easy to follow and I like that.  I like doing a low impact following by a high impact and that way I do an hour of cardio 4 times a week.  The routines are simple and the instructor is very natural.,1186617600,3,217,3.8
2171011,5,B000676SAS,"I've been watching Caribbean Workout on Fit TV for years, and would tape some of my favorites so I could repeat the workouts.  It was great to have some DVD sets to use instead.  The workouts are about 22 minutes long, the same length as the TV show without commercials.  I really recommend these for people who need a low impact workout, as these are short workouts and are easily modified.  As host Shelly McDonald says, if you can't do a move, just keep moving with a step you can do.  There are other workouts available as well, such as kickboxing, and several pilates and yoga workouts.  I wish the dance episodes of Caribbean Workout would be released on DVD, but otherwise I can't complain.",1174348800,5,697,4.536
2171012,4,B000676SAS,"I really like this DVD.  It contains four 20 minute (approx) workouts - 2 hi/lo inpact and 2 low impact.  I do both low impact classes on days when I want a good light workout and both hi/lo classes on days I want a little more of a challenge.  The ladies do get off-cue sometimes and occasionally, Shelly will miscue or forget to cue a move; that is the only reason I did not give it 5 stars.  But once you get used to the routine, these will become nonissues for you.  The ladies, Shelly, Caroline, and Joanne, are fun and energetic without being annoying.  The high impat portions can be easily modified to low impact and vice versa, so any fitness level can get a good workout.",1172275200,7,681,4.28125
2171013,3,B000676SAS,"I was not familiar with the C.A. or Shelly before I bought this.  I've only been through the first low impact portion twice and I was going to wait a bit longer to write this review but I don't think this is going to get any better.  I'm accustomed to variety and I don't get it here.  What I DO get is a lot of knee-bending.  20 some minutes of knee bending.  I don't understand what people are so excited about.  This isn't fun.  Obviously, I'm in the minority and because of that, I'll do the remainder of the DVD but geesh, I don't think my opinion is going to change and I'm not sure how much more my knees can take.  I don't even breathe heavy.. what's the point?",1143072000,17,669,4.092307692307692
2171014,5,B000676SAS,"This DVD is one of my best purchases of 2005 by far, for a small price you get 4-20 minute aerobic routines, two low impact and two hi-low impact led by Shelly McDonald.  Shelly is joined by Joanna and Carolyn, all three of them are in great shape and seem to be having a great time.  The music is great, and the scenery spectacular.  The videos are shot at various locations in Barbados, some on the beach or poolside at the Sugar Hill Resort.

The routines themselves are easy to follow, the moves are basic but lots of fun, plus the hi-lo routines are easily modifiable to low impact which is nice.  Lots of the same moves are seen in all the routines, which might bother some people but I didn't seem to mind this at all.  I especially like the short length of the routines, I often do cardio following my strength training and find that these are great as add-ons, or you can do a couple of them for a longer workout.  Shelly misses a couple cues here and there but overall I really like her as an instructor, she and her friends provide a fun, relaxed atmosphere, which makes it even more fun for me.

These workouts were originally filmed for Fit TV, therefore there are brief commercial breaks where the screen goes black, but it's for only a few seconds. As another reviewer said, each workout has it's own warmup and cooldown, plus some of the routines have brief toning segments at the end.

Overall this is a great buy, it is one of the DVD's in my collection that gets the most use.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys simple but fun aerobic routines.",1135296000,25,1580,4.38013698630137
2171015,4,B000676SAS,"I picked this DVD up at a local Ross store for $6.99. It came with the Kickboxing DVD. For the price, it was a great buy. Each DVD has four 20 minute workouts. The Aerobics DVD has two low impact and two high impact workouts. They include athletic (rather than dancy) moves that are easy to learn. There is some repetition and overlap (the workouts have some similar moves) but it doesn't get tiresome. The moves can be easily modified to make them higher or lower impact.

The music is club-ish, I've heard it in Karen Voight and CIA workouts. The scenery is gorgeous, and Shelly has a natural, easy manner, as do her background exercisers. This DVD would be good for someone looking for short workouts, and would be considered intermediate, though I think you could make it easier or harder if you wanted. There are cuts where the commercials would be, but when they ""return,"" the exercisers are still doing the same moves so the cuts aren't too bad.

My only complaint is that this DVD isn't chaptered, so if you decide to do two of the workouts, you end up doing two warm-ups and cool downs. You can fast-forward through them though.",1113436800,46,1137,4.541463414634146
2171016,5,B000676SAS,"I've been following the Caribbean Workout on television for years, and it has quickly become my favourite workout.  I was so excited when it finally came out on DVD.  It's easy to follow, provides an excellent workout and is pleasant to watch because of its beautiful setting in Barbados.  I recommend this workout to people at any level, beginning or advanced, since the workouts can be adapted to your personal level.",1110153600,22,419,4.873239436619718

8039515,4,B000676SAS,"I love to do aerobcs especally with Shelly.
Unfortunately there is way too much publicity in the beginning of each workout and the camera work is not the best
but Shelly is THE BEST",1388534400,3,181,4.352941176470588
8039516,5,B000676SAS,Video arrived promptly without any flaws and plays well without any skips. Shelly will work you out and make you sweat becuase she's intense.,1366761600,,141,4.916666666666667
8039517,4,B000676SAS,"I have the pleasure of taking Shelly's workouts in Montreal and she is one of the most amazing instructors.  She always gives alternatives just like her DVD's, she does the entire class (not just walk around) and she is so down to earth approachable and knowledgable.",1329350400,2,267,4.804347826086956
8039518,5,B000676SAS,"I love Shelly's workouts.  They are in a great location too!  Beautiful backgrounds to look at while you workout.  There are two options to choose from, lo impact and hi impact.  Each workout is 20 minutes, which I can fit in even on my busy days.",1327968000,,247,4.304347826086956
8039519,5,B000676SAS,"I am fun of all the workouts made by Shelly McDonalds. In my country there is a huge problem to buy them so I had to buy them at the amazon.com. I do not regret:)The dvd""s don""t disappointed me - all the workouts are great, they do not bored me and are relaxing and exciting. I totally recommend:)",1218672000,4,297,4.137931034482759
8039520,5,B000676SAS,"For those who want a quick, enjoyable aerobic workout with an entertaining host.  Moves are easy to follow but not boring.  Great to combine with other training or when you're in a hurry.",1202947200,3,187,4.636363636363637
8039521,1,B000676SAS,"Since I find background music so energizing, I assumed that this video would include Caribbean music. However, there really is no music to speak of and the instructor's directions are too fast and unpredictable for me -- I have only tried the low-impact. I'm sure if I watch it long enough I will learn her routine, but I don't feel at all inspired to continue with it.",1199318400,3,369,4.522388059701493
