1872924,5,B00008YYV9,"Being Erica is a unique,out of the box, literate TV series. Many entries about it find it odd that  an American  TV network has not picked it up. I think Dr. Tom's quotes throughout the episodes would scare them off.  It is on ""Soap Net"" (of all places!) in the US,  but the episodes  for this ""fall"" season do not start on Soap Net until April 2011.  And this is Soap Net's last year of operation. Being Erica is not a soap opera, although it is serialized. It is not sci-fi, but features ""time travel"" on every episode. I almost gave this a 4 star rating due to the PAL version not including any extra features. If you do not need the PAL version I would go with the NTSC which has the extra features.",1289692800,2,703,4.17037037037037

1872951,5,B00008YYV9,"I enjoyed all the seasons of Being Erica.  I wish it lasted longer.  We all wish we could relive mistakes but even when she did, she made others.  Eventually she learns from them as we all do.",1382227200,,192,4.135135135135135

1872954,5,B00008YYV9,"The tables have turned and it's Dr Tom's turn to have a therapy session. Erica is concerned with her friend and fellow patient, Kai. He decides to give up his therapy and hope for the best. Erica is concerned and wants Dr Tom to help. Dr Tom says no and Erica gets angry at him. Then something strange happens. Dr Tom sees Dr Naadiah for his therapy session. Dr Naadiah is Dr Tom's therapist and she takes him back to his regret in life; saying goodbye to his daughter before she dies. This was a painful experience for him and he understands a part of his daughter that he never knew before.

This is an unusual episode for me. I always expected to see Erica going through her therapy sessions so seeing Dr Tom doing it instead really threw me off but I like it. I love the scene when we learn that Dr Tom was a perfectionist and wanted to control everything including his daughter. I also love the scene where he was so caught up in controling his daughter that he never knew a beautiful part of herself because he didn't allow himself to see it until now.",1313107200,,1058,4.29
1872973,5,B00008YYV9,"Erica is upset with Kai's sexual relationship with her sister Samantha. She tries to avoid him but whatever she does, Kai always seem to be involved with Erica's day-to-day activities. Dr Tom intervenes. Dr Tom takes Erica back to her high school days to interact with her brother Leo. Erica and Leo had a party at their parent's house and Leo lied to Erica about their father's hot-rod car. Erica learned the truth about Leo and his lies the hard way and it was a rude awakening for Erica. Erica learned that she categorized people and it prevented her from seeing the truth about them and herself. When she came back to present time, she apologized to Kai for her behavior and tells Kai that she's infatuated over him.

This is a complicated storyline. Unlike other episodes, the audience was kept wondering what did Erica learned from her experience with Leo. The audience was placed in Erica's shoes and the audience gets to be Erica for a little while. I think this is great storytelling! Erin Karpluk's and Michael Riley's terrific acting made it possible.",1311897600,,1062,4.7405405405405405
1872974,5,B00008YYV9,"Erica is having a challenging day. It seems everybody she encounters give her challenges that's out of her comfort zone. Dr Tom intervenes. Dr Tom had a previous talk with Dr Fred about Erica's future. They hinted that Erica is strong enough to live her life without help and they also hinted that Erica needs to pay for her therapy sessions. When Erica sees Dr Tom, Dr Tom decides to test Erica's skills. Instead of helping Erica, he allows Erica to solve her own problems without help. Erica solved her problems beautifully.

This is a great episode that leads me to wonder where this show will lead to. I enjoyed Erica being helped by Dr Tom everytime she gets herself into a challenge. Now it seems that this story will lead to the ending of the show.",1311897600,,755,4.510948905109489
1872975,5,B00008YYV9,"Erica volunteers to be part of a Jewish ritual that she doesn't feel comfortable doing. She does it because her father is performing the ceremony and she wants his love. Her need for love is so great that she decides to become Wonderwoman. She tries to help everybody including her fellow patient, Kai. Kai's therepist, and Dr Tom takes Erica to Kai's future. Erica learns that Kai is literally a Rock Star and is about to commit suicide. Erica tries her best to steer Kai out of this path by helping him make the right decision. Erica learns that trying to help everybody is not healthy for her or for the ones she helping. She learns that being Wonderman isn't possible and she needs to stay realistic.

I find this episode ok. I like the part when Dr Tom, and his co-worker Dr Fred, takes Erica to Kai's future. All actors done an ok performance.",1311724800,,849,4.47741935483871
1872976,5,B00008YYV9,"Erica likes to help everyone in need but she doesn't know what to do when it comes to keeping secrets. Erica finds out that her boss's boyfriend is having an affair with a co-worker. She is torn between staying silent or telling the truth. Dr Tom intervenes. He takes her to her high school days when her goood friend Jenny was having an affair with a teacher. Jenny was acting strange and she didn't want anyone to know about the affair but Erica took the initiative. Erica reported the affair to the authorities. She learns that when it comes to secrets, you need to know what secrets are worth keeping and what needs to be told.

I like this episode because it allows more in-depth view of Erica's boss, Julianne. Until now, Julianne was characterized as a mean, self-centered, woman that only looks out for herself. This episode shows her more of a human being. I'm happy to see that the screenwriters, producers, and directors allow this character to evolve over time. Reagan Pasternak, who plays Julianne, is a good actor. Her good skills in acting show through.",1311292800,,1068,4.680851063829787
1872977,5,B00008YYV9,"Erica is tired of following the rules of society. She doesn't understand why there are rules about being polite, being friendly, and not getting involved in someone's business. Dr Tom decides to help Erica understand these rules first hand. He lets her relive her day again consequence-free. Dr Tom lets her relive her day and do anything she wants without any consequences to her actions. Erica is thrilled and decides to paint the town red. She steels a car with her fellow patient Kai and do the things she always wanted to do like dancing at inappropriate places, telling people off, and speak what's on her mind knowing that it will hurt them. Although she can do anything she wants on this day, she learns that there are terrible consequences to her actions if it came true. She's enlightened.

There are many scenes that I realy like. I like the scene where she dances on a fountain and doesn't care how people will react. I like the scene were she tells her boss off. And I also like the scene where she decides to steel an expensive car with Kai and paint the town red. As always, Erin Karpluk's acting is great. I also like Sebastian Pigott's acting; he plays the character Kai.",1311206400,,1188,4.577464788732394
1872978,5,B00008YYV9,"Erica's dream is to be an author of her own fiction book. Her boss wants her to quit her job and be an author of a sex book, an opportunity of a lifetime. Writing sex books isn't what Erica wanted but she feels pressured by co-workers and her friend, Jenny, to take the risk. Erica says yes then Dr Tom intervenes. Dr Tom takes her back to her graduate school days when she had a chance to teach in Taiwan with her friend, Jenny. She didn't go overseas the first time because she thought it was too risky, now she's taking the risk to find out what will happen to her.  She learns that taking risks are healthy but only if the risks are right for you.

This entire episode is about peer pressure and not giving into them. I love how Erica contantly is manipulated by her friend, Jenny. I love the scenes where Jenny keeps telling Erica that she's a loser if she does't take outragous risks like herself. I also love the scene where Erica tells Jenny that she's not taking real risks because her outragous behaviors are self-destructive. Paula Brancati's performance as Jenny is superb; she made her character come alive.",1311120000,,1120,4.458536585365854
1872979,5,B00008YYV9,"Erica's long time friend, Judith, needs a babysitter and Erica volunteers. She has her doubts about Erica because of her unreliable personality. Judith relents and Erica is in charge. Erica doesn't follow her instructions so she gets angry. Dr Tom intervenes. He takes both Erica and Judith's baby back to her college days when Judith saw Erica as unreliable. Erica learns that raising a child isn't easy and how much she grew over the years. Erica understands that all of Judith's doubts about her isn't about her at all but her own insecurity about being a mother. Erica and Judith has a long talk. They both miss their strong bond when they were younger but they're glad that they're still best friends.

I like this episode because Erica goes back in time with Judith's baby. This is the first time in this show where two characters are brought back in time. I found it hilarious when Erica was taking care of the baby. I also like when Dr Tom makes his appearance several times during this episode instead of once or twice in other episodes.",1311120000,,1046,4.654054054054054
1872980,5,B00008YYV9,"Erica gets into a fight with Ethan because he's not doing what she wants. Erica is afraid of becoming a spinster and she wants to speed up the dating game so they can get married. Ethan, on the other hand, thinks they're going too fast. Both are not willing to talk about their true feelings so they argue about something else instead. Dr Tom intervenes. He takes Erica back to her teenage years to a job she worked in summercamp with a guy named Malcolm. She got mad at Malcolm just like Ethan and she almost repeats the same mistake again. But she didn't. She learned that she was hiding her true feelings away from Ethan so she tells him what was really on her mind.

This is a cool episode. I really enjoy the great reveal that Malcolm is gay and he hid this from Erica when they were teenagers. I love the scene where both Erica and Ethan finally told each other what was on their minds rather than just hide it through anger and resentment.",1310947200,2,946,4.314606741573034
1872981,5,B00008YYV9,"Erica is confronted with the fact that Dr Tom left her. Dr Naadiah is her new therapist and Erica doesn't want her. She quits therapy so Dr Naadiah wants payment for Erica's therapy sessions with Dr Tom. Her payment is to help Dr Tom. Dr Naadiah takes Erica to Dr Tom's dark past when he was a violent man. Erica sees a part of him that she's never seen before and it scares her. Erica tries to prevent Dr Tom's suicide by thanking him for saving her. Erica now understands that Dr Tom was in therapy too just as she is now. Dr Tom tells Erica why he left her.

This is an intense introduction to season two. Seeing the other side of Dr Tom as a brute is shocking to me. I loved how Erica helped Dr Tom when he was about to commit suicide.",1310860800,,739,4.061643835616438
1872982,5,B00008YYV9,"""Being Erica"" is a quality show. Season Two continues to show the evolution of 32- year old Erica Strange as she grows through her unique, brand of time-travel therapy, guided by the mysterious Dr. Tom. This is supposed to be the time of her life where Erica finally has is it all- the editing job that she has always dreamed of, the boyfriend she has always wanted, yet Erica realizes that what she has always wanted might not be so perfect. Adding to the complications, Erica meets another time-travel patient, Kai, who is having a harder time adjusting to time-travel therapy.

""Being Erica"" is a show most of us, who have any regrets, can identify with. It does a great job, in 26 episodes (this includes 2 seasons) of showing how well-written characters can struggle with some of the same problems over and over again, yet finally learn from their mistakes, while growing and changing. Plus, it has some interesting science fiction/time travel elements to it, that really keep you hooked.",1302134400,,993,4.807017543859649
