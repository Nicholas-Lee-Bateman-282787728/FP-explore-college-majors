5559804,5,B00B6E4SGG,"This series was run in America as ""Planet Patrol"" in the early 1960s.  I remembered seeing this as a child on WPIX-11 from New York City.  It is a puppet show like Gerry Anderson's shows such as ""Thunderbirds,"" "" Supercar,""  ""Stongray,"" and ""Captain Scarlet.""  In fact it was amde by a producer who oroginally worked for Gerry Anderson.  While not as well made as the Anderson series it still has a charm and a presence that's entertaining after all these years.  One does have to respect the effort and workmanship that went into making this series in a era long before computer generated imagery made things at a puch of a button.
For those who appreciate old nearly forgottten TV shows... this is a gem.  If you like modern stuff ....meh, just turn your cable TV on.",1403308800,11,769,4.569343065693431
5559805,5,B00B6E4SGG,I LOVE Space Patrol and originally bought it from another distributor in the PAL version. (I actually bought a universal DVD player for it) I was thrilled to find it! The quality is about the same as the PAL version.,1384128000,5,216,4.425

8563291,5,B00B6E4SGG,Loved it; better than all of the Gerry Anderson's Supermarionation Series!,1432598400,,74,5.818181818181818
8563292,2,B00B6E4SGG,Interesting from a historical perspective but not nearly as good as Fireball XL5.  I like the Martian.,1416700800,,102,5.0
8563293,5,B00B6E4SGG,"This is one series that I wanted to get my hands on as this was one of my favorite shows I watched as a little boy. The set contains all the episodes plus a bonus feature. The video and sound quality is exactly as was presented back in the early 60's, not great but adequate to watch again. The chapters present remarkable accuracy in terms of science as it was known then plus moral lessons to be learned, ie. lying ans stealing is wrong and controlling one's temper. For the price, it can't be beat ($49.00)",1415059200,5,509,4.3125
8563294,5,B00B6E4SGG,"OK, OK, it's a little silly. And not up to the standards of Gerry Anderson, but still lots of fun to watch.

I like the secretary from Venus. She is very efficient and not bad looking (puppet wise anyway).  If you watched these shows as a kid you will certainly enjoy seeing them again.  Small children will enjoy the shows as well.  As for teenagers, it will go completely over their heads.

The series was made at a time when Western civilization (incorrectly) assumed that man would progress out into space.  I remember the early and mid-1960s well.  Almost everyone was space happy.

I suspect that these DVDs are homemade.  No problem in that, as the shows are now probably in the ""public domain"".  Excellent picture and sound. All the DVDs played reliably.",1410307200,7,762,4.661654135338346
8563295,5,B00B6E4SGG,"This charming British puppet show inspired J. Michael Straczynki's ""Babylon 5.""  Predating the original ""Star Trek,"" its cast included a female communications officer (Marla of Venus) and a Venusian officer on Galasphere 347 who was higly intelligent and had pointed ears (Slim).  The varied plots include a robot rebellion on Earth, a Neptunian cloud of metallic particles to block the sun from Earth, and an asteroid on a collision course with the capitol of Mars.  I enjoyed this 39 episode series as much as any of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson's puppet shows.  If you enjoy puppetry, try ""Space Patrol"" (which was broadcast under the title ""Planet Patrol"" in the United States to avoid confusion with the 1950's American TV series ""Space Patrol).",1409011200,8,747,5.098360655737705
