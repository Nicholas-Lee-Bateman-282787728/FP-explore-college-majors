My brother and I, when we are extremely bored, go out and rent horror movies in the hopes that we chose a real cheesy one that walks that thin line between horror and the ridiculous.  There were moments in this movie that made me laugh (eg: the tennis balls getting thrown at the killer or the boyfriend who is completely clueless)  However, there are better horror movies that could meet the needs of those who seek those cheesy horror movies:

Try- Slumberparty Massacre, The Granny, Cabin Fever",1174089600,,612,4.638888888888889
7895069,1,6305761906,"What the hell is this? Is this porno or a horror film? Thats what your constantly ask yourself as you watch this film. This movie is mindless,tastless, and lets not forget boring. Theris nothing but nudity and a bunch of quick flashesof various scenes which confuses the hell out of you. I thinkl they really tried to make this film somewhat of a thriller. The beginning of the movie is flooded with naked women dancing around all these men for a good five minutes and then it goes to a scene where one of the dancers leaves the bar then gets killed. At least I think she gets killed since they don't really show what happens to her. Or maybe they did and I wasn't paying attention because it was so boring. I knew from the very start of the film it wasn't going to be good. The acting is some of the worst I've seen and so is the castingof the serial Killer a.k.a the coroner. There no gore, just a bunch of blood  and flashes of blood spattering everywhere. What the hell is that about? Well anyway, there are some torture scenes, but nothing really special. The ending of the movie does not really explain much of what happens next. It's just like there all this stuff happening to the girl and it seems like she's got nothing else going for her then something happens at the end that's it. It doesn't explain what happen to all the stuff that was against her. This is another one of those movies where the director spends more money on the cover of the film box than he does on the actual film. They make the cover look all cool and make it seem like it will be a good movie to watch, but when you actually watch it you ask where the hell all the money went? I've fallen pray to that tactic many times and I hate it. Here is a word of advice for all you horror fans out there. If you see a movie in a viedo store and you never heard of it before and the cover of the box looks cool and when you read the plot in the back , it sounds a little cool, Don't rent it! Because most likely the film will suck badly. Maybe in some occasions the film will be good, but most of the time it will suck. Just like this one did. Do not bother on this total crap of a film!",1142380800,,2162,4.099056603773585
7895070,5,6305761906,"The best part in this movie was when actress Jane Longnecker tied up ""Leon"", chained him up in her basement and threw tennis balls at his face.

Also, when she was previously trapped in his house trying to get out, there was all this suspense built up and finally he came up behind her and hit her over the head.

I have no idea why this director doesn't make more movies like this. This was probabaly the peak of his career.

Please watch this movie if you haven't already!",1121472000,5,474,4.303370786516854
7895071,1,6305761906,"The star of this really dumb movie is Jane Longnecker.  Why would anyone seeking an acting career goe with a name like Longnecker?  And her co-star is Dean St. Louis.  Where were their agents when they chose such ridiculous names?  What's next Minnie Apellas St. Paul?  Or how about Della Ware Heights?  Oh, well.  THE CORONER is one poorly done piece of cinematic waste.  Aside from the awful acting, the script is so lame and ridiculous, there can be no chance for even suspending disbelief.  Longnecker's character does so many stupid things and the esoteric ending is laughably pointless.  If you find it in a bargain bin, choose something else..you won't be missing a thing.",1107648000,,679,4.826086956521739
7895072,3,6305761906,"I just saw the DVD version of this film, and liked
it.  I loved the O'Henry like twist at the end.
The color, sound and photography were very good.
I would have liked it more, as a psycological Thriller,
if we didn't know whom the killer was, almost from
the beginning.
Longnecker was very good/believable.",1008633600,4,306,4.5636363636363635
7895073,5,6305761906,"I thought the movie was excellent. It had every thing that would make up a fantastic horror movie. It had a lot of breast shots at the beginning and this guy with dark glasses on, whom you knew wasn't Mr. Niceguy. I thought the girl Longnecker was a fantastic actress and at the showdown between her and the coroner I thought was well matched. I use to produce and direct horror video movies and I would have loved to have an actress like Longnecker on my team. She was the kind of girl right from the start that showed spunk. I think anyone who likes horror will like this movie. Of course if I would have wrote it I would have put a little more horror in it by showing beautiful girls on the slab in the doctors private morgue. I would have gave a little more bloody screams, but all in all I would recommend The Coroner to all lovers of horror.",995328000,5,847,4.2024539877300615
7895074,1,6305761906,"To say that this movie is the worst I have ever seen would be overrating it.  The villain has a scar on his nose that comes and goes from scene to scene, and no, this is not an attempt at parody.  It is so unremittingly terrible that I can't even pinpoint anything.  Caveat emptor!",970185600,2,281,4.166666666666667
7895075,1,6305761906,"I got this film, as I love horror flicks.  I was never so disappointed in my life!  There's absolutely no continuity in it, it jumps randomly and without warning.  The script is terrible, the acting was horrid, and it  left me lost and confused and very irritated.  I think they made this as an  excuse to show some really badly done quasi-sex scenes, it was just the  worst.  Jane Longenecker looked embarassed to be in it, poor thing.
Still  need to satisfy your longing to see a movie along the lines of a creepy  Coroner?  Try the film Phantasm instead.  Anything but this!",961977600,3,577,4.495145631067961
7895076,3,6305761906,"with a title like The Coroner, I expected so much more than what this  movie delivered.  buckets of blood, disembodied body parts, organs,  bones... well you get the picture.  and this movie only had blood, not  alot, but some.
the basic story is that the local coroner is killing off  young female suicide victims.  young ladies that wanted to die but failed  in their attempts.  the coroner just wants to finish their job for  them.
his next victim happens to be a lawyer.  after catching her, he  tortures her in his basement before going in for the kill.  however, with  her, he asked for more than what he bargained for.  apparently, they teach  'buffy the vampire' style martial arts at the law firm.  the lawyer does a  few choreographed kicks and chops on the coroner and escapes.  I couldn't  help but laugh at the choreograph looking fights.
the rest of the movie  concerns the young lawyer trying to get back at the coroner for all he did  to her...  cutting off a finger.  she being a lawyer; he could/should have  done worse.
this movie is still fun to watch, if at least once.  but I  wanted to see so much more.  gore, gore, gore, was all on my mind as I  watched it.  and nothing of the like popped up.  there are a few blood on  women's bodies shots but that's about it.  and not alot of blood either.
maybe if the title was 'ally mcbeal and buffy team to get rid of the  local coroner' it might have worked.  but this coroner chops up his victims  real tame, if at all.",960681600,4,1487,4.338235294117647
7895077,4,6305761906,"I must confess: the only reason that compels me to write this review is the unbelievably stunning Jane Longenecker, who plays the female protagonist in this mildly entertaining horror shocker.
Seems as though  someone in San Francisco (or L.A., if you believe some of the horizon shots  or Jane's character looking at a street map of San Fran) has been  butchering strip girls and street hookers.  But not just any lovely will  do:  the victim in question must have been a suicide survivor (which, BY  COINCIDENCE, so is the female protagonist).
Seems as though the  perpretator is the city medical examiner (thus, ""The Coroner""),  who picks the lovelies up and takes them back to his well-equipped cellar  for a little torture before he dispatches them.  (Seems as though he  believes himself to be a demi-god who ""reclaims"" those who  survived their suicide attempt.)
Somehow, he latches onto the female  protagonist, the lovely Jane Longenecker, who plays an attorney  specializing in handling murder cases, getting hookers to go straight AND  being a general pain in the you-know-what for the local D.A.  The coroner  kidnaps her and takes her into the cellar, where he (and here the movie  made no sense) cut off part of a finger on her left hand and later appeared  to be carving stuff on her back.  (The football captain/cheerleader scene  will have you in stitches! )  She escapes, is caught, and then escapes  again (yeah, I know, I rolled my eyes up at that, but I kept saying to  myself, it's just a movie...)
Anyway, the rest of the movie (ONLY 75  MINUTES LONG, fer chrissake! ) has her going after this guy, to both teach  him a lesson and to make sure that he never does this to any woman again.  The ending is okay, and in general I give this movie four out of five  stars....good to kill some time, but it could have been SO MUCH BETTER....I  rank this right up there with Corbin Bernsen's The Dentist and The Dentist  2.....
Jane Longenecker looks like a young Jodie Foster!  I hope that  this will not stand in the way of her career, as certain people (who will  remain nameless, until that is the National Enquirer picks up on the story)  may want to derail her career in order to have Foster's remain  unchallenged.  YES, I believe that Jane Longeneecker is THAT GOOD!  (Whaddaya think, a ""name"" actor or actress will stand idly by and  let a competitor who looks A LOT like him or her ever succeed in  Hollywood? )  ANYWAY, I wonder if this is the same Jane Longenecker who  has been in Las Vegas Shakespeare performaces (always garnering good  reviews for her performances...)
PLEASE JANE, IF YOU READ THIS, SET UP  YOUR OWN WEBSITE!  YOU ARE A GREAT ACTRESS WITH EXCELLENT  POTENTIAL!  I AM IN LOVE WITH JANE LONGENECKER!  SHE IS  STUNNING!",959212800,3,2764,4.658333333333333
