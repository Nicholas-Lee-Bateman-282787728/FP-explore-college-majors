7848613,5,630349451X,I use this movie for my French classes when we study Paris in particular #1 and #3: the pickpocket story and the Picasso museum story. You have to like Eric Rohmer and the talking talking talking.,1426896000,,196,4.472222222222222
7848614,5,630349451X,"Rohmer loves capturing the streets of Paris,he loves the natural light,the open air,and setting Paris off to best effect. Most of all he likes to capture lovers or would-be lovers talking about love,the discrepancy between their words and their body language,what they outwardly say,and what they inwardly feel,which is harder to come to. Never a fan of close-ups,he liked to relate actor's bodies to their surroundings. In Rendezvous in Paris,he films  these 3 separate stories around the theme of rendezvous,with many a twist,coincidence and moral to hand. Are we hooked on the dialogue like a fish or do we see the shades of philosophy come in the not-quite-affaire or the quasi-romance or the yearning romanticism?

In ""The Seven O'Clock Rendezvous""a couple,Esther(Clara Bellar) and Horace(Antoine Boisler) decide they can't meet the following evening. She is shown to be a radiantly lovely presence,a trusting soul. But her faith is shaken in Horace by the suggestions of another young man who pursues her: he implies Horace has been meeting another woman. Her girlfriend advises her to be more manipulative and make Horace jealous. She is later seen in a crowded market -place approached by a handsome young man,who attempts to pick her up,she attempts to shake him off,but decides to meet him at a caf that evening where Horace has been seen with a date. Later finding her wallet missing,she wonders if it was her money he was after. This one was intriguing.

In ""The Benches of Paris""(my favourite) a teacher's attempts to get a woman already in along term relationship to live with him are both stimulated and frustrated by her feelings about the public spaces in which they are forced to meet She would not want to be seen in her own neighbourhood where she lives with Benoit; she hates misbehaving with a boy in public,or amongst other lovers;she won't go to her would-be lover's place-it lacks poetry,sheprefers public benches;her lover is affectionate, Benoit is not;she won't live with him,even if she breaks with Benoit;she is just using him to deal with Benoit;he's just a mirror image of Benoit,without whom he doesn't exist. She's more bothered about Benoit's lack of imagination,stealing her idea. Now Benoit has left,she doesn't need the lover any more. One empathises with the teacher's attempts to seduce her reduced to dust by her interminable logic. Her ideas of imagination take their toll as they stroll through 8 public gardens,beautifully filmed.

In the last,""Mother and Child"",a painter while viewing the Picasso painting of the title with a Swedish visitor, decides to drop her in favour of another art lover whom he pursues out of the museum. He uses his pick-up artistry to draw her into his studio. She (Benedicte Loyen) is a newlywed,who Rohmer uses to embody the essential mystery of art,in how he photographs her,how she behaves,her elusive,witty,sparkling ambiguity,she is a portraitist's dream:"" I like it that you're still searching"".His art has still a lot to learn. Rohmer's ideas on art are explored in this piece. A variety of beautiful backdrops is used,combining those Rohmer themes:seduction,elegant language and love for a city called Paris. A true return to ideals of nouvelle vague,matching mood and topography.",1398816000,,3261,5.170454545454546

In a 2nd story,The Benches of Paris, a teachers attempts to seduce a woman(Aurore Rauscher) already in a long term relationship are both stimulated and frustrated by her feelings about the public places in which they are forced to meet: I used to love him more than I love you now, but I don't love him anymore.""

7848616,3,630349451X,"I have seen all but 2 of Eric Rohmer's feature films, and being that he is my favorite director I am very critical of what I like and don't like. This movie is ideal for two types of people: Francophiles who enjoy different sights and sounds of beautiful Paris (at times the movie is almost like a travelogue, especially in the 2nd story) and Eric Rohmer completists. This movie was a real treat compared to Rohmer's last few movies, which were becoming more tedious and uninteresting since ""A Tale of Springtime"". This movie was made at the same time Rohmer was in the midst of his Four Seasons series and pales in comparison to any of them. Rohmer fans will love it and people looking for a slight, forgettable talkfest in Paris. For anyone looking to enter the world of Rohmer, I'd recommend the two films that immediately proceeded this one, ""A Summer's Tale"" & ""Autumn Tale"" over this",1083283200,7,889,4.59748427672956
7848617,5,630349451X,"""Paris by Day and by Night"" is the third in a series of four lectures on the ""French Impressionism: A School for Happiness"" by Rosamond Bernier.  The lecture is delivered by Rosamond Bernier at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, who speaks with great enthusiasm about the life of late-19th-century Paris in general and the paintings of Edgar Degas in particular.  I was rather surprised that Bernier would spend more time talking about Degas in this lecture than she did Claude Monet in the previous outing, but after hearing her explain the significance of a dozen Degas paintings it is clear that there is simply more to talk about here because Degas tended to paint people while Monet was enamored with places like train stations and buildings or objects like haystacks and water lilies.  But as much as this is about the artists and their works this is also about Paris, from life as it was lived behind closed doors to the night-world of theater, music halls, circus, and boulevard cafe.
Bernier was the European features editor for ""Vogue"" magazine in the years after World War II, where she became friends with the masters of the School of Paris such as Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, and Joan Mir. In 1955 she founded the art magazine ""L'OEIL.""  However, just listening to her talk about these paintings is enough to convince you of her expertise.  ""Paris by Day and by Night"" follows ""The Cast of Characters"" and ""Modern Art and Modern Manners: 1860-1874"" in this series, which is completed by ""An Accessible Paradise.""  Of course, you should watch these in order and you should also watch each one more than once, because unlike the lectures you remember from college, these Bernier's lectures can be enjoyed repeatedly.  After you finish her mini-art appreciation course on the French Impressionists you can move on to some of her other equallyl informative lectures on other types of art.",1047340800,2,1896,4.88785046728972
7848618,3,630349451X,"Really good movie, 3 interesting stories, good acting, great scenery of Paris.  The only problem is the quality of the VHS picture.  I purchased a new copy from this store, and watched it the very first time.  I was very  disappointed with the picture that kept moving constantly.",951782400,,280,4.770833333333333
