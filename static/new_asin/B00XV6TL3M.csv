8716687,4,B00XV6TL3M,"After the atomic wars the 2% of the human race that is left is devastated. They turn to machines to make their lives tolerable. As the machines evolve they eventually become more human looking and more efficient.

Capt. Kenneth Cragis (Don Megowan) is the head of an organization of flesh and blood that is determined to keep the machines in their place.

It looks like there is conspiracy to replace key people with machines called humanoids (R-97) that do not know their machines for 11 hours out of the day. What can anything be worse? Yes, The Craigs sister is involved with in R-35. An R-100 would be totally human.

Can the Craig and his newfound girlfriend, Maxine Megan (Erica Elliott) thwart this diabolical scheme by a cabal of humanoids?

Just a side note at one time I owned an R100 made by Mazda.",1529107200,,809,4.597222222222222
8716688,4,B00XV6TL3M,"Fantastic. I was so thrilled to finally find a copy of this old sci-fi movie. I remember seeing it on TV many times in the early 1960's as a kid. Having only a black and white TV set as a kid I was surprised the movie was in color. While the special effects are dated, they are not the main point of this picture, but rather the dialog and concept make this movie a classic. I had been looking for this movie for years without knowing the title, but only the last scene where Dr. Raven talks about R-100 self-replicating robots and us the audience. I was Googleing science fiction movies released by year and finally found this title when I got to 1963. I immediately jumped to Amazon and found it. I highly recommend this film for any hard core science fiction enthusiast.",1511136000,,773,4.375
8716689,3,B00XV6TL3M,"This film was playing the first time I was NYC and my dad took me to see it in Times Square.  I have remembered it every since and was curious to how I would react today.  The story is post-Apocalyptic, when human have created robots that are approaching sentience.  Humans need the robots to work, given the devastation of the nuclear war, which has impacted birth rates to such an extent that the human race finds itself threatened.  There is a group of humans who oppose the robot refinements, kind of vigilante terrorists who monitor the behavior of robots and challenge them whenever they can.

Something is clearly afoot, but the principal protagonist - one of the vigilantes - can't figure it out.  He discovers that his sister has purchased a robot as a mate, which he vehemently opposes; at the same time, he meets a woman with whom he quickly falls in love, something he has seems never to have done.  Programmed apparently in accordance with Asimov's 3 laws of robotics, they cannot harm humans and must work for the good of man.  I do not wish to play the spoiler, but the resolution and explanation are  quite surprising and interesting - it is true hard scifi.

The film offers an interesting take on how society is developing alongside the robots.  The ethical dilemmas posed are similar to the ones in Ex Machina.  Unfortunately, the pace of the film is very slow and the acting is mediocre.",1444089600,,1407,4.629032258064516
