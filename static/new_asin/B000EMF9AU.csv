8111095,4,B000EMF9AU,"The dvd gives some really good informational tips for hitting a slowpitch softball. I was able to pick up some points about hitting the ball in many different ways. Being a power hitter I have always looked for the long ball pitch, but have started to change my swing to hit hot base hits when needed to save the home run until needed.",1335744000,,335,4.333333333333333

8111098,5,B000EMF9AU,"I think anyone interested in getting better with their slowpitch swing will do awesome with this dvd.  I like the fact that it laid out the rotational hitting in a very organized manner with slowmotion shots of good swings but also it uses alot of other hitters who then give their insights on how they perceive the same mechanics.  surely they spent alot of time getting rec and pro hitters tracked down and interviewed but for me that was a great help. It also features part two which is switching from homerun and power hitting to many ways to basehit. Including slowing the swing down, changing stance and footage and some great technique I never knew about.

  The best part is the video quality is superb and its pretty creative in using music and video overlays to make it entertaining.  Pro guys swing at the end, so you can compare your swing to theirs..they are swinging in national hoemruncontest.  Just a great tool and fun to watch.",1143936000,,945,4.622754491017964
