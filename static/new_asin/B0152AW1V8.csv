8732443,1,B0152AW1V8,Was the documentary about Noahs Ark of the Bible? Why is the type they made round even though the Bible specifically says that it is rectangular. The title should be The Secrets of An Ark.  Not Noahs. At least not Noahs Ark of the Bible.,1533081600,,237,4.266666666666667
8732444,5,B0152AW1V8,"As with just about every single Nova program, this one was very enlightening, covering how one Babylonian Tablet, containing a story written over 4000 years ago, pertains to modern depictions of past events and explores just how Noahs Ark might have been made, meeting with experts in the field of Boat Technology and Researchers to build a boat accurate to the time.  This was an enjoyable watch for me.",1495238400,,404,4.855072463768116
8732445,5,B0152AW1V8,"I love it! It brings up many, many questions and makes me dig deeper into differing religions to try and understand my religion, Christianity,  I have had a burning question in my mind for as long as I can remember. OK, God created the earth and everything in it ! Where was he when he did this ???? I have never been given any answer that satisfied my curiosity.  The video also gives one an imagination as to other floods and other boats? Is this real or are they all a MYTH ?  I guess we'll never know , but we can believe and have FAITH that what we've been taught is correct.",1485129600,,580,4.115044247787611

8732447,5,B0152AW1V8,"The title of this show is misleading, I did not watch this show when it was originally aired as I thought it was just another story of Noah's ark.  I found out it is actually about the original ark stories that were told long before the Hebrew bible was written.  I had read the book ""The Ark Before Noah: Decoding the Story of the Flood"" by Irving Finkel ( well worth a read) explaining about the story found in cuneiform writings on clay tablet.  The people involved in this adventure try to build a boat according to the information in the description on the tablet, but only about 1/5th scale as a full size one would not be manageable and they doubted it could float.
This is a great program as they explain how the story that predates the bible by centuries was adapted as a moral lesson by the Hebrews while in exile in Babylon.  As most scientist and historians have concluded long ago when a major flood occurs in an area, most of the people that lived there had never left that area in their entire short lives and so to them the flood affected the entire world because to them that area was the ""entire world""
The 1 star reviewers are obviously devout Christians, as to them anything that does not agree with the bible MUST be wrong even though the bible is not historically accurate.  Just the idea that after ""the great flood"" Noah, his wife and his sons and their wives repopulated the entire world (including all Africans, Asians, etc.) is a bit much to believe.",1482364800,2,1477,4.435424354243542
8732448,3,B0152AW1V8,"This is about ancient text found on an ancient stone that supposedly predates the Torah. It therefor claims that the story of Noah's Flood was culled from other writings. The text of the stone suggests a round boat rather than a rectangle. Some people aspire to build a 1/5 replica size reproduction and see if it will float. Includes some CGI. Surreal, weird.",1471046400,,360,4.73015873015873
8732449,5,B0152AW1V8,"The Nova series looks and science and demonstrable historic facts and concludes, with the help of experts from the British Museum, that ancient Israelis were conquered by the Babylonians and were taken as captives back to Babylon, where they were taught the Babylonian story of Gilgamesh, which includes the story of a flood parallel to the story of the Bible and where the boat was round, in the fashion of other boats of that age in Mesopotamia.. When the Jews left Babylon, they took with them the Torah, which included Noah's story of the flood. The folks at Nova suggest that there was no evidence of that story before ancient Israel was conquered by Babylon. The one star reviewers appear to say that if the Nova story is different in any way from what their edition of the Bible says (they do not say which edition of the Bible they accept as the one true version) then it is a one star abomination, presumably only because one star is as low as Amazon lets you go.  You decide.",1466208000,5,985,4.533707865168539
8732450,1,B0152AW1V8,"""You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free.""
This is definitely not the truth. They try to convince you the Ark was round, when the Bible clearly describes it as long, and rectangular. Nova also draws their sources from Babylonian texts, and they did not worship the one true God. Being that the Babylonian empire is the byproduct of Abraham's decendents, it isn't surprising they have a similar flood story.
Now don't take my word for it, seek out the truth. This is helpful",1461196800,4,491,4.590909090909091
