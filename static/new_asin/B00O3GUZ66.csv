8681823,5,B00O3GUZ66,Great silent film by Cecil B. DeMille developing his style for better movies to come.  Picture quality not great but good enough to enjoy for a movie of that time period.  The story adaptation was really good considering the length of the book and the short time used for the film which left me wishing the film had been longer.  The performance by the actors was entertaining displaying the various emotions and facial expressions needed for silent films.  The character of Trampas was played well and seemed to be a forerunner of the standard B-movie western villains to come.  Definitely worth a viewing for those who enjoyed the book and like early period westerns.,1519776000,,669,4.833333333333333
8681824,4,B00O3GUZ66,"A real curiosity piece as this Famous Players - Jesse L. Lasky silent film was made one hundred years ago and it was the first in which director Cecil  B.  DeMille got sole credit.  Quaint terms in the credits: De Mille listed as Director General and the film: Picturized by Cecil B. DeMille.
Probably everyone is more familiar with the sixties Universal television series but this old Owen Wister western opus has been around for yonks with the original story being first published in 1902.  It  became a stage play and this was the first of four film versions so you can see that The Virginian, Steve, Trampas and Molly have had  remarkable staying power.  People who got to love Steve and Trampas in the television series will be surprised by their portrayal in this flicker.
Understandably the print leaves much to be desired but I found it quite watchable and remarkably entertaining.  The fast moving storyline has enough comedy, action and romance to perhaps even demand a longer running tiime than its 55 minutes.  Dustin Farnum has a fine touch with both comedy and heroics in the title role and Winifred Kingston comes across as a wholesome love interest and a woman who looks more than capable of handling the ""wild west"".  But the success of the film probably comes from the sure hand of DeMille who even at this early stage of his filmmaking career clearly knew how to successfully translate story to film and captivate an audience.  Cynics may sneer at the creakiness, simple plotline and coy characters but this was original and ground breaking in its day - back in 1914!",1414281600,6,1586,4.7309090909090905
