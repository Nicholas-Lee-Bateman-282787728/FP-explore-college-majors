7819859,2,6301973003,"Kristen (played by Catherine Oxenberg) is a soap opera actress.  She's been receiving some weird fan mail from someone where she works.  Then someone had put a knife in her purse.  Her only comfort is her boyfriend, Phillip, played by David Naughton (An American Werewolf in London [1981]).  There is also this crazy fan, played by Karen Black (Trilogy of Terror [1975-TV], The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver [1977-TV]) that rants at her at the studio gate when she tries to leave from work.  But someone is really trying to scare her and is after her.  The last 10 minutes will surprise you.  This is a shorter film.  Rated ""R"", it only runs 80 minutes.",1061596800,5,657,4.6521739130434785
