7867318,4,6304289278,"following is description as on box. Episode 1: No Need For Discussions! - Our first episode opens with Tenchi's monologue as he reminisces about ""those days."" This narration is important, as you will see at the  end of this series, so just keep it in mind.
 Episode 2: No Need For  A Princess! - The rivalry between Ryoko and Ayeka goes far back to their  childhood. What facts could possibly build the kind of childhood stories  they tell? You are going to see this old conflict erupt again during this  series. Now you will have a chance to see Ryoko as a little girl for the  first time.
 Episode #3: No Need For Worries! - Lucky you! You're  going to meet two of our most popular characters Ryo-ohki and Sasami in the  same episode. Like any other pets, our Ryo-ohki has her favorite food;  carrots! As for Sasami, you can enjoy watching her both in her space suits  and everyday clothes.
 Episode #4: No Need for Monsters! - It is  Washu we find in that cave, not Ryoko like in the OVA series. From this  point on, our TV series starts to take a clearly different road from the  OVA series. For instance, Mihoshi and Washu do not seem to have any special  ""love"" feelings for Tenchi. By the way, don't you love the little  Washu Puppets cheering on Washu's shoulders? They could make a perfect  merchandising item!
 I was pusueded to rent ""Tenchi Universe Vol  01 on Earth"" by my Dad.  . I had been planing to rent the anime  ""Boah"" because I had seen an anime comedy the night before and I  was in the mood for something seiros ( I viewed ""Boah"" a couple  nights later, and, trust me, It was absolute drivel). But anyway, I decided  to rent ""Tenchi Universe Vol 01 on Earth"".I mean, It has tons of  followers and fans. They can't all be wrong...  My thoughts started  drifting.  ""Dragonball Z "" is one of the most most popular  animes,and it's not that good even if it does offer pretty decent fight  scenes. So, I didn't have ""Tenchi Universe Vol 01 on Earth"" high  on my to see list because of that. Maybe I saw the movie because of fate,or  maybe ""Tenchi Universe Vol 01 on Earth"" tape had 4 episodes on  it, while the original OAV series has only 1 episode per tape. ""Tenchi  Universe Vol 01 on Earth"" was  about 4 times longer than a OAV tape,  and of coarse, 4 is better than one. What I was expecting was a so-so,  poorly animated anime with corney dubbing (subtitles are usualy better than  dubbing). Boy,was I wrong!
 The dubbing in this anime is excellent.  It seems like, with most animes, the dubbing is poorly acted and laughable.  Not so with ""Tenchi Universe Vol 01 on Earth"". Its all well  acted. It all sounds very convincing. Each voice matches the characters  personalities. ""Tenchi Universe Vol 01 on Earth"" is one of those  rare animes that in which you actually prefer the dubbing more than the  subtitling. It's really great dubbing.
 While I'm talking about  sound,I'd like to mention the the music is great for an anime. Instead of an  annoying MIDI playing and a woman with an extremely bad voice, singing  boring lyrics, ""Tenchi Universe Vol 01 on Earth"" Offers some VERY  catchy songs. The opening song is very singable,and very fun. I really  enjoy the song that blares during the credits. Its lyrics are very funny.  The interesting thing about the song is that The lyrics are depressing, yet  the music is upbeat.  ""When you go fishing/ you get a boot/ or some  other trash/ when you play cards/you lose all you cash/""  The lyrics  are quite funny , and fit in with ""Tenchi Universe Vol 01 on  Earth"".
 Another good Thing about ""Tenchi Universe Vol 01  on Earth"" is the story. Tenchi muyo Weaves a excellent, unique, and  very funny story. Each character enters the story smoothy. The plot is very  well put together, and it makes you laugh over and over again. But its also  very touching. With each volumn, It seems to get better and better.
  The animation is also well done. ""Tenchi Universe Vol 01 on  Earth"" may not have the best animation,but its certainly pretty. The  environments are very lush. When the characters move, they move smoothy,  not stiffly.

 I seroisly recommend this anime.  Its watchable  over and over again,and its humor is wonderful.  Its a true classic. I  loved ""Tenchi Universe Vol 01 on Earth"". I like a lot of  anime,but I don't own very much.  I enjoyed this anime so much that I saw  the next tape the next day. Now,I am planing to go out and buy all 8  volumns. That says something. Please,stop reading my review and go rent it.",954806400,21,4502,4.480793060718711
