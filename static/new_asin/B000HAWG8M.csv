This aside I was impressed with the effort made by the producers to be accurate to check facts and to cover many angles and make it truly interesting. The footage of the Rat temple in India was fascinating. Unlike one of the other reviewers I applaud the inclusion of the Wiccan priest because after all they were trying to show how these animals fit into other belief systems. It was completey appropriate. Though I was personally only involved in the Rats segment I really enjoyed the  Bat and Bug segments too. My only complaint would be the Alice Cooper narration which was probably done to fit more into a ""scary Halloween"" theme. I think the original idea was more scholarly but this sadly made it more sensational. Originally I got a free copy on Video from the History Channel but I was so pleased to see it was now on  DVD I purchased a copy from Amazon.",1409529600,,1006,4.461956521739131
