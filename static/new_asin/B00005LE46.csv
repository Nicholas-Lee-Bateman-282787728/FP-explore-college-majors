1621564,4,B00005LE46,"I'd been looking forward to Moby's ""Play"" DVD ever since he announced on his website that it was going to be made (which I think was back in March)! When I finally picked up a copy, I was impressed by how many extras are included on this DVD.
First of all, there are the videos. Some are not in the best of quality, but it doesn't matter. They're all still very interesting to look at. My only complaint is that the ""glasses"" version of ""Bodyrock"" and Moby & Gwen's ""South Side"" are not included on this DVD. Still, seeing such wonderful works like ""Honey"" and the Nick Brandt version of ""Porcelain"" make up for that.
Secondly, the megamix. It's a very interesting concept: put together a 90-minute remix of seven different songs on ""Play"" and put them to warped visuals. When the idea works, it's a great experience, but when it doesn't, the megamix gets awfully repetitive. Nevertheless, it's a very enjoyable extra.
The ""Give an Idiot a Camcorder"" home movie really reveals a lot about Moby's personality. It shows his wit, humor, spontaneous nature, and, of course, his ability to use a handheld camcorder. A lot of the video is hilarious, but be warned: There is a good deal of profanity in the first half of the film. Parents should watch it first before deciding if their kids can watch it.
The live pieces from ""Later with Jools Holland"" are the best pieces on the DVD. It's impressive to see electronica songs being performed by an entire band, sometimes even acoustically. ""Porcelain"" and ""Go"" are the best pieces on the DVD.
Lastly, you can make your own remix of ""Bodyrock"" and ""Natural Blues"" on your DVD-ROM computer. If you don't have a DVD-ROM, you can access these programs on Beatnik.com.
Overall, it's not perfect. But if you really liked ""Play"", consider adding this to your DVD collection.",996192000,,1810,4.69496855345912
1621565,2,B00005LE46,"This is the worst collection of videos that highlight exactly what a geek Moby is - nobody in these videos does anything, leaving the viewer wondering why they were made at all...The only good thing about it, and why I gave it 2 stars, is the remix section, which has some interesting visuals...don't waste your money on this ridiculous DVD!!",995846400,,342,4.716666666666667
1621566,5,B00005LE46,"The videos and music are one thing.  The sound alone is another.  The ""Give an Idiot a Video Camera"" is in a class all it's own.  A definite must for any Moby fan.
First off, the videos:  AWESOME!!!  The audio on this DVD is a perfect example of why DVD was created in the first place.  The best of Moby's Play is included, amongst them: ""Honey""( personal favorite), ""Natural Blues""(beautiful song), ""Bodyrock""(both versions hilarious), and ""Porcelain""(I prefer the Eye-Version).  One thing that baffled me was why ""Southside"" wasn't included.
""Give an Idiot a Video Camera"":  A hilarious ""documentary"" created by Moby, which is a definite acquired taste. It runs 20 minutes, and kind of gave me the feel of a Guy Ritchie-type thing.  Some of the funny things include Moby ""interviewing himself""(Moby in a costume, asking questions, intercutting previously taped answers from himself from past intwerviews), a spoof of his house on ""MTV Cribs"", and the funniest, he trying to find a festival in France, resulting in calling it a Piece of Shi... numerous times.
Rounding it out is a 90 minute megamix of his videos.  A great pick for any Moby fan, I'm thrilled I picked it up.",995500800,5,1175,4.85929648241206
1621567,4,B00005LE46,"There's a lot to enjoy on this DVD, for a good price.  Content is good, with numerous videos where a good idea carries the day, as opposed to eye candy and flash.  Several videos have more than one version, and the differences between them are most interesting.  You can speculate what market forces brought a second version of a video into being.
The Mobymix offers a continuous 88 minutes of Play remixes, and comes with the modern equivalent of a ""video fireplace"" as trippy visuals accompany the remixes.  Put this on when friends are around and let it go!
Live footage looks fine.
The questionable aspect with this DVD is a number of the videos seems to have come from a VHS source.  Video noise, dropouts, and lack of sharpness are all there.  Not all videos are this way, but quite a few are.  Given the nature of music videos, its hard to tell if this was intentional, but it seems a bit odd that so many of the videos are presented this way.
So - a question mark about the videos presentation, but great content and well worth a purchase.",995414400,2,1047,4.450261780104712
1621568,5,B00005LE46,"I was literally floored by this DVD. I was expecting mostly a video collection with some extras, but imagine my surprise when the 'extras' such as the megamix of remixes end up making this one of my favorite music DVDs ever.
The videos themselves are nice, with a number of them not before seen in the US (the European ones look like they were made on a smaller budget, but are still good fun to watch). Having the videos for songs like Honey and the original ""audition"" Bodyrock treatment are a blast. The live songs are amazingly well produced, and it's fun to see Moby with full backup band in tow. He even throws in 'go' and 'new dawn fades' from older releases. The video and sound quality for these segments is really topnotch.
But my favorite part of the DVD, by far, is the megamix of the various 'play' remixes, with new tripped-out visuals to accompany the songs. It's actually quite engrossing. Some of the visuals are your standard G-Force trippy screensaver type deals, but others are wildly imaginative and quite arresting. The remixes are also great in their own right, giving the original songs wildly different interpretations. The 20-minute camcorder bit in Moby's studio is fun, but not exactly arresting.
This DVD instantly jumps into the company of the Criterion Beastie Boys collection and the 'Everything, Everything' DVD from underworld. The megamix part of the disc alone would justify the purchase price.",995328000,8,1430,4.864754098360656
1621569,5,B00005LE46,"Im a fan of this incredible, talented and multytasking artist,  im waited for a long time to get a inteligent shorts of music, im called shorts because there are away to be Videoclips, MOBY has a great talent to make music and images, the compilation of his outsanding CD PLAY must be inteligent from the shorts, the menu and the package.
Shorts from Porcelain to another hits show me that i don't have to wait no more, well a few weeks to have it in may hands.",993772800,3,461,4.2988505747126435
1621570,5,B00005LE46,"From Natural Blues to Bodyrock to Southside, Moby is awesome.  The was he captivates you with the sound of ever song is amazing.  This man is very talented!  Get this DVD if you love the CD.",993600000,2,190,4.222222222222222
1621621,5,B00005LE46,"What an amazing dvd this is,words cannot describe it only the music and video can. This is a diamond in the rough and if you love music this is a must. What ever I write cannot do justice to this dvd. It connects with your unconscious booming and throbbing into your heart,mind, vision and soul. IN megamix,which goes on and on leading you to another world or a glimpse of another dimension, throws one mandela forms after another at the veiwer. This all makes for a pleasant day. I recommend getting a set of prism glasses (like are enclosed in ""Sidney's psychedelic adventure"" titled HEADCANDY (DVD) to view megamix,  but it is great without it too.",1062201600,,651,4.612068965517241
1621622,4,B00005LE46,"Having watched this DVD a number of times over the last 18 months, it's still lots of fun to watch and to listen to. Briefly, there are the 'play' videos, megamixes of 'play' tracks, an amateur movie shot by Moby on tour, and a live set recorded in Britain that's taken from the 'Jools Holland' music show.
I'd forgotten how inventive the 'play' videos were, and many of the megamixes sound like great techno grooves, although some of the megamix visuals look no more exciting than computer screensavers from a decade ago. Moby's movie is funny, and he's quite a comedian with a grim sense of humor. What originally attracted me to buying this DVD was the live 'Jools Holland' set, as I've worn out a video I'd recorded from the original television show that was broadcast back in the year 2000. Those live numbers are just sensational but the whole set clocks in at just 23 minutes. Extra live cuts from other shows would have made this DVD brilliant for me, and that's why I can give this disc only 4 stars out of 5.",1057017600,,1018,4.478494623655914
1621623,5,B00005LE46,"I have never written a review before... it always seemed kind of like a waste of time.  However, this DVD is wonderful.  If you are considering purchasing it and you like Moby (especially live) I would highly recommend this DVD.",1031356800,,228,4.675
1621624,5,B00005LE46,"Moby, aka Richard Melville III~has a sense of humor that has been a well-kept secret apparently.  It shines through tremendously in this completely awesome DVD.  Included in this package are the music vids from the ""PLAY"" CD, plus bonus vids that were never released stateside.  What I was first wowed by, though, was ""Moby's Megamix""...a montage of remixed versions of ""PLAY"" songs, all gussied up with the most incredible visuals I've ever seen--even when I worked with Alex Paterson of The Orb!  A non-stop barrage of sound and vision, this portion of the DVD rawks!
Then, I flipped over to the ""Give An Idiot A Camcorder"" scenes.  OHMYGAWD!  I was laughing so hard from the time it began until I had to shut it off to catch my breath.  Just a candid, script-free sequence in which Moby walks around with a camcorder....it's funny!  I haven't even made it to the rest of the DVD because of this portion!  Buy this now!",1028592000,,921,4.670807453416149
1621625,4,B00005LE46,"The good things about this DVD:
--a slew of videos for songs from the blindingly popular PLAY CD, including two or three that haven't been seen before in the US.
--an uproariously funny short film called ""Give An Idiot A Camcorder"", which suggests that if Moby stops making music, he could always be a talk-show host
--a superfine hour-long megamix of remixes of Moby songs (the mix is done by Moby, BTW), complete with futuristic high-tech visuals (which are also nice background eye candy for house parties)
--live performances by Moby from the British JOOLS HOLLAND show
--DVD-ROM goodies (which admittedly, I don't have the capability to try out just now)
the cons:
--there are a couple of videos missing:  the 3rd version of BODYROCK (involving Run-DMC and a magic pair of glasses that turns everyone into a Solid Gold dancer) and the video for SOUTH SIDE with Gwen Stefani.  Dern.
--the submenu for audio setup chucks you straight into the videos after you make your selection between stereo or 5.1.
Aside from these two tiny gripes, it's nice.  Buy it.",1025222400,,1059,4.8397790055248615
1621626,5,B00005LE46,"Quit complaining about Southside not being on here! The song was awesome BEFORE he decided to use somebody who was already mainstream just to get played on MTV. I like Gwen and all, but I just thought that was just a ... attempt to get more people listening to Moby. I'm glad they left it out, it doesn't feel like Moby even really made it, and that's what this DVD is all about, just Moby. I love the videos on there, some of which were released in US, and the others I am guessing either were made for the DVD or had been released in Europe. The ""Give An Idiot A Camcorder"" was so funny, I love the fish puppet, nice touch Moby :) The only part I didn't care for was the rave mix, just because I'm not too big into rave music like that. But I still gave this DVD 5 stars, because it's not like I HAVE to watch that part, and it still delievers everything else I could ask for.",1019606400,2,878,4.051724137931035

Play The Dvd
V2 Records
 All Moby ever wanted us to do was play. Press play and let it happen. The digital video counterpart to the brilliant Play  (1999 folks, that's 2 years ago) is a bpm shy of perfection in terms of an audiovisual synopsis of an artist's personality and creativity. Not only does the Play The DVD  contains all the music videos that have previously graced the boob tube, but also includes outakes and extra footage/animated versions of Moby's audacious worldviews and slightly off-beat, unrestricted wit. ""Bodyrock (Auditions)"" give nods to reality-based television programs as streetfolk give their best in front of the curtain to try out for the dance-laden video. Think Fatboy Slim's ""Praise You"". Simple yet effective animated versions of ""Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad"" and ""Natural Blues"" incorporate one of Moby's many alter agos, Little Idiot and co-stars his trusty canine companion.  The highlights include the giddy commentary in the ""Give An Idiot A Camcorder"" section where Moby hosts a trail of quirky, yet memorable moments during his European 2000 tour. Stops in an airport in Germany, the final performance on his tour at a castle in Edinborough, and a cluster of impeccable television performances (from BBC's Later with Jools Holland) are included where he confesses his admiration for unsung hero Ian Curtis and Joy Division during a tearing cover of ""New Dawn Fades"". Fish puppets figure prominently, the Moby-ster getting swallowed in the ball pit, a tour of Moby's house, and a few self-mocking interviews run abound where Moby (in several guises) asks himself absurd questions concerning world climates, the origins of chewing gum, and the best guitar solo ever strung up. ""Moby's Megamix"" features a 90-minute continuous mix of Play's singles (a nod to Moby's rave roots), all remixed and is accompanied by a truly hypnotic demonstration of pure visual art that gives new meaning to `eye candy', more than capable of turning any home (or office) into a raging rave scene. The visuals appear sonically structured to match the beats of the music. In Play The DVD,  Moby embraces his inner geek self to demonstrate that he is and always has been the life of the party. People wouldn't expect it from the outset, but Moby has a sense of humour that equally matches his talent as a bonafide musician and visual artist.",1017187200,2,2364,4.98984771573604
1621628,5,B00005LE46,"I had been toying with buying this for three months, finally I broke down and bought it. Wow, why did I wait so long. I think that DVD is the way to buy music now. This album was incredible to begin with, but now being able to listen to it in 5.1 audio, wow. The video's are excellent. The remixed songs are fantastic, and the clublike videos that play on top of the remixs are pretty cool...that 20 minute ""Give an idiot a camcorder"" is hilarious.

The dvd has a good live set of 5 or 6 songs, a 1 1/2 hour ""mexamix"" (really the gem of the dvd), some home video shot by and starring Moby, and other neat things.

The ""Megamix"" was a wonderful addition as well.  There is a collection of live television performances that contain an acoustic version of ""Porcelain"" that is a lot of fun to hear in it's original concept.  I give it ""two thumbs up.""

2.  Several of the older vids/mixes have terrible pops and clicks from the 'vinel' records used for some of the mixes. A higher bit of quality control and clean-up would have prevented this.  Please don't tell me I spent 2K on a video/audio system to hear that 'snap crackle pop' as clear as a bell.  DUH!
3.  None of the older videos have been cleaned up.  There was quite a bit of 'video noise' and sad color saturation that just blew this DVD out of the running as anything other than marketing hype.
4.  I'm sad that ""MOBY"" didn't take a greater interest in this DVD, other than to help sweep more tape off the cutting room floor!",1005523200,3,879,4.284848484848485

1621654,5,B00005LE46,"As someone who was mesmerized by the Play album, I was delighted that this DVD was released.  Thankfully, it is not just a compilation of the videos produce for the music from the CD.  This disc includes a handful of videos never released in the United States.  Overall, the videos released from the CD were exceptional.  None were just your regular, boring video that a lot of artists produce.  They are definitely above par.  The Moby's Megamix that is contained on this DVD is also superb.  It is a continuous barrage of remixes of songs from the CD with accompanying visuals.  Play the DVD and go to the Megamix for some great remixes, but don't forget to pay attention to the visuals too.  Some of them are worth seeing.
Give an Idiot a Camcorder was a riot too.  You get to peak into the psyche of Moby.  He is actually a very hilarious guy.  Loved the various ""characters"" he played.  And one cannot forget the fish puppet.
The live performances offered on this DVD are also excellent.  I had never seen them before.  They are a nice addition to the DVD.
This could have been just another one of those compilations of music videos, but thankfully Moby knows what his fans want and has the creativity to come up with something better than the norm.  If you are a Moby fan, buy this DVD.  If you are not yet a Moby fan...buy this and you soon will be.",999993600,4,1356,4.403225806451613

The DVD is made up of a combination of previously seen material with some new things worth seeing:
-Play the videos: for the most part it's a compilation of videos from songs of the 'Play' album. Yes; incredibly missed here is a video for the song that Moby came to re-record alongside beautiful Gwen Stefani, ""South Side.""
-Moby's Megamix: Moby's Megamix: 90 minutes of remixes of Play's very best, which are synched to some very nice visuals ranging from kaleidoskopic views, to the most hypnotic takes you can imagine. It equally makes an excellent audiovisual background to the intro or the highest point any party you may throw at your place.
-Give an Idiot a Camcorder: features shots of Moby by himself while on tour, doing accents (Scottish, English with a French accent), including a not-so-glorious spot of him in a toilet, among other things.
-Live on TV Jools Holland: some (6) live TV appearances, where he plays some of his material as well as a long time Joy Division favorite of his.
-Play the computer: you can remix your own version of Moby's music.

The Mega Mix is 80 minutes of continuous music with constantly changing visuals.  I love the visuals!

I was not on NEARLY enough substances to make that seem cool.  The Moby home video of his tour has its moments but is only really worth 1 or 2 viewings.  Finally the videos -- some are outstanding, I have to say, while others are pretty lame.  Probably the best moment on the disc are the outtakes from auditions for the ""bodyrock"" video.  Id have to say I was expecting more gems like that.  The gwen stephani duet is a notable absence here which, like my review, should indicate the disc is targeted to only the die-hards.  Id suggest a rental first, even for them.  It definitely has its moments though, just don't expect too much.",996796800,6,947,4.416184971098266

The videos are well done, however I was surprised they didn't include the American version of Bodyrock, where Moby is wearing magic shades.  However, I was disappointed by the low budget production of some of them (such as ""Natural Blues Animated"", ""Bodyrock"", ""Why does my heart feel so bad"".
The Live compliation is excellent.  It is done with clarity and perhaps the best part of the DVD.  The remixes are great with very hypnotic visuals.  Excellent for dance parties.  The 20min Camcorder movie is hilarious.  The movie is a mixture of highlights from his european tour.  The 'create-your-own-remix' is tons of fun.  You can spend hours playing with it.
Overall, it's a great DVD, but with all DVD's we expect more.  For example, Southside video isn't included.  Things they could have included were lyrics, ""My Weakness"" [just because it's my favority =)], and bios.

7943856,2,B00005LE46,"First, let me state that I am a HUGE moby fan.  I own almost every single song he's released.  I understand why V2 Records would leave some things out, but what got left out was truly vital.

The videos - there are ten of them, though it should've been 12.  It's missing the ""South Side"" video and the ""Bodyrock"" video with the sunglasses.  The only two realy good videos of moby's from the ""Play"" era and they aren't even included.  The part that bugs me is that it wasn't a licensing issue - clips from both videos appear in the visualisations for the megamix.  Also, in the videos which are included aren't really that good.  The animated videos have highly limited appeal.  And the porcelain ""eye version"" is utterly pointless, you are looking into an eye the whole time showing a montage of very few images in the pupil.  The porcelain ""car version"" is alright, as well as the popular Natural Blues video - each tell a story and are genuinely inventive, relying on directing instead of a few random images.  Honey and Run On were made before play really hit it big, so you can tell that they're just low production value things made out of obligation instead of creativity.  Find my baby is a little funny, and gives you a look into moby's psyche a little.

""Give an idiot a camcorder"" lives fully up to it's name.  Moby tries way too hard to be funny and miserably fails.  The worst part is when he dwells over being a week late to a french cultural festival seemingly endlessly.

The Megamix is alright, though quite repetitive in some spots.  The visualizations are better than nothing (like with the 18 dvd) but the song selection definitely could improve.  Though they had some nice trance with Ferry Corsten, Katcha, and Perfecto it all sounded the same after a while.  Some of the breakbeat artists like Dani Konig, Dave Clarke, and Sharam were pretty good for the genre, which is generally repetitive in and of itself.  Overall the megamix isn't anything you'd listen to much but it's mildly entertaining the first time.

The live show is the most redeeming quality, along with the better produced videos.  Although you don't really see anything authentic, since he's not playing every instrument in his bedroom, you'll find a much different feeling - with all the  violinists, singers, another DJ, a bassist, and moby on the acoustic guitar - you get a little more intimate than just one bald vegan can get.  Porcelain sounds much clearer acoustic, and you can hear moby's voice and tonalization much better, porcelain actually sounds entirely new - that is more loving and less haunting.  Everloving is the only live song I have a real complaint with.  With a setlist of only 6 songs, you'd hope one wouldn't need a metronome as soon as someone goes acoustic, however moby does.  During the nice soft guitar that usually starts the song you hear a penetrative clicking which becomes harder and harder to ignore.

The entire DVD is pretty bad.  Mostly filler for about 1 or 2 things really worth watching.",1125619200,,3019,4.675521821631879

7943858,4,B00005LE46,"Overall, I really thought the videos could've been a little more creative and unique.  Some of the videos were just kind of weird in my opinion, and the good ones I never really called good, I just thought they were ok.  Some of the TV spots were good, like the one where Moby performs ""Go"" LIVE, that was impressive and was also the first time I have heard the song ""Go"" in general.  The MEGAMIX I thought was poor, a lot of the mixes and remixes were very dull and could've been a lot better considering there were some remakes of some of Moby's songs that were just slaughtered.",1098662400,,581,4.3119266055045875
7943859,5,B00005LE46,"Moby has long been associated with electronica and dance music, and I've often wondered why.  Although his classic CD ""Moby"" demonstraighs beautiful techno music making ability, his other CD's could very well be classified as ""rock"" in the category as say, Radiohead, Beck, or many other rock musicans who own a synth.  I would always be surprised when people associated Moby with Shasa and Digweed, or Paul Van Dyk.  Then i got Play the DVD.
Moby's CD play I've always liked and the DVD is a masterpeice.  Included is a 90 minute remix of Play known as a ""megamix"".  This explains why Moby can rightfully be classified with other techno greats.  Having been a fan of dance music for many years, and having attended many raves, I can truly say without question, Moby's megamix is one of the best DJ mixes I've ever heard.  Personal favorite tracks include his remix of Porcelain and Honey.  Overall, the megamix feature is worth the cost of the whole DVD and truly great trance.",1083801600,,978,4.711764705882353
