8192388,1,B000PMC5NS,This DVD is trash. We tried it with 17 dog owners in our community. It looks like stock footage of cartoons. No thought given to the authenticity of the claims. I would caution every dog owner to steer clear of this worthless rip-off.,1194739200,,234,4.465116279069767
8192389,5,B000PMC5NS,"Bought this dvd and my dog is crazy about it, I put it in after I  have watched the news and my little boy gets comfy to watch his movie and it is to adorable watching his little head move from side to side. I used to always leave the tv on for him but now I put in his doggy day care which is made just for him.",1181606400,2,312,3.5217391304347827
