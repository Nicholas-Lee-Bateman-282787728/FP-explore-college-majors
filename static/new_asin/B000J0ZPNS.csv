2665520,3,B000J0ZPNS,"I'm sorry but I need to express my huge(and expensive)frustration on this ""Klaus Florian Vogt leads an inspired cast with his extraordinarily transparent interpretation of the title role"" and ""Nagano's sublimely well-balanced musical interpretation"" production. In fact,KFV singing is just like Paul Elliott's  on the Hogwood's Messiah dvd,but Elliott was singing Handel. Who in the whole hell would approve such a childish,bizarre performance like this one?I disagree former rewiew;Ms Kringelborn isn't Elsa,unless the listener like chest notes so much and lots of mows all time;so obviously,this lady can't sing the Elsa's total range without her chest voice. Tom Fox;I would like to listen to him at live,however on this dvd Telramund seems dispirited and vague. Otherwise,Waltraud Meier performs a huge Ortrud's portrait and I don't think people is going so fair to believe just Kundry is her big role. This Ortrud here IMHO is the only one reason because I will not throw away my windows down this ""DEEPLY MOVING TOTAL-THEATRE EXPERIENCE""(very expensive as well,in three dvds),even if she seems in struggle with Nagano's wand in ""Entweihte Gtter!""';obviously she tried a faster and wild tempo instead Nagano's formalities(...)At the final curtain,an outstanding and well deserved ovation to Hans Peter-Knig;a great singing to Heinrich if not a great acting. Indeed I must to say chorus are superb as well,in despite I hate these hideous cuts here. Orchestra shine too.""Monumental sets"",costumes and the production are so,so;just a redundant one,that Lohenwagner over and over again(who in this world isn't so tired of this thing?)if not a wagnerian circus ring that stage directors love to do so much. Opera summary;purchase this ""highest order Lohengrin"" only in case you are a huge Meier fan,or a chorister boys in a silvered tuxedo fan,or a Opus Arte fu$$ fan.",1173657600,14,1868,5.397260273972603
2665521,4,B000J0ZPNS,"The sound is very good. The production, which calls for a self-absorbed, narcissistic Lohengrin, ""works"" BUT it robs this opera of some of its drama.  With the exception of our Lohengrin I found all the singers excellent as both singers and actors.  Elsa  and the villainous duo are really well done.  But our Lohengrin has a reedy, flat voice and his face rarely expresses emotion. There is a slight cut in the wedding march.  If you have this DVD, you'll find much to enjoy, but do not let it be your only exposure to this opera.",1171411200,8,531,4.489583333333333
2665522,5,B000J0ZPNS,"Wagner would very pleased with this production were he alive to see it.  This is a true gesamtkunstwerk -- The singers can really act, or should it be the actors can really sing -- and they all look their parts.  The spare staging, which is always appropriate and evocative also allows one to concentrate on the thrilling music.  The whole directorial concept hangs together right from the opening with an alone Elsa on the stage to the very end with Elsa dead and all in apparent chaos. This is not a fairy tale -- this is a dark interpersonal psychological drama, and kudos should go out to the editor who has put in many appropriate reaction shots to highlight the action.  Even the chorus is deeply into this production.

Solveig Kringelborn IS Elsa and I cannot praise her performance highly enough.  In this production she is the pivot around whom all revolves and she is rarely offstage.  Her angelic beauty radiates her innocence and purity.  The range of emotions she projects vocally and through her body language is quite remarkable.  Her sweet clear voice, so unlike, for example that of Eva Marton's Elsa, projects well and runs the gamut from almost otherworldly to deep despair.  Not to take anything away from the rest of her performance, what she does in the final act is a tour de force as she moves from hesitancy to increasing insistance and perhaps strength to demanding an answer to the forbidden question.  Watching this is to be carried away with the horror because we know where it will all end and we want to cry out, ""Don't do it, Elsa!"".  Her bereavement in the final scene must bring a tear or three to the eye.

Waltraud Meier -- what can one say about her that has not already been said so often?  Her dark beauty and rich mezzo voice are a splendid contrast to those of Ms. Kringelborn; and her acting is as excellent as her Kundry was in the previous year's Parsifal, also by Lehnhoff/Nagano.  She is evil personified here and radiates it with great power.  She is quite frightening in her intensity, control and manipulativeness.

Klaus Florian Vogt makes a wonderful other-worldly Lohengrin with his pure voice, his stiff demeanor, (and his shimmering suit).  As well as his beautiful renditions of the ""Mein Lieber Swan(s)"" and ""In Fernen Land""; in the first scene of Act III his love music and vain attempts to fend off Elsa's need for his identity are particularly striking.

Tom Fox as Frederich von Telramund is very good as a bombastic weakling under the control and stiffening of his evil wife; and Hans-Peter Konig is in fine voice as a powerful, but decent, regal King Heinrich.

Kent Nagano leads his excellent orchestra in a dramatic emotionally gripping rendition of the music (as he did in the Parsifal of the previous year).  He has even managed to make that hoary old chestnut (the vorspeil of Act III) fresh and exciting.

Nikolaus Lehnhoff has again come up with a dramatically tight production filled with little touches that seem so minor but add so much to the characterisation.  The drama of the contrasts between good and evil in the protagonists is intense and he has brought out the best in everyone.  The setting and costumes highlight Wagner's German nationalism and revolutionary associations in the libretto, which in turn emphasises the collapse at the end with the withdrawal of the looked-for protector and the arrival of a very young bewildered Gottfried.  There are some bits that sound better in theory (from interviews in the documentary) than work in practice, but I am not about to complain.

I should also add that it is a pleasure not to have the drama interrupted by applause.  Whereas it seems to have been performed in front of a live audience, there was no applause until the curtain call at the end.

In my opinion, this is a Lohengrin for the ages, and should be a touchstone for all other productions.

Finally, I would like to express my admiration for this production of Opus Arte.  The quality of the sound and picture is unequalled; and the extensive clear documentary, ""Never Shalt Thou Ask Of Me"", and the accompanying booklet are fascinating bonuses.  Opus Arte always makes a great contrast to the usual shoddy productions from Kultur.

I wish I could give this DVD set more than 5 stars.  It is a must have and will thrill even those who profess not to like Wagner operas.  It is highly dramatic, but also musically very romantic and lyrical.  Much as I admire Wagner's later operas, I do wish he had done at least one more in the style of Lohengrin.",1171324800,40,4540,4.703797468354431
2665523,5,B000J0ZPNS,"This production is a modernised production of Wagner's fairytale opera. It may not have as many supporters as it should due to the decision to stage it in modern dress with minimal sets. However, the singing is exemplary, with all the principals in top form. Special mention must be made of Vogt's Lohengrin, Kringelborn's Elsa and Meier's superb Ortrud, finally realised on DVD. Nagano also shapes the music with utmost care for the singers and the sound is superb!",1168992000,15,466,4.9113924050632916
8148488,5,B000J0ZPNS,"I am not much qualified to review opera on DVD as I only got into opera a couple years ago and have only watched a couple dozen on DVD.  Also I have no musical training to go by.  But from the perspective that I strongly prefer traditional staging, I went ahead with this rather non-traditional staged DVD mainly because I wanted to get a Wagner opera with Waltraud Meier in it.  I was not dissapointed.  In fact, I was delighted and finished all 4 hours (3 hrs opera plus 1 hr documentary) in short order.  It was my first time watching Lohengrin and I found this like the book that is so good you cannot put it down.  While the staging is non-traditional and appears to be relatively modern like maybe set within the past 30-40 years, it did not detract in the least from my viewing experience.  The main set feature was the sets of stairs and they were re-positioned in various ways that kept the set interesting.  The best part was the acting and vocals were in my estimation superb.  And since I picked this one particularly for Waltraud Meier, I will point out that as she is playing an evil woman, a sorceress in fact, she plays the part to the hilt and simply exudes evil in this production.  And as corny as it seems for Lonengrin to wear a shiny silver business suit, it worked for me just fine.  There is a scene in the bridal chamber where he is paying a weird piano (backward according to some other review), I did not find it a detraction at all.  The wedding march is not done as a march at all but as background music to the bridal chamber scene.  So, I highly recommend this set and as I watched the documentary first I think that helped me have a greater appreciation for the production.  There are two sound selections and I found the surround sound worked better for me even though I have a simple setup of computer speakers with separate woofer (either a sub-woofer or a pseudo sub-woofer).",1453680000,,1911,4.376770538243626
8148489,5,B000J0ZPNS,"In todays operatic world the Ring cycle has become a cult with opera houses trying to outdo each other in devising a new and newer concept year after year, so much so that Wagner's earlier, more formative works became overshadowed and even overlooked. This certainly wasn't the case even 30 years ago when Lohengrin was one of his most popular operas. Actually it was Wagner's first real breakthrough, in 1848, just before his exile, his first major success and his first work to get him international esteem. It was the first to enter Italy and the only Wagner opera that Verdi actually went to see and was impressed by it.

Unfortunately, as it's the case with so much Wagner, it has been subjected to a hundred years of heavy Germanic baggage and this tended to standardize productions in favor of the German myth, the Arian superhero, the majesty of the Empire etc etc. beloved by King Ludwig and who else, Hitler. This being said, it's doubly welcome to have a production of a fresh, minimalistic but beautiful concept, with all that traditional baggage eliminated. Sets are gorgeous, almost architectonic, with blues and whites dominating, the lighting is highly creative and everything is a joy to look at.

The singers are wonderful and I agree with the previous commentators so I do not need to duplicate. Waltraud Meir is probably the best, she is the most experienced in Wagner with many credits behind her - a perfect impersonation as the evil, malevolent Ortrud.
King Heinrich is also very impressive with a stentorian basso coming from a big bulk of a man. There is no weakness in the cast.

However, I most strenuously disagree with some high-handed comments about Kent Nagano. Some commentators take the easy way out and keep referring to the past, well serving Wagnerian conductors and reluctant to accept anyone new. What a HUGE mistake. I have been fortunate to see Nagano in action when he nearly brought the house down and the audience refused to leave.
Let me assure you, that anything he touches turns to gold. The gossamer-like shimmer of the Prelude is wonderfully shaped and it's a real test for a conductor. His tempi are brisk because he knows that slow tempi in Wagner could prove disastrous. This way this rather long opera really keeps moving without the pitfalls of many traditional performance I've seen where e.g. the 2nd act was a real tedium.
I loved this performance and recommend it highly as being arguably the best of modern versions (and that means sound quality too, make no mistake.)",1386979200,4,2526,4.829099307159353
8148490,2,B000J0ZPNS,"I admit to being partial to Abbado's Vienna performance with the thrilling, virile performance of Domingo in the title role and Cheryl Studer's lovely, sensitive Elsa,
both supported by an outstanding cast. That being said I find this Lohengrin a  pale reflection of that performance with a hero whose thin, milky voice is more suited to
singing Irish lullabies than  Wagnerian heroes.  The rest of the cast, with the exception of Kringelborn, is merely passable which in Wagnerian terms  means unacceptable.
There's little point in commenting on the sets and costumes;  these days it's ugliness a la mode where Wagner is concerned.",1377475200,,632,5.1568627450980395
8148491,2,B000J0ZPNS,"It's all about Waltraud Meier. She dominates vocally and dramatically. The other roles are sung competently enough, but that's about as far as it goes. I detect a whiff of sadism in the choice of Solveig Kringelborn as Elsa: Reminds me of Hitchcock, whose cruel streak was legendary, casting Jane Wyman opposite Marlene Dietrich in ""Stage Fright."" Musically, physically, dramatically, this Elsa seems to literally shrink when Ortrud struts her stuff. The wardrobe department only twisted the knife. Ortrud's tricked out in animal skins, black sabbath haute couture, and pagan dominatrix gear. Wimpy Elsa has just one costume change; from off-duty pharmacist's assistant to ""Brides"" magazine reject. Unfair? Nasty? Maybe that was the intent.

Too bad about that tacky costume, because Vogt's Lohengrin is a reaffirmation of what Wagner likely intended for this role: a kind of heroic Bel Canto minus the Bayreuth Bark. And apropos Bayreuth, where one is at least guaranteed a complete performance, this ""Lohengrin"" suffers from cuts to the choral parts in Acts Two and Three. Maybe forgivable in another vehicle, but not in this case, where the chorus is integral to the drama.

Skip that hour-long documentary on disc three. Ever notice how post-game, locker-room interviews with football players don't yield much? Ditto here. Tom Fox (Telramund) is a woefully inarticulate guy who's fallen in love with the microphone. Hans-Peter Koenig (King Henry)says rehearsals bore him. Ms. Kringelborn seems to have identified with her stage persona, with embarrassing results. Kent Nagano hasn't got much to say, but he wouldn't be my First Choice for a next door neighbor. Stage director Lehnhoff is a deadpan pedant who lectures, pontificates, and patronizes his listeners with a pastiche of neo-Freudian, Post-Modern claptrap. He's a CDD (Charm Deficit Disorder) poster child.

A bemused Mr. Vogt chats breezily away from inside his mobile home, and, most impressive, Madame Waltraud Meier is conspicuously absent.",1243123200,8,2008,5.4089456869009584
8148492,5,B000J0ZPNS,"What an excellent DVD of Wagner's Lohengrin. Though I'm only 25 years old, my critical eyes are somethimes to hard. However, this DVD is a great honour to Wagner. Singers like the tenor Vogt as Lohengrin, Kringelborn as Elisabeth and Meier as Ortrud does their roles to living persons.

The only thing that I really didn't like, is that the choirs interaction on consonants like their ""s"" is very tiresome when the choir sings a lot.

Enjoy a great opera.",1224460800,3,455,4.675
8148493,3,B000J0ZPNS,"The story of Lohengrin takes place in the Dark Ages, not in the Victorian era.  Thus this Victorian era production violates a basic requirement of the work.  The tenor singing the title role has a very high voice like a choir boy.  Thus not heroic and lyrical at best.  The two villains were played and sung superbly.  There were other castings that made no sense at all but I don't have the free speech to point those out.",1185926400,9,423,4.371794871794871
8148494,3,B000J0ZPNS,"Just as I am ready to dismiss and turn off this Lohengrin, I find something to like in it, so I keep watching (and hearing) and remain attentive to the performance. So, I guess at some level, it is effective.

I like the sets, massive but simple(Act II is quite striking). Costumes are dreadful (Lohengrin's are particularly ghastly, and the silver paint evidently rubs off, as one can see on DVD; Ortrud's however are glorious in a kitschy witch-madam sort of way, reminiscent of the Powell-Pressburger Tales of Hoffman). Texts for the many choruses do not lend themselves to the rather pedestrian contemporary clothes the poor choristers are called upon to wear; they look straight out of a Sear's catalogue.  If not ""period"" or ""timeless"", a less literal ""contemporary"" look would have seemed preferable. The production's conceit centering the opera in Elsa's mind is no more than that, and is neither original nor offensive.

But ultimately, the important stuff is the musical realization of Lohengrin, arguably Wagner's most melodious score and, direct descendant of Weber's Freischutz, the zenith of German romantic opera.  Here is where this performance really wants but, again, does not offend. I've never found Nagano an eloquent conductor (he has other virtues), and, with Wagner, he does not use the story-telling, dramatic devices built into the orchestral score.  The great Wagner conductors I can immediately think of, say Furtwangler, Knappertsbusch, Karajan, Kempe, currently Levine, all realize and convey drama in and from the pit.  Lohengrin lacks the contrapuntal glories of Meistersinger, the chromaticism of Tristan, the leit-motifs and rhythmic variety of the Ring, the unique musical language and sound-world of Parsifal.  But in Lohengrin musical phrases from the pit not only support but comment and at times carry the action, and indeed reach apex of rare melodic beauty, e.g., the violins,  supported by arching phrases in the cellos, repeating Elsa's reconciliation music at the end of her great scene with Ortrud in Act II . Nagano goes nowhere in this scene (I don't think the word ""rubato"" exists in his vocabulary), and as elsewhere, sounds as if his job were to keep things tidy and mark time.

I like lyrical voices in Lohengrin.  Sandor Konya defined the role for me and so far remains unmatched, but I also saw good performances from Siegfried Jerusalem and (early)Rene Kollo (Domingo, to my taste, sounds too bright and Latin for this music, fine artist though he is). All of these tenors were lyrics (though both Jerusalem and Kollo went on to sing heavier parts) and approached Lohengrin lyrically, that is, with the line and phrasing they would have given, say, Nemorino's music. Though lyrics, they had vocal heft, restrained but selectively projected in Lohengrin, and  which also enabled all of them to sing Walther von Stolzing as well as Parsifal (I also heard Konya once sing a beautiful Edgardo in Lucia, as well as much Verdi and Puccini). The problem with Mr. Vogt is that there is minuscule body to his sound, notwithstanding his fine musicianship and tasteful portrayal.  The same has to be said of Miss Kringelborn, though she is not as interesting a singer.  It's not that the voice is lyric (I always found Birgit Nilsson's Elsa an aberration) but that it is light. The greatest Elsa I ever saw was Elizabeth Grummer, also a great Eva and a Donna Anna (alas, I never saw Gundula Janowitz in the part though she's fabulous in the otherwise mixed-bag Kubelik recording, and the great Maria Muller was much before my time, though I've heard her complete Elsa as well as various excerpts).  All of these ladies were lyrics but could project and muster heft. In short, what we have in this performance are a Don Ottavio and Zerlina who somehow walked into the wrong opera.  Nagano allows them to be heard, but this may contribute to the overall paleness of his performance. Everybody else is probably as good as it gets today.  It is always a pleasure to watch Waltraud Meier though the voice does not seem as rich here as I've heard it in the past. Who are the great Ortruds in my book? First and foremost Margarete Klose in that embarrassingly magnificent (given provenance)live performance from Berlin, 1942 (available on Preiser Records); it's a lesson in projecting text and drama by one of the great contralto instruments of the 20th century through voice color and musicianship. The voice leaps at you and you see the face. Not that far behind are Kirsten Thorborg and, closer to us, Christa Ludwig.  Meier is a most effective singer, arguably the best today in this repertoire, if not in the same vocal league as the aforementioned ladies.

So, where do I come out? There's no violence done to Lohengrin here, but by no stretch of the imagination is this performance a must, unless you really like Lohengrin (like I do) and find something to like in nearly any performance of it. By the way, the chorus is great.

A technical observation:  I find that the dts sound is not well mixed, with the voices fading in and out a bit depending where they stand on stage; the orchestra prevails always.  I recommend using the stereo option.",1184457600,25,5188,4.913043478260869
8148495,5,B000J0ZPNS,"If you expect the fairy tell opera, this is not. The production focus is on the psychological drama, and as such it is a great production. Even the swan is gone from the set.
Lohengrin as a pianist in the 3rd act is a clever way to portray Lohengrin as Wagner himself demanding unconditional love and absolute trust since he (Wagner) comes from a superior place, thus shouldn't be questioned.
The music is impressive and delightful. The sound and the images very well delivered.",1182556800,2,478,4.7023809523809526
8148496,4,B000J0ZPNS,"After owing the set for a while, I finally sat down to watch it, and it did not disappoint me. I was not very much attracted to it since I am not fond of Lehnhoff's productions: his Ring Cycle from Munich was largely idiotic, and his Parsifal of Baden-Baden (and also Chicago and Barcelona)where, by trying to remove any traces of religious myths, he ended up removing any purpose of action in the entire opera. This Lehengrin, however, was an altogether enjoying experience. Lehnhoff tried to concentrate on the essential elements of the opera like patriotism, trust, honor, loyalty, revenge, and removed the non-essential ones like religion, pageantry, magic, and in this case he was successful ((I think that he also thought that love was a non-essential element, and tried to eliminate it altogether in the third act). The simplicity of the staging is marvelous, and it helped in making all the singers act believably.

The singing is of high quality: In the title part Klaus Forian Vogt does not have the typical timbre that one expects from a Wagnerian tenor. His voice is the one that one would expect to find in Lucia di Lammermoor, or Traviata, but he uses it with so much intelligence, musicality, and care, and detail in his phrasing that one forgets the ""wrong"" sound (but whoever has listened to the live recording of this opera with Nicolai Gedda as Lohengrin, will have to accept that if the tenor has stamina and still has a good healthy voice at the end of the opera, then it is alright to be a lyric tenor and sing this part).

The consensus is that Solveig Kringelborn was not good as Elsa. I think I haven to disagree with that consensus: there may not be cream in her voice like with Grmmer, but the tone is pleasant and the intonation is accurate. She also acts convincingly the part (and in the third act bedroom scene she is superb). What have been said about Waltraud Meier is also my opinion. She is probably the best Ortrud of the last 50 years. She even manages to sound more menacing than Christa Ludwig and that is saying a lot. The bass and the two baritones complete a strong cast.

Kent Nagano selects slow and broad tempi creating a majestic reading that at times sounds ponderous, especially with the choral scenes. Could this be the reason why he makes that atrocious cut in the second act when he eliminates completely ""In Frh'n versammelt uns der Ruf"", and abbreviates other choral moments?. Presenting the opera on 3 dvd's (more than any other available version) and with more cuts than the other available versions does not make any sense.

In spite of all that, this is the Lohengrin that every one must have: The staging works very well, the acting is credible, the singing is first rate, and Nagano with his slow tempi maintains the tension of this amazingly beautiful score at the right level.",1176681600,26,2837,4.668
8148497,4,B000J0ZPNS,"Because of the very favorable comment elicited by Vogt's appearance at the Met last season, and Nagano's fine conducting during his tenure at the Los Angeles Opera I had only one reservation initially in purchasing this performance:  Solveig Kringelborn.  Her broadcast as Rosalinde in Fledermaus was a complete disaster.  Whether she was indisposed or not, it shamed the Met.  The role is difficult and other diva's have also come to grief, e.g., Carol Vaness who was contemptuous of the role.  I was also irritated that Opus Arte was taking three discs for this performance; two would have sufficed even with the lengthy documentary that accompanies the performance.  I did want a Lohengrin in my collection of DVD's and I had ruled out the Met's because of casting in the roles of Ortrud and Elsa.  The Viennese performance boasted a wonderful Elsa in Studer, a well-sung knight from Domingo, but a weak Ortrud.  Additionally I think it takes a German or central European tenor to capture the spiritual qualities inherent in the role.  To me, this aspect of the role completed eluded Domingo even though he sang beautifully.

The set under consideration met the requirements as far as the the Lohengrin is concerned.  Vogt is an interesting artist,singing with great nuance and skill.  There could be no doubt that he was a knight of the Grail.  Kringelborn is an erratic artist, vocally.  There were many times when she had the requisite shimmer and color for an ideal Elsa; however, whenever she pressed the instrument her voice could be come shrill and unattractive.  Hence in any ensemble number she could not bring about qualities that the role demands.  It must be said though that she sang her two arias beautifully and and since they are essentially reflective she never came to grief.

Meir's Ortrud is every bit as exciting as one would expect from this wonderful artist.  She is incapable of being uninteresting or dull.  Tom Fox, her Telramund was very good as was the King Henry.

The production is by Lehnhoff.  I have no objection to the updating and stage concept.  That there was no swan doesn't trouble me.  What I did find strange was the first scene of the third act, the Bridal Chamber Scene.  There is a piano and Lohengrin is seated at it appearing to be composing!  Until I saw the documentary I wondered what was going on, but Lehnhoff in the documentary wants Lohengrin to make a statement about the role of the artist/composer in society.  I have no idea why he feels that this is an appropriate place to attempt to make the point; he is very pedantic in his delivery, very similar to his comments on his Parsifal which also emmanated from Baden Baden.  As idiotic as this scene comes off it is not a deal breaker and along with Nagano's wonderful conducting, the superb orchestra and chorus, and other reasons listed above I am happy to watch and listen to this Lohengrin.",1175126400,11,2903,4.77710843373494
