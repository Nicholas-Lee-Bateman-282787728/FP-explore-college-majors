7938394,1,B00005IC0J,"Horrible movie. This thing was shot on a budget and it shows. The Tai Seng/Ocean Shores versions are cut(not that you lose much substance). The plot was convoluted and trite. There was no logical sense in how Ti Lung went from being a can to an awesome fighter..I mean he had like one training session with the drunk guy, to getting poisoned, to being the beggar/kid clan master. The princess chick wasn't even better and could only attribute her skillset from dodgy frame cuts. When Ti Lung and the Princess ""flew"" down to the X-Games battle royale, I about cringed to death.",1433721600,,576,4.6568627450980395
