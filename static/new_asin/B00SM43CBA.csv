8698878,2,B00SM43CBA,"Bombastic throughout. These are not great performances. For Karajan acolytes only.

His bombast works ok in the scherzo of the 9th. On the other hand, the 3rd movement is retched, whatever feeling seeps through is despite Karajan. Toscanini is where to start with video, and this is no competition.

In the 5th it's kind of like Leni Riefenstahl's Nuremburg rally movies , with Karajan (who was a Nazi) as the fuhrer. Great black and white filming. I wish all classical video was this thoughtfully filmed. But the concert is dubbed, bombastic. If you want historic black and white, again start with Toscanini, and frankly you don't need this bombastic drivel.

Disappointed. For some reason I expected better and bought this disk but regret it. I still like his Debussy and Ravel, but increasingly I'm thinking that's my bad, On the whole I think he's by far the most overrated conductor. Just a swellled ambitious head in the right place at the right time.",1503187200,,957,4.858895705521473

I hope that more will be available in this series. There was a hint in the ""bonus"" section that there were 19(!) such recordings.
Can't wait!",1444262400,2,195,4.157894736842105
8698880,5,B00SM43CBA,"This blu-ray disc contains three major items of interest to collectors and potential purchasers. They are the studio performance of the 5th symphony recorded in 1966 by Henri-Georges Clouzot in black and white, a masterclass given by Karajan to an aspiring young conductor focussing on a thematic section of the 5th symphony second movement with the lower strings made at the same time and finally, the live 9th symphony recorded by Humphrey Burton in colour as part of the New Years Eve concert in 1977.  (This review was written after considering the Blu-ray option and using the earlier UK release of the multi-region disc).

None of these items bears any relation to the series of concert recordings overseen by Karajan and later distributed by Sony where both the layout of the orchestra and use of the cameras have been the subject of much controversy.

Before discussing the three presented films it must be stated that the audio and visual content of the program is far superior to what one may expect from such archive material. Clearly much restoration care has been lavished upon the project and collectors need have no concerns about an inferior product in those regards. In particular the 9th Symphony, as a recording, does full justice to the known merits of this renowned performance.

The masterclass, best heard before the performance of the 5th symphony to fully appreciate the preparation that underpins such a performance, concentrates exclusively upon a short thematic section of the slow movement. The detail that Karajan goes into as regards, initially the technical delivery of the notes and then how that utter security and understanding becomes the basis for interpretive modification, is extraordinary and far too detailed to be described here. It is sufficient to comment that it proves to be a riveting experience for the viewer. Whether one is an admirer or not of Karajan in general terms, it becomes abundantly apparent that he had an all-encompassing grip of the music and how he conceived its progress to performance.

The 5th symphony is a fine, even a compelling reading, but as like to nothing in terms of what is then achieved in the live performance of the 9th symphony.  That has long been recognised as a landmark performance in terms of recorded occasions. That something special was expected becomes clear even during the longish wait for Karajans entrance at the start. Barely a murmur breaks the hush that had descended upon a packed audience as well as orchestra and choir. Later, barely a moment passes before cries of ecstatic enthusiasm greet the final chord of the final movement.

Karajan himself seems oblivious of all of this as he swiftly enters, acknowledges the performers and immediately sets things in motion. Although the orchestra is far too large for period practice with doubling of parts everywhere, this is still a fleet performance where orchestral discipline maintains an incisive delivery that defies the size of forces being used. The first two movements are unquestionably dramatic with searing climaxes within a wide dynamic range. The slow movement is deeply expressive without any trace of superfluous emotionalism and the final is simply an expression of joy. It is this element of joy that marks this finale out from others. Once more it is achieved at a fleet pace with a heightened dynamic range and, incidentally, one where all the soloists and choir sing by memory. This was later the approach employed by Ozawa, a Karajan protg.

The 9th symphony is a very special occasion and this restoration will be every collectors dream. The 5th is good too and the masterclass is mastery in its comprehensive grasp. This disc should be on the wish list of every Karajan fan and anyone else interested in the art of conducting. Karajans support fluctuates as time passes but there is true greatness within this disc which will have a timeless value.

A fine 5th, an engrossing masterclass and a peerless 9th and all excellently restored",1427760000,16,4004,5.018072289156627
