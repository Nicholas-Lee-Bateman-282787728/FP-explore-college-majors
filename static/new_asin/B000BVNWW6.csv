8093230,2,B000BVNWW6,"I picked up this movie because the plot sounded interesting and because I saw it compared to David Lynch. I'm a big fan of Lynch and similar film makers, so I'm always on the hunt for anything in the vein of Lynch or Alejandro Jodorowsky. Unfortunately, people have the habit of saying that anything sufficiently strange is like David Lynch.

The difference between top-notch surrealist/absurdist/just plain weird directors and the rest is that the good ones are capable film makers. Does ""Machines of Love and Hate"" have a lot of weird stuff in it? Absolutely, and some of it is effective. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is completely inept. The audio, the music, the visuals, the acting (with a few exceptions), the writing and the direction were all very poor. The movie just looks and sounds bad. When you're trying to evoke a response primarily through strange imagery and odd people your movie need to have an interesting look. No one would call Eraserhead a beautiful looking movie (at least not in the way that something like ""Picnic At Hanging Rock"" is a beautiful looking movie), but the way it looks is perfect for what Lynch was doing. He also knows how to use a camera for more than just showing the viewer what's on set. This movie looks and sounds like very ambitious high school kids made it. There's stupid editing tricks and the same scene is repeated three times, which could have been effective if the movie had actually built up the nightmarish dread it thinks it has.

And the plot...it's intriguing at the start, but the doesn't last long. Which is unfortunate because there were some interesting things in there. But there's also a lot of really, really dumb things. A big problem came towards the end when the villain gives a monologue explaining almost the entire plot. What makes movies like ""Mulholland Dr"" so great is that you can watch it, not understand anything and still enjoy it OR you can put the pieces together and come up with your own theory. There's no part in ""Lost Highway"" or ""Mulholland Dr"" where a character goes, ""All right, dumb dumbs, here's what's going on."" Even something like ""Videodrome"" where characters do kind of explain what's going on, you don't necessarily believe them or fully understand it. The real problem with ""Machines of Love and Hate"" is that the writer/director didn't have the skill to craft a story that could stand up whether it was explained or not.

If you're a Lynch fan and you're trying to find your next hit of well crafted surrealism, I'd look elsewhere.",1344643200,,2539,4.752834467120182
8093231,4,B000BVNWW6,"Came across this gem of a movie the other day.  As a fan of off the wall independant horror movies, I wanted to give this a try.  It is sure not to disappoint.  While a bit odd on one hand, very stylish on the other.  Starring the Scream Queen Tina Krause, this is a virtual house of sexual horrors.  Be sure to watch with an open mind, and enjoy off kilter sexual horror filled joy ride!  I was highly entertained by this movie and the sort of story it tells!  Watch with the one you love, you will be glad you did!",1152144000,2,516,4.0
8093232,4,B000BVNWW6,"And now for something COMPLETELY different... This film is a strange and fascinating brew indeed.  Very David Lynch in its flavor with a truly original style.  Eileen Daly (the sexy star of RAZOR BLADE SMILE) and Tina Krause (the sexy star of countless softcore horror films like WITCHHOUSE 3 and TITANIC 2000) star in this weird story of a drifter named Jean-Charles who ""accidentally"" finds himself in a rural house with a truly bizarre husband/wife team and their sexually repressed daughter.  To explain this story in one paragraph would not do it justice.  It must seen and heard (fantatic music by Function Zero) to be believed. Joseph Parda (who did the giallo salute, 5 DEAD ON THE CRIMSON CANVAS) directed this and all I can say it's a slice of madness that's truly unique.  Loaded with nudity, STRANGE sex scenes, some gore and BEAUTIFUL cinematography.  Includes a nice photo gallery AND the bonus of a super-sexy short, SZAMOTA'S MISTRESS (also starring a very naked Tina Krause) directed by Parda.  Check it out!",1131148800,5,1025,4.924418604651163
