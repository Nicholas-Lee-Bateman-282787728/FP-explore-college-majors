4570912,5,B0054SNNWK,"Very informative! I didn't care for the UFO dvd but the rest were very interesting to watch.
The dvd on marijuana was intriguing because, as we know, that everything on this earth was created for a reason. Man is just using it the wrong way
The cancer dvd was also informative. The medical profession, for the most part, is bought and paid for by the big boys and big pharma. They seek to treat and not cure because of their monetary greed. Shame on them!!!
Those were our favorites!",1384819200,3,483,4.438202247191011

4570931,5,B0054SNNWK,"This is one of the best known for the history of marijuana.  I watch it online for free, only I wanted it so I could watch it on my television set.  I hope that anyone reading this listens to what I say about this movie.  This is so true on how it went down for marijuana prohibition.  To know the truth is to be informed.  After watching this movie, you will know the history of the corruption.  It is a plant that has been denied us for decades.  It is a gift from God, and I may add he doesn't make mistakes.  Or at least my heavenly father doesn't, he does not sleep at night.  He is ready to listen to all your worries.  Enough bout that, I got carried away, lolol.  I hope who goes into watching the history of marijuana in a negative way, after watching it will know the TRUTH !!!  By the way I am 60 years of age I have smoked it in the past and I smoke it now when its available.  I have 30 years experience I suffer with TBI, and its the only medication that works best for me.  And 30 years education about the truths of marijuana/cannabis/hemp.  I don't want to take those man made drugs, they kill you!  Marijuana's potential has always been the motive of corrupt people in government/black market.  Let it be freed and it would make a better difference in the world.  Really anybody with sense can tell you Alcohol is as dangerous as they come, enough said.  Enjoy the truth of this movie.",1413763200,,1403,4.187265917602996
4570932,4,B0054SNNWK,good CD's some information related to cancer are  not update but overall it is very educational,1412380800,,95,4.9375
4570933,5,B0054SNNWK,Wow!  Very though provoking - would recommend to anyone.  Outstanding!!,1406851200,2,71,6.0
4570934,5,B0054SNNWK,"The Cancer video especially, for me, was eye-opening, about how the medical/pharma establishment has shut down simple and inexpensive cures to cancer. My dad's a retired doctor and would be sympathetic to this fascinating historical documentary.
The True History of Marijuana went beyond what I thought I already knew; again, the pharmaceutical industry is the villain.
UFOs and the military elite: again, I've seen several documentaries and this is as good as any of them.
The Second Dallas - Who Killed RFK?: also a great summary; and finally The New American Century regarding who was really behind 9/11 (means motive and opportunity) is required viewing for anyone. All documentaries use excellent historical footage, and build their case skillfully.",1401321600,6,754,5.398305084745763
4570935,5,B0054SNNWK,"Not intentionally, though.  I pre-judged that ""The True History of Marijuana"" would hold the least interest for me and would have the narrowest frame of reference.  Wow was I wrong!  Because this one video ties together just about everything presented in the other four.  It shows the absolute, irredeemable evil of our capitalist system, by presenting a truly monstrous collusion of a few captains of industry and finance.  As one might suspect, it was not the alleged hallucinogenic properties of the Cannabis plant's leaves and flowers that was the target of this collusion but the industrial properties of its stalk.  Randolph Hearst feared its use as a source of paper - he wanted trees instead.  John D Rockefeller feared it use as a source of energy - he owned oil.  Lamont DuPont feared its use as a source of consumer goods - he wanted petrochemicals.  And they all found their champion in Andrew Mellon, the banker who became FDR's Secretary of the Treasury.  Worse still, this cabal of American industrialists managed to impose their prohibition against Cannabis upon literally the entire world.  What they also imposed on the world was a legacy of pollution that continues almost unabated.  The great irony is that it's those who wish to get high who have put the greatest - and only - chink is this monster of prohibition and destruction created for no other reason on earth than the profit of a few capitalists..

""The True History of Marijuana"" segues perfectly with ""Cancer: The Forbidden Cures"" in that scientists have demonstrated again and again the anti-cancer properties of Cannabis - along with a whole list of other medicinal uses. What ""The True History of Marijuana"" doesn't do, unfortunately, is elevate ""Cancer: The Forbidden Cures"" to the level of an impartial documentary based on solid scientific research.  Each of the Cures presented relies more on anecdotal than laboratory evidence.  So while this particular documentary is informative, it's far from an open and shut case against Big Pharma and its clearly toxic treatment protocols.

""The New American Century"" is superb background for Massimo Mazzucco's most ambitious documentary, ""September 11: The New Pearl Harbor.""  It presents the rise of the Neocons - and demonstrates what happens to a nation when a group of persons with a truly skewed view of the world attain almost absolute power.  It isn't pretty.

""The Second Dallas,"" which a number of reviewers have noted as primarily a repackaging of previously presented evidence, was actually revealing for me in that I've never followed Robert F Kennedy's assassination very closely.  It definitely does not present the LAPD in a very flattering light, to put it mildly.

""UFO's and the Military Elite,"" as one would expect, leaves a great deal unanswered - even though it presents a wealth of evidence for a monumental cover-up by the military.  Primarily, as one might also expect, by the American military and its associated intelligence agencies.  Obviously, nobody outside the hyper-secretive military-industrial complex can say for sure if these UFO's represent man-made devices or extraterrestrial visitations.

This great documentary, as every other reviewer has already pointed out, is simply not to be overlooked.  It's far too important.",1399593600,10,3289,5.1720226843100185
4570936,5,B0054SNNWK,"everyone needs to see/hear this package if you don't want to be a ""sheeple"" anymore.
make copies. it is totally permitted to do so.",1398470400,2,131,4.5
4570937,5,B0054SNNWK,"The True History of Marijuana - A revealing history of the phony ""war on drugs,"" the effects of propaganda in a free society, and the efforts by powerful people to wipe out a crop that has many practical uses (and provides too much competition to the fossil fuel industry).

The New American Century - A hard look at the neo-conservatives and others behind the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, their lies, war crimes and rampant corruption.

Cancer: The Forbidden Cures - A history of alternative and natural treatments for cancer, and the efforts by the AMA and the drug industry to suppress such knowledge. There's obviously little money to be made if people can heal themselves naturally.

UFOs and the Military Elite - A convincing survey of the US military's role in the UFO coverup, in ironic contrast to more open attitudes of military elites in other countries (especially Latin America). I had never seen the footage of ex-Governor Fife Symington admitting that the Phoenix Lights were real and he did believe in the reality of UFOs.

The Second Dallas - Who Killed RFK? - Nothing really new here, but a good summing up of the case using footage from Ted Charach's old documentary, THE SECOND GUN, as well as more recent interviews and research.",1397260800,24,1251,4.804651162790698
4570938,5,B0054SNNWK,"I purchased this DVD set because of the one DVD: ""Cancer, the Forbidden Cures""; I have seen it on You Tube first and was so impressed, that I decided to buy it for myself. I have seen it already 3x and the message is so powerful, that I believe every human being, who cares about his/her health should seen this movie.
""The Holy Trinity"" - radiation, surgery and chemotherapy ARE NOT an option in my lifetime, if I am ever diagnosed with big C. First, I am doing everything humanly possible to prevent it, but I would never agree to cut (surgery), poison (chemotherapy) or burn (radiation); btw, the last two are carcinogenic!!??

8457065,3,B0054SNNWK,"Of course it is one That This Great Collection of Must See Conspiracy Facts is so well bundled..but...The Obvious Fact that these are poorly copied and very poor video quality irks me. As the message being delivered can hardly be properly digested, if you one can hardly focus on the blurry picture what is being portrayed. But I supposed the fact PBS during NPR Pledge Drive was giving this Very Collection away for a Nominal $500 Donation, seems that they would be of higher quality...OR Amazon, once again is selling Pirated DVDS..?  Very informative though...and is a Good Bundle, not bashing the content, but the Quality of the Video. Possibly the Single DVD's might be of higher quality.",1484179200,2,693,4.872881355932203
