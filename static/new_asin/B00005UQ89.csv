7955374,4,B00005UQ89,"ROGER RAMJET-MAN OF ADVENTURE: Bringing a whole new meaning to the term ""limited animation"", Roger Ramjet made Bullwinkle look like Disney by comparison. Static movement only enhanced its humor, aided by rapid fire gags, groan-worthy puns, and oversized sound effects. The ""Daredevil, Flying Fool and All-Around Good Guy"" was portrayed to lantern-jawed perfection by Laugh-In announcer Gary Owens (also known as sci-fi super hero Space Ghost), with Get Smart regular Dave Ketchum providing droll commentary. The bumbling Ramjet squared off against colorfully named baddies like Noodles Romanoff and His Band of No-Goods, The Solenoid Robots, and Red Dog the Pirate, aided by his far more competent kids Yank, Doodle, Dan, and Dee. Burt Lancaster-ish rival Lance Crossfire, curvy gal pal Lotta Love, and no nonsense General Brassbottom rounded at the kooky cast. Each episode ran only three and a half minutes (not counting the 90 second insanely catchy theme song), but Roger Ramjet provided more genuine yuks than most toons twice as long.

7955376,2,B00005UQ89,"The lead-in song is exactly the same as the exit song for each episode are equal or greater in length than the actual episode itself and after the third or fourth cartoon in a row, becomes very annoying. The sarcastic, hackmied animation is still there along with precocious political satire and social commentary. If there was a way to edit out each identical header and footer, the middle content would be much more pleasurable.",1404432000,,430,4.824324324324325
7955377,5,B00005UQ89,"Excellent packaging and episodes.  Roger Ramjet - famous in Ireland AND in the USA !  If you get tired of hearing the theme song over and over, there is an option in the menu which enables you to skip it.  There's also an invention on your DVD player called fast-fowarding..... !",1335830400,4,279,4.431372549019608
7955378,3,B00005UQ89,"This video brought back many fond memories of the cartoon series that would delay my homework from school in the 60's.  Like the DVD, Roger Ramjet--Hero of Our Nation, this DVD continues to bring us more cartoons of the Cold War Era.  It is faithful in its production...don't expect Hi-Fi sound for it was never there.  There is very little movement in the cartoon, but the way it is done makes it very entertaining and brings much fun.
If only the producers of the disk had not given us the opening and closing theme of each and every cartoon, the disk would be viewable in its entirety.  Instead, no matter how much of a Roger Ramjet fan you are, you will find it painstaking to hear the song over and over again.  That is the only reason for the rating of 3.",1056326400,9,761,4.330985915492958
