8763572,5,B01GUOXXXU,"I have just started enjoying this show, and have decided to give it 5 stars. it hits so many levels of great entertainment. Delivery Man is written well, it's actually funny, even though it is fairly serious at times, not overly sexual; which is a nice change, and current to today's ever-changing culture. Not necessarily pop culture, but more of an honest look at today's cultural climate. The writers tapped into an interesting concept of an officer turned Midwife. This is so current with many men and women returning home from the military. People coming home are still wanting to do humanitarian work, as let's say Registered Nurses's, Paramedics, or perhaps any profession that lends itself to helping others. This show is a very fun spin on this concept; an officer who changes his profession - that still may take some investigative work, however hopefully not at the same level of criminal level. I am hoping for a season 2!",1506297600,,934,4.84375
