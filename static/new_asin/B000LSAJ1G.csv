8388418,2,B000LSAJ1G,I am a huge MMA Fan and I usually enjoy the cheap older MMA DVD's. This is usually the only way to see today's superstars before they became known. The fights on the DVD are horrible. The only semi-large name fighter on the card is Marvin Eastman and his fight looked very amateurish. My advices is to skip this DVD.,1279411200,,316,4.283333333333333
