4734932,2,B005LAIHZE,"Before I state anything, you must understand that I was not expecting much from this movie. I'm fully aware that movies of this nature are not meant to be taken seriously and as such, I went into this film purely for the entertainment value. It's just unfortunate that this movie was just middle of the road mediocre.

There's some good to this film, mostly in the form of the underused secondary characters and the underdeveloped world of the vampires. I couldn't help but love some of the familiar faces I saw in this, such as Alan Tudyk (Alpha from Dollhouse), and I really wanted to see more of them. I also liked the character of Speed, who was woefully underused. Rufus Sewell does his best to appear somewhat menacing, and is generally the most interesting of the more main characters. I admit, at times I was rooting for him just because he actually had more of a personality than Lincoln did. (And Dominic Cooper well... he made for some awesome eye candy.)

The bad is that this film is overly long. It's barely two hours long, but felt like three. There's just long periods of time where the plot just sags and is bogged down by its own weight. The cinematography was nice enough and the 3D was well shot, but if you're looking to see this in 3D, save your money. It's not worth the extra dollars. Other than the occasional fight or special effects-laden scene, most of the film really didn't require 3D and made it more of a gimmick than an asset. I don't mind 3D gimmicks, but considering how expensive 3D can be it's not really worth it.

I can't say that this is the worst film ever made. It has parts that redeem it and if it was bad then that would have actually made it that much more entertaining. I think that the filmmakers intended this to have an Ed Wood meets Rocky Horror meets schlockly vampire cinema feel to it, but this just comes across as solidly bland fare. It's not something that I'd tell people never to see, but it is something I'd recommend waiting for the DVD to hit shelves before seeing.

Seriously, wait for the DVD and the inevitable RiffTrax soundtrack to synch up with it. I'm pretty sure that this the DVD/Blu-Ray will have some nice features on it and a RedBox rental would be far cheaper. (Hint to the movie people: pay the RiffTrax people to create an audio track for your DVD and release it as an official feature on the DVD. Now that I'd pay additional money to see/hear.)",1340496000,2,2422,4.460496613995486
4734933,5,B005LAIHZE,"The viewer gets a history and biography of the life of Abraham Lincoln, a compelling story of the battle between Vampires and humans, stunning scenery, and much more. The cast of unforgettable characters are Superb, and acting performance is excellent. A Brilliant, powerfully moving adaptation of the novel aimed to please in every aspect. High-speed action, combined with chills and thrills make this movie very entertaining from start to finish. Highly recommended to vampire lovers, thriller lovers, and all who enjoy a combination of both in a creative, action-packed presentation. Absolutely Stunning!",1340496000,3,607,5.608695652173913
4734934,4,B005LAIHZE,"""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" boldly reimagines the Civil War President as an action hero.  The movie cleverly intermingles Lincoln's real life as rail-splitter, storekeeper, lawyer, politician, and president with a secret life as a hunter of the vampires who murdered his mother.

The story opens with a plot-setting scene in which the young Abraham interferes with a particularly villanous slave trader.  The murder of his mother leads Abraham to seek revenge, only to discover the slave trader is much more of a monster than he had imagined.  Lincoln survives the encounter and is taken under the wing of a mysterious stranger, who trains him in the art of killing vampires.

Lincoln's hatred of vampires follows him deep into the Civil War.  The crisis of the Battle of Gettysburg prompts the President and a small circle of friends to mount a special operation to win the battle and defeat the vampires, who, naturally, are Confederate slaveholders...

""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" features some gorgeous special effects, which in turn enable some mind-blowing martial arts action, along with a truly spectacular concluding dramatic sequence aboard a train.  The movie plays its exotic premise straight up, while actor Benjamin Walker is quite good as Lincoln; recommended as good entertainment, especially in the 3D version.",1340496000,,1339,5.3428571428571425
4734935,3,B005LAIHZE,"I haven't read the book yet, but I have been told that the movie departs significantly from it's source. Worth noting for people who are bothered by that sort of thing.

The core conceit of this move is patently absurd. One either accepts that going in or just doesn't go to see it. If I was to aim a single criticism at the movie though it would be that it doesn't fully embrace that absurdity.

Sometimes it does. There are some epic moments involving silver forks being shot from a canon and young Lincoln leaping from horseback to horseback. But then it goes and gets serious and wants to talk slavery.

Still there is a lot of fun to be had. Who doesn't want to see Abraham Lincoln decapitating and maiming the undead in as many different ways as the director can conceive?

My second criticism is that the director gets a little too full of his artistic prowess and it's distracting. Animation is thrust into the middle of the film when it's utterly unnecessary, we get endless slow-mo segments and some scenes (particularly the horse stampede scene) where it's really hard to tell what is going on. This is not, after all, an art movie.

Criticisms aside there is a lot of fun here too. Endless, gory, vampire killing and a deft weaving of these elements in between some historical fact. If you can suspend your disbelief suitably then watching a 50 something year old Lincoln fight vampires on the roof of a fast moving train is pretty entertaining.

So it's a fun movie, but you'd probably be fine picking it up on DVD or Blu-Ray. It could have been better if it hadn't had pretensions to be more than it is.",1340496000,,1617,4.501706484641638
4734936,4,B005LAIHZE,"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter tells Abraham Lincoln's story from his childhood to presidency with a vampire-hunting twist. I am not familiar with the source material, other than knowing this film is based on a book, so I won't and can't compare them. Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is an ultra-stylish, action-packed adventure.

The story is unique and innovative, packed with thrilling, edge-of-your-seat action sequences and a great yet bizarre ""what-if"" twist on history. (If you're not a fan of bizarre creativity, then this film is probably not for you.) There are a lot of slow-motion action which I thought was choreographed perfectly; I personally loved the final action sequence on top of the train where Abe and his childhood friend, William, fight an onslaught of vampires while sharing an axe. Also, this film has a couple of great jump-scares that I didn't expect, since I thought it was a pure action film. I enjoyed Benjamin Walker as young Abe Lincoln, but not so much as the older President Abraham Lincoln due to make-up/effects; the rest of the acting was great. This film oozes style, from the dark, beautifully shot scenery to the breathtaking, blood-splattering slow-motion action pieces; this is one of the film's that you should own on Blu-ray as the picture quality is amazing. Also, the music effectively complimented the film.

Overall, I really enjoyed Abraham Lincoln; it's an amazing action film that effectively uses its fantasy concept and settings to its advantage. I recommend purchasing for fans of the action/fantasy genre, and a rental for those still on the edge.

Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter has strong violence and blood, some brief sex and nudity.",1340409600,,1695,5.156363636363636
4734937,4,B005LAIHZE,"Timur Bekmambetov, a screenwriter, producer, and director, was born in Kazakhstan and is perhaps known best for the Russian action films ""Nightwatch"" and ""Daywatch"" and the bullet-bending spectacular ""Wanted."" Bekmambetov is notorious for taking what is usually a really farfetched concept and making it way more enjoyable than it probably should be. So it was no surprise when it was announced he'd be the one tackling ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" because the absurdity of that story is directly in the title. But what makes even less sense is how good ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" turned out to actually be.

Being unfamiliar with Benjamin Walker made any sort of expectations for his performance tilt like a faulty pinball machine. However his supporting cast would prove to be extraordinary. With the likes of Mary Elizabeth Winstead (""Scott Pilgrim Vs the World,"" ""The Thing""), Dominic Cooper (""The Devil's Double,"" ""Captain America: The First Avenger""), Rufus Sewell (""Dark City,"" ""The Illusionist""), Marton Csokas (""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,"" ""xXx""), and a brief appearance by Alan Tudyk (""Serenity,"" ""3:10 to Yuma"") this movie was in extremely good hands when it came to actors. Within moments, Walker is able to pull you into his portrayal of Abraham Lincoln as well. It's mostly driven by his thirst for vengeance and him being torn between telling the truth to his soon to be wife Mary Todd (Winstead) and hiding it all from her in an attempt to keep her safe.

The movie thrives on unbelievable action sequences. Abe chops down a tree with a single blow early on. He then goes on to catch a blade in his mouth while hanging upside down and slits a vampires throat before bending himself in half and cutting the rope from his feet. There's always this sense of impossibility to nearly every big action sequence in the movie and yet it somehow makes it all a little more entertaining. One of the greatest sequences in the film is this montage of Abe fighting several vampires that heightens with him shoving the face of one into a fire pit and holding it there while Abe uses one of those old fashioned air pumps to make the fire grow. Then the movie switches gears suddenly and Abe is shown nodding off at a picnic with Mary Todd who's a tad upset he's fallen asleep in the first place.

Bekmambetov seems to muck up action sequences more often than not. What your brain is able to process is outstanding and is pretty much exactly what your inner action junkie so desperately craves. There were times during things like the horse stampede action sequence and several of the gory vampire slayings where legitimate goosebumps were present. But the rest of the time, you can't really tell just what in the world is going on. The camera zooms in way too frequently, things are flying in the air, vampires are flying left and right, and the train sequence is a real mess if you're really keen on connecting all the dots when it comes to character's actions.

Other than not knowing what's going on when the action gets really hot and heavy, ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" is fairly outstanding overall. It's downright ridiculous at times and extremely outrageous through and through, but is unbelievably entertaining from beginning to end. Speaking of the ending, it's bound to ruffle a few feathers. Oddly more historically accurate than expected (except still not so much) and yet so gloriously outlandish, ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" is bloody marvelous.",1340323200,2,3508,4.920608108108108
4735177,5,B005LAIHZE,"I love vampire movies and this one especially so because it was creatively outside of the box. I love horror but usually they follow a strict formula. This one deviates deliciously. The movie cast was filled with lovable, driven characters fighting vampires during one of the blackest periods in American History. It was hard not to be enraptured from the beginning credits. Awesome job taking a theme and twisting it on its keister.",1526774400,,433,4.945205479452055
4735178,4,B005LAIHZE,"Completely ridiculous and tons of fun!  If the title doesn't prepare you for this action-horror borderline satire, then I'm sure the teaser will.  The ""real"" history bits help to ground you in the almost believable alternate US history.  Is it Apocalypse Now good? NO.  Is it better then Barbarella, or Zardoz? YES!  Once in a while a movie comes along that's too good to be a B movie, but not quite A list national theater release material.  This is one of those films, an instant cult classic.",1526688000,,495,4.632183908045977

4735319,4,B005LAIHZE,"This movie is an expected pleasure. The previews showed lots of Matrix-style combat scenes, so many that you might think it's nothing buy a preview to a video-game franchise. But surprise, the movie has an intelligent subtext about intolerance. It also has a very convincing lead with Benjamin Walker. Mary Elizabeth Wingate plays Mary Todd--and though she can be uneven from one movie to the next, she is just perfect in her role. Her scenes with Walker are the eye at the movie's vampire-zombie hurricane, all comedy of manners and romance right out of a Jane Austen novel.

The effects all look totally digital, and some are more satisfying than others. My favorite was the horse stampede--visually stunning, it also represented on a deeper level Lincoln's repressed rage toward the ugly old vampire that killed his mother. Least convincing was the hand-to-hand combat on top of a moving passenger car--though the fiery demolition of a tall wooden bridge with innumerable flames licking their way up the foundation and trellises was a mighty fine way to end the episode.

Note: I bought this DVD at Walmart for the super-low price of $3.74. My expectations were low. But if you watch with an open mind, and tolerate some of the digital fakery, you might enjoy this movie, if only for the rom-com scenes between Walker and Wingate.",1513814400,,1333,4.92

As it turns out the movie pretty much lives up to the hype. There is an actual plot with characters we can get behind.
Of course some scenes are over the top or just plain silly, but to slay vampires you probably need a good sense of humor. The action is cool and it comes at you fast.

4736369,5,B005LAIHZE,"An awfully fun little action-horror/fantasy. It's no Oscar-winner, and with the title, you don't expect it to be. It's goofy without being stupid, and knows not to take itself too seriously without losing its sense of self. It should be noted that if the sight of blood makes you ill, don't watch this, as it will make you quite ill indeed.

The basic idea is that the Southern confederates are actually vampires who own slaves so as to appease their appetite for human blood, and if you're okay with this interesting application of history, the rest of the film flows fine. After his mother and father died at the hands of a vampire, young Abe Lincoln heads off to seek vengeance, and, eventually, justice for the secret abuses of the undead. There are some interesting twists, gunfights, a few explosions, and plenty of wonderfully vicious melee combat. My dad describes Lincoln as ""an axe-wielding ninja"", which is a pretty fair description. It's the most creative and badass use of an axe I've seen in a long time.

To sum it up, ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" is surprisingly intelligent for a ""good bad"" action movie. If you liked the time-bending action of the Matrix and the plain old monster-smashing of the fantastically entertaining ""Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters"", you'll love this new and smashy version of one of the United States' most famous presidents.",1473292800,,1375,4.896995708154506

  what a fabulous take on the history of the usa.  this was the most intriguing description and action of historical facts from our past.  names, dates, timeline, conflicts, and outcomes... all casually thrown in to keep the viewer locked into the story.  great action and the main character looked like a younger version of liam neeson.  the main lincoln actor was very good.  doesn't the main evil guy ever age ?(even in real life)  great show, history, and characters.",1455062400,,478,4.8875

Nothing to rave about other than to eat popcorn and enjoy a fight with Lincoln killing Vamps. I do say this is too long and could have been a lot shorter then it was. Three negatives I have, is length, animation and how can you really take this serious. But with all that said it still was a fun silly time.

4737590,4,B005LAIHZE,"Hey, so I didn't like the book all that much...but I figured it would make a pretty good movie.  Full of action, great sets, good costumes, set against the backdrop of pre-Civil War and Civil War America, how serious can you take a movie with this title?  That being said, it was a fun romp and the action scenes really got me going and were a cross between the Matrix and martial arts movies.  I got a big kick out of seeing our somber Abraham Lincoln spinning a silver-tapped axe and doing flips and high-kicks to kill hordes of vampires.  I also enjoyed his romance with Mary Todd and his friendship with his mentor in the vampire-hunting trade, Henry.  (Loved the dark spectacles in the movie!)

History buffs need not apply, unless you can enjoy the movie for what it is and not try to compare it to the real thing.  Still, it gave me a shiver to see Pres Lincoln deliver part of the Gettysburg Address, even if it was set after a Battle of Gettysburg that included loads of vampires fighting on the side of South.",1446595200,,1019,4.388297872340425

4737592,5,B005LAIHZE,"Yes, OK, it's about vampire hunting and most history buffs (Civil War, Lincoln, etc.) scoff at that...and won't give this one a second look. BUT...they are missing one of the best 'authentic eye candy' films ever made! Most history geeks (and I'm one) bemoan Hollywood productions as never 'getting it right' when it comes to the 'period correct' aspects of a historical film. Well with but few details you'd almost have to be a museum professional to spot, this one has got it right. Some of the sets are unbelievably accurate, the costumes actually show pattern and cutting change as the years in the story advance--even within a single decade! (the wedding clothes are a notable exception!) and the props are superb!
Eye candy galore--a film one can watch over & over again and still spot some cool stuff.
Granted some of the CGI gets a little overdone--I got tired of the horse herd 'chase', but then this -is- an action movie. And some of the time condensation was a little much (all that silver melting & delivery in less than 24 hours?) but as for the visual stuff and the story interest it cannot be topped. Even the serious historian ought to be able to take a break for a little suspension of disbelief once in a while. It's a good fun flick with lots of antiquarian eye candy to keep even the most jaded material culturist happy. Plus it's a pretty nifty story that actually holds together quite well.",1446422400,,1412,4.629482071713148

4737929,3,B005LAIHZE,"Recently, I browsed Amazon just for the fun of it, looking for occult products somehow connected to U.S. presidents. A portrait of Rutherford B Hayes as a zombie, a cultic book promoting pedophilia supposedly translated by Thomas Jefferson, and a collection of Masonic addresses by George Washington were some of the stuff that appeared on my computer screen, hopefully without any occult powers being responsible. Shortly thereafter (a sheer co-incidence, surely!), Swedish television aired this motion picture, with the appealing and appalling title Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter.

I admit that I watched it only because of my not-too-serious interest in the occult presidency. I'm glad I did. Although hardly a masterpiece in the higher Academy Award division, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is much better than the title might lead you to expect. I mean, this *really is* a film about how Lincoln, who has a secret identity as a vampire slayer, runs around with a huge axe, showing the undead who's the Man on both sides of the Mason-Dixon line! It was panned by critics, but considering what it could have become in the hands of a less experienced director (read: a splatter turkey), I'd say Timur Bekmambetov did a pretty good job with a concept that's really quite impossible.

In the movie's universe, the South is home to a group of vampires who buy Black slaves with the purpose of killing them and feasting on their blood. Soon, the undead get uppity and penetrate the free states, earning a living as slave-catchers. A young Abe Lincoln takes up the struggle, aided by a mysterious personage who teaches him how to kill the racist blood-suckers. Later in life, Lincoln becomes a politician and tries to forget his colorful past. Unfortunately, the vampires show up again during the Civil War, aiding the Confederacy at Gettysburg with their supernatural powers. To win the war and save America from a fate far worse than Stephen Douglas, Lincoln must use all the tricks he learned as a young man in the vampire-busting business

The political and social metaphors are ber-obvious. In one scene, Jefferson Davis meets the vampire grand dragon Adam, in another Lincoln enlists the aid of the Underground Railway to combat the vampirist menace. It's interesting to note that many Africans originally assumed that White slave-catchers and slave-traders were cannibals! Since I happen to support the Union in the Civil War, I had no particular problem with the pro-Lincoln/pro-Black slant of this production.

I don't really like vampire-themed or zombie-themed films, so you can take it from me: Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is worth at least the OK rating (three stars). Its entertainment value is probably even higher",1433635200,,2733,5.121076233183857

But man is it entertaining!

That huge ax he uses is pretty awesome looking and the idea that vampires were always infiltrating American society and feeding on it's people while also staying hidden was really cool!  The visuals are great, and it has a feel to it that puts you in the mindset that you are in the 19th century with all the great costumes and the old fashion buildings and horses and carriages.

4738046,3,B005LAIHZE,"Timur Bekhmambetov (I know I butchered that spelling) is an experienced director of supernatural movies, starting with his acclaimed ""Night Watch"" series of Russian films.  They're worth watching.

He brings that supernatural sensibility to US film - featuring one of our most famous presidents, no less.  You know from the title what you're getting into.  However, the title also leads to certain expectations.  I expected something more gonzo, more comedic, and faster paced.  The movie doesn't really get started delivering the goods until about half an hour in.  A lot of the first 30 minutes of this film could have gone away; there's just too much exposition.  Further, it's oddly serious in many places for a film in which Abraham Lincoln has a secret life as a vampire hunter.  Nevertheless, once it gets rolling it's entertaining and holds your attention.

As a bonus, I learned a few things about US history that I never knew - for example, the relationship between Mary Todd and Stephen Douglas before she met Lincoln.  I thought it was probably just artistic license, but that made me look it up.  The More You Know!

And one doesn't need to look very far to know that the party Lincoln fought against has an aversion to the sun as they worry about global warming, now called climate change. They can't stand the sight of crosses and always fight to have them taken down. And most of all they feed off the blood of the unborn. Before I forget this is a pretty cool movie too.

4738048,4,B005LAIHZE,"""Abraham Lincoln the Vampire Hunter"" is fairly well done. I was not expecting this movie to be as entertaining as I found it to be.

 Story: Abe Lincoln's life is portrayed, both an account of historical life but also his hidden secret life where he is enlisted to fight the dark sinister forces of American vampirism.  The US Civil War is portrayed as the war it was, and also a hidden secret war with in the conflict between the forces of good against an Army of vampires.

 What surprised me the most, and caused me to bring up the big question as to why exactly was this movie rated R in the first place?  Aside from the horror violence, and images of blood lusting vampirism this movie is basically PG-13 material through and through.  If I were in charge of this production I would have made this a very rated R epic, with lots of demonic imagery, vampire fighting action, and naked themed sexuality placed in the film.

I enjoyed watching it to the extent that I paused the movie when my father was talking so I wouldn't miss anything.  I didn't realize that the movie was as recent as 2012 until after I finished the movie, and I thought that the CGI was good.

The scenes between Abraham and Mary are cute.  I was impressed to see actors such as Rufus Sewell and Dominic Cooper in it.  The plot is decent as is the character development.  You feel for the characters.  I would watch it again.",1427500800,,794,4.4206896551724135

4738236,1,B005LAIHZE,"l have few heroes, Abraham Lincoln is one of them.  I also love fantasy martial arts, parodies and irreverent outside-the-box takes on things (e.g.,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Trollhunter/dp/B005ILYWN2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Trollhunter</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zoolander/dp/B008PZZYB2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zoolander</a>- one making sly fun of government conspiracies and conspiracy nuts, the other MERCILESSLY lampooning the fashion industry), so I thought I'd LOVE this.  And Lincoln himself had a sense of the absurd, was famed for his sense of humor and tall tales, so... For the first half of the movie I was mostly just underwhelmed, and continually irritated by the deviation from the truth regarding Lincoln's private life (I mean, the real stuff, not the flights of fancy).  I've read Lincoln biographies and know his life well.  For one, the depiction of Mary Todd as a strong, wonderful, supportive woman and the love of Lincoln's life (untrue- he married her on the rebound and she was a loon, a thorn in his side) irritated me.  There were many such details that did.  So I'd say if you're a fan of Lincoln's and a reader of Lincoln biographies, you won't like this.

Secondly, (and I  should have foreseen this, perhaps) the alternate vampire fantasy storyline detracted BIG time for me from the wonders of what Lincoln was actually able to accomplish- most of all, rising from the meanest and most obscure of origins, far from the centers of political discourse, with NO formal education, to the most powerful position in the land (in almost superhuman terms that nearly defy belief), all with but ONE goal in mind, from his youth to his death: bringing an end to the abomination of slavery and freeing the black race.  (If you're interested in such things and want to read more about this American wonder, in the words of people who actually knew him, I highly recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Abraham-Lincoln-The-True-Story-of-a-Great-Life/dp/B00AVKSQK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Abraham Lincoln: The True Story of a Great Life</a>.)

Thirdly, the film is long on action, fantasy martial-arts, huge sections of it devoted to CGI action sequences and non-stop battles between mortals and vampires.  If you're a person who loves such things and could care less about the story line, you may revel in it.  I found it tedious (and I like such things, e.g.,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hansel-And-Gretel-Witch-Hunters/dp/B00C7DGRL4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hansel And Gretel: Witch Hunters</a>).  But my take on the film went from so-so to MUCH worse.

I came to the part [***SPOILER ALERT of the PLEASE READ Variety***] where scheming, EVIL Jefferson Davis makes a pact with the undead to fight on the side of the Confederacy.  Slaves can not only toil in the fields, the backbone of the South's economy, but serve as fodder for vampires' voracious lust and hunger, as food.  Hey, two birds killed with one stone!  Multiple battle scenes show hordes of monstrous, once-human Confederate troops decimating Union forces.  But Lincoln and the Union army are eventually able to slaughter them using silver bullets and bayonets thereby winning the war.  Hooray!

I'm not a fan of political correctness for its own sake; I was simply disgusted by this depiction of the Confederacy, whether ""creative"" and fanciful or not.  A full half of our country lost its sons to the Civil War.  They revere and honor their dead.  The South being mistaken in its subjugation of African-Americans doesn't justify dishonoring their memory, their loss and pain.  Nor is it cricket to trivialize what African-Americans endured and their centuries-long struggle for freedom by making them vampire food.  EVERYONE in the South (nay, in the nation) is demeaned by this film.  I have a healthy sense of humor, but it doesn't extend to dishonoring the dead and those who loved them.

This purely gratuitous film strains and breaks the bounds of human decency, IMO (all to make a slimy greenback, obviously).  What's next?  Andrew Jackson, Vampire Hunter (killing all those vampiric Indians from sea to shining sea, good riddance)?  Adolph Hitler, Vampire Hunter?  Showing evil already undead Jews being slaughtered?  Or how about Osama Bin Ladin Vampire Hunter?  He got THOUSANDS of them in one fell swoop!  Wouldn't THAT be hysterical!  The ethical issues and tragedies are THE SAME, just further removed in time.  And we WONDER what's wrong with this country.

The only positive things I can say about this film are that the acting was superb all round- Benjamin Walker gave a virtuoso performance as Lincoln (great makeup too), and the sets, costumes and cinematography were good.  Other than that, it's a DISGRACE, an abomination of the ""What COULD they have been thinking???"" variety.  I expect a whole lot better of Tim Burton.

Abe Lincoln being one of the only ones (along with some of the other Northerners) to recognize this as a huge problem and want to do something to stop it.  Some Northerners in the movie stated that Abe should just appease the vampires (slave owners) by giving them the south, because at least the bulk of the ""feeding"" was in the south and did not affect the north.  Abe Lincoln being the ONLY ONE to come up with the idea (and follow through with action) to melt down the silver to kill the vampires, i.e. Abe Lincoln had the ""silver bullet"" to eradicate slavery.

4738375,5,B005LAIHZE,"Well. Tim Burton makes a movie about Abe Lincoln taking on the daunting task of vampire slayer. The humorous possibilities are expected - and you're not going to be disappointed. From the start, the viewer is asked to suspend their preconceived notions or knowledge about historical events and vampire movies in order to consider the what if;  what if this is what happened to a man named Abe Lincoln who just happened to become one of our presidents. And what if the confederacy was run by vampires threatening to devour the entire country? (GASP)  Well, that was the premise of the movie.
In the meantime great acting and AWESOME special effects fleshed out a movie that given it's goofy title could have been a mess, but instead turned out really good. I'd reccomend it. It was a lot of fun.",1422316800,,794,4.664285714285715

4738714,2,B005LAIHZE,"All I can say is I hated this movie. I was watching it on TV, FX or TNT I think. Yes with commercials. Even so you get the store pretty much. This movie sucks and I am not meaning because it is about vampires. Not at all.

The movie is about a young Abe Lincoln, even before he marries Mary Todd. He has no beard and is not eve a lawyer yet. His friend is training him and sending him on missions to track down and kill vampires. At first you don't know his friends story and off the top of my head I cant remember his name but you will recognize the name from history.

So Abe is a Vampire Slayer. I have such a problem with this little story. Without a doubt I can tell you Abe was never a vampire slayer, because there is NO SUCH THINGS AS VAMPIRES. Sorry if you disagree with me.

At one point they are in the south to save a young black man, also a key figure from history, he as been taken prison and taken down to the south. Abe goes with his other friend to retrieve him. A battle ensures, there are several vampires to vanquish. The head bad guy is there but of coarse he gets away the movie is still too early in the film to have him be defeated.

Next you learn Abes friend story. His friend is a vampire. He was ambushed on the road with a girlfriend, or wife and she is slain but the friend is bitten and becomes a vampire and out of revenge right then and there, he kills several if not all of the attackers.
It is at this point in the film that I had to stop watching, I wasn yelling at my TV too much for all the inaccuracies in the film and the flat out fact that ABE was not a vampire slayer, and none of the prominent figures in history were vampires either. I still hold to the point there is NO SUCH THING AS VAMPIRES.

I do not recommend this movie for any reason, don waste your time or money on it. No at all family friendly. I tried to watch it and go in with the mind set of a work of imagination. But I just plain did not enjoy this film. Go watch something else. You want Vampires, Buffy the Vampire slayer is 10x better and even that movie is lame beyond belief. Or try the Twilight series. Van Helseng is a pretty good vampire movie.",1416441600,,2163,3.9861431870669746

I mean, taking a man I greatly admire and adding vampires to the already hellish experience of the Civil War?  I thought it would be blasphemous.  But the movie had great special effects, more character development than I would have expected in such a weird tale, and an interesting take on history.  The idea of slavery being championed for the sake of keeping vampires at bay can be considered controversial, perhaps even incendiary if one lives in the South and still flies the Confederate flag.  (I don't fly that flag.  I'm just saying.)  But the superhero gymnastics of Lincoln kept me from dwelling too much on the God-awful waste of human life during the Civil War.  The movie still captured the man's humility as well as his humor and his desire for justice. It was entertaining, but thought provoking as well.",1414800000,,928,4.75

 As the Greek philosophers say, On the one hand there are no vampires; Honest Abe was an historical figure so the entire enterprise is just silly-time fantasy.  But a lot of movie fodder can be blasted on a similar basis.  We can point to Battleship, Prometheus, The Avengers and John Carter in just the first part of this year for comparable implausibility.  If we hold to this level of verisimilitude in our movie going we will soon be left with only documentaries and infomercials for our pleasure.  This would not be good.
 On the other hand seeing the very first Republican President as a full blown action hero is a lot of fun.  He spins his sliver coated axe like a baton twirler.  He hacks, he slices and dices his vampire victims into disposable chunks.  And when the mayhem is over for the moment, he drops one or another of the historical Presidents pronouncements on the nature of man and governance.  A huge part of todays movie audience is outside of North America.  One wonders how vampire aficionados watching in languages like Pusthu, Hindi or Arabic will react to the occasional insertion of comments like No man is free if one man be slave or The government of the people, by the people and for the people will not parish from the earth.  American culture is overwhelming and it is cool to think we are exporting something more important that the Snooky and her like.
 This is not very scary.  As a horror movie, it is not very horrifying (except for one scene where the vampires invite their slaves to a dinner dance.  That was icky.)  Benjamin Walker as Honest Abe does not sparkle.  Rufus Sewell as Adam, the head of the undead, is both more interesting as an actor and more traditional as a blood sucker. The chief vampire in the tradition of Bella Lugosi should be a handsome man, and Sewell certainly is.
  Lugosi was intimate and seductive.  He took his prey one at a time.  His thrilling creepiness came from his undeniable attraction to young women.  He lured girls into becoming his undead brides for all eternity.  The vampires in this film might as well have been the space creatures in Cowboys and Aliens for all the difference it made.  Loads of vampires, undifferentiated and anonymous, appear, wreak havoc and are dispatched in a way that hardly arouses our interest much less compels it.
 I can recommend this R rated two saw blade movie only to people seeking an air-conditioned refuge on these hot days.  It runs one hour and 45 minutes which seems short in that they spent $69 million to make the thing.  We should expect more for that kind of money.  It has brought in a tepid $24 million over the three day opening weekend worldwide.  It might be a stretch for the producers to get their money back.  Note to producers, make better movies.",1412640000,,2811,4.62020202020202

4739175,4,B005LAIHZE,"I enjoyed the heck out of this.  It's an  amalgamation of a book that was itself an amalgamation of history and high (dare I say it????) 'camp'!!!  Not since the sixties and movies like 'Casino Royale' and 'What's New Pussycat' came out did you have this meshing of genre's with sly tongue-in-cheek humor (and maybe an 80's Most Excellent movie or two).  Of course today with all the special effects and violence and 3D in your face action there's much to lampoon here and they do it with more reverence than you'd imagine.  Of course knowing that Timur Bekmambetov (Director of Night Watch and Day Watch) is helming assures that you're not going to get your run of the mill Hollywood movie marvel (nee: Marvel Movie).

I'm sure that's what killed the box office, because the audience having been trained in the Hollywood Gerbil cage were not ready for this break the mold and run free kind of treatment.  There is a story.  There is lots and lots of action.  And the Director certainly understands 3D...but most of all...he has that Russian sense of humor that comes through in every frame (do they still have those???).  The whole movie is a kick and I enjoyed myself immensely.

So before you rush back to that Gerbil cage and start the coming Marvel Wheel Of Fortune spinning cash into Hollywood's bottomless craw again take a moment out for this prim and proper, sly and sedate, erstwhile look at our beloved 16th President in a new light.**

If you don't know who Harriet Tubman is and the Underground Railroad, or Jefferson Davis, or Stephen Douglas, you might struggle through this story.

We meet young Mr. Lincoln as a boy, whose mother is killed by a vampire.  At his mothers grave, he resolves to kill the guy, not knowing that he is part of the undead.

Lincoln meets a man who claims to know how to get revenge, teaches him in the ways of whipping around an axe until it goes faster than the eye can follow. Lincoln also learns martial arts moves and runs up walls so he can jump down and swing faster.

Obviously one rolls ones eyes, since martial arts was basically unknown in American society in the mid-19th century.

Still, its fun seeing the vampires get together to create a nation of their own, complete with a 5000 year old vampire who supports the South, so the slaves can be a constant source of blood for them.  Yikes!

An ocean of horses, as a vampire runs and jumps from horse to horse, and breaks a few of the animals necks as he is chased by Honest Abe.  No animals were hurt, since the CGI horses cannot be killed.  But wow, so realistic!

The story is even better when we get to Abe stumping for president.  When we see the guy before a mighty (CGI) crowd, giving his Emancipation Proclamation (look it up!) it is an amazing thing.

Tim Burton helped produce this one and it shows with the crazy imagery and the horrific attacks by the vampires.

Historic Perspective:

Yes, little Willie Lincoln did die at 11 years, though Im doubtful it was by a vengeful vampire back from Abes youth to wreak havoc on his family.

Yes, the Union had a hard time at Gettysburg, though I doubt it was because of vampires being indestructible to lead bullets, nor that getting silver bullets and silver cannonballs turned the tide of war.

If there was a 5,000 year old vampire who witnessed the Jews being slaves to Egypt, why did it take Adam so dang long to get a following and a nation?  Youd think after the first 2000 years he might get bored or something.  Oh well.

Bottom Line:

The film is gory, horrific and a lot of fun.  If you're a Civil War enthusiast, youll have a lot more fun pointing out inaccuracies and such or even understanding the puns and humor of the tale.

I enjoyed the special features too, though the meeting of Lincoln and Poe and such were stretching it a bit.",1398643200,4,2534,4.4468546637744035
4739614,5,B005LAIHZE,"This movie is really good, especially when watched in 3D, oh my GREAT! The making of it is high quality.",1398124800,,104,4.25
4739615,1,B005LAIHZE,"In a year that also brought filmgoers another serious, high-minded Lincoln film full of award-ready performances and lofty ideas, the notion of Abe slaying vampires is a perfectly fun and welcome basis for big, summer-blockbuster silliness.

However, screenwriter Seth Grahame-Smith, producer Tim Burton, and most of all director Timur Bekmambetov take their Van Helsing version of Lincoln far too seriously, treating the vamp-dusting proceedings not like a cheesy, campy flick, but an essay prompt on a social studies exam. Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter opens with a solemn quote from the Book of Genesis when it would have been better off taking a page from Roger Corman. Cleaved of a sense of tongue-in-cheek camp or humor, the film that follows is smothered in faux nobility as the Great Emancipator mows down bloodsuckers with grim determination.

Bekmambetov's never been a model of stylistic restraint. First with the spastic Russian fantasy-action epics Night Watch and Day Watch and then in Hollywood's Wanted, the director explored new ways of making his ADD-edited action films feel ponderous despite his trademark visual seizures and penchant for slo-mo, sped-up, slow-again action shots. That leaves Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, a film full of restless kinetic energy but no juice. There is an intentional artifice to Bekmambetov's cinema that gives it a faded one-dimensionality, as if his films are grim lithographs. They are full of spraying blood, but no beating heart, with no room for humanity amid the arch monochromatic tableaux.

The director's much-ballyhooed fight visuals are impressive in small doses, and he can execute a dazzling batch of shots, but there is no grasp of scene, and the CGI-staged stunts have no emotional heft - they are just eye-popping tricks lacking a gut-punch. All is constant titillation with no giggling exploitation flavor - it is spectacle and sensation, epic chintz and chutzpah, none of it making much sense. Bekmambetov loves to pan over iconography, from stovepipe hats to the Washington Monument, but his characters feel as though they are also carved in the sides of granite tombs, frozen forever astride destiny but not really going anywhere. It is not the best approach for a film that must already carefully straddle and draw cinematic friction from two very different genres.

As Abe, Benjamin Walker keeps striving for charisma beneath the top hat, but is continually interrupted by training montages in which he leans to twirl his silver-edged ax. And Mary Elizabeth Winstead also does her best as a coquettish Mary Todd, but the moment she and Walker start to fan flames of courtship chemistry, Bekmambetov yanks Abe back to work at the frenzied, nonsensical vampire slaying. The cast is rounded out by Rufus Sewell easily tossing off snooty, aristocratic villainy without spilling his brandy. But as Abe's mysterious mentor in the vamp-combat arts, the very talented Dominic Cooper seems further doomed to play supporting characters in Hollywood fantasies. Anthony Mackie and Jimmi Simpson are also on hand as a couple of Lincoln's long-time compatriots.

As with so much Hollywood escapism these days, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter mistakes premise for plot - disjointed and scattershot, the film feels fuller of ideas than sense. About two-thirds of the way through, having run out of things to do, Abraham Lincoln gives up on having the Young Man with an Ax routine and rushes through Lincoln's political rise - the narrative economy no doubt encouraged by a disappointing lack of beheading during the Lincoln-Douglas debates.

Suddenly, the film arrives at the Civil War and Gettysburg where Bekmambetov plays at historical melodrama, slapping awkward faux glory on civil war scenes. There are also attempts throughout to blame the Southern slavery culture on vampires, which might be offensive if the filmmakers cared about what they were saying. Offensive or not, played the right way, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter could have been howling, eye-rolling fun. But Bekmambetov cannot figure out how to wink at his audience through the deadpan, and so the film feels so much duller than its catchy title promises.",1397520000,,4193,5.288288288288288

4739660,1,B005LAIHZE,"About half way through this imbecilic abortion ""abraham lincoln - vampire killer"", (please appreciate that I did not use caps), I decided that I must write a review of this mortifyingly vile movie. Artistic merits aside, (yes, the wardrobe was well done, the CG was technically stunning), this movie shall forever stand out as a modern day milestone  as to why hollywood is dying.
Firstly, the writer of this screenplay, a one seth grahame-smith, (what kind of man hyphenates his name?) clearly has a deep rooted abhorrence of the Confederate South...to the point of the psychotic I would dare say. The kind of unmasked hatred that would send any thinking person to almost fear for the safety of others who might come into contact with such a depraved mind. One can only believe that this writer suffered some kind of ""Deliverance"" episode while south of the Mason/Dixon line to have conjured such a convoluted and murky story.
To make matters worse, the portrayals of the black slaves, including believe it or not Harriet Tubman (I kid you not), as highly articulate and sensitive crusaders against the evil southern white boys, (who have aligned themselves with a vampire cult), is enough to turn one's stomach, not just from the knowing that this was beyond ""artistic license"", but actually an affront to one's sense of failing historic perspective. Mind you, I know that this was just a movie, but have no doubt about it, this movie was intended to offend....and in that end it succeeded, in so many ways.
That this was a box-office bomb, should have been my first clue which I ignored to my everlasting chagrin.
Now you might wonder why I bought this DVD, and to that my defense is that the producer of this horrendous garbage is Tim Burton, who's past movies, I have always enjoyed in some kind of quirky way. Added to this, some of the recommendations posted here prior to my review, I thought made wanting to see this flick.....tempting. Now my only question is how do I destroy this DVD copy I now possess?",1395964800,2,2015,4.757142857142857

4739665,5,B005LAIHZE,"i can't believe i'm giving this 5 stars.  when i sat down to watch this movie, i fully expected to turn it off halfway through because i was certain that it would be terrible.  i mean, who in their right mind would think a movie like this would be any good, based on the stupid trailers, cliche slo-mo action scenes, boring vampire stuff, and ridiculous premise?  i have not read the book, just so you know.

i think the only way this movie works is because they played it straight.  it wasn't a comedy at all like i thought it would be, they took the subject matter seriously and they tied together enough historical references to almost make it seem believable.  they follow abe lincoln through is entire life and focus on lots of other things besides the killing of vampires.  he meets mary todd and courts her, he becomes a lawyer, and we get a sense of his entire life and how fighting vampires shapes so much of who he is.  i mean, sure there are lots of silly action parts and historical inaccuracies, but the core of the movie works as a serious drama, in my opinion.

i liked the acting for the most part, and the guy who played lincoln i really thought did a fantastic job.  again, it would have been easy to turn this movie into a stupid black comedy, and i commend the cast and director for taking it seriously.  the romance between lincoln and his wife seems natural, and the death of his son really is sad to watch.  the way he shifts away from killing vampires and focuses on the abolition of slavery was well done and i believed in his character's motives.  i liked the side characters too and i even liked how the vampires were portrayed at times.  the bad guys speech about how slavery is a fact of human nature was pretty interesting as well.  the movie does take the action stunts a bit too far at times (the stampede sequence is pretty brainless) but i never thought the movie itself was getting stupid.

i expected this movie to be terrible and it really surprised me.  it is much better than the jokey title or the awful trailers make it sound.",1394496000,2,2067,4.369109947643979

There was a clever mix of history and fiction put together that I thought was interesting. Watching the vampire slayings were cool but it was kind of funny having a famous president be the slayer. Overall the movie was enjoyable and I would recommend this to people who enjoy vampire movies and give chances to the ones that are kind of out there. 4 Stars!,1393977600,,498,4.144329896907217

Since detoxing from the many lies taught in schools across America, I found this movie to be important enough to purchase, as it has a decent amount of symbolism.  For the past two years it's as though I have new eyes to see the messages Holly-weird twists in order to keep a story-lie alive in modern times.  The lie that is taught about Abraham Lincoln ""freeing"" the so-called Negro slaves is just laughable now that I am an adult, and it was given treatment in this film (of course).  America is a spiritual Egypt, so it is only fitting that the oppressed in the film ended up with what they were given, as were their ancestors in Ancient Egypt upon their great Exodus.  ;)

Conventional vampires with their tried and true foils they are not, but blood thirsty zombies that Abe Lincoln cuts down with his trusty axe.  Tim Burtons continual use of slow motion cuts during action sequences begins to get boring and quite annoying very quickly, and the color of the whole film seems to be washed out, almost as though it was shot in a Sepia tone.

4739982,5,B005LAIHZE,"As readers of alternative history are all too aware, the suspension of disbelief is critical to enjoying novels like this one which tell the story of Abraham Lincoln and his life long war against vampires.

To my eye, the art is probably at its highest form with writers like Professor Harry Turtledove, whose extended education in the area(s) they embellish can't help but make their stories all the more believeable. A great case in point of this type of writing at its high point is probably his In the Balance four part series where Turtledove revisits World War II, albeit in an altered form where space aliens invade Earth midway, much the chargin of existing the then existing Earth combatants.

On the other side, the art has its low points.  To my eye many examples of these can be seen in the cheapie What If books you can find on sale in many bookstore bins that are marked with the words CLEARANCE SPECIAL.

Happily this book is closer to the high point than the low point.  And throughout the story the author reveals not only a good working knowledge of Abraham Lincoln's true biography but also an even better knowledge of the way people wrote and expressed themselves back then.  To my reading, there's probably no better writing in this book than when the author is writing and using Abraham Lincoln's 19th century voice to express himself.

That having been said, this book is still not on par with the highest of the high and that's because for knowledgeable Lincoln readers there were several factual mistatements that were made thoughout the text.  The most obvious one was when Edwin M. Stanton was described as being part of Abraham Lincoln's cabinet in 1861 (before even Ft. Sumter as a matter of fact) when in fact Stanton didn't join the cabinet until the next year.

On the one hand readers could say who cares about a factual mistatement in a book which discusses Lincoln's career as a vampire hunter.  However I think the better argument is still that when you're trying to tell a really outlandish story about a history character, it's probably best to keep your verifiable historical mis statements to a minimum.

Because the artistry and creativity of this story was as otherwise good as it was though, this book still deserves five stars.  It's a fun ride and new readers of this book should be advised to come ready to suspend disbelief and have a good time.",1381363200,,2392,4.696172248803828

I had my doubts about seeing this film, but I was pleasantly surprised and actually quite impressed by this film's visual style. It truly has a nightmarish quality about and that is the one lingering after effect of this strange film. Many parts of this film come off rather camp and history is reduced to a very minimalist artistic form of art, yet these very aspects of the film add to its strange and unsettling effect on the viewer. At times the film reassembles a very low budget television mini-series while at others it looks like a widescreen extravaganza. I saw the film in both the standard flat-screen presentation and the very impressive and technically astounding 3-D version. The film has a strange curiously voyeuristic quality about it. The almost bleached out colors, slow motion shots and digital editing, baroque costume designs and haunting set decorations and designs bolster these.

4740313,4,B005LAIHZE,"If you know a little bit about history and enjoy a well-done, classic-style vampire flick, go ahead and give this a try. Actually it is a good ""companion"" movie to academy award nominated ""Lincoln"" in that ""Lincoln"" provides a history-refresher that will prep the viewer for this movie. It's interesting to see that the two follow roughly the same period and events. A couple of differences with ALVH is that it starts when Lincoln was a boy and, of course, unlike in Lincoln, in ALVH the troubles he faces in terms of his personal woes and political challenges are largely due to a small but vibrant and quite nasty vampire population.

As in any good vampire movie there is the morally conflicted vampire (I won't say who that is) who the rest on the eternal-beings despise. Sure he has to live off human blood, but he is at least more discriminate in his choice of victims, picking low-life scums the type that cruelly prey on defenseless women.

This movie is extremely clever in weaving the historic story and vampire legend into one film. There is a ton of violence, guts, gore and black and red blood in this movie. The fight scenes are elaborate, well choreographed, and rather artistic. The actors are fully committed to their roles, the friend and romance chemistry between them is wonderful, and you do ache in this movie for the down trodden to succeed.

As a lover of smart, original, off-beat, well-acted films with excellent cinematography this easily could have been a five star film for me. The one area where if falls short, in my opinion, is squandering the opportunity to weave one key historical event into the fabric of the vampire story. I won't be a spoiler by saying what specifically, but for me this was the one flat point in an otherwise exceptional film.",1372982400,,1783,4.708333333333333

Take a true life character then put a myth around him that vampires are real and living in the United States and you have an interesting premise for a story.  Go into this thinking it is a B Fantasy for fun and you will probably not be disappointed.

4740354,3,B005LAIHZE,"If you think movies are made to be enjoyed as action festivals, and thinking is not overly necessary, then this is a film for you. If you have any desires in the way of cerebral movie making, go elsewhere...this is a silly movie that counts on the fact that you'll go for its funny premise, and then it pretty much depends upon stunts and slight historical tie-ins to provide the remaining humor (Alan Tudyk of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dodgeball-A-True-Underdog-Story/dp/B000I9X6NG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story</a>&nbsp;as Stephen A. Douglas, for instance).

We meet Honest Abe when he witnesses the death of his mother -- of course at the hands of vampire Jack Barts, portrayed by Marton Csokas (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings-Trilogy/dp/B007ZQAKHU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings Trilogy</a>]). This brings about one of the film's conceits: that slave owners are actually vampires, spawned by a vampire named, of course, Adam, played by Rufus Sewell (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-City/dp/B008G87K74/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark City</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Knight-s-Tale/dp/B008Y7DKK8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Knight's Tale</a>) an evil slave owner whom Abe stopped from whipping up on a slave named William Johnson. From then on he battles them, though for the large part of the early film he is the only one who sees them. His tutor in this endeavor is a man named Henry Sturges, played by Dominic Cooper (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Captain-America-The-First-Avenger/dp/B0095P33IW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Captain America: The First Avenger</a>). Naturally, Abe's weapon of choice is -- of course -- an ax? And one with a rifle inside of it.

To relate more of the plot is to endeavor in foolish details, but suffice it to say that Abe not only goes on to be POTUS, bu he also leads the Civil War campaign against the South in order to ride the country of vampires...AKA slave owners. Here's where I found the premise to be a little wonky and maybe just a tad offensive; to me, it signified that America's slave owners can be excused from their actions by telling us they were inhabited by demons. Yes, it's just a comedy, but I found this to be pretty rank.

What takes place throughout this movie is all cinematic play: stop-action violence where axes and bullets and teeth are all bared in their glory for the sake of the audience. Lest you find yourself taking this too seriously, Abe not only chases the bad guys by literally running along the backs of stampeding horses, but our vampire actually grabs one of the horses by its hoof and swings the horse itself at Abe's head.

The vampires have impossibly wide mouths and teeth like stalactites, and they move with a visual flurry that begs even the most forgiving minds. Leaps are not enough: the vampire springs off, grabs a chair, flips it mid-leap, then lands upon its attacker with the legs of the chair pinning their limbs. Such rampant visual imagery is meant to fill the screen with action, but it tends to numb the viewer, as do the constant ""deaths-that-aren't-deaths"" as the profligate vampires go on and on in their almost endless fights.

That notwithstanding, ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER is a silly movie that at times tries to dress up in serious clothes, and while it is never outside being tongue-in-cheek, I found it too silly to be serious, and too serious to be funny.

4740406,1,B005LAIHZE,"Never has the ridiculous tried to sound more serious than it does in ""Abe Lincoln Vampire Hunter.""  Clearly a lot of money went into the numerous set-piece battle scenes, with growling vampires springing from the shadows everywhere, snarling and savaging mortals, and Abe Lincoln whirling kung fu-like and flailing and chopping away at them with his trusty axe.  Indeed, the entire shebang culminates in wave upon wave of vampires assaulting a Union train carrying the silver bullets and munitions necessary to defeat the vampires, who have thrown in with the Confederacy to battle Abe and the North. Blood splatters everywhere, heads literally roll, as the train barrels toward apparent doom.  But we get ahead of ourselves.  Suffice to say that the script is truly awful -- beyond awful.  Yeah, they made the mistake of letting the novelist write the screenplay, although with a story this ridiculous it would probably be hard to do it with a straight face.  Here are some dialogue samples: ""Vampires are real, Mr. Lincoln.  They exist.  In every state, in every union."" Spoken to Abe, who is being trained in killing vampires with his trusty axe: ""Do you promise to commit to the life of the hunter, and put aside feelings of vengeance?"" (I kid you not.)  And when Lincoln is a little too wimpy with his axe, although he is being urged to hate, hate hate: ""What do you hate, Mr. Lincoln?  Real power doesn't come from hate, but from truth."" And later: ""Your enemies have the power to render themselves invisible.""  Yes, this awful, overly dramatic, wooden, stilted dialogue plods on and on, at times silly and embarrassing.  ""Vampires have been in the New World for centuries.  They built an empire in the South.  But in recent years they have been moving north.""  Abe to Mary Todd, his bride-to-be: ""You want to know the truth, Mary? Every night I go out and kill vampires."" Later, Abe turns more noble: ""I would fight not with an axe, but with words and ideals.""  Mary to Abe: ""You've gotta eat, Abe.  You're only human.""  And on the eve of the Civil War, the head vampire tells President Jefferson Davis: ""Rest assured, Mr. Davis, you'll have as many of my kind as you need.""  And poor Abe, fraught with remorse, troubled by the fact that vampires have infiltrated his playroom and bitten his son, taking the poor lad's life: ""How can I win a war if I can't even protect my own family?""  It's not only Abe who is troubled.  On the eve of Gettysburg, the vampires lament: ""It's time we had a nation of our own.  Come on, we've got a train to catch.""  No, I am not making this up.  All of this is too bad, because the battle scenes are quite elaborate and clearly a great deal of money was spent on this.  I know this employs Hollywood craftspeople and keeps the studio wheels turning, all well and commendable.  But you'd think everything would proceed on the basis of a reasonable script.",1368748800,3,2894,4.658777120315582

I will admit, this movie is far better than I expected. Abe kicks butt and swings a mean axe. However, he doesn't do it often enough. The action(fight scenes), are well done and impressive. The attempt to mix history with the vampire hunting takes up too much action time. I feel that people watching this movie are not watching the movie for the historical aspect. Yet, the historical part was not overly boring.

I have seen the movie twice. I missed a lot during my first view. In my opinion, the biggest selling point of this movie is the fight scenes and there are simply not enough of them.

4740625,2,B005LAIHZE,"I tried, I really did.  I suspended disbelief and mentally prepared myself that I was about to watch a movie featuring such an outrageous, fantastical story that was going to be anathema to the actual historical Abe Lincoln--that I was about to be presented with utter nonsense.  And to be fair, ABRAHAM LINCOLN:  VAMPIRE HUNTER is well-made, from its in-depth cinematography to impressive sets and costumes to spare-no-expense special effects; the filmmakers definitely cut no corners.  But still. . .in spite of all my efforts not to smirk, roll my eyes, or just burst into hysterical laughter, this clucker is so inane and brain-dead stupid I found myself rapidly doing all of the above.

Who knew the Civil War was fought so vampires could have their own country?  To Hades with slavery; slaves were mere food for the evil Southern vampires.  And since his mother was killed by a bloodsucker when Honest Abe (who, it turns out, is not so honest) was a boy, the rail-splitting soon-to-be politician has been hacking vamps to smithereens with his silver-plated ax (which also doubles as a shotgun for those most opportune times).  And what's the lone weapon that can kill an army of Southern vampires?  Silver bullets!  So President Abe has every piece of silver in Washington melted down and molded into bullets, hauling the payload himself via rail to Gettysburg--and fighting four score of vampires en route.  There.  Just had a good belly laugh as I wrote this.  And naturally, as it's only fitting for a movie so outrageously over the top, once the vamps decide it's feeding time their mouths and fangs grow to piranha proportions.  Those changes created the most laughs for me.  Funny stuff.  The cast, except for a bored looking Rufus Sewell, is totally forgettable; there are even attempts to present Lincoln the speechmaker in a serious tone that backfire profusely.  If you like good horror ABRAHAM LINCOLN:  VAMPIRE HUNTER falls short; if you like a riveting story ABRAHAM LINCOLN:  VAMPIRE HUNTER falls even shorter.  But if you like bad, by all means give ABRAHAM LINCOLN:  VAMPIRE HUNTER a look.

4740626,4,B005LAIHZE,"And that was Honest Abe's favorite way to launch into one. I think he would have gotten a real kick out of this movie.

I truly expected this film to be terrible; after all, the premise is absolutely ridiculous. After a while, though, I found myself able to suspend disbelief and enjoy it. Why not a superhero President, after all? Especially the greatest of all our Presidents?

Young Abraham Lincoln, rail-splitter, flatboatman, lawyer, and political aspirant, has a deep dark secret: He's a Fearless Vampire Hunter armed with a silver bladed axe which he handles like a nunchuk, and when he's not splitting rails he's splitting vampires, who seem to be a plague on the frontier.

Actually, they're a plague everywhere, especially in the South, where they've set up their own secret Vampire Empire (Vempire?), feeding off the slave population for generations. Tired of living in the shadows, the vampire hordes decide to set up their own country, and Abe Lincoln must lead an army to conquer them before they destroy every mortal below the Mason-Dixon Line, ultimately moving North in search of victims. And mortals call it ""the Civil War.""

So, in sum, the film's message is that the Confederacy is a nation full of murderous bloodsuckers. It's an interesting twist on history (and the history in ABRAHAM LINCOLN VAMPIRE HUNTER is pretty twisted, so kids, don't do a book report on it), and, oddly enough for a film of this type, a direct political statement on human rights.

It's very clear that this movie wouldn't do well on Stone Mountain, Georgia, but if you just like fast-moving action and good special effects, and excellent cinematography (the film has a definite tintype feel to it), then sit back and go for a wild ride.

4740630,1,B005LAIHZE,"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is a horrendous movie on all counts.  I think the most offensive thing about the film is that it actually tries to tell a story about our realistic US president Abraham Lincoln actually growing up to become physically powerful and vengeful as a result of his mother being killed, but... it tastelessly centers around vampires.  To me this is incredibly stupid.  It also shows a clear lack of creative ideas on the part of Hollywood.  What's next, RoboCop"" Vampire Hunter?  How about Albert Einstein vs. zombies?  If THIS is what movies have now resorted to, count me out.

Anyway it's a major flaw in my opinion to try and write a storyline around the actual real life of Abraham Lincoln but deliberately sabotage it by turning it into a generic vampire-slicing film.  Why bother writing a script when nobody's going to believe it?  Unless you live under a rock and have zero idea who Honest Abe is.  C'mon.  It's not even a horror, and not just because vampires aren't really scary and don't appeal to me it the least.  It's because instead of seeing bucket loads of blood or a pleasant build up of suspense and atmosphere, you're forced to witness intolerable and overused Matrix-style far-fetched killings that just go on and on.

4740633,4,B005LAIHZE,"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter takes historical events and characters and infuses them with fantasy to reflect what we already know or think we know about the Civil War and President Lincoln. It builds upon the image of Lincoln as the Great Emancipator, further cements Gettysburg as the pivotal battle of the Civil War in our collective memory, perpetuates some of the South's Lost Cause ideology, and replaces the real, material horrors of slavery that made Lincoln into the anti-slavery politician that he was with supernatural horrors that lead him to fight with words, and a very, VERY spiffy axe.

The fight scenes get a tiny bit dry after a while, but the vampires are appropriately frightening and predatory. No sparkling mopers or flippant hedonists here. Do not expect wonders from the plot, but it's not terrible either. Give it a chance, and you might just enjoy it!

4740686,4,B005LAIHZE,"When you first see a movie titled ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"", you may like many shake your head, laugh or just be in shock that such a ludicrous movie could ever be greenlit by Hollywood, never mind ever getting made. Plus if it were to get made that it would be anything but be-headings, blood and generally cheesy and historically inaccurate throughout the whole running time. Well the filmmakers behind this movie wanted to go a different direction and try to make this film as historically accurate as possible (which like anything that has to do with history is up for debate), while having the violence and vampire attacks that make the second part of the title mean something.

The story is remarkably well told, as we see Abe (played as an adult by Benjamin Walker, ""The War Boys"") grow from a young boy where he sees his mother killed by a vampire, to a young man where thanks to a vampire named Henry (Dominic Cooper, ""Captain America: The First Avenger"") has turned good and trains Abe to kill vampires but only those Henry tells him about. Later after opening a shop where he studies law and kills vampires at night he discovers one in particular, his name is Adam (Rufus Sewell, ""Dark City"", ""A Knight's Tale"") and Adam wants to take over America (really what other kind of villain would he be if he didn't want to). During the vampire killings Abe meets Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead, ""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World"") and after some time they get married, settle down and have a child.

The film really picks up in the third act when Abe is a little older, is the President of the U.S. and is in the midst of the civil war where vampires are fighting for the Confederacy. The historical stuff and the vampire killings mix well and shockingly it ends up being a great story despite the incredibly goofy premise. The filmmakers did at least take time to study history and provide a good telling of Abe Lincoln's life (whether totally accurate or not is again up for debate). I really did enjoy this as at the end of the day it's meant to be taken as just fun since the idea of a president killing vampires just grabs your attention (whether it be for the right or wrong reasons).

It's a fun movie, fun to watch and a blast to watch some good old fashioned bloody killings mixed in with some history, just to keep it leveled out. *** out of 4 stars",1367107200,,2370,4.494199535962877

Stick to the story and add in some special effects and you have a winner. In any event, this was fun and the twist at the end on the train with the vampires was unexpected. P.S.

4740693,2,B005LAIHZE,"Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter is one big missed opportunity. The premise of President Lincoln fighting vampires, while absurd, is an awesome idea. In my opinion the film did not live up to its potential. I'm not to familiar with the book. However, I've heard that the novel spanned Lincoln's whole life, and him fighting different vampires throughout his life. In the movie you have the one villain, who is bland and not at all interesting.

The person who played Lincoln, did a good job. In fact between him and the one who played Lincoln in Lincoln, while both good, I think that the one who played Lincoln hear was better. Though the character of Lincoln I thought was very bland here. Mary Elizabeth Winstead did a good job as Lincoln's wife, Mary. I think Winstead did a better job, than the person who played Mary in Lincoln. Dominic Cooper plays the typical mentor character, but I liked him. The rest of the cast is forgettable.

The production values and effects are good, but not great. The production values in Lincoln are better. The fights are okay, but get hammered by constant slow motion. The slow motion gets very tedious and annoying in no time.

Overall this movie had potential to be a fun and entertaining film, but does not live up to it's potential. I heard that the original script was written by the author of the novel, but was later changed to what we got. If they kept the original script, this might have been much better.",1366848000,,1452,4.62015503875969

Absolute one of the worst horror movies on the market regardless if there was ever an interesting book on which it was based.

4740867,3,B005LAIHZE,"I know where the makers of Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter were coming from.  They wanted a goofy, over the top action movie with a title that would instantly catch a person's attention: something that would surely get folk on the internet talking...Where did I hear this marketing gimmick before?  Oh right: Snakes on a Plane.

You think that producers would have realized after Snakes on a Plane that just because you have a goofy, over the top premise with a silly title that catches the attention of the internet does not mean you have a successful movie on your hands.  Just like Snakes on a Plane, Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter will be referenced in movie-related jokes for years to come, but that's about it.  It exists in pop culture as a title; not a movie.  If everyone who referenced, or joked about Snakes on a Plane had actually seen it the film would have been a megahit.  The same holds true for Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter.

People will undoubtedly say ""But it's supposed to be funny!""  No.  The only thing you can call an intentional joke is ""Abraham Lincoln fighting vampires.""  That's it!  You see it in the title, the trailer, you laugh at those, and then the joke wears off.  After you get past the trailer there is no legitimate joke in this movie.

What had me laughing out loud during this movie was how serious it took itself and how cartoonish the action sequences became.  This movie does not play itself for laughs.  These action scenes are played straight (or at least as straight as Matrix inspired action scenes can be played), and then halfway through the movie they decide Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter is an appropriate film to give a lecture on why slavery is bad.  At least Snakes on a Plane never made any attempts to lecture an audience on the matter of racism.

One action sequence in particular I would like to highlight as arguably the most sloppily choreographed, outlandish action sequence of 2012:  A young Abraham Lincoln pursues a vampire and through a series of events gets caught in a horse stampede.  All the horses are computer generated (and 90% of the scene so are Abe and the vampire) and both the characters are jumping onto horses, getting dragged, knocked around, and at one point the vampire spins a horse like Super Mario before hurling it at Lincoln.  That sounds fun, right?  On paper it does, but on screen I had no idea what was going on!  Everything was CGI: the horses, the actors, and they had warped into the blue screen backgrounds of 300.  Then when it ends the characters randomly fall back into a real set.  This scene is just a mess on every technical level imaginable.

I laughed at scenes like this because of how sloppily they were handled, and how incomprehensible the jumble of special effects on screen was.  Not because the actions depicted were goofy (and they certainly were).  I ended up laughing at the film; not with it.

The movie should have ended with young Lincoln before he went into politics.  Just call it a day on ""And that was the secret young days of Abraham Lincoln.""  But it doesn't.  No, instead the movie decides to insultingly dumb down American history while playing it completely straight.  Playing a joke straight is something that usually gets a laugh out of me, but when you simplify the Civil War ""Vampires run the South and want slaves to help feed them"" without ever winking at the camera I find myself frustrated rather than amused.

When this movie tries tying actual history into its campy story it just feels wrong, and out of place.  Having Abraham Lincoln's youngest son be killed by a vampire just made me feel unclean.  If the movie was going to be a campy action story featuring Abraham Lincoln as a vampire hunter they should have gone all the way into the realm of camp, but instead they try making it tie into real life tragedies, and issues relating to slavery.  I don't know, you could easily enjoy this, but it just rubbed me the wrong way.  It needed to go all the way into the realm of camp or not bother making the film at all.

I did watch it with friends and we had a blast riffing the film, and honestly, if you're just looking for a goofy film to watch with some friends Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter isn't too bad a pick.  I can't imagine you enjoying this movie much without some friends chuckling along and adding commentary.  Just know there are better, goofier movies out there that don't have any pretenses to attempt lecturing you on racism and history.",1365292800,,4493,4.60125786163522
4740868,1,B005LAIHZE,"No one's time should be wasted on this crap movie. I have never in my life seen a poorer book turned movie. This only vaguely has some of the aspects of the awesome book. The characters in no way resemble their book counterparts. The book attempted to be historically close to Lincoln's actual life.  It cleverly wove together his remarkable life with the added fictional aspects of vampire hunting. The movie reverts back to traditional vampire lore (when convenient) and completely twists people's motives and personalities.  I understand when movie's attempts to portray a book can't fit in the details because of time limits causing it to feel rushed, but this completely in no way resembles the book. It is utterly baffling that producers, directors and actors would partake is such a horrible, painful piece of crap.

Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter is directed by Timur Bekmambetov(Wanted,Daywatch,Nightwatch).

Based on the book(which I have not read).It is a time piece during the civil war and the young days of young Abraham Lincoln. He befriends a vampire hunter,Henry Sturges(Devil's Double,Captain America) and teaches him the art of slaying vampires with an axe. After all the twilight movies and the crappy Blade Trinity. ALVH brings back the violence and gore in vampire slaying. The best performance is probably by Adam(Rufus Sewell).He is a great charming villian who cannot be stopped,along with his lover Vadoma(Erin Wasson).Benjamin Walker might look the part of Lincoln but he has trouble carrying the movie as a leading man. While there's downtime from Lincoln growing up from a kid to an adult it is rather slow,but he moves to Springfield to hunt down vampires that Henry has appointed him so he can find his mother's killer.",1365120000,,939,5.218543046357616

4740964,2,B005LAIHZE,"Okay.
I'm not sure how to approach this, other than to say way too much of the dour Abe and not enough of the tooth-full vampires.  Throughout, I kept thinking......is this hysterically correct?
The difficulty with period pieces is the obligation to the period in question.  Saddled with trying to custom-fit Abe into the vampire genre is problematic to say the least.  It all comes down to whether or not you can accept the ludicrous premise of a president axing no questions and telling great lies for the good of the nation........wait a minute, which president are we talking about again?

Vampires and Abe, Abe and vampires, nope, I just don't get it and never will.  I'm a huge fan of vampire flicks but this one defies all logic and good sense (not to mention physics).  Part harlequin romance, part ninja warriors on a mission, this movie starts then stalls, progressing awkwardly/slowly between the dullness of the history and the fits and spurts when the vampires are momentarily dealt with.  The camera work is the best part of this movie.  And yes, the horse stampede was easily the best scene.
And!  Best lesson learned from this movie......vampires can't kill their own.  But that doesn't stop them from beating the crap out of each other to the point of......................",1364601600,,1290,4.876146788990826

4740997,2,B005LAIHZE,"So you often find that the movie is not nearly as good as the book. For one reason or another it just doesn't meet expectations. Things get dropped and the can make the movie just plain not as good. What strikes me funny about how bad this movie was is the fact that the author of the novel wrote the screenplay for this. Despite this fact the movie seemed like a loosely based version of the novel. I suppose the movie was more entertaining, the book would probably be more closely similar to a documentary than a blockbuster. It seemed like too many things were changed and dropped though.

Another point that bugged me was Abe's superhuman strength and the disregard for the laws of physics. So many scenes in this movies suspended belief. Why did Abe have to have superpowers in the movie? He didn't in the novel and it was perfect, it made sense. Then to watch the movie it just seemed crazy. Why couldn't Abe have just built up his strength? Why the magical?

I was very disappointed in this movie. Maybe I would have enjoyed it slightly more if I hadn't read the book? Still the physics and superhuman strength bugged me quite a bit. Watch it if you dare.",1363996800,3,1162,4.425233644859813

4741147,4,B005LAIHZE,"Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal... But they never said anything about vampires... Years before he set off to become one of our nation's greatest leaders, Abraham Lincoln stalked the night in search of the bloodthirsty vampire that took his mother's life. After discovering the dark secret that connects the slave trade to the vampires' food source, Lincoln trades in his axe for a prominent position in politics, where his words serve as a far greater weapon against his undead adversaries. ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER brings Seth Grahame-Smith's historic monster mash-up to the screen in a big way, with all of the overblown action sequences and wild special effects that make for fun, over-the-top summer blockbuster. While the deadpan humor may turn off many audience members that were expecting a parody or spoof, what makes it so oddly entertaining is that it isn't a comedy. It is played perfectly straight to the point of absurdity, earning big laughs along the way as Abe twirls his axe with deadly proficiency and carries himself like the Civil War's ""Rambo."" A finer actor couldn't have been chosen over Benjamin Walker, who puts in an excellent performance as the President. The vicious vampires are just as dark as the humor as well, although Rufus Sewell does not present a memorable villain as their leader, Adam. The main issue with the film lies in the aforementioned action sequences, which become far too grandiose for a period piece of this kind. What worked perfectly well in Timur Bekmambetov's earlier films, NIGHT WATCH and DAY WATCH, reduces the imagery on screen to an over-stylized sense of cartoon violence, where a subtler approach would have benefited the character greatly. Still, there is plenty to enjoy in the unwritten history of old Honest Abe.

I actually had to call and talk to a live person at Fox, so hopefully this will help.  If you want to download to iTunes, the steps remind me of a computer equivalent to the multiple doors at the Get Smart headquarters from the old TV show.  First, insert the digital copy disc into your disc drive on your computer.  Second, go to your Computer program and select the DVD and right click and Open. Third, double click on DVDROM.  Fourth, double click to opent Media Manager.  Fifth, at the bottom of the list is MediaManagerII.exe.  Sixth, double click on that and it will open a box for fox digital copy.  There you will have three more steps to follow!  Sixth, enter the code from the DVD insert and then at step 2 pick iTunes for the platform.  Step 3 will give you the actual code you need to enter in iTunes, so copy and paste it into the redemption code box in the iTunes store.  Then, click your heels three times and say ""There's no place like iTunes"" three times.  By then, it should start downloading.

I feel like I just completed a successful brain surgery on someone after getting this accomplished.  I'm going to copy and past this review, because the same thing is needed for Prometheus.

And of course they thought more explosions would improve the story.....not at all.,1362096000,,379,4.205479452054795
4741234,5,B005LAIHZE,"I all ready had the Blu Ray copy, so I knew, I like the premise ( which is quite crazy, as is anything associated with Tim Burton).  The 3D copy of the movie is Outstanding.  3D enhances almost all the movie.  I found it to be in-your-face even more.  Beware of the axe, as it comes right out at you.  Is it better than the Blu Ray, yes.  3D folks want the 3D to be really worth the extra money.  So, this 3D is well worth the extra money.  This Horror/Fantasy film was really good as Blu Ray, but as 3D, it is 100% better. I have had several disappoints for 3D movies (one is I, Robot), where they have been so,so or will not play.  So, out of 5 Stars, I would rate this 3D movie a 10.  I had not really completed watching the movie, when writing the review. Now that I have finished the whole movie.  I can now say that this is the BEST 3D movie that I have purchased so far.  The reason being, this one takes the 3D at points in front of the TV, I no it sounds crazy.  This is the effect of the old time 3D's.  It happens in the Rain Scene-47 minutes; Bats Flying into scene (They appear to be about 2 feet in front of screen TV flying into scene)-58 minutes; Train Fight scene with Engine sparks flying outward-122 minutes; Also fire on trestle-continue of these scenes; and Battle of Gettysburg with silver fly out-132.

4741338,3,B005LAIHZE,"This is one of those movies that doesn't get everything wrong but certainly doesn't do it all right either.
I felt the first half moved so fast you didn't feel compelled by the story,yet had it moved slower I don't think it would have helped either.
The second act of the film is where it starts to shine and the ending is powerfully touching. The second half alone feels like a different beast all together and that's what makes this movie such and interesting enigma and a tough one to properly review.
The action for the most part is mindless, but still manages a few briefly clever moments. Though the vampires look great you're never in the least bit scared by them,and thus you start to see why this whole movie is a give and take affair. Where one aspect is nailed perfectly something else is deeply lacking. The main antagonist,Adam (played by Rufus Sewell) is pretty boring without anything compelling going for his character,yet his vampire maiden Vadoma,(played by Erin Wasson) is great.
Lincoln is uninspired as a youth,but as the character ages so does your emotional attachment to him.

The 3D adds very little to the experience here. No good pop out effects can be found and theirs quiet a bit missing here if you're looking for 3D depth.
In conclusion,Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter has some very redeeming qualities but only the most patient of movie goers will last long enough to find them. 3 stars.",1361577600,,1418,4.717741935483871

I was happy with the cast they chose, although I'm not sure how much the younger Lincoln actually looked anything like the real young Lincoln. If you are expecting a silly vampire film based on an interesting plot, that is what you will get from this movie. If you are a history buff like me and your family talks you into watching this movie like mine did, you will complain from beginning to end.

4741341,4,B005LAIHZE,but good fun all the same. I must admit. I'm a fan of material where the writer learns history. Then makes an alternative past. These are usually the works that test my knowledge of what actually happened and intrigue me to find out if it's a piece of history I didn't know. This was a piece of history I know and the rework was just as interesting for entertainment as what actually happened was for knowledge. A good solid piece that I enjoyed watching multiple times. My only complaint is it felt short in the end. I wanted to see more of what was going on and more of what happened before hand. But I was satisfied overall.,1361577600,,627,4.322033898305085

The only 3 things in the book that made the movie is that there are vampires that Abraham Lincoln fights and has help from his friend Henry and he became the 16th president.  That is it. I liked the book better.  If you read the book and liked it maybe try not to watch the movie.  For me the only redeeming quality of this movie was that Dominic Cooper was in it as Henry and I like him as an actor.  That is about it.,1361059200,,496,3.871287128712871

4741534,5,B005LAIHZE,"ABRAHAM LINCOLN
VAMPIRE HUNTER

Abraham Lincoln, what can be said about this man that hasn't already been said before? Wait I know, he has battled Vampires and Zombies for most of his life, its fact. I guess you dear reader had no idea about that did you? No you didn't, because it is one of the many government cover ups that are out there. Why did they never tell you about this? Well almost all of you would most certainly panic. Alas, now you know, but for today we will only discuss his many vampire escapades.

You see when Abe was but a boy he witnessed his mother killed by a man who his father had worked for. History, or is that secret history has gone on to document that a young Abe would years later attempt to kill the very man who murdered his mother. As it turns out this man was indeed a creature of the night, a vampire. Naturally Abe had no chance against such a beast and was on his way to certain death. But as luck would have it a man named Henry Sturges was on hand to aid young Abe. They were not able to kill the vamp but they did come to an agreement. Henry would train Abe to hunt and kill vampires if Abe did exactly what he would say.

So time would go on, how much time we are not sure but enough went by to make Abe a vampire killing machine. He hunted them down one at a time looking to finally one day find you know who. I am sure you all know about his wife and how they met, his years working towards politics and of course becoming the President. Well during that time he went in and out of vampire slaying including at terrifying night spent on a train. Now I could go on and on with this historically accurate report, or I could say watch this Biopic.

Based on Honest Abe's honest biography by Seth Grahame-Smith who also wrote the script this Tim Burton produced flick is very fun. The look of the film and over all B movie feel only adds to the appeal of the flick. Director Timur Bekmambetov really knows how to shoot action as I am sure anyone who has seen his other films knows. It is these scenes that really drive the movie and push the pace. In fact it makes it feel like the movie could have been longer or at least moved slower at times. Also the final battle between Abe and lead vamp could have been a bit longer for entertainment value, but I am sure this version was the accurate account. Regardless I did like this movie and found it to be very entertaining and historically accurate.

Still I have to say the movie was fun and the performances were just as good. Also I must admit that I really liked the end of the film and I really mean the end as in last scene. It involves Henry and well you will see what I am talking about. I was always a sucker for those types of scenes, once again after viewing you will see what I mean. The Blu-Ray is excellent coming with all kinds of special features. My favorite being the making of which goes into great detail about everything involving the film. Then of course the commentary by the writer is very interesting. There is much more that only make this release a must have for film buffs who enjoy the behind the scenes stuff. Stay tuned kiddies as next time we will be discussing Honest Abe's run ins with zombies, still historic fact, honest.",1360540800,,3246,4.212218649517685

If you have not read this book, then you ""should"" enjoy this movie. Very entertaining and good to watch. Good acting, but simple. Movie goes along at a good pace and the end of the movie is good.

now that being said. IF you have read the book, this movie is VERY average. This normally would not be an issue except for the fact that the screenplay writer is the author. I have seen some adaptations in the past, but the movie about 10% of the book. I hope if you haven't read the book that you can enjoy it after watching the movie.

Why did Hollywood lose their taste in movies that they want to make....they seem to have lost themselves turning every movie into a horror or thriller movie....Come on Hollywood make some decent movies. They are using fairytale stories and making them also as dark as they can and that is not what was expected of the movies. They can't even make a movie that is appropriate for a preschooler, every movie that I have tried to take my daughter to I have walked out of...We do not even go to the theater anymore.

4741683,3,B005LAIHZE,"This film was released long before the award-lauded LINCOLN (Spielberg), and it's timing couldn't be more perfect. It's silly, exciting and quite well-done, as long as you, the viewer, are willing to put all history aside. I thought it might be a comedy or parody, but director Timur Bekmambetov is determined to have seriousness abound. This film, as displayed, is exciting and fun, and extremely well done, with solid period detail and excellent cinematography by the great Caleb Deschanel.

You can pick to pieces the historical mistakes, but why bother? I admire the film as an action film with loads of scares and suspense. Rufus Sewell is, and has always been, the best bad guy ever, and doesn't disappoint here.

Abe might've been our greatest president, and this added prowess is only meant to entertain (even though he was in his late 60's while doing those incredible leaps and bounds). Lighten up, folks! Benjamin Walker is solid as Abe, and the whole film, as nothing but entertainment, succeeds.
What sets this aside is that it takes itself seriously, and that was a good decision.",1359676800,,1094,4.940217391304348

It felt like the movie was a little rushed and it left out tons of the history behind this great president. The movie SHOULD have focused majorly on just the vampire stuff and maybe have made more battle scenes and more on him becoming the vampire hunter. If the movie had ended with him in the end as president that would of been much better...The fact that he comes back as an old guy and the president (Who, even in that time would of been watched everywhere) to hunt vampires and save the country makes you question what the hell is this? If they kept him as young Abraham for the whole movie and in the end shows that was in his past BEFORE he was president, I would be giving this 5 stars..",1359590400,,842,4.171779141104294

There's a bit too much CGI for a story that only needed some special effects to make it scary. Instead, we get to see gravity-defying physics and very unrealistic blood. And why did directors start using the weird density filters in their movies? I just can't believe you need to make everything a blue/black color in high contrast to have a great horror movie.

However, this movie does have some decent (not great) acting and wonderful action scenes. Nice, gothy overtones (a la Tim Burton) help the style of the movie a lot.

Well acted and with some really tense and scary scenes, especially the one where his mother is killed.  Lincoln's mother offically died of ""milk sickness,"" which sounds so mysterious to us today that substituting ""vampirism"" isn't that far off. A different take on vampires in America, which was very refreshing, because I don't like ""nice"" vampires and these aren't.

The shots of D C,and the white house. Abe was know for his speeches. This movie is very good in the action department and his speeches don't get in the way.

I loved all of the little nods to historical events, my favorite of which would give away part of the plot, so I won't say more than that.

The action, choreography, and effects were all a ton of fun to watch.

And I couldn't figure out why Abraham's wife looked so familiar. Uh, Ramona Flowers, anyone? Even though they're completely different characters, you still get a bunch of the quirkiness that I loved about Ramona in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.

4742583,3,B005LAIHZE,It entertained me for the night. It's one of those movies where you know it might be corny in a few places but that's okay. You in the mood for something like this or it's better than the other choices. You're not going to go brag to all your friends that they have to see this movie but Lincoln killing vamps entertains.,1357516800,,321,4.193548387096774
4742584,4,B005LAIHZE,"I really enjoyed this movie, but I guess it appeals to very specific tastes. I for one thought that its strength was the fact that it was not just like the book, as I felt the book would not translate well into film if taken literally. The book succeeds because there is enough fact to make the fiction seem somewhat plausible. In the film, however, there is no entertaining way to be faithful to facts; who's going to want to read several paragraphs of information before every scene just to get context? The movie is tasked with keeping the general blueprint of the book, but finding ways to express the same things without the benefit of elaborate backstory. What the film does well is condense the backstory in a way that it gives enough information to make you understand Lincoln's motivations, but it holds enough back to keep up pretty good pacing. If you're watching this because, you want historical accuracy, avoid at all costs. But, if you want an entertaining alternative history, this movie has lots of fun action and pretty satisfying, if over-indulgent, climax.",1357516800,,1076,4.790322580645161

The movie is serious, but not meant to be taken seriously. It is, after all, a movie about Abe Lincoln killing vampires. So set your expectations accordingly. As I read other reviews here that may be the problem. Expectations. When the movie is called Abe Lincoln Vampire Slayer, I think a lot of people are going to expect something funny or way over the top. This is not that movie. It is a good action movie about killing vampires. Just sit back and enjoy.",1357344000,,594,4.5

4742731,2,B005LAIHZE,I really cannot say much except that the acting left a lot to be desired.  I usually love Rufus Sewell and he wasn't in the movie enough to really carry it.  the story concept was a good fantasy but I think if it was written a little differently it may have flowed better.,1357257600,,272,4.113207547169812

As usual, the book is 100x better, but the movie was very entertaining. Good cinematography and good acting. Obviously, I wasn't expecting an Oscar nor complete historical accuracy, but the guys loved it. My husband said he was actually surprised and is now a big Lincoln fan, lol. I've always been a Lincoln history buff before I read the book or saw the movie. This just made him ""cool"" to the kids today, and most of them don't really care much for American history, sad to say. You have to look at it from an ""entertainment"" point of view and not as an ""insult"" to our president. Keep an open mind when you watch this movie. That is all.",1357171200,,798,4.256578947368421

4742838,4,B005LAIHZE,Seems a little crazy this was an entertaining film. I could watch him twirl that axe all day! It's a neat film because he still goes into politics and becomes president while killing vampires on the side.. You'll get as much history from this film as you would from Spielberg's movie and the icing on the cake is to see Abraham Lincoln as an axe twirling badass hacking vampires..

4742841,2,B005LAIHZE,"As yet another vampire-sploitation flick, it's probably decent, if that's what you're into.  The production values are high.  As  a film related to Lincoln & his times, it does make a few interesting parallels, but in total they last about 5 minutes.  It's anti-slavery flavoring is nice, if minimal, but the rest of the film is ludicrous (Lincoln practicing Kung-Fu-like moves with his axe) in both plot and action, and, of course, violent and gory. The guy who plays Lincoln must have had too much botox before the shoot, as his expression never changes.  2 stars is generous.",1357084800,,578,4.857142857142857

I even took my sweet time renting it from the local redbox.  When I finally sat down to watch it one friday night, it completely surprised me.  This is an EXCELLENT movie.  It's kind of rare for me to grant a movie props on editing, but either the director or editor kept this movie zipping along perfectly thanks to a series of really creative transitions.  Beyond that, it's just a fun movie with a completely likable protagonist and very likable side characters.  I like the fact too that Mary Todd was a unique and likable as Abe himself.  Other than beign slightly reminiscent of ""Priest"" (another movie I liked that most critics didn't) in tone, this movie is unlike any thing else I've seen.  Oh, and if you're sitting the fence on this one when it comes to dvd or Blu Ray, get the Blu Ray.  HUGE difference.  The picture quality is GORGEOUS and the special effects look less hokey.  This is just a fun movie that shouldn't be missed.  Honest Abe kicks some serious Vamp butt!",1357084800,,1130,4.5073891625615765

i got 3 movies for christmas,thinking this one would be good but the #3 of 3 out of them.but it was definately #1.the other 2 were ""dark knight rising""  and ""dark shadows"".i liked them all very much but this one was my favorite.i would also go so far as to say it is my 2nd favorite movie of the entire year behind the ""avengers"".
i am not much of a vampire movie guy.since ""dracula"",ive only liked a handful.they are ""from dusk till dawn"" and ""lost boys"" plus the 2 ive already mentioned.""abraham lincoln vampire hunter is ranked 2nd out of 3 there with ""from dusk till dawn"" being first.
so,it tells the story of abraham lincoln ,slavery,the civil war,abes family,war tactics,his love life,his various occupations etc.i never expected an educational movie here but it actualy is but the other 50% is a totaly blood fest about vampires.it rocks ! i know it sounds stupid but its totaly not.go watch it ! and if you dont,you are being prejudious which is what this movie teaches against.
the only thing i wouldve changed is the ending.now i think i can tell the ending i wouldve used because its not the real ending therefore its not a spoiler.i wouldve had abe at the fords theatre thinking hes solved the slavery and vampire problem.then,john wilkes booth,who has become a vampire,sneaks up and bites him.that is not the end.its nowhere close.but,it wouldve been more horror film like.",1356998400,,1655,4.746527777777778

Biggest problem: Abe's weapon of choice is an axe.  Vampires are supernaturally fast and axes are not.  No matter how hard Lincoln practices, it's not credible that he wages war with vamps using an axe.  Swords were available then, as well as bows and arrows, stakes, fire, and pistols with special bullets.  I loved the ending, and didn't see it coming, though I should have.  The unfortunate movie went straight to DVD, and everyone pronounced it an instant bomb. Not unexected.

4743287,1,B005LAIHZE,"Most of us know of Abraham Lincoln -the 16th president of the United States, writer of the Emancipation Proclamation, preserver of the Union, ender of slavery. But what most of us don't know is that Mr. President was also fighting another war--one against vampires. Little do any of us realize just how much of a role the undead played in the outcome of the American Civil War. It all started at the tender age of nine when Abe witnessed his mother's murder at the hands of a vampire. Soon thereafter, revenge became his new mission. With the help of an undead ally, Henry, Honest Abe mounted his own campaign to exterminate the worst of the vampires and free America from their evil clutches.

After a very painful attempt to get through the audiobook, I decided to give Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter (the movie) a chance. Have you seen the trailer? Doesn't it look awesome?! Sadly, we've been misled. This movie isn't awesome. It isn't even awesomely bad. It's just plain bad. Initially, I attributed my dislike of the novel to the fact that I'm not one for American or presidential history. I find the subject matter to be quite dull. It's just not my bag, baby, and that's okay. I guess I was disappointed because I thought there would be more vampy action in it. So naturally after seeing the trailer, I was led to believe they'd given the movie incarnation the Michael Bay treatment. Oh there was action alright, but not enough of the good kind to save it from being a total disaster.

I think the movies failure comes in that it's just too much, too over the top. Had they attempted to do campy, I could've dealt with that, but they didn't. They took it way too seriously and relied solely on cartoonish CGI effects to achieve the high intensity for which they were aiming. And I know I said I didn't like the book, but the movie deviated so far away from the original source material that it was barely even recognizable. At least Benjamin Walker nailed it in the looks department though his performance was somewhat wooden and shaky at best. There were, however, a few very cool montage-worthy training scenes which kept me somewhat placated. And I also have to give a big nod to my favourite typecasted bad guy, Dominic Cooper. He's just the bestest of the bad. All I can really say is
Food for Thought: Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter somehow managed to be both of poor quality and ridiculously over-the-top at the same time. There is no shortage action but it's a shoddy, unsatisfying type of action that left a very disagreeable taste in my mouth. I cannot in good conscience recommend the movie, however, if American/presidential history is your thing, give the book a whirl.

While the movie wasn't awful, it just didn't do anything for me. It just seems a bit too random for me to be anything but maybe a comedy. We have Abe Lincoln and he wants to kill vampires. Not sure if they were being serious or not but it's one of those things where it was like they wanted to make a vampire movie but wanted to try and take it to the next level so they thought ""Hey let's make Abraham Lincoln the vampire hunter"". The acting was actually pretty good, which salvaged the movie for me to at least be able to finish it. It's just the premise that I couldn't buy for a movie in this genre.

Anyone who does not like deviations from the correct version of history will hate it because they did make some obvious adjustments that could not be true. But the movie was really fun to watch and I found myself cheering for Abe towards the end.

As this movie is not meant to be a serious historical drama you have to go into it with the mindset that you are there to watch a fun, exciting movie that will at times make you laugh.

Visually, the movie looked really cool. Some of the CG could have been improved but nothing that takes away from the overall quality of the movie.

The cast was great and did a great job in character capturing the emotion of the scenes.

The Lincoln character is sympathetic carrying his burden much as the original may have done.  Director Bekmambetov uses stop-action like a mogul.  The mood and tone are borderline transylvanian.

This work stretches your enjoyment of the fantasy by making too many distracting references to Lincoln and his time that are simply unbelievable, making it hard to join in the fantasy. Even the casting of Mary Todd was difficult to fathom, even if just for the fact that in reality she was about 2 feet shorter than Lincoln, and so even the scene where she stretches up a bit and Lincoln bends over (a bit) to have a kiss looked so odd. OK, it's a fantasy, but the train engine making headway uphill as the tracks crumble beneath it reminded me of the battleship being swung around in seconds on its anchor chain in ""Battleship."" Just then, all relation to even the fantasy vanished, and it was laughable. But I'm still glad all the silver in town helped win the Battle of Gettysburg, and of course, who knew the evil vampires fought only on the side of the South.

4743641,2,B005LAIHZE,"If you read the book you'll definitely not like this. I know, another person who doesn't like the movie adaptation of a book but even on a strictly movie basis it was pretty bad. The movie had a basic introduction, just enough to get a person to understand the premise, but not enough for anyone to empathizes with any character.
Basically, it was an action movie with just enough story to break up each fighting sequence to ensure that the entire movie wasn't one long battle. Some of the fight scenes were adequate, don't get me wrong, but there was a lot more that could have been done. The entire affair fell short of nearly any redeemable value.",1356134400,,650,4.516949152542373
4743642,3,B005LAIHZE,"I had no hope whatsoever for this movie and it surprised me. The storyline goes a little fast, but the fight scenes aren't bad and neither is the acting. Overall, this movie is alright considering what it is about.",1356134400,,214,4.512820512820513
4743643,3,B005LAIHZE,This film was more about action than about making the unique aspects of Lincoln's life seem like a cover for his exploits as a vampire hunter.  The action is very good.  Benjamin Walker is no Daniel Day Lewis but he is likable enough as Honest Abe.  One cannot help but wonder what a film with this premise and the cast of the Spielberg film would look like.,1356134400,,358,4.313432835820896

And I also do not like gory movies.

This movie has vampires and lots of killings.

So why did I like it?
The vampire scenes throught the movie, and the killings, are done in a more subtle way than depicted in most modern movies.

At the same time the special effects for the other scenes in the movie were top shelf.

I also felt caught up in the twist on history to depict how Lincoln fought the vampires and how they effected everything during his life.

The director did a great job in putting the story together on film.",1355961600,,580,4.1891891891891895

I was in the mood for a good popcorn movie and this filled the bill.  It was not a great movie by any means and you need to suspend reality quite a bit.  But this movie was not as bad as I had been lead to believe.  The action was awesome and I like the way the film looked.  All in all had a very good time for an hour and a half.

As a history buff I like the blending of fact and fiction.  As a person who knows the world is grey, I like the lack of black and white in the motivation of the characters.  As a martial artist, i love the fighting scenes reminiscent of well produces Asian films.

As well as putting you in the setting, it masterfully wove a secret and realistic (for a vampire movie) battle with the Southern Vampire forces into the life and times of Lincoln and his struggle to free the slaves and reunite the nation.  It had beautifully choreographed action scenes and some decent acting all around.  When I heard of the ridiculous premise of this movie I avoided it. When I finally broke down and watched it I didn't want to like it.  Despite my preconceived notions and prejudices I couldn't help but be entertained from start to finish.

Abe suffers from personal tragedy and tries to go after the killer. He is stopped by someone who takes him under his wing and trains him. Think Zorro with Anthonio Banderas.

Kind of different watching one of our greatest Presidents going around swinging an axe fighting vampires...WOW!  Who knew, that a movie could actually make Abe Lincoln kind of sexy.  This was great watching him learn how to swing his axe because he wasn't much of a gunfighter, but he sure knew how to split logs.  The action sequences were great, I loved watching him swinging his way through that railroad car and through the White House, kicking some serious vampire butt, it makes me so glad that he became our President because now the truth can be told.

4744184,5,B005LAIHZE,"I have to admit that I haven't seen the serious version starring Daniel Day Lewis. And I know very little about Lincoln. But that hardly matters.

I have a Home Theater. That means I get to see new movies only after they have been released to streaming or Blu-ray. Typically that's about three months. I saw all the Oscar publicity around the Daniel Day Lewis version, so I decided to watch this version while I waited.

But before I explain why this version is the superior one, let me draw attention to the star of this film - the previously none too famous Benjamin Walker. Walker is the right height. Lincoln towered over his contemporaries. Daniel Day Lewis does not. So Walker carries along with him some instant verisimilitude. He also looks remarkably like a young Liam Neeson. I looked him up in IMDB and was delighted to learn that he got his big break in ""Kinsey"" playing a teenage Liam Neeson (Kinsey). The resemblance is startling. This has happened ocassionally before as when the aging Robert Redford cast the younger look-alike Brad Pitt to in effect play him in ""A River Runs Through It"".

First you must understand that this movie with the silly horror movie plot and title, is indeed a big budget feature film. On Blu-ray this is a very pretty movie. The photography is great and includes expensive helicopter shots and CGI graphics. This makes for a satisfying viewing experience.

There are also a lot of plot details that have been crafted to make the everything seem real. That of course is impossible because Abe Lincoln did not save the union from the undead blood suckers with a silver coated ax. There were no vampires who were responsible for the institution of slavery. This discordance makes the viewer think. Not many movies make you think.

Like so many other historical movies I expect the Daniel Day Lewis version to preach to me. I expect it to come down hard with it's anti-slavery message. I expect it to try to bludgeon my brain into compliance like the all the early fifties biblical spectaculars.

After watching this film it's impossible to view historical movies in quite the same way again. If Hoillywood can make such a good case for this preposterous premise, they can obviously make a case for anything. Ridley Scott makes historical films that always look good too. George Clooney (known in Hollywood as Red George) makes plausible looking political films. In both cases they use the modern miracles of film and digital technology to create a convincing looking visions of the world as they imagined it to be. They have axes to grind. This wonderful film has real axes.",1355529600,,2616,4.751101321585903

Though the title might make a person think of a cheesy teen horror flick, it has a serious tone throughout. It's a little gory and maybe not a good one to watch with the kids if they are very young. But overall it's a good movie that kept my wife, step-son, daughter, and myself all staring at the screen until the end.

This five minute sketch was everything ""Abe Lincoln Vampire Hunter isn't-smart, funny, and brief.  The film's concept of our greatest President being a slayer of vampires par excellence is palatable for maybe a half hour.  After that you're longing for a repeat of ""The Life and Times of Desmond Pfeiffer"".  Where to begin.  The story is tacky.  The acting is wooden.  The effects are pedestrian.  The gore is a bore.  I also found it offensive, even in a fantasy, the suggestion that Lincoln's mother Nancy and his son Willie were killed by vampires.  I was also repulsed by the conceit that the Civil War was really a battle between the vampires and the mortals.  Regardless, I can't imagine how this debacle was greenlighted other than the involvement of Tim Burton.  Steven Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" will be discussed for generations to come.

However, the last 45 minutes of the movie was exactly what I was looking for in this movie and I loved it.

From a more serious perspective, I did like how the vampire hunter story of Lincoln was blended with his real world life. The story telling approach was similar in some ways to the way the main story of Assassins Creed 3 was told.  Most everyone knows the history the movie/game was based on, but there are a lot of back stories that were never told or still remain a mystery and this movie explained the behind the scenes of Abraham Lincoln in a fun and creative way.",1355356800,,748,4.253521126760563

4744243,3,B005LAIHZE,"As someone who grew up loving horror movies and went on to be a U.S. History teacher, I am conflicted over ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter.""  Prior to watching ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,"" I made two errors.  My first error was in reading the book (which I thoroughly enjoyed) earlier in the year.  My second error was watching ""Lincoln"" which was released in November 2012.  I also failed to follow the sage advice of a former student who once told me to park my brain at the door and enjoy the action when viewing such movies.
""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" would have been much more enjoyable and believable (assuming one accepts the existence of vampires) if it had hewed more closely to the book.  The movie would also have benefitted from an explanation as to how vampires came to America and how they adapted to sunlight.  The use of silver to kill vampires strained my credulity.  I grew up believing that a stake through the heart was the only way to kill vampires and that silver was for werewolves.
While recognizing that ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" is fiction, the courageous depiction of Mary Lincoln was completely unrealistic.
Finally, while understanding that sex sells, the brief sexuality was totally unnecessary and added nothing to the movie.  I am now glad that I did not take my granddaughters to see it this summer.",1355356800,,1354,4.856521739130435

The tale weaves in History with the mythology of this alternate world and sometimes the ideas are half clever but overall it feels average when it really could have been an awesome experience.

Also starring Dominic Cooper and Rufus Sewell.

It's high in most areas except character and story. The latter don't stand out much for me and were pretty basic. Dominic Cooper probably did the best overall acting as the vampire hunter mentor.

The budget for this picture was $69M and it made a bit over $116M at the Box Office (Wiki). It's based on a 2010 novel of the same name by Seth Grahame-Smith.

Now this man's name and rise to presidency has been turned into a very pathetic Vampire movie?!  Someone ( or more than one) please do the following for me in no particular order...

***(please take this as metaphorical, not real - ok?  Geez, I even have to put in a ""warning label"" for a movie review since the world has gone completely off its rocker with all this PC crap and all the other stupidity encompassing what passes for entertaiment these days on TV or at the movies.  Also the ridiculous over-sensitivity about everything that never even entered anyone's mind during the majority of my 50+ years of being alive)***  With that out of the way...

Slap the person(s) who wrote this story, slap the person(s) who thought this was a good idea, slap the person(s) who liked it at the production level before it was even started to be filmed, slap the person(s) who paid for the production, slap the person who chose to direct this, slap all the actors who got paid to be in it (and many of the actors are actors I really like and respect), Give a pat on the back to all the persons involved in the production design and special FX, slap every single person who paid the movie theater price to see this film. I've already smacked myself in the head several times while watching a rental of this movie for paying $3.99 to rent it out of sheer morbid curiosity.

While this movie is certainly a well budgeted production - I rank it up (or should that be down) there with movies like Bad Taste (and look who directed that turd of a film from New Zealand and how far he -and the whole country- has come in the movie business since 1988) as a movie that serves no purpose other than to disgrace the name of a president who was very WORTHWHILE and SIGNIFICANT.

Why couldn't they have switched presidents to Barrack Obama as the vampire slayer.  He's been scaring the crap out of me since his first election to this countris highest office.  I'd have an easier time believing that killing vampires is what he's really doing than believe he has anything to do with running this country other than into the ground even further than the other presidents before him.  I even figure he wouldn't need any weapon to kill vampires, he'd just speak and they'd either die of laughter because they've been around for centuries and have known US real leaders, or they would could also die of boredom.  Perhaps his vampire killing power could be just the sound of his voice causing vampires to explode upon hearing it in person within a certain physical distance??

And these other former presidents just popped into my head as possible movie choices...

George W. Bush could be a vampire hunter as no vampire would even suspect an idiot like that could possibly be a threat to their existence until the ""smart bombs"" started falling on the wrong areas.

President Ford - once again the die laughing weapon, but his hunter companions would also keep getting killed because of his clumsyness, but ""they"" keep giving him more since he was one of the Warren Commission guys who knows the truth about the JFK assassination.

Or why not President Taft - he could just sit on them to kill them?

I'd more seriously believe Jefferson as a vampire hunter since he shot someone on the White House lawn for treason.  Now THAT was a president who didn't take crap from anyone!!

I hope anyone who read this got a laugh, and also choose to NOT spend any money on this truly awful disgrace to the memory of President Lincoln.  Go see the new Lincoln movie that shows who the man really was, how & why he became president and what led to his assassination, instead of the stupidity that is this movie I reviewed.",1355184000,,3884,4.527896995708154

4744856,3,B005LAIHZE,"In what's kinda like Ken Burns ""The Civil War"" meets INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE (plus some MATRIX thrown in for good measure), Russian director Timur Bekmambetov's ABRAHAM LINCOLN VAMPIRE HUNTER is just plain fun.

Everything is well done in this film, starting with the cast.  Ben Walker as Abraham Lincoln is just great.  Unlike some other actors of his generation, Walker never seems aware that he's in a giant movie playing a part.  He just is Honest Abe - he plays the part simply and without trying ""act"" like he's the Railsplitter.  A very fine performance.  His vampire hunter trainer, played by Dominic Cooper (prolly best know as playing Tony Stark's Dad in CAPTAIN AMERICA) is also excellent... as is Rufus Sewell and the 'Head vampire"" and pretty much everyone else in the cast.  Very good acting all around.

Ditto that the photography and costumes and SFX.  In fact, there is a simply fantastic scene where Lincoln must fight a vampire in a stampede of horses - amazing SFX.  The music is good, not great, but certainly serviceable.  The movie looks and feels like a big budget film (which of course it is), and it looks like the money is put up on the screen.

As for the vampires themselves, for the most part they don't seem all that vampire-ish - they can move freely during the day, turn invisible, and other rarely seen tricks - but they are consistent within their own mythos, and make a very nice set of villains.

And as much as this movie is about steampunk kung fu scenes against vampires, it really is about Lincoln himself.  There's one shot of him walking in silhouette down a hallway that sent chills up my spine.  In the end, it is a story about Lincoln, arguably the best President this great country has ever produced - plus some vampires.  And that's pretty dang sweet.  The story does a nice job of intertwining the real man with the fantastical story (basically keeping the facts of Lincoln's life accurate), making for one of the more original movies you're likely to see this year.  There are some elements of tale that perhaps could have been told better - it tends to minimize slavery and paint white Southerners with large evil brush - but it is after all a story about Abe Lincoln killing vampires.

In the end, it's a neat version of the story of a great man plus an army of vampires - what's not to like?

The movie also jumped from scene to scene quite haphazardly, and to me, didn't flow as well as it could have. Really, those are my only two complaints.
The acting was well done, it wasn't too much gore, wasn't awful amounts of nudity (which the beginning will have you expecting), and it kept you on your toes wondering what would happen next.

4745031,3,B005LAIHZE,"What I love about history is that historical documents come to light all the time, and even though history doesn't change, one's view of history does.

After watching this new biopic about Abraham Lincoln (not to be confused with the movie recently released, made by the guy who made ET and other memorable fictional movies) I have a new appreciation for the work of historians who painstakingly sift through old records in order to find new facts.  The result is this wonderful movie that sheds light on many of the choices Lincoln made.

For example, it was his hatred to vampires that lead him to accept the huge losses inflicted on Union troops.  And if not for his dedication to the anti-vampire cause, this nation would be split.

Abraham Lincoln was a great man, but he was a greater vampire hunter.  And in the end, the real lesson is that teach a man to kill a vampire, and you have a vampire killer for the life of the man; give an army silver bullets, and you save the world.

The only fault is that I felt the movie took liberties in using composite characters to move the narrative.  The movie did not discuss that 3 of his 4 sons were killed by vampires.  It is well known that the person who avenged those murders was not Mary Todd, but General William Tecumseh Sherman in an ambush personally planned by Ulysses S Grant.",1354492800,,1336,4.487603305785124

The film is heavy on action and special effects.  Unfortunately, some of the effects wre mediocre at best, most notably during an insane horse chase and the climatic train ride to Gettysburg.  It does do a nice job of weaving in actual events during Lincoln's life, both before his presidency and after, along with the fantastical vampire plot.

4745336,3,B005LAIHZE,"By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, Mississippi

We're told that imagination is a terrible thing to waste.
In this case filmmakers take one of America's most loved presidents Abraham Lincoln and have him battling the undead.
At first I thought the film would be a dark comedy, more tongue and cheek but quickly learned the filmmakers wanted us to take this seriously.
The story begins in 1818 with young Abe living with his parents, Nancy and Thomas who work on a plantation, owned by the ruthless Jack Barts. Barts prepares to beat a young African American boy William Johnson. Young Abe jumps to his defense and in the course, gets his family fired.
That night, Barts, who is a vampire, comes into the Lincoln home and poisons Abe's sleeping mother.
Lincoln grows older with one thought on his mind to kills Barts. He attacks him one night only to discover his enemy has superior power. Abe is saved by Henry Sturges.
Sturges tells the young vengeful man about Barts being a vampire and volunteers to teach Abe how to become a vampire hunter. He explains all vampires descended from Adam, a vampire who owns a plantation in New Orleans. He tells of their weakness to silver and gives him a silver pocket watch.
Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter is fine for escapism fare. It does try to take itself a bit serious, interweaving Lincoln's courtship with Mary Todd, and the background of the Civil War. It is also littered with over the top violence and CGI that kills any believability.",1354147200,,1500,4.747126436781609

All the actors are chosen well and the acting is excellent.  Lots of action and special effects make it less cheesy than you might think.  Apart from the vampires, the film is fairly historically accurate, which makes it all the more entertaining.

The movie does take a few liberties, starting with the premise that Lincoln was a vampire hunter.  The vampires as well buck the well entrenched premise that they are destroyed by sunlight.  Instead, vampires in this movie are killed using silver, which is normally the weapon of choice for werewolves.

Incredible special effects throughout (helped no doubt by the $69 million dollar budget for the film), great casting, with plenty of suspenseful / edge-of-your-seat moments, though never too scary.

If you are looking for serious historically based fiction or bone-chilling horror, you are looking in the wrong place.

That was a guy who looked like Honest Abe, and he did kill the undead with his axe in some pretty nifty ways.  But the ""emotional"" moments of the film felt out of place, the belly laughs that are inherent to this kind of campy thrill-ride were too few... and don't get me started on the whole Mary Todd courtship.  Eeesh... awkward.  Those factors coupled with some occasionally ragtag CGI made watching Abe a bit off-putting at times.

Still... overall, it was good-not-great, with some visual appeal and creative violence occasionally bogged down in it's need to tie in historical moments of Lincoln's life.  While it might be fun to watch with friends and crack a few jokes to, don't make the mistake we did and have it follow 'Cabin In The Woods', which does a much better job at blending humor and gory mayhem.

As far as the actual product is concerned, the DVD is pretty standard fare.  It offers a little documentary about bringing the book to the screen as well as audio commentary if those things interest you.  Nothing terribly special really.  It was delivered quickly and in excellent condition for a reasonable price... so there's that.

I didn't care for the crazed, super-unhinged jaw vampire types in this movie, as well as some of the visuals were a little ridiculous.  There were some likable plot points, such as truth itself being a more powerful weapon than anything, but eh.",1353888000,,328,4.5423728813559325
4745535,3,B005LAIHZE,"Perhaps I expected too much because it was such an original (and exciting) idea, but the final product left me feeling kind of disappointed.  Some of the writing was okay, yet the plot as a whole made me feel as if I'd seen this before -- very stale and/or stupid (Vampires on the field at Gettysburg?  Really?).  My biggest problem with this movie was the special effects -- there was too much of them!  This movie would have worked much better as something dark and gritty, but this movie was way too overboard.  In short, it was an FX spectacle... many of which were of eye-rollingly poor quality.  The best FX are the ones you never see, but I guess nobody ever told this to the director.  This makes me think Timur was a poor choice for this project.  I know ""Wanted"" was cool, and he has done other things I liked.. Just not this one, particularly.  This was far too stylized and slick, with perfect, digitally-added blood splatters that felt wrong every time I saw them.  I suppose the concept was to turn a potentially dark Thriller into a bad Matrix clone.  Not awful, the idea alone is interesting enough for a view, but not great either.  This movie left me wanting much more from my Alternate History flick.",1353888000,,1219,4.490909090909091

Somewhat predictable regarding how his son died. But overall, good entertainment. I enjoy this better than any reality TV show!!",1353888000,,272,4.6875
4745565,4,B005LAIHZE,"The movie was decent. However, the hype didn't really fit the movie. At some points, it seemed more B-movie-ish and gore. When Ms. Lincoln was ""old"", the make-up was horrible.",1353888000,,175,4.866666666666666
4745566,5,B005LAIHZE,"When my husband proposed watching this on Amazon Instant Video, I admit I grumbled a little.  I grumbled even more at the beginning, which was quite violent and scary! Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful that these vampires don't twinkle in the sunlight or profess their undying love to young girls, but these vampires are SCARY!

Before long, though, I was completely engrossed in how history and fantasy were interwoven seemlessly.  Very engaging movie and perfect for a night home with your spouse (AFTER the little kids go to bed, of course :) )

Also, you will NOT regret ordering this on Amazon Instant Video....the HD quality was as nice as a blu-ray on our large tv.",1353888000,3,671,4.7094017094017095

I absolutely love the Amazon customer service though. The playback when I was watching it was really bad where I pretty much couldn't see some of what was going on when anything fast happened. I'm pretty layed back though and I only payed about $4 to rent it, so I didn't really even think about complaining. However I guess that someone at Amazon was monitoring how it was playing and the next day I received an email apologizing for the quality and saying that they were refunding my money.",1353888000,,660,4.462809917355372

This movie, while honestly mediocre, has refreshing moves in it. I found it to be bold in some way and relationship between characters surprisingly realistic and honest. I like that the epic, final battle was when Lincoln was already aged. But the fighting scenes are ridiculous :)))",1353801600,,423,5.3283582089552235

4745804,5,B005LAIHZE,"I bought this movie cautiously because of the various negative reviews.  Everything from unbelieveable CGI to 'unbelievable' plot, to 'it didn't match the book'. And of course, there were the HD and sound purists who had their say as well.

These people missed the point of this humorous, funny and horrific rewrite of American history. Put what you know on the side, put on your humorous hat and try to think of 'Sean of the Dead' meets 'President Lincoln'. It's not meant to be necessarily historically accurate, just a humorous, well-executed send-off of an absolutely great idea!  Who would have thought...Honest Abe slicing and dicing Zombies...oustanding!

And as far as the 3D Video and Audio, far better than what I had braced myself for. Instead of breakup and fragmentation, a beautiful 3D highdef pic with outstanding sound...very pleased!

The story goes full circle eventually ending where it starts. And you go, 'Ah' so that's what's going on there with a sense of knowing the characters. The portrayal of Lincoln was excellent and I highly recommend this Blu-ray 3D.",1353801600,,1081,5.050561797752809

Knowing full well that Grahame-Smith was also responsible for ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies,"" I read ""Abraham Lincoln"" with tongue firmly planted in cheek. He managed to blend with some skill actual historical facts with fantastical fiction. The movie itself, like most transcriptions from a literary source, pared down a LOT of the story in the interest of a clear and focused plotline. The characters are predictably superficial, the storyline absurd, and the final conflict replete with amazing effects and no shred of reality. And as long as you don't expect any more than that from this movie, you will love it, too.

It was more curiousity than anything else that made me finish reading it. The movie was more interesting than the book but I am glad I read the book first to understand what was happening in the movie. Seeing the main story woven into the historical events of the time was interesting. Although this is not the best movie I have ever seen I enjoyed it just for the entertainment value.

I like action movies and martial arts but  I'm not a vampire movie kinda gal. I do like cheesy movies and have always appreciated Abe Lincoln. On the other hand, I hate being scared and I especially hate effects that are absolutely impossible. Was this supposed to be like the ""true"" telling of a legend or an excuse to kill vampires? I also really hate it when someone has the super human power to hold a train tressel together while a train is going over it but gets injured in a fight. Let's be consistent here. Whatever. I'm not waiting any more time on this. If you feel like wasting a couple hours of your life, if you will have no peace until you see vampires die on your television at the hands of an American president, then watch this movie.",1353801600,,925,4.3468208092485545

It was almost weird, but kept me reading until the end. I was excited to see how the movie would play out and allude to the historical markers of Abe Lincoln's life, unfortunately, I was disappointed. It is just another vampire movie with scenes that are meant to scare the hell out of you instead of show the duality of what might have been Lincoln's other life.

4746474,4,B005LAIHZE,"Movie Review Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter (2012)
A movie that is great beyond its promise and premise.

The trailer for this movie left me stuck in the middle. We have an insane premise- that the 16th President of the United States did double duty as a monster killer and some wicked and slickly filmed chop chop action thrown in. Director Timur Bekmambetov, from the Night Watch and Day Watch movies, is no stranger to fangs in film. He channels his passion for all things dark and scary and then adds a pinch of Matrix (no surprise) and Brotherhood of the Wolf. The Brotherhood nod is for seeing early Americana mixed with Martial Arts.

It works. The movie succeeds- a huge credit goes to the serious handling of the iconic Abraham Lincoln character [played by Benjamin Walker] and the great lengths taken to capture the mid 1800s spirit. Writer Seth Grahame-Smith has layered a dark tale of vengeance around the most important issues of the time- slavery and the Civil War.

Vampire movies have always preyed and played with the idea of man verse monster. It's always been the choice between gaining enormous power and holding on to our fragile humanity. We parallel the struggle between the monstrous idea of slavery verse the inalienable rights of every man to be equal. Who would have guessed we'd tap such weighty subjects in a film about honest Abe obliterating bloodsuckers with an axe.

The fight scenes are a sight to behold and every element of film is used to enhance the action. We have great use of sound (albeit loud and obvious sometimes), slow motion and fast motion and even color takes an active role. We can see the obvious cooling and warming of shots, the isolation of colors, but the symbolism of color draining (like blood) is a marvelous touch. The visual respect for film matches the respect for the subject matter.

Throughout the movie, I kept thinking `They didn't have to go that far', but really- that pursuit of quality is what saves Vampire Killer from being a quickly forgotten b-movie. I believe they purposely walked the line of historical fiction and period piece drama as events in the movie closely follow history and Lincoln's personal story.

I liked it, I liked it, I liked it. This is one for the shelves even though every time I reach for it, I'll have to tell my company ""It's good, trust me, it's good."" Well done. I'm not a movie critic; I'm just critiquing a movie.",1353715200,2,2418,4.704491725768322
4746475,1,B005LAIHZE,this movie was the pits I know it was surpposed to be campy but it was flat and boring. I would avoid this one,1353715200,2,110,3.625
4746476,5,B005LAIHZE,It was an awesome movie. It kept my attention. It was very interesting. Great mixture of fiction and historical facts.,1353715200,,118,4.95
4746477,5,B005LAIHZE,"I was very impressed with how the writers intertwined the history of Abraham Lincoln, Civil War and the undead. Every actor/actress was very good!",1353715200,,146,5.125

4746479,2,B005LAIHZE,"Not what I expected. Sort of got bogged down in the political side of Abe, but the vampire action and cinematography were great!",1353715200,,128,4.608695652173913
4746480,5,B005LAIHZE,A fast-paced vampire hunter movie that is in no way meant to be taken seriously. Very easy to watch--not unreasonably gory--and best enjoyed with a group a friends.,1353715200,,164,4.892857142857143
4746481,4,B005LAIHZE,"good acting, good special effects. Original story. Only gave it a 4 because it seemed to be lacking something, like maybe a directors cut.",1353715200,,138,4.791666666666667
4746482,2,B005LAIHZE,"This one tried to bite off more than it could chew. Some clever points tied to historical events but overall it was just dumb. Special effects were weak at times and the story was way over cooked. It's a comic book, graphic novel deal that missed its audience.",1353715200,,260,4.4375
4746552,4,B005LAIHZE,"Sounds like a teen movie or something nonsensical. However, it was well produced and quite entertaining. I actually enjoyed this movie quite a bit and was expecting almost nothing. You never know sometimes the title throws you off.",1353715200,,231,5.105263157894737
4746553,3,B005LAIHZE,There seems to be too many vampire movies/books out there now days that we now have to make everyone into a vampire. Just watered down versions of the good stuff. I have to say more entertaining than Bella and Edward staring at each other for two hours. ;),1353715200,,256,4.354166666666667
4746554,5,B005LAIHZE,"The thing that really bothers me about most films is their lack of continuity, especially after they have completed the final cut.  Well, this one has continuity.  Movies are rarely always loved or hated by everyone.  There always seems to be some saving grace in the films that have been panned by the critics and things that fall short in even Oscar winners. It is personal taste.  This film has a lot of emotional aspects to satisfy the ""chick flick fans"" and an abundance of action to satisfy  ""horror and gore"" fans.  I enjoyed it and didn't fall asleep once.  I won't continue or reflect on the special effects, costumes, sound or photographic results, this has already been covered by previous reviewers.  When in doubt see it for yourself.",1353715200,,747,4.736434108527132
4746555,3,B005LAIHZE,"I don't much care for vampire movies but followed the hype on this one and was pleasantly surprised.  The blending of history certainly helped and this, as do many horror-type movies, has its over the top moments but all in all is a good watch.  I recommend it for those that share my tastes.",1353715200,,292,4.388888888888889
4746556,2,B005LAIHZE,My husband read the book and really wanted to see this. Glad we got it during Amazon's weekend sale because it wasn't that great. They tried to make every action scene look like the Matrix and the story was just so-so. Wouldn't recommend this.,1353715200,,243,4.545454545454546
4746557,5,B005LAIHZE,They obviuously did good research and blended the story flawlessly to historic events to make a very entertaining product. Well done.,1353715200,,133,5.380952380952381

4746560,2,B005LAIHZE,"When I was watching this movie, I felt like some one picked up the book, read the back, and thought, ""Hey, this would make a great movie."" They then summarized the back of the book for someone else, who wrote the screenplay based on that. The book was AMAZING, especially in how the author combined historical and fantasy. Abe Lincoln worked hard to get strong enough to fight vampires. There was none of this super-hero chopping trees with one swipe cause of his feeling crap. Read the book, skip the movie.",1353715200,,508,4.593406593406593
4746561,5,B005LAIHZE,"My husband and I just watched this with our kids (ages 18 & 21).  We love this movie!!  I wasn't sure what to expect Lincoln as a vampire hunter.  Is it going to be cheesy?  I am personally getting tired of vampires.  I heard it was a great book and my 21 year old son could not wait to see it.  I was shocked how good this movie is and they actually made it believable that Lincoln was a vampire hunter.  The actor who portrays Abe Lincoln, young and old, does an excellent job.  Dominic Cooper is amazing!  This movie has an excellent cast, great writing, direction and fast paced.  The stunt work is outstanding.  This movie is very entertaining and they do a great job with the special effects and make-up.  I was so impressed with the costumes, set designs and props.  I was shocked to see that it didn't do well at the box office.  I remember Conan O'Brien raving about this movie.  I wish I had seen this movie in the theater.  I highly recommend this movie!",1353715200,,965,4.277777777777778
4746662,3,B005LAIHZE,"The effects are good but just watching Abe as a vampire hunter is hard to believe and detracts from the movie.  I know, it's just a movie...but maybe a character other than Abe might have fit better.",1353715200,,199,4.378378378378378
4746663,3,B005LAIHZE,"It was the exact combination of silliness I expected. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't all that great either. Certainly worth the rental.",1353715200,,133,4.826086956521739

4746733,4,B005LAIHZE,It had good actors.  Abraham was pretty cool at getting vampires.  Lacked a little something but fight scenes were pretty good.  Some things in the movie you just knew were a stretch.  All in ask decent movie.,1353715200,,209,4.5675675675675675

4746736,4,B005LAIHZE,"You'll be disappointed. I was fully expecting to laugh at what I thought would be a ridiculous plot. Little did I know, I'd find a well written and acted story with just enough reality and history in it to keep you entertained and believable. The plot moves at a good clip so you'll not be bored. You have fact, fiction, action, romance, revenge, explosions, and a great fight scene. Everyone will be happy although under 13 not recommended as they may have nightmares and some parts can be a bit bloody and violent. I will add this movie to my library and will watch it again for sure.",1353628800,,586,4.435185185185185
4746737,1,B005LAIHZE,I can't even begin to describe how painful this movie was.  Spare yourself a lot of pain and watch something that isn't popular ONLY BECAUSE its the flavor of the week.  In the spirit of Twilight or Hunger Games this movie takes a great book and makes it suck.  And I mean REALLY suck.,1353628800,11,285,4.2407407407407405
4746738,4,B005LAIHZE,I admittedly did not know the story beforehand thinking that it was going to be more slapstick. I was expecting more humorous gore and more unnecessary nudity with the concept of the movie. I was pleasantly surprised that there was a great balance of story and violence (only brief nudity of a dead woman).,1353628800,,306,4.685185185185185
4746739,5,B005LAIHZE,"This movie was very imaginative. If you have a 3D TV you'll love the format of this film. You have to relax reality while watching this movie, but after awhile, things start to make sense.

4746852,5,B005LAIHZE,"I received the novel as a birthday present, and was skeptical, when first I checked out the title.  I read it, though, and was absolutely shocked at how good it was!  It was in no way disrespectful of our beloved 16th President, and it stayed true to history, as far as Abe's history is known, and I enjoyed every page of it.  Consequently, when I learned that a movie had been made of the novel, I was immediately interested.  I pre-ordered it, from Amazon, and waited.  When finally it was released, I couldn't wait to see it.  Well, the movie did not disappoint!!!  One added thing; my wife really liked it, too, and she's very hard to please.  I would unhesitatingly recommend this book to everyone.  The CGI is great, and the action is non-stop.  Plus, Rufus Sewell is a great bad guy.  'Nuf said!

Then we can pick a beloved historical figure and make them look ridiculous and self serving.  Last let's blame the proliferation of slavery on vampires needing a food supply and not on the plantation owners who didn't want to have to pay for labor.  How anyone could write such garbage is beyond me.

4747194,5,B005LAIHZE,"I don't know what I expected in a movie about one of our most beloved Presidents who happens to be a vampire hunter, but this was a pleasant surprise. It was a history lesson with a twist. Watching ""Abraham Hunter: Vampire Hunter"" was like seeing ""The Matrix"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" for the first time......a fascinating movie that was totally unexpected but greatly appreciated. I loved the way the writers wove bits of history (i.e., slavery, the death of his son, and the Civil War) with a possible premise that included slavery being beneficial for not only Southerners, but for vampires, seeing that they were using them for food. The movie literally shows the evolution of Abraham Lincoln from a young boy bent on revenge (vampires killed his mother) to a young man with political aspirations, into a man fighting to end slavery for several reasons, but none more important than preventing vampires for taking over the world. (Apparently slavery allows the vamps to feed without regard for the consequences). Regardless, as Lincoln's political career culminates in a presidency, we see Lincoln facing everything from the death of his son (again history with a twist) to betrayal by a friend. I definitely recommend this movie for those who love action, decent acting, great special effects and a movie soaked in history. After all, what could be better than an ""ax"" wielding President?",1353456000,,1387,5.008658008658009

4747197,2,B005LAIHZE,"Abe Lincoln as a Vampire Hunter is certainly an imaginative idea. The movie's execution of the concept is far different from the book's:

1. The movie is loosely focused on a plot and a super-vampire that does play a major role in the book.
2. The movie's characters are loosely based upon the book. However some key characters are omitted, others are new, and some key characters are entirely different in terms of what they do in the movie vs. the book
3. The surreal depiction and exploration of American History is 99% lost in the movie
4. The definining events in Abe and Henry's lives are completely different from the book.

Think of it in the following sense. Abe Lincoln was a legendary president...someone wrote a fantastic tale that he was also a vampire hunter...someone heard about the book (but didn't read it) and wrote a movie.

Seth Grahame-Smith's book incorporates a lot of real-life historical detail that not only adds depth to the story but really gives special meaning to all the vampire stuff. It's surprising that Grahame-Smith signed off on this movie, much less that he was responsible for the screenplay, because the story is hollowed out into a stylized action/horror movie that's pretty much what the title indicates, but nowhere near its potential, leaving it maybe a notch better than Sharktopus territory. Also, Benjamin Walker was really not good.

I guess if you just want to see Abe Lincoln fight vampires, go for it, but if you know better or want more, just stick to the book.",1353369600,,732,4.809523809523809

Decided to watch this on a whim while getting mindless tasks done around the house, and was pleasantly surprised.  I'm also not a huge fan of violence and though there was some gratuitous blood, it wasn't overly disturbing.  The premise, though far-fetched, weaved in enough real historical events to make me think, yeah, maybe.  Just don't tell my absolutely fabulous U.S. history teachers that.  Now I kind of wish I had read the book first, because I usually try to do that with books made into movies, but I just didn't think I'd be interested enough.  I might go back and try because it really is a creative story.

4747515,3,B005LAIHZE,"One look at the title tells you all you need to know. Abraham Lincoln is a vampire hunter. Based on a novel of the same title by Seth Grahame-Smith (author of a bestselling book ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies""), ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" is a vampire-hunting action flick with period costumes, that takes itself very seriously.

Benjamin Walker plays Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States by day, and a secret vampire hunter by night. Trained by mysterious Henry Sturges (Dominic Cooper), young Abraham Lincoln has become a formidable vampire killer with a silver axe. Lincoln then enters politics, and he meets and falls in love with Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead).

Produced by Tim Burton and directed by Timur Bekmambetov (""Night Watch"" ""Wanted""), ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" is visually impressive, to be certain, with the movie's over-the-top visual spectacle that is sometimes outlandish, even surreal, but the film lacks the playfulness that Angelina Jolie brought in the same director's ""Wanted."" The story is not very interesting. We don't know what the film's Lincoln wants to do; neither do we know what the enemy vampires are after. After all, why should we care?

""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" doesn't know what it wants to be. As dark fantasy, vampire action or so-called mash-up, the film is weak, with a story that feels rushed, and characters that are not very interesting.",1353369600,,1425,5.213973799126638

He grows up and seeks revenge, but ends up almost dying when he takes on the vampire who killed his mom. The guy that saves him also trains him by teaching him how to chop down a tree with his rage in one swipe. Later Abe discovers the guy who trained him is a vampire. It gets worse.

So, I checked it out and I must say I really enjoyed it. The story was interesting, the action sequences were pure eye candy , and the acting was better than most movies I have seen all year.

It's not your usual take on vampires, particularly their ability to adapt to daylight.  Despite some departures from traditional vampire lore it was well acted, and pretty well written; there were only a couple of awkward places that I noticed (like the dance scene with Abe and Mary).  The actor playing Lincoln is cute in his own plain way, the one playing Henry is hot, Mary Todd is pretty, and Rufus Sewell adds experience and name recognition (and his own good looks which have held up well since Dark City).  Honestly I'd rent this just for the horse stampede and the firey trestle scene sequences!

It becomes almost impossible for a movie, however, when the source material is as vast as this story.  That said Grahame-Smith does better than most in cutting the book (his own) down for the big screen, keeping in mind that the book was appealing (at least to me) because of the actual details of Lincolns life seen through the blood colored glasses of the vampire plot line, and that those grounding details which wove the far-out into the historical mostly got the axe (pun intended) ... and there is the rub.  The acting was fine, the special effects were good to great, but the story, which made the book worth reading, takes the full force of the adaptation in the neck and is at risk of becoming, at best just another vampire movie, and at worst a silly joke.

Genre: 8 Movie: 6

Become a fan of ""The Lowedown"" on Facebook

What's it about?
Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States, discovers vampires are planning to take over the United States. He makes it his mission to eliminate them.

What did I think?
This movie does to Vampire Films what Resident Evil did for Zombie films...it commercialized it.  I found it exciting and fun to watch, But it wasn't for the horror movie fan as much as the comic book or fantasy buff.

You kinda get the sense fairly quickly that the filmmakers fully understood that it was a terrible flick and still plowed ahead with a wink and a grin, inviting laughs at some pretty ridiculous plot points (like jumping from horse to horse during a stampede that just happens to be teetering at the edge of a cliff). Couldn't really tell if they were trying too hard to make it what they might have thought was awesome or if they didn't really give a damn how silly it was, but that ambiguity really adds to the entertainment value. Really could have done without some pretty gratuitous religious themes, but unfortunately that happens sometimes.

4748788,4,B005LAIHZE,"Alright, this is not a great movie. Look at the title. If you were expecting Citizen Kane, you'll be disappointed. This is a fine piece of entertainment though. A rather silly movie that proves to just be a fun watch. It's far from perfect and I certainly do have complaints. I think the movie takes itself too seriously. It could have probably used a bit more comedy as I found it impossible to take the plot as serious as the filmmakers seemed to.  I have not read the book on which this is based, so I do not know if there was a similar tone there, but I just felt that it could use a little more of a satirical touch. That said, it's still an entertaining if uneven movie.

The fight scenes in the movie range from somewhat ridiculous (the horseback fight) to extremely entertaining (the train). Some of the ideas seem pretty clever, and I particularly liked Abe's first fight with a vampire. All of the cast members do a decent to good job, with some performances actually being fairly effective.

Technical aspects: The blu-ray looks okay. Maybe I've been spoiled by really good looking movies recently (such as Brave) but this one seemed to be an average Blu-ray release. Better than DVD but not the film to show off your home theater system with. The 3D is acceptable, again not the best but there's nothing particularly wrong with it.

Special features are rather basic with a trailer, music video and documentary. The most interesting feature is probably the commentary with writer Grahame-Smith, who ranges from very interesting (discussing Lincoln's actual life as a sort of superhero origin story) to rather dull (just describing the events you see on screen). Rather a mixed bag there.

Would I recommend this movie? That would really depend. I found it entertaining, I had fun with it, but those looking for a movie with more comedy may be disappointed, as would film goers looking for an actually scary movie. This is just entertainment, not of the highest order, but an amusing diversion. If this sounds like something you would enjoy, you'll probably like it.",1352764800,,2077,4.726519337016574

The period dress by the actors appeared accurate to my knowledge and that fact that the vampires were the Confederates was most appropriate due to the historicity of the piece.

I was expecting more historical facts intermingled within the fiction. In the book, there are a lot more historical characters that Abe comes in contact with, who tie in to the whole ""vampire"" theme.

I didn't feel there was enough character development at all. Again, referring to the book, I missed learning more about Abe's childhood and how that played a role in what he was to become. (a vampire hunter)

4749378,4,B005LAIHZE,"My first encounter with one of the new ""paranormal speculative fiction"" historical novels was to screech to a halt in a bookstore and threaten to shout bloody murder. The very idea of Queen Victoria slaying werewolves or Abraham Lincoln taking after vampires offends my very historical-based sensibilities. Imagine my surprise therefore to take a chance on this big-screen adaptation of the novel and actually enjoy it.

What unfolds over two hours is a movie of more charm than I anticipated, particularly in its delightful depiction of the introduction and courtship of Abe and Mary. Immense changes were made from the novel, which disappoints book fans, but as someone who hasn't read the book, didn't prove problematic. Some of the action scenes are truly jaw-dropping, even if they go in for a touch of the macabre and absurd (one vampire hurtles a horse at Abe, who then promptly rides it in pursuit). The costuming is beautiful, as is the terrific cast, made up of little-known (and some, not so little known) actors. It's an interesting take on ""alternative history,"" with style.

Reading reviews, particularly from more conservative sources, I anticipated the film to be bloodier than it really was... either the black blood of vampires doesn't seem as gruesome as most R-rated action films or the stylized manner of shooting the piece diminishes it, because it didn't turn my stomach. It's true that there isn't much characterization, and it almost seems clichd to turn a champion of the enslaved into a vampire hunter (the metaphor is evident) but it's something different from what we've seen before, and it may (however indirectly) encourage audiences to read up on the real man, who was far more magnificent than this one, if not as downright cool.",1352505600,2,1762,5.030821917808219

It reminds me of a book turned into a movie, except there's no way they could put everything into the movie. I'm a bit of a history buff and I wanted to see more about before and after the Civil War. It also would have been more realistic if they'd included more about succession and the reasons behind it besides slavery but I don't think realistic was what they were shooting for.

4749696,4,B005LAIHZE,"Abraham Lincoln:Vampire Hunter(released June/12) stars Benjamin Walker as Abraham Lincoln,Dominic Cooper as Henry Sturges, Lincoln's mentor,Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Mary Todd Lincoln,Anthony Mackie as William Johnson,Jimmi Simpson as Joshua Speed,Rufus Sewell as Adam,Marton Csokas(Borias in Xena)as Jack Barts,and others. I found the film to be a seamless blend of both the historical and fantasy genres of film. It takes a look at the life of Abraham Lincoln,from boyhood to his ascendancy to the Presidential office. It takes some of the more well known moments of his life and blends the raison d'etre of those moments with the fanatsy genre,in this case,vampirism. Walker does a wonderful job as Lincoln, as does the make up team as he ages. Now the whole premise of Vampires and Lincoln of course hinges on the ability of the film's makers to make you believe that there could have been an actual connection. If it doesn't the film fails. I found it succeeded brilliantly and therefore had me right from the start.
The story starts with Lincoln as a young boy. His father works for a harsh plantation owner(Jack Barts)who is whipping a black man(one of his slaves),then turns on the slaves son. Young Abe,much to his fathers chagrin,intervenes to help his friend Willi Johnson,then so does his father,who halts the lashing. The owner is none too pleased,but gets his revenge. One night the owner sneaks into the Lincoln homestead,and as young Abe watches,he bites his mothers arm. It seems Barts was a vampire. The mother gets terminally sick and passes away. Nine years later so does Abe's father,and Abe is now on a mission to get revenge. He is in a bar,drinking up enough courage to finally confront Barts. He doesn't do well and has to be rescued by one Henry Sturges. Sturges himself was bitten years before by the progenitor of the vampires,called Adam,and follows them to work against them. Sturges vows to help Lincoln in his quest for revenge and trains him for many years,with Lincoln's choice of weaponry;an axe. Lincoln eventually leaves his home and travels to Illinois where he gets a job in a store run by a Joshua Speed. It is also here he meets up with the future Mrs. Lincoln,Mary Todd and his old friend Willi Johnson,who will become Abe's most valuable and steadfast assistant.
Abe,after so many years,finally gets his chance at taking out Barts,and finally succeeds. Learning of Abe's activities,Adam kidnaps Willi and brings him to his plantation in New Orleans. This of course lures Abe to come to the rescue. This he does,but with the help of Mr. Speed. Time moves forward and Lincoln has successfully become a lawyer and starts running for political office. Eventually his ideas for the abolition of slavery takes him all the way to the White House. His mentor warns that if he continues his quest regarding slavery,which is the vampires greatest source of food,that he will be in deep trouble. The Fort Sumter incident comes and the Civil War is on. Adam has thrown his entire contingent of vampires into the fight against the North. The War is not going well for Lincoln and come Gettysburg,the entire outcome hangs in the balance. Lincoln instigates a drive in Washington to confiscate everything made of silver,so that it can be melted down into bullets,bayonets and cannon balls.
A train speeds south from Washington and Lincoln and Willi are aboard. Adam himself,along with a contingent of many other vampires,raids the train in an effort to stop it. It is all for naught,as the train is just a decoy and Adam himself is killed by Abe. The silver laden weapons arrive for the Northern troops(on another train),and,as history would have it,they defeat the South. The film comes to its close as Abe and Mary are taking a carriage ride to the Ford Theatre.
The film has some spectacular moments and two that stand out are the climactic confrontation on the train,and the other,the horse stampede scene culminating in Barts death. Tremendously done. Once the film pulls you into its core premise,the actual historical moments do blend terrifically well with the vampire dynamic. Attention to historical detail is paramount in a film like this,and the makers deliver it in spades. From the period clothing to the look of Washington/the White House in the 1800s,it has it all. The inclusion of the Black plot line,also gives the film that much more credibility,from the inclusion of his lifelong friend Willi to the mention of slaves as food and its sparking of the war.
Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp in its original w/s a/r of 2:40:1. The only extra is a featurette on the films making.
All in all a solidly acted and skilfully blended mixture of the historical and the fatastical;a famous president's unknown but plausible connection to vampires. Well done. 4 solid stars..",1352246400,,4828,4.961728395061728

4749698,4,B005LAIHZE,"Anyone who goes into this film looking for logic, deep drama or lofty scriptwriting needs to go somewhere else.  For what this film is... a hybrid action/horror/fantasy/thriller flick with an absurd (but humorous and ingenious) historical twist... it's a fun ride.  If you think comic book/graphic novel, then you're thinking along the right lines, and you won't be disappointed.

To the people who feel the need to argue about how silly it is to have Lincoln jumping on horses, or vampires as Confederates etc, I ask, what were you expecting from a film with this title?  Realism?  Character development?  Logic?  It's no more ludicrous than Star Wars, E.T., Twilight, Lord of the Rings, etc.  So just sit back and enjoy this take on the subject.

And a final note... vampires have been done a million times, will be done a million times more, and the lore changes from film to film.  Some people get upset here that vampires can walk in the sunlight, or not kill other vampires, etc... and that's just nonsense.  There's no written commandments for what a vampire can/can't do, everyone's take is different.  And thankfully so.  Can you imagine every vampire film you've ever seen as having the exact same vampire lore?  It would have become tedious years ago.

I didn't feel compassion for the main characters - they seemed one dimensional - unreal. There was no emotional attachment/investment for the viewer with these characters. There was a LOT of slashing and blood flying etc. (much like a video game), and it left me cold and empty.

If you buy into the concept of the vampires, it was completely unrealistic that Abe could've killed so many of them with his silver edged axe/shotgun no matter how good his training/skill was.  The scene with Abe and the wild horse stampede fight with a vampire was extremely unrealistic - Abe should not have been able to survive that, much less put up the fight he did. They outnumbered him greatly and had superior strength and speed AND the ability to disappear at will. Not to mention they could've killed him easily in his sleep at any time.

Interesting idea, but not well thought out and not well executed. I didn't ""hate"" it, but it is NOT a movie I'd want to watch again, nor would I recommend it to anyone.  Ok, maybe some bored gamer teen/young adult males might like it - or those who enjoy blood flying. . .",1352073600,,1203,4.5

Vampires are real in 19th century America.  They tolerate sunlight and dominate the southern states.
As a boy, Lincoln sees one kill his mother.  An adult Lincoln bent on revenge is building courage in a bar.
A stranger speaks to him, saves his life on a botched kill and teaches him how to be a ""vampire slayer"".
The result is some astounding fights, excellent special effects and deeds of derring-do.
The finial is a train fight on the way to Gettysburg that might be worth the price of admission.

I've read a lot about Lincoln including a 45-hour book-on-tape on the Lincoln-Douglas debates. The brief scene with Steven Douglas is humorous. While nothing I've read would indicate Abe might have had a night job, he was known for being good with an ax (but not as good as in the movie). I watch ""True Blood"" and grew up on ""Dark Shadows"" so I like Vampire stuff. The whole Twilight thing makes me ill. This is much better, good action, good characters, good acting, good directing.

(Again, I saw this in the theater, where the visual effects are supposed to be the most stunning, and I felt like I was watching a D level made for TV movie on a big screen).

After we finished, we were both surprised at how much we enjoyed it!!  In fact, it's one of the better movies I've seen in a while.  Now, I have not read the book and I saw a couple of reviews on here that 1 starred it for not following the book word for word.  Not sure I agree with that, but to each his own.

About the movie:

The action sequences were amazing; the sets & costumes were excellent; the special effects were top notch; the story was quite good with great acting.  What more do you want in a movie?  The people who are going to like this movie are going to be those who enjoy action/graphic horror movies with great special effects.  If you are a 'Bridges Over Madison County' or 'Sex in the City' kind of person then this probably isn't for you!  In fact, if you are a man and can say you enjoy the 2 movies I just mentioned, you might want to think about having that surgical procedure to have your nads removed....  but I digress....

4750005,4,B005LAIHZE,"Let me start by saying that I love alternative history movies, and I love vampire movies.  This movie does not disappoint on either count.  The movie does a decent job of transforming historical events into an alternate history where slavery is an opportunity for vampires to have a steady supply of a food source (slaves).  The movie also credits the early victories by CSA armies to the fact that they had vampires fighting on their side.

The movie successfully turns a historical hero [Lincoln], and transforms him into a superhero vampire killer.

The movie also has exceptional production value, and has a particularly great action sequence where Lincoln jumps from horse to horse as the horses stampede away.

It is a good movie, and it is a fun movie (if you allow yourself to like it).  I would have given it more than 4 stars if they had taken more care to do character development.  The character development that they did accomplish seemed hurried and somewhat cliche.  Foe example, Abraham was motivated to both abolish slavery because of a close relationship with a slave boy, but they didn't do much to develop the relationship.  You are simply told that they are close, but they never demonstrate it.  Similarly, Lincoln is driven to kill vampires because one killed his mother, but the director does not spend enough time on the pain of the event and how that transforms him to this driven man.  Part of this may relate to the fact that the lead actor does not do a great job of bringing the emotional side of Lincoln to the forefront of the movie.",1351814400,2,1565,4.6923076923076925
4750006,5,B005LAIHZE,"Let's get one thing clear from the start:  You KNOW what the title of this movie is.  So, don't complain that the premise is ridiculous or that it's not historically accurate.  You knew that going into it.  But if you want a lot of vampire-slaying action, excitement and general fun, this movie is great.

4750007,3,B005LAIHZE,"Abraham Lincoln is one tough dude, according to the premise of this story.  It seems there is no shortage of vampire movies these days.  The public just cannot get enough of them.  Perhaps there is something about the vampire that is very attractive to people.  I have to admit that this is a most original vampire tale.  The story is wildly imaginative.  I mean, really.  President Abraham Lincoln as a hunter of vampires!  The plot is so outlandish that it actually does work.  But you do have to allow yourself to be won over by the story.  You have to buy into it and allow yourself to get immersed into that world.  It may be easier to think of it as an alternate reality.

Young Abraham's mother was killed by a man, who turns out to be a vampire.  Abe grows up, finds the man, and tries to kill him.  Were it not for the intervention of Henry, a seasoned vampire hunter, young Abe would not have survived that first encounter.  Henry, in Obi-Wan Kenobi fashion, proceeds to teach the young Lincoln all he will need to become a vampire killer.  Abe works a normal job during the day, studies for law school, and moonlights as a hunter at night.  Eventually, he enters the political arena and becomes president.  And it just so happens that the South is heavily populated by vampires, who take advantage of slavery to provide them with their meals.  Using slaves like livestock for slaughter allows them to survive without attracting too much attention.  Naturally, they would support Jefferson Davis and the Confederacy during the Civil War.

The special effects are terrific.  Production quality is very high.  This is a first-rate, high budget movie.  I highly recommend that you give this movie a chance.  Granted, it will not appeal to everyone.  Like I said, you have to be willing to be won over by the outlandish plot.

Watching the Raven and seeing John Cusack play Edgar Allan Poe made it a little easier to accept this film.  I guess it's fashionable to take actual historical figures, and put them in a fictional story like this.  Poe tracking down a serial killer in 19th century Baltimore.  Abe Lincoln hunting down vampires in the South during the years leading up to the Civil War!  Ok, what can we expect to see in the future?  Obama as a Klingon commander?  Bill Clinton as a Jedi master?  George W. Bush as a Time Lord?  I suppose this is all for the good, as long as it's done in good fun.  It can be fun to watch someone like Abe Lincoln as an action hero.  Just watch it for entertainment, get swept into the story, and you will enjoy the movie.  Take the plot too seriously and you will not enjoy it at all.",1351641600,2,2635,4.4926004228329806
4750008,3,B005LAIHZE,"Abraham Lincoln is portrayed in the film as having a secret identity as a vampire hunter. The story finds Abe set on a path of vengeance when he sees his mother killed by a Vampire. As he studies the law and tries to win the heart of Mary Todd by day, the nights find him seriously throwing down with an unending army of the undead. When he discovers the plot of a master vampire to conquer the United States, he makes the decision to take up a life of politics, as well. The rest, as we know it, is history.

Giving as I've read the book by Seth Grahame-Smith, I expected alot out of this film. Like the book, I expected the film to be played with all seriousness and, for the most part, it was. The movie, unfortunately, wasn't the same as the book(as we all know they rarely are). What's surprising to me is the fact that Smith wrote the screenplay for the movie. I'll admit, the film is well-acted and quite entertaining for a period film. The special effects are spectacular. However, just something about the movie didn't feel quite right to me. To be brutally honest, I enjoyed Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies alot more. Something about that movie seemed more feasible to me.

Don't get me wrong, this movie was well-made and I enjoyed watching it. As far as whether I thought it was an outstanding movie to watch...well, it was okay to me. I do recommend it, though.",1351641600,,1370,4.41106719367589

This movie has some great action scenes, especially the ones where Abe uses that famous cherry tree ax to take out vampires.

If you're looking to see a movie that is really very well written and keeps you engrossed from start to finish, definitely get this movie. Also, I did not purchase the HD version but regular Amazon instant video and the movie is still amazing!

It works especially well because it is played absolutely straight-faced but is obviously tongue in cheek!!  However, it is best viewed in 2D.

When I grew up we were taught about Abraham Lincoln in such a way as to believe he was the epitome of the most honest and strong leader we ever had in some of the most difficult times our country has ever endured.  The twist in this movie still portrays Abe in a similar light but also one in which he is one of the few humans who knows about vampires and one of the even fewer who is a vampire hunter/slayer.

The twist in the civil war is that it is not just a battle to free the slaves but to free them from the vampires who rule the south.  If the South wins we become a nation ruled by vampires and if the North wins we become a nation ruled by humans.  The special effects are good and the acting is not bad.  My wife is reading the book and she told me that the movie moves at the speed of light when compared to the book and it breezes over a lot of the issues.

I thought the characters were interesting and the movie moved at a good pace.

4750075,3,B005LAIHZE,"The film plays with an interesting metaphor: Southern plantation society/the American civil war and vampirism. The American civil war context fits well with the parameters of the Bram Stoker fantasy. A degenerate aristocracy who are ""dead"" maintain themselves off the living and create a system that cannot co-exist with a different one. There is alot in that idea that a good writer could mine out. But this isn't that kind of film. This film strictly plays it for exploitation value. Its a fairly stupid by the numbers action film that doesn't think much about anything.

The acting isn't bad. The sets and the period settings are better than I had any right to expect. But the writing is third-rate and the action scenes seem to be channeling ""the matrix"". Everyone is super-powered because apparently people become super-powered just through will. They also introduce silver metal (ala werewolves) as the kryptonite of the vampire set which is also kind of different. The only interesting thing from an action point of view is that this is the ultimate film about axe fighting.

For all its flaws, the film somewhat ends up better than it has any right to be. Its watchable. Beyond that, as absurd as everything is, everyone involved still seems to treat the material seriously (which is good). Its not a conventional horror film by any means. Its more along the lines of a heroic epic where the everyman rises up against injustice to change things. There is no better historical figure for that sort of tale than a Lincoln.

The truth. This will never go down as a work of art or a great movie, but it is fast moving, has good actors, nice special effects, good photography, lush period sets and costumes, and manages to do a pretty good job of marrying historical fact with fiction, fantasy, and the supernatural. This movie even manages to put Mary Todd Lincoln in a more favorable light while Abe Lincoln hunts down vampires with the finesse of Jean Claude Van Dam while delivering profoundly philosophical messages to a fractured nation.
If you have the capacity to suspend logic and go with the flow, you'll enjoy watching Abraham Lincoln keeping the nation free of those pesky vampires and Mary Todd doing more.

I am part of the MTV generation, so faster pace does keep me more interesting in a film, but this one I felt could have been slowed down a little bit. Not just that, but you go from Abe's childhood, to a young man to him being president very quickly, and it feels like something has been missed out on in-between... maybe someday a director cut will come out that gives the pace of the film a reasonable flow, but I felt this one just goes a bit too fast. The beginning and middle I didn't enjoy that much, but the final action scenes where done nice enough to keep me away from twiddling my thumbs and just enjoy the excitement.

At least two of the incredible special effects had me rewinding to see them again: the horse stampede and the train.  However, intelligent attention to detail and character development trumped the action, violence and gore in the long run, and there were some special ""sweet"" moments.

I have never read the book and have never even heard of it before until reading the reviews on here. I thought the story line of the movie was really good though. The actor that plays Abraham looks alot like him in my opinion, so that really added alot to the movie. There were a few nice twists in the story that keeps everything entertaining.

The plan was to purchase it on DVD, but before we did we looked at the overall impression from other people. When we saw that the movie only garnered 3 stars we decided it might be a better bet to rent first. I am very glad that we went with the rental. We were prepared for the slight deviations such as abbreviations, characters left out in the interest of time, etc. These things always seem to happen when a book is turned into a movie and can be a minor irritation if the finished product is good. However, this movie was a HUGE waste of time. There is almost no resemblance to the book. At times, we found ourselves wondering if the two were even connected. Aside from having a totally different story line, it was hard to follow and felt like some things were only thrown on the chance that they might make for good theater. The only reason we hung on to the end was because we paid for the rental.

The plot was just ridiculous(and I'm not talking about Abe hunting vampires). Every scene that wasn't just people standing around talking, and there were plenty of those, was insanely over the top cartoon style action and cgi. I spent half of the movie bored and the other half thinking ""I know this is a vampire flick but they're not even trying to make the plot half way believable"". I can't count the number of times that I was amazed at how bad the story and action scenes were.

Seriously, arming the union army with silver bullets, silver canon balls, and silver bayonets? It would only take a couple hundred tons of silver. Not to mention that they were fighting super strong and super fast creatures that could turn to smoke and move around invisibly. That's one of the dozens of retarded plot point.

I'd say this was the second worst vampire movie I've ever seen. Second only to Twilight which I was tricked into watching the first one because I didn't know what it was.",1351209600,5,1146,4.473684210526316

There's going to be a random dead body to prove how evil the Evil is. Abe loses fight because he's young and untrained. Here comes Mentor to save him at the last minute. Mentor will be a drunk and reprobate with nothing to live for until his protege shows up, the ONLY one on earth who can save the world and the mentor from himself. Cue Revelation.

4750526,5,B005LAIHZE,"This movie was quite well executed. Most of the negatives are from people who read the book and presumed it would be magically transformed into a movie on a one-to-one basis. The British have a word for such notions: Poppycock!  I am a big fan of co-star Dominic Cooper, who plays the son of Saddam Hussein in the movie THE DEVIL'S OWN (also highly recommended by yours truly!). He is a great actor and lends much to this movie as you will no doubt see. If you are a fan of HORROR and a fan of vampire movies, you will like this. If you have read the book and are able to divest yourself from loyalty to that work and view this as a stand-alone piece, you will admit that it is a roller-coaster ride of a great movie. It is, in the end, also a great BUDDY movie and love story. It is a patriotic story of a man who became a hero, who championed the cause of freedom and liberty.

The concept of a martial arts trained Lincoln, wielding his axe against blood-sucking monsters from hell is pretty unique. (Side note: I see there is already an Abe Lincoln Vs. Zombies movie out! Let's not get carried away! What's next: Washington Against Werewolves???)

There are some extremely intense moments. Some horrifying moments. Some great fight sequences and a lot of gore (though nothing too harsh or just plain disgusting).

Now, some belittle the movie as being historically inaccurate. I am no history major, but I am a student of both politics and war, and I did not see any glaring inaccuracies. Considering that this is not a History Channel documentary, I cannot fault the director for making ""adjustments"" to suit this work of fantasy/fiction. Good lord people. It's a vampire movie. It CANNOT, by that definition, be historically accurate. Clue: Vampires are not real. Sorry. I hope that didn't make people not want to see the movie. LOL!  Professional wrestling is not real either. 8-) FYI.

Abraham Lincoln was all about freedom, liberty and the ability of men to think for themselves. I therefore leave you with this: Go pop up the corn, get some chips and dip, grab an ice cold beverage (I prefer Pepsi!) and  E N J O Y  this very creative, spectacularly made movie experience. Don't forget the Milk Duds and Snickers!

All the elements of an action/horror film are here:  stunning special effects, outlandish kung-fu fights, breathtaking set pieces and a noble hero in Honest Abe.  It's impossible to resist the movie's lure in spite of its incredible storyline.
Benjamin Walker, looking like a young Liam Neeson (he ironically played a young Neeson in KINSEY), brings a naievete and sensitivity to his role of Lincoln.  Mary Elizabeth Winsted is a glowing Mary Todd Lincoln and Anthony Mackie is fine as Lincoln's childhood friend.  Rufus Sewell is evil incarnate as the head vampire.  Only Dominic Cooper as Abe's mentor seems ineffective in a one-note performance.

4750530,4,B005LAIHZE,"First I want to address all the people complaining the film is nothing like the book. This may be the case but seeing as how the film's screenplay was written by the author of the book, Seth Grahame-Smith. As a matter of fact he is featured throughout the special features and has the only commentary on the movie. So fans of the book that are upset with the film can go take it up with the author who changed everything.

Now that I've said that let me get on to the movie. It was a lot of fun. We so often get watered down, PG-13 bloodless horro flicks. Here we get a full on R rated, violent vampire action flick in the same tone as Blade, but as a period piece. And I must say Benjamin Walker swings a mean axe! I really enjoyed the cast, including Anthony Mackie and Rufus Sewel. The action is visceral and filmed in a way where it's not all about the crazy editing though that's there. I never expected a hsitory lesson from this but I thoroughly enjoyed it for what it was.

Also as a quick note, on Blu-Ray there is a motion comic called the Encounter that is awesome. it's the story of Elizabeth Batheroy as told by one Edgar Allen Poe to his good friend Abe Lincoln.

If you like action movies, or vampires, or all of the above you should enjoy this flick. If you're into alrenate history and such, you should check this out.

I did not get the chance to see it in theaters, regrettably. Needless to say, I was eagerly anticipating it to be released on video, especially since I have a 3D HDTV. As with all 3D movies, I'm always skeptical if the 3D will be believable or just a cheap ""add-on."" Also, I'm always weary of purchasing a movie without watching it first, for fear of disappointment. So, I was going out on a wide limb to buy this one.

Being only a fan of the book, I set the bar very high, and the producers took that bar and slammed it through the ceiling with style. Was it ""exactly"" like the book? No. Was that disappointing? No. Frankly, I was not sure how the makers would be able to fit all of the content into a movie that was shy of the 120 minute mark.

The result was an outstanding success. The reviews of this movie are up and down, for both fans of the book and non-readers alike. This made me uneasy to ""waste my time"" with it. Bottom line, be your own critic. If you read the book, and loved it as I did, you are doing yourself a disservice by not watching the movie adaptation.

The actors were excellent. The plot was true to the book. The locales and costumes were superb. The action was spot-on. The visual effects were just right. The 3D was amazing: the movie is meant to be enjoyed in 3D. Dust particles float before your eyes. Splinters fly past the screen. Depth adds so much to the scenery and backdrops. The story is great.

4750751,4,B005LAIHZE,"Here is a fact which to this day is strange
The original tomb was in constant need of repair and deteriorated significantly due to construction on unsuitable soil. In 1900, a complete reconstruction of Lincoln's tomb was undertaken, and the Lincolns' remains were exhumed, before Lincoln was finally placed back in the white marble sarcophagus that Mullen and Hughes had opened so easily in 1876.[8] In April 25, 1901, upon completion of the reconstruction, Robert Todd Lincoln visited the tomb. He was unhappy with the disposition of his father's remains and decided that it was necessary to build a permanent crypt for his father. Lincoln's coffin would be placed in a steel cage 10 feet (3.0 m) deep and encased in concrete in the floor of the tomb. On September 26, 1901, Lincoln's body was exhumed so that it could be re-interred in the newly built crypt. However, those present (a total of 23 people) feared that his body might have been stolen in the intervening years, so they decided to open the coffin and check.[10]

[edit] Last viewing

It was said that a harsh choking smell arose when the casket was opened. Lincoln was perfectly recognizable, even more than thirty years after his death. His face was a bronze color from the gunshot wound that shattered the bones in his face and damaged the tissue. The color was unhealed bruises. His hair, beard and mole were all perfectly preserved although his eyebrows were gone. His suit was covered with a yellow mold and his gloves had rotted on his hands. On his chest, they could see some bits of red fabric -- remnants of the American flag with which he was buried, which had by then disintegrated. It was theorized that Lincoln had been embalmed so many times on board his funeral train that he had been practically mummified",1351036800,2,1786,4.758064516129032

Buy these 3D movies because I like 3D a lot. Have the latest 3D TV and 3D Blu-Ray player with the latest patches.

Fact or fiction? Who cares. The news is such a lie that maybe they were covering up vampires in the days of Mathew Brady's reportage...
But now through gutsy journalism 150 years later they are revealing the truth. Who knows the World Trade Center lie may be cleared up starting with 9/11 is 911 the police emergency telephone number and what a hoax the telephone company and TV are in the year 2160.

As far as 3D is concerned, the picture was pretty depth oriented a good deal of the time. Abraham Lincoln etc, lacked, regretfully, 3D in your face in many instances.

I want ViewMaster 3D. I want pop up story book 3D. Spent a lot on equipment to have my 3D.

The biggest surprise for me, after seeing it in the theater in 2D, was the 3D.  Wow!  Definitely some of the best 3D effects I have seen in a film.  More than just perceived depth, there were a lot of things in the foreground - smoke, dust, flying embers, tree branches, grass...and of course from time to time, blood.  The 3D really was not only impressive, but well - used...truly added a new dimension to the film.

Give this movie a chance! Sit down with a bowl of popcorn, plug in this movie and enjoy the ride! You will like it. It may be about vampires but I did not find it scary if that is a concern.",1350950400,,541,4.161904761904762
4750757,2,B005LAIHZE,"This is simply an awful spectacle.  Historically, Lincoln has little resemblance to this infantile character (e.g. Lincoln did not support emancipation until the very end and only as a means to finally end the war.  Slavery was not an issue that was ""dear to his heart."" In fact, he punished the ""anti-slavery crowd"" severely when they broke the law and was in favor of runaway slaves being returned to their owners).  This vampire hunter spends most of the screen time ranting anti-slavery slogans as if he were John Brown while whipping an ax around like a bad kung fu movie hero and all the while questioning whether or not he should hold hands with Mary Todd.  There is no suspense in this lifeless, dull, and wandering piece of drivel.  There is nothing remotely scary about the movie.  The vampires are dull and stereotypical.  They have huge teeth and the effect has been seen previously in numerous films. They seem impotent for the most part and are too easily killed (Lincoln single handily dispatches with about 8 of the them at once!) The BIG SCENE in which Lincoln jumps from horse to horse during a stampede while he attempts to chop up a really bad vampire is silly.  It gives a bad name to CGI.  Save your time and money.  If you want a good vampire movie try 30 Days of Night.  It is a good scare (at least until the Hollywood ending).",1350950400,,1352,4.545454545454546

4750809,1,B005LAIHZE,"I am so disappointed. I read the book and loved it. My hopes were high going into the movie. I was even willing to accept some changes and less depth. Unfortunately, ALL the depth is gone, sacrificed for action scenes. Good luck figuring out what is going on beyond the superficial action. They even change the flavor of the book, adding characters that didn't exsist, to make it more racially motivated. What a waste.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
OK, I wanted to like this movie, really, really, wanted to, so I watched it a second time. Unfortunately, it reinforced what I originally thought. I don't even know where they got some of this stuff. The book was amazing. Just follow it and you have a hit that you KNOW people like. Here they lobotomized it and put in a bunch of ridiculous CGI and action shots. I think that using him for AL:VH was a huge mistake. As I watched the film for the second time I became more and more angry at the director. I don't think he read the book at all, just took the title and made up his own garbage. He should have used some of the budget for colon cleansing, to clear his mind of feces. Actually, maybe he did spend the money on enemas and such. It is not evident in the shabby CGI that would have looked bad in the 1990's, or the practical makeup, which is SO BAD I actually thought Abe's fake beard was going to peel off. Abe when he is older looks like a pig in a hat; its that bad. Hopefully the next time this bozo is considered as a film director the studio will pick a human instead.

I had a hard time believing the same author who wrote such an awesome book wrote this crummy screenplay. It even left out Abe's assassination and the twist at the end of the book.

After the movie was over, I was convinced that I had read and watched two totally different stories.
On the movie's merits alone, the plot was uneven (mind numbingly slow at some parts, too quick at others), the actual dialogue was crap made crappier by poor acting and worse directing, the action scenes were boring, including the big action scene toward the end which my friend had to nudge me awake to witness, then fell back to dozing until the end credits.

Perhaps it's a childhood indoctrinated with respect for a president during our most trying years as a country but I was unable to slip into that zone of acceptance where I enjoy science fiction or horror or for that matter 98% of films.

4750877,3,B005LAIHZE,"If we are to believe half of the things that we learn about Abe Lincoln from this new movie, he was a far greater man than we give him credit for. I'm not even talking about slaying vampires, though good work on that ol' Abe, keeping America safe for democracy from vamps and all. But how about chopping down a tree with one sing of an axe, defying gravity while ridding piggyback on an old stead, okay a magnificent stallion. I guess what I'm saying is, this movie requires a whole four scores and then some suspension of disbelief. If you can do such, it's a not too bad, but hardly memorable addition to the over crowded sub-genre of vampire flicks.

Coming from Russian born director Timur Bekmauketov, who has directed the equally facile, but stylish Wanted and the Night/Day Watch movies. His stuff looks good, no question, he keeps the camera moving and the action always on the go, but it never adds up to anything of substance. Based on a graphic novel of the same name by Seth Grahame-Smith, who also wrote the muddled script. Everything has a cartoonish look and feel, the CGI vamps most of all, so there are no scares and little atmosphere. Highlighted by so astonishing action set pieces in the third act, especially the showdown upon a fast moving train.

Benjamin Walker makes a passable Lincoln, though one would suspect the real honest Abe had to have been charismatic to reach the political heights that he did. Given a truly superb make-up job, there are forty-five people credit with the various make-up and hair styles, etc used to successfully turn Walker into an unmistakable Abraham Lincoln. The supporting cast is especially strong with good work coming from Rufus Sewell and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as the picture's main villian and Mary Todd, respectably, but the real scene stealer is Dominic Cooper, the English actor so good last year in the criminally underrated the Devil's Double, here playing Abe's partner in vampire staking with a secret agenda all his own.

In all, I can be said that Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, is nothing special and hardly a must see. However, there is an audience prime and waiting for this kind of movie. And as it is, it is a pretty fun mindless, but utterly forgettable film. At least on DVD/blu-ray you can avoid the awful 3-D that I saw it in when I went to the multiplex.

Please be aware that you are not going to get a historically accurate depiction of Lincoln in this movie, but instead a movie that is full of great visual effects that will kee you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end!

I swear I'm tired of movies that only one sex can watch. Back in the day action movies were enjoyed by men and women now we get crap like this and women are just thrilled about it.

By the way horrible all around, directing, plot, acting, fight scenes. I recall girl cousin bragging how there were 2 guys fighting literally on each other. Ick.

The key feature of the novel, what caused it to receive so much acclaim, was not the vampires but that it was so well grounded in the historical data we already know about Lincoln.  So well done in fact that, if one were to entertain the existence of vampires, it could have easily been a feasible account of what happened.  Like a conspiracy that was hidden from us all these years

To the films credit it tries to retain the overall serious tone of the book, but is filled with so many awkward historical inaccuracies the audience can't help but laugh.  The cinematography is well shot and pleasing to the eye, but not enough to distract you from the abysmal plot and horrible acting.  It's a fine example of Hollywood's tendency to be melodramatic and over the top, but even if you're looking for a ""so bad it's funny"" film I suggest you look elsewhere

It truly has a nightmarish quality about and that is the one lingering after effect of this strange film. Many parts of this film come off rather camp and history is reduced to a very minimalist artistic form of art, yet these very aspects of the film add to its strange and unsettling effect on the viewer. At times the film reassembles a very low budget television mini-series while at others it looks like a widescreen extravaganza. I saw the film in both the standard flat-screen presentation and the very impressive and technically astounding 3-D version. The film has a strange curiously voyeuristic quality about it. The almost bleached out colors, slow motion shots and digital editing, baroque costume designs and haunting set decorations and designs bolster these. The overall premise of the film is quite ludicrous, but it always takes itself quite seriously.

A little hope was restored when I saw that Timur Bekmambetov was directing and that Tim Burton was producing...I am a long time fan of Tim Burton, and I very much enjoyed Timur's movies Wanted and 9.  There were other bigger movies around that time that I was wanting to see in the theater, so I decided I'd compromise anad wait & see this at a local dollar theater instead, which I finally got around to doing.

Though I think a couple of things were over done and there were a couple of kinda cheesy parts, I must admit that this movie was actually better than I had expected it to be...a great blending of history and fantasy/horror!  The characters were, for the most part, pretty believable.  The special effects were overall pretty well done, spare maybe a couple of parts, and the concept was actually pretty neat.  I do understand that this movie was based off the book of the same name by Seth Grahamme-Smith, and it makes me hopeful that maybe they'll actually make a movie based off his other popular book Pride Prejudice and Zombies...and I'm not even a Pride and Prejudice kind of person, though I do love zombie films.

In any case, if you've enjoyed any of Timur Bekmambetov & Tim Burton's movies in the past, I would highly suggest checking this movie out, because it was honestly pretty good...not, I would say, my absolute favorite movie of the summer, but still pretty dang entertaining.

4751143,1,B005LAIHZE,"When I saw this movie I thought it was ok, not perfect. Unfortunately I made the mistake of not reading the book before seeing the movie. I made this mistake three times in my life including this film. The other films were The Hunger Games and Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World. Anway here are my main complaints:

The plot is basically simple, Abe becomes a vampire hunter and keeps it a secret. I thought they director did a good job of mixing what really happened to Abe and the fiction. The only compliant is that the book does a better job and shows more research of Abe's real life. In the book the author used a good number of real moments in Abe's life and threw in vampires. In the film there were only two scenarios that were fact and involved vampires. As the film progresses it becomes obvious that a majority of the film was fictitious and had nothing to do with the real Abe Lincoln.

Another complaint was character and event accuracy. Abe had four sons in real life and lost two of them to illness. In the book the culprit is vampires for fictitious purposes, while in the film he had only one son who was killed by a vampire. To me I saw this a sign that the director was going to warp the real Lincoln's life wihen he had the facts before filming. Also another complaint I have that I will never forget was Mary Elizabeth Winsted's acting of Mary Todd/Lincoln. When I saw her in the film she had just as much white make-up on her face just like she did when she performed as Ramona Flowers in Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World. She also didn't act bipolar in anyway like the real Mary Todd did when she was married to Abe. Honest to God I felt the director wanted Mary in the film for publicity also if Snow White was a brunette Mary Elizabeth Winsted as Mary Todd would fit the description.

Final issue was action sequences, don't get me wrong it's really hard to come up with better effects but I've seen some the effects in the film used before. I felt that some of the effects were ripped off from the new Sherlock Holmes films. I honestly felt that I was watching another Sherlock Holmes movie.

Overall, the movie's ok but it's not perfect. Watch at you're own risk and hope to God that you enjoys this film better than I did.",1345593600,11,2239,4.311163895486936
4751144,5,B005LAIHZE,"What an understated film this is. Upon the trailers and name I could understand how some would easily dismiss this film, but fans of quality fantasy, action, horror and history should take note. I will add that I went with my Mom who is not a fan of gore and horror and she thought the film was great as well and not what she had expected from the trailers. She is also an elementary school teacher and found the retelling of historical events of Lincoln done in a very entertaining light.
The title character is played to perfection by Mettle Streep's son-in-law who is an extremely well trained actor. I look forward to seeing him in another film. The acting all around is quite good and has a touch of tongue in cheek and slight camp. Yet the actors do such a stellar job and the films production values is also top notch that I was cheering along through this film and was sad to see it end.
As for the premise of the story (without too much spoilers) is the young childhood of Abe Lincoln to young man, to falling in love, to becoming President and father, to his tragic death. It shows of Lincoln's battle to end slavery in our nation which is being orchestrated by vampires in the South to keep in bondage and as a source of blood supply. A nice an interesting symbol as monsters who oppressed the Black nation. But as in all things not everything that may appear as evil is not always completely true. Especially when Lincoln is being trained for combat by a renegade vampire who wants to abolish vampires and help Lincoln avenge the murder of his mother that occurred when Lincoln was a boy.
Truly this film is a great history teaching tool in some ways. And really is appropriate for 13 years old and up. It has mild language with one or two uses of the f bomb. So not too bad. Violent yes, but not extreme but in a more over the top camp way which in essence feels like comic book violence. The film is engaging, funny on purpose, entertaining and truly comments on what a great man our 16th President was...and makes him an action hero for the new age. Highly recommend and the 3D was well fitted.",1345507200,,2109,4.368956743002545
4751145,4,B005LAIHZE,"Director Timur Bekmambetov is a veteran of exaggerated action and genre-splitting fang flicks, having directed Night Watch (2004), Day Watch (2006) and Wanted (2008).  In addition to some of those he has produced The Darkest Hour (2011), Apollo 18 (2011) and the possible Wanted 2 (????).  He picks weird projects and visually supplements them in unexpected and often impressive (though also often ridiculous) ways.  He's a creative guy and, in general, I'm pleased with his work--including his latest: Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter.

Our story begins by weaving motive.  Young Abraham witnesses the death of his mother at the hand of a vampire.  From that day into adulthood, Abraham (Benjamin Walker in his first major role and looking like a young Liam Neeson) seeks revenge against that vampire, but hates them all.

Honest Abe is trained by Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper), who is as un-Yoda-like as it gets complete with rigid rules, a temper and a penchant for exterminating all vampires.  One must wonder why.  Of course, there's a story there, the explanation of which would spoil the movie.  He is backed by his best friend Will Johnson (Anthony Mackie), a freeborn black man who has some unexplained skill for martial arts (in a time when it was generally unknown to the West) and axe-spinning (even though he lacked Sturgess' Jedi tutelage).

Abe marries Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), with whom he shares a life veiled from the truth behind his night life and political ambitions.  In fact, this is where knowing some simple history gets fun.  You'll grin as you see political campaigns and war tactics steered by anti-vampire stratagem.

Our vampiric antagonist is effectively portrayed by professional villain Rufus Sewell.  As Adam, the 5000-year old maker of all vampires, Sewell is cold and enjoyably hatable.  He leads the Confederate vampires of the South in their invasion of the North in the Civil War.  His personal cadre enjoys the bedazzling company of Vadoma (played by newcomer/model Erin Wasson, who already looked rather vampy before doing this movie).  She plays her simple part well and I hope to see more of her in more challenging roles.

The movie ends with a brief present day scene which smacks of Interview with a Vampire's ""I'm going to give you the choice that I never had.""  An endearing nod, but not without a little eye-rolling to accompany my acknowledgement--not that this was the only time in the movie when that happened.

THE SETS:  Now, I only noticed this because I always ask myself ""now how do I feel about the cinematography and set design""--but I was largely unimpressed with both (excluding some action sequence work, though).  Had I not been looking for it, I might not have noticed most of the time.  The scenes were still effective and I don't think too many people will wish they got more from this department unless, again like me, they specifically look for it.

To be, or not to be, in 3D:  I saw this in 3D, and it wasn't until the second act action scenes that I sensed that this might have been filmed in 3D.  There was just something about the first act's movement, zooming and background that felt a bit untidily modified-from-2D-to-3D.  As it turns out, I saw the HBO making of special and noticed the same stale, artificial focus and contrast during zooming in 2D.  However, once the second act action begins, you see that the action was clearly made (and well made) for 3D.  It's just that the 3D felt like a natural improvement for some scenes, but actually obscured trademark scenes like the one-swing-tree-splitting when compared to HBO's (and the TV trailer's) much crisper 2D presentation.  One scene really didn't fit in 2D or 3D, and that's the ""stampede fight.""  When you see this, everything is so obscured by choppy focus and lazy-hazy blurred CGI that you wonder if they ran out of budget and then realized ""Hey guys, we still need to do the Stampede Fight.""
My final decision: I'd vote to see this in 3D.

THE ACTION:  After witnessing his tree-splitting training and some impressive axe-spinning flair I'm reminded of Ray Parks' work as the headless horseman (Sleepy Hollow) and Darth Maul (The Phantom Menace).  The action starts somewhere in the middle; it's very blood-letty, fast-paced and entertaining, but also filmed very close up such that you see very little.  So I was quite entertained while also wishing it was done differently.  But during this first act of the movie the events, build-up and consequence were more important than the fights themselves.  Whereas in the second act elaborately choreographed and CGI-enhanced scenes spew gore, sever limbs, and add complex acrobatics from a wide angle allowing full realization of intricate marriages between combat choreographers and CGI engineers.  The sets were more open, much as were for many of Neo's fights in the 2nd and 3rd Matrix movies, which allowed more freedom in planning grandiose maneuvers with more combatants.  There's even a healthy dash of post-impact slo-mo (a la 300 or The Immortals) as caped bodies and weapons corkscrew through the air about trailing cascades of black blood.  Very well done indeed.  The action shifts gears yet again for the third act (with a more aged Lincoln) and include a Western-style train action sequence and Civil War battle scenes.  There's a good deal of unrealistic skill and precision which hemorrhages absurdity this flick, but I found myself not minding a bit despite some playful Oh-come-ons.

THE STORY:  This movie succeeded where many failed in utilizing a multi-story-style 3-act model.  What do I mean?  I mean The Brotherhood of the Wolf model.  Each act of The Brotherhood of the Wolf felt like a different movie--it began with a period piece mystery, shifted to a large-scale action-driven phase, and then finished as a somewhat supernatural revenge flick, any one of which could have been its own stand-alone film.  Movies that try to do too much (like this) often fail.  In Abraham Lincoln we have a plotty origin story, followed by a more typical vampire hunter choreography-driven flick, and ended with an aged Abe and a politico-military historical piece where period mattered and fights took place in less martial arts-friendly venues.  Again, any one of these parts could have been the vampire-gnawed blood and guts of a whole separate movie.

While on paper, the concept must sound like it skirts lunacy, this exercise in absurd fantasy-horror-war-history hybridization comes off as a great summer action flick.  You'll be surprised at how seriously you'll take it--as if hypnotized by some True Blood glamour.  So I say see it.  Be glamoured and dazzled.  Enjoy.",1345334400,85,6688,4.991869918699187

Even taking the story from the book out of my mind and just rating the movie on its own merits, it remains awful.

4751250,3,B005LAIHZE,"May contain spoilers.

I like to think I can appreciate a premise so far removed from reality as this, and certainly the filmmaker's and writers had a choice.  Do we play this up with a bit of campy humor or go with the serious-play-it-straight direction.  They chose the latter.  As a boy, young Abe sees his mother slain by a vampire and vows revenge.  Years later as a young man (Benjamin Walker), he is schooled by  a mysterious stranger (Dominic Cooper) in the art of killing vampires.  Abe's weapon of choice is a silver laden ax, because he has some experience splitting rails.  Abe becomes quite adept to the point of spinning that ax like a cheerleader's baton.

Interwoven during his vampire removal time in Springfield, Illinois he meets his wife Mary (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), gets elected to Congress and eventually the presidency.  In a career defining period of the Civil War, Lincoln learns that the vampires are siding with the Confederates because the slaves are nourishment for the vampires.  In a terrific scene he confounds the vampire leader, Adam (Rufus Sewell) boarding a train full of silver that will be used to arm the Union soldiers.  It's all misdirection, easily spotted but the confrontation on the train is well done.  Director Timur Bekmambetov has some experience dealing with vampires with ""Day Watch"" and ""Night Watch"" both rather leisurely paced thrillers.  I think a less serious tone might have helped with this film.  At least a few Bond-like quips to lighten the surroundings.",1344729600,,1518,4.944664031620554

4751253,5,B005LAIHZE,"Hovering half-way between being serious and being funny--and enjoying every minute of its crazy balancing act--this is a great movie.  A real movie.

Given the rarity of good films made in Hollywood these days, I had no reasonable expectations, statistically, for a good film here. So I went into the cinema and hoped for the best, but expected nothing.

Imagine my surprise when I found that ""Abe Lincoln"" is 1. a well-acted period film with great sets and costumes, 2. a wildly paced action special effects feast, 3. an effectively witty self-satirical historical rewrite and 4. a gruesomely graphic horror flick!  I don't see this as a perfect film--it's got flaws.  But the handful of flaws that bother me, I can ignore, because this is a film made with a joyous spirit, and the overall structure works well.  I've seen this five times in the theatre at this point. I haven't seen a film that many times theatrically in over twenty years!  I had read the book and enjoyed it, but had no idea what the film version might be like.  As has been noted elsewhere, the book and the movie are two completely different things: The book delivers a more intellectual experience, and the film delivers a more emotional experience.  Writer Seth Grahame-Smith has tailored his book into something simpler and less grim for the screen.  I think the decision to make the film a fun action movie was a smart one.  It's a wild ride.

History is transformed into mythic fantasy in this yarn detailing the never-before-told story of Lincoln's lifelong battles with supernatural evil. Indeed, the opening words of narration, ""History prefers legends to men,"" express the awareness that events are altered in retrospection, to suit our thirst for myth, for purity of rights and wrongs. But the ""rewrite"" that ensues shows us the maddest symbolic extremes.  Is this a commentary about America's changing self-image? An indictment of our entertainment culture's increasing obsession with simplistic heroes, loud noises and glorified bloodshed? A condemnation that is strangely exemplary of the problem?  Without winking, this film makes many sly jabs at the ""typical,"" common-denominator, American action film.

It's simultaneously silly and profoundly moving--a film so strange that many scratch their heads, but in time, I think, it will come to be regarded as a classic of genre cinema.  In this searing mixture of the real and the unreal, we witness scenes of outlandish fantasy as well as scenes of a young nation being shaped through moral and political conflict. A wide spectrum of emotions is expressed. Sweeping vistas, vital romance, epic battles: It might reasonably be said that this is the ""Gone with the Wind"" of vampire films.  There is an ecstasy of absurdity.  It's fun because it's just plain crazy, but in an expensive, lavish, eloquent, opulent way.

Yes, like ""Sleepy Hollow"" before it, this one brings back memories of the Hammer classic horror films, which, though violent, were elegant and refined, with beautifully written dialogue.  It's a really refreshing change from the crudity and brutal excesses seen in horror films of recent years.  This one goes down smooth.

The humor here is pretty subtle, most of the time. This film suggests to the viewer that one of America's greatest Presidents was actually also a fearsome, axe-swinging, monster-slaughtering badass. The story of how all this came to be is lovingly presented as the most serious thing in the world, despite its patent ridiculousness. This ""straight-faced"" approach is really the key to the humor, and achieves a smart, sophisticated effect.

The Civil War-era story links the intended secession of the Southern states with the rise to power of vampires in those states; so vampirism becomes a metaphor for slavery and man's general inhumanity to himself. The typical horror film focuses on primal fears, and never on issues of morality; so while largely a horror film, this seeks to turn some basic principles of the horror film sideways. The meddling does not stop there. It is true that the story treats its history elements as ""flexible material"" to be modified as necessary for storytelling purposes (is this unexpected for a film with a title like ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter""?). But it is also true that the audience needs to be familiar with the American Civil War, Lincoln, Harriet Tubman, and various other historical personages, in order to comprehend the story and get the jokes. Perhaps it's a sad thing, but whimsical fantasies featuring historical figures (like this film, and the first ""Bill and Ted"" film) are most useful in this day and age for acquainting audiences with these figures in the first place.  Inaccurate?  Sure.  But it's still comprehensible only to literate audiences.

The film is a creative entity--and, like some of my favorite satire-comedies, seeks to go vigorously against the grain of convention, so audience members expecting the normal ""action film product"" are likely to be confused (and when I watched it in theatres, a good many viewers were certainly confused!). ""Abe Lincoln"" thinks outside the box and then axe-murders the box.  If you happen to be inside the box, well, you are in trouble.  But sharp viewers who get the joke are rewarded with a stimulating experience.

While serving up gaggles of vicious monsters, it unfolds an old-school ""birth of the hero"" story that recalls the tone of earlier Technicolor Hollywood epics and historical biopics. ""Abe Lincoln"" delivers much, much more than the basic requirements. This is a popcorn film of a higher order.

Many laughs, scares, and thrilling moments. Yeah. I loved it.

4751255,3,B005LAIHZE,"I guess we owe Abraham Lincoln twin salvos of thanks, for ridding the nation of slavery... and for killing vampires. ABRAHAM LINCOLN, VAMPIRE HUNTER, I think, would've hugely benefited from a more tongue-in-cheek approach. I mean, there's already a built-in sense of the ridiculous just from the notion of our illustrious 16th President chopping down entire bevies of vampires with his trusty axe. But, for whatever reason, this film adaptation of Seth Grahame-Smith's hit mash-up novel opts for a more somber presentation. Grahame-Smith himself wrote the screenplay so you can't even rant that this isn't the author's vision. This was one of the summer flicks I was looking forward to. Yikes.

Honest Abe? No, not quite. There were dark secrets Abraham Lincoln firmly kept under his signature stove top hat. In this wild alternate biography, the narrative posits that not only was Abraham Lincoln the Great Emancipator, he also saved humanity from a relentless vampire incursion. To quote Lincoln's voiceover narration: ""History prefers legends to men... However history remembers me before I was a President, it shall only remember a fraction of the truth..."" The film opens in Pigeon Creek, Indiana, in the year 1818, when Abraham was a young lad, as we learn the horrifying origins of his lifelong obsession with hunting and destroying vampires. From there the film skips ahead to Abe as a young man (now played by Benjamin Walker) as he miserably fails in his first stab at vampire slaying. Enter Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper), enigmatic vampire expert who takes the inexperienced Abe under his wing and trains him in the art of tracking and snuffing out them malevolent creatures of the night. Cue the ridiculous(ly fun) training montage and the edge of Abe's favorite axe getting treated with silver, never mind that silver is notoriously the werewolf's bane, not the vampire's.

Abe should've known better than to mix his politics with his vampire slaying. But fate has tapped Abe for bigger and better things. I know we stepped into the theater mostly to eyeball Abe taking out vampires, but, for the sake of some verisimilitude and as grounding support, I wish that the film had been more eloquent in depicting this most iconic of figures. I wish it had gone more into exhibiting Lincoln's statesmanship, that his orations were delivered with more conviction, that Benjamin Walker had fleshed out his role more convincingly and with more weight and charisma. The film pays lip service to the historical moments in Lincoln's life. Really, these moments only serve as framing points for the CG-heavy action sequences and to occasionally remind the audience that, hey, in case you forgot, this is the freakin' 16th President. Look, there's the Gettysburg address.

I love, love, love those sequences in which Abe was dropping the mighty axe on the bloodsuckers. There is some amazing stunt work being done with the axe (lots of fancy axe twirling). The CG is very prominent, and I don't know that that horse stampede sequence is at all believable. Going in, I was keenly anticipating this film. The premise just made me happy. So I'm not sure what happened. Maybe Russian director Timur Bekmambetov is too mired in grand and heavy-handed mythology-building to make time and space for a wink of the eye, a nudge in the ribs. But this film could've done with a bright sense of fun. All that dramatic brooding eventually wears you down. Just as bad, the acting performances generally don't rise above the cripplingly solemn script, although I do think that Dominic Cooper turns in some pretty terrific scenes (I like his flashback story). There's also a reverse twist near the end which I didn't see coming, that I enjoyed.

I do like the film's interpretation of the vampires. It's interesting that no vampire can kill another, that they vanish and then resurface in a terrifying blink. And with judicious dabs of sun balm, they even participate in the Civil War.

Abe Lincoln as vampire slayer is just badasss. His action hero creds kept elevating as he relentlessly mowed down four score and seven (and more) of the undead. In fact, he comes off as so indomitable that, after a while, you stop treating him like a real character. You stop worrying about him. Ultimately, he's just one in a number of paper-thin characters inhabiting this movie. Benjamin Walker, unknown actor, has great physical presence but no gravitas. He fails to deliver on those emotional beats. He has zero chemistry with Mary Elizabeth Winstead who plays his love interest, Mary Todd. Walker doesn't really look like the Lincoln we're familiar with until around the third act. As revisionist histories go, ABRAHAM LINCOLN, VAMPIRE HUNTER falls victim to clunky storytelling and one-dimensional characterization but is buoyed by the well-executed action flourishes. There is a fun element of camp, yes, but an even stronger dose of cheekiness could've gone a long way. 3.5 out of 5 stars.",1341792000,6,4970,5.026699029126213

In spite of the vampire's brute strength, our rail splitter is able to keep pace. These are not real vampires, but those new Hollywood ""Twilight"" vampires that can go out into the sunlight.

The events of Lincoln's life is at times out of sequence and incorrect. They put a disclaimer at the beginning of the film saying history isn't always recorded correctly. That is all fine and well, but they should have made it a little closer to demonstrate the writer took some time to do some research. As a vampire film, this has a few good special effects, but nothing we haven't seen before. There are plenty of vampire films out there I thought were vastly superior to this one. The unique aspect of this film is the addition of Lincoln which frankly wasn't integrated into the film that well from an historical point of view. I thought Asylum (Lincoln vs Zombies)did a better job at integrating history. They spent a lot of money for special effects and a substandard script. Sadly, this has been become the blockbuster norm this summer. 3 1/2 stars.

The only appropriate connection in this film besides awfully loosely touching on some of the events in Lincoln's life, is ""vampirism.""  In folklore, just as vampires feed off of the blood of others, until 1865, slave owners financially fed off of the arduous efforts of an enslaved labor force.  As the film's title suggests, in this film, Lincoln hunts ""bad"" vampires.  However, people who initiate, further, and promote perverted works to be presented to the public that demean the superior exceptionalism of exceedingly noteworthy people are exploiting the very people who are responsible for the producers' freedom of creativity.

Freedom requires responsibility.  For authors and filmmakers who want to indulge themselves in the present fad of providing a ""twist"" to longtime, established truths, there is an infinite number of fictional characters who can be invented for shock value instead of perversely distorting individuals of superior exceptionalism who have toiled for the good of others in order for these book and film producers to achieve their selfish, monetary gains at the expense of people who have earned respect for their generous, beneficial, and important efforts.  These producing ""vampires"" will most likely continue to produce these warped works as long as there is a sufficient number of patrons who will give them their money for this ""twisted entertainment.""",1341532800,5,2116,5.503086419753086
4751319,2,B005LAIHZE,"Seth Grahame-Smith wrote the fictional novel ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" and it was published in 2010. So, the fictional concept of Lincoln being a vampire hunter in his secret life wasn't first realized in film form, but it is the first time many who aren't familiar with the book became privy to the extreme concept. Some rolled their eyes at the concept, some chuckled and some were intrigued to see how the creators of the book and film could make the fictional secret life of Lincoln feasible.

Benjamin Walker, a virtual unknown, is an uncanny likeness to Lincoln and that is definitely one of the great values to the film. The moviemakers couldn't have found a better actor to play the part and as much as he is an unknown, he won't be for long. He definitely held his own. His ability to fight vampires with passion and then become the distinguished gentlemen and amazing public speaker that we are all aware of made believing the secret life that much easier.

That being said, ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" suffers from the summer blockbuster expectations. Summer blockbusters are usually crammed full with movies with so much cheese and over-the-topness you just want to roll your eyes, and I didn't want to roll my eyes. I wanted the creators of the movies to convince me, as much as I know vampires are as real as fairies and dragons, that this secret life was possible. Most of the movie did a good job of blending known facts with fictional elaboration, but then the creators knew they had to please those that have made guys like Bay, Emmerich & Wiseman filthy rich every summer.

Had ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" had a release date outside of the summer blockbuster season, maybe the lowered expectations would have kept them from going off the deep end just to give everybody a slam bam `watch this' finale. After successfully building a reality threshold throughout the film, keeping a nice blend of history and fiction, they destroyed that illusion.

I had hoped that ""AL: Vampire Hunter"" would have had more tact than it did. I had hoped that there would have been more intelligence and more history, but there wasn't. Instead, the movie dragged through out, only brush stroking over the things we know as fact about Abraham Lincoln and never delving below the surface. The movie has some merit. As I stated before, Walker is a great Lincoln and the effects were amazing, but the makers should have spent more time maintaining the illusion to the audience that maybe, possibly Lincoln was a vampire slayer. Instead, they left us realizing that it was just another empty summer effects showcase.",1341446400,2,2630,4.824833702882484
4751320,1,B005LAIHZE,"Who on Earth thought that such a ludicrous concept would ever fly as a serious movie? This movie might have worked as a comedy. But it takes itself absolutely seriously, so that the comedy is unintentional, and that's the worst kind of comedy.

There's so much wrong with this movie that I don't even know where to begin.

I guess I'll start with the subtitle, ""Vampire Hunter."" The titular character doesn't actually do any vampire hunting in the movie. Rather, a renegade vampire feeds Lincoln the address of a vampire, and Lincoln goes to the address and slays the vampire. Where's the ""hunting"" in that? Lincoln is a vampire slayer, not a vampire hunter, so the movie goes wrong right at the title.

There's also not much of a plot. Lincoln slays vampires on the way to his presidency, and when he gets to be president, he keeps on slaying, until the head vampire's plan to take over the United States at the Battle of Gettysburg is thwarted. The movie is more like a travelogue detailing Lincoln's secret life on the way to the White House.

The movie loses all credibility when Lincoln starts swinging his axe and slaying vampires like he's the chick from Resident Evil. The sight of a dignified American icon moving like a Ninja is beyond ludicrous.

Then there are the actors themselves. Honestly, every single actor in this movie looks like a refugee from a comedy. Their hairstyles are comical, their facial expressions are comical...To a man, every second they're on screen, they look like they're all about to bust loose with a joke or a punch line.

All that being said, the period set pieces were really nice. If this movie were a Western, or a genuine biography of Abraham Lincoln, it would have looked great.

Avoid this movie at all costs, unless you're looking for a good laugh.",1341187200,9,1796,4.682539682539683
4751321,4,B005LAIHZE,"""History prefers legends to men. However history remembers me before I was a President, it shall only remember a fraction of the truth."" After stopping the whipping of a slave Abraham Lincoln's (Walker) father is fired from his job. Unable to pay off his debts his boss comes in the night and kills his wife. Young Lincoln sees this and begins his quest for vengeance. Ten years later he sees the man who murdered his mother and sees his chance, but it doesn't turn out like he planned. A man named Henry Sturgess (Cooper) begins to train Lincoln so he can complete his revenge. I have to say that I am a huge sucker for cheesy Sci-Fi movies. I love movies like ""Piranha"" and ""Mega-shark vs. Giant Octopus"". Something about those movies are just fun to me. I bring that up because that's what I was expecting from this movie. I couldn't have been more wrong. While it was a little over the top in some parts, this movie was more of a straight horror movie instead of going for the cheesiness I was thinking. That made the movie even better then I expected. I have never really been a big vampire movie guy but this one was great and may be my favorite vampire movie of all time. This ain't your girlfriend's vampires. This is more like ""Underworld"" on speed and more gore. Very very fun movie and you will never think of the Civil War the same way again. I highly recommend this, if you go in with an open mind and looking for blood you will love this like I did. Overall, a very fun movie that you can watch over and over. I really had fun with this one. I give it an A.",1340928000,3,1571,4.275167785234899
4751322,4,B005LAIHZE,"A young Abe Lincoln encounters evil as a boy, and it turns out they are vampires. He goes on a lifelong mission to hunt down the creatures who few realize live among us. He does this while being the President of the United States. This is a violent fantasy that has a bit if fun with the memory of perhaps our greatest president. He is trying to end slavery in this nation, but the vampires have been feeding off of slaves, so this threatens not only their existence, but the continued existence of our nation. You cannot take this one too seriously, yet it is not a campy parody. The serious tone and the ridiculous storyline mesh quite well together to bring us a film that is a welcome diversion. A premise so silly can be forgiven when a movie is this much bloody fun.",1340841600,2,772,4.3310344827586205
4751323,1,B005LAIHZE,"I cannot for the life of me believe the glowing reviews this film has received.  A friend and I went to see this last evening; the picture played to an almost packed house.  We did not stay for the ending; I had already read about that somewhere else.

It's one thing to construct any movie and take liberties with it.  ""Abe Lincoln Vampire Hunter"" did that--and then some.  It was certainly a new idea to add that the South was winning the Civil War because they had vampires fighting in their armies.  These vampires could also become invisible and were ""day walkers,"" something that wasn't thought possible until the ""Blade"" series.  The movie opens with young Abe watching his mother die at the hands of a wretched vampire, his pursuit of said vampire, which almost costs him his life, his education by another person in the fine art of hunting and killing vampires, his pursuing both Mary Todd and aspirations of a political career, right on through his presidency.  In the movie, Mary Todd was a real looker--and almost as tall as Lincoln.  Talk about blurring the line between real and unreal...

ALVH lacked soul; the actors went through the motions, but because the writers wanted to weigh down EVERY scene with needless drama, what could have been played (well) as camp, was played way too seriously.  Even the final battle between the bad boy vampire (played by Rufus Sewell) was like, ho-hum.  All the kills were CGI, which I also didn't care for.  And the drama...OH, the DRAMA.  Make up your minds, people:  either make a horror movie or make a drama.  The two just didn't mix here.

The movie is rated R for violence and lasts 105 minutes, which was probably 15 minutes too long.",1340755200,7,1694,4.64983164983165
4751324,3,B005LAIHZE,"I like to think I can appreciate a premise so far removed from reality as this, and certainly the filmmaker's and writers had a choice.  Do we play this up with a bit of campy humor or go with the serious-play-it-straight direction.  They chose the latter.

As a boy, young Abe sees his mother slain by a vampire and vows revenge.  Years later as a young man (Benjamin Walker) he is schooled by a mysterious stranger (Dominic Cooper) in the art of killing vampires.  Abe's weapon of choice is a silver laden ax, because he has some experience splitting rails.  Abe becomes quite adept to the point of spinning that ax like a cheerleader's baton.  Interwoven during his vampire removal time in Springfield, Illinois he meets his wife Mary (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), gets elected to Congress and eventually the presidency.

In a career defining period of the Civil War, Lincoln learns that the vampires are siding with the Confederates because the slaves are nourishment for the vampires.  In a terrific scene he confounds the vampire leader, Adam (Rufus Sewell) boarding a train full of silver that will be used to arm the Union soldiers.  It's all misdirection, easily spotted but the confrontation on the train is well done.  Director Timur Bekmambetov has some experience dealing with vampires with ""Day Watch"" and ""Night Watch"" both rather leisurely paced thrillers.  I think a less serious tone might have helped with this film.  At least a few Bond-like quips to lighten the tone.",1340668800,2,1485,4.892
4751325,4,B005LAIHZE,"This movie started off pretty slow, but got better toward the middle. It was a great blend of horror and political history. You can tell it's based on a graphic novel because of the often bright colors, slow-motion action fight scenes, and cgi gore, but it was still fun. When Abe Lincoln's mother is killed, he vows revenge against the man who did it. When he finds out the killer was a vampire, he's trained by Henry Sturgess to become a fearless vampire hunter. I like the last half of the movie better because Lincoln looks more like himself that we know with the beard. Will Lincoln be able to free the slaves, stop the war, and kill all the vampires during his Presidency? I'd definitely recommend ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER!!!",1340582400,2,738,4.641221374045801
4751326,4,B005LAIHZE,"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter was an original, refreshing take on history. Is it in any way accurate? Of course not. Too many critics are complaining that they did not stick with history or are ignoring history. Really? The film is called Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter...Did you expect anything else.

The story is the basic story of revenge. At a young age, Abe makes his first contact with vampires witnessing the death of a loved one. For years revenge stirs in his heart until finally he decides to do something about it. He confronts the vampire but quickly starts losing the fight until a vampire hunter saves him and sets his life path towards hunting vampires.

The story is a simple tale of revenge with a heavy dose of blood and dead vampires. A little of history is sprinkled in with an original retelling of some of the great events in Lincoln's life and history in general.

The actors/actresses in the film held their own. There aren't any academy awards in this movie but that isn't to say the acting was poor. It was sufficient for a dark vampire hunting movie.

The special affects were enjoyable and well done.

In the end this is a great summer movie that will entertain you. Those of you that are not obsessed with history and MUST have all historical portrayals be 100% accurate will indeed enjoy how history was re-imagined in the scope of Lincoln being a vampire hunter. As long as you accept that the premise of this story is ridiculous and do not expect this to closely resemble actual history, this movie will indeed entertain you.",1340582400,3,1560,4.678832116788321
4751327,3,B005LAIHZE,"Finally something unique in theaters. No remake, sequel or board game based movie here. I read the book over a year ago and really enjoyed it, but the movie was a mixed bag. The concept is cool if you don't mind history being messed with in a big way, the acting was solid (though I thought the guy paying Lincoln was a bit boring at times), the CGI was more hit than miss, there were some good and gory fight scenes and the sets/atmosphere was good enough.

I really thought they rushed through it. The editing could have used some work, like towards the end it goes from Lincoln starting his career in politics to being the president in the next scene. Maybe a longer cut will be available in the future.

Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter was fun to watch and is worth checking out on Blu-ray, but I had higher hopes given the source material.

I'm looking forward to seeing what Daniel Day-Lewis does with the historical version of Lincoln's life later this year. Maybe he will even pick up a third Oscar for his efforts.",1340496000,6,1023,4.459893048128342
4751328,1,B005LAIHZE,"There are many instances in literature and film where a famous person is placed into a fictitious setting and one of the key componants to the entertainment value of such a proceeding is the audience's anticipated ability to imagine alternative or hidden histories related to whatever historical characters are being utilized.  A recent cinematic example is THE RAVEN where the historically mysterious last weeks in Poe's life are the springboard for the speculative.  Many years ago there was a very fine film called TIME AFTER TIME that raised the question ""What if H.G. Wells had not only written of the Time Machine, but had invented one as well?"" The film then built upon this notion and the resultant movie - which also included Jack the Ripper being transported to the future, our present - was extremely well done, exciting, entertaining and even thought-provoking. There was also a Sherlock Holmes movie - THE SEVEN PERCENT SOLUTION - wherein Sigmund Freud is called in by Dr. Watson to help with Holmes' cocaine addiction.  There are many, many examples wherein historical figures are intertwined and interjected into fictional settings - and very often the results are fun, exciting, interesting, thought-provoking.  The truly crucial element in all cases where this artistic hybrid proves successful to one degree or another is winning the audience's ability to at least be able to say ""It could have happened.""  So, in the examples above, had Holmes been a historical figure, Freud could have crossed paths with him.  Poe, in his last unknown weeks, could have - no matter how absurd and unlikely - been involved in a serial murder case as shown in THE RAVEN.  And even though it is logically absurd, imaginatively the thought of H.G. Wells and a real Time Machine is truly delightful to contemplate.

But with ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER, what would have worked better as a five minute Saturday Night Live sketch, comes at us like this same flick's Lincoln's silver-tipped axe - cutting, chopping, killing everything in its path.  For starters, it cuts and chops and kills any entertainment value it ever might have had by sheer and simple overkill. And not just the overkill of the vampires and their victims: I mean yawn-inducing horse stampedes and ridiculous runaway trains that just never know when to quit!  And isn't it enough to take arguably the most famous figure in American history and make him into a vampire hunter?  Do the makers of this undisciplined train-wreck of a movie have to make him into a cartoon superhero too?  No man on the planet ever did or ever could leap and fly around in the silly horse stampede sequence or survive one one-hundreth of the physical extremes of the never ending train-wreck episode.  Only cartoon super heroes are capable of such gravity-defying, injury-immune acrobatics. Or should be. Superman or Spiderman - but not Honest Abe! (If Lincoln is able to leap tall buildings with a single bound, what is left for the Man from Krypton?) To watch and endure such sequences as mentioned above does a vast injustice to the heroic abilities of the truly human - and are an insult to the intelligence unless one is immune to or addicted to or financially enslaved to the Monster that is undisciplined, indiscreet, infantile CGI. This true Movie Monster has been stomping around for a long time now, crushing otherwise great and good actors in its path, stealing most things subtle and replacing it with the senseless spectacular - and the sounds and musical soundtracks that accompany these domineering digital depravities have mostly obliterated script literacy entirely.  Where is a silver axe to destroy this true Monster of the Movies?

But there is a larger issue at work here other than the misuse of CGI.  Does this allegedly ""fun"" film give early hint of a dangerous proclivity?  History is or should be important.  In a country where very few school kids (or even college kids!)(or even anybody!) even know who Abraham Lincoln is or, worse, even cares about why he is so historically great and enduring, along comes a movie that with its pandering to the current spike in the never-ending fascination with the undead and its catering to every conceivable cliche in the book when it comes to CGI-driven  and bloated actioneers, along comes a movie that takes the most painful pages from American history and spatters them not with the blood of men but with the blood of vampires.  So we see on screen an Abraham Lincoln who becomes President - not to keep the States United or end the much more insidious evil of slavery - no, this Lincoln's agenda is to defeat the vampire hordes who come to populate much of the South and by proxy the Confederate Army.  And the tide is turned at Gettysburg not by the sheer belief and bravery of the Union Army, but by plundered Southern silver being fired by rifle and cannon into the undead Rebels peopling Robert E. Lee's army.  And Lincoln's son Willie dies not of the truly tragic Potomac fever, but from a vampire's bite.  The point is that history is overwhelmingly trivialized in this silly, simplistic film.  It is one thing to speculate about hidden histories or might-have-beens in an artisic undertaking.  But when the history - as with Lincoln and the Civil War and Slavery - is virtually impossible to ever have been hidden and the might-have-beens have not the slightest semblance of sanity to back them, then the speculative work will suffer from a severe and deadly artistic anemia that has naught to do with the attack of a vampire.  The true vampires in this entire instance are the makers of this movie who suck blood and brain and bucks from the unsuspecting masses glutting on bread and circuses as Rome burns and Nero fiddles.

I can envision an ever darker, bleaker, scarier by-far future in film when some irresponsible and twisted film makers who just so happen to have an unlearned, unread, uncaring fan-based mandate might cook up a film wherein Hitler is also a vampire hunter and the Holocaust is nothing less than a purging of Europe's living dead hordes.

In short, to trivialize history is to trivialize humanity - and once that is acceptable by mass consensus...then anything, anything at all, could happen.  And usually does.",1340496000,13,6265,4.883962264150943
