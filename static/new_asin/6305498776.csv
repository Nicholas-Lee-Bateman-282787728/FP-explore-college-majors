And ohhhhhhhhh! Those sisters!",939340800,4,182,5.310344827586207

7891258,2,6305498776,"Strange New Zealand film full of psychological suspense and psychic silliness.  Alexis Arquette (Sometimes They Come Back Again) stars as the titular Jack, a young man who was cruelly abused by his adopted parents and their four witches from hell daughters.  We follow little Jack and his sister Dora, who was adopted by loving parents, as they grow up.  Eventually, Jack invents some kind of hypnotizing machine, coercing his adopted parents to kill themselves, and then he's off looking for both his sister Dora and his real parents.  Meanwhile, Dora's hooked up psychically and physically with some older man named Teddy (played by Bruno Lawrence in a lifeless performance), who she employs to help find her brother Jack.
The movie has a tragic underpinning, but once grown up, Jack is so obnoxious in his revenge, and Dora becomes nothing more than a whining, sniveling teenage girl, pregnant by her psychic lover.  They find their real parents, but the four sisters take care of things to make the ending as tragic as possible.
The movie looks thirty years old, and overall, is a disappointing thud.  Arquette is talented, but here he emotes to the level of high school thespianism, and Sarah Kennedy as Dora just gets on your nerves.
Avoid.",1083369600,4,1246,4.937799043062201
7891259,3,6305498776,"I got a VHS copy of this from Amazon and it is recorded in ""EP"" (the middle speed on your VCR, and some VCRs won't even play EP tapes).  The tracking was all over the place (distorting the picture AND sound), so even if you got it right, a few minutes later it would change....VERY annoying distraction!  There is a DVD version out there, but it is way overpriced right now.",1079913600,2,374,4.253521126760563
7891260,5,6305498776,"I tuned in to Jack Be Nimble when it was on TV today, & I was blown away by Alexis Arquette's acting ability. I've read some reviews saying it was a dissapointment because it wasn't a supernatural gothic horror film with ghosts & goblins, but Arquette's character was so real & memorable I truly felt what he felt throughout the film. I'm rarely touched by movies, which is why I wanted to write this review. I'm a tough critic, believe it or not, being someone who has studied dramatic arts for years, & although this psychological thriller had its weak assets, Arquette's performance was nothing short of sheer brillance.",1012780800,7,623,4.724770642201835
7891261,1,6305498776,"If you're like me, you probably wanted to check out this movie because it sounded like it really could be an excellent supernatural Gothic horror tale full of goblins and wicked things alike. Well, don't make the same mistake I did and actually watch it. It's horrible. Terrible. An honest to goodness waste of film. The acting is wretched, the film quality is rotten (it actually looks twenty years older than it is), and the plot is thin, weak, and does not give you what it's supposed to. The only reason I bothered to give this film 1 star is because of Alexis Arquette -- he's great looking, but should have left this film out of his career.",1005696000,2,646,4.483050847457627
7891262,1,6305498776,"Glum film tries too hard as adopted blood siblings reunite later in life.  He has a hypnotizing machine, an attitude, and four angry sisters after him, she is psychic and pregnant.  Brooding and dark, dull and silly.",983232000,3,216,4.8108108108108105
7891263,5,6305498776,"This movie was the most original thing I've seen in years.  It stars  Alexis Arquette who is emotionally and physically abused to the point of  having to retaliate using his invention.  Believe you me, this is a sight  to behold.  I agree with everyone, the sisters were creepy.  The ending of  this movie still gives me bad dreams. Veeeeery scary.",968716800,8,348,4.683333333333334
7891264,4,6305498776,"Garth Maxwell now directs lots of XENA episodes, but he made this great little New Zealand horror masterpiece several years earlier.  It's a unique exercise in stylish mood and character.  Alexis Arquette and Sarah  Kennedy play brother and sister separated from each other as young  children.  Arquette ends up with an abusive family with 3 weird  look-a-like ""goth"" sisters.  What will Arquette do to survive  the abuse from his new Mom and Pop and siblings? ---create a weird  electrical - candle fused machine that can hypnotize and give him the  chance to wreak revenge.  It may sound ridiculous, but director Maxwell  handles it as a mood-piece, almost like a fairy-tale, and it works.  Eventually Arquette finds his sister which leads to their search for their  abandoning mother.  They're also being chased by the 3 ""goth""  sisters...which ends in a haunting finale.  A great little horror film  for fans who hate mainstream stuff like ""Scream"" and ""I Know  What You Did Last Summer"".  As far as the DVD goes, it's a mixed bag.  Unfortunately, IMAGE ENT. once again released a bare-bones DVD with no  extras, the film is not letterboxed and it contains that very low  ""phantom"" audio track in the background during some scenes (this  audio glitch was on IMAGE's laserdisc as well, but not on the original VHS  release from TRIBORO).  It's a subtle problem, however.  I guess it's  nice they released it at all, but they could spend a little more time and  effort in their releases.  The folks over at IMAGE don't seem to really  care much about pleasing their audience....or maybe it's just laziness.",957657600,7,1608,4.888059701492537
7891265,4,6305498776,"5 years after (it was at Fantastic festival of Gerardmer, France), Jack be nimble is still a hard experiment in fear ! I regret this DVD edition doesn't respect the original format of the movie, you will be terrfied by  the world of this boy's family : his half-sisters are completely unsane and  give some of the biggest horror visions never seen for a long time. Some  commentaries of the director about this mad story could've been a good  bonus and will uprate the DVD.",946684800,5,473,4.529411764705882
