You start out with ""The Ice Trap"" which is about a uranium ore heist and end up with some other episode about Captain Morgan's treasure. Truthfully, Ive seen a lot of bad video vintage cartoons but nothing comes close the insulting treatment you get from this experience.

This ""video company"" must think their audience is totally brain dead or maybe they are too dumb to realize whatever fuzzy VHS source they got these ""adventures"" from are incomplete hodge-podge corrupted episodes. If you paid more than FREE you paid too much.

FWIW Ive seen their Space Angel DVD also and its hardly better with 4 episodes of the ""The Gladiators"" and missing the last episode. The Video Quality is sub-standard, you get a bare minimum of a DVD menu no episode selection, illogical, meaningless chapter points, c'mon is it that hard to program these essentials into a menu? No! What does eastwest seem to care about the most, your satisfaction or your money? This is pure dollar store bottom feeder video at its worst.

Too bad because Fathom is a great ""lost"" series by Cambria with great comedy writing and characters - Wish someone would do this one justice with a full official release rather than these crummy bootlegs.

To sum it up -- If you like feeling that ""I feel cheated"" feeling Captain Fathom Vol. 2 is for you!!",1346716800,4,1514,4.789272030651341
