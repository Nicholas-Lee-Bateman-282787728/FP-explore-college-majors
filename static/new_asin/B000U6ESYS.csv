Although, all Asian Drama DVDs are like that because most of the time online, they have someone input SOFT english subtitles which of course is easier to read & faster to understand.  Overall, the series itself is awesome.",1242604800,,336,4.661016949152542
8212199,1,B000U6ESYS,"I watched this series online and found it quite entertaining.  I bought a copy so that my wife could watch it too.  Unfortunately, while the online version has English subtitles that are easy to understand, the English subtitles on the DVD set are terrible.  It's impossible for a person who doesn't speak Korean to follow the story from the English subtitles, so I have to keep pausing the DVD and explaining to my wife what's happening.",1234396800,4,438,4.7368421052631575
