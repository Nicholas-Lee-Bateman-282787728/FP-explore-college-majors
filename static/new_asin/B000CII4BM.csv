WHAT AN AMAZING, OSCAR WORTHY PERFORMANCE. I EXPECT TO SEE A LOT MORE OF HIM IN MOVIES TO COME.",1300060800,,176,4.363636363636363
8099058,2,B000CII4BM,"Since Jeff Fahey co-produced this one, I thought maybe he was after more
quality and to escape his B Movie status.

I was wrong.

Or maybe not.  Maybe he simply can't do it.  His actor's emotional range is limited to anger, comic, dead calm, action.  He fell very short in any scene that was meant to convey emotion, and always has.

Don't get me wrong.  I like Jeff Fahey and have for a long time.  Since Lawnmower Man.  Even now, with his wild gray hair and beard, he is still one of those men you could ...uh, well,....never mind.

I fully expected a good old fashioned tear jerker, or at least something that touched the heart.  But it lacked heart.  No strength to the building of characters, nothing to grab at you and hold you into sticking with the story.

I just wish they wouldn't make B Movies.  If you're going to do it, do it well.",1233273600,,844,4.292993630573249
