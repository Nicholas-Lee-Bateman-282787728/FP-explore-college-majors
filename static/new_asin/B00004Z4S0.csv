1379895,5,B00004Z4S0,This is my absolute number #1 favorite yoga video I own.  Great for beginners or not so beginner and for athlete or non-athlete.  Rodney explains the poses but keeps it interesting.  This video turned my husband onto yoga.,1017878400,4,222,4.7894736842105265
1379896,5,B00004Z4S0,"This video was exactly what I was looking for.  I am a long distance runner who hates stretching, and my flexibility (or lack thereof!) attests to this.  I have never done yoga before, but was interested in trying it for the stretching and conditioning.
Not ever having done a yoga pose before, this video was clear and the pace slow enough to catch on quickly.  Having two other people doing variations of the poses Rodney was doing was extremely helpful.  I was surprised how relaxing I found the final minutes of the ""Integration"" session.
This video is well worth it for anyone wanting to try out yoga for the first time.",1014422400,10,625,4.603603603603603
7928047,1,B00004Z4S0,"I ordered this as a gift and by the picture it looks like all the DVD's I've ordered in the past.  In fact, I've never ordered a VHS tape from Amazon.

I can't believe I sent a gift of a VHS tape.  How embarrassing for me and Amazon that they still sell these.

7928048,5,B00004Z4S0,"I held off buying this dvd for a very long time, because I am certainly no athlete.  I do, however, enjoy yoga, especially those dvds done by Rodney Yee.  I finally broke down and purchased this dvd thinking I would give it to my daughter, who is a black belt in karate and enjoys yoga for flexibility.  What a thrill I had when the two of us did this yoga dvd together!  This dvd is excellent.  The routines are not out of reach for a beginner, but are certainly something we can all aspire to to enhance our practice.  I agree with the reviewer who said it shows how much tension is carried in the hips.  This is an area I often try to stretch to no avail, but this dvd does the trick.  I am so glad I finally bought this dvd.  If you are not an athlete, don't let the title scare you.  This is a wonderful dvd for everyone.",1152144000,4,826,4.04320987654321
7928049,5,B00004Z4S0,"Don't let the title scare you off if you are not an athlete.  I started my yoga practice two years ago using this video.  It has three parts which can be used separately or together in one sessions.  Rodney Yee explains postures thoroughly.  After using this tape often, I still find it challenging since he has students who demonstrate different levels of each move.  A beginner can start off with modifications and move into more challenging positions as flexibility and stamina improve.  It is still my favorite tape, even though my practice has expanded greatly.

7928050,4,B00004Z4S0,"""Yoga Conditioning for Athletes"" was recommended to me by my physical therapist - prior to realizing that I required two complete hip replacements - and after giving up Tae Kwon Do.  At that time, my hope - as was the case with many movement modalities - was to fix whatever was wrong with me.  It was simply too painful for me, by that time.  Post-surgery and recovery, it remains a special favorite of mine.",1130630400,5,409,4.5
7928051,5,B00004Z4S0,"This was the first yoga tape that I tried, as a beginner and definitely not an athlete.  I liked the three different levels that are shown and the fact that Rodney moves through the poses slowly and talks you through them.  He also gives you time to get into position and hold the poses.  It is challenging to me as a beginner, but not too difficult to at least approximate the correct positions.  Although I work out a good bit, I find my muscles are sore after doing the whole tape.  The Opening or Conditioning parts of the tape can stand alone as independent sessions if you don't have time to do the whole thing.  I especially like to use this tape in conjunction with other types of exercise.",1093651200,6,698,4.372093023255814
7928052,4,B00004Z4S0,"I like this tape for opening up hips and stretching.  You can feel the pain in days after of good run.  I only gave the tape 4 stars because it's not really satisfying enough for a complete hour yoga workout.  While for daily 20-min stretching, I find that the third tape in Rodney Yee's Power Yoga for Beginners: Flexibility has much of the same stretching goodness in a smaller package, so I can also have time for other workouts.",1047859200,7,432,4.443037974683544
7928053,3,B00004Z4S0,"I have a number of other yoga tapes that I use and thought that this would be a good one since I am a runner and triathlete. I am not even a very competitive athlete, and I still found this tape to be not very challenging. I was expecting a tape geared at athletes to be more challenging than standard yoga tapes, and it was not. It is far easier than the other tapes I have. If you are a beginner, this would be a good tape because it does not use more advanced poses, however there are times that it seems Rodney Yee assumes you should know the position names already, so be alert for that.",1044748800,8,592,4.068376068376068
7928054,5,B00004Z4S0,"Let me begin by saying that I am definitely NOT an athlete; I do work out regularly at home (with a recumbent bike and strength/yoga videos), but I've never participated in any kind of sports activity.  However, I borrowed this video from the library after someone recommended to me as a good overall yoga tape, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that I didn't need to be an athlete to complete the workout.
Instructor Rodney Yee begins the workout with a 10-minute stretching segment using a chair.  These are more traditional moves rather than yoga type moves, and they focus particularly on opening up the hips and hamstrings.  Although I'm not at all flexible, I was able to do all of the stretches without modifications, but Rodney works out with a woman and another man, both of whom offer modifications if necessary.  After the stretching segment, Rodney moves on to approximately 20 minutes of standing yoga poses.  I particularly enjoyed this section and found it to be better than other yoga tapes I've tried, mainly because Rodney holds each pose longer, explaining how to increase your flexibility and move further into the pose over time.  The standing toning is followed by 10-15 minutes of yoga moves on the floor consisting mainly of forward bends and twists.  Finally, there is a 5-minute relaxation segment at the end.
This tape certainly IS appropriate for athletes, especially since throughout the workout, Rodney talkes about how the exercises will benefit your athletic performance.  However, for those us who aren't athletes, this is an excellent, easy-to-follow yoga/stretching tape with an emphasis on flexibility and balance.  I would say that virtually all of the moves are appropriate for beginners; however, because Rodney does not explain how to do the yoga poses--he simply gives the name of each pose--some prior familiarly with basic yoga would be helpful, but watching the entire tape before performing it should also be adequate.  Rodney is an excellent instructor, and I found him to be pleasantly slower-paced and less new-agey on this video versus the others in the Living Arts series.
For beginners, I would definitely recommend this tape over Living Arts' ""Yoga Practice for Flexibility""--although that is touted as a beginner's tape, I found about half the workout to be undoable for someone at my level.  I highly recommend ""Yoga Conditioning for Athletes"" for anyone looking to increase their flexibility and balance, athletes or otherwise.",1029110400,41,2487,5.116049382716049
7928055,4,B00004Z4S0,"The first segment of this yoga tape I use regularly to stretch out before lifting weights or playing basketball. After a good opening and middle section, I found the seated on the floor section a bit weak. I have been previously critical of Yee's very short abdominal yoga tape but compared to that and some others I have, this one is a winner. Had Yee tacked the abdominal workout onto the end of this tape, it easily would have been a 5 star selection.",1028764800,4,454,4.416666666666667
7928056,4,B00004Z4S0,We really enjoyed this tape but it is NOT for beginners.  It moves quickly and assumes you already know the positions.  A great tape for intermediate use that focuses on stretching commonly used sport muscles.,1021334400,3,209,4.942857142857143
