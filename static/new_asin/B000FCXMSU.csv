Because it's not easy to convert from Low Quality to High Quality, preserving the videos is the essential concept these days...

This is DVD is no exception. This DVD is a complete remake of the original 1993 video called ""Frazier's Favorites"". The video is of a video production and photo shoot of the girls in the video. The video camera used is obviously a low quality based on the quality of the video itself. Seems like it was done on a $500 VHS cam-corder. You can clearly see how ""grainy"" the video is based on the year of the original copyright. Although on a plus side, the sound is not too bad, at least the background music sounds good. (Although the intro music was seriously sad and cheesey, someone obviously came up with an ""on-the-spot"" theme for the title/intro scene) The video shows 15 models, each model getting about 2-4 minutes of ""face"" time with a complete running time of just under an hour. (0:51:01) There is a scene selection and some bonus footage.

Overall it's not a bad video, considering the time/date it was originally made as well as the conversion from VHS to DVD. Although the video shows a lot of nice looking girls, it's actually neat to see how they used to do photoshoots as well as how they set the stage for each model. Back then, they didn't use digital memory cards to store photo's, they used film strips that had to be used just right, or photo's would be ruined and couldn't be fixed. A nice collection of girls on one DVD. FOR ADULTS ONLY!!!",1413417600,2,1685,4.485342019543974
8120869,4,B000FCXMSU,"Excellent product.  A soft and gentle, girl-next-door, type production.  However, if you are looking for more open, less cover, less artistic, and more robust presentations, you might not like this as much.  Camera work is excellent, and sets are simple, but effective.  Again, however, if you want something more direct and less subtle, you may not like this.",1194480000,3,360,5.155172413793103
