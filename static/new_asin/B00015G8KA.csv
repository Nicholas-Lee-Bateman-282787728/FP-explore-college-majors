1971527,4,B00015G8KA,"As mentioned in other reviews, the overall quality of this DVD is very good.  I was hoping for more footage of just Doc's lead without any accompaniment so you can sort out exactly what is going on.  The slow examples that are played are a little faster than I would prefer, but they are helpful none the less.  The tab was a little disappointing, for the money I expected a full tab in a book.  The partial tab booklet that comes with the DVD is helpful, but be prepared to do it the old fashion way... lifting licks by playing parts of the DVD over and over again.  It is extremely helpful to see Doc's left hand so you can know what position he is picking out of when compared to figuring out runs from a CD.  It's worth buying if you're serious about learning Doc Watson's style.",1187740800,4,783,4.256756756756757
1971528,4,B00015G8KA,"Doc Watson is a great guitar player, and getting the closeup view of his hands as he plays is instructive and interesting. Great self-taught players who manage to be genuinely innovative, as Doc Watson is, always have some quirks in their technique, and Doc is no exception.

The problem is that Doc doesn't really know how to teach what he does. Like I said, he's self-taught; I don't think he has much frame of reference for how to explain what he does. He plays everything too fast and doesn't focus on dissecting his more intricate runs.

Still, though, you do get the feeling that you're almost sitting right in front of him and watching him play, and that in itself is instructive. You can learn from this DVD, but don't expect to come away from it a flatpicking master.",1180828800,4,776,4.575539568345324
1971529,5,B00015G8KA,"It's a good DVD, with a LOT of songs tabbed out.  The songs played on this disc have a little bit of everything; runs, cross picking, and good-old fashioned flat picking. Worth the price if you want a breakdown of Doc's playing style and are looking to step up your game.  I think this is appropriate for beginner to intermediate skill levels.",1174780800,,343,4.516129032258065
1971530,5,B00015G8KA,"This DVD is the best thing I ever got a hold of. It offers Steve Koffman who is an excellent guitarist and of course the greatest of them all, Doc Watson! The picken will speak for itself. I want to talk about the quality of the DVD. It is great! The lighting, camera position on the guitars is much better then the other DVD. I am still saying the other DVD of Doc is well worth the money.",1129507200,11,390,4.012820512820513

8006670,5,B00015G8KA,Amazing. A ton of great picking to be learned from both Doc and Steve. Always love listening to Doc talk too. Not only an amazing picker but also a great human being.,1441152000,,166,4.21875
8006671,3,B00015G8KA,"Doc is a great picker of course, but this book is him picking and not a whole lot if insight on how to go about doing it.  Crosspicking is hard and there should be an intro or guide to show you how to begin to go about it.  I don't believe the tab book has all the stuff doc picks here either.",1423008000,,293,3.7096774193548385

8006673,4,B00015G8KA,"This DVD works better as a general insight into Doc's playing than it does as a ""how to"". Doc is warm and folksy, and sounds great, but is not too analytical about how he does what he does. Steve Kaufmann does a great job of interviewing and accompanying him, but has a hard time getting technical info from him. At one point he asks Doc a questions, who basically replies ""well, I feel the music in my fingers and it just comes out"" LOL! But that is not to say that you won't get a lot out of it by simply watching and listening - just don't expect a lot of details. Doc is gone now, so this is an invaluable look at his guitar playing. The camera work helps capture what his hands are doing. Be patient and enjoy!",1390262400,,715,4.114285714285714
8006674,5,B00015G8KA,"good video footage and sound. This item is well suited for an intermediate or advanced guitar picker, but can get a beginner going, just stick with it.",1341878400,,151,4.62962962962963
8006675,5,B00015G8KA,"If you're a fan of Doc Watson, this DVD shall be part of your collection. The content is excellent and it certainly will add new knowledge about Doc's technique. I bought mine from Amazon and I'm very satisfied with the quality of the customer service.",1288915200,,252,4.622222222222222
8006676,5,B00015G8KA,I have really enjoyed this CD and book. I would highly recommend it for an intermedia player or an advanced beginning that is looking  to challange  themself,1248393600,2,157,4.777777777777778
8006677,3,B00015G8KA,"If you are a fan of Mr. Kaufman and Mr. Watson it is worth buying. I will enjoy watching the playing. That being said, if you are expecting the songs listed to be completely tabbed, you won't get it. Some of the songs just have the breaks tabbed. I bought it as a beginner who wanted to learn ""Little Sadie"". Granted it's advertised Level 3 (intermediate), but it's also advertised to include music and Tab. Homespun does great videos. To be honest I expected a little more.",1213228800,7,474,4.459770114942529
