2615701,5,B000GPPNO2,I have been waiting on St Elsewhere to be released for so long. This was such a wonderful show. I still remember the head getting mailed to the mother in law instead of a lamp shade. Oh what a classic. We watched that box go through the hospital the entire show. I am so excited!!!,1159574400,5,281,4.127272727272727
2615702,5,B000GPPNO2,"St. Elsewhere had the kinds of storylines and characters that stayed with you.  Funny, filled with black comedy and real caring, it got inside you and never let go.  One of very few TV series I could watch again and again and again!  Plus, the theme is a winner.  I'm so glad it's finally available on DVD!",1159401600,3,306,4.315789473684211
2615703,5,B000GPPNO2,"FINALLY!!!  I have been waiting forever for this day. I ""lived and died"" by this aweswome show back when it was first broadfcast and when it appeared in syndication years later. I saw and taped every single episode. Now I can replace those 70 or so VHS tapes with something a whole lot more permanent. Although I enjoy ER and really liked  CHICAGO HOPE very much, no medical show, in my opinion, has or ever will ever beat ST ELSEWHERE. Long live ST Eligius Hospital! And here's to you, Dr. Craig.

  If you have never seen ST ELSEWHERE, do yourself a big favor and check it out. If you are a fan of great storytelling, wonderfully rounded-out characters, and want to see television at its optimum best, then please wait no longer and get this set now.",1158969600,5,752,4.45985401459854
2615704,4,B000GPPNO2,"Like the other pre-reviewers here, I have been waiting for this for years.  I agree that St. Elsewhere was the best American TV series ever.  I also hope that the music rights issue has been resolved satisfactorily.  The only reason I am pre-rating this four stars instead of five is that I felt the show really didn't hit its stride until the second season--but the first season was still very, very good and the whole series is a must-see for any fan of quality TV.",1158710400,4,467,4.470588235294118
2615705,5,B000GPPNO2,"YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

We all had that reaction, I'm sure. I'm suggesting those of us who can afford itbuy more than one copy. We all want all of the seasons released and that is driven by the success of the sets that are released. I've ordered 2. I think of it as a vote and this is one show I think we all agree should win the ballot.",1158710400,8,346,4.242424242424242
2615706,5,B000GPPNO2,"I am sooo happy to see the release of the first season of this amazing series coming out on DVD finally!  I have waited a long time to see the doctors and nurses of St. Eligius on DVD.  I can't wait to see Drs. Westphall, Auschlander, and Craig and all the other cast members of this beloved series grace my TV screen again!  I used to live for the nights that this show came on NBC from 1982 until 1988.  It ran for a awhile in syndication on Bravo.  But it has been well over a year since then.  I plan to get all the seasons when they all come out on DVD.",1158710400,30,558,3.893805309734513
2615707,5,B000GPPNO2,"This is simply one of the best dramatic series in TV history. It had the best ensemble cast ever, the best writing, and tackled taboo subjects that other shows wouldn't touch. Although, I am worried that if the first season doesn't sell well enough they won't release the entire series which would be a crime, for no one could have guessed how they decided to end the show, which is also the greatest finale I've ever seen. SO PLEASE RELEASE THE ENTIRE SERIES RUN!",1158710400,12,464,4.535714285714286
2615708,5,B000GPPNO2,"A number of years ago I wrote an Amazon review of the box VHS set, ""The Best of St. Elsewhere.""  In that videotape collection all of the contemporary or period music had been replaced by an awful, high-static overdub of generic, muzak-style tunes.  Obviously rights for all of the popular and pre-recorded songs could not be obtained and the set was released anyway.  Only the theme song and background score composed specifically for the show remained as originally intended.  Unfortunately, the new dubbing ruined many of the best episodes and even the actors' original dialogue tracks were barely audible over the `new' score.

[UPDATE: I have purchased the DVD since writing this review several weeks ago.  Fox Home Entertainment has done a terrific job with the extras and remastering. Producer/co-creator/director Mark Tinker mentions in the audio commentary for the 'Cora & Arnie' episode that even at the time of production they frequently had to use very convincing 'sound-alikes' for period music because the original artists' recordings were prohibitively expensive.  The one exception to this was the ZZ Top song 'Legs,' which the producers did buy and may be heard in a later episode/season.  Despite this, the earlier VHS collection I referenced still has terrible overdubs and does not contain the original broadcast selections - sound-alike or not.  I am happy to report that at least for the Season 1 DVD all of the original music seems to be intact.]

I am very glad that the series is at long last being released on DVD, but am wondering if the music rights were ever obtained.  This issue has held up many other releases, most notably `Miami Vice,' which was scored almost entirely with hit songs from the 80s.

I will purchase the first season and hope for the best.  If you are just coming to `St. Elsewhere' you are in for a wonderful treat.  TV Guide once named it the best drama series of all time.  Despite its relatively low ratings it was beloved by critics and boasted a loyal fan base.  The writing has yet to be matched anywhere and the ensemble (consisting mostly of acclaimed stage actors) rounds out one of the largest and most versatile casts ever assembled for television.

No series has ever matched St. Elsewhere and I don't think anything ever will - it will make you laugh; it will make you cry; it will show you how great television can be. Hooray for this release!",1158192000,53,2406,4.829268292682927
2615709,5,B000GPPNO2,"It's about dang time they started releasing this series. Afterall, TV Guide rated this as the best prime-time drama series in television history - and for good reason. This series pioneered blending poignance and irreverence with a top-notch ensemble cast, the likes of which have not been matched in a prime-time drama since. If you're only vaguely familiar with this series, do yourself a favor and sample Season One when it comes out; this show embodies all that television can be.",1157846400,26,484,4.987654320987654

2615711,5,B000GPPNO2,St. Elsewhere is one of my all-time favorite shows. This is the first time I've seen it in many years and it's still wonderful. PLEASE release the other five seasons!,1503100800,3,166,4.566666666666666

2615713,1,B000GPPNO2,"Well, the quality is acceptable although not top notch. Mostly the audio is weak and requires the volume to be turned up. Not a big deal. The real problem is that all the listed episodes are not on the discs. Thus, I don't have the full Season 1 that I paid for. Given that this is more of an ongoing soap opera than stand alone episodes, that means it's at times hard to follow since I've missed episodes. Overall, not impressed...The maker of this DVD should be ashamed of themselves......",1501113600,2,491,4.466666666666667

I cannot FATHOM how a show that was so popular and critically acclaimed has not had any MORE seasons released in all this time! Considering that there are shows that only last two or three season before cancellation that get released (for instance, I've bought the complete sets of ""Sportsnight"" and ""The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr."") I just don't understand where the remaining seasons of THIS show are!

2615749,5,B000GPPNO2,"The real reason that we can not get St. Elsewhere's (all the seasons) is that it comically told the truth about managed health care just as it was beginning to take hold.  Now our health care system for neonatal care is ranked 54 the in the world and the rest of our health care has also become very poor compared to the late 80's when it was ranked in the top 3 in the world.  I remember seeing an episode near the end that was truthful and very critical of what was happening and told my wife that I bert it will be forced off the air.  Well not only was it forced off the air but we can not even get the DV""s this is how Atlas Shrugs economy works. Truth is seldom told even in comedy....",1460764800,,691,3.9927536231884058
2615750,5,B000GPPNO2,"This TV hospital ensemble series was so startling and quirky, its characters real with real personal lives, and patients who were more than just vehicles for  terrible diseases or accidents.  It beat  Dr Marcus Welby all to bits. It is a shame that the powers that be do not release the 5 remaining seasons. Who has a VSH player these days (one that works, anyway)?

It is a treat to see the many famous actors who were in this series, and the ensemble chemistry of the cast is a joy to watch.
If you like Chicago Hope, and ER, you will like St Elsewhere. By the way, St Elegius, the namesake of the fictional hospital where the drama takes place, was the patron saint of actors in the Middle Ages. Sort of an inside joke....",1460505600,7,725,4.348148148148148

The discs that come in the set are double sided, always a signal of cost cutting and mediocre quality. These discs did not work at all in my machine. I will allow that my machine is older but still a brand name. I never have problems with it when running studio quality discs. However discs of inferior quality that come from off brand suppliers can present a problem. Hopefully the vendor will take them back for a refund. I will not ask for a replacement since I am sure the entire stock is of the same uneven quality. Hopefully some other manufacturer will produce subsequent seasons.",1406592000,4,703,4.543307086614173

2615796,5,B000GPPNO2,"Enjoying watching season 1, haven't seen this for many years.  Too bad no one had done the rest of the seasons this is still a great fun show to watch.  I watched it on Hulu since I couldn't see paying for just one season, if a boxed set of it all ever comes out I'd buy it.  I just check the news, weather, e-mail etc. when the commercials are on (very nostalgic to watch it with ads :) ).  It's always fun to remember how much younger we looked back than.  Watching this has inspired me to pick up some Denzel Washington movies (I had a sudden hankering to watch ""The Mighty Quinn"" among others).  If you haven't seen SE, don't expect a lot of blood and gore this was 80's made for TV, but the character interactions are what this series was about.",1399852800,,750,4.173611111111111
2615797,3,B000GPPNO2,"I remember this when it was actually on-the-air, and thought it would be interesting to see if I still felt the same way about it.  At the time, it was revolutionary-we thought doctors were on the same level as God, and to see them portrayed as human beings was an eye-opener then.  But as I watched this first season, I found it somewhat repetitive.  The young doctors all complained about the long hours and low pay, over and over. And it seems that the (young) men couldn't keep their pants zipped, and the nurses were treated as an afterthought.  Still and all, it was worth it to see Howie Mandel when he had hair.",1399248000,2,619,4.4035087719298245

Maybe it's got a built-in advantage because of the sometimes life and death subject matter, but the forces that came together on this one make it a special phenomenon. You can feel the risks they took--in the size of the cast, the angle they took on issues, the honesty--and it makes for an edgy, fun, provocative series.",1398729600,,437,4.826666666666667

In a  range of very funny episodes, the characters are very well-developed and they are in the capable hands of Howie Mandel, Ed Begley Jr. William Daniels and others; no slouches here! The writers snagged a good premise and took it for a rollercoaster ride through believeable farces (well, almost believable) and, on occasion, a touch of poiniency. It  is consistently good and frequently brilliant. It has the mix of good plot, good character-development and can play with many situations with humor and good  taste.

2615808,4,B000GPPNO2,"This had great impact when it first ran.  I get glimpses of why.  The biggest weakness compared to what we see on tv now is the acting or maybe it's the acting style.

Neither my husband nor myself watch any show on television now: reality? Ugh! So when I bought the first season I settled down for an enjoyable evening with a wonderful cast, engaging guest stars, and well-written stories. Wonder of wonders, my husband begged for more! He is a die-hard western fan who has always moaned about ""hospital soap operas"" like ER and Emergency! and would not watch them.

2615814,5,B000GPPNO2,"St. Elsewhere was my favorite tv show for all the seasons it was on. I hated it when I heard it was ending. If you start the DVD, be ready to then buy the next, as this show gets into your heart and won't let go! I can't even recall one show of this series that disappointed me. I think this show way surpasses Grey's Anatomy, with plots, acting and writing ability, direction, and charisma. I did not miss an episode of it! I have missed more episodes of Grey's Anatomy than I have seen. People may be interested, too, in seeing Denzel Washington, such a fine actor, really make a name for himself in this series. One of many aspects of this show is that they used much more of an element of surprise and also put a lot of heart into the episodes than I recall Grey's Anatomy doing. I would compare St. Elsewhere more with<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pilot/dp/B000MPOJK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pilot</a>&nbsp;ER, another terrifically produced series. Bruce Paltrow was the director of this show- Gwyneth Paltrow's father, and he certainly knew his craft. If you enjoy a show that elevates tv, rather than some of the shows that are currently on, then treat yourself to this DVD and I'll bet you won't just watch the first show and put it down! It's a wonderful bonus that one can continue on to see more episodes rather than have to wait a week for the next one!",1375401600,,1408,4.774590163934426
2615815,5,B000GPPNO2,"I did not view ""St. Elsewhere"" when it first ran from 1982 - 1988, perhaps because that was the period when I was usually at work 12 hours a day (most especially in 1982), although I recall being aware of it and its principal leads, Ed Flanders, Norman Lloyd, and William Daniels, and I recall hearing of Denzel Washington's leaving the show at its conclusion to a big career in film. In this first season, Washington has a small role near the end of the season. The major players in story arcs for the first season are Ed Begley Jr., David Morse, Howie Mandel, Terence Knox, and Kim Miyori (who is not even in the main credits.)

The glory of the series was this huge cast, and a list of future great guest stars such as Tim Robbins and Tom Hulce, before Robbins went on to ""Top Gun"" and even bigger roles and Hulce went on to an Academy Award nomination for his role in Amadeus. The big cast meant you could have a wide variety of characters every week. Ed Begley was smart, but awkward and nave with the demanding head of surgery (Daniels). David Morse was a good, contentious doctor, who stretched himself too thin. Terence Knox was an average resident, who could not deal with his family life. Howie Mandel was an excellent resident in the ER, but inconsiderate of his fellow doctors.

One character which deserves a lot of credit is the fictional hospital after which the series is named. It always stands as a Cinderella to the famous ""Boston General"", a fictionalization of ""Massachusetts General"" in Boston. I can't help thinking that just a little inspiration for the series came from the film ""The Hospital"" which also takes place in an older center city hospital. The exterior and the look of the corridors exude age.

Perhaps one of the best things about the series is that it is the ""anti-House"". People get punished for breaking rules and going off on their own way of doing things. At the same time, there are no genius doctors. The three senior staff members, played by Flanders, Lloyd, and Craig are very good, perhaps some of the best in Boston, but they are no Gregory House. We see the reality of the way things work in hospitals.
I would not say there are any supremely great episodes in Season 1, but the level of storytelling, the interlocking arcs, is consistently high, and things hang together better than they did in ""Hill Street Blues"" which ran at about the same time.",1374451200,4,2398,4.559164733178655
2615816,5,B000GPPNO2,"I watched 'St. Elsewhere' back in the early 1980s and watching it in 2013 hasn't changed my opinion , still a great show. Well acted and written.  It may seem dated, but it far better then some of the shows on TV now.",1367366400,,217,4.046511627906977

2615823,5,B000GPPNO2,"St. Elsewhere is the perfect television drama from the 1980s. It's still timeless classic drama in the making with cast members like a young Denzel Washington, Howie Mandel, Ed Begley Jr., William Daniels, Norman Lloyd, and Ed Flanders just to name a few. St. Elsewhere was ground-breaking television that still sends chills down my spine. It was worth watching every week long before Tivo and DVRs when people would discuss the show at the water cooler.

St. Elsewhere earned every Emmy Award as well as other accolades along the way. It's one of the best dramas period with a memorable theme song. One of the reasons that ER never lived up to this series is that St. Elsewhere was a labor of love for the cast and crew. For six seasons, they fought to keep the show on the air without huge contracts for it's stars.  It was an ensemble piece that still lives up to the reality of the medical hospital.

St. Eligius is still remembered as the dumping ground hospital with young, aspiring doctors who work hard and long hours with little sleep. There is plenty of reality here long before it was fashionable. The cast and crew were talented, honest, candid, and above all the best. They were diverse and believable in their roles. Medical dramas today have gone more to the personal aspects of the major characters. They lost focus on the situation of it all.

St. Elsewhere spent six years struggling to stay afloat. It couldn't have been done without team work on a massive scale. They never earned the Emmy Award for Best Drama but TV Guide recognized this treasure from the past as the best of all dramas to ever air on television. I enjoyed the special features with Tim Robbins as the angry young terrorist the first few episodes; Doris Roberts as homeless bag lady Cora in an Emmy award winning performance and David Morse as the lovable Dr. Jack Morrison.

On four DVDs, they include 22 episodes with special features about ""Cora and Arnie;"" ""The place to be;"" Tim Robbins; and Dr. Jack Morrison. Watching this series again, I relived watching the brilliance of this series and pray that the powers that be release the remaining seasons on DVD.  Guest stars in the series included Doris Roberts and James Coco (Emmy winners for their performances in ""Cora and Arnie""); Tim Robbins; Ernie Sabella; Laraine Newman; Christopher Guest; Candace Cameron as Megan White; Robert Davi; Nan Martin; Elizabeth Kerr and more.",1341878400,9,2421,4.766109785202864
2615824,5,B000GPPNO2,"I dread reviews of old shows.  I read so many gilded opinions of the halcyon era du-jour for any given show.  I find that many reviewers (and I do not say this disparagingly) tend to conflate the quality of the shows they remember with wistful sentiment.  I have done that myself and therefore usually avoid reviewing older shows.  That said however, St. Elsewhere really bears out and deserves every star I can give it.  It was an unflinching, gritty, and conscientious drama about a forgotten hospital with realistically flawed, well-meaning protagonists facing the long fights of life.  It also attacked social issues with imperfect nobility and, I believe, fearless honesty.  Take, among many equally notable perfomances, Mark Harmon's rather exemplary turn as a Dr. Caldwell, a heterosexual plastic surgeon who has to contend with AIDS and that diagnosis' consequences.  Many shows have seized a moment or two of dramatic transcendence.  Very few, if any, have done it so consistently.  They really don't make them like this anymore.",1340150400,7,1038,5.161676646706587

Dr. Ehrlich was great, and I loved his interaction with Dr. Craig, who he admired and wanted to emulate. Season One was spent developing the characters, and there were some excellent shows in that first season, but I believe the later programs were much better. I especially loved the ""Time Heals"" two-parter (that was in season three or four). ""Time Heals"" revealed the background of the hospital staff, including the founder. It also shows how Dr. Westfall's early childhood experiences affected his personality. Every character was realistic, even the outlandish ones. I love this show.",1339891200,5,702,5.221238938053097

2615827,4,B000GPPNO2,"My favorite aspect of St. Elsewhere was the relationship between Ehrlich, the bright but socially clueless intern played by Ed Begley, Jr., and his mentor Dr. Mark Craig played by William Daniels.  To a large extent I enjoyed their relationship because it reminded me of my interactions with my own Ph. D. adviser! I remember the episode where Craig invited Ehrlich to a fancy party at his house, an invitation that Craig ended with the comment ""and for God's sake Ehrlich, bring a date!""  Ehrlich, naturally, has no idea how to find a date, and ends up inviting a girl who works at the hospital morgue!

In another episode, Craig tries to get through to Ehrlich by having him meet the grand old man who was Craig's own mentor.  Unfortunately, the old man had recently suffered from a severe stroke which left him almost completely mute and just a shadow of his former self.  In a touching scene, however, the old man experiences a moment of near lucidity and looks up at Craig with deep affection and croaks out ""Mark?""

2615844,5,B000GPPNO2,"Having watched St. Elsewhere when it was originally broadcast, I had been left with memories of a truly high quality series in every regard (acting, writing, and directing). Could it be as good as I had remembered?

The first episode doesn't disappoint, it's a great debut. But then, the writing stalls a bit. A suggestion for new viewers; don't bail out because of the ""tweety and ralph"" storyline, or because of uneven writing in the beginning few episodes. Once things begin to pick up, St. Elsewhere really does rise to meet the high praise it regularly receives. I'm happy to say that after watching season one, my memories of a ""great series"" were in fact correct! Truly one of the best of the 80's, and of all time.

I cannot end this review without mentioning the fact that I have never really liked E.R. or Chicago Hope, two series that perhaps owe a great debt to St. Elsewhere. A huge production and ""big names"" (producers, actors) do not always create a superior product. In fact, the simple low key approach taken by St. Elsewhere is what helps it to rise above the more ""produced"" efforts on TV.

Give St. Elsewhere a try! Don't give up after just a few episodes, watch the complete first season! I promise, you'll be yelling for the long overdue release of season two!

2615859,5,B000GPPNO2,"The only medical drama that holds up to today's standards, I believe, St. Elsewhere has what ER (another favorite of mine) lacks...humor, real personal stories outside the hospital, and continuity of plot, with ongoing stories that may range over 2 episodes. I watched St. Elsewhere growing up and so am very excited to see the release, but I truly hope they release all of the seasons, as it only gets better.
I stopped watching ER when they failed to resolve certain plot points over a few years and for the utterly ridiculous plot they concocted to kill off Dr. Romano!
Fans of ER who haven't seen St. Elsewhere might find it somewhat slow paced (especially during the emergency scenes...then it seems very slow), but what it lacks in this excitement is made up for in great story development, some good dark humor mixed in and a large and tremendously talented cast. Note a young Denzel Washington as one of the doctors, Howie Mandel (when he still had hair and was doing stand-up) is very funny as Dr. Fiscus,
Dr. Craig, the obnoxious and hugely intolerant surgeon with the stereotypical big ego, was one of my favorites and in re-viewing the show, William Daniels' portrayal of the role is fantastically funny. This stereotype re-emerged in ER as the caustic Dr. Romano, who I also couldn't get enough of.
It would take another paragraph to comment on the great other main character performances, but the role that Ed Flanders plays as Dr. Westphall is outstanding, very understated and yet very deep. The women doctors on the show deal with sexism and the juggling of career vs. mother which was, and still is, so typical of the times.
In order to see the kudos this show has received in the past and after it went off the air, you just have to look at the Wikipedia entry to see it was, and I think still is, very highly regarded.

Even though it may be a bit dated in some superficial aspects, it holds up very well today. Seeing the ensemble cast again is like visiting family and I'm still amazed at the medical accuracy (not always perfect but pretty close!).

I guess the real test of something like this is how engrossing it can be when we know what the outcome of the story lines will be. Even though I know what will happen to Peter White, watching his downward spiral under the pressures of residency (and, perhaps, basic character flaws) is as fascinating as ever.

2615869,4,B000GPPNO2,"St. Elsewhere was a great show in its heyday.  It's still a fine show though it's a bit dated in spots.  Strong writing, thoughtful acting, inventive direction and camera-work (for the time).  Terrific fun to sit and watch early performances of actors who went on to do more great work (the late Robert Pastorelli, for one) and those who probably should have had better careers than they've had (Lance Guest, for example).

What gives this DVD set a 4-star rating instead of a 5-star rating is the sad extras.  On the plus side, St. Elsewhere has closed captioning.  On the negative, there is only one episode with commentary, ""Cora and Arnie.""  And nearly all the other extras deal with this same episode or the arc of stories in which it's included!  It was a great episode and Doris Roberts (who does commentary with Mark Tinker) and the late James Coco were very credible in the title roles.  In fact, they both won well-deserved Emmys.  But there's a lot more to the season than this one episode (#4) and its three or four episode arc.

It'd be great to have commentary with William Daniels, Howie Mandel, Ed Begley, Jr., Bonnie Bartlett, etc.  There's one very slight ""Cora and Arnie"" documentary which includes some comments from David Morse, but, again, it'd be great to get some talk from a variety of people on a variety of episodes.

I don't mind the double-sided DVD's all that much, and I don't need fancy packaging.  I just want meatier extras, spread out over the entire season.  More behind-the-scenes.  The best DVD episode commentaries are those involving two or more of the cast members.  Take a look at NCIS, for example. Maybe by the time the second and later seasons of St. Elsewhere roll out, they will have beefed up the extras and gotten together a few cast members to sit together and watch 4 or 5 episodes per season.

By the way, the character who dies of AIDS, Bobby Caldwell, was played by Mark Harmon NOT Mark Hamill as one reviewer stated.  Just trying to clear things up.",1181606400,2,2004,4.626062322946176

I suppose ER fans might argue the point, but this was the show that reinvented the medical drama in much the same way Hill St. Blues reinvented the police drama.  The creators fused together a number of idiosyncratic characters into a very appealing set of stories, such as the surfer boy (Ed Beegley Jr.) stuck in a Boston hospital who had to accept the authority of the tough as nails head surgeon (William Daniels), to everybody's favorite cut-up (Howie Mandel).  The show launched many careers such as that of Denzel Washington and Mark Harmon, as well as gave well seasoned actors such as Ed Flanders and Norman Lloyd room to showcase their wonderful talents.  The cast changed over the six seasons but the show never seemed to lose its edge, as it continued to develop its characters without turning them into caricatures of themselves, which happened with shows like LA Law.

2615879,5,B000GPPNO2,"St. Elsewhere remains my absolute favorite TV show, and it even ranks high among all of the other forms of entertainment that I enjoy, like movies, music and books.  It's the first show I remember watching that achieved a certain level of realism with its characters, and that had  continuing storylines without being a soap opera.  You could watch each episode without having seen previous ones, but you were definitely rewarded if you watched each week.  It was also the first show I remember that wasn't afraid to take risks with its many characters- they weren't perfect people, and sometimes very bad things happened to them.  St. Elsewhere was intelligent but highly entertaining TV, and it (and Hill Street Blues) paved the way for some excellent shows today that maintain similar standards.

And so I've waited for a long time for St. Elsewhere to be on DVD.  I'm not disappointed, but the first season is definitely different from later years.  I don't remember much of the first two seasons, but it seems to me that the show hit its stride in year two and peaked in it third and fourth seasons.  The first season is very good, but the characters haven't been developed quite as well as they would later, and its hard to be invested in some of them knowing that they would disappear after the first season with no explanation.  Also, some of the storylines (especially those involving the psychiatric wing of the hospital) seem silly and unrealistic- almost more like something out of a sitcom than from a serious drama.

Still, though, this is where it all started and it's clear that the groundwork was being laid for a great show.  Minor details mentioned here will become major storylines later on, and events that impact characters now will play even bigger roles later.  There are many genuinely emotional and dramatic moments, as well as interesting and well-written stories about medical cases and, more importantly, about the personal lives of the employees at St. Eligius.

It would have been nice to have more extras, as other reviewers have mentioned, but I'm glad that the first season is fully intact (although it seems like they did substitute some of the songs- that is definitely not Bruce Springsteen singing ""Born to Run"" in the first episode).  It's frustrating that there is no word yet on future seasons, but hopefully sales will be enough that we'll get the complete show in a relatively short period of time.",1170201600,14,2441,4.834134615384615

And the other thing...

What a pity that they aren't releasing the rest of the shows. This is only the first season. Considering that this show originally aired 25 years ago, I think it's time.

All that aside, the acting, the writing and character development and plot lines is all abso-galootely first rate.

2615882,5,B000GPPNO2,"St. Elsewhere was probably my favorite TV show in the 1980s. Each year, when low ratings placed it at risk of cancellation, I waited anxiously to see if the network would renew the show just because they liked it--which, as  I recall, happened once or twice.

But when the axe finally fell, I used to hope that I would see reruns on obscure cable channels. This rarely occurred. And so I waited until they decided to release it as a DVD.

Now they have. And it was worth waiting for.

It is remarkable how many then-edgy issues showed up on St. Elsewhere from day one: mental illness, breast cancer, the alienation of physicians, you name it. It is also astonishing how politically incorrect it was. For example, from the first moments of the first episode, we meet Dr. MArk Craig, chief of surgery, a martinet and a big-time bigot. The racist comments he makes to his Indian anesthesiologist are enough to make you blush.

But the greatest joy is to see the original cast. What a group! This was the launch pad for Denzel Washington's career; and you can see how, even then, he exuded an intensity that was remarkable for such a young actor. Then there was Howie Mandel, a lovable clown then, and a lovable clown now.

Among the interns who were the focus of the first season, there was a big emphasis on Jack Morrison, played by David Morse. What timing! If you happen to watch House these days, you can see an older Morse playing a detective--who is bound and determined to bring a doctor to justice!

One of the best features I like is that the episodes all have closed captioning or subtitles.  Having poor hearing this has been a big plus when it comes to watching this series.  This feature has prevented me from enjoying some of the other series I like, such as Homicide - Life on the Streets.

Of any of the shows from this period this should be a must one to have.

As I watch the first season shows I keeping thinking to the ending of the final show which probably has one of the most memorable endings.

2615897,5,B000GPPNO2,"Every single medical drama that is on the air today has directly stolen its style and pathos from St. Elsewhere.  Gray's Anatomy might be considered a very weak, but updated version of St. Elsewhere.  St. Elsewhere set so many standards it wasn't even funny.  Always struggling in the ratings and always changing and evolving, the show never settled in one place.  Characters came and went, plot lines came back when you least expected them, and experimentation was the rule of the day.

  Season one set a style and tone that did not last in the following seasons.  Here you see more chit chat and a faster pace (if you can believe it) than seasons 2 on.  It's nice to see commentaries and some special features on the DVD vs. just the shows.  The quality of the DVD is acceptable but the grain is quite visible especially in the pilot episode and that's discouraging. They could have footed the bill for cleanup.",1167264000,15,914,4.62111801242236
2615898,3,B000GPPNO2,"Firstly, my star rating has to do with the quality of the DVD and not the show. The show despite the shoddy treatment on DVD is still engaging and holds up after 20+ years (very few Dramas can say that!) The DVD quality however, sigh. The picture isn't great and the sound is kind of fuzzy/tinny. The menu maze is kind of tedious. I prefer a ""play all"" feature, which this DVD does not have. Also, I'm not crazy about the dual disc either.

The special features are okay but not great considering folks have been waiting so long for this DVD collection's release. Little stingy.

I hope that the next seasons' release will have better features, better picture quality and better sound quality.

picture: 3 stars

I'm sounding melodramatic, I know, but this show means so much to so many. I don't really care about the 2 sided discs and the lack of all the ""Bells and Whistles"". It's the show that counts. After waiting all these years and seeing so much crap released on DVD, I can only hope and pray Fox gives us all 6 seasons and 137 episodes.

2615900,4,B000GPPNO2,"St. Elsewhere is viewed by critics as one of the best TV shows ever produced.  The accolades are deserved.  All the shows since - ER, Grey's Anatomy, Chicago Hope and others - have roots in St. Elsewhere, the show that set the standard for combining hospital drama and comedy.

As a teenager I came late to the table and was only able to view about two thirds of the original shows. However, I was able to record on VHS almost all of the shows I did see.  I was excited when I heard they were going to (finally!) release the show on DVD and I could, at last, watch all the early episodes I had missed.

So here we have one of the most acclaimed shows ever and what we get is a flimsy slip case, double sided DVDs (that easily become scratched), and minimal extras.  This is the treatment they give shows like Different Strokes or Emergency.  St. Elsewhere, of any of the 80s shows, deserved the kind of treatment they give The Simpsons or CSI.

Imagine what they could have done if they'd packaged the entire show like they did the complete West Wing.  Imagine a first aid box with the St. Elsewhere logo.  Inside would have been a DVD set for each season.  Single sided DVDs with images of the cast on each one.  The extras would have included interviews with all the cast members, background on the St. Elsewhere theme song, a documentary on where they shot St. Elsewhere (and where exterior shots were filmed in Boston), a where are they now documentary on the cast, and lots lots more.

Intead we get this.  I bought this set.  And I'll buy the others when they get released.  But what a rip-off.  St. Elsewhere - and its fans - deserved better than this.",1165536000,149,1659,4.369281045751634

Love Howie Mandel's commentary and the one from David Morse.  No show will ever match St. Elsewhere, and whenever I hear anyone talk about ER, my only response is...It isn't, never was, and never will be...St. Elsewhere.

So, when is Season 2 coming out???",1165449600,12,429,4.821917808219178
2615902,5,B000GPPNO2,"Just got finished with the first half of St. Elsewhere and I have to say now I understand all the hoopla surrounding it. I was just a kid when this first aired and I missed all the episodes, but can remember the familiar opening soundtrack when my parents used to turn it on. Now I'm playing catch up. Having watched ER faithfully over the years, I thought I would be disappointed by such an outdated medical drama. But I was wrong. After the first episode, I was hooked. It was a refreshing change to the graphic and violent shows on the tube today. The acting is top notch not to mention fun to watch, Denzel and Howie before they became household names and story lines are revelant and just as gripping as those on ER. I especially like the Dr. Morrison character who reminds me of Dr. Green on the latter, the compassionate and steadfast doctor who puts his patients first. It's comparable to ER's portrayal of harried residents who don't get much sleep and have to choose between work and family, much like the Dr. White character who loses his marriage and nearly his soul to his work. I also got a kick out of all the technology available at the time: cluncky computer terminals, enormous EKG machines,the procedures, and all the 80s hair, music, and clothes. Much of what goes on in hospitals isn't sugarcoated here, the episode where Dr. White lies to a grieving family to obtain a needless autopsy tore at me, especially when he says to his boss, ""I just raped that family,"" is heartrending not to mention shocking. Many episodes are laced with black humor but nothing profane or offensive. It's a quality show that deserved the praise it garnered and it's certainly a trip down memory lane to the days when NBC actually aired great shows worth watching. It's a testement to Brandon Tartikoff who greenlighted such programming..when he died it all went straight to hell...can hardly wait till the second season...",1165363200,10,1923,4.67551622418879

Mark Harmon's character passed away from it. at the Time Mark Harmon was seen as the Guy who would blow up on the bigger screen.

I was in my 20's, living in the city, and I would blow off a night of clubbing to stay home and watch it (the only TV show I would ever do this for). It really had a heart and soul.  It was also very funny in places.  Some of the scenes have really stuck with me like when Dr. Craig yelled at Dr. Ehrlich during heart surgery telling him, ""Watch what your are doing, your are not cutting a roast here!""

2615912,5,B000GPPNO2,"It's hard to say how well this show will stand up to the test of time.  It's been a long time since I've seen an episode, and I know that dramas in particular don't always hold up well a generation later.  I LOVE LUCY, MASH, THE HONEYMOONERS can still make us laugh and appreciate their brilliance.  Dramas like HILL STREET BLUES often are more nostalgic than actually still engrossing.

I have high hopes for ST. ELSEWHERE because 1) it was head and shoulders above the rest when it aired, 2) it had a brilliant cast...and not just Denzel Washington, David Morse or Alfre Woodard (who all went on to more famous film careers), but pretty much every other person in the show was at the top of their games.

I remember how cutting-edge they were, particularly in dealing with AIDS.  First regular TV show I can remember where a patient had AIDS.  And I remember how freaked out everyone was by him.  First show in which a major character (Mark Harmon) died from AIDS.  And remember how there was a rapist running around the hospital as well?  And remember that it turned out to be a major character?  Not many shows will go down that road today.

I remember lots of humor, and lots of pathos.  I'm sure it doesn't have the blinding pace of ER...but ER would not have existed without ST. ELSEWHERE.  (And ER's pace isn't always a good thing...sometimes I can't understand what everyone is saying on that show!)  But it told interesting stories, and it had recurring characters you CARED about.  In so many dramas with large casts today...you don't find yourself investing much concern in what happens to the characters...you're just trying to keep up with them all.  ST. ELSEWHERE managed to juggle so many people, and yet they were all flesh and blood.  This was due to great writing, cutting edge topics and BRILLIANT ACTING.

So I'll be placing my order for this trip down memory lane.  With all the lousy shows that have been released on DVD...it's more than high time to visit St. Eligius!!",1161648000,81,1993,4.607954545454546
