2828082,5,B000PTYP6G,"Just saw a preview of this movie last night. It was fantastic. Just like the movie ""The Secret"", which it acknowledges for the concept of the Law of Attraction, this movie features little inspirational messages from people who are motivators and do-ers in our modern culture. It was fast paced, high energy and it left me with wanting to go out and achieving the success that i deserve and am capable of. Which I believe is a goal of the movie. I'd definitely recommend this movie.",1180656000,15,481,4.604651162790698

8193284,5,B000PTYP6G,"I think i'm going to order this one again, as I've lost the one i've have for years. I have watched this movie about 5 or more times. I will continue to watch it many times a year. It is great. It is not as flashy as the Secret, but I like it better. There is none of that ""We are our own god"" type of thing here. But they hit some great points, especially about finding a Mentor. And Brian Tracy is in here, he's the man. This movie and the Secret will be the ones I watch a lot. This one seems more practicable tho. I love it.",1397347200,,528,3.809090909090909
8193285,4,B000PTYP6G,If your looking for the secret this is not it but it has alot of what I did I found mentors and then became one for others so I liked it if I would not have figured it out on my own I would still be digging ditches...,1368316800,,217,3.5416666666666665
8193286,5,B000PTYP6G,"A must see for anyone that is looking for or is already on their path to success and happiness. This will be a DVD that you should watch at least once a month. It will help you to brainstorm your current steps on your path to what you want to achieve in your life.
Great DVD!",1314403200,5,275,3.9285714285714284
8193287,2,B000PTYP6G,"There is some good info but as someone who has watched ""The Secret"" at least 100 times I have watched this about twice. It did not inspire me.

And I'm not one of those people that just try to manifest things without taking action (while that is possible and I have done it myself) as I also spend thousands of Dollars a year on marketing and business courses.

Let's face it ""The Secret"" was one of a kind and I am referring to the Original version with Ester Hicks. I give it 5 stars and the Extended version falls to about 3 stars. There have been several movies modeled after it but none have captured the magic of 'The Secret""

If you can rent it or you are a collector like me that buys all motivational DVD's because I'd rather watch them that TV shows that bombard me with Drug Company commercial and post hypnotic suggestions for illness get it but don't expect to be blown away!",1243468800,6,888,4.3053892215568865
8193288,2,B000PTYP6G,"I was surprised at how little I was moved by this movie, based on most of the good reviews.  The lower budget special effects did not bother me, as it was edited well.  The first half of the film seemed to be a cheesy business training film, geared toward MLM mindsets.  The Secret?  this really has nothing to do with the Secret - just because they toss in the phrase Law of Attraction, hoping to get some of that crowd of admirers.  One theory they mention is you will always be as wealthy as your five closest friends. One ""go-getter"" states after having combined the average income of his five closest friends, he realizes he 'needed new friends'.  Yes, we all get what you are trying to convey - surround yourself with positive and amibtious people.  But the way this comment plays is shocking, shallow, and really a reflection of what the film is about.  This statement alone contradicts the idea of mentoring and kindness that also comes up.  Additionally, to those who believe it's about the Secret/Law of Attraction, I'd like to point out the producers constantly let the idea of struggle rise to the surface in the movie.  ""There will be hardships"", ""You will fail"" etc.  Anyone who understands the elements of the Law of Attraction would find this movie is far off base from that.

However, this would be a great film for a very cyncial no-nonense type who loathes anything new-agey.  It could be a good stepping stone to other philosophies about creating the life you desire.  In summary, if you are well-versed in Abraham-Hicks, Tony Robbins, and Michael Loisier, you would most likely find this is a waste of your money.",1203811200,17,1634,4.6678321678321675
8193289,1,B000PTYP6G,"After seeing The Secret I was excited to hear about this movie.  I was under the false impression, though, that it was a sequel to The Secret.  It isn't.

For me, it seemed as though the production was lacking funds.  The background seemed Star War-ish and cheesy.  The interviews with the actors were more like quick sound bites. I gave this one away.",1199145600,3,352,4.523809523809524
8193290,5,B000PTYP6G,"As a Life Coach I feel this production gives a person solid steps to put into action a ""life makeover"" of their choosing.  It is clearly presented with a great deal of information packed into it.  It is ""The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People"" times ten!  You can watch it over and over again, as you put into practice each of the areas addressed.  NO Hollywood production hype claiming ancient secrets, rather simple presentation of time tested and successful concepts.",1186876800,8,471,4.777777777777778
8193291,5,B000PTYP6G,This movie puts out a great message. This is the way I have learned to live and it absolutely chaged my life. This movie does a great job of reenforcing what I am already doing or helping otheres to understand how they can change their own lives.,1182816000,6,246,4.25531914893617
