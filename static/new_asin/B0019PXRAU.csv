I only wish I had archived and fanatically collected the illustrated tracts.  Ray Bradbury told me that he saved every single thing that appeared in his mailbox, for historical reference.",1430265600,,329,4.945454545454545

8274947,3,B0019PXRAU,"I think it could of being so much better. The life of Mr. Chick is a celebration of God's goodness and His desire to save all through His Son Jesus Christ. And there is no other way, according to GOD Himself. Unfortunately there were very few who understood among those who gave testimony (or maybe they were not allowed to say what they really think).

I can sum up Mr. Chick's life like this:

(Psalm 33:4 KJV)  For the word of the LORD is right; and all his works are done in truth.

and

(Psalm 40:10 KJV)  I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy loving-kindness and thy truth from the great congregation.

The work of Mr. Chick is backed by GOD Himself, it is the Truth of the Word of GOD.

One young man called Mr. Chick's work a hate speech, not even realizing, that this was exactly what he himself was doing right at that moment. The same spirit comes from most of reviews, it stinks! People believe what they want to believe and they don't allow the Truth stand on their way. And it will cost them dearly. Deception is a primary weapon of our enemy. You can recognize and eliminate the deception only by the Truth of God's Word as It is.

(Rev 6:15 KJV)  And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains;

(Rev 6:16 KJV)  And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:

(Rev 6:17 KJV)  For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?

When you want to help people to get saved and warn them about impending judgment of GOD, and by doing so jeopardizing your own life and life of your family, wouldn't it be an act of love? But some want to call it ""hate"". How bizarre is that?",1330214400,5,1952,4.181818181818182
8274948,5,B0019PXRAU,"I watched the 2 minute free preview of this movie and noticed they use the car / train crash scene from Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry at the beginning of this movie. What's funny is the parts that were different and leading up to the car crash I kept thinking to myself ""That's just like the car from Diry Mary Crazy Larry. Then I saw the train and trought ""and it's going to hit a train just like the car in Dirty Mary and Crazy Larry"" and then when it hit the train, the car exploded and crashed exactly the same as the one in Dirty Mary Crazy Larry. They had simply edited the graphics to make it look different but it was the same.",1311292800,,629,4.080645161290323
8274949,4,B0019PXRAU,"This is a somewhat light-hearted, low budget documentary about those little comic book religious tracts you sometimes find in big cities... on park benches, at bus stops, in public restrooms or phone booths. They are left by many well meaning people, produced by an independent fundamentalist publishing veteran known as Jack T. Chick (yes, that's his real name).

Watching this documentary, you'll come to appreciate the colorful history of these comic books, the conspiracy theorists that fuel the many theories present in the tracts (and the full color comics) and, agree with him or not, come to understand a bit of the mindset behind the ""crusade"" of its primary writer and artist, the man himself (who declines to appear in the documentary).

These comic books target a variety of groups (including Jews, Catholics, ""liberal"" Protestants, pagans, witches, homosexuals, Mormons, Masons, Hindus, Muslims, etc).

Chick Comics are a part of pop culture, as much as they are of American religious culture.

Check out this documentary!",1272067200,7,1035,5.2926829268292686
8274950,5,B0019PXRAU,"A solid piece of work- entertaining and informative.  While it is clear that the director is no fundamentalist, I was impressed by his even-handedness.  Plus, the interview segments with Rev. Stang were hilarious.  Recommended!",1258502400,8,227,5.617647058823529
8274951,4,B0019PXRAU,"God's Cartoonist: The Comic Crusade of Jack Chick (Kurt Kuersteiner, 2008)

We move from an artist whose work is so ambivalent that thirty years after his death people are arguing over his motivations in drawing it (cf. In the Realms of the Unreal, above) to a guy who has spent the last thirty years and more creating work whose lack of ambivalence has turned him into, depending on your point of view, either a champion or a demon. This is Jack T. Chick, the man responsible for the hundreds of little, free, Christian comic books that you find lying around everywhere. (Actually, twenty years ago I used to find them lying around everywhere; I saw one a few weeks ago in a public restroom and couldn't remember the last time I'd seen one previously.) If you've read through any of them, you know the hardline fundamentalist approach they take and the urban legends they perpetuate (or, possibly, created). Thus the dichotomy, and the fact that few who know who Jack Chick is don't have a strong opinion of him.

Chick is a notoriously reclusive individual, which has prevented documentaries from being made bout him; this is the first, and true to form, Chick does not appear. (Even the most recent photo the filmmaker was able to come up with is almost half a century old.) Instead, Kuersteiner (Church of the Subgenius: Sect, Satire, or Satanism?) traces the history of Chick tracts, scoring interviews with some of Chick's friends and Chick Publications' employees, as well as Chick tract collectors and, of course, a few detractors. The director goes for a balanced view, and (kind of surprisingly in my view, given that no one seems to have a neutral opinion on the man) seems to achieve it.

Very interesting if you know who the guy is. If not, maybe not as much, but he's worth knowing about, either as hero or as demon. Check it out. *** ",1248739200,16,1849,4.68
