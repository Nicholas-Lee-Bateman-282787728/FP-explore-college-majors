2697609,5,B000KW4HG6,This is a great film revealing the truth behind the Watchtower.  It is balanced in approach and topic.  It is very informative and educational regarging the present and historical status of the JW's.,1200096000,13,199,5.0
2697610,5,B000KW4HG6,"I tell you, this documentary really does bring a tear to my eye- especially me having family being JW's.  It really shows you how the religion is a Cult.  They show you PROOF!  This movie is a must see!",1186444800,10,202,4.128205128205129
2697620,5,B000KW4HG6,"Just simply wanted to learn more about religion and as to see why they come and insist their religion is the right one. Suggest this, if you want to know the truth about the JW",1335484800,3,176,4.057142857142857
2697621,4,B000KW4HG6,"What is needed to know about Jehovah's Witnesses appears on this DVD presentation ""in a NUTSHELL in less than 60 Minutes"", from the Novice, up.

The DVD seemingly arouse from the consequences commencing from ""1975 Internal Upheaval and Restructure"" that occurred in that year and as a subsequent result of a number of events that formulated the ""Policy"" to uphold those changes despite knowing in that year that their so called ""Governing Body"" was Principled Unscriptural and hence that restructure was erred Biblically.

That ""Upheaval and Restructure"" is detailed on pages 80-110 in the Fourth Edition of the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crisis-of-Conscience/dp/0914675230/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crisis of Conscience</a>

As a consequence the question ""Is the Watchtower Society and it's Governing Body appointed by God"" as claimed arises? The DVD takes an in depth look at the ""Recorded History"" of the Watchtower Society in relation to it's reliant claims that (it is) ""God's Spirit Appointed Organization"" and (proves) ""it could NOT BE.""

In addition it looks at some real life examples of what happened to a select few of Jehovah's Witnesses whom questioned directly to it's ""Governing Body"" or in private some long held teachings. One example is contained in the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Gentile-Times-Reconsidered/dp/0914675079/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Gentile Times Reconsidered</a>&nbsp;in which the author sent in his thesis to the ""Governing Body"" which is contained within this book which ""questioned the 1914 date of Christ's so called Presence"" as being inconsistent with the scientific record and Bible, of which so much Jehovah's Witness authority hinges upon, ""does not exist."" He had hoped if they were from God they would make the needed changes. For his trouble he was threatened not to talk to any within his congregation and eventually disfellowshipped and the Policy put in place to Silence him by effecting that NO OTHER Witnesses were allowed to talk with him or they risked Disfellowshipping. Eventually this Policy spread to any whom had questions about the Watchtower teachings effectively removing all whom had doubts whether what was being taught actually came from God or rather, ""MEN."" Compare principle at Matthew 15:9 whether applies and ""their worship in vain""?

Raymond Franz also appears briefly on this DVD and makes the observation that ""the ORGANIZATION IS EVERYTHING"" herein lies the problem in entrenched thinking. If any are to even prove the error they are dismissed on this false concept that the Organization is used by God and it ONLY will be used to direct what is meant by the Bible. Hence the hard hitting DVD proves how the Organization is inconsistent with being used by the ""Loving God of the Bible"" as his Organization which Jehovah's Witnesses should at least re-view the evidence. If they are truly in the truth then it will stand up to scrutiny.

DVD uses a simply process of what the Watchtower said and what took place so the viewer can ""make their own mind over."" It's ideal for those whom want a ""relatively short presentation"" only lasting less than One Hour to get a ""Snap Shot"" of what the History is indicating whether The Organization is from God and to give sufficent presentation to answer the above question then this Video is a good Prima as a starting point to give sufficent information.

It also exposes the methods used and the sad consequences on families lives and (how the Watchtower conceals all this from the Rank and File) whom may suspect but are told the Elders are used to keep the congregation clean in which this Video shows what will happen to them if they cross the Watchtower Policy Line or Rules. I'm unsure what the title ""Witnesses of Jehovah"" is meant to imply but one can discern he could hardy approve of such ""loveless policies"". It's a (Wake Up Call) in a ""Nutshell"" to all honest Jehovah's Witnesses brave enough to view this Video (and not fear men), whilst it helps those whom have left what is and was behind what may have happened to them? It also may open up a new way in which to understand Matthew 24:48-51 and reverse current Watchtower teaching to apply to themselves? The video is as relevant to-day as when made for the reason the practises to-day originated with the details contained within this video. It also may help outsiders better understand Jehovah's Witnesses and the complex issues concealed from most. Compare Luke 12:2

My only concerns is that later in the DVD it gives an example of the effects of JW's children being lonely at school due to the fact of the ""Bad Association Principle"" being asked be applied by Witness children. There was no explanation whether this violated scripture merely implied it was unloving that this is a Watchtower Teaching. When the parent went and saw the teacher things improved. It seems this section was included to play on ""Sympathy"". ""Balance and mutual respect often resolves any difficulty."" It also gives an example of a boy whom committed immorality with a woman and the effects that resulted. I think this is a difficult issue and the Watchtower Policy certainly contributed but at the same time ""two wrongs don't make a right."" Perhaps on this issue if the teaching of C.T. Russell presented in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Studies-In-The-Scriptures-The-New-Creation-Millennial-Dawn/dp/B004GNFIW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Studies In The Scriptures: The New Creation (Millennial Dawn)</a>&nbsp;were followed none of what happened may have occurred. What this indicates is C. T. Russell's internal congregation teachings would never allowed the ""harsh loveless marking and disfellowshipping policy of to-day"" to occur. Hence on this point it need's to be clarified it's MODERN Watchtower Policy and ""Not That of OLD,"" at least not in Russell's day that contributed. This is why gave 4 stars and not 5.

So as ""not to stumble anybody"", mention the above Studies in the Scriptures: The New Creation Volume VI dealt with ""in part"" what was perceived ""correct scriptural procedure within the congregation"", not to be confused with ""Prophecy Date Setting"" or ""Time Prophecies"" which the DVD exposed as ""Coming and Passing Having Not Come True."" The New World Translation of the Bible assures us page 1650 giving the ""Rule to determine false prophets"" being Deuteronomy 18:20-22; Luke 6:26. Only one problem The Watchtower Society is exempt from this Rule because they never allow it to be applied to themselves, but others.

Who really is the ""False Prophet in a NUTSHELL is revealed in less than 60 minutes"", to those whom care to examine the evidence presented in this Hard Hitting Exposure for all to see? Luke 12:2.

What all the above does however serve to indicate the current Policies are NOT FROM GOD, neither is the Organization and it's Governing Body. The DVD proves this by what was taught and what took place thereafter. It's sad but the evidence can hardly lead to ANY OTHER CONCLUSION if persons set aside any pre-judged prejudices.",1319241600,3,7175,5.296133567662566
2697622,5,B000KW4HG6,"i appreciated the 1st review as it was compelling and i felt the person who wrote it
to be rational. as for 2nd review christine seemed to be reacting in anger to the truth
and did not want to hear another perspective, she felt her opinion was all that counted

2697623,5,B000KW4HG6,This is a good video to watch if you have questions on who JW are. As a former witness I found no false information or over the top sensationalism.,1298764800,5,147,4.103448275862069
2697624,4,B000KW4HG6,Great DVD a little dated but very helpful .I have a lot of family who are are Jehovahs Witnesses but not Of Christ Acts 1:8.  So it was an encouragement and a blessing to see Ex witnesses actualy speaking the Truth .Awesome,1293148800,2,223,4.309523809523809
2697625,5,B000KW4HG6,"I saw this online, I liked it so much I bought it.
It was made in the 80's but it's still relevant today.
It really is a candid look into this religion.

On the DVD you have a choice of English or Spanish soundtrack.

The Watchtower Society is a cult (no doubts about it) anyone thinking of joining should run for their lives, I was a JW for 30 years. Wasted my life with this crackpot bunch of loonies.
They believe their leaders in NY speak for God, soon God will destroy all the earth and ONLY the few million JWs will enter a edenic utopia paradise, petting lions and eating fruit. What a bunch of BS!",1286928000,4,605,4.162393162393163
2697626,5,B000KW4HG6,As an ex-JW this is a real eye opener about the lies of the JW org. Any JW that wants to meet the real Jehovah needs to watch this movie. Seek the LORD while you still can!!,1231372800,7,173,3.7027027027027026
2697627,5,B000KW4HG6,"I highly recommend this very informative documentary especially for anyone anticipating becoming a JW, for those who were in this cult, for those who have friends and/or relatives who are JWs, and for Christians in general who wish to educate themselves into the ""ins and outs"" of this religion.

As an ex-JW and as one who's viewed this film many times, I say to you don't let the smiling faces at the front door fool you.  Satan also, no doubt, smiled as he tempted the first couple in the Garden to disobey God.  He uses, through this cult, similar tactics to sway helpless, lonely, depressed and despondent people into being sucked into this outwardly attractive yet dangerously deceptive and unkind, oppressive cult.
This film unlocks the truth behind those wolves in sheeps' clothing, ever ready to trap any unsuspecting soul.

This documentary should serve as solid proof that the Watchtower organization constitutes nothing short of spiritual rape.....the fruits of which are devastating.",1223337600,22,996,5.12962962962963
2697628,5,B000KW4HG6,"Greetings people,
This is a great dvd. I guess the end of the world is going to happen in 1914. Oh, that's right, we passed 1914. So now they're saying that Christ returned invisibly, and only the eyes of understanding were able to see Him. But I thought Jesus said that ALL will see Him, even the ones who pierced Him. Rev. 1-7 But now it's 1915, 1918, 1925. Oh yeah, 1925 Joseph Rutherford purchased a mansion in San Diego for when Abraham, Issac and Jacob return from the dead, they would have a place to live. It's in the book, ""Millions now living will never die.""I have this book. On page 89 you will see this stuff. The dude Rutherford lived and died in it. He was a drunk who died from colon cancer in 1942. 1941,1975. Hehe, I have the original copy of the Awake! magazine. 1968 it talks about 1975. I know of people who sold all that they had for this date. 1999 is another date, but they keep saying that they're God's organization, his prophet on earth. Yeah right! OOOPS, sorry, my bad.",1220572800,11,998,4.3138297872340425

The only way to find out the truth about something is going to the source and finding out for yourself. I have done my own investigation about JWs. Obviously the people who made this film are 'JW haters' that don't KNOW ANYTHING. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.... Instead get some Britney Spears CD's!",1210809600,27,397,4.527777777777778

The bible of new world translation is updated and easy to understand (2013 edition) it does have a language that is very easy to understand ( no Latin words and such). If you google the word hallelujah it will show the meaning of it. Jehova attracts people by their hearts and give them the freedom to choose their way, now if angels went knocking on your door you most certainly would open for them &?youd hear their message. We are just imitating Jesus. Look at any bible and it will show the map of his travels. He was a humble man and a carpenter. Our publications are free and very good quality.
