1736060,5,B00006A8T3,"Le Carre's classic of cold war espionage and betrayal is brilliantly realized in this BBC production. The cast featuring Sir Alec Guinness, Ian Richardson and Ian Bannen is nothing short of a miracle. Shot on film to provide a look and feel appropriate to the gravitas and intrigue of the plot, this series rises far above the banalities customary in made-for-TV drama.

This is storytelling out of another era, and not likely to appeal to those accustomed to the quick-cut, action-packed, short attention span pablum spewed out by the studios these days. Tinker Tailor takes its time to build the tension to its climax and actually makes you think.

The interview with Le Carre on the DVD set is interesting. I wish they had also included his interview done for the original 1979 PBS airing with Robert MacNeil. I have the original interview on tape and it's illuminating to see how Le Carre's regard of his own work has evolved over the decades.",1091491200,7,947,4.803680981595092
1736061,5,B00006A8T3,"What else can be said that has not already been said about this great series?

All I can add to it is emotions.

I came away with an incredible sense of sadness.  Sadness for the real life agents of MI-6, LeCarre, and British Life in general. The iron fist in the iron glove friendship that was heart breaking.  George Smiley was the saddest figure of all.

Like Rumpole, totally unappreicated and unloved, yet the most worthy of figures.",1091491200,2,438,4.564102564102564
1736062,5,B00006A8T3,"Sometime in the early 80's in New York I was working on something and looked up at the TV because I knew I recognized that man speaking ... who is that?  Oh right!  That's George Smiley!  What's he doing on TV?
Guinness captures Smiley so perfectly, so completely, that it was the character I recognized and not the actor. Only then, of course, did the penny drop and I realized what I was watching.  It's among my top 5 favorite novels of all time, and this production fully captures the delightfully intricate plot-within-plot-within-plot.
The casting is exemplary and the acting and direction are superb examples of what one has come to, if not expect then certainly hope for from the land of the RSC.
If you know the books, you will not be disappointed.  Stop reading this and click on ""add to your cart"".
Several years ago I discovered this production on PAL video (not NTSC as we use here in the States).  I unhesitatingly purchased a universal VHS machine solely so that I could watch this series, which I purchased from Amazon UK.  I've watched it lovingly perhaps 6 times.
Anybody wanna buy some used tapes? :-)",1090108800,15,1120,4.626262626262626
1736063,5,B00006A8T3,"Excellent TV series.  Production on DVD runs almost 6 hours on 3 DVDs.  Every actor in this production can actually act.  Worth the purchase price just to see Guinness.  If you have not read the book, go ahead and watch the DVD, read the book, then watch the DVD again.  They are complimentary, neither the book nor the DVD spoil each other.  It was originally a TV series, so don't expect excellent video quality or wide screen, it was shot in the late 70's for tv.",1087171200,6,466,4.3604651162790695
1736064,4,B00006A8T3,"Le Carre is not Tom Clancy.  I happen to like them both, but this is espionage like it probably really is.  A slow political chess game.",1085443200,2,136,4.1923076923076925
1736065,5,B00006A8T3,"The opening shot sets the tone of the entire six hours. We see a dingy meeting room in an old London office building. The radiators are indiscretely visible, the paint is peeling off the walls, the lone cabinet looks creaky. Through the windows we see it's a cold grey day. A man sits at the table smoking a cigarette; he is soon joined by a second who sits diagonally opposite him. A third man arrives with a tea cup, saucer over the cup to keep the contents from splashing. A fourth man smoking a pipe arrives, sits at the head of the table sets down a folder and opens. The scene has lasted a minute, it was silent, no music was heard, though the first man coughed once or twice. The last man then says ""We are ready to begin"" and low horns begin sounding the theme music. This is director John Irvin's idea of a quick scene!
Later scenes move much more methodically, and involve long conversations about the plot, but that are framed beginning and end with chit-chat about the wife and the cottage. There is some action, but we almost feel it interferes with the plot and we want to get back to those conversations that contain the gold dust we need to sift out of the polite exchanges.
Alec Guinness is perfect as George Smiley. Slow and methodical and illustrating GS's quirks and mannerisms perfectly. Notice how often he takes off his glasses and wipes them clean. The rest of the cast performs admirably. On my first viewing, they had managed to hide some truly difficult dialogue (e.g. ""Now, Young Mr. Guillam, are you happy in Brixton?"" le Carre's weakness is realistic dialogue, for all his realism elsewhere) and turn them around into believable expressions of character.
Finally it seems the weather improved the production no end. Many of the scenes were filmed outdoors during the third coldest recorded winter since WWII. The actors were cold and were genuinely oppressed by particularly rotten English weather. This added to an already realistic production.
Highly highly recommended.",1084838400,169,2002,4.739255014326647
1736066,3,B00006A8T3,"I re-ordered Tinker, Tailor--fortunately!  I was convinced by that one response that I had indeed received a faulty copy.  It is a wonderful production, every  bit as exciting as the book, and just as I remembered the original broadcase those many years ago.  Too bad no one made a film version of Honourable Schoolboy--that's the best written, I think.  And a far more important part of the Karla story than many people credit it for being.",1083974400,9,441,4.75
1736067,5,B00006A8T3,"One of the most wildly atmospheric, brilliantly put together spy stories.  Alec Guiness, already amongst my favourite actors of all time provides the standard for this very english (as it should be) adaptation.  In fact i can't wait for their version of Smileys People comes out on DVD, as i cannot imagine a better Circus and crew to trawl through the dank past of English Espionage.
Know this, if you love La Carre you must possess this DVD.",1080950400,6,443,4.666666666666667
1736068,5,B00006A8T3,"As other reviews have stated this is a tightly scripted, reasonably true to Le Carre's original, cold war, spy thriller. That said, it is also so much more than that. Even if you are not usually one to be impressed by filmic attempts to capture books (as in the book is always better!), attempts to film Le Carre's books authentically, mini-series, attempts to tell spy/cold-war stories w/o lots of booms and blood you should give this set a try. The characters are real, the camera work is of the stuff to be a textbook, the directing is superbe and the editing is of the highest standard. The DVD itself is an improvement over the VHS version but this is broadcast TV and in 4:3. Still there is almost NOTHING to criticise here (unless you've just GOT to have the noise and gore!). Yes it is 324 minutes long but each episode is so well done you can literally watch them out of order and they each make a great evening's viewing. What other mini-series can that be said of? Among the best the the BBC have done and they usually get this type of stuff as well as anyone. An excellent choice for discussion groups, film students, etc, etc. Can I come up with a real criticism? Well the box is dull and there's no directors blather or such but this is among the best you can get for the full price. At a discount it almost makes one feel guilty. What a wonderful study piece for any aspiring actor, director, editor, or just blokes like me who like to pretend we're British every now and then. Buy this one!",1080345600,20,1506,4.382142857142857

1736124,5,B00006A8T3,"A great book deserves a great television adaptation and this series delivers on all counts.  The cast is brilliant, including Ian Richardson, later to become the villain in the original (and far superior) ""House of Cards"" trilogy, and Alec Guinness is magnificent as the overworked, underappreciated master spy who has the worst crisis in MI 6 history to contend with.  The best part is that this story is based on historic events, which makes the sense of urgency to find the mole even more palpable.",1513987200,,501,4.882352941176471
1736125,5,B00006A8T3,I saw it for the first time on the BBC.  Years later I bought the DVD.  A few years later I stupidly loaned it to someone and I hadn't seen it in a few years.  So I replaced it from you!!!  I Claudius is still my favorite BBC production but TTSS is a close 2nd!  I highly recommend this DVD.

Also my memory was that it was longer in duration than just the material presented here.

However, it could be I'm subconsciously adding bits from of the sequel to it, or forgetting my having had to wait in between episodes when it was originally on TV. - Whatever, the cast & story is still wonderful, as is the realization, with Alec Guiness establishing an unforgettable portrayal of Smiley.

I do not like his style in print, but they are really great stories so I can enjoy the story in the form that I enjoy.  I have seen both the old and the new versions.  I have no problem with Gary Oldman...I just thought the Alec Guinness version was better.  It is the same story, just who one likes best as actors and I like the people in the older version better.  I love the story in both versions.  GREAT STORY.",1511913600,2,572,4.18348623853211

1736191,5,B00006A8T3,"This is a master series that I watched on television decades ago.  It is so highly intelligent that it is hard to find another production that can be considered its equal.  Of course, it started with the novelist, John Le Carre, who did serve in the British intelligence for many years.  This is no James Bond type of espionage story.  It is real.  I am so happy that I have, now, my DVD copy for my library along with of all of John Le Carre books.  By the way, Alec Guiness is George Smiley.  He is superb in it as is the rest of the cast.  This story and series is ingrained in my memory but it's also quite nice to share this DVD with friends and family -- or watching it myself, when I want to indulge in something called ""quality,"" which seems to have become an abstract concept to so much of what is produced today.

1736221,5,B00006A8T3,"It's remarkable how well this holds up nearly 40 years after it was made. I find it far preferable to the cinematic re-imagining of a few years ago, the one with with John Hurt and Gary Oldman. No doubt this was a low-budget production in comparison with that remake, and even in comparison with the 'Smiley's People' sequel of the early 80s. But these limitations improved the finished product. It's made in a dingy London of the 70s and looks it, and that's where it's mainly set. Rather cramped, mildewy-looking interior sets dominate; I imagine layers of wallpaper peeling off in every room. Character studies are brilliantly telescoped into just a page of two of dialogue: George Smiley interviewing Toby Esterhase in his dim office, strolling down from Parliament Hill with a beery Roy Bland, chatting grumpily with Bill Haydon in Chelsea, picking Connie Sachs's brains in a well-worn Oxford flat. No real plot development in these scenes (except for a bit of exposition in the Connie one) but the characters are quickly fleshed out. Alexander Knox as Control was a great find; this ancient Canadian actor was so decrepit and idiosyncratic you don't wonder why he doesn't sound English.",1492128000,4,1192,4.965

So I went ahead and watched the 2011 movie with Gary Oldman. That was pretty good - Great acting.  The movie version had almost everything the 6 TV episodes had..I just don't see what is to be gained by watching (much less purchasing) the extended made for BBC version.

This is probably going to be very unpopular, but I didn't like Alec Guinness in the role. in the first few episodes especially, there was a lot of close ups of his face, where Guinness had to make certain facial expressions...they just didn't work to me, in fact it came off as really bad attempts at comedy almost, which of course had no place in this production. I don't know, I'm not a ""Guinness hater"" by any means. Bridge over the River Kwai is something I watch wth my Father when very young, and Alec's acting was so good that i think I just about drove my old man crazy with questions about intent and motives.

1736251,5,B00006A8T3,"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is a six-part 1979 British television miniseries adaptation of John Le Carrs classic spy novel of the same name. First shown on American television in 1980, and released on Blu-ray in 2012, this tense, taught espionage thriller does an excellent job of preserving the essence of Le Carrs superb book. I found it very entertaining from beginning to end.

It is the early 1970s, and the Cold War is at its chilliest. The head of the British Foreign Intelligence service, called Control, suspects there is a Soviet mole at the very top of The Circus, as the spy agency is affectionately nicknamed. Control sends Jim Prideaux, one of his most trusted agents, into Czechoslovakia to meet with someone who can confirm his suspicions. However, Prideaux is caught in an ambush by Czech army soldiers

As a result, Control and his deputy director, George Smiley, are forced out of the Circus and into retirement. Rumors persist, however, that the unidentified mole is still active. George Smiley reluctantly agrees to a government request to work ""off the books"" in order to unmask the identity of the person inside the Circus that's selling secrets to the Soviets.

Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy stars Alec Guinness, Ian Richardson, Ian Bannen, Hywel Bennett, Michael Jayston, and a host of other superb British character actors, all of whom perform brilliantly in this TV miniseries. Guinness, Jayston, and Bennett are especially noteworthy as George Smiley, Peter Guillam, and Ricki Tarr respectively; Guinness received a British Academy Television Award for Best Actor for his performance.

The six episodes of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy are approximately 50-52 minutes long, and none of them is particularly fast-paced. Still, the overall story remains thoughtful, tense and fascinating. I think Director John Irvin, and writers Arthur Hopcraft and John Le Carr, did an excellent job of keeping me interested the film for the duration of its six-hour running time. The writers did slightly alter certain aspects of the book for the film adaptation, but the miniseries manages to remain very faithful to Le Carrs novel.

Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy  never fails to entertain me whenever I watch it  and I do watch it frequently. Highly recommended.",1481846400,7,2262,5.147138964577657

I finally watched it the other week and must sadly report it has not survived the passage of time well. The serialization is surprisingly poor and weaves in chunks of The Honourable Schoolboy, and not wisely, either. We have greet indigestible chunks of dialogue that meander around aimlessly and there is a curious lack of tension.

1736377,5,B00006A8T3,"Yes, I am something of Le Carre fan (he wrote the books all three of the aforementioned films are based on), but by no measure are ALL of his books anywhere near as riveting and gripping as these three. Luckily for us, all three were also made into excellent films/series. ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier Spy"" is actually a miniseries from British television that was so perfectly written, cast, directed and paced overall, that every time I re-watch it, I can't help but pause it for a bit and try to take-in its thorough excellence.

In a nutshell, ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" is a story that revolves around George Smiley -- a ""lifer"" in the service of British Intelligence, you name it, he's seen it... and it has worn him down into a husk of a man. Well, now he is confronted by the dreaded specter of a mole ensconced at a disturbingly-high level of the British Intel community. And it is Smiley's job to ferret-out this traitor with the help of his hand-picked assistants.

That's enough about the plot, but rest easy, it unravels for the viewer in a masterful, multi-layered fashion. I have no reservations saying this miniseries easily cracks the top-10 best ever on British or American tele. Also, I'd rather not reveal anything for anyone who hasn't treated themselves to this story.

One thing to note, is that if you are the type to do laundry, check emails, prepare dinner, etc while watching something like this, don't bother. I say this because it was written and edited in a manner which impressed upon me that not a single second of this series was wasted on filler. Everything you'll see in this series contributes to the plot; be it actual discoveries, character development, or what have you. So yes, you'll have to simply sit and enjoy the episode you watch and leave your ""multitasking"" personality elsewhere.

Without going further into the plot, one of the more striking aspects of this miniseries was the indelibly-cold feeling that never left me. This is extremely effective on the part of the writing and direction. It's supposed to feel that way, because Smiley's job and life for that matter are a continually lonely existence. He is seeking-out a Russian mole in British Intel and the culprit could be any one of his well-heeled co-workers. So, he has to isolate himself in his work, and what a dreary task this is. Also, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that Le Carre's books are so realistic because this is exactly what espionage and intel work is really like: it is a lonely, thankless way of life that breeds suspicion and bitterness because no good deed goes unpunished. No matter how terrific your past accomplishments, it amounts to a hill of s___ if your next workday is a poor one. THAT is life in intel and THAT is what made this such an effective, well-made series.

***Note*** If this miniseries is your ""cup of tea,"" I highly recommend the films ""The Russia House"" and ""The Spy Who Came In from the Cold.""",1432512000,,2947,4.692456479690522

1736392,5,B00006A8T3,"This is an Adaptation of John le Carre's novel, of the same name. George Smiley is brought out of retirement to search for the mole, in British counter intelligence (MI6), code named Gerald, who is sitting at the heart of the Circus - he sets out for Oxford to visit an invaluable friend. However, British counter intelligence believe that they have a mole (double agent) working for them in ""Moscow Centre"" (KGB) passing them highly classified information code-named ""Operation Witchcraft"" - but who is really performing the ""Witchcraft"" here?

This is a TV mini-series, which can stand beside the best of cinematic films, a series that does not seem dated. With a narrative that is rich; where the performances are top notch, with a theme of betrayal, the ultimate betrayal - of country, of the service and of friendship. The technical quality only limited seemingly by the technical limits of the day and the needs for the ""small screen"". Each episode is approximately 50 minutes, with a total of seven episodes. Unfortunately the U.S edition, was a very much-edited down edition.

1736393,2,B00006A8T3,"I bought the DVD before it was re-packaged and there were 6 episodes and a 27 minute interview with the TTSS author. Looks like, subtitle and director comments were added in re-packaged version.

According to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Tailor_Soldier_Spy_%28TV_miniseries%29:
""In the US, syndicated broadcasts and DVD releases compressed the seven-part UK episodes into six,[2] by shortening scenes and altering the narrative sequence. In the UK original, Smiley visits Connie Sachs before Peter Guillam's burglary of the Circus, while the US version reverses the sequence of these events, in line with the time sequence of the novel.""

The BBC version has 7 episodes. The video on both BBC and US were pretty crummy. Too bad neither producers of these DVDs didn't do a re-master. I mean the US version charges a lot for the poor quality you get. At least BBC version with Smiley's People is under 7 in UK and $12 in US amazon.
BBC has hardcoded subtitles for conversation between Prideaux and Baraku -- on US original you get nada. BBC has english subtitles.

Why buy re-packaged when you only get subtitles and director comments? If prices comes down to $5-10 then it maybe worth buying. The video fps for US is 23.97, and 25 for BBC.

Don't get me wrong -- TTSS is excellent (5 stars) otherwise for storyline, realism, actors and acting, but I won't pay $25 or more for another lousy video.",1424044800,11,1402,5.0042918454935625

And when I first saw this adaptation on PBS, I was struck by how perfectly Alec Guinness personified that image I had in my mind.  He moves through this labyrinth of a story with the slow, deliberate pace of a slightly sinister tortoise.  It's a fascinating performance, still and subtle and intense at the same time.

This is perhaps the finest filmed adaptation of a literary work that I have ever seen.  Not a blueprint of the book, it nevertheless captures the atmosphere, the still menace that seems to hang over the proceedings. It is a cerebral work, not likely to appeal to those looking for fireworks and special effects.  See it.  See every minute of it.  Then watch it again.",1422316800,,785,4.589928057553957

I saw the movie version and there's just no comparison. Really, there's just no point in seeing the movie version.

My previous watchings were probably on VHS and/or DVD and I was a bit nervous about what the image quality would be like, having been disappointed in the past with DVD or Blu-Ray versions of old-ish and fondly remembered British TV series (""Brideshead Revisited"" being a major case in point). So I was happy to see that the quality was quite good. Not like watching new, true, HD content, of course, but it was never at that ""eek, this is unwatchable level of badness"" and was sometimes remarkably good. In the special features the director mentioned how it was the first BBC series that was done on film throughout (as opposed to film for exteriors and video for interiors) so probably that helped a bit.

This was originally filmed in 16mm, so it will never be perfect, but the blu ray looks worse than most bargain-bin DVDs.  That, however, is the lesser of two problems this Blu Ray has.

The original Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, as written, filmed, and broadcast on British television, was 7 45 minute episodes.  It was masterfully paced, building tension slowly as each episode builds towards an understated, but vital, conclusion.  This version has been hacked apart and rearranged so that it's 6 50-55 minute episodes.  It's been hacked apart and sewn together like Frankenstein's monster.  The wonderfully tense build-up and byzantine intellectualism of the original is gone, as are the satisfying and coherent episode endings.  What a shame.

1736446,5,B00006A8T3,"The single best made for television mini-series ever done.  This production had the time to do justice to Le Carre's masterpiece, and did it ever.  Last year's (2012) Tinker, Tailor film was interesting, but can't hold a candle to the brilliant turn by Alec Guinness in the role of a lifetime as George Smiley.  Smiley peels the onion which may lead to the apprehension of the long-suspected but never before caught mole, buried in the upper echelons of the British Secret Service and steadily betraying the service to his Russian masters.  Each of the six 50 or so minute long episodes unwinds like a fine watch, with the tension building through all episodes to a final climax.  Each role is played by actors who simply could not have been better cast.  Each one fits his role like a glove, and each contributes to the atmosphere of rising tension which accompanies every turn of the tale.  This boxed set is the crown jewel of my DVD collection.  I would sooner part with a member of my family than part with this set.  I return to these discs over and over whenever the banality of some recent television or movie production has bored me to tears, and I feel the need for some real drama with master actors.

1) This is the US/PBS version in 6 episodes, NOT the full UK/BBC version in 7 episodes.
2) Other than the compactness of the packaging, there is no reason to buy the BluRay set.  The video transfer is HORRIBLE.  Film artifacts all over the place, and 1970s broadcast quality, grainy images.  The material deserves far better treatment than Acorn Media has given it here.

This is so vastly superior to the recent film that I wonder why that film got the praise it did.  Guiness is magnificent; Oldman is simply taciturn by comparison.  The sense of a crumbling Empire and the people who are tending to its decline shines from every scene; the film is a pastiche by comparison - a Mad Men view of 1970's Britain that gets lots of little details right but misses the subtext at every opportunity.

Anyone else that does, should seek professional help.
Because this is a movie that goes on and on without anything interesting or exiting ever happening. To call this a thriller, is like calling watching a tortoise move having a front row seat to a fast-paced race to the death.
Only in the last scene something exiting nearly happens, but the director elects not to show it to us. He must have thought that after over two hours of interminable boredom, the shock of something actually happening would be too much for some and might cause heartattacks.
Sometimes the editors make halfhearted attempts to liven things up - by resorting to completely unannounced and utterly confusing jumps in time and space.
Gary Oldmans excellent acting skills goes completely to waste, and could easily be replaced by Sylvester Stallone and his infamous lack of emotions.

1736516,5,B00006A8T3,"I saw this miniseries when if was first broadcast in 1980, hard on the heels of Alec Guinness' memorable role as Obi-Wan Kenobi in Star Wars IV. I have placed it among my favorite BBC series, along with ""I, Claudius"" and ""Brideshead Revisited"". I decided to take a look back at it in preparation for reviewing the new version starring Gary Oldman as George Smiley. I will defer my opinion on that until I've watched it twice.

The cast for this version must have employed virtually half of the better English character actors. There are 41 feature cast members, ten of which I recognize immediately, such as Ian Richardson, Ian Bannen, Alexander Knox, Joss Ackland, Sian Phillips, and Patrick Steward, whose dialogue consists of a single word. I read the book and I don't remember it well now, but I recall in 1979 that it followed the book quite closely. Like the earlier ""The Spy Who Came In From The Cold"", it is gritty and no nonsense. Not a single trace of James Bond tomfoolery. Even better, it was filmed when the Cold War was still very real, and Russian spooks were a very, very real fear. What makes it even more genuine sounding (albeit annoying since it is unexplained) is that it uses a jargon (which may or may not be real MI-6 patter)such as lamp-lighters (internal security) and scalp hunters (specialists in ""wet work"").

Guinness as George Smiley is virtually perfect (and all other roles are played to a tee). It appears he may have been aged a bit with make-up from his Obi-Wan appearance. He appears in one flashback scene perhaps 20 years before, and it seemed easy to make him look younger. Even the small roles are limned with perfection, such as Beryl Reid as Connie Sachs,  the retired Circus head of research, with arthritic hands, who is now an Oxford tutor. Steward's performance as the chief heavy, Carla, may be one of the best things I have seen him do (I am not a fan of his.) It was based entirely on body English responding (or not responding) to George Smiley's interrogations. I did not even recognize him, as he had some hair, and his face was in shadow (unlike his great role as Sejanus in ""I, Claudius""). Possibly the best other main performances were Ian Richardson as Bill Haydon and Ian Bannen as Jim Prideaux. I have never seen Richardson in a Shakespearean play, but he was marvelous in the BBC series ""House of Cards"" and in the film ""Brazil."" Ian Bannan seemed to be a staple in British spy thrillers such as ""the Mackintosh Man"" starring Paul Newman.

The American version was rearranged from the seven part British version to put things in a sequence which better agreed with the book. Unlike virtually most other spy flicks, the realism simply crackles with verisimilitude. One can chuckle about Sherlock Holmes never carrying a pistol. No such bravado here, as even Smiley pulls out his Glock when the final scene comes, and he is constantly on the lookout for people tailing him.

I do sense that Gary Oldman may have taken some lessons on playing George Smiley from Guinness' performance here. If you were not fond of the remake, come back and try the original.",1368835200,,3114,4.654545454545454

1736524,5,B00006A8T3,"Winston Churchill called post-war Russia: ""A riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma.""

John le Carre must have agreed. His 1974 novel of TINKER, TAILOR is all of those things...riddle, mystery, enigma. Set in the early 1970's during the Cold War, the novel explores espionage tactics, clandestine operations, and a search for a mole in the British SIS. Great Britain vs Russia complete with vast intelligence groups, double agents and multiple code names.

In 1979 BBC released the television adaption of the novel. The award-winning 7-part series (which became 6-parts when released in the US in September of 1980) had a stellar cast. Sir Alec Guiness plays George Smiley who comes in from the cold to help Circus (MI6) find a Russian mole. Filmed on location in Glasgow, Oxford University and London, the series is mesmerizing. From the beginning title scene of matryosha nestling dolls to Smiley's encounter with his estranged wife at the end, a masterpiece of espionage and suspense with fine acting, brilliant settings...

Yesterday I watched all six episodes of TINKER, TAILOR on three DVD disks. And returned to the library to obtain the 2011 feature film starring Gary Oldman. It's going to be a great Wednesday. I have lots of questions about the recent film and the BBC sequel.

Is Gary Oldman going to be more forceful in the Smiley role? Smiley (Guinness) and Control (Alexander Knox) were portrayed by old men....

Who will play Jim Prideaux (Ian Bannen) who was reportedly killed in Operation Testify....and Karla (Patrick Stewart) in the 2011 film?

Will the graphics and settings be as spectacular?

Do I want to watch another six hour television series of the BBC sequel SMILEY'S PEOPLE, Le Carre's third novel in the Karla Trilogy? John le Carre co-wrote the screenplay.

Stay tuned. See the comments.

This is a truly outstanding program featuring a transcendent performance by Alec Guinness.  If you think ""Spy movie = action movie"" then you will not get it in this package.  What you will get is plot, character development, tension, drama, pathos and, above all, top-notch acting.  You must pay attention when watching as even the seemingly smallest moments can prove to have great depth, but the sensory investment is so totally worth it.

1736539,5,B00006A8T3,"The start of it all, ""Tinker, Tailor"" is a tour de force for all concerned.  I watched it when it originally aired all those years ago and was on the edge of my seat from  week to week.  Requires several viewings to get the story straight, but I was so intrigued that I HAD to re-watch because I wanted to understand better.  It adapted the book very well.
Ian Richardson's performance is equal to ""House of Cards"" and in some ways better, and, of course, Alec Guinness is the best.  The remake--the recent movie--was second-rate and annoying--for example, Peter Guillam is portrayed as gay--absolutely contradicting the book.  Gary Oldham did his best but he isn't Alec Guinness.  However, I will say in its defense that the casting of John Hurt as Control was inspired but Colin Firth did not belong in the movie, especially as this character.  The man who played Alleline looked like the weasel he was and sounded it, too--very good!!

However, my criticism of the movie pales in view of the fact that le Carre signed off to this version of his story, so if I am more loyal than he is to his original, it is irrelevant.

Sorry!!  This was supposed to be a review of the original ""Tinker, Tailor""--forgive my rant.  However, if this is your only exposure to the story, you need to at least rent the original.

1736544,5,B00006A8T3,"Purchased to replace another copy lost or not returned on loan to someone. Had to have copy on my library. This is one of my all time favourite films. Many talented players cast in main and supporting roles make the characters and the well written story come alive. For those not familiar with the story it revolves around the decline in the Bristish Secret Service brought about by treachery from within and the slow and at times unsteady search by the flawed and aged hero, a retired spy, (George Smiley played by Sir Alec Guinness) for the guilty parties.
The film does a good job in portraying the organisation as one that is run down, short of resources and in decay. The main players are very well cast in their roles. The violence and horror in the story are left unstated, this is not sotry or film that relies on graphic depictions for its popularity or message.
The good guys are generally flawed or less than completely good. This is a story that I would recommend to anyone that has the time watch (6 episodes) the entire film, even better at a single sitting.

For those looking for ""James Bond"" spy stories, don't bother with this film as this is closer to the truth than you can possibly bear.

1736551,5,B00006A8T3,"I recently watched this series again after being very disappointed with the recent movie.  The series will not disappoint. In fact, it is without a doubt one of the best adaptations of a complex, modern novel I have ever seen.  The novel itself provided a wonderful place to start. Le Carre is one of the finest novelists of his generation who may not get the credit he deserves (although he has received abundant accolades) because he wrote extensively about espionage and falls (according to some) into the ""spy genre.""  This seeems to me a misleading ""put down"" because not only does the genre offer a rich subject matter, but Le Carre may have been the best practitioner ever to practice in the genre and was really at the height of his powers in the Smiley Trilogy (Tinker Tailor; Smiley's People; The Honorable Schoolboy). As to the BBC adaptation, it is very nearly perfect and I really can't imagine how it could have been better.  Given 5.5 hours to develope the novel, the producers and writers could delve into the nuance of the novel without sacrificing or simplifying.  The casting and acting is brilliant. I don't think there is a weak link. Alec Guiness is simply supurb as George Smiley and manages to convey a brilliant character, whose appearance sometimes belies that brilliance, insight and toughness (his habit of polishing his glasses, as if his world constantly needs to be seen with ever greater clarity is the stroke of a master actor).  At the same time, Guiness shows Smiley's occasional befuddlement with his personal life, his relations with others, and especially with his wife.  One of the great things about the series is the development of the other main characters at the ""Circus.""  The actors are wonderful and one gets a very clear sense of who they are and what they are all about. They are all notable, but Ian Richardson and Bernard Hepton are especially fine. The same goes for the lesser characters, Hywel Bennett, Michael Jayston, Ian Bannon, Sian Phillips, Alexander Knox, really all of them.  They are distinctive and interesting characters with full and complete ""back-stories"" that make them live on the screen.  Needless to say, the series is wonderfully filmed and conveys a very real sense of the atmosphere of the intelligence community, and does a marvellous job of creating suspence.  It is not overly simplified--there are moments that one has to puzzle out just exactly what the events mean or imply--but in the end it is as clear as a series dealing with a complex situation and conflicting personalities and motivations could posible be.
All in all, the is a GREAT adaptation and I would be hard pressed to think of another mini-series in any genre that comes even close to its overall quality.
As I own an older, original boxed set that is not Blu-Ray, I cannot comment on the numerous critiques of the Blu-Ray transfer or the problems with formats designed for use outside of the US.  I would advise caution, as have many others, with buying the ""right"" version.  However, it does exist--the original boxed set provides a clear picture and some fine cmmentary--and is well worth the investment.  It is one series that I return to again and again to find new pleasures and I cannot recommend it highly enough.",1357084800,,3266,4.829749103942652

The first spy assigned to track down the mole is shot.  George Smiley (played by Alec Guiness), originally the suspect ""Beggarman,"" is then assigned the case.

This is a 6 part miniseries, each episode an hour long, and will require your undivided attention should you choose to view it.  You may even have to watch it two or three times to get everything, so, not your typical American movie at all.  The acting is superb.  The plot is completely believable, and will make you rethink what a spy movie should be.  Throughout the show, I was wondering if we'd ever see Smiley's wife Ann, and who'd play her, and I was pleasantly surprised.  (I didn't read the credits beforehand.)

The movie changed a few things and cut out many things entirely (understandable considering the time constraints). The miniseries is, in my opinion, the best adaptation yet, and survives the ""Is this good because it's from my past, or is it just good?"" question. The acting is superb, from all players.

Friends of mine who have jazz bands tell me that, in music, the audience can tolerate large amounts of technical in-expertise.  But they know immediately when a band's heart is not in the music and just walk away. Same goes, IMHO, for this DVD. Alec Guinness and the entire crew put so much heart into this production that I really don't care about the technical quality of the blue ray.

Le Carre has been quoted in the past as thinking the way Alec Guinness played Smiley was excellent, but I think he must have eventually realized that Guinness subtly duped him - this Smiley is a classic, old fashioned ""hero fighting evil against all odds"", someone not at all pleasing to more sophisticated tastes. Hence the new movie version which pointedly trashes the Smiley character. I have read most of Le Carre's novels over the years, and I now own this Tinker Tailor and Smiley's People, the following series. Both series are excellent and subversively inspiring: you, like Smiley, must live a heroic life whether institutions or the people who make up your everyday world seem to deserve your aid or not.",1347580800,,957,4.841463414634147

The first episode plods along. Lots of scenes are dark, lots of mumbled words and the ""Circus"" seems about as exciting as watching beige paint on a beige wall dry. By the time the first episode gets interesting, as soon as there is a tiny bit of plot development, it's over. The part of the second episode I watched began with Ricki (a ""scalp hunter"") explaining what his mission was to wherever the hell they sent him. By this time, I still knew nothing, but I knew one thing for sure - I didn't give a rat's ass about what happened to any of those people. The love affair (??) that was supposed to be blossoming? Again, watching beige paint dry on a beige wall.  Smiley, the mole, the mysterious ""Anne"" men keep asking about - didn't care.

That being said, I realize all praise I attempt to give to Alec Guinness for his portrail of George Smiley will be woefully short of the mark.  Alec Guinness is clearly an absolute master at his craft and gives us his best here.  After watching through Netflix, I will be purchasing my own copy of this miniseries so that I can watch the whole thing again whenever I like.

Gary Oldman's Smiley in the movie adaptation is probably fine, but having watched Alec Guinness's Smiley first, he couldn't possibly compare.",1342137600,,1063,4.528795811518324
1736572,5,B00006A8T3,"It' a long hot summer so far, next to nothing on TV, so I thought I'd watch the two versions of 'Tinker,Tailor, Soldier Spy.'  I've loved the original since I saw it on PBS.  One of the reasons was the pace, which some find too slow, because within the 5 hrs. not a word, or scene, is wasted as Smiley unravels the mystery as to the identity of  the mole.  It's intelligent, great storytelling with superb acting that keeps you at the edge of your seat...all without violence and guns every few minutes.

As for the current film, it' more like a Cliff's/Coles's Notes version compared to the original.  If that's the only one you watch, trust me, you've missed what made TTSS a classic.  Gary Oldman's, a very good actor, but I don't envy him having had to create the character of Smiley after Alec Guinness's performance ..especially with such limited time and script.  The same applies to the rest of the cast trying to bring the same magic to their ""abridged"" roles.",1341705600,3,969,4.528735632183908

His books are his books and the movies are the movies, and a lot of the '70s British stuff -- like this miniseries and ""Deadly Affair"" and even ""Perfect Spy"" -- are made in a style I find INTERMINABLY DULL.

It's not just the slow pace (I like slow when it's full of import), it's the browns and greys and the quality of the audio and ... man, I'm getting sleepy just thinking about it.",1341619200,2,488,4.236559139784946
1736574,5,B00006A8T3,"I'vew just finished watching both this amazing original and the recent remake and the winner is the original.  It's strengths have become more apparent over time.  One of the things most missing from the remake is the incredible tension that permeated the original  It was truly frightening to watch the slow development of the storyline in the original when I first watched it during its original broadcast on PBS.  Of course, it may be that the fact that the original was done while the Cold War still raged, around the time that Moscow had clamped down on the nascent Solidarity movement in Poland.  When this was broadcast on PBS Anthony Blunt, the famous art historian, had only recently been revealed as a spy for the Soviets.  It was all too real.  But even today, 30+ years later, when the Soviet Union and the spy culture fostered by the subsurface conflict, are but a distant memory the sense of breathless, oppressive secrecy and fear underneath the humdrum small, everyday realities that pervade the series remains.  This is non-existent in the modern remake.

The dialogue in the original has a terseness and drive that are also lacking in the remake.  The story it tells is more intense and more believable.  And the score by Geoffrey Burgon, with its intense, sometimes pounding beat underlying the tension in the drama, and its beautiful, wistful ""Nunc Dimittis"" during the credits, contributes to the sense of near panic at times.",1340582400,4,1447,4.889344262295082

This film thankfully gave us, and especially John le Carr&eacute;, Alec Guinness who will forever be George Smiley as a result.

There is no comparison to the 2011 film. Guillam driving a Citron DS - It is to laugh, yes no? The BBC film has him torturing Smiley in a drafty old Morgan+4; a little upscale for a civil servant, wouldn't you say? In fact, he drove a ""draughty old Porsche."" David Cornwell approved of changes, but not necessarily those changes. ""Have fun with it,"" said David, a phrase most often heard from hairdressers, bad cooks and interior decorators. Also from Richard Strauss, which accounts for such atrocities as transcriptions of his opera, Der Rosenkavalier, for Klezmer and Ein Heldenleben for Mummers string band.

1736579,4,B00006A8T3,"While I had wanted to buy this for several years, it took the recent Gary Oldman remake to make me pull the trigger on picking up the original. I got the non-bluray when I first bought it, but recently watched the bluray edition at a friend's.  Sadly I was really bothered by how bad the bluray was, and while I have not compared the two directly side by side, let me put it to you this way: if you did not know it was a bluray disc playing, the first thing out of your mouth would be ""boy this is great, hopefully they'll upgrade it to bluray someday!"". Once people own a bluray player its fairly natural to buy most of your collection on bluray, but IMHO this is one case you may save some $$$ by going with the standard DVD.

For those who have not seen it, the story itself is good, and the acting is top notch. Alec Guinness is perfectly cast and GREAT in this role (make no mistake, he is the star), as is most of the supporting cast. There are a lot of characters to keep track of, including a small role by a very young looking Patrick Stewart well before Star Trek fame, and I believe one of actors that played Professor Dumbledore in Harry Potter. Most of the others are people I did not recognize, but were likely well known and accomplished actors in England 30 years ago.

The cold war era espionage plot regarding double-agents and behind the scenes internal power struggles is not really groundbreaking in any way today, but was then, and done well enough here that it doesn't need to try to be anything more than it is. It has certainly inspired a lot of recent works as well:(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Queen-Country-The-Definitive-Edition-Volume-4/dp/1934964131/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Queen & Country The Definitive Edition Volume 4</a>).

With a total running time over 5 hours, don't expect anything to get wrapped up quickly. If you don't enjoy slowly evolving stories, you won't like this. ""Tinker"" require patience, and if you miss something you'll find yourself reaching for the rewind button often unless you read a little bit of the ""baseball program"" of character descriptions and jargon that come in a small DVD insert. It contains some very minor spoilers, but for those who have not read the book they may want to take a peek if they begin to get lost as the show progresses.

""Tinker"" ends up being very addictive and well worth owning, especially if you want to spend the majority of a weekend sitting on the couch. The real question is whether or not people should wait for a REAL deluxe treatment, ""Criterion-Like"" edition to be put out, go for this subpar bluray, or stick to the standard DVD. Since this may be the best we ever get based on the source material, I think it will all come down to pricepoints. If the bluray drops to about the same cost I would still get it for the few extra features, but if you already own ""Tinker"" I would NOT upgrade it.  If you've never seen it, you may still want the cheaper version.  You'll still wish it was of better visual quality, but at least you won't have plunked down extra cash for the bluray just to have the exact same reaction.

In summary, if you need a lot of car chases and gun-play in order to get your espionage fix, DON'T get this series. If you like excellent acting, complicated plots, and watching frumpy old chain smoking men making life and death decisions for the rest of us behind the scenes then this is for you. There are no ""death rays"" or girls shaking martinis, but if you want a Bond-like fix you have multiple other options to choose from.",1337385600,9,3593,4.611893583724569

There should have been at least some attempt made to remove signs of wear and tear, white flecks etc are very obvious. While blacks can cause difficulties with some Blu-ray transfers, there really is no excuse for grainy images that seem to appear throughout as the norm on this transfer. Could it be that the original used for these discs was from a tape, rather than from the original film stock that the series was shot in? The Blu-ray is an improvement on the DVD version, but good enough to justify the hefty difference in price between the two? On balance almost certainly not.",1337040000,22,745,4.567164179104478
1736581,1,B00006A8T3,"I adore ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy."" It is a fabulous production. My review has nothing to do with the content of the film. My review is solely on Acorn Media's ghetto Blu-ray transfer.

Instantly within the first scene you will be horrified by the shockingly low quality transfer. Grainy is not an accurate enough word to describe this. There are strings and white flecks all over the picture. The quality is extensively pixelated and shots are sometimes wobbly. No effort went into this Blu-ray. I've seen this on VHS and DVD before, and both of those formats look better. The Blu-ray technology is highlighting the errors, age and flaws of the film. I have this paused on my T.V. right now and it looks like an impressionist painting. This is without a doubt the absolute worst Blu-ray transfer I have ever seen. The sound quality is marginal. The Blu-ray quality is so poor it is distracting from the superb quality of the story.

If you already own this on DVD it is not worth the upgrade and if you are considering purchasing the film, choose DVD.

This transfer is disrespectful to the high quality and merit of this production. Acorn rushed a poor Blu-ray transfer to cash in on the release of the recent motion picture version of this story. Shame on you Acorn Media!",1336608000,86,1276,4.662222222222222

Not to include them (and there is no CC, either) is irresponsible beyond belief. It seems that for the price of this set, one might expect such basic feature as subtitles, but sorry, no luck.

1736584,3,B00006A8T3,"While I have wanted to buy this for several years, like many people it took the recent Gary Oldman remake film of the same name to get me to finally pull the trigger. (Update, this review is for the non Bluray edition)

The result has been a mixed bag.  While I have intensely enjoyed it in many respects, and rushed through all six episodes in a week, there were also several glaring issues.  For all of its problems I still recommend it, but for some people they definitely will be disappointed.

Starting with the good, the acting is top notch.  Alec Guinness is great (make no mistake, he is the star), as is most of the supporting cast (and there are a lot of them to keep track of!). This includes a small role by a very young looking Patrick Stewart well before Star Trek fame, as well as I believe one of actors that played Professor Dumbledore in Harry Potter. Most of the others are people I did not recognize, but were likely well known and accomplished actors in England 30 years ago.

The cold war era espionage plot regarding double-agents and internal power struggles is not really  groundbreaking in any way, yet done well enough here that it doesn't need to try to be anything more than it is. Despite the basic nature of the premise, there are plenty of moving parts to complicate it and keep things interesting.  With a total running time around 300 minutes, don't expect anything to get wrapped up quickly.

This is a series that will require patience, and if you miss something (which can be easy to do, as plot threads can be spread out and move slowly) you'll find yourself reaching for the rewind button often unless you read a little bit of the ""baseball program"" of character descriptions and jargon that come in a small DVD insert. It contains some very minor spoilers, but for those who have not read the book they may want to take a peek if they begin to get lost as the show progresses.

That leads to a major problem, the production.  You'll also be hitting the rewind button alot because it is frequently hard to understand what the characters are saying.  Part of this is because many people in the U.S. do find some british accents hard to follow.  But it is more than that, as voice volumes are maddenly uneven and the sound mixing is horrible. Particularly in scenes where the characters are far away from the camera, you'll find yourself wishing you had one of those high-end radar dish looking listening devices so you can understand what is being said without frequent rewinds/volume changes.  The picture quality itself is also subpar, and it looks like very little effort has been made to clean it up. I'm OK with this, but I know it might drive some other people crazy. The other problem I had, the aspect ratio is supposed to be for regular TVs.  For some reason my wide screen kept trying to stretch the picture, and no matter how I fiddled with settings I could not change it.  As a consequence, everything looked a little distorted. I've watched hundreds of movies on this TV and have never before had that issue.

The other problem with the series is the adaptation.  I have to say that only somewhat qualified as I have never read the book, but based on many of the scenes I am making a guess that this series might be suffering from trying to follow the book too closely. Completists may like this, and I'm sure if it was not true to the book there would have been many complaints at the time. For those of us watching it 30 years after the fact who never read the book it's an entirely different matter. I'm in no way suggesting that they should have done it differently, but if you were to treat the series as a stand alone project there are doubtless many cases where some scenes should have been cut, others expanded, etc. Again, this is a partial guess on my part, and there are so many things going on that there would be some crucial elements needing to be worked in under different guises. Regardless, the series does have some slow parts that IMHO could have been done better without changing the core atmosphere.

Returning to the good and summing things up, the real question is whether or not people should wait for a deluxe treatment, ""Criterion Like"" edition to be put out (example of top notch, cleaned up older movie here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Orpheus-The-Criterion-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B005152CBE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Orpheus (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray</a>]), or whether you should buy this one now.  ****  UPDATE - a bluray edition is supposed to be out April 24, 2012 **** Regardless, if you need a lot of car chases and gun-play in order to get your espionage fix, DON'T get this series. If you like excellent acting, complicated plots, and watching frumpy old chain smoking men making life and death decisions for the rest of the world behind the scenes then this is for you.

The picture is better than the previous six-part DVD release I borrowed from a friend.  I do not have timings on his older DVD.

Because I read so much conflicting information on the six-part vs seven-part versions I recorded all the timings on the new Blu-ray (US version).  IMDB lists the six-part PBS version as 290 minutes and the seven-part UK version as 315 minutes.

The new Blu-ray release is six-parts lasting 322:30 plus bonus features of 11:26 deleted scenes, 29:56 John Irvin interview, and 19:33 John LeCarre interview.

1736603,5,B00006A8T3,"Ranks among the great TV thriller productions. This has long been a praised TV series dramatization of a long praised book by John le Carre. It keeps one guessing to the end. The role of George Smiley by Alec Guinness is superb in his constant ability to portray an aged, ready-to-retire, spy, but yet have the instincts and intelligence of discovery to have the government ask him to be the ""SPY to catch the spy"". It's an old plot, spy vs spy, but perhaps never before been done a realistically and memorably. Guinness investigated the cast/crew prior to saying ""yes""; a fact that shows this was destined to be great from the first day of filming. The 1979 filming simply makes this story more realistic looking, now taking on the feel of a London Cold War period thriller/drama.

Of course there were other great stars taking on big roles in this 6 part series. Ian Richardson (Bleak House) has a large part, while Patrick Stewart (Star Trek; X-Men) steps in for a cameo which doesn't even include a speaking dialogue. Other greats are in-between these 2 men providing mastery for this Cold War tale of espionage and political mayhem.

The question has always been which is the better. The book or the series. My vote is for the series (and the character/term glossary really adds understandability. Can anyone play the roles of Smiley and Haydon as well as Guiness and Richardson? Their excellence bar has already been placed very high.

I believe this is the only Blu-ray of Guinness Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and comes with new bonus features, including deleted scenes and a lengthy, new interview with director John Irvin.

The feeling of the seventies/cold war is very well produced (which was easy at the time!). This is NOT an action film, it's more of an intellectual mystery movie. I recommend renting it and watching it over several nights.

I have seen the new movie with Gary Oldman in theaters and re-watched this series for comparison and I found the script and acting in this one were better.

I concluded that #2 is only the non-English languages.  Is this some cosmopolitan European thing?

1736652,4,B00006A8T3,"When I was thirteen, I would try to watch the famous British mini-series TINKER, TAILOR, SOLDIER, SPY with my stepfather, who was glued to the television set. He tried to explain to me who was who in the cast, but all the characters spoke in what was to me at the time an impenetrable conversation of code words, jargon, and historical references, and the series began so far in medias res I couldn't sort it all out beyond that it had something to do with the Cold War. But as baffled as I was by it, I knew from the ominous credits title, with a series of opening matryoshka dolls to Geoffrey Burgon's haunting woodwinds, that it must be pretty epochal.

It's more than thirty years since then, and I've come to see the mini-series now both having read the original John LeCarre novel and the recent 2011 Tomas Alfredson film, and even still the narrative can be pretty hard to sort out. LeCarre and his dramatizer here, Arthur Hopcraft, do little to make things easy for their audience (though at least the title is explained in the first episode). But that's part of the intelligence behind the work in its many incarnations: LeCarre and his adaptors are showing the inside of the most inward-looking of all worlds, where few of the movers speak in a language that would be quickly penetrable by outsiders. (In this way, it's like a grim variant of the academic novel, and indeed many of the characters know each other all the way back from their Oxbridge days--a point which the porducers hammer home by showing us the Radcliffe Camera among dreaming spires over the final credits.) Part of the work's puzzle is not only to find out who is the mole (a term LeCarre may have originated) among the four major figures in the foreign intelligence service, ""The Circus,"" but to parse out who is who and what the meaning is of their terms and references.

Alec Guinness won all sorts of praise for his imperturbable portrayal of George Smiley, the rumpled aging figure responsible for ferreting out the mole; certainly his lack of extraneous affect and staring eyes beneath his trademark huge hornrimmed glasses stay with one. Both he and Ian Richardson seem to rely a bit too heavily on florid Shakespearean pronunciation, but their performances are quite fine, are as those of Beryl Reid as the sad and silly Connie, Michael Aldredge as the prissy company man Percy Alleleine, and Hywel Bennett as the closest possible thing to a James Bond figure the work allows us (and it is still a very far cry). The miniseries, like the novel that inspired it, is in many ways a lamentation over the fate of Empire in the twentieth century: the subculture it depicts is so resolutely male that when Sian Phillips turns up at the very end as Smiley's philandering wife, her presence (the only major feminine presence in the whole work other than Reid's Connie and a sad Soviet spy, both in the first half) nearly comes as a shock. The adaptation is very darkly lit, and unfortunately subtitles are not available on the DVD set; be prepared to listen very closely when Guinness and Richardson are not on screen. It still comes across as epochal--marking perhaps the end of a certain world that Margaret Thatcher was to start sweeping away the very year it came out.",1326326400,7,3253,4.665505226480836

1736669,5,B00006A8T3,"When I was 18 and a freshman in college, I read _Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy_ and thought it was too cerebral.  I was used to more conventional thrillers, and Le Carr's novel clearly wasn't one.  Four years later (in 1980), I watched the broadcast of the BBC mini-series with Alec Guinness, and I realized that I had completely failed to understand _Tinker, Tailor_.  I was dazzled by the series, went back and was dazzled by the book, and I can't praise this BBC production enough.  The critics who point out how slow it is are absolutely right.  If you want a spy thriller--a perfectly respectable taste that I share--look elsewhere.  If you want an extraordinary meditation on the conundrums of loyalty and betrayal, this is your mini-series, and Alec Guinness will be one of your heroes.  I searched for a video of this starting in the mid-1990s, when for some inexplicable reason it was unavailable in the US.  Now that I have it, I watch it every couple of years to savor the brilliant acting and the cumulative build-up of a story that is quietly riveting.  All the actors are good, but I must especially praise the great Alexander Knox as ""Control,"" who is fully a match for Guinness, and Beryl Reid, who is dazzling as Connie Sachs.  Both died in the mid-1990s, and I'll never forget them, so indelible are their performances.  Real life takes time to develop.  So does ""Tinker, Tailor.""  If you're in the mood for superbly nuanced, restrained drama--all the more shattering for the restraint--then this is as good as it gets.",1325030400,7,1536,4.7293233082706765

I saw the theatre version  26 December, 2011.  My concerns were fully justified.  Everything remarkable and captivating about the series is missing.
My advice is to read the book and to see the DVD.  I consider it to be my favourite cold-war spy story, and the quality of the series has much to do with it.

To start with, the original book is of high quality.  Then, the television screen play is excellent both from the stand point of plot and with dialogue.  Each character was perfectly cast for physical appearance as well as acting skill.  The audience consequently is able to gain clear insight into the individuals' personalities, characters, roles in MI6, interaction among each other, their strengths and their weaknesses.  The characters come across as real people whom the audience learns to know.  Sir Alec as George Smiley succeeds in communicating more with his tone of voice, pauses, and non-verbal communication than many actors can speaking.

Tinker Taylor is a journey back into a different time, a cold-war time when the old-boys network dominated the intelligence services and time seemed not so rushed as it is in the 21st century.  The series permits sufficient time to allow for long pauses in dialogue during which the characters communicate much through their behavior and visual affect.  This is time well spent that any theatre version would be unlikely to take.

1736689,5,B00006A8T3,"Quite simply, this is brilliant. I don't know if John Le Carre invented the ""anti-Bond"" spy, the profoundly flawed spy with some deep problem in his home life, but George Smiley certainly perfected the genre. And Alec Guinness's portrayal of Smiley is 100% spot-on.

Adaptations of successful novels are always a problem. People who read and liked the book are a natural audience for the film, but often they hate what the filmmakers did with the book. One problem is that often the characters don't seem ""right."" In this production, they're simply perfect. Besides Smiley, the actors who portrayed Peter Guillam, Toby Esterhazy, and Jim Prideaux are fabulous. And Percy Alleline is totally believable as the arrogant, ambitious, bumbling oaf. Even players who have only a single scene or who just walk on (Karla, Mendel, Connie, Fawn, Control) are great. I found Ricky Tarr a little annoying, but that's probably the way Ricky Tarr was.

The even bigger problem with adaptations is the story-telling. Obviously you can include more with a mini-series than you can with a ~2 hour movie, but still it is a challenge. And there always seem to be problems moving from page to film -- ""tarting up"" the story with increased drama, combining characters, skipping events that some readers consider important, replacing the characters' mental musings with narration-through-dialogue, etc. This video avoided all these pitfalls. It has been a long time since I last read the book, but I cannot remember any important omissions or any violent changes from the original.

It has often been commented that Alec Guinness's version of ""acting"" is to not act. And that's true in a lot of ways. It's the same voice you've seen before, the same stony expression, in fact you're almost waiting to hear him say, ""funny, I don't remember owning a 'droid."" But it's a perfect portrayal, conveyed powerfully with little glances, tiny smiles, occasionally cleaning his glasses, and, most of all, pauses that disarm his adversary.

The series is successful in building tension and telling the story from the very first scene. But there are a couple scenes that deserve to be in the ""Movie Scene Hall of Fame,"" if any such place exists. One is the great scene between Smiley and Connie, the former head of research. And the other (right up there with the De Niro-Pacino scene in ""Heat"" for my money) is the brilliant confrontation between Smiley and Esterhazy at the end of Episode 5.

I've been watching this recently while riding my exercise bike. The good news is that it's upping the amount of exercise I get. The bad news is it will be done too soon. Brilliant video.",1319932800,7,2647,4.912751677852349
1736690,3,B00006A8T3,"John le Carre's books were the anti-James Bond spy novels of their day.  Instead of a lot of sex, action and fancy gadgets like were found in the .007 adventures; le Carre's secret agents worked in a world more in touch with reality.  They did their secretive work in a comparatively mundane, plodding manner.

Some of le Carre's best-selling novels (e.g. THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD) worked well when they were transferred to film, but others did not.

The 1979 television mini-series, TINKER, TAILOR, SOLDIER, SPY, in my minority opinion, falls into the latter category.

Yes,  most critics of the day thought that this six-part, one-hour series was the greatest thing since chopped liver and the program was honored with many awards.  Certainly the cast, headed by Alec Guinness as retired spymaster George Smiley, was magnificent, but watching this series today one can easily see its flaws.

The story, set during the Cold War, has to do with Smiley's clandestine efforts to trap a mole who has infiltrated the British Secret Intelligence Service at its highest level.

Aside from the fact that the plot moves along at a virtual snail's-pace, my major complaint with this series is that there are far too many flashbacks.

Flashbacks may work well in a novel, but in a film they often impede the forward movement of the story.  I have not read le Carre's novel, but my hunch is that the person who wrote the script followed the novel far too closely.

Novels are novels and films are films.  They are two separate animals.

Hopefully, the forthcoming theatrical movie version of TINKER, TAILOR, SOLDIER, SPY will be more film than novel.

The fine cast of the series includes Ian Bannen, Ian Richardson, Hywell Bennett, Michael Jayston, Bernard Hepton, Joss Ackland, Alexander Knox and Patrick Stewart.

The 3-disc DVD set from Acorn Media also includes a half-hour interview with le Carre.

1736691,5,B00006A8T3,"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier Spy was written by John LeCarre in the late 60's early 70's.  It documents the low point of the British Secret Service and the very height of the author's powers.  Originally shown as a mini-series under the BBC brand, it is faithful to the book.  There are no car chases, no shoot outs, or plane crashes.  The drama is provided as George Smiley is tasked with investigating the possibility that the Secret Service has been penetrated by a Russian agent.  In order to accomplish his task Smiley must revisit people and scenes from his past.  In many ways it is a film noir whodunit, where nothing is quite as it seems.  George Smiley is personified by Sir Alec Guiness.  After the BBC series LeCarre subsequently dedicated another book, ""The Secret Pilgrim"" to Guiness.

This is the real thing.  If you are looking forward to the release of the 2011 version of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy this version is probably not for you.",1318118400,2,951,4.709090909090909
1736692,5,B00006A8T3,"Ranks among the great TV thriller productions. This has long been a praised TV series dramatization of a long praised book by John le Carre. It keeps one guessing to the end. The role of George Smiley by Alec Guinness is superb in his constant ability to portray an aged, ready-to-retire, spy, but yet have the instincts and intelligence of discovery to have the government ask him to be the ""SPY to catch the spy"". It's an old plot, spy vs spy, but perhaps never before been done a realistically and memorably. Guinness investigated the cast/crew prior to saying ""yes""; a fact that shows this was destined to be great from the first day of filming. The 1979 filming simply makes this story more realistic looking, now taking on the feel of a London Cold War period thriller/drama.

Of course there were other great stars taking on big roles in this 6 part series. Ian Richardson (Bleak House) has a large part, while Patrick Stewart (Star Trek; X-Men) steps in for a cameo which doesn't even include a speaking dialogue. Other greats are in-between these 2 men providing mastery for this Cold War tale of espionage and political mayhem.

The question has always been which is the better. The book or the series. My vote is for the series (and the character/term glossary really adds understandability. Now the next question, soon to explode into the ""tinker tailor soldier spy"" debate, is will the new Dec. 2011 theater feature be as good as this TV/DVD series? It will be tough. For one thing, cutting a book down to 324 minutes is touch-but that was done extremely well. Time and fans have proven the worth of this series. But even with stars such as Colin Firth (King's Speech) and Gary Oldman, can the new film of only 127 minutes really tell the story?

It was tried, turning a great book, fantastic series, ""Brideshead Revisited"", into a shorter theater version. In my opinion it lost too much. It was good, but much was lost for the sake of time and money. And can anyone play the roles of Smiley and Haydon as well as Guiness and Richardson? The debate will be frenzied for sure. It will be tough. The excellence bar has already been placed very high.

Feed"" is worthless intelligence information, etc. Regardless, one will still need to watch the series twice to get it all, and the second time around, the film is just as enjoyable.

Alec Guinness plays George Smiley, a retired MI6 agent secretly called back to the circus to unravel the identity of the mole. Alec Guinness always adds to whatever part he plays, as well as other of the casting choices. The drama and intrigue are in keeping with the best of the BBC, set in Europe, mostly indoors, and well worth the cost.

Alec Guinness is outstanding as George Smiley. I can remember phrases from the book which describe Smiley in precisely the physical attitudes Guinness uses. In fact, in an interview Le Carre said that Guinness' performance helped clarify the character of George Smiley for him. What greater compliment could be given?

The other characters were very well cast too. Especially Sian Phillips as Anne. No other actress would do for this cameo which ends the series on a satisfying note, pulling everything together.

1736700,5,B00006A8T3,"Real quality often takes time. BBC filmed these mini-series in 1979. The book, on which the TV series were based, appeared in 1974 and is roughly based on events of 1950-60s. As spy-mania spreads once more today, it's time to dip into this Cold War classic.

The book & film are broadly based on real-life events and characters. However, please keep in mind that Le Carr applied much creative writing to ""life & deeds"" of real-life figures and, in case of the ""Soviet mole"", based on Kim Philby, he tweaked it quite a bit. La Carr admitted later that that he hated Philby and he had him in mind while writing the book. The book (& film) was, in some strange way, a letter to Philby from Le Carr, a letter to Moscow. Philby was living in Russia as a defector at a time - he received the book in Moscow (I am not sure if he watched the film).

Kim Philby, a Soviet super-spy, was ironically a son of a British imperialist, St. John Philby, a personal friend of Ibn Saud, a founder of the State of Saudi Arabia. The Le Carr fiction intervenes often: Philby was recruited in 1934 (not in 1945 as in film & book). He was recruited a COMINTERN agent Arnold Deutch, a Viennese Jew, who himself was acting from anti-fascist motivations. Philby interests were not monetary, he was not particularly anti-American, and he was never a conservative (Le Carr ""mole"" was a conservative as a student, liked the money and hated America). If fact, Philby's belief in Socialism was completely home-grown and it started early during his Cambridge days. In 1929 he had been shocked by what he had seen on a cycling holiday around the depressed, dirt-poor areas of the Black Country in England. After that holiday, he joined the Trinity college Marxist cell, because he believed the English ruling classes were the Haves who didn't care about the Have Nots.

Still, it is good fiction and a good film and a far better one than its silly sequel ""Smiley People"". The ""Tinker"" cast is first-class; Alec Guinness plays George Smiley with poise, humor, and class. He was one of few unique actors who could communicate nuances with a change of facial expression. It is a film for those who like more ""thinking"" and less action; it is a contra-""Bourne Identity"" film. The script is true to the book. Smiley's task is not just to find a Russian mole, but to fight off Her Majesty own secret service, which at times seems like a more daunting task. I recommend it.",1292371200,2,2433,4.562929061784897

1736707,5,B00006A8T3,"This six-episode 1979 BBC adaptation of John le Carre's 1974 classic spy novel is arguably the best TV mini-series ever, and certainly the best based on an espionage theme.  As aging master spy George Smiley, Alec Guiness (not a frequent presence on the small screen) conveys more with a stare through his bottle-bottom glasses or a grimace than most actors can with Hamlet's soliloquy.  The performances of the supporting cast, including Bernard Hepton (the sleazy lamplighter Toby Esterhase), Ian Richardson (the dashing Bill Haydon), and Ian Bannen (the tragic sacrificial lamb who is shot in the back in Czechoslovakia), are so perfect that it is impossible to imagine anyone else in their roles.  Even future Star Trekker Patrick Stewart is outstanding in a non-speaking role as Smiley's nemesis, the enigmatic Soviet spymaster Karla.  The plot derives its inspiration from the real-life Communist ""moles"" who penetrated the British intelligence service in the early Cold War (Philby, Burgess, Maclean, Blunt), but the style of the novel and mini-series more closely resembles an Agatha Christie country house mystery than a cloak-and-dagger thriller.  There is more talk than action, and the viewer either has to be familiar with the novel or really up on his game to follow the plot's twists and turns.  And for younger viewers, who may consider the Cold War as remote as World War I, there could be a struggle to understand why it matters if the Soviets have penetrated the British spy service (given the fictional name The Circus).  But it is a ripping good yarn, and as beautifully filmed as it is acted.  I've always enjoyed ""Tinker Tailor"" more than the sequel ""Smiley's People"" (the second book in the Karla trilogy, ""The Honorable Schoolboy,"" was never translated to TV, although its protagonist Jerry Westerby, played by the well-recognized Joss Ackland, plays a small part in ""Tinker Tailor""), largely because ""Tinker Tailor"" is filmed with evocative dark tones that relect the mood of deception and shadow.

1736708,5,B00006A8T3,"I've dutifully read all the earlier reviews, and most echo my own opinion (so many intelligent, discriminating readers!). Here's my response.

A few complained about the slow pace. It does seem ponderous at times, but if you watch carefully and sum up at the end this is because the audience has been invited to accompany Smiley's search for the sleeper; given this, it is only fair to let us hear the details. Long, talky, expository -- guilty as charged. But no detail is wasted. Every conversation includes critical background and clues. It requires careful attention and consideration to enjoy this story; my only disappointment (and that exceeding slight) was that the identification of the sleeper as Bill Hayden was perhaps too clearly signaled.

As it happens, I had not read the novel when it was published (I was busy being a lieutenant in Viet Nam's somewhat warmer version of the Cold War) and saw the miniseries first. Ever after I have seen the characters (who appeared in later books, including the wonderful collection of reminiscences Secret Pilgrim) from the BBC production as I read. In particular this includes Bernard Hepton's wonderful portrayal of Tobe Esterhase, a ""cheap Austro-Hungarian in an expensive suit"" and bearer of the name of an earlier cheap spy from the Dreyfus affair.

As to the supposed downscale casting philosophy -- the ensemble was made up principally of stage actors, I thought appropriately. The relative anonymity added, I believe, to the general atmosphere -- we were seeing the actual spies, not Richard Burton or Sean Connery, both of whom appeared in adaptations of Le Carre novels.",1258761600,4,1633,5.063197026022305

1736712,5,B00006A8T3,"This series from the BBC is probably great. Probably because it has everything it needs to be great and yet it sounds in the end a little bit sad, too slow, too obvious to be true, believable and such stories need to be believed. It is one of the most beautiful story from the Cold War, about the fable of the Russian spy inside the spying service of Her gracious British Queen. The main interest is how the service is paralyzed by inside hostilities, inside vanities, inside rivalries that kill all possible initiatives to find out who is embedded in the comfortable armchairs of that service. The secret services and spying services of any country become complacent after a while and that's the way you can infiltrate them in no time. You just have to play the superficial game of faithfulness and fidelity and orthodoxy and blind obedience, and then you can do what you want and become the best Russian spy ever. When finally someone arrives from ahigh to investigate he becomes the object and target of absolutely all hostilities and jealousies and everyone is ready to kill him if necessary, poison or handguns are best. That's the only real interest of this series. The patriotic motivations of the good spies are superficial and in fact not argument-supported at all. It is something that is considered as natural: every patriot loves his or her country and is ready to die for it. Then the motivations of the Russian spy are just as superficial, dealing with the hypocrisy of this democracy where so few people have real power and real control over the life of millions of powerless subjects who are lured by the baits of elections. Standard communist discourse from these old years of the 1950s and 1960s. The final touch is how the surveillance of this spy under custody is so loose that he can get an appointment from someone outside, get out of the building and get ""liberated"" by his own assassination in a peaceful park. In other words they let him organize his own final exit. Hypocrisy we were saying. It is far more shameful cynicism. But the series is played so well by so good actors. That's the best part of British TV: real actors are acting in the series and not beginners or mediocre middle aged non-entities. It is a real pleasure, even if the small screen of this medium reduces these actors to close-up shots and hardly anything else.

1736720,5,B00006A8T3,"The BBC's superb dramatization of John Le Carre's ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" features Alec Guinness in an absolutely pitch-perfect role as George Smiley, a world-weary Cold Warrior called out of uneasy retirement to find a Soviet mole in the British Secret Service.

The movie opens with a secret British mission into Czechoslovakia, in which Control, the head of ""The Circus"", hopes to find a vital clue to the identity of a suspected Soviet spy inside the Secret Service.  The public failure of the mission and the wounding of the British agent lead to the usual housecleaning; Control, and his deputy George Smiley, are abruptly retired.

The plot fast-forwards.  Smiley, now in unhappy retirement, is approached by Lacon, a civil servant administrator of the intelligence services, to do an off-the-books investigation of some untidy wreckage of the Czech mission.  Under Smiley's patient but ruthless examination, the trail of a Soviet mole becomes apparent, and a clever trap is laid.  The climax of the story is a confrontation at a safe house at which the identity of the mole is finaly revealed.  Will it be Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, or Spy?  Each nickname refers to a prominent member of the secret service whom the storyline is careful to paint as a plausible candidate for mole.

This is a very British production in that the storyline is advanced by conversations between the characters.  There are few action scenes.  The show demands close viewing; the viewer receives details at the same rate as the characters, building to an almost unbearable suspense as Smiley, assisted by a handful of more or less willing collaborators, closes in on the traitor.

The series, adapted by the talented Arthur Hopcraft for the screen,  follows LeCarre's complex novel rather closely, giving us the intriguing plot developments,the well-rounded characters, and the witty dialogue.  Furthermore, the BBC hired some of the best available actors for the many principal roles, and surrounded them with all the extras, the cars, and the location shooting any viewer could wish.

The plot concerns George Smiley, forcibly retired, along with a number of his good-guy friends, from Britain's spy service, called ""the circus"" by Le Carre.  It is realized that there may be, within the spy service, a mole: a term created by leCarre himself to describe a person recruited in the past, and worked into a sensitive position, before being awakened to start reporting on his surroundings.  To, in this case, Smiley's opposite number, the feared Karla, chief of the ruthless Russian spy machine.  As it is realized that there is such a person working, and he is responsible for an unthinkably large amount of damage, including the deaths of several spy networks, and the dismissals of Smiley and friends, Smiley is drafted to locate him. But Smiley must work in secret, with only limited help from the official circus.

Alec Guiness plays Smiley with an instinctive understanding of the character that has seldom been bettered.  He is, as mentioned previously, surrounded by some of the best actors available: Bernard Hepton as Tobe Esterhase, chief of the go-to boys; Ian Richardson as the mysterious Bill Haydon, Ian Bannen as the victimized Jim Prideaux, Alexander Knox as Control.  Also Michael Jayston as Peter Guillam, Smiley's protege; Anthony Bate as Oliver Lacon, seasoned bureaucratic infighter; George Sewell as Inspector Mendel; Terence Rigby, and Michael Aldredge.  There's only one casting mis-step; Hywell Bennett as Ricky Tarr, the spy whose unthinking love affair, with a pretty Soviet agent, begins the unraveling of the circus's dark secret.  Bennett, who was the pretty-boy flavor of the month back then, simply cannot hold the screen with all these heavyweights.

It requires some patience, and full attention, to follow this intelligent series, that sometimes moves too slowly for American tastes, but those efforts are surely rewarded.  This series is John LeCarre, and the BBC, at their best. However, you might want to be sure you can watch it on successive nights, rather than as it was originally shown, on a weekly basis: it's a lot easier on the memory that way.",1173916800,10,3408,6.056133056133056
1736727,3,B00006A8T3,"Whether or not you enjoy ""Tinker, Tailor"" will depend largely on your opinion of Le Carre. Personally, every time I read a Le Carre novel I promise myself I will never read another.

For me, the problem with Le Carre is how oblique and indirect his narratives are. I think Le Carre assumes a level of familiarity with the intelligence game that is just not realistic. For example, in ""Tinker, Tailor"", he never names the agency. Instead, it is referred to merely as ""the Circus"". This would be permissible if he first identified the agency and then told the reader the insiders' name for it. But Le Carre never does. He presumes too much.

That being said, I found ""Tinker, Tailor"" to be fairly watchable - especially the second half - due to the strength of Sir Alec Guinness' performance. Perhaps I am biased since Sir Alec is one of my favorite actors (this due to the fact that he features prominently in my Holy Trinity of Film - ""Lawrence of Arabia"", ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" and ""Doctor Zhivago"").",1168819200,7,1010,4.574585635359116

It's slow-moving, lacks action, the characters speak ""English"" which is hard for Americans to follow, and the story-line is confusing and obscure. Other than that it's my all-time favorite spy novel and the best mini-series ever put on TV.  Well, except maybe for ""Lonesome Dove.""

To summarize, George Smiley, the anti-James Bond spy -- pathetic in love, bespectacled, old, and overweight -- detects a Russian ""mole"" in ""the Circus"" -- the British spy agency and sets out to find out who it is. Alec Guinness as Smiley gets more meaning with a raised eyebrow than most actors do with a Shakespeare soliloquy.  The supporting cast is large and made up of faceless, but superb, BBC actors. The tenor is dark, dreary, and seedy -- again the opposite of James Bond.

  The six one-hour parts of the mini-series allow plenty of time for the story to unfold and for the watcher to enjoy the little bits of acting, scenery, and growing tension along the way. You don't feel rushed watching TTSS -- but if you turn your head you'll miss something important.  It helps to have read the novel beforehand; that cuts down on the suspense but helps you comprehend.

  TTSS is not the end of the story.  When you've digested these six hours you must proceed onward to watch the equally good ""Smiley's People"" which concludes Smiley's quest to hunt down ""Karla,"" the fabled Russian spymaster. George Smiley may be the archtypal character of the Cold War and TTSS may go down in history as the best fiction written and filmed about this intense 45-year era. TTSS and ""Smiley's People"" are the anti-epics of the period.

1736730,5,B00006A8T3,"Turning a Le Carre novel into spell-binding entertainment, whether on the big screen or, as here, on BBC TV, is no sure thing - even for Le Carre's great works. Director John Irvin and Alec Guinness (the latter in the role of poor cuckolded George Smiley) pulled it off with smashing success.

This 1979 mini-series is well worth buying. It tells the tale of the search for a mole high up in British intelligence. This story is based, of course, on the real-life British mole, H.A.R. 'Kim' Philby. The movie beautifully portrays the upper class snobbishness that ruled (probably still does) British intelligence. George Smiley will not be put off the trail as he steadily pursues his prey. Take your time watching this one - and be prepared to use the rewind button - the story is not spoon fed to the viewer.

An immensely enjoyable few hours for anyone who enjoys an intelligent thriller. Highly recommended.",1167350400,17,910,4.789808917197452

1736734,5,B00006A8T3,"Of all of fiction's spies, Smiley, the master of bureaucratic warfare, is the most believable.  Casualties in the Cold War were few, at least in the rich countries.  The Cold War was a shadow war largely fought by men like Smiley - grey, methodical and alert to any inconsistency, whose battlefields were the minutes of obscure committees and the cross-referencing of appointments to junior posts in trade missions in filthy third world provincial capitals.

It is this battle of the bureaucrats that is depicted in Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, and it is depicted with such biting accuracy that one forgets just how daring a screen play as lacking in action as this is.  It is hard to imagine a television commissioning editor these days, especially in the BBC, going ahead with a series with an opening as somnolescently cryptic as this one - four men in suits enter a room, unannounced, undescribed, reading and smoking but saying nothing.  There is no music or subtitle.  After perhaps a minute, one of them says, ""We are ready to begin.""  And so begins one of the most beautifully crafted series in television history.

This series, as said, doesn't major on action.  The mystery is as complex and difficult to piece together as any good spy mystery, but the plot is fairly simple - Smiley must uncover the traitor before he does any more damage.  What this series excels at is character and atmosphere - it evokes the 1970s wonderfully, a 1970s where Britain was managed into genteel decline by chain-smoking toffs in expensive suits who harked after the lost battles of an Empire they loathed and repined for at the same time.  There are no two dimensional characters, no cardboard cutouts here - everyone is delightfully rounded, even the extras.

The Empire is all but forgotten now, as is the post-Imperial malaise which followed it; the tension in the British establishment between pro- and anti-Americans remains, but the Cold War has been replaced by new conflicts, more clear cut and without the shadow of the bomb.  We are unlikely to find well-heeled Cambridge graduates from the dominant ethnic group running off to join al-Qa'eda these days.

The toffs haven't gone, but they have mutated - gone into camouflage.  While continuing to send their children to the best schools, they have mockney demoticised their accents, swapped their suits for fleeces and banned smoking from their offices.  This series beautifully evokes the Britain of the 1970s, in the silent period between the two social revolutions of the `60s and the `80s.

In general, the television series is very faithful to the book and all the better for it.  It drifts off more at the end, and two of the last three scenes are the weakest of the series.  That's not enough to ruin a brilliant series.",1142294400,35,2782,4.868365180467091

Control gives each of the presumed spies are given a name based on the child's rhyme Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Sailor, Richman, Poorman, Beggerman, Theif.  When the operation is compromised, then a shakeup happens at the Circus and George is out in the cold.

When a new information super highway, Merlin, is about to happen Control enlists George to find the mole.

The following are the suspects:

Tinker - Percy Alleline (Michael Aldridge), the new head of the Circus.

Tailor - Bill Haydon (Ian Richardson), new head of the London branch

Soldier - Roy Bland (Terence Rigby), a high level operative

Poorman - Toby Esterhase (Bernard Hepton), head of the Lamplighters - internal security force

Beggerman - George Smiley, no longer a suspect

To determine the mole, George must unearth secrets from the past.  Some of which are better buried.

This is the best spy movie ever, It is complex but not to the point you can't follow.  The performances are superb.  Alec Guiness shows why he is considered one of the greatest actors ever.

1736754,5,B00006A8T3,"Will the endless debates over the transformation of a book into a film ever be resolved?  More than one TV miniseries has shown how proper casting and directing can produce some outstanding successful conversions.  Even so, few approach the excellent production of John Irvin's rendition of John Le Carre's famous spy thriller.  With superb casting and close following of the original story, Irvin has produced an almost flawless conversion of a narrative into a visual presentation.

Irvin's success might have rested on his capture of Alec Guiness to play George Smiley.  Irvin, however, collected a stunning array of talent to portray one of the world's great spy stories.  If you've read the book, you will see Le Carre's characters come to life with rarely seen precision.  Guiness, of course, is an incomparable George Smiley.  Reserved, unquenchable, distanced from both the ones he loves and despises, he carries an intense story with practiced ease.  His task seems insurmountable - how to find a long-established ""mole"" within ""The Circus"".  This agency, run by a driven man close to his dotage, has been penetrated by a Soviet agent right at the top of the hierarchy.  ""There are three of them, plus Alleline"" - ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier"" with one the traitor  that must be unearthed.

Irvin is able to keep the suspense at its height as George, the one man deemed trustworthy to ""Go backwards, George?  Go forwards?"" in the words of Foreign Office functionary Oliver Lacon [Anthony Bate] who brings Smiley filched records each night to peruse.  Tucked away in a seedy hotel used as his headquarters, Smiley must sift through skimpy evidence to pinpoint the traitor.  Is it Toby Esterhazy [Bernard Hepton] the Hungarian migr now more British than Control himself?  Roy Bland?  Or the effete and pompous Bill Haydon, who has designs on George's distant wife Ann?  None have real apparent motives beyond ambition for the top.  Irvin keeps us in the same level of suspense Le Carre achieved with the novel.  Guiness carries the story through with aplomb, Irvin's direction and camera work adding to the story's intensity.

There are few flaws in this film.  Some of them are even invisible.  An interview with Le Carre himself reveals that the medieval visual wonders of Prague are actually of a Scottish city!  A character that opens the story is returned in a string of vignettes.  You wonder what brings a crippled agent back to centre stage.  It is Irvin's only failure that he omits the scenes from the book imparting Jim Prideaux's [Ian Bannen] intense British patriotism.  The omission weakens the series' conclusion, making it less ambivalent than the original novel.  That aspect, however, will be missed only by those who know the book.  Even someone who's never read the book will find this series captivating.  It's something to be watched again and again.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]",1137196800,7,2913,5.01670146137787

1736756,5,B00006A8T3,"If you like your spy stories full of explosions, naked women and car chases this is not for you. In this story the spys are for the most part middle aged, upper class civil servants involved at much in office politics as finding out Russian secrets. That said the story is gripping and if you miss even a couple of minutes, you will have to rewind in order to follow whats happening.

Set for the most part in a grey winters London and an even greyer British countryside,the story revolves around retired British spy George Smiley, who is called out of an inforced retirement to catch the Russian 'mole' who is at the heart of the British intelligence service. With only a couple of helpers Smilet does this by talking to people and going through the files. If this sounds dull it most certainly is not. The plot contains many flashbacks and at only at times does Smiley's iron charactor show through his shyness and nature good manners.

There is not a weak performance in the show with ever actor being perfect for the part they play. Alec Guinness is outstanding as Smiley, but look out for Hywel Bennett as Ricki Tarr, the spy who discovers the existence, but not the idenity of Mole. Tarr is also the nearest thing that the Circus (Britist Inteligence) has to James Bond. Ian Bannen is also in top form as Jim Prideaux the spy betrayed to and tortured by the Russians.

Alec Guinness stars as the guy who's picked to root the mole out.  The thing was a made-for-TV BBC production from 1979, so this was a couple of years after his first Star Wars appearance.  It is carefully directed, meticulously written, and impressively performed.

Oh, yes:  it's a subtle, carefully crafted spy film, not for the dilettante:  6 hours long (2 1-hour episodes on each disk.)  It's not James Bondian:  most of the film is pure dialogue, and action is infrequent.

Unfortunately, I didn't get a lot out of it because I didn't bring to it the patience and the attention that the script requires.  This is one of those movies you can't have on the background:  one must pay strict attention.

Don't make my mistake:  get a piece of paper and write down all the characters' names to get everything sorted out from the beginning.  You'll get a lot more out of it that way.

As for me, I spaced out for about twenty minutes or so during the second disk, and was pretty much lost thereafter.  So I wasn't blown away.  Sadly, I'm not in the mood to go back through it, now that I know ""who did it.""

The thing I don't understand about people who like these kind of films is this:  if you've enough patience and attention to negotiate a highly literate and tightly written script like this, what are you doing spending your time on superficial spy movies rather than on something more substantial?  I don't get it.

And a final sour note concerning Guinness' performance, which has been hailed as magisterially understated:  I'm not convinced it was ""all that.""  I found it unmemorable and utterly lacking in charisma.  Could it be that Guinness, in the twilight of his career, simply didn't have any ideas for this character?

Cultural side-note:  consider how phony, silly, and unconvincing the ""anti-West"" speech at the end now strikes us in the wake of 9-11, the Islamization of Europe, and the collapse of the Iron Curtain.",1124323200,5,2080,4.686980609418282
1736760,5,B00006A8T3,"Don't blink.  Don't leave the room to attend to business with the television running.  Hit the pause button.  This is advice for those unfamiliar with the plot of John le Carr's TINKER, TAILOR, SOLDIER, SPY.  There is a heck of a lot going on here, a basketful of characters and three major subplots introduced in the first two episodes of this six-episode mini-series.

  TINKER, TAILOR is a sinuous story of a mole in high places in the British Secret Service, also known as the Circus to insiders.  Called out of retirement, a rather premature retirement, we learn, George Smiley (Alec Guinness) is called on to uncover the British official selling secrets to the Soviet enemies.

  In the interesting 2002 30-minute interview on disk one writer le Carr tells us that after the initially reluctant Guinness signed on everyone wanted to work on the project, and this mini-series is studded with great actors.  Fortunately so, too, because this movie takes place around restaurant tables and in dingy `safe' houses more often than in exciting, exotic locales.  This one belongs to actors who can deliver in tight close-ups much more so than to special effects wizards who can blow things up prettily.

  At the center of it is Guinness, who, in my opinion, is simply brilliant.  In the interview le Carr mentions that Guinness was always shaving lines off the script, reducing his role, so to speak.  Wasn't good at memorizing lines.  There's more to it than that, though.  Guinness approach is minimalist to practical non-existence.  I probably won't be able to convey it, but somehow Guinness makes little to no impression.  There aren't the stream of dramatic utterances, or even the little bits of business (fumbling with a tie, for instance) that most actors seem to love.  Usually, the only time we see a real reaction is when a character has his back to Smiley/Guinness and mentions Smiley's wife Ann.  Then the reaction, small enough, in context is powerful because it manages to break through the carefully crafted mask.  Guinness realizes Smiley as a spy, a man who's genius is to make no impression, to cast no shadows and leave no clues.  In lesser hands, which is pretty much anyone else you could mention, this approach would be unutterably bland, but Guinness's blandness is at times almost dazzling.

I found the whole thing to be excellent, and it benefited greatly from being able to watch it end-to-end, without any week-long breaks. Ian Richardson puts in a sterling performance as the tea and biscuit, too-cool-for-words, bad guy, and Alec Guiness does a fine job as well, as the dogged investigator.

There is a ""mole"" in the ""circus."" The mole is working for the now-defunct USSR, at the height of the cold war. I'm still not sure what the circus is, but it is a division of British intelligence. George Smiley (Alec Guinness) was thrown out of his job at the circus, following the death of his mentor, Control, the head of the circus. Or should I call him the ringleader?

Now Smiley is called back into action to sniff out and expose the mole. He interviews a complex cast of characters, reviews secret files, and eventually sets a trap. As this unfolds over 6 hours, you will be drawn in by the performances, the possible solutions to the mystery, the utter believability and class with which this mini-series was made.

After seeing it once, I immediately wanted to watch it again. There is so much detail in the series, so many characters, you cannot possibly catch it all in the first viewing, unless you already read the book. It would be worth watching twice just for the note-perfect performances of the entire cast.

This was no Hollywood production. It was filmed in 16mm, and that's the only drawback to the DVD. It is grainy, and not especially clear. The DVD probably represents the print fairly well. I would have preferred that the company who mastered this DVD set had invested some effort in digitally cleaning up the video before releasing it. The visual quality is akin to what you might have seen in those old documentary movies in grade school if you're old enough to remember when they used to actually show films instead of videos.

The soundtrack is great for understanding the dialog. There is not much dynamic range, and the music is not impressively reproduced. It is what it is. It is adequate to the task, nothing more.

1736807,5,B00006A8T3,"Where does one start when commenting on the top echelon of film making?  How about starting with the principal of this film, Sir Alec Guinness?

Honestly, cinema does not get any better than this.  John Le Carre's excellent book is brought to real, gritty, desperate life by this BBC production.  I've read the book (the first of Le Carre's I read, as a matter of fact), and I was curious to learn if the rich, dark, texture of the novel could be captured on film.  Happily, it has been.

Loosely based upon the story of a real Soviet mole, Kim Philby, the film looks at spycraft as it must be; lots of partial information one tries to make sense of, hunches based upon a lifetime of working in the dark, engaged in a war of sorts, mainly cold, but occasionally very, very hot.

Guinness is George Smiley, one of the most famous names in fictional spycraft literature.  His nemesis is Karla (played by a pre-Star Trek Patrick Stewart), a Soviet spy who almost matches Smiley step for step.  Smiley is a retired British agent, who is asked to return to help ferret out a Soviet mole in the British secret service.

Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy takes you into the world of the game as it is really played (or one imagines it as such).  Who do you trust?  Who is on your side?  Who is willing to compromise to get ahead in the bureaucracy, and who is willing to sell his country out completely?  The rewards are few and fleeting, the costs heavy and sometimes overwhelming, but the game must be played for one's country, for one's duty.  One perseveres and muddles on.

Full of surprises, excellent acting, great settings, and heavy on atmosphere, this is as good as it gets.  Others have said that it is a bit too full of twists and turns to easily follow.  Having some familiarity with the book, I didn't find it so.  However, even if that is true, then just watch it again!  I've seen it several times, and, as any work of art, it is full of layers and details that will reveal themselves with subsequent viewing.

MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  Any chance that one has of watching a master at work, Guinness is a joy, but watch this master at the top of his craft, in a film worthy of such a performance. (BTW, the American version is 26 minutes shorter than the British version.  I'm not sure what's been cut, but it seems a shame to cut a second from such a film!)",1093651200,23,2362,4.416666666666667
1736808,5,B00006A8T3,"The first time I saw TINKER,TAILER, SOLDIER, SPY, it almost frightened me out of my wits.  Of course when it aired on PBS the Cold War was on and the thought that spies were hidden in plain sight was terrifying.  As a child growing up under the threat of Nuclear disaster in the days when we had `drills' and crawled under our desks, I thought the nightmare would never end. When Kim Philby was exposed as a traitor in the British Secret Spy Service everyone was asking `Who can we trust'.  Philby had been recruited as a young student at Cambridge (I think), by a Communist who was his handler until he was exposed as a spy.  I believe John Le Carr was inspired by this incident when he wrote his now famous books become tv thrillers.

 The beauty of this film series is that the producers gave the plot time to develop, so if you watch it carefully you won't get lost even though the story is complex. Every detail of the context of London is lovingly portrayed and beautifully reflects the period which in the Philby case occurred. If you are an Anglophile, you will want to buy this series if for no other reason than to view it and engage in nostalgic reflection as it was shot before London was `overdeveloped' with towering modern office buildings.

 The cast is stellar-Sir Alec Guinness as George Smily, British Secret Agent par excellent; Ian Richardson as Bill Haydon, Smiley's nemesis at the Circus and in bed with his wife Ann (Sin Phillips); Ian Bannen as Jim Predeaux, betrayed British Agent; Patrick Stewart as Karla, Russian master spy; Bernard Hepton as the colorful Circus member-the unforgettable Hungarian `dandy"" Toby Esterhase (MANSEFIELD PARK); and other familiar BBC faces. Sadly, many these actors are now gone.

 I did not experience the same fear on rewatching this series as I had before, perhaps because I had seen it, but I also think it has to do with missing a worthy opponent. Le Carr humanized the communists and made the whole Cold War spy business dreadfully sad.  Say what you will about the Communists, they never blew up huge office buildings in New York filled with civilians.",1093651200,25,2117,4.663978494623656
1736809,5,B00006A8T3,"As far as the spy genre goes, the Cold War was the good ole days.  Previous generations of spy thrillers from authors like Eric Ambler focused on the nefarious undertaking of spies from various Balkan countries and other corners of Europe, but with the onset of the nonshooting war between the West and the Soviet Union, the spy genre reached its zenith.  Just before the collapse of the Soviet bloc and the ending of the Cold War, John LeCarre managed to perfect the spy novel in a series of great works.  Two of these novels were brought together to produce two amazing television masterpieces:  TINKER, TAILOR, SOLDIER, SPY and SMILEY'S PEOPLE.  Smiley is the polar opposite of James Bond.  Physically unattractive, elderly, unathletic, a cuckold many times over, not a master gunman, George Smiley nonetheless emerges as the quintessential master spy, with a razor sharp mind, always keeping his own counsel, and dissecting every situation with impeccable logic.

The success of the television adaptation was assured the second they recruited Alec Guinness to play George Smiley.  The Smiley of the novels does not in most ways resemble Alec Guinness.  Smiley is reported as resembling a frog, of always wearing expensive but ill fitting clothes, of being extremely fat, none of which is true of Guinness.  But there is one way in which Guinness is perfect for the role, and which makes him a huge success in the series:  Smiley is described by LeCarre as possessing a beautiful, sonorous, honey-like voice.  It is no exaggeration to say that Guinness's voice dominates this series.  Even if the series had done nothing else well, Guinness would have made the series a success.

Nonetheless, the production brought a great deal more to the table than Alec Guinness.  The script is exceptional, and while it does not function on as high an artistic level as the novel (which is very well written indeed), it does preserve much of the complexity of the novel's plot.  LeCarre makes the reader work, and understanding the novel TINKER, TAILOR, SOLDIER, SPY is not the simple exercise that reading Robert Ludlum or other spy novelists is.  Frankly, I found it enormously refreshing to have to work hard at understanding a TV miniseries.  The hardness is not superfluous, but central to the mood of the story.  The complexity mirrors the moral complexity of the situation the characters find themselves in.  The makers of the series could have simplified the plot, could have made everything that was happening clear from the outset, but it would have thereby distorted the story.  The opening credits begin with a shot of those Russian dolls that open to reveal a still smaller doll inside.  The story is one of layers beneath layers, like unpeeling an onion.  The complexity of the narrative enhances this.

The cast is large and superb.  Although Guinness is clearly the star, a host of superb actors like Ian Carmichael and Joss Acklund fill out one of the most talented casts in television history.  A pre-STAR TREK Patrick Stewart has a small but crucial appearance as Smiley's arch nemesis Karla (he returns in SMILEY'S PEOPLE).  On one level, not very much happens in TINKER, TAILOR, SOLDIER, SPY.  Mainly there is a great deal of talk, but it is glorious talk, made all the better by the superb cast.  But the best thing in the series remains the character of George Smiley and the host of contradictions he contains.  One thrills at his mastery, especially near the end when he masterfully gathers together all the threads of the mystery and with utter ease overwhelms his opposition, and yet feels pity for him in the closing scenes, where he flutters around his wayward wife, the infamous Ann, as flustered as a schoolboy.

Luckily, the George Smiley saga did not end with this series, but continued in SMILEY'S PEOPLE, in which his struggle against his KGB opponent Karla is brought to a satisfying end.",1092009600,121,3915,4.904255319148936
1736810,5,B00006A8T3,"Tinker, Tailor and Smiley's People stand as two of the best television shows of all time in the mystery genre.  For purposes of this review, I will concentrate on Tinker, Tailor; but what I say is equally valid for Smiley's People.

First, the acting is wonderful.  Starting with Alec Guinness as George Smiley, secret agent and sometimes head of The Circus (the Enqlish equivalent of the CIA), the casting is perfect, down to the last bit player.  Guinness, unfortunately dead now, was an accomplished actor and his performaces in The Lavender Hill Mob, Bridge over the River Kwai, Tunes of Glory, Dr. Zhivago, etc., set the bar high for all other actors.  As George Smiley he is intelligent, patient, tough, obsservant, thoughtful, and relentless.  When he is on screen it makes sense to watch his every move and listen carefully to everything he says.  He has the difficult problem of trying to find a mole in the Circus.  This mole has established deep cover and only George Smiley has the skill, intelligence, and know-how to ferret him out.  Watching Smiley at work is a clinic in detective work.

As I have suggested, the story is complicated and involved.  Thanks to television, we have the time to follow each clue to the end.  Smiley assembles his crew of talented sleuths and begins to collect the evidence that will eventually lead him to the traitor.  Many plot twists and turns contribute to the mounting evidence Smiley needs to make his case, including the infidelity of his wife, the lovely Ann.

Each strand of the plot needs special handling.  From ambush in the woods of Czechoslovakia to the inner sanctum of the Circus, everything seems real and our involvement in the story is total. No false notes occur anywhere in Tinker, Tailor, or Smiley's People for that matter.

Tinker, Tailor is cerebral, not action oriented; although enough action takes place to satisfy most viewers.  This film is dark, quiet, and reflective, the mirror of George Smiley's mind.  No happy endings here and no easy answers to the problem of Britain's fast fading influence in the world.

Tinker, Tailor works on every level and must be considered one of the finest films made for television in the espionage genre.  Superb.",1091491200,11,2224,4.86436170212766
