6515982,1,B00LYD887Y,"She's a vane, rude, narcissistic, self-entitled wannabe model who claims she deserves to be in Playboy. Within about 15 minutes into this documentary you will not give a crap one way or the other. The only thing I took away from this movie is that you should follow your dreams.. however you might want to make sure your dreams have more of a purpose before you go and ruin your life chasing them.

Spoiler alert: She doesn't make it past a party at the playboy mansion. She banked on the idea that having big boobs is all you need to get in Playboy, and she banked wrong. And in the end it all amounts to nothing... including this boring film.",1416355200,28,644,4.366666666666666
6515983,1,B00LYD887Y,Not an interesting documentary. Precious (the woman being documented) is not personable or endearing. Why should we care for her? It all rings shallow. There is no tension anywhere to keep the viewer interested. Precious has an obsession with bigger breasts. She wants to be featured in Playboy. At the end of the movie her dream comes true and she hangs out with Hugh Hefner. With that synopsys you just saved yourself over one hour of flat (no pun intended) viewing. After the first 25 minutes I lost interest I started doing other things while listening to the narrative in the background.,1416009600,7,592,4.813725490196078

I would love to know if she feels her aspirations to be a Playboy model  contributed to the downfall of her marriage. Or maybe it didn't at all. I'm glad she admitted that she should not have kept the surgery from her parents. But, I understand that too. She is an adult and she didn't want the negative reaction & possibility of changing her mind. It really made me angry that her father made some lame excuse not to attend her wedding. I always worry about women in this industry. It is inevitable that they will age out of this industry. I hope she has a back-up plan.",1414800000,2,672,4.2421875

6516052,1,B00LYD887Y,"Woman gets totally unnecessary boob job, chooses far too large sized implants, ends up with saline implants that are virtually under her chin.

She insists on under the armpit incision because, as a model, she ""doesn't want any scars.""

Surgeon warns her his preference is NOT under the armpit because there is higher risk for (drum roll) exactly what ends up happening to her.

After 6 months of boobs that stay under her chin and don't fall into place where natural breasts would be positioned, she ends up having a corrective surgery where (drum roll) the surgeon does an incision under the breast like he suggested in the first damn place!

Thankfully, for her, despite the implants still being too large for her size, they look uncharacteristically realistic (for implants).

But to get through all that you have to deal with Precious, a charmless, petulant woman with a sweet, long-suffering boyfriend who doesn't want her to have the surgery but supports her and nurses her through the complications.

It's bizarre that she alone was considered worth filming. Nothing about her story is unique.

Complications from surgery with women and transsexuals who don't listen to their plastic surgeons because they want stripper boobs is not exactly unusual or ""must see"" television.",1455235200,5,1282,5.076190476190476

6516116,3,B00LYD887Y,"I guess the question is, what documentary do you want to see? IMHO, a more relevant, more interesting documentary would follow at least three or four different women, with different motivations, of varying age, cultural backgrounds, economic status, etc. allowing a broader review of the place of body modification, and breast augmentation in particular, in society today. It's been done before, but the technology and techniques have advanced, and cultural expectations, pressures, and freedoms of women have evolved.

This film, on the other hand, is focused on just one person, and a very much _non_-representative individual at that. I would say that the one thing she probably has in common with most young women who are having ""boob jobs"" is her relatively low self-esteem, and the fact that ultimately, having her breasts enlarged does nothing to improve her looks (which were fantastic to start with...she looks different after, of course, but not at all _better_). But as a professional model, she is driven also by strong economic forces, as well as a personal goal that I doubt is shared by most women.

In terms of helping anyone understand the issues around breast augmentation generally, I'd say the film mostly fails. The most informative moments are when the surgeon is on-camera, speaking about what Precious can expect, and so offering some general insight as to what's common among all patients. But his contributions are focused mainly on the physical, not the emotional, and constitute just a tiny part of the whole film.

On the other hand, Precious is very young, and she is creating for herself the experiences that will help her mature. It's painful to watch, mostly. From the earliest moments of the documentary, when it's so clear just how much she _doesn't_ need any sort of improvement made to her appearance, even by the unreasonably high and strict standards by which society judges people, it's not hard to guess where the story will lead her. In the end, her experience is much like the rest of ours, at least in general: there are some ups and some downs, and if she's paying attention (and it does seem possible that she is), she's learned some important things about herself in the process.

Bottom line: the production of the film was reasonably good, and while I feel it has limited informative value, there is a reasonably compelling, personal story here, in the vein of reality TV that's so popular these days.

(And for those who are so critical of the film based on the personality of the subject, a) not every film has to be about a character you like, and b) while I agree she has a certain narcissism and navet that leads her to poor decisions, greater maturity in someone so young is rare and at her age, she can afford to make some mistakes and grow from them).",1430870400,16,2808,4.841666666666667

She had some amount of success but found in her early twenties her body (in her mind) didn't keep up. It was interesting watching her make such obvious life mistakes (and paying the price). I know my daughter will just roll her eyes and say ""That won't happen to me"" but... I'm sure Precious didn't think so either. As a ""life choices"" documentary, this is pretty good.

It ended up being a self-indulgent piece about an already beautiful girl getting breast augmentation, going through a bit of a rough time, getting her boobs redone, and then all her dreams come true. They barely discussed the costs and only went over the most superficial of complications. Even the slight downside they ended on was made null and void by aggressively displaying all of the photos she has had taken since her breast surgery.
