8462259,1,B0058TZ512,not interested in nobodies either singing about her or talking about their feelings. Total waste of money. I have thrown it out,1363564800,,127,4.818181818181818
8462260,1,B0058TZ512,"I put this one in the trash after watching it! I did fast forward through most of it because it was not good, not of her music and just unknowed people talking about her and some people just promoting there own music!",1343088000,4,217,4.190476190476191
8462261,1,B0058TZ512,Contains very little information and only a few photographs of Whitney Houston. Mostly interviews with British music industry representatives and fans about their feelings regarding Houston's music and untimely death. Includes a number of songs written by fans in tribute to Houston. Not at all what the promotional information I read online or on the DVD liner itself lead me to believe I'd be watching.,1342483200,2,404,5.230769230769231
8462262,1,B0058TZ512,I wish I could be more eloquent with my wording but I prefer honesty. What I have learned is I WILL NOT buy any more of these bogus biographies on Whitney. The majority of them (THIS ONE DEFINITELY) are done by self-serving wannabe artists cashing in on Whitney's death through people that sincerely loved and admired her gift. This dvd will go into the circular file (trashcan)! Don't waste your dollars.,1340582400,5,405,4.71830985915493
