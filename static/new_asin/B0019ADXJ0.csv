3430549,5,B0019ADXJ0,"If ya ever played the video games: Dynasty Warriors or Romance of the 3 Kingdoms which are based on this China's greatest literary classic from the period epic Three Kingdoms: Resurrection of the Dragon. You'll be familier with the characters like Lie Bei, his Five Tiger Generals (>') of the Kingdom of Shu: Zhao Yun, Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Ma Chao and Huang Zhong;& thier enemy Cao Cao & Cao Pi in this film. Though big-budget Chinese epics have become a mighty familiar sight in recent years, the Three Kingdoms era and its fabled lore is rarely tackled in cinema, making this latest blockbuster from Daniel Lee (Dragon Squad, A Fighter's Blues) a groundbreaking effort. and directed by Daniel Lee with a reported budget of US$25 million. The film is one of the two Three Kingdoms-related films in 2008, the other being John Woo's Red Cliff but Deftly hitting screens before John Woo's Three Kingdoms adaptation Red Cliff, Resurrection of the Dragon is based on Luo Guangzhong's 14th-century novel which romanticizes the heroic exploits of Shu King Liu Bei and his larger-than-life generals and advisor. Maintaining his Mandarin period blockbuster streak after A Battle of Wits and The Warlords, Andy Lau stars as legendary general Zhao Zilong (better known as Zhao Yun), immortalized in both Luo's novel and in popular culture as the paragon of courage, charisma, and strength. Starting off as a foot soldier, Zhao rises quickly in the ranks to become the top general under Liu Bei (Ngok Wah). He becomes a living legend in his time with his undefeated record and staggering feats, including single-handedly rescuing Liu's infant son from the grips of Wei King Cao Cao (Damian Lau). Through the many years of war, tides rise and ebb for the Kingdom of Shu and comrades fall one by one, leaving Zhao alone as the invincible general. With his legacy at stake, Zhao leads his final expedition against a Wei army now headed by Cao Cao's granddaughter Cao Ying (Maggie ""Twinkie"" Q ).
Other than leading man Andy Lau and pan-Asian beauty Maggie Q (Mission: Impossible III), Resurrection of the Dragon features a stunning line-up of veteran actors including some of Hong Kong's greatest stars of yesteryear. Producer Sammo Hung serves as the narrator of the film in the role of Pingan, Zhao's ambitious friend of humble achievements. Damian Lau, Iron Monkey's Yu Rong Guang, and Shaw Brothers heroes Ngok Wah and Ti Lung light up the screen in welcome supporting appearances, while rising action stars Andy On and Vanness Wu lead the way for a new generation. Though it takes some liberal departures from history and the original novel, Three Kingdoms: Resurrection of the Dragon hits the mark with its epic story, sweeping images, and fierce characterization, gallantly capturing the life and times of Three Kingdoms hero Zhao Zilong. Andy Lau stars as Zhao Zilong, a veteran general of the Kingdom of Shu who took a last stand against the invading forces from the Kingdom of Wei. Maggie Q is the fictional Cao Ying, a grand-daughter of the warlord Cao Cao, whose son Cao Pi became the first emperor of the Kingdom of Wei. The story depicts an alternate history, following the events that unfolded in the Three Kingdoms era through the life of the legendary Shu general Zhao Zilong. Zhao Zilong began his military career as a soldier in Liu Bei's army. Zhao Zilong once displayed his fine spear skills to Liu Bei in a small face-off with Guan Yu and Zhang Fei. This impressed Liu Bei, and he decided to promote Zhao Zilong to the rank of a general. Zhao Zilong was bestowed with the 'All Piercing Spear'.Zhao Zilong scored his first victory in battle by outwitting Cao Cao at the Battle of Changban. He managed to rescue Liu Bei's son, A Dou from the clutches of the forces of Cao Cao by fighting them single-handedly. Cao Cao's life was put in great peril and he also lost his personal weapon to Zhao Zilong. Cao Ying, who had witnessed Zhao Zilong's acts, swore to help her grandfather regain his lost pride by capturing Zhao Zilong alive. As history passed, Zhao Zilong had never lost in any battle he fought in, hence earning himself the title of 'The Undefeated General' (Y>'R). Cao Pi forced the last ruling Han emperor to abdicate in his favour and proclaimed himself Emperor of the Kingdom of Wei. Thereafter, Liu Bei assumed the title of Emperor of Shu-Han as a spiritual successor to the fallen Han dynasty by carrying on the family name. Zhao Zilong joined the ranks of Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Ma Chao and Huang Zhong to be one of the Five Tiger Generals sworn to defend the Han imperial family.
Years after Zhuge Liang's first failed Northern Expedition, he embarked on a second expedition. Zhao Zilong had reached the age of 71 by then, hence Zhuge Liang had doubts about allowing him to join in the expedition. However his persistence ensured him a role in the expedition. The Chancellor handed him two satches, instructing him to open them as per situations. Zhao Zilong set forth on the expedition expecting to achieve a major victory once more. His first feat was the slaying of the four sons of Wei general Han De (similar to the Novel). As Han De retreated, it became obvious that it was a ploy to lure Zhao Zilong into a trap, planned by the Wei commander Cao Ying. Zhao Zilong was forced to retreat to the Yellowbird Peak. It was there where Zhao Zilong pitted his last strength against Cao Ying. In a single one-to-one duel, Zhao Zilong bouted Cao Ying but decided to let her off. During the fight, the undefeated general received a battle scar for the first time ever in his career. The surbordinate generals of Zhao Zilong engaged in a fierce battle with the Wei forces, but were defeated after Cao Ying sacrificed Han De to bring gunpowder into the battlefield. All was lost for Zhao Zilong. He stripped off his armour, picked up his Piercing Spear, and charged towards the Wei forces in a last ditch effort, swearing to defend the Yellowbird Peak, and the dignity of the Kingdom of Shu-Han with the last general and last man.",1214092800,2,6042,4.760724499523356

3430551,2,B0019ADXJ0,"There are two things I don't like about this movie.

1.  There are many major details that are not true to history. Fitstly,  Zi Long or Zhao Yun did not die in the battle. He died of old age (1). Secondly, at the battle of Chanban, Liu Bei's wife, Lady Gan was not killed. She's rescued by Zhao Yun.  Thirdly, Zhao Yun never fought with Cao Cao's niece according to history!

You can verify all the details by visiting wikipedia dot org. Sorry, I can't embed the link here. It seems Amazon is blocking that feature. If you find any other reliable website talking about the 3 kingdoms period in China, please put that information here. I'd appreciate that.

2. The acting and directing are not engaging as in other movies of the same genes such as the Warlords. The fighting scenes are so so but they're not good as the ones in the Warlords either.",1213056000,10,848,4.403846153846154

3430553,3,B0019ADXJ0,"This movie just doesn't hang together. Andy Lau is solid as Zhao Zilong, and American Maggie Q actually does a really good job as a dark warrior-general. Her Wuxia vibe felt legit to me. As far as the acting itself, the whole cast has it going on.

The problem is with the story that's supposed to be driving the characters. It covers the span of the protagonist's life in a few disjointed chunks. We're never with the characters long enough in one time and place to truly connect. As a result, it's hard to feel the nostalgia that gets poured on thick in the next scene from a decade (or 2) down the road. And not just nostalgia - the film repeatedly prompts us to experience heavy emotions of various sorts, and we'd like to oblige, but the movie hasn't done the developmental legwork to make it happen.

There's lots of martial action, but like the rest of the film, though competent it tends to fall flat. Also, for those who like some eye-candy with their Wuxia, there's very little in that department, as we're on the battlefield in full gear most of the time. A contrived puppy-love story crash lands into the narrative early on, then is just as hastily jettisoned. Maggie Q is kinda sexy in the haughty, shrewd, commanding Warrior Queen way that brings all the Wuxia boys to the yard. But, as with the other characters, the narrative treatment is too abbreviated to fan the flicker to a flame.

It's too bad. It seems there was potential here. But in the end, we're left with not much more than a clunky, uninspiring film.",1484179200,,1530,4.516245487364621

3430581,5,B0019ADXJ0,"Please note my review below solely covers the tv series overall and does not includes a review of the quality of subtitles.

In short this is one of the best adaption I seen to date. The acting is superb,in particularly Chen Jian Bin as Cao Cao for which I will discuss later.

The script is well written,and in most part you will feel particularly engaged,whether its political scheming,battle tactics or conversation. The tone ,wordings feel real and not some awkwardly modern script trying to fit to that era.

The tv series is aided by excellent cinematography ,and the battles has a realistic feel and very engaging. I believe they have solid music choices,in which this cant be said to the adaption of Monkey King around this time.

The focus is more on Cao Cao ,which causes some quibbles in some of the forums and blogs reviewers alike. What I understood the concern raised by them is on the portrayal on Cao Cao which is more of anti hero than straight out cunning villain as per portrayed in Romance novel(correct me if I'm wrong) .

Yet I believe Chen,the actor that portrays Cao Cao ,did him justice(in fact he's the star of the whole TV series).In fact in my humble opinion he nails the character entirely .From what I understand,this Cao Cao portrayal is based more on the historical Cao Cao (perhaps not 90% accurate but still) .He portrays Cao Cao with such a complexity of character (master tactician, intelligent, brave, cunning, smooth etc) which is well recorded in history. In fact,if you want to knew Cao Cao more this is a very good adaptation.

How about other characters? I believe that they are solid to very good. For both appearance and acting skills although right now none stick out of my mind other than Cao Cao and another person which I will discuss in spoilers below.

In short,this is an outstanding tv series and you will not disappointed with it especially if you are interested in that era.

If anyone wants a recommendation I will recommend YongZheng empire (and its related series ,KangXi and QianLong empires).Its more on political scheming than wars,yet its no less engaging as this one. Caution must be noted that cinematography it may not be as interesting as this one as it was filmed at least 10-20 years ago.

**Spoilers below**

I believe that the person who potrays Cao Pi ,son of Cao Cao and eventually his successor also did a very good job of him. Cao Pi was heavily vilified in history ,and this series portrayed him in a more positive light. I believed the actor captures the complexity of the character very well.",1398556800,7,2568,4.6993318485523385

The overall production of the movie and the acting is excellent. My only complaint (hence the four stars) is that the English subtitles randomly have capital ""N""'s in the dialogue. For example, ""Nit might read like Nthis"" instead of ""it might read like this"". This can be confusing when the ""N"" shows up before a Chinese name you are not familiar with or any English word starting with a vowel.

3430589,5,B0019ADXJ0,"I'm an American student who studied Chinese in an intensive immersion program a year ago.  In doing so, I quickly realized that it is extremely difficult for most Americans to enjoy Chinese music, and while China has produced some spectacular films, these are few and far between.  However, this tv show single-handedly re-ignited my interest in Chinese culture after Chinese music and movies had me disillusioned.  It is far lower budget than most American tv shows; however, the story line is incredible and the acting is out of this world.  I've spent the past year since looking for another tv series (American or Chinese) to watch, and nothing I've watched since comes even close to measuring up to Three Kingdoms.  It is even better than Game of Thrones despite its MUCH smaller budget.  To be frank, it is astonishing to me that these DVD's are only sold for $70.  I would be willing to pay at least twice that.",1375056000,14,918,4.735849056603773
3430590,5,B0019ADXJ0,"For anyone who has read the novel ""Romance of the 3 Kingdoms"" this is a great adaptation, very close to the source material and even a few things that are left out are generally mentioned in passing. The quality is excellent and this show remains the most expensive show ever made in China. The acting is superb especially the portrayal of Cao Cao, the portrayal is so well done that you will never be able to accept any other actor assigned to this role. Also a great addition is that the names of all the generals are shown when they first appear in each episode, this is really handy considering all the characters. The show starts with the reign of Dong Zhuo and ends after the Sima family usurps the Dynasty. My only slight criticism is that the show does not begin during the Yellow Turban Rebellion. Altogether this is definitely one of the best shows I have ever seen in my entire life. Any fans of the books or video games must see this series.",1374192000,14,953,4.420454545454546

3430606,4,B0019ADXJ0,"Review of the Uncut HK version.

Amid the beloved historical epic tales of the ""Battle or Romance of the Three Kingdoms"", arose three movies in 2008. The very mediocre ""Empress and the Warriors"" with Donnie Yen, and late last year came the first chapter of John Woo's ""Red Cliff"". Daniel Lee's (Dragon Squad) ""Three Kingdoms: Resurrection of the Dragon"" was released a few months earlier in Asia than Woo's star-studded film (which I will review later), and has Hong Kong's Andy Lau (Running on Karma) in the lead as the famous General Zhao Zhilong--yes the same guy in the video game named Zhao Yun in ""Dynasty Warriors"". The film has massive commercial appeal, and the film is beautifully shot. However, purists of the tales of the Three Kingdoms will be annoyed and repulsed, as the film does feel a little empty in regards to an intricate storyline and full of historical inaccuracies. (Hint: John Woo's overly exaggerated film about the three kingdoms isn't much better)

228 A.D, before the rise of the Jin Dynasty. The kingdoms of Shu, Wei and Wu are divided. Zhilong (Andy Lau) is a simple soldier from Changsan who becomes a legendary warrior under the employ of Liu (Yueh Huah) who rises from the ranks of the Shu forces to become one of the ""Five Tiger Generals"". Zhilong becomes famous for his many campaigns against Cao and the last surviving general of the ""Five Tigers"". Now, after many years of war, Zhilong is set to make his last stand against Cho's granddaughter--who has become a beautiful, cold and stoic warrior woman; Cao Ling (Maggie Q, Live Free and Die Hard).

The film is narrated by Pingan (Sammo Hung), Zhilong's oldest friend who joined the Liu army with him many years ago. The film is supposed to cover thirty years, Zhilong was a simple soldier who ascends to become a simple general and so the film feels a little too short. There are a lot of plot holes and several important parts missing, but then as a tale being narrated by Pingan who remained a simple soldier in the ranks, I can accept its shortcomings. Pingan never became a part of Zhilong's military unit until his final campaign. The viewer is privy to Zhilong's achievements through the musings of humble Pingan and it is rather hard for Sammo Hung to carry this burden, and purists will undoubtedly become disconnected. Zhilong is a renowned general in the Shu kingdom, he may be remembered as the ""Spartan"" of the Liu army--truly legendary and whose name struck fear in the hearts of his enemies.

Thankfully, Andy Lau does turn in a great performance and I am happy to say he isn't miscast. This may well be his best performance since his role in ""The Warlords"" with Jet Li. The plot may be a little too simple and doesn't reach Zhilong's epic grandeur, but Lau does the best of what he's got; Lau is playing a larger-than-life character and despite the simple plot, he manages to project the character competently. Maggie Q. is alluring as Cao Ling, and despite her limited screen time, she was exciting and enchanting to watch. The rest of the supporting cast isn't so bad, but we all have to remember that this is a film with Zhilong as its central focus.

Aside from the Pingan narrations, the real problems begin when the film has some ""add-on"" characters played by two lesser known performers in the persona of Vanness Wu, and Andy On; they seem to be mere attempts to give the young stars some exposure. (Maggie Q. is just so hot, I don`t mind her at all)  A lot of folks would be interested to see this film because of  truly iconic characters played by accomplished actors such as Sammo Hung, Yueh Hua, Ti Lung, Chen Zhihui; but sadly the film does nothing with them. Zhilong may be the center of the film but all others, disappear after the first half. This film definitely needed to be longer and the significance of the other four ""Tiger Generals"" to Zhilong a little more fleshed out.

The action sequences have the usual style of Chinese epics and reminiscent of other films of this kind. The choreography by Yuen Tak is fairly good, although it looked too flashy for my tastes. (as with Woo's ""Red Cliff') The shots are cool and well-choreographed, a blend of the usual wire-fu, wild slow-mo and blood and some gore. Highlights include Zhilong rescuing Liu's son, (which was fairly exciting) and the fight between Cao Ling and Zhilong were very cool to watch. The fights provide great eye candy, but that's all they were; pure eye candy. The film does have a lot of action, it feels more like an action drama and abandons the contemplative nature of the horrors of war.(although it does touch on this idea a little in the final act) Writer/director Daniel Lee does an average job in mixing in emotions and action, but it felt that it reduced its visceral effect. The film has colorful, elaborate costumes and some beautiful cinematography that it will no doubt attract mainstream audiences.

""Three Kingdoms: Resurrection of the Dragon"" isn't a bad film, and I rather thought that this may be Daniel Lee's best work. It is a lot better than the abysmal ""Empress and the Warriors"" and I've seen John Woo's ""Red Cliff"" and believe me, Woo's first take on the ""Three Kingdoms"" period was better but only by a tad. The lore and legend of the Three Kingdoms isn't fully fleshed out, and the film does resort to flashy camera tricks and choreographed action sequences. While this may not be exactly be a bad thing, and will no doubt give the non-meticulous viewer a good diversion, purists of its historical significance will be very disappointed since it isn`t as intricately compelling as I wished it to be. The film never does delve into wartime strategy that much and falls to the usual epic trappings of honor, betrayal and fate. This film has massive commercial appeal but quite respectable in its quality. ""Three Kingdoms"" is indeed an entertaining experience, but not outstanding and manages to exude coolness throughout--but isn't war supposed to be ""un-cool""?

Another one for the overindulgent International audience for beautiful Chinese epics.

While there are some truly stunning one on one fight scenes(with no wire flying or OTT antics, at that), this is a big scale historical epic set before the unification of China under the first emperor.  There are political machinations, brutal battles, and lifelong vendettas played out around the personal story of two men from one small town.  The visuals are stunning, and the Blu-ray enhances them superbly; it has wonderful music; and the cast are flawless.  Andy Lau and Sammo Hung show just how well they can act in this film, and it really is eye-opening.  A magnificent, moving feast that will leave you breathless.",1229731200,,744,4.912

Mainly I think this is because the film is too short, it almost needs to be a trilogy!  There is not enough time in the film to get to know all the different characters and feel for them through their struggles.  Even the relationships between the characters during the film are so short it makes their own emotions seem fake.  I really thought it had potential and I got right into it at the start...but once he becomes 'old' it rushes through too much to feel as though you can get indepth in the film on all levels...I felt it just scratches the surface of what seems a wonderful story.

8273133,5,B0019ADXJ0,"This is easily the most epic, sweeping TV series I've seen.  It's based on a Chinese classic, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which occupies a literary and cultural place in China similar to the Bible in Western Europe in terms of general familiarity with the major stories and sequences contained therein (the 'Zhao Yun Saves The Young Lord' sequence is likely on par with David & Goliath in terms of Chinese familiarity with that sequence and its themes).  The primary characters (and there are literally hundreds of named characters in this story who get screen time) are treated as saints or demons in much of Chinese culture, and seeing this series' take on some of them is refreshing and thought-provoking.

And the traditional 'heroes' of the story (Shu-Han's primaries) are everything one could hope for.  Guan Yu, portrated by Rong Guang, is smaller physically than he's described in the novel or portrayed in the video game series' which use Romance of the Three Kingdoms as source material, but he emotes well and the fight scenes featuring him do a more than convincing job of painting him as the God of War that he's revered to be.  Liu Bei, played by Yu He Wei, is much more conflicted and complex in this series than in other versions of the story, which I think plays extremely well to people already familiar with the story.  Lu Yi shines as Zhuge Liang, stealing every scene he's in just as one would hope.

The Wu officers are also well-presented, with more complexity displayed within Sun Quan's court than in other versions of the story with which I'm familiar.  Lu Su, in particular, shines as a calm, calculating and diplomatic character who serves as a jack-of-all-trades for the Southland.  Zhou Yu is temperamental and well-played as well, and Zhang Bo's Sun Quan also comes across as growing into the role of Wu's primary throughout the series' run.

But the star of the show here is easily Chen Jian Bin's Cao Cao.  Not only is the superb acting of this iconic character memorable, but the re-writing of Cao Cao's story (at least as it's presented from his perspective) was badly needed to add complexity and depth to what is usually nothing more than a one-dimensional villain.  Not only is he a brilliant tactician and politician, but here he's seen in multiple guffaw-inducing (if dark) moments, such as early in the series when he and Chen Gong mistake pig-roasters for assassins.  Another iconic scene is his negotiation scene with Yuan Shao at Guan Du, which he punctuates with a mic drop so epic and so unexpected in its tone and flavor that you'll laugh every time you see it (or even think about it!).

Word of warning: most of the versions of this series I've seen for sale on internet retailers have EXTREMELY poor subtitling.  So unless you're fluent in Chinese, be sure to check the subtitle quality on the specific copy you pick up.  I don't know of any .srt (subtitle files) for this series, though there is a supremely well-subtitled version available elsewhere on streaming sites like YouTube.  But if you can find a copy with quality subtitles, this will be one of the best purchases you'll make this year.  At 95 episodes, each weighing in at 40+ minutes of unique content (the title sequence is 2:30, but worth watching nearly every time), there's enough here to fill up your couch time for the near future.",1492646400,,3354,4.753448275862069
