2415235,5,B000BF0DII,I had seen the '89 production on TV when it first aired 20 years ago. The execution and acting is superb. One of the productions alone would have been worth the price.  It's a bonus to have two productions in the box.,1283040000,4,217,4.166666666666667
2415236,5,B000BF0DII,"Two discs, each with a version of Thornton Wilder's play ""Our Town"" (originally produced on stage in 1938).  There are no extras on the discs, just chapter menu.  The packaging tells the story of Wilder's attempt before his death in 1975 to leave behind a definitive version after the film version of 1940 made Emily Webb wake up from a bad dream during childbirth...defeating the purpose of the entire script and giving the ultimate hollywood happy ending.

I saw the televison broadcast of 1977 and always remembered it, in my High School theater passion, as the best television production of any play I'd ever seen.  I was familar with the play from English Class but had never seen it brought to life.  I had the unfortunate task of returning to theater class to say I thought Robbie Benson was terrific after all.  I was always worried throughout the years that it wouldn't hold up if the miracle ever occured that I should be able to see it again.

Well, my friends, it holds up in a grand way!  It still makes me whispy and joyful and speaks from the heart while it shoots from the hip.  This production walks the line between sentimentality and pure golden innocence with the finest of lines.  Thornton's text is delivered with quiet passion and gentle importance.  Hal Holbrook as the stage manager is inspired.  Glynnis O'Connor captures Emily with the sweetest glee and Robby Benson nails it...  the production is right on the money and the team of George Schaefer as director and Saul Jaffe as producer really created an exceptional reality.

The 1988-89 production, directed by Gregory Mosher at the Lincoln Center, goes nowhere near the sentimental line.  In fact, much of the warmth is purposefully pulled out creating a dry and quick paced excercise.  Don't get me wrong...it's a terrific experience, as it seems to replace the heart of script with the brains of the piece.  Mosher has these folks busting though their lines so fast that this production is 15 minutes shorter than the 1977 companion.  There is no bigger fan of Spalding Gray than myself.  His signature delivery embraces the New English regional syntax while it pulls away from swimming in the blood of the piece.  He's taking the pulse of the script, not riding the wave of emotion.  Eric Stoltz gives a ""city boy's"" view of the role.  Penelope Ann Miller has some powerful moments...despite a bit of shouting.  Frances Conroy is ethereal.

Each of these productions bring out different attributes of the amazing script.  They show how deep and rich the script is and why it's the most produced play in America.

If you enjoy this play, you might want to check out the work of Horton Foote (some of which is available on DVD;  ""Courtship"", ""On ""Valentine's Day"" and ""1918""

2415237,5,B000BF0DII,"The text of  this great play, opens no curtain, no scenery.  Despite these revolutionary concepts, after writing Our Town, Thornton Wilder for the stage, he hoped there would eventually be a ""definitive performance"" for tv viewers to enjoy.  In other words, he hated the 1940 box office movie with William Holden.  In 1977 he worked along with a team of actors including Hal Holbrook, Ned Beatty, Ronny Cox, Sada Thompson, Barbara Bel Geddes, and (fresh from Ode To Billy Joe) Robby Benson and Glynnis O'Connor. Although shot in a tv studio, they bent the rules slightly and added a touch of scenery, but it was so slight that it became the Grover's Corners New Hampshire that Wilder imagined.  The performance was so good it was nominated for (and just might have won) an Emmy.  Wilder died soon after happily, his definitive version made.  His estate willed that another version for tv should not be made.  Then in 1989, the late lamented Spaulding Grey headed another cast that did their best to remain completely faithful to the play as written.  This Broadway performance was nominated for a Tony.  A special performance was made for the executors of Wilder's estate who enjoyed it as much as the fore mentioned 1977 performance, that they allowed PBS to tape it for their ""Great Performances"" series.  Since then, both of these showings have been hard to find on video.  Now you can get them both in this nice (though pricey) 2 disc set. But trust me, it's worth the bucks.  If you really need to ""save money"", order it from a ""Marketplace Client"", but buy it anyway.  You will not regret it.  Then for another very good showing, buy the 2003 PBS/Showtime presentation (on the PBS label) with Paul Newman, etc.",1156118400,96,1716,4.75
2415303,5,B000BF0DII,"Both version are great.  If you are a fan of ""Our Town' purchase this and avoid the horrible William Holden film with the rewritten Hollywood ending.  Even Wilder though the original film was a piece of crap.  On there two version in this collection I prefer the Spalding Gray.  The Holbrook version, although it features excellent performances from an all-star cast, suffers from over-production, especially with an overwhelming amount of scenery, sound effects, and 70's style visual effects.  It was meant to be the definitive version of the play.  The Gray version was originally produced for the stage, which translates incredibly well to screen.  It is less ""folksy"" and focuses more on the universal themes of the play.",1429920000,,726,5.101694915254237
2415304,5,B000BF0DII,The Hall Holbrook version is wonderful with a believeable cast. The Spaulding Gray version is horrible. I can never sit through it. The cast seems to be angry with each other. I wish they would have sold them seperately.,1427068800,,220,4.666666666666667

2415308,5,B000BF0DII,"""Our Town"" is my favorite literary work of all time, and I see it every opportunity I get.  I have seen a number of versions, but on this disc I have only seen the Spalding Gray version.

This is the best version of the play I have ever seen. It so well captures the aura of rural early 20th century America.  And it so well recreates the simple but almost eerie message of the play.

I originally saw this version the last act only, back in the early 90s one night when I came home late at night and tuned in public TV just to wind down from the evening.  I noticed in the ending credits that the production was by Brandman Productions.  I checked the phone book and found that Brandman's office was 20 miles from my home, so I called and asked if I could rent a copy of the videotape.  They told me that they did not rent videos, but they would lend me a copy.  Some people actually trust!  I guess he figured that anyone wanting to see ""Our Town"" would be a decent kind of person.  When I got there, he didn't bother to take my ID, just gave me the video.

So I borrowed the tape and made my own copy from it.  And then of course, returned the original to Brandman.

When I have the pesos, I will order this set and have the opportunity to see the other version as well.",1378771200,,1273,4.06425702811245
2415309,5,B000BF0DII,"If you are a fan of this play, like I am, then you will enjoy this comparison of this great play",1362268800,,96,3.619047619047619
2415310,5,B000BF0DII,"I agreed with the person who liked the Hal Holbrook version as the better of the two productions of Our Town.  I saw both of these on TV as this other person did, as well as the movie version, with William Holden.  I disliked the movie version, as did, the playwright himself, Thorton Wilder.  If you haven't seen any of the productions or read the play, please don't finish reading my review.
I too, read the play, in high school, in the late seventies, and then saw the Robby Benson version.  I was very impressed, and the play, still makes me tear up at the end, when (spoiler alert) Emily dies.  In the movie version she doesn't die, and it was a dream.  According to Amazon, Thornton Wilder did not like the movie version, because it lessens the whole message of the play, which is, that not many people realize how precious and wonderful life is.  We should enjoy it while we can, and not take life for granted. I thought that the Hal Holbrook, Robby Benson, version, is better realized, and gets across the message, better than the one with Eric Stolz.  The one with Eric Stolz, while not bad, just doesn't get to me as much as the earlier version.  I've also seen the Paul Newman version, but even though I realize what a great actor he was, it still didn't move me as much.  As someone, maybe even the reviewer I was alluding to said, Paul Newman seemed to be asleep.  I know that I am actually reviewing 3 versions of Our Town, but I think that you will agree with me and critics and some of the other reviews on here.  If you really feel the message of the movie, you will most likely cry, but also attempt to savor your life more, and try to enjoy every minute of it. We only have one life to live and we need to not take our life for granted.",1357948800,6,1755,4.253012048192771
2415311,5,B000BF0DII,really - this is one of the most profound of literary works and it is well portrayed here - excellent compatibility with Wilder's intent and well directed.,1355961600,,155,4.777777777777778
2415312,5,B000BF0DII,"Both versions of Thornton Wilder's ""Our Town""  - the 1977 NBC production starring Hal Holbrook and the 1988 Lincoln Center production starring Spalding Gray - do this greatest American play justice.  In both, the staging is comparably sparse, relying instead on mime to add depth to the dialogue; and, in both, the atmosphere generated by the lack of props and buildings is somber, even a little forboding.  Similarly, the inclusion of a Stage Manager (Holbrook and Gray), serves as much to infuse this sense of forboding as it does to keep the play from devolving into a vehicle for extolling convential values; or, conversely, to keep the essential absurdity of the social and moral trappings humans devise to give their lives meaning from rendering those trappings meaningless (this is definitely not Theatre of the Absurd).  The Stage Manager also keeps the audience from becoming overly involved in the characters' lives; in this way, the third act, with its emphasis on death, focuses the audience's attention on the play's deeper meaning rather than simply milking its emotions.  In the final analysis, though, both versions being equally faithful to Wilder's larger purpose, all one can do is compare and contrast the actors in each.

In my opinion, the actors in the Lincoln Center production were better suited to their roles than those in the NBC production - the major exception being Hal Holbrook, who seemed slightly better suited to portray the Stage Manager than Spalding Gray.  Both Penelope Ann Miller and Eric Stoltz, in the Lincoln Center production, seemed to bring a greater reality to Emily Webb and George Gibbs respectively - the two main characters - than did Glynnis O'Connor and Robby Benson in the NBC production.  Miller was a more ambivalent Emily than O'Connor, more unsure of her physical self yet at the same time more confident of her intelligence; and in the crucial final scene, where Emily returns to the place of the living, there was more despair at being unable to become a part of her former life in Miller's Emily but, even so, greater reluctance to resume her place among the dead.  Stoltz's George seemed shallower and less insightful than Benson's George; but this made for a George Gibbs better suited to the overall tenor of the play, as well as more realistically drawn; Stoltz's George could never have grasped what the playwright's larger purpose was - and shouldn't have been able to; whereas Benson's George evinced a greater capacity for growth than the character was actually endowed with.  I also found James Rebhorn and Frances Conroy better matches for Dr. and Mrs. Gibbs than Ned Beatty and Sada Thompson; and Peter Maloney and Roberta Maxwell better matches for Mr. and Mrs. Webb than Ronny Cox and Barbara Bel Geddes. And, though a minor character, the church organist and town drunk, Simon Stimson, was better portrayed by Jeff Weiss than David Cryer.

Regardless how superb the two productions were, or which may have been the better production, it's truer about ""Our Town"" than almost any other play ever written that it must be seen on stage, in person, to experience its full effect.  I had the good fortune to see ""Our Town"" produced in a local community theater; and though its staging, direction and acting couldn't equal either of these professional versions, it surpassed both because of the immediacy of seeing it first hand.  Since the play itself, with its Stage Manager, sparse set and mimed actions, keeps the audience at bay, seeing it on film puts an even greater distance.  It has to be seen right in front of you to be truly appreciated.",1298419200,2,3617,4.927631578947368

Hal Holbrook as the narrator, Barbara Bel Geddes, Charlotte Rae, Sada Thompson and of course the two stars of this Thornton Wilder Play; Glynnis O' Connor and Robby Benson. Theatrical to the core.

8085882,5,B000BF0DII,"My favorite play-- and this two-DVD set provides two excellent versions.  The 1977 version with Hal Holbrook has some well-known characters, excellent acting, and his narration is what you'd expect from Mr. Holbrook.  Robby Benson plays one of the leads, but the supporting cast is just as good as the better-known actors.

The later version is just as good-- better in some areas, not as good in others.  I particularly like the casting of the chorale director in this version, who brings more depth to the role.

This is a pricey set, and while I wish they'd separated these into two versions, it's still an excellent addition to anyone's library.",1490659200,,649,4.863636363636363

Everytime I hear Emily ask,""Do any human beings realize life while they live it, every, every minute?"", I understand why the Stage Manager says, ""No. The saints and poets maybe, they do some.""
And the real kicker is when she asks Mother Gibbs, ""They don't understand, do they?"" And Gibbs (the excellent Frances Conroy) replies, ""No dear, they don't understand.""
