4375090,2,B004H2V6BE,"Lead Belly, 1976 film

This is the story about Huddie Ledbetter the famous folk singer & songwriter who lived in the early 20th century. Huddie assaulted a man in town, hitting him with his pistol. The Sheriff asks Mr. Ledbetter to bring his son in for punishment. Mr. Ledbetter tells his son that some men were talking about coming there for a shotgun wedding (Huddie got to know a local girl). Huddie visits a parlor house but doesnt have the $5. Miss Julie teaches him a lot, for a price. We see scenes that are not shown on broadcast TV shows (unless censored). Miss Julie thinks she owns Huddie. Is he born for trouble? There is a competition in guitar playing. Six string guitar against a twelve string guitar. The Sheriffs men raids that house. Huddie jumps a freight train to get away.

He finds a job picking cotton in Texas, and a place to stay. On a train he meets Blind Lemon, another singer. Can a blind man drive a car? Or a man who never drove before? [Note the rural dirt roads.] They show convicts working on a railroad track, then unpainted wooden shacks. This pair is hired to play at a dance. Will Huddie work without pay? There is a fight, then jail. Huddie will go on the chain gang. Can he crash out? Huddie returns to a home. Will that 12-string guitar identify him? He needs the money. One night he gets in a fight and shoots a man. Thirty years. Prisoners are whipped if their work or attitude is unsatisfactory. Walter escapes! Bloodhounds are used to track him in the swamp. Shots are fired. Can he find shelter? An old lady knocks off his chains. Can he hide from his pursuers? No. A shot brings him out of a tree. He is punished by being locked in a hot box. Huddie is still rebellious.

An old man with a cough visits the prison to get Walter out. He cant buy him out in Texas. But he can buy a guitar for Walter. Later Walter sings for white folk. They are amused by the words. But no pardon today. Can he trust the word of a politician? Yes, he is pardoned to return home. But things have changed, the Great Depression has left businesses closed. He meets a young girl who knows about him. There are new tenants in his old home, he is ordered away. There is a fight, a knife is used. Later a journalist visits him in prison to record his songs and life. Professor Lomax will take them to the Library of Congress. Then Walter returns to breaking rocks. After his release he toured America to sing his songs.

This movie fails to tell the significance of Ledbetter, who died of a disease that may explain his fiery temper and anger. Is there a book on Lead Bellys life? Folk songs are regarded as somehow more authentic than the commercial products from Tin Pan Alley. Many folk songs were modified or revised over the years (no copyright protection). How many folk songs are on the radio today? No market for them? This is an interesting story even if a low budget movie. Back in the 1950s they used to show I Am a Fugitive from a Georgia Chain Gang on TV (it was based on a true story). Now it seems to be censored and unavailable.",1393286400,,3064,4.332752613240418

4375092,5,B004H2V6BE,"Excellent!  Film is raw in cinematography and in illustrating the challenge of the black race especially for the black man.  Despite the challenge, he rose above it.",1374883200,,165,5.074074074074074
4375093,5,B004H2V6BE,"Although this film captures only a part of Leadbelly's life, it does so very well and seems to capture the essence of the legendary Huddie Ledbetter and some of the experiences which made him who he became. Great job.",1374537600,,217,4.589743589743589
4375094,5,B004H2V6BE,I think this is a very good and realistic movie. I taped it several years ago but my copy looked faded and I wanted to keep a copy in my libary so I ordered a dvd from Amazon. However the dvd from Amazon looks to be the same quality as my tape almost as if the dvd had been made from my tape.,1362182400,3,292,3.6507936507936507
4375095,3,B004H2V6BE,I have always enjoyed the music of Leadbelly and ever since I saw this movie I've been searching for it on DVD. The production value on the DVD is lacking which may be due to the master being in a poor condition. It's a shame that this movie has not been given a good remastering. I don't regret my purchase,1359417600,7,307,4.133333333333334

4375097,1,B004H2V6BE,"Bought this ""DVD"" and it is obviously just a copy of a VHS version burned to a DVD!! Lots of places where you can see the VHS copy wasn't even a good one that was dubbed to DVD, it was also supposed to have the Trailer as well, but when you play it you get to see a trailer for some Chinese movie and the trailer is in Chinese and not English!!",1329955200,6,344,3.7916666666666665

8429308,5,B004H2V6BE,"If you love the story/struggle of early 20th Century Black musicians, this is a must-see. Leadbelly's contribution to American music is unmistakeable, and this film helps paint the picture of the man and the American atmosphere responsible for it. The really important dynamics of race and money in America really comes to life in this movie and Leadbelly's adventurous life is played out behind a wonderful soundtrack of music that really comes alive in this context.
If you are a Black movie collector, you need this in your collection. If you liked ""Ray,"" the movie about the life of Ray Charles, you really need to see this movie.",1396828800,,634,4.87962962962963

8429310,5,B004H2V6BE,"Leadbelly tells the true story of the Texas itinerant bluesman Leadbelly to a perfect T. A welcome addition to the list of characters is the justly famous musician Blind Lemmon Jefferson.

Overall, this is a moving story about and a virtual vintage time capsule of the life of poor black and white folks in Texas in the 1920's and 1930's. A tale told about white and black Americans, about music and struggle, told honestly with any stereotypes or hidden agendas.

If you like authentic down home blues, and you are a member of the human race, this is a MUST SEE movie. Roger Mosely is magnificent, and the story which is told is completely authentic and true.",1394582400,2,660,4.632478632478633
