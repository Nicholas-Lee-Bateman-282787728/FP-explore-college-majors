2430734,5,B000BNZP1K,We used the video in our women's bible study.  It was very informative.  The discussion after viewing it was lively and open.,1142294400,2,125,4.636363636363637
2430765,5,B000BNZP1K,Having watched several different films on this topic; I recommend this one because it is so comprehensive and yet it is engaging so it isn't a 'snooze-fest' like some educational/documentaries can be when they are simply imparting information.,1379116800,2,243,5.421052631578948
2430766,5,B000BNZP1K,"I saw this documentary on PBS, last year - and was really taken by how we are more similar than we are unalike.  This is something I have 'known' for almost all my life - but it was great to see the comparative passages in all three books that support this.  I also appreciated that the top scholars in all THREE faiths are working on ways and means to open the lines of communication and dialogue - so that the terrorism that has been demonstrated by proponents of all THREE faiths - will hopefully become a thing of the past.

I was sorry to see the schism between Judaism and Christianity on the one side - and Islam on the the other . . .  not because there are any real differences, but simply by reason of a theological technicality.  Now, more than ever, there should be a unification of the three - and this schism should be eradicated.  However - we can't even know that such things exist if they're not brought into the light of day.  So - as sad as I am that Islam is still considered 'separate' - I'm glad that the ""reason"" has been laid bare, and can be seen for the superficiality that it is.

I have a cousin who is an ordained Anglican priest - and she, herself, faces temporal difficulties within her own religion - simply because she is a woman.  We have had some interesting discussions about her situation - and about things like ""pagan"" holidays, such as Christmas, etc.  I have recommended this DVD to her - and will be sending it to her as a gift.",1378080000,3,1470,4.274368231046932
2430767,4,B000BNZP1K,This study of three of the world's major faiths provides a map for anyone on the personal journey to gain an understanding of God.  It is also a fine resource for initiating group discussions of this interesting subject.,1372204800,,220,4.7894736842105265
2430768,5,B000BNZP1K,I saw this on PBS & plan to watch it again. It gives us an inside look to how other religions view our own.,1360800000,,107,3.5
2430769,2,B000BNZP1K,"In the title the author discloses that he knows nothing of Christianity. Our God is a triune God; Jehovah,Jesus,and the Holy Spirit, who is in believers hearts, we are His temple, we are His body on earth. Jesus lives in the heavenly abode right now in a glorified HUMAN body,He arose from the grave with it and ascended to Heaven with it. Do Jewish people have a God who would die on a cross for them so they could go to live in heaven on earth with Him? Actually they do, because Jesus is their Messiah, but they refuse to accepe Him as such. God's heart cries for His wife,Israel to come home to their Messiah. Has Allah given the Muslim a Holy Spirit to help them live their lives?The back to the roots movement of socalled Christians is an insult to Jesus,they crucify Him over again. There is no similarity anymore with the Judaism of Jesus day and today. 1) the sacrifices are over,God split the temple veil. 2) the feasts  are over because three of them you have to make a pilgramage to Jerusalem,and with all, they required blood sacrifice. There is no longer a sacrifice for the Jewish people, they rejected their Messiah. And the muslims are from the godless side of Abraham, not the child of promise, but Ishmael son of Abraham's sin..trying to take control of his situation instead of waiting for the Promise. No other religion in the world has the assurance that we will live eternal but the Christians, because of what OUR GOD did on Calvary!",1345852800,3,1457,4.518939393939394
2430770,4,B000BNZP1K,"Our 3-faith group (Jewish, Christian, and Muslim) used this dvd as the starting point for one of our interfaith discussions.  Our planning committee found plenty of food for thought in the commentaries in the movie.  Since it was way to long to watch in its entirety and still have time to discuss it, we watched just the first four chapters and used it as a starting point for discussing similarities and differences, differences in narratives in the Adam and Eve and ""sacrifice of the son"" stories and whether competition for ""favorite son"" status has been the cause of many of our problems with each other.  At future discussions we will use the same dvd to stimulate discussions about what creates and perpetuates extremism and how we can try to un-perpetuate it.  The dvd features all open-minded and peace-seeking commentators, but it doesn't shy away from showing the problems we've managed to create in the world.  So it has been a very good, thought-provoking resource for our 3-faith groups.",1333238400,3,1001,4.934523809523809
2430771,5,B000BNZP1K,This is an excellent DVD which shows the similarities and differences in the three Abrahamic faiths. It does a good job dealing with the misconceiptions about Islam and the history of each faith throught the voices of leaders of each faith. I plan to show it at our Gathering of Presbyterian Women.,1296604800,3,298,4.75
2430772,5,B000BNZP1K,"The people in the documentary have studied  the holy scriptures with an open mind have commentated. They are all professors from well renowned universities.
I hope and wish all Americans watch this documentary which was shown on PBS channels",1294444800,3,241,5.17948717948718
2430773,5,B000BNZP1K,"A lot has been said, but I will just add that this documentary has the power and the information to move one to become a force for peace, love and understanding. This is what hate and fear mongers don't want you to see. It is a documentary not just to be bought, but to be widely shared.",1286841600,,287,4.052631578947368
2430774,5,B000BNZP1K,It has opened my eyes to the three different religions. This DVD is very special to me. You have to get this DVD and add it to your collection!,1257724800,2,143,3.9655172413793105
2430781,3,B000BNZP1K,"Contains much useful data at a beginner's level for all three faiths: Jewish, Christian, and Muslim, but does not discuss ostacles to mutual respect and cooperation, such as how each faith criticizes the other two.
  Good to provoke thought and/or as a basis for group discussion about htow the US can productively and responsibly adapt to being the more pluralistic society we are inevitably becoming.",1239667200,2,402,5.1692307692307695
2430782,2,B000BNZP1K,I received the item and it appeared to be in excellent condition but I bypassed the free delivery and paid so that it would arrive on time for a friend to take before leaving the country.  It arrived 2 days later than it should have which cost me the postage of mailing it overseas.  I was not happy about that at all.  Next time I will just use your free shipping option when I qualify.,1233187200,2,387,4.133333333333334
2430783,4,B000BNZP1K,"After reading the reviews and then watching it, I had to add this to augment a few of the other reviews. I wouldn't call the documentary over-simplified since there is a range offered from ordinary people to theologians, all for a good reason-- to make this attractive for others to join in. It is a more of a conversation than a presentation and it does that well-- we talked about it afterwards. There are already many books and dvd's that offer an indepth analysis or comparison of the three faiths. I like Karen Armstrong's work and was pleasantly surprised to see her included.

I wouldn't call it requiring more candor for it not to be considered a superficial sham since there is plenty of candor-- real people expressing real thoughts and feelings. What bias or inaccuracies might be percieved were either unintended, minor or missed the point of what it was designed for--- an inviting opener to a dialogue about common ground. It is a beginning, one that emphasizes it's continuation rather than it's perfection.

And lastly, I would not be inclined to claim that tolerance and understanding of other faiths is cliched after watching people of three faiths authentically cracking the door on intolerance and misunderstanding through effective workshop techniques. Some of the expressions the people wore told a story in themsleves.

But if one is concerned about how religious intolerance interferes with today's world, if one is curious about what a doorway to a workable intersection between Christianity, Islam and Judaism might resemble, then this documentary will prove worth a look. That may be what it was designed for and if so, it succeeds as designed. Like one reviewer, I would like to see part two, especially if it included follow up to see what lasting effects these encounters with other faiths produced in the people who participated.",1190592000,15,1860,4.993548387096774
2430784,5,B000BNZP1K,"THIS DVD SHOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE IN ALL SCHOOLS SO THAT CHILDREN CAN LEARN AND UNDERSTAND THAT THESE THREE GREAT FAITHS ARE VERY SIMILAR AND RESPECT EACH OTHER'S TEACHINGS.ALL THE MISGIVINGS ABOUT THE FAITHS WOULD THEN BE SHED AND PROMOTE GREATER TOLERANCE AND UNDERSTANDING,PARTICULARLY IN THESE DIFFICULT TIMES.",1178928000,12,314,5.5625
2430785,4,B000BNZP1K,"I enjoyed this very much, and recommend that everyone see it. There were some important issues which received little mention if at all. This film tries to persue the laudable goal of how different faiths should approach one another in peace, however in order to do so, some key tenants of faith were abandoned. One of the theologins rightly mentioned that the key issue was ""who is Jesus?"" For the Jews and the Muslims to admit that Jesus was only a prophet is no stretch at all, but for the Christian, it is an abandonment of their faith. It is interesting that the only ones it seems who have to give up anything were the Christians. I wonder how the other faiths would have reacted if they would have been required to renounce one of the key tennants of their faith in the same way??? It was also interesting to see an Imam lead a group of children in an apparently christian church, through the conversion ritual to Islam, where all that is required to be a convert is to say ""There is no god (Allah) but god (Allah) and Mohammed is his prophet."" I wonder how it would have gone over, if a christian minister had gone into a Jewish or Muslim community, and asked them if they wanted to be baptised? The God of Abraham Issac and Jacob invites us to ""come let us reason together..."" and to the extent this film promotes that I applaud it, however a bit more candor in certain areas will be necessary in order for this dialogue to be more than a superficial sham...",1167609600,16,1466,4.393382352941177

2430787,5,B000BNZP1K,"This is by far the best documentary I have ever seen on coexistence and conflict in general.  Authoritative speakers serve as both examples to follow and informative, rigorous, well-reasoned thinkers on the subject at hand.  No ignorant, hateful extremist nut-jobs (from the left or the right or wherever) were allowed any air of authority in this film.

Overall, the film itself is a case-study in effective, polemical documentary film-making without ever risking the slippery slide down into propaganda (that is to say, a devious attempt to ""sneak"" important things past the viewers without us noticing).

It can get emotional at times without ever feeling forced or contrived--it's just the well-reasoned and yet emotional forcefulness of the subject and often the delivery, and it's implications for global peace.

The film, however, is long (2 hrs) and probably will try most everyone's attention span.  I recommend watching a bit, taking a break for however long, and coming back to finish it up.  There aren't really any ""throwaway"" parts or bits to skip over--it's all good!

Relevant for studies in comparative and developmental religion, diversity, conflict and peace studies, etc.",1166918400,2,1191,5.331550802139038
2430788,5,B000BNZP1K,"This is a good documentary pointing out all the overlooked similarities between the three religions.  Some of the earlier posts who disagree with the title or other parts of the film is there own personal take on it.  It has a heart-breaking moment in the middle with a speaker talking about a Muslim doing a killing.  You'll have to watch the rest to see how that statement is unfolded.  It is nice that it does not only talk to scholars, but students as well in high school and below.

The study guide is pretty good.  Maybe a sequel to flesh out the differences between them more.  It's good to know we have brothers and sisters throughout the world.  shalom.  salaam.  peace.",1162684800,11,679,4.537190082644628
2430789,4,B000BNZP1K,"I'll admit that perhaps the discussion of the three faiths is a bit oversimplified. Nevertheless it is just ignorant to boast that the God of Abraham, Isaac, Jesus, and Moses is not the God of the Muslims. In fact, the term Judeo-Christian is recently being reassessed as inapplicable and Judea-Christian-Islamic used in its stead. This is similar to the academic movement to use terms such as Before the Common Era (BCE) and Common Era (CE) as opposed to the overtly Christian CE/AD in terms of historical dates.

Our society needs to aknowledge that these forms of religious discrimination are closed-minded and historically innacurate. Adam, Noah, and Jesus and Mary are all figures within the Islamic historical tradition and this documentary illuminates such instances of likeness between the three faiths. That does not make it a weak film. It only directs us to reasses our weak intellects.",1146614400,17,897,5.1438356164383565
2430790,5,B000BNZP1K,"This DVD identifies the essential elements that integrate, and not merely unites, the three religions.

8089737,4,B000BNZP1K,"With the state of the world today due to the terrorist activities that have been going on over that few years this may be a good time to watch this documentary. Especially with the feelings many people in the world have towards Islam due to the extremists within that religion that have committed brutal acts of violence. A perception among many today is that all Muslims are terrorists even though that thought is not true. Yes the terrorists who have been committing these senseless acts of violence are Muslim but not all Muslims are terrorists. Just as not all Christians and Jews are not terrorists. And while Islam seems strange and different in how they worship the fact is Muslims believe in the same God Jews Believe in and that Christians believe in.

And that is what ""Three Faiths, One God: Judaism, Christianity, Islam"" talks about. Through interviews with both lay people, religious scholars and religious leaders the documentary explores just how all three of these major religions are based on the same beliefs and principals. The difference lies in how they worship God but there is no doubt despite those differences it is the very same God they believe in. ""Three Faiths"" does I think a good job of showing how these three Religions are the same. My only complaint is that there are times the film seems to me to drag. About two hours in length it would have helped I thought if they spent a little time in explaining how each of the three religions started for the benefit of those who are not aware of how Christianity, Judaism and Islam came to be. It just deals with looking at how they are the same in believing in the same God. Still even though at times it may seem to drag a little there is still a lot of interesting issues brought up to show just how similar these three different religions are. This is worth watching to become a bit more informed about these religions and their beliefs. Especially in these times we are living now.",1451433600,,1963,4.6085714285714285
