3880927,5,B0029T84NU,"Episodic - not to mention epic - underground film from Jorg Buttgereit and friends. References exploitation and arthouse films (Ms. 45, Rear Window, A Zed and Two Noughts, the old favourite My Dinner With Andre) while being beautiful, unpredictable and disturbing in its own right. Black comic touches - some hilarious guffaws, some good gore - do not take away from an overall feeling of terrible sadness, maybe even to the point of insanity. The Death King - as a force or emotion or premonition in the lives of the film's very many characters - doesn't make you want to kill yourself; rather - as in the old Film Threat VHS subtitles - ""he is the one who makes you not want to live anymore."" There is a difference. And confronting such deadly impulses, Der Todes King has the potential power to heal. For me, this film is a work of art that has stayed with me for decades and only gets better with every viewing. I can see why some people have the little Death King stick figure tattooed on their bodies. It's a souvenir of surviving the underworld! Can't wait to experience all the Super 8 and 16mm film segments pixel-pumped by blu ray. The packaging mentions ""original motion picture soundtrack"" - this is not a separate CD but rather a 28 minute audio extra - good enough, and better than an ""isolated score"" track which some reviewers have reported it to be. The music is one of the best things about Der Todes King. The film's downbeat imagery is edited as much to the brilliant soundtrack as it is to the pass-the-baton-of-death narrative.",1432080000,17,1549,4.615942028985507
3880928,4,B0029T84NU,"This German cult film (translated as ""The King of Death"") from infamous director Jorg Buttgereit is a surreal and absurdist meditation on death. It's not really a horror movie, but that's the closest genre it fits in. In any case, it's not a fun time.

There is no real plot, no real characters. It's simply a series of seven short stories about people self-destructing. They kill other people or themselves. In between the stories are shots of a human body decomposing.

The movie manages, kind of accidentally, to both predict and explain the rise of school shootings and random acts of mass violence in America a decade later. If you understand this movie, you understand things like Columbine and Aurora and Newtown.

Now that I think about it, this isn't really even a movie. It's essentially a form of existential anguish that screams the ultimate question. Not the question ""Why do we die?"", but rather, ""Why are we even alive in the first place?""

This movie has never been officially released in any form in America. It has had a couple brief releases in Europe. For the small percentage of people that appreciate death cinema or similar experimental film, you can find it if you look in the right places. For everybody else, you can just move along. There's nothing to see here.",1387324800,3,1288,4.762331838565022
3880929,4,B0029T84NU,"If you are a fan of Jorg Buttgereit this movie is for you. It has parts in the movie which are graphic, especially the one where they cut his penis off with shears. The way he did the movie with the 7 suicides on 7 days of the week were great. I liked the third day of the week where a man at a bus stop sat on the seat and cried and told a complete stranger his sexual problems and the lady handed him a gun to kill himself. I love Jorg Buttgereit and I have all his movies. So if you haven't seen this film, it is definitely worth the watch as it is well done and I highly recommend it.",1266710400,3,588,3.7886178861788617

8358208,5,B0029T84NU,"I remember trading vhs tapes in the 90's for these old underground horror gems!  Jorg Buttgereit  shocked the horror genre in the late 80's with his dark, twisted, sick films.  You could never find any of his films at a Block Buster video store  If you wanted to view them,  grainy boot legs was the only way to go.

This film is very dark but interesting.  The transfer is HD and a pristine picture to view all the atrocities  The special features are worth the price alone. Beware, this stuff is for acquired tastes only.  This is not main stream horror!

It is amazing that in the 90's horror fans swapped these grainy old vhs tapes.  In 2016  you purchase it legally from Amazon and the mail man brings a pristine dvd to my mail box!!",1457049600,3,738,4.345588235294118

8358214,4,B0029T84NU,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

Last year, I had the pleasure of reviewing director Jorg Buttgereits film, NEKROMANTIK.  Although I loved it, I mentioned in that review the film would not be for everyone, and the subject matter is considered taboo by many.  Buttgereit followed-up his controversial hit with THE DEATH KING, a segmented movie about suicide and death, where each individual piece takes place on a different day of the week.  Each story is also prefaced by showing the rapid decomposition of a human body over a period of seven days.  While this film might not sound as shocking as its predecessor, it is another well made jaunt into the bizarre, and I am glad I got to check it out.

THE DEATH KING is shot well, in Buttgereits artistic yet straight-forward style, and the film looks good as a whole.  Im particularly impressed with the decomposing body scenes.  Im not sure how many days it took for the compositional breakdown to occur, but it looks mesmerizing nonetheless.

Surprisingly, there are not many special effects in this one.  I was expecting many, given the subject matter, however we only get a few.  Those we get to see are done well, however, and I have to give credit to the production team.  Of particular note is the graphic castration of a prisoner; this scene is horrifyingly realistic and made me cringe.

I have to confess a couple of the segments in THE DEATH KING didn't make sense to me.  The Thursday piece is just video shots of a bridge in Germany with names that flash across the screen.  I am assuming the names list those who jumped from the bridge, but that is never explained.  Likewise, the Sunday segment is just a man in his bed, crying and banging his head.  I understand the desolation and loneliness this is supposed to convey, but it didn't work for me.

But those two complaints aside, THE DEATH KING is a dark look into realism that fans of NEKROMANTIK will certainly want to undertake.  Be warned, however:  this is another film that won't be for everybody.  If you are easily offended, you might want to pass this one by.  But if you can stomach it, you're in for a surrealistic journey you won't soon forget.",1435795200,5,2212,4.603580562659847
