2862818,4,B000R9AKRM,"This DVD of Charles and Diana's wedding was okay; it did include some news footage from the day that I hadn't seen before.  I was looking for a comprehensive DVD of the wedding with every moment, which only seems to be available on ebay in its original form; I can't find a comprehensive copy that was produced later.  I guess not many people are interested in that kind of thing these days!
This DVD was basically highlights, which I knew before I bought it because I looked at the length.  This is an excellent, inexpensive look at the wedding for anyone who wants to see the main points.",1190764800,10,590,4.444444444444445
2862819,3,B000R9AKRM,"If you are looking for the highlights of the Royal wedding of HRH the Prince of Wales and Lady Diana Spencer, then this is it!  This shows highlights of the wedding, not the entire uncut wedding.  I enjoyed the commentary of Peter Jennings and Barbara Walters.  It is a time capsule as to 1981.",1185408000,15,294,4.407407407407407
2862820,5,B000R9AKRM,"This is a great way to look back at ""The Wedding Of The Century"". A must for any Diana fan...",1184716800,5,93,3.7
2862821,1,B000R9AKRM,"I expected to get the entire Wedding on DVD.it was 45 minutes long. The Commentators talked over almost the entire Wedding excerps and activities! Grainy quality. I gave this 1 star, only because there was nothing lower! Don't buy!!!!!",1307059200,2,235,5.051282051282051
2862822,2,B000R9AKRM,"Not very good quality.  Music does not really fit wedding...  Just a US compliation of the wedding..
Much less than what I remember and hoped for...  The only good copy would be done by the BBC.
I do not recommend this product.",1306800000,2,227,4.357142857142857
2862823,1,B000R9AKRM,"ABC did a LOUSY job editing.  90% of the wedding and the music was cut!  Peter Jennings made several errors........he said the ""Dean of Westminster""  officiated.  Hello, the wedding was at St. Paul's.  Do not waste your money on this.",1305072000,,234,4.75
2862824,3,B000R9AKRM,I WAS NOT SO HAPPY WITH THIS DVD. NOT ENOUGH FOOTAGE OF THE WEDDING AND THE BEAUTIFUL MUSIC. TOO MUCH OF BARBARA WALTERS.,1303776000,,121,4.304347826086956
2862825,2,B000R9AKRM,"I wanted the entire, uncut wedding, not a news broadcast. This is interesting for fans of Diana, but disappointing to those of us who remember that day and would like to remember it in its entirety.",1200614400,11,198,4.527777777777778
2862826,1,B000R9AKRM,"I was so excited to watch this when it arrived.  I loved the actual wedding back in 1981--great music, great scenes of London, a really beautiful event.  This dvd chops out so much of what I was looking forward to.  It just barely shows the highlights, has way too much commentary from Barbara Walters and left me feeling cheated and disappointed.  It's better than having no reminder at all of the royal wedding, but I'm now off to eBay to see if anyone has the original BBC video.  I'm not a complainer or hard to please, so sorry to be negative.",1194393600,48,548,4.3861386138613865
2862827,5,B000R9AKRM,I have searched many years for a copy of Diana and Charles wedding.  It was well worth my money.  If you are a fan of Diana's this is for you!,1193443200,2,142,3.7
2862828,5,B000R9AKRM,"This dvd was very infrmative, it brought me back to that time of hope and inocence the the young Diana on her wedding day.  ABC did this very tastefully and well documented. Its a best of...but I will always treasure it.  Highly recommended",1191888000,3,240,4.558139534883721
2862829,4,B000R9AKRM,"I stayed up all night when I was 13 to watch this wedding live on television.  Recently, I began a search for coverage of the wedding as the 10th anniversary of Diana's death approached.  This dvd was suggested to me and I was thrilled to find it.  It does have wonderful coverage of the event and covers all the high notes.  If what you are looking for is a reminder of the beauty and pagentry of this ""wedding of the century"", this dvd will be a wonderful addition to your collection. However, for a fan such as myself on whose teenage brain the wedding made such an impact, I found that some of the strategic cuts on the coverage eliminated things that I was looking forward to seeing again.",1191628800,29,694,4.3565891472868215

8199621,1,B000R9AKRM,For $20 I would have expected a much more polished DVD. This looks like a youngster filmed it. Disappointed.,1484870400,,108,4.7368421052631575

8199623,2,B000R9AKRM,"While it is nice to have this on dvd rather than tape, it is VERY chopped up. Buy the tape from the BBC instead. This version did not even show them walking back down the aisle or any of the ride back to the palace. NOT worth the money.",1406592000,,236,3.836734693877551
8199624,3,B000R9AKRM,"I don't know how this got included as a purchase.  I did not purchase this DVD but I did bring it up on Amazon to check it out. Some of these were only interests, not purchases.  Thanks.",1371168000,,186,4.0

8199626,5,B000R9AKRM,Love this Dvd.  The wedding was totally mesmerizing.  Just enough commentary  from Barbara Walters.  Oh that dress of Diana's.  Totally beautiful  This is a DVD to own and watch again and again!,1346889600,,194,4.90625

8199628,1,B000R9AKRM,"Words fail me.  This product is beyond disappointing.

The photography is grainy and very poorly done.
The DVD is choppy and shows too little of the
actual wedding and far too much of the commentary.

I would discourage anyone from wasting his or her money
on this product.",1308873600,4,273,4.645833333333333
8199629,5,B000R9AKRM,The wedding is great to have.  I remember watching it as a 16 yr. old and I was all taken up with it.  Thanks for letting me comment about it.  MIKE CONNOR.  Mtcon123@aol.com,1308441600,2,174,4.181818181818182
8199630,1,B000R9AKRM,This product was aweful. I was very disapointed.  I was looking for a DVD of the complete royal wedding and this not it.  If there is such a DVD of the full wedding I would very much interested in getting it.,1307145600,2,208,4.048780487804878
