999060,3,6305265100,"""The Silver Screen: Color Me Lavender"" uses a series of film clips to remind current audiences of Hollywood depicted male gay characters with significant roles in the 1930's through the 1950's.  There are breaks between the clips for a costumed narrator to give general exposition.  The actors shown include Edward Everett Horton, Bob Hope, Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Clifton Webb, Walter Brennan, Cary Grant, Randolph Scott, and Gene Kelly.  The movie does not get into Rock Hudson, Sal Mineo, Tony Curtis, or other, later actors.

The general thesis is that Hollywood treated gay characters as comic relief before World War II but then chose to present straight characters who got into awkward, possibly homoerotic, situations - like soldiers dressing up as women or dancing with each other in the absence of women.

""The Silver Screen"", as well as ""The Celluloid Closet"" and books like Jeffrey P. Dennis's ""Queering Teen Culture"" list or display situations that look gay to modern sensibilities and probably did back then too to those who were receptive.  What I find lacking so far is an analysis of how these elements came to be in the film.  Did the actor make a successful ad lib?  Did the director sneak something into the shooting script?  Was there a coterie of screenwriters who sneaked gay-related materials into the scripts?  How aware were the producers, and why did they choose either to push these efforts or to look away at the efforts of others?  The impression given in these analyses is that, since the film turned out a certain way, that is how the actor wanted it to be.  Just as there were a lot of collaborators, there were a lot of well-placed studio homophobes who wanted to remove these references and had the WW2 military- and McCarthy-influenced culture behind it.  There must have been some internal studio battles and battles with the censors.  Were some studios, producers, directors, or screenwriters more prone to show gay characters than were others?  What was the full story?

The Walter Brennan (et al.) section discusses the role of older sidekicks who latched onto the young hero.  I found it curious there was no mention of the sidekick sacrificing himself so the hero could go off with the girlfriend.

""The Silver Screen"" was entertaining, had good clips, and made its points efficiently.  The extras were the film's trailer, a trailer for a biography of Jean Seberg, and a short film on actor John Garfield.",1323216000,3,2448,4.926829268292683
999061,1,6305265100,"I thought this would be an interesting movie about the history of homosexual characters in cinema but it turned out to be a guy searching for any slight hint of a gay stereotype that most nobody else would see. Even gay people. If a character in a movie talks too sophisticated, is interested in the theater, or just likes hanging around his male best friend, he must be gay. To me, this kind of attitude is what makes many straight actors stay away from these kinds of roles and instead choose the roles that are mean spirited towards gays. Now a guy can't even get another guy a cup of coffee without some wacko out there thinking he's gay.",1287187200,6,642,4.4033613445378155
999062,1,6305265100,"I wasted 100 minutes of my life watching this drivel. This would be a C plus film school project at best. Its scope is very narrow, and it harps on Walter Brennan (!)  so much I wanted to scream. The point, that there were implicit gay relationships in otherwise hetero movies, was so well known by 1997 that this was a pointless exercise in snickering, smirking, and playing with libel.  If this mess was edited down to 60 minutes, without the awful ""host segments"" and backing off the Brennan obsession, it might be tolerable.

If you REALLY want the Hollywood Gay Back Story, buy Vito Russo's superb Celluloid Closet.",1227916800,9,620,4.669724770642202
999063,3,6305265100,"reasons... First of all, judging by technique and material employed, this film must have cost very little to make.  Secondly, the quality of the tape varies from very good to very bad (couple of shots are all blurry and kind  of twitching). High cost and average picture quality notwithstanding,  the  film itself is very interesting. Mark Rappaport gives us his own  perspective on politics of Hollywood. Although his perspective is very  subjective, it does make you think.  I think first of all this film was  meant to be good fun. However, if you look closer, you will find that  underneath all that humor and fun Mark Rappaport has produced a serious  study of Hollywood.  He has managed to connect fun material with film  theory, ""queer theory"" in particular.  Film clips, used to  illustrate author's point, vary from well-known ""westerns"" to  screwball comedy. All films mentioned are old and classic ones. I,  personally, could think of numerous other film clips that would fit in  perfectly, but perhaps those clips were not available to the authors. Keep  in mind that this film is neither a feature film nor a documentary. It is  simply a collection of clips, intercepted with humorous monologue, read by  Dan Butler.",959385600,14,1229,4.960591133004926

999326,3,6305265100,The narrator is Dan Butler who did an awesome job and it was very informative as to how the gay character evolved from the past to present day actors portraying gay characters. How it was unseen for any male to play a gay role unless it was a very feminine man which is offensive to our community. The stereotypes that needed to be seen on the screen just so the gay character can get a laugh and/or mocked cause it was too risky to show such love between two men on the big screen. We have come a long way from than but we are still fighting to be recognized as a true character for our abilities to portray a true gay man and not what Hollywood wants us to be portrayed as just to sell tickets.,1477094400,,696,4.087591240875913

Actually I will go a step forward and say I think it's just stupid, ridiculous garbage. I would think the host of the program would be ashamed of putting his face on this trash.

999647,2,6305265100,"With the film clips out of context, this suggests many ideas that probably were not intended. Basically you do better to know the actor, then see if his inclinations affected his acting. While the speculations in narration might be interesting historically by decade and have some validity, it is not these clips that make it so. I also think the point is worth making that these movies were often seen by innocent eyes, and perhaps many scenes also play out that this was the intention. Has the world really forgotten there is love and friendship between people of any sex inclination without an ongoing sexual relationship, or have we become too jaded ourselves? Or did Hollywood make us this way? The film clips are not really in sinc with the narrative, but it does open to some fascinating discussion. Never saw Sal Mineo, like the cover portrays. He was a sensitive actor who died sadly before his time. I think this misrepresents, and I stand by my first sentence. It can be an offensive, dumb at times ""film"" to some- so be warned..",1462147200,8,1040,4.688524590163935
999648,3,6305265100,"This is interesting, the old film clips especially, but it doesn't cover much that someone who has paid any attention at all to the subject would not already know.

999650,1,6305265100,"This is awful!!!!... I have never seen so much jumping to the wrong conclusions and deliberate skewing of context in my life!!! (and that was in the first 15 minutes)  I shut it off.  I didn't need to see anymore to know what this was and where it wanted to go.  I was ill the second they implied (wink wink) that Bob and Bing had a thing for each other and that it was alluded to, repeatedly, throughout their movies. And that when they both tried to kiss Dorothy Lamour's illusion which suddenly disappeared and they, accidently, kissed each other on the lips? [Why this... One must and is forced to question, mightn't THIS be a vehicle for them to, finally, express such pent up homosexual affection they truly had for one another?]

Apparently, if someone wants to believe something bad enough, they will turn Heaven and Earth upside-down, inside-out, topsy turvy and every which way to do it, even if (after all that) they have to just make it up when they come up empty.

I thought this was going to be comedy... a ""spoof""-type movie as it touted the likes of John Wayne and his ilk (I didn't read what it was all about... just saw John Wayne and said, ""I'm there!""... Little did I know, when I pressed 'play', I was headed down some dark alley, about to be clunked over the head and mugged by the Gay Mafia.

These liars have no qualms stretching the truth s-o-o-o-o-o far even if they have to fly far beyond the realm of absolute ridiculousness, on through to the more than far fetched fantasy regions of outer space.  This is a desperate attempt to further their agenda and placate their own pent up hostility and emotions... Looking for justification under rocks and trees... with no apologies to whoever they might malign in the process.

Bob Hope, Bing Crosby, John Wayne... the list is unwarranted, unsubstantiated and unbelievable.  It's despicable... a cacophony of shamelessly miscatorgorized clips.  What is obviously flippant, facetious humor and joke laden, riotous, innuendo, Mr. Rappaport has attempted to hijack and claims it ALL to be veiled homosexuality instead.

The poor targets are deceased human beings without the ability or benefit of rebuttal or to file a, much deserved and warranted, lawsuit for vicious and deliberate slander.  This is full of bold faced lies and delusional homosexual propaganda (and that was just the first 15 mins)... Implying that just about everyone EVER, in the long history of movies, was as queer as a 3 dollar bill. .",1461456000,5,2478,4.75058275058275
999651,4,6305265100,I like the way the program was presented. The clips were  entertaining. The narrator spoke about different stereotypes that Hollywood exploit both consciously and subconsciously,1461024000,,177,6.08

In my opinion, this documentary is a dreadful thumbsucker because the clips are interesting, but are smeared by top-of-the-head  and unsupported opinion that suggests many of the comedies and westerns of the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s and later featured homosexual-oriented writing and performances. Maybe. But I know this work fairly well and I don't think so.

It covers a few films from the 1930's-1940's (mostly westerns). And it seems to be obsessed with Walter Brennan?! The picture on the cover is only used during the trailer. This is false advertising! Not recommended. Stick to THE CELLULOID CLOSET!",1407888000,,385,4.848484848484849

1000078,5,6305265100,"Yes, this is a product by a low-grade distributor with little or no regard for production values. And yes, the film is more of a tongue-in-cheek lecture-demonstration than a PBS-style documentary. And no, it doesn't feature a lot of famous talking heads. BUT if you're a young American interested in the cinema, it will introduce you to gay-themed films that no similar documentary has covered - from the blatantly gay-themed technicolor film noir DESERT FURY to Visconti's homoerotic glorification of Alain Delon's sultry good looks in ROCCO AND HIS BROTHERS.
And in response to another review, you may have to be over 60 to appreciate the significance of the lengthy segment on Walter Brennan. After five decades of playing the loyal companion, the grizzled advisor and (finally) everybody's favorite ""Grandpa"" on television in THE REAL McCOYS, Walter Brennan's persona was considered as cozy and as All-American as Betsy Ross's flag. After watching this film, one can only wonder at the depth and breadth of our national sexual naivete.",1346198400,3,1039,5.190476190476191
7886324,1,6305265100,"A good documentary has a cinematic arc that mimics a fictional film. Various aspects are assembled, sometimes to create a wrong impression that is then corrected or sometimes to build a single, solid case with a conclusion. Other documentaries (such as Trinity, which shows the progression of American nuclear weapons during the Cold War) are more factual and recount events in a journalistic style. This mushy mess is neither, merely a collection of clips with inane commentary. It does nothing to address the elaborate closeting of actors such as Cary Grant, Tyrone Power, Randolph Scott, Katherine Hepburn, Barbara Stanwyck and many others, nor does it mention the efforts of various gay screenwriters to trick homophobic actors like Charlton Heston into scenes in Ben Hur that left no doubt to audiences about the eros. It's nothing but missed opportunities and stale green screen effects. Do yourself a favor and read Scotty Bowers's book instead.",1522108800,,952,5.228758169934641
