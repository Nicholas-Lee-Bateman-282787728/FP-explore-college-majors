1178410,5,0764005804,"I had Baby Songs VCR tapes for my grandkids who are now in college. I was glad to get CD's for my new younger pair. For some reason, kids are just mesmerized and hypnotised by these songs. Instant silence occurs when they play.",1252540800,,227,4.3023255813953485
1178411,5,0764005804,"Ok, to begin with I had no idea who Hap was.  I just knew that I didn't want my triplets hooked on broadcast TV stuff that was full of marketing, commercials, etc. So we ordered BabyFirstTV (kinda like HBO for babies) and during the programming they would show these videos.  It didn't take long for me to notice that my kids were MESMERIZED by Palmer's music videos.  I quickly recognized the prints and hairstyles from my own childhood (80's kid) and went on a search until I found the DVD's here.  The kids LOVED them and now that they are almost two they actually ask for them by name.  I would HIGHLY recommend these DVD's to anyone who is interested in exposing their children to music, rhyming, social skills, development skills, sillyness and laughter via your DVD player.  I am not saying they take the place of actual experiences but they sure do enhance them.  You don't know how handy it is to get your triplet toddlers to quickly cooperate and follow instructions by just singing a simple song to them. Anyway, long story short....  WE LOVE HAP PALMER AND THESE DVDs!",1180742400,2,1080,4.588541666666667
1178412,1,0764005804,"Strange, scary, and not musical at all.  The images are scary - grandmas flying through the air - baby cribs under water surrounded by giant fish looking like they'll eat the babies.  Music/songs are completely un-tuneful and instantly forgetful.  Images have little if anything to do with the songs.  I want my money back on this one.",1163980800,,335,4.824561403508772
1178413,2,0764005804,"My 8 year old daughter and I found parts of this movie somewhat freaky (although the two year old did fine).  The song called ""Lovey"" depicts stuffed animals suddenly becoming life-sized during the day.  The final vignette made my 8 year old cover her eyes - it depicts a scary looking puppet/dummy  (as if in an old horror show or twilight zone, like a ventriloquist would use) that suddenly opens it HUGE eyes, flies around the room (bed and all), and opens up the window.  We did NOT find this movie restful, although we like the other BabySongs videos...",1139616000,4,558,4.606060606060606
1178414,5,0764005804,"My 18 month old loves to drift off to sleep while watching this video.  It is relaxing for the entire family, which helps my son fall asleep easily.  I am going to get the CD version to play in his room at night.  (I don't believe it's available at Amazon, but if you search it, other links come up for Hap Palmer CD's)  We are big fans of all the Baby Songs videos and CD's so far.  My son loves to dance to them and is even starting to sing with them.",1109116800,,453,3.880434782608696
1178415,5,0764005804,We used this video as part of our night night routine.  It has cute songs that my 2.5 year old son has loved since he was 6 months old.  It's also a video that my husband and I didn't get sick of seeing over and over again.,1023321600,2,223,3.723404255319149
1178416,5,0764005804,"I was surprised to see the low rating this video had received and felt I had to offer another opinion since it has been one of my son's favorites since he was an infant.
""Baby Songs, Good Night"" is beautiful, profound, thoughtful, and mesmerizing.
There isn't a bad song on the whole tape.  It really is special.
Our favorites are ""Spinning on the Same Ball"", ""Lovey and Me"", ""Teddy Bear Ball"", and, as all parents will relate, ""I sleep 'til the Morning"" (my husband played this one three times in row to try to make a point, and for the first time in ten months, our son did - go figure).
""Sleep my Baby"" and ""Old Rocking Chair"", ""Counting Miracles"" and ""All Night, All Day"" are equally good, just not our favorites, but our son (now almost two) loves them.
""Sleep On"" is actually one of the more adorable songs, although, I understand the complaints made by a couple of the other reviewers.  The visual is certainly lacking, but, if you really listen to the song and ignore the visual, you'll be won over, it's very sweet.<...  There is one song which makes reference to ""angels watching over me"" and that's it. No Big Deal. Lighten up - the tape teaches love and acceptance - what's wrong with that?
My husband says the only down side on the tape is that unfortunately, we the adults, can't get the songs out of our head!",1015459200,4,1324,4.440329218106996
1178417,3,0764005804,"I highly support Hap Palmer's videos as entertaining and extremely well produced, however I did not like the Good Night video due to the religious nature of several of the songs.  Parents with strong beliefs in higher  beings may not find this video as problematic as we did.",956188800,5,275,4.708333333333333
1178418,5,0764005804,A MUST for kids,1414454400,,15,3.0
1178419,5,0764005804,"My daughter sleeps best when there is not just music but a video in the background. If she wakes up alone she will watch the video and go back to sleep, instead of looking for me. So when around age 1 she had sleeping issues I'd leave this video playing most of the night on low. It taught her to sleep better and not be awaken by household noises because the video itself has all sorts of noises in it (even loud crying sounds) followed by soothing songs. I believe that was intentional and very clever.
We love pretty much all of Baby Songs videos, but this one has the sweetest songs; waltzing to Teddy Bear Ball became a family tradition, and Counting Miracles is my personal favorite.",1402358400,,689,4.390625
1178420,1,0764005804,This DVD is strange. My kids have always loved the rest of the dvds in this series..not this one..even my 17 month old turned her head in confusion. More creepy than cute when grandma's chair goes flying out the window. Stick to the others in this series in my opinion.,1397001600,2,269,4.4
1178421,3,0764005804,"My daughter has enjoyed all of the Baby Songs DVD's I've purchased by Hap Palmer, but this one is her least favorite.

The songs are calmer and more relaxing than the other Baby Songs volumes, perfect for before naptime or before bedtime.  However, my daughter prefers the more upbeat songs over these.  (She also fights going to sleep, so maybe that's why?)  She will watch this DVD when she's in a very mellow mood though.

I also wanted to give a heads up to other parents, there is a lot of religious influence in this Baby Songs volume.  If you're a Christian you will probably be okay with it.  There are phrases like ""We all talk to God in different ways"" ""Angels are watching over me"" etc, etc.  Parents with different beliefs might not be comfortable with this however.

Overall, I would recommend this DVD for parents to play right before sleepytime. :)",1391558400,3,863,4.588235294117647

1178423,5,0764005804,"Originally had these dvds by Hap Palmer on tapes for my VCR, but no longer have a VCR so recently purchased three of them on dvd so my 7th grandchild could enjoy them as well.  All my grandchildren have danced and sung to them, or were rocked to sleep by them.  Love Hap Palmer's song, he is the best!!",1357603200,,302,4.101694915254237

1178426,3,0764005804,This DVD did not keep my two yr. old daughters attention like the other sing-a-longs I purchased. Possibly a good DVD for a daycare at nap time?,1291161600,,144,4.37037037037037
1178427,5,0764005804,"My kids have enjoyed Hap Palmer's entire series. He has an excellent voice, and his simple, clear lyrics speak to the kids where they are.  Not annoying like some kids music.  My only critique is the title ""Baby Songs"".  These songs are really aimed at preschoolers up to early grade school.",1263859200,,291,4.666666666666667

7902526,5,0764005804,"This DVD is like catnip for babies and toddlers.  As an adult I must admit I don't entirely understand why, but I have found this particular DVD will captivate babies and toddlers alike in a unique way.  When I first watched this DVD with my fussy six month old (who is now 8) I couldn't believe how it captivated her. The same magic has held true all these years later with my ten month old. This DVD is now my go-to baby shower gift because everyone agrees that it is a winning formula to soothe little ones.  If you are desperate for a few minutes of calm then definitely buy this DVD!!!",1421280000,,590,4.25
7902527,5,0764005804,My grandsons loved this video. It's perfect for 1 through 5 years. There are so many great messages that can be learned for the activities.,1419811200,,139,4.6
