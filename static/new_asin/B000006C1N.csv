7904086,1,B000006C1N,"This is a great film, long overdue on DVD thanks to Warner Bros, who've owned it since the 1990s but never put a DVD out until now.  Unfortunately they couldn't be bothered to include actual subtitles, once again giving us the closed captions for the English dubbed audio just like ALL of their other Golden Harvest DVDs.  It's completely disrespectful to the film, and the customer.  Put real subtitles on here and I'll be first in line to buy it.  It's a sad day when bootleggers put more effort into a release than the people who own all of the original materials for a film... but that is certainly the case here.  Someone at Warner Archive really ought to be embarrassed.",1461974400,16,676,4.553719008264463
7904087,5,B000006C1N,"Great movie, finally available in a good print from Warner Archive!

However, like other Golden Harvest releases from Warner, the subtitles are for the deaf so they include things like ""ominous music plays"" that totally kills the experience. Please provide an regular sub and closed captioning.",1460592000,5,294,5.391304347826087
7904088,5,B000006C1N,"This film is not about martial-arts. You won't see Jet Li or Jackie Chan flip in the air twice before a kick ,or wonderfully choreographed fighting scenes. It is the best HK drama I've ever seen.
About feelings ,and what they can make us do ,or achive. Ofcourse ,there are fights ,the protagonist must avenge his father ,but it's more about the revenge itself ,the drive ,than about how it's done. A story of human beings in a time and place so extreme ,that they are driven to the extreme themselves. great tale ,shot with more sensativity (and brutality) than any other film I saw.",997228800,,583,4.561904761904762
7904089,5,B000006C1N,"I have never seen anything like it.  Beautiful camera, settings, story line, everything.  The action is unmatched, and the fighting was so intense  you would almost believe it was all real. This movie definately is a must  see for any film lover, not just martial arts films. My all time favorite  on screen hero, and im sure he'll be yours after you see this film.",967075200,,365,4.553846153846154
7904090,4,B000006C1N,"When I bought this movie I thought that I was about to behold one of the best fighting movies ever from all the rave reviews that I have read. But instead I got a very Dramatic intellectually challenging story line with complex subtitles that sometimes resemble a good novel. But as for fights  this movie didn't pack much punch until the end although this movie does  contain some very inventive and well coordinated fight scenes by no means  should this movie be rated along those merits but rather for being a very  well filmed,superbly acted,dramatic piece of HK cinema. Buy it for the  story,very enjoyable,4 stars",957225600,5,619,4.80188679245283
7904091,5,B000006C1N,"The Blade is a classic Hong Kong movie. It's full of the ingredients that make Hong Kong action movies so cool - excellent martial arts, fantastic swordplay and an underlying theme of friendship and honour. If i have any  criticism to make about the movie it's because sometimes it's just that  little bit too hyper-kinetic. But who cares when the action this  eye-bleedingly good. Now if only Tsui Hark would stop using Van Damme in  his Hollywood movies and get Mark Dacascos or Jet Li instead.",956016000,4,496,4.732558139534884
7904092,5,B000006C1N,"Director is brilliant. The swords work is amazing! I feel sorry when I think that most people have never heard about it. See it. For outstanding sword work see also  ""Lone wolf and Cub""",940723200,,185,4.4411764705882355
7904093,5,B000006C1N,"After the first 6 minutes of the movie I turned to my wife and said ""If the movie ended right now I would glady come back and pay to see it again and again.""  This movie is AWSOME!",926467200,,180,3.736842105263158
