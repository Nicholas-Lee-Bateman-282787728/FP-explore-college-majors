91362,5,0790733919,"Perhaps one of the best movies of all time.  A true gem.  Paul Newman is at his best as a rebellious and charasmatic member of a southern chain gang.  His Christ like attributes have made this character a part of many  film studies classes in Jesuit colleges around the nation.  Along with the  religious aspect of the movie, the story is a remarkable tale of one man's  fight against society and its harsh laws.  This movie is an absolute must  for any collection.",918691200,3,465,4.506024096385542

But what is the point? This is just a depressing story about a guy who gets arrested and then ends up on a chain gang. He then decides to rebel against them with predictable results.

91518,5,0790733919,"By the time I was 25 I'd seen this movie a dozen times. I'm not sure but it seems like I've seen it several more times since, including tonight. I don't know if my sons get it or not. It was a product of its time, but the themes from the Gospels are eternal they say. They resonate with me at least. Paul Newman's most iconic role I think, is in this movie and he plays a Christ figure, so they didn't sell him short. His charisma comes through and it succeeds on many levels and has always moved me. As I young man I wanted to be like the protagonist--a hero who sacrifices or throws away everything and is never forgotten and also, of course, really lives forever. I'm 53 now, and I don't think Luke made it except in the hearts of his friends, and maybe that's all there is, but if so it wouldn't be worth getting shot. In the end it may not make perfect sense, but it is certainly one of my favorite Hollywood movies and the first great American movie of my favorite American period as it is that of so many other cinema lovers, the 70's. I worry that the young people growing up with their faces in their phones don't have the patience for something like ""Cool Hand Luke"".

91552,5,0790733919,"A good prison drama movie starring some well known actors of the era. George Kennedy and Paul Newman for starters. Ralph Waite of ""The Waltons"" TV show, Strother Martin who played many roles in Westerns is the leader or ""Captain"" of the ""road prison"".
This wasn't my first movie on any prisons, but it is a good one. Escape is always on ""Luke's"" mind, so he attempts it any chance he is given the opportunity.
He soon bonds with the other prisoners and is eventually looked up to in the camp. His escape attempts land him in some trouble after he is caught and the ""boss's"" who are working for ""Captain"" love to give him grief while in custody. His last escape is one he probably wanted all along. Permanent escape from the road prison.
Picture quality and sound are pretty good for the age of this movie. It looks good also if you play it back on any 4K equipment. I got a 2160p output on the Sony upscaling Blu-ray player and UHD TV.
Special Features were decent, but not overdone here. A Behind The Scenes featurette with a few interviews of actors and the beautiful actress who tantalized the men out on the road working. It was nice to see an interview of George Kennedy and Ralph Waite who are now both deceased as of recent years.",1499731200,,1237,4.406113537117904
91563,4,0790733919,"Review of Cool Hand Luke
Hot Toasty Rag, July 10, 2017

Everyone knows the famous line: What we have here is a failure to communicate. Its been quoted and spoofed so often that when you finally watch the original in Cool Hand Luke, youll probably burst out laughing.

But Cool Hand Luke is actually a drama, and a really great movie to come out of the 1960s. Unlike many films from the decade, it stands the test of time and earns its place as a true classic. Paul Newman plays Luke, a rebellious chain-gang prisoner determined to stand up to the prison guards and escape, if he can. Its an exciting, tension-filled ride, with Paul Newman in his bad-boy prime. Even if prison movies aren't your genre of choice, give this one a chance. Its full of iconic moments, and Paul Newman is extremely easy to root for.",1499644800,,810,4.466216216216216

The greatest movie ever about a person that won't ever let the system hold them down or compromise their own pride and integrity even at the greatest cost.  A story about comradery and blind faith.  The entire cast is amazing with George Kennedy as brilliant as Newman with the two of them taking the Oscars for their performances. Strother Martin, who seems to appear in every Newman movie, Harry Dean Stanton as enthralling as ever and are some faces just getting their starts like Dennis Hopper and Joe Don Baker.

91595,5,0790733919,"I have seen this movie twice and loved it both times.  Luke's father was good for nothing, except to make people laugh, and apparently was not in Luke's life.  Luke doesn't believe in God, is alienated, and the only way he knows to avoid boredom is to rebel against authority.  He says he wishes he were dead.  Placed in a prison work gang, he experiences the brutal side of life, but he never stops rebelling.  When his mother dies, his response is to pick up a banjo and sing the hilariously satirical song, ""Plastic Jesus.""  Near the end he is in a church, where he kneels and prays, but his prayer goes unanswered and he receives no help, because (as he already knows) God does not exist.  In the end, Luke gets his wish for death, and dies with a smile on his face, because he has escaped a painful life.  I admire the fundamental honesty and gritty realism of this film.",1494028800,,876,4.364197530864198

91734,3,0790733919,"Released in 1967 and directed by Stuart Rosenberg based on Donn Pearce novel, Cool Hand Luke is a prison drama starring Paul Newman in the eponymous role as a loner who disdains rules in the early 50s. He is sentenced to two years on a prison farm in Florida run by a stern warden, the Captain (Strother Martin), and guarded by a stoic rifleman, Walking Boss Godfrey (Morgan Woodward).  Carr (Clifton James) the floorwalker, tells the rules to the new prisoners with violations resulting in spending the night in ""the box,"" a small square room with limited air and little room to move. George Kennedy and Dennis Hopper are on hand as fellow prisoners, amongst many others.

I was wondering about the totally stoo-pid reason Luke gets 2 years in prison at the beginning of the film. He likely got a ticket for a ""violated"" parking meter while in town. So he has a few beers, gets his mitts on a big pipe cutter, and thought, ""I'm gonna show these jerks.""

Cool Hand Luke has a big reputation but, for me, it doesnt quite live up to it. The highlight is the iconic car wash sequence with Joy Harmon, as well as the ending when Luke talks with God about why He made him such a misfit. The rest is a decent prison drama about an eccentric individualist who inspires those around him stuck in the same pen. Its a character study of a likable, impressive, but unruly person who doesnt seem to grasp that getting sloshed and destroying public property has negative repercussions. Gee, maybe you shouldnt try to solve your problems by getting drunk and vandalizing.  The movie is realistic and well-made, but generally tedious, although Im sure thats the point  being confined on a prison farm WOULD be tedious. The Christ typology is interesting, however; and I can understand how some grade it higher.

The movie runs 126 minutes and was shot Tavares & Jacksonville, Florida; and San Joaquin-Sacramento River Delta, California, with studio work done in Burbank.

91741,5,0790733919,"Its been a long time since I saw this film, and my memories of it were of that smile of Paul Newmans.  Well, that and the egg eating sequence of course.  I wish I had revisited it sooner, I had forgotten what a classic it is  and forgotten how bleak it is too.
Its a character study.  The first sequence encapsulates much of the themes of the movie, where Newman is drunk and vandalising parking meters.  When the police come, he does not run, does not hide  but faces the punishment with both an air of inevitability, and a silly big grin, freeze framed as we go into the credits.  We join him again as he emerges into a road chain gang, and the rest of the movie reiterates this first cycle to increasingly heightened effect.  He is a quintessential rebel without a cause, and resists being any kind of figurehead.. Stop feedin off me he says at one point, as he pushes those away that are drawn to him by his spark of life they admire.  And yet he continues to walk his own course, non aggressively defiant.  Its a testament to how nuanced the film is, that it lends itself to endless debate on how much of a rebel he is, and how responsible does he feel for the other prisoners.
Its hard to imagine anyone else but Newman in the title role.  Who else could be that convincing as someone who amounts to nothing in the eyes of establishment, yet represents everything to do with hope and the future to the rest of the prisoners, and best of all  do it with the smile that we see throughout the movie at key moments.  It isn't just Newmans show though  George Kennedy shows what an actor he could be given the right material (i.e. not his usual 70s disaster flick sidekick role), and youll recognise some other familiar faces in early roles.
The texture of the plot and characters is matched by some superb cinematography.  The hazy sweaty heat of the South is compellingly portrayed (even if it was actually shot in California), and some images of the men swinging their blades against a backdrop of road and grass, with a haze of heat and cut grass hanging in the air are particularly memorable.  Then there are the iconic images of the Man with the eyes, his mirrored sunglasses giving him a permanently ominous look that bodes poorly of things to come.
On a final note, there are a couple of songs sung by characters In the movie that struck me as being some of the best placed diegetic music I can remember.
George Kennedys character may describe Luke as a big beautiful bag of nothin, but the movie goes to show  sometimes nothing can be a real cool hand.  And perhaps thats what the point is.. its not what life throws at you, its what you take from life, that matters.

91797,5,0790733919,"Some viewers will say that this movie is a bit dated now, and perhaps it is, but the underlying themes will never be dated. My first viewing in a theater at 15 years old was truly life-changing . It forever impacted my views on leadership, heroic masculinity, tenacity, healthy skepticism for authority, a true ""never-give-up"" attitude, the vagaries of friendship when sacrifices are required, and even (dare I say it) what it means to live a full and joyous life.
In a superficial viewing, one sees sadness and cruelty, but in truth , life on a the prison chain gang is but an exaggeration of the trials and tribulations of life itself. Through this movie we learn that it is how one deals with them that make one heroic, or not .
These are lessons often not seen by the current generation , nose buried in Pokeman, head lost in social-media-land, and looking for ""safe-spaces"".
Perhaps the most influential and uplifting movie I have ever seen.",1477008000,15,946,4.704819277108434

This movie had no plot, climax, or resolution. Watching it felt like I was watching a series of boring, dull, and repetitive events happening in Luke's life.

92177,5,0790733919,"There are many layers to this film and stoic Luke won't accept the norm because that would be bowing to defeat. Life on a prison work farm is laborious, but Luke becomes that shining light in a dark place, and his antics give his fellow inmates rays of hope. Trying to beat the system is never about winning and all about spoiling their hold on power, and even just for a few hours or days at a time.

92194,5,0790733919,No special effects at the center of attention. Just great acting by not only the main character (Paul Newman) but the supporting actors as well. I think that the very quality that makes Luke a screw up ( mainly his defiance of authority and thinking and acting for himself is also what made him a war hero (as pointed out at the beginning). I wonder what Luke would have become if he had been raised in an affluent environment. Senator? Governor? Certainly a man in charge given his natural leadership abilities. I highly recommend watching this classic. The fact that it is still being shown after almost 50 years says it all.,1453248000,4,627,4.607142857142857

92196,5,0790733919,"That's a famous line from this film. This is like my second favorite Paul Newman film. Second only to ""The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean"" (1972) yet to ever be released on to Blu-ray.

Anyway, this story feels very realistic. Luke (Newman) comes off as a hopeless bum, a loner who just gets drunk then without a thought, starts cutting off the heads of parking meters and then drops to sit down to have another slug at his warm beer, as the cops pull up to look at him and all the damage he's done. He sits there laughing with a little pride in himself for having destroyed some municipal property. This is where his prison life begins.

He really only got a few years but he gets to thinking that he just doesn't want to be there anymore. He didn't make friends very fast but they grew to respect him because of his lackadaisical behavior while being there.

From my point of view, that prison camp didn't seem so bad. If you behave yourself and do your time, the prison guards treated everybody pretty good.  But Luke put up resistance anyway. Escaped a few times, got caught a few times but then, the guards had to become more harsh with administering punishment to Luke.

In the end, I think he got what he wanted because he really didn't care if he lived or died anyway. The ending was poetic. I will enjoy this movie for years to come. I don't think I'll ever grow tired of it like you can do with other movies. This one is a keeper.",1452643200,2,1442,4.286764705882353

92198,3,0790733919,"Aside from the famous ""failure to communicate"" line, there's not much of note here.  The opening scene with Newman removing the parking meter heads is pure abstract cinematic art, but the rest of the film doesn't maintain that same visual style.  If it had, and if the inherent injustice of the mens' punishment had been communicated, ""Cool Hand Luke"" may have approached the level of Mizoguchi's masterpiece&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sansho-the-Bailiff/dp/B00A8QDHYW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sansho the Bailiff</a>.  We do witness the prisoners' inherent humanity, but the punishments are mostly deserved, and in any case, a work camp is much better than prison.

Primarily a vehicle for Paul Newman, this film is hardly deserving of its iconic status.",1452384000,2,804,6.151785714285714

george kennedy plays another prisoner who challenges Newman's character to a boxing match. newman keeps getting beat down but refuses to quit. maybe he got some kind of concussion that caused him to think escape was a good idea.

92385,5,0790733919,"Paul Newman made any number of good films in his career, many of them award-winning films, most of them memorable films.  Who can forget ""Somebody Up There Likes Me,"" ""The Long, Hot Summer,"" ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,"" ""The Young Philadelphians,"" ""Exodus,"" ""The Hustler,"" ""Hud,"" ""Hombre,"" ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,"" ""The Sting,"" ""The Verdict,"" ""The Color of Money,"" ""The Road to Perdition,"" or ""Cars,"" to name only a few.  But of all his films, my favorite remains ""Cool Hand Luke"" (1967), the very essence of everything good the man ever did in movies.

Ostensibly, ""Cool Hand Luke"" is the story of a gentle loser sentenced to a Southern road prison and his relentless attempts to escape.  In this regard, the movie works well as a drama and as an adventure, especially with its excellent supporting cast of feature players.  Look for George Kennedy in a role that won him Best Supporting Actor; plus Strother Martin, J.D. Cannon, Wayne Rogers, Lou Antonio, Jo Van Fleet, Clifton James, Dennis Hopper, Anthony Zerbe, Ralph Waite, Joe Don Baker, Rance Howard, and the dean of character actors, Harry Dean Stanton, among others.

On another level, though, the film is much more.  Similar to many books and movies of the 1960s, Donn Pearce's novel and his and Frank Pierson's screenplay are about Man's need to persevere, to struggle for personal freedom, to be oneself, to live as an individual within a world that does its best to impose conformity on all its citizens.  We see comparable themes in Ken Kesey's ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"" John Knowles' ""A Separate Peace,"" Robert Heinlein's ""Stranger in a Strange Land,"" Joseph Hellers' ""Catch-22,"" Kurt Vonnegut's ""Slaughterhouse-Five,"" and many more.  Luke quickly establishes himself as a leader among the prisoners on the chain gang, becoming their inspiration and their guide.  He demonstrates through example that giving up is the only form of defeat, and that Man need never give up, no matter what the circumstances.  In this regard, the movie inspires people to do their best to remain human in a society seemingly given over to making everyone alike.

Yet Luke accomplishes his uplifting message not through anything he says so much as through his deeds and actions, and it's here that the story takes an unconventional turn.  The narrative takes as its inspiration Pearce's own two years on a chain gang, true, as well as the life and teachings of one of the greatest souls ever to espouse the rights of Mankind:  Jesus Christ.  Think about it:  On the one hand, Luke feels alone, the symbol of modern existential Man; on the other hand, Luke is a teacher and a martyr, a Christ figure.  While it may not appear so at first glance, ""Cool Hand Luke"" does nothing less than borrow from the New Testament story of Christ to reinforce the message of prisoner Lucas Jackson.  Like Christ, who began his evangelical calling relatively late in his short life, Luke takes a while to find his purpose:  to inspire people to follow their own star and to instill in them the hope for something better.  In fact, the movie starts slowly and builds incrementally, taking most of the first half before it dawns on a viewer that the story is a Biblical parable.  Sacrilegious?  I think not.  After all, isn't it fitting that an inspirational movie be a parable, an allegorical tale meant to teach a moral principle, the kind of storytelling Christ Himself used so effectively during his ministry?

If you have never thought of the movie in this way before, a Gospel-inspired interpretation might be something of a revelation.  Once you begin looking at it in terms of its Christian symbology, it may surprise you how many similarities you'll find.

SPOILERS:
For the next few paragraphs, I'd like to point out several of film's more obvious Biblical references.  If you've never seen the movie before, however, you might want to skip this part and move along to the Video, Audio, Extras, and Parting Thoughts.

1.  Author Donn Pearce named the main character ""Luke.""  Luke is also the name of the man whom tradition tells us wrote the third book of the Gospels as well as the ""Acts of the Apostles.""  Like the Luke of the movie, Saint Luke remained unmarried, with no children, and his accounts of Jesus are among the most socially aware in the New Testament.  I suppose the movie could have named Newman's character Jesus, but that might have been a bit unsubtle.

2.  The number that Luke wears on his prison uniform is ""37.""  Luke 1:37 reads:  ""For with God nothing shall be impossible.""

3.  In the movie, Luke has only a mother, Arletta (Jo Van Fleet), never having known his father, a situation that reflects that of Jesus being the Son of Mary and of God.

4.  Luke calls upon God in rather ostentatious prayer several times during the film, each time referring to Him as ""Old Man,"" as in his old man (or father).

5.  Luke is basically an innocent, convicted for cutting the heads off parking meters, just as the Romans convicted and crucified Jesus on empty, trumped-up charges.  ""Small town,"" says Luke.  ""Not much to do in the evening.""

6.  The prison and road gang to which the court assigns Luke represent the oppression of society in general, in this case paralleling the Roman Empire, the guards and bosses symbolizing the might and authority of Rome.  Luke's greatest contribution in life is showing people that one can live within the confines and rules of any system, yet still be true to one's personal convictions.

7.  One guard in particular wears silver-coated sunglasses.  The convicts refer to him as the ""Man with No Eyes.""  Clearly, the story's writer means for him to exemplify the unwavering might of Rome and the ""blind justice"" the Romans dealt to anyone who opposed them.  In the long run, Christ's gospel won out over Roman law.

8.  Luke would appear to have nothing going for him but pure will, determination, charisma, and unshakable faith.  But faith, the Bible tells us, can accomplish anything.  Luke loses a fist fight to a much bigger prisoner, Dragline (George Kennedy), but wins Dragline's respect in the process.  ""Stay down,"" says Dragline, ""you're beat.""  ""You're going to have to kill me,"" says Luke.  Later, Luke wins a poker game with a losing hand by bluffing.  ""Nothing,"" says Dragline.  ""A handful of nothing....  He beat you with nothing.  Just like today when he kept coming back at me, with nothing.""  ""Yeah, well,"" says Luke, ""sometimes nothing can be a real cool hand.""

9.  The big man named Dragline becomes Luke's closest friend and most ardent supporter, although Dragline loses his confidence in him toward the end of the story.  Later, after Luke's death, it is Dragline who figures most prominently in mythifying Luke, turning him into a semireligious symbol and continuing to teach Luke's principles of self-assurance, self-reliance, and individuality.  The viewer may see Dragline as St. Peter, the most prominent of Christ's twelve disciples, the traditional ""Rock"" of the early Christian Church, and reputedly its first Pope.  Peter was a big man and a fisherman; thus, his common title, the ""Big Fisherman.""  And Peter denied Christ three times before His crucifixion.  Remember George Kennedy's 6'3"" frame and the name ""Dragline,"" as in fishing?  These things are not accidental.

10.  It isn't long before Luke gains the respect and following of his fellow prisoners (who become his disciples), mostly by doing the seemingly impossible--the miracles of the New Testament brought to life in the modern day.  Besides the fistfight and the poker game, Luke leads the men in tarring and graveling a road in record time.  ""Where'd the road go?"" asks Dragline.  ""That's it.  That's the end of it,"" says Luke.

Next, Luke claims ""I can eat fifty eggs.""  ""Nobody can eat fifty eggs,"" says Dragline.  ""Nobody ever eat fifty eggs,"" says Luke.  And he does.  When he's finished, the camera photographs him from above, lying on a table half naked, arms outstretched, belly swollen, his head surmounted by a halo of egg shells.  Anybody who doesn't get the point by this time has never read the Bible or seen a religious depiction of Christ on the cross.  To drive the point home, we later get a scene of the ""Last Supper.""

""Ain't you scared?  Ain't you scared of dying?"" Dragline asks Luke.  ""Dying?"" he responds.  ""Boy, he can have this little life any time he wants to.""

11.  When Luke tries to escape and the guards bring him back, they put into a solitary-detention box.  They give him only a white gown (resembling a white robe) to wear.  ""Sorry, Luke,"" says the guard, ""I'm just doing my job.  You gotta appreciate that.""  ""Nah,"" says Luke, ""calling it your job don't make it right, Boss.""

12.  Luke dies when the implacable prison guards hunt him down one final time and kill him.  It happens in a church, with Luke again talking to his God.  ""Hey, Old Man.  You home tonight?  Can you spare a minute.  It's about time we had a little talk.""

13.  A moment after Luke dies, a car rolls over the dark glasses of the ""Man with No Eyes.""  In death, Luke has defeated the ultimate authority; he has gone out his own way, leaving his martyrdom behind, an inspirational tale to live on forever.

14.  After Luke's death, we see Dragline spreading Luke's story to the other prisoners, perpetuating the legend, the myth.  Then we see a shot of a photograph of Luke with a pair of prostitutes on either side of him, the photo having earlier been torn up.  Now, we see the photograph restored (Luke resurrected), superimposed over the group of prisoners as they talk at a crossroads, shot from above.  It's Luke's picture against a cross, the two sinners on either side of him, his disciples in the background.

15.  And do you think it's a coincidence that when Luke's mother dies, Newman sings ""I don't care if it rains or freezes, 'long as I got my plastic Jesus, ridin' on the dashboard of my car,"" and Harry Dean Stanton does a heartfelt rendition of ""Just a Closer Walk With Thee""?

I really love this picture.

Trivia note:  Although the story's setting is in the rural South, the studio filmed most of it in California's Central Valley around Lodi, Stockton, and the San Joaquin River.  For Hollywood, Central California was closer to home and, thus, cheaper to film there.

Video:
Warner video engineers went back to original film elements to remaster and restore the movie.  Even if this Blu-ray, BD25, VC-1 transfer is still not among the best I've seen, compared to WB's old standard-def DVD edition, it is a night-and-day improvement.  Colors and clarity are preeminent here, with hues that are rich and vibrant and a screen that is free of noise, dirt, scratches, lines, or age.  There is quite a bit of location shooting in the film, yet these scenes display only an expected modicum of film grain.  Conrad Hall's 2.40:1-ratio Panavision photography shows up well, but razor-sharp definition may never have been a hallmark of the master print.  The fact is, the high-def image remains more than a little soft and fuzzy.  Fortunately, the deep, vivid colors make up a lot of ground lost to the object delineation.

Audio:
On the plus side, the newly mastered 1.0 monaural audio is warm and natural and probably sounds better today than it did when WB first made the film.  On the minus side, Warners use only an ordinary Dolby Digital track to reproduce it.  Perhaps on a single-layer BD25 they didn't have room for anything more, or perhaps they figured there wasn't much to reproduce and Dolby Digital was good enough.  Nevertheless, audiophiles and videophiles would no doubt argue that nothing but a lossless audio track is ever good enough.  I'll leave that issue for other people to debate.  My only minor concern about the new audio is that the level seemed a little lower than I'm used to and lower than on WB's old standard-def disc.  Perhaps there is a wider dynamic range involved, I didn't check; if so, it still sounds somewhat limited.  The main thing is that dialogue is rendered smoothly and realistically, and Lalo Schifrin's simple, folksy, jazzy musical score never sounded better.

Extras:
There are really only two bonus items on the disc, but they are among the more worthwhile extras you'll find on any disc because they're direct, concise, enlightening, and entertaining.  The first is an audio commentary by Newman biographer Eric Lax, whom I found both informed and informative.  The second is a 2008 documentary, ""A Natural-Born World Shaker:  The Making of Cool Hand Luke,"" twenty-eight minutes with the director, the writer, the composer, and many of the film's stars.

Things finish up with thirty-seven scene selections; a widescreen theatrical trailer; English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Japanese, and Portuguese spoken languages; English, French, Spanish, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, German, Italian, Japanese, Norwegian, Portuguese, and Swedish subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.

Parting Thoughts:
With ""Cool Hand Luke"" you get your money's worth.  You get engaging characters, an involving plot, exciting action, touching relationships, first-rate acting, an intriguing parable, and a slate of thoughtful ideas.  If you can't appreciate some or any of these points, perhaps you can take comfort from Strother Martin's character, the prison warden, who tells us ""What we've got here is failure to communicate.""  But I figure most viewers will have little failure understanding the movie and its motives.  They communicate brilliantly.",1433030400,,13531,4.886153846153846

92442,5,0790733919,"One problem with society is its tendency to marginalize those who are different or don't fit in and, to a degree, this is what COOL HAND LUKE is about. Luke is a loner who is picked up by the cops one evening for cutting the heads off parking meters while drunk. However inconsequential this crime might seem, it gets him two years on a chain gang and what transpires over the next couple of hours shows how one man resists a system which seemingly has no place (or use) for him. Despite the overall downbeat tone, the film still manages to have a sense of humor which is heavily derived from situations that one might find while in prison. It also helps that Paul Newman as Luke is so likeable and ""cool."" The title of the film comes from a scene in which Luke is playing poker with the other guys and wins by bluffing the other guy into folding. He says that ""Sometimes nothing is a cool hand,"" and from then on is called ""Cool Hand Luke."" Aside from Paul Newman's excellent performance, Strother Martin gives a great turn as the prison captain who, while seemingly easygoing on the surface, is quite authoritarian and does everything in his power to beat Luke into submission. He also gets an awesome quote which has become quite famous: ""What we've got here is a failure to communicate."" Not only is that a great line, but the way in which he delivers it suggests a weariness with the way that Luke has thus far managed to resist being broken. It was also nice to see Harry Dean Stanton, Ralph Waite and Dennis Hopper in supporting roles. Lastly, the cinematography and score by Lalo Schifrin were also excellent. My favorite element was a repeated closeup of a guard's sunglasses which showed the reflection of what he was looking at, and in general, the on-location shooting gave a very palpable sense of what the characters were feeling whether it was the scorching sun or pouring rain. Overall, this is an outstanding entry in that latter days of Hollywood's golden age which has been extremely influential on the films that have come after it. Whether you feel like you fit in or not, COOL HAND LUKE tells a great story with fine performances from its cast.",1427673600,3,2166,4.556410256410256

In this movie, he gains the respect of the prison and becomes the leader of the pack.  He remains rebellious in the face of authority and the prisonmates are split on who wants to continue to follow him.  The amazing thing about this movie is that nearly all of it takes place in the prison house and it still successfully manages to flush out character development, tensions in personalities and have movement within the movie pace.",1416268800,,582,4.471698113207547

I live in Georgia, the ""chain gang state ""...and I am old.
This film is very true to the real deal back then.

92621,5,0790733919,"10 STARS. Without a doubt, my all time favorite movie, and has been since I first saw it in the early 70s. Raw emotions.
Luke was a born leader, but didn't like the role. It seems he liked the ""idea"" of it, but push come to shove = ""Why are you all feeding off of me....??"" His military career is amazing, but he wants no applause, it seems he just wants it forgotten. Which is pretty much the way all of the best soldiers want it viewed - just doing my job (duty).
I want to keep typing here, I feel like I should, it really is a GREAT movie & no matter what I type it won't begin to scratch the surface.

By ALL means, if you have not seen this movie RENT it, BUY it, BORROW it, STEAL it (no don't steal it), but you really need to see this one.

He escapes the evils of this world and gives the inmates hope that they can too. His picture is torn just so.... just in the image of the cross. The best of a tradition, the best in man -- the divinity shines through in Luke's character. He doesn't want to be sacrificed, but he is anyway. It was inevitable.

I wouldn't recommend this flick if it weren't highly entertaining, but beyond that it is jam-packed with powerful lessons for doing your work and living your life. Luke's determination to eat 50 eggs is a beautiful metaphor for persevering your way to achievement of your goals.  When I'm speaking about corporate culture I often use the ""where'd the road go?"" scene to illustrate what a profound impact a change of attitude can have on how we do our work.",1394236800,,486,4.843373493975903

It does not offer the best quality that blu ray is capable of due to the age of the film, and I would love a new remastered edition, but it is as good as it gets for now. 5 star film. 5 star actor. 5 star character.

A person could go their whole life through without realizing what a genius actor Paul Newman was, but this film will stand forever as a tour-de-force of acting. Aimless defiance and bittersweet rebellion are the only dialogue Luke is interested in having with the prison world he finds himself in, and each piece of personal victory narrows his choices dramatically until he is left with nothing but the coolest hand of all. A performance for the ages.

93076,1,0790733919,"Newman is almost always good because he was a man of integrity, which fits his character Luke perfectly. The part and the person are one. Here he plays his standard 60s outsider again, and he's attractive in many ways, and the men come to idolize him.  The problem with this film is that is much too long, unfocused, and for many long stretches just not entertaining.  Sure there are some cool lines, and some good ole boy dialog, and even some pretty sunrises (filmed in Stockton CA not Georgia).  But it is also full of cruelty, beatings, whippings, and this fairly standard prison story becomes, at the hands of the director and writer, something odd with undercurrents of masochism, sadism, martyrdom, and homo-eroticism. It is all very weighty and too much. The barracks scenes are stagey and awkward, as is the embarrassing scene where Luke talks to God (gospel of Luke, get it?  sheeesh...) So in the end the sum of all these parts does not make a very coherent film or a very good one.

For those who still enjoy this type of inspirational story of individualism, check out ""Sometimes a Great Notion"". For those of you who idolize gansta drug dealers, misogynistic rap stars, weak-wristed poetic losers, or hopeless romantic werewolves, your choices from the Hollywood studios are multiplying rapidly.

This movie of course has one of the all time great quotes to it, if you've seen it, you know what I'm talking about.  Paul Newman plays a convict who is sent to prison to work on a chain gang and he doesn't make too many friends at first but earns respect soon.
Really good story to it, some funny parts, good action, some drama, just really an overall enjoyable movie to watch.  I watch it anytime I see it on one of the older movie channel's like Turner Classic or AMC.  After watching it, you kind of want to strut around like Cool Hand Luke and be joe cool like him.....but we all know, there is only one Paul Newman who can pull that off.

93464,5,0790733919,"I think it's safe to say Paul Newman helped define the contemporary American male that emerged between WW2 and the androgynous 60's (most of which occurred on  a mass, mainstream level in the 70's).  A transformation that morphed the male ideal to one of feminine beauty.  But in between the laconic, rugged individualist (Gary Cooper, Humphrey Bogart, John Wayne) and the cute, physically non-threatening boy toy (David Cassidy, Paul McCartney, Mick Jagger) was the charismatic outsider (Marlon Brando, James Dean, Paul Newman): beguiling yet dangerous, clean cut yet anti-authoritarian--refusing to give in to the societal polemic that demanded conformity.  And this post-modern male persona, established in many movies (ON THE WATERFRONT, FROM HERE TO ETERNITY, REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE to name only three) was perhaps best exemplified in the movie COOL HAND LUKE.

  We fall in love with Luke during the opening scene, I think:  The utter stupidity of a grown man, drunk & alone, cutting off heads of parking meters is, well, damn satisfying to watch.  There's something Dostoevskian about it (from NOTES FROM THE UNDERGROUND: ""What about the millions of facts that show that men, deliberately and in full knowledge of what their real interests were, spurned them and rushed in a different direction?  They did so at their own risk. . .refusing to follow the safe, well-trodden path and searching for another path, a difficult one, stubbornly working their way along it in the darkness).  And our love of Luke is sealed--after he opens the beer he'll never drink--at the beginning on that beautiful freeze-frame of him laughing at life: her struggles, her injustices, her seeming insistence that we conform, or else.

  And that is also why we loved Paul Newman.  He deflected (or more accurately Fast Eddie, Luke, Butch, & Henry Gondorf did) the slings and arrows life through at him with a grin and a twinkle in his eye that couldn't help but win us over to his side.  We are so rooting for Luke to connect with his mother, to escape the chain gang, to achieve the miraculous feat of eating 50 eggs.  And speaking of miracles, you may or may not know that this movie is a retelling of the story of Jesus (complete with disciples, miracles, persecution, doubt, prayer, crucifixion, and resurrection).

  The last image we see is of a photo in a magazine Luke had sent the chain gang showing him living the good life.  When they find out the picture is a phony and that Luke is not the man they thought he was, Dragline rips it up.  At the end of the movie, the photo has been resurrected: the repaired rips forming a Cross after faith in Luke has been restored.  But however you chose to interpret COOL HAND LUKE, it is Paul Newman whom we ultimately respond to.  With all the lives he impacted, he was--on & off the screen--one of the quintessential American males of his times.  I mean, think about it.  Is there anything more inconsequential or irrelevant than a movie star?  Has there ever been a movie star more relevant than Paul Newman?  He was a natural born world-shaker.",1346976000,2,3082,4.830152671755725
93465,3,0790733919,"It's hard not to like the subject matter of this movie, and I've enjoyed the movie immensely over the years, but recently I've begun to understand the film in a new and less flattering way.

Paul Newman, who was simply one good looking fellow, plays the part of an aimless war veteran who finds himself doing two years on a chain-gang (road work) as sentence for destroying public property. The release year of this film reflects it's content - Hollywood was busy pushing aside film heroes like Jimmy Stewart who reflected and performed to traditional American values, and instead was promoting the anti-hero; for example, James Dean.

Dialogue in this film when Newman's character, Luke, is conversing with his mother is a mishmash best understood as the screenwriter trapped between the wish to throw old conventions aside, and his fear that going too far would alienate the paying public.

This film is leftism trying to emerge from the shellacking it took when The American Way emerged triumphant from World War II. Vietnam and Nixon's resignation would provide all the cover leftist needed to fully emerge out from under their rocks. I've come to understand now that much of Newman's career was employed in posing as the palatable anti-hero for a nation not yet ready to embrace that which is vile without excuse or embarrassment.",1345420800,,1335,4.950892857142857

Luke is an outcast. No matter what happens, he is not going to play by the rules. Not on the streets. Not on the chain gang. There are no special effects here. No hype and no gimmicks whatsoever. You do get treated to the sweet sounds of Harry Dean Stanton and his guitar. Cool Hand Luke is 100% heart. Its all about not giving in no matter what. Its about never letting the world break you down. If you are one that is familiar with these themes: check this one out. It is as classic as it gets.",1345075200,,719,4.1063829787234045

93505,5,0790733919,"Bought from Amazon US and I took a gamble on it.
I play my Blu Ray movies on a PS3 with a Sony HD 1080 TV.
My PS3 played the movie even though my coding is not Region A and it does say US and Canada only (confused)
Moving on.
Still looking to purchase a region free blu ray player in Asia when I can afford but was so excited this one run for me, thanks Warner.
I was 11 years old when this was produced and first seen the movie in the cinema a few years later.
My cinema experiance was on a wet Wed afternoon in the North East of England whilst skipping School at the local Odeon my place of escape as a confused teenager.
What a fantastic story, just amazing and I then understood why I was a rebel of some sort who wanted more from Life and was willing to work for it.
Romance over, grown up now and can still be a rebel at times.
Not sure what the budjet was for this movie and how they even managed to edit it.
Must have been a lot of dumped takes.
For instance look at the boxing, the low camera angles in the early part of the fight on a Sat afternoon.
Luke gets up from another knock down and peers at the ankle chains of a bystander, was that a mistake as later on all were seen to be free.
The punch shots in your face, cinema at its best and we are talking the 1960 era here.
The acting was fantastic, looks like they all had fun making this one.
Wish I could see some out takes also.
Before I move to the Blu Ray experiance I would say for one this movie has been underestimated as one of the greats since cinema rolled out the first.
Place it in the action/story cat and over the las 50 years this one should be in the top ten if not top five.
The movie story justs move on with great directing to a point in a cinema you will never leave your seat for a snack or the bathroom.
Pee in the bottle you are holding empty (rebel)and starve as in my case I did not because some kind lady sold me something that used up my bus fare home.
What a walk home though, give me time to think my rebel ways were not the way to go even though my Parents in my eyes did not understand me.
I asked my Mother for boiled eggs and I think She gave me two fried with chips.
Always like a boiled egg after this movie.
I had to educate them on how smart I was (later)
The blu Ray transforamtion is fantastic, my opinion as I have it on vcd, dvd, vhs.
Look at the sweat coming off the guys on blu ray, amazing.
The whole blu ray experiance is a must for such a great movie that has probably faded in the history of great movies.
All I will say is buy it and you will play this again and again to lets say a visitor aud because you can never be bored with great acting and directing.
Have some iced cool drinks on hand also as this will make you feel hot.
My two teenage kids just watched it also and asking daddy who is Paul Newman.
I told them He is the Brad Pitt of that era and it seemed to have gone down well.
Cinemas world wide should have a day when they show epics on a grand scale to give the younger generation a chance to see movie making at its best without the usual digital imposed scenes that we see now.
Oh well, I think you will all agree I am an old fart but an old person who loves cinema at its best and has seen the benefits of upscaling to blu ray to view old great movies like this without deleting.

93532,5,0790733919,"Cool Hand Luke is the story of a unique individual who gains a following among the inmates while serving time in a Southern prison for a drunken act of vandalism.

An independent thinker, he kowtows to no authority, whether it be the Captain who is chief overseer of the prison, Carr the floor man of the prison barracks, or Dragline the burly leader of the inmates.

In his first few days at the prison, Luke manages to antagonize all three with his willfulness.  When his differences with Dragline escalate into a boxing match, Luke's refusal to surrender when beaten earns him Dragline's friendship and respect, which, in turn, raises his esteem among the other prisoners.

In time, Luke's spirit, which refuses to be chained by the conformity of prison life, and his selflessness, which causes him to sacrifice himself in order to entertain and educate his fellow inmates, make him a figure of admiration and affection within their ranks.  This does nothing to improve his lot with the prison authorities, who begin to look upon him as a rebel and a threat to the order of the establishment.  Among these authorities is the inscrutable ""Man with No Eyes,"" a figure of superhuman evil to the other inmates who is so named because of his impenetrable sunglasses, which is a mask that separates him from other men.

Although Luke is seemingly willing to ""pay his debt to society"" at first, the Captain's unjust restraint as a means to keep him from escaping to attend his mother's funeral provokes Luke into full rebellion.  His entire energy is then focused upon escaping the prison.  He escapes and is captured, and then escapes again.

The second time he is captured, the prison authorities torment him to break his spirit.  When he succumbs to their torture, the other inmates turn from him, seeing his capitulation as a personal betrayal.

Luke's surrender, however, is only temporary.  He dupes the authorities and escapes for a third time, with Dragline following him.  Luke, however, urges him to go his own way and experiences a personal Gethsemane in an abandoned church.  In the meantime, Dragline is captured and unknowingly becomes the Judas who alerts the authorities to Luke's hideaway.  Luke is shot by the prison authorities and Dragline, painfully aware that he has been used, attacks the ""Man with No Eyes,"" knocking the sunglasses from his face and breaking them.  We last see the ""Man with No Eyes"" stumbling and vulnerable, his mask destroyed.

We might deduce that Luke has died, since Dragline shares his memories of him, triumphant in defeat, with his fellow inmates.  Dragline now wears shackles on his feet, as Luke did after his first escape, a symbol of his affinity with this rebellious, independent, and freedom-loving martyr.",1318377600,,2758,4.93073593073593

I saw this a few days ago on TV and was hooked within the first fifteen minutes and as I was unable to finish watching it I bought it straight away and I know already that this will be one film I will watch again and again. This has an amazing performance from Paul Newman as Luke, a loner who refuses to bow to the might of authority, whether it be in society or in the prison he is sent to. He manages to inspire his fellow inmates with his humour and quiet dignity in the face of the warders cruelty and you can't help but connect with his character. This has many memorable scenes and the egg eating scene is wonderfully funny and yet others scenes are especially poignant and emotional. The direction is pretty good, if a little dated and stylised, but this only adds to the character and classic nature of the film on offer. The supporting cast are very good in this film and the entire ensemble elevate this film from being merely good to being great.

93574,5,0790733919,"I hope, even when we have a much more equitable society than we do now, we still have ""free spirits"" like Cool Hand Luke (played, and played well with just enough 1960s sneer and `devil take the hinter post' bravado by the late Paul Newman). No, not the hard- scrabble, mad mother-loved, growing up kid part, not the wise, too wise, before his age part that made him cynical, not the world-weary and world- wary before his time part but the crafty, fidgety, authority can go to hell part. That is a trait, as this film makes abundantly clear, no well-valued in current bourgeois society interested as it in the well-oiled machine, and a sullen by-the-numbers mass of humanity.

Of course, as the story line here unfolds, ""free spirit""-types take more than their share of beatings in life, and no where is that more true than in a prison. And given old Luke's brand of free spirit (and edginess) he was bound to wind up in prison, sooner or later, no matter how ""street smart"" he was, or brave in military service. However, nothing in his resume would make one think that even in prison, a notorious Southern work camp prison to boot, that old Luke would knuckle under. Something has to give. Throw in a sadistic warden (played by Strother Martin of the famous line used in the headline to this entry), some love/hate camaraderie with fellow inmates, especially ""big lug"" Oscar-winner George Kennedy and you have a volatile mix. Old Luke will keep running that rock up the mountain but you know in your bones, deep in your bones, that rock is coming back down one more time than it is going up. And right over him.

93577,5,0790733919,"""Cool Hand Luke"" is a classic movie and I remember being very impressed with it in the first run in the late 60s. Paul Newman portrays a slacker/rebel/antiestablishment/nonconformist young man who's going to do things his own way no matter what the consequences. We've all known young people like him. Of course, he runs into problems with the law and gets thrown into the slammer for vandalism. That's only the beginning of a long and complicated downhill run.

It's a rather depressing movie with a couple very funny and uplifting parts that are so good it makes watching the whole movie very worthwhile. One is the spot when the working prison gang passes by a scantly clad young lady washing a car and doing everything possible to attract the attention of the workers. Funny? Just amazing! A second very funny scene is where Luke claims that he can eat 50 eggs and then carries out the boast in an increasingly agonizing fashion. These two scenes save what might have been a rather dreary movie and turn it into a classic.

The sound and photography are excellent. Paul Newman is outstanding and George Kennedy is the best I've ever seen him in any roll. It's an excellent, if somewhat depressing story and makes for wonderful entertainment.

93618,5,0790733919,"Paul Newman has made so many exceptional films it's impossible to narrow down his five, or ten, greatest gigs.  But I know one thing:  COOL HAND LUKE definitely ranks in the upper stratosphere of his career.  Playing an easy-going, aimless rebel, Newman brings his character to uber believability without even saying a word; just a grin, a smirk, a wink--and he has the audience in the palm of his hand.

Yes, this is a prison flick, yet it's unique in that the setting is a rural prison in the Deep South that is stark and brutal and the inmates labor under a sweltering sun as a chain gang, their images reflected in the sunglasses of a rifle-toting, silent head guard.  The film is all at once humorous, compelling, menacing, and poignant; it's an anti-establishment film (there were several made during this period) where we as the audience root for the rebel--even though we know Authority is eventually going to take him down.  Playing ""Cool Hand"" Luke, Newman is completely likeable as he meanders through his role and bucks ""the system""; he's ultimately going to lose, which points to the inevitable pathos of the story.

Newman is supported by a topnotch cast, led by a grinning, good ol' boy George Kennedy as his enthusiastic sidekick.  I enjoyed brief appearances by so many actors who went on to have exemplary careers, including Wayne Rogers, Dennis Hopper, Ralph Waite, and Joe Don Baker (in an uncredited role).  COOL HAND LUKE is exceptional cinema and entertainment; while it might be impossible to pinpoint Paul Newman's finest role, this is definitely one of them.

93620,5,0790733919,"All art reflects, to some degree, its era. ""Cool Hand Luke"" appeared at a time when people were increasingly losing their respect for authority. So it's natural to see Lucas Jackson as a rebel against the establishment, and nothing more.

But Lucas is, in a way, a lot less -- ""A 'nothing' hand can be cool"". As he says to Dragline, ""I've never planned anything in my life."" He has no goal or purpose, moving aimlessly from one thing to another (we learn he was promoted several times in the Army, but demoted to buck private before discharge), and the crime for which he's sentenced -- ""decapitating"" parking meters -- is a pointless prank committed during an evening of drunken boredom.

Lucas's only purpose is to defy authority, and he does that right well. /Why/ isn't clear, but one could assume his motivation is ""If my life has no constructive purpose, I might as well give the bird to the powers that be"".

One can also view Lucas as self-destructive. His sharp wit is not only that of an intelligent person, but of a morbid person. (I know this from personal experience.) And when his sweet mother -- who loves him, as she says, for no reason at all -- dies, his decline begins in earnest. It can be argued that his repeated attempts to escape are attempts to get himself killed. Which is what happens. (Didn't you know that?)

Luke is neither hero nor anti-hero. He is a man who sacrifices himself on society's cross because he doesn't really fit in anywhere -- it's the only thing he /can/ do. And society is happy to oblige his desire for self-destruction.

No doubt about it, this is a great film.

The Blu-ray transfer is generally excellent, showcasing the outstanding cinematography, both in and out of the studio. The only disappointment is having to hear Lalo Schiffrin's imaginative score in mono. The ""making of"" featurette is outstanding, way-above-average for this sort of thing.

The performances are nuanced and powerful, the on-location shooting resonates with heat and oppression, and the story and characters exude archetypal impact.  The reviewers who claim that the ""moral"" of this film is that people should not assert individuality in prison clearly have no understanding of the word ""allegory,"" because in a symbolic sense, the exact point of the film is that the existence of the human spirit depends upon asserting individuality in the face of brutal, institutionally-backed conformity.  As a systematic, hard-headed noncomformist, Newman's Luke is purposefully cast as a savior figure--which is why he's photographed via the iconography of crucifixion after the egg-eating contest, for example--and reviewers who take his character to task for rebelling against the system completely miss the point and go a long way toward demonstrating the very problem the movie works to expose.",1272412800,,1016,5.584415584415584
93623,5,0790733919,"Released in 1967, COOL HAND LUKE was among a wave of 1960s and 1970s films--BONNIE AND CLYDE, EASY RIDER, and ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST to name but a few--to present the classic David and Golitath story of a likeable rebel going up against established powers. In these films, however, David rarely overcame Golithah; he was instead destroyed and we the audience were left to admire his courage and despise the powers that destroyed him. In the case of COOL HAND LUKE, based on a 1965 novel by Donn Pearce, the hero was a World War II veteran who, for reasons of alcohol, amused himself by cutting the heads off parking meters in a small southern town--and consequently finds himself doing time on a chain gang. He also finds himself incapable of following the rules, and it doesn't much matter what the rules are; he is a born rebel, a never-say-die fighter, a man who simply cannot turn from a path once he has set foot upon it. And from his first day the powers that be are determined to rob him of all humanity and break him of all self-respect.

Like ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, most of the film plays out like a comedy, with a host of memorable characters as both prisoners and guards. On the prisoner side the cast includes George Kennedy (who picked up a Best Supporting Oscar for his work here), Dennis Hopper, Wayne Rogers, and Ralph Waite, to name but a few; on the guard side is the truly memorable Strother Martin, who runs the county farm with the assistance of brutal killers. Jo Van Fleet and Joy Harmon also shine, the first as Luke's tough but dying mother, the second as a country girl who decides to give the chain gang a treat by washing her car in the most seductive manner possible. The cast is a director's dream, and Stuart Rosenberg makes the most of it; although most of his previous experience was with television, and although his later films are hardly worth mentioning, he gets the most out of the actors and script, and the result is... both hilarious and bitter, comic and painful, and ultimately incredibly ugly.

The atmosphere captures the feel of a county ""farm"" prison and a chain gang in an uncomfortably realistic way; I was born and raised in the deep south, and I can attest to the fact that such beat up shacks, brutal punishments, and chain gang labor was common well into the late 1970s--and in some instances are only now beginning to be uncovered and prosecuted. The film is also rife with covert references to homosexuality, a fact that seemes to have gone of the heads of the censors of the day but resonated with audiences in a ""boys will be boys"" sort of way. But the thing that makes COOL HAND LUKE such a winner is Paul Newman's spectacular performance in the title role and the humor he and the rest of cast brings to the film--from card games to egg eating contests, from escape attempts to outwitting the guards. But as Luke learns the hard way, one can only outwit the guards so many times, and when the establishment wants you broken, you're broken, and when the establishment wants you dead, you're dead. Sometimes we need to be reminded that cinema can be much more than just eye candy--happy dragons and CGI effects and other such foolishness. It's a cruel world we live in, and it hasn't changed much since Newman and company stepped before the cameras to make this film.

You'll laugh at Luke and his prison mates. You cringe at the guards with their icy eyes. You'll cry. You'll be outraged. And although it is a painful trip, when the movie ends, you won't regret having taken it. Strongly recommended.

93626,5,0790733919,"Paul Newman stars as eccentric war veteran, Lucas Jackson. Luke lives in a tiny southern town. And he gets himself sentenced to a chain-gang, after he gets drunk and destroys some parking meters one night.

The chain-gang camp, is run by a seemingly fatherly, yet ruthless Warden, called the Captain. Luke and his fellow inmates, are forced to perform back-breaking chain-gang duty, in the scorching southern heat every day. Under the directive of the Captain, brutal punishment is meted out by the prison guards, to any inmate who disobeys the stringent prison rules.

Luke, rebellious soul that he is, refuses to knuckle-under to the sadistic guards. Luke's steely determination, wins him the reverent admiration of the other inmates. After two failed escape attempts, Luke is subjected to vicious torture, by the guards. The Captain, with the help of the monstrous guards, makes it his mission to break Luke's spirit.

Paul Newman is amazing in his role as Luke. I couldn't imagine any other actor portraying the character of Luke, as deftly as Newman did. George Kennedy plays Luke's burly inmate pal, Dragline, with consummate skill. Jo Van Fleet, gives a wonderfully poignant performance, as Luke's dying mother, Arleta. And Strother Martin, conveys the obsessive resolve of the Captain character, with a frightening intensity.

Other members of the supporting cast shine too. Dennis Hopper, Lou Antonio, Ralph Waite, and Harry Dean Stanton, all give moving performances as prison inmates. Bob Woodward gives a hideously chilling quality, to his mute, blind, sharpshooter road-boss character.

In summation, Cool Hand Luke will always remain a classic of American cinema, for generations to come.",1265587200,2,1702,5.312267657992565
93627,5,0790733919,"This is BY FAR my Favourite Paul Newman film. I love a good prison flick, and this one Really Delivers.

The film is a classic these days, with a great ensemble cast, and Newman as the anti-hero. The prisoners work on a Chain Gang in the south. And Newman is a New Arrival who earns everyones respect quickly. The films follows the everyday life of these men in a small prison, and has everything you need in a prison movie. The story is very basic, but like a lot of the classics, they do a lot with very little. So much of this is Newman dealing with being an under-acheiver and never quite feeling like he belongs anywhere. But this is nicely understated, so it does not give the film too heavy of a feeling or make it overly sappy.

The film also has a nice featurette in the special features which I quite like. It's about a half hour, and has lots of cast and crew interviews. I really like features like this, and it is done very well.

If you like classics, Paul Newman movies, Prison movies or just Good films, you check this out.

And if your new to Paul Newman and liked this try HUD (badass Newman) BUTCH CASSIDY & THE SUNDANCE KID (classic western with Robert Redford) THE STING (with Redford again, my 2nd fave Newman flick) and CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF (classic, no action, but superb acting)",1265328000,,1304,4.310204081632653

Paul Newman, of course, turns in his customary bravo performance, but at the end of the day many viewers will have difficulty identifying with the protagonist of this film. (Paul Newman, as ""Luke."") Luke has a two-year sentence at hard labor, and seems to go out of his way to make things difficult for himself. The terrible truth of prison life is that the guards and administration have absolute power over you, and prison is accordingly no place to try to assert individualism. That is the basic moral of this not-uplifting story but Luke cannot seem to get this notion through his head.

This one is probably a realistic portrayal of 1950s era prison life. But it is not a film I would care to watch more than once. RJB.",1254009600,,788,4.549295774647887

93664,5,0790733919,"""Cool Hand Luke"" was adapted from the novel by Don Pearce, who spent some time on a Florida chain gang and based his leading character, Lucas Jackson, one-third on a real man he knew in prison, one-third on himself, and the rest is fiction. Lucas ""Luke"" Jackson (Paul Newman) is sent to a Southern prison camp for ""maliciously destroying municipal property while under the influence"" -busting parking meters, where the prisoners work on a chain gang doing road work. A big, boisterous inmate nicknamed ""Dragline"" (George Kennedy) at first sees Luke as a challenge to his position, but soon comes to admire Luke's daring and stubbornness. His fellow prisoners find Luke's fearlessness inspiring, but the prison warden and guards are uneasy with it.

George Kennedy won the 1968 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of the friendly, simple country guy who idolizes Luke. He's one of many notable character actors in the film's large supporting cast. ""Cool Hand Luke"" harkens back to the prison films of the 1930s, also produced by Warner Brothers, in its social conscience message and antihero protagonist. It particularly reminds me of ""I Am a Fugitive from the Chain Gang"" (1932), written by another man with experience on a Southern chain gang. ""Cool Hand Luke"" is beautifully shot by cinematographer Conrad Hall, who would win an Academy Award much later for another Newman film, ""Road to Perdition"" (2002). I don't think I've ever seen a camera move so much on landscapes. It's captivating.

One thing that characterizes films with enduring greatness is that they invite more than one reading of the material. ""Cool Hand Luke"" is a character study of Lucas Jackson, a man whose stubbornness is less a conviction than it is self-destruction. Or perhaps it is not about Luke at all, but about how those around him react to his unwillingness to conform. If we are to view Luke simply as an inmate, he is a masochistic fool. If we interpret the prison as a microcosm of the greater society, he is the nonconformist through whom the rest of the population lives vicariously and  whom authorities fear simply because he does not fear them. The prison has nitpicky rules, but there doesn't seem to be much reason to disobey them. Yet Luke cannot bring himself to live that way. Perhaps the conclusion is that we need people who are a little nuts to flout society's norms sometimes.

The DVD (Warner Brothers 2008): Bonus features are one featurette, an audio commentary, and a theatrical trailer (3 min). ""A Natural-Born World Shaker: Making Cool Hand Luke"" (30 min) includes recent interviews with director Stuart Rosenberg, screenwriter Frank Pierson, Paul Newman biographer Eric Lax, novelist Dan Pearce, and many members of the cast and crew who talk about getting the film made, camaraderie on set, and filming. The audio commentary is by Newman biographer Eric Lax, who did not participate in the film, so he has a scholar's view, not personal recollections. He talks about the making of the film, its anti-authoritarian themes, characters, sets, and takes us through the film. Subtitles available in English SDH, French.

That's how great this cast is, and Paul Newman leads it with aplomb, his handsome charm a mask for what a fine actor he was. That said, this movie lacks the visual style and sense of bloody menace that other films of this ilk and time (Bonnie and Clyde, Sam Peckinpah's ouevre) were managing to bring to the table. Instead, the film has a brightly-lit look, and the actors have a pretty sweatiness about them that is almost more Calvin Klein ad than gritty prison film. The story is intriguing only in how all the other inmates of the honour farm vest their hopes for salvation from oppression in the vessel of rebellious ""Cool Hand"" Luke, a charming non-conformist who, in the film's imagery and a closing, unanswered prayer to god, is almost likened to Jesus. Cool Hand Luke is a fine entertainment but far from a great film.",1246233600,2,1059,4.520833333333333

Here, Luke becomes a part of the Chain Gang, but he is not your typical member. He refuses to be a part of this whole establishment that would force him to submit and surrender. Not only is Newman spectacular here, but the rest of the cast pull it off nicely. George Kennedy gives an unforgettable performance as Dragline, who slowly supports Luke during the film. Strother Martin is compelling, even humorous, as the Captain. He is the one who says ""What we have here is . . . failure to communicate."" That quote has become one of the most memorable of all time, and has been referenced and parodied in many films and TV shows. Jo Van Fleet as Luke's mother is something to look forward to: she sees what her son has become, but still knows that she has done the best for him. And finally, a young Dennis Hopper as Babalugats is minor, but it's a treat for those who admire the actor.

93692,5,0790733919,"One of Paul Newman's best performances, and truly one of his best films (I still don't know why I didn't nominate this in Best Picture for my personal awards); `Cool Hand Luke' is not only very, very cool; it is very, very impressive.  With powerful acting and one of the most poignant and powerfully moving endings of it's time, `Cool Hand Luke' is not just a staple for avid Newman fans, but this is a film for anyone who loves film; period.

Paul Newman plays Luke, a rebellious young man doing some time for vandalism.  He's strong willed and very independent, qualities that don't mesh well with prison life.  He knocks heads with a few people, not the least of which is the Captain (a ruthless Strother Martin) and Dragline (Oscar winner George Kennedy).  Dragline and Captain are determined to break Luke, but for different reasons and in different ways.  Dragline, the prisons gang leader, wants to break Luke into submission, but soon he begins to admire Luke's unwavering pride.  The Captain wants to humiliate and destroy Luke (that midnight digging scene sends chills down my spine EVERY time I watch this movie).

The films ending is really where the heart of the film lies, and where the characters that have been being developed become full and real and most impressionable.  I won't even get into the ending (I am not going to ruin this for anyone) but just know that Luke's final decision rings so true, even today.

It's a pure and brutally honest depiction of our subconscious yearnings.

The acting is a huge highlight here, and Paul Newman further cements himself as one of the finest actors to ever work in Hollywood (I've been known to confess him as my favorite actor of all time).  What he does with Luke is marvelous; constructing a man who is self inflicted with feelings he refuses to share, reserving himself until the end when his true afflictions are made bare.  Newman creates a perfect faade for Luke, a faux sense of security, which only adds to his eventual breakdown.  George Kennedy was amazing as Dragline, a truly inspired performance.  He's witty when needed, gruff when needed and even charming (he is the true definition of `buddy' here).  A lot of people have knocked his Oscar win in the years that followed it, but he was truly deserving (even if I would have given the award to Hackman).  I also want to point out Strother Martin for his devilish performance, truly spine chilling.

So, like I said, this is a marvelous film and is one that I highly recommend to any and everyone I talk to.  I'm so glad my father ranted and raved about this long enough for me to finally commit to watching it (that Paul Newman TCM marathon didn't help either) and so, in like manner, I plan on ranting and raving this film until you see it too!",1239148800,,2775,4.626530612244898
93693,5,0790733919,"First of all, I found the Amazon.com Editorial Review to be quite silly, appealing apparently to those who are totally unfamiliar w/the 60s but yet familiar w/the 70s. Movie critics have recently voted Cool Hand Luke as ""One of the Finest movies ever made."" And it does deserve that standing. It and it alone--yes over ""The Graduate"", a fine 60s film in its own right, but not definitive--can serve as an excellent defiition of the 60s.

People constantly refer to Newman's character ""Luke"" as a ""rebel"". Yet this characterization reflects our society's actual fear of defying authority in itself. Luke isn't a 'rebel'. He's perfectly willing to follow sensible, reasonale orders and just 'get along'. What he doesn't abide is Abuse of authority. He didn't rebel against authority for it's own sake. He refuses to accept Injustice, if even on the most minor levels--injustices we know well and all(?) routinely accept as if we're powerless. By accepting them we become sheep easily led to slaughter, for acceptance of minor abuses quickly leads to, and indicates the certainty of underlying, serious intolerable abuses (ala George W. Bush & Nixon). To paraphrase the guard upset on hearing Luke's supposed disbelief in G/god: 'I've worked this chain gang for nearly 30 year and I ain't killed me no white man....Sorry Luke but I'm just doin' my job."" ""Callin it your job don't make it right, Boss"", replies Luke.

Luke not only takes on the prison institution, leaders and guards, but also the chain gang's self-appointed 'Boss' prisoner 'Dragline' (George Kennedy). Here the film argues for a more egalitarian society: They are, after all, prisoners, every one. Questioning Dragline's authority, results in a boxing match Luke knows he'll loose. But he fight anyway, is beaten badly, yet won't ""stay down"" as warned. Luke replies, ""you're gonna have to kill me first.""  By being beaten but refusing to give up he wins the fight and everyone's respect. The warden recognizes Luke's righteousness resistance as trouble to come. Later, after being seriuosly wronged by the warden in the opinion of all, Luke never gives up trying to escape.

The movie takes up a third overarching issue of belief, or lack of belief, in God & in combination implies Luke's 'rebeliousness' stems from his 'non-belief'. Made in the time of the infamous ""God is Dead"" headline and the ""anti-hero"", both strong players explored here with much religious symbolism, the film is just as relevant today as 40+ years ago. Does Luke actually not believe in God? Or is it those who don't really think for themselves who are 'guilty'? Some may feel as if Luke's character feels ""the world owed him something"", as individualists (rebels?) are often pegged. Perhaps Luke feels unquestioned belief in God leads to acceptance of abuse (""..I ain't killed no white man."") when all 'follow the leader'. The aftermath of the escape scenes lead to a much-needed review of the morality of torture (ocurring everyday in our prisons).

This film is a powerful call to acccept and follow the idealism inherent in America's founding principles of freedom: Be a true individual. Think for yourself. Stand up and fight for what you believe no matter what the odds, consequences or opponents (even God?). This is a movie that will make you think. I saw it as a teen in 67 and it helped change my life. Society is again in great need of hearing it's message.

Thought-provoking and profound, with excellent, sometimes experimental cinematography and a brilliant screenplay deserving of an Oscar itself (it and the novel both written by a former chain gang member), an all-star ensemble supporting cast and the seamless Oscar-deserving performances of Newman and Kennedy, it will stand for all times as one of the best and most important movies ever made.

93695,4,0790733919,"Originally released in the cinema in late 1967, like most people, I came across the fantastic ""Cool Hand Luke"" on a piddly little television set at home, sometime in the mid Seventies. And like most folk, I've loved it and its indomitable spirit ever since.

Fast-forward to September 2008, and it arrives on the shiny new Blu Ray format - and to see it all cleaned up and pucker like this - and on a juicy big plasma screen too - is a treat few movie fans will be able to resist.

As close to 'beautiful' as a man could get, Newman shone from the second he smiled in the opening credits. The rest of the cast too were just fantastic - it's almost a case of spot the famous face now - Harry Dean Stanton and the young Dennis Hopper in early roles, George Kennedy in probably his best part, Strother Martin, JD Cannon, Lou Antonio, Joe Don Baker...the list is endless...and all of it with a top screenplay by DONN PEARCE and FRANK PIERSON and complimented by a cool LALO SCHIFFRIN soundtrack.

But the real treat for lifetime fans of the film is the PRINT. From the moment you see the red steel ""violation"" sign fill the screen as a drunk Lucas Jackson chops the head off yet another parking meter in his hick home town with a steel cutter, you know this print has been seen to properly - and I mean properly - it's absolutely gorgeous to look at.

Most of the action takes place in the blistering heat of a Florida prison and its daily work details, so there's a sort of heat haze over every outdoor shot, but the clarity of the restored print is still fantastic. When some of the prisoners are going through the compounds gates - beautifully clear. Paul Newman as he lays on his top bunk before the 8pm curfew looking at a bare light bulb just inches away...again so clean...

And then there's the film itself...there are so many great scenes:
...the full-on sex-kitten JOY HARMON (27 at the time, but looking more like 20) washing the car in that clinging floral dress while the boys sweat nearby digging a trench in the road (""I'm dying here..."") is probably one of the sexiest and most delicious scenes ever put to film (George Kennedy calls her Lucille).  Strother Martin's famous lines about ""communication"" when one of the prisoners gets shirty, the mirror shades of ""Boss"" reflecting everything from the birds he shoots to approaching trucks, the boisterous and loaded card games, the egg-eating contest, hiding out in the chapel at the end of the film as 'boss man' comes after Lucas...George Kennedy dying inside as the spirit of his new friend is close to being broken, but doesn't break (Kennedy won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Role)...all of it brill...and like its title...effortlessly cool.

There's a ""Making Of"" and Audio Commentary (not on some rental versions) and the subtitles are in French and Spanish only.

""Cool Hand Luke"" on Blu Ray is a triumph. What we have here is not a failure to communicate, but a great version of a great movie.

The movie is funny, sad, poignant, rebellious, and somewhat inspiring in terms of what the human spirit is capable of. With that said, Newman's character is made heroic for all the wrong reasons. He has no respect for authority and has clearly squandered his opportunities in life and what was apparently a successful military career. Lines like ""night in the box"" and ""failure to communicate"" still resonate in common venacular 40 years later. Viewers will also never see boiled eggs quite the same.",1225324800,,989,4.5307262569832405
93727,5,0790733919,"I remember this film vividly because when I first saw it, it was at a cinema in Paris--and this was my first time in the City of Light!!  Also I was on my 3 day leave from the Air Force and when I saw that famous scene when warden Strother Martin beat Luke (Newman) after he says, ""Boss, why are you so nice to me?"" to which Martin utters the famous lines, ""What we have here is a failure--to communicate"", it rang in my ears as an ironic twist to my days in Basic training. The late Paul Newman, who died just this last Friday, the 26 of September, lived and died like his character, Luke, in defiance but always smiling.  His defiance was in what people had pegged him for--the handsome movie star with beautiful blue eyes with a classical face.  Instead he channeled  this defiance into helping other less fortunate people than he was---the terminally ill children (the Hole in the Wall), relief funds for the people in the Gulf, various charities, etc.  Also he lived away from Hollywood, in Connecticut where he and his family were just folks. But another reason I've seen this movie countless times is because it was shot near my hometown of Stockton, California---those crossroads in the film sure remind of the Valley.  This film could stand as perhaps the best or if not one of the best, a great film in the Newman catalog--it pre-dated other rebel films like ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" and ""Dog Day Afternoon"" by almost a decade.  If one could chose one film that is indicative of Paul Newman--this is it!!",1222732800,4,1523,4.516363636363637

93760,5,0790733919,"Over the years, this film has become one of the most poular and widely viewed films of all time.  It is one of those rare films that is both immensely entertaining and accessible, and also takes on the ""big"" questions of life in an effective way.  If anything, it has been underappreciated by critics.

Released in 1967, this film could almost be seen as the first example of ""70's"" cinema, a film that succeeds in being artistic in all of the best senses of the word.  It famously addresses both the question of the place of the individual in modern society, and humanity's relationship to God, and does so in a deeply intelligent and endlessly thought-provoking way.  And yet, it never comes off as even remotely pretentious and can be enjoyed by just about anyone as simply a good piece of entertainment.

The character of Luke is very much like the character R.P. McMurphy as portrayed by Jack Nicholson in Ken Kesey's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.  Both are decorated war heroes and rebels who have their freedom taken away by the system over petty offenses against society.  Both are fun-loving jokers who possess incredible levels of inner strength and determination.  Both decide to take on the system in a deadly battle of wills with sinister, repressive authority figures.  And both end up as Christ figures, giving up their own lives, but inspiring the men around them, giving them back a sense of hope and meaning in life.  ""Cuckoo's Nest"" swept the Oscars in 1976, but ""Cool Hand Luke"" didn't receive its due in 1967, and its genius continues to get short shrift.  Newman's portrayal of Luke as envisioned by director Stuart Rosenberg is actually more interesting than Nicholson's portrayal of McMurphy in ""Cuckoo's Nest"".  McMurphy is a comic, charismatic force of nature, but he has little inner life.  Luke, however, is fascinating as an individual who has so many gifts, but whose life is caught in a downward spiral of self-destruction.  He is an individual who can do anything that he wants to do, and yet can't find it in himself to care about anything enough to do anything other than laugh and rebel, because he can see no ultimate meaning in life.  He is conflicted to the very end, searching for God and for meaning but unable to find either.  The best that he can do is find what peace he can through resignation and detachment, ""laughing it up"" the best that he can.  Luke is one of the most philosophical characters in one of the most philosophical films ever brought to the screen.  You learn something about life just by watching it, if you look for it.

In addition to all of this, the direction and cinematography of this film are both original and flawless.  The cast is one of the best ever assembled on film.  The music is a perfect fit for the storyline.  The script contains some of the most quoted and quotable dialogue ever written, and a collection of unforgettable scenes.  The new, deluxe edition is highly recommeded even for fans who already have the film, as it contains a very entertaining documentary piece about the making of the film, and a very interesting and thought-provoking ""commentary"" study of it as well.

It simply doesn't get any better than this.",1221955200,6,3209,4.718132854578097

93762,5,0790733919,"I don't view ""Cool Hand Luke"" as an indictment of our penal system.  Rather, it's an allegory about senseless systemic control over a compliant underclass.  Most of the prisoners in the work prison are there for such minor offenses such as passing bad checks or in the case of Luke(Paul Newman) destroying parking meters while in a drunken state. The keepers at the prison resort their charges to demeaning degradation like having them ask permission to swat a fly otherwise it's a night in the sweatbox.  Along comes Luke to flaunt the authority and become a folk hero to the other inmates.  However, once his mother passes Luke's anti-authoritarian streak developes a purpose and the system becomes more sadistic to set an example to the other inmates about crossing the line.  This is one of Newman's many landmark performances.  The look on his face when he delivers his final line says volumes.  George Kennedy deservedly took home the Oscar as Luke's initial adversary and finally his acolyte.  Though his screen time is short Strother Martin as the Captain leaves an indelible impact on the film.  His fey delivery of his now renowned failure to communicate line leaves a chill in your bones.  Lot's of good actors on hand here though, oddly enough, Dennis Hopper doesn't leave much of a mark.  An unqualified classic.",1221350400,,1325,4.896860986547085

Stuart Rosenberg's direction is assured; as is the script by Donn Pearce and Frank Pierson (""Dog Day Afternoon"") The highlights include Strother Martin's ""failure to communicate"" speech, Harry Dean Stanton singing ""The Midnight Special"", the, um, car wash scene and of course George Kennedy's Academy Award-winning supporting role.

93764,5,0790733919,"This is a new Deluxe Edition of Cool Hand Luke, with new special features.  There will be a making-of featurette called ""A Natural-Born World-Shaker: Making Cool Hand Luke,"" which the press release describes as ""an in-depth look at the creation of an uncompromising classic.""  There will also be an audio commentary with Paul Newman biographer Eric Lax, and the theatrical trailer.  Only the theatrical trailer and some text production notes are on the old DVD.  There will also be a Blu-ray version.

Cool Hand Luke is the story of a man (Newman) who, by a minor offense combined with stubborn if at times casually guided will, gets himself into increasingly deep trouble in a tough Southern prison.  It's played as part comedy, part gritty drama.  Luke's cool, fearless, devil-may-care attitude and escapades make him an icon among his fellow prisoners, until he is brought to abject desperation, ultimately rising again and falling to become a legend.

The film is famous for a hard-boiled egg eating contest and, especially, a quote that has entered the pantheon of movie quotes: ""What we have here is a failure to communicate.""  The title character's nickname comes from another quote, made after he bluffs to win at poker: ""sometimes nothin' can be a real cool hand,"" a quote that has ironic punch in the context of the movie as a whole.  Newman was nominated for an Oscar, and George Kennedy won one for his supporting role.  Strother Martin is unforgettable as the twisted prison captain.

I enjoy this movie, but I've never completely loved it the way many do.  Parts of it never seemed quite real to me (not ""uncompromising"" either), not with the truthful feel the similarly themed One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest has, for example.

93766,5,0790733919,"Paul Newman stars as Luke along with a marvellous cast in a prison gang film set in the deep south. Luke is a former war hero who when very drunk one night starts damaging parking meters (the very beginning of the film) and ends up serving time. Although apparently a very laid back character, the death of his mother changes Luke's attitude and the film hinges on this critical moment.

I've always enjoyed the film in the past on TV, but was too young to have seen it at the cinema first time round. So to see it now on DVD, in widescreen, on a large TV only emphasised just how good it really is. There are many classic scenes, the most famous of which is the car wash (for the men anyway), and the attempt to eat 50 boiled eggs. Quite a few others will leave an impression on you as well.

Its Newmans film all the way but George Kennedy (also still alive at the time of writing) pushes him close as 'dragline' in the acting honours. Also listen out for Lalo Schifrin's (Jazz Pianist and Film/TV Score writer - most famously Mission Impossible) superbly atmospheric music as well.

Paul Newman plays Luke.  A perennial loser who seems to have no purpose in Life since winning several medals in World War II.  In the beginning of the movie Luke wanders aimlessly down a street cutting the ""heads"" off of parking meters and keeping some of the ""heads"" for the few coins in them.

Why he was cutting the heads off parking meters]
Luke: Small town, not much to do in the evenin'.

 (This very same thing happened in Atlanta, Georgia last summer and nobody would tell the police who was doing it.  Obviously someone had watched the movie.)

George Kennedy won Best-Supporting Actor Oscar as ""Dragline"", bull of the herd of prisoners. Dragline leads the group, running gambling and the small barracks ""bank"", and all the other prisoners follow his example and look to him as the source of what little self-respect they have.

My favorite line in this movie is when Luke has tried to escape and has been beaten senseless  the warden stands over his bruised body and says

""What we have here, is a failure to communicate.""

Luke is a nonconformist which doesn't bode well for him in prison, a place that demands conformity to the rules. Luke evolves into a position of respect among the inmates, they look upon him as a leader though it's a role he doesn't want. He's constantly bucking the system which keeps him in trouble with the warden & guards. Things get worse after a successful escape & subsequent recapture. The warden & guards try to break Luke's spirit which they aren't very successful at. Luke finally tries another escape which leads to his demise.

The movie has several defining moments in it; there's the egg eating scene where Luke eats fifty boiled eggs in one hour, there's the scene where the warden (Strother Martin) makes his famous speech: ""What we have here... is a failure to communicate..."" & the scene where, apparently, Luke's spirit is broken. The acting in this movie is outstanding elicited by the director Stuart Rosenberg who wasn't & never will be one of Hollywood's better known directors.

There are many now famous actors in this movie with varying degrees of substantial roles. George Kennedy won  a very deserving Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for his role. Also in the movie are Morgan Woodward (Sunglasses) in  a featured yet non-speaking role, Harry Dean Stanton, Dennis Hopper, J.D.

My dad, my brother, and I quoted from it all the time. Even today, I can break into a Strother Martin impersonation (""When a man's mother dies...."") that gets my dad laughing. Simply put, this is just about a perfect movie. It contains the classic eating of 50 eggs scene (where, if you didn't get the Jesus symbolism by then, is made pretty obvious). But the car washing scene is pretty classic, too (even if the woman looks more ""60s"" than the rest of the movie). The script is fantastic, the locations are evocative of the time and place, and the actors all put in great performances. George Kennedy won an Oscar for his turn as the prison fixture, Dragline; and unfortunately, they don't make them like Strother Martin (dead) and Harry Dean Stanton (still acting) anymore. The cast is so good that Joe Don Baker and Dennis Hopper appear, though only on the margins. And as for this movie's star, well, Paul Newman gives his best performance as Luke, who epitomizes the American rebel. Think James Dean goes to prison and you have Cool Hand Luke. It's hard to believe Newman was around 40 when he made this movie. He looks a lot younger. The book the movie is based on was written by an ex-con safecracker, who had served time on a chain gang. The movie certainly has authenticity (even though it was filmed in Stockton, California, not the Deep South).

God knows I must have viewed this one at least a dozen times now.  The acting, directing, writing, score, etc... is top notch.  Am I the only person out there who constantly poses this question - WHY DONT THEY MAKE FILMS LIKE THIS ANYMORE?  Then again, there has never been, nor will there ever be, an actor quite like Paul Newman.  And if ever there was a role in which Newman was born to play, this was it!  Seriously folks, could you even imagine another actor playing the part of Luke?  It's definitely one of his finest performances ever.  The man has charm oozing out of every pore in his body.

Along with the outstanding, understated work of Mr. Newman, this film also contains several wonderful performances by a fine supporting cast - George Kennedy (Best Supporting Actor Winner as Dragline), Strother Martin, Robert Donner, Morgan Woodward, Wayne Rogers, Ralph Waite, Harry Dean Stanton, Dennis Hopper and Jo Van Fleet as Luke's mother Arletta.  By the way, the scene in which Luke confronts his dying mother Arletta is one of my favorites of all-time.  It redefines the word POIGNANT and I can almost guaranty it will melt your heart.

The three established rebel/anti-heroes in movies were Paul Newman, Warren Beatty, and Steve McQueen...

In 1967, screen audiences were exposed to two new rebel hero characters, Clyde Barrow, a rebel without a cause with enough guts to strike out against any bank, and Luke Jackson, an anti-hero 'born to lose,' but a man full of pride and dignity...

""Cool Hand Luke"" resumes Newman's career as another rebel, a non-conformist, a perfect hero who beats the system wherever...

Superbly directed by Stuart Rosenberg, Newman exhibits a complete arrangement of emotions invading every nuance and implication... Resources of his true command of his technical acting are breathtaking in their impact... The motion picture (nominated for 4 Academy Awards) won him his 4th Academy Award nomination...

Newman is again a cynical loner, but he's also charming, and everything is calculated to involve us with him; like ""Hombre,"" the film begins and ends with closeups of his face, but here, appropriately, he has an engaging smile...

The opening, where he drinks beer, unscrews tops from parking meters and mumbles to the arriving cop, recalls Dean's drunken incoherence at the start of ""Rebel Without a Cause""--an apt title for Luke... He breaks rules for no apparent reason, wherever he is, including the chain gang to which he's sentenced...

Unlike Paul Muni in ""I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang,"" who steals only to eat and is turned by society into a hardened criminal, Luke is a criminal from the start, and his crime isn't motivated by hunger... It's a meaningless anti-authority gesture--the existentialist ""gratuitous act,"" committed purely for the sake of committing it... Luke engages our sympathy not because he is economically deprived or the product of an unhappy home, but because for him the act of rebellion is its own justification: he's the perfect sixties hero...

Initially, Luke alienates the prisoners by his indifference and sarcasm, and the top dog, Dragline (George Kennedy) picks a fight with him... Luke is severely beaten but keeps fighting, and this--plus his continual defiance of the guards--wins him the men's respect... Their admiration grows when he proves he can eat 50 hard-boiled eggs, one after the other, in only one hour, another gratuitous act (""somethin' to do"").

But Luke gradually becomes a victim of the excessive admiration, rebelling because they expect him to, which leads to a pattern of escapes and captures... As the warden says, ""What we got here is a failure to communicate. Some men you just can't reach."" Even though Luke becomes subservient after torture, he again escapes... Dragline admires the way he fooled the guards while planning all along to escape... But Luke says he really did break down, and asserts: ""l never planned anything in my life."" Even his last act is motivated not by heroism but by impulse...

The physical punishment Newman's characters often undergo reaches an extreme here, as Luke constantly invites pain (in his fight with Dragline, he says, ""You're gonna have to kill me.""). Underlying his sometimes vigorous rebelliousness is despair at a cruelly indifferent world... But the men need a hero, and Dragline perpetuates the myth, telling them that he had ""that Luke smile"" to the very end... We last see a montage of shots of Luke smiling--the men's vision of him as unbeaten and almost immortal...

Newman's performance is among his best, and Luke is one of his definitive studies of non conformism... As in ""Hombre,"" he underplays, but in a loose, relaxed, ""cool"" manner... He's affecting in a wide range of moods: quiet detachment, wry contempt, raw courage, exhaustion, exuberance, gentleness, anger, resignation...

There's a superb1y understated scene in which Luke's dying mother (Jo Van Fleet) visits him... Like Rocky Graziano, he says he tried to live cleanly, but could never find a way... But the mood is quite different here: instead of intense emotion, there are on1y ingenious expressions of uneasiness, regret, sadness, acceptance... Newman conveys his unspoken affection entirely through his glances and reactions, as she wistfully remarks that she once had high hopes for him...

The actor even survives the film's pretentious attempts to make him a mock-Christ figure... Besides the obvious sacrifice-resurrection parallel, he's even shown in the exact crucifixion position following his fifty-egg (Last Supper?) ordeal... There are two badly conceived dialogs with a God he doesn't believe in--after which he realizes, ""l gotta find my own way,"" a rather unconcealed statement of existential despair--but Newman performs them with quiet conviction....

His mock religion is better suggested by the bottle opener he wears in lieu of a religious medal... And the despair is effectively dramatized in his reaction to his mother's death... The men leave him by himself, and he sits on his bed, playing the banjo... With a sad, breaking voice, he sings a religious parody: ""l don't care if it rains or freezes, long as 1 got my plastic Jesus..."" He looks down and begins crying, but sings faster, obsessively, withdrawing into himself and expressing his utter loneliness in a world that has no God... It's one of the most moving scenes in all of Newman's work...

Paralleled to ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"" ""Cool Hand Luke"" is a character study, which works beautifully, very well-made with sense of graphic imagery and cinema view, a good-looking film with superb photography in Color, extremely good as an entertainment...",1166832000,4,5698,5.191721132897603

Everything worked together perfectly in this movie; A marvelous directing job by Stuart Rosenberg, terrific contemporary soundtrack by Lalo Schifrin and and ensemble cast to die for. There are so many well known faces in this film and so many great, quotable lines you'll never forget.

Newman plays the recently incarcerated Luke. Assigned to a chain gang to serve out a relatively short sentence for cutting the heads off parking meters, his non conformist ways earn the respect of the other inmates and the hatred of the guards and captain.

What makes 'Cool Hand Luke' so memorable is the fact that it's a story within a story. On the one hand you have a mundane prison tale of a group of societal misfits serving time for their various indisgressions. However on a deeper level you have a Messianic parody with Luke as the Christ. As the inmates embrace him as their ""Chosen One"" the guards seek to destroy him for disturbing the established order. A great film on so many levels. For those who like to read into the story, or for those who are just looking for a little entertainment.

George Kennedy received a well deserved Oscar for his supporting role, but it really should have won many more. Newman is magnificent and Martin Strother once again proves himself to be one of the greatest character actors of his generation. A near perfect film.

But if you are to analyze this movie objectively, I think you'd agree that it pretty much sucks.  I know you're thinking: ""What?!?  How can anyone say anything so outrageous!  It's a *classic*!""  Hear me out.

First, Newman isn't very believable.  It's not just that he's too good-looking to be on a chain gang.  It's not that he's a lousy actor.  He's not, he's a great actor.  It's just that in this movie his acting is lousy.  Think of the scene where Luke is broken by the guard after digging a hole and being beaten.  Even a high school drama teacher would blush at that kind of overacting.  It's embarrassing.

Another annoying thing is the stage play (placement of actors within the shot).  The movie was done in the style that I thought had died out by 1967, but apparently hadn't.  It's a stagey, overly-dramatic style that kills any verisimilitude (it's also the sole problem I have with ""The Searchers"").  A group of people are lined up on one side of the screen while observing the action on the other side.  It's very unrealistic.  After seeing this in the jailhouse among the inmates three of four times, I began to expect at any moment that the other inmates, being grouped together like that, would burst into a rendition of ""New York, New York, it's a Helluva Town!""

I also didn't like Newman's character.  I know that a movie like this needs to be understood within its own cultural milieu, and 1967 was a very turbulent time, with lots of people feeling good about fighting the Pow-uh in a lot of really stupid ways.  But stupid acts of public destruction are just that, not the archetype of an individual's struggle against the Man.

And heavy handed.  Jeez.  Lying him out on a table like he's been crucified?  Dressing in white?  Could you *be* more obvious?

Overall, a really obnoxious, poorly-executed and shallow presentation on a number of levels.  By the end of the movie, I was cheering for the guard with the mirrored glasses to put an end to both Luke's misery and my own.",1143417600,21,2100,4.554959785522788

The admirable epic vein, expressed as bold courage, the seminal resistance forged by the most abominable infra human conditions, would experience a certain delay in the Fifties due, perhaps the wounds were too recent to allow the soul, the memory and the artistic vein could describe with demolishing realism the unsaid horrors.

Cold hand Luke expresses, precisely this admirable condition of the human being; when a man is submitted to the most abject and repulsive conditions. Paul Newman gave one of his most arresting performances in the screen (after The Hustler, to my mind) and George Kennedy is splendid too with this fabulous script.

Two additional films in that decade, would make to ignite the stage around this subject: Sidney Lumet ` s The Hill and Artur Penn ` s Little big man.

It is one of the first anti-hero movies, a reaction to the cotton-candy goodness of movies during the 1950's and the McCarthy era.  It was made as the studio system was crumbling and more and more directors were being influenced by European cinema.

Newman is absolutely at the top of his game as Luke, a war hero turned petty criminal who is sent off to a Southern prison camp.  Full of religious symbolism and themes, this drama shows the strength of man and his relationship to God.  This is the type of movie that gets under your skin and stays there.

93890,5,0790733919,"A poignant exploration of Man and his relationship to God, ""Cool Hand Luke"" is also an excellent, entertaining movie. Paul Newman is at his peak both physically and as an actor portraying Luke Jackson, a man who is at odds with the authoritarian structure of life in general. Once a decorated war hero, he finds himself on a chain gang as punishment for his ill-advised revenge (beheading parking meters). Luke was obviously the hope of his family, and was the apple of his mother's eye. The story is set fully into motion when his beloved mother dies and Luke is denied leave to attend her funeral. This last act of arbitrary authoritarian heavy-handedness crystallizes in Luke the final desire to resist The Boss even if it kills him.

The movie is beautiful to look at. It is entertaining to play ""spot the future star"" during the prison barracks scenes (look fast for Dennis Hopper and Wayne Rogers). However, the movie eventually becomes a thoughtful exploration of what it means to be a Christ-figure, and what it means to feel abandoned by your god. The final traffic light winks to red and you know that Luke was just ""standin' in the rain talkin' to myself"". That's an idea worth thinking about no matter what your religious convictions.

Newman plays a Southern convict and loner who specializes in putting up a front with his fellow inmates and prison guards. His strong will, humor, and smile make him such a likable character. Even though the time period is set in the 1940s, one may feel that he/she is viewing a 1960s presentation due to its camera transition scenes, music, and themes of the time period (post-World War II {Vietnam for the 1960s} and lack of communication between people).

93893,5,0790733919,"Paul Newman portrays Lucas Jackson, an iconic film anti-hero, in this classic film.

Luke seems to have wandered aimlessly after winning several medals in WWII, and in the beginning of the film he's arrested for ""maliciously destroying municipal property"" - using a pipe cutter to cut the heads off of parking meters.

The film has little exposition and in the next scene plunges our anti-hero in the middle of Division of Corrections, Road Prison 36, in the south.  Strother Martin plays the ""Cap'n"", the warden of this group, and Luke is instructed that all the other guards are to be called ""Boss"".  The bosses are frighteningly sadistic. Morgan Woodward is terrifying as ""the man with no eyes"". He speaks no words from behind his mirror sunglasses, but has a rifle brought to him every so often so that he can demonstrate his sharp-shooter accuracy.

George Kennedy won Best-Supporting Actor Oscar as ""Dragline"", bull of the herd of prisoners.  Dragline leads the group,  running gambling and the small barracks ""bank"", and all the other prisoners follow his example and look to him as the source of what little self-respect they have.

Luke and Dragline knock heads, figuratively and later on, literally, when Dragline beats Luke nearly unconscious in a brawling boxing match.  Dragline and the other prisoners live a pretty vivid fantasy life.  They blow-up the smallest slivver of hope into a bright shining ray of hope.  In a famous scene the prisoners are working just down the road from a beautiful blonde who stretches and teases and caresses the car she is washing with a soaped up sponge (this scene has been copied many times since in more juvenile films).  The other prisoners immediately attach themselves to the fantasy image of ""Lucille"".  She is just some innocent, beautiful girl who ""didn't know what she was doin'"" while she postured her curvy side for the men.  ""Oh, she knew what she was doing, and she loved every minute of it"", Luke states plainly, bursting the fantasy balloon of the other prisoners.  This leads to the famous boxing match with Dragline.

Luke is insolent and rebellious and talks back to the Bosses in a way the other prisoners wouldn't dare. He gradually earns the respect of the other prisoners, and one of the best scenes of the film occurs at a poker game where Dragline finally comes to respect Luke and gives him his nickname.

Luke doesn't want responsibility, even the responsibility of the admiration of the prisoners.  The film charms it's way under your skin, though, and it's very easy to lose the perspective that by the end you've spent the entire movie rooting for a man who by almost any other definition would be a loser.

93924,5,0790733919,"I've seen this movie many times and caught it on TV again this weekend, only reminding me what a classic it is, easily among the best of all time.

Paul Newman plays Luke, an unbreakable spirit trapped in a place, and among men, determined to break him.  That spirit, though, is as much his strength as it is his burden.  As the story progresses, the audience comes to identify, not so much with Luke himself, but with his prisonmates.  We're in silent awe of his guts when he won't stay down in the fight scene with George Kennedy, we root for him on the edge of our seats during the oft-referenced egg eating scene, we watch with pity as he digs and fills the ditch - the guards working him to the breaking point, and we cheer like mad as he takes off in the same guards' truck, shackles be damned.

It could easily be regarded as Newman's best acting.  I wouldn't disagree with that, but won't go that far myself only out of respect for his other all time great performances (e.g. The Hustler, Butch Cassidy, The Color of Money, The Verdict, and so on).

Also, as a ""prison movie"", as much as I hate to lump this classic into such a narrow sub-genre, it is by far the best I've seen and its influence on future films of that genre, the good ones and the bad ones (e.g. Escape From Alcatraz, The Shawshank Redemption, and so on), is blatantly obvious.

93925,4,0790733919,"Paul Newman plays Luke, a charismatic man stuck in a chain gang for breaking parking meters. The authority automatically has a problem with him for this petty crime and he spends the entire movie doing what he has done his whole life: being Cool Hand Luke. Cool Hand Luke does his manual labor with zeal and Cool Hand Luke takes insane bets. Cool Hand Luke doesn't give up. This is his one major flaw, because the authorities want to break Luke's spirit which cannot be broken. Herein lies the point of the film.

Sure, Luke is a rebel, but his failure to conform is not thrown at the audience as if it were a message. The events just happen; Luke just happens. This makes for a much more realistic movie and a much more likable character.

Luke could be compared to James Dean's character in Rebel Without a Cause, but that comparison would be flawed. Dean's character is much younger in age and in spirit. Luke has been hardened by age and experience; he was probably very similar to Dean's character in youth but has quieted down a bit. In consequence, Luke is less whiney and more to-the-point.

Cool Hand Luke is a popular film because the character is one that people can relate to and respect immensely. If anyone has known someone similar, one can relate to this statement. Luke is the type of person that everyone wants to be but often fails to become. Judging by the end of this film, maybe that isn't such a bad thing.",1126915200,,1429,4.4884615384615385

The critics I believe have underestimated his acting ability, probably in part because of his good looks. No one with eyes that blue can act too. Newman is cast here as the noncomformist Lucas Jackson who gets sent to prison for destroying parking meters while on a drinking rampage. Newman's egg-swallowing scene has become a classic, and the phrase ""what we're got here here is a failure to communicate"" has become part of our language. Newman really does a fine acting job here, even when he sings ""I don't care if it rains or freezes/As long as I've got my plastic Jesus,"" having just learned of the death of his mother.

My one complaint about the film is no fault of Newman's. The religious overtones get a little heavy-handed. For example, there is one frame where Luke is lying wearing only his shorts with his arms stretched out and one foot over the other in a classic crucifixion pose. Then there is the scene where he runs into a deserted church complete with a wooden cross on top of it and laments his fate in a loud voice.

Luke (Newman) was somehow in that situation he's become such a hero to the other prisoners that he can't disappoint them. Even when he told the truth about the fake photo and the final escape (you've got to watch it for context), they turn it into something that will support their ""hero"" fantasy. In short they're into the image and not the person. In Luke's darkest hour they all left him, somehow implying their shallow relationship.

 The character Luke is enigmatic, it's really hard to tell with certainty why he is the way he is. Paul Newman embodied the role perfectly, this might be his most beloved role of his career probably even more than Butch Cassidy and ""Fast"" Eddie Felson. Paul Newman exhibited great range as an actor, he got to be this really intense guy and then play the ""cool"" guy and then he's got  to be really quietly moving without making any big acting dramatics. He is truly one of the best actors.

 There are lots of great moments particularly the now famous and infamous ""egg-eating contest"". Or how about the numerous attempts of Luke to get out of jail and then eventually recaptured. The big fight between Dragline and Luke and then tragic finale of the film. There are so many great moments in this film and I just hope the DVD will be re-released.

At first, Luke is disliked by many of his fellow inmates, but with time he comes to earn their respect.  However, Luke is the rebellious type and refuses to be broken down by authority.  This is a great movie about a rebel who refuses to give in to authority no matter what the consequences.  Luke is somewhat of an outcast who has never fit in with the ""norm"" of society.  Cool Hand Luke is full of famous scenes/lines like the ""What we have here is a failure to communicate"" line or the eating 50 eggs in an hour scene, but overall the movie is about one's man refusal to live the norm.  Highly recommended if you have not seen it.

  Paul Newman gives one of his best performances as Lucas Jackson, a rebellious prisoner on a chain gang who refuses to give up or be beaten down by authority.  Newman's Luke is a man who struggles with the hand he has been dealt in life, and tries to overcome those problems.  George Kennedy won a Best Supporting Oscar for his role as Dragline, a fellow member of the chain gang who becomes Luke's friend.  Strother Martin is excellent as the Captain, the warden of the facility who delivers the ""communication"" line.  In a brief, one-scene part, Jo Van Fleet is perfect as Arletta, Luke's dying mother.  The chain gang is a huge list of character actors including JD Cannon, Lou Antonio, Robert Drivas, Harry Dean Stanton, Wayne Rogers, and a young Dennis Hopper.  The movie also stars Morgan Woodward as Boss Godfrey, ""No Eyes,"" Luke Askew, Anthony Zerbe, and Clifton James.

  This is a movie that deserves a 2-disc special edition DVD, not the lousy cardboard Warner Brothers version with no extras other than a trailer and widescreen presentation.  Moviegoers obviously love this movie so why isn't there a Special Edition DVD out there?  Still, this is a classic movie and a must-have overall, so don't let this DVD scare you away.",1112400000,4,2083,4.560646900269542

""What we have here is failure to communicate""

So says the captain about the inmate called ""Cool Hand Luke"" in the film of the same name. In the movie, Paul Newman plays a man who lives in a small town. He personifies the very individualistic mindset.

Having nothing to do and no friends, Luke (Newman) decides to do a little drinking while cutting the heads off of parking meters. When confronted by the police, Luke acts like he is drunk (either he is actually acting or he actually is drunk) and finds his way into prison .Once in prison, Luke joins a chain gang. All goes well and, despite a rough start, the inmates begin to like him. He even makes a friend in the form of Dragline, an illiterate man played by George Kennedy. Luke is just about to get out of the prison. Then fate deals him a bad hand.

Luke learns about his mother's death. In his sorrow, Luke breaks out of prison, only to be caught. He escapes again, only to be caught and beaten. Then, he takes a prison truck and escapes along with Dragline, only to be shot by a very accurate prison guard.

This film comments on society's treatment of the individual. In the beginning of the film, Luke's attitude equals the epitome of self sufficiency. He is a loner who considers rules and regulations, as he puts it in the scene with the famous ""Night in the Box"" speech, ""nothin' worth listenin' to."" As he lives on in the prison, his attitude of I don't need you frustrates the prison officials who try to get his ""mind right"" repeatedly. They take their dismay, and persist in doing this despite it's lack of effectiveness, to the point that they beat Luke. Luke fights them at every turn. They lie and beat him, showing this most sadistically in a scene where they tell Luke to get his dirt out of the captain's ditch. They make him get the dirt out, then complain about the unavoidable effect of having that dirt on the lawn when he is done. He has to put the dirt back in. Right after that, he is forced to take the dirt back out again. This cycle continues until Luke reaches the point where he lashes out in frustration, only to be beaten to the point where he falls into the ditch. He comes back out, wrapping his arms around the nearest guard, crying about how his mind is now right.

Then there is the climactic scene with Lukein a church. Dragline comes in and tries to get Luke to give up peaceably. Here, Dragline represents society's desire to get everyone to just mindlessly conform to its ways. Luke refuses, and ironically gets shot. This shooting is interesting if nothing else for the fact that the authorities not only have no reason to believe Luke is armed, but also for the fact that he gets shot for impersonating a prison official. Luke's soul has refused to conform to society's rules and ends up needing to get extinguished.

Thus, ""Cool Hand Luke"" becomes a comment on society. Luke dislikes the need of his fellow inmates to latch onto him so tightly. Luke dislikes rules, becoming a non-conformist. Society has constantly tried to extinguish the non-conformists. Examples include the Civil Rights Movement, the Feminist Movement, and the homosexuals. Like them, Luke is also a non-conformist. Like them, society clashes with Luke. Like them, society tries to kill Luke. Too bad society has not learned to deal with other people's views.",1110240000,9,3377,4.58112582781457
93954,5,0790733919,"I have just seen this movie again after many years. It is great to see Paul Newman at his best in a movie released in 1967 which was filmed about 38 years ago. This is one of the movies that made him so famous.

Luke is sent to prison into a chain gang for a petty crime. He finds himself in a very strict, brutal and crushing prison system. The story is about his incredible bravery as he tries in spirit and in actuality to battle back from being brutalized by the guards. In the end, he only makes it out of the prison in spirit. His prison escapes fail.",1105574400,,557,4.0636363636363635
93955,5,0790733919,"This is my favorite movie.  It is one of the ultimate male-defining movies of all time.  It has action, humor, tragedy, and drama.  It rings true (the writer had actually served time on a chain gang).  When, at the age of 12, I first saw this movie [particularly the fight in the yard scene], I realized that life isn't always an ""A"" or an ""F"".  Often a person rates at least a ""C"" if not an ""A"" just for trying.  In other words, one who puts forth real effort is deserving of respect whether or not they come out ""on top"" or ""first place"".  The 50 egg challenge is great.  The repeated ""fugitive"" pursuit scenes are well-done.  The different songs played and sung by Harry Dean Stanton are perfect.  The story is magnificent as are the many great lines: ""Still shakin' it, Boss!"" and ""What we got here is a failure to communicate."" With such a cast too!  Joe Don Baker, Ralph Waite, Wayne Rogers, Strother Martin, Dennis Hopper, and, of course, Paul Newman.  This movie inspired me and never fails to do so every time I view it again.",1105056000,5,1035,4.389473684210526
93956,5,0790733919,"Paul Newman is not an acting legend for nothing.  He has had so many spectacularly great roles and performances to his credit that it's hard to choose just one.  And one of his best has to have been COOL HAND LUKE, that classic 1967 prison drama that was one of the defining films of that turbulent time and helped cement Newman's reputation.

Based on the book of the same name by ex-con Don Pierson, who co-wrote the script with Frank Pierson and who has a cameo role here as a prisoner, the film stars Newman as an out-of-work drunk who is arrested in a small southern town for ""maliciously destroyin' municipal property while under the influence""--in other words, taking the heads off of dozens of parking meters.  This lands him a two-year sentence on a brutal chain gang, whose leader, named Dragline (George Kennedy, in an Oscar-winning performance), takes an almost instant dislike to him until he engages Newman in a boxing match in which Newman's Luke doesn't quit even when he's down.

Newman gains the respect of his fellow prisoners for his ""don't give a damn"" attitude; but he soon raises the ire of the prison guards, especially after his escape attempts.  After the first one, the head prison chief known as the Captain, played by Strother Martin, upbraids him with the line etched into Hollywood immortality: ""What we've got here is...failure to communicate.""

Just about the finest prison genre movie there has ever been, COOL HAND LUKE is directed in sterling fasion by Stuart Rosenberg, and features a perfect Americana score by Lalo Schifrin.  Alongside Newman and Kennedy are such future stars and character actors as Dennis Hopper, Ralph Waite, Harry Dean Stanton, Luke Askew, J.D. Cannon, Robert Donner, and Wayne Rogers.  Filmed almost completely on location in Stockton, California, and featuring many memorable scenes, including the famous egg-eating contest in which Newman consumes fifty eggs in 60 minutes, COOL HAND LUKE has lost none of its power in the thirty-seven years since its release, and is vigorously recommended, particularly alongside similar and more recent outings like THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and DEAD MAN WALKING.",1104364800,3,2161,5.047752808988764

93959,5,0790733919,"One of my favorite movies of the 1960's is ""Cool Hand Luke"" which, I believe, is an opinion I share with many others.  It was a different sort of a movie at a time when Hollywood specialized in different sorts of movies.  It took place in a Southern prison farm and it starred Paul Newman in the title role.  If he hadn't had a few other top-notch performances (""The Hustler"" quickly jumps to mind) this would easily be the pick as his all-time best.  He really is the personification of cool at a time we all thought we knew the real meaning of the term.

The story is a rather simple one; a two-time loser joins a bunch of others on a chain gang.  We soon discover the hierarchy of the group which includes the leader; Dragline (played by George Kennedy in an Oscar-winning role).  Luke isn't taken all that seriously until he makes an incredible boast and then proceeds to back it up.  He becomes king of the hill but, when personal tragedy strikes, he escapes the prison.  His noteriety grows in his absence but he is eventually caught and discovers just how hot Hell can be.  There's more to the story but the ending is a bittersweet one that needn't be spoiled for the first-time viewer.  The story I did relate isn't giving much away because this movie's greatness lies in the characters themselves; the story is just a way for us to get to know them better.

This is a movie that stays with you for a long time.  It's one that most of us who saw it once have seen it a number of other times as well.  It may seem odd at times to find ourselves endeared to a bunch of petty criminals but that is inescapable when watching ""Cool Hand Luke"".  The big line in the movie is, ""What we have here is failure to communicate"".  However, the movie ""Cool Hand Luke"" is anything BUT a failure to communicate.

Strother Martin as the short, evil, sadistic Chain Gang Captain drawls, ""What we've here...is a failure to communicate."" Then he starts beating up the prisoners. There is a certain hilarious black humour about this unforgettable scene. Luke is named for his coolness when he wins a cool hand of poker and he sets the standard for all the would-be ""Cool"" heroes that have come after him. Perhaps only Sean Connery as James Bond 007 can match his never say die attitude against all odds. It always brings to mind my favourite song that dates from 1170 called ""Die Gedanken sind frei"". It means in German; your thoughts are always free so no matter what happens and what adversity you have to undergo, no one can get inside your head for your thoughts will always be free!

93962,5,0790733919,"One of the reasons that the late 60s/early 70s was such a powerful era in filmmaking is the emergence of the anti-hero (defined as an individual with heroic qualities, but not in a position we would usually find a hero). This is symbolized greatly in `Cool Hand Luke'. We can identify with Luke because his crime is venial and his concerns over the great questions of life are ours. It is because of this and his persuasive charm that the other prisoners (played remarkably well by Kennedy and a host of others to include Wayne Rogers, Ralph Waite, Dennis Hopper and one of the actors who played a crewmember on `Alien') live vicariously through him.

Filled with memorable scenes (the boxing match, 50 eggs, the fealty of his fellow prisoners who help him finish his food after his stomach is shrunk in solitary confinement, `shakin' it here boss', the sneezing dogs, and of course the carwash) and outstanding character development (created by what is said and what is not said, i.e. the visiting brother), one of screen history's most repeated lines and the great acting of Newman, this movie deserves to be called a classic. Released the same year as `Bonnie and Clyde', it makes one long for the days when you needed a real script to make a movie.",1091664000,4,1252,4.6909090909090905
93963,5,0790733919,"This is the perfect `60s movie.  It is anti-authoritarian without being strident, a serious drama with whimsy, gritty and violent with a sexy side (who can forget the car wash scene?).  Newman plays the ""christ"" figure and his prisoners as his disciples and believers (after he wins them over).  The guards and the warden are the high priests and the Romans.  And of course, they kill him in the end.
But we have some great fun along the way.  Luke strips the heads off of a street of parking meters and gets a sentence far out of proportion to such a silly crime.  To say that Luke chooses not to fit in is an understatement.  It isn't that he takes on the system. Rather, his mere presence and indifference to the system causes it to change or to try and eliminate him as if he were some invading virus.
There are some wonderful and indelible scenes such as the egg eating, the fight with Dragline (George Kennedy), the race to the end of the road, the failure to communicate scene and the severe punishment Luke receives.  It seems like you can sit around talking about scenes from this movie longer than the movie itself.
Paul Newman made Luke immortal, but George Kennedy as Dragline and Strother Martin as Captain are also essential to this movie's character and permanence.
Today's viewers might fine the pacing of the movie a bit slow and see some seams that those of us who love it might ignore, but so what?  It is a classic and enjoyable film that is a touchstone for many who were young when they first saw it in 1967.",1086393600,3,1530,4.455197132616488

the main boss hates luke for several reasons: everyone likes luke. he is the typical rebel , yet he has a certain aura around that people love. even the people working in the prison like luke.  the boss also hates luke, because he keeps escaping out of prison, which makes the prison's security and himself look bad.  the movie from beginning to end, is one of the entertaining and powerful movies by newman. throughout the movie, we see luke's exploits including his status as ""cool hand"" which basically says that he can do anything. there is no better scene that shows this that luke's bet that can he eat 50 eggs in one hour. this scene is terrific and humorous to watch, time and time again. george kennedy plays greg dragline, luke's best friend and prison inmante.  dragline's love of luke is evident through the whole movie. whenever, luke is mistreated dragline is there to try to pick up his spirits. whenever, luke is beaten severely for trying to escape the prison, dragline is one of the first friends that is there to pick him up and attend to him.  then of course, this oscar worthy film has the memorable tunes and lines that all audiences all familiar with:
""what we got here is a familiar to communicate"" is paul newman, legendary and household line that critics and audiences remember. this line has also been used in over a hundred, movies and tv shows including comedies, crime drama movies and much more. the line is a piece of cult phenomena and america which symobolizes a bad situation.

""Cool Hand Luke"" stands as one of the American movies ever made. It represents the abusive and mistreatment that a couple of prisons have.  It also represents an intelligent and popular fellow who all through his life had one bad situation after another, yet like Greg points ""Ah Luke, always had that great smile.""

Luke, who is arrested for maliciously destroying federal property, (cutting the heads off of parking meters) is sent to jail for two years. He is as his name implies-cool. He has very little to say, but when he speaks, the other cons listen. Suffice it to say that he's a man who can win lots of cigarettes and money in the big house. Many humorous moments can be found in the opening hour, such as Luke's consumption of fifty eggs ('nobody ever 'et fitty eggs before) but are used sparsely in the last half. The viewer, after an hour starts to see, that even though Luke is a messiah to the other inmates, he is essentially flawed. His family life is less than satisfactory, and when his mother dies, he is expected to 'lose it', and if numerous attempts of fleeing jail is 'losing it' Luke is crazier than Hannibal Lecter. Now, what I sincerely love about this movie is that Luke is an excellent guy, he is calm and clear-headed and refuses to be just another prisoner. He is, in the end a human, but a human with a better vision for what he wants his life to be. Expect no happy ending, just watch, please. This movie is superb.",1077926400,3,1265,4.410256410256411

Paul Newman's Luke stands as one of the finest roles ever played.  He's easygoing and likable, but has a stubborn streak a mile long.  That stubbornness, after creating initial conflict with the other prisoners, endears him to them.  And he gets along just fine until his mother dies.  After that, he can only think of escaping.  Not to get to her funeral, though--just because he was treated unfairly by the warden.

So he goes to jail, and the film pits the individual against the institution in a classic power struggle, the outcome of which is rarely in doubt. Oh, and don't forget the hardboiled egg eating contest, and the size and drum-like tenseness of Newman's stomach...
Cool Hand Luke made an icon of Paul Newman and cemented his place in history as an actor who could play a loner, a stubborn rebel.

94001,5,0790733919,"I cannot imagine why this film hasn't been more acclaimed. It is without a doubt one of the best of all time. I think the thing that appeals most of all to me is the unbelievable authenticity of all the characters. Except for Newman (because, hey, he's Paul Newman) nobody here appears to be acting. The guards are done just right--tough, good ol' boys who you don't wanna mess with. The prisoners meanwhile are a fairly diverse lot, some educated, some not, some with a whiff of femininity, but all have a refusal to be stripped of their dignity. Luke magnifies that element to the Nth degree.
The second best thing is the dialogue: Like ""The Godfather"", ""Star Trek II"", ""Resoirovir Dogs"", and ""Jaws"", Cool Hand Luke has several scenes which you'll easily memorize in their entirety.
Other elements: Boss Godfrey, The Man With No Eyes who doesn't say one word during the movie and who is one of the most chilling characters in a movie ever; Luke's mother, the car wash girl, the egg-eating contest, and Luke's excellent final monologue.
Luke's story has been compared to that of Jesus. When you look at it, you see that if Luke is a savior, he's a terribly flawed one, one who can't save himself. He's anti-authority, he's got nerve, and some major cojones, but he's got no aims, no goals, no beliefs. He's a Rebel Without A Clue. If he'd been born about 15-20 years later he could have made a good hippie. But this is still the early '50s and men who fail to conform end up exactly where he does. IMHO, this film accomplishes what One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest tried to do and does it much, much, better.
One final small note: The Lalo Schifrin score is great particularly during the ""tarring the road"" scene. Anyone who grew up in NYC in the 70s will instantly realize it as the theme to Channel 7 Eyewitness News!",1054857600,10,1819,4.531914893617022

94023,5,0790733919,"This 1967 film begins when Paul Newman, cast as Luke Jackson, is arrested for cutting the tops off parking meters and sent to a southern chain gang prison for a two-year sentence.  Life is harsh for the men who must toil in the sun building roads each day.  But Luke is cool, very cool.  Soon he gains the respect of his fellow prisoners and becomes a leader himself.  He rebels constantly.  Nothing can stop him, not even a double set of chains on his legs. He's the lovable maverick that we all admire.
Performances are excellent, especially that of George Kennedy, cast as Luke's buddy.  A youthful Dennis Hopper has a small part also.  Best of all though is the one scene with Jo Van Fleet, cast as Luke's mother, who comes to visit him in prison.  She's clearly dying and is lying in the back of a truck, unable to walk.  She smokes cigarettes constantly and is full of wisdom and grit and gumption.  She talks about how she just can't be like a female dog who don't recognize her pups after they've grown and tells Luke that his old man wasn't much for sticking around but he sure did make her laugh.  She laughs then and gets into a fit of coughing.  Newman does his usual fine job in a challenging part that has him break down at times but yet never lets him lose his sprit.
The reason for Luke's rebellion was always a little murky and that was the strength of the screenplay. He never did anything really wrong; he just confronted authority.  And every time he ran away, he kept getting caught.  It also seemed that life on the outside wasn't so great for him and he yearned for the camaraderie of his fellow prisoners, who, by the way were all white as this film takes place in the segregated south.  Sometime, though, the prison seemed more like an army barracks.  There was always plenty of food and they didn't have to work on Sunday.  The men played cards and had some slight recreational activity.  For example, at one point they all took bets on whether or not Luke would be able to eat 50 hard-boiled eggs in the period of one hour.  Guess who won?
The story held my interest even though there were no real surprises.  Sometimes though I thought that the actors cast as members of the chain gang were just a little too handsome and well muscled to be a typical cross-section of prisoners, but - after all, this is Hollywood.  However, it's a good film, with good performances.  And I definitely recommend it.",1045267200,8,2426,4.428893905191874
94024,5,0790733919,"This movie is anything but cool. The characters are rough, foul, and awkward. The setting is realistic and harsh. It takes place in the scorching sun and humidity. There's many a scene of sweat and overheating men. Luke, though, is cool. He's the figure of composure; he's classy, smart, proud, and witty, but he rarely talks, keeping aloof. Or he's independent free man who won't let anyone get him down.
There's a scene when he bluffs his way to victory in a poker match, thus his nickname ""cool hand Luke"". Another scene has him fighting with another inmate until he's nearly unconscious, but he never surrenders. Yet another has him eating 50 eggs in an hour for a bet, and he doesn't give up. And I think this is the metaphor for the rest of the film. You can either see him as a cocky stubborn man, or more appropriately, a man who won't give up his freedom. He's thrown in prison and chain gang labor for a case of petty vandalism during a drunken stupor, yet he never utters a word about it, even during the most humiliating or painful punishment, but his conviction and sentence are hardly a matter in this film. Here is a man who is troubled and dysfunctional (as the story slightly exposes), but is already in an advanced state of personal freedom. Though he'd like to be living a normal life, searches for it, and deserves as much, he doesn't need it. He's spiritually and mentally invincible, and eventually it leads to his ultimate fate.
Cool Hand Luke is a marvelous film. It's one fourth romantic, three fourths gritty reality. Paul Newman and the gorgeous cinematography are the romance. Newman nearly carries the film. Here's this movie star, a charismatic leading man who liberally uses his smile to get himself through scenes, but he immerses himself into his character. I think Luke is one of the greatest, most complex male characters to grace the screen, and Newman is really the only actor who could ever do him justice. But he isn't playing Newman, he's playing Luke, every inch of Luke.  He IS Luke, he is this renegade rebel, this charming dapper Dan, and this tragic everyman.  Newman's supporting cast is superb, in one of the best acted films I've ever seen. George Kennedy is incredible as the only sizable supporting character, though the rest of the cast do their utmost to fit their roles, especially the various sinister and slimy wardens, and they do it beautifully. No actor wastes his time on screen. They create the atmosphere.
I just have to mention the dialogue. This is one of those films with incredible dialogue. Nothing is sappy or soupy. It embraces wit and logic, a lovely razor sharpness, and a down to earth realism. Every sentence is perfectly placed, there are no superfluous words, every character with they're own style that still allow them to sound like real people. End of dialogue discussion.
This film is simple. It's simply told, simply filmed, and on the outside it's a simple story, but I think it delves a lot deeper than at first appearance. It's unpretentious. Without us knowing it paints an environment, it paints a setting. It's a movie with certain faintly stylized points and flourishes, with a bit of a Southern storytelling air and lilt to it, and a definite love for fun. But it's intense, from the acting, to plot twists and character developements, to minor ""action"" sequences (a movie populated by inmates and movie stars has to have some excitement), it has incredible depth in it's subtle symbolism and it's layered messages and it's performances with their emotional tapestries. Thus, it has an immense replayability quotient.
This is drama at it's finest. It is a complex intriguing film that can get under your skin in it's rawness, but can still entertain you, and send you into that dreamy mesmerized state of being in awe of a film and the characters portrayed in it.",1038355200,109,3850,4.744776119402985
94025,5,0790733919,"This movie reminded me a bit of ""Papillon"" in that it shows us a convict continually trying to be free.  Whereas Papillon was looking for freedom from incarceration, Cool Hand Luke is looking for freedom of spirit.  He also realizes that he is a symbol to the rest of the inmates.
Luke represents the American spirit.  He has had enough of rules and regulations and just wants to be.  He feels he has paid his debt by going to war (where he was a decorated hero).  Once he is incarcerated, he begins to set an example for the other inmates.  He is independent and he will not quit.  The other inmates grow to depend on his spirit to hold up their own.  When he appears to have failed, they all turn their backs on him.  This is a lot like we do famous people whom we idolize.  Once they have transgressed, we ignore them.

However, behind this toughness there is also a very compassionate person who can sing and cheer up others when things are harsh.

The movie is filled with unforgettable scenes (Lucile washing the car; the egg scene) and lines (""What we got here is failure to communicate.""). The film has a great supporting cast and George Kennedy won an Academy Award. The movie can be described as a typical 1960s antiestablishment rebellion movie. However, the film is much more than that. At its core is a story of humanity shrouded in Christ-like imagery.

94030,5,0790733919,"What a great movie. Paul Newman shows in this film (And his earlier role in ""The Hustler"") why he is one of the greatest actors of all time. Surprisingly, he did not win an Academy Award for his role as Luke Johnson, a born loser who ends up on a chain gang for destroying parking meters. George Kennedy did however win an Academy Award as Dragline, who becomes a sort of mentor to Luke. Luke's problem is that he has a lot of guts, but has no brains. That's why I like the phrase I used for my title. It best shows the spirit of Luke: Keep fighting, even when you are beat.
There are many other elements that make this movie great. Besides the acting, there is an authentic feel to the picture's depiction of the chain gang. We can actually feel the heat bearing down on us as the men work in the fields or tar roads (This feel can be attributed to co-author Donn Pearce, who was on a chain gang for two years). This film, however, is probably most remembered for the characters of ""The man with no eyes"" and the prison captain who utters the famous line ""What we've got here is...failure to communicate"".

Because, after all, that is a rather odd thing.  I became entranced with the movie, even though I hadn't a clue what it was except that Paul Newman was in it and it was cool.  By the time it got to the ""failure to communicate"" speech and I realized ""Hey, that's from the Guns and Roses song"" I had figured out what the movie was.  When it was over, I sat there watching the credits role up the screen, thinking about what I had just experienced (yes, not WATCHED, but EXPERIENCED).
This is one hell of a great movie.  It has so many great parts in it.  The infamous egg scene.  You actually can see that Luke's stomach looks ready to burst from all those eggs!  I wonder how they got it to look like that?  Also, the part where Luke is ""broken"" by the prison bosses. His fellow inmates try to help him while he is digging and filling the ditch again and again by playing music, but, after they see him break, they don't even talk to him.  They don't so much as look at him.  After all he did for them, they just let him collapse of exhaustion in the aisle between the beds.  They were with him when he was riding high, when he didn't need them, but when he hit his lowest point and needed them they were nowhere to be found (well, they were right there in the room with him of course, but you know what I mean).  You are really feeling for Luke in that scene.
There are a few things in this movie that confuse me.  First of all, why is Luke sentenced to a chain gang for so long just for cutting the tops off of parking meters?  And, I think it is the second time he escapes, when he's shaking the bush, the one guard (the man with no eyes) starts trying to shoot at him almost immediately.  Wouldn't he wait at least a couple seconds?  What if he really was just taking a leak?  Anyway, those are just a few things I found confusing.
This is really one the best movies around.  It also ranks extremely high on what I call the Rewatchability Scale.  I have only seen this three times, all on TV, but whenever it's on, no matter what else I had been planning on watching, it just pulls me in everytime, and I can't take my eyes off until the credits roll.  Everytime is like the first time.  It is that great.  Also, if you like this, get The Shawshank Redemption.

Soon he's making up challenges for himself, like the unforgettable 50 eggs in an hour scene, presumably out of boredom.  But the viewer doubts that Luke is pulling these stunts because he's bored, it is more likely that he's trying to make his friends feel less like numbers and more like people, despite the chains and hard labor.  Then things take a turn for the worse as the prison boss takes a dislike to our hero Luke, and suddenly Luke's antics aren't just for sport anymore, they're for his life.

From the arrest scene, where Newman denies knowing why he committed his crime, to the famous scene where he devours countless eggs in a prison contest, to the poignant scene with his apparently alcoholic and degenerate mother, to the amazing understated scene where he strums his guitar and sings the underground classic ""Plastic Jesus,"" and so on, Newman displays an astonishing range and is a compelling, captivating, anti-hero.

94067,5,0790733919,"Great cast, led by Paul Newman, George Kennedy, J.D. Cannon and of course Strother Martin. Great score.
Surprisingly for a prison film, there is lots of humor, at the beginning some found in the notion that one could go to an oppressive road gang for just cutting the tops off of parking meters. Or, the woman washing her car with suds all over her breasts and DragLine's (G. Kennedy) great quote: ""Anyone with a face so sweet... and a body like that MUST be named Lucille""! Unlike another reviewer, I was pleased to see a film about life in prison that did not include a rape scene.
The notion of a rebel against authority (remember, though, that Luke was not too much of a rebel, because he won a Silver Star in the war) is one that resonates with lots of folks (and not just yuppies or baby boomers). How can one not identify with Newman, who is less than enthused about a ""lot of guys, spouting off a bunch of rules and regulations"". ANYONE who ever wanted to say to a boss ""just because its your job don't make it right"" ought to be able to identify with Luke on some level.
But like many great films (among which I count this one), its a simple film. One guy who won't submit among a band of others who have decided that it was easier for them to submit. Another reviewer says its like a slow lazy day. Nothing wrong with that, and like a slow lazy day, this film it can be enjoyed over and over again, and comes around far too infrequently. To those who suggest this film is much ado about nothing, I commend the wisdom of Luke himself, who had the best line of the film: Sometimes nothing can be a real cool hand.",983404800,,1621,4.266233766233766
94068,5,0790733919,"I've seen this movie more times than any other. In perhaps six viewings, I'm still struck by the tight editing and perfect casting. The music and bit parts working as one. The hound dogs chasing a man they'll never catch. How all the parts work better together than the individual aspects alone. There is a lot of humor in what is in essence a chain-gang movie. The red pepper sprinkled behind the fleeing Newman to thawrt the blood hounds, the phoney picture of Newman with two beautiful women sent to the men in prison, the busty car-washing woman, Lucille; it goes on and on. Just when you think you have it figured out, it twists a bit. The writing and screenplay are first rate.
The movie strikes a chord with me personally as a baby boomer rallying against authority. Paul Newman shares a quality or two with our ex-president, Bill Clinton. They are both well liked and admired. The ladies think so too. They both take on difficult odds and never quit. It's that essence of taking advantage of a moment in time. George Kennedy at one point says to Paul Newman that he'd been kidding everyone and planning his escape all along. Paul replies he'd never planned anything in his life and just took advantage of a particular situation. (That sounds like Clinton.) Paul Newman's mother also won as best supporting actress and I see a resemblence to stories I've heard about Bill's mother. George Kennedy won as best supporting actor in a good-old-boy-farm-hand-convict role. Not too bright, perhaps, but willing to play the game our hero never does. Paul doesn't pretend on any level which is what gives him his heroic halo.

The movie is very typical of the 60's genre where rebellion was in, and what we have in Luke is the consummate rebel. But a very lovable rebel at that.  We learn of the various psychological complexities of Luke and of the very grim conditions of living on a southern chain gang.  There are so many aspects of this movie that make it great that it is hard to isolate just a couple.  The friendship that develops between the character ""Dragline"", beautifully played by George Kennedy, and Luke is wonderful to experience, as is Luke's constant search for God.
The movie is full of humor, for example the famous egg-eating contest, tenderness, sadness and just about any emotion you can think of.  I think that is what has made it so appealing over the years.
I greatly appreciate the efforts of Director Stuart Rosenberg, Actor Paul Newman who gave, what I consider to be, the finest performance of his career, George Kennedy for his Academy Award winning performance, and composer Lalo Schifrin who wrote the beautiful musical score.

Plenty of posts have mentioned the Christ-allusions, which show that this film operates somewhere in the realm of myth and allegory.  The problem with cinematic myth and allegory is that characters easily become caricatures.  Luke has personality, but every other prisoner but Kennedy's character seems to be just an Everyman as foil to Luke's greatness.  Nobody else has any fight, intelligence, or charisma?  As every jeweler knows, it is a cheap trick to make a jewel look brighter by placing it amongst junk.
This film is like a lazy stroll through a garden.  It can be slow going, but there are some real pleasures.  The oft-mentioned egg-eating scene is one example.  So too Luke's punishment digging, refilling, and redigging the ditch.
I don't know what was going through the minds of the Oscar judges when they awarded the Best Supporting Actor trophy to George Kennedy.  His role is interesting and (as the Judas figure) crucial, but as always he overplays it.  Whereas Paul Newman and all of the prison officials give naturalistic performances, George Kennedy is a hambone.
Also straining credulity is that these prisoners almost never fight.  (But there is one good fight scene between Newman and Kennedy.)  Indeed, this is the least menacing group of convicts you could hope to come across.  Also, for a prison film it is oddly asexual.  In one scene the prisoners lust after a busty blond washing her car, but she makes no further appearances.  Possible homosexuality amongst the prisoners might be hinted at, but it's hard to tell.  (Dancing together, jumping rope in tandem with the same rope.)  Thus the ever-present risk of rape in male prisons doesn't rear its head here.",980467200,3,1966,4.942073170731708

94087,5,0790733919,"This is one of the great, old films from the sixties.  A visual and emotional masterpiece that managed to capture both critical and commercial  success, proving its appeal to a wide range of audiences.  This is an old  Hollywood movie but with some new Hollywood themes and ideas.
Stuart  Rosenberg's 1967 film ""Cool Hand Luke"" is a story about a loner who after  cutting some heads off of parking meters is sent to prison and forced to  work on a chain gang.  This is the basic story but the film itself is more  about a man who is destined always to be a loner.  He is similar to Ethan  Edwards in ""The Searchers"" or Travis Bickle in ""Taxi Driver"" in a way that  all three of these characters are complete and utter loners.  They never  really fit in, at least not for long, but are always very interesting.
At the beginning of the movie Luke is alone, drunk and in an act of  rebellion against the government starts vandalizing property.  We never  find out what drove him to this but we know it was ""rules and regulations"".  We know he was a war hero so perhaps he couldn't adjust to regular life  when he got home, who knows, the point is that he is a loner.  He is sent  to prison and at the beginning of his sentence he is still a loner.  He  isn't a regular prisoner yet but is still quite different from the other  new guys.  He has a certain air of intelligence around him and a little  cockiness too.  He eventually gains the prisoner's respect and eventually  becomes a sort of God in their eyes through stuff he does (including a  savvy poker move and one crazy egg-eating contest).  Through all of this  though, he is still not really one of them.  He is however one of them in  one scene of the movie: the one where the prisoners are shoveling tarmac  onto a road and Luke manages to ruffle up their spirits and the men finish  the job in a very short time.  In this scene all of the men come together  in a kind of mis-guided rebellion against the guards.  Luke is equal to  them at this point but doom is on the horizon and as the viewer you sense  this.  The death of Luke's mother changes everything and he gets ""rabbit in  his blood"" and proceeds to try to escape.  He is a loner again at this  point.
The film goes on until the final stand off with the prison guards.  What happens is inevitable.  I'm not going to say what it is but it will  seem necessary to prove a point.
Acting wise this is Paul Newman's best  work to date.  He is one of my personal favourites and had delivered  outstanding roles in ""The Hustler"", ""Hud"" and ""Nobody's Fool"" but this tops  them all.  His finest moment in the film comes when he sings for his dead  mother.  The look in his eyes says it all and you can't help but feel his  pain.  The rest of the cast is great with George Kennedy in an Oscar  winning role as a prisoner and Strother Martin as the prison warden (""What  we've got here is a failure to communicate"").
This is a very underrated  film that deserves a look from anybody who loves movies.

I've watched it many times over and am always discovering more depth to the script and screenplay.
Paul Newman plays  the title character with the cool, easy going grace the part calls for.  Cool Hand Luke is content with passing time, just as long as he is given a  little elbow room for his independent nature.  But he is given no room to  manuever by The Man.  Just like in ""One Flew Over the Cookoos  Nest"", our hero is bigger and better than their antagonist, except for  the fact that time is one the side of the jailor.  As in his brutal fight  with Dragline (George Kennedy), Luke is fighting with a ""hand full of  nuthin"".  His fighting philosophy is like The Clash lyric, ""We're  gonna fight, till you lose"".
Luke can take all The Man gives and  more, until tragically, his mother dies.  The prison warden decides that he  must lock Luke down, just when Luke is feeling the most claustrophobic; He  needs the opposite.
Luke will not bend to the guards intimidation, and  the guards will not give Luke the elbow room he so desperately needs.  Especially because he is the viewed as an near-deity by the other  prisoners.
There are many illusions to Luke as Christ.  Is Luke an  unwilling Christ figure?  I don't know.  He is to the prisoners.  He is  viewed as a mythic hero by the other prisoners.  He is the best eater, the  best worker in the Bull-Gang, the best musician, the best poker player, the  best escapee.  But his disciples abandon him in this time of greatest need.  He is looking for answers from The Man (and I don't mean Boss Godfrey),  but gets no reply.  Watch for the symbolism throughout.
There is also  much to enjoy for the casual viewer.  This film has many classic scenes and  lines.  ""I ken eat 50 ehhgs"", Lucille at the car wash (Oh Baby!),  ""What we got here is failure to communicate"", and ""Saying  its your job don't make it right, Boss"".  Paul Newman is easy on the  eyes.  And the supporting cast, lead by chief disciple George Kennedy, is  superb.  I also enjoyed the Christian music throughout.",966988800,,2056,4.485013623978202
94089,5,0790733919,"This movie ranks as one of my TOP FIVE of all time. Classic Paul Newman! Of course! ""No one can eat 50 eggs!"" and ""What we have here is a failure to communicate!"" Some of the best lines in this flick  ever.  George Kennedy, what a role he plays. Keep your eyes peeled for  several familiar characters, who later became stars, such as: Ralph Waite  (Papa Walton) and Joe Don Baker (Walking Tall).  I can't say enough about  this movie, I could easily talk about it forever. The ensemble cast, the  storyline, the prison, the road gang, the heat, that song about the plastic  Jesus.........If you like Paul Newman, and you have not seen this  film....BUY IT NOW!",964742400,2,660,4.52542372881356
94090,5,0790733919,what can i say about this film? Paul Newman is Cool to the Bone as is George Kennedy. Paul Newman is a Can't miss in this Film. He handles the Film from start to finish.as Cliche' as this might sound it's one of those roles  he was born to play.the Chain Gang isn't the same with Cool Hand Luke  around.a must see film.very well Acted&Directed.,964224000,,344,4.276923076923077
94091,5,0790733919,"Newman really rocked in the 60s with Hud and Cool Hand Luke. Most memorable is the soundtrack which is the guitar piece that plays as the inmates are working out in the blistering southern sun. George Kennedy won  a well-deserved oscar for his role as ""Dragline"". This film is  great fun and has some memorable dialouge.(""Callin' it you're job  don't make it right boss...."").  Hud is such a likable character  you can't help but root for him as do the other inmates when Hud wins their  respect. Egg-eating scene is of course now ingrained in our memory! It is  also fun to notice all the bit parts that a lot of familiar faces had in  this picture(Wayne Rogers,Dennis Hopper,Harry Dean Stanton,Ralph  Waite).This movie is a regular ""world shaker...""",961891200,2,751,4.8046875
94115,5,0790733919,"Bought this film largely on the reviews here.  Being fairly young I haven't seen many films where Newman was establishing himself.  He puts on a fantastic performance here.  Basically the standard rebel film except  Newman doesn't act without a cause.  Put into jail for a seemingly minor  violation now, the system he encounters grates against his nature.  You  watch as the system wears him down and he wears the system down.  In the  end it is a kind of stalemate where both win and both lose.  George  Kennedy, who I admit seems like more of a comedy side from the movies I've  seen, is just unbelievable.  It is a shame he hasn't played more dramatic  roles.  Lovely film.",961891200,,677,4.610169491525424

94117,5,0790733919,"And I really mean it. They used to show this film often on the Superstation. When I was twelve, I watched it; the next time it came on, I taped it, and watched it probably more than 50 times over the next few  years (I didn't know for a long time that the TV version has several scenes  cut out for length, so getting it on video was a new revelation). What is  it about ""Cool Hand Luke"" that is so moving? Well, it starts with  Paul Newman's performance. Lucas Jackson is one of the most psychologically  complex characters in the history of cinema, and Newman, criminally denied  the Oscar for this film, makes him seem larger-than-life without saying  much. Everything that comes out of his mouth is a revelation. The Christ  allusions, which are fittingly done, heighten the sense of injustice that  Luke is being slowly crucified by the lawmen, simply because he won't bend  to their rules. On the surface, Luke seems self-destructive and ignorant,  but in repeated watchings of the film, it becomes apparent that Luke is  answering to a call that is bigger than the prison, bigger than the bosses,  bigger than the law itself. I could go on and on about the myriad other  ways in which this film is perfect, but why bother? I only get 1,000 words.  Suffice it to say that this is the movie that makes George Kennedy, of all  people, seem noble. YOU MUST SEE THIS FILM. The only flaw: I grew up in  Georgia, and I can assure you that it is not filmed where it is set. Looks  more like the Central Valley of California to me.",958608000,48,1529,4.419354838709677
94118,5,0790733919,This is one of my top 10 favorite movies of all time.  The story is both tragic and beautiful.  It's very moving and also includes some of the most unforgetable dialogue of any movie ever made.  I never get tired of  watching this movie. Please see it at least once.,955411200,,266,4.26
94119,5,0790733919,"No matter how many times I watch this movie, it will always be my favorite.  This is the essential Paul Newman movie.  Luke is the perfect Everyman; someone with whom we can all identify.  He finds the best in  every situation...while in prison, he does not dwell on the negative, but  passes the time lightheartedly.  While doing this, he also shows the  despair of prison life.  Combining these two elements is difficult, but  Newman perfects the combination and creates one of the best movies of all  time.",951955200,,509,4.747126436781609
94120,4,0790733919,"Cool Hand Luke is just great, classic viewing entertainment. Paul Newman's spirit of non-conformity is so powerful. When we see him smiling in that opening freeze-frame, That classic frame, right then and there we  automatically know we're dealing with a man who's head-and-shoulders above  the rest. The system will never understand him. There's this feeling that's  he's always got something up his sleeve for them. And we see that. There's  a quality of life in him, that, even by the end, is never extinguished.  Because his legacy carries on. Here's a man who won't betray who he is.  Refuses to be catagorized. You gotta love Luke for who he is. The system  can't keep him down. He's going to keep going..... push the limits......",941846400,2,736,4.887096774193548
94121,5,0790733919,A classic film about life in a southern chain gang. The part that kept me amused yet sick to my stomach was watching Paul Newman trying to eat fifty hard boiled eggs.  It couldn't tell if he was really sick to his stomach or  just good acting.,930268800,,243,4.148936170212766
