Beautiful scenery of Croatia, outstanding cinematography combined with a very extreme and shocking plot which leaves you open mouthed.
All that makes this movie so special. Marian Dora as we know him.",1395878400,3,312,5.387755102040816
6293681,5,B00IT8QEW8,"For sure Marian Doras Movies have much things in comment. But Voyage to Agatis is no Cannibal an no Melancholy.
It's the travel into the soul of the main Character Raffael. A real bustard and sometimes you may like him. Hard stuff, but not with cannibalism or wired stuff. A story which could happen every day. But better not.",1395360000,,326,4.5423728813559325
8645288,3,B00IT8QEW8,"Marian Dora's film takes Polanski's 'Knife in the Water' premise (this time we have two women, one man) to a disturbing finale. If your not already acquainted with Dora's other work, you'll have a hint of where this is sailing from the opening sequence. Compared to other Dora films this is a bit tamer, visually, but still enters the shock territory established by 'A Serbian Film', 'Irreversible', 'Funny Games', etc. After 'Cannibal', I think this is Dora's most accessible film for the curious.",1483315200,,498,5.0120481927710845
8645289,3,B00IT8QEW8,"I love Cannibal and Meloncholie but this really wasn't what I expected . It was short and void of the beautiful cinematography the others had , and the music wasn't so great . Those are two things are the only redeeming qualities in his films . I think I tried to break it in half when I was drunk once . I can't remember if I threw it away or not . It's that bad I guess . I may watch again . Oh there's a film that ends up being actual footage as an autopsy with fancy credits and music as if to make it "" artsy ""  as an extra feature . For some reason I want to see again but I really believe I just trashed it",1430956800,,613,3.7153846153846155

8645291,1,B00IT8QEW8,"This is the worst film I have ever seen! It has no intelligent dramatic structure, the dialogs are so senseless and nonprofessional spoken. Ok wait, which dialogs?! You get bored the first 10 minutes of the film! So in general the story sounds not the bad if you read it and you could think of an clever chamber match on a boat (like Polanski did it before) but what you get is so much bullshit that it sucks! Really!
And now the technical making of the movie: there is no well done craft to recognize if you would say it like that. I can give the camera to a nobody in film making and let him or her start making the movie! perhaps the result would be better... In many forums are written: it is a brutal and exhausting movie and you should forget many other brutal films like Martyrs, High Tension, I Saw the Devil etc. WHERE IS THE BRUTALITY IN THIS MOVIE? At the end? The last 5 Minutes? Psychological terror? Come on... I have watched Heidi and sometimes it is more brutal...
So that is my opinion.",1420416000,,1003,4.28421052631579

8645295,2,B00IT8QEW8,"I was a fan of Marian Dora's CANNIBAL so I picked up this later film by him on DVD from Massacre Video.  Unfortunately, the transfer here is a HUGE eyesore - it definitely looks like they took a PAL master and improperly encoded it to NTSC, thus creating terrible ghosting effects, shaky image constantly, and missing/skipping frames throughout.  I've seen some PAL to NTSC transfers done poorly, but this one is the all-time worst and beyond awful.

And before anyone questions, yes, Dora shot this film on digital and it's very low-budget, but those are not the problems with the transfer.  It's all in the encoding that makes this disc unwatchable.  I only made it 10 minutes into the film before I couldn't take any more eyestrain.  The movie itself seemed interesting and I love Dora's style and use of music and graphic violence, but the transfer ruins everything.

I should mention that there are some interesting extras on the disc including interviews and four short films by Dora.  All of these are transferred correctly so that's definitely a plus!  The short films include a sexually graphic one starring the two male leads from CANNIBAL, as well as a cool 16-minute short of behind-the-scenes footage Dora shot of Jess Franco on set of his later DTV films (Killer Barbys sequel maybe, or Incubus, etc. - not sure as they all blend together in my head).  So the extras on this disc may make it worth a watch for Dora or Francophiles.  It's just a shame they did such a complete botch-job on the main feature.",1398643200,5,1520,4.69811320754717
8645296,4,B00IT8QEW8,"I honestly got into this expecting more... but really good arthouse/thriller/pseudo-snuff (very extreme ending) film. The characters are good too, main one Rafael seems like a.disgusting being but at the ends it really gets into you, great cast considering low budget. Dialogue seem a bit out of place but somehow worked with the whole surreal, absurd flow. It does stand alone as one of the darkest, most nihilistic pieces. Extras are good. Short but rewarding interview with director Marian Dora is great, 4 short films which are interesting but kinda gets tiresome. Overall great product.",1397865600,,591,5.231578947368421
8645297,3,B00IT8QEW8,"This film is a pretty good representation of what I both like and despise about Dora.  It was shot in a single weekend, and apparently the actual plot of the movie was the final consideration (after casting, retaining use of a boat, etc). This is very evident, and indeed it doesn't seem that the movie has much of a plot at all.  However, something keeps the viewer watching (me, at least). Here's my recap:

The Good: The film moves away from the washed out colors we see in most of Dora's work, but there is some pretty solid cinematography throughout.  The music is fantastic. The actors develop characters out of a null plot and are pretty effective.  There is no animal cruelty, aside from retrieval, preparation, and ingestion of a sea cucumber.  The run-time for this film is much shorter than I'd expect from Dora. Massacre Video has released a pretty solid product that is visually appealing and is loaded with extras (interviews with Dora and some of his short 'films' as M.D. Bolutino).  The scenes of violence are extremely effective--I am really curious how he gets these effects on a tiny, if nonexistent budget.

The Bad:  One of the main selling points for this disc is that, for the first time, you can own a Dora film with legit subtitles.  However, the subtitles are just bad.  Simple words are misspelled (see chapter 3, 1:32).  This is particularly obnoxious considering there isn't a whole lot of dialogue in the film.  This is an issue of Massacre Video and not the filmmaker, obviously.  Regarding Dora's showing here, he continues to produce beat-you-over-the-head symbolism that becomes uncomfortably redundant in this particular movie.  Picture the same degree of obsession with dolls seen in Melancholie der Engel, all crammed into a 79 minute movie.  The dialogue that appears to be legitimately translated is completely absurd.

On a side note, one of the bonus short films is literally the gayest thing I have ever seen in my life--like it makes a Kenneth Anger movie look hetero and conservative.

All in all, I'd give the move a 3.5/5. Considering all of the extras, and the watchability of this movie as greater than one time, I think it's well worth $20.  The main dings come from the bad subtitling, in terms of technical errors and presumably the loss of meaning.  However, I don't think it impacts the overall film experience too much.

Finally, a closing plea.  People, please STOP WRITING REVIEWS FOR MOVIES YOU HAVE NOT SEEN.  Your ratings have an impact on the overall scores seen by prospective viewers that are actually thinking about buying it.",1396656000,15,2590,4.836363636363636
