8365059,5,B000RY5NVU,"Don't let the title fool you. Only ""Bermuda Highway"" is entirely acoustic. As soon as ""At Dawn"" begins, the rest of the band steps back out onto the stage. I personally like ""Okonokos"" a lot, but I absolutely love ""Acoustic Chorale."" ""Sooner"" is a great track with Jim James playing some keys, and singing at the same time. Then, my personal favorite of the DVD, comes ""Where to Begin,"" Two Tone Tommy hits some heart strings on the lap guitar. ""I Think I'm Going to Hell"" is a great precurser to ""Strangulation."" I must have watched this a million times. I would never give it up. Sorry all you die hard MMJ fans lookin for a copy, but I'm a huge fan too.",1221177600,,656,4.341463414634147
