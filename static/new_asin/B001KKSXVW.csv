3665835,5,B001KKSXVW,"I've always maintained that some (or even much) of the Bible requires logic and reason.  This DVD makes so much sense that I'm a little embarrassed that I didn't think of some of the points, myself. God isn't a magician with ""knock your socks off"" magic tricks. Everything works naturally within His plan.",1331769600,3,305,4.754716981132075
3665836,5,B001KKSXVW,"I have seen this video on several occasions. It is absolutely remarkable. If you want to see and hear how the Wise Men followed that star, you'll find out in this video. So much food for thought. This is one you will want to own and share with friends. It will give you an entirely different perspective on Christmas and why we celebrate it.",1226448000,6,341,4.34375

Mr. Setterfield's research and resulting ideas put forth on this DVD are very thought provoking and compelling.  Especially in the days in which we live, it is good to know Biblical truth from religious tradition. Much to my delight, this arrived within days of ordering, well before Christmas, making it extra special this year. I had seen it on public television a couple of years ago merely by happenstance, but knew immediately that I would want this teaching in my personal library to refer to for further study.",1454025600,,671,6.127659574468085

8315092,5,B001KKSXVW,"This DVD presents a fascinating and informative discussion on the different
points of view regarding astronomers ideas about exactly when Jesus was born and
most importantly: What exactly DID the Wise men see that led them to travel to Jerusalem!
This subject has interested me for a long time and this DVD helped me a great deal!
Enjoy before Christmas to make your holiday more special!",1417996800,,388,4.893939393939394

8315095,3,B001KKSXVW,Material is very good.  It moves a bit slowly and the jumps between scenes are a bit disconnected. Perhaps a bit of careful editing would help.,1390003200,,143,4.5
