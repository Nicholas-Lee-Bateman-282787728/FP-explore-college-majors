8748364,3,B01ATCA1V6,"The production is a play filmed in Atlanta (?) for TV. Bunny (Angell Conwell) and Carlyle (Lyriq Bent) are roommates. Carlyle is a free lance graphics designer who will be leaving town for a few years. Bunny owns a boutique in town. She comes from an upscale family having a ""debutante ball.""  She hosts a book club of a half dozen ladies which consists mostly of uncalled for catty remarks which passes for humor. Rona (Elise Neal) is shown to be the uneducated one when when uses bad grammatical lines such as ""Truth came out when you be drunk."" However she is able to say ""ask"" without it sounding like ""ax.""

The book they discuss is about men and the relationship and the film spends some serious time discussing this, something I didn't find as entertaining as perhaps a woman might.  Helema (Amanda Seales) shows up with some disturbing news. The play creates some faux drama and then everything works themselves out with a happy ending and understanding that we have once we get to know someone.

No swearing sex or nudity. Reminds me of a Tyler Perry  play without TP or music.",1462579200,,1086,4.606217616580311
