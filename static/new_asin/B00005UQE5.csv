1666939,4,B00005UQE5,"I'm not sure if anyone got what I think is the real underlying message here. That is, nice guys finish last. Althought Vince Vaughn's character, Penny, chose a job that involved the sleazy business of telemarketing, he was a nice guy who generally liked and trusted people, at least in person. He had an unfailing yet somewhat naive ethic that assumed people deserve to be treated fairly, and should be defended when confronted by injustice. The movie suggests that these qualities, although noble, are ultimately the cause of Penny's undoing.

Penny's likability was a magnet for desperate people (i.e. 1) his gutless co-workers: Penny was the one on whom they depended to stand up against bully employers who either didn't pay or was threatening blackmail; 2) his self-pitying brother: who used his handicap to prey on his good will, freeloading when he was more than capable of getting a job and taking care of himself; and of course, 3) Julia Ormond's character, who manipulated him into an arranged marriage.) Finally, at the end, he weighed his life's actions against their consequences, and decided to do what he thought was right for him.

Although the film failed to explain clearly why a person with such compassion and a strong sense of right and wrong would decide to work in such a sleazy environment in the first place, it nevertheless presented a disturbing essay on how good people can be taken advantage of.",1162425600,4,1424,4.904564315352697
1666940,3,B00005UQE5,"The hook in these grifter/con man movies is to see which of the con men gets conned at the end, and how.  All movies in this genre seem to follow that same plot structure.  This movie does too, but it suffers by comparison with two other recent movies in the genre, ""Matchstick Men"" and ""Confidence.""

What made those movies better, and this one worse, is that in those movies we can totally believe the ending, whereas here we can't.  Although the set up is believable, the mechanics of the final rip-off do not seem possible.  If they had spent just a bit more time and effort making us believe in the scenario whereby the con man finally gets conned himself, the movie would have been better.  Instead, it ends with a whimper, not a bang.",1145232000,3,741,4.451851851851852
1666941,2,B00005UQE5,"I had high hopes for this film, because I love Vince Vaughn in a dramatic role, but this film just didn't showcase it well. Frankly it was just really boring. The tension didn't run high enough. You need an emotional investment in the characters in order to care what's going to happen when the proverbial sh*t hits the fan, and these characters don't have enough depth. Plus it's all very predictable...if you watched Boiler Room you have an idea where the film is going to go, but even that didn't pay off, because the downfall is too abrupt. And it's hard to feel sorry for Vaughn's character when he gets screwed at the end...he knew what he was getting into, he didn't trust the boss, and he was right, but he went along anyway. Very disappointing.",1109116800,,753,4.544117647058823
1666942,3,B00005UQE5,"This is a great movie with a great cast however Vince Vaughn gives perhaps his best dramatic performance to date. Unlike Will Ferrel, Vaughn can do both comedy and drama.
This is a great movie thats shows us the real sleazy and corrupt world of telemarketing. In fact if your a telemarketer watching this film , youll probably be mad since it exposed your corrupt jobs!! lol
Vaughn plays Penny Wise, a small but great telemarketer who knows how to con people into making sales for his cheap company.
Eventually a bigger telemarketing scheme headed by the character of Ed Harris wants to use Penny's ""skills"" in this area to pull of a Million Dollar scam.
Meanwhile Penny's friend is out of work and relies on him for support.
Penny is caught in a corner, work with this rich white scoundrels to steal millions and sell his soul to the devil , so to speak, or do the right thing?
This a great movie about moral dilemna and what you really do if you really had to put your money where your mouth and live up to your own idealogies.
All the performances are great and the movie, doesn't really tell you what Penny's ""final decision"" will be until the 10 minutes he ""goes along"" with the scam and looks like he will do it with the rest of them.
Highly recommended.",1088208000,4,1260,4.435344827586207
1666943,4,B00005UQE5,"if you're looking for a pure heist film, this one is only average; i'd recommend the argentinian ""nine queens."" i think the prime gig goes somewhat deeper. the relationship between penny and the old lady is realized very gracefully in just a few minutes. vince vaughn shows some really impressive range here. the ending leaves you a little flat, but i think it's fitting. why spend 5 bucks to rent the movie when you can buy it for just 10? it's definitely worth it.",1080777600,4,466,4.559523809523809
1666944,3,B00005UQE5,"An average movie about a small-time high-talent phone con man who gets a break and chance at the 'big time' in his professions.  No more squeezing out twenty-five and fifty dollar orders after he joins on as a salesman at new firm hocking the next big investment deal to widows, retirees, and anyone with enough in the bank.
Filled with quirky characters and stereotypes the office is the battlefield where only the best can hack it.
A few rolls in the hay with the boss's chick and a couple of sales later the end comes crashing down.
Nice idea, kind of cute, would not rent it again though.",1054080000,6,592,4.481481481481482

SUBJECT: Review of ""Prime Gig"" Independent Pictures 2001.
Directed by: Greg Mosher
Written by: William Wheeler
Overview: Rent, no purchase.
  I recently rented the video ""Prime Gig"". I rented the video because the trailer for the video looked intriguing; fair enough that is the purpose of the trailer. The basic plot of the movie is man vs. environment. The plot follows a telemarketer by the name of Pendleton ""PENNY"" Wise (Vince Vaughn). The movie opens with main character working in a Telemarketing firm selling ""Vacation deals"" on phone list. This telemarketing firm goes out of business. Broke and out of work/unemployed. Penny is making contact with two ""headhunters"" in bar. The headhunter give him a lead for Kelly Grant ( Ed Harris, Apollo 13,Truman Show, The Right Stuff) Kelly plays a call center manager, for a mining company that needs working capital to extract gold from an open pit mine in Arizona. The subplot of this movie is a love interest between the main character Penny and Caitlin (Julia Ormand, Sabrina), Caitlin plays a floor supervisor, and she admits she is an illegal alien from England. She manipulates Penny into marrying her to avoid being deported; she subsequently raids Penny's bank account and cleans him out.
  The problem I have with this plot is that there are highly reputable business's that use telemarketing as a tool to make contact with the public. Another flaw in the plot was, I saw no indication that the main character gave access or converted his savings account into joint status. Why didn't Penny diversify out of savings into other financial services like bonds, Mutual Funds. Penny was losing purchasing power on his money. Also, Penny's bank is now liable for the unauthorized withdraw. The deposits are protected under Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, there is $100,000.00 cap. It was documented that his balance was $78,000.00, game over file a claim against the FDIC. Rest of world, this movie is worth renting, but do not buy.
The opinions expressed in this review are that of Big AL, and not necessarily those of anywhere this is posted or its sponsors. Thank god for the 1st Amendment of United States Constitution.",1029801600,4,2220,5.008130081300813
1666946,4,B00005UQE5,"The Prime Gig, directed by Gregory Mosher and written by Bill Wheeler, is good stuff. A sort of Mamet-esque tale of telemarketing and betrayal. Vince Vaughn and Julia Ormond do very good work together. Ed Harris, a favorite of mine, is not up to his usual standard here ... but is still delivers an acceptable performance.
Overall, the film works. It's quirky and suspenseful simultaneously, and although the plot seems familiar at first, Wheeler takes it in unexpected directions. Mosher's direction is also good, without pompously drawing attention to itself. A well-made film.",1011657600,10,579,5.236559139784946

1666986,5,B00005UQE5,"I rented this in the late '90's and I thought it was riveting. I love the way Vince Vaughn thinks he is the prime hustler and so slick. He finds out he isn't close to being in the big leagues and it changes him in the end. I adore films that keep you on the edge, never quite being certain how it is being played out, and this one delivers with an excellent cast and script. I had an AhA! moment in the end and everyone I have sugested this movie to have been as pleased as I was. It's a keeper, which is why I ended up buying it years later!",1389139200,,542,3.8482142857142856

1666988,3,B00005UQE5,"Never heard of this 2001 con man film. Watched it recently on the Sundance Channel. The Prime Gig is better than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Boiler-Room/dp/0780631536/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Boiler Room</a>, which I found glitzy yet empty, but miles from the genre's gold standard,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Glengarry-Glen-Ross/dp/B00005JKG9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Glengarry Glen Ross</a>.

The first third of the film offers a treasure trove of character actors, who, while not on the level of Pacino, Lemmon et al, are still imminently interesting: Stephen Tobolowsky, Wallace Shawn, George Wendt. Unfortunately, they all disappear as the action moves to the upscale selling room. Bad move.

With virtually no sympathetic characters and a plot full of holes, this was never going to be a commercial success. Even on an artistic basis, it fails: the ending is both obvious and not credible. Vince Vaughn does okay, and Ed Harris is always worth watching, but I would hang up on this like a cheap telemarketer.",1354579200,,1113,6.4630872483221475

1666991,4,B00005UQE5,"I just watched this little film last night and I was entertained by the quirky supporting characters and intrigued by the fairly mellow journey of deceit laid down.  I thought Vaughn, Ormond, and Harris were solid and even though this was a pared down slice of ""The Boiler Room"" meets ""GGGR"", it kept me guessing and wondering until the end.  It is a decent film, not as engaging as the aforementioned because the characters aren't as developed in a deeper and broader way, and not told as stylishly as the others (but that is where this one's strength lies....the bluntness and subtleties of the con are displayed).  A ""Sleeper"", in my humble opinion.",1260748800,,652,4.752212389380531
1666992,2,B00005UQE5,"A passable conman flick. Vince Vaughn plays telemarketing scammer Pendelton ""Penny"" Wise who sells phony vacations to unsuspecting callers. The firm he works for is about to go under. He takes care of his crippled friend, Joel (Rory Cochrane). When the firm goes out of business, Vaughn hooks up with infamous conman Kelly Grant (Ed Harris) and his gal pal Caitlin (Julia Ormond).

The film starts out with colorful, interesting characters played by Stephen Tobolowsky, George Wendt, Wallace Shawn, and Kathy Baker, but it jettisons them completely once Vaughn's Penny goes to work for Harris' Kelly Grant.

The performances by Vaughn, Cochrane, Harris, and Ormond are topnotch but the screenplay is pretty lackluster. First, the relationship between Penny and his childhood friend, Joel, is poorly developed. Why is Joel on crutches? Was he injured in an accident or is he handicapped? Why is Penny so devoted to his friend, who, quite frankly, is an immature loser and freeloader? Halfway through the film, Joel just seems to disappear. This character could have been completely cut out of the film, and it would not have made much of a difference. I give Cochrane credit for giving such an interesting performance despite the fact that his role is so woefully underwritten.

Also, it's pretty obvious that Kelly and Caitlin are up to no good and should not be trusted, and yet, Penny works for them anyway. He seems smarter than that. I thought this stretched the credibility of the film.

I also felt let down by the ending. It seemed too ambiguous. It left loose ends.

I would recommend this for rental. You would be better off buying a much better film about conmen, Glen Garry Glenn Ross.",1226620800,2,1696,4.936842105263158
1666993,2,B00005UQE5,"I almost cared about this movie. Almost. I mean, you can't go wrong with Vince Vaughn and Ed Harris, right?

Wrong.

The Prime Gig offers slices of entertainment that keep you modestly plugged into the movie, but ultimately, those slices are not enough to suffice. Characters come and go without us caring, and the main characters look as bored as we do. Vaughn plays a conman who goes to work for a master con-artist and ultimately meets his match. There's some attempts to make us care along the way, and some dialogue that tries to assert itself, but at the end of the day, we still don't care and strike 'The Prime Gig' from the first cut at the ""Could Have Been a Cool Movie"" tryouts.",1208822400,7,689,4.4603174603174605
1666994,2,B00005UQE5,"There are certainly worse ways to spend 93 minutes -- just check out your local multiplex. Shellgames are never boring, and the ensemble cast is great (as they nearly always tend to be, in con movies). But, as others have pointed out, this one has more holes in it than a shower head. Shares in a gold mine? Pur-lease! Where is any telemarketer supposed to find marks dumb enough to buy those? Why would any telemarketer worth his salt waste his time trying? And, given that the Vince Vaughan character makes it quite clear he's only marrying the girl to help her get a green card (and therefore presumably wouldn't have dreamed of putting his money in a joint account and giving her sole signature over it), what bank would be inept enough to let her clean out his account just because she could show she was his wife?",1179792000,6,819,4.503355704697986
1666995,4,B00005UQE5,"THE PRIME GIG, showcasing the acting talent of veteran

actors Vince Vaughn, the lovely Julia Ormond, and the

charismatic, head honcho Ed Harris, is more than just a

professionally made movie. It's an adrenaline packed,

emotionally charged story that carries viewers, on a

unique experience or rollercoaster over more than  90 mins.

Vaughn reprises, in part, an aspect of his humanity,

similar to to one seen inthe other movie LOCUST, (in which

he interacted with a disabled character called FLYBOY ).

He  thereby demonstrates his psychological need to come to

the assistance of his disabled friend who, as said,  has

difficulty suceeding in life and supporting himself,as a

brother's keeper. This clearly lends credibility to his

role, by making Penny multi-dimensional, not only a

workoholic salesman.

Viewers are treated to a perfect synchronicity between

real situations and the soundtrack, not unlike was the

case elsewhere in BoilerRoom, (that also had a great

soundtrack accompanying the story.) This clearly opens up

the sheer humanity of the sales persons, who must focus on

reaping their commissions surrounding a gold mining stock

promotion in a boiler room in an undisclosed secret

location, to regulatory authorities. This contrasts, in

other words, with the stereotype of sales as a job, often

seen as dehumanizing to those who participate in it, from

the pressure in meeting the sales numbers, on time, and in

full.

Regarding the selling aspect, PRIME GIG is actually pretty

realistic, showing there's more than one way to skin a

cat, meaning, different sales people approach sales

prospects with different techniques, although they share a

common objective, ""to kill, or fill"" the sales propspect.

We see a couple of CD's containing ""leads"", headsets,

dialers, a high pressure environment, a sales board,

competition between reps for the most number of sales,

commission bonuses, euphoria, depression, the illusion of

reps chasing a rainbow, in the job they accepted, as did

the prospects by accepting some sales for some products,

that even the salespeople didn't know was a con.

The movie has a dramatic, quick ending, bringing to light

another scourge of modern society, the mortgage fraud.

Clearly, viewers won't be able to say enough about the

acting skills of Vaughn, Ed Harris, and Ormond as their

intensity on screen, is  simply unbeatable.",1170374400,,2406,5.259946949602122

Almost everybody in in was a Con Artist; it was a depressing work, but, as I say, it was well done. I got it because I am a big fan of Julia Ormond; she did a great job in her roll as a despictable con artist. I hope almost all the characters drown slowly in an unflushed toilet. Still, seeing it may prevent you from being swindled by a Con yourself. It happens every day.  The plot is similar to ""The Sting"" and ""The Grifters"", also recommended. Also look at the book, ""The Yellow Kid Weal - Con Artist Extrsordinary"", or some title like that.  Take care; protect your money.
