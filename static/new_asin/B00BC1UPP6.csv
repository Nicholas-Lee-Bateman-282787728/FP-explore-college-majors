5572434,3,B00BC1UPP6,"I was looking for one with the first 3 episodes of the very first TV season--1949.
Not much detail given in the add for this one, so I relied on the customer reviews.
The top review must have been tagged to the wrong DVD because it said this one had those 3 episodes.  IT DOES NOT!
But eventually I found The Legend Begins which does.  Still a good DVD for what it is, it just was not what I was looking for.",1375574400,3,408,3.9634146341463414
5572435,5,B00BC1UPP6,I watch these when I was a kid when t.v. were black and white. All children and even old timers like me need to watch these. Great memories.,1372636800,,140,4.035714285714286
5572436,5,B00BC1UPP6,"My husband loves all of the Lone Ranger titles, so when Dreamwork Classics offered me the opportunity to try these out and comment on them for a review, I was happy to do so.

The works are amazingly clear given the age of the original series, and the sound quality was well done. I found no problems with watching them, except to get them away from my husband long enough to check them out for a review.

This particular DVD offers 8 episodes of the original television series and is a wonderful way to reintroduce yourself (or your children) to this wonderful masked man. Black and white - about 200 minutes (or a nice rainy afternoon) to watch.

As it says on the cover ""Kemo Sabe - Trusted Friend."" And I was always told it meant ""One who knows."" After checking online, I discovered that the most likely translation is ""Trusted Scout.""

Five stars for the quality of the reproduction.",1371427200,,888,4.53125

My brothers and sisters loved to cluster around our tiny television set watching the Lone Ranger. Undoubtedly our parents watched the originals, but like anything, it was new to us and we loved them anyway. We didn't have a color television set and these nostalgic selections do bring back memories.

It was serious stuff when Clayton Moore (The Lone Ranger) and Jay Silverheels (Tonto) hit the little screen. There's not a lot of analyzing to do about this series because most kids I know simply loved the duo. If you like oldies, but goodies, you'll love this sampling.
