7995623,5,B0000A2ZQK,"I'm just gonna say this is probably one of the best kicking videos if not the best kicking video made in the 20 years. Good video for beginner, intermediate, and advance martial artists of all levels. A true legend of kicking, Master Hwang Jang Lee is amazing a true wizard of kickery! Not only does the video tell you how to kick, but it goes into every detail from your stance, stretching, but what I liked a lot was the bunch of different ways Lee shows you how to move when kicking; from stepping, sliding, skipping, jumping and all the mechanics of increasing your kicking power and speed. Lee even shows you the best ways to retreat or back up when kicking in utilizing key movements in speed for your kicks. This is a great dvd dispute it being a little outdated with the 70's narrator voice theme. A kool added bonus: Hwang Jung Lee even shows you the secret to his super kicks: Hwang's Machine-Gun and Bicycle-Kicks famously done in old Kung Fu movies such as The Drunken Master & Snake in Eagle's Shadow movies with Jackie Chan and if ur a fan of that this is a must have.~(also the influence for the bicycle-kick for Lou Kang in Mortal Kombat)~ Hwang even put in cool beginning intro with fight scenes like a old kung Fu movie all TKD style; no hands! If your a fan of Taekwondo, Tang Soo Do, Hapkido and you want to improve your kicking or if you find yourself keep watching Best of The Best all the time LoL, then you'll love this Dvd! It will Totally up your game! ""The Hands move like swinging doors, but feet are the real weapons."" - Master Hwang Jung Lee",1345161600,2,1571,4.36518771331058

7995625,5,B0000A2ZQK,"There is no need to say more. If you want all the classic techniques, some of which are not even taught in the studios anymore, in the art of Taekwondo, this is the video for you.",1288915200,,179,4.0
7995626,5,B0000A2ZQK,"Anyone who bought this expecting it to contain anything more than TKD kicks should've done a little research. HJL is primarily a TKD master, so it's common sense that this video was all about TKD. Despite the video being dated, it is still a good video especially for beginners, as it shows how kicks are properly executed (albeit in the old school way). Some of the kicks are certainly not very practical, but most of them, when mastered, are a solid foundation to use in a real fight and not just in demonstration. The kicks that are more complex and not as practical shouldn't be disregarded but should be performed to practice control and balance. The repetition in this video should be considered a strong point, because it gives every opportunity for the viewer to observe how kicks are executed, whether from the front, back or side. HJL also shows how to generate power by emphasizing hip jerk and trunk twist, the use of the arms, proper bending of the knees, and the role of the back leg for leverage. There are plenty of little details presented in this video that are normally overlooked by some TKD masters when they teach their students.

If there was a TKD master from whom to learn kicks from, it would HJL. This video should be part of every TKD student's video library.",1213574400,7,1287,4.620087336244541
7995627,5,B0000A2ZQK,"This video is a MUST for any person seriously looking to improve their ability to perform fast, dynamic and effective TKD kicks.
Hwang Jang Lee is very, very good at what he shows and puts the techniques into a self-defence context.
His footwork is neat and his kicks are fast, accurate and incredibly powerful.
The feel to the video is 70/80s classic style, with big hair, long looks and fast action.
Teach yourself, and then your senior grades, how to perform the 1-step combinations and see what a reaction you'll get.
Good for demonstration techniques as well.",981763200,,564,4.824742268041237
