7980772,2,B000089QD6,"Unless the filmmaker (and I use that term generously) was intending to be ironical, we have here one of the most hysterically inept attempts to make a horror movie (or suspense-thriller or whatever) since the days of Ed Wood. It's *so* bad it is hysterically funny... in places. Poor photography, production design, editing and mixing, a bizarre use of underscoring (classical pieces which were clearly chosen to avoid paying for them), ridiculously BAD writing and actingsave for a few instancesand a blatant rip off of Silence of the Lambs would make for a complete waste of 77 minutes except for... Linnea Quigley.

Ms. Quigley, and a gratuitous plethora of gore and lesbian S&M sex scenes are the only things to recommend it to anybody.  If you're a huge fan of Linnea, you may want it solely for that reason. If you like to laugh at painfully Bad movies, you may want it for that reason. However if you only care about T&A or gore or bothadroitly donethen avoid this film like... fill in the blank with the most horrific thing you can think of.

I give it two stars *only* because of Linnea, who can do no wrong.",1452211200,,1117,4.6313131313131315
7980773,1,B000089QD6,How do I explain this movie. It starts off great with a bunch of dead bodies hanging around. Then the story just falls apart. It has some good gore but the plot goes nowhere. I won't bother telling you the storline because there no original thought here. Some good nudity but very bad acting. I really thought their would be more to this story after reading what it was all about but it was point less. If you have chance to rent it I suggest you do that first. Then you decide if you want to pay five bucks for this. I for one wish I didn't. I seen worse then this but I have seen much better.,1116892800,,594,4.0423728813559325
