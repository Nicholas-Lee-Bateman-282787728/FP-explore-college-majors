8190734,4,B000PE0GY6,"Hikaru no Go was quite big in Japan when the manga was first published in 1998. The anime series was also a hit and overall, the franchise inspired many of its readers and/or viewers to take up Go, an ancient Chinese board game that's kinda-sorta like chess, but much more complex!

The story is about Hikaru, a regular 12-year-old boy who meets the ghost of a Heian period nobleman, Fujiwara no Sai, whose fervant wish is to play Go once again. Only Hikaru can see or hear Sai, and at first, Hikaru's not too stoked about the idea of being Sai's proxy player. But over time, Hikaru gets more and more into the game and thus begins his journey to go pro!

Hikaru no Go is a pretty good series and it's pretty neat to see an anime that delves into traditional Japanese culture. They even explain the rules of Go so the viewer can follow along! However, although considered a kid's series, the reviewer can't help but think that some kids won't have the patience for this show. There's also some light mature themes, the most serious of which is Sai's suicide, though they do gloss over it somewhat.

Overall, if you're looking for a kid's anime series that doesn't involve monsters or Beyblades, Hilaru no Go may well be worth your time. You might even want to play Go!",1377648000,,1268,4.48051948051948
