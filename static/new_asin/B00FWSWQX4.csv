6034406,5,B00FWSWQX4,Just received this & the actual running time is 1:21:00 not 60 minutes as listed by Amazon. Worth owning for the classic rock concert without all the fancy camera cuts every few seconds. Shot plain & simple in a small venue.,1401321600,2,224,4.487804878048781
6034407,5,B00FWSWQX4,I have a DVD of Fog Hat and one of their last appearances in early 2000. The only remaining member of the band is Roger Earl on drums. The new band is surprisingly very much in sync with the early original Fog Hat.,1394064000,3,214,4.0
6034408,5,B00FWSWQX4,"I recieved the new DVD in the mail today from Amazon, what a great show, the band get's better and better all the time, great sound quality, love the set list, and the filming is fantastic, all the members of the band are great, and they seem like they are having a great time playing together, the actual run time is an hour and twenty minutes so your getting a full concert, this DVD would make a great addition to your collection.",1386892800,8,433,4.2926829268292686
6034409,5,B00FWSWQX4,"This is an outstanding show from the masters of electric blues/boogie.  The audio/video is outstanding, as is the setlist.  I particularly enjoyed the renditions of ""Road Fever"", ""Stone Blue"", and ""Fool for the City"" - this is a show that sounds best turned up to eleven.  Highly recommended for fans of '70s arena rock.",1386892800,7,320,4.888888888888889
