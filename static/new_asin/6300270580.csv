296960,4,6300270580,"""Cleopatra Jones and the Casino of Gold"" was my initiation into the ""Blaxploitation"" film genre. In this film, Tamara Dobson stars as a statuesque African-American secret agent woman. She teams up with an Asian woman named Mi Ling (played by Tanny) in order to rescue two undercover agents from the clutches of the Dragon Lady (Stella Stevens), a casino-owning drug pusher. Written by William Tennant, the film is directed by Chuck Bail.
""Cleo"" is full of outrageous costumes, hip dialogue, action, and funky music composed by Dominic Frontiere (starting with the opening credits song, ""Playing with Fire""). There is a fair amount of graphic violence. Cleo is a fun character; she's sort of like an African-American female James Bond (in fact, I found the tone and pacing of this film to be similar to that of the Bond flicks of this time period). The film makes good use of its Far East setting.
Dobson gets solid support from the rest of the cast, but I especially loved Norman Fell (an actor best known as TV's Mr. Roper from ""Three's Company"") as Cleo's grouchy but likeable boss. Fell and Dobson have a really enjoyable chemistry in their scenes together.
""Cleo"" is a fascinating film that could, I imagine, inspire some lively analyses grounded in race, gender, economics, post-colonial politics, criminology, and other fields of inquiry. Or you could just enjoy it as a fun, slightly campy adventure flick with a kick-...heroine.",1024531200,12,1436,4.9875
296961,4,6300270580,"This sequel is that rare bird... one that is better than the original movie (CLEOPATRA JONES).  Largely because of the exotic setting (Hong Kong and Macao are more fun than East L.A., after all), and certainly because of the villainess, Stella Stevens.
Cleopatra Jones tends to find herself up against Evil White Lesbian dope queens, and Stella Stevens is certainly nicer to look at than Shelly Winters (in the original).  Her climatic fight scene ... with the foxy black Cleo is OVER THE TOP!  The ladies must have been covered with bruises after shooting this (NO stand-ins apparent!).
As for Stella's ""wild"" outfits, they are conservative compared to the title heroine's!
A ""must see"" for Blaxploitation fans!",1024272000,10,712,5.068376068376068
296962,3,6300270580,"The sequel to ""Cleopatra Jones"" benefits from the authentic location of Hong Kong and its good production design.  The story is almost the same as the original one, showing us Cleo fight against drug syndicate, of which mastermind, this time Stella Stevens, lives in a gorgeous casino.
You might remember Warner Brothers once produced ""Enter the Dragon"" featuring Bruce Lee, which became a worldwide hit, and probably this fact influenced the studio's judgment to shoot the film in Hong Kong.  The film is full of shoot-outs and kung-hu fights, but unfortunately, not as good as Lee's deadly fighting style, but still it is mildly entertaining.  The final action sequence, chain of good stunts using motorcycles running in a casino, with its riders shooting machineguns (!), is the showdown of the film, and though the film nearly gets so close to ludicurousness, still remains enjoyable as a whole.  And check out Stella Steven's outrageous costume.",1009843200,7,950,5.14935064935065

297113,4,6300270580,"I didn't like this sequel as much as the first Cleopatra Jones movie.  I was distracted by her unusual (almost mask-like) makeup. This movie is about 40 years old and it showcases a black, female, karate expert, no nonsense, positive law enforcement character. I deleted a star because of the violence.  But I still say; Do your stuff Cleopatra!!!",1425945600,,347,4.864406779661017
297114,4,6300270580,I saw this back in the day when it came out.  It's actually better than the first.  This is a movie to watch with friends and just laugh at how over the top it is.,1422748800,4,163,3.6285714285714286
297115,5,6300270580,"What a surprisingly great film. The story was interesting and the fight scenes were not as chessy as most 70's movies.  Unfortunately the DVD did not have any special features, I would have liked to learn more about the making of this film.  I highly recommend.",1410393600,4,261,4.6521739130434785

297120,5,6300270580,"I am a huge fan of Blaxploitation films and needed to add this to my collection as Tamara Dobson is such an underrated actress who also starred in the comical and topical Norman, Is that You with Michael Warren, Pearl Bailey, and Redd Foxx. A fun romp with Stella Stevens who chews her scenery not quite as much as Shelley Winters, but enough to make this a great add to the collection of black film",1404950400,4,399,4.333333333333333
297121,3,6300270580,Tamara and Stella are both watchable as always but the script is heavy on action and somewhat low on plot.  Great scenery in Hong Kong and (maybe) Macau.  Enjoyable to watch as pure entertainment,1396310400,3,195,4.705882352941177
297172,5,6300270580,"I love Cleopatra Jones and find both this film and her other film, simply titled 'Cleopatra Jones' to be full of action, fights, criminals and corruption, to be appealing.  Some folk find this film under review, to Over the top, but I don't really agree - anyway, it's Cleo that I love (Tamara Dobson 1947-2006).  I only wished there had been other 'Cleopatra Jones' films.",1394236800,3,373,4.723076923076923
297173,5,6300270580,"I had looked for this movie on DVD for a very long time. I give this a high rating because (1) I liked Tamara Dobson as Cleopatra Jones, (2) I loved her fashions in this film, and (3) although considered a blaxploitation film, it was one of few movies where a female (other than Pam Grier) was kicking butt.",1391731200,3,307,4.220338983050848
297174,5,6300270580,"If you're into Tamara Dobson, this is a must have. Unlike her first Cleopatra Jones character, this Cleo is way over the top.  The dialogue is cheesy and campy, her makeup is outrageously overdone. She changes costumes in every scene and not taking herself to serious, but having fun with the character. Her Wardrobe alone is worth seeing,designed by Giorgio Di Sant' Angelo one of the top designers of that era. The woman is a walking fashion show. All of this is why I love this movie. It's the 70's at it's best.",1388793600,4,515,4.537634408602151
297175,5,6300270580,"it's a pity Tamara Dobson didn't get to do more of these great films.  Okay, so I love Blackploitation films with Pam Grier and with Tamara Dobson only.  I like seeing a black woman show some guts and stand up for what's right.  Okay.  These films are full of violence, but good conquers all in the end, which I like, plus I get a big kick out of seeing women who are rough and tough.  Stella Stevens is exceptional in this movie though I wish her character hadn't been so disgusting and kinky when it comes to sex in the film.  I like her being tough and being the boss, but I don't like her being in the drug business nor her messing around with her adopted daughter.  Yet the big draw is beautiful, talented Tamara Dobson whom I admire for being so good at martial arts and I like seeing what outfit she'll wear next.  Honestly though, I like the first Cleopatra Jones movie the best yet this one has the advantage of showing scenes that were filmed outside of the United States and for those of us who can't afford to travel, it's a treat to see how other lands look.",1382313600,2,1071,4.241379310344827
297176,3,6300270580,"Emphasizing martial arts and Bondian adventure over blaxploitation, the big-budget ""Cleopatra Jones and the Casino of Gold"" (1975) is radically different from its predecessor . . . and slightly less fun. Fedora-clad Tamara Dobson gets down to business while Stella Stevens makes a more formidable adversary than Shelley Winters. This action-filled collaboration between Warner Brothers and Run Run Shaw takes full advantage of its Hong Kong setting.",1380326400,3,449,5.7164179104477615
297177,5,6300270580,Im in Love with this movie!70's movies are my favorite and they really tell a story. This movie is a must see!:-),1376092800,3,113,4.181818181818182
297178,4,6300270580,A pretty interesting entertaining sequel with a lot of action. Doesn't compare with the first film obviously but it was better than I recalled as to when I first rented the VHS cassette back in 1991. Glad it was finally made available for purchase in DVD format by WB. Here's hoping to many other future releases by these hard to obtain films.,1373760000,4,343,4.548387096774194
297179,5,6300270580,"Yes, another film from the 70s series that has great theme for its time. Great for the avid collector of this genre.",1370044800,2,116,4.318181818181818
297180,5,6300270580,Great addition to my Blaxploitation collection.  I had the first Cleo movie.  I finally got the other one!  RIP Tamara Dobson!,1365724800,3,126,4.904761904761905
297181,5,6300270580,"This movie is so fierce. Tamara Dobson played was a gorgeous badass detective. Reminds me of Coffy and Foxy Brown. Lots of beautiful, black female power. Cleo kept all her clothes on.",1364169600,4,183,4.75
297221,2,6300270580,My husband wanted to collect a copy this film.  The story and the acting are rather poor  Film quality is good.,1359936000,,111,4.238095238095238
297222,2,6300270580,"This old movie involved a black woman (Cleopatra Jones) and a Chinese kung-fu girl.  They smell something wrong going on
in the Casino.  They work in a team to solve the puzzle.
This film has a bad light/ camera effect.  The fighting scenes are short and not bloody at all.  The story line is good only for
coffee-break.  Of course, it is no comparison to an old 007 James Bond movie.",1353715200,,384,4.352112676056338
297223,4,6300270580,"Some things are frankly mystifying about this DVD release and the movie itself in terms of its high quality. In 1975, most film stock was pretty poor, especially for budget productions. Casino of Gold looks like an A-list production with great film quality, camera work, lighting, etc. and the DVD release is sharp as a tack. Someone somewhere really applied themselves to this transfer because I've seen Blu-ray releases of 70s films that don't look nearly as good as this. Worth every penny, you would be easily justified in thinking it's high-def if you saw it unawares.

We all know Tamara Dobson owned this role, but Norman Fell is terrific and under-used as her theoretical boss.

The DVD quality is so good I'm tempted to give 5 stars but ultimately this is a guilty pleasure, not high art. Strongly recommended though.",1319068800,13,826,4.851063829787234
297224,2,6300270580,"This movie isn't anywhere near as good as the original.  It isn't really a blaxploitaion movie at all.  It seems more like they were experimenting, trying to see if a black female lead could carry a non-black movie on her own.  It was a somewhat interesting movie, maybe for historical value, but not really entertaining at all.  A typical ""kung fu"" movie of the era.  The sad part was this character wasn't really the same one that I liked from the original movie.  And I don't think Ms. Dobson showed her hair at all throughout the movie, she wore hats the whole time.  I was so distracted trying to figure out what was wrong with her hair.",1304899200,,642,4.435897435897436
297225,4,6300270580,"The Amazonian Tamara Dobson returns as 'CLEOPATRA JONES' in this entertaining sequel to the original. Here we find our heroine lifted from the sleazy city streets of the U.S. to the glossy Casinos of Hong Kong.  The grittiness and somber mood of the original film is replaced by action packed comic book style set pieces as writer/producer William Tennant transforms Cleo into a seventies female Batman figure even introducing actress Ni Tren billed as Tanny as her Robin side kick.  The film is showered with martial arts action scenes and why not, it's also produced by Run Run Shaw who would also place the same bits into Hammer's production 'LEGEND OF THE 7 GOLDEN VAMPIRES' around the same time and also maintains the classy chop sockiness of 'ENTER THE DRAGON' . Ms. Dobson handles the role excellently and one of the highlights of the film is to see how each costume that she wears seem to get more outlandish as the proceedings go on.  Norman Fell looks tired and wasted as her police superior but the true standout is the beautiful Stella Stevens as Miss Big, the Dragon Lady.  While Shelley Winters chewed up the scenery in the original film, Stevens downplays the role making it more chilling. She also gets into the action in two superb fight sequences, one involving Shen Chan where after she has him tortured and then revived, introduces him to a sword fight to the death in a circle of swords and the inevitable showdown at the climax where she gives Dobson a run for her money in the hand to hand department.  She leaves such an impression that you don't seem to mind the cliched crack uttered by one of Cleo's buddies:  'That chick could bite Count Dracula on the neck and make him like it."" The brassy music score by Domenic Frontiere externalizes the comic book feel yet the photography by Alan Hume dazzles the eyes with bright colors and candy coated sets.  Director Chuck Bail directs the action briskly and really shows the talents of Tamara Dobson who unfortunately never pursued the character or her career. Warner Archive releases a beautiful 2.35 widescreen transfer with flawless color and great sound. Highly recommended to lovers of Saturday afternoon action flicks, the 'CLEOPATRA JONES' films will always hold a warm place in this fans heart.  Where else can you see an over 6Ft tall heroine kick butt and look so beautiful in the same scene?  Ms. Dobson, you were the best.",1296518400,9,2406,4.750599520383693
297226,4,6300270580,"The sequel to ""Cleopatra Jones"" outshines the original in virtually every respect.  Better story.  Better action.  Stella Stevens' Dragon Lady is way cooler than Shelley Winters' cartoonish Mommy in the first film.  Terrific use of the exotic locales of Hong Kong and Macao.  An ending that would make Peckinpah proud.  Plenty of tongue-in-cheek humor but not the outright campiness that scuttled ""Cleopatra Jones"".  Tamara Dobson, who rose above the silliness in the original, relishes the opportunities that she's given here and goes with it.  Now if they would only issue ""Norman...Is That You?"" with Dobson and Redd Foxx on DVD.",1294012800,2,632,5.25
297227,3,6300270580,"Unusually, this movie does not tend to suffer from ""sequelitis"" and is every bit as good as the first one.

Instead of the States, the scene of action is Hong Kong and Macau, and there's plenty more martial arts action from Cleopatra. The car chases are not bad, though not a patch on the first movie. Trivia note for Australian Ford fans: Australian-built Ford Falcons feature in the car chases; firstly a 1967 XR model, then a 1970 XW model.

Cleo's nemesis this time is played by Stella Stevens, and Albert Popwell features again.",1269388800,3,533,4.659574468085107
297228,3,6300270580,"Like most sequals, this movie is not of the same caliber of the original Cleopatra Jones. It is, however, entertaining, and collectors of Urban 70's movies will find this one a ""must have"" for the collection.",1142899200,3,208,4.805555555555555
297229,5,6300270580,"Typical blaxploitation from the 70's but with a great flair in that that leading roles are played by two hot butt kicking ethnic Princesses! Cleo knows her Kung Fu and uses it well. My fav is the asian hottie Mi. In one scene Mi has just finished showering and walks out into the living room in her bathrobe only to be greeted by a group of intruders. They proceed to tie her hands up but are in for real surprise. This lady is a deadly martial artist. With her hands still tied, she turns her bare legs and feet into deadly weapons overpowering the men with some explosive kicks. She is soon joined by Cleo and the girls finally finish the guys off leaving the baddies knocked out cold. Although a bit campy, this movie is a cult classic and a great sequel to the original.",1138320000,3,774,4.308219178082192
