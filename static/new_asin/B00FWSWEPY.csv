6034400,4,B00FWSWEPY,"Good concert.  Wish they played more of Ronnie's tunes, but still a great DVD.  R.I.P. Ronnie, you are missed, but never will be forgotten.",1389139200,2,139,4.75
6034401,5,B00FWSWEPY,"Being a Ronnie Montrose fan, from literally the first day that his debut album was released, through the Gamma years and beyond, there were many moments during this Tribute concert, which caused my hairs to stand.  From Sammy Hagar, to Bill Church, to Denny Carmassi, the original band, to the other guests, this show should not be missed.  If you're unfamiliar, or only slightly familiar with the work of Ronnie, this DVD is a must, so you can witness the talents of the man, who made rock and roll history",1388707200,2,507,4.622222222222222
6034402,4,B00FWSWEPY,"This is a great dvd of a live show featuring many of the people Ronnie touched  in his long career.  I did not recognize some of the players, others have been on my play list for years.  The standouts are definitely Neal Schon SHREDDING the guitar, Frank Hannon from Tesla, and Marc Bonilla playing with Gamma, they really nailed the old material, and I would definitely see them if they decided to tour with Marc standing in for Ronnie.  The group on stage for ""Frankenstein"" absolutely smoked it, right down to the dueling drums and what looked like 5 guitarists.  A stellar performance.

The production on this dvd was better than average, there were a lot less cutaway shots than on a lof of the new concert dvd's that are coming out lately, it gives a more realistic impression of being in the croud.  Also the 5.1 was excellent, my surround sound was hopping.

This is a great show, a must have.",1388275200,3,901,4.518518518518518
6034403,1,B00FWSWEPY,"I caught this tribute concert on AXS channel on Dish. Great show. Hagar and remaining Montrose band with Joe Satrianni playing guitar was really good. They played ""Rock the Nation, Make it Last, Rock Candy, Space Station #5, and Bad Motor Scooter. Some of my favorites. On this DVD however, I was extremely dissapointed because the only 2 songs with this lineup that made the cut was Spacestation #5 and Bad Motorscooter. Rock the Nation made it to the disc by some other lame lineup. WADAFA. Sammy Hagar says on the AXEs recording that nobody can play Rock Candy like Carpice the original drummer and Rock Candy was his measuring stick for all drummers. Why was it and Rock the Nation, Make it Last left off the DVD. I would not have spent the $27 for it had I been aware that the Creme of Ronnies music was on the cutting room floor. Unfortunatley now I'm am reduced to waiting for AXEs channel to re-show this tribute so I can DVR it and catch these songs. Again I say, WADAFA.",1388188800,23,980,4.45
6034404,3,B00FWSWEPY,"A glorious night honoring a guitar legend. Awesome sets from Gamma, Neal Schon/Steve Smith/Ricky Phillips and the highly anticipated set from Montrose featuring Satch on guitar. This video includes the full sets from the first two mentioned, but tragically includes only 2 of the 6 songs from the Montrose set. What happened to Rock Candy, Make It Last, Bad Motor Scooter or Connection? A tragedy that these are not included, so I have to deduct two stars .If you want to view them, go to Youtube. The videos are there in all their glory

The bonus disc does include some good soundstage footage featuring the last incarnation of Montrose playing with Bay Area alumni Frank Hannon,Eric Martin & Dave Meniketti.

Ronnie we love and miss you.",1387843200,19,740,4.865079365079365
6034410,3,B00FWSWEPY,I was about six feet center from the stage that amazing night. I had no idea what I was in store for. The Amazing set by Gamma and then Montrose. Everything in between and after was awesome also. But the Gamma And Montrose sets stand out. So when I opened this DVD and stuck it in there was nothing to tell me there was only 2 songs of the Montrose set. I was very disappointing and feel ripped off. The Montrose tribute was my top show out of the hundreds i have seen. I am sending it back and going to watch the You Tube Full Version.,1396828800,5,536,4.018691588785047
6034411,5,B00FWSWEPY,I thing it's one of the best put togeather tribute to one of the best rock hero  of our time. A must have for your collection.,1395014400,,126,3.8461538461538463
6034412,3,B00FWSWEPY,"The concert is above average, the credits are not clear on who the guests are in the bands but there are some great moments, Frankenstien with Jeff Watson is an incredible showcase, The Montrose members with Satriani should have been given more songs.
They also could have included more of Montrose life in the dvd.",1394668800,2,315,4.745454545454545
6034413,3,B00FWSWEPY,"I thought I have heard better versions especially the original Montrose songs. I wanted to get into this DVD, but while watching it, I thought about Chickenfoot's DVD version of ""Bad Motor Scooter"" and how much better that was. I will listen to this a 3rd time. That's the only way you find out if your original mood was not great that day, or if your friend wasn't enjoying it, so you didn't..",1394496000,,394,4.410958904109589
6034414,1,B00FWSWEPY,"I saw the original Montrose when they were just starting and am a fan, but this blows bad. Poor recording, poor videography, and poor production.  Sammy Hagar should have known better. I just do not understand how anyone thought this would honor Ronnie Montrose. Joe Satriani shredded it up for real.",1394236800,,300,4.882352941176471
6034415,4,B00FWSWEPY,Great to see all these different players.  Music was diverse and enjoyable.  Could have spent more time on the Montrose music and less on the Gamma music.,1392595200,,154,4.666666666666667
6034416,5,B00FWSWEPY,"Superb film and concert performance. Man did this bring back some great memories. Very sad that Ronnie is gone - but his colleagues and friends sure came together to make this a concert one to remember. Neal Shon and Sammy Hagar and Co just seem to be getting better....Joe Satriani also hit it out of the park. A lot of amazing artists pay tribute to one of the greatest guitarists ever, the late, great, Ronnie Montrose.",1392076800,,422,4.565789473684211
6034417,1,B00FWSWEPY,I have bought hundreds of concert DVD's online.  This is easily the worst.  The audio sounds like it's coming out of a litltle transistor radio.  It sounds like they shut Neal Schon's guitar off on the songs he appears on.  This release is aweful.,1390608000,,247,4.545454545454546
6034418,5,B00FWSWEPY,"A great DVD to own! The talent put together to remember Ronnie was epic. There are many songs Ronnie left us with, it's tough to cram them all into 1 DVD, but Neil and Steve, Sammy. Tesla, and many more did a great job. And the Bonus features are awesome too.",1389744000,,259,4.098039215686274
6034419,5,B00FWSWEPY,"I was at this show and I think they did a great job at capturing many very special moments. So many great guitar players all given each other a run for their money. Equal to a G3 or G4 Guitarfest and then some.

Excellent video footage and killer audio. Ronnie was there and I'm sure he was smiling huge.

Neil Schon, Frank Hannon, Mark Bonila, Jeff Watson, Tommy Thayer just for a few guitar players, so many great musicians all night long. Truly a pleasure and The Man himself well represented.

Thank you",1389571200,2,507,4.43010752688172

CONCERT FOR RONNIE MONTROSE - DVD
$26.00
A Celebration of His Life in Music

Concert video, Regency Ballroom, April 27, 2012, mixed in 5.1 surround sound
On April 27, 2012 at the Regecy Ballroom in San Francisco artists whom Ronnie Montrose collaborated with, mentored and produced came together to honor the Father of American Hard Rock. It was a night of music Ronnie composed and created classic signature guitar riffs for and it featured performances from a star-studded lineup of guests  including alumni from both of Ronnies best known projects, Montrose and Gamma. This is the live DVD that captured that event.

The surviving original members of the Montrose band  Sammy Hagar, bassist Bill Electric Church and drummer Denny Carmassi took the stage with Hagars Chickenfoot bandmate Joe Satriani subbing in on guitar, and delivered a powerful, well-received set that featured Montrose staples like Space Station No. 5, Bad Motor Scooter and of course, Rock Candy.",1472428800,,1076,5.090909090909091
8618976,5,B00FWSWEPY,"Hello, I am quite partial because I am Leighsa Montrose, Ronnie's wife.  I am certain Ronnie would be honored to be acknowledged for his contribution to Hard Rock music.  I thank each and everyone who came and played that amazing evening.

On a major side note.  It pains me (as I know it would Ronnie) to see individuals selling this dvd at these outrageous prices.  You are more than welcome to purchase it on his website: www. RonnieMontrose.com for $26.  That will and always has been the price.  Music should be available to anyone who wants it.

Peace",1449792000,3,557,4.612244897959184
8618977,1,B00FWSWEPY,"I got the first time was not Happy with my purchase. There was nothing wrong with The DVD itself I just wasn't happy with the concert itself which isn't anyone's fault except who put it together. There were some good points but most likely won't watch it ever again.bagsin not the fault of Amazon.
Thank you",1436313600,,307,4.5
8618978,4,B00FWSWEPY,"This is is quite a good concert! However, as of this moment, paying more than $150 for it is purely for the wealthy.

For those of us with Dish Network, this concert can be rented for free; which is how I watched it :)",1420416000,,218,3.9545454545454546
8618979,3,B00FWSWEPY,"This could have been so much better with the situation at hand, it could have made for some fantastic viewing considering this is a tribute to a guitar great who passed away under horrible circumstances. Instead, the producers appeared to have rushed this project, simply thrown together. There are some great moments for sure, just not enough of them. Still a must for Montrose fans! The Gamma reunion is a highlight for sure!",1408320000,,427,4.863013698630137

8618981,5,B00FWSWEPY,"A grand tribute to one of the world's greatest guitar players. Growing up in the Bay Area in the 70's, you heard Montrose everywhere. His scintillating guitar riffs backed by a powerful band. Rock n' Roll at it's finest.
Although this show could have been longer, ti was nice to see some of Ronnie's friends get together to pay tribute to him. Opening with Neal Schon of Journey performing from Ronnie's first solo album Open Fire,  you knew you were in for a night of powerful music.
Featuring performances from Friends of Ronnie and concluding with performances by Gamma and the original Montrose band with Joe Satriani on guitar. It was a night that any Ronnie Montrose fan would enjoy.
Other performers included Eric Martin, Ricky Phillips, Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer of Kiss, Steve Smith, Tesla & Jeff Watson.
Organizing the entire event was the great Sammy Hagar for his old friend.
So, slap in this DVD, crank up the volume and enjoy the music of the late, great Ronnie Montrose.",1399334400,,988,4.744186046511628
