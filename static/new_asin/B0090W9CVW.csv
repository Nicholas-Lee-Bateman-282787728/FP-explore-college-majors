Amazing film with a wonderful ensemble of young actors. The story blew me away. Very well told, truly something different...not a predictable ending at all.
Make sure you see this film.
I can't wait to see the next production by these folks.",1350691200,,343,4.548387096774194

8533549,5,B0090W9CVW,this film is a good movie to have as part of your dvd collection. Nick Dalmacy is a director to look for with other films,1360281600,,121,3.88
8533550,5,B0090W9CVW,"This film was a breath of fresh air in the way that it departed from many of the all too trite films which deficiently depict the good ol urban love tale. Dalmacy has managed to keep the balance between affection, humor, and sometimes outright physical agression; making for a format that enhances instead of robs the viewers of a good story. The directing is up to par. The script pulls you in as you see the the love interests jump thru ,seemingly , innumerable hoops to salvage the relationship that has only just been commenced. There are as many antagonists as there are heros in this one. Dalmacy comes out as the savior for those of us who are tired of the generic nonsense that's out there and need to see something inspiring. The ratings the film has received across the country are well deserved.",1358035200,,806,4.56551724137931
8533551,5,B0090W9CVW,"This is a true story for so many women, including myself.  I experienced domestic violence in my past relationships!.  And i can relate to this move first-hand in so many ways.  This movie is recommended for anyone who may be a victim of domestic violence or curious to wanting to know about domestic violence.  My advice to anyone who is going through domestic violence is to please get help and get out of the relationship.  Mr. Nick Dalmacy thanks for making this powerful movie and putting together a true wake-up call not just for the black community, but any race of people thats experiencing the same thing.",1354752000,,614,4.700934579439252
