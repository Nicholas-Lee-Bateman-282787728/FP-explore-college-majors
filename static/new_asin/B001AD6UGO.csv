3447110,5,B001AD6UGO,This is an excellent example of the genre. An old-fashion horror film that's just plain scary. Christopher Lee's chilling portrayal rivals the creepiness of Michael Myers.,1353974400,,171,5.615384615384615
3447111,2,B001AD6UGO,"Ok, so this one isn't that bad....but you have to ask yourself would you watch this is you weren't a Christopher Lee fan and the answer is probably going to be a resounding ""No"".

The idea is fairly original,a villain who embalms his victims"" for his ""live theatre"", but the film sags in places from far too much padding which includes overlong scenes of a theatre troupe performing their show.

Also the quality of the print on this release is pretty awful, which adds to the low, low budget feel of the film. The print is badly scratched, dull (lacking the crispness of a really good B&W movie) and it is also presented in a badly panned and scanned format. (Ok I'm being picky here but ristopher Le in stle of the Living Dea.)

And if you want to see really bad acting, Donald Sutherland really stands out amongst the cast of unknowns, getting to giving not one but two awful performances as he appears as two characters for some unexplained reason. From these performances you'd never guess that within a few years he'd be a major Hollywood star.

Christopher Lee is, as usual, on top form as Count Drago. Overall Castle Of The Living Dead is a nice idea but badly done.",1340064000,,1174,4.497652582159624
3447112,1,B001AD6UGO,"This seems like a copy someone made themselves and burned to DVD.  This has to be the worst presentation of any film I've ever seen.  That's really unfortunate because the movie is actually quite good.

The DVD boots to a low quality static menu listing the contents of the disc.  I'm guessing most folks that aren't too tech savvy will be stumped at this point.  It's not clear which entry is the movie at first. The movie is actually the last entry.

The video quality is almost unwatchable.  My wife and I enjoy watching these old films and call this type of presentation a ""crinkly crack"" since that's what you get on the screen or thru the speakers and sometimes both.

The movie itself is a pleasant surprise for Christopher Lee Fans.",1325203200,2,740,4.553030303030303
3447113,4,B001AD6UGO,"If you like old movies, this is a great one! It's just the wrong aspect ratio. I've been trying to find a copy to buy for years, but nobody has the widescreen version that airs on TCM every so often. I went to TCM's website and bought a copy of it there, thinking it was the same version. It turned out to be this particular copy and transfer. I then turned around and sold it at a yardsale because it was in the wrong aspect ratio.",1282694400,,432,4.034883720930233
3447114,3,B001AD6UGO,"There are B/w movies that are a classic and others that are just down right corney, and just because it has a majar star in it, or I should say just because the leading role is held by someone that also has the leading role in a good classic film, Does not mean that the movie is going to be any good.
This film falls in the middle with me. Three stars. I will view it again given the time and see if my review changes. Sometimes you can go into things expecting one thing and getting another, and thus you don't give it a fair review.",1259971200,,535,4.009345794392523
3447115,3,B001AD6UGO,"For my next Christopher Lee Euroshock review, I'll start at the beginning. CASTLE OF THE LIVING DEAD was the first of his ""European vacation"" movies that I had ever come across. I saw it in a drive-in back in the late 60s along with several other ""dubbed horrors"" as we called them. I remembered it because unlike most of the other movies that were featured, this one was in black and white and it was genuinely odd. It isn't a true horror film but more of a Gothic mystery with elements of the grotesque included. There are a few murders but no gore, a truly creepy servant (Europeans LOVE creepy servants), and a restrained but effective performance from Lee as a Count who can instantly embalm animals (and people). The remarkable menagerie that inhabit his castle is truly effective.

Set in the late 18th century, this 1964 movie was shot on location at a castle in Bomarzo, Italy with large grotesque stone creatures on the grounds that the filmmakers took good advantage of. The music is effective and in its original aspect ratio the photography was quite striking (more about that later). Low budget to be sure but producer Paul Maslansky makes the most of it. CASTLE has gained latter day notoriety because it marks the debut of actor Donald Sutherland playing two roles (a soldier and a witch!). In gratitude Sutherland named his son Kiefer after the film's director (Warren Kiefer). It also is noteworthy for employing second unit director Michael Reeves (WITCHFINDER GENERAL) who appears briefly with his girlfriend as part of the Count's collection.

A word or two about this DVD transfer. Sinister Cinema is to be commended for making this rare title available to the public. However their copy comes from a 16mm American International television print which is in the wrong aspect ratio (fullscreen). You can clearly see this in the opening credits when Christoper Lee's name looks like RISTOPHER LE. The rest of the film is framed fairly well and the condition of the print is remarkably good. It's just a shame that for the present there is no restored, widescreen version like the one I saw at the drive-in. Hopefully that will be remedied (if they can do THE SHE BEAST they should do this one) before too long as it would be far more effective to see it the way it was intended to be seen. That would warrant a full 4 stars.

UPDATE: There is an absolutely pristine original ratio DVD available through anazon.uk (see my review there). Unfortunately it's Region 2 only which means without an all region DVD player you can't play it. Hopefully a Region 1 copy will be released here one day.",1253750400,10,2609,4.72967032967033
3447116,3,B001AD6UGO,"First a word about privately manufactured DVDs--

Often, these transfers are of a quality similar to budget box brands. The films themselves are unrestored and rarely pristine yet still watchable (unless there's an inordinate number of repaired breaks). Extras are non-existent and inclusion of artwork or liner notes varies by manufacturer. These niche companies provide a valuable outlet for movies absolutely unavailable anywhere else, plus their prices are often reasonable.

SINISTER CINEMA's dub of the slow-moving Euro-made CASTLE OF THE LIVING DEAD is typically average. In Canadian Donald Sutherland's big screen debut he plays two roles (Sgt. Paul  and the witch), plus he cameos as an audience member. Chris Lee is in top form as the demented Count Drago.

FILM SYNOPSIS--
An atmospheric Gothic piece set in early 18th Century Europe. The count's strange old castle is visited by an invited performance group. Soon the actors begin dying and an ugly old witch (Sutherland) says these deaths are caused by a curse, but we know better! Count Drago is both a taxidermist and a bit of a tinkerer-- he's created a process that instantly embalms the living, and he just loves adding to his strange little menagerie of stuffed critters.

When not stumbling down ill-lit corridors with some unfortunate victim, watch for the heroic dwarf and his gigantic deaf-mute sidekick.

3447118,4,B001AD6UGO,"This movie is worth buying due to at least four considerations: (1) Christopher Lee plays a nice character (the scene in which he appears for the first time and introduce himself to his ""guests"" should remind you his appearance in the classic Terence Fisher's Dracula!), (2) the movie is a good representative of the Italian gothic cinema from the 1960's, (3) the story offers a variation in the theme about a mad scientist and the living dead, and (4) is a must have for terror collectionists of these era. Note, however that this Sinister Cinema release is a burned copy, may be from some VHS material. The transfer is ok (the audio is a bit more dissapointing) and good enough until a more professional release is available. Good for the price.",1227571200,27,747,4.709923664122138

3447120,4,B001AD6UGO,"Castle Of The Living Dead is a interesting piece of gothic Italian horror from 1964. Starring Christopher Lee and Donald Sutherland. Its the 19th century and somewhere in France a band of gypsy circus performers travel to a old castle to entertain for the Count there. One by one Count Drago kills off the group for his own experiments in preserving the dead without chemicals or traditional mummification, using a black magic of sorts.
The movie isn't so much about the plot as it is the strange and interesting characters. You have Donald Sutherland playing two different roles. One, a old hag/witch who pop ups throughout the film spouting off cryptic warnings and second, a French police Sgt who is humorous in his mannerism and dialog.
Then you have the band of gypsies
made up of a dwarf, a mute, a harlequin, a beautiful woman and several other performers who all seem to have their own quirky personality.
And of course, there is the great Christopher Lee as Count Drago who is always fun to watch and is as evil as ever.
The film has that gothic look that only Italian films seemed to be able to achieve back then and a charm onto itself. Its not one of Christopher Lee better known film nor his best, but its worth buying this and has a great re-watch factor.",1446422400,,1269,4.5701754385964914

3447127,2,B001AD6UGO,"This Italian-French co-production falls into the so-bad-it's good category. It stars Christopher Lee (as Count Drago) and was Donald Sutherlands first feature. The Canadian actor has a triple role!
The co-director and co-scriptwriter was Warren Kiefer. (Yes, Kiefer Sutherland was named after him.)
Circa 1815 in Italy, a troupe of five traveling players is commissioned for a private performance at scientist Dragos castle, where they are shocked to discover an incredible petrified world.
Sutherland is credited in IMDb as Sgt. Paul / The witch / The old man. Paul is a dimwitted provincial police officer, and Sutherlands own voice is overdubbed. Of course, for the witch role, he cross-dresses and wears the requisite false nose and warts. A womans voice is overdubbed, and her lines are entirely in rhyme. But who is the old man? The only point where I can figure that Sutherland could be in this role is at the very beginning, where he may be briefly playing a highwayman, with his back to the camera, in a long shot. (Of course, some scenes may be missing from the version I watched on Amazon Instant Video.)
Lee, wearing what may be the shabbiest-looking makeup of his entire career, also overdubbed his own voice. His reading of the biblical funeral liturgy at one point is, to say the least, eye-popping.
Actors Philippe Leroy and Luciano Pigozzi are also familiar faces. The latter will at least be recognizable to genre fans.
Another among three co-directors was Michael Reeves, who -- before dying of a barbiturate O.D. at age 25 -- also helmed She-Beast, The Sorcerers, and his masterpiece, The Conqueror Worm.
In between making pedestrian movies like Castle of the Living Dead, cinematographer Aldo Tonti also worked with Fellini, Huston, Rossellini, King Vidor, and Visconti.
CotLD was made in central Italy at the 15th-century Odescalchi Castle and among the huge, grotesque 16th-century stone statues of the Bomarzo Monster Garden.
Christopher Lee once said in an interview: It was a very surrealist type of picture.",1383264000,3,2034,5.092814371257485
3447128,3,B001AD6UGO,I bought this movie because I love movies with Christopher Lee in it. But the movie was a little slow and it kind of reminded me of House of Wax but an older version.,1378512000,,166,3.911764705882353
8276887,3,B001AD6UGO,this is the film that gave Donald Sutherland his break.  He plays a dual role in this. He named his son after the director for giving him the break.,1515542400,,148,4.103448275862069

8276892,4,B001AD6UGO,"I made a scene-by-scene comparison of the Odeon PAL with the Sinister DVD and unfortunately found some missing lines of Germani/Leroy dialogue at 25:18 PAL and, worse, over four minutes missing at 47:11 PAL. The latter includes two shots of Sutherland and his ""police"" arriving at the castle, Lee and Leroy greeting them, Leroy continuing to talk with them, Sutherland (sort-of comically) interacting with his men, the funeral procession winding through the graveyard, and Lee's grave-side speech--all missing, which is actually a big chunk of Sutherland's role as the Sergeant. It's nice to have the Odeon transfer; although very dark in spots, it is generally crisp and in the correct 1.78 ratio. Whatever else you can say about the wretched Sinister transfer (fuzzy throughout and full-screen), it clocks in at 1:29:55 and is, as far as I know, complete.

Also there's another film made in the early 1990's at this same castle with the large crazy statuary on the grounds. This was also Donald Sutherland's first movie. He plays both an old witch and a policeman in it. I definitely prefered him as the witch, reminded me of something out of Monty Python. The little dwarf was cool, too, as was the cute kitty who likes to drink cognac. I'd love someday to see this movie cleaned up and made to fit modern t.v. screens.

I would perhaps recommend the the Odeon edition in R2 from the U.K.  It is from an original print, is in its correct OAR, and looks great.  It even has a trailer.  The only drawback is there is a possibility that that the U.K. version is missing some footage.  There is also a French edition from Artus Films which is uncut and English friendly for the feature only but not the extras.  I will update when I get a chance to compare them.
