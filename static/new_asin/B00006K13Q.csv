1783513,5,B00006K13Q,"This DVD is like an encyclopedia of martial arts exercises. If it's good for martial arts training, it's probably in this collection, especially when it comes to flexibility, which gets heavy emphasis. What I like even more than the huge number of exercises is the way the menu is set up. Exercises are grouped so you can skip to the set that you need without having to wade through everything on the disc. As an instructor, this makes it very easy for me to refresh my memory quickly before a class or warm-up. Just pop the disc in, skip to the section I need and go. A great resource for instructors and for students who train at home or want to.",1072396800,30,648,4.363636363636363

7970922,1,B00006K13Q,"I own three other Turtle Press DVDs and this one I am highly disappointed in.  They did not describe this once clearly to me, because this was not what I was expecting; they should have left it was a book because with how they have it organized you will have to do a large amount of starting, stopping, and fast forwarding to skip all of the unnecessary filler.  Some of the exercises they describe doing you are unable to do in your home.  I personally do not recommend this DVD.  If people are looking to become very flexible I would recommend the Ultimate Flexibility DVD because it has greatly increased mine.",1266796800,8,613,4.495495495495495
7970923,5,B00006K13Q,"Sang H. Kim does a fabulous job describing the ""What, Where and How to's"" of 9 basic essentials to improve one's martial arts skills.  This DVD is a must have for the serious martial artist!  The wealth of information and practical exercise suggestions is worth far more than the price I paid for the video! There's also some added bonus features!

7970924,4,B00006K13Q,"I've studied martial arts and wanted to get back into training.  For some reason I thought this was going to be a 'workout' video with someone guiding me through a complete workout.  What it actually contains is a series of excellent excercises to help you hone your skills on a particular move or apsect of your training, like stamina.  Anyone who is focusing on a particular part of your training should buy this dvd as many of the exercises are challenging, even for the seasoned martial artist; however, for someone who wants to train without a dojo, well--that's not what this is.",1175644800,6,585,4.715686274509804
7970925,3,B00006K13Q,"This DVD was not clearly described when I purchased it, and it was not what I was expecting when I watched it. I think it could be beneficial, but there is a lot of filler and requires fast-forwarding through some parts. I don't think it's really worth what I paid for it.",1163116800,4,272,4.25
7970926,5,B00006K13Q,"This dvd has a great selection of exercises, ranging from the easy, do them in class all the time type to some that I'd love to be able to do and am working up to. The flexibility section is especially good, with a ton of exercises to improve your kicking height and strength. This is one that I'll be able to keep coming back to and finding new challenges for a good long time.",1137715200,9,378,4.121621621621622
7970927,3,B00006K13Q,"Some of the excercises are very helpful and useful but some of them are just filler. The weight lifting excercises are a good example of the filler. The excercises are shown but nothing is put in to workouts.

I have to admit though, the stretching/flexability section is great.",1097884800,15,278,4.791666666666667
