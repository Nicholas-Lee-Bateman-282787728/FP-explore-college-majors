8338290,5,B001RMQJU0,"Love the 7 artist videos I have from this company.  They are the best quality childrens' educational videos on art I've seen.
I would like to order the presidents series but I wish they didn't cost so much.",1440979200,,206,4.421052631578948
8338291,4,B001RMQJU0,"I was worried that this video, accompanying the book of the same name, would be too silly or trivial, but I actually enjoyed its presentation very much.  It's a bit cartoony in places, but it really helped cement the identity of this artist in my kids' minds (they're 3.5 and 6.5).  I also enjoyed its lengthy treatment of the relationships among the Impressionists, particularly between Cassatt and Degas.  It's been a pleasant intro to art history for them, and for me as their homeschooling mama.  Considering I have no art background to speak of, Venezia's book and this DVD have been fun, helpful and educational for ALL of us!",1311638400,,632,4.770642201834862
8338292,5,B001RMQJU0,"This is an excellent addition to the Getting To Know DVD series. Not only do we learn a lot about Mary Cassatt, but the video also does a pretty good job of covering the Impressionists. It's a useful art history tool for kids.",1235433600,,226,4.27906976744186
