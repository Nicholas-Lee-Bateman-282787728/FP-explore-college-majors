7990086,3,B000098ZRY,"As a kid in the early 50's I used to see DICK TRACY shown on TV, but it came on at 11 pm where I lived.  My parents forbade me staying up late to watch a show devoted to a favorite comic strip character.  Years earlier my father got me hooked on Tracy by reading the comic strips to me.  When I grew up I collected Tracy comic books, watched the Tracy movie serials of the 30's, and bought VHS copies of those serials and the grade B movies of the 40's. When I saw that some of those old TV shows were now available on DVD, I bought a set.  Ralph Byrd who played Tracy in the serials resumed the role for TV.  Well, I think I would have loved this DVD had I seen it as the 9 year old I was back then, thoroughly fascinated by the Tracy character.  Now, many years later, I have to admit that the production quality, acting, plots, settings, everything that makes up a ""good film"" are sorely lacking.  The shows have not been ""restored"" visually to comparable current day quality.  But the important thing is that the DVD at long last satisfied my curiosity about the TV shows I missed.  Maybe I might have been better off dreaming about what I missed.",1372723200,2,1151,4.171945701357466
7990087,2,B000098ZRY,"from what i have seen of a couple of the cliffhanger serials, their lighter, straightforward crime solving is good.  get those.  i enjoyed Dick Tracy Returns which was the second one.  go for that if you think you would try a cliffhanger serial.  i didn't go for the whole hypnotized guy in the first one.  ralph byrd does a decent job as a detective and who seems like he would have been  a nice guy off camera who does a decent job.",1366848000,,434,4.2317073170731705

7990089,3,B000098ZRY,"This dvd features four episodes from the 1950s TV show of ""Dick Tracy.""  This was a very low budget show and you can tell.  There are very few sets and action pieces (usually one major action sequence towards the end of each episode) while the majority of time is filled with ongoing dialog.  I didn't mind, but others may find it to be very boring.  Each episode runs about 25 minutes.  Ralph Byrd, who played Dick Tracy in earlier serials and some films, returns as the character.  I'm a big fan of his earlier stuff, so it was great to see him as Tracy one last time.  Byrd died in 1952, so the show only lasted two years.

The V/A quality on this disc resembles that of an EP vhs tape.  Sound is low and slightly muffled, but with the lack of music, it's easy to hear if you just turn up the volume.  Video is soft, lacking detail and contrast is off at times.  There is an Alpha watermark on the bottom right of the screen for a few seconds at the end of each episode.  Not annoying, but is noticeable.

Fans of DT may want to check this out, but if you're new to the DT world, I recommend Dick Tracy Vs Gruesome (film) or one of the older serials.

On a side note, I emailed Alpha to see if any future volumes were planned, and unfortunately they are not.",1196121600,4,1261,4.1570247933884295
