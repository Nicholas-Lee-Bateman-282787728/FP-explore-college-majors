8464242,5,B000094FEF,"Look, Hong Kong comedy can be really, really weird and awkward and hokey.  In a way I've had to get used to it for the movies I watch, but in this movie it's so well done that this might be the funniest HK movie I've ever seen.  It's a Sammo Hung movie all the way (star and director) and he never disappoints.  This is easily one of his best movies.  It's also fitting this features Richard Ng, possibly the funniest actor I've ever seen in an HK movie.  This is more than a comedy though.  The action is truly A-level and will not disappoint.  Some really great stuff that I haven't seen before.  Just as an example, for both the comedy and the action, loved the entire nightclub sequence early in the movie.

This dvd version is just like Point of No Return (aka Touch and Go).  Simple, widescreen but not anamorphic, with one trailer.  Subtitles work fine, though I feel a few lines weren't translated at all.",1356912000,,913,4.375
