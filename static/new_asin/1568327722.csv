7796886,5,1568327722,wish it came on dvd,1425081600,,19,3.0
7796887,3,1568327722,"I have several exercise videos and use them in rotation - the content of this one is good but the sound is awful - the music is so intrusive that I have trouble hearing the instructor; if I turn the sound up, the music gets louder and I still can't hear her. Can't say my thighs have improved dramatically, but that's probably my fault!",1346716800,,336,4.265625
7796888,5,1568327722,I love this tape.  If you're looking to improve your lower body i recommend this if you have VHS.  I only wish this version come on DVD.  There are other Thighs of Steel on DVD but not this exact one.,1289088000,,200,3.95
7796889,5,1568327722,This is a great video for anyone wanting to tone their thighs.  It's you get a good cardio workout in the process.  The only downside is it doesn't come in DVD form. There is another Thighs of steel DVD out there but it's not the same.,1278720000,,235,4.086956521739131
7796890,5,1568327722,"The power of this workout is in the leg lifts. You lay on your side and lift your legs up and down until they go into cardiac leg arrest. I've been doing floor work for awhile. I'm over 200lbs, but I'm grooving with my floor work as I have lost 30lbs. over the past 2 months. I'm working my butt off, and I'm impressively stronger now; but I find the side leg lifts to be the most challenging muscle toning work for me. That could be due to my weight. I don't know, but all I do know is that I can hang with all other floor work with no problems, and the side leg lifts is most challenging for me.

I haven't mastered this unit yet, but I'm determined to, because I believe that once I've mastered it, I will be ready for Joanie Greggains: ""Lean Legs"", the scariest leg workout I ever seen in my life. Side leg lifts can really strengthen your legs. However, I'm not interested in the aerobic part, not just because it's a bore, but mainly because I do so much other types of aerobics. So I recorded the leg toning part onto another tape and do only that. I personally think it's stupid to combine aerobics with leg or bun toning unless it's total body including the arms and abs. This is a 1 hour workout with the aerobics. After an hour you have to work your abs and arms. Stupid. This is why I skip the aerobics. It's dumb.",1249776000,,1326,4.159533073929961
7796891,5,1568327722,"Tamilee Webb, Donna Richardson and Tracy York, who drove us breathless in PLATINUM BUNS OF STEEL 2000, are at in again in this exercise video, PLATINUM SERIES THIGHS OF STEEL 2000.  And judging from the fantastic shape they are in, one would be wise to buy both tapes.

Tamilee, Donna and Tracy will take you to the limit in THIGHS OF STEEL 2000 but considering the results, you will be glad you joined them.

At first I wasn't so sure I would be glad I picked up PLATINUM SERIES THIGHS OF STEEL 2000, however.  As the three ladies walk on camera to introduce themselves, lead instructor Tamilee Webb is wearing a one-piece exercise garment that seems to reveal little of the incredible body she shows off in other workout videos.  Thankfully, the gorgeous Donna Richardson sports a two-piece outfit including eye-widening cleavage she happily bounces about throughout the tape.  But as a long-time admirer of Tamilee Webb, seeing even the gorgeous, younger Donna Richardson looking so sexy is not enough to make up for Tamilee's sudden burst of modesty.

But - or should I say, but(t) - the first time Tamilee Webb turns away from the camera in PLATINUM SERIES THIGHS OF STEEL 2000, her outfit's full-cheeks thong restores my faith!  And throughout the tape, Tamilee treats us to a number of lingering looks at her blossoming buttocks.  Even Donna Richardson cracks (tee-hee) a subtle joke about the view, as she is behind (tee-hee, again) Tamilee for most of the video getting a constant view of Ms. Webb's big beautiful bottom.

In fact, Donna Richardson laughs and smiles throughout PLATINUM SERIES THIGHS OF STEEL 2000.  I keep checking to see if the other two girls are tickling her.

You have to feel bad for Tracy York, a pleasant woman who is certainly attractive in her own right but out of her league alongside knockouts Tamilee Webb and Donna Richardson.  Even if Tracy were wearing just a stripper's g-string, it would be a thankless task trying to compete with Tamilee's bulbous backside and Donna's great divide.

PLATINUM SERIES THIGHS OF STEEL 2000 exercises your thighs - and your eyeballs - thanks to Tamilee Webb's sweet cheeks and Donna Richardson's abounding bosoms.  But(t) especially Tamilee Webb's fine behind.",1161907200,3,2235,4.906914893617022
7796892,1,1568327722,"I was very disappointed with this video.  After the first 10 minutes, I wanted a refund.  This one by far must be Tamilee Webb's worst.  I was accustomed to her earlier videos where she was the only instructor in the video and there was very little aerobics.  This tape has 2 instructors in addition to Tamilee Webb and places too much emphasis on aerobics.  If you enjoy aerobics, this tape is for you.  If you prefer toning without aerobics, this video is not for you.",992736000,8,470,4.470588235294118
