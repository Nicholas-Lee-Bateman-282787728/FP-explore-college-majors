The film is only 14 years old, but feels much older. It has a cheesy soundtrack and corny narration. The documentary begins with a birder telling his grandson about bird-watching (replete with ""golly, gee"" dialogue). I'm so glad wildlife documentaries have developed better filming techniques and cinematography since this one came out. It's too bad nobody has done a more recent take on raptors.",1257724800,3,864,8.010416666666666

7995406,4,B0000A1HT1,"Well documented and informative,but could have been moreso.
Recommended viewing to anyone interested in basic info.",1188259200,2,115,6.25
7995407,3,B0000A1HT1,"The film quality is good for a home movie, but with a lot of old, grainy film footage of predatory birds from the movie projector days. It still is interesting. I found it a little too technical, with too few good sequences of bird flight and observance. More for a bird identification enthusiast.  Doesn't come close to David Attenborough's 'Life of Birds'.",1150502400,9,358,4.774193548387097
7995408,5,B0000A1HT1,"I totally agree with the previous reviewers. Spectacular footage,

beautiful too. The commentary is marvellous and accessible to all

ages. And you can't beat the price either.

This is not a good video for identifying migrating raptors; it's

much more than that. For one thing, it has the best active hunting

shots I have seen.",1149465600,,330,4.927272727272728
7995409,5,B0000A1HT1,Species by species footage and facts of raptors including owls. The footage is just incredible. Tips on finding birds and observing birds and you can't beat the price of the DVD.,1113436800,16,178,4.774193548387097
