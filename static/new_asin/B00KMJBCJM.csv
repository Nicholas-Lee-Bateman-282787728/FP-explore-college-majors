6433735,5,B00KMJBCJM,"What a strange double-feature!  But it's mostly pretty good.  The commonality must be that both stories are quite outrageous fantasies, but otherwise they are several worlds apart.
1.  The Peter O'Toole -- Sophia Loren -- James Coco ""Man of La Mancha"" is quite simply a masterpiece of the film-maker's art, creating a coherent tale from what must now be regarded as a difficult and highly episodic four-centuries-old novel, albeit working from the wonderful stage version, presenting much of its complexity by effective layering of different plot-lines.  O'Toole is brilliant, as is to be expected of him, Loren and Coco and the rest of the cast scarcely less.  In brief, if you haven't seen it, you're in for a treat.
2.  ""The Fantasticks"" on the other hand is completely a mid-twentieth-century product, dreamed up by its authors and thrown together at the off-Broadway Sullivan Street Theatre, where it proceeded to run for decades on end.  This play MADE the Off-Broadway phenomenon, so much so that a derivative called off-off-Broadway had to be invented, and it set some amazing records along the way.
""The Fantasticks"" is a wonderful play, somewhat resembling Thornton Wilder's ""Our Town"" in that it features a small core cast and little by way of technical appurtenances.  The film is on the whole better than just okay, certainly worth a look as what we used to call ""the flip side"" of the main feature.  Its semi-realistic setting sort of works, but would be better without the clouds and mountains in the background.  And if I had the estimable  Joel Grey on tap, I'd have wanted him as El Gallo.  Other than that boggle, the cast is quite good.",1419206400,10,1656,4.896057347670251
6433736,2,B00KMJBCJM,Very poor quality ... had to send it back as it would not start up to play.  Will see how the replacement works.,1410739200,2,112,3.869565217391304

6433738,3,B00KMJBCJM,"Man of La Mancha - fantastic very underrated musical.  Loved it, sang with the songs and cried at the end.  Fantasticks - BORING.  Music was OK but some of the scenes were out of a bad pizza nightmare and I almost fell asleep watching it.  So - 5 stars for Man of La Mancha, 1 for Fantasticks (which wasn't fantastic and where did they get that name from anyway??).",1469145600,,365,4.246376811594203
6433739,5,B00KMJBCJM,"Loved The Fantasticks! Great musical, fun adaptation. Loved El Gallo (He was like a mix of Cary Elwys, David Bowie with a little Johnny Depp thrown in.) Loved his singing, too. Dancing in it is beautiful and fun.

8660051,1,B00KMJBCJM,"I had been delighted to see a professional stage version of Man of LaMancha in the 1960's in Chicago and was eagerly awaiting a screen adaptation. Boy was I ever disappointed. How? Let me count the ways. First of all, casting Peter O'Toole as Don Quixote was one of the worst casting jobs ever. Secondly, the man couldn't sing a lick. So the big number, The Impossible Dream, fell completely flat. I'd have been surprised if It ever sold any records. Then, the movie version of one of my favorite stage shows The Fantasticks, also was totally wrong. It lost a lot of the humor of the original and even Joel Gray as the stage manager couldn't save it. Then they cut out about half the songs, and the Try to Remember opening number, which sets the stage for the whole story, was left off. What were the people in Hollywood trying to do or even thinking about with these two misfits. I have a habit of buying soundtrack albums of shows i like, but i'll pass on these two, thank you and stick with the original cast ablums on both.",1530057600,,1027,4.382198952879581
8660052,5,B00KMJBCJM,"I could not find any other way to buy Man of La Mancha on DVD. Man of La Mancha is one of the best movies ever made. The Fantastiks might just be, as another reviewer has noted, the worst musical ever made. The September song was beautiful but did not fit into the plot at all. I remember it from the 1960s as a great single, but not worth watching the musical for.",1527120000,,365,4.013698630136986

8660055,4,B00KMJBCJM,"Man of La Mancha is presentation of the story of Don Quixote, cast in an odd setting of its author, Cervantes, imprisoned by the Spanish inquisition because he produced a play that ridiculed the Catholic church.  It tells only about 20% of the adventures of El Quixote, but it does include the essential icons of tilting with windmills and his knightly love for Dulcinea.

In real life, Cervantes never faced the Inquisition, although he did end up in prison a couple of times for what might have been the real crime of embezzlement.  I don't know why the playwright wrapped that Inquisition story around the saga of El Quixote.

The Fantastiks, which is on the same disc, is a story a couple of men who get their son and daughter together by feigning a feud and forbidding them to see each other.  I confess that I really didn't watch the whole thing carefully, instead skipping ahead when the boredom became overwhelming.

I bought this one for Man of La Mancha and wondered why they put these two films on the same disc.  My best guess is that they are both musicals from the same time, and each of them had just one hit song, both of which were performed much better and made famous by later covers.  From Man of La Mancha we get ""The Impossible Dream"" and from The Fantasticks we get ""Do You Remember.""",1515456000,,1307,4.508474576271187
8660056,5,B00KMJBCJM,"Man of La Mancha is the most inspiring musical EVER. Even though the movie's stars aren't known for their singing, the acting more than makes up for any supposed musical weakness on their part. I never get tired of watching and it makes me cry every time. The other movie is OK, too.",1512518400,,283,4.3584905660377355
