7923899,5,B00004UCH8,Such an Wonderful show that i loved as a kid and now my daughter loves it just as much! As all ways the Kratt brother as the best.,1356652800,,130,3.6785714285714284
7923900,5,B00004UCH8,"This tape is excellent. We do not get cable so our PBS channel does not come in very good. I got this tape for my 15-month-old. It combines the action parts of 5 shows on baby animals, so it is non-stop fun! There are over a dozen baby animals, whereas a typical show shows only 3 or 4 animals. This tape looks fantastic and sounds great too. The Kraft brothers look younger then on TV, since I guess they used older shows. Still it is just as fun and entertaining. A wonderful fun animal treat for the whole family, but your toddler will enjoy it most as it was intended. Buy this one and you will not be disappointed.",1008720000,5,619,4.2100840336134455
7923901,5,B00004UCH8,"This tape is typical Chris and Martin.  It is great for children and even for adults who love animals.  I work with school age children and all kids love it.  Their ""learning without knowing it"" style allows children to have fun and gain knowledge at the same time. Highly recommended!!",1003968000,5,286,4.68
7923902,5,B00004UCH8,"My nephew LOVES Zoboo and all of his friends, including Martin and Chris.  This video, and the other Zoboo ones as well, are wonderful!  Not only does he learn from it, but I do too! P.S  It's for Big kids (35 year olds),  too!",971222400,3,227,4.090909090909091
7923903,5,B00004UCH8,"Although this is simply episodes of the PBS series, my son could care less.  To him it is simply Zoboomafoo anytime he wants!  I hope they release even more!",970704000,4,157,4.379310344827586
7923904,5,B00004UCH8,"This is, in my and Jared's opinion, the best of all of the Kratt Brother's videos.  This series has freed my VCR from the monopolistic rule of B____ and those T_______.  I actually have learned things about animals through these shows and my three year old asks for ""amimal junxion"" whenever he gets to choose a video to watch.  It isn't flaky and since it isn't based solely on singing and dancing, will likely have some longevity in your VCR library.  Great tape, I'd get it (okay, I already did :)",970012800,3,500,4.461538461538462
