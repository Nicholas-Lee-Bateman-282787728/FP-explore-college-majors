As for the one reviewer stating that Ross Lockridge probably didn't like  the screenplay, well---unfortunately he never knew about the screenplay as he killed himself shortly after the book became a best selling novel in 1948 and the film was released in 1957.",1083110400,5,395,5.171875
851365,4,6304366051,"The best thing about Raintree is Elizabeth Taylor. Her Susannah is sexy, fragile and tormented. Montgomery Clift as her husband was miscast. Monty seems to be half asleep in his role and is too old to be playing a wide eyed lad. Eva Marie Saint as his righteous ex girlfriend who spends her life hovering around him has a thankless job playing an annoying woman. In fact a lot of Raintree is annoying. I kept waiting for John Shawnessy to grow up, tell off his small minded family and to take his wife and child away somewhere to start over. The battlefield scenes are great. The scenes with Elizabeth before she goes mad are gorgeous but the whole film seems off somehow. While watching it I kept thinking that this movie, with a beter script, casting and director could have been great.",1039305600,6,788,4.556338028169014
851366,3,6304366051,"but I think it was because he just loved the title song sung by the great Nat King Cole. And that song is indeed the best part of the movie, so you could probably save yourself about four hours by turning it off after the last note. But perhaps that is a little harsh. ""Raintree County"" is actually one of those, ""You know what they should have done instead?"" kind of movies that you re-write with your friends during dinner afterwards. My brothers and I have all come up with better plot developments than the screenwriters, or so we think. For instance, Johnny Shawnessy (Montgomery Clift) is a, uh-oh, frustrated writer who longs to write Something Great. His father (Walter Abel), his mother (Agnes Morehead), his childhood sweetheart Nell (Eva Marie Saint), and even his HS teacher (Nigel Patrick) are always commenting on this throughout the movie at different times. But of course, we never see him write a darn thing, so where's the evidence, y'know? Well, during the Civil War, he decides to enlist to find his missing wife and child (never mind about how that happened, it's not important right now) and runs into that HS teacher who's now a battlefront artist a la Winslow Homer. Well, tarnation, why didn't the scriptwriter think to make Johnny a war correspondent? Then he could finally write SOMETHING and look for the family at the same time. Duh! Now about that missing wife. Susannah is played by Elizabeth Taylor in one of her Southern belle roles. There's trouble, you see, because she's also insane. But is she really insane, like in her genes, or is she making herself crazy with all these self doubts of hers? Her self-doubts are caused by Her Secret, which is that she was the innocent cause of her mother going crazy and burning down the plantation after shooting her husband and his negro mistress. Thus, her mother was definitely insane. But Susannah had secretly wished that the negro mistress--who was also her nurse--was her real mother. Now, here's the problem: if she is really her mother's daughter, then she will probably have heriditary insanity. If she is really the daughter of Henrietta the nurse, why then she's part black, which is too much for her to cope with. So which is better, to go crazy or be half black if you're a bigoted Southern belle? Your call on that one. And all throughout ""Raintree County"", Johnny keeps waffling between his two loves, sexy crazy Susannah and ""from my roots"" Nell, who's not all that sexy but at least she's not crazy. I've always found this to be the most annoying part of the movie because he never seems to have any clarity on that point. In the end, Fate intervenes to solve Johnny's problems for him. So, if you've got an entire afternoon with nothing to do and you like to watch technicolor hoop skirts, then ""Raintree County"" may be for you.

851467,2,6304366051,"This tedious three hour drama, containing about an hour and a halfs worth of actual dramatics, never comes to life.  Made by the Olympus of Hollywood filmmaking, MGM, at the height of its powers, it is odd how incompetent the film is, despite its lavish production and top stars.

As a Civil War-era romantic tragedy, this film is compared to GONE WITH THE WIND, but in style and impact the two films are worlds apart:

-In GWTW, the viewer experiences the relentless swirl of events.  In RTC, critical events in the story often take place off-screen.

-In GWTW, the camerawork carries us into the midst of the drama.  In RTC, the camera is passive and distant, never bringing us into the passions of the characters or the heart of the action.  RTC is an epic displayed in long and medium shots, lacking the sense of intimacy that GWTW achieves immediately as it sneaks up onto the porch of Tara for our first glimpse of Scarlett OHara.

-In GWTW, the camera captures every emotion on Scarletts face.  Montgomery Clift often hides his face or turns his back to the camera in his most emotional moments.

-GWTWs canvas is the defeat of the South, and the characters suffer according to the fortunes of the Confederacy to which their personal fortunes are inextricably bound.  In RTC, the characters' troubles have no implications beyond their private domestic tragedy.  Thus the story lacks the wider resonance that has made GWTW a rallying cry for lovers of the Old South.

-GWTW produces an unforgettable sense of place and time.  RTC seems like it could take place almost anywhere and at any time in American history.  Its basic story has more in common with A PLACE IN THE SUN, Clift and Elizabeth Taylors effort of six years earlier, as it concerns a sensitive young man, eager to make his way in the world, who is seduced by a dazzling beauty to unhappy results for all concerned.

-Pacing is one of GWTWs compelling strengths.  Whereas GWTW is in high gear from the sweep of the opening titles, RTC squanders the entire first hour on extraneous characters and their shenanigans before the plot AT LAST gets underway.

-GWTW, for all its angst, has a lot of humor that buoys it up over its almost four hour length.  RTC has none.  Its humorlessness adds to its sense of interminability.

-One similarity RTC does have to GWTW is that the African-Americans are the most admirable characters.  None of the other cardboard figures in RTCs large cast are particularly likeable except Eva Marie Saint, who brings a touching sympathy and humanity to her role as the spurned sweetheart.  Clift was 36 when he made the film and looks every day of it, facial injury or no.  He is hardly convincing in the earlier scenes as a college student.  Taylor is at the height of her riveting beauty, and her intermittent scenes of madness give the picture its only vitality.  Rod Taylor is enjoyable in a flashy turn as a self-serving politician.  Agnes Moorehead, a commanding actress, has nothing to do as Clifts mother and makes no impact whatsoever.  Walter Abel as Clifts sanctimonious father has dialogue that sounds like it was copied from the Lincoln Memorial.  Lee Marvin as Clifts nemesis turned comrade is merely loud and obnoxious.  Nigel Patrick as a rapscallion is meant to be picaresque and appealing but is in fact an affliction to the viewers eyes and ears.

RAINTREE COUNTY is actually the opposite of GONE WITH THE WIND.  GWTW was made under conditions of near-chaos by people who in many instances didn't know what they were supposed to be doing, but nevertheless produced a masterpiece.  RTC was made by expert filmmakers who appeared to be in complete control (perhaps too much so, given the soporific results) and produced a dud.",1426982400,,3739,4.765163297045101

851469,2,6304366051,"Just a comment on the Asian discs - not a review of the film itself as there are plenty here for you to review.

Firstly, the subtitles are, indeed, terrible; however, you CAN TURN THEM OFF.  There is no menu option for ""NO SUBTITLES.""
Simply start the discs and then use your remote ""SUBTITLES"" button and you will find a ""No Subtitles"" choice.

The quality of the picture is sub standard.  The wide screen is chopped down to 1.85:1 - letterboxed - not 16x9 anamorphic.  The colors
are quite faded at times.  However, I did not have any problem playing either of the two discs.

The better quality disc available at Amazon UK is fine, but it is full screen chopping even more of the picture sides.
So, this copy seems to be the available disc for now.  I really find it difficult to believe that WB can not give us a decent
print in their Archive Selections - or that a re-mastered Blu-ray disc can not be provided as there seems to be quite an
interest in this film and the actors starring in it.",1422057600,,998,4.327956989247312

851472,4,6304366051,"My name is Collette Marie and I bought this movie on Amazon. This is a decent movie, though this Asian-made disc has subtitles that don't match the dialogue! The actors say one thing and the subtitles say another! (It's kind of funny, really! ""A fish out of water"" becomes ""A wish of waddle."" Very sloppy on their part!)

The movie is set in the Civil War era. I have a passing interest in the Civil War as I myself was born on the Centennial of the war (in the movie, Clift and Taylor act the part of a married couple, and she gives birth to a baby boy on the very day war is declared). I also have an interest in Montgomery Clift, after reading the biography entitled Monty (not sure who the author is). The biography portrays Clift's sad, tragic life, and during the making of this movie, he was in a horrific car crash that damaged his face -- that's why he looks better in some scenes than in others.

Anyways, this is a good movie but is rather sad, involving themes of war, mental illness, and the early death of the heroine (who is NOTHING like Scarlett O'Hara -- nor should she be. Taylor is portraying a very different personality, one who becomes a tragic figure due to her mental illness, as per the NOVEL the movie is based upon).

Overarching all this is the theme of one man's search for the mythical, golden Raintree -- a symbol of redemption, of paradise lose and regained. The ending of the film is poignant and tragic, but the final note is one of Hope.",1414368000,,1472,4.345454545454546

851548,2,6304366051,"I saw this movie on TCM over the weekend and I suffered through all three commercial-free hours of it. I had attempted to watch this several times before but I had given up after 30 minutes on each attempt. I decided that that it would not be fair to judge it RAINTREE COUNTY until I had seen the entire movie.

It is not another GONE WITH THE WIND, nor is it trying to be one. All it shares with GWTW is the backdrop of the Civil War. RAINTREE COUNTY Stars ELIZABETH TAYLOR, MONTGOMERY CLIFT and EVA MARIE SAINT, three of the Greatest Stars of the early 1950's.

Johnny (Monty) and Nell (Eva) are in attendance at I guess what be called a Junior College (did they allow women in these institutions in those days?) Raintree County is situated somewhere in the North, but not too far North. Suzannah (Taylor) is a visiting Southern Belle (She owns a house there). A lovelier Southern Belle never existed. She sets her cap for Johnny and finally snares him by telling him she is pregnant. She's not pregnant, she is crazy. (SPOILER ALERT).

It's all downhill from here-on. What's the secret that Suzannah is hiding? (Who Cares). What will become of Nell? (Who Cares?) What about the faithless Johnny? (Who cares?). It's much too long.

This movie is a lumbering mess. A Dinosaur stuck in the tar pits of MGM. It's only worth seeing for Monty, Eva Marie and especially beautiful young Elizabeth Taylor who received an Academy Award Nomination for this tripe.

The only points of interest are Walter Plunkett's costumes (He created the costumes for Gone With The Wind) and Nat ""King"" Coles achingly beautiful rendition of the title song.

Taylor comes to town and moves in on Cliff and sweeps him off his feet with her beauty.  But Taylor has some issues.... mental issues that could be classified as ""Bi-Polar"".  She suffers from extreme paranoia and mood swings that left her now husband (Cliff) feeling like he was in a whirlwind, not knowing what triggers her and why she was so pathological.  Eva Marie Saint takes a back seat unselfishly because she still loves Cliff but is concerned that he will become destroyed by Taylors erratic behavior.  The story branches out in to Cliff delving into Taylors past and discovers why she is so paranoid.  He, being a doctor, tries every attempt to help cure her and that proves to be challenging and disappointing.

Words were wrong.
Names were wrong.
Meanings of phrases were so wrong that they were nonsensical.

851634,2,6304366051,"Bottom line up front:  Running more than 2 hours and 40 minutes, ""Raintree County"" is slow and tedious.

My take is that the film aimed to be a long meditation on ""manliness"" set in the period before, during, and after the Civil War -- Montgomery Clift stuck with his marriage to an unstable Elizabeth Taylor.

Clift played his role well.  Eva Marie Saint creditably played the ""Melanie"" role.  Lee Marvin surprised in his performance as a local braggart and bully.  Elizabeth Taylor pined, sighed, wept, and had fits in a Louisiana accent.

To this viewer, though, the plot of this minor league version of ""Gone With the Wind"" is not very compelling, and the extra twist of a legendary ""raintree"" in an Indiana swamp comes across as literary fluff.

Some of the scenes of Indiana and Louisiana must have been gorgeous on the big screen, but this Asian-release DVD does no credit to the original film and its photography.

This 1957 film is an obvious attempt to match the grandeur of ""Gone

to include Civil War battle scenes, romance, mental illness, slavery, and good ol' country life, it lacks focus and purpose. Taylor shrieks and wails
in her faux-Southern drawl and generally overacts the whole time,
although she does wear some spectacular gowns. Saint and Clift are a
boring couple and I didn't care about them at all. Rod Taylor and Lee

With lavish sets and beautiful cinematography and costumes galore, you'd think this well-known period piece would hold up today, especially when you factor in the film's two stars, Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift.  Well, I'm not sure what Oscar voters were drinking back in 1957, but Taylor's wretched performance may be the lowlight of her career (and this is coming from a man who considered her one of the finest actresses of any generation), and the overall scope of this tragically campy soap opera is so brutally nonsensical that one can't help but cringe at the very thought of it.

Maybe it deserves an extra star for entertaining me with all its unintentional humor.

I mean, the story itself had promise and yet the desire to oversell everything to the point of creating a farce is almost too much to bear.  The character development, outside of that done by the magnetic Eva Marie Saint, was so minimal I felt like I knew nothing of why these characters didn't just off one another the first chance they got.  With such a vapid love story centering around two barely interesting individuals, this film was already on shaky ground.  Susanna Drake is an interesting sort, you know, once you factor in the fact that she's crazy, but Taylor's uneven accent is laughable and the way the plays into the melodramatic nature of the film is terribly sore.  John Shawnessy is a bore of a character and so Clift fares possibly worse than Taylor, since he near put me to sleep.

I just didn't care about anyone.

The pacing is also off-putting.  It isn't that it feels the whole of three hours, but it covers so much ground and jumps such large segments that one is left to fill in blanks that are not really hinted to and thus hampers the development of character in that respect as well.  I mean, with years in-between one is left bewildered at certain actions, especially those concerning Susanna, and the bafflement on John's face.  Like, shouldn't you have seen this coming, and then again how should we know because just thirty seconds ago your son was an infant and now he's like five years old.

It's pretty, but it's also pretty vapid.",1346284800,,2430,4.711583924349882

I'm sorry I never got to see this movie in the theater, I was only about 10 or 11 years old at the time of its release. That didn't stop me from seeing a lot of other pictures at the time. I have always like this movie, the performance of Elizabeth Taylor as the southern belle is riveting. This picture came soon after Giant, another powerful performance, and just before Butterfield 8, for which she finally did win an Oscar. Good as she is in this, Montgomery Clift is the leading man and he is excellent as well. This film is also noticeable for being one of the first roles for Lee Marvin in a supporting spot. The magnificent score by Johnny Green has been released in a two-disc edition with the original Nat King Cole title song. The only problem I have with that is whoever was repsonsible for putting it up, didn't know how to end it, so you are stuck with listening to about 10 different possible musical endings, butI digress. The movie was meant as a companion piece to a certain other Civil War movie which was a little more well-known. I especially like the performance Eva Marie Saint puts in as Clift's long-suffering girl friend who never abandons him, even after his marriage to Taylor. The location scenes are fascinating, Reeffoot Lake in northwestern Tennessee stands in for the original Indiana location, and a set of ruins in western Mississippi near Natchez also fits in nicely as Taylor's character tries to expain her insanity. This role also shows what a versitle actress Taylor was. It's about as far from her role in Giant as she could get, and she shown in both pictures. It also doesn't hurt that she was nice to look at in both, either. Guess we'll have to settle for the widescreen video tape roadshow version for now, but hopefully MGM won't keep this one locked up forever.

The worst part is probably the script, followed by the plot.  The whole thing seems like 1950s illusions of what a crisis over racial ancestry in the civil-war South may have been like, and while no doubt there were crises of that nature, I just don't see them playing out like this story-- I just can't bring myself to believe that people would act like that in the 1850s, or for that matter, ever.  It's a big-budget 65mm widescreen film, probably trying to recreate the success of Gone With the Wind, but there's far better out there.

Turns out they didn't originally even get the book author's name right in the credits, it's not Rockridge, but Lockridge.  It was the most expensive US film in MGM's history at the time, and notorious as the one where Monty got in a serious car accident during the filming, while driving home from a dinner party at Liz's place.

While GWTW told the story of the plantationed Southerner during the devastation of the Civil War, Raintree County centers around a small town Indiana boy (Montgomery Clift, his hometown sweetheart, Eva Marie Saint, and a sultry and vivacious Southern belle (Elizabeth Taylor) who moves into the town and his life, turning both upside down.  A beautiful love story evolves, entwined with the human conscience, the abolition movement and birthing poliitics.

The movie is a decent film but does not hold a candle to the written work.  The filmakers could never have hoped to capture the essense of this book in a two hour movie and, so, should never have  attempted it.

Perhaps any film version of the elegantly poetic book would be a compromise, but ""Raintree County"" seems to suffer from a kind of curious detachment from the material. Elizabeth Taylor is fine, Montgomery Clift may have not been able to deliver what was needed due to his serious car accident midway into production, and the supporting players (like the terrific Lee Marvin) steal the show.
The DVd version currently available is poor: the image has been cropped to approximately 1:85-1, certainly not the wide vista of MGM's highly-touted ""Camera 65"" (whose credit has been cut from the opening titles, by the way) and the print looks as if it may have been transferred from a VHS copy. For purists, I'd say stay away and wait for a better transfer. There are no overtures here, no intermission titles, and no features like documentaries: this film could have used them, and some commentary. For others, such as those who have fond memories of the movie from theaters, or for those who just need their ""Raintree"" fix every few months or so, then go ahead: it's an acceptable way to see the movie, and will likely be the only available format for the time being.

851916,5,6304366051,"""Raintree County"" has been part of my psychic since I first saw it in theatrical release in 1956.  I was only ten years old at the time and was completely 'star struck' by the stunningly beautiful and captivating 25 year old Elizabeth Taylor as Susanna.  I have been in love with her screen presence ever since.  Professional film reviewers were, and remain, unjustifiably un-kind to this noteworthy film.  The root cause for much of this 'echo chamber' carping is that other noteworthy romance centered around the American Civil War, ""Gone With The Wind"".  'How dare MGM try to 'plagerize' ""Gone With The Wind""', they seem to say.  All objectivity and fairness is lost.  The fact of the matter is that the story lines of these two film epics are completely different.  Their only similarity is the transcending scope, and the historical setting.  Both are consumately great films.  Both need to be seen and appreciated on their own merits.  ""Raintree County"" is a wonderful film, a classic, by any measure.  Young Elizabeth Taylor gives one of her very best performances.  She was nominated as best actress for her role as Susanna and should have won that year.  The motion picture academy was mad at her at the time for matters entirely off screen.  Taylor is wonderfully supported by the memorable performances of Montgomery Clift (as John Shawnessy) beautiful Eva Marie Saint (best known for her performance in Hitchcock's ""North by Northwest"").  Nigel Patrick, Lee Marvin, Rod Taylor and Agnes Moorehead fill out the very strong supporting cast with memorable characterizations.  Location shooting, costumes and sets are sumptious and meticulous in detail.  The depictions of battle and war are on a vast scale and credibly done, espically those of Sherman's March through Georgia.  Johnny Green composed a musical accompanyment for ""Raintree County"" that is now widely recognized as one of ther best film scores ever composed.  The film works on multiple levels.  It is a deep psychological drama about a troubled young woman with a dark past.  Its a story about racism.  Its a love story (actually several love stories).  Its an account of a young man's quest for meaning in life.  Punctuated with humor and tradgedy, it is a story of life on a grand scale, life disrupted by the catclysm of war and personal pain, and life rebuilt and redeemed through tenacity and strength of spirit.  A timeless classic for the ages.  I still carry the film's images and Nat King Cole's rendering of title song (""Song of Raintree County"") in my head fifty years since first seeing the film.  One of the very best films ever made.",1237420800,4,2622,4.924657534246576

Let's not forget that she started out as a child star, and is one of the few who have grown into a successful adult film career (not forgetting Natalie Wood, Dean Stockwell, Roddy MacDowell, Judy Garland). ""Raintree County"" was her 1st Oscar nom, and for the following 3 years, one of the few to receive 4 consecutive noms. I saw this film in its initial release when I was 8 years old and it fascinated me. In subsequent viewings, I learned of the history in making the film, and I still think it's wonderful. There were major set-backs during the filming, especially Monty Clift's disfiguring accident, but the resulting film works for me. I'd heard that a 50th anniversary edition was on the horizon, but it's now 2008 and none has appeared. D'ya think this film will ever be given proper treatment?

Essentially the film seems magical for me. It is a somewhat offbeat and disturbing epic that seems to captivate the viewer. In one instance it demonstrates tried and true Hollywood conventional storytelling at its best. Yet at other times it goes off into a nether land of the mysterious wonderment of what the beautiful side of life holds for the passionate seeker of such exquisite bewilderment. And still yet it juxtaposes this quest for seeking the secret of such profound and beautiful emoluments of nature to a darker and mysterious side the human psyche that befuddles and hinders the quest and ability to appreciate these wonders. All this set against the backdrop of the Civil War the film seems to somehow mirror and metaphorically explain the complexities of the conflict without truly stating in strong visual terms the sentiments of the North and South. The Civil War was a conflict characterized initially as one of nobility to a cause, clouded by dreams of glory that eventually came to a realization that all the death and destruction and waste of human energies was neither noble and certainly was not characterized by ideals of glory or other such aspirations.

I suppose I could go on at length and talk about many of the esoterically interesting aspects of RAINTREE COUNTY but one scene really comes to mind and continues to captivate me. Late in the film during the Civil War sequence Lee Marvin gives one of the most wonderful lines in the film that sort of sums up the realization of what RAINTREE COUNTY really means. He yells out across to a band of rebels behind the thick brush, ""I come from Raintree County."" And then he speaks softly to himself in fond memory ""I come from Raintree County."" He has come full circle. The Raintree means many things to those that believe. This one tender moment of reflection by Marvin, ""Flash"" Perkins, affirms that. On a personal note Montgomery Clift's real life disfiguring accident during this film only heightens the enigmatic quality that this film holds. We truly don't know what could have been. We can only wonder and believe that something greater was at work on this production. Johnny Green's low-key emotionally fervent and almost unearthly score beckons the viewer to imagine greater things that can be only be inspired from some spiritual notions from the heavens. Both Elizabeth Taylor's and Eva Marie Saint's competition for Montgomery Clift's affections take second place to Clift's yearning for truth and understanding spurned by the expressive performance of Nigel Patrick as Professor, Jerusalem Webster Stiles, who has continually mystified Clift's yearning for life's answers.

851920,5,6304366051,"I like RAINTREE COUNTY. I rate it in my top 10 or 20 films. (If you rank films it often seems we need more space in our top 10 doesn't it?) Essentially the film seems magical for me. It is a somewhat offbeat and disturbing epic that seems to captivate the viewer. In one instance it demonstrates tried and true Hollywood conventional storytelling at its best. Yet at other times it goes off into a nether land of the mysterious wonderment of what the beautiful side of life holds for the passionate seeker of such exquisite bewilderment. And still yet it juxtaposes this quest for seeking the secret of such profound and beautiful emoluments of nature to a darker and mysterious side the human psyche that befuddles and hinders the quest and ability to appreciate these wonders. All this set against the backdrop of the Civil War the film seems to somehow mirror and metaphorically explain the complexities of the conflict without truly stating in strong visual terms the sentiments of the North and South. The Civil War was a conflict characterized initially as one of nobility to a cause, clouded by dreams of glory that eventually came to a realization that all the death and destruction and waste of human energies was neither noble and certainly was not characterized by ideals of glory or other such aspirations.

I suppose I could go on at length and talk about many of the esoterically interesting aspects of RAINTREE COUNTY but one scene really comes to mind and continues to captivate me. Late in the film during the Civil War sequence Lee Marvin gives one of the most wonderful lines in the film that sort of sums up the realization of what RAINTREE COUNTY really means. He yells out across to a band of rebels behind the thick brush, ""I come from Raintree County."" And then he speaks softly to himself in fond memory  ""I come from Raintree County."" He has come full circle. The Raintree means many things to those that believe. This one tender moment of reflection by Marvin, ""Flash"" Perkins, affirms that. On a personal note Montgomery Clift's real life disfiguring accident during this film only heightens the enigmatic quality that this film holds. We truly don't know what could have been. We can only wonder and believe that something greater was at work on this production. Johnny Green's low-key emotionally fervent and almost unearthly score beckons the viewer to imagine greater things that can be only be inspired from some spiritual notions from the heavens. Both Elizabeth Taylor's and Eva Marie Saint's competition for Montgomery Clift's affections take second place to Clift's yearning for truth and understanding spurned by the expressive performance of Nigel Patrick as Professor, Jerusalem Webster Stiles, who has continually mystified Clift's yearning for life's answers.  And so it happened long ago in  RAINTREE COUNTY.",1184371200,6,2851,4.933333333333334

There is something very magical about RAINTREE COUNTY. It truly is a place of the mind where you return to it once you have seen it. I have been watching this film over and over again ever since I saw it while I was in High School. Clift's performance, torn almost into two personalities because of the accident he had during the shooting (which changed the structure of his face) haunts this film as does Elizabeth Taylor's twisted performance of a woman on the edge of insanity. It's almost like a metaphor of the Civil War itself, a country torn in two, brother against brother. Johnny Greene's score is an outstanding achievement for this composer with its beautiful flowing passages that embrace the viewer with a haunting passion. It too stands as a metaphor for all that is beautiful in the world yet intrigues us with many mysteries that are envisioned in the mind by we who inhabit this beautiful land. If only now we could get an official first rate DVD from the MGM library. That DVD seems as elusive as the Raintree itself.

851991,4,6304366051,"Edward Dmytrik was a very gifted director: His fame as inquisitive filmmaker had been carved in relief more than once. It's not strange at all he decided to make such emblematic Noir films such as Murder my sweet, Cornered, The sniper and Crossfire, but he was very worried about the ethic conscious when he bet for A gentleman's agreement. Nevertheless he felt he should make a film inspired in the epic roots according the signs of  ""Gone with the wind"" and so in 1955, he adventured to materialize this project.

The untiring, recurrent  and untamed search of the golden tree works out as a haunting metaphor about those memories of the youth, those vanished illusions, those elusive dreams about full happiness, but also alludes to Goethe `s Faust: ""Grey my friend, is all theory and green the golden tree of the life.""

A Southern belle (Miss Taylor) stops at nothing or get what she wants, including her man, having as big frame the bloody Civil War. And despite the fact the script is uneven in certain sequences, the brilliant performances overcome this default, and it allows you to resist 168 min. long. A near fatal car accident almost disfigured to Montgomery Clit and that awful incident, visibly influenced the last quarter of the saga.

851992,5,6304366051,"The product description does not do justice to this movie at all!

Johnny (Montgomery) gave up his high-school sweetheart, Nell (Eva Marie) to marry southern belle, Susanna (Elizabeth). However, if Johnny had really loved Nell, he would have asked her to marry him, but he never did. To say that the marriage of Johnny and Susanna was love-less is completely false. Susanna loved Johnny more than anyone she had ever loved (except for maybe her mammy, Henrietta).

Furthermore, for Johnny's part, even though he had been tricked into marrying Susanna (she told Johnny that she was pregnant), he may not have been ""in love"" with her in the beginning of their marriage, but he eventually did love her.

Over time, the primary problems in their marriage were a result of a devastating fire in Susanna's youth, and her constant re-living of that trauma. A Secondary problem, was the fact that Susanna was a southern belle who believed in slavery and everything that that entailed. Johnny, on the other hand, was a northern abolitionist.

Anyway, I will not spoil the end of the movie, as you should purchase this movie and find out for yourself the final result.

I will say that the movie was spectacularly produced. The acting was excellent (Montgomery Clift, Elizabeth Taylor, Eva Marie Saint, Agnes Moorehead), the cinematography was good, the color was vibrant and the direction flowed very well.

This is an epic drama on par with Gone With The Wind. So, if you like those kinds of movies, you will like this movie. Be fore warned though, this is a long movie, at 3 hours and 15 minutes.

851993,3,6304366051,"Either you love it or you hate it.  This movie isn't very satisfying, and part of it has to do with the intensely private and inward nature of the novel by Ross Lockridge from which the screenplay was taken.

There was also the question of when during the filming did Montgomery Clift suffer his terrible accident.  For you always hear people saying you can point to the exact frame and rell after which you can see his face destroyed.  This begs the question, surely, for aren't most big studio films photographed out of sequence to accommodate actors and technician's schedules, changing weather conditions, vagaries of location shooting, etc.  That said, it would be great to have a DVD version of this film in which for once and for all, by comparison with the shooting script and MGM studio daily logs, a commentary might let us which scenes were filmed at what time and what month.  To me, Clift looks more or less the same in all stages of the film, but that might be makeup I guess.  There's something eerily withdrawn about his character in the first place, and his underplaying might have been his own way of getting into the role; on the other hand, it does horribly resemble the zombie-like movements of someone who's on a lot of painkilling medications.  As John Shaughnessy is supposed to be suffering from the multiple traumas of the Civil War, it's fitting he looks a little ""not there.""

I can best compare the lackluster effect of watching this film to another more recent film that has similar storyline and mixed results, COLD MOUNTAIN.  Jude Law is playing the Monty Clift part this time around, while Nicole Kidman tries her best at playing the Eva Marie Saint ""Nell"" good girl waits at home part.  The colorful wacko that Elizabeth Taylor essays here went to Renee Zellweger, who was also channeling Betty Hutton in ANNIE GET YOUR GUN.  Both RAINTREE COUNTY and COLD MOUNTAIN had some remarkable battlefield scenes, but both of them drag on interminably, and fail to keep our interest as much as the filmmakers hoped they would do.",1118188800,12,2054,4.722689075630252
851994,4,6304366051,"""Raintree County"" is a movie that lacks plot development and resolution. However, I still found it to be a pleasant movie to watch. The Southern Belle dresses were well done and the color is indeed vibrant. The men's clothing was not as well done as the women's, especially the military uniforms and I thought the actual War Between the States section of the movie was sped through. At the beginning we sense the war clouds looming and we are informed of its progress through the newspaper headlines, nonetheless, once it happens it seems over and done with too quickly. The love triangle is reminiscent of the War Between the States' epic ""Gone With the Wind"" as we have Elizabeth Taylor in the role of the beautiful but dangerous Southern Belle, much like Scarlett O'Hara, and we have the local girl who, though lacking the looks of Olivia De Havilland, still comes across as similar simply because she is the more level headed of the two girls. The lead male character, as we are informed from the beginning is a dreamer and rather easily influenced by his less than desirable school teacher. His lack of assertiveness is part of what contributes to making the plot weak. However, it was nice to see how devoted he was to his literally insane wife even after all the hardships she put him through.

Taylor's Southern accent was lousy, and the constant theme of ""searching for the Raintree"" was silly and tedious.  (Spoiler alert)  They could have done so much more with the Taylor character's mental illness and the childhood event that traumatized her, but it was handled in kind of a confusing way.  Clift's acting was surprisingly weak, maybe because of his car accident and substance abuse; it was like he was sleepwalking.  And the character of The Professor was absolutely insufferable;  I kept wishing he'd get killed off.  On top of everything else, the film is almost three hours long.",1521331200,,747,4.928

Hot Toasty Rag, July 19, 2017

After A Place in the Sun, audiences were granted another viewing of the sizzling pair, Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift. Its always nice to know when costars actually get along during the filming, so that gives all three of their movies an added bonus since they were lifelong friends.

Raintree County was intended to repeat the glory of Gone with the Wind, but it ended up being a huge disappointment when comparing it to one of the universal favorite films of all time. Elizabeth Taylor was cast as the Scarlett OHara type, a shallow, flirtatious Southern belle, and Eva Marie Saint played the meek Melanie character. The biggest difference between the two films is the lack of a Rhett Butler substitute. In Raintree County, the male lead is a sensitive, weak Montgomery Clift, reminiscent of Ashley Wilkes. The story does not revolve around the Scarlett character; Clift is the lead. If you can imagine the 1939 story without Rhett Butler, and told from Ashleys point of view, youll pretty much get Raintree County.

There are beautiful clothes, beautiful people, and beautiful scenery in the film. In an ideal world, it can be watched without any comparison to Gone with the Wind, but its not very likely anyone will be able to do that. Realistically, only Liz Taylor and 1950s epic fans will enjoy this movie. Anyone else, just watch Scarlett, the actual (and fantastic) sequel to Gone with the Wind.",1500422400,,1468,4.864
