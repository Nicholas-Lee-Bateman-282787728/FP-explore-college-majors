8192499,2,B000PMGHE6,"This DVD is great if you've never done Pilates before and are new to exercise. As a qualified and experienced Pilates instructor but first time mum, I was hoping for something a little more challenging. Great explanations on how to do the exercises correctly but a tad slow for me.",1362355200,,281,4.64
8192500,4,B000PMGHE6,"I had a lot of lower back pain while pregnant, and started taking pilates classes. The instructor also recommended that I buy this DVD and said that it was the best pilates DVD out there since it follows guidelines from the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

While it does start a little slow, it has very good exercises and a routine. It really helped my back and I'm so thankful I did it during pregnancy so that once baby was born, I didn't have back issues to then deal with!",1310169600,,492,4.406593406593407
8192501,2,B000PMGHE6,"I found the tape quite boring. It is too expensive for the benefit you get. The exercises are too difficult, no music, I was disappointed for the money I paid it was not what I was looking for, no positive energy, the tempo is too slow.",1231632000,,236,4.1521739130434785
