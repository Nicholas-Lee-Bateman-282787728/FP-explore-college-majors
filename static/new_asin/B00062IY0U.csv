2160267,4,B00062IY0U,i enjoyed alice cooper doing something other than music. his acting is better than most musicians.,1266105600,,98,5.1875
2160268,2,B00062IY0U,"I love Alice Coooper's music, and am a huge fan, so that's how I found out about this movie. But unfortunately, after seeing it, I can't just give this a higher rating because Alice is in it. I found the whole story to just be plain boring. It really drags in a lot of areas, and there was nothing scary about any of the film. the interesting things where Alice using the voice he did, he did a decent job of that, but the whole plot and story was just putting me to sleep within the first 20 minutes. Tho I did manage to get through the entire film, it's really left me wondering how this has become a cult classic of sorts.

Alice himself I think did a decent job of acting, but his cast mates really brought the tone of the whole thing down, and made it seem like it was even lower budget then it most likely was. From the grandfather of shock, I would expect a lot better kills and murders then what was portrayed in this movie. His live show act looked better then what is in this movie. Maybe my intentions where too high for this, but it was just not what I expected, where most scenes take place in the same rooms of a house, and a few outside shots, but everything seemed to just linger on too long to keep me occupied visually, if you know what I mean.

The upside was the 2 songs by Alice written for the movie, I have had those songs for years, but never really taken any notice of them or what there lyrics meant until seeing them in this movie, and it starts to show they weren't just random words put together.

I won't say the effects where bad, it was an early 80's movie, so those are to be expected, I didn't think i'd see anything that would blow me away. But I will say the transformation scene was pretty cheesy, even for the 80's.

So forgive me for rating it so low, but once it was finished, I really have no intentions of wanting to see it ever again, so I hope you understand that I am just giving it an honest review, and not giving it a higher rating just because one of my favorite rock stars is in it.",1265155200,2,2032,4.097989949748744
2160269,5,B00062IY0U,"This film is a classic from Claudio (Troll 2) Fragasso. You have Alice Cooper as a werewolf in a creepy spanish mansion. I don't know what more you could ask for. My only qualm is that the dvd is not the uncut version or widescreen. Hopefully Blue underground will release this uncut, with other Fragasso treasures, like nightkiller and beyond darkness.",1240790400,,353,4.80327868852459
2160270,3,B00062IY0U,"Alice Cooper, making his first horror movie at age 36, in Torrelodones,
rural Spain, acquits himself as a star (never doubted), but also as an
acceptable actor in taking on this rather underwritten role.  His dark,
gaunt, part-Sioux Indian looks and fluid movements are perfect for the
lead role of Vincent Raven, ""The Hottest Rock Star In The World,"" which
Alice genuinely was around 1973-1976!  Mr. Raven and young crew travel
to his family mansion in the California mountains to shoot a ""rock-video.""

It seems there are packs of big hounds running wild, and maybe a werewolf
too.  As in ""Daughter of Dr. Jekyll"" and ""Son of Frankenstein,""  the local
peasants are prejudiced against ""Vince"" and company, because his father had
unleashed terror on the countryside, twenty years before.  This leads to
some excitement as a leathered-up, gunshooting Alice splatters bad guys
(like in his 1971 classic tune, ""Desperado,"" itself inspired by Robert
Vaughn's dudified ""Lee"" in 1960's ""The Magnificent Seven"").  There are
also a spate of bloody attacks by a ""Halloween-mask"" looking lycanthrope.

As a ""modern-era"" horror movie, there have been plenty worse than ""Monster
Dog.""  It makes little sense, but did you care?  The writer-director, none
other than ""Clyde Anderson"" (must be Scottish!) coats the events in enough
fog to please even Sherlock Holmes (who also makes a brief appearance!)
If you want to see the legendary Alice Cooper portray ""himself"" in a
fun, schlocky horror movie, ""Monster Dog"" is not a total bow-wow,
although it's got a ""VHS style"" full-screen and picture quality. Included
in the action are two fun rock-videos of ultra-rare Cooper songs, ""Identity Chrises,"" (sic),
and ""See Me in the Mirror.""

The actor playing the fat sheriff, Ricardo Palacios, is a familiar
(ugly) face from Clint Eastwood's ""Spaghetti Westerns.""
Alice Cooper personally gives ""Monster Dog"" two stars, harsher than me!
He also has a sports bar-restaurant with much career memorabilia,
""Cooperstown,"" in downtown Phoenix, Arizona.",1238198400,5,2025,5.277258566978193
2160271,3,B00062IY0U,"If your considering buying this movie it is probably because Alice Cooper is in. The best feature of this movie are the videos of a couple of the songs from his 80-83 years. I haven't seen this in awhile but I believe there were two songs from ""Zipper Catches Skin"" made into videos for this movie. The movie itself is a low budget South American affair and has been a cause of great embarressment for Alice.",1214006400,4,408,4.381578947368421
2160272,3,B00062IY0U,"Me and my wife got this because she's the big Alice Cooper fan(atic) and so is her mom. We knew going in that it was going to be a very very bad movie, which helped us enjoy it for what it was... a pretty weak excuse to get Cooper doing some mediocre acting and some decent singing in his only movie. His surrounding cast's performance helps not at all and the monster effects are what is expected of a very low budget 80's horror flick.

Good for a laugh or three, as a collectible for a Cooper collection and (in my case) for falling asleep on the couch. You have been warned!",1203033600,4,578,4.160714285714286
2160273,5,B00062IY0U,"It doesn't get much better than this. Alice Cooper plays international music superstar Vincent Raven, the ""biggest rockstar in the world."" by his girlfriend's estimate. This film has some of the cheesiest, most ridiculously dumb dialogue you could ever hear and it makes me wonder about Italian horror movies. Why are they so bad? So bad they're good, that is.
  The film begins and ends with a music video by alice cooper that is the silliest thing you will ever see. He is dressed up in various costumes such as Sherlock Holmes, Jack the Ripper, Billy the Kid, James Bond, etc. It's great. In between we have a hilarious werewolf movie schlock fest that serves up lots of blood and gore, as any good italian horror film should.
  The film was made by Claudio Fragasso under his pseudonym Clyde Anderson. To describe ol' Claudio's style two words come to mind: FOG MACHINE. His films have so much mist floating around in the frames, it's cool looking and all, but does anywhere on the planet have that much fog and mist floating around constantly? Anyway, Fragasso has written, directed, and/or co-directed some of Italy's BEST BAD MOVIES! Hell of the Living Dead (aka Night of the Zombies, aka Virus), the infamous Troll 2, Rats: Night of Terror, Zombie 3, and my personal favorite, Zombie 4: After Death (aka Oltre la morte) are the highlights of his resume of Italian horror exploitation films. He worked on many of them with Bruno Mattei, sometimes without being credited.
  So if you enjoy the italian exploitation genre or if you like the 80s heavy metal horror stuff I must urge you to check out this film.
  The only bad thing is that the DVD picture and sound quality are not much better than a VHS copy, and there are few extras to speak of. I would love to see this film come out in a restored special edition, hopefully someone like Blue Underground, Shriek Show, or Synapse will pick it up eventually.",1195257600,8,1915,4.661721068249258
2160274,3,B00062IY0U,"The presence of Alice Cooper is probably the only reason someone might be interested at all in Monster Dog.  While viewing it you soon realize the joke's been on you.  I've certainly seen worse films than Monster Dog, but this movie could have been alot more fun than it actually is.  Director Claudio Fragrasso certainly didn't dazzle most of us with Zombie 4 or his script for Zombie 3, and Monster Dog is yet another example of Claudio's shortcomings in the horror genre.  Storywise, it's rather simple-Alice and his crew go to his father's mansion to shoot a rock video.  Meanwhile, a pack of wild and muderous dogs is roaming the area.  Also, Alice's father was lynched years ago for being a suspected werewolf, so naturally Alice's arrival leads the townfolk to feel he's a werewolf also, and is responsible for the wild dogs.  Sounds decent enough, but something's really missing.  I don't mind the shoestring budget or the bad acting, but something just doesn't work about it.  Since the film's not suspenseful or very interesting, more gore could have saved the film I suppose.  Cooper can't really carry the weight of the film himself, but that's not his fault as much as it is the script's.  Cooper is one of the major reasons to watch the film however coz you keep asking yourself how the hell he got talked into it.  Alice was probably in the lowest point in his career at this time(not in terms of his music, which was excellent, but in terms of his popularity in the US), but still very successful abroad, so the guy wasn't strapped for cash in any way.  But sometimes celebrities take odd jobs in other countries for fun or an extra bit of money.  Alice did tell me(yeah, I met Alice, how do ya like them apples?) that he was assured that this film wouldn't be seen in America, but only in a few small countries.  He realizes himself that the film is bad and has a rather humorous attitude about the film.  He also did two songs for the film which are actually quite good(probably the best thing about the movie), but never showed up on any album, but rather on his box set.  Plus, his voice is dubbed!  That's a distraction, but anyone who knows Italian productions knows that this happens quite a bit considering Italians never shot sound while shooting their films.  At it's best, Monster Dog has a few chuckles a potentially good plot, and two cool tunes, which is more than you can say about Zombie 4.",1179532800,9,2422,4.564814814814815
2160275,4,B00062IY0U,"It takes 3 movies to form a subgenre.  ""Monster Dog"" rounds out the subgenre of ""rock band goes to an isolated location in the woods and encounters supernatural beings who kill most of them.""  Admittedly, this is a very specialized subgenre.  The other members are Juan Piquer Simon's classic ""Pod People"" and Jon-Mikl Thor's ""Rock and Roll Nightmare,"" both of which are much more over the top and entertaining than ""Monster Dog.""  Having said that, ""Monster Dog"" is well worth adding to your bad movie collection.

Right after the reddest credits in the world, the movie begins with the cheesiest, and funniest, Alice Cooper song and video that you will ever see.  I will sometimes pop in this disc and just watch the video when I'm feeling down.  It'll perk you right up!  Alice disagrees, though; when the movie cuts away from the video to a customized van in which Alice and his bad are being driven by their manager, he tells her that ""it stinks!""  This is a direct homage to the previous year's ""Pod People,"" where Ian Sera's ""it stinks!"" after his recording session is perhaps the greatest moment of that film.

The band is in the van en route to Alice Cooper's childhood home, where he hasn't been for years.  On the way, they pass through several police roadblocks.  The cops are out there because wild dogs have killed several people, and as you know roadblocks are the most effective method of controlling dogs.  After they arrive at the Cooper home, they find the caretaker dead (but only after they find the delicious sandwiches that kindly old man had made for them).  Of course, they find the dead caretaker in the middle of shooting another video, one with a song that is actually pretty good.

Then the band is menaced by bikers who think that Cooper is behind the dog killings.  You see, Cooper's dad was a werewolf, or had some kind of werewolf like disease, or something.  The rockers dispatch the evil bikers, but then most fall prey to the evil dogs.  I won't spoil the ending for you, but if you think you know who the titular monster dog is, you're right.  Strangely, for all the stuff that happens, this is a movie that has a number of tedious and slow parts.  It feels much longer than its 75 minutes.

""Monster Dog"" gets 4 stars as a bad movie.  If you own no other movies of this subgenre, I'd get ""Pod People"" and ""Rock and Roll Nightmare"" first.  But don't neglect this forgotten classic.",1141257600,8,2418,4.585081585081585

2160331,4,B00062IY0U,"I'm rating 4 stars for the movie, not the DVD version from Substance though. The MGM/Kino DVD recently released is way better, featuring a Widescreen transfer and deleted/extended scenes and a interview with the director Fargasso and his wife about the making of it.

The movie is a laugh riot I guess, a B movie made in Spain with Italians directing and writing it and producing it partially. That tries to take place in America and stars the one and only Alice Cooper and they even got him to write and sing two songs for the movie.

It's bizarre to say the least. But Cooper had his reasons. And he also apparently thought this movie would never reach the Western market either. Boy was he wrong.

Cooper is dubbed over into English by someone else, apparently he didn't care to re-loop things for this movie.  Apparently the only thing that is his real voice is the songs he sings during the movie which sound rather crappy due to being just demo versions apparently.

The movie is a rather confusing at times werewolf flick about him playing Vincent Raven who is basically Cooper as himself, a rock star. Him and his crew go back to his old hometown to film a video only to find the place terrorized by wild dogs or werewolves. And yes, not spoiling anything but Cooper's going to turn into one.

The puppet for the dog is rather dorky looking, not the best they could have gotten and Claudio admits this.

Not that I think the guy who directed Troll 2 could have made this better. He admits the final edit of the movie is rather heavily edited by the distributors and producer from his own which ran apparently 20 minutes longer. Which I have to think how much more of this movie was there. I mean 84 minutes is thankfully short, sweet and to the point. Apparently at least 4 minutes of footage got put back into the Japanese release of the movie on VHS. Which is were the extended and deleted scenes come from, some of it actually does give some more background dialogue that might be needed to flesh things out. Others just muddles the narrative even more and probably was removed for a reason.

But since that only accounts for 4 minutes of footage missing from a 20 minutes total, well I guess we'll never see that other footage that make this movie better according to Fargasso.

The Substance DVD like I said, is bad and was what many had to put up with for years to see this movie. A full screened VHS-taped sourced budget/bootleg version which was probably ripped from the Trans World Entertainment VHS itself.

The Kino DVD recently released thankfully remasters and gives this movie a better, widescreen transfer.",1462320000,,2629,4.574468085106383
2160332,3,B00062IY0U,"Being a huge fan of 80s horror, of course I had to watch Monster Dog! Man, is it cheesy!  Unfortunately the songs in the film are better than the movie itself in my opinion.

The blu ray looks far better than the old vhs, And that's a huge step up from the tape for sure.  It did play in spanish theaters back in the day though.

The movie has a traditional setting, with a large spooky mansion in the country, lots of fog and mist on the moors, and killer dogs that suddenly appear.

With an Italian director, the film has the style and production values of a film shot in Italy, with spaghetti western gunshots, and dubbed sound and dialog.  Alice Cooper plays rock singer Vince Raven, and although his actual vocals are featured when he is singing, his voice is dubbed for the rest of the film.  If you are familiar with Cooper's voice, this can get very annoying.

Raven, his girlfriend Sandra (Victoria Vera) and a film crew, are in a van headed to his childhood home, to shoot a music video.  During the journey, several locals are apparently killed by wild dogs, and the groups hears stories about mysterious deaths, and meet a crazy old man who tells them they will all die.  Other residents are not pleased by Raven's appearance, and take up arms, but the power of the evil monster dog is too much to be overcome.

The film has a gloomy atmosphere, but outside of some dream sequences, fails to generate much suspense, as the characters are dull, the dialog weak, the acting generally poor, and the unimpressive looking ""monster dog"" is mostly just a dummy head.  While these kind of issues are fairly common for Italian horror, the redeeming factor usually is the gore, unfortunately the film is a little weak in that respect, as Fragasso is no Lucio Fulci.  A number of real dogs are featured, but they aren't employed very convincingly at all.  The pace finally picks up until at the end, with some decent gore and a few shocks, but Fragasso ends it all as a joke.  Rating: 2.5 stars.",1352505600,,2276,5.721068249258161

2160449,4,B00062IY0U,"The year was 1984, and world famous music producer Bruce Dikenson had a life changing discussion with well known rocker Alice Cooper. He told Alice that he needed to really explore the studio space by taking a brief time away from music. He advised him to create a horror movie so B that one day the brothers Sid would review it. Alice Cooper was very confused by this advice and spent the next couple weeks in deep thought. After some serious consideration he agreed to the terms and signed on to star in the lesser known low budget wolfman flick ""Monster Dog."" After the first day of shooting he knew one thing...that he had made a terrible terrible mistake. After the filming finally wrapped up 2 days later he ran down the street screaming ""he's gone the evils gone from here!"" To this day when asked about Monster Dog in any interview he will either deny it's existence, or claim that it was really his twin brother Dallas Cooper who went behind his back and starred in the movie.

Monster Dog starts off with a music video starring Vince Raven (Alice Cooper) who clearly didn't stray too far from his actual life. He plays a big shot rock star that wants to shoot a new music video, but wants to do it in his old hometown. Upon arrival they're stopped in their 1975 rapist van at a road block with the towns hillbilly sheriff. They're told the sheriff reckons a pack of wild dogs is loose and on a flesh eating spree. These dogs have taken out 6 of the local bumpkins within the past few days. However Alice Cooper isn't afraid, he's got a low budget music video to shoot. Once they arrive you pretty much figure out exactly whats going to happen for the remainder of the film. Yeah you got it, Cooper's really a rock star wolfman fighting against his natural urges to be a werewolf. When he finally morphs into the wolf it was pure bliss. The wolfman was just a big furry plastic head you never see from the neck down. His crew of flunkies do what they can to stop the chaos, but unfortunately Alice already said ""look at the scoreboard it's chaos!"" There's no way you're coming out victorious against Alice Cooper, especially in his werewolf form.

In all honesty Monster Dog was absolutely horrific in the greatest way possible. It's jam packed with horrid acting, a nightmare script, and special effects Sid could have outdone in his science fair project days. Despite waiting til the last minute from goofing off and numerous 7-11 trips. Honestly this movie was an Alice Cooper away from being showcased on MST3K. We've always thought Alice Cooper was one interesting character, but after this he will be held in a much higher regard for his efforts in the art of B. We also came to find this movie was the prelude to the Woody Award winning&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Werewolf/dp/6304737866/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Werewolf</a>. Yes it's true. One night after Joe Estevez polished off his 3rd bottle of John Daniels(Jacks cheaper version) in 1994, he came across Monster Dog on his special pay channels the cable company forgot to shut off after the free sample week. He sat in astonishment for the next hour and a half in his stain soak blue robe with nothing on underneath. As soon as the film finished he took out a cocktail napkin and wrote the script for Werewolf in 17 minutes. The rest is history, which is why Monster Dog earns itself a very strong 4 star rating. Just in time for a nice Halloween time viewing.",1315267200,2,3482,4.687908496732026

The thing that makes it horrible (in a funny way)  was the low budget look and the sometimes horrible acting.  Alice Cooper truly is the best thing in this film, Although if you are a real AC fan, like me, you'll have to try to stomach the opening of the movie with that video. Otherwise, just enjoy, even laugh at, this funny little movie.",1313452800,,469,4.295454545454546
2160451,5,B00062IY0U,"I remember seeing this movie, many moons ago with my dad. Sitting back, chugging a few beers and watching as Alice Cooper sings about his identity crisis.
As an adult I ran across this movie in a used section in my local video store in NC. had to have it. then saw it finally on dvd and well as they say the rest is history.
I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a true horror fan. It has that atmosphere of total Alice cooper.",1301356800,,435,4.069767441860465

2160453,4,B00062IY0U,"MONSTER DOG is a cheeezey, schlock masterwork of 80s ""horror"". I dare anyone to be frightened by this movie, even for half a second! Still, it's charms far outweigh any shortcomings. First and foremost, we get a dubbed Alice Cooper (PRINCE OF DARKNESS), woodenly reciting lines that can only be described as awe-inspiring in their clunkiness! Then, there's the rest of the cast, straight out of mid-80s MTV-video stock-character casting! Of course, there's the MONSTER DOG itself, made of what appears to be naugahyde! However, these are NOT drawbacks! Mr. Cooper holds his own, at least when mute, and the atmosphere is ominous, though shot through w/ garish blue light and fake fog! Add this one to your schlock-shelf immediately!...",1281312000,,735,5.133333333333334
2160454,2,B00062IY0U,"A group of rock 'n rollers end up dead meat when they run across a mutant beast on the road home to their next show, but they soon find out that the monster may actually be walking among them! Alice Cooper leads this awful mess of a monster movie, which can't decide if it is a killer animal flick, a werewolf tale, or a ghost story. Its convenient plot seems like nothing more than a poor excuse to throw Cooper on stage in a few cheesy music video moments. MONSTER DOG'S hand-puppet monster is likewise a laughable joke, but thankfully it is kept shrouded in the fog for the majority of the film. The only shot that is even worth mentioning in the entire picture is a shotgun blast that cleaves a guy's skull in two, but other than that this is a trashy creature-feature out of Spain that can easily be missed.

If you're looking for a serious & very well written horror story I'd say skip this one. But if you enjoy cheesy B(or even C) level horror movies with rockstars then I think you'll have fun with it.",1510617600,,374,4.194444444444445

And this movie has them, terrible dialogue and stereotypical character ensemble included. However, the cast does a good job with what they have, the plot is cool, and there's kind of a sexy vibe throughout and again it has Alice Cooper.
