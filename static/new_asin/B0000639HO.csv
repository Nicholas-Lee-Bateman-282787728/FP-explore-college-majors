1688102,5,B0000639HO,"With quirky characters and authentic scenery remniscent of ""Waking Ned Devine"", this movie is a great addition to your library.  If you are sick of the holywood formula and appreciate the genuine humor of such movies as ""An Everylasting Peace"" you'll love this one.  Great Newfoundland Scenery, and characters - Andy Jones steals the show.",1030320000,2,339,5.1454545454545455
1688103,5,B0000639HO,"In Feb of this year I saw this flick in halifax. After watching ""The Shipping News"" I was very skeptical (being from newfoundland originally myself). After sitting in the theater for 2 or 3 minutes I was laughing and it didn't end till the ending credits rolled. Well worth the price of admission (or in this case purchase). One of the most unpretentious, refreshing comedies I've seen since ""O'Brother Where Art Thou"" (another gem). William Hurt does a rather authentic NF accent and the rest of the cast are fantastic but its Andy Jones who steels every seen he his in.",1030060800,,571,4.663366336633663
1688104,4,B0000639HO,"This is yet another movie filmed in New-Found-Land , the other being 'The Shipping News' and that being said, it is the only similarity... Where as Ship News was dark, moody, and sinking in its' own sea of muck. (Rare Birds) is on the opposite end of the scale, light, witty, much more lively character to watch. This little gem of a movie got lost in the 9/11 murder-madness and went right to dvd and video. I am reviewing the DVD, which has a lot of info. on it.
William Hurt, John, "" Kiss Of The spider Women ,""Altered States, is very funny as the (Off the beaten path restaurant gormet cook, owner.) Whose clientele is non existent? John is about to throw in the towel when his friend, Andy Jones(ll), (Phonce), comes up with an idea to get people for the restaurant.
He comes up with an idea of sighting a rare bird, Duck, in the ocean below the restaurant. The scheme and how they set it up is hilarious. Also Phonce has a paranoia re; people in motor homes and he thinks the're out to get him which is half right. There is a scene in a homemade submarine which Phonce built in his secret tunnel under his garage. A real hoot! There are frogmen, a CEO from a corp. trying to get an invention which Phonce's one time partner invented, sheet's of light hung up on clotheslines , with clothspins , in the tunnel.
The people start coming to eat, and John hires more staff and there is a love which develops between John and Alice. But things start to unravel and the laughs keep getting longer. The cinematography is great and the sun really does shine in New-Found-Land!!

1688105,5,B0000639HO,"This movie is going to be added to my video collection as soon as the price drops.  William Hurt's performance is quite believable, as is that of Andy Jones.  Hurt's character, Dave, is a restaurateur whose eating establishment is in an out of the way place on the bay; so out of the way that The Auk is going under for lack of business!  Enter Phonce (Andy Jones).  Phonce invites Dave over for a look at his ""RSV"" (recreational submarine vehicle) which he has been constructing in the WWII vintage tunnel that is on his property.  Add to that the mystery surrounding the ""svedtka"" lamps which the Europeans left in his tunnel, and Phonce's plan to rescue Dave and the restaurant from bankruptcy, and POOF! - a grand scheme to spot a rare bird in the bay in front of The Auk, and bring in ""birders"" from everywhere.  Birders who will, naturally, be very hungry.  Very funny movie and heartwarming story.  Great acting; zany characters.  A must see, and after you've seen it once, you'll have to own it.",1024704000,11,1003,4.558659217877095

1688202,2,B0000639HO,I should have read the book first .This movie had a good plot it just seemed to be missing a lot of details which I'm sure the book covered some of it didn't even make sense. This movie in no way was a comedy. When the dead woman was pulled from the lake her face was shown but no one appeared to recognize and I found this to be odd. There are many movies on Amazon to watch that I'm sure are better than this one so don't waste your time. If you think you must see for yourself then read the book first.,1466035200,,505,3.8653846153846154

1688226,1,B0000639HO,"Wasted our time watching this bizarre movie!  The plot of a failing restaurateur lying about a rare bird to bring in customers would have been fine in itself.  Instead, madness ensued by introducing drugs, a wife, and a submarine!  The cocaine served absolutely no valuable addition to the plot. Still can't figure out why that was part of the movie.  They don't show you enough about the first wife before playing up this adulterous relationship with this new younger girl. The current wife is only revealed briefly without giving us a sense if she's terrible or the marriage is salvageable or even if the two of them are interested in saving it.  Why not just have him be single if you're not going to develop the characters enough to add to the storyline? And then there's the submarine!  They might as well have made it a spaceship!  Just bizarre! It served absolutely no contributing factor to the plot!  The worst part of the movie was IT WAS NOT FUNNY!  At most, there were a couple chuckles!  Not once did any of us ""laugh"". I wanted to, and tried, but none of the script was funny enough to bring that chuckle to a full out laugh!  DONT WASTE YOUR TIME!",1465430400,,1162,4.511961722488039

1688228,5,B0000639HO,I must admit I am a huge fan of William Hurt and I love the fact he is making such decent quality films in his golden years. This movie however had every scene he was in stolen by Andy Jones who played Phonce. Nicely done film. No filth or vile language/violence.

I realize now that I have seen Molly Parker in other things but didn't pay that much attention. She doses an excellent job in the part of Hurt's love interest. This is a fun little story about mostly simple, regular, likeable people. Some of the acting was spotty but this little play is enjoyable enough that it is easy to forgive that flaw. I could believe that some of the cast were not pros. And that is a good thing for the type of film. Not a blockbuster but a really good time.",1464566400,,578,4.169642857142857

1688321,5,B0000639HO,This movie is quietly wonderful.  I think that the Icelandic director's influence shows in the small but vital community and indeed in the birding interest.  I love that it doesn't have explosions (wait  - it does!) or police chases (oh jeez- wrong again)  okay I love that no one dies ( oh darn someone did that too) but at least it doesn't have the usual weird psychotic violence that passes for brilliance these days in movies (You figure out who I mean...).  I like that the characters aren't crazy over sexed weirdoes - again this passes for normal not in entertainment for some reason.  These people are believable (yes even with the submarine) and more fun for that reason.  It's really fun to watch but I should read the book too.,1463270400,,738,4.587786259541985

The best parts were watching the ocean waves crashing against the rocks. I saw nothing funny in it to laugh at. I'm so glad to see that there are other reviews here that agree with mine. Was so glad to see the ending show up.,1463097600,,480,4.172043010752688

Alas, that initial impression wilted and this later film lacked the magic of the first. It was okay with some interesting characters (sadly, not Dave, William Hurt's character). The concept was okay although the subplot involving cocaine seemed utterly superfluous and unnecessary. For that matter, the subplot involving the submarine also seemed superfluous and unnecessary and the subplot involving the low-energy lighting had real potential, wanted to be a core element of the story, but was woefully neglected. Overall a clunky movie with a few plot elements and a few characters that made it marginally entertaining.",1462752000,2,777,5.174603174603175

No blood and guts or gore, which is a nice change from so many scripts out on the market today.  Explosions and gunfire at the end, but no one is injured.  I don't understand the need for cocaine use by the leading character to play a part in the movie, it brings a bit of the breaking bad feel to the story line.

He seemed too dithery; she was just starting out in life as an architecture student, he seemed as though he had gotten to the end of his rope and she was his last hope.

1688843,4,B0000639HO,"Is it a mystery, a comedy, a romance? The answer is all of the above. This off-beat Canadian film provides a pleasant diversion from the usual with William Hurt ensnared in a friend's attempt to help save his failing restaurant by perpetrating a hoax on the birding culture.

Molly Parker steals the viewer's heart as effortly as she steal's Dave's in the movie.

I can think of a good dozen half-baked flicks where it's more important to invoke a sanctioned dogma rather than speak a personal truth. 'Bridesmaids' and 'Avatar' immediately come to mind.

This isn't one of them.

I remember when I first viewed this film and I can tell you that I was genuinely floored. Completely exhausted; laughed and loved out, utterly depleted from the simple joy of this movie.

Tells the story of Dave, a restauranteur running a small out-of-the-way little eatery, The Auk, in cold New Foundland. Sadly, the salad days are long since past and it's only a matter of time before the bank closes in. He holds onto the place out of habit and because he has nothing or no one else. Having separated from his wife, Dave quietly readies himself for the inevitable.

His nearest neighbor, best friend, and fellow epicurean is Alphonse - an enterprising and exuberant fellow who hates to see his buddy's spirit and business swirling the drain. So, in a last ditch effort to save both, 'Phonse comes up with an idea.

It's an ingeniously simple, but brilliantly twisted idea that will alter Dave's life forever - if he can maintain himself and his guilt-pressured bowels.

It had been a very long time since I enjoyed losing myself in a mildly out-of-kilter movie world inhabited by strong quality characters. Good friends, good meals, fine wines, an absolutely stunning beauty in the form of actress Molly Parker, industrial spies from the recreational vehicle conglomerates, 26 pounds of abandoned cocaine, perpetual fusion energy, an extinct mallard, and lest we forget, a homemade submarine of questionable seaworthiness.

Very much in the vein of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Local-Hero/dp/B003NOIL1K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Local Hero</a>"" - this quiet wonderous film produces what I consider 'true magic' - that of love and friendship.

Personal Note: If you enjoyed this film I highly encourage you to read&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-source-novel/dp/0385256353/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the source novel</a>.

As for the film itself, I enjoyed it when first seen on TV a few years ago - found it quaint and charming.  But after re-watching it a few more times, well, I find it less charming.  Actually, William Hurt's potrayal starts to wear thin.  The music/score and scenery are great, but the characters just don't generate any warmth to me.  Especially the scene of William Hurt - partially naked scratching his rear - puhlease. The point being?",1160352000,3,750,4.552238805970149
1689055,1,B0000639HO,"Before every episode of that sci-fi classic television series X-Files there would be a promotional teaser that would claim, ""All of your questions will be answered...""  While you would watch the show, hoping that Mulder and Scully would finally find the answers to life, ultimately by the end, there would be more questions with very very few answers.  It was the X-Files and over time we found ourselves used to no questions answered, and continued randomness coupled with confusion.  Rare Birds seemed to be directed by an obvious X-Files fan, because here you have a film that is being marketed as the next Saving Grace or Waking Ned Devine, but oddly ends up like neither of these films and more like an unanswered episode of that alien miniseries.  There are so many unanswered questions with implausible moments in Rare Birds that instead of focusing on the possible great and unique characters, our minds get muddled in the tangent, random, and completely unfocused story.  Rare Birds could have been a comfortable film, it could have been easy, simple, and relaxed, but too many unfamiliar coincidences caused this ""independent"" film to flap poorly in the wind.  Rare Birds will transform any avid bird enthusiast into a full-fledged hunter, shooting any bird that step within their path!

What makes Rare Birds an interesting film (and keep in mind this is the only interesting part of the film) is that as you watch this film, you can pinpoint exactly where the muddling begins.  There is an exact moment in this film where you can see that the director wanted to add so many different elements that they could not control them all.  From the tangent cocaine story (causing unfocused elements in characters that are not developed), to the scientifically profound lights, to the recreational submarine, all the way to the supposed central focus of this film ... the rare bird.  One would think that the rare bird story, hoping to build a sorrowed character's life to be better, would be the central moment, the breaking moment, but instead the rare bird story is just as unfocused as the rest of the film.  Early in the film Hurt and Jones go into Jones' basement and all of these stories collide together.  Sadly, when we leave the basement, nothing has been straightened out.  This is when our story, Rare Birds, begins to burn and into a slowly crashing direction.  It is obvious that Edward Riche's novel has quite a bit more about the characters and their inner-voice explaining better situations.  Alas, this did not transform well into a film version.  Director Gunnarsson has way too much on the plate, and as we see in other films in the same vein, there becomes a fuzzy central focus.  The rare bird story should have been the focus, but instead we attempt to learn about cocaine (and Dave's apparent addiction), the ""Winnebago"" group, and some random science light issue that is never fully explained thoroughly.  Rare Birds starts strong, but ultimately fails because of the classic ""buffet-line"" issue.  Gunnarsson should have followed the rules, ""Take all you want, but eat all you take""!

Occasionally with films that are as painful as Rare Birds, you sometimes get a great cast that overshadows the failing story.  Hurt is awful.  I have seen him in so many good films over the years, but this seemed to be too simple of a role for him.  Was he doing it for just the cash or was he overplaying the simpleton character?  I couldn't tell.  Hurt seemed to play Dave with so much remorse, so much pain, that you never could understand what his true story was.  His reaction to his wife was flimsy, the story between him and Molly Parker was subsequently as weak, and his reactions to Jones were uncharismatic.  He felt bored in this film, and instead of being funny, he just felt sad.  His character was nothing to write home about, and I blame Hurt because I know he could have pushed deeper and had fun with Dave overall creating an enjoyable hour and a half.  This did not happen, and we were pained for that exact amount of time.  The same can be said for Molly Parker who danced her way out of our hearts and Andy Jones who played his character to discretely.  There was too much counterbalance between Hurt and Jones that they could not play off each other well.  What could have been a decent buddy scenario like Waking Ned Devine turned out to be just two characters talking about incoherent nothing.  The story matched the characters, overall souring this film.

Overall, Rare Birds was a horrible film.  It had the potential to be just a simple, sweet story about friends helping each other, but instead too much was thrown into the mix to muddle the overall tone of the story.  With the synopsis centering around some rare birds helping a friend gain new business, I went into the film expecting a buddy story centered with this rare bird story.  Alas, it never really congealed that way.  That is the biggest gripe of this film.  I don't mind getting into a film and experiencing something different, but this was a completely tangent storyline.  Nothing was ever developed, nothing was ever answered.  I really didn't want an answer by the end of the film, but at the end I felt cheated and wronged.  Even the supposed ""love story"" didn't seem real, but instead very forced.  Pass on Rare Birds if you can.  It has nothing to do with friendship and very little to do with birds.

Grade: * out of *****",1154822400,6,5435,4.716861081654295
1689056,2,B0000639HO,"One of my favorite songs from the fifties, DON'T YOU KNOW, by the wonderful Della Reese is the highlight of this disappointing film.  Like THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD, RARE BIRDS could have been a refreshing film.  It has a wonderful look, set in the rural area of Nova Scotia, and an appealing premise and cast.  Unfortunately, it never really seems to go anywhere and it never really comes to an end.  William Hurt plays a down on his luck restaurant owner who is separated from his wife, and who may have to sell his establishment since no one patronizes it.  Andy Jones plays his imaginative friend, Alphonse, who has invented an RSV - RECREATIONAL SUBMARINE VEHICLE, and he is sure that the Winnebago people are spying on him and wanting to take his invention.  He's also found an immense amount of cocaine, which he asks Hurt to try and price for him.  Jones has also devised a non-electrical source of light which plays an important role in the movie's finale.  Jones also offers Hurt a solution to his problem:  call a radio talk show and tell them he's sighted an extinct bird that is hovering near the restaurant and all the birdwatchers in the world will show up and his business will boom, which does indeed occur, but not without the prerequisite difficulties.

The photogenic Molly Parker plays Jones's sister in law who helps out at the restaurant and falls for Hurt in the making.

While the film has some admirable qualities, it just doesn't come together enough for me to rate it any higher, but oh that song!!!",1151020800,,1530,4.62962962962963

Let's not even talk about TV news; HBO is the most real thing on television.  I happened across this movie on cable, while eating dinner.  Do yourself a favor and take in this film; do others a favor and buy the DVD, to promote intelligent and thoughtful entertainment.  I know I will.  The cinematography alone is worth it, but, so is the acting, the writing, the imagination...",1127260800,12,596,4.747572815533981
1689074,4,B0000639HO,"Ok. So this movie is not for everyone, but the people who pan it tend to be those who don't get it (and think they should). The movie looks from the beginning like it is supposed to realistically depict event occurring in the real world, but if you take it that way you will end up confused (especially when the Mounties show up in force at the end of the film and no one gets arrested). Think of it as a middle age male fantasy with Bill Hurt playing the ego, Andy Jones as the id and Molly Parker as the anima (I know I'm mixing Freud and Jung, just play along). Whatever ""happens"" in the movie is peripheral to the Bill Hurt character falling in love, once again, with his soul. It's sort of a Dante-Beatrice thing. The guy starts mired in his own wrong choices, at a dead end and, by the end of the movie, he is enabled, by coming to terms with himself, to follow love (i.e. resume his life).

The movie works through a combination of beautiful scenery, an hypnotic soundtrack and good performances from the principals (Hurt, Jones and Parker).

If you are literal-minded watch a different movie. This is poetry.

I saw it sometime last year; and, decided to go to Amazon. Com to add it to my Video Collection. And, in the past year, I guess I've watched it 3 or 4 times; and, have enjoyed it just as much, each time!

True, it's not on the same Level as ""Gone With The Wind"" or ""Saving Private Ryan""; but, then again, it wasn't trying to be! One Reviewer compared it to ""Waking Ned Devine"" or ""Local Hero""; and, I have to agree with him, 100%!

It had a few good Characters, e.g., Dave [William Hurt], Phonse [Andy Jones] & Alice [Molly Parker]; a decent little Plot; and, it was over in 101 minutes. It was good Entertainment! And, what else are you looking for? If you want to be ""Moved"", or if you're looking for a Life Altering Experience, watch a Tele-a-thon!",1125792000,4,872,4.246987951807229

It is certainly quiet and quirky, however, along the lines of ""Waking Ned Devine"" or ""Local Hero"" or ""Saving Grace."" There are plenty of other reviews which will describe the plot and characters, so I will not here. I just wanted to give it a thumbs up, for the crowd that likes these kinds of films. It's not slapstick and doesn't try to be. But I know there's room on the shelf for this little gem amongst the Adam Sandler and Jim Carrey films. I personally came upon it on TV late at night, and went to the computer to order it on DVD immediately. Just the thing for a rainy night in front of the fire with hot chocolate.

1689077,2,B0000639HO,"My husband and I both enjoy many different kinds of comedy films, and neither of us enjoyed this boring mess.  While the characters were colorful and fun, after a while it seemed that they were just shifted from one goofy situation to another without much linking them.

William Hurt is the chef-owner of an unsuccessful restaurant when his friend Phonse comes up with a way to bring tourists to the area -- pretend a rare bird has been sighted.  Hurt's performance is good but he has too many ludicrous lines to speak, and the movie never really goes anywhere.  We were both very bored watching.  My husband eventually read a book, and I only finished so I could write this review in good conscience.

Obviously a lot of people really liked this film, so don't take my word for it, but be aware that you may find it really dull.

To have the whole group finish a complete film is amazing in itself ... since it's either the young ones or the old ones get bored half way through most of today's movie fave and slip out of the room...
The movie deals with the owner of a falgging sea coast resaurant, Dave (William Hurt) bemoaning to his neighbour, Phonce (Andy Jones) that he will have to close the place and move back to the city since his nuveau cuisine restaurant idea wasn't too polular at all. Course our whacky neighbour friend not only helps Dave concoct a wild story about and spotting extinct bird near the restaurant but then also takes our reluctant  hero on a roller coaster ride adventure that includes secret lights, drugs, submarines, Winnebago spies, love  .....
Oh yes, Molly Parker plays Phonce's the young sister in law Alice, who is visiting while wating for a scholarship, offering the shy hero of our movie an addeed dimension in this super great story  ....

Yet his liking of cocaine and an ex-stripper waitress keeps him feeding these nutty Canadian bird watchers, a few of whom offer to buy his little restaurant while these purely Canook eccentrics descend on the small New Foundland/Arcadian town to see a fictious bird that stands as a metaphor for every Canadians secret dream of disappearing to the USA.

1689081,3,B0000639HO,"""Rare Birds"" chronicles the life of Dave (William Hurt), chef of ""The Auk"" in a small coastal town in Newfoundland. Business is sagging, and Dave is preparing to sell the restaurant when wacky Fonce (Newfoundlander Andy Jones in a brilliant turn as always) cooks up a scheme involving the sighting of a rare bird (in reality, an extinct duck) to bring flocks of birdwatchers to the area and boost business. The plan works, but the two get more than they bargain for: there are numerous other subplots, some unnecessary, such as the cocaine stash, a love affair between Dave and Alice, Fonce's bookish sister-in-law, the RCMP Bulgarian light conspiracy, and the Winnebegos.
Molly Parker's Alice was a delight, as was Andy Jones' neurotic Fonce. I thought that the entire cocaine subplot was unnecessary. The bathroom humour seemed too base as well, although limited to one (thankfully) brief scene. Although Ebert regards ""Rare Birds"" as more of a wacky Newfoundland character study than ""The Shipping News,"" I disagree. I found that ""The Shipping News"" had a much more engaging plot and much more involved characters. The pacing of ""Rare Birds"" is sometimes slow and awkward, and I didn't really relate to Hurt's character, which made it much harder to enjoy the film as a whole.
The DVD offers very little in the way of special features, mainly a few computer-generated sets from production designs, a trailer (which shows what the film *could * have been if it had lost the excess baggage) and a commentary by director Sturla Gunnarsson. ""Rare Birds"" is rated R for language and drug use.",1043366400,6,1590,4.936567164179104

1689083,4,B0000639HO,"I say this is really funny and it was to me. I saw this in an arthouse theater in SLO and laughed my head off, unfortunately more than half the audience did not. Many were not amused. Whats happening out there? This movie has the most audacious characters. Especially Phonce, Andy Jones, who is so believable in his role. Actually all the actors were excellent! Probably some of the best acting I've seen for awhile. The story weaves around the beautiful coast of NewFoundLand and William Hurt's characters restaurant, The Auk. Hurt is a great cook but his place is located in some remote seaside area, which causes a lack of customers. Anyways, Phonce, who is always the creative planner, the leader in the twosome, comes up with some zany ideas to bring fortune to Hurts character and also to himself. The scenes involving the mini submarine are some of the funniest I've seen in awhile. Like I said though, many in the theater were not even cracking a smile, this is an offbeat comedy so may appeal to some and not to others. Unique and different, these characters are the real rare birds in this cool little film. Also the actress, I think Molly Parker?? does another great job in getting her role to shine, even without alot of film time, well done!
