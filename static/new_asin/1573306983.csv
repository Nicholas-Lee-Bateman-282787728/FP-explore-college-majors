191533,5,1573306983,"This concert involves Johns music, heart felt feelings about the outdoors, wildlife and conservation all expresed in a deep sincere manner as only he could.  The photography and editing contributes much more the any audio  only coverage could possibly do.  A conservationist dream.",915235200,,281,5.488372093023256
191583,3,1573306983,"I was a teenager in the '70s.  And a huge John Denver fan.  A fanatic.  Everything was John Denver records, tr-shirts posters.  I dressed like him and my hair was like his.  I played guitar and my big song was Take Me Home Country Roads.  This is a great dvd. He does over thirty songs.  Like Rocky Mountain High, Annie's Song, Sunshine On My Shoulders,of course Country Roads.  Another number one song of his that I thought was still kind of under rated.  I'm Sorry.  Songs that were album cuts like Two Different Directions, A rockin' The Harder They Fall and Bet On The Blues.  And maybe for me the highlight was Darcy Farrow  Done with just a guitar and mandolin.  Originally on the Rocky Mountain High album.  That was another song  that I do also.  The only  problem with this is.  It's not really a commercial concert.  It's more of a fund raiser for wild life preservation.  Performed  for a very small audience  And there are segments  cut into the concert of him talking about saving the wild life.  This was not the John Denver in his prime.  When he was maybe the most popular singer in the world.  But he was still just as good as ever.",1504051200,,1149,4.37799043062201
191584,3,1573306983,It was just OK.  I was disappointed that it was not filmed at a major concert but only only performed before a small audience.  But it was the constant breaks between every other song with him talking about his views and passions for our natural environment........it became wearisome.,1503187200,,285,4.916666666666667
191585,3,1573306983,This DVD was somewhat disappointing.  It didn't move me like I thought it would.,1502668800,,80,4.714285714285714

191591,5,1573306983,"All the reviews about this DVD are excellent.  I have ordered it, but have not received it yet, and I am definitely looking forward to it.
Many people lament that they never got to see John Denver in person;  I did see him, once, in the seventies, I think it was - back when he was at the very peak of his popularity.
People just flocked to his concert - he was very beloved, at the time, and was about as big as any entertainer has ever been, at that time.
He had a very down-to-earth quality about him, which he transmitted to the crowd - as if he was just one of us - nobody special - which, of course, was not true.  He was very special.  He had an absolutely amazing voice, and his heart always seemed to be in every word he sang.
By the way:  He did actually say, ""Far Out!"" at his concert, the night I saw him, and everybody - including John - got a laugh.  He had already become ""infamous"" for saying that, but it was all part of his boyish charm, which was authentic, at the time.",1489622400,,989,4.046153846153846
191592,5,1573306983,"This last purchase was my second copy of this DVD.  My 96 year old mother in law loved this so much we bought her a copy of her own.  It has all our favorite Denver hits.  I found an online discussion of someone who was actually at the live taping of this event (back in the 90's).  She was there all three nights (1 night rehearsal and taping on two nights).  I watched this DVD then read the discussion of the taping sessions.  Mr Denver was the consummate performer and entertainer.  Since we will never get the chance to see him in person, I recommend this DVD as the best alternative available.  Loved it!!!",1489536000,2,612,4.307017543859649

191612,5,1573306983,"Definitely a great buy if you are a true John Denver fan.  No special effects here---just his undeniable raw talent.  He had great back-up musicians as well.  This concert took place in 1995--two years before his death.  He was in his early 50's & to me, his voice was stronger & better than ever!  Just a man, his guitar, & his songs---wow!!  I'm so sad that I never got to go to any of his concerts, so this DVD will have to do.  I highly recommend it!",1479772800,3,454,4.149425287356322

191615,5,1573306983,"Excellent and perhaps, John at his peak of perfection singing... my only regret is never seeing him personally in concert. I was living in Colorado when he passed away suddenly, and felt it deeply. His music had deep meaning to many who grew up with him and his music and what Colorado used to mean for those of us who lived there, pure, natural, untouched in many ways before massive population influx and over development consumed much of it today sadly...",1472342400,,458,4.666666666666667

191618,3,1573306983,"I feel cheated that ""This Old Guitar"" and several other songs performed at the concert were chopped out of this DVD (they are, I think, on the CD version, which I don't have.)  ""This Old Guitar"" is a beautiful and very moving song that clearly had great meaning for John Denver.  He spoke of it in one interview as his autobiography in just under 2 minutes (words to that effect) and sings it with great feeling in the video clips I have viewed online.  I'd rather pay a little more and get the WHOLE concert on DVD. C'mon producers  were you just being cheap?  Surely you could re-release the whole thing on DVD  from start to finish (including whatever John Denver said to the audience in between the songs performed, if not included already; its hard to tell with those interspersed segments of an interview with Mr.  Denver, which are great but suggest that his commentary during the concert has been omitted).  Please do a complete DVD of the concert as a proper tribute to Mr. Denver and for us newer fans who never had the chance to actually attend any of his concerts  and never will, now that hes gone from this earth.",1463961600,8,1127,4.485294117647059

191624,4,1573306983,"Denver does a bunch of newer songs that weren't all that popular, but they are still good pieces.  I didn't care much for his female vocalist, but that doesn't mean she was bad, just seemed out of place.  Quality of the recording is quite good and Denver fans will really enjoy this DVD.",1448928000,,287,4.39622641509434
191625,5,1573306983,"A must have for all Denver fans! One of his greatest concerts, if not the best, in my opinion. I introduced my grandkids, ages 4 and 9, to his music and they love his songs. His inspiration is truly timeless. I also have the companion CD, ""The Best Of John Denver Live"" containing sixteen songs from this concert. This DVD contains the song ""For You"" and many other selections not on the CD. This is a legendary performance at a great price. Thanks Amazon!",1448064000,,456,4.440476190476191

191630,4,1573306983,"My goodness, a real estate developer's worst nightmare would be to see and hear music like this live version of John Denver's ""Rocky Mountain High"" on the air every day forever. For me it would be a dream come true. If anyone knew how much sacred and irreplaceable beauty humanity is
destroying and paving over as you read this it was those like John Denver-and suburbanites like me too. Trouble is, that even suburban Long Island is becoming more like NYC every year. ...""more people, more scars upon the land...""  ""Too much of anything is no good.""; but that's not much understood by most in the land of excess. I sat mesmerized when I first saw John's live rendition of this timeless and tragic ballad on youtube. His backup band is pretty fine too, as is the sound quality of this DVD concert.

I have thought that country roads is a reasonably nice but not incredible song but hearing Denver sing it with a full band changes the experience completely.  I also fell in love with the song - be back home again.  One of the best music concerts I have heard not just because of great music and singing but also because of the super band and high quality sound.  You might enjoy or be irritated, depending on your interests, by the commentary from Denver on nature in between the songs.",1438819200,6,642,4.415254237288136

When I close my eyes and sit back and listen to John's music, it brings me back to the 70s when times were different than they are today. I have to say that I still mourn the loss of John but yet, the sound of his voice and music will live inside of me forever. John, you may now be with the Ages, but you'll always be in the memories of your fans today.

John's voice, music and lyrics take me to a unique place where no other singer or music can take me where there is peace, reflection, love for nature and life and all the best of it. His music is timeless; you can appreciate his voice and all the instruments unlike much of today's music where there is a lot of noise and you cannot fully hear and appreciate the voice, the lyrics and the instruments. Nothing like an acoustic concert like The Wildlife Concert to really appreciate and understand what real good music is. John Denver left a wonderful legacy with his music and his work; he was not only a great singer, musician and songwriter but also an environmentalist who was and will continue to be an inspiration to many.",1377561600,,817,4.5646258503401365

191714,5,1573306983,"This DVD is a wonderful retrospective of John Denver's career as a master singer, songwriter and musician.  I own all of his albums and love to listen to this concert on CD.  But no CD can create the same atmosphere as seeing it all on video.  John is in top form here, with his richer more mature voice.  The recording is clear and crisp and almost like being there, though as one who has seen John over a dozen times in person, I know that he always sounded better live than in any recording.  This comes very close to those live performances. The selections from his many songs are varied and cover many of his hits, as well as other songs.  It is almost impossible to include all of his best songs in one DVD, but I would have loved to have Whispering Jesse included here, as well as a few other of my personal favorites.  But there are many stunning performances here including: Eagles & Horses, A Song For All Lovers, I Guess He'd Rather Be In Colorado, Calypso, Sunshine On My Shoulders, etc.  This  version of For You is the best I have ever heard, with the added plus of John accompanying himself on the piano.  This version of Amazon is my favorite also, with the extra added ending.  You can see the fun these talented musicians were having on these two great nights of the taping.  If I had to limit myself to just one of my John Denver videos, it would be this one.",1370822400,5,1378,4.2984496124031

I was deeply moved by what I heard and what I saw.  This film provided a chance to get to know John Denver in a way that helped make up for never having had the experience of spending time in a personal visit with him.  I personally do not know of any other film that provides as strong an intimate impact into Denver's personality and musicianship as a singer/songwriter; or that of any other such performer, for that matter!  I highly recommend this film product to anyone who has enjoyed and continues to enjoy John Denver's unique song and singing style, and the very special personal connection he established with his audiences.

I listen to it over and over and it brings back wonderful memories of a great man and great music.  The dvd is also a joy, and it is wonderful to see the actual concert -- smaller, intimate format -- and to get a closer, more personal look at John Denver.  He is tremendously missed but his music will live on forever in our hearts and lives!

To me, he was a true genius at song writing. And, bless his heart, you could understand every word he said. Not like the noise they call music now where you have no idea what they are saying.  He was a national treasure and died too young. I am so glad that I was able to see him in concert in Fort Worth,Texas many years ago, probably in the mid 80s. It was wonderful. Of course he had lived here at one time and made jokes about meeting old high school friends again.

Musical Performances: Outstanding
Sound Quality: Outstanding
Video/Picture Quality: Outstanding

Seeing John perform these classics reminded my wife and I how much he is sorely missed. Neither of us got to see him live while he was with us, so a DVD like this one is a treasure. He was one of a kind, and we'll probably never see anything like him again in this, or anyone else's, lifetime.

Don't let the fact that this was recorded back in 1995 worry you in terms of the sound and video quality. Not sure if this has been digitally restored, or if it was just recorded extremely well to begin with, but the picture and sound quality are more reminiscent of something that was just produced within the last couple years.

His interaction was pretty much nil and the best part was the snipits of him talking (as in video clips, not during the concert) about his life, music and the causes.....again, not the singing, production, composition.  Give to the foundation for sure, but buy a CD of his music, it just isn't as grand in this offering.",1324425600,4,472,4.541176470588235

. JD is older, voice mellow, and he looked as tho he was truly enjoying himself.  I felt as tho I was there, sitting in the front row.  Everybody was enjoying the concert and also enjoyed listening to his telling of his feelings of life and the importance of the mountains, rivers, etc., in his personal feelings.  This is a great dvd and you cannot help but want to join in and sing along too.  This, i feel, is the best of the dvd's that i have, so far.  Don't hesitate buying it if your a JD fan. You will not regret it.  His talent cannot be improved upon.
I am so glad that AMAZON has given me the chance to get all these wonderful dvd's, otherwise i might have not been able to see what i always felt i had missed out on. Merry Christmas 2011 to all.",1323820800,2,941,4.131868131868132

191755,5,1573306983,"This DVD is one to treasure for John Denver fans. He had a unique gift of communicating simplicity and earnestness in a way that was penetrating yet comforting at the same time. This concert finds him in beautiful voice and mature artistry. He never tries to oversell the song; it flows effortlessly from him and he always performs from within himself. His love ballads are particularly affecting; he sings with such feeling yet never imposes the emotion on the listener, allowing us to experience the joy, longing or sadness within ourselves. That is true artistry. I found myself unashamedly wiping tears away on several occasions.

His passion for his art and for wildlife preservation, communicated in the short interviews between songs, are infectious. Not hard to see why he inspired so many in his lifetime. Like many others who grew up in the 60's and 70's, some of the first songs I learned on the guitar were John Denver songs, which at the time just seemed like fun tunes to play. It's only been in recent years that I've learned to appreciate more fully the depth of his incredible gifts and legacy. He died not more than 2 years after this performance, and not more than 5 minutes from where I live in Pacific Grove, CA, in the waters of the Pacific Ocean. A huge loss for the world of music.",1310256000,,1305,4.64935064935065

191758,5,1573306983,"I watched this John Denver's Wildlife Concert dvd with my wife and made a fan out of her... so much so she wants to listen to his songs before heading out the door to work every morning. John captures the true essence of a ""western"" and ""country"" artist while displaying a true nature/wildlife conservationist. His music and songs take us back to a much simpler life... a time when a song is MEANT to be enjoy and sing along. My favorite is ""I Guessed He Rather Be In Colorado"" and ""For You""... truly heartwarming songs that tug right into your heart. If you enjoy his songs and still have some of his LP vinyl laying around the house, then this dvd is for you. His old songs and as well as his newer ones blend in so harmoniously to make you reminisce about rustic beauty of the Rockies!! Stroll along the ""country roads"" with John Denver. I have certainly done so for twenty years... along with ""the sunshine on my shoulders""!!

It's always a pleasure to listen to his music.  This Wildlife concert was to highlight his music and his love and interest in the environment.  Between every few songs John stops singing and talks about his inspiration for why he wrote a particular song.  I didn't find it distracting since many of John songs he wrote himself.  It's nice to hear the background.
This DVD has beautifully clear video and sound.  The concert runs almost 2 hours (113min) of pure enjoyment for John Denver fans.",1289088000,,643,4.530434782608696

This DVD was really impressive-- and I think it really showed us the John Denver of his later years.  My absolute favorite song on this DVD is ""Eagles and Horses""--- it's so amazingly beautiful and he sings it effortlessly and magically.

When I received the DVD I thought to myself, I'll just put it on, I probably won't watch all of it,I might watch a bit now and another bit later in the week, well let me tell you, I was enthralled, I could not move away for the DVD.  It was briliant, his voice is a gift to the world.  I read some of the reviews and I was impressed enough to buy it.  I have always loved John Denver, I never really listened properly to his words and their meaning behind every song he sings.  He is truly inspirational, I found him to be gentle, genuine, humble and most importantly he loved his audience, he loved what he did, and gave of himself totally.  I have had a casette tape of his for over 30 years, when I saw that I could see him on a DVD, I jumped at the chance.  I am so sorry that he left us so early in the piece, for what he did for humanity and for conservation, I pray that he and Steve Erwin exchange notes up there, for they were both humanatarian leaders both loved and truly missed.

Have a wonderful day !

Whether or not you were a fan of the late great John Denver, this beautifully-produced concert is a joy to watch capturing a truly remarkable night in music.  A fitting tribute to a man of so much passion and talent, this video showcases his amazing abilities as a truly gifted performer, songwriter and activist with an incredible knack for connecting with his audience. Surrounded by an amazing cast of musicians, I was continually in awe of the caliber of content...song after song beautifully performed...the only downside was the inevitable recognition of just how premature his passing was. Luckily though, his lasting legacy lives on in his music and in this wonderful Wildlife Concert.

In case you couldn't tell, I highly recommend this product!",1236902400,2,790,5.116279069767442
191769,5,1573306983,"I have been listening to John since I was a young lad back when ""An Evening with John Denver"" was released. John was a wonderful songwriter that sung from his heart. He was a perfromer, yes, but he beleived what he was singing about. I have always found great love for his music, it is most inspiring! The Wildlife concert was no different.

As was his habbit in the past, John always surounded himself with the best musicians available. James Burton played better then he ever did with Elvis back in the TCB days. IMHO, Pete Huttlinger is one of the finest string men I have ever heard: flawless.

John himself was never better! I have watched and listened to this concert many times over. If there was a noticable flaw or mistake in John's playing, I sure missed it! His voice was more mature and mellow. He seemed to sing with great ease and comfort. This was John's finest live recording.

I do have one criticism of this concert and that is aimed squarly at Sony. This was a two night concert and depending on what recording you buy, determines what part of it you will get. I would love to see Sony release the whole concert in one recording\DVD.

That being said, it would be awesume to hear this kind of music back in the top fourty. John was a true enigma, you could not put John's music in a box and lable it as style A! Remember when Charlie Rich burned John's country music nomination on stage! John's music was uniquely John Denver!

191772,4,1573306983,"I wasn't, maybe still aren't, a huge John Denver fan.  Although I was of course familiar with his biggest hits. As a pianist in a small combo in the early '70's, I know how to get through a chorus of ""Country Roads"" in good shape.

But I wasn't prepared for the onslaught of this video. This is one really fine performance.  By Denver AND by his band.  Nearly 2 hours.  Denver never resorts to tricks.  Never changes clothes or seems to take a break (although there HAD to be an intermission).  Just stands there and sings, and makes you believe it.  He is in fine voice and just always right on pitch.  If anything, his singing becomes more passionate as the concert progresses.  What vocal stamina he must have had.  And the connection with his audience was remarkable.

If you like Denver's music in any way at all, then treat yourself to this DVD and you won't be sorry.  This is just one of the finest music concert videos I have ever seen. No gimicks here.  There is some commentary that was added later by Denver. In total, it may amount to 10 minutes or less.

Plenty of room for the music.  All of Denver's biggies and then some. The video is standard full frame, don't expect a wide screen format. Audio is in two flavors, standard Dolby, and DTS 5.1  The latter seemed to me the best for hearing the lyrics better,",1231372800,3,1325,4.386831275720165

I met John personally in the 70s and he amazed me with his down to earth warmth and charming character. The only downside to the video was it felt at times like a PBS fundraiser. The cause he supported is just, however and fitting to what he stood for. The last song left us in tears knowing how he left this life....I'm leaving on a jet plane don't know when I'll be back again. He will come back each time you watch this video or hear his songs.

The concert was outside under the stars in the Rocky Mountains.

191786,5,1573306983,"I own two VHS tapes of the Wildlife Concert.  Now, thanks to Amazon.com, I also own the DVD.  This is the very best performance of John Denver's much too short career and life. It contains songs many of you will not know or remember.  He aged better than a fine wine.  His beautiful voice became more beautiful with each passing year.

I was always in awe of him, inspired by him, and felt validated by him.  Being very much like him, feeling the same way about my planet, hunger, wildlife, children, animals, and the ecology, made it easy for me to relate to him.  He felt what I felt and I'm sure I know how he somehow felt a ""man apart"", so to speak.  I understood.

But John Denver put his heart and his soul into lyrics, then to music. His voice will forever be unequaled.  Nothing on this earth, other than a horse, is a beautiful as John Denver's voice.  On this DVD, as on no other CD or DVD, is that voice more beautiful or the message more powerful. I miss you, John.

Features the ability to turn on or off written lyrics so you can sing along (or prevent someone from singing along if they don't know the words). Instant chapter access to songs, so you can play your favorites easily. In-depth biography allows those of us who never knew him (and those who did) to know him a little better. Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound or Dolby Stereo.

So many incredible songs! Country Roads, Back Home Again, Rocky Mountain High, Fly Away, Annie's Song, Sunshine (on My Shoulders), Calypso, Leaving on a Jet Plane, Good-bye Again, and many more!

I loved it. This is something anyone can support, even with John Denver gone, that can make a difference in a world increasingly off-balance environmentally. What a legacy to leave behind!

After watching this DVD I knew I had to own it! More than ever, I appreciate his musicianship. In addition to being a great writer/composer, he actually was a very good guitarist. The clarity and range of his voice truly was amazing even in his later years when this was filmed. I never heard his voice crack, and he didn't miss a single note. His tribute to Jacques Cousteau with his performance of ""Calypso"" was masterful and inspiring. If it doesn't bring a tear to your eye or lift your soul, you need to check for a pulse.

191815,5,1573306983,"Do yourself a favor and buy this DVD.  Because of the small audience and the intimate setting of the performance it feels as though John is giving a private concert in your home.  You're going to watch this time-and-again, and you will want to share this with friends and family.

Just be forewarned that even though there's much to enjoy with this DVD - and you most definitely get more than your money's worth - you will be disappointed when it comes to an end and you're left wishing that each and every one of John Denver's songs could have been presented in this same intimate setting.  Buy several; they'll make great gifts.",1117324800,5,630,4.548672566371682

I was fortunate to have seen him twice in concert and he was one of those rare performers that was always better live than on any recording, and this dvd captures that.  The only criticism I have is that I wish they would have included more songs.  There are a few tracks on the cd version of the Wildlife Concert that are not included here, and I would have loved to have seen them performed.",1109808000,4,456,4.159090909090909
191817,5,1573306983,"Words can not express the joy that I feel for John Denver's great performance in this concert. This is a mature John Denver in great form. He was just beginning the 2nd half of his life. This celebration of the music that has made John Denver an American treasure is a live and intimate performance featuring his greatest hits and several brand-new songs. Also included are candid interviews with John, spectacular wildlife footage and some very special surprise selections. The running time is 113 minutes. To some viewers this is John's best live concert of his career. It is a huge treat. In addition, it was a fundraiser for a very good cause - wildlife preservation.

191818,5,1573306983,"I saw part of this concert on PBS recently but was turned off by all the PBS fund raising commercials between songs.  I decided to purchase the DVD and am so glad I did.  This is John Denver at his absolute best. His voice is rich and clear.  The small band is terrific.  This is a very intimate concert done in front of a small but very enthusiastic audience. He interacts with the audience and encourages them to sing along with him.  Listening to him brought back great memories of good friends and college days. He talks about the environment and how much we can help save our planet. It was also interesting to hear him speak about his music and how he considered himself a ""western"" singer/songwriter.  I had never heard his song ""For You"" until I saw this DVD.  It is by far one of the most beautiful love songs I have ever heard. This concert was recorded in 1995 and it proves John Denver was, as ever, a great performer, musician, singer and songwriter.",1104278400,7,963,4.406779661016949

191820,5,1573306983,"For those of us who grew up with him, watching John Denver so suddenly emerge onto the national stage as the huge talent he was is a memory savored and protected in these harsher times. I remember driving to graduate classes and hearing ""Annie's Song"" for the first time. it was quite an experience. I remember listening to ""Rocky Mountain High"" and how it affected me in terms of my growing appreciation for wild nature and the need for conservation. More than anything else, for me John still symbolizes that better part of our common human nature that those of us ragged,and hopefully ""gracefully aging"" counterculturists still associate with what personal enlightment and true education can do to transform this into a finer and more sustainable planet. Thus, this wonderful set of DVD (and also available CD recordings) that comprise the entire ""Wildlife Concert"" offering is a wonderous gift that reminds of of the immense range of talents and sensitivities he shared with us in his brief time on earth.

Of course, you can rest assured that all of his famous songs are here, as well as a number of newer and less well known works, which are included as well. In the end, one is simply amazed at the freshness and novelty he is able to bring to bear in his presentation of many of the offerings here, in the wonderful way in which he performs some of these songs, singing lyrics he had sung thousands of times but seeming just as fresh and new as the first times he performed them. Like many artists, he doesn't necessarily stick to the familiar sound of the recorded version, and while that might annoy a few patrons who prefer the overly-familiar stamped-out record version, for me it is an indication of his great artistic prowess to able to do so this convincingly after all this time, and to do so with such aplomb, enthusiasm, and flavor. The comforting thing to understand is that at the time he had the concert, close to the time he died in the tragic airplane accident that abruptly ended his life, he seemed at the top of his form, regaining lost popularity, and ready to record new works in progress. This is a wonderful DVD, and one I recommend to all John Denver fans. Enjoy!",1094083200,94,2194,4.640102827763497
191821,5,1573306983,"Over the years, I have purchased most of John Denver's LPs and then CDs, and also observed several of his performances on television. (Regrettably, I was never in the audience at one of his concerts.) Recently I saw the PBS program during which the program on this DVD was recorded over a two-day period. Denver has never sounded better nor seemed happier than he does during The WILDLife Concert, totally comfortable playing a rich and diverse selection of older and newer songs. How rare and commendable that he makes each of the 25 seem so fresh. He is joined by immensely talented associates, notably James Burton, Jim Horn, and Pete Huttinger. FYI, this DVD and its companion two-disc CD include the previously unreleased ""For You"" which is not available elsewhere. I lack the talent to express how much I admire and will miss this talented and good man.",1093392000,35,859,4.8108108108108105
191822,5,1573306983,"I have never enjoyed watching a concert as much as I did this Wildlife Concert.  Several of John's songs brought tears to my eyes, as if John was singing them for the first time feeling all the feelings he experienced when he first recorded them. The only thing that should have been left in were more of his comments during the actual concert. It is just impossible to get enough John Denver, but this DVD gets as close as any. Whether he is with full backup or simply by himself either at the piano or playing his guitar, John puts on an emotional, heartfelt, lasting performance.",1086652800,17,582,4.490566037735849

Anyone who has a heart for this planet and its fate should lend an ear to John Denver's message. It cannot be expressed with more eloquence, beauty, sincerity, and poignancy. A true gem!",1061596800,14,347,4.612903225806452
191824,5,1573306983,"If you are a John Denver fan or a fan of acoustic singer/songwriters, then you will love this DVD.  I know many people consider John Denver cheesy but I've always loved his music.  To me, he is able to bring emotion to his written words better than any other singer/songwriter.  Most performers really struggle after the heat of their career flames out.  Having read Denver's biography, he did have those problems that may have led to some of his DUI charges.
But when John Denver hit the stage, he always gave a great performance because he really connected with the audience and it showed.  And since this concert was for the Wildlife charity, his performance was close to his heart with personal testimony between some of the songs that drew John to tears.
The stage presence and set-up was excellent and the DVD includes the audience participation by the mostly middle-aged fans.  For novice guitar players like myself there is plenty of film of John and the lead guitarist to help discover the magic of how he gets beautiful sound from his instrument.  While all his old standards are here, there is plenty of off-the-beaten path material if you haven't watched Denver in concert.  My particular favorite is the song written about the Alaska couple that dance after her husband's death. Denver had a unique ability to project great imagery.
Most of his songs that deal with wilderness and the west are here which leaves out two of my favorites, his ode to the astronauts of the Columbia tragedy and his anti-war song with the Russian singer. With that aside, this DVD will always be a great memory of John Denver's career and his passion for the outdoors.  I strongly recommend this DVD if you like singer/songwriters of the 70s era.",1052265600,56,1738,4.74750830564784
191835,5,1573306983,"I had been oblvious to the music and spirit of John Denver for about 20 years.  Then a friend of mine bought this DVD and lent it to me.  I played it and was blown away.  I immediately got my own copy.  I have lent it to others, and everyone has likewise been blown away by it.  I have become a confirmed JD fan.
A week or so after getting my own copy, I came home from work completely stressed out.  I put the concert on, and over the course of the next 2 hours I could actually feel the stress melt away.  At the end, I felt great.  I was responding not only to the great music, but also to the wonderful spirit and great humanity of John Denver.
Some of the songs and interview segments bring tears to the eyes. I found it particulary poignant to listen to him sing the wonderful lyrics to ""Poems, Prayers and Promises"", while realizing that he is now gone from us.  Watch the sheer joy with which he performs ""Amazon"", which was a new song to me, and has now become one of my favorites.  He and the band were really cookin'on this one.
The supporting musicians are especially outstanding.  A string quartet, James Burton on guitar and especially Jim Horn on wind instruments added immeasurably to the concert.  I am saddened that I never got to see John perform.  This concert DVD, however, is the next best thing.  I only wish ther were another six or eight songs on it.  If you loved John Denver, or even if you only kinda liked him, you will love this disc.  It was worth every penny.  Long live the music and spirit of John Denver!",1051660800,8,1539,4.233676975945017

191837,3,1573306983,"I feel that it did not capture the full richness of John Denver that you would find in a real concert from an arena.

They don't get any better than this. JD sung all the old favourites plus a stack of new ones. It is a long concert, but one that you will enjoy all the way through. Even if you are not a JD fan, you will enjoy this exceptional concert. This concert, which was filmed with the DVD medium in mind, was far better than when I saw Denver live in concert in the late '70s in Australia. This is one of the two best DVD music concerts I have seen (the other is ""Down from the Mountain""). Thank God they did this concert with DVD in mind because think of how many great artists have died, and how future generations will never be able to see their best performances. That's not the case with John Denver. With this one DVD, the ""boy from the mountains"" lives on!",1038441600,23,1017,4.414893617021277

I hadn't realized that there are DVD available so I will  be purchasing that because of the lyrics included, as I am hearing  impaired.  Oh how I wish I could have been there.  I put the video in and  turned our surround system on, and we (my boyfriend Ron and I) thought we  had died and gone to heaven.  I do believe this was the best I have ever  heard John sing, but he has always sung beautifully and I have always love  his voice. It just seemed he just kept getting better and better.  John's  voice has always made me either melt, get goose bumps or feel such emotions  that I could never describe them.  As we listened and watch him perform,  (we talked about it afterward), everything else cease to exit.  I was  trying very hard not to start crying.  Ron broke down when ""Sunshine  on my Shoulder"" was sung.  I finally broke down when in one of the  insert interview, John talked about how much he loved fishing and taking  Zak with him and how he hoped to someday take his grandchildren with him.  Tragically this will never happen.  We cried not so much that the songs  were so moving as they are, but that John is no longer here to spread his  gift, heart, kindness, gentleness and much, much more.  I would have loved  to have met this wonderful person.  I do have a new favorite song now  though, and grateful that I have it, as it has never been recorded in a  studio and the only way you'll get to hear it is on this Wildlife Concert.  I play it over and over till I drive my kids crazy with it.  It also made  me see just how romantic he was and I'm willing to bet a wonderful lover.  My Ron needs a few lesson from John, so maybe if I play it enough and make  Ron listen, he'll get the hint, LOL. I know I sure envy the lucky women  that had the opportunity to be intimate with him.  That song is called  ""FOR YOU"".  (I did notice the pain in John's eye as he was  singing this song though, was it the longing to find that kind of love, or  was it lost love?  It made my heart ache for him.)  This is the kind of  song that any woman in her right mind would want a man to sing or say to  her and vise versa for men.  I do know that if Ron and I ever get married  this will be our wedding song....  My heart goes out to John's mom, Ron,  his brother, Zak, Anna Kate and Jesse Belle, his children.  You were all  very lucky to have such a loved one in your lives...oh and what memories  you must cherish.  John will never be forgotten, for generations to  come.

John puts on such a wonderful performance. The video and  audio quality is wonderful. On-screen lyrics are included.
I love the  accompanying strings in this performance. They give his songs an especially  melodic quality. This is a trend I've noticed lately in live performances  that I hope continues.
""For You"" is a wonderful love song that  pulls on my heart strings every time I hear it. It's one of the loveliest  love songs I've ever heard. And what a moving rendition is included on this  DVD. If there is a romantic bone in your body, you'll love this song. I'm  moved every time I play it!

This video, in my opinion was sent to us by the invisible man in  the sky. Like one of his songs, this video is ""almost heaven"".  John talks in this concert, you see wildlife, and hear his voice, which  will never be heard again. He sings with his heart in this, tells stories,  and when we really miss him like I do, all we have to do is listen to the  ""Wildlife Concert"" and John is with us again!  John belongs to  us all, and with the eagles, hawks, elephants and every other animal and  ego system in the world. He says in the vedio, that he wants to be  remembered for what he has done, and this is it, working almost full time  to save the rain forest, animal habtat, the rivers of the U.S. N/W as well  as others....This is a vedio that can be shared with others, especially  your kids. Yes, John is part of all of us, get the vedio and enjoy like we  all that loved him. He was a real friend of mine, but you too can realize  the joy of his songs which comes from the heart, his soul and all that he  puts into all the things he does. SINCE HIS DEATH, WE NEED TO PICK UP WHERE  HE LEFT OFF, LIKE HE SAYS IN THE VEDIO, WE ALL CAN DO OUR PART, NO MATTER  HOW SMALL.  So John has gone to a better world now, and we will be with  him soon, but for now we have this vedio. Believe me this is the best vedio  I have in my collection, money well spent.

It is a great tribute to the man, the musician, and to the passions he holds for  our world.  Please, re-release this video in dvd!!!",922406400,,271,4.056603773584905
191885,5,1573306983,"This video is for fans who have listened to John Denver since the early seventies, as well as newer fans who may have started listening after his tragic death.  There was so much more to him than ""Rocky Mountain  High"" and ""Country Roads"" and this video brings it all out.  His voice seemed stronger than ever and the short interviews give a quick  and heartfelt insight to what he was all about. I can't wait for the DVD.",920937600,,422,4.371794871794871
