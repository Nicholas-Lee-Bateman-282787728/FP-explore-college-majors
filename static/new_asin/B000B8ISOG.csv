8083488,5,B000B8ISOG,"I am a fan of boys choir music and have many CDs and some excellent DVDs. Favourites being Kings College Cambridge, Westminster and the German Regensberg and of course the Vienna Boys Choir. Having listened to many great boy trebbles perform there seems to be a few outstanding singers. There are several opinions on who are the best, but in my view we have: Max Emanual Cencic, Aled Jones, Tery Wey,J B Marnier, and the boy featured on the DVD, Steven Mockel.

In my view the voice of Steven is the best of all, it is a pity that there are not more recordings featuring him. Steven sings 1st Soprano in the Sub Tuum Praesidium along with Alfred Halbartschlager. Steven's singing avoids the thin,sound,weakness, too often associated with boys voices. His full warm, solid sound is superior to all others I've heard over many years
This DVD is the most precious of all my DVDs. Any serious collector needs to have this DVD.",1302739200,,922,4.656441717791411
8083489,5,B000B8ISOG,"In this masterly performance the Vienna Boys Choir aged between 10 and 14 hold their own brilliantly with the professional males from the State Opera Company that sing with them. The vocalists are accompanied by the State Opera Orchestra and the concert is ably conducted by Uwe Christian Harrer whose music interpretation and the clarity of the conducting signals he gives to the perfomers are very impressive. Mozart's ""Waisenhaus Mass"" is performed in the Imperial Hofburg Chapel, Vienna where, every Sunday for over 500 years, a contingent of the Vienna Boys Choir has sung during mass. Following this the scene shifts to the parish church of St. Stephens in Baden bei Wien where five smaller choral works of Mozart are performed. The fourth of these - Sub Tuum Praesidium - features a duet by Vienna Choir boys which is absolutely superb. All works are sung in Latin, but it isn't the words that make the concert memorable; it is the music. A pamphlet accompanying the dvd provides an English translation of the Latin. Incidentally, it is not the policy of the Vienna Boys Choir to disclose the names of the boy soloists no matter how brilliant they are. The school's 100 boys, divided into four choirs, are dedicated to teamwork, discipline and excellence - it is enough to be a member. I highly recommend this wonderful and heart warming musical display of Austrian youth at their very best.",1299283200,,1398,4.878151260504202
8083490,5,B000B8ISOG,"What a pleasure to listen to these beautiful voices.  A great addition to any DVD library.  The Vienna Boys and Men Choir performance is definitely a pleasure to listen and watch.

8083491,5,B000B8ISOG,"Music, cameras, audio, performers, director, settings ... everything put perfectly together here like one of Mozart's compositions!!
I enjoy so much Max Emanuel Cencic's performance especially in the 'Gloria'.  He has such a beautiful soprano voice!  Also the two angels that sing in a duet the 'Sub tuum Praesidium, K 198'.  And in general all the children in the choir!!  Thanks to Mr Harrer for such a fine job.  I just can hope that there will be more of this kind of productions in the future with the Vienna Boys' Choir... another miracle!",1197244800,,545,4.817204301075269
8083492,5,B000B8ISOG,"These recordings (well reviewed elsewhere) may be from around 1990, but this is the best Wiener Sangerknaben DVD I've found, certainly far better than the 2006 DVD ""A Mozart Celebration"" with its disappointing boy and adult soloists. A now-better-known soloist Max Emanuel Cencic, noted for his stunning technique, makes a brief appearance only. His later solo CD plus his adult countertenor CDs now are available. The most beautiful boy's voice I've ever heard, however, (the ""Gundula Janowitz"" of boys) was Steven M&ouml;ckel who sang 1st Soprano in Sub Tuum Praesidium, K198 along with an unidentified second soprano (usually misidentified as Max Emanuel Cencic.) Steven's singing avoids the thin sound, weakness, and unevenness too often associated with boys' voices. His full, warm, solid sound is superior to all other whom I've heard in all my years. This DVD is well worth having just for this. I have found no other recordings of this angelic voice, although ironically this one piece appears on Cencic's solo CD.",1174348800,,1022,5.237804878048781
8083493,5,B000B8ISOG,Dear lord. this is just....it makes me tear up every time. I'm convinced that the vienna boys choir's rendition of Canon in D is the most beautiful song on earth. Nothing could sound more angelic. It would take a heart of stone not to be moved by that. i had to turn it off 4 hours ago and i'm still swooning over it.,1164153600,2,317,4.0476190476190474
8083494,3,B000B8ISOG,"Of course the music from the Vienna Boys Choir was great..... but I was very disappointed with the poor resolution of the video.

Perhaps it was full screen cut out of a wide screen recording, blowing up a smaller part of the original to the extent that it was no longer sharp, or perhaps it was just a poor resolution recording or perhaps simply poor translation from the recording to the DVD. I don't know.

But in any case, I am disappointed by the image quality and I regret not having simply bought an audio CD. For the price of the DVD I could have had a couple of the Vienna Boys' Choir's other audio CDs.",1142985600,4,612,4.267241379310345
8083495,5,B000B8ISOG,"Mozart's choral works are among the finest but least celebrated of the composer's incredible legacy.  In this audio and video treasure, we get to hear and see some of these performed by the incomparable Vienna Boys Choir in two historical settings in the old city in which Mozart spent so much of his creative life.

The camera work is superb, blending first class musical performances with scenes from the locations where they were done.

What is needed now is an updated version of these, or other Mozart choral works, done by the Vienna Boys Choir.  While the DVD faithfully portrays the gorgeous sights and sounds of the original performances, they were done in 1988 and 1990.  Undoubtedly, the Vienna Boys Choir is still up to the standard  shown in those years.  The boys and Mozart deserve another and more recent recording session.",1141603200,9,839,4.866197183098592
8083496,5,B000B8ISOG,"Uwe Christian Harrer's performance of Mozart Choral works with the Vienna Boys Choir, members of the Vienna State Opera Chorus, and members of the Vienna State Opera Orchestra is nothing short of miraculous.  Filmed in two beautiful Vienna churches, one of them formerly the Chapel of the Imperial Palace, these are truly beautiful Video/Audio experiences.  Mozart's music is well served:  the Vienna Choir Boys sing the soprano and alto parts, with tenor and bass parts sung by the men of the Vienna State Opera Chorus.

Harrer sets sensible tempos, and is animated with the music, but not an interpreter who calls attention to himself, a la Bernstein, Solti, Stokowski, or Tennstedt.  He is a SERVANT of the music, giving clear direction and very sensible beats, and a great sense of ensemble results from his direction.  Harrer emphasizes the choral textures of Mozart's writing, here in the early Waisenhaus Mass in C minor (recorded here in 1988), written when Mozart was just 12 years old!  All of this work may not be top drawer Mozart, but Harrer and his forces do just about what can be done with it.  There are varied solos for boy soprano and alto, and tenor and bass, which alternate with fugal/polyphonic and homophonic full chorus textures, introductory and alternating choral parts.  The ""Gloria"" and ""Credo"" movements are in several alternating sections, and stick less in my mind than the Kyrie, Sanctus, and Agnus Dei.  Camera work in excellent, catching the various choir sections singing at a given moment, or the 1st violins, trumpet or trombone when they have an important part.

The shorter choral works, recorded in 1990, deal with the adoration of Mary, the mother of Jesus Christ - very important in the Roman Catholic liturgy and theology in Austria during Mozart's time (Moreso than today, since Vatican II, 1962-65) and also the adoration of the Host:  the consecrated bread, believed by Roman Catholics to be Christ's true body in the Mass.  These are all works unfamiliar to me (except the closing ""Ave Verum Corpus"") but are very beautiful, showing a wonderful sacred side of Mozart, a real contrast to his operas, for example,""The Marriage of Figaro"" and ""Don Giovanni"".

I hope there are more DVD recordings forthcoming from the Vienna Boys Choir under Mr. Harrer.  Excellent digital stereo sound, and wonderful picture quality (full screen, 4:3) make this a great experience.  I nearly wept during the closing ""Ave Verum Corpus,"" a quiet homophonic anthem of adoration to the crucified body of Christ.  The accompaniment of a chamber orchestra makes this a more beautiful experience than I realized was possible.  Yes, Mozart's music is well served here!

In a word, ""GLORIOUS!""",1138579200,21,2713,5.042600896860987
