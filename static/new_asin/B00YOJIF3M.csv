7223285,4,B00YOJIF3M,"Very strong beginning and pretty solid throughout. It could have been more fleshed out as far as back story or a lot really, but I think it is quite excellent with good performances by all the characters except the little boy, but that was the writers' fault by giving him being a mute.
This is one of Amazon's better offerings these days.
I recommend this to everyone liking a good scary play with nods to J.G. Ballard and Michael Crichton.
Well done.",1459641600,5,452,4.524390243902439
7223286,1,B00YOJIF3M,"Okay, where to begin.. I enjoyed the actors for the most part and their delivery of the script was done well, the script itself however and the character development was very disappointing. The plot had glimmers of hope from the onset then just fell to pieces with poor writing. Maybe a grand vision was limited in scope by budgetary concerns but whatever the case may be the end result is a wonky, half assed action & suspense flick that becomes laughable when it tried to deliver either.",1459555200,5,489,4.632183908045977

7223292,3,B00YOJIF3M,"I bought this locally. I can't fault the acting. The actors gave fine performances. No issues with dialogue, etc. As a movie dealing with fear and the unknown, it was fine. However, I didn't go higher than 3 stars as I found the plot and ending weak. I find it unlikely that a highly contagious, 100% fatal (presumably) and non-containable airborne disease (unidentified which was also annoying) could have raged for a month with no one noticing (the old ""government-kept-it-a-secret-to-avoid-panic"" line that I find tiresome and silly). I also find it implausible that soldiers could enter several apartment buildings and seal each and every door without anyone noticing--even late at night. Their containment was also weak--sniper(s) on roof tops don't contain anything--And shooting panicked people running is no way to prevent panic. I saw nothing of an actual perimeter having been established. And would the army set up a single medical tent for hundreds of people? As I said, the acting was fabulous but I just didn't find the plot worthy.",1443571200,16,1046,5.12280701754386
7223293,4,B00YOJIF3M,"Some of you may have heard about this film and felt unsure whether it was worth watching or not.  I know I did.  I finally decided to give it a try (partly because I got it at a bargain price) and I was glad that I did.

This film was made in Great Britain and the cast is generally British.  Almost all of them have appeared in other films, though generally not ones that Ive watched.  There is English sub-titling available but the British (and other) accents were quite toned down and the soundtrack was quite clear, so generally I could follow what was being said even without subtitles.

The blurb on the dust jacket and in short reviews makes this sound like some kind of horror film.  Residents in an apartment complex wake up and find themselves sealed in and cut off from all communication with the outside world.  People in orange hazmat suits have surrounded the placeand snipers do not hesitate to shoot anyone trying to escape.  And nobody is telling them what is going on.

I guess in a sense you CAN call this a horror film, but its hardly comparable to The Exorcist, nor even to Resident Evil or 28 Days Later.  It is really hard to say much more about the plot here without dropping spoilers right & left for anyone who hasn't seen it.  Ill just say that, as with any good horror, science fiction or fantasy film, no matter how interesting the special effects, or how far-fetched the story might appear, the real story is all about the people involved and how they react and interact (as opposed to a BAD thriller, like<ahem> some of the Godzilla films, in which case the monster itself becomes the most interesting character).

This film succeeds in keeping the real interest on the characters and their varying reactions to the situation, although the story itself is also interesting.  There really are not a lot of special effects and the story is linear.  Nothing else is allowed to intrude excessively and distract from the story line.  If you ever watch this kind of thing, youll probably find it interesting.  And if I had any complaint, it would be about the lack of special features on the DVD.  The only specials (besides a commentary track which as usual I don't take the time to listen to) were 2 fairly short deleted scenes.  The theatrical version runs a modest 90 minutes.  I would have liked to hear the script writer / director talk about the concepts they had in mind in creating the story, in some 15 or 20 minute bonus feature.  Alas, the story itself is all you get--at least for now.  Either that or the full-on commentary track...",1442966400,27,2571,4.543478260869565

Don't bother with the how's and why's of what is happening. While I'm not one who totally buys into the notion that humans go from civil to nutso in a matter of hours the story is believable enough. I'm not going to spoil anything but this movie pulls no punches in 'well that sucks' moments. Overall, I was kept in the story long enough to care about certain characters.

7223311,2,B00YOJIF3M,"In this movie, nothing you care about will actually be answered. The plot may of been far better if it focused both from the cast perspective and of the outside group perspective. Unfortunately this isn't possible because it would make the entire movie pointless if we know what the containment team knows. The only answer to give you some perspective of how the virus works is at the very end, indirectly though the visual of the scene. The scope, response, how it started, why it is in this area, and what hope the people have are all questions left unanswered.

The writer couldn't make up their mind on how they wanted it to end so they did 2 different ideas in one scene.  The final scene part 1 gives us a reveal though a visual, but the ending scene part to (what is focused on before credits) was something I think the writer forced into the plot.

7223333,2,B00YOJIF3M,"While this is slightly spoilery, it's all quite early and good to know before wasting your time. I'd call this movie ""okay"" but I don't feel three stars reflects the way in which it is.

For starters, our hero awakes to find his power off, water off, window not opening, and door epoxied shut. While the utilities being cut is perfectly plausible, and the door epoxy at least has some vague believability, though how a horde of people epoxying up a huge apartment building in the night went unnoticed is quite a stretch, it's never even mentioned how they managed to stop the windows from unlatching, or why people don't just break them. It makes no sense.

And then there's the fact that no one manages to guess oh, hey, this is a quarantine, despite it being fairly obvious even before the mention over the loudspeakers of ""A medical team will be there soon."" No, they need it specifically spelled out five different ways by a certain character.

I didn't find the characterization or acting horrible. Even one fairly one-dimensional violence-prone fellow was fairly believable considering the world's filled with those, especially in high-stress situations.

The plot, though relies on a lot of very outrageous suspension of disbelief, and the ending is very unsatisfying. I'd say it left me wanting to see what happened next for some actual resolution on the situation, but I just didn't care at that point.

It's not so bad it's good, it doesn't have anything remarkable to make it worth watching like an interesting premise or disease or character. It's just wholly unremarkable in the worst way. Not a horrible movie, but not one worthy of your time.",1485648000,3,1657,4.840989399293286

The acting wasn't awful but I feel as though they were trying to hard. The acting wanted you to care too much about things when you are not emotionally invested. The settings are weak. An apartment building and a tent are basically the only places in this movie. Pretty slow paced. Movie confuses you with some scenes that don't make sense. I think the movie used it's confusion and mystery to allow the characters to have some sort of identity but in the end it really didn't make sense or at the very least it wasn't strung together coherently enough. Plus SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT the ending was pretty bad as the main character gets taken out by some random guy.. after turning his back to him stupidly.. these people were basically killing each other b4 and he just turns his back to him and gets stabbed, shortly after he sits down on a swing he tells the kid he was with to go ahead and he will catch up. He doesnt, he just dies on the swing .Again, hardly emotionally invested in the main character or any other characters for that matter.

We are supposed to be in their shoes, moving through the situation together, confused and worried. Kind of like a nightmare where you hope people will act decent, but as the dream goes on, things just get worse until you can't breathe and finally wake up. It also helped that I so happened to be watching in a stuffy room, making the ""containment"" effect even more real. The only part I didn't agree on was the end - it didn't feel complete as some commented. And who dies from a stab wound in the waist? Lols.
Big ups to Lee Ross though, and the writer for fantastic suspense and dialogue, you sonava.

Not in the sense that it's not worth of being called a film, but in the sense that everyone wasted their time. The producers, actors, directors, all other crew members, and the viewers have all wasted our time.

With the title and genre in mind, this movie starts out as one would expect. It is the wet dream of some conspiracy theorist whacko that doesn't understand that the character attribute of government treating citizens as if they aren't human beings is projection of their inability to believe governments are made up of human beings too. The movie presents the tired idea that informing the public would cause a panic while simultaneously expecting the viewer to just ignore the military style field hospital, orange hazmat suits, and carefully and hermetically sealed apartment blocks as if none of those things would cause any panic. At some point I expected a rational mind to step forward and calm the residents down by giving the slightest bit of vague explanation as to what's going on, but that sure didn't happen.

On top of all that the movie goes nowhere. It tells no compelling character story, it gives no great insight into how viral outbreaks are contained, and worst of all it seems as if they spent entirely too much money to produce the most mediocre and boring film I've ever seen.

Then they see persons in hazard suits moving around on the street setting up a field hospital. The tenants are not informed about what is going on (an epidemic) and soon they start going nuts, not helped by one of the tenants being a psychopath.

This movie is what happens when directors and writers do a film over something they know nothing about. Movies that portray an extraordinary event should try to maintain a certain degree of probability, otherwise the film comes across as stupid. For example, how was it that each apartment was sealed in, the windows and doors locked without a single person noticing, even at night? Why was it necessary to cut off electricity? Why was it necessary to keep the tenants uninformed, thereby creating paranoia? And besides, since when is containment of a disease carried out to such a ridiculously extreme (not to mention inept) ?

It's a very typical siege film, where people have to deal with both the outside forces sealing them in and the internal tensions that arise between those trapped together. The acting was quite good and the script was a nuanced reflection of everyday working class Brits and their various concerns about things like immigration, terrorism, government control, relationships with their neighbours, distrust of authorities, etc. These factors gave it a realistic feel and made what could have just been just another siege movie more interesting for me.

Or is it like the Spanish flu that killed primarily people who where in their 20s-40s while leaving the older generations and younger generations for the most part intact? A second movie should be made this time from the wife's perspective, have the virus get out of control for a while and have the wife of the guy and the son meet up with the surviving kids , and bring back the guy in a twist. Where the guy was actually found and taken back to a Government hospital where they are running test on his body to see what made him last longer than the others in the quarantine, thats where they find out more details about the virus aka who is most vulnerable, how infection can occur if it has the potential to become water born or maybe be transmitted through animals since I'm sure that scavengers where picking at the bodies that where left in the open, and take the virus trough the stages of a viral plage.
