2564415,3,B000FG8BO6,"This is a very interesting documentary. It shows us a part of the suicide terrorists cult that's normally hidden. Besides a short history of the cult, it show us the members of the support network behind them, their family, their colleagues, friends and other terrorist. Especially the first part of the documentary shows us frank interviews with these people. To understand this people a bit better it helps if you already know a thing or two about the Islamic ideology (A quick basic read could be:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Now-They-Call-Me-Infidel/dp/1595230319/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Now They Call Me Infidel</a>).

But the conclusions the movie make are quite ignorant and the further the movie comes the more apparent they become. Although Robert Baer, a former CIA operative who worked in the middle east and speaks Arabic, he shows quite a lack of understanding of the totalitarian nature of the religion from which the whole cult has emanated. This becomes very clear when he ends his documentary with an interview with Tariq Ramadan. Who he thinks is against Islamic terrorism. He doesn't seem to know that the man is an Islamist who is the grandson of the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood. The Brotherhood is one of the most extremist Muslim organization and founder of both Hamas and Al-Qaeda. But Baer seems to go with Tariq his apology that makes Muslims victims of the suicide cult. To top it of Robert Baer concludes his documentary with the statement that from now on every individual with a grievance can use the suicide bombers weapon. As if Islam is not a necessary ingredient for the cult to work.

But then again, the documentary started with Robert Baer telling he was a CIA operative in Lebanon who did not see the attack coming on the embassy he was working. One wonders, how much has he learned from this experience?",1184025600,5,1897,5.1558441558441555
2564416,2,B000FG8BO6,"I have mixed feelings about this documentary. Although Robert Baer allows Iranians and Palestinians to speak their minds, he presents it in a way that makes them look evil. The Iranians are a special group of people. They are all Shiite Muslims and they are about 15% of the billion plus Muslims. I hate to say this, but they are brainwashed and although the Prophet wanted the Muslims to be brave, Im sure he would disapprove of them being fanatical. He walked the Middle Path and his life was balanced.

He talks about the Iranian revolution in 1979. He should have mentioned Operation Ajax where U.S. agents,  most likely CIA agents like Robert, executed a covert operation that removed from power the elected  Iranian Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh in order to put in power the Shah who was a dictator that used his secret police force SAVAK to torture people.  It is probable that if this interference did not happen, there never would have been an Islamic Revolution and the extremism that exists today. If you think this is information that viewers do not need to know, then you are part of a propaganda campaign. Either we have the whole truth or we have no truth at all.

Now lets talk about suicide bombing. I think it would be relevant to mention the first bombing in the Middle East period. Manachem Begin and his group the Irgun, launched an all-out armed rebellion, perpetrating hundreds of attacks against British installations and posts and the first one was the bombing of British headquarters at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, killing 91 innocent people, including Arab and Jewish civilians. So if you want to know who taught Palestinians to use bombs in the first place, look no further than the Israelis themselves.

I was surprised when he mentions a Syrian group that is secular and still uses suicide bombing. I still do not think this proves the point that suicide bombing has absolutely nothing to do with Islam. If you haven't read the book Dying to Win, then you probably do not know that the people who are the leaders in suicide bombing are the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka. Robert mentions them for about 2 seconds during the end of his movie. Their last suicide bombing was in Jan 06 2007 which killed 16 civilians. The 200 bombings in the Gaza Strip in 11 years that Robert talks about is a complete lie. Since 1993, there have been exactly 70 bombings by Hamas and you can Google this if you don't believe me. The Tamil Tigers or LTTE have executed almost three times more bombings than Hamas. The reason they are not mentioned is because they are Hindus and not Muslims. He wants Americans to hate 1)Muslims 2)Palestinians and 3)Iranians.

Suicide bombing is not a cult, it is the measures used by desperate people. If the Palestinians had tanks and F-16's, they would use them instead to do make the Israelis leave their land and it is their land according to international law. The Iraqis never used suicide bombngs until the US invaded them in 2003. Nor were suicide bomings used in Afghanistan until US Soldiers set fire to the bodies of two Taliban. It is a cycle of violence that starts with one nation occupying another. The bombings on 9-11 and London are the fruits of what the U.S. has sowed with its foriegn policies. A person does not decide to blow him or herself up because it's the hip thing to do. They do it because they believe that oppression is taking place and that sacrficing their lives is one step closer to ending that oppression.

If you seriously want to know why a person becomes a suicide bomber, you should visit Israel and see how the Palestinians live. There have been a few documentaries like Death in Gaza, but you can never really understand how bad the situation is until you have seen it with your own eyes. I suggest you take a bullet proof vest with you in case an Israeli soldier mistakenly thinks you are a terrorist.",1180569600,4,3896,4.62807525325615
2564417,5,B000FG8BO6,"Robert Baer takes you to places inside this documentary that you cannot believe he was able to go himself.  When you are finished watching The Cult of the Suicide Bomber, you have a real insight into what we are facing regarding the threat from Iran.  I use it in my Homeland Security classes at Regis University and it always gets positive ratings.

2564418,5,B000FG8BO6,"Robert Baer's ""The Cult of the Suicide Bomber"" is by far the best documentary I have seen on the topic.  Well researched and well presented, the documentary kept me interested for the duration, even though it is longer than an average History Channel documentary by far.  Robert Baer went all out, and utilized his extensive experience with the CIA, as well as fantastic interviews with some of the world's worst terrorist extremists and would-be suicide bombers.

Watching the documentary, one almost thinks that Baer is on the side of the fundametalists, in his approach to better understand the acts of violence caused by various jihads over the years.  In this Baer exhibits an extraordinary talent that every journalist needs - ability to penetrate the circles of the subject researched.  I admire Baer for all the information he presented and all the fascinating interviews that I didn't think were possible.  The viewer is reminded of Baer's stand on suicide bombings as he consistently refers to these attacks for what they are - suicides, even after being corrected by the fundamentalists interviewed that these terrorists did not commit suicides, but entered martyrdom instead.

A fascinating journey through the Islamic fundamentalism, bringing some valid grievances to the forefront, grievances that are normally not presented by the western media.  Baer's documentary is truly one of a kind, a film that anyone can learn something from, and that everyone should watch.",1177804800,5,1481,5.245762711864407
2564419,5,B000FG8BO6,"movie drags on a bit, and you get a little tired of hearing robert baer (one of my heros) say martyr, but otherwise an EXCELLENT, unbiased look into the minds of radical islam. I wish every american was shown this video in high school so they would wake the hell up. Im waiting for the hidden cameras inside the uk mosques to come out on dvd.",1169596800,2,342,4.196969696969697
2564420,4,B000FG8BO6,"As a researcher interested in terrorism and political violence, I watched this movie to gain a different perspective on the origins of suicide bombing.  The documentary has some amazing interviews of both bombers/martyrs and counterinsurgents.  How the filmmakers were able to get these people to speak on tape is incredible. This alone made the film worth watching.  The movie is chock full of history and facts about how suicide bombing has evolved since its intial use in Iran.

My only complaint relates to the notion that suicide bombing is a ""cult"" that lacks ideology and is spreading.  What the filmmakers learn through their interviews is that the bombings are a tactic used by weak actors to impose costs on the stronger opponent.  Robert Pape's book ""Dying to Win"" makes this point.  In addition, Mia Bloom's book, ""Dying to Kill"" provides an even deeper description of the process involved.  I encourage anyone interested in understanding why the tactic of suicide bombing has been replicated in recent conflicts to read these two books.  Paradise Now, a drama about a potential suicide bomber, is also worth watching.  If the goal is to understand the process so that this tactic of resistance can be countered/eliminated, consulting all of these sources will help you put together a better explanation for why suicide bombing is on the rise.",1169164800,18,1355,5.063063063063063
2564421,5,B000FG8BO6,"Excellent approach to a relevant topic coming out of the middle east. As a westerner the topic of suicide bombings is vague and often viewed as a method of religious extremism. Baer quietly diassects the reasonings behind the suicide missions and what makes them so effective. It's a historical look back at the beginnings all the way to the London attacks of 2005. Effective, chilling, and diabolical reasoning stand behind them. From the perspective of the bombers, its completely rational and logical. Well documented and well presented without speaking down to the audience who just may be learning about suicide bombers. Its as if the viewer is to take over a case load from Mr. Baer.",1162684800,6,689,4.948275862068965
2564422,5,B000FG8BO6,"Hosted by former CIA agent Robert BAER (according to the sleeve of the DVD box George CLOONEY`s character in the SYRIANA movie is based upon him)the feature-length documentary THE CULT OF THE SUICIDE BOMBER provides viewers with an in-depth look at the horrifying phenomenon known in the West as ""suicide bomber"".

After a brief introduction concerning the July 2005 suicide attacks on London subway trains and a bus, which claimed over 50 deaths and hundreds of injured, BAER visits Iran. The concept of matyrdom, which is derived from the Shiite form of Islam is explained. The commander of the Iranian armed forces is interviewed and he states that, ""they ( = the Americans) know that no army can stand in the way of martyrdom, so the Americans should know if they try to interfere with Iran they will dig their own graves"". BAER details the story of the first known suicide bomber, 13 year old Hossein FAHMIDEH, who in 1980 in the battle of Kerbala during the Iran/Iraq war took explosives and threw himself in front of an advancing Iraqi tank. The explosion destroyed the tank and FAHMIDEH`s comrades, impressed by his act of self-sacrifice, were able to halt the Iraqi attack. (In my view the film makers fail to point out that this anti-tank tactic was also widely used by the Japanese in the later stages of the war in the pacific.) As is shown in the documentary, FAHMIDEH is celebrated as an Iranian hero to this very day.

Following the Israeli intervention in Lebanon in 1982, the concept of suicide bombing was introduced in that country by the Shiite Hezbollah resistance movement. On 11th November 1982 Ahmad QUASSIR drove a car, filled with explosives into the Israeli army HQ at Tyr - 74 Israeli soldiers died in the blast. QUASSIR became the first suicide car bomber. Many were to follow him.

As the documentary points out suicide bombing was considered a military tactic by Hezbollah at the time. It also shown that this tactic was also used by non-Islamic groups like the Lebanese pro-Syrian SSNP (Syrian Socialist National Party). Being a secular organisation there were also no objections against female suicide bombers. There is an interesting interview with the commanding officer of two female suicide bombers in the documentary. We get to see the last video message of 26 year old Norma Abi HASSAN (nicknamed ""Hurricane Norma""), an attractive young woman, who does not appear to be coerced or brainwashed into the operation. Shortly after the video was shot, she drove a pick up truck filled with explosives into an Israeli army convoy, killing 10 soldiers in the process. It was in Lebanon, where the practice of the suicide bomber's last video messages and the filming of the attacks itself originated. These videos are then used for propagandistic purposes and often disseminated over the internet.

You also get to see in the documentary the horrible attacks on the US embassy and the US Marine barracks in Beirut. As BAER comments, almost all of the Beirut CIA staff was wiped out and he only survived because he was out of town at the time.

As is shown in the documentary, the suicide tactic proved to be successful. In excess of 350 Israeli soldiers died. BAER: ""Southern Lebanon had become Israel's vietnam"", and by 2000 Israel withdrew her forces.

In the Palestinian people's fight against Israeli occupation suicide bombing turned from a weapon of war into a weapon of terror. Starting in 1994 until now there were over 200 suicide attacks. It has to be said in the documentary`s favour, that, while it of course does NOT condone or even glorify suicide bombers, it does not demonize them either. In my view it is clearly shown who started this never ending cycle of violence. It should not be forgotten that the first suicide bombing in Israel was a reprisal for the murder of 29 Palestinians in a mosque (!) at the hand of militant Jewish settler Baruch GOLDSTEIN. There is a very moving interview with one of the few remaining Palestinian shop owners in Hebron, who says that the Jewish settlers who live in the apartments above his shop are in the habit of throwing rocks and pouring down boiling water (!) I mean, how can one live like that?

The documentary also details the hunt for Yahya AYYASH, a suicide bomber mastermind, who orchestrated a dozen or so attacks. Israeli intelligence Shin Beth only managed to kill him when a Palestinian traitor put an explosive device in his cell phone. Detonating, it decapitated AYYASH.

The docmentary concludes on the sombre note that suicide bombing is here to stay and has not lost his allure.

Filled with insightful interviews with surviving perpetrators and victims and their families, islamic scholars, intelligence personel and eyewitnesses, horrifying videos of suicide bombings and their aftermath and informative commentary THE CULT OF THE SUICIDE BOMBER is an outstanding and fairly balanced documentary. Hugely recommended - my only problem with the DVD is the complete lack of any extra features.",1157932800,10,4997,4.911137440758294
2564423,5,B000FG8BO6,"If you want a basic, no-frills explanation of why the maniacs are doing what they do, and how it has spread from Iran to Lebanon to now British citizens who are blowing themselves up; watch this film.

It's a bit dry, but Baer more than compensates for this by layering the story and following the trail of the terrorist. He uses a lot of never before seen interviews and actual bomb footage from Hezbollah TV. (who knew Hezbollah HAD it's own station!)

Baer has kahones of steel to go to some of the places he does, with a camera crew no less. There is one scene in Iran where he is the lone western face in a Mosque full of wackos chanting ""Death to America."" Whew.

I was especially pleased to see a balanced presentation that didn't blame the West. I'm not aware of anyone chanting ""Death to Iran"" in our local churches, let alone blowing themselves up.",1155600000,3,858,4.417721518987341

8122034,4,B000FG8BO6,"The film makes some thought provoking moral distinctions between
suicide bombing as a weapon of war for those without access to high
tech weaponry (e.g. would it really be so different if a fighter
dropped a bomb on the military convoy from a plane instead of attached
to his chest?) and as a weapon of terror used against civilians.

It also does not deny that some who have used it as a weapon have done
so after suffering heavy losses from others, instead of simply reducing
them to crazy people acting in an irrational vacuum.

It traces the roots of martyrdom in Islam back 1400 years, and explains
how that history was twisted by the leaders in Iran to justify suicide
bombings in spite of strict Islamic laws against suicide.

Yet, in spite of the intensity and complexity of the subject, the
dramatic, sometimes upsettingly graphic footage, and the somewhat over
the top music, it starts to get a little repetitive and flat.

And it curiously ignores other historical suicide bombings, like the
Japanese Kamikaze WWII pilots, declaring that suicide bombing was
""invented"" by Iran in the war with Iraq.",1321056000,,1109,4.821052631578947

8122038,2,B000FG8BO6,"If you have been watching broadcast news over the years, there is little that you wouldn't have seen in a equivalent form (other than dramatic pictures of the Bek'aa Valley of Lebanon).  If you are new to this, there are numerous valuable segments, but the ordering is driven by chronology rather than an attempt to build understanding.  For example, the segment with the interviews with the imprisoned Palestinian bombers (chapter 16) is the first real attempt at explaining the bombers mindset, and should have come much earlier.

The documentary focuses more on an enumeration of the bombers and their attacks, and generally gives too little of the context needed for understanding events.

Many of the interviews are unrevealing - they seem to be the long established ""party line"" of the interviewee.  Getting spontaneity or insights is difficult, but having time to do so is one of the aspects that distinguishes documentaries from news reports.

TECHNICAL: Baer's narration is very flat: he speaks very slowly and carefully.  There are too many transition shots of Baer walking or listening (This is routine and acceptable in news broadcasts because they don't have the time to get interesting visuals).  The pictures of martyrs and explosions are so many and so dominant that they became tiring, and many seem to be little more than unimaginative visual filler.

INTELLECTUAL MESS:  Misleading labeling is an effective tactic in advocacy, but a major impediment to understanding: You fail to ask important questions and block linkages that would lead to insights.

The use of the term ""suicide"" is derogatory and highly misleading (a point one interviewee makes): It implies that one's own death is the primary motivator for the act.  The bombers and those around them use the word ""martyr"" exclusively, and it better describes their mindset and motivations displayed.

In US mass culture, the term ""cult"" is derogatory, most commonly used for a group with extreme beliefs or mass adoration of an undeserving someone or something.  However, what is presented seems to be the standard honoring of war heroes and the attendant PR for the war effort (from the perspective of the bombers' causes).

The association of ""suicide bombing"" with Islam is clearly nonsense - the modern version is credited to the Tamil Tigers (Sri Lanka).

Crediting the ""first suicide bomber"" to the Iran-Iraq war is also nonsense.  That type of act is routinely found throughout the history of warfare and is celebrated in its mythology/PR.  For example, in the John Wayne movie ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fighting-Seabees/dp/0782011284/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fighting Seabees</a>"", the Wayne character becomes a suicide bomber to blunt a Japanese attack (and thereby redeems himself for earlier transgressions).  The movie ends with the other characters at what is effectively a celebration of the martyr.

The Kamikaze pilots (WW2) provide so many useful parallels - both in their operation and their effect on the war--that it is incredible that they aren't mentioned.

Baer states that first suicide bombing by Palestinians was revenge for a massacre of worshippers at a Hebron mosque by an Israeli settler, but goes on to refer to the Israelis killed (in retaliation) as ""the first victims.""  This dismissiveness of what motivated the bombers riddles this documentary. (Note: This is simply my judgment that the documentary should provide such a perspective and not a comment on the legitimacy of arguments and claims of the various parties.  However, I expect to be attacked by those who believe that if you aren't 1000% in support of them, you are supporting their enemy).

A brief summary of the state of the Iran-Iraq war would seem to be critical to understanding ""the first suicide bombing"" but was not provided.  Similarly, the first bombing in Lebanon is presented devoid of any context.

MISSED OPPORTUNITIES:
The Imam at noon prayers at Tehran University (Chapter 2) attacks ""the White House"" repeatedly (not America).  When the crowd starts chanting ""Death to America,"" it seemed that about a third were participating, and much of that was lackadaisical and mechanical.  Both seemed worthy of a brief follow-up, even though they would have been digressions.

When the family of a bomber talked about motivation, they referred to Israeli terrorism against Palestinians.  Some follow-up seemed to be warranted, to indicate how much of this was experience versus a rationale/general polemic.",1218844800,12,4542,5.338483146067416
