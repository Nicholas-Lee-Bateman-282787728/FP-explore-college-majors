8381727,2,B002V3AM2A,"Contains minor plot spoilers, but hey this is a slasher so you know a bunch of people die gruesomely.

Two Mustang Cheerleaders on their way to a meet in Minneapolis, pick up some stranded boys outside of Stockholm, Sweden (at least cover the plates). Tara (Yohanna Idha)  has done it once and is destined for slutdom. They end up getting abducted by a gang of one-eyed Swedish homosexuals (?) who seem to prefer pretty boy Oliver (Max Wallmo) over the girls in this gore-fest which in many ways seems to be a spoof of this type of film.

They screwed up the formula, as the final girl should be the virgin. They had a chainsaw, but it ran out of fuel. The initial woman in the teaser scene looked slightly pregnant, suggesting the girls would be ""breeders"" but that never came full circle, as if Oliver had a womb. The white lab rat running around the old barn wasn't convincing either. The Swedes have done better.

Guide: F-word. Sodomy rape. No nudity.",1469664000,,956,4.540697674418604

8381729,2,B002V3AM2A,"This was your random slasher B list movie. I believe this was a Swedish movie, but it supposedly took place in America, where 2 teens were headed to a Cheerleading competition, met two other dudes who had a broken down car, that hitched a ride with the cheerleaders until that car broke down, and yer classic murdering hillbillies with too much land come pick `em up, and Madness ensues.. I think a problem was the random mix of Euro and American license plates. Anyway, they all had Swedish accents though they were supposed to be American. They were all supposed to be teenagers but appeared to be like 29 or 30. So, I'd skip this one.. and yell at someone Swedish for making this one.  I wouldn't consider this a 'gay bondage movie' as there was one scene of a male being victimized by the hillbillies that lasted less than 5 minutes, i think it was 5 minutes too much for certain other reviewers who may not be so comfortable with their own.. movie watching experience.",1317600000,,973,4.528409090909091
8381730,3,B002V3AM2A,"""Madness"" is another one of those ""inbred hillbillies preying on innocent teens"" flicks which have been popping up all over the place within the past decade.  This time they're in Sweden, masquerading as Minnesota!  The movie is in English so all the ""Americans"" speak with thick Swedish accents, which is quite hilarious.  Strangely, though, the hillbillies speak in a foreign language throughout(Swedish, I'm guessing.  I'm no linguistics expert).
  As you'd probably guess, ""Madness"" is a mess.  There is no reason given why the hillbillies are picking on the teens in the film who consist of 2 cheerleaders & 2 guys whose car has broken down.  The teens are chased, captured, get tortured, escape, and all the other fun things you would expect.  Most of the action is done on a handheld camera while running through the woods, so if you're prone to motion sickness I'd avoid this one.
  In spite of all its flaws, I really liked this film.  It made no sense(especially the ""6 months later"" bit at the end), but it was entertaining just for that reason.  It's obvious the film makers were trying to imitate the films they like and failing, but they probably had fun in the process.  If you like movies that are good for all the wrong reasons, give ""Madness"" a shot.",1271980800,4,1268,4.756880733944954
8381731,1,B002V3AM2A,"Yet ANOTHER male bondage movie masquerading as a horror movie. There seem to be a lot of these popping up lately. If that's your cup of tea then fine, but its misleading to advertise this as a 'cheerleaders in peril' horror movie with photos on the cover featuring models (and scenes) that are not in the movie! The so-called 'cheerleaders' in this movie are two girls who are in the movie for less than a quarter of its running time! It's mostly just guys getting tied up and tortured, butt raped, repeatedly beaten, disfigured, licked on the face by rednecks etc. The so-called 'cheerleaders' (who don't even show their legs - they are wearing black spandex pants and leg warmers under their uniforms) are only here in token form so that they can rip-off the main horror movie crowd and cheerleader fans. This is deceptive marketing at its worst.",1266796800,8,848,4.697986577181208
