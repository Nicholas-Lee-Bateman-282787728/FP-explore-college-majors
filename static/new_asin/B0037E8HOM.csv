8390470,5,B0037E8HOM,"Shot on location in Egypt, this film is a detailed and fascinating look at the miracles associated with visible manifestations of the other world into our own reality.  Beginning with the Marian apparitions in Zeitoun, Egypt in 1968 which have been witnessed by hundreds of thousands of witnesses including Egypt's own former President and counts of other Muslims and Christians from all walks of life.. to the phenomenon of lights over a church and a story of a woman cured of terminal cancer after a miracle from the Virgin Mary performed the surgery, the woman's hand dripped with oil for many months which was clear and aromatic.

I was born in Egypt and lived there nearly half my life, yet besides the famous Virgin Mary apparitions of the late 1960's, I had not heard of many of these events.

Quality interviews and narration and a lot of video and still frame photography is shown in this film.

Well worth it and very encouraging.",1328313600,,940,4.748466257668712
