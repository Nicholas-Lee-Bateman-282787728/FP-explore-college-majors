8544384,5,B009UHH0VG,"The film title was available for a time from a national company that provides
both DVD and streaming films.  The farmer's daughter has been a subject of
blue jokes for years so this film joins in with a mother and daughter giving  viewers
an eyefull of two naked women doing  what naked women do best.  The dialogue is
corny but dialogue isn't the purpose of the story.  No longer able to see this film via
streaming, I purchased a DVD player  that uses the European PAL system and the
player and DVD cost around eighty dollars.  It was money well spent.",1356912000,,554,4.425742574257426
