996633,4,630524068X,"I bought this movie for my daughter because it was on her Christmas list.  She is an interpreter and enjoyed the movie very much but was surprised that it was in German and the signing was in German,  of course she could follow the English subtitles,  I think there should be reference to it being in German in the Amazon ad/description.",1328486400,,337,4.491803278688525
996634,5,630524068X,"one of the best movies ever! So touching! This movie is the reason why I started to play the clarinet.
To bad, that there isn't a real synchronization for this wonderful movie.",1325548800,,176,4.53125
996635,5,630524068X,"I truly appreciated this film, for giving us a peek inside the deaf world. Laura, as a hearing daughter of deaf parents, she is expected to interpret everyday situations for them. Her parents demand more of her than the average child. When her aunt gives her a clarinet, she finds an unexpected struggle with her father and her desire to play music. This film is also about Laura trying to balance her role in the deaf world and the hearing world and questioning which world she belongs to.

I loved watching the beautiful and graceful German Sign Language and comparing GSL to ASL. I also loved listening to the clarinet; I had no idea how beautiful that instrument sounds! There are several aspects of this film that I absolutely loved, such as, when the two parents were lying in bed and having a conversation without looking at each other and Laura's responses when her father would ask her to describe a sound",1319328000,,914,4.6419753086419755
996636,5,630524068X,"This is a great movie which adresses the difficulties a hearing child may experience with two Deaf parents.  It is heart warming and serious.  I would recommend this movie to any one over the age of 13, as there is a ""serious make-out"" scene, but no nudity.
Brilliant movie, that moves me to tears everytime I see it.",1271980800,,317,4.448275862068965
996637,4,630524068X,"I enjoyed the film when I saw it in German. That was years ago, so it is with some hesitancy that I write the following: I think some scenes (such as one where the female lead places an insect on her lover's chest) were cut from the film for US release. I cannot be sure because I do not have a German release with which to compare the films. If anyone can say more, please say so in comments to this review--especially if I'm remembering a different film!",1266710400,3,456,4.193181818181818
996638,5,630524068X,"I love the movie. I thought it was well written, easy to understand and easy to write a report about. The actress and actor performed well. I learned alot about the subject, the reason I bought the movie.

If some one want to know about a hearing child with deaf parents, this should be their first choice for information. I was impressed with the contents of the movie and in the order in which it was shown.

Great movie,even if I didn't have to write a report on that subject, I still would have enjoyed the movie.",1260489600,,517,4.319587628865979

996770,4,630524068X,"Lara cares for her deaf parents but is pulled out of their orbit by her passion for music and her attraction to her aunt, who fosters her passion for the clarinet.  Her pursuit of a music conservatory slot and that growing bond with her aunt estranges her from her family.

Her mother's sudden and accidental death forces her to confront some harsh feelings about her father, who resents the primacy of music in his daughter's life.

This largely melancholy film offers a redemptive ending as Lara auditions for a coveted slot in the Berlin music conservatory while her father appears unannounced to offer his wordless support.  Love and passion transcend silence and bridges the gap between parallel worlds and family fissures.",1198022400,,728,4.991735537190083
996771,5,630524068X,"Caroline Link was the sensitive director of this engaging movie, a very warmth portrait about a girl of deaf parents, who discovers her love and gift for music.

So, surrounded by worlds of sounds and silence, she tries to find the perfect balance between both islands.

A film of huge and resplendent beauty that must be seen over and over to discover the miracle of the music and the anguish of an endless silence.

Nominated for Best foreign picture in 1998 and winner as Best picture in Tokyo International Film Festival, this is undeniably one of my top twenty films of this decade.",1190592000,,587,4.679611650485437
996772,5,630524068X,"Anyone who grows up as a ""caretaker"" for their parents generally matures very rapidly. The child enters adulthood very quickly and has a very overdeveloped sense of responsibility. The downside of caretaking at a young age is that the child has no time to discover who they are and what they want out of life. They are the parent who cares and nurtures instead of being the child who should be builded up, edified and protected.

Such is the charming but wrenchingly melancholy story of BEYOND THE SILENCE, Academy Award Nominee for Best Foreign Language Film of 1997. Lara is a precocious ""hearing"" child born to two deaf parents. Lara has becomes the ears to the outside world for her parents who wish to keep her  totally for themselves in their world of quiet. But Lara suffers in the world outside her home. She cannot be what she needs to be. Her reading suffers and she longs to find the expression that is beyond words and beyond the silence. The key to her breakout comes when her Aunt Clarissa gives Lara a clarinet. Lara's parents are threatened that they will lose Lara to a world that they have not been able (and perhaps willing!) to enter. Alot has to be said for the family dynamics presented in this film.

Anyone who has been misunderstood or held down by their parents whims or misunderstandings will benefit greatly from viewing this subtle and well-told story of  a close-knit family that has to learn to understand each other's world. It is an amazing piece of drama sprinkled with bits of honesty and humor that propels this evenly paced film along the thin line of hope and frustration.

The film is in German with very readable subtitles.

An excellent companion film would be MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS (USA).",1181260800,,1727,4.683168316831683
996773,4,630524068X,"Once again, we have what should have been a wonderful movie diminished by a totally unnecessary sex scene.  Also, there was no point (related to the story) for Aunt Clarissa, after her husband moved out, to have a new man in her house in the next scene.  Other than those incidents, it is a fine move.  The 9-year-old Laura is a real sparkler.

We knew a couple of sisters who were friends of our daughters whose parents were deaf, and we found little Laura to be very much like those girls.  It is a great movie to show children how the lives of some of their friends can be very much different from their own.  Then, to teach them that, unlike some of the kids in the movie who were mean to Laura, if we understand the friend's life from his or her point of view we can and should be nice to them.  This movie gives a real feel for the experiences and unique frustrations of a hearing child of deaf parents.

The movie is pretty much the usual child finally wins the approval of a disapproving parent story.  Therefore, the main value of the film is that this child has very different obstacles to overcome that can help kids understand and accept ""odd"" classmates.  I'd give it an 5-Stars on that basis if it wasn't for the unnecessarily thrown in scenes that go contrary to traditional values.",1145750400,7,1297,4.389121338912134
996774,5,630524068X,"Although this is a German film (the settings are Bavaria and Berlin, I believe) with subtitles, don't let the subtitles (if you don't like subtitled films) lead you to miss a really terrific film.

The story involves a hearing child (Lara) growing up with two deaf parents, who must be their translator to the hearing world.  She probably matures faster, but it creates an odd  relationship with her parents, since they are reliant on her.

Her father Martin doesn't get along with his sister Clarissa, so when Clarissa gives Lara her old clarinet, Martin is less than thrilled.  Clarissa's clarinet playing was a problem when they were children, and he doesn't have happy memories of that clarinet.  The world of music is something Martin and his wife Kai can only struggle to understand.  Fortunately or unfortunately, Lara is very talented and loves playing the clarinet.  The story follows Lara's life from when she is 9 or 10 to when she is 18 and going out on her own.

Ironically, there's some beautiful music in this film (I loved the piece that Lara plays on the clarinet at the end of the film).  I could certainly appreciate the beauty of the sign language that Lara's parents use to communicate, but I also thought it was very sad that they couldn't hear her play, and that the loss of the ability to listen to music is a great loss indeed.",1136246400,4,1352,4.642857142857143
996775,5,630524068X,"This is exquisite and delightful film of a hearing daughter of deaf parents whose father hasn't fully matured in his deafness nor reconciled with previous family issues, nor has daughter fully matured in understanding the deaf as well as family who hasn't fully matured in the integration of hearing world with the deaf world.
Catalyst of this daughter whose musical gift on clarinet causes reaction of brother-sister and daughter-father as she matures into a young adult musician.
Even with the English subcaptions this movie is a grabber and romancer.  It is very well done from its cinematography to its soundtrack.  The acting is excellent.  I think the father resembles closely a Boris Becker add a few extra pounds.
This film dramatizes the Deaf and hearing worlds in an entertaining and provocative way that touches deep.",1083542400,8,828,5.118518518518519
996776,5,630524068X,"This was an absolutely beautiful movie.  It tells the story of Lara, a child with normal hearing who has two deaf parents.  Although her parents can function without Lara, her parents have come to depend on her as a link to the 'hearing' world, even though she is very, very young.
Needless to say, the deafness of her parents has created interesting personality dynamics in Lara's world.  One of the most strained relationships is between Lara's father and his sister Clarissa.  When Clarissa introduces Lara to the clarinet, this is something that Lara latches on to, even though her parents can't comprehend the music she's playing.  Because of this, and because it is Clarissa who wants her to keep at it, her parents are less than overjoyed.  The film revolves around Lara growing up and excelling at playing the clarinet, and the decisions she has to make if she wants to pursue her music at a higher level.  None of the characters are transparent or superficial; one gets the idea of their thoughts and their reasonings by the way they act and interact with one another.
The DVD is in German, with options for English subtitles or English for the hearing impared (It would be sad if they didn't; after all, this is a film about deaf people.)  The only other ""extra"" is basically an advertisement for ""other films you might like"".  However, this shouldn't deter one from enjoying this absolutely exquisite film.",1054166400,53,1417,4.79835390946502
996777,5,630524068X,"If I had any musical talent, this film could easily be my life. The story is about a young hearing girl, Lara, growing up with two deaf parents. Lara often uses her parent's disability to her advantage, sometimes not relaying all the information in a conversation when she is asked to interpret, or outright lying in these scenarios. Her aunt, Dad's sister, presents her with a clarinet and develops a tight bond with Lara. Their relationship is very different than that of Lara and her parents simply due to the communication factor. Lara wishes her aunt was her mother.
The conflict in the film arises from the issues Lara's father has with her love for music. He is tormented by family memories of his sister being adored for her musical talent, while he is hauled off to the other room to be locked up like an animal.
This is an amazing film. As a hearing child of deaf parents, it comes closest to my own experiences and frustrations with deaf and hearing culture internal and external to the family unit. It is easily in my top-five films of all time.",1046217600,25,1057,4.568421052631579
996778,4,630524068X,"Although I only saw the movie once, I watched the introduction over and over and over again because the soundtrack is so beautiful. That first song in the movie (Ice Dance) makes it worth renting. The whole entirety of the movie itself is very well done, but that first scene is absolutely beautiful, and for that reason, I would recommend this movie to anyone with a love for classical music, especially piano.",1011312000,,411,4.722222222222222
996867,4,630524068X,"""Beyond Silence"" is one of the best films I have seen in years!  It is the story of a young girl, the daughter of deaf parents, who is looking for her place in the world.  A common plot for movies -- but this film does not go for hollow sentimentality or cliches.  The characters are complex, and the plot has some surprising twists.  There are no villains, no overly dramatic emotional scenes; everything is realistically portrayed.  The ending is satisfying, and like life, not all questions are answered.  American film could learn a lot from this, especially in terms of eliciting real emotional responses from an audience.",979689600,10,627,4.813084112149533
996868,5,630524068X,"I am studying the german language and its wonderful when I find a movie in german, that was so good!  Yeah, most german movies i have seen so far are mostly for the comedy aspect in the way their characters interact, i find  that along with the drama that occured w/ the main character, this is a  very inspring film!  The main character grew up before your eyes, amazing  you how she delt with her every-day situations, translating for her parents  stuff on the television and what her peers and teachers what they wanted to  say to her parents.  Of course, being a little girl, the humor is when she  doesn't quite translate it word for word.  This movie has inspired me to be  more serious to my language study.  I might want to even to expand to ASL.  All that I know is that this movie was good, and is viewable by everyone.  There is no bad scenes only inspiring ones! This which leads to my second  question, why isn't this movie avalible on DVD yet?  This movie, if they  did a little more advertising, would be a summer DVD sale hit!  Trust my  word on it.  Hey, um DVD companies, please put this on dvd  sooooooon!

996869,5,630524068X,"An amazing film. It's not a funny film and the lesson is not""If you've got a gift use it"" but something much deeper thanthat. Little Lara with her great play with her parents, translating their sign language, managing with them everyday, especially with her father's relations with her hearing aunt (his sister), who tries to influence her, who pushes her into the world of music, clarinet that she plays Jewish happy music (kleizmer), a world her parents can not understand, but learn to accept.",955152000,3,496,4.916666666666667
996870,1,630524068X,"I really mean it, but the characters in this film were too dark and foreboding.  This film is really depressing and the characters really let their emotions flare up.

996871,5,630524068X,"This movie really touched me, as it shows the struggles a young girl must endure with growing up with 2 deaf parents. You watch as her independence  allows her to grow from her family. The viewer can experience the love that  surrounds and keeps them together.",925603200,3,260,4.630434782608695
996872,4,630524068X,This is almost the perfect family film.  The mild premarital sexual content is not appropriate and takes away from an otherwise excellent film.  What a great storyline! The interaction between the hearing and deaf  worlds was very interesting. You will enjoy the characters and their  stories.,924825600,,293,5.304347826086956
996873,5,630524068X,"Lara's answer to her deaf father's anxious query: ""Have I lost you?"" is ""I've loved you since the day I was born"". The innocence and power of that simple answer brought tears to my eyes. This  wonderful movie takes the viewer on a noncynical, nonneurotic journey of  family love challenged, and at the same time deeply enriched by disability.  Beyond Silence reminds us that our families both shelter and constrain, and  that we must dream and love and work our way into new relationships that  will shelter and support us without trapping us. I loved the lyrical weave  of words translated into sign language. Watching Beyond Silence reminded me  of seeing beautiful ensemble dancers accompanied by the haunting notes of  an instrument rarely seen in movies--the clarinet. The innocent,  captivating beauty of the young Lara captured my imagination as well as my  heart. I loved this movie and cannot wait to share it with everyone I know.  It is a movie that celebrates the human heart and spirit. Worth Five stars  and more. In the same league as What's Eating Gilbert Grape? and Dominick  and Eugene. Worth its weight in gold.",920073600,14,1130,4.853403141361256
7886017,3,630524068X,"Good story line and the English subtitles were fine and did not distract from the movie.  The movie, however, had a lot of dark lighting in various scenes that should have been given more or better camera lighting.",1501459200,,214,4.631578947368421

7886023,5,630524068X,"The story is heartwarming and inspiring. It is the portrayal of a family in which the parents are deaf and do not speak but the children have no impairment. What I love about the film is its depiction of the family dynamics in a context where communication is different but the emotional story is essentially that of us all. It is tender and sometime humorous and sometimes heartbreaking.

Anyone considering it should be aware that it is in German with English subtitles. Though I am not especially fond of subtitles while trying to follow a movie, in ""Beyond Silence"" I found them to be relatively simple and unobtrusive.",1401580800,,623,4.768518518518518

7886025,4,630524068X,"I like this movie a lot.  I saw it more than ten years ago, and then after re-watching it recently, I was pleased to be reminded how entertaining and beautiful it was.  My favorite part is the first hour.  Tatjana Trieb as the young Lara is magnificent.  The way she describes sounds to her deaf parents, interprets on their behalf; her chemistry with the other actors and fit in the family are so natural, so perfect.  She has charisma galore, and it is a shame she isn't in more films.  She is one of the best child actors I've ever seen.  Story of Lara, who plays the clarinet, which serves to separate her from her father, who is deaf.  Her father, Martin, is afraid of losing her.  Martin feels like an outsider from his hearing family, does not understand how his whole family caters to him, and he is especially jealous of his sister, Clarissa, who plays the clarinet.  Clarissa is very unhappy, does not love her husband, seems to covet what her brother Martin has and feels marginalized by her family.  There is the lovely Kai, played by Emmanuelle Laborit, who is Lara's mother, who is friendly and matter-of-fact about her deafness, encouraging her daughter to succeed, going so far as to laugh at her younger daughter, Marie friend's screams to prove her deafness, and encouraging Lara to play the clarinet, even buying her concert tickets to understand.  I empathized with Martin's frustration and fear; Clarissa's own unhappiness, Clarissa's husband's sadness, but I really disliked the older Lara.  My first complaint of the film was Sylvie Testud; she just didn't seem to fit, and perhaps if Tatjana Trieb wasn't so superb as the young Lara, I wouldn't have a complaint, but Sylvie Testud was so drab.  I also disliked the melodramatic exchange between Lara and her father at the end.  But the first hour is marvelous, really stellar.",1371340800,,1850,4.755485893416928
