7874112,3,6304542364,"There are three areas which we must consider: the performance, the production, the tape. The last is far too amateurish. The camera is glued to one spot and gives closeups or pans instead of interesting angles; while  the color is smeary and the image blurry. (I was able to adjust my color  levels and sharpness enough to make it tolerable.) The production is  four-square small opera house variety with chorus taking on-the-chalkmark  positions and only some of them looking concerned with the proceedings. The  sets are minimal and there are wrinkles in the snowy mountains behind the  apparently wall-less Miller house. It is the quality of the singing (the  acting is on a level with the scenery)that makes this tape worth hearing  (as opposed to seeing and hearng). The vocalizing might not be subtle but  it is strong, well projected, and in character (which in this opera is not  much). The long ovation Bergonzi gets after his big aria leaves him no  choice but to drop his role to accept the accolade; but opera stars can be  forgiven this non-resistance of temptation. This was never one of my  favorite Verdi works, but I am grateful for a chance to see how it works on  stage. However I would want to see a more professional production some day  on a better taping.",935280000,,1278,4.719457013574661
