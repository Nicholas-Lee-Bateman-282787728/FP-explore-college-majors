8107907,5,B000EA74HI,"'....By the mid fifties there were six of these yellow car lines operated by the Los Angeles Transit Lines.....a complete, end to end tour of the W and S lines, which were the last car lines using H Series standard-type streetcars.  You'll also catch a glimpse of the two trolly coach lines that graced the city in 1958.  In 1958 The MTA took over from the LATL and converted the whole system to streamlined PCC-type cars.  Most of these cars were painted two tone green.  You'll see the entire routes of the systems five remaining lines, which were identified as RSVP and J.  This historic presentation then takes you to the Georgia Street Car House on the last day of the systems operation, and to the Vernon Yard as the retired cars are placed in storage.""",1189209600,,759,4.551470588235294
