8304098,2,B001G6LXEY,"An erotic mystery involving a revenge plot with the help of technology.

Colleen McDermott is the primary focus of this tale, in which her past won't leave her alone. You don't really get behind her plan, and most of her love scenes are too staged and ridiculous.

The real gem in this film is the beautiful Jane Higginson, who's character has a dead-end relationship with her boss, the man Colleen's out to get.
Looking to get even as well, she joins up with Colleen to get rich off her boss.
However, she meets up with a man who is the man in Colleen's past.

In what is the film's finest moment, he seduces Jane in what is arguably the most sensual soft-core sex scene ever filmed.
You want her to get justice, but the guy kills her when he's found out.
The film's resolution is utterly ridiculous...

Anyway, 0 stars for plot, 2 stars for the love scenes.",1239062400,2,859,4.417721518987341
