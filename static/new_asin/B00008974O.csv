1830450,5,B00008974O,"Franco's 150+ films can be divided into two types: crude, deritive films he quickly cranked out in order to maintain an income, and those into which he poured his heart and soul.  The fact that most of his films fell into the former category, that he had low budgets and short filming periods, his films are often poorly translated, and ill-advised cuts were often created by his american distributors, has led to an underappreciation of Franco's skills.  Although most of his films deserve all the criticism they receive, this disk should help lead to a reevaluation of Franco.
This film, despite the unfortunate title imposed upon it by the producers, is one of Franco's better films, although those looking for a horror film or one of Franco's more fun-filled movies, such as The Girl From Rio, will likely be disappointed.
After the death of his favourite star, Soledad Miranda, in a tragic accident, Franco spent about a year cranking out lousy films in order to quickly fulfill his contractual obligations with a German distributor.  Afterwards, he created this film which is a very personal, poetic, surreal and melancholy rumination upon death, most likely inspired by Soledad's death.  One of the themes touched upon is how death is especially tragic when it happens to someone who is young and innocent.
Attempting to describe the plot only does this film injustice.  Without conveying the film's actual mood created through image, music, and acting, the story sounds absurd and simplistic.  Fortunately, Image has for the first time released Franco's true vision of the film.  As another reviewer notes, you should watch this in the original language.  Previously the dozens of different cuts available in the american market were bastardized versions with inserts created by different directors.  Some of these schlocky inserts are included on the disk as an extra, including some by Jean Rollin (from whom I would have expected much better).",1077667200,17,1954,5.100313479623824
1830451,1,B00008974O,"I first came across this movie on vhs rougly 6 or 7 years ago.  I was browsing the horror section of a local Suncoast when I first discovered it.  The cover had several grotesque looking zombies on it and the description of the film sounded pretty good so I took it home and watched it thinking I was in for a real surprise!  I sure was!  Too bad the surprise was that not only was this film so bad but it didn't even have anything to do with zombies.  I have watched this movie a dozen times and still have no clue what it's about.  There's no story, no plot, no zombies and it ends so abruptly that if you're not sitting down when it ends you'll fall over.  It's like having the carpet pulled out from under you.  Funny thing is I thought this would be the one film that would never see the light of day on dvd.  Shows how much I know about marketing.  I gave this film one star but only because that's the lowest I could go.  Otherwise this movie would be in the red.",1051660800,5,970,4.052631578947368
1830452,5,B00008974O,"Remember those supernatural gothic films of the 70s?Here's a good one from the legendary Jess Franco. Gratuitous nudity and an oft-times muddled plot temporarily take points away from this poetic,atmospheric meditation on life and death. Gosh,I miss the atmosphere those 70s gothics generated so well. A beautiful woman goes to visit family that live in a dark mansion that seems to drift in a netherworld and it all leads to an ulra-creepy ending.
  Forget about the zombies,people. The title was coined to make the film appealing to fans of zombie films. This is still a brilliant film,though.",1050969600,12,595,5.123711340206185
1830453,5,B00008974O,"This is one of best Franco's films: a poetical, surrealist, oneiric and tragical tale of an orphan girl who so much absorbs people's sorrow that she becomes insane and dies.
However, my review's aim is to make clear some mistakes: 1) it is NOT a zombie-film: the zombie-scenes are included in the dvd only as extras and have been shot by Rollin. So, if you are zombie-fans, avoid this film. 2) The original title was obviously different: A VIRGIN AMONG THE LIVING DEAD is only the producer's title. 3) Avoid the English soundtrack, because the dubbing is bad and the music, which in the original version is very beautiful, is totally different. The French soundtrack (with English subtitles) is absolutely great. 4) The film isn't uncut because when producers added the awful zombie or erotic scenes (which are not included in this dvd) they cut off other sequences or footage, which unfortunately haven't yet been recovered. Nevertheless this is one of the most personal Franco's film. It was shot for Cannes Festival, but its destiny was to be spoilt by producers, in order to sell it in the B-cinema-halls.",1050364800,12,1109,4.873015873015873

The zombie scenes had nothing to do with the story--even though the story was non-existent and never there to begin with.  No one gets eaten in this one folks.  This movie repeats scenes a lot, which tells you the type of creativity piled to make this project.  A heap of pony loaf smells better than this DVD waste.  DO NOT BUY OR RENT THIS!

1830479,5,B00008974O,"First off, I really love this movie; it's my favorite Jesse Franco flick.  It's beautifully weird and weirdly beautiful.  I also own both of the above releases of the movie. So what are the differences and which one do I prefer?  The Euroshock version contains what I guess could be called the ""directors cut"" with the Jean Rollins added zombie scenes presented as additional footage. It has the English dubbed track and the subtitled French track.  The Redemption release also contains the directors cut (but retains the 10 second scene that was added by a different director that occurs when Christina is unpacking here bags and hears her uncle and Carmenzi arguing).  It also contains a full version of the movie with the zombies scenes.  It also has a Franco interview and tribute. The audio tracks are the English dubbed, subtitled French (which are slightly different from the Euroshock), and a commentary track which adds a lot to the understanding of the movie.
Now, the important part: the video presentations themselves.  The Euroshock version is much cleaner looking, brighter, and more colorful.  But, it is also very jittery and seems slightly out of focus.  The night scene of the princess of darkness following Christina through the woods and the shots of Christina going up the stairs look better on this disc.  The Redemption version has more scratches and video noise -especially during the opening credits- and is darker.  But, it is also very clear and in focus, the image is also stable.  The scene of Christina following her father through the woods near the end of the movie is SO much clearer and nicer looking.  Maybe someday someone will be able to find a negative that combines the brightness and color of the Euroshock version with the clearness and stability of the Redemption release.  In the meantime, I'll watch the Redemption release.  I'll take clear and stable over out of focus and jittery any day of the week.  Truth be told, the Euroshock version gave me a bit of a headache and made the Christina in the woods with her dad scene look like mush - and its one of my all time favorite low budget movie scenes so maybe it made me a bit prejudiced against it.  I also liked the subtitles better - even though I liked the yellow presentation of them in the Euroshock version.  The audio commentary track is also a real nice addition",1403654400,6,2365,4.754901960784314

1830481,5,B00008974O,"One of my alltime favorite 1970's euro horror flicks. Has English as an option. Very strange acting, actors, plot, ""sound track"".

1830482,3,B00008974O,"I really wanted to like this movie. I really did. I've been exploring a lot of Jess Franco movies and they have really run the gamut from mesmerizing (Venus in Furs, Eugenie De Sade) the truly disturbing (Lorna the Exorcist) to campy and entertaining (Eugenie, Story of Her Journey into Perversion). But each movie does have something to offer. For instance, this movie has a great score, a dream-like pallor over the proceedings and lots of gothic trappings. But even for a movie that could be given lots of room from the viewer to be slightly disjointed and not have to contain much actual horror to be effective, this movie just has too many mistakes, out of focus transitions and incoherency to make it great. Jess Franco's presence as an actor really takes you out of the movie. The Tim Lucas commentary is invaluable and he goes a long way in trying to SELL the merits of the movie. Kino's non-intervention policy really hurts this film. Because the Mondo Macabro releases of their Jess Franco films have been FANTASTIC looking and really help bring out Franco's directorial touches. I do have to say this movie does contain one truly unique and compelling segment: A tracking shot of a hanged Paul Muller floating through a wooded path. It was akin to watching someone's spiritual death on film.",1398988800,,1302,4.765486725663717

1830484,5,B00008974O,"I want to note that this Film in the original Jess Franco version is great, before the zombie inserts and removed nude scenes. In 2003 Image Entertainment released a dvd of this title that was called a director's cut and was a welcome release for the fans of JF. For many the film had attained a cult reputation on the grey markets  as a film to catch in the original French version. Image released a great print of this on dvd and all was right with the world.

Enter 2013. Kino Redemption has license from Eurocine (original producers) and A VIRGIN AMONG THE LIVING DEAD is now back, but despite Eurocine previously licensing a version to Image in 2002, this is using in essence a completely different negative. Many afficionados have discussed how this new version is better in some aspects and worse in others. It seems that in the offices of Eurocine in a darkened musky corner there were three cans of film negatives and they simply chose the one on top to give to Kino Redemption. How in this age of restoration that ten years later they can release or license worse a film in bad condition.. this is Eurocine.

Let's talk about the positives of this release from Kino/Redemption

a great interview with late maestro Tio Jess about this film. Looks like one of his last interviews before death. He has some nice memories to share with the viewer.

Marvelous Tim Lucas commentary about the film

Interview with Alain Petit, friend and confidant of JF

This film is a MUST HAVE - if you don't own the Image 2003 Dvd already, go with this one. Otherwise perhaps you're interested in the supplemental features and buy this version for that reason.. I did. BUT please do not buy with the idea that this will upgrade your old dvd. If you have both versions compare the funeral scenes with Britt Nichols painting her toes. In this version she is almost in shadows, unlike the Image 2003 version where she is vibrant in the frame.

1830486,5,B00008974O,"It is said, according to existing records, that  Spanish director Jess ""Jess"" Franco (1930-2013) helmed 198 films in his long life, and is mostly remembered for exploring themes such as horror, sexy thrillers, women in prison, erotic, among others. His movies are now being released in splendid Blu-ray editions, thanks to the folks at Redemption Films and Kino Lorber. So here's another delight from the sexy seventies: the riveting erotic-horror feature ""A Virgin among the Living Dead."" And let me tell you that this is one special Blu-ray, full of special features, a true collector's item.

Christina von Blanc is Christina Benton, an artist that resides in London and who is notified that she has to go to the country side, where her relatives live. Her father recently died and his testament will be read at that location. Once there, she meets and assorted group of weird and/or eccentric relatives, beginning with Uncle Howard (Howard Vernon), head of the family's state. In addition, there are also Aunt Abigail (Rosa Palomar), Carmenc (Britt Nichols), Basilio (played by the Franco himself; he happens to be the most scary fellow in the film), and others. Furthermore, aunt Herminia just passed away as Christina arrived. All these folks make Christina afraid, as they radiate death, with their zombie-like behavior. Sadly for her, she has to stay in the mansion for a while because they have to wait for the notary who will read the will. Her prolonged stay gets her deeper into the horror inside that house and the real reason for her father's death.

As in any of Jess Franco's films, ""A Virgin among the Living Dead"" is loaded with female nudity, mixing the erotic with the horror. This fantastic Blu-ray includes the edited version (""A Virgin among the Living Dead""), plus ""Christina, Princess of Eroticism,"" the original director's cut. And, as mentioned earlier, the Blu-ray also includes audio commentaries, alternate erotic footage, a documentary about the various versions of the film, a documentary about Franco, and much more! (France; 1973; color; original cut - 79 min, alternate cut - 90 min; plus additional materials)

A girl arrives from London to visit her estranged relatives in a remote castle for the reading of her father's will. After a while she discovers that they are all in fact dead and her decision to live with them turns into a nightmare. Unable to leave she's drawn into a macabre underworld through visions of nude satanic rituals and her own impending sacrifice.

Ok, now that we got that out of he way! I haven't seen a review on here yet for Redemption Films ReRelease of Jess Francos film so I will write one. I may have already written a review about it for the release by the company IMAGE. I just cant remember. Either way, its a simple purchase for the following reasons.

Pros
+Cheap enough
+All 3 different visions of the film on one disc!
+The Euro Shock IMage release is now Out Of Print, so you won't get it for cheap!
+There is nudity, gore, ghosts, zombies, drug like dream feel to it (That last one might be a con)
+Beautiful Music
+The extras on Redemptions ReRelease are worth it alone with Jess Francos LAst Interview Alive! Stills, Trailers, and a bunch of other cool stuff if your a fan of Mr. Franco.

Cons
-It gets only 3 stars because its a Franco film, none of them are good.
-As far as I can tell, it seems like the same transfer from the old IMAGE release. Not like Oasis Of Zombies, that transfer looked amazing!
-Cheap dvd case, the artwork is great but the case is thin and cheap trash. The way companies do things these days. BRING BACK THE THICK OLD SCHOOL CASES! I almost broke it taking it out of the package!

Not going to cover the plot, long story short you get all 3 different ideas of the film. The sexual one, the zombie one, and in the special features the porno scene missing from the other two ideas of the film. I prefer the Zombie one aka A VIRGIN AMONG THE LIVING DEAD. Its just fun, has everything in it to make it a crazy film. One of my favorite movies from Franco. RIP.

**Do not be mistaken, even with the inserts of zombie footage its still not a zombie film your thinking of. They only show up for maybe 5 minutes and its at the very end. They are also classic Night of the living Dead style (guys with painted faces) not Lucio Fulci style (Gory and ripped up looking).

If your a franco fan, pick it up. If your new to franco, chances are you won't like it. Start somewhere else like Devil Hunter or Cannibals.",1377388800,,2083,4.247474747474747
1830488,4,B00008974O,"A VIRGIN AMONG THE LIVING DEAD is a surrealistic film by Jess Franco. As I understand it, it's a meditation on death, loss, and despair. As a typical horror movie, or any typical movie of any kind for that matter, it makes little to no sense. It's more of an emotional / metaphorical story than a logical / literal one. Filled w/ bizarre images and seemingly nonsensical scenes, AVATLD is an hallucinogenic nightmare. As such, it deals not so much in reality, but in fears and symbolism...",1372896000,,489,4.632183908045977
1830489,5,B00008974O,"This film has great cover art, but it's very misleading; there are no flesh eating zombies or monsters in the film.  The entire film is strange and begins with a woman visiting some family members who live isolated in a luxurious mansion.  They all look normal, but her uncle's skin is ice cold; I guess that means he's a zombie. Things now just keep getting stranger as she's around this weird group of people, and the film delivers plenty of nudity.  Apparently, from what I saw from the ending, they are worshipping a woman called ""The Queen of Darkness"" who lives in a swamp.  The film has a scene where a fully nude woman is licking the blood off another fully nude woman who she cut with a pair of scissors; but aside from that scene, there really isn't any more gore in the film, and there's also no onscreen violence.  The entire film mostly consists of atmosphere, scenery, and nudity.  The film is very well directed, has good music, and the films scenery is great; they picked a great place to shoot the film.  The pace is a little slow in parts, but I wasn't bored by the film.  The main actress, Christina Von Blanc, gets fully nude and is great looking, and the entire film is nice to look at because of the scenery and atmosphere; but I have a small problem with the ending.  The ending makes it confusing as to how much was reality and how much was a dream. This film may not appeal to many mainstream horror fans, but I personally thought it was a great classic.

The DVD quality is great, and you get a bunch of deleted scenes for the extras. This DVD was first released by Image which has now been discontinued, but it has now been released again by Redemption. I've just noticed that Amazon is mixing the reviews with the older image release with the newer release of the film. I bought the older Image release. This movie was filmed in different versions, and the extras on my DVD has some nudity and those zombie scenes that occur when the main actress is dreaming from the alternate cut of the film. The zombies don't eat anybody and they don't look horrific or anything like that; they just rise up with some creepy music. These zombie sequences are really cheap; but I like those sequences because of the creepy music, along with the effective atmosphere and scenery.  From what I've read, the newer DVD has both versions on the disc; so those scenes are just incorporated into that alternate cut that you can now choose to watch.",1355011200,6,2455,4.469798657718121
1830490,5,B00008974O,"Who do I think I am?? For some reason I do not like the reviews of this film. And I am not just being a major a#$hole. I like to learn alot from other reviews. Like I did from a ""comment"" of a review of ""Vampyros Lesbos"". And I just got done reading some interesting reviews of ""Sinner.."" a film I have not seen yet.

Moreover, I do not know why people are so hung up on the fact, or why they feel they need to point out that this is not a zombie movie. One point reviewers are getting right is that it is certainly an inexplicable film. With alot of unanswered questions. For example: is it all a dream or nightmare?

Further, one point people are missing, is that Franco is clever in this film to include some ""horror film staples"". Like a woman arriving alone at an old style European Inn, late at night. All he needed to do was make it a ""dark and stormy night"". And the eerie obligatory foreshadowing from the innkeeper: i.e. ""no one live up there"" or ""no one goes there"". And in a part Franco plays himself(Basilio), an ""Igor"" like character arriving to give the unsuspecting sacrificial character a ride, or in this case an escort, because someone else is chaufferring the car they are driving in. And later in the film, after she is settled, she is walking in the woods, with another character, and they meet another creepy old man with more cautionary warnings: ""get away from here, while you still can"" etc etc.",1334016000,,1421,4.3584905660377355
1830491,4,B00008974O,"It's time to party in the dumpster of broken screams!  Jess Franco's A Virgin Among the Living Dead undeniably qualifies as trash cinema for many horror fans, possibly even to some cult underground horror fans.  It's definitely low budget with some sloppy drunken storytelling, and it often dry heaves on the dirty curb of absolute nonsense.  This ain't for the kiddos or your typical Hollywood horror fans.  But for the craziest of cult horror party animals, this head-spinning disorientation might somehow wake up in bed next to brilliance.  Not exactly sure what I'm saying here, but just like this flick, you gotta be willing to just go with it.

Cristina is a hot little vixen (probably a virgin I'm guessing) that is paying a visit to her extended family in their old mansion of Montesserate.  She is warned to stay away from that old deserted place, but she insists her fam is waiting for her there.  So she gets to the house and kicks it with her blood, kinda sorta literally.

The title of this movie hints that Cristina's kin are a bunch of zombies, but that isn't really accurate.  No dead flesh, shambling or moaning here.  Other reviewers claim that they are vampires, but the sunlight doesn't seem to bother them either.  Maybe they are ghosts with a thirst for blood and naked chicks?  Whatever you wanna call them--maybe Franco is making a sly profound stab at in-laws--who knows?  But these folks can definitely cause some mayhem.

What can you the viewer expect?

**POSSIBLE SPOILERS
Well, there is some gratuitous full frontal nudity after about thirty minutes in.  When a hot woman goes for a stroll in the woods and sees a lake, you know the skinny-dipping urge is just uncontrollable.  Additionally, there are some weird conversations with bloody human parts being hidden.  Women who sleep naked while other family members sit and stare.  What else?  Oh, a big black phallus that controls the fate of the world.  Plus, there is a little lesbian blood sucking bedroom endeavor involving scissors.
**

Yeah, this is a Jess Franco film.  Nothing adds up.  Not a lot of blood or gore.  No real story with every loose end getting tied up nicely.  But love it or hate it, it does have some crazy stuff that you just won't see anywhere else.  Recommended to those who think about the box from outside.",1305849600,3,2316,4.7368421052631575
1830492,1,B00008974O,"A Virgin Among the Living Dead (Jess Franco, 1973)

Typical Franco dreck (co-directed, IMDB tells me, by fellow schlockmeister Jean Rollin) about a hot chick (The Dead Are Alive's Christina von Blanc in her final big-screen appearance) who goes to Montserrat to attend the reading of her father's will and finds out that her family is... not quite what she remembers. I'm sure, given the title, it's not a spoiler to tell you they're all undead, and she has to figure out how to get away before they ensnare her in... well, okay, that WOULD be a spoiler. Not that the plot is all that important to Franco' vision, as it usually isn't; he's way too busy plotting ways to get the actresses he's filming naked as much of the time as possible. While this is usually a laudable goal, and when you're dealing with von Blanc, Britt Nichols, and Anne Libert (both of whom return from Franco's '72 hit Dracula's Daughter), there's nothing wrong with that at all. But when turning it into a movie you're planning on releasing, you should probably either couch that nudity in a plot that actually works or simply turn the thing into a softcore flick and be done with it.

Giesen and Hahn's infamous (and highly entertaining) book The Worst Films of All Time lists this. I don't agree. Hell, I'm not even convinced it's the worst film Jess Franco (who is still active, and just directed his 192nd film, Paula-Paula, with the indefatigable Lina Romay) ever put out (I haven't seen a tenth of the guy's output, but as far as I'm concerned that would be Oasis of the Zombies). It's certainly not the worst thing I saw this weekend. If you're familiar with Franco's work, you know what you're getting with this. If not, just be warned that Franco is obsessed with naked chicks to the detriment of plot, character development, etc., and you'll be ready for it. *",1299542400,,1845,4.621951219512195
1830493,3,B00008974O,"this is art house horror flick, in which Jess Franco tries to deal with the recent loss of his own lover Soledad miranda , who was killed in a car crash. This type of flick is a aquired taste though and if you don't like art films then this isn't for you at all.  It is part of the
style of movie that was popular back in the sixties and early seventies and occasionally today. The nonlinear plotless type of movie, there is a general plot in which a girl returns to her household and everyone in it is dead and cursed.  Is she insane and imagining everything? the movie like many films of this type including fellini's films bounces around and doesn't stick to a storyline between the womans strange experiences.  There was a zombie scene in the movie that was shot ten years later and is included as a extra scene but it wasn't part of the movie originally. (jean rollin shot that scene) There is lots of nudity though and the movie ends suddenly, This is about atmosphere and like other movies of this type (which are for me only occasionally watched because I want a straight storyline) you may be confused. However the last scene does give you a ending which seems to be about them crossing  the river styx. (this is the river where the dead must cross to the afterlife). it's the pond of the dead.  So if you like image laiden movies that wax poetic and don't worry about scenes connecting but does give a ending, something many other movies of this type don't even bother with. As if to say: ""you wanted images and ideas now you figure it out, or in the case of some who cares about endings this is a modern art movie.  And modern art is not bad in some cases at all.  But a traditional horror fan may not be happy with this art house type of ghost movie at all.  I think as a art flick it deserves four stars but for horror fans that may not be enough so I gave it three. But for  non fans of this type of art movie, this may be a two or less star.",1258848000,,1956,4.180851063829787

Anyway, I like the film quite a bit. It's very surrealistic and doesn't exactly have a typical linear plot (lots of Franco's films don't), but it is very enjoyable if you are open to these types of film. But really, I just wrote this review to correct a few mistakes made by another reviewer before me.

There is a lot of confusion with this film since it has been cut, re-edited, and released under so many different titles over the years, but here are the real facts about the film that have been mistaken in some other reviews:

""A Virgin Among The Living Dead"" is the original title of the film, not a re-title. ""Cristina, Princess of Eroticism"" was actually a later title given to the movie when they were trying to sell it as an ""erotic"" film.

Later on video, it was re-titled ""Zombie 4: A Virgin Among The Living Dead"" or just ""Zombie 4"" at times. This was to cash in on the success of Lucio Fulci's 1980 film ""Zombie"", which was released on video as ""Zombie 2"" many places (because ""Dawn of the Dead"" was released as ""Zombi"" in Europe). The video release titled ""Zombie 5: Monster Hunter"" was actually the Italian film ""Absurd"", also known as ""Anthropophagous 2"".

Lastly, the zombie footage edited into the film is not from Jean Rollin's film ""Zombie Lake"". It is extra (really boring) footage shot later to be inserted into this film when they were trying to cash in on it as a zombie movie. However, the extra footage is often attributed to Jean Rollin as director.

It is in French with English subtitles and the French audio track sounds much better than the English one so I recommend it.

So there it is. Give it a try if you feel so inclined. If these kinds of bizarre Euro-horror movies aren't your thing then I would stay away. Your choice.",1221696000,2,1911,4.43019943019943
1830495,4,B00008974O,"WARNING -- This is NOT, I repeat, NOT a Zombie movie.  If anyone out there typed ""Living Dead"" into the Amazon search engine and come up with this little golden nugget Of Jess Franco weirdness, click the back button right now!

I know this movie has been re-titled ""Zombie 4"" and ""Zombie 5"" when intercut with footage from the 1980 film ""Zombie Lake.""  But the ""Living Dead"" of the title refers to Vampires.  The original title was ""Cristina, Princess of Eroticism,"" but for some reason, they chose to mislead unsuspecting Zombie movie fans, as well as to reveal cause of the strange goings on we are meant to be wondering about.

I'm a great admirer of Jess Franco.  I like to watch his movies, but unfortunately, it's impossible.  Not only because he has made over 200 movies, and each one of them has about 5 different titles, but because the overwhelming majority of his films are crap.  From what I read about Jess Franco, he would not argue with me on this particular point, because he allegedly believes ALL of his films are crap, whereas I actually like some of them.

The DVD has options to watch the film in its original language with English subtitles (which I didn't do, so I don't know what language that actually is, although I would assume it was French.) or dubbed in English.  Most people probably think the preferred viewing option would be subtitles.  As you can imagine, the dubbing is pretty atrocious, but there is a very specific reason why someone would want to watch the film this way.  This film has been famous for several years (well, famous in a cult-like way) for being the source of many prominant and more lengthy samples on My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult's classic album, ""Confessions of a Knife.""  Long time Thrill Kill Kult fans remember the eerie, ""I hear her...she's calling me tonight.."" and of course, ""I'm blind, but I can see the color of souls, and yours is white,"" which is still used in their live show today.  We've sought after it for years, and it's finally available on DVD!  Although, sadly, my fellow TKK fans, the now legendary, ""I'm gonna find her!  And I'm gonna kill her!"" sample is NOT in this film, but if you found that, don't you think you'd only end up disappointed?

Cristina is traveling to visit her extended family in a mansion, and everyone tells her not to go there, because no one lives there.  Unless you blocked out the title of the movie, you can probably guess why they think this, even after Cristina arrives, and meets her family members.  This movie doesn't have a lot of gore, but plenty of nudity, and general Jess Franco weirdness.  The people who live in the house, and some who just hang around for no apparent reason, like to come into Cristina's room while she's sleeping.  This never stops her from sleeping naked above her sheets, however, and if it did, it wouldn't be much of a Jess Franco movie.

One such person is Linda, a blind woman who says she wants to help Cristina, although it is never really explained how or why.  One morning, Cristina wakes, naked of course, to find a big black dildo on her floor.  When she flings it away, Linda says, ""Oh, no, you've shattered the great ebony phallus!  You are now doomed to eternal misery!""  I haven't exactly figured out how Linda knew that Cristina shattered the great ebony phallus, since she is blind.  But, since it is never mentioned again, I have to assume one of two things: 1) Linda knew Cristina was doomed to eternal misery anyway, in a mansion with the living dead, and shattering the phallus had nothing to do with it.  She just put it there because she knows that a girl who sleeps naked when strangers keep coming into her room might find it useful or 2) Jess Franco wanted to shoot a scene with a naked girl sitting in front of a big black dildo, and wrote in Linda's line in a failed attempt to incorporate it into the plot.

Did I say, ""plot""?  I didn't mean to.  Don't watch this expecting a story to unfold.  Like most of his best films, it's a lot of weirdness and very little story.  But if you're interested in Jess Franco enough to have looked this up, I would recommend it.  It's also a must-see for Thrill Kill Kult fans.",1100304000,38,4184,4.505305039787799

7980276,3,B00008974O,"""A Virgin Among the Living Dead""(1973) is directed by Jess Franco and Jean Rollin. The original title was ""Christina, Princess of Eroticism""(directed by Jess Franco,79min), but the producers wanted the film to be longer, and when Jess Franco wasn't available he recommended Jean Rollin, who added some Zombie scenes to fill things out to about 130 minutes. Nicely this set includes both versions. There was also at one point a thought by the producers to add more erotic footage. These 5 minutes of extra footage were directed by another person (anonymously?) and are also included in the special features. Other features include an interview (16 min) with Jess Franco, where he talks about the film, and his frustration with the film company who wanted to continually add/change his original feature, which he liked as is. There is also a 12 min documentary by Daniel Gouyette called ""The Three Faces of Christina"".
This movie is in blu-ray but it hasn't been cleaned up of dirt, specks, etcetera, on the image. Oddly enough this doesn't seem to be a problem while watching this film anymore than seeing an old film that has seen better days. The accidentally decayed image seems to enhance the experience much like Tarantino purposely used it to his advantage in his Grindhouse film.",1453075200,7,1285,4.981395348837209

 Fair warning, we can call this a Zombie movie only by a very generous stretch of our best wishes.  A young school girl named Christina has been summoned to France or maybe Spain upon the death of her father whom she had never met.  Now officially an orphan she must be present for the reading of the will.  As it happens, she notices that her blind uncle feels quite cold to the touch when she greets him with a kiss.  That and a snarky remark that the family members do not have much of an appetite sums up the Zombie references until the last scene of the film, which explains all.  More or less.
 Christina von Blank plays the young Christina in this moody, atmospheric and intellectually ambitious excursion into soft porn hiding in a horror film bathrobe.  The fit as a fiddle young von Blank has her clothes off in many of her scenes.  A typical scene has her in bed naked as a jay bird and then some dream sequence evolves, sometimes involving her simply walking around in the woods in her caftan.  Another sequence has her lying out-starkers-surrounded by candles in some kind of dream of human sacrifice scene.  Actress Britt Nichols plays a family member of unknown relation who also spends much of her time un or partly clothed to our benefit.  Poor Linda Hastreiter, who plays 'the blind girl' not only gets naked but has Nichols lap up her blood.  And she doesn't get in the credits!
 We might think that a Jesus Franco film has a high likelihood of incoherence.  Some might blame the lack of story coherence to the film's French language dialog and inept English language sub-titles, but they would be wrong.  Franco wanted to make a kind of Italian New Wave horror flick with plenty of naked girls wandering around and he did just that.  The film style and the dead pan acting reminds one of a third rate Italian depiction of Da Da from the 1950's.  But Franco livens things up by having Christian von Blank taking a skinny dip in a pond of lily pads.  All very existential and very pretentious.  But fans of full frontal nudity will not mind, or full backal nudity or fans of lesbo Zombie stuff either.  In the finest of French traditions none of the actresses have notable tan lines.
 Franco made something like 160 films, his last in 2013 at the age of 83 shortly before he died that same year.  He made a lot of low budget horror films but also a few films we might have heard of like Venus in Furs a 1969 film with James Darren, Maria Rohm and Klaus Kinski.  He also spent part of his career making outright pornographic films.  Sometimes his adult themed horror skirts close to the line.  To the end he often handled both the writing and directing, including both tasks in his last film Revenge of the Alligator Ladies.
 Franco cast himself in A Virgin Among the Living Dead as Basilio, a retarded mute who does odd jobs for the dead but highly functioning family members.  Other family members besides the blind girl and the bling uncle include the Britt Nichols character who dresses, acts and is made up like one of the night clubbers from La Dolche Vita.  She had no appetite but she does chain smoke, unusual for the undead.
  A Virgin Among the Living Dead lasts a short one hour and 20 minutes and should be rated R for extensive and prolonged nudity.  No Zombie chewing at all.
 The story didn't make much sense but the photography shows exceptional skill, maybe even genius.  Franco does not easily fit into one of the standard boxes.  The sound occasionally staggers into the worst quality, a feature I detest.  I give it a fair two and a half brains.
 In some versions of the film some Zombie splices from the 1980's pop in.  This adds nothing to the story but does let some very traditional Zombies lurch around.  Think of a random film clip insert.  Franco must also take responsibility for Oasis of the Zombies which is a strong contender for worst Nazi Zombie flick ever made.  See the review elsewhere in these pages.",1425427200,,3995,4.505571030640668
