This movie is NOT the one with John Wayne.  If you enjoy mystery, suspense and an unexpected ending, you will want to see this movie.",1454025600,,282,4.384615384615385
8637615,5,B00HZOXOY8,"Expected very little,as it was given 2 stars. Was very pleasantly surprised to view a very good film. Gloria Stuart & Paul Kelly were the only names I recognized,but actually recognized many other faces,as Leon Ames as Kelly's ex-partner,who set him up. Paul Hurst as a cop will entertain you,as he's always done in anything I've seen him in,esp when he has to hike 70 floors when the elevators are on hold for Kelly and his cronies.",1439856000,2,433,4.636363636363637
8637616,4,B00HZOXOY8,"Island in the Sky is a downed aircraft survival movie from 1953 that starred John Wayne, but that's not this one. This is the second-tiered Island in the Sky that 20th Century Fox trotted out in 1938 and runs only some minutes past an hour. If you'd heard of Gloria Stuart, it's most likely her as the 100-year-old Old Rose from James Cameron's Titanic. I'll have you know, in 1938, she was very much in her prime, all grace and gorgeousness and easy decorum.

Yeah, son, I know her best from watching The Old Dark House (1932) and The Invisible Man (1933) and her supporting roles in two Shirley Temple vehicles: Poor Little Rich Girl (1936) and Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1938). But, even in her more obscure onscreen parts, there was just something about Gloria Stuart that struck me. Given, she's a looker. And she had class. But she also had this warmth about her that made you want to side with her from jump. Anyway, if it's not yet obvious, let me say that I'd watch anything she's in.

Island in the Sky is one of those more obscure parts. But you ought to take a gander. It's a thriller in which the plot develops like a mother. The story starts with the assistant D.A. Michael Fraser (Michael Whalen) and his secretary Julie Hayes (Stuart) having a night out on the town. They've just ambled into the posh nightclub, Island in the Sky, nestled high up on the 70th floor of the Courtland Building. The assistant D.A. is in the mood to celebrate his engagement, see? But, first, he lets the unwitting Julie in on it by way of an informal marriage proposal. He regales the happy sudden fiance about how he's got a month's holiday coming to him. It's honeymoon talk, son.

But, first, there's the homicide assigned to Fraser at the eleventh hour. Off both of them go to the scene of the crime, a study with a corpse rendered so by shotgun and an open safe nearby. And there's the dead man's son, a.k.a. the suspect (Robert Kellard), and it seems cut and dried. Come the trial and the conviction and the death sentence. And there's the assistant D.A. with the steamship tickets all set for the honeymoon. And there's his secretary postponing the wedding.

Back then this simply wasn't done, so credit the movie for tweaking the conventions of the day. In an era in which womenfolk were relegated to window dressing, Gloria Stuart's character stands by her conviction and grabs the bull by the horns. She thinks the suspect falsely accused. And off she goes, the gutsy dame working solo - because the assistant D.A.'s got his feelings hurt and doesn't have her back in this one. This isn't about him, anyway. Gloria Stuart is just fine and resolute playing the intrepid amateur sleuth what's working off a wide hunch. Again, the film is barely over an hour long, so things move fast. There's time enough for an impromptu prison break, collusion with a racketeer, a car chase in which the participants get up to speeds of *gasp* 60 mph, and a wild denouement 70 stories up. There's also stock comic relief in the shape of the dimbulb cop sidekick Happy (Paul Hurst). But this isn't about him, either.",1413763200,3,3105,4.579136690647482
