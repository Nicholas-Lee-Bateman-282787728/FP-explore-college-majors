8463859,5,B005B1XOJC,"Jerry Goldsmith, in my opinion, is the greatest composer of our time. Been a longtime fan of his Trek work, since 4th grade, but only recently came to be a fan of ALL his work. The DVD starts with my all time Goldsmith favorite Star Trek:First Contact and ends with the very rousing End Titles of The Final Conflict. In between is a veritable smorgasbord of his Sci Fi and Thriller music. Featuring Planet of the Apes, The Swarm, Poltergeist, The Omen, Total Recall, The Illustrated Man, Capricorn One and much more. And all played by the wonderful Tenerife Orchestra and Choir led by composers Mark Snow and Diego Navarro. Please by a copy and celebrate the mempry of Jerry Goldsmith.",1377475200,2,685,4.669421487603306
