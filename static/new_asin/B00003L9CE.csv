1331999,3,B00003L9CE,"Okay, so these aren't adult movies.  Let's be honest - how many `adults' in the stereotypical sense will sit through a Godzilla movie.  Well, I will.  Why the gripe about the Rebirth Of Mothra movies being `geared towards kids?'  Just because the kids are the main characters doesn't make it any less entertaining.  I guess the main difference between these and the Godzilla movies is there is not a lot of collateral damage.  Most of the battles take place in the wilderness away from innocent civilians, and the military never gets involved (I guess so long as the cities are left alone, the Japanese military doesn't care what the monsters do).  Hence, G-rated Godzilla...very little chaos and destructiveness, but enjoyable nonetheless. If you're a godzilla fan I'm pretty confident you'll like these, and if you're not, its okay to let the kids see `em.  They've got a great anti-industry pro-earth message, and fantastic, four color effects -really superior.  With the kids as main characters, younger viewers won't get bored either.
REBIRTH OF MOTHRA - When my nine year old saw this he wept like the Dickens.  Remember, the title IS `REBIRTH of Mothra.' But don't worry.... if Sci Fi teaches us anything its that death is never forever.  Basically nasty treekillers clearing a path for progress bust open an ancient seal which unleashes Desghidorah (or Death Ghidorah), a black hydra (kind of a four legged King Ghidorah) which drinks the life out of forests.  The Elias, those irrepresible Earth First faeries from Infant Island sing that kickin' Mothra song and call up earth's protector (a giant moth, for those unfamiliar with the character) to go and trump Desghidorah, who is being egged on by an evil faerie called Belvera.  When the tide turns for the worse, Mothra's (son/daughter?) larva speedily cocoons itself and is born as Rainbow Mothra - a really stunning looking creature with the ability to heal the damage Desghidorah has done.  The story is told from the point of view of a little boy and his sister, and if you're looking for a good all-around morality tale, SPOILER AHEAD: Desghidorah goes down, the Elias forgive Belvera, and the brother and sister (and their distant parents) all learn to love each other better. END SPOILER
REBIRTH OF MOTHRA 2: The effects in this one are stupendous (particularly Aquamothra's final attack on Dagharla), but the story is a tad weaker.  In this one three kids discover a weird little alien (?) creature who leads them to a kind of Atlantean temple out in the middle of the Sea of Japan.  At the same time as all this, deadly acid-spitting starfish are popping up all over thanks to Dagharla, an giant amphibious beastie again being supported by Belvera.  Two teens (or twentysomethings) chase the kids, looking to exploit the little alien thing.  Again, good morality tale, as everything and everybody turns out not so bad in the end (and there's no death in this one, except for SPOILER AHEAD:the noble self-sacrifice of the little alien thing at the end). END SPOILER  Good for the kids, but beware that the little alien thing can produce a liquid which has the power to heal, and its delivery is a little gross...get the picture?
Overall, great stuff for the whole family, especially if the whole family likes Godzilla (like mine does).  Maybe a little silly at points, but so what?  If you're bothering to read this review, you will most likely enjoy it. Go ahead.  Buy it, and get the kids hooked on kaiju movies.  And if you're a mothra fan, you'll love it.  The faeries get a great treatment, Mothra is updated and has some nifty new powers, and the Mosura song sounds cool as ever. No, its not in Japanse (it doesn't say it is anywhere on the package either), but it IS widescreen, and the sound and picture are crisp and clear.",1047254400,56,3802,4.79601226993865
1332000,4,B00003L9CE,"This is great Japanese fantasy family DVD viewing. These films are a bit more light hearted than the Godzilla films in the 90's, but still have all the great monster fights we love. I can wach these films with my Pre-schooler or can enjoy them on my own being a Godzilla fan for many years. Both films vibrant and colorful with better specail effects than it's sixties conterpart. Mothra-I has a new version of Ghidora as a more western looking dragon and Mothra must fight to the finish to defeat this three-headed foe. In Mothra-II she battles Dagahra a more aquatic foe and must transform herself into Aqua-Mothra to defeat this monster. This DVD is a must for Gozilla fans young & old, boy & girl. The widescreen format and digital sound makes you want to make some popcorn and imagine you're back at your local matinee.",996969600,9,824,4.612244897959184
1332001,3,B00003L9CE,"Me - as I would myself count as a fan of the real Godzilla - was somehow disappointed by the movies. These movies are clearly targeted to kids and contain a lot of scenes which are nice for kids but not so much for adults. The quality of FX is - according to my impression - cheaper and worse than those of the 60's movies. I got the impression the movies are somehow mass production style with cheap CG FX. Made without 'love'. The kids who are going to a forgotten city under the sea are filmed on a relatively 'cheap' sound stage and you can see it - mass production, cheap series type. The only thing I found nice: Mothra is changing it's outlook and capabilities several times until it can beat the 'evil' creature. Well, IMHO not for the serious fan of Godzilla movies but OK for the completeness of the collection.",968284800,3,821,4.337662337662338

1332003,3,B00003L9CE,"It's nice to have all these '90s Toho monster movies finally available in the US, and it's certainly worth the money, but I am disappointed with this DVD.

It doesn't have any extras, not even trailers, and it escapes me why  they couldn't include the original Japanese soundtrack in addition to the  dubbed English one.  How much would it have increased costs to include an audio track that already existed?",953337600,8,408,4.785714285714286
1332004,5,B00003L9CE,This DVD is great! A must buy for all kaiju fans. I wonder if there is a collection of Mothra trilogy someday......,951350400,2,115,4.2727272727272725
1332005,4,B00003L9CE,"Tri stars DVD release of MOTHRA 1 & 2 are a welcome addition and improvement on the previous VHS versions. The DVD is Letterboxed and Enhanced for 16/9 televisions, and looks great, with fine detail and color.  The sound will impress anyone with a suround sound system, with good  separation. The only demerit would be tri-stars poor dubbing of these  films. There is no real excuse not to have done better. The voices are  often mismatched, and the vocal performances sub-standard. In a fantasy  film this can be quite distracting, and too often it is blamed on the  filmakers rather than the American distributor, where the fault realy lies.  As for the movies themselves, they are charming and colorful, if a little  confusing. One more re-write would have smoothed out some of the plot  points. One of the nice things is that these are films in which the kids  are the main protagonists, with few adults intruding to throw a damper on  things.  Kids and most adults who remember being kids will enjoy them.  Visually the films are imaginative, NOT realistic. Realisim comes secondary  to a fast pace and colorful visuals. And that is one of the most wonderful  things about them. Both films have moments of real beauty, and striking  imagination. Best moments of the first film are the death of the older  Mothra, sinking slowly beneath the ocean,wings outstreached as if still  flying, and the rebirth of the new Mothra, growing from thousands of  smaller ones.. The second film is better still, with a climax that finds  Mothra morphing into Aqua Mothra, and fighting under the sea. Its amazing  to think that both films cost onlyt 4  million  each, and that the Special  effects, directed by Kochi Kawakitta, were done in just 80 days for each  film!  Kawakitta did effects for a staggering 10 projects in only 8 years,  yet managed to give each movie a distinctive look, and unique moments. One  of the best things about both films is the fine music of Toshiyuk Watanabe.  His are amoung the finest heard in Japanese kaiju in quite a while, and a  welcome change from the rather over used Ifukube music . When Mothra  attacks at the end of MOTHRA 2 , Kawakita's effects and Watanabe's music  blend wonderfuly into a fun and thrilling climax. Just too bad that the  poor dubbing stand out so sharply to the rest of the movie. Memo to  TRI-STAR...Do a better job with better dubbing next time!  However, that  aside, these are fun , imaginative family oriented films, that will please  many fans.",950313600,14,2502,4.734883720930233

1332021,5,B00003L9CE,"While the notion of a children's movie from Toho might bring to mind the horrendous Godzilla's Revenge AKA All Monsters Attack,
Rebirth of Mothra is an all around superior effort in virtually every way possible.
The children's Movie aspect is generally unoffensive and even has a rather imaginative and entertaining pintsized Kaiju fight-scene that takes place in a living-room. The more fantastical Mothra-mythos proves to be a generally good fit for a Children's movie.

Once the villain of the movie, the bi-pedal member of Godzilla rouge King Ghidorah's family,
Death Ghidorah AKA Desghidorah makes his entry, the movie quickly switches gears into the kind of large-scale Kaiju brawls that you'd expect out of Heisei-era Toho and then some. The Kaiju fights are quite frankly spectacular,
both Death Ghidorah and Mothra Leo look great and the effects from the beams and lasers shooting about during the brawls bring to mind something like Dragon Ball Z and more than justifies sitting through the Children's Movie scenes.
The movie ends on a environmental message that would have made the late Ishiro Honda proud,
but keeps it hopeful enough so as to not bum out the kids in the audience.

In summary: Rebirth of Mothra is a good time for both kids and adults,
I know I'll watch it with my kids one day, that's for sure!",1403913600,,1324,4.932735426008969

1332023,3,B00003L9CE,"I suppose these films must have been made for children; maybe they'd make a good introduction for your children into the wonderful world of kaiju. They're very ""cutesy"" but without the charm this term may imply. These films were made in the 90's and rely too heavily on CG animation as well. The hammy acting and silly special effects are reminiscent of the Power Rangers. Yes, there are suit-monster fighting. That is the saving grace of these films, for me anyway. I could watch guys in monster suits whack each other all day, and that's why I bought this DVD. If that doesn't do it for you, maybe these films aren't for you",1399507200,,626,4.548672566371682

1332031,4,B00003L9CE,"Both of these Mothra reboot films from the late 90s are enjoyable. First, Toho fans take note: this series ignores any previous Mothra canon. These movies would be excellent for getting kids into the kaiju movies, and both come with a very real message about respecting the earth: deforestation in 1 and oceanic pollution in 2. They also contain good messages about friendship and family. All in all I'd say they're PG: the evil monsters Death Gidorah and Dagorla are sort of scary, but with a parent watching kids should be ok, and you know Mothra and the kids are going to win. As an adult kaiju fan, I thought the opponent monsters and the new look for Mothra were pretty cool, and the music during the battle scenes is rollicking, kind of like something from ""The Goonies."" (Be on the lookout for Aqua Mothra, a pretty neat transformation.) My one minus star on this review is for the studio not offering the original Japanese talk track, which adult kaiju fans tend to prefer. But I also understand kids won't want to read subtitles anyway. Here's hoping they release the third movie on DVD in the US soon.",1393718400,2,1111,4.616161616161616

We have a vast majority of all the movies.  That being said, I was skeptical about one so recent (1992) but decided, for $9.99, it was worth a shot.

He absolutely loves it and these newer movies are just as campy as the originals:  A moth, with super powers, that takes on and defeats his enemies.  How deliciously absurd!  Definitely get the Rebirth of Mothra 3.  If you thought Aqua Mothra was whimsically appealing (Rebirth of Mothra 2), just wait till you see Light Speed Mothra as he travels back in time 130 million years.

1332054,4,B00003L9CE,"I had the pleasure of watching this one on cable last year when I was invalid with a severe knee injury, and could not reach the remote control.  Nowever; my gorlfriend LOVES Mothra, so I purchased this set for her as a gift.  My review is thus:  LOL!

Seeing a DVD with a double feature of Rebirth of Mothra, and Rebirth of Mothra 2 was just too great for me not to buy, and knowing how my girlfriend loves the big bug, I had to get it for her to add to our Godzilla collection. Rebirth of Mothra is definitely that - its a new mothra, a powerful mothra, a mothra reborn into an actual persona and made sympathetic and likeable, but also a tad silly. Sometimes it's a good kind of silly, other times it's just a boring silly. The plot was a typical kaiju (Japanese for monster, i.e. Godzilla, Mothra, Rodan, etc.) plot, with a seal being removed and a wicked monster coming out to wreak havoc on the planet. The human (characters) acting wasn't that good, it really wasn't, but then again when was the last time a G Film was nominated for an Academy Award? The special effects were pretty cool in places, and pretty bad in others BUT there was some pretty good cinematography, and the typical landscape battlefields were as good as ever.

Most of the kaijus I've seen, which is a hell of a lot, tie the humans into the story somehow. That way you're not just watching two giant monsters going at it for 90 minutes. Most of the time, the human plot is cheesy but still entertaining. Sadly - Rebirth of Mothra is not one of those films. The human plot, if I could even call it that, was boring and pointless and pretty much just had a couple bratty kids sitting on a mountainside watching the battle. If that's not bad enough, some of the lines seemed to be spoken in telekinesis, considering it was just blank stares looking at each other.

I don't know whether to blame the writing, the directing, or the acting for all the blank, meaningless stares. All the humans were pretty horrible actors, and the bad dubbing didn't help any. The only three who were actually pretty cool were the three faerie girls. They weren't the same as the twin faeries from previous Mothra movies, and they weren't even 'twins'. Actually, they looked totally different, but that's ok. They wore cool costumes, carried most of the story, and even sang a song or two. And the evil faerie sister, trying to use Desghidorah for her own evil ways, was actually pretty cute, so that's always a plus.  It's otherwise mostly pretty boring, focusing on human's who don't really have much to say or do, other then run around, doing silly stuff.  They add very little to the movie itself, but the villainess Belvira proves to be the most interesting and entertaining of the lot.

The special effects had its ups and downs. There were a few really great looking scenes, and Desghidorah (which was pretty much like a black King Ghidorah with four legs and trumpeting like an elephant) was pretty cool looking.  But that's about it.

Mothra looked pretty cool herself in a few scenes, too. There was the usual caterpillar version crawling around for a little bit which looked the same as always, if not a little worse then in older movies. I don't really want to give it away, but the underwater Mothra scene looked really good. The only problem is, there can't be the same kind of action that's in a Godzilla movie because Mothra just isn't as tough or limber as Big G and his typical foes. She can fly around and shoot stuff from almost everything that hangs off of her - including the patterns on her wings fer God's sake, but that's about it. This is pretty evident through most of the movie, when Mothra's getting beaten pretty badly. But there is one pretty cool scene near the end where it actually convinces you that Mothra CAN kick some ass.

Overall: It's a so-so kaiju, with a couple cool fight scenes. This film is great if you're a kid just getting familiarized with the Toho monsters.  Its good if you like these sorts of films, but its a must if you love that big, bad-ass, battling bug - Mosura!",1337472000,2,4077,4.48582995951417

1332057,3,B00003L9CE,"When the monsters were going at each other, fantastic, however, when you're forced to watch a tiny witch on a mechanical dragon cackling like her last egg was just laid, not so fantastic.  I love the original Mothra and the singing twins.  This update though, is a bit bizarre to grapple with as an adult.  It's too saccharine, there's too much slapstick, and the intrusion of the wicked sister Belvera makes it just plain silly.  The scenes without Belvera are tolerable, the fact that she abruptly disappears sometime during the second feature is very revealing.  She's just a plot device, the last best thing serving as a villain in the piece.  As far as I'm concerned, both movies would work just fine without her (apparently, she also shows up in Rebirth of Mothra III, so someone must have thought she was crucial to the trilogy).  I'm surprised that the third movie has yet to be released.
The craftsmanship wasn't as good in the second feature as the first; I could clearly see the wires the monsters were hanging from in several scenes.  The second feature was a bit like The Goonies, but in a good way.  Loved the look of Dagahra, I thought he made an exceptional adversary.  I could have done without the ecological lecture at the end of both movies.  The point was established throughout both films, repeating it at the end, like a commercial, was totally unnecessary.

Not my favorites but I'm keeping them for my collection anyway.",1313971200,,1445,4.713147410358566

In my opinion, the 1st movie's story line is much stronger than the second one. The second movie seems to focus a lot more on the kids and not nearly enough on the monsters. The second movie seems like it's more targeted for kids than adults. Plus, I didn't really like the ending that much to be honest. The quality of the movies is pretty great. I did notice a little grain or scratches or whatever during some parts, but I think that's to be expected right?",1310342400,,607,4.196581196581197

1332061,4,B00003L9CE,"""Mothra"" is still tons of fun to watch no matter what your age.

My daughter and I spent yesterday afternoon re-watching this double feature (when will Part 3 hit DVD here in the US??) and had a blast.

""Rebirth of Mothra"" features a great environmental message when a land developer mistakenly unlocks the stone prison of Desghidorah, a giant 3-headed dragon who will drain the life-force from the earth itself. Only an aging Mothra can stop Desghidorah from destroying the world.

""Rebirth of Mothra 2"" features the ""new"" Mothra introduced in the first film, and once again she is Earth's protector. Pollution in the ocean has awoken an ancient monster known as Dagahra. In order to combat the pollution Dagahra releases thousand of pollution eating, but poisonous Star Fish that attack everything in the sea. Only Mothra can stop Dagahra from destorying the world's oceans.

Both films feature the miniature ""fairies"" Mothra fans are familiar with, including a new villainous ""fairy"" known as Belvera. Both movies feature fantastic soundtracks, and great special effects. Mothra looks colorful and fantastic, my daughter loved seeing all of the transformations in both films.

I enjoyed the first film quite a bit. The story and Desghidorah made for a pretty entertaining film, the special effects looked great as well. The Second film was a bit weaker storywise, but the impressive special effects are definately worth a viewing. Overall fans of Mothra will enjoy this double feature.",1291248000,2,1488,5.157676348547718

But it's a fun type of cheese factor to sit down and watch this movie with your kid (who in my case happens to love Godzilla-type movies and to whom Mothra is a definite favorite!).  Plus this brings back memories of watching these types of shows as a kid myself.  We own most of the old Godzilla movies (as well as a few of the other kaiju movies as well) and enjoy watching them together.

These Mothra movies are not as good as a few of the other Godzilla titles in my opinion, but they are a very fun watch.",1274659200,,526,4.077669902912621
1332063,5,B00003L9CE,"These videos are some of the few kid-oriented monster movies, taking all the hustle and bustle from an ordinary monster movie and toning it down with a more gentle and dramatic touch.

In the first film, Rebirth of Mothra, a logging crew in Hokiado unwittingly removes the magical Seal of Elias from the forest.  They release Desgidorah, a wicked space monster, from its prison.  Mothra is summoned by her fairy guardians and engages the cosmic dragon.  Her newlyborn larva comes to assist and the two fight the beast.  Eventually Mothra's age and battle wounds seal her fate and she sinks into the pacific ocean.  Her determined youngster retreats to a nearby island and cocoons himself(herself?) into a full moth.  Will it be enough to defeat Desgidorah?

The second film, Rebirth of Mothra II, is not as strong as the first but it is still dazzling.  A young girl discovers a little furry creature called Gorgo, the guardian of a great treasure from a lost, underwater city.  Meanwhile the evil beast Daghara produces mutant starfish that threaten to overrun the worlds oceans.  Mothra is summoned to battle the creature, but is infected with the starfish and takes a beating.  The girl and two of her friends find themselves in a floating pyramid in search of the treasure, with two money-obsessed goons following them.  Can Mothra defeat Daghara and the kids find the treasure before it's too late?

The effects are cheesy even by 1990s standards, but they're creative and entertaining.  The movies are good stories with positive enviromental messages.  The fairies for the first time are seperate with individual personalities, and a third, evil fairy makes her debut in this series.  The only real downside is that the english dub doesn't quite match the actors but otherwise they're gold.  If you don't like them, the kids certainly will.",1220745600,,1846,4.957654723127036

1332066,5,B00003L9CE,"One of the first things that people will say about these movies is that thy're just for kids. BIG FLIPPING DEAL!!! who CARES if the stars of the movies are kids? The movies are fun and the only two problems with the movies are: there's 'a save the trees' and 'stop putting trash into the ocean' message, which really I think is pointless. the other problem? bad voices, the voices for these characters are TERRIBLE! but, if you're a Godzilla fan, you get over that.

Rebirth of Mothra: The story begins with Mothra sitting in her island cave, old and weak, then the scene switches to the Hokkaido rain forest where a logging company is taking down trees. while making rounds, a bulldozer hits a weird kind of relic and the boss comes down to investigate. the boss takes off a tiny seal (which you find out is the seal of elias) thus the two elias, Mona and Laura, whose ancestors made the seal, go to the family whose daughter was given the seal by her dad. but she's being controlled by the rouge elias, Belvera. a quick battle ensues and Belvera gets away. the seal was made to keep a giant space monster, whose name is Desghidorah coming out. Desghidorah first landed on Mars, thus the reason it's a wasteland. of course it gets out again, and being controlled by Belvera, starts sucking the life out of the earth, like before. Mona asks Laura for help to summon Mothra, but Laura pleeads, saying mothra's too old and even weaker after giving birth. but they summon Mothra and the two monsters fight. after a moments confusion, Desghidorah gains the upper hand severely hurts Mothra sensing it's mother's distress, the egg begins to hatch prematurely. and out from the egg comes Mothraleo, the only male Mothra. it goes to Hokkaido and tries to help it's mother which it does in a way. the family, which is seeing this happen in front of them is able to get out of the valley after rescuing their father. Desghidorah accidentally blasts a dam, letting Mothra grab her son and gets away to the ocean. Mothra's strength fails her and she's no longer able to stay in the air. Mothraleo, tries to get his mother up, but fails, and so Mothra dies, falling to the bottom of the ocean. (if you have younger kids, say 4-9, chances are, they'll cry during mothra's death) the baby goes off to an island down south and transforms into it's imago form, taking power from the 10,000 year old tree which it used for it's cocoon. it goes to fight agaianst Desghidorah, who now has wings, it suceeds and the elias seal up Desghidorah and you find out that Belvera is really Mona and Laura's sister. Mothraleo heals the Hokkaido rian forest which has been burnt up by Desghidorah and goes back home to it's island, healing Hokkaido.

Rebirth of mothra 2: although this movie has better special effects, the story is weaker and Daghara is not as evil. one of the funniest lines in the whole movie has got to be when one of the kids exclaims: ""Ew, this thing peed on my leg!""

This time around, you've got a couple of kids who are even more annoying than usual.  And a weird witch on a flying bug.  It plays like a bastardized version of the Goonies, or some other 80's era Spielberg film he'd like us all to forget.

If you're not a kaiju fan, or if you detest your kaiju movies being kid-centric, then you could easily skip the third entry in this series but you're going to be sorely disappointed regarding the kiddie focal point.  Both movies are long on lots of spfx, bright colors, and zappy rays and magical powers.  This was done, after all, by the same teams that brought us the 1990s Heisei Godzilla movies where they never found a brightly colored energy effect they didn't love.  Read on, kaiju fan.

Rebirth of Mothra: The first in the series is the best.  This movie is highlighted by an actual touching death scene as the imago stage of Mothra sacrifices itself for its child and sinks slowly beneath crystal blue Pacific waters.  We are introduced to not only the new Elias twins but also to their evil, glum sister Belvera, in a cacophonous brouhaha between the sides of good and evil inside a brother and sisters house that trashes the living room, play area, and kitchen.  Belvera is chased off and the kids come under the Elias protection, and fairy Mothras, by extension.  The kids dad is a construction owner whose company has broken an ancient seal up in the mountains of Japan that leads to the resurrection and resurgence of the monstrous Death Ghidorah.  Death Ghidorah resembles its King cousin in its three serpentine dragon heads but is different in its red hide hue, stocky Brontosaurus body, and ability to sprout wings once its gathered enough earth essence energies.  The plentiful battles between the larval and imago Mothra stages all take place in the burning mountains and highland lakes and I don't recall the creature ever reaching civilization, but Death Ghidorah (sounds like Desughidora) looks good if not a bit stiff.  He sure gives Mothra a run for the money.  By movies end the kids, who were separated from their parents in the burning mountains, are reunited and Mothra magically undoes the destruction to the earth that his battles with Death Ghidorah caused.  The effects in this movie are tamer but tighter than the second feature and are, on the whole, very satisfying.  The future iterations used even more effects but more cheaply and far less satisfyingly.  I give this first entry a solid 4 stars that even old-school G fans (adults) can enjoy for the most part.

Rebirth of Mothra II: The second feature takes a page out of Godzillas Revenge when it utilizes a couple of bumbling young adults who fall under Belveras influence and help her terrorize the kids who star prominently in this film.  Theres a little girl on an island who comes across an oversized Furby who can heal wounds by peeing on them (yesyes, you read that correctly) and who has a couple of peer-aged boys befriend her on an adventure though those boys started off by bullying her.  They play catch with the magical Furby as an ecological disaster of mutant starfish start cropping up everywhere and attack people with acidic rapaciousness.  The kids are befriended by the Elias and fairy Mothra and go on a fantastical adventure that leads them to an Atlantis-like pyramid structure out in the ocean.  This magical monolith is impossibly huge inside and holds within its tomb traps and tricks aplenty.  Think of an Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade or even Alien Versus Predator for a type of reference.  The main monster baddie is an extremely unique aquatic creation with an hippopotamus type head named Dagahra (sounds like Dagarla).  Dagahra expels the slimy red starfish en masse and has a variety of energy powers.  He is an extremely bulky underwater dragon whose design is not pleasant and we never get a really good sustained head-to-toe look of this bad beastie.  He fails to convey the menace he needs to convey and ends up being one of my least favorite kaiju in both design and execution.  His toxic energy does put a wallop of the mythic mothra and puts the bug on the ropes before the kids use the magical furby to help save the day and Mothra, always developing new and ridiculously fantastical powers (just what the script calls for), transforms into a sleek aquatic version who can seemingly travel in supersonic speedy fashion underwater and split into a million smaller versions of itself to take out the hybrid starfish and ultimately blow up Dagahra.  This movie feels like an everything and the kitchen sink type of film.  It can be entertaining, but it is busy, though never lacking in rich color and abundant spfx.  In the end its almost too much but along the way its a magical adventure.  This entry rates 3.25 stars.",1445040000,,4752,4.758536585365854
