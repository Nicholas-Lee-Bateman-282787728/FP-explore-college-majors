8184096,5,6305245401,"Just when I thought I was out... they pull me back in. I was already hooked on Pedro Infante, then suddenly Saritsima! This all just started as a way to help me with my Spanish comprehension...now it's an addiction. I did gather that Sarita wasn't Mexican, so maybe I'm picking up something about the language.",1275177600,,310,4.654545454545454

In my opinion this is the film that makes all the others of the Golden Era wannabes. (note: the Laguna Films DVD that I have, the one pictured here, does not have subtitles) ""Bad hombres on horses- it's real exciting!"" -Piporro",1235260800,3,404,4.955882352941177
8184098,5,6305245401,"Wonderful! This first team-up of La Montiel and Mexico's beloved Pedro Infante was great. It sparkles! They set fire, better saying. They both argue, love and sing. And we watch and laugh!
One of Sara's first singing appearences on the Mexican screen. There are at least three great songs sung by Sarita Montiel (as the gypsy Carmen Linares) worth to pay attention: ""Cancion del ole"", ""Copla en la noche"" and ""Para el carro"". These are not only curious but  true documents, as fans must know. Pay attention to her soprano-somewhat-alike and yet not so tuned voice. Still far from the bass velvety one we're used to. Infante sings ""Cuando el destino"", ""Copa tras copa"" and the extremely amusing ""Carta a Eufemia"". Jose Alfredo Jimenez gives us a true gem, his huge hit ""Paloma Querida"" (recently 'rediscovered' by Luis Miguel - give a listen to his last release ""Mexico En La Piel"" - and buy it too!) and ""El Corrido de Martin Corona""(Mero Norte) - also a very good song. He was a great singer, no doubt.
The storyline is very similar to most American western films from the period. Here it goes: Martin Corona (Infante) and his sidekick ""Piporro"" are local heroes (Zorro and Tonto?) that help the poor, the unfortunate and women in need (and those, by the way, use to ""love"" Corona's helping hand, except for one: Carmen Linares/Rosario Medina - double character - performed in a comic way by Sarita who was not so often into comedy business but should have done more. She's funny. Much more than many of the so called comedy line actors (see boring Bill Murray, over-patience-limit Jim Carrey, not-funny-at-all Lily Tomlin and many others...
There is action, singing and romance and whatsoever it takes to please the fans of the gender. It's a pity that films like this don't receive better advertising from their distributors. There is always a new audience to watch them, for sure. They're hard to find items, even at Amazon. ""Ahi Viene Martin Corona"" has a sequel, ""El Enamorado"" (""Vuelve Martin Corona""), also very amusing.
To sum up, this sort of film is great entertainment. The family type. This should be encouraged to younger viewers in place of all the pornographic and violent material they're frequently subdued and used to.
More films with Sara Montiel - the European ones - should be added to the shelves of Amazon.com They're not easy to get and are very expensive for us to buy from El Corte Ingles, for example. Bring them, please!
Thanks God almost all her Soundtracks are available here!
Buy this movie and his sequel and if you like them and beg for more, as I did. And don't forget to purchase also ""Necesito Dinero"" that gathers Montiel and Infante for the third time.
 Martin Corona is surely a true collector's item. Worth the money. HAVE FUN!",1108771200,9,2768,4.776617954070981
