4597307,5,B0057O6IJG,I can't get enough of this show even if it were just lala and rito id have been fine but a pleasantly diverse cast made this show a lot of fun and although the storyline isn't great it isn't terrible either....all in all its a worthy buy,1347321600,3,237,4.0638297872340425

At a glance,

What it gets right:
-Comedy
-Fan service
-Premise

What it gets wrong:
-Story
-Fan service
-Protagonist

The show is a harem anime in nature.  Rito, the protagonist has a bad case of The Pathetic even by harem anime standards.  Regardless, he is surrounded by gorgeous gals that throw themselves at him in both reality and fantasy.  The show is heavy on fan service; it shows a lot of skin, the occasional nip-slip, and lots of sexual situations.  The fan service ends up being a double edged sword as the writers seem to use it as a crutch.  The story ends up falling flat, relying on forced awkwardness and cringe dramedy that can last for entire episodes.  It doesn't entertain, nor does it really add much that isn't already written on the back of the box.  When the show isn't trying to deliver a serious story, the comedy is absolutely hilarious.  The show has a lot of great jokes and silly situations to entertain as well.

Overall:
There are points where the show really does shine.  In the end, it finds itself in the awkward position where it is too risque for a kid, but the writing isn't strong enough for an adult.  If you are an adult, you could skip to the much better second season, which leaves behind the forced drama and other foibles and keeps the hilarity and fan service.",1338163200,2,1335,4.527196652719665
4597309,1,B0057O6IJG,"this rating is for the packaging only. It seems that the guys at sentai really don't care about packaging, because this is the second anime that i see like this, the other been princess resurrection. I wouldn't of minded paying a little bit more if they were blue-ray and they came like this, but since they are DVDs they will scratch really easy. Again, this review is for the packaging, the anime itself is great.  P.S. if you buy this anime, also buy a piece of cloth, (the kind for cleaning glasses). If you cut the cloth and place it between the discs, they won't scratch if you keep them in the box it came with.",1331769600,9,618,4.327586206896552
4597310,4,B0057O6IJG,"Perhaps a little defense of ""Trouble"" is needed... There is nothing earth shattering with this anime, but it is amusing, if you let it be so. Lots of anime tropes, certainly. Too-well-endowed flaky alien fiance by accident? Check. Previous love interest [much more normal] that has been pining for the protagonist without letting him know? Check. Put-upon protagonist who is brash but shy, heroic when he's not thinking about it, but clueless sometimes, who was pining for aformentioned good girl, and was just about to say something when the alien shows up... then chaos. Check.

I think what sets this apart, is a surprising amount of heart... It's a harem anime, but it twists that trope a bit by making the lead more capable, by giving him an inner dialog. The flaky alien girl is not quite as flaky, but thinks differently, as one might expect an alien to do. What, an alien who thinks differently? How about a BUNCH of aliens who think differently? What about a guy who's a fish out of water on his own planet?

Certainly you could look at this as just more losely held together anime tropes that are nothing new. I think this does much better than other harem shows, explores more territory than they do, and comes to a decent end while allowing the story to go on.

Technically the animation is good, character designs are pleasing, and the music works pretty well. The opener is a favorite, and especially the second closer is very good. There is quite a bit of nudity, and fan service, though obviously it's still a TV show. At least you should know that the alien girl is kinda averse to weraing clothes, and there are plenty of complications to that.

If you hate harem comedies, ecchi and anime tropes, even if they've been amusingly twisted, You should know better really. You know the pattern that this fits. If you are neutral to harems [in this case there is more to it anyway] or you like them, I'd recommend it. At the least, you should preview to see if you like it, it's a cut or two above most harem anime out there. It stands up to repeated watching.",1315353600,31,2073,4.564516129032258
4597311,1,B0057O6IJG,"Your average series is an ecchi series, which means perverted. This series is perverted, but that usually doesn't bring a anime down, since ecchi is a cliche genre of the '00s.

In this series I've seen absolutely nothing original. Everything is cliche. Many of the cliche elements are even repeated throughout the series. You see tenticle rape 3-4 times in this series. Tenticle rape at least once is unavoidable in an ecchi series, but repeated is unacceptable.
All the characters fit common anime cliches. Loli Characters, powerful characters, weak minded male lead, cutesy creatures, memory loss endings, lack of plot, love harems, hot school nurses, hot spring episodes, sex and mainly more. This series has absolutely no appeal to it at all. The best episodes are the first 3, and the last 2. Other than that there is no point watching this series.",1312156800,,854,4.972027972027972
4597332,5,B0057O6IJG,"I have enjoyed the entire series. If you are into a good deal of fan service, then this series is for you, if not then stay away. Each separate series seems to concentrate on a different set of characters which allows for the characters to grow from episode to another. Rito is constantly being exposed to Lala's inventions which invariably gets him into hot water of some sort. All I can say is, try not to listen to others, if you are thinking about it, you can always watch the series on varied streaming venues. That will give you a chance to preview each episode instead of having to purchase something that you may later regret. Have fun !!!!!",1453680000,,649,4.46218487394958
4597333,1,B0057O6IJG,"As many have already stated, To Love Ru is a quite average harem anime where the main character is an average boy who for whatever reasons (usually just awesome good luck) gets surrounded and proposed by beautiful girls full of great qualities. Here that's Yuuki Rito.

Rito lacks any talent, a feature of real life; yet he has courage to protect a girl in danger, quite unusual treat in real life.  After dozens of episodes Rito still keeps getting scandalized when running into naked girls everywhere, next he yells and scolds at them. Somehow all girls still love him, remain cheerful and regard him as nice. This scenario is quite opposite to real life. What is akin to real life is that many boys make girls feel guilty or uncomfortable with their own bodies, and at the same time most boys still want to see naked and happy pretty girls.

 Rito`s niceness is the lowest of the lowest.  The fact that there are so many guys who find this scenario as comic and never ever get enough of this speaks really low of the male gender. Culture and nationalities are irrelevant here.

One day you may feel guilty of having such taste and deny your times as an anime fan. Don`t blame anime because it is huge and still has plenty of redeeming cases. For starters try The Wallflower.",1450656000,,1277,4.554585152838428

4597378,5,B0057O6IJG,This series is a throw back to the classic tenchi series but in my opinion they took tenchi and made it even better with the clumsy Yuki Rito constantly landing face first in over the top scenarios and plenty of fan service.,1391299200,,224,4.357142857142857

4597382,4,B0057O6IJG,I love this anime can't wait for the fourth season. So one problem i had with this dvd set was: THE DVDS ARE ALL ON TOP OF EACH OTHER! I don't get why in the world would they put the dvds on top of each other so they could get scratched this really bothered me you think they would have done something different with the packaging of this. I ended up getting some cloth to put in between all of them so they don't end up getting scratched.,1376438400,,439,4.0

4597395,4,B0057O6IJG,"Overall, I absolutely love this series. It's a great 26 episodes. The product features textless openings and endings for the Anime. It has English subtitles, no English Dubs. Only Japanese. Cover art is great.

The case itself becomes the problem. There are four discs in the case, but they all are in one base, one on top of the other. That's why I give the product 4/5 Stars.

Other than that, I really do love this product.",1366502400,,426,4.51948051948052
4597396,5,B0057O6IJG,Great storyline alomg with comity linked to a high school kids life.  Only con is it only ran for 26 episodes but it was all well written out.,1362355200,,142,4.071428571428571
4597397,5,B0057O6IJG,This is fanfare and harem comedy at its best.  No dark plots are sinister themes.  Just a shy guy trying to figure out the path of complicated love with 2 women unknowingly captures the attention of so many others.  Average in all aspects excepts in his treatment towards them to make them feel like they are being heard.  On par with Mayo Chicki and Girls Bravo.,1361404800,,363,4.454545454545454
4597398,4,B0057O6IJG,"Rito Yuuki is a normal high school fella with a normal high school crush on a girl name Haruna Sairenji. He has loved her for a long time, but cannot find the courage to admit it. One day, an alien Princess named Lala. By accidentally grabbing her boobs, and confessing his love to her by accident instead of Haruna, Rito has become the Royal Son-In-Law. Now the only way he can get out of his engagement to Lala is by dying. He is torn between staying alive and living a lie, or confessing that the one he truly loves is Haruna. But over time, he finds himself become quite fond of the incredibly sexy, and bubbly Princess Lala. Now he is more confused than ever. Who will he choose?

This anime is not original at all. It is like all the other harem anime series out there. But it's a tried and true formula that continues to entertain. To Love Ru has lots of great characters, very good animation, a great soundtrack, tons of action, comedy, drama, and romance. It's a stacked series. not to mention that there are naked chicks all over the place. My only complaint is that it's not in English. The Japanese is very good, but my enjoyment of a series is cut in half if I have to read subtitles instead of sitting back and relaxing. I don't like giving my undivided attention to the bottom of the screen while I'm trying to enjoy a silly TV show. That's my only issue with this series.

Overall, To Love Ru is another great anime put out by Sentai. I'm glad that I gave it a chance. I think that fans of the harem  anime genre will enjoy it as well. As I said before, there is nudity in almost every episode, so it's not for youngsters. It's also only in Japanese, so be prepared to read subtitles for 10 hours. If those things don't bother you, I think that you'll be happy with this lively series.",1359763200,8,1801,4.291176470588235
4597399,5,B0057O6IJG,"This is my favorite ecchi comedy because all the characters are lovable, especially Lala with her malfunctioning inventions and Haruna with her cute and bashful personality, also Yami is one of my favorite characters in all the anime I've seen. I would definitely recommend this series for anyone that likes a good story line that also strays off at times for some comical side stories.",1357084800,,386,4.953846153846154
4597400,5,B0057O6IJG,"Hilarious, over the top antics make this a must see of Harem anime fans. Though the manga is better only in the sense that it continues the story, which is to say that the anime is very well done.",1353369600,,196,4.051282051282051

Now, the package it comes in. Christ!

1st) The thickness of the box is as if they combined two regular sized DVD cases. The good thing is that it's hard enough to protect from external smashing to a degree.

2nd) There is nothing inside of it except the 4 DVDs & a hard foam buffer.

3rd) The DVDs themselves are all stacked on top of each other, on one side with NOTHING in between. I nearly broke one DVD by trying to take it out of the case. This type of packaging is dangerous because you can easily damage the each disc.",1349740800,9,630,4.016

Oh, BTW..... all other reviews for this are for To Love RU which is a harem comedy which this show is nowhere near being a comedy !!
They say the town is cursed and ritualistic killings happen every year around the towns carnival celebration, some horribly killed and some just disappeared and that happens every year with the whole town not showing any concern.
This is done in separate story lines, when the story line ends, the town resets back to the beginning and starts another story line but not the same story, this repeats till end of season 1 when someone notices this is happens. This is strongly not for young children due to graphic and psychological content but us older folks , pretty darn creepy. :)
People are being killed in this show in the most horrible ways in each story aspect, some by the town folk, some by a cult, and some by the children!!!",1513036800,2,1013,4.510869565217392
