7796733,5,0767012100,"An old and well-liked spinster, Miss Emily Simpson, is found dead in her cottage, apparently fallen from stairs, after witnessing something eerie in a wood. Her old friend Lucy Bellringer is unconviced and asks Barnaby to inspect in the case. Further enquiries show there are many long-buried secrets in the town, and then Dennis Rainbird, undertaker and his mother are found massacred to death with a knife in their house.
I particularly enjoyed this episode, because the setting is beautiful and the actors are particularly good (Rene&egrave; Asherson as Emily Simpson and Rosalie Crutchley as Lucy Bellringer)",1103155200,3,612,5.319587628865979
