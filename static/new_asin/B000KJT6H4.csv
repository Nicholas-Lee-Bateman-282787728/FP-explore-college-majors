Pretty easy navigating through the chapters, and actually seeing the corrections has been even more helpful.  Glad I made this purchase!",1391385600,,315,4.709090909090909

This helped me fundamentally understand knitting better, so that I read patterns better, and I read my work better.  This is not the intention of the DVD, but a by-product of the well done explanations of how to correct mistakes.  You will knit with less fear.  This is good for beginners as well.  And might I add, I find this video very soothing and relaxing.  Lori is very pleasant and easy to watch - this is not an annoying overly perky demonstrator, or an anal uptight knitter.  Lori is just right!!",1259884800,4,636,4.7272727272727275
8157648,5,B000KJT6H4,"I really liked this DVD. I have knitted for a while very simple things. I avoided more complex projects for lack of knowledge of techniques, and how to correct mistakes. This DVD is easy to understand, and a picture is worth a thousand words. I would highly reccomend this DVD to any knitter as a part of their  Must Have Knitting DVD collection.",1182902400,9,346,4.492063492063492
