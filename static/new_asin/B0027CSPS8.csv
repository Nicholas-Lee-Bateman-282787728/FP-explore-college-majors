3864345,1,B0027CSPS8,It's completely ridiculous to cost as much as it does considering the current economic environment.  I'm sure it may be nice to own for collectors and they should have a right to own it.  Maybe the timing is bad or I simply want it and refuse to pay that amount.  I just feel it takes away from an awesome and creative show.,1259712000,5,324,4.193548387096774
3864346,5,B0027CSPS8,"i'm not one who always buy the deluxe or special editions of movies, tv shows and music but after years of being addicted to lost we finally have something fun to show off. maybe this could be a hint that the di will not be a big part of season six so they are giving them their send-off proper.

i can't believe it took them five seasons to come out with something special for obsessed fans like myself and look forward to confusing friends when i pop in a vhs to watch some lost.",1249948800,15,481,4.117021276595745

3864355,2,B0027CSPS8,"I got this item as a gift for my wife. As an avid vintage toy and film memorabilia collector, I've learned to spot re seal jobs on packaging quite quickly, and this is yet another example of dirty pool. Inside a certain handful of each of these is supposed to be an exclusive submarine patch, and low and behold, greedy sellers and distributors have yet again, figured out how to rip off the average hard working person and remove the fun from an otherwise really neat idea, for the sake of making more $$$. Here's what went down: the box set I ordered was described as ""Factory Shrink Wrap Sealed"". LOL, it was ""sealed"" alright, but the cardboard piece of paper that holds the set shut UNDER the shrink wrap was torn, with NO damage to the surrounding outer shrink wrap directly above it. In other words, the set had been RE sealed. When my wife removed the shrink wrap, we also noticed that the cardboard strip had little gelatin stickies under it, holding it down. Those stickies had been pulled up (as evidenced by old paper pulled and torn beneath them), then RE stuck down...obviously to get into the set before re sealing it aftermarket, and advertising it as ""factory sealed."" Now why would someone do this? Simple, to check for the exclusive Submarine Patch, and if it was in there, get the patch out of it and then re sell the set sans patch to the little guy (i.e., me) who would normally be none the wiser. I have a gut feeling a LOT of sellers on Amazon and elsewhere, advertising ""Factory Sealed"" sets have done this dirty little trick, and it really burned me up seeing this when I received the set. Realizing the chances though of receiving a REAL, unopened, factory untouched set via re order, or going to a different seller in hopes they were more honest to get one and ergo...a REAL chance at getting the patch, seemed a bit futile in retrospect. The creators of this set thought it would be a neat idea to make the patch exclusive. Well, it's a great idea, until greedy sellers and distributors figure out dishonest and frankly, illegal ways of cheating the system. Little do the end recipients like you or I often know, that they never stood a chance in getting the patch at all. And that's how these sorts of things go un reported, and un checked. When one can re sell the patches boldly advertised to collectors in with opened sets on sites like Ebay and Amazon for $200+ dollars EACH, it's a recipe for dishonest practices. This purchase taught me a lesson to NEVER again order products like this (those advertising a sealed, ""limited to certain random sets only"" premium). From here out, I will be purchasing items like this from Costco or Target, live, sight seen, straight off the shelf, and in person.",1320364800,5,2729,4.548780487804878

3864360,4,B0027CSPS8,"This is defintly a product for the hardcore fans of LOST only, any casual fan would probably feel cheated. It is a fun little kit though. The pamplets are fun to read, the orientation tape is pretty cool, and of course (if you can bring yourself to) the cool dharma patches can be added to whatever clothing you choose. You shouldn't expect anything that will solve some of the show's mysteries though. Even though the confindential folder does have some interesting info, this set really is just a fake DHARMA Orientation Kit and you shouldn't be expecting anything more.
I can't give this product a full 5 stars though for two reasons. 1)The submarine patch should have been included with all the kits. If you're going to charge $100+ for a fan only product, then why have something that is only going to be included with a few of them? 2)The pages that hold the DVDs and CD broke off during shipping so now they're just loose in the folder. They should have made something stronger to keep that stuff more secure.

If your a big fan of the show and can't get enough of LOST stuff, then you should defintly get this. If you just like watching the show then you're better off just buying the regular Season 5 DVD set.",1266883200,7,1218,4.486486486486487

3864373,5,B0027CSPS8,"I have been a Lost fan since the beginning. Season 5 was the best! This season 5 is very unique because of the Dharma Initiative box.

3864374,5,B0027CSPS8,"My wife and I are huge fans of this show. If you are a casual fan or merely inquisitive in finding out what this polar-bear-having, island-hopping, character-redeeming show is all about, shell out your hard-earned cash for the basic Blu-ray or standard DVD box set.

However, if you love all that is LOST, this is a nice set to display your passion. The packaging is clever. A water-stained box (it only looks that way, it isn't actually damaged) houses several pamphlets, welcome guides, and a Dharma orientation VHS tape complementing the castaways' integration into the Dharma organization this season. The attention to detail is evident, right down to the DVD sleeves looking like floppy discs. But if you're looking for answers to the many(!) mysteries in this package, most of the items can be seen as gimicky rather than revealing. The highlight is a draft of the peace treaty between the Others and Richard Alpert's original island dwellers.

The season itself is a departure from previous seasons, where a shift to it's sci-fi tendencies come to fruition. Time travel predominates the season, but never compromises on character depth or story telling. I've always found the show to be a character drama with a science fiction proponent. Never the other way around.

All in all, this product is a fine presentation of a captivating show, with a captivating season.",1265328000,4,1372,5.008771929824562

3864378,2,B0027CSPS8,"I have to say I'm disappointed with this collection.  When I first saw the dvd was coming out, I saw the original ""Complete 5th Season"" and this one (also saw the blu-ray, but I don't own those yet).  So, I was very excited and immediately told my husband I wanted THIS ONE for Christmas.  I got it, immediately opened it and finally got around to really looking at it and watching it a few days later.  Here are some issues I have:

*I think it is ridiculous that the kit ""MAY"" include the ""Exclusive Submarine Patch.""  I only see the die hard fans getting this kit and it's a little disappointing that only a select few get the ""exclusive"" version.  I would have liked to see more patches anyways...the medical patch, the motor pool, and the dharma stations for example.

*The size is crazy!  I had no idea when I looked at the picture that it was coming in a 3-ring binder!  This definitely does not fit on my shelf with the other seasons.

*False advertising of what is on the discs.  When you read the description it says it includes, ""A Day with Josh Halloway"" and ""Time Frame and Continuity.""  They do have a day with Richard Alpert on the disc, but not Sawyer (Halloway).  Also...I cannot find a time frame and continuity anywhere!  Some people have said that it IS on the blu-ray edition however....

*After deciding I wanted this version and getting it, I learned there was another special edition...<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost-The-Complete-Fifth-Season-Collector-s-Edition-with-Bonus-Disc-and-DHARMA-Luggage-Tag/dp/B00309YBIA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost: The Complete Fifth Season (Collector's Edition with Bonus Disc and DHARMA Luggage Tag)</a>
This one seems to have all of the video from the Dharma Kit (Dharma Kit is 731min. long), plus more.  The Collector's Edition is 751min. long!  While it was cool to see the maps and orientation guides, I would have much rather seen the ""over 20 minutes of never-before-seen footage!""

*It also appears the regular edition of the 5th Season has all the same video as the Limited Edition (Both are 731min).  VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!  That is, minus the 5min VHS of the Dharma Orientation video you get with the kit.

So, unless you want this edition just so you can have the ""pretty version"" I would save your money and just buy the regular season.  OR, just purchase the Collector's Edition!",1261958400,2,2395,5.084615384615384
3864379,4,B0027CSPS8,"The only negative to this boxed set is you can get more ""bonus"" materials if you buy the Season 5 set that has the ""Dharma Initiative luggage tag."" That one comes with an entire additional DVD with what appears to be interesting background material on the show.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost-The-Complete-Fifth-Season-Collector-s-Edition-with-Bonus-Disc-and-DHARMA-Luggage-Tag/dp/B00309YBIA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost: The Complete Fifth Season (Collector's Edition with Bonus Disc and DHARMA Luggage Tag)</a>

This season has far fewer of the episodes with audio commentary; only two, in fact (though both are excellent). All the sets come with these as well as a few other bonus materials on Disk 5 (along with ""The Incident"" final episode.) Of these, only 1 is important for advancing the show - a faux episode of a 1980s TV program investigating the Dharma Initiative. You get this with all the sets.

This special set does have one valuable piece of material that does advance the story: a copy of the ""truce"" between the DI and the indiginous inhabitants of the island. You are missing a valuable bit of plot info if you don't have that item.

If you are REALLY into Lost you definitely have to buy this - I don't give a whit about the fifth patch - and also buy the set that has the bonus DVD and the luggage tag. That may seem extravagant; I was able to rationalize it because I needed to buy a separate set for one of the kids and I will watch their bonus materials DVD before they go back home after Christmas.",1261785600,3,1571,5.125
3864380,5,B0027CSPS8,As I read through these reviews I was kind of surprised by some of them. If you are a fan of the show I don't understand why you wouldn't love this. I don't think the price is bad for this what you get. I paid under 80 bucks and that including taxes and shipping. I like the packaging its fun and its got me pumped for the final season to start. I guess they could have done something more expensive and maybe used a hardwood case instead of the cardboard box that the folder comes.  And maybe they could have used the more traditional DVD holder case that houses all the DVD's together like they did for the past season's offering. I have to say I like the DVD holders in this set. I like how they look like old floppy discs from the early 80's. Sure they are made of paper but if they would have made the kit nicer it probably would have cost a lot more and I most likely wouldn't have been able to afford it. So I think it was nice that they offered up a nice collectable for under 80 buck. If you're not sure if you want this collectors edition all I can say is for me it is worth the money but you can still just get the normal season 5 DVD release if you disagree.,1260921600,,1170,4.0
3864381,1,B0027CSPS8,"This set is designed to steal the money of people who are dedicated to the show. Everything about the packaging amounts to the most cynical sort of explotation.

What do you get for all the money:

(1) A song thats been available on itunes for months.

(2) A VHS tape containing an amaturish reworked version of a orientation film already seen in the show. Why do I want to go find a VCR to watch something I've mostly already seen and which adds absolutely NOTHING to what was already seen. Its not important. Its not entertaining.

(3) A bunch of printed extras full of bad jokes and without any interesting content. There is only one exception. There is a truce document included that is the kind of content people want. But it requires that the packaging be damaged to look at it.

(4) A bunch of patches. And they cared *so much* that some packages have an extra patch (the submarine). When your down to putting bonus items in something this expensive, its just tacky.

(5) Its nonstandard size. It doesn't fit on shelves and it doesn't fit into most DVD collections.

I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who actually wanted to watch the season. This is strictly a rare collectors item that you never open and put somewhere for a few years in the hope that it increases in value. I mean given all the features (the damage-to-open packaging, the VHS tape, the submarine patch), thats the market this thing was really designed for.",1260576000,12,1434,4.6
3864392,4,B0027CSPS8,"Okay, I had a great time opening and exploring everything in this package.  But the extras don't add any information or solve any mysteries, and it's going to be a bit of a pain to store this gigantic box.  I like that the set is designed to resemble a Dharma orientation kit, but I agree with the reviewer who mentioned the very non-70s glossy brochures, which significantly lessen the authenticity of the ""Dharma recruit"" experience.  And I would have liked more (MANY more) cast photos; for instance, a shot of Hurley doling out Dharma chili would have been a great addition to the cafeteria brochure.

I'm not going to complain about the VCR tape, since I'm still languishing in the stone age with a DVD/VCR combo unit, and someone mentioned you can watch the content on YouTube.

I'm fairly bummed that my package didn't include the fifth patch. I have to wonder who thought it was a good idea to randomly reward some customers while depriving others who paid the same price.

All in all, this is a fun package and a serious LOST fan wouldn't want to miss it, but I would have been much more satisfied with the value (especially given the lack of the submarine patch) if the price had been about 33% lower.",1260576000,2,1211,4.557603686635945
3864393,3,B0027CSPS8,"ok...

im kinda torn on this purchase... i mean... i really like LOST... but... this set was a bit of a letdown.

first of all... i didn't get the sub patch... which i find to be completely ridiculous considering only the biggest of fans would buy this set to begin with... why wouldnt they just put the patch in every box?

secondly... the holes holding the bluray sleeve pages to the binder became ripped during shipping... so now i just have a couple of loose pages... pretty annoying...

and thirdly... this thing is MASSIVE... pictures don't really do it justice... i really had no idea it would be as big as it is... from all the pictures i saw before it came out, i just figured it was an oversized bluray case... its a FRIGGIN 3 RING BINDER!  where exactly am i supposed to put this thing?

I will say however that the outside box is actually really cool.  which sounds kinda stupid considering its basically just a cardboard box with ""fancy printing""

but anyway... the show is great and all... and its the only reason this set isn't rated any lower... i was just hoping this set would be better.",1260489600,6,1105,4.462686567164179
3864394,4,B0027CSPS8,"This is an amazing box set! One of the best box sets I have ever seen. Instead of a normal 'Special Edition' box set that my have one extra item. This comes with papers that makes you feel like you were actually just brought into the DHARMA initiative. It comes in a white 3 ring binder which automatically had me jumping. Everything inside makes you feel like you were about to start your new job. The DVD's themselves come in very nice plastic holders ,although, I don't know about their choice of paper covers instead of actual cardboard covers. One of mine were rather crinkled and bent (I might talk to amazon about exchanging it but I don't know yet). I am one of the crazed fans who refuses to open the back of the envelope so I can't say much about that.

My only concern and complaint is after spending all this money- they chose to have a patch be very specific to certain kits. I didn't get the patch but it bugged me to think that they would make it seem like we will run out and buy another kit and to think that those kits (because they were in short supply) will end up being worth more than the none extra patch kit bugs me too.

Like I said though, GET IT IF YOU ARE A LOST FAN! This made my day to open! I can't wait to see what they do to the sixth season, it will be hard to top this!",1260403200,10,1304,4.08984375

FIRST, MY PROBLEMS WITH THE SET

There's nothing of any real consequence. Now I can't deny, the Geronimo Jackson CD is nice and unexpectedly fun, but the song has been available on iTunes for months, and it offers little insight.

Unlike most, I dig and understand that they wanted retro with the VHS, even if a VHS isn't technically authentic to the time period. What bugs me, like most, is that given that it's truly the only thing about the set with real weight and value to the experience, being VHS is just truly inconvenient. The end result is that the major player of the whole line-up gets seriously shortchanged; it's a brief but fairly important and entertaining video, but what are the odds that you're going to dust off that beast of a machine (the VCR) for viewing this thing more than once.

Everything else, which again I DO love, is pretty much fluff. It's written materials and creative packaging with 2 or 3 inside jokes (Hurley's famous garlic mayo), but nothing lengthy enough that you're going to pour over it again later...

*hypothetical complaint--why make one of the patches unique to a select few sets? I'd be pissed if I didn't get it (the submarine patch) given the price premium. Having said that... I GOT IT, lol. But sadly, my co-worker did not, and is thus sad.

ENOUGH COMPLAINING, I LOVE IT!!

It's big, and impactful. You're basically getting a 3"" ring binder packaged in a cardboard box. This may be surprising, maybe even off-putting, but the outer sleeve is plain-as-day thick cardboard, albeit with fancy printing to mimic water stains and masking tape. Other than that, it's no different than moving boxes, and I think it's cool. It's easy to imagine they'd have these things stacked waiting for new recruits to grab them.

Inside is everything you need to know about life in Dharmaville. This is where the bonus stuff, while still admittedly just fluff, makes me geek out. You have the map of the barracks, some orientation materials, security protocols, etc., all packed in a firm, sturdy white binder with the Dharma logo emblazoned on the front. The most important piece in the binder though, would have to the confidential folder. Some are mad because yes, the folder is in fact sealed. To open it is to break the pull tab seal. Big whoop, that's what you bought it for. It does NOT damage your set, it's you enjoying your set. Besides, what's inside IS kinda cool, and though I know you can just search online, I'm not going to say here. It's nothing MAJOR, but still cool.

Some complain about the floppy sleeves for the discs. What the video doesn't show is that the sleeves, with discs inserted, then have their own lined binder pouches which, if the sleeves don't suit you, do a better job at cushioning and protecting the disc than a plastic tray. But I do think that the floppy sleeves go pretty hilariously far for the retro feel and are a welcome playful addition.

So, could we have done with more stuff? Absolutely. But then one has to ask, why now? I mean, especially since we're maybe only a year away from dropping an expected $250+ on a complete series set inside a package that looks like the top of the hatch (guessing, lol). Still, LOST has been there for me since my first semster in college, and now that I'm gradating just before season 6 starts, I had to indulge myself.",1260316800,9,3533,4.6293929712460065

at Amazon. The price here is not bad at all. Thank God For DVD's and NetFlix and Block Buster. As there is very little on TV now that is not Trash.
I will give it about two are three more years and I will not need Cable TV at all. Just my Nice TV set up and my DVD's...
And it really is to bad all the good shows are going off, and more trash is coming on...
Long live DVD's and the great OLd Shows.....",1260230400,,620,3.611940298507463
3864399,3,B0027CSPS8,"Okay, first off this is probably my favorite TV show of all time.  This review is not about the show, but the cruel packaging they have put their product in.

BE WARNED: It is IMPOSSIBLE to enjoy all the extra content without DESTROYING some of it.  Example: a sealed envelope that must be torn open in order to reveal the ""Letter of Truce"" between Richard Alpert and Horace Goodspeed (I've never been so pissed-off and excited at the same time).  If you want to know what it says without comprising the condition, I'm sure other fans will be posting it at some point (I myself couldn't wait).

Another complaint is that they're pulling the same crap the Cabbage Patch Kids did in the 80's (and so many others have followed with).  SOME packs include an extra 5th submarine patch.  Which in reality means a very few number of people will be making extra money off of [...], while the rest of us feel screwed.  There is also  Geronimo Jackson CD which cannot be removed from its too tight cardboard envelope without actually physically pinching and grabbing it and getting fingerprints on it (awesome artwork though).  Some people are upset over the VHS tape, but since I still have a VCR (just for such things), I bought the package for that purpose.

They have put the TWO security devices in a rather jerk-wad place, ruining the look of the binder (slapped inside, impossible to remove without damage).  The paper they used in their various recreations of DHARMA materials is very unauthentic to the period (a good example of the same attempt is the ""Gone With the Wind"" box set, which includes copies of original notes about production and was reproduced on similar paper weight/gloss/texture to the time-period).  No one made mimeograph copies on high-gloss, thick stock paper in the 70's.  That's just the graphic designer in me getting picky, but I know this does matter to a few folks.  Anyway, if they're going to make the set weak and purposely destructible, why not just use regular copy paper which would have looked more realistic?

SO, basically if you DO care about damaging your expensive collector's edition set of Lost Season five, DO NOT OPEN IT.  Leave it on the shelf to look pretty and collect dust.  If you DON'T care that you have to DESTROY some of the contents to enjoy it, then have fun!",1260144000,9,2313,4.683168316831683
3864400,1,B0027CSPS8,"I was at first excited to see a fifth season set which included an explanation for the show. I rarely was able to keep up with all the episodes of LOST, so for me it was much more like a jigsaw puzzle with half the pieces missing. I was excited to hear there would be an explanation that would explain, and tie everything together in the end, but I must say that I'm very disappointed that the studio decided to use a VHS tape to convey the show's ultimate explanation. Who has, or even wants a VHS VCR in this day and age of digital DVD's and BluRay? It's stupid and ridiculous, especially considering the $75.00 to $85.00 price tag. It now just seems like a very bad joke played out on the show's viewers. I'll be spending my money on something else this season, and the studio's can keep their stupid VHS tapes. Bah Humbug!!!!!",1260144000,4,830,4.326923076923077
3864401,2,B0027CSPS8,"I am getting the regular edition of this season, because the extras that you paying nearly $40.00 for is a vhs tape (who still has vcr's), some stickers and a a map, etc.., $10.00 maybe.",1259798400,2,186,4.3428571428571425
8354494,5,B0027CSPS8,"Man, it's been quite awhile since I thought about Lost. I watched every episode on first-run back in the 2000's and it was my favorite show for years. It did anger me off that after say Season Three some viewers tuned out, because I felt it got better and better as each season progressed. When they dropped the bomb that they went from flashbacks to flash forwards, I thought that was genius. Sure, even I would admit, that the last season of the ""what could have been"" scenarios was a tad of a stretch, but it fit with the wild twists of Lost's past. Overall, it was a great, groundbreaking show.

I bought each Season day one on DVD, even getting some of the exclusive discs with the dead-pan female narrator ""The Lost Story So Far"" specials that weren't normally on the set's special features. What blew me away about the presentation was always the menus that showed you an animated distant scene from one of the episodes on that disc, almost as if you were on the island from a distance spying on the castaways. To me, those were some of the best menus ever on the format, and there were so many to see. Disney/ABC really went all out for Lost's home video presentation, giving you great commentaries, documentaries, and a ton of easter eggs when most companies gave up on doing that. You always got your bang for your buck with each season, well worth it.

 When I went to the Blu-Ray format in the early '10's, the first thing on my wishlist was Lost. And slowly but surely I got all six seasons on Blu. While of course the picture was high-def and better, the overall presentation remained the same with the same animated menus and easter eggs all over the place (quick, name me three Blu-Rays with Easter Eggs, betcha can't!). And again, it was worth every penny, a great presentation on Blu as well.

 Looking forward, I believe it does deserve a 4K release, because honestly Lost can't survive in a syndicated televised format. When it did go into reruns on your local TV stations, it just didn't catch on because since each show is so connected to the other, you just can't casually watch it or afford to miss an episode. You get, well, Lost. I am happy with my Blu-Rays (though those ""specials"" should be on the regular special features section), but since they were released at the start of the format, the standard HD picture could look a bit better now, but yes, lets make it grand for the 4K at this point than re-releasing it on Blu.

 I do feel Lost has been a tad ignored because it doesn't work on TV reruns, and that's sad. It was so unique with incredible casts & storylines, that it shocks me that it was so popular only to be forgotten less than 10 years later. C'mon it was so loved that Entertainment Weekly was still doing front cover stories on it a year after it ended production (yeah, that is sorta sad)! Thanks for reminding me about this great show. I'm gonna go home and dig up my Blu Rays and start with that classic eye opening up till it finally closes for good.",1515542400,,3001,4.425724637681159

8354503,5,B0027CSPS8,"The episodes are there: even though Season 5 is probably one of Lost worst seasons (just behind Season 2), it beats the hell out of most of other shows' best seasons. A couple more episodes would have helped it feel less rushed, but it still delivers, and sets up just great the epic final season.

The special Dharma Initiative Orientation Kit is just perfect for any fan. Yeah, you might not have a lot of use for it, but you have everything you need as a ""new member of the Dharma Initiative"", including a neat VHS (not that easy to watch, though). The letters and 1977 feel is just awesome. Just if you had traveled in time, like Lost's heroes.",1383264000,,648,4.4
