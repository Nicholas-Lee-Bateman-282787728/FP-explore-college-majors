4070104,4,B0035CVB30,"Shout! Factory's release of ""Gamera, The Giant Monster"" is a vast improvement over the plethora of cheap, bootleg pan and scan American DVDs of this film that have plagued bargain bins for several years.  But, all things considered, the DVD itself is pretty standard in that it does what most other current DVDs do, such as including a commentary, a trailer, stills, and one featurette.  That's nothing new or out of the ordinary.  The only exception would be the attractive booklet that comes with the disc.

Regardless, the commentary is informative, the trailer and featurette are fun,the picture and audio are crisp, and the general American audience finally has the chance to see the wide-screen, uncut Japanese version of this film.

The movie itself is a pretty standard Japanese Giant Monster outing.  ""Gamera"" lacks focus because of its ensemble cast, Yamauchi's melodramatic music is at odds with the film, and the English speaking extras, as usual, aren't actors, and they're given a little too much screen time during the beginning of the film.  However, the special effects are (mostly) nice, Gamera is a cool monster, and the film managed to spawn a nice franchise.

If you're a fan of giant monsters, and Gamera in particular, order this, the most definitive Region 1 DVD of ""Gamera"" you'll probably ever find.",1277769600,2,1325,5.018264840182648
4070105,5,B0035CVB30,"The first Gamera film is a revelation.  I'm not just speaking of the DVD's gorgeous appearance.  This is the original, uncut Gamera film with Japanese language and subtitles.  For fans who saw the film on television, you don't know what you've been missing.  What's surprising is that I always thought that Gamera originally was just a s bad tempered beastie like Godzilla but much of what Gamera is including in the Kaneko films--all three highly recommended--was established in the first movie.

4070106,5,B0035CVB30,"I have seen this film several times over the course of my life (every time a dubbed version) and I always thought it was a little too cheezy for my taste.  But with birthday giftcard in hand I decided to give the Japanese version a try.  I am so glad that I did because it is almost a completely different film from the one I choked down as a child.

It is very dark in tone and is very tense from the very beginning.  We don't have to wait long to see the monster which is nice but the story itself seems to be less obvious.  I really appreciate the way they explain a giant turtle that lives on and breathes fire and flies (Atlantis...oops) even though I guess they really don't its just an assumption I gathered from having watched the Gamera films from the late 90's

Anyway I would only recomend this film for those who are avid kaiju fans as the casual observer would be bored to tears especially since the casual observer usually doesn't like to read their movies and has no patience unless there is a love scene or an explosion every five to ten minutes.",1276128000,,1062,4.258706467661692

The commentary track though informative sounds very low, at least on my player it does. There's a documentary with interviews of the original creators of Gamera, and a photo gallery. Now for the gripe. I WISH AMAZON WOULD HAVE THE COURTESY TO SEPARATE THEIR REVIEWS! Gamera: The Giant Monster and Gammera the Invincible are two different movies on two different DVDS distributed by two different dvd studios. Shout Factory for this. Alpha Video for the other. It's absolutely unfair that a person clicks on this product then sees the bad reviews that are meant for the other one and a sale is lost, or at least an unfair bad impression is made. I know some people take the time to discern, but others do not. So how 'bout it Amazon. How 'bout separating the reviews, after all I'm NOT reviewing Gammera The Invincible.

4070108,5,B0035CVB30,"THIS REVIEW IS ABOUT THE 2010 VERSION OF GAMERA
Here is a brief history of Gamera before we get on to the DVD release...
In 1965 Gamera was created by Daiei to compete with Toho's Godzilla. The first film was a more serious effort. The plot is very simple. Gamera arises from the Arctic to destroy Japan, & he does . Is there nothing to stop the giant turtle from destroying Japan and the entire universe ?
The special effects in this are good for the most part, save for some obvious toys used but the miniatures used and the Gamera suit were well done. I feel this movie is a little underrated and gets a bad rap at times but overall it is entertaining and a lot better than later releases..
Before getting to the 2010 DVD releases here are some notes about previous releases to home video of Gamera
Sinister Cinema carried a USA version of Gamera called Gammera the Invincible - this version had extra scenes with Albert Dekker (Dr. Cyclops) and Brian Donlevy (he was Professor Quatermass & was in some excellent film noir movies such as Impact, the Glass Key,etc). This version also contained the Gammera song. A few years ago this same version appeared was released by Alpha DVD and other low budget DVD companies..
Another USA version of Gamera came out, simply called Gamera minus the USA Gammera footage, minus the original credits , replaced by what I call the ""water credits scenes"" where this movie and 4 others all had credits on water. These are called the Sandy Frank versions and were released on VHS from Celebrity Video (and a laserdisc distributed by Image entertainment) These also contain a different English dubbing.
These versions were used for Mystery Science Theater 3000 episodes for Season 3 as well as the KTMA Season - the earliest MST3K season.
Several years later (the early to mid 1990s) Gamera again came out on VHS via Neptune Video - in 2 versions - English dubbed and English subtitled and called Giant Monster Gamera. The English dubbing was yet another different dubbing the other 2 Gamera releases...
Now here we are in 2010 and Shout Factory has gotten the rights to not only release the original Gamera on DVD in its uncut *authentic* original language,but they have the rights to ALL the Showa Series Gamera which goes all the way to Gamera vs. Zigra. That's right - ALL of them..
This NEW DVD from Shout Factory - will be anamorphic widescreen from an HD Transfer - expect a great transfer basically :)
As of this moment the bonus features are being worked on - what I do know is there will be a 12 page booklet with an essay by director Noriaki Yuasa, a photo gallery, trailers & the big news is an audio commentary by one of the most knowledgeable persons of not just Kaiju like Godzilla, Gamera, etc, but of Japanese pop culture. That man is the one and only August Ragone. I expect a truly fantastic insight to the history and making of Gamera & overall a fantastic commentary. For those that know August - he is the author of Eiji Tsuburaya: Master of Monsters & has written many articles for G-Fan, his own magazine called Markalite Magazine. And he had big role with the Neptune Video VHS releases of Gamera many years ago.
With his vast knowledge of Gamera on audio commentary - plus the anamorphic HD transfer & the bonus features , this will easily be the best Gamera DVD release & should not be missed by any monster movie  lover & fan , die hard or otherwise.",1267401600,29,3413,4.5495934959349595
4070109,5,B0035CVB30,"Most of the time I prefer the a.i.p., or the English dubbed version of these films. But in the case of the first Gamera movie I have to go with the original Japanese print. The original Japanese print is sorter, and the story gets more involve about a boy with his pet turtle. The a.i.p. version adds American actors with a running time 87mins. Which makes the movie boring. The Japanese print gets rigt to the point. I strongly recommend picking this up.",1266537600,3,455,4.493975903614458

The transfer looks quite good and there's some nice bonus stuff, but for the life of me, I cannot figure out why Shout! Factory didn't wait until they could secure rights to the American version of this film with the excellent AIP dub. It is available. A matter of not wanting to cough up the cash for it, I suppose. Sad. I would gladly have paid a few dollars more to get a multiple version, all-inclusive package of the film. Most other fans & collectors would have, too, I think. It would have been really nice to have both Japanese & American versions, and even the Sandy Frank dub would have been cool, too. Sadly, you're gonna have to do some reading with this release, as it's the Japanese language-only, with optional English subtitles. It's nice to have in my collection, but I subtracted 1 star for the failure to include the US adaption. Maybe one day...",1388016000,,1033,4.559139784946237

4070128,5,B0035CVB30,"When this first Gamera film came out, I was still in high school.  I have always enjoyed this genre, its not deep, and it doesn't ask the viewer deep questions.  These films just invite you in, ask you to sit back, and just enjoy the ride.  The plots are definitely not deep, and the acting can be very campy, but thats part of the fun in viewing these films.  For me, these movies were a small part of my youth.  If you enjoy a film that simply sets out to be just fun, I recommend some of these movies.  JRV",1368662400,,509,4.04
4070129,5,B0035CVB30,"If you are a fan of old Japanese monster movies... you can't lose.  Like Godzilla, Mothra, Rodan.... this movie is awesome!!  A classic old school cheesy monster movie.  Don't get much better.",1367452800,,192,4.9375
4070140,4,B0035CVB30,"I love it, my grandkids watched it with me. I first saw the movie in 1970. Good memories. Thanks. Japanese Company TOHO.",1365465600,,120,4.5
4070141,4,B0035CVB30,"I've been a fan of horror films since I was a wee lad and some of my fondest memories come from watching late night TV Horror Host Dr. Shock. I couldn't have been more than seven years old when he was first introduced to Philadelphians, but he was soon canceled because his show was deemed too scary? ...umm this was late night TV? I guess my parents weren't the only ones who let their small children stay up to watch his show. After many viewers wrote in and begged that he be reinstated to the line up the producers brought him back from the dead so to speak and gave him a show on Saturday and Sunday mornings and afternoons, but the show was tamed down and no where near as good. I still loved it but it was never the same.

I know this has nothing to do with this particular release, but these old monster movies always bring out the nostalgic side in me.

As a youngster, I was lucky enough to have a theater close to my home that would play films that were only a couple of years old, so I saw all the early Godzilla films, King Kong Escapes, War of Gargantuas, 7th Voyage of Sinbad and lots of Hammer horror films too.

Gamera was not one of them, but I do remember seeing some of his feature films on TV. I was never a huge fan as they seemed extremely juvenile, but giant monsters are hard to resist to a kid no matter what...... it's a fascination that is still very much alive in me to this day.

OK, now on to the real reason for this review, I watched this new Shout edition of Gamera and I was amazed at the quality of the video and audio of this release. On TV and previous video releases it was always the same old full screen washed out prints with English over dubbing.

Much like the first Godzilla film, the first Gamera film plays much more serious than many of the sequels and is a quality giant monster film in it's own right. I love black and white films and Gamera looks much less silly (to me) than in color. The English dubbing is also part of the silliness as Americans doing Japanese accents always sound degrading and it's hard to take it seriously.

I only wish that this release had included the English dubbed version as well like many of the sequels that Shout released in this series, I'm sure it was for lack of a good print, but really, they could have found a decent copy and improved on any of the releases that are out there thus far. It would have made this release much better for me because as interesting as the Japanese version is, I still prefer to not read subtitles and the English dub is what I grew up with.

The same goes for the extra content, it is all very good, but it would be nice if it had an English dub too. This might be considered nitpicking and I am not really knocking this release, but lets face it, most people who buy these films here in the states remember them the way I do and we want to have those versions. I totally enjoyed the Japanese version, but now I still long for a nice print of the English dubbed version we all grew up with. This goes for all of these Japanese Giant Monster films, with there numerous English dubs and original theatrical prints U.S. and Japanese vs. TV prints.

One other note on the photo galleris there is an annoying habit of putting PHOTO GALLERY at the top of the page which runs through the top of the photo, it is distracting and in some cases covers up some cool portions of the photo. This is also the same situation with the back button etc. Stop it! there is plenty of room at the top and bottom of the page to add this stuff.

Bottom line, if you're a fan of Gamera films, you need this edition, it is without a doubt the finest this film has ever looked or sounded. I can only hope that sales are good enough for Shout to go the extra mile and restore and release an American edition in the near future with both English dubs included.",1364169600,,3851,4.200270635994587
4070142,5,B0035CVB30,"As a kid I remember Saturday afternoons watching Sir Graves Ghastly showing films like ""Godzilla"" and ""Mothra"", but ""Gamera"" was always my favorite.  There was just something about the tiny singing fairies, the giant turtle who could pull his appendages inside his shell and then become a jet-propelled flying turtle shell, the little boy who knew Gamera was good and not evil; it was magic.  ""Gamera"" was filmed in 1965 and the amazing thing to me, watching it now and knowing more about the history of Japan, is how far the Japanese had come since WWII.  Sure, other countries around the world were producing worthy films, but no one was making films with such imagination.  Without computer graphics and the FX available today, Japanese filmmakers brought incredible stories to life.  The special effects seem quaint now, but this was the beginning.  (Well, not exactly the beginning, I would argue that the films of Georges Mlis were the real beginning of the use of special effects in film.)

If you are looking for a DVD of ""Gamera:  The Giant Monster"", I encourage you to purchase one in Japanese with subtitles and in black & white.  Even though I don't understand Japanese, I find that dubbing English over the voices of the Japanese actors removes the emotion from what the actor's are saying.",1342483200,2,1303,4.85972850678733
4070143,3,B0035CVB30,"The Showa Gamera series has its charms, especially the first three (GIANT MONSTER GAMERA, GAMERA VS. BARAGON [WAR OF THE MONSTERS], and GAMERA VS. GAOS [RETURN OF THE GIANT MONSTERS]), but I just can't say I've ever been much enamored of the big turtle--at least until the Heisei Gamera series, which put a whole new spin on the critter. The original series' overt aim at young audiences put me off even as a very young member of said audience, and only as an adult delinquent have I managed to derive much enjoyment from the antics of the inkorrigible kame.

GAMERA: THE GIANT MONSTER plays things considerably straighter than most of its successors, but there's no getting past the little kid, Toshio (Yoshiro Uchida), who just looooves turtles, continually popping up just when you think the filmmakers have come to their senses and forgotten about him. The story goes like this: A flight of Soviet jets on maneuvers over the Arctic Circle trespasses into U.S. airspace, and American fighters shoot down one of the bombers, resulting in a nuclear explosion, which frees Gamera from its eons-old icy prison. After sinking a ship and whooping up on the survivors, the beastie hurtles its way to Japan, where it attacks nuclear power plants to consume the energy they produce. Assaults with conventional weaponry have the usual effect on the kaiju--nada--so the brain trust devises a last-ditch plan aptly named Plan Z: lure Gamera to Oshima Island, where the critter is contained inside a mammoth rocket and then launched into outer space, thus ridding the world of another city-trampling menace (at least until the next movie, GAMERA VS. BARUGON, in which the rocket crashes into a meteor, releasing Gamera to return to Earth and commence a whole new path of destruction--and fight another big, bad lizard to boot).

As I mentioned, in the overall, the original GAMERA is actually enjoyable, with a significant amount of monster vs. miniature action and a marginally palatable storyline. Though obviously patterned after GODZILLA, the movie serves up no serious subtexts; the whole nuclear element is just a device to rationalize the monster's appearance, and Gamera itself is played more as a novelty than any sort of metaphor, even a lightweight one. Its rampage through Tokyo is pretty spectacular for its day, and there's no denying Gamera is a meanie; the filmic carnage is a little more graphic than in most of the Godzilla movies--which, despite the fact the Gamera films are aimed at a younger audience, is true throughout the Showa series. The monster's ironic rescue of young Toshio (the kid falls from a toppling lighthouse, into Gamera's waiting claw; rather than eat him, Gamera gently lowers him to the ground) seems more a result of the monster's curiosity about little people than a display of authentic compassion.

The Shout! Factory edition features the original Japanese version with subtitles. While it's certainly superior to the 1966 American release (titled GAMMERA, THE INVINCIBLE -- don't forget the extra ""m""!), the scenes added by World Entertainment Corp./Jack Harris Associates, which feature Albert Dekker, Brian Donlevy, Dick O'Neill, and Alan Oppenheimer, for the U.S. release are agreeably whimsical. The scenes they replace--a bunch of military and scientific posturing by some very poor western actors--in the original Japanese version are far less engaging.

Shout! Factory plans to release the rest of the Showa Gamera series in order, continuing with GAMERA VS. BARGUON in July 2010. I'm actually going to be looking forward to these, since it's really high time that Gamera--or at least the celluloid on which it appears--was treated with a little more respect on this side of the water.",1328313600,,3729,5.1182266009852215
4070144,4,B0035CVB30,"A scientific expedition to the Arctic witnesses an aerial dogfight between US fighter jets and the radar-shielded bombers of an unidentified nation (i.e., the USSR).  A bomber is shot out of the sky -- it's crash to earth reveals that it was carrying an atomic bomb.  The atomic blast awakens and energizes Gamera, an enormous fire-eating, fire-breathing, jet-propelled turtle created by the lost civilization of Atlantis.  The monster soon gets bored with kicking around the Arctic, and flies to Japan where it begins to feed on fire, petroleum, and basically crippling Japan's energy industry.  It's up to zoologist Dr. Hidaka, his assistant Ms. Yamamoto, brash newspaperman Aoyagi, and Colonel Sanders-lookalike Dr. Murase to find a way to eliminate Gamera.  Fortunately, a young, pudgy, constipated-looking kid, Toschio, loves turtles and serves as the voice of morality to the group.

Unlike most daikaiju eiga, GAMERA THE GIANT MONSTER does not shy away from real world politics, and some of the characters are surprisingly deep and thoughtful.  And then Gamera, (he's a flying, fire-breathing turtle.

The film is a beautiful widescreen print and the audio crisp, with clear, legible subtitles.  In terms of bonuses, we get an audio commentary track by August Ragone, a major historian of Japanese pop-culture and kaiju superfan, who recently wrote the authorized biography of Godzilla's special effects master, ""Eiji Tsuburaya: Master of Monsters.""  Ragone's commentary track combines a genuine enthusiasm for the material with a sense of quiet authority and well-timed comedy.  Additionally, there's a really nice mini-documentary created from interview footage of some of the primary creative minds behind the birth of Gamera, also featuring a recreation of planned-but-never-made sequel GAMERA VS. GARASHARP.

Even the DVD case contains some nice extras.  The inside of the sleeve features a beautiful anatomical drawing of Gamera, detailing some internal organs (his lungs shoved off to the side to make room for his Uranium Sac, Fire Sac, Coal Sac, Petroleum Sac and Magma Sac), reproduced inside the booklet as well, along with a retrospective on Gamera by director Noriaki Yuasa, originally released with a 2002 Japanese DVD release of the film.

Shot in black and white, this 1965 Japanese Sci-fi movie became a worldwide cult item since then around the world and a success in it's own country. Daeie Productions created a cash-in on the Godzilla craze with their own creation, it has a certain charm to it with it's campy elements and all that. Sure the acting isn't top notch but the storyline maybe similar to Godzilla's but it's not quite as great as Godzilla (1956) though, it was released in the US in a butchered cut made for US audiences that had some American actor footage inserted into the film. However now is the chance to finally see it uncut on DVD, the film has became a staple of UHF station showings and popular with fans of Mystery Science Theater 3000 which itself got it's Gamera episodes released on DVD on a MST3K set.

This DVD has great picture and sound with the Japanese language edition in English subtitles and exras like audio commentary, interviews, a retrospective and publicity gallery.",1314662400,,1322,4.7186147186147185
4070146,2,B0035CVB30,"""Gamera"" is an atrocious movie, so poor the lame-duck late-Sixties and Seventies Godzilla films seem pretty good in comparison.  It's one of the worst-plotted movies I've ever seen: the plot is strung together by criss-crossed, loose threads, making little sense from an objective standpoint and making less sense in the scenes, which are rife with characters who exist solely for the state of the plot and have no human emotions but those necessary to keep the plot a-chuggin'.  Toho's films were no masters of plot, either, but even such a nonsense plot as ""Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster"" seems Hitchcockian compared to that of ""Gamera.""  It's a cash cow: just as Gamera was born to suck flames, ""Gamera"" was born to suck Godzilla-lovers' cash.

But a kaiju fan will find appeal in even the lamest, most painful kaiju film.  Gamera has a more grotesque and interesting design than that of Godzilla.  The mystic origin of Gamera--a murderous giant turtle, the only one of its kind, terrorizing an Asian continent at the Dawn of Time--may ignite the imaginations of kaiju fans, who are imaginative by trade (we have to be--how else would we be so in love with movies about guys dressing up in kooky rubber monster suits for 90 minutes?).  The final solution to getting rid of Gamera is pulp sci-fi bliss.  One may be too dulled by the stupidity of the movie to see it coming.

The bottom line is no secret: ""Gamera"" isn't ""Gojira.""  It's ""Gojira""'s younger brother of special needs.  It's a cruddy movie that spawned a line of cruddy movies.  But good things have come from it.  Besides the bizarre monster itself, the ""Mystery Science Theater"" riffs, which are delightful, but above all, Shusuke Kaneko's Gamera reboot trilogy, released in the mid- to late-Nineties, which surpassed almost all kaiju movies, and then, with the astounding third film, blew them all out of the water.  It's amazing Kaneko was able to make those films from a stupid kaiju flick that began with a giant turtle coming out of apparently styrofoam ice 30 years earlier.  Oh, the wonder of cinema.",1312329600,,2078,4.880341880341881

The video and audio quality are fantastic. Extras include a booklet, original Japanese trailer (with subtitles), a Gamera series retrospective featurette (with not 100% accurate subtitles, but subbed nonetheless), publicity image gallery, and an informative audio commentary by kaiju authority August Ragone.

4070149,4,B0035CVB30,"In the mid-60s, Daei Motion Picture Company produced their first kaiju eiga (monster movie) in direct competition with rival Toho Studios' popular Godzilla franchise. Helmed by neophyte director Noriaki Yuasa, the ambitious production was shot in B&W (to help camouflage the special effects team's inexperience) and released in 1965 as DAIKAIJU GAMERA, or GAMERA THE GIANT MONSTER.

An unidentified, though clearly hostile (the U.S. version explicitly calls it Soviet) bomber plane is shot down by the U.S. Air Force in the arctic, and its nuclear payload detonates, releasing a gigantic, prehistoric turtle from the ice. This monster, Gamera, which can breath fire and actually fly by means of jets which cause it to spin like a flying saucer, heads South toward Japan (of course), and begins to wreak havoc as it searches for nourishment in the form of thermal energy (i.e. fire). As Japan's Self Defense Force and an international group of scientists attempt to find a way to halt the titanic tortoise's rampage, a young boy becomes convinced that Gamera is his pet turtle and keeps interfering with the authorities' efforts.

Released in America in heavily-altered form 1966 as GAMMERA THE INVINCIBLE, this new DVD release from Shout! represents the first time that the film has been available in this country in its original form. In this film, Gamera is definitely a threat, creating considerable havoc, and laying waste to much of Tokyo in its search for sustenance. Even here, though, the monster shows signs of becoming the ""friend to all children"" that he would later become, when he (inadvertently?) saves the life of a small boy (much to the viewer's annoyance).

DAIKAIJU GAMERA is a very entertaining sci-fi movie with a decidedly goofy, but endearing creature. Although not as technically accomplished as the kaiju films produced by Toho, there's a real charm to the film and its mon-star that struck a chord with audiences - especially kids - and Daei went on to produce seven sequels by the same filmmakers. These follow-ups were even more geared toward young boys, and featured a wild array of truly bizarre beasties. In the 90s, three excellent Gamera films were made that were somewhat more adult in nature, and in 2006, the creature returned in a delightful children's film, GAMERA THE BRAVE.

Shout! Factory's DVD of GAMERA is something of a revelation. The 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen transfer is near-flawless, with a perfectly-balanced black & white image with good contrast and sharp detail from a new, high definition master. The original Japanese audio is intact, with English subtitles scripted by author and Asian fantasy aficionado August Ragone. Ragone also provides an informative and often amusing audio commentary for the film, which provides considerable insight into the creation of the film and the backgrounds of its cast & crew.

Additional bonus features include a retrospective featurette, in Japanese, that includes on-screen interviews with director Yuasa and several other key players in the making of the original film series. There is an extensive publicity and advertising still gallery and the original Japanese trailer. There's also a highly informative, 12-page illustrated pamphlet tucked in the case.

The American version of the film was originally intended to be part of the package, but the owners of the only high-quality film print apparently wanted more money than Shout! had budgeted for the disc. It's a shame, but there are lots of budget labels out there with that version (looking pretty shoddy) if you really want a copy for your collection and don't have one already.

Overall, GAMERA THE GIANT MONSTER is a fantastic package, with an eye-opening transfer and solid extras. If you've only ever seen the pan & scan, badly-dubbed TV prints of the U.S. version (or the later entries - which are scheduled for future release by Shout! in their original Japanese form), you'll be surprised at how much fun - and how good - this movie really is. If you're a kaiju fan, it's an essential purchase.

Highly recommended.",1280880000,3,4078,5.131024096385542
8388838,4,B0035CVB30,"This review is for the standard DVD version of Gamera: The Giant Monster released by Shout! Factory in 2010.

First a little bit about Gamera:

Gamera came along in 1965 as either a ripoff of Godzilla or competition for him or both. The production company Daiei, wanted to compete with Toho. Daiei was in serious financial trouble and took a gamble that paid off. Gamera; The Giant Monster was a success. Seven sequels would follow.
Gamera is essentially a flying, fire-breathing giant turtle. He manages to fly but shooting flames out from his shell where his legs and arms should be and then spinning in a circle. How he takes off without any downward thrust is anybodies guess. Also, he often walks upright on his rear two legs. I'm not sure if that makes his front two legs, arms. He breaths fire from his mouth which is similar but not the same as Godzilla. Godzilla breathes radioctive whatever and his breath varies in color depending on the movie.

DVD: This version of the original Gamera is the Japanese version. There is an edited version called Gamera the Invincible which was for the American market. However, there is no dubbing and it is Japanese with English subtitles. If you don't like reading subtitles then this is not the version for you.
The picture is very good and is crisp and better than any previous releases.

EXTRA'S: There are quite a few extra's. Included is a booklet on the Gamera franchise. The casing of the DVD is clear plastic and on the inside you get a cutaway diagram of Gamera himself. You can see what makes him tick.
There is an informative audio commentary, a behind the scenes featurette and a trailer.

PLOT/SUMMARY: Dr. Hidaka is somewhere in the frozen north with his daughter Kyoko and a photographer Aoyagi. Shortly before, they departed their ship, 'Chidori Maru'. Apparently they are in the Arctic Circle and they encounter Eskimo's there.  Aoyagi was one of eight photographers who was selected to continue the trip from the ship. Dr. Hidaka is there to search for ancient turtles. He is there on the premise that he is looking for Atlantis. He asks the Eskimo chieftain if he has seen any large turtles in the Arctic. The chieftain gives him an ancient stone that may depict one. At this time a low flying supersonic aircraft appears overhead. Dr. Hidaka alerts the American base nearby. They send out fighters to intercept the aircraft of unknown origin. The unknown aircraft are unresponsive to communication and fire on the American planes. The American planes shoot down the unknown aircraft. We then find out that it was carrying a nuclear bomb because that said bomb explodes. Shortly thereafter, Gamera appears. He's apparently not very happy to be woken up from his ages long sleep. Gamera sinks the Chidori Maru and disappears beneath the sea. Dr. Hidaka, his daughter and Aoyagi are the only survivors.

From here on out, there is no mention regarding the nuclear bomb. You might think that a bomber flying beneath radar cover with an armed nuclear device getting shot down and the bomb detonating might make some news....but it is not to be.

Next we meet....unfortunately!!!....Toshio. He is one of the most annoying kids in the history of movies. Toshio lives with his family at a lighthouse in Japan. He has an obsession with turtles. His parents are not happy about it and they tell him to get rid of his pet turtle. Gamera appears at the lighthouse and Toshio promptly takes off and heads to the lighthouse and climbs to the top. Gamera has decided to destroy the lighthouse. For whatever reason....Gamera decides to save Toshio's life. As the idiot kid is hanging from the railing, Gamera scoops him up and gently puts him down. Why... you ask?...it's anybodies guess since he spends the rest of the movie killing people and causing destruction.
Toshio then spends the rest of the movie popping up everywhere where he shouldn't be telling anybody and everybody that Gamera is really good!
He tries very hard to get himself killed but fails.
Gamera feeds on energy and spends most of the movie hunting for it...more specifically...oil.
Dr. Hidaka, and the Japanese military spend the rest of the movie plotting to stop Gamera. Every now and then Kyoko and Aoyagi pitch in some comments. Even Toshio at one point has a rational thing to say. Several plans are hatched to defeat Gamera. The military fails miserably like they do in every monster movie ever made except for perhaps the unfortunate 'Godzilla' (1998). Ultimately it will come down to Plan Z (don't ask). Somehow, in these movies, they always seem to get the monster to go walk to the exact spot they need him.

PRODUCTION: This is the only Gamera movie that was filmed in black and white. To me, black and white gives the movie a much more serious look to it. It was 1965 when this film was shot so it's unclear if this was done just to save money.
Early on in the movie, Eskimo's are encountered and they speak a foreign language and Japanese subtitles appear. The foreign language they are speaking is English with a Japanese accent!
The American actors hired for this movie were obviously had for not much money. They are terrible actors. Once again, that is part of the charm of these movies. It looks like their scenes were filmed in  one take as you hear the actors stumble over their lines a few times.
Japanese actors were hired to be American pilots. I guess they thought they could hide that fact behind the helmet gear. Also, the extra American soldiers in the American headquarters are all Japanese.

COMMENTS:  Although I am a 'Godzilla' fan in general, I also enjoy the 'Gamera' movies. After the first few movies, they turn into kids movies just like the 'Godzilla' franchise did in the late 60's to mid 70's.

I hated Toshio with a passion. If only Gamera could have done away with him early on.
Aoyagi and Kyoko's romance goes nowhere. I guess it was there just because these movies are supposed to have a romance.

Don't look for any logic in 'Gamera'. Like most 'kaiju' movies...there isn't any. 'Gamera' seems to go out of it's way in trying to be illogical. But that is what gives this movie a large part of it's entertainment value. It's quite amusing when completely idiotic statements are stated with such earnestness. We could definitely have done without Toshio but even he can't stop this movie from being a success with it's zany logic.

Recommended for all fans of 'kaiju' films any fan of giant monster movies in general. Keep in mind at the time of this review, in 2016, you can buy all of the Gamera movies on blu-ray in a very inexpensive set. You won't get all the extra's but if you don't care about that then that is definitely the way to go.",1472342400,3,6710,4.698723404255319
8388839,4,B0035CVB30,"Gamera the Giant Monster is the original Japanese version with subtitles in English.  Gamera the Invincible is the heavily re-edited American version of the same film with different footage featuring American actors.

In this Japanese version, an A-bomb is accidentally exploded in the Arctic and wakes up a prehistoric chelonian monster they name Gamera (because Fred would have been awkward).  Gamera is a bit testy from this rude awakening; he ruins an American jet then heads for Japan.  On the way, he destroys Fujisawa then takes his frustrations out on a lighthouse.  An obnoxious little boy was in the lighthouse at the time so Gamera saves him before moving on to the destruction of a research ship and all onboard.  Its now surmised that Gamera is in need of a snack and that he appears to like swallowing fire.  While the military struggles to find a way to deal with or defeat Gamera, this same obnoxious little boy keeps getting in the way, convinced that Gamera is really his pet turtle Pee-wee, which he had to let go.  This movie would have been flawless without the unwanted intrusion of this little boy.",1464220800,,1121,4.802083333333333

The DVD arrived as pictured, it worked in our standard DVD player no problem. We enjoyed the film, it made us laugh, probably when it wasn't meant to, but we were amused. My nephew was really into Godzilla for a few years, and enjoyed watching this as something a bit different. He sat through the whole thing.",1444608000,,399,4.2631578947368425

8388843,4,B0035CVB30,"While I generally dislike this movie, the DVD release by Shout! Factory is awesome on its own.  First off, the actual Japanese audio with English subtitles are on here, so I don't have to listen to the English Dub on my other DVDs of the movie.  The special features are good enough.  Gamera isn't a child-friendly hero in this movie either.  I think the sequel, Gamera vs. Barugon is better because of the tone and the absence of kids, but Gamera the Giant Monster is alright.  The DVD release is great with the cover and the case, the quality of the film, and the special features.  While not the best at all, it's still better than some of the others in the Showa series.  I would much rather watch the MST3K version also released by Shout! Factory.  I love the Shout! Factory DVDs and I still need Gamera vs. Barugon, Gamera vs. Gaos/Gamera vs. Viras, and Gamera vs. Guiron/Gamera vs. Jiger.  If you like Gamera, pick this one up, because this is where he started, and from what I have in my collection right now, it's the best copy of it.  Pick this up if you want to see where he started, but if you want better films, go to Gamera vs. Barugon, the Gamera trilogy, and Gamera the Brave.  Still enjoyable in some aspects.",1427414400,2,1226,4.404444444444445
