4285671,1,B00480PTPE,"This could be the worst movie on amazon or anywhere for that matter. No plot, terrible acting,completely senseless violence that is so fake it's laughable.
Some guy and two female friends attack and stab young people for no apparent reason, that's the ""plot"" of this crap home video mess.",1318032000,40,288,4.8979591836734695

4285673,1,B00480PTPE,"This was made using iPhone special effects and all, my biggest problem with this movie is I paid for it",1394150400,3,103,4.2
4285674,1,B00480PTPE,"nothing redeeming, bad overacting, lack of direction, large volumes of stage blood do not make special effects, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!",1378339200,3,144,5.041666666666667
4285675,1,B00480PTPE,"Don't waste your time or money. This ""movie"" was hideous! From the acting to the storyline, there was absolutely nothing good about this flick.",1372550400,3,143,5.0
4285676,3,B00480PTPE,"The only good scene was the rape scene in the trailer, and that was light.  There a a lot of scenes where they missed it.  The bad guy was good.",1362268800,,144,3.7666666666666666
4285677,1,B00480PTPE,Looks like someone needs to bury this film in the woods where it came from a sort of slasher film but like soft core slasher.,1361232000,,125,4.04
4285678,1,B00480PTPE,"Release date 2010 and was made in the 70s. Unless it is a movie I liked and remembered seeing, I should not rent these. Most of them are not as good as the more recent movies. The movies made between the 90s and those of today are much better.",1356566400,,243,3.979591836734694
4285679,1,B00480PTPE,"I love horror movies, and I should have passed right by this one. No Wonder they didn't provide a Usurp detailing this piece of garbage!! There was no plot, the acting was extremely bad, and a complete waste of money!

I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, even the parents of the makers!  Jeez, what a complete home video junk!",1355011200,,332,4.516666666666667
4285680,5,B00480PTPE,Everyone who is giving this film one star obviously has not majored in film and doesn't know where to look for the real story behind the story.  You all did not get it.  The subtle imagery is what you need to look for in understanding what the director was going for.  The slashing was a front for the deeper meaning in the background.  Re-watch it and watch the back ground.  You will be amazed at what you missed!,1344470400,4,415,4.269230769230769
4285681,1,B00480PTPE,"My friend and I have been watching a series of the old 1970s revenge and sexploitation movies. We have seen some pretty horrible stuff (and some good well made film, I must admit). The movie being reviewed here, ""Three Days in the Woods"" did not even make the cut as ""horrible stuff."" (My young friend is ""doing a paper for school,"" or so she says)

To be honest with you the first two reviewers here have been overly kind in their assessment of this ""movie."" I have seen some bad, bad, bad movies in my life but I do believe that this one out does them all.

What you have is three people, two girls and on man who go about randomly stabbing people to death. There is no plot. There are really no characters...just sort of ""things"" running around stabbing ""things."" The dialog, what there is of it is mindless. The quality of the filming is wretched and the actually scenes shot look so phony that it is difficult to believe they could possibly have been conceived, much less shot. Why did not the cameraman and director shake their heads and go hide in disgrace halfway through shooting this one?

Shame on anyone who actually charges money for this thing to be shown...my friend spent 1.99 and it would have been better for her to have simply flushed it down the crapper where this film belongs. At least it would have saved us the agony and boredom of setting through the thing.",1341619200,28,1382,4.454545454545454

8418479,5,B00480PTPE,"Definitely a good movie. I'm definitely not a robot programmed to give this movie a good review. I enjoyed this movie and you would enjoy it too. watch this movie. ignore the one star reviews and listen to me. You like blood coming out of every person's mouth.... this is the movie for you. You like sex scenes around every corner, this is the movie for you. Watch this movie please or I will lose by robot job.",1470182400,,411,4.282051282051282

8418483,1,B00480PTPE,"i usually don't pay attention to reviews because not everyone has the same tastes, what is terrible for one may not be for another. well. this was so bad i couldn't even finish it.  of course they did every horror slasher movie stereotype and mistake. i mean really, your sis is taken by some crazy in the woods, so you send the girls by themselves to get help, and  you and your buddy decide it is a good idea to split up..  lets make it easier for the slasher to get everyone. i won't say don't get this, you may like it, but as for me this is one i should of listened to the reviews.",1424995200,,586,4.0344827586206895

8418487,1,B00480PTPE,"Dishonors the movies it tries to pay tribute to. Amazon should stop it from appearing on its ""If you like this, you might like this"" section, or be sued for dishonest advertising. Nobody might like this.",1397433600,5,203,4.666666666666667
