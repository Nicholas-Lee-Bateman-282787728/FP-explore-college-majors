8036036,5,B00049QNTY,Yugioh is one of the best shows I have ever seen.,1425686400,,49,3.5454545454545454
8036037,5,B00049QNTY,"I know everyone keeps saying, ""Why do you buy the dub?  The Japanese is better, because there's blood and violence, and blah blah blah.""  Well, I'm a female college freshman, and I think the dub is just fine.

This DVD contains one of the best duels EVER in the series - Yami Malik v. Mai - and easily the best duel of the Battle City Finals.  Yami Malik is ridiculously annoying, but his strategy in this duel is genius.

This is the third duel in the Battle City Finals (after Yami Bakura v. Yami Yugi and Rishid (Odion) v. Joey).

I HIGHLY recommend this DVD for anyone who is a fan of Yu-Gi-Oh!, because Battle City was easily the greatest season.",1168214400,2,651,4.338842975206612
