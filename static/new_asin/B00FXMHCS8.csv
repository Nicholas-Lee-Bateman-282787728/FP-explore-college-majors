8619221,5,B00FXMHCS8,"This is the latest from director Yoshihiro Nakamura who brought us the rather splendid Fish Story and it is much appreciated that more of his beautifully original films are getting releases over here. This tells the story of Satoru played with perfect precision and understanding  by Gaku Hamada who also featured in Fish Story. He decides to drop out of school, after graduating from elementary school. He then decides to never leave the project  the social housing estate in which he has lived his whole life.

He has a preoccupation with keeping fit and self defence as well as a compulsion to do patrols of the estate to ensure all his friends and neighbours are safe. Well his friends go to High School and he plods on hoping to land a job at the only cake shop on the estate. What follows is his story and we slowly find out more and more as the story gently unfolds. His life mirrors that of Japans in many ways as he learns to deal with everything that is thrown at him, but in his own way, from love, work, loss and violence.

I really loved this film, Satoru is one of those characters that is so adorable that you just never want him to fail or be hurt and as such I was totally drawn into every moment of this two hour offering. There is a theme running through the film that document how many of his class from school leave the project and at one time it is said like petals blown in a storm; farewells are a fact of life. This is one of those films that takes you by surprise and you feel all the more grateful for it, I hope we get to see more from the rather wonderful Mr Nakamura very soon  absolutely recommended. Sadly I only saw the film and have no idea about the candy.",1387584000,,1691,4.271875
