8283549,5,B001BMN3WI,"I have watched many documentaries on Everest climbing and I find this one is also a good one.
This climbing is done by French Pastor and his friend. This is real documentary. I am really amazed
how they made it to climb Mount Everest ! This movie tells all difficulties about climbing. I like it !
This documentary does not have anything about Christianity or Bible.
If you love mountains or Climbing you must watch it...I am in fact from Nepal & I liked presentation and information
on Nepal and mountains!",1414195200,,507,4.582417582417582
8283550,2,B001BMN3WI,"I was looking for the story of the inspiration that drove the author to climb to the summit, most of the movie was more of the technical and physiological aspects of the climb. The photography was good, but the story was lacking.",1404864000,,229,4.476190476190476
8283551,5,B001BMN3WI,What an amazing story of endurance. A great movie to pass on to the young men in our family for Christmas.,1388620800,,106,4.095238095238095
8283552,4,B001BMN3WI,I thought it was a lovely story.  A lot of the other stories about Everest show the dead bodies on the mountain.  Don't want to see that.,1384300800,,137,4.037037037037037
