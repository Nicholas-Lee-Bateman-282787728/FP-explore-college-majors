8759834,4,B01EZ0U6OA,"Americas craft beer scene keeps moving onward and upward. The growth has slowed just a tad, but the industry is still moving forward and the state with more breweries than any other is California. Craft: The California Beer Documentary provides some fast- paced insight into the world of California craft beer, complete with dozens of interviews from the men and women who have helped lead the state to the top.

Craft is an insightful documentary and it serves up a quick education on California craft beer and what makes the industry such a success. The individuals who speak on the documentary discuss everything from the quality emphasis that has helped make beer in California so desirable to the state regulations that make it difficult to open a brewery and keep it running. What Craft presents is mostly positive, but I like that the documentary includes both the successes and the challenges because it keeps things real. If it was a solid ninety minutes of pro- California propaganda, I would be less likely to take it seriously. But the documentary shows that not everything relating to Californias craft beer scene is rosy and beautiful. There are some aspects of California brewing that are less than ideal and its nice that the documentary includes them.

This documentary is mostly about the people who have helped California rise to the top, but there are other aspects of the film worth noting. Craft includes scenes from across the state of California, inside breweries large and small, showing the viewer what life is like when you operate a brewery. With each interview, the film includes captions, showing the interviewees name and what brewery he/she works for. This makes it easy to place a face with a brewery and a comment with an individual. Oh, and don't worry about this documentary holding your attention. The documentary moves at a rapid pace, closing one interview and quickly jumping to the next, before you have much time to think.

California is a hotbed for craft beer. Craft: The California Beer Documentary is a very useful way to learn more about the industry and the people who have helped build it into the success it is today. The documentary is more of an overview than anything, and it doesnt include much in the way of in- depth or personal stories. But it still succeeds on most all levels and its a documentary every lover of the craft should watch at least once.",1513728000,,2409,4.828087167070218

8759836,5,B01EZ0U6OA,"The documentary did a great job of telling the stories of what California craft brewers are doing and issues they are dealing with. They talked to a ton of brewers and let them tell the story in their own words. It was upbeat and made me want to grab a beer while I was watching.

8759837,4,B01EZ0U6OA,"I had hoped that this documentary had more to say about Anchor's Fritz Maytag. I thought it covered to much time on U C Davis and the teaching class. All in all,it was ok.",1485129600,,171,4.0588235294117645
