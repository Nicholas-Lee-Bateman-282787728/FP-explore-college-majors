Just work on your conditioning with any type of aerobics of your choice.  Do lounges to strengthen your legs. This video won't help you be a better skiier.",1125100800,,189,4.5
7885720,5,6305243689,"Since I had never been skiing before and heard that you have to be physically fit to endure it, I decided to start working out a few months in advance.  I bought this video so I could specifically strengthen those muscles I would need.  That's exactly what the trainers did.  They worked areas I didn't even know I needed!  I love the at-home session because it uses no supplemental tools... just the weight of your body working against itself.  If you're not in shape, it's very easy to modify the intensity level of the workout until you grow stronger.  And the stretches and warm-up were very helpful before and after I skiied to minimize soreness.  I know that without this training, I would have been toast on the slopes!  I'd definitely recommend it to beginners, as well as advanced skiiers, who want to enhance performance and endurance.",1072742400,,845,4.700680272108843
7885721,4,6305243689,"When I ordered this video, I didn't know quite what to expect.  After doing the workout several times, it seemed as though the muscle groups I'd historically had problems with were actually being targetted.  However, I decided to wait to write a review until after I'd gone skiing the first time this year.  After 3 days on the slopes, I can honestly say that the workout and training tips provided in this video have made a significant improvement in my skiing.  By using the concepts and workout on this video, I had vastly improved my muscular endurance, and thus my enjoyment of the sport.  I would highly recommend this tape for anyone who is relatively new to skiing.  While the dialog is a bit ""cheezy"" at times, the exercises and training tips are worth living through the soundtrack for.",976752000,3,796,4.690647482014389
