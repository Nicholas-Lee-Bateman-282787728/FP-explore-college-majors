4518289,3,B0050UEVQO,"While still continuing in the style of season 1, Season 2 lacks the energy, the draw or the suspense of the first season. Almost the entire season focuses solely on two problem the main char's face. You don't feel the same excitement or see any of the action of the first season and it comes off as rather boring and intellectual instead of suspenseful and cunning. I'd suggest renting it unless your an avid wolf and spice fan.",1314748800,3,428,4.5
4518290,5,B0050UEVQO,"I'm really happy that Funimation has finally announced that they are still going to release this season, I was scared that they dropped it and we would never get it. I really hope that they release just a DVD version because I don't have a Blu-Ray player and I don't want to pay more for something I won't use, if they don't end up doing that then I will definitely get this version.",1314144000,7,383,4.260273972602739
4518291,5,B0050UEVQO,"Well, for starters, I am one of the lucky few who received this set before the actual release date. I will not say where I got it from out of respect for Amazon but if you want to know then message me.

Now, this season picks up where season 1 left off. A lot happens. If you loved season one then you will adore season two.",1313798400,2,324,3.909090909090909
4518292,5,B0050UEVQO,"Whether its the anime, novel or manga, the Spice and Wolf series is just something so unique and different in its own way. Some may not like it, everyones perspective varies. But if you're a fan of anime, it's absolutely something you should look into and see if it might spark an intrest in you, it sure did in me. Watching the anime on Netflix made me buy it on DvD, and also the books which I am very pleased with(considering I never read haha). I'm very happy to see the second season available now, and hope they keep it going.",1306713600,16,532,4.2772277227722775
4518293,5,B0050UEVQO,"I absolutely love this anime! I fell in love with it from the very first episode; the characters are just so amazing. I've been searching everywhere; hoping to find some evidence of a release date for the English dubs, and now i have it! I can hardly wait for this to come out. when i get the money I'm definitely pre-ordering!!!",1306627200,5,329,4.409836065573771
4518294,5,B0050UEVQO,"It is fantastic that Funimation has decided to release the second season of the brilliantly calm Spice and Wolf. Coupled with their re-issue of the first season on blu-ray, the two sets will look beautiful both next to each other on your shelf and on your television.

The story continues as Holo and Lawrence make their way towards Yoitsu, Holo's homeland. Where the first season focused on the budding, flirty relationship between Holo and Lawrence, this season finally admits it outright. It does not, however, forget the economics and intelligence that made it such a charming series.

The first season had intriguing plots about different currencies and the principles of economics applied on a large scale. This season continues that, to a degree, but the episodic nature of the first season is not maintained. The story of season two is more cohesive throughout. Without spoiling anything, the relationship between Holo and Lawrence takes the forefront, while Holo's continuing education and intuition regarding the laws of economics is also portrayed. Indeed, though Lawrence is the alleged expert in the field, Holo's scheming and discretion is what saves the day on more than one occasion. Imagine the suspense of a battle anime, like Naruto or Bleach or Hajime no Ippo, only the battleground is the world of money, coercion and intrigue.

The dubbing Funimation employed for the first season was very well done, and as always the set will include the original Japanese dub for those who enjoy subtitles. The recent development of anime on Blu-ray will ensure that the series looks as good as it possibly can as you watch, and while this series is not the most beautiful anime around, it is certainly not poorly drawn. Watching it, you will have wonderful characters with whom you can connect, plots that will allow you to think through the deals and economics, and the satisfaction of having watched an anime truly different from others you have seen.

Will there be a third season? There are many who hope so. The light-novels, off of which this anime is based, are being released by Yen Press. So if you cannot wait to continue the adventures of Holo and Lawrence, opportunities will be open to you. If the episodic format of the first season turned you off to the series, this season should draw you back. There are only two main storylines throughout, with a few small side plots. Watch the relationship between two very believable (yet fantastic) characters develop naturally, and with all the charm in the world, as they navigate themselves through an inventive medieval world.",1305936000,63,2594,4.983833718244804

4518329,4,B0050UEVQO,"I bought S&W 1. but then they had the box set... a bummer meaning that the developers won't be making another season of the series for a LONG wile...

I then bought S&W 2. and it was just as good as the first one... but it had its ups and DOWNs on the first half of the season. drama. despair. all with a much appreciated rejoice! then.... at the very end... all ends with a massive cliff hanger. still waiting on that 3rd season. But nothing as of 3 years later, no closing OVA or movie.

i give it a 4/5 do to personal opinion of unneeded drama in the season. don't like toooo much drama. but after you get threw the dramatic part. it feels like a thriller!

4518356,5,B0050UEVQO,"This series is amazing. I would recommend it to any fantasy fan, and I love the two main characters, they are very interesting with distinct personalities--not cardboard cutouts or tv tropes.

4518363,3,B0050UEVQO,"While I enjoy the premise of the story, the episodes seemed long with slow arcs and I wonder if something was lost with the English voice actors.  Holo's voice was a good fit for the character's more upbeat and intelligent content, but ended up bugging me in slower sections.  Still, it carries over from season 1 well, with character development and some twists.  I do wish I could make some sense of the last episode, or it is possible the series was delivered out of order and mislabeled.",1363651200,,491,4.556818181818182

4518384,5,B0050UEVQO,"I am about to wrap this one up and, simply put, I wish there was going to be more. The story revolves around a traveling merchant, Craft Lawrence and his traveling companion Holo -or as she puts it ""Holo the Wise Wolf""- who is a wolf deity who wants to make it back to her homeland. The viewer gets to go come along on their shared journey and see their relationship grow deeper as they get to know each other. This show has the right amount of drama, comedy, and slightly tense situations to keep someone interested and coming back. Following all of the economic points in the show has been fun ... following their stock market and watching the various schemes unfold. But the gem of the show is the story between Craft and Holo which is just excellent. I wasn't sure how much I would like it at first, honestly. I thought the pace was a little slow at first, but a few episodes in and I saw that the show's tempo was just right. This is one of those anime you can just sit back and enjoy without much effort. The artwork is beautiful throughout the series, the characters are all well done, their personalities are quite fitting, and the soundtrack is really nice and adds to the overall feel of this series. This is a must have for any collection and you will be wanting more of these delightful characters upon coming to the end.",1351641600,,1333,4.357429718875502
4518385,5,B0050UEVQO,"Spice and Wolf is a very unique anime. It seems to be set in a sort of european middle ages type of world. Lawrence is a traveling merchant who happens across a wolf diety. They begin to travel as partners after he promises to take Holo, the wolf diety, back to her birthplace in the north. They encounter many trials such as the inquisition and thieves taking them for their money. All these trials strengthen their bond and they eventually fall for each other. I cant think of a single bad thing about this anime. The art is beautiful, the soundtrack is amazing the voice actors are top notch, and the overall atmosphere of the show is great. It's nice to escape to another world with this dynamic duo. Spice and Wolf is a very unique anime. I really love it. You probably will too.

Season 2 is just more of the same Spice and Wolf, but that's why people love it. It's a one of a kind anime. The drama gets a little more intense in this series as Lawrence and Holo become closer. The ending is very open. It may very well end with this season, but then again you never know. Personally I want more. If you like season 1 then you need season 2. One of the better new animes I've seen.",1350432000,,1186,4.247787610619469
4518386,5,B0050UEVQO,"I Love anime, and especially Spice and Wolf. This episode in particular had got to be my favorite because it is soo odd and funny. It does a great job of showing how Holo feels towards Lawrence and especially how she feels for the blond wrench ""Norah""",1347235200,,251,4.361702127659575
4518387,5,B0050UEVQO,"Although I admit having a hard time following the plot line (seeing it concerns being a merchant with money from an entirely different time period and understanding the stock market), it's a pretty good story involving a hapless merchant who stumbles upon a wolf girl and they slowly become friends.

4518420,4,B0050UEVQO,"My wife and I first saw the series online, the title images we had seen (not this one) made this look a bit... risque to say the least.

We were pleasantly surprised to find no real focus on nudity beyond 'doll-esque' levels.

Really the main focus is the economies of medieval times, how travelling merchants made money etc. Its fascinating in a weird way; interspersed with supernatural mythos like harvest gods and the like. Its very interesting. Hopefully a third season is on the way somewhere...

As for this particular box set, the bluray titlescreen seemed a bit off, but the video itself was great. Nothing to complain about really and it played perfectly on the PS3 as well.",1340668800,,684,4.73109243697479
4518421,5,B0050UEVQO,"Pros:
- It has a cozy spot for the Season 1 set in there, so it looks aesthetically amazing. I love how the box just says ""Spice & Wolf"".
- It's an amazing anime, need I say more? <3

Cons:
- I had to buy the Blu-Ray disks bundled in this pack. I cannot play Blu-rays as I have no Blu-ray player, so I'm feeling that I spent more money than I needed to on this.
- Also, if you plan on putting the Blu-ray set of Season 1 in here, don't get your hopes up. It's too short to fit in the box because they choose to give you DVD size cases for these releases instead of Blu-ray size cases.
- The actual DVD case looks very messy; they put all 4 disks in attached spindles and even left the outlines on the actual inside of the case which ruins the case aesthetically. And in my case, taking out the Blu-ray spindle makes it look even more awkward.

Overall, FUNimation could've done a WAY better job with this box set, but they tried their best.
Plus, I love my S&W too much to complain. '",1339977600,,984,4.01530612244898

Most of Season Two is taken up with a powerful lesson in how commodities markets work.  Whoever wrote this series has worked in the commodities market and understands their flucuations in exquisite detail.

Strong characters, detailed plot with solid real-world foundation, beautiful artwork.  ""Spice and Wolf"" is more than great anime.  It is great literature.",1322956800,5,600,5.197916666666667

The last episode ending was not very good IMO... left it feeling open. However it only covers books 3 and 4. if i remember correctly. but their are 16 novels so their is a lot more that happens after this series... Now if that gets put on DVD or blu ray is up to them.

4518441,5,B0050UEVQO,"...But that opinion is based solely on personal preference; looking at it objectively, the whole second season is very well done in every respect, and that's why I think it still deserves five stars.  Giving it anything less would be unfair to all the people who put so much work into producing something of such high quality.
If you want to know why I personally don't think it's as good as season one, it's because Horo is not in it as much.
Seriously.  There are far too many instances of Lawrence going around and doing his own thing, to the point where by the final episodes, you almost roll your eyes - I think there might be one or two episodes where Horo practically does not even speak a single line, because the story is so focused on Lawrence and his side of their difficulties.
That being said, the anime's quality in itself has not diminished in any sense, and this season does have a couple of very beautiful scenes...it's just that I'm personally not very happy with the things the story was focused on at times.  It's like, who even watches Spice and Wolf to see Lawrence?  Seriously.
There are also a couple really interesting characters that are introduced in this season, but regrettably, they don't get as much screen time as I would personally have liked, and instead, the story focuses on the more annoying or uninteresting characters and their influence on the story.
Finally, the ending for this specific season feels a bit too abrupt and even anti-climatic.  Looking at it rationally, it's pretty obvious that the story isn't over, that Horo and Lawrence's journey will continue, and that hopefully, we haven't seen the last of them, but I've read a couple comments and opinions around the internet, to the effect that the ending for this specific season could have been more satisfying, and I personally agree with them.
In summary, Spice and Wolf continues to be a great anime if you evaluate season two objectively, but depending on what you are expecting or hoping to see, you may or may not be disappointed.",1317600000,3,2037,4.69467787114846
4518442,5,B0050UEVQO,"*First, a quick observation on the cost and why I am a loyal pre-order buyer now*  I pre-ordered this set----and I'm glad I did----its crazy how anime prices can fluctuate!  It started out at a $60 pre-release, then dropped to the high $30 range when I got mine, and now its back up to above $60?  All in a short time of less then 2 months...crazy....Makes me glad I always pre-order!

Anyways, this series (2nd season or 1st) isn't for everyone.  It's different in its own way.  In that fact people who think outside the anime box should be the ones to review this, not who they just had review it, this soloman guy.  I've never seen an anime like this before, and now I'm glad I did.  It's not easy to describe, but it is a great watch if you have the mental capacity to enjoy an anime that tells a story at its own pace.  And my god, for goodness sake--if a wolf-girl shows up, naturally she's going to be naked---so why did this guy have an issue with that?  sheesh...It was craftfully done and in good taste.  Some anime has some strange concepts---I'll never understand the whole panty shots----sadly, not even Bleach has escaped that---I've just came across a scene in bleach where the soul reapers are on wako mundo and one of the bounts is obsessed with seeing this one girl's panties.  So seriously, the nudity done in this spice and wolf show is artfully done and not for shock factor.  What a prude this guy must be.  He probably even bathes in a swim suit.

As for the second season, I feel that anyone who has seen the first will enjoy it.  This is a story, not a battle anime that will have wars and giant magical explosions and huge swords etc etc.  This second series continues to tell a enjoyable story and I'll try and inform more people about this anime.  After season 2, this still remains one of my favorite anime which can hold its own for just being what it is, a great story to enjoy.",1317081600,4,1909,4.344632768361582
4518443,5,B0050UEVQO,What a great series.  It took a long time for season 2 to arrive but it was well worth the wait.  You are left feeling like there will be a season 3 to continue the journey because wolf has not arrived at her final destination.  The same voice actors are in this series and that makes it doubly good.  What is so enjoyable about this series is the journey and the towns that the main characters find themselves in.  The people are always different because the towns and items that are to be traded are different.  I do give it 5 stars because of the formation of the relationship and friendship that happens between Spice and Wolf and the complications of relationships with 2 people with their own agenda to reach.,1317081600,2,715,4.419847328244275
4518444,4,B0050UEVQO,"I really liked this series.  Although, I have to admit I liked the 1st season more than the 2nd season, but it was still entertaining.  Being a business person, I liked the focus on making money, but I felt that some of the dialogue was a bit too involved.  It just felt a little bit out of place with the story line.  I also felt this part was a bit rushed, and the final episode for the season seemed a little unsatisfying.  I'd like to see season 3, but judging by the final episode it was planned as if that might not be a possibility (though still leaving room for it).

Still, there was a lot to like, the characters were interesting and I think the artwork of the series is top notch.  If you found the first season to your liking, you will be delighted again.

I also was happy that there was a DVD/Blue-ray combo.  I still don't have a Blue-ray player and this helps make it feel like I'm not gonna have a ""VHS"" like version in a few years.  Given that I'm mainly paying for the content instead of the disc, I hope this is a long term trend in packaging.",1316908800,,1063,4.1414634146341465
4518445,5,B0050UEVQO,"Craft Lawrence and Holo. Holo and Craft Lawrence. The opportunistic merchant and the pagan wolf goddess. An anime based on business, trade and the dynamic between an immortal wolf changeling and a naive merchant - who would have thought it would be so addictive? This is one of my favorite series - and I'm usually the action, death and destruction, giant robot fan. But this one is just so unusual and so darn cute.  It's family friendly, realistic and as addictive as cotton candy.",1316649600,,483,4.75
4518446,5,B0050UEVQO,I love Spice and Wolf. It's nice to have an anime that is geared more towards adults and isn't about Japanese high school. The plot line is complex enough to keep me entertained over and over again. I've watched Season 1 about 4 times and plan to do the same with Season 2.,1316304000,,273,4.169811320754717
4518447,5,B0050UEVQO,"This, like the first season, is an itelligent piece of work. (I'm in to stocks, so I found the pyrite episodes amusing--just as I did the currency devaluation from the first season.) This season gets much deeper into the relationship between Holo and Lawrence, and does leave one wanting more. However, there will not likely be a third season (as of the date of this review), but this season closes at a point that doesn't leave one feeling disappointed. There are many cuts from the first season and the ""gratuitus"" fan service references are a joke (can ""Barbie doll"" images be considered fan service--has anyone seen Sekirei?)--anyway, it's not like it was random and just thrown in for lack of any substance in the storyline. Those images, as well as the cuts from the first season progress the storyline with poignant detail. Even though this season is not conclusive to the story, and dispite the lack of third season prospect, this is well worth watching.",1315612800,3,962,4.836363636363636
4518448,5,B0050UEVQO,Can't recommend Spice and Wolf enough! If you're the type of anime fan who enjoys falling in love with the characters and don't really need all the action or mecha and junk there destroying the storyline then Spice and Wolf is for you. Just make sure you watch the first season first!,1315612800,2,284,4.480769230769231
4518449,4,B0050UEVQO,"After having waited so long I was happy to finally see season 2. I could not have watched it because I loved season one so much. It was a small disappointment though as the animation as well as the english dub seemed just a bit less than season 1.

The story is continued in the same style as season 1 and nothing in season 2 damages the tale (tail? Harhar!), it is a bit more subdued as the writers resist the temptation to have Holo solve all of Lawrence's problems (though she would if he asked). Holo, though still devoted to Lawrence seems preoccupied with things in her past and worried that she will become the cause of grief to Lawrence though it's not exactly clear why. The writer seems to be pacing the story by the seasons with a winter snow and gray background ending the collection. It left me anxious about the future, feeling slightly cheated that it ended where it did and hoping that FUNI will release a season 3 more quickly than they did 2! It was not a very satisfying ending place.",1314921600,2,1003,4.363636363636363
8451917,3,B0050UEVQO,"Buyer beware. This is not in fact episode 13. It does not follow the events of Episode 12. Wolf and Amber Melancholy is in fact Season 2 Episode 0. It is unavailable on Hulu for some reason and is incorrectly listed in Season 2 on Amazon Video. Its plot comes before Wolf and an Inadvertent Rift, which is season 2 episode 1. It is mostly a rehash of season 1. Since this is only available on Amazon Video, I recommend watching it there, prior to watching the rest of season 2.",1522886400,,477,4.252747252747253

8451922,1,B0050UEVQO,"Worst Amazon offering for such a great story. English actors suck the life out of the characters. Please provide subbed, at least they connect with the characters.

I loved Wolf and Spice.
What has taken me for a ride is that Amazon only provides the dubbed of Season two. The English voice actors sadly have no acting ability. It feels like 1990's anime actors who just can't put emotion in with what is actually happening on screen. You'd think they. Oils have the actors maybe watch it subbed first so they can get in touch with the characters... couldn't take more than two minutes of poor acting, though every thing else is good. I have to rate it a 1 star... if you only get the first episode you'll understand why it's a bad buy. Get the DVD set like I now have done... better for your money.",1493769600,,799,4.398648648648648
