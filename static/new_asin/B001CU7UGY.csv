8289296,5,B001CU7UGY,"This is a fun series to watch especially around Halloween. Interesting ghost stories and filled with fun haunted facts! It's not HD quality and is from the early 2000's. Some (not all) have been burned on wrightable disks so they have generic sleeves as pictured (left) . Some have The original sleeve as pictured (right).All my disks have worked fine.
I wish History Channel still had documentaries like this. I have the entire collection and would recommend it!",1504137600,,463,4.948717948717949
8289297,5,B001CU7UGY,"The Key West Islands of Southern most Florida. Lots of ""Haunted History"" here including that of the main cemetery, the Key West Cemetery. Established in 1847 after an unsuccessful attempt at burying the ""deceased"" at or near a local beach in the sand. There is one famous ""guest"" that lays in an unmarked grave, to this day. In April, 1930, a woman known as Elena Hoyas checked herself into a hospital as she had similar symptoms of the deadly disease Tuberculosis. The doctor that ""saw"" her, ""Von Cosel"" became infatuated with the beauty and soon developed a love for her. She got X-Rays done, and it was confirmed that indeed she had the disease known as TB. Well, things didn't improve for the young Elena and she soon died of it on October 25, 1931. She was 22 years old at the time.
Von Cosel was grief stricken, but kept his ""undying love affair"" intact. With the permission of her immediate family members that were still alive, he built her a custom Mausoleum of which he could visit her anytime, any day. You see, he held the key to the crypt and would sit there inside the mausoleum for hours actually conversing with her, or what he believed in his mind was her.
One day he just couldn't face the fact that she wasn't coming back and would have to stay there, locked away inside a casket. He went back there one night, very early in the AM and took her casket from the Mausoleum. He took her back to his home and for 7 years, he had her at his home. Elena's family became suspicious and demanded Von Cosel show them her casket in the mausoleum. It was empty and they notified the police. They came and held Von Cosel on suspicion of keeping a deceased corpse. Well, statutes of limitations was apparently in effect, as no formal charges were brought against Von Cosel. Some people found sympathy, others did not. Von Cosel became ""black listed"" in the town and Elena's body was then reburied in an unmarked grave where only a few people knew where she was.
It is believed that Von Cosel came back to the cemetery and destroyed the mausoleum he had built for Elena with explosives. Later on, it was deemed that Von Cosel never even had an official doctor's license or the education diplomas that he said he took. He was deemed a fake, officially, and died a bitter man without ""his"" Elena at his side. (During those years he had her body, he reconstructed most, if not all of her surface skin and covered it with wax and tried his best at preserving her body.)
