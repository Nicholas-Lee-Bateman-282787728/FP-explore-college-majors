8031719,3,B0002TP8I8,"The first hour of this film is Eva photographing scenery.  There are no titles nor indications of what we are looking at.  Also, the films owners added Beethoven's Fifth -- heavy music that does not fit with the film whatsoever.  After that hour we arrive at the Berghof and see Adolf Hitler, and Eva's family and the film becomes interesting.  Eva's sister is married and there is a huge wedding celebration; many of the top Nazis.  We see the wedding banquet table -- where Adolf is noticeably absent.  Film of Hitler and his military at this reception shows him definitely being Der Fuhrer, and appearing very formal.  Now comes ""the best part"".  Eva took the camera and candidly filmed Adolf with the children.  Watch how he behaves.  He is seated and is very loving to them, and they respond very lovingly to him.  He is very relaxed with them and dotes on them.  Adolf Hitler is not posing for the camera; this is real.  It is hard to believe that this is the same man who killed millions of Jewish children.",1321920000,4,1014,4.535911602209945
