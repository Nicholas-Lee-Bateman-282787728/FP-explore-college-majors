1359006,3,B00004VVPF,"If you are in the right frame of mindlessness, ""Creature"" can be an outrageous film.  Nobody said this film was blockbuster entertainment, but from the moment Klaus Kinski appears, the film takes an unexpected turn into B sci-fi film hall of fame. The performances are adequate, especially Diane Salinger as Melanie the security officer. The special effects, for its budget, are great. And the creature does make a nightmarish impression. (Yes, I know the creature was featured in director, Bill Malone's earlier flick, ""Scared to Death"" and was recently used in ""Syngenor"".)  I liked this film better than ""Aliens"" and it's sequels. SO THERE!
I would have liked this Diamond DVD release better if the disc was in stereo and not mono. And why does Diamond DVD tout chapter selections, when you can't access that particular scene?",983923200,3,829,5.043795620437956
1359007,5,B00004VVPF,This might be the greatest movie I have ever seen in my whole entire life. It has the greatest special effects with an awesome story which makes it a classic.,963273600,3,158,4.3
1359018,5,B00004VVPF,"Not the greatest acting in the world but this is a good creepy suspenseful SciFi/Horror flick with a twist, and I wanted it in my collection.  I don't feel the need to compare it to Alien, if I wanted to compare it to anything it would have to be Mario Bava's ""Planet Of The Vampires"", and even that only loosely.  Good flick, glad to own it!  -kd5-",1285113600,,349,4.17910447761194
1359019,4,B00004VVPF,"""Creature"" is basically an 80's direct-to-video release with higher production values. It actually was shown in theaters but has more of a TV movie ""feel"" but with more sex and violence. This makes it a lot of fun if you don't expect a lot out of it. ""Creature"" would have been a prime candidate for MST3K if it had hung around longer. From a stylistic point of view I put it in the same league as ""Moontrap"" and other films of that ilk. Just like ""Moontrap"", ""Creature"" is raised by the performance of a couple of stars (in this case ""star""). Klaus Kinski is great as a German nutcase and his performance is far superior to that of anybody else in the movie. He actually is a breath of fresh air after all the stolid anti-acting that came before. It is almost like he accidentally walked on the set from a far better movie and just decided to go with it. As to the special effects, they are strictly ""80's TV movie"" quality. Not horrible but not even close to what Hollywood was cranking out in this era of ""mad slasher"" flicks. For all the faults, ""Creature"" is actually a very watchable film. It is fun to see how many movies they rip off and would make a great selection for ""bad movie night"". If you enjoy films like ""Laserblast"" and ""Moontrap"", this is your kind of movie.",1262908800,,1278,4.373949579831932
1359020,2,B00004VVPF,"""Creature"" is a 1984 monster-in-space movie with virtually no originality but plenty of terrible dialogue and special effects. The film is extremely derivative in almost every aspect: what recent monster or sci-fi movie doesn't make a guest appearance here? Certainly ""Alien"" and ""Jaws"" do, at least in spirit. (The conclusion's homage to ""Jaws"" is especially eye-rolling.)

The acting and especially dialogue are ghastly, although the actors really do try to work with what's been handed to them as best they can. The film starts with an interesting enough corporate intrigue angle (which unfortunately goes nowhere), and progresses to a guy in a rubber suit chasing the stars around cheesy sets in short order. There are a lot of diversions along the way (e.g. lots of hot soldering action, and Klaus Kinski as a creepy German), but it really boils down to the cast getting decimated by a creature that harkens back to other sci-fi creatures.

The film features special effects that vary from not bad to really appalling, but the content of the film is really the issue here, and it can never overcome its derivative nature and the fact that many other movies have trodden the same turf and have been much more entertaining.",1259539200,2,1226,4.975609756097561
1359021,1,B00004VVPF,"By Metal-Head-Ted ( Karyn's Husband)

Oh my God. Can a movie get this bad? The answer is yes. Simply re-cycle the 'Alien' story and throw in a hot chick and Klaus Kinski and you've got 'Creature': A low-budget disaster taking place in the deepest part of space. There is a reason you'll find this gem sitting on the bottom of the
""3 for $5.00"" bin at your local video store. Everything is cheesy in this one and the only exciting scenes are the nude girl and the 'Man-In-The-Creature-suit' which was shot exposing the stuntman's real arms as he grabs one of the actors (The stuntman is seen wearing the 'claws' of the reptilian creature, but then we see his own hairy arms!) I'm surprised the director left his name on this one. A usual Hollywood dirty trick is to remove your own name and replace it with the fictional name 'Alan Smithee' if the film is stolen from you or it turns out this bad.",1243468800,3,896,4.430303030303031
1359022,5,B00004VVPF,THIS MOVIE IS SWEET I GIVE IT 5 STARS JUST FOR THE PSYCHO MONSTER !!!!! YAY,1231718400,,75,3.75
1359023,2,B00004VVPF,"Low budget and low production values don't always equate to a bad movie. This time it does. It's not the cheap special effects or cinematography that gets this one down. It's the important stuff like scripting and execution that pulled this one down. If certain things were done differently this could actually have been a pretty good movie. Unfortunately that's not the case.

First and foremost flaw in this flounder of a film is how it was put together. Sure it has a rather clichd plot, however there were some interesting aspects that could have been explored had the makers of this film put more thought in the script and structure. You have little things happening that lend very little to the overall plot yet take up all of your attention. Don't even get me started on the backstory of Creature, which also takes up your attention only to give absolutely nothing to the plot.

Low budget special effects can be forgiven to a certain degree. Things like laser and electricity blasts, spaceship models and set design can only go so far with a limited cash flow. Most of the special effects for this film aren't bad for its category. The glaring exception is the creature that this movie is named after. You would think that such a pivotal thing would have gotten better attention. The creature is laughable close up. Sure they did what they can and hide it in shadows for most of the film, but in the end once you see this thing you will roll on the floor laughing instead of having your heart filled with dread.

The acting I have no problem with. The actors did their roles as best they could with the limited scope.  The characters themselves were bland and two-dimensional (when they have any dimension at all). Music is serviceable and the sound effects are mostly noises taken from other shows (a fun game to play could be Name-that-Special-Effect when watching). Of course the technical things aren't really painful to watch, but when you add that to the bad script and even worse monster it starts to add up.

Not much to see here folks. If you like bad B-movie style outer space monster flicks then this one is just par for the course. For the rest of you who prefer more substance you can steer clear of Creature without missing anything. Of course there is some camp value, but not as much as other films. Something could have been made out of this premise, but that didn't happen.",1204070400,2,2399,4.608899297423887
1359024,3,B00004VVPF,"Decent acting, decent script, appalling special effects. I'd have given this little gore fest two stars but for the graces of Klaus Kinski. I loved him here. From his interesting introduction in the film to his glorious ending. Ah well -- if only the rest of it kept pace with him.

OK, we have the ship landing and discovering a wreck. With the wreck are,say, zoo specimens. Since they've been there for a long time you'd think they'd all be dead. Not so. One of the little buggers gets out and begins to rip into the crew. Now there are a few really scary scenes and at least one that will make you shudder: the one where the man calls his mates and tells them all is well, come back, ""I want to go home""....the call ends, his head turns and there's an alien leech thing sucking away at the side of his head. Creepy.

In a film of this sort I don't know what can be considered gratuitous when it comes to violence and gore. That is really what this movie is about. It's a horror movie about an alien infesting a crew. On the other hand, there is some really unnecessary nudity. A good looking girl (why is it NEVER a man?) tempts her boyfriend out by appearing completely nude. Why? Theyd been in love. He thought she was dead. ANY appearance by her would have resulted in the same actions by him.

The downfall of the film comes when you can really see the alien. Poorly done by a guy in a monster outfit, very disappointing. (I just saw WAR OF THE WORLDS again and totally admired it's three legged creepies. I wish the alien in CREATURE had been even a quarter as good.) Truly, among all the accusations of Alien ripoffs (and maybe it is) this is not a bad movie. The only thing that really kills it is this lousey monster.

Other than that, it's watchable. Not a bad way to spend the afternoon or snickering at Klaus' lack of respect for any kind of authority.",1161475200,2,1866,4.3076923076923075
1359025,3,B00004VVPF,"Not Horribe; actually watchable on a night when you don't feel like going out and don't want to see a good sci fi movie, but something with some not too good effects so you can laugh.  And what about Bryce (Diane Sallinger), it would have been good to see her character in a different movie.",1148860800,,291,4.290909090909091
1359026,3,B00004VVPF,"I saw this movie as a kid and it scared me. After a while of leaving it in my basement(I have it on VHS) I brought it up with a bunch of other movies and decided to watch them again. Like Planet Of The Dinosaurs it didn't completely smash my memories. It's pretty serviceable as a movie and yes I know people say it's an Alien clone but I(for some reason) have never seen alien nor do I particularly want to. This movie is good though and it still make's me shut up about how bad the acting is or ""omg that is so a toy"" when  something scary happens(that's my failsafe for scary movie's) and actually get into it. The camera angle's sometime's hit something for me as do the character's. They just fit so perfectly into the atmosphere. A good movie still make's you cry,laugh,shiver,freak out or get behind your mama's skirt even though you know EXACLTY what's going to happen and this movie still has part's like that for me. For under five buck's and on dvd get this just to either watch or force your friend's to watch.^^",1143504000,2,1024,4.333333333333333
1359027,3,B00004VVPF,"This is a great cheesy movie.  It lags a bit through the middle but provides some good laughs all around if you are interested in bad special effects and silly sci-fi plots.  Also, the packaging is one of those thin cardboard sleeves found at Dollar Store DVD selections.  Don't expect quality, though it's good for a few cheap laughs.

I initially got this DVD because I am a huge Klaus Kinski fan, though it doesn't contain much of that fierce energy found in many of his movies.  He's pretty out of his element here in a low point of his career.

There are several totally pointless and un-arousing boob shots, cheesy one-liners, and a poor demonstration of camera techniques.  I got it for (...) a very reasonable (and justifiably low) price.  Well worth it;)",1113177600,3,763,4.641791044776119
1359038,3,B00004VVPF,"This 1985 SciFi/Horror film is poorly made. The acting isn't that great (Klaus Kinski is particularly bad), the writing and directing is only mediocre, as is the editing, the story at times makes little sense, and it is shot poorly. But there is something about it that makes you really enjoy the film. There is plenty of suspense, horror, action, violence, and some nudity. It is one of those films that Alien spawned. Not as good of a movie, but one I think you'll enjoy anyway. Quite frankly, this is one of those bad movies that I like regardless.",1079654400,3,551,4.575757575757576
1359039,3,B00004VVPF,"I have never seen a rip-off movie try so hard to be original. Director William Malone sure tries hard, in both his directing and his script, but still fails to show any originality. Everything fromt he female lead to the actual design of the creature itself is a direct steal from Alien. With that said I have to say that Creature is actually one of the better Alien rip-offs that I have seen, and believe me there are plenty of Alien rip-offs out there. Most are very poor (Star Crystal and Dead Space come to mind), and though Creature itself isn't a great film, it actually comes out as one of the better of the bunch. Most of the cast actually try to pull this film off, especially the Stan Ivar and Wendy Schaal, but a few of the cast members come off looking really bad in the acting department. And what about Klaus Kinski? THat man was considered a great actor in his time, so what is he doing in Creature? Whatever the reason, I was still glad to see him and his short but memorable presence brings the film up in quality level. So is Creature a good film? No. Is it cheesy? Yes, though it tries hard not to be. Is it entertaining? You bet. A great midnight film that deserves a proper DVD release. Diamond Entertaiment gives us a nicely priced disc but the picture quality is only slightly better than the original VHS release from Media Home Video. Though the image isn't the best, it is far from unwatchable, and it can make a great entry into any sci-fi fans DVD library.
TRIVIA: THe film ahd a budget of $4 million and was titled The Titan Find in other parts of the world. The special effects crew went on to do the special effects for Aliens a year after working on creature. (I guess Creature was good practice for them)",1075680000,20,1737,4.3476923076923075
1359040,3,B00004VVPF,"Creature is a half-way decent Alien clone filmed on a small budget, decent models and with some space suits lifted from 2001. Released a year before Aliens, I caught this film on video and found it enjoyable. The plot centers on a rescue mission that is stranded on Titan after a landing mishap, they then search for survivors from previous expeditions and discover a really [upset] creature with a knack for using dead bodies as zombie slaves. The cast is largely forgettable save for Klaus Kinski and Diane Salinger who steals the show as a tough and very sexy looking security officer. The DVD is pretty basic with little if any features; it is not widescreen and has a mono track. Yet get what you pay for and I would not recommend paying more then [price] for this film. One of the better Alien clones, I like this one because Diane Salinger is so sexy in her black leather uniform and cool laser rifle.",1025481600,3,908,4.5426829268292686
1359041,3,B00004VVPF,"First off, anyone who picks up a cheepie DVD from Diamond Entertainment should know that you'll only get four scene selections and little to no supplemental material, which is forgivable because the price tag is usually right on for what you're getting.  ""Creature"" is a bad, corny, laughable ""Alien"" clone complete with a guy in a rubber monster suit and a nondescript cast, cheap sets, and an atrocious script.  I'm actually sort of on the fence about how much I like/dislike the film...  One thing I can't object to, though, is Klaus Kinski's deliciously smarmy (and all too brief) performance as a stranded astronaut; it's a fine testament to his acting ability that he could lend credibility to the highest 'art film' and the lowliest B-movies.  Aside from that, there are some neat special effects (although I'm not sure I believe the claim that they were done by the same group that did ""Aliens"") and T&A to keep your attention.",1012176000,,935,4.825
1359042,1,B00004VVPF,"This was a great movie, it deserves a better release. The picture is horrible on this disc. but, if you still want to see it you can get it. I would wait until Anchor bay releases it, if ever. but it still has a great story of sci-fi fantasy throughout.",1011225600,11,253,4.08

For a campy ALIEN ripoff it's a good tongue in cheek movie that can be pretty intense. The Alien Creature uses the astronauts as bait to draw in the others for the kill--usually NUDE WOMEN!

1359044,2,B00004VVPF,"I first saw this movie on TV when I was a young teen, and remembered it as being scary.  With that in mind, I purchased Creature hoping to relive the exprience.
I am sorry to say that I was grievously disappointed.  Two of the male characters were really hurting for a haircut.  THe movie came out in the mid eighties, I remeber long hair being out even then.
THe dialouge and special effects were cheezy, and the acting ranged from poor to fair.
I guess I must have been tired the night I watched this film in the late eighties, that's why it appeared to be scary.
I gave Creature two stars, however, because it had one or two geunine scares. I guess I'll have to wait until I'm really tired again to enjoy this film now.  That's if I don't fall to sleep first.",992822400,4,762,4.23448275862069

However this movie is so bad it's ...well, BAD!  It is a cheap rip off of Alien, and the plot is thinner than wet tissue.  The characters bicker at one another for no aparant reason, and the script doesnt explain, who or what or why these crew members are invoved here?

1359046,3,B00004VVPF,"William Malone did everything but star in this movie.  He wrote it, he produced it, and he directed it.  And it's not bad, either.  The cast is good -- Klaus Kinski, as the leering Hofner, who has the hots for the cold, gun-toting security officer Bryce, played by Diane Salinger, and Marie Laurin as the hapless Susan, who has a nifty long nude scene, stand out, but the rest are good enough, too -- and the script has some good lines and chilling scenes.  The special effects are perfectly adequate for a modestly budgeted film like this.  All in all, not a bad evening's diversion.
And you can't beat the price!  You can't expect much in the way of bonus features at this level and you don't get much.  Just a 4-Chapter scene access, a list of other Diamond Entertainment features, a little background on the movue, and a mini-biography of Kinski.  The image quality on this DVD is pretty good and the sound is OK, although it sometimes overpowers the dialog.

7924264,3,B00004VVPF,"Since the dawn of time, as far as B goes, the creature feature has always been a favorite among the masses. Really what isn't delightful about some monster creeping around tearing people apart? Now obviously Death Ring is the perfect movie ever created, but imagine that extra level if one of the hunters was a bloodthirsty monster. If Vachs had some caged up creature released to hunt down Mike Norris we don't know what would have happened. Even the dynamic on-screen duo of Norris and Swayze may have not even been enough to overcome that factor. Of course if Skylord came with his one grenade they may have stood a chance. But we digress, this review isn't about the greatest movie of all time. It's about a sub par sci-fi B from 1985 called Creature. No it's not the Creature movie starring coach either.

Creature takes place entirely on a spaceship on a mission to examine ancient artifacts. Once they arrive on the distant planet they discover a Russian ship, the S.S Drago, that has been abandoned. Well actually not abandoned. Turns out the Ruskies were all ripped apart by some unknown creature sporting some sweet telepathic powers. Yeah awesome! The creature can really mind which anyone with his sweet mindgames. As he lures each crew member one by one they don't stand a chance. Poor bastards never saw it coming. The creature will mess you up for the rest of your life. The creature is your run of the mill alien deal, but still pretty cool. Dim lighting and cheap fabric...now that's how you move merchandise.

Despite our confusing synopsis the movie was an average viewing experience. Not the best or the worst like Slippery Pete, but was good...lets say good like Shlomo. We're always a sucker for a poorly made alien monster no matter how poor the film turns out to be. The unfortunate part was the ever present lack of the monsters on screen performance. These movies must realize one thing...that you're B! Stop trying to build up some intricate plot and great acting because it's not happening. Just give us an hour of loin lashing creature action. The actors barely even need to speak, unless we're dealing with a B legend like Don Swayze. That's one of the few exceptions.",1306800000,,2198,4.721354166666667
