4834255,4,B005M5OSB0,"I have read and watched just about every variation of the series since its introduction in the 1980's.  Transformers Prime is by the far the best telling of the transformers story to date, it combines canon material with original ideas to create a compelling story line for all ages.  I would recommend this to anyone with even a fleeting interest in the Transformers.  The voice acting is excellent and the computer animation is par with the feather films, I also greatly enjoyed the new title sequence that took the original G1 start and improved on it with the help of CG.

I hope they live up to what I have read and continue this series through it's third season, and I look forward to adding the DVD's to my collection.

4834259,4,B005M5OSB0,"What comes to mind when you think of ""Transformers"" in the last decade? Pain, disappointment, misery, loathing, nausea, Sam Witwicky, giant Decepticon testicles...

But one good thing has come from the cesspool of frat-boy wretchedness that Michael Bay has produced: ""Transformers Prime,"" a series that takes the appearance of the big-budget movies... but actually has dignity, an overarcing plot, and focuses more on the giant robots. ""Transformers: Prime - Darkness Rising"" is the five-episode miniseries that began the long-running animated series, and despite some flaws (Miko) it's a solid springboard to the story.

There are two groups of shapeshifting alien robots on Earth -- the Autobots and the Decepticons. Guess which ones are the villains. While the Decepticons dwell on a starship in space, the Autobots live in an old military bunker in the wilds of Nevada.

 When an Autobot is captured and executed by the Decepticons, three teenagers accidentally get caught in the crossfire -- tiny nerd Raf, responsible Jack, and clueless Miko. Since the Autobots are supposed to be a secret (except to their government liarson, Bill Fowler), this is a bit upsetting to them. But the Autobot leader Optimus Prime believes that now the Decepticons will target the kids, so he decides to keep them in their base.

Then the Decepticon leader Megatron returns to Earth -- and he's brought Dark Energon, a substance that can revive living machines as ravening zombies. Even regular machines can be transformed into dangerous creatures by it. Optimus Prime soon realizes what Megatron is planning -- to raise an army of undead Transformers on their dead home planet of Cybertron, and then transport them to Earth.

""Transformers Prime - Darkness Rising"" is a pretty solid start to a series -- well-written, fast-paced, and doing a good job of introducing the characters. And while the Bay movies are used as an artistic template (Bumblebee's lack of speech, the character designs), it shares no actual connections to the story. Instead, we're served up mechanical zombies, space-gates and the promise of a larger story to come.

And with only a few episodes, ""Darkness Rising"" manages to convey a real sense of history and epic conflict. A lot of this comes from the brief sojourn on Cybertron, a dead husk of a planet overrun with insectile vermin and the corpses of the Autobot fallen. Furthermore, the inclusion of starships and space-bridges get across just how far the Autobot/Decepticon war has ranged. While there are some moments of humor, it's overall a pretty serious story, with some moments of harrowing violence (the murder of Cliffjumper, and his resurrection as a crazed zombie).

The biggest problem is probably the kids. Human characters are the weakness of every Transformers story, and these are no exception -- Raf and Jack are bland but likable enough, but Miko is a ""quirky"" teen girl as written by a team of men who have probably never even met one. She is violently annoying, and serves no purpose in the story except to stupidly cause complications in already-disastrous situations.

However, the other characters are pretty decent. Optimus can be rather pompous, providing contemplative speeches at every possible opportunity, but is pretty admirable. Then there is a warm-hearted Bumblebee, the prickly Arcee, rough but kindly Bulkhead, and the perpetually irritable Ratchet (played by the always-excellent Jeffrey Combs), who thinks the humans REALLY shouldn't be hanging around the Autobots.

""Transformers Prime - Darkness Rising"" is a solid start to a solid series -- while it has some flaws (MIKO!) it's an intriguing and well-developed miniseries. And it only gets better from here.",1419811200,,3713,5.204355108877722

4834266,5,B005M5OSB0,"If you're relatively new to the Transformers experience and looking for the perfect kid-friendly feature-length introduction to the world-renowned ""robots in disguise"" and the franchise's new ""Aligned"" continuity family in particular (the same continuity family as the video games ""Transformers: War for Cybertron"" & ""Transformers: Fall of Cybertron"", the novels ""Transformers: Exodus"", ""Transformers: Exiles"" & ""Transformers: Retribution"" and the new Flash-animated kid-focused series ""Transformers: Rescue Bots""; basically it cherry-picks all the best stuff from every continuity - describing each character as a mix of traits from each continuity - thus far, from Generation 1 through the Bayverse films and Animated, and is now THE basis for the future of Transformers storytelling, compared to the first 25 years of the franchise lore - which was created on the fly, with continuity reboots common and deep-rooted mythology established after the storytelling had already begun), then look no further than ""Transformers: Prime - Darkness Rising"", now available on DVD from SHOUT! Factory.

If you're a longtime fan of the original series, then, my friends, you're in for a real treat because Peter Cullen and Frank Welker have reprised the voice-over roles that made them household names in the 1980's: Cullen's performance as Optimus Prime stills carries the calm, dignified sadness inspired by his late brother Larry, a former Marine who fought in the Vietnam War (""Peter, don't be a Hollywood hero, be a real hero. Real heroes don't yell and act tough; they are tough enough to be gentle, so control yourself."") - as if the Great War has affected Optimus so deeply that he's always crying deep down inside - and Welker's new version of everyone's favorite bucket-headed bad boy Megatron sounds quieter, much more menacing and nowhere near the bombastic, raspy-voiced, loud-mouthed ham that the original was, though as the series goes on, he does have his moments.

There's one constant throughout the franchise that helps viewers connect with the Autobots: a group of humans (usually kids, in this case Jackson Darby, voiced by Josh Keaton from The Spectacular Spider-Man; Miko Nakadai, voiced by Tania Gunadi from Disney Channel's Aaron Stone; and Rafael Esquivel, voiced by Andy Pessoa from The Amazing Spider-Man) who not only learn their secret and help in their fight against the Decepticons in any small way but help them adapt to life on Earth in their off-hours (a classic example from Generation 1 has Spike Witwicky teaching the Autobots how to play basketball; even Optimus gets in on the slam-dunking action), and the way the 'Bots connect with the kids over the course of this movie helps set the tone for the series:

Bumblebee & Raf, being the youngest of their respective age groups (and, as such, the series' kid-appeal characters), hit it off right away, especially when you consider that Raf is the only kid present who can understand the Autobot scout's R2-D2-style beeps, squeals and whistles.

Bulkhead (Kevin Michael Richardson) may be the team's heavy hitter (as a former Wrecker, it kinda comes with the territory), but when it comes to Miko, he's as gentle with her as an elephant plucking a wildflower with its trunk.

After a shaky start, Arcee (Sumalee Montano from The Young and the Restless, among others) & Jack are soon tearing it up through the Nevada backroads; ultimately, when he decides to walk away after helping rescue Special Agent William Fowler (the Autobots' liaison with the U.S. government; voiced by Ernie Hudson from Ghostbusters) from Starscream (Steve Blum from Wolverine & the X-Men), she gets him to come back to the fight, as the following dialogue from Part 5 indicates:

Jack: Arcee, really, Miko already tried. Tell Optimus I respect him big-time, but if you're at war with the Decepticons, there's nothing I can do to help.
Arcee: Optimus didn't send me, and no one's asking for your help.
J: Okay, so if we both agree that I'm not warrior material -
A: Jack, I just lost someone I cared about. Maybe it's the grief talking; maybe you're growing on me; whatever it is, I'm just not ready to say goodbye.

In the end, he finds in her the guiding spirit of the big sister he's always needed, despite what the shippers out there may think, and by film's end it's pretty clear that he's not ready to say goodbye, either.

At first, Ratchet (Jeffrey Combs from Re-Animator) doesn't want anything to do with the kids, but as time goes on, he comes to understand what they have to offer Team Prime from a civilian (and human) standpoint, and eventually he connects best with the equally tech-savvy Raf.

And last, but certainly far from least, there's Optimus Prime himself: as the leader, whatever the series or continuity (for the sake of this review, I'm omitting Shattered Glass), he strives to be a positive male role model and father figure not just for his team but for any humans aiding them in their fight against the 'Cons, and it's no different with Jack, Miko & Raf (in Season 1's ""Masters & Students"", he sees the school science fair as an excellent opportunity for his team and the kids to learn more about each others' home-world and culture). Also, it doesn't hurt to practice a little diplomacy by trying to convince the Decepticon du jour to stray from Megatron's path and either side with the Autobots or lead the 'Cons toward peace (Skyquake - voiced by Richard Green - and his split-spark twin brother Dreadwing - voiced by Tony Todd, aka The Fallen from ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" - have no real grudge against the Autobots but are loyal to Megatron above all else). However, one can only push the Big O so far before he starts pushing - and eventually hitting - back - Megatron ultimately proved that he was beyond all hope of redemption in ""One Shall Fall"" (and the compilation movie ""One Shall Stand"") after he almost killed Raf, resulting in Optimus realizing just how foolish he was to believe that the Autobots and Decepticons would find a way to bury the hatchet and end the war peacefully; the tone of Optimus's voice before the fight begins (""Megatron, today you answer for your crimes against Cybertron and against humanity!"") tells the audience that this isn't the last son of the Primes speaking: this is a battle-hardened warrior whose every punch, kick, gunshot and swing of his sword is fueled by a potent & explosive cocktail of the Matrix of Leadership and the rage felt by a dad going after the bully who's been hurting his children, and HE IS PISSED!

As the movie (and the series) progresses, however, we're given a harsh reminder of something that's easy to forget in this post-9/11 world: whether it's being waged in our own backyards, overseas or a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away (yes, a deliberate nod to STAR WARS), there's absolutely, positively NOTHING glorious about war - it ruins the lives of everyone caught in the crossfire, it tears families apart, and it's fought for the stupidest reasons. Also, as befitting the ""Transformers"" franchise, we're reminded that while the Autobots and Decepticons may be tough, they're not invincible - Optimus, his team and their liaisons with the U.S. government learn this the hard way after the death of Cliffjumper (voiced by none other than Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) by Starscream's hand, or rather, talon, proving the trend established by executive producer Jeff Kline: once a character is killed off, they stay dead, and Dark Energon-fueled zombie resurrections don't count. Needless to say, the Decepticon heavies (some of whom turn out to be, at the least, more honorable than Megatron - a trait inherited from Dinobot in ""Transformers: Beast Wars"" and Starscream's portrayal in ""Transformers: Armada"") don't fare much better through the series: Skyquake gets ripped apart in midair by Bumblebee and forced into a crash landing in ""Masters & Students"", Breakdown (Adam Baldwin from Halo 3: ODST, for starters) is butchered by Airachnid (Gina Torres from Firefly) in Season 2's ""Crossfire"", Hardshell (David Kaye, aka the voice from Megatron from Beast Wars, Beast Machines and the Unicron Trilogy) gets his tailpipe handed to him by Miko in ""Hurt"", and Dreadwing is gunned down by Megatron before he can kill Starscream in ""Regeneration"".

Speaking of Dark Energon, once Megatron reveals just what the ""Blood of Unicron the Chaos-Bringer"" can do (in this case, bring a dead Cybertronian back to life and turn it into a mindless zombie berserker), the genius (or rather, insanity) of his latest plan to conquer Earth becomes apparent: he intends to send a big hunk of the stuff to Cybertron via the SpaceBridge, raise an army of the planet's dead, bring them back to Earth and usher in the ultimate zombie apocalypse.

Presentation: every frame of this 1:46:19 adventure (created by editing the 5-part inaugural miniseries into a feature-length movie and removing all the scene repeats & commercial break fade-outs), from the opening shot of Cliffjumper to the closing shot of the Autobots & the kids riding off into the sunset as Optimus delivers his closing monologue, is presented in glorious 16:9 Widescreen, and comes with your choice of sound: English 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround or English stereo (turns out the Spanish stereo label was a misprint), all beautifully reinforced by a score composed by Brian Tyler and recorded by the Slovak National Symphony Orchestra, Allan Wilson conducting - a fitting tip of the hat to the scores composed for the live-action trilogy by Steve Jablonsky and recorded by Nick Glennie-Smith conducting the Hollywood Studio Symphony. In short, the sound and picture quality are on par with the series proper (I'm one of those middle ground completionists who's bought both the compilation movies and the season sets - as of this latest edit, I've bought every Stateside DVD release, including the Target-exclusive ""Dawn of the Beast"").

In the end, whatever the genre, wherever or whenever it's set, the lesson at the heart of every story about the never-ending battle between good and evil is clearly in play here, and it's as old as time itself: life, love, courage, hope and the light are, and forever will be, infinitely stronger than death, hate, fear, despair and the darkness.",1379116800,2,10296,5.003502626970228

4834274,4,B005M5OSB0,"""Transformers"", the popular entertainment franchise that many generations have grown up with, may it be playing with the toys or watching the animated series back in 1984, playing the video games or reading the comic books.

Needless to say, since the early '80s, millions have experienced ""Transformers"", especially in recent years with the release of film trilogy or the animated series which continues to air on television and of course, the many toys that continue to be popular with collectors and also children.

But within the last three years, fans have watched the animated series known as ""Transformers Animated"" becoming the latest ""Transformers"" animated series to be showcased on television beginning in 2007 and would last for three seasons through 2009.

Fans knew that there will be a newer version of the series coming out, but the question is what kind of series?

In 2010, the video game ""Transformers: War of Cybertron"" was released and was a well-received by gamers but also video game critics and it was revealed that the upcoming animated series would be set in the same universe as the video game.

And then by November 2010, Hasbro unveiled ""Transformers: Prime"", a CG animated television series which would air on The Hub and would first begin with a five-episode mini-series.  And with one season having now been completed in 2011, a second season is set to air in 2012.

And it's this latest series that has been creating a lot of buzz among fans and viewers.  With the CG animation and slightly darker storyline, the series would go on to win a Daytime Emmy Award for ""Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation"" for background design and color design.

As many fans have waited for a video release of ""Transformers: Prime"", fortunately, Shout! Factory has decided to release ""Transformers: Prime - Darkness Rising"", a year after its premiere.  The DVD would featuring all five-episodes combined to make an uninterrupted movie.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Transformers: Prime - Darkness Rising"" is presented in widescreen format.  The CG animation for this film is absolutely wonderful as we can see details on the metal of various robots.  You can see scratches on the metal, the reflection of light and also glass windows and the reflection.

From Optimus Prime's glass windows on his chest showcasing reflections to Megatron's steel body and also the damage on the overall body of Cliffjumper, I was quite pleased with how this series looks!  But also detail is featured in the overall scenery as well.

While I do feel the robots are much better looking than the humans, in terms of detail and overall look, I do like the characters designs on the three human characters, it just that they look a bit rubbery for me.

But overall, great detail and lighting for this TV series for DVD and hopefully Shout! Factory will consider giving ""Transformers: Prime - Darkness Rising"" the HD treatment in the near future.

As for audio, dialogue is presented in English and Spanish Dolby Digital stereo and dialogue is clear and understandable.  The voice acting is terrific and the fact that voice talent Peter Cullen (Optimus Prime) and Frank Welker (Megatron) of the original ""Transformers"" animated series are back for this series...Fantastic!

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Transformers Prime: Darkness Rising"" comes with the following special feature:

  A Look at Character Design - (5:00) Character design sketches for ""Transformers Prime"".
  A Look at Set Design - (4:31) Featuring the sketches and finalized backgrounds and set design for ""Transformers Prime"".
  Animatic for Episode 1 - (22:07) Sketch animatics for episode 1.

EXTRAS:

""Transformers: Prime - Darkness Rising"" comes with a slipcover case.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Is ""Transformers: Prime - Darkness Rising"" possibly the best ""Transformers"" animated series yet!  Well, I know that question is quite subjective but in terms of overall look and storyline, this latest series is action-packed and definitely will captivate viewers of all ages.

While the storylines of ""Transformers"" tends to change from series to series, the storyline of a battle between Autobots and the Decepticons still remains.  Especially Optimus Prime vs. Megatron... And with every new series, you often wonder how the writers will keep the series fresh, especially for every new generation that has just become a Transformers fan.

I've literally grown up with the series, collected the toys and then to watch my son become a Transformers fan (his first was ""Transformers: Cybertron"" followed by Shout! Factory's awesome release of the original series on DVD) and now watching him enjoy ""Transformers: Prime"".

With this latest series, what I enjoy about it is that there are not so many robots thrown into each episode.  Several years ago,  ""Transformers: Cybertron"", an animated series that would throw in so many robots and while it was great for the toyline, with so many characters, it could get a bit confusing.

This time around, going by a similar theme of the previous""Transformers Animated"" series, the series focuses on five primary Autobots and staying with the recurring theme of humans who go on to help the group in someway or form.

But the first 5-10 minutes of ""Transformers: Prime"" makes things clear that this is not the same type of series that many of us have grown up with.  This time around, robots...do get killed and destroyed in battle.  And while the humans will never be put in any major life threatening danger for a children's animated series, still, ""Transformers: Prime"" definitely has some darker elements.

And as mentioned earlier, the CG animation for this series is great!  Typically, there are a lot of shortcuts taken on TV series but the creators of the series definitely made sure there is a lot of detail on both the Autobots and Decepticons but also various objects and environments.  So, it was more than I expected for an animated series as ""Transformers: Prime"" is possible the most ambitious animated series yet.

In fact, the acting is also well done for this series and what I was surprised was how many big names they brought in to do voices for the characters.  Legendary Optimus Prime voice actor Peter Cullen and legendary Megatron voice actor Frank Welker (""G.I. Joe"", ""Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends"") are back.  They are joined by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson (of WWE fame and ""Fast Five"") as Cliffjumper,  Steve Blum (Logan/Wolverine for ""X-Men"") as Starscream and Ernie Hudson (""Oz"", ""Ghostbusters"") as Agent Fowler.  But for any longtime ""Transformers"" fan, the fact that Cullen and Welker are back to do the voices for Optimus and Megatron is fantastic!

But the series definitely sets the storyline for the exciting first season of ""Transformers: Prime"" (which I hope Shout! Factory releases on DVD as well).

Overall, If you haven't caught the five episode mini-series before or are not familiar with the latest ""Transformers"" animated series, I highly recommend ""Transformers: Prime - Darkness Rising"". It's full of action, excitement and it looks so darn awesome!  And for me, it's possibly the best ""Transformers"" animated series yet!

And because this DVD is coming out right in time before the children's winter vacation, if you're looking for a safe DVD to keep your kids occupied during a long commute or for their vacation, or you are an adult who is young at heart and is still passionate for this long-running ""Transformers"" franchise, ""Transformers: Prime - Darkness Rising"" is definitely recommended!",1335571200,6,7526,5.10874897792314
4834275,5,B005M5OSB0,"I grew up watching what is now called the ""First Generation"" of Transformers in the 1980's.  Whenever new generations or spinoffs of Transformers have been released since the first generation, I've always been skeptical and I usually have ended up being disappointed.

NOT this time! This is a great show for Transformers fans of all ages.

One recommendation, I bought this before the entire first season was released on DVD (this is just the first five episodes of season one - a mini-movie introducing the show).  Instead of buying this, I would spend a little more and get the entire first season of episodes - you'll be happy you did!",1331769600,23,639,4.781818181818182
4834276,2,B005M5OSB0,"Zombies are introduced to the Transformers universe with Transformers Prime: Darkness Rising. In fact, that is the whole plot of this mini-series. Megatron has found a way to turn dead Transformers into zombies, and he starts with the recently killed Cliffjumper, who then, in typical zombie fashion, goes on a rampage until Megatron slices him in half and kicks his remains over a ledge. So if you are thinking of getting this for younger Transformer fans, you might want to think again. I personally am not opposed to a darker, grittier look at Transformers, but the undead is a little over the top. I was never a big fan of the Night of the Living Dead style movies, and don't particularly care for it in the Transformers universe.

A human being tortured is also introduced to the realm of Tranformers, which is another reason why this is not a series for all ages, as some reviewers suggest.

Below are some additional thoughts, good and bad, about the series so far:

This series came across as a mixture of Transformers Animated and the movie franchise. Not necessarily a bad thing, but not as original as it could have been.

Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime is always a good thing.

With the exception of Starscream, the Transfomer designs were all exceptional.

A Megatron that is actually menacing is always a good thing too.

The quality of the animation is disappointing. The people at Big Idea (Veggie Tales) do a better job with CGI.

Miko comes across as a more annoying version of Sari from Animated.",1328832000,3,1514,4.730038022813688

4834278,5,B005M5OSB0,"Transformers Prime is one of the best,action packed,new Transformers series since the G1 days! For starters all the main characters like Optimus,Megatron,Bumblebee,Starscream,and Arcee are amazing looking in robot or vehicle modes. I would like to see Bumblebee actually talk again,but this dosen't take away from how cool this series is. The characters and storylines pull you in from start to finish with great anticipation for the next episode. This is a vast improvement over the animated series done earlier. This is a great series for long time transformer fans and new fans just getting into transformers. The human characters of Raf,Miko,and Jack compliment the series very well and intrigate very well into the story lines along with their autobot counterparts. This edition is the first five episodes put together into one movie to kickstart the series into gear. Also Arcee looks the best she ever has in the series and kick's some major ass all around. Bottom line  Transformers Prime is one kick-ass series that all transformer fans should give a try. Transformers Rule!!!",1326067200,8,1085,5.235632183908046
4834279,5,B005M5OSB0,"I like this DVD as they put the mini-series in movie format, so it plays as one whole movie and not in 5 episodes. This feature was added to the 25th Anniversary Edition DVDs of the G1 series as well. This is my son's favorite show right now, next to his G1 DVD's.",1324944000,,264,4.0
4834280,5,B005M5OSB0,"Having been a Transformers fan since the 80s, I was excited about the new series. Transformers Prime takes what was best about the Generation 1 series and the Beast Wars Transformers series and mixes it with the much more mature take on the Tranformers from the movies to create a show that, not only delivers on all the thrills and action, delivers more on a human level as well.  Transformers Prime: Darkness Rising is, basically, the five episode miniseries that appeared before the first full season of Transformers Prime. Call it more of a pilot miniseries for the show, if you will. Only this is made into one single movie for you to watch.

In Transformers Prime: Darkness Rising; the Autobots find themselves once again protecting Earth from Megatron who has acquired a powerful element giving him control over life.

I'm sure that diehard Tranformers fans out there may have already written this show off but what they don't know is this may well be the best Tranformers show, ever. The way they do the show makes you believe. I've been a Transformers fan since the 80's(I'm 44 now) and this show delivers everything that makes the Transformers the way they are.",1323388800,2,1171,4.787128712871287
4834281,4,B005M5OSB0,"Paul Pritchard, DVD Verdict --This DVD release of Transformers Prime: Darkness Rising seamlessly edits the five episode miniseries that appeared before the first full season into a single movie. As usual, the story still revolves around the battle between the Autobots and Decepticons. As ever, Optimus Prime leads out the Autobots, whilst his eternal nemesis, Megatron, controls the villainous Decepticons. Thanks to a markedly darker tone, and some excellent writing that takes the series in some interesting directions, Transformers Prime still manages to feel fresh.

The central premise of the miniseries revolves around Megatron's plans to raise an army of undead robots. That's right, for only the second time ever, I get to raise a fist in the air triumphantly at the sight of freakin' techno-zombies! Beyond the immediately cool concept, this helps inform the tone of the series, which as already noted is darker than fans of the Transformers may be accustomed to. This leads to scenes of perennial bad guy Starscream interrogating Autobot-friendly humans, and scenes of mass devastation (complete with screaming women running through war-torn cities).

The human characters introduced in Transformers Prime, on the surface at least, appear a little contrived. We get the twelve-year-old computer geek, ""Raf"" Esquivel, who is squarely aimed at the younger viewer; rock chick Miko, who it appears is intended to bring more female viewers to the series; and finally Jack Darby, the cool teenager. This argument can also be extended to the Transformers themselves, with the introduction of Acree, the first female robot to be featured prominently, suggesting a show looking to cater for everyone. If you put the cynicism to one side, and these characters--particularly Acree--prove to be an appealing bunch, and each adds something to the show as a whole.

Of course, a big draw of Transformers has always been the sight of giant robots smacking the bejesus out of each other, and Transformers Prime really shines in this respect. A final showdown between Optimus Prime and Megatron, though short, carries all the weight such a clash should, while a battle against an undead Decepticon army sees all kinds of hell break loose.

This voice cast is arguably the best seen in any of the animated Transformers shows. Along with Transformers stalwarts Peter Cullen and Frank Welker, the series brings in the likes of Ernie Hudson (Ghostbusters), Jeffrey Combs Re-Animator), and even Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson (Faster) in a small, but pivotal role. Combs, who plays Ratchet, delivers a reading that renders all previous versions of the character void. He brings that extra little something to the role that makes the viewer fully understand why he is Optimus Prime's right-hand man; his grouchy demeanor (""Optimus, if you leave me stranded on a planet teeming with humans, I may never forgive you!"") is also captured perfectly in Combs' reading of the character.

Visually, Transformers Prime offers a near-perfect mix of each of the previous iterations of the Transformers, including the live action movies, to deliver an extremely appealing aesthetic which veers ever so slightly toward anime. Shout! Factory's DVD presentation ensures the show looks fantastic. Colors are bold, with excellent levels of detail even during darker scenes. Small details, like the reflection on the metallic shells of the robots, are clear, and are complemented by the deep black levels. The 5.1 soundtrack packs quite a wallop, with action scenes really benefiting from the expansive mix.

Extras for this release are a little disappointing. ""A Look at Character Design"" reveals several characters at each stage of development, from initial sketches to final computer renderings. ""A Look at Set Design"" is essentially the same as the previous featurette, but this time concerned solely with set design. Finally there is an animatic for episode one of the miniseries. Much like the previous two features it's not a bad addition to the package, but it would have been nice to get something a little more substantial (interviews, commentary, etc.).

This film had everything action adventure some comedy. i really recommand this movie for any transformer fan,1323129600,2,254,4.930232558139535
4834283,5,B005M5OSB0,"I read a previous review stating that this was not in Widescreen format because Amazon.com said it was in full screen format. The show is aired on the HUB in Widescreen format. However, Amazon.com was incorrect about the screen format of the DVD. I just received my copy of this DVD today from Amazon.com and the show is in WIDESCREEN (1.85:1) format as it was aired on T.V. It is not in full screen format as Amazon.com states on the listing. So Amazon.com has incorrect information posted on the listing.

As for the show I love it no matter what. I think this is one of the best Transformers series to be developed since Beast Wars: Transformers and the original Transformers from the 80's. I have watched every episode of the first season and I was amazed at all the detail in the show. I loved every bit of the first season finale and I can't wait to see what happens in Season Two. Optimus has lost his memories after giving up the Matrix of Leadership and so I can't wait until Season Two arrives.",1323129600,3,1004,4.427027027027027

4834285,5,B005M5OSB0,"I have been a fan of the Transformers since they first came out in the 1980's and I have seen, and read many of the great books and television series that have spun off since the original series too. Transformers Prime is a great series and ranks at the top of my list of things within the series that I have seen to date.

What I like the most about this series is the great writing, voice acting as well as animation that you find in this series and this DVD captures the best in the Prime series.

I would recommend this to any transformers fan. The DVD itself was well made and I found the DVD to be a great show that I know that I will watch again and again.",1320796800,2,663,4.015151515151516
