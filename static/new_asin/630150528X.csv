333885,4,630150528X,"Bogart only did it because he owed a favor to Huston. Hepburn wrote of her experiences filming this movie in a book subtitled, ""How I went to  Africa with Bogart, Bacall and Huston and almost lost my mind."" Hard  to believe such hardship, suffering, and sickness could result in such a  beautiful film as this. No pretensions about cultural or political comment,  allegorical connections, sermons, or--thank the Almighty--a photographer's  piece. This is just a simple, and brilliant, mix of adventure, character,  and humor. Even with all of the superb jungle backgrounds, (another Jack  Cardiff triumph) the real beauty of the film lies in its gentle portrait of  it's disparate leading characters; and the lyrical unfolding of their  inevitable attraction to one another. Don't let this description fool you;  it's also great fun. Bogart and Hepburn at their most winning; generous  helpings of laughter, tenderness, romance, and high adventure make it all  go down smooth and satisfying. It also jumps right into the action, with no  stops or wrong turns along the way (no pun intended...you'll find out). A  poem of a film!",918000000,4,1128,5.126373626373627

333904,4,630150528X,"While I liked The African Queen, I didn't love it as I hoped I would. I thought it was quite improbable that a longtime, prim and proper, single missionary woman would suddenly have eyes for a dirty riverboat captain practically overnight. I also thought it unlikely that she would devise this risky, far-fetched plan to rig a torpedo system to attack the German boat seemingly five minutes after she got into Bogie's boat. A missionary suddenly becoming a resourceful naval commander? However, there were many positives. I thought the story was still interesting despite my criticisms. The dialogue was great. Bogie of course, was great--his mannerisms were funny! Both characters were likable. The scenery was pretty. And, I liked that it was clean--no profanity, no sex, no lust, etc. So, overall a good movie, but not a great one for me.",1520208000,,841,4.971631205673759

The story line included so many missing scenes that I had not seen previously. I thought it was a great movie, plus there was more to the story than I had expected. I have always loved Katherine Hepburn, but had not been a fan of Humphrey Bogart. He was a crusty old seaman with his boat that also looked like it could have used some spit and polish, but what the two of them accomplished was amazing.

333923,5,630150528X,"My review focuses on the symbolism of the movie and on the characters, not on the plot. In the movie, ""Rose"" (Kathrin Hepburn) starts off as an uptight missionary woman, a clever but controlling woman. Throughout their ride down the river she controls everything that happens on the ""African Queen"" boat which is symbolized by her steering the boat throughout their trip and early on in their voyage by her emptying ""Charlie's"" (Humphrey Bogart) liquor into the river because he had exploded in anger and called her names in his drunken stupor. She later loosens up and reveals herself as ""Rosie"", an adventurous woman full of passion and courage and love who works just as hard for survival as Charlie does. Charlie is an easy going guy who falls for her and agrees to go along with her wishes even if it means risking their lives. He has a double dose of courage in that he takes on all the challenges of the African jungle without complaining much and he takes on a headstrong woman and opens his heart to her. The movie's main message has little to do with Africa or the war. In fact, their rocky ride is symbolic of what happens in romantic relationships, and makes a statement that a good team is not one with perfect people, but one in which people accept each other the way they are, forgive each other and say I am sorry (Rosie later apologizes for throwing out his Gin), who know how to listen to each other, who put all their effort to help each other get out of a bad situation and who let that person steer (the boat) who has a bigger ability at saving them (or the relationship). And although their trip is full of challenges, they learn to laugh a lot and to enjoy the adventure. Because that is what decides if a relationship becomes a joyous adventure or a hard struggle: good teamwork.",1514851200,,1803,4.5

333940,5,630150528X,"Review of The African Queen
Hot Toasty Rag, October 30, 2017

On the brink of WWI, a missionary, Robert Morley, and his sister, Katharine Hepburn, are working in the African Congo. When Germans occupy the territory and Robert is killed, Kate has no choice but to join the scruffy, far-from-pious Humphrey Bogart on his small riverboat The African Queen, since its their only means of transportation. From then on, its basically a two-person show as the two navigate through the Congo and come up with a plan to join the war effort.

While the initial cast choice was Bette Davis and David Niven, the onscreen couple Katharine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart in The African Queen is indelible in audiences minds. Its impossible to imagine anyone else in the film, even though I absolutely love The Niv and the character was originally written to have a Cockney accent. Humphrey Bogart, playing a Canadian because he couldn't do the accent, is absolutely perfect in the role! He definitely deserved his Oscar, and no one would argue that its the best performance of his career. Hes sweet, funny, big-hearted, reluctantly passionate, and completely believable in his surroundings. David Niven is many thingshandsome, debonair, classybut none of his special talents would be needed in the part. The Charlie Allnut character needs to be uncouth. He needs to seem like he's really lived on a boat in Africa for years with gin as his only companion and love far from his mind. He needs to be Humphrey Bogart.

But, on to Kate. Katharine Hepburn gives one of her best and classic performances as the straight-laced, religious spinster with an unexpected fiery passion. Shes absolutely delightful, showing a range of emotions that are so believable itll be hard to see her as anyone else in the future. Shes logical and smart, but also sensitive and loving. The African Queen is one of my all-time favorite love storiesand old moviesbecause of the sweet, tender moments the unlikely pair share. From the awkward tea party in the beginning of the film when Humphs stomach cant stop growling to their first journey down the rapids and beyond, theyll make themselves a permanent home in your heart. After theyve declared their love, Kate finally asks him what his first name isits so adorable! Upon hearing it, she smiles like a young girl and sweetly says, What a nice name. Charlie. Charlie!

I could continue to quote all the lovely, adorable, memorable phrases from the romance, but you should really see them for yourself. Whether you end up adding And you call yourself a Christian! or Nature, Mr. Allnut, is what we are put on this earth to rise above or Then do so, Mr. Allnut to your household phrases, Im sure youll love The African Queen just as much as I do. Its truly one-of-a-kind.",1509321600,,2779,4.8442105263157895
333941,5,630150528X,"One of the great motion pictures!  Definitely worth watching.  Funny, drama, romance, action-adventures are rare.

334017,5,630150528X,There were thrilling scenes of a boat going through rapids to get from an upland river to a lake on which the Germans had a battleship in 1914. Crocodiles going into the river at other points added to the excitement. Katharine Hepburn plays an English widow well enough to seem modest before the excitement starts. Bogart acts like a Canadian with responsibilities the Germans spoiled by taking over the natives for military duty to create a German African empire. I felt entertained.,1485302400,,484,4.914634146341464

The story of making this film is just as interesting as the movie itself.  Filmed mostly on location in Africa, the cast and crew endured amazing hardships to maximize the ""real"" shots and keep the process shots (used primarily for safety) to a minimum.

The storyline is unusual and very satisfying.  Look closely and notice that the German captain also played Higgin's nemesis in My Fair Lady, as well as the submarine captain in The Russians Are Coming, The Russians are Coming!

Humphrey Bogart and Katherine Hepburn are two of the greatest Hollywood icons ever.  The movie was nominated for numerous academy awards.  Humphrey Bogart was awarded and academy award for this work.

The movie is based on a book of the same name by C. S. Forester.  The book is also very good and has some significant differences.  It is not a lengthy book and I enjoyed reading it.

The film was shot on the continent of Africa.  Much of it is extremely realistic.  In case one cares, the actual boat is now located in Key Largo, Florida, the location of another film by Humphrey Bogart, and is available for viewing. Thank You...",1478476800,,789,4.492957746478873

Humphrey Bogart is perfect as the grimy, disheveled boat captain... you can almost detect his odor radiating from the screen! Katherine Hepburn as well is wonderful as the straight-laced missionary who falls from Bogart's character.

334180,5,630150528X,"Actually saw this on t.v. very recently. I have seen this film many times, yet I get caught up in the story over and over again. The actors become their characters. Having a great director doesn't hurt either.",1459209600,,209,4.526315789473684
334181,4,630150528X,"The African Queen (1951) is part adventure story and part love story set in set 1914 Africa at the beginning of WWI.  As is common knowledge, it is a very good movie (despite a few slow parts).  I do have one criticism however, which has to do with the relationship between Bogart and Hepburn (Charlie and Rosie in the movie).  After an anxious time on the boat going over some rapids (about 55 minutes into the movie), all of a sudden, they're in love (previously, they were somewhat at odds with each other, as evidenced by lines such as: ""Well I ain't sorry for you no more, ya crazy, psalm-singing, skinny old maid! "").  And because Hepburn's character is devoutly religious, it would seem that other than a kiss or two, the relationship never progresses past that point.  I feel it would have been more honest if it did.  Just my opinion.  Still, it was a very good movie.  One last thing, and this contains a spoiler about the ending, so don't read if you don't want to:

The movie would have been more tense at the end if the director had not foreshadowed the German boat heading for the torpedo.  It would have been a lot more emotional if the audience really thought that Charlie and Rosie were about to be hung... then, bang!... explosions as the German boat sinks.",1458777600,,1275,4.48051948051948
334182,5,630150528X,Perfect copy. Surprisingly clear and sharp picture. I also have a Korean made copy and that was not half as sharp as this copy. The extra material is very good but Hepburn's book is excellent.  There are also a few souvenir items that are sort of fun.  This is definitely the version to get as the picture quality is excellent and the other goodies are fun too.  $20 is a great price for such a quality classic.,1458777600,,411,4.311688311688312

I will admit that it took me awhile to get on board with their 'chemistry', as it was initially hard for me to picture Bogart with someone like Hepburn, or vise versa. However, as the story developed, they became more and more compatible. In a way, this is great for the silver screen, as you not only have character development, but the viewer can assimilate characters slowly from a compatibility standpoint. It's a sort of 'seduction' that works well. What we have is a great movie with two Hollywood legends giving great performances. I will always consider Bogey's performance in Casablanca to be his best ever, but this one is not too far behind. The special features are good, with a nice segment on the making of the film.",1449360000,,949,4.72289156626506

334314,5,630150528X,"""African Queen"" is one of my favorite films of all time, and it's very likely that you already know the story.  The film, first released in 1951, won the Oscars for best actor, best actress, best director, and best adapted screen play, and certainly deserved all those awards.  So let's just talk about the Blu-ray version.

The restored image and sound are stunning, shining out in full Technicolor glory that I'm sure hasn't been seen since the movie first appeared in theaters.  I can make out details that I don't remember ever seeing before, which made the experience of watching the movie again as fresh and exciting an experience as it was when I first saw it on television.

334434,5,630150528X,"he African Queen

With Humphrey Bogart
Katharine Hepburn

In the mist of war, sometimes strange bedfellows meet. The Africa Queen is a boat that brings two unlikely people together.

The man, Bogart, a small boat captain, and Hepburn, a Christian teacher come together in the middle of an African conflict brought on by the World War II conflict. They join to avoid the German intrusion into their life.

The two, after personality conflicts, become lovers, and the whole complexion of their survival is strengthened by their love for each other. Both have strong personalities that come across on the screen in superb acting.

Only these two actors could pull off this adventure into the African wild. Humphrey Bogart was nominated for Best Actor by the Academy and Katharine Hepburn was nominated for Best Actress. Bogart won the award; Hepburn lost to A Streetcar Named Desires Vivian Leigh.

 I have seen both and I disagree with the Academy Award. Katharine Hepburn should have won the award.

334475,5,630150528X,"""The African Queen"" is an adventure, a romance, and a comedy, yet it tackles none of these genres according to accepted movie tradition.  The adventure takes place in German-controlled central-east Africa in 1914, at the outset of the First World War, with the main characters--a Canadian man and an English woman--initially trying to escape the Germans.  They sail down the Ulonga-Bora River toward a lake in the man's dilapidated, rattrap little steamboat called the ""African Queen.""  Once underway, however, the pair decide to blow up an important German gunboat patrolling a lake, using the ""Queen"" as the ramming device for a pair of homemade torpedoes.

The romance and the comedy take place aboard the ""Queen"" between a middle-aged, drunken sot, Charlie Allnut (Bogart), and a prim, straight-laced, middle-aged lady, Rose Sayer (Hepburn).  A more unorthodox adventure story and a more unconventional romantic comedy you couldn't imagine.

Allnut travels up and down the East-African rivers delivering supplies to the colonists and missionaries there, but mostly he drinks.  He's unshaven, unkempt, and usually less than sober, hardly one's image of a movie hero.  Like many of Bogart's roles, it was a gamble.  By 1951 Bogart was one of the biggest stars in Hollywood, enabling him to take a chance in 1948 playing a thorough reprobate in ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" and getting away with it to public and critical approval; and, yes, he got away with it again in ""The African Queen"" to even greater acclaim.  Although, to be fair, his character here is nothing like the greedy, dishonest scoundrel he played in ""Sierra Madre.""

Hepburn, well into her forties by this time and at an age when American cinema usually abandons such actresses, took a chance, too, playing the prudish, almost Puritanical spinster who eventually falls for the grubby, grizzled, thoroughly egregious Allnut.  The two players perform fabulously well against type, each bringing out the best in the other, both as actors and as characters in the story.  Before long, it's hard to tell the difference.

This was the fourth of five movies Huston would make with Bogart and his only one with Hepburn.  Huston co-wrote the screenplay with James Agee and Peter Viertel from a novel by C.S. Forester, turning the story into a tight, productive motion picture that is remarkably concise and pointed.  There isn't a wasted moment, a wasted gesture, or a wasted line.  The plot, the characters, and the action move along efficiently, with the odd-couple relationship of Bogart and Hepburn keeping the boat and the movie afloat.  For his part, Bogart won an Oscar for Best Actor, and the Academy nominated Hepburn, Huston, and Agee for Best Actress, Best Director, and Best Writing respectively.  Look also in the cast for Robert Morley as Miss Sayer's brother, a Christian missionary, and Theodore Bikel (who at the time of this writing was still going strong on stage and screen) as the first officer aboard the German ship.

To make the movie more realistic, Huston took his cast and crew to the Congo, Uganda, and Zaire, as well as to England, Turkey, and Southern California for filming.  The location shooting became the stuff of legend, and Peter Viertel chronicled some of it in his book ""White Hunter Black Heart,"" which Clint Eastwood later made into a movie (1990).

My parents took me to see ""The African Queen"" when I was a kid, and two things always stuck out in my memory:  the fort on the hill (really neat) and the leeches (really icky).  Almost a quarter of a century after her making Huston's film, Katharine Hepburn would team up with John Wayne in ""Rooster Cogburn,"" a movie that used virtually the same formula but to much duller effect.

Trivia:  According to John Eastman in his book ""Retakes"" (Ballantine, New York, 1989), ""Columbia Studios bought the original C.S. Forester novel for Charles Laughton and Elsa Lanchester, then, in 1939, sold it to Warner Bros. for Bette Davis and David Niven.  When Davis fell out with the producer, 20th Century-Fox bought the property, and John Huston unearthed it there twelve years later.  Plagued by army ants, black wasps, dysentery, and steaming jungle heat, cast and crew suffered miserably in the African location scenes.  Only Huston and Bogart escaped sickness (owing, they maintained, to their daily Scotch intake.)  The actual 'African Queen,' a retired riverboat, towed four rafts down the Ruiki.  On one, a mock-up replica of the boat provided a stage set, while others held equipment and private quarters for Hepburn.  Bogart, at first lukewarm about his role and hating any sort of location work, gradually absorbed himself in the character of Charlie Allnut, but he never ceased complaining about the jungle discomforts and Hepburn's incessant, bewildering cheerfulness....  Screenwriter James Agee, whose disabling heart attack put an end to this work on the script, intended the river journey to symbolize the act of love, and he strongly criticized the upbeat finale concocted by Huston and writer Peter Viertel.""

Video:
After having suffered through a series of poorly rendered VHS tapes and import DVDs of ""The African Queen,"" it was a pleasure finally to see the movie again in all its finery.  Paramount meticulously restored the film and transferred it to high-definition Blu-ray disc using a dual-layered BD50 and an MPEG-4 codec.  The results remind us that no matter what a movie's age, if it looked good to begin with, it can look good again.

And the 1.33.1 ratio, Technicolor film looks quite good in high def for a film of any vintage.  The video engineers left the natural film grain intact, which you will probably only notice in vast expanses of sky or at night.  After the restoration, the engineers left virtually no signs of wear or deterioration, no specks, lines, scratches, fades, or what have you.  Colors are a tad dark, though, especially noticeable in skin tones, which tend to make the cast appear as though they were out in the sun too long, but I suspect that is how director Huston and photographer Jack Cardiff intended the film to look.  Jungle greens are lush; some of the bluer rivers glisten, while the blacker rivers are intensely deep; and earth browns are rich.  With fairly good object delineation thrown in, the film is quite lovely to look at.

Audio:
The disc's soundtrack reproduces the original monaural audio via Dolby Digital 1.0, and while that might not seem like much, the sound has probably never been better.  The only minor drawback beyond it's not being in surround or having a very wide frequency response is that there is a very slight background noise involved, a bit of a hiss one can notice during quieter passages if one turns the volume up too high.  The lesson:  Keep the volume at a normal listening level, and you won't even know the hiss is there.  Otherwise, the soundtrack displays a smooth, realistic midrange and a fine showcase for Allan Gray's musical score, played by Norman Del Mar and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.  This is a soundtrack easy on the ear, and, as a rainstorm proves early on,  mono or no it does its job.

Extras:
The only major bonus item on the disc is the superb documentary ""Embracing Chaos:  The Making of the African Queen.""  It's a new, one-hour production in high definition and stereo that features commentary from a raft of people who either worked on the film or worked with people who worked on the film.  To give you an idea of the documentary's content, let me tell you who participates in it:  Rudy Behlmer, film historian; Richard Schickel, film critic and historian; John Forester, son of the book's author; Nicholas Meyer, writer and director; Eric Lax, Bogart biographer; Natasha Fraser-Cavassoni, biographer of Sam Spiegel, the film's co-producer; Theodore Bikel, a featured player in the film; Guy Hamilton, assistant director of the film; Martin Scorsese, who always seems to show up in these things; Norman Lloyd, actor-director-producer; Lawrence Grobel, Huston biographer; Sir John Woolf, co-producer of the film; William J. Mann, Hepburn biographer; Katharine Hepburn, John Huston, director of photography Jack Cardiff, and others in archival footage; Laurence Bergreen, Agee biographer; Angela Allan, script supervisor on the film; Steven-Charles Jaffe, producer; Desmond Davis, clapper boy on the film; Brenda Scott Royce, Lauren Bacall biographer; Warren Stevens, Bogart friend; James Ursini, film historian; Tony Huston, the director's son; Mark Rydell, producer-director; David Lewin, publicist for the film; and John Philip Dayton, Hepburn friend.  Together, they offer some illuminating glimpses into the making of the movie.

In addition to the documentary, we get eighteen scene selections; bookmarks; English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese spoken languages and subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.

Parting Thoughts:
""The African Queen"" is a totally delightful and entirely engrossing romance, filled with comedy, action, and adventure.  That it was able to accomplish so much with essentially two mis-matched characters and a decrepit little riverboat is one of filmdom's major accomplishments, proving once again the power of pictures to move us in unexpected ways.

Of the six movies Bogart and John Huston made together (The Maltese Falcon, Across The Pacific, The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre, Key Largo, Beat The Devil and The African Queen), this one got the biggest heart (but that doesn't mean is necessarily the best one. Excluding Across The Pacific, all are rightful cinema classics).
The African Queen is a beatiful movie that shows Bogart's range (cause Hepburn's range was not in doubt by that time, 1951, but Bogart didn't normally played characters as vulnerable as Charlie).",1421366400,,730,5.041322314049586

When I found my husband watching this old movie on TV , spellbound, and found that he had never seen it, I just had to order it for our collection.  Bogart plays a dirty, drunken boat captain who gets forced into taking this prim and proper missionary lady upriver to civilization.  This is during the WW I.  Hepburn gets the idea that they should go downriver and try to sink a German naval vessel which is patrolling an African Lake (Victoria?).  They argue all the way down river, shoot the rapids, evade a German fort, and take the wrong turn in the delta leading to the lake, among other events.  The AMC guy related that Hepburn had a wonderful time filming in Africa, ever the tomboy, while Bogart hated the place and would rather be in his tent drinking.  This is well worth seeing again and again.  Quite an adventure considering that this was made long before special effects were invented.",1415318400,3,942,4.598802395209581

335032,5,630150528X,"Academy Award nominations and wins: Director-John Huston, Leading Actor-Humphrey Bogart, Leading Actress-Katherine Hepburn and Screenplay.

March Boy nominations: Leading Actor-Humphrey Bogart, Leading Actress-Katherine Hepburn, Cinematography, Film Editing and Screenplay.

Like Jennifer Jones, Maximillian Schell, Sidney Poitier and Charlton Heston, Humphrey Bogart is one of those actors who get a bad name for winning an award that most people nowadays think belonged to someone else.

I can EASILY understand and even endorse the enthusiasm of those who gravitate towards Marlon Brando in A Streetcar named Desire (his YOU KNOW WHAT I SAY? HAAAA HAAAA HAAAAA!!!!!!! and Pair of queens speeches are absolutely freezing to the blood) and I definitely lean towards him as the better of the two but the best performance from a leading actor that year was Montgomery Clift in A Place in the Sun because everything leading up to his ultimate demise is subtly, and tastefully underscored. His quiet, psychological approach to the gold digger George Eastman speaks more volumes than all the roaring and bellowing of Stanley Kowalski. Those crystal clear eyes glazed over in emotion, the trembling lips, and the soft, fragile voice. The forced, fake way he smiles masking a tremendous amount of self-loathing when hes with Angela after the boat accidentyou just KNOW if he gets away with leaving his pregnant mistress Alice to drown hell live with that for the rest of his life.

That being said I still thoroughly enjoyed Humphrey Bogarts performance of the rough and tough, cantankerous Charlie Allunut. (He is still third fiddle to Clift and Brando but they most likely cancelled each other out and besides the Academy wasn't about to give up their aversion to awarding performances of woman-chasers or wife beaters) He adds just the right amount of spark, wit, charm and humor to the role and his chemistry with Katherine Hepburn (Rose Sayer) is filled with playful, humorous bickering and flirting.

My favorite of their scenes are:
1. The uneasy look on Roses face when she sees Charlie drinking whiskey. He offers her some but she asks in a voice thinly veiling her shock and disgust Could I just have some tea.
2. Their first quarrel when she dumps his liquor.
3. Charlie impersonating animals to make Rose laugh.
4. When the boat is stuck in the mud and she realizes (or so she thinks) their time is up. Her prayer that God will judge them not for their weaknesses but for their love is so full of sincerity, warmth and dignity it feels real.
The screenplay crackles with wit and humor with some of the best lines ever penned for an adventure.
1. Nature is what we are put in this world to rise above.
2. I now pronounce you man and wife. Proceed with the execution.
3. I don't know why the Germans would want this God-forsaken place. God has not forsaken this place as my brothers presence here bears witness.

Jack Cardiffs cinematography is lush, the editing is crisp and well-paced and John Huston directs with a steady hand.
I recommend this film. Sure, Clift and Brando didn't win because they were playing despicable characters. They BOTH deserved it and that would have been too tough a choice to make but Humphrey Bogarts win is NOT AT ALL a bad choice.

Five Stars. Just some good old fashioned adventure fun and a great way to take ones mind off ones troubles.",1412467200,,3376,4.922671353251318

335227,5,630150528X,"Great road picture. And good old fashion storytelling by some masters of the medium, director John Huston and actors Humphrey Bogart and Katherine Hepburn.

The two leads, Huston behind the camera, the screenplay writers, the river landscape, and the anemic boat itself are all stars in this tale set in Africa in the beginning of WWl and filmed on location. Bogie shines by playing a grubby helmsman of a wheezing little steamboat attempting to evacuate himself and Hepburn from an impending invasion, and Hepburn, no shrinking violet, provides him with plenty of room and support. Generous performances by both principals. A terrific romantic vehicle for two middle agers who find each other in a most unlikely way.

335447,5,630150528X,"THE AFRICAN QUEEN [1951] [Special Restoration Edition] [Blu-ray] [UK Release] The Mightiest Adventure Ever Filmed! A First Rate Adventure!

From the Golden Age of cinema The African Queen is a truly magnificent film adapted from a novel by C.S. Forester. Starring Humphrey Bogart in his OSCAR winning portrayal of Charlie Allnut, the slovenly, gin-swilling captain of a tramp steamer called the African Queen, which ships supplies to small East African villages during World War I in August/September 1914. Katharine Hepburn plays Rose Sayer, the maiden-lady sister of a prim British missionary [Robert Morley].

When invading Germans kill the missionary and level the village, Allnut offers to take Rose back to civilisation. She can't tolerate his drinking or bad manners, he isn't crazy about her imperious, judgmental attitude. However it does not take long before their passionate dislike turns to love. Together the disparate duo works to ensure their survival on the treacherous waters and devise an ingenious way to destroy a German gunboat.

With masterful direction from John Huston, and cinematography by Jack Cardiff, The African Queen may well be the perfect adventure film. Its roller-coaster storyline complemented by the chemistry between its stars.

FILM FACT: Awards and Honours: Academy Awards: Won: Best Actor in a Leading Role for Humphrey Bogart. Nominated: Best Actress in a Leading Role for Katharine Hepburn. Nominated: Best Adapted Screenplay for James Agee and John Huston. Nominated:  Best Director for John Huston. Much of the film was shot on location in Uganda and the Congo in Africa. About half of the film was shot in England. For instance, the scenes in which Bogart and Hepburn are seen in the water were all shot in studio tanks at Isleworth Studios, Middlesex. These scenes were considered too dangerous to shoot in Africa. All of the foreground plates for the process shots were also done in studio. The vessel used to portray the German gunboat Knigin Luise in the film was the steam tug Buganda, owned and operated on Lake Victoria by East African Railways & Harbours.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: 'The African Queen' has been consistently praised and admired by critics and audiences alike since its 1951 premiere, but for several years John Huston's stirring romantic adventure also carried the dubious distinction of being the only picture on the AFI's list of the 100 Greatest American Movies yet to see a digital release. That frustrating fact sent diehard cinephiles into periodic apoplectic fits, but Paramount, after much wrangling, at last secured and then painstakingly restored the film's original three-strip negative, which had been locked away in a British vault. According to the studio, all American prints had deteriorated to such a degree they were unsuitable for re-mastering. And now, after what seems like an eternity, this Holy Grail film hits the home video market not only in standard definition, but also in glorious 1080p Technicolor.

And let me tell you, the wait has been worth it. Classic film fans who don't rhapsodize over this superior effort, which breathes new life into this venerable drama, should head straight to the optometrist, because 'The African Queen' is a kingly specimen that will thrill even the most discriminating high-definition viewers.

Notable for its ambitious location shooting in the Belgian Congo, colourful production history, terrific chemistry between stars Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn, and sweet, captivating story and based on the novel by C.S. Forester fame, 'The African Queen' scored big upon its initial release and hasn't lost any of its lustre since. Humphrey Bogart won his only Academy Awards and beating the likes of Marlon Brando in 'A Streetcar Named Desire' and Montgomery Clift in 'A Place in the Sun,' for his role as the gruff, grimy, gin-soaked Charlie Allnut, skipper of the African Queen. a rickety riverboat that delivers supplies to, among other places, a small, isolated mission run by the Reverend Samuel Sayer [Robert Morley] and his prim, virtuous sister, Rose Sayer [Katharine Hepburn]. Unaware of a major conflict known as World War I, Samuel and Rose are shocked to hear from Charlie Allnut about an imminent German invasion, and when Kaiser Wilhelm's soldiers overrun the mission almost on cue, the siblings watch in horror as troops ransack and burn their settlement. The trauma and devastation send Samuel Sayer to an early grave, leaving Rose Sayer to fend for herself in the wilds of The Dark Continent.

When Charlie Allnut stops by to assess damage and offer help, he never dreams the dogged Rose Sayer will shanghai him and his boat, taking them on a dangerous journey down river that will continually test their courage and tenacity, all in the hope of finding and destroying the German gunboat that harbours the regional command. Along the way, the dilapidated African Queen must traverse treacherous rapids, cut through dense brush, and survive rough storms, while its two oil-and-water shipmates spar, bicker, and ultimately become smitten. Charlie Allnut and Rose Sayer's romance is as unlikely and unexpected as it is endearing and cute, and the middle-aged couple often acts like two starry-eyed teens basking in the unsullied bloom of young love. Their strong emotions, however, never weaken their resolve to confront and cripple the wily Germans, but executing their preposterous plan will take every ounce of energy and blind faith they can muster.

The long-standing appeal of 'The African Queen' may be due in part to its against-all-odds attitude and core values of guts and perseverance, but more likely stems from the irresistible appeal of its improbable hero and heroine. The notion that a blasphemous drunk and pious spinster could fall in love, let alone have the audacity to believe they can take down a well-oiled military machine, is both ludicrous and delightful, and Humphrey Bogart and Katherine Hepburn play their roles to the hilt. Never for a moment does their affection seem anything less than genuine, and with a mastery of their craft that few others in the industry possess, the two legendary actors infuse their eccentric, charismatic characters with palpable warmth and spirit.

No stranger to big, outdoorsy tales of indomitable will and chutzpah, John Huston who teamed with Humphrey Bogart on the equally rugged and immortal 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre' just three years before, deftly blends rousing physical sequences with scenes of exquisite tenderness and charm. The director's keen sense of rhythm keeps the story flowing like the river itself, ramping up tension at some points, gently drifting along in others, to create a comfortable mood punctuated by stunning landscape and wildlife shots. The marvellous script, which he co-wrote with James Agee and contains several memorable exchanges, and despite the fact that most of the film is a two-person dialogue, the characters are so richly drawn and brought so vividly to life by the actors, we never tire of them.

Amazingly, 'The African Queen' was not nominated for Best Picture, but both John Huston and Katherine Hepburn did receive nods for Best Director and Actress, respectively. John Huston was beaten by George Stevens for 'A Place in the Sun,' while Hepburn lost to Vivien Leigh's Blanche DuBois. Yet the lack of awards recognition can't diminish the film's lasting impact or the reverence it engenders. Charlie and Rose, as sweaty and dishevelled as they often appear, and as quirky and stubborn as they often act, are one of the films' immortal couples, ranking right up there with Scarlett and Rhett. Their passion may be muted and their age advanced, but they're still quite a pair. And 'The African Queen' is still quite an awesome adventurous film.

The films restoration in 2010: ITV STUDIOS Global Entertainment has partnered with Paramount Pictures to save this great classic and restore it back to its former glory. The Original 35mm three strip camera negatives were scanned at high resolution and digitally recombined using restoration tools to repair tears and scratches, remove dirt and stabilise the picture. The soundtrack underwent full digital audio restoration removing clicks, hum, and other audio defects before creating a new Optical soundtrack negative. The Digital files have been output to a high resolution digital cinema File as well as creating a pristine new combined 35mm negative and an HD master. This is a fine example of how todays technologies can protect and preserve classic films both digitally and photo-chemically for the next 100 years and beyond.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Film buffs have waited far too long for a digital transfer of 'The African Queen,' so expectations understandably ran high when Paramount announced its 4k restoration of the 1951 film. Working from the original three-strip negative, technicians scanned and digitized each element, then recombined and carefully aligned them before removing any dirt, nicks, and scratches. The process was long and arduous, but any doubts 'The African Queen' might arrive on Blu-ray looking less than its best vanish immediately upon one's first view of this stunningly beautiful rendering. Breath-taking clarity and sharpness, lush colour, and plenty of high-definition pop all belie the picture's advanced age and make this antiquated classic almost seem like a new release. Details, even in the background, remain well defined, and the driving rain possesses such marvellous clarity, it often looks like little needles falling from the heavens. Close-ups, especially those of Bogart, are sublime, highlighting every nook and cranny in his weathered face, and though Hepburn is photographed in soft focus, her classic features (oh, those cheekbones!) still come across well. Omnipresent beads of sweat are also visible, and the thick brush the pair must hack through is marvellously distinct. The African countryside and wildlife, especially a herd of crocodiles, nearly jump off the screen, often producing a sort of you-are-there effect that thrusts us into the action. Please Note: Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  ITV STUDIOS Global Entertainment has partnered with Paramount Pictures and hasn't tried to improve the audio on 'The African Queen,' because it is just fine by me. The original mono track gets the job done, producing full-bodied sound with plenty of tonal depth and presence. Though a bit of hiss still remains, the clean-up has been thorough, erasing any age-related pops, crackles, and static. Dynamic range is quite good, with high ends resisting distortion and low ends possessing good weight, and the action-oriented scenes fill the room well, even without multi-channel activity. And just because the track is front-based doesn't mean we don't pick up all the ambience of the African setting. On the contrary, the animal noises, buzzing of bugs, and rustling of foliage all come across quite well. It's not exactly immersive audio, but it represents the locale well. Best of all, dialogue is always clear and easy to comprehend, and Allan Gray's music score benefits from solid fidelity. For an almost 60-year-old soundtrack, 'The African Queen' sounds mighty spry.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary with the late Jack Cardiff: Jack Cardiff discusses in great detail how specific sequences from The African Queen were shot, the various technical obstacles the tech crew had to overcome in the Belgian Congo, the diseases the actors struggled with during the shooting, some of the similarities and differences between C.S. Forester's novel and the film, etc. This is a truly amazing and fascinating audio commentary.

Special Feature: Embracing Chaos: Making The African Queen [2010] [60:00] An outstanding in-depth look at the production history of The African Queen, with various comments by Martin Scorsese, Jack Cardiff, film historian Rudy Behlmer, writer/director Nicholas Meyer, Humphrey Bogart Biographer Eric Lax, assistant director Guy Hamilton, and actor/director/producer Norman Lloyd, among others. With optional English SDH subtitles.

Finally, The UK Blu-ray release of John Huston's The African Queen has two key advantages over the U.S.A Region A/1 release, as it comes with a very good audio track and a very strong audio commentary by the late Jack Cardiff. If you do not yet have this classic film in your Blu-ray library collection, but keen to get this particular copy, then please remember as this is a Region B/2 Blu-ray disc. Ever since I had this on an NTSC LaserDisc, it has always been a massive favourite of mine, but now I have it in the ultimate Blu-ray format; I am now a very happy bunny and it will give me endless hours of enjoyment and an honour to have it in my extensive Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!

Drama, comedy, a ""buddy movie"" with two very unlikely buddies.  First saw this movie MANY years ago, and on re-watching it, it is still a great film. No, it doesn't have any CGI, and some of the scenes are almost laughably cheesy by modern standards with their effects.

A story of heroism, love, redemption and possibilites, filmed mostly on location in Africa, the great director, John Huston, creates magic with just two actors and sometimes cheesy effects with a toy boat in a dirty puddle in your backyard.

336114,5,630150528X,"THE STORY (contains spoilers): The time is World War One. Humphrey Bogart plays Charlie Allnut, an unshaven, unkempt, unapologetic lout who makes his living delivering mail and supplies along the African Congo in his ratty old boat, the African Queen. Katherine Hepburn plays Rose Sayer, the devoted sister of a British missionary minister, (Robert Morely), who's built a small church and maintains a tiny congregation deep in the African jungle. A tragic turn of event leaves her brother dead and puts Rose on board the Queen with Charlie, running from the advancing German army patrols. As they make their way down the winding Congo, Rose becomes determined to strike back at the Germans and manipulates Charlie into helping her cause. But to reach their ultimate target - a massive German warship that patrols a huge lake at the river's end - they'll have to negotiate a deadly double set of rapids, slip by a German fort full of snipers and somehow convert Charlie's leaky little tub into an armed Torpedo Boat.

THOUGHTS: If you love movies you NEED to have this one in your collection. THE AFRICAN QUEEN is a bona fied classic... and for good reason.

THE BLU-RAY: I am delighted to report that this terrific movie has simply never looked better. I've owned it on both VHS & DVD and they pale in comparison to this stunning new Blu-ray release. It is a treat for the both eyes & ears! Every scene just pops and many shots look so crystal clear that you'd swear it was filmed yesterday instead of more than 60 years ago.

336147,5,630150528X,"12-19-13.  Without a doubt in the world, thisn is Bogart's finest film and one of my all-time top tens in movies, for a number of reasons.  Here they are-----#1) Boragrt's portrayal of Charlie Alnutt, though ficticious, is 100% vreedible.  He is a sincere, polite, friendly, shy, wqell-meaning and slightly michevous Canuck living  alone, as a bachelor, in the Central African region during the outbreak of  WWI.  He is indiffereent to this global conflict and is much more interested in maintaining his own floating saloon with his stockpile of gin about the ""Queen,' THE 30 FOOT OR SO, BEATUP, RICKETY, LEAKY, DIRETY AND RUSTY STEAM POWERED OPEN MOTORBOAT.  HE SPENDS MOST DAYS RUNNING UP AND DOWN THE YULAZNGGA, A WINDING, TRECHEROUS And largely unmapped river way thwst provided the transportation and communication with the area's settlements, one of which is a Puritan/methodist  sxstlye Church where brother and sister missionaries, Robert Moreley and Katheerine Hepburn have so dcevotedly made home, determined to protect their ""children"" from the ravenous wolves of Satan.  On oned ofv Charlie's frequent visits, he informs them that a war in Europe has bewgun, with England deeply in it.  As the missionaries prayer for their homerland, GermaNS SHOW UP, BURN THE VILLAGE AND KIDNAP THE MEN AND WOMEN FOR SLAVERY SAHOCKING MORLEY SO MUC H, HE HAS , i guess, a streoke.  Dying soon, as Alnutt returns, he navbs Hepburn and rtogatrher  they flee the settlement for the saFETY OF THE RIVER.  Fter Charlie tells Kate about this huge ancient fortress dowenstream, no used by ther Germans, Hepburn bullies Charlie into building a torpedo and attacking the Gefman gunship the ""Louisa,""  The big dog on the down stream lke, into whic or from which the river flows.  He rthinks, of course, she's batty but she is determined and CHARLIE, BEINGF THE EASY GOING CHAP HE IS, STUBBORNLY COOPERATES.  His drunken scenes are as classic as the poker game in the ""Odd Coupl,"" being reviewed very soon,here.  WE'RE SO USED TO SEING BORAGART as the toughest of tough guys, and he is great at it, this is so suprizing and refreshing, but he REALLY IS Charlie Alnutt, aqnds we believe him.  Not long after the decision to build the torpedo has been made, the travelers are plunged into a SERIES OF RAPIDS ON THE RIVER, AVAOIDING DEATH SEVERAL TIMES BY A SCAD OF SKILL, A LOT OF LUCK AND, SURELY, AS HEPBURN WOULD AGREE, THEY ARE ULTIMATELY SPARED FROM CERTAIN DEATH BY THE HAND OF god, thereby destined to g on to attack the enemy.  As they rejoice they embrace and kiss, quite unplanned and unanticipated.  Both are shocked and embarassed, and, sensing they have done wrong, each of them recoil into their own space to ponder this bold act.  Their reactions are cute and whimsicval, as both actors display what I felt it musdt of been like to fall in love for the first time, something every human should experience at least once in a lifetime.  Some never do, and tha is too bad.  Well, from now on, these two are hooked on each other, and Hepburn's character, now entranced with Mr. Alnutt, looks at him with the heart of a woman in the rapture of her greatest love of her life.  She IS head-over-heels, that is quite clear, but Charlie is still has one foot in the reality of the Louisa, andc hasn't floated off to his own romantic bliss, aas Kate has.
  Charlie builds the weapon and the two clean up and spruce up the old tub, and even make a replica of the British Union Jack flag, seeing hiw ""she represents the Royal Navy.""  Filled with patriotic idealism and bravery, but mostly with love for each other, they while away the few hours left before the confrontation on the lake in romantic dream world, yet set in reality.  All they see is each other, as it should be, and these scenes are amongst the best ever in romance clips in Hollywood history.  Is the geneous of diredctor John Huston, who gives us the real Charlie Alnutt, Bogie's all time best role, and who ewlse but Huston could pull this off?  Hepburn's first half or at least 1/3rd of her role is just recall.  As the missionary sister, she is a spinster, a high class, uppity and somewhazt snobby socialite, transplanted from the ""Midlands"" of England to the oppresiver jungles of Central Africa, called by God to serve, and serve she does.  Still, it's the old Kate wqe see in the afernoon tea sxcene with Charlie, that reminds us of her carreer character type, so why is she such a ""great"" actress?  It seems all she ever did was snobby, overbearing self centered brats.  But here, Houston breaks the string and gives us a very different Hepburn, like the ""new Jimmy Stewart,"" of ht e ""Flightr of the Phoenix,"", a character we've never seen before.  This is a goof reason why I place the director far above the actors, because the film is so much more his tna some vain, look at me egoist, strutting back and forth in from of camera and mirror.  The director is the conductor of a film production, and the finished product is more his than enyone elses.  Yet, he often is ignored or barely mentioned.  Example-----Peter Lorrie, one of my favorite supporting actors.  He appeared in two very different films, the ""Fighting Kentuckian,"" with John Wayne and the ""Maltese Falcon, "" directed by Mr. Houston.  His role in the Wayne movie was awful, his moves telegraphed as you could actually see him looking towards the director fdor his cue to jump into a tavern brawl in the film, and his role as Joel Cairo in ""Maltese,"" where he actually became this siveling, pitiful, deceitful and arrogant little punk. Who gets no respect from Sam Spazde et al.  Why the difference, well, he workewd with a master in the Bogart film and an average director in The Fighting Kentuckian, and that 's the difference.  So, when you select movies, pay attention to who is trhe director and , like me, you may amass a favorites list, mine having John near the top, along with john Ford, stanley Kramer, Ron Howard, David Lean, Richard Attenbourough , and stanley Kubrick, amongst others.  Not all these men's films are ""great works,"" but they do have several top rate .  The photography in the ""AFrican Queen"" is good and filled with action, when needed, but the real gem here is the convincing roles of hepburn and Bogart, the sript and the story.  A film classic the entire adult audience will enjoy and find enchanting, intelligent and 100% entertaining.

336256,4,630150528X,"The African Queen (John Huston, 1951)
[originally posted 13Jul2000]

The best way to watch The African Queen is just after watching White Hunter, Black Heart. Once you've seen the shenanigans that accompanied the putting together of this picture, it becomes all the more enchanting. (One wonders how Huston was convinced to film pieces of it in England, however, since he insisted on shooting the whole thing in Africa, and Viertel didn't elucidate that point in the film version of WHBH; if it's in the book I haven't gotten that far yet.)

For those unfamiliar with the plot (if you've been living in a cave for the last fifty years): A missionary (Robert Morley) and his strait-laced sister (Hepburn) are ministering to natives in what was known in 1918 as German East Africa (at the time of the film it was known as the Belgian Congo, and is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo... you get the idea). The village is burned down by the German occupiers, the missionary dies, and his sister hitches a ride back to civilization with the mail carrier The African Queen, piloted by the hard-drinking Charlie Olnutt (Bogey). Bogey and Hepburn, of course, wind up in a classic romance plot, fighting like cats and dogs until they wind up falling in love.

The beginning of the film is godawfully overacted, mostly by Robert Morley (but the look on Katherine Hepburn's face when she realizes the village is on fire is straight out of a bad silent film). It improves once Bogart and Hepburn are stuck on the boat; Hepburn seems to get more into character, and the chemistry between the two is fabulous. It is, and deserves to be, considered an American classic. ****",1382313600,,1665,4.7543252595155705

336289,4,630150528X,"I saw the movie, read the book, then saw the movie again.

Probably, now that I have the context, one of the top ten novel-to-movie adaptations ever.

The changes they made in the story for the movie were mostly for the good: Rather than trying to make Bogart learn a cockney accent (accents were not his thing) they made the character Canadian. Works fine.  They happied up the ending a bit--not much, really, if you read the book the ending is kind of open, but this is inarguably happy.

Don't know why they insisted on Robert Morley for the brother--that was a misstep. He's great, really, except the book does make more sense, wherein he is as scrawny as Rose, and dying of disease before the Germans arrive.

A great touch in the movie is NOT providing subtitles for the Germans. (In the book Rose spoke German, but since in the movie she does not, avoiding subtitles makes most of us as clueless as movie-Rose when the Germans are talking, which is a lovely device that unites us with the protaganist.)

After Charlie and Rose consumate their relationship--did they or didn't they? they DID--the dialog is so funny, and altered cleverly from the book. Rose realizes after calling him ""dear"" that she doesn't know his first name, finds it out and reacts. In the book it's an internal dialog, ""She thought 'Charles' was a very nice name indeed,"" and in the movie she smugly says, ""Oh, that's a NICE name."" Hilarious. (Hmm. Wouldn't have thought Hepburn for a champion of hook-up culture.  ;)  )

The special effects (1-D mosquitoes, model boat on river) didn't fool my eight year old, but that's OK. This was a long time ago.

The couple's delight as they each find joy in being with another person is so fresh and beautiful--as if neither of them had ever realized it before. That's great acting, putting life into it beyond that in the book and better than the script itself.",1381449600,2,1882,4.624624624624625

336327,5,630150528X,"Two of the screen's greatest stars are only part of what makes The African Queen a movie to cherish. Humphrey Bogart is Charlie Allnut, plying a backwater stretch of a river in the borderlands between British and German claims in East-Central Africa (Kenya and Tanzania today). His tiny ramshackle open steamboat is grandly called the African Queen. Katherine Hepburn is Rose Sayre, spinster sister of Reverend Sayre, (Robert Morley) a forlorn Anglican missionary consigned to the African wilderness. Bogart's portrayal of Charlie Allnut brought all of his talent to bear, requiring a mixture of comedy, anguish, tender affection and heroism that resulted in his only Oscar-winning performance. Hepburn's prissy old maid is at first repelled by the slovenly, drunken boat captain, and her gradual transition into a middle-aged version of a blushing schoolgirl is priceless.

The outbreak of World War I shatters the less-than-idyllic lives of these two characters, putting them together on the African Queen to run the rapids downriver to the lake where a German gunboat waits. One professional film critic described Bogart's character, Charlie Allnut, as a ""rum-soaked Cockney"", while in fact he is a gin-soaked Canadian. The crowd in a Canadian movie theater always responds with raucous laughter when Bogart describes himself as a ""Canuck"".

Anxious fans wondered if this classic was ever going to be offered on DVD and Blu-ray. The delay might have had something to do with the modest picture quality of the original 1951 film, shot on location in the Congo. Regardless, two stars at the peak of their powers, a great story directed by Hollywood master storyteller John Huston, and a high-definition restoration of the film all combine to deliver one of the finest viewer experiences from Hollywood's golden era. An excellent extra, ""Embracing Chaos: Making The African Queen"" is included on the Blu-ray. For old folks this is a visit to the glorious past; for young people it is a chance to understand why that era was golden. Don't miss it.",1377820800,3,2046,5.1782477341389725

From the start-though from different lives the two are drawn together, and fall in love. Watching them hatch a plot to do the impossible -sinking the Nazi boat that blocks the allies from safe passage on the lake-inspite of the insanity of taking the boat down an ""impassable"" river.

With the outbreak of World War 1, he's thrown together by circumstance with Katherine Hepburn---the unmarried sister of a missionary.  This is a great movie because of the acting, the setting, and the plot.

Bogart is at his best here, and so Hepburn.  They both play classic characters, but they are also opposites, which keeps the dialogue lively and entertaining.  This is the role for which Bogart won an Oscar for best actor.  Hepburn was also outstanding.  Release these two greats into the wilds of Africa, and you have the makings of a timeless movie.  The scenery is spectacular with first-rate cinematography.  The contrast of the rusty old boat with the lush wilderness and the fresh river makes for a great background for this adventure.

That African Queen does not fit in that category.  This movie holds up easily, and still has all it's magic.  It's a real treat.  I still get happy and sad watching this movie, which for me, is a sign that it worked.  I have to say, all the people assoicated with this movie (not just two of our favorite actors), did a great job.  I'm very grateful it is on Blu-ray.

The Blu-ray doesn't have a lot of extras, but it does have a feature on the making of, which I thought was pretty cool.  I can't say I am interested in how movies are done, I like it being a mystery, but I do enjoy hearing about the stories behind the making of a film, the human stories.  The feature does a little of this.  It also has numerous language options, and CC, which I like having for all movies I watch.  Not sure why, I can hear fine, but I like reading what is said too.  :)

On a side note, the book/movie ""White Hunter, Black Heart"" adds a bit more to the story as well.  I have not read the book, but the movie was interesting, but no African Queen.",1367107200,,1200,4.090128755364807

But one of the things I really enjoyed was the expressions that crossed their faces at times, making them seem so human and ordinary. I related so many times to Humprey H's wry expressions and sarcasm in the beginning of the movie, he was kind of lazy and laid back and well.. she irritated him for a season because of her disciplined ways. This was an arranged marriage of sorts and the innocence and purity that they brought to these roles was just heart warming. kathy H. a simple homely spinster who always did what was right and Humphrey B. an easy going recreational alcoholic who would later be reformed by the skinny psalm singing maid to become an upstanding man with more character than we suspected. I guess I relate to that as well, you know that saying behind a good man stands a good woman and it really shows how women in particular can take a diamond in the rough and make something out off him. It's a great story about 2 ordinary people who get together and with respect and love can become extraordinary. An interesting story in a time when people are very self sufficient and don't want to take on a problem. Good jobs, great potential and no baggage are definite requirements these days in relationships.

This is a classic with Humphrey Bogart and Katherine Hepburn in the lead roles with a decrepit steam-powered boat as the primary supporting cast.

The African Queen stars Katherine Hepburn and Humphy Borgart. These two talented performers star as two polar-opposite people who, though a series of unsavory circumstances, end up together trying to escape from the Germans onboard the boat, the African Queen. Hilarity, romance, and lots of action and hardship ensue as this seemingly ill-matched couple travel down-river, hoping to destroy a major German ship and aid the British Empire.

The sound is great as well.  One unfortunate side effect of such a clear picture, however, is that the special effects call attention to themselves.  Also, there is an odd disparity between shots that focus on Humphrey Bogart and those on Katherine Hepburn.  He looks detailed--you can see every wrinkle and the stubble of his beard.  But she looks a bit fogged.  This is probably the way the film was shot and not a problem of the blu-ray, but it is noticeably different.  Nevertheless, I highly recommend this version of the film.

336840,5,630150528X,"Originally, I was going to place The Maltese Falcon on my top ten movie list -- it deserves a spot on anybody's Best Movies List.  And for the record, The Maltese Falcon really is on my list.  But since I'm limiting myself to ten (in no particular order), I have to admit that I like Humphrey Bogart better in The African Queen.  And it's not just because Charlie Allnut is a nicer guy.  In a weird sort of way, my choice between the two movies (and the two characters) is like the difference between the dangerous kind of guy and the good guy.  You're attracted to the dangerous guy, but in the end it's the good guy you end up marrying.

Both movies have well-written stories and engaging plots.  But The African Queen has one other bonus: Katherine Hepburn.  While the Maltese Falcon is about one guy, Sam Spade, and his search for the truth, The African Queen is about two very different people whose lives intertwine so successfully, they're able to achieve the impossible (or at least the improbable).

Charlie Allnut is a tugboat captain, an independent guy whose love of freedom has taken him to Africa, a place most Americans will never see.  The political climate there is dangerous, so he has to be both smart and courageous to pursue that freedom.  But he's also a down to-earth-guy, and when he meets Rose Sayer, he feels that they belong to different classes.

And he's right.  She is the sister of a missionary, and her goal is to help people find God.  It's a goal that blows up right in her face, leaving her with ashes, but Charlie rescues her in more ways than one.  Rose feels she has lost everything, but as she and Charlie get into that boat and go crashing down the river rapids into an uncertain future, she makes an observation that is my favorite quote from the whole movie: ""I never dreamed any mere physical experience could be so stimulating!""  She loves that trip down the rapids.  She begins to develop an interest in the boat itself - and in the man who owns it.

Katherine Hepburn wrote a wonderful diary about the making of the movie, The Making Of The African Queen.  They filmed in Africa, and there were some issues with the water which Humphrey Bogart and John Huston seemed to have neatly avoided by spiking that water with a little whisky.  The African Queen is an essential John Huston movie.  Like the cast and crew, the characters are tested by hardships.  How they rise to those challenges defines their character.

The most charming moment in the film happens the morning after Charlie and Rose have obviously been intimate with each other (a moment handled with great sensitivity and discretion), and she says to him, ""Dear - what is your first name?""  This romance binds them together, but isn't the strongest thing doing so.  That would be their mission, which is to blow up a German warship that has moored in the lake at the end of the tributary in which they are struggling.  They may be going through Hell, but it's not High Water they're battling, it's low water, which threatens to strand the boat.  But they refuse to give up, even when things look hopeless.

With equal parts humor and tragedy, their struggle is engrossing.  The resolution of their story is both gratifying and believable.  No superheroes save the day, no wizards throw magic bolts of lightning at each other.  Instead, two people refuse to give up - and they triumph.  That's why The African Queen makes the top ten, with no reservations whatsoever.",1347580800,,3474,4.607491856677524

336934,3,630150528X,"If you own a Wide Screen set, you can skip this review (other than the part about the java based copy protection).

I'm a bit frustrated. This is a Full Screen film. I have a Full Screen television.

I have learned that to somehow magically make Full Screen movies more compatible with Wide Screen sets Full Screen films in Blu-ray are ""window boxed""; on a Full Screen set they only fill 80% of the screen. I don't get how it helps with a WS set, but I accept that it does.

My Blu-ray player has a work around which has ALWAYS worked before (or I wouldn't have bought this): a ""zoom"" setting that increases the entire picture size by the exact 20% that ""Window boxing"" shrinks it. And as Blu has a much higher bit rate than DVD, there is NO visible picture degradation on an old style Full Screen set. The aspect ratio also remains correct.

All good........ right?? Except........ It seems Paramount felt the need to defeat any & all ""zooming"" on this disc; they put in a digital flag that NEEDLESSLY disables the zoom feature on my player.

I really can't say how furious I am without swearing.

If like me you own an older Full screen set, buy the DVD, NOT the Blu-ray.

And, this Blu-ray also has the AWFUL java protection, which prevents the player from knowing where you left off on the disc if you push stop.

I hate that, it leaves 3 options:

1. Watch the entire movie at once
2. Hit pause; but to save the laser pause is only meant for brief stops.
2. Write down the exact time you were at on the disc where you pushed
stop & than seek it next time after going through the 3 minute java
loading process each time.

While I like the high bit rate & LOVE the hi res audio for music discs,
the implementation of BR has been horribly flawed; ""protection"" (that
never defeats pirates anyway) over usefulness to purchasers.

5 stars for the film, 1 star for the lame disc authoring (zoom
prohibition & java protection).

Edit 5/21/12: Since Amazon is combining the Blu-ray & dvd reviews & running the same reviews on both formats:

I rented the dvd. The restoration is nothing short of stunning. It's 100% better than the old official European release. From a Product pov, I would give the dvd 5 stars. It looks gorgeous. Just really irritates me that I had to rent the dvd to watch it after buying the blu-ray!

As far as the movie goes, if you're reading this you've probably already seen the film in some form. My brief opinion: The scenery is stunning, Bogart is his usually tremendous self, Hepburn rarely does much for me & the plot isn't really believable.

Sure wish I could give separate ratings for the dvd & the blu. I continue to be FURIOUS that the freakin' copy guards required me to rent the dvd after I had bought the blu-ray if I wanted to see it in the original aspect ratio as shot.",1336003200,4,2806,4.3795761078998074

336975,5,630150528X,"There is no point in reviewing the film itself. Taking place in 1914, even after 60 years it holds up well. It is not widescreen, but there were no widescreen productions in 1951. What it has, however, is three-strip Technicolor photography, which was not only unusual for a film in 1951 (most were still black and white), but nearly unheard of for on location shooting, particularly in the (literally) wilds of Africa. To understand the difficulty that was encountered in using this process on location, I highly recommend the accompanying hour-long documentary, ""Embracing Chaos."" There is no commentary track, but this fast paced documentary will tell you more about the film than most screen-specific commentaries out there. I also think that it could be argued that the restoration team has made the film better than it looked even in its original showings. This is particularly evident in the minimization of the many process shots. As pointed out in ""Embracing Chaos,"" when originally shot, it was simply impossible to remove the greenish halos around the actors when placed in front of a previously shot scene. Indeed, I was surprised to learn that as much as 50% of the film was shot in England. The integration is amazing. Although there are a couple of obvious miniatures, the Blu-ray definition does not overly magnify them. I cannot imagine the film ever looking better than it does here and the plus of the documentary, added to the fact that you can get it for 15 bucks makes it a no-brainer purchase.",1326067200,17,1516,4.902723735408561

337018,5,630150528X,"African Queen is set in the early 20th century, just before World War I is beginning. A pair of Methodist ministers, brother and sister, are deep in Africa - the lower east coast of Rwanda - hoping to convert the locals. They have a quiet village which they work with. Rose, from England, feels in a way that life has passed her by. She's long past her youth, and she has resigned herself to doing this work until she dies. Her brother even comments that she was thought of as plain, hopeless to marry, and this was her only choice in life.

It's interesting to see how Africans were portrayed in 1951. The locals have ear hangings, shaved heads, braided hair, and scarred faces. Their homes are circular in shape with hay cone roofs, and when they run they keep their arms flat at their sides. I'm curious if these are all true for the Rwanda area, or if there were stereotypes going on.

In any case, suddenly the war hits. This area of Africa was controlled by the Germans, and the Germans burn the village, round up the locals to use as soldiers, and the shock kills the brother. Rose is now abandoned in the depths of Africa, on her own, nobody to turn to.

However, luckily, she has struck up a casual friendship with a hard drinking river boat captain from Canada, Mr. Allnat, who sees what is going on and comes back to rescue her. His thought is merely survival - to find a place to hide until the war blows over.

However, Rose has become incensed with what happened to her village and her brother. She wants to strike a blow back at the Germans - to blow up a local warship. Mr. Allnat thinks this is insane but humors her to soothe her. They start heading towards the ship. They ride the rapids - something Allnat thinks will scare her, but she loves it. They plow straight past an armed fort and miraculously make it through.

Along the way they have their ups and down. Allnat calls her a ""skinny old maid"" - a worthless, washed up woman. She scolds him for being a drunkard and pours out all his alcohol. She litters the river with all the bottles!

In the end, they of course fall in love with each other's spunk, they take on the boat - and against all odds, they win. Their life by all means won't be easy - now they are stranded with no food, no boat, and no support in the depths of a strange location. But they're together, and that's all that matters.

The movie was primarily shot in England, but there were location shots in Uganda and Congo which help to bring a reality to the situation. It's also touching that this is a love story about people who are mature. They have their quirks, they are set in their ways. They have flaws. Even so, they are able to come together and accept each other.

The movie is now over 50 years old, and it does seem a little dated. As mentioned, I find it hard to know if the scenes of African life are Hollywood or real - and I'd like to be watching real characters. To have a woman dismissed as a useless old maid because at 40 she isn't married doesn't carry the power that I imagine it had in the 50s (or in pre-WWI when the story is set). To have Allnat, who has been on his own for 40+ years say ""I am strong! This is my way! Oh wait, you're sad, OK, I will change my lifestyle completely."" also seems a bit sudden. I would have liked to see a more gradual transition.

However, the story and adventures are really just a set piece to exhibit the fine one on one acting between two legends of the profession, Humphrey Bogart and Katherine Hepburn. The initial antipathy that gradually resolves into mutual respect and affection thru the course of their trial by fire is entirely believable, very funny, and often painful (for the characters, not the viewer). Bogart delivers what may have been his best acting performance.

This film was shot on location in Africa, which was pretty rare for that day. While the shots of Africa's scenic side won't trump what you have become used to seeing on the current crop of HD nature shows, it was remarkable for its time.

This is a must see classic for all fans of great cinema, and is a sterling example of how two top notch actors can hold the stage and your rapt attention virtually by themselves for an entire movie.",1298678400,3,1106,4.690721649484536

The film did however show up as a region 2 release in 2003 for DVD), ""The African Queen"" arrives on Blu-ray looking as majestic as possible. Paramount has done a marvelous restoration on the film restoring much of the luster lost with the passage of time.

I'm going to skip doing a summary of the plot of the movie since others have done a fine job of that (and most fans who have seen the film before don't need to read it). ""The African Queen"" came along at just the right time in both Bogie and Hepburn's careers as the Black List threatened to swallow them up like it did many other major stars of the time. Huston's direction and the script he wrote in collaboration with James Agee are both marvelous and filled with wry humor and observations about our characters.

Colors look quite nice and detail is remarkably sharp considering how badly the original elements of the film have aged and degraded with the passage of time. Kudos to Paramount for making sure that ""The African Queen"" was released in a restored version rather than just pulling the best looking print available for home video.

The only (minor) complaint I have is with the newly generated opening titles which are very close to the original titles but have some slight variations. Most folks won't care and on the whole it's a very, very minor point even for fans of the film.

The documentary ""Embracing Chaos"" Produced by Nicholas Meyer and directed by Eric Young gives us an intimate behind-the-scenes glimpse into on location production of the film. Making good use of interviews with assistant director Guy Hamilton, Lauren Bacall, actor Theodore Bikel, archival interviews with director of photography Jack Cardiff, Bogart, Hepburn, Huston and intercutting rare home movie footage, ""Embracing Chaos"" gives fans and first time viewers a strong impression of the challenges of the location shooting of the film.

I saw this 35 years ago and it was as fresh and exhilarating on this viewing as it was in my youth.  Alas, being of a certain generation and quite American (my wife and kids are Europeans), I was the only one in the family who was so utterly enthralled.  But enthralled I was, as they tolerated my enthusiasm.

This is a lovely story about a spinster, thrown into the chaos of life when her brother breaks down because of the vicissitudes of war.  She has lived in an ethereal world of religion, probably as a virgin in her late 40s, and experienced little in life though has observed much as a colonial missionary.  As a refugee on a boat with a drunk, she hatches a plan to contribute to the war effort.  The two of them discover an extraordinary synergy, to renew their lives and move into new territory.  They bring out the best in each other and, of course, fall for each other.  It is absolutely preposterous, and their relationship might be doomed, but I loved and believed every single second of this film.

337101,5,630150528X,"This was the movie that started my interest in Humphrey Bogart about 35 years ago, and I've been patiently waiting for its release on DVD. Well, this package is worth it!

The restoration is one of the best I've seen--fabulous Technicolor, great sound and a smooth, seamless movie. The bonus documentary is interesting, and a copy of Hepburn's book, along with the lobby cards and a three-strip Technicolor frame card are also nice extras.

The film may be simple in plot, but certainly makes up for it in the characterization. Bogart is cast against type as Charlie Allnutt, the scruffy Canadian machinist in the wilds of Africa who pilots The African Queen, a tub that has seen better days, and makes the most of the part, showing himself to be adept at comedy. Hepburn is perfect as the missionary Rose Sayer--a plain spinster who turns into a brave woman as the movie progresses, planning to run the African Queen down the river to sink a German battleship, much, at first, to Charlie's dismay. Charlie and Rose change and grow, falling in love, and this is delightful to watch.

John Huston got the most out of his stars, and his direction is perfect. With two pros like Bogart and Hepburn, he really didn't have to do much--they work well together, and are totally convincing.

In all, one of the best films of the 1950s, and great performances from its two stars. A must-see film that I am constantly recommending to those who think that Bogie was just a ""tough guy"" actor--he was very versatile, and deservedly won the Oscar for this role. And, Kate Hepburn is no slouch, either--she's fabulous, and should have won an Oscar, but she lost out to Vivien Leigh (A Streetcar Named Desire)--a shame, really.

337111,5,630150528X,"Humphrey Bogart and Katherine Hepburn headline this tale of tragedy, adventure, admiration, and, eventually, love.  Bogart is the worldly, hard-drinking skipper of The African Queen, a small steam-powered riverboat by which he plies his trade up and down one of Africa's central rivers.  Hepburn is, ni teh meantime, the devout sister of a missionary trying to do God's will in Africa.

When WWI breaks out and war reaches its tentacles into central Africa, German-controlled central Africa becomes a hostile place for expatriots of all Allied nations.  Bogart finds Hepburn alone after the death of her brother and he reluctantly, but mainly out of duty takes Hepburn aboard the African Queen in an effort to elude the Germans and to prevent them from capturing the boat and using it for their own purposes.  They flee downstream on an adventure few people had ever tried, facing all manner of hardships along the way.

Finally they follow the river int the delta leading into a large African Lake.  My favorite scene takes place when Bogart has to get out and pull the African Queen through the mud and muck in an effort to avoid starvation and madness.  They are alarmed when a German gunboat appears...and Bogart and Hepburn decide to take drastic action.

Though this film is now quite old, I would not say that it is dated.  Of course some of the special effects are outmoded, but the acting is fantastic, the drama palpable, and there is edge-of-your-seat suspense.

Katherine Hepburn and Bogart should have been a good pairing and the story is ripe with potential. Two polar opposite people forced together in a dangerous environment (Africa) at a dangerous time (WWI), this could have been pure gold as all the ingredients for a great story are present.

Sadly, the story is slow and boring and the acting is pathetic and laughable. The story starts with Rose (KH) and her brother as missionaries in Africa when the Germans come and round up the villagers. Charlie Allnut comes and then leaves and then comes back as the brother kicks the bucket in a over-dramatic stage show way. Rose goes off with Charlie and the stupidity really hits an all time high after this.

The dialog is really the worst part of the film with Rose saying Charlie Allnuts name as a comma throughout. ""Mr. Allnut, are you familiar with the river Mr. Allnut? Ok Mr. Allnut, what is in that box Mr. Allnut? Mr. Allnut I have to pee Mr. Allnut and Mr. Allnut it looks like Mr. Allnut rain."" YES it is that stupid.

Soldier ants three inches deep on the hut floor, hornet nests alongside the river bank, twenty crocodiles ready to eat you for breakfast should you actually venture into the river, dip your feet in the black rotten water of the river to dissipate the unbearable heat and a parasite called a Jigger Bug would lodge itself between your toes and eventually kill you though liver failure... When you listen to Jack Cardiff's spectacularly good feature-length commentary on the actual filming of ""The African Queen"" in 1951 (he was Director Of Photography), it's a small miracle that this beloved independent gem ever got made at all...

Escaping the suffocating McCarty trials in the USA at the end of The Forties and beginning of the Fifties (Bogie, Hep and Huston were all considered to have lefty affiliations), Director John Huston set off to Africa to film C.S. Forester's 1935 novel on location (an unheard of thing at the time). He dragged with him huge and cumbersome Technicolor cameras, his sickness-prone crew and Jack Cardiff's two lamps and small generator. 1st location was in Biondo on the Ruiki River in the Belgian Congo, 2nd location was Uganda and 3rd was back in the UK (all shots that required actors getting into the river were done in water tanks in London because the Ruiki was just too dangerous in real life).

Their trials and tribulations throughout the shoot are truly the stuff of Hollywood legend - Lepers carried their equipment, they bunked in bamboo huts with all manner of creepy-crawlies joining them under the netting and an African hunter who had been supplying them with meat on a daily basis was led off by authorities for suspected cannibalism (natives going missing). The water was contaminated with parasites (neither Huston nor Bogie got sick because they were gulping back whiskey), the boiler of the boat almost fell on Katherine Hepburn and nearly killed her (she was ill throughout the shoot, but trooped on), tropical rain storms turned pathways into rivers of mud, swarms of flies ate their skin and they couldn't do their necessaries because two deadly black mamba snakes were lurking in the latrine...ouch!

You learn most of these fab titbits from two sources - Jack Cardiff's commentary and a truly superb near 60-minute feature called ""Embracing Chaos - Making The African Queen"" (with or without subtitles). It includes contributions from large numbers of luminaries and those actually involved in the movie - John Huston and Katharine Hepburn (excerpts from The Dick Cavatt Show 1972/1973), Guy Hamilton (Assistant Director), Sir John Wolff (Producer), Angela Allen (Script Supervisor), Theodore Bickel (officer on the German boat), Desmond Davis (Clapper Boy), Jack Cardiff (DOP), Lawrence Grober (Huston's biographer), William J. Mann (Hepburn's biographer), Laurence Bergreen (James Agee's biographer), Eric Lax (Bogart's biographer), Natasha Fraser-Cavassoni (Sam Spiegel's biographer - Producer/Financier), Warren Stevens (Bogart's friend), John Forester (C.S Forester's son) and Martin Scorsese. There's even clips of and stuff about Lauren Bacall as Bogie's husband, camp cook, medical helper and general all-round on-set good person. Their romance was genuine and real and it's treated with great affection here. ""Embracing Chaos..."" is a feast of detail and beautifully put together storytelling - it really is.

The ""Posters & Lobby Cards"" extra has 6 posters (in full colour) and 6 lobby cards - a treat to look at. The ""Star Profiles"" of Bogart, Hepburn, Huston and Cardiff turn out to be on-screen info snippets which are good rather than great. The ""Behind The Scenes"" stills are photos on set with animal noises in the background - again not great. And the trailer only shows you how washed out the original film had become.

Which brings us to the print itself - it's GLORIOUS. Digitally restored in 2009, the vast majority of the film is a joy to look at. Sweat on the hairs of Bogart's arms, the lipstick on Hepburn's lips in the church scene at the beginning, the rusty and stained woodwork of the old boat itself, Robert Morley's huge bug eyes as he watches the natives huts burn...it's all beautifully rendered.

There are drawbacks - the aspect is old-school and filmed as such, so when your player actually throws the print onto a modern-day widescreen TV, it's in a centred box. However, if you adjust it to fit the whole screen, I still found it fitted well and without too much compromise to stretching. There are also sections where there's slight blurring of the focus, stock footage of the river that was damaged - but - and I stress this - it's miniscule. As I stood back from the 42"" Sony and looked at the print - I was gobsmacked at how beautiful it looked almost all of the time.

But the film itself belongs to the astonished lead duo of Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn playing Charley Allnut and Rose ""Rosie"" Sayer - an American gin-sozzled steamboat Captain and a straight-laced prim and proper English Missionary lady. James Agee's wonderfully loaded dialogue spiked up the tension between the two at first, then the slow burning romance and then the mutual appreciation of each other (Huston loved beautiful losers) right up the hoisting of the Union Jack and the patriotic torpedoing of a German gunboat at the very end. Such was the chemistry and force of their brilliant performances - both actors virtually reinvented their careers on the back of the movie (Charles Laughton and Betty Davis had initially been thought of for the parts). A genuinely amazed and humbled Bogart even nabbed the Oscar from the clutches of Marlon Brando and Montgomery Cliff.

This BLU RAY reissue is a triumph because it works on the two most important levels - the print is as lovely as it's ever going to be and the two main extras match that.

""The African Queen"" is 60 years old next year and this superb 2010 Blu Ray reissue does that enduring classic proud.

Recommended big time.

Disc One is the movie in glorious Technicolor and the bonus is a comprehensive video presentation showing the massive effort required to film ""The African Queen"" along with in-depth background information regarding the people both in front and behind the cameras. The second disc is a 57 minute audio CD of the Lux Radio Playhouse broadcast of ""The African Queen"" starring Humphrey Bogart and Greer Garson.

Finally, a heavy card is included that demonstrates the Technicolor three color dye process. This in itself was quite an eye opener for me.

But no need to imagine--just buy this Blu-Ray disc. Forget about the ""Sex and the City"" nymphos; Hepburn and Bogart show what middle-aged sexy is all about.

Simple quest story--steer a leaky old tub with a dying steam engine down an unnavigable and danger-filled African river and blow up an armed-to-the-teeth German steamer so a key lake can be accessed by British troops during WWI. The rest is the chemistry between Kate and Bogey.

If, like me, you haven't watched this movie in a while, you will find this release a thoroughly enjoyable re-visit. It may well even jolt some older memories of when you had first watched it -- the scene with the leeches brought me briefly back to my childhood.

If you are younger and have never had an interest on ""old movies"", because they are mostly in B&W, or for whatever reason, you may find that watching this early Technicolor film might just kick-start an interest in watching other movies of the era, of which there are so many to enjoy, as you will realize how brilliant some of them were, particularly in their simplicity relative to current movies.

Of course there are many options for viewing this film, so only you can decide if the cost of the blu-ray version warrants the $21, since the impact will be felt, no matter what the delivery system is. For me, it was well worth it.

337317,5,630150528X,"Simply put, the Blu-Ray remaster of THE AFRICAN QUEEN is the greatest Blu-Ray restoration I have seen so far!!
Sure, the restoration is on par with those of CASABLANCA, THE WIZARD OF OZ and GONE WITH THE WIND, but we've seen close restorations of these films over the past 20 or so years. What I'm saying is that - In comparison to the previous DVD release of AFRICAN QUEEN, it is the greatest restoration I have seen!!

After reviewing the original DVD release of THE AFRICAN QUEEN from the early-2000's, I was blown away by the amazing difference from this DVD to the Blu-Ray.
The original DVD appears not to have been remastered at all, but simply transferred from the film tapes to digital format. It is scratchy, grainy, pixelated and the sound is muted, tinny and in what sounds like is a Mono mix.

With the viewing of the Blu-Ray version of the film you will not a crisp, colorful picture (In fact there are colors here that you would have never seen in the film before). There is NO pixelation, distortion or scratches on this film print, even the text during the opening sequence will blow you away!! While Bogart and Hepburn row down the Amazon, we can see beads of sweat on Bogie's forehead, the dirt on his jacket and can see every bit of detail in their clothing!!
And the sound is another thing - What we have here is a full 5.1 surround sound mix of the films audio!! If you have a surround system - You will be indulged in the sound that wraps right around you, instead of listening to it through your one tinny front speaker as you would on the DVD version.
If you don't have a sound system - simply, the sound will still be stunning. There is no tinniness, it's great to listen to.

This restoration makes the film seem brand new!! Anyone who isn't in the know could mistake this for a film made just yesterday!!

If you are a fan of this movie, or of the classics - yet you own it on DVD - YOU MUST STILL BUY THIS BLU-RAY!!!
You have not seen THE AFRICAN QUEEN until you see this amazing restoration!!",1271980800,4,2021,4.352785145888594

337320,5,630150528X,"The new blu-ray restoration of the classic 1951 film, ""The African Queen"" is so breathtaking, especially given the age of the film and the fact that a decent print of it had not been seen in decades, that it looks as if it was made yesterday. The accompanying documentary on the making of the film is just as entertaining as the film itself.",1271462400,2,341,4.428571428571429
337321,5,630150528X,"There have been previous home-video transfers, but they looked pretty bad -- mostly because the movie itself did. Three-strip Technicolor has a very short tonal scale. When shooting outdoors, where you have almost no control over the ""lighting ratio"", if you hold back the exposure to avoid burning out the highlights, you block up the shadows. And vice-versa. As a result, ""The African Queen"" has always been a dark, muddy-looking film. *

The edition, transferred from the three-strip elements, is a huge improvement. The colors are livelier and there is considerably more shadow detail. You can even read /every last word/ in the magazine Morley is perusing. And the terrible sodium-screen travelling-matte shots have been fixed to the point where the matte is almost unnoticeable. (Unfortunately, nothing can fix the miniature boat with Charlie and Rose figures, used when The African Queen has to go over a fall or traverse the rapids. It's even more ""obvious"" in Blu-ray.)

What can I say about the film, a classic among classics? I don't understand how anyone can /not/ like it, but there are young fogeys as surely as there are old ones. I've seen it many times, but on this viewing I was particularly aware of just how funny it was, especially Bogart doing a Bugs Bunny imitation when dining with Hepburn and Morley. According to the excellent documentary (the only bonus, unfortunately), the distributors weren't too keen about a film with ""two old people running up and down the river""! As the French say... ""The more things change, the more they remain the same.""

I also realized on this viewing that maybe Charlie and Rose, uh -- well, you know. But if they did, it's suggested very subtly.

PS: When Charlie offers to bury Rose's brother, and asks ""Got a spade, miss?"", what I'd /like/ to hear her reply is so utterly non-PC that I can't post it here.

* Jack Cardiff, the cinematographer, brought two small lights and a generator specifically to fill in the shadows on medium and close shots. But they couldn't illuminate a jungle.",1271462400,4,2047,4.887608069164265

The only small gripe I have with this product is that it apparently does not include the audio commentary that cinematograher Jack Cardiff recorded for the UK Carlton Video DVD edition. That's by no means an overwhelming loss given the quality of the package as a whole, but it does mean that blu-ray purchasers don't get to hear Cardiff's insights into the challenges and dangers of working on location in Africa, like the fact that the Queen's steam boiler was actually a heavy copper construction that threatened to topple onto the actors at times, or that the plague of flies that our heroes endure was actually shredded feathers being blown around in a glass-fronted box in front of the camera lens.",1271203200,,938,4.826086956521739

The video had moments of sharp clarity for example the lace trim on Rose's dress in the first scene, mixed with occasional moments of graininess. The video on the whole made a positive contribution to the enjoyment of the movie.

If you have been waiting as long as some of have to add this movie to your collection, I urge you to take the plunge and buy this edition. I was delighted to see that it even fit in the rack with my other Blu-ray discs in spite of its thicker size.

I remember when Lux Radio Theater was on the air; our family would gather around the old Philco radio and listen to that program plus many other radio programs that were to us exciting and eagerly awaited. We would turn off the lights and the glow of the dial on the Philco would be the only light in the room. If one were so inclined, one could recreate the feelings listeners in the 1930's and 40's had by playing the CD in a darkened room and letting your imaginations roam the wilds of German East Africa along with the Queen, Rose, and Charlie.

I'm truly pleased to have this in my collection!

Update 4/14/2010

Reviews dated before March 23, 2010 refer to something other than the Blu-ray release being featured here by Amazon!

Some of the reviews are dated several years before this restored Blu-ray version was even released; the criticisms made about disc technical quality do not refer to this release. As you read the reviews it is critical that you check the date to confirm that the comments on disc quality actually apply to this particular version. If care isn't taken in that regard one can get a completely erroneous impression of this present edition!

This one, which was 6 years in preparation after three strip negatives were discovered in London, looks very clear and sharp and is definitely a keeper!

Update 5/23/2010

It was pointed out to me in comments that I could have been more precise in my update of 4/14/2010; I was only referring to disc technical quality, not reviewers comments on the acting, history, or other non-disc quality aspects of the older reviews. In many instances the older comments on history, actors and acting are timeless; I have revised my earlier update to clear up any confusion.",1270771200,6,2852,4.50968992248062

337347,5,630150528X,"The African Queen has finally made its debut on DVD! When the format arrived in 1997 the film had already seen at least one VHS release by Fox as well as a notable release on laserdisc, also by Fox, in 1995. The laserdisc release was notable because it included collectable packaging swag like the shooting script; a full-sized set of lobby card reproductions and a copy of Katherine Hepburn's 1987 memoir, The Making of The African Queen or How I went to Africa with Bogart, Bacall and Huston and almost lost my mind.

The laserdisc was followed by no other home video release for 15 years. Hollywood is an industry that likes to double and triple-dip movie releases on DVD and someone has lost a fortune on this classic which should have been released over 10 years ago. I think even a bare bones release on DVD using the laserdisc transfer would have been acceptable while the film was being restored and remastered.

One of the reasons for this delay is the unique history of the way The African Queen was financed. The film was an independent production released in 1951 at a time when the studio system was teetering over the cliff and in its final years. John Huston had the clout to finance an independent production, especially with Humphrey Bogart and Katherine Hepburn as co-stars. Based on the 1935 novel by C.S. Forester, the property was once owned by Columbia and later Warner Bros. and that's probably were Huston first became interested. Sam Spiegel purchased the film rights and financed the movie. He would later work with David Lean on Bridge on the River Kwai and Lawrence of Arabia. The film would eventually be distributed by United Artists and go on to win a well deserved Oscar for Humphrey Bogart.

The production is well documented in the Hepburn memoir and the 1953 novel by Peter Viertel, White Hunter, Black Heart. The book is a thinly veiled retelling of the making of The African Queen while filming in Africa. This book was made into a terrific 1990 movie directed by and starring Clint Eastwood and makes a great companion to The African Queen. Viertel, a friend of Huston, went on location in Africa to work on the screenplay after original writer James Agee had a heart attack. Viertel's biggest contribution was the climax of the story.

The new DVD and Blu-Ray comes with an excellent one-hour documentary, Embracing the Chaos: Making the African Queen. The commemorative box set includes a CD of the 1952 Lux Radio Theater broadcast with Bogart reprising his part from the movie, a set of mini lobby cards, a mini copy of the Hepburn memoir and a Senitype card with four 35mm frames of the restored Technicolor film used to remaster the DVD and Blu-ray. No trailer and I would have enjoyed an audio commentary, but at least the movie is finally out for home viewing. The African Queen looks better than I've ever seen it in the theater on TV or previous home video incarnations.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/White-Hunter-Black-Heart/dp/0440398096/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">White Hunter, Black Heart</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/White-Hunter-Black-Heart-Ws-Dub-Sub-Dol-Ecoa/dp/B003AWRMCY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">White Hunter Black Heart (Ws Dub Sub Dol Ecoa)</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Making-of-the-African-Queen-Or-How-I-Went-to-Africa-With-Bogart-Bacall-and-Huston-and-Almost-Lost-My-Mind/dp/B000VAODFW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Making of the African Queen Or How I Went to Africa With Bogart, Bacall and Huston and Almost Lost My Mind</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-African-Queen-1400-Headwords-Oxford-Bookworms-Library/dp/0194791645/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The African Queen: 1400 Headwords (Oxford Bookworms Library)</a>",1269907200,10,3856,5.855871886120997
337348,5,630150528X,"This newly released DVD of the legendary classical film The African Queen(Dec/51)restores the film to its original glory. In fact I have never seen it looking this good in all the years I have viewed it.
The film opens in a missionary run by Rev. Samuel Sayer(Robert Morley)and his sister Rose(Kate Hepburn)in Central Africa in 1914. During the sermon the congregation is interrupted by the arrival of one Charlie Allnut(Humphrey Bogart),a Canadian who first came to the country to work in construction but is now his own boss ferrying supplies up and down the Ulangi river in his old battered boat The African Queen. After a prim and proper tea hosted by the Reverend and his sister,Charlie heads back to the open river saying he won't return for about two months. Soon after his departure the Germans arrive,round up the villagers and burn their homes and the mission to the ground. Rev. Sayer ultimately loses his mind and succumbs to death leaving his sister alone in the desolate surroundings. Allnut returns sooner than expected after hearing rumblings from the natives of what exactly the Germans have been up to. He takes care of the burial of the Reverend and the pair head out down the river to find refuge. Revenge is on Rose's mind and she persuades Charlie to go down river to the lake where there is the German ship ""Louisa"" which patrols there. It is her thought that Charlie can rig up some explosive torpedoes out of oxygen cylinders on board his boat,put them on the bow and then steam into the ship thus sinking it. Charlie agrees but is sure the river's dangers such as falls,rapids and shallows will be enough to dissuade her from thinking she can actually accomplish it.
His feelings are soon put to the test as they encounter their first set of rapids. After a very bumpy and unsettling ride through Charlie says to Rose that she has probably re thought her ambitious plan and wouldn't blame her if she gave up. The experience has had the opposite effect and she is exhilarated and is more determined than ever to carry through. Charlie is beside himself and decides to have a few drinks. Unfortunately this has an undesirable side effect and Charlie gets quite obnoxious towards Rose and insults her. Next morning a hung over Charlie awakes to his entire stash of gin being dumped into the river and a scorned Rose giving him the silent treatment. After a few minutes Charlie finally apologizes and Rose tells him it wasn't his remarks that infuriated her but his backing out of their deal. Charlie relents and agrees to carry on.
Their next major hurtle is a French fort over looking a section of the river. They barely make it by as the rifle fire they take riddles the steam engine and tears the hose. They pull over so Charlie can make repairs. Both are so jubilant at surviving that they hug and kiss each other. After an awkward few moments they passionately embrace and both realize that love has somehow touched them both. The morning after the night before Rose serves him breakfast in ""bed"" and finally asks what Mr. Allnut's first name was;after all Mr Allnut at this point is way too formal! After several more harrowing experiences farther along the river and with forced major repairs to the boat's propeller and shaft,they finally reach the river delta which empties out into the lake. However the farther they go, the more the delta grass closes in on them. Eventually Charlie and Rose are forced to get out and pull the boat through the reeds. Along with the oppressive heat and brackish water,leeches are the newest problem to confront them.
At the end of the day they are stuck on mud flats and can go no farther and become resigned to death. That night rains come down upstream which filters down to the hapless travelers and raises their boat out of the flats and into the lake which was ironically only about 100 yards,unseen,away from them.
They put their original plan into action and Charlie makes and places two explosive ""torpedoes"" in either side of the bow,sticking far enough out to impact the German ship. That night they spot their target and head out into open water to sink her. Along the way a storm brews up and the African Queen flounders and they have to abandon the boat. Both are picked up by the German ship and are interrogated then sentenced to death as spies. Charlie gets his last request to be married to Rose and just as they are about to be hanged the ship hits the partially submerged Queen and sinks. Rose and Charlie are now in the water and cannot believe their luck that they did what they set out to do and are still alive. With their futures before them they swim to the lake's nearest shore.
The African Queen took the best actor honour at the /51-52 OSCAR ceremonies with Bogie getting what would be his one and only in his 35 year long acting career. Close but no cigars were Hepburn for best actress,James Agee and John Huston for the screenplay and Huston again for director. The story is fairly simple but well written and is greatly enhanced by its' principals Bogie and Hepburn as both are in top form here.
Technically the film has been beautifully restored and remastered in a hi-def print which is simply gorgeous;it has never looked as good as it does right now. It is full screen and its' main special feature is an approximately 60 minute documentary on the making of the film. You will find there was as much going on behind the camera as on.
If you have been waiting for the best print of The African Queen you can possibly get,then wait no more my friends;as this is one classic that is a must own by all!",1269907200,4,5601,4.607607607607608
337349,5,630150528X,"I've always loved this movie, but watching it on t.v. or regular DVD left much to be desired. There always seemed to be scratches and dots in the viewed print. But Bluray technology has removed ALL those annoying distractions. What a treat to watch this classic film as if it were a 1st run premier. Bogie and Hepburn were simply perfect in these roles, and Huston's direction was positively inspired. Watch this one again, and be wowed as never before.",1269820800,4,453,4.675
337350,5,630150528X,"Wow, wow, Wow!  It's one thing to experience recent blockbusters on Blu Ray, but it's even more impressive to experience an old classic like this in an entirely new light.  Is it really possible to make a 60 year old movie look brand new?  Apparently it is.  This has got to top my list of best Blu Ray transfers ever.  The color sparkles and dazzles with such depth and clarity that Michael Bay couldn't have done it better.  You can literally see and feel the sweat dripping off Bogart's face.

After watching the brilliant&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casablanca-Blu-ray/dp/B002VWONB2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casablanca [Blu-ray</a>] on Blu Ray I saw hope for old movies to become better than ever, but I never imagined I'd see a color film look this good.  Wizard of Oz also got a good transfer, but it doesn't compare to The African Queen.  It is SO clear!  What I don't understand is how movies from the 80's and 90's are getting such terrible Blu transfers while these old movies are coming out looking better than The Dark Knight.

Okay so to the point - if you've never seen The African Queen before you're in luck! James Agee writes a brilliant screenplay that takes two dynamic characters that you love more and more after they go through each adventure.  If you're turned off by old movies because of their grainy quality, have no fear!  The transfer is STUNNING and looks positively brand new.  If you have seen the movie before and just don't know whether or not the upgrade is necessary well let me assure you it is.  If this movie holds any place in your heart, it is absolutely well worth getting this Blu Ray.  It actually blows my mind how they can make a movie that looked so OLD look so perfect.  But perfect is the only word to describe it.",1269734400,11,1811,4.809061488673139
337351,5,630150528X,One of the longest anticipated films on home video has finally been released in a studio authorized version and the results do not disappoint. We all know what a timeless masterpiece this film is so I will not say anything more in this regard. I would rather comment on the stunning transfer of the blu-ray disc. It was like watching it again for the first time! The old technicolor process that was used at the time is wonderfully reproduced with no bleeding colors and minimal grain. Although the sound is mono it too is very well done. Don't expect a widescreen picture because it was made a year or two before the first cinemascope film. The only complaint I have is the lack of special features. It does have a very good hour long making of feature. However I know Paramount is capable of doing better when you consider what they did with their Centennial Collection which is comparable with many Criterion releases. All in all this is a superb quality blu-ray. Now if only someone would give this kind of attention to The Quiet Man I would gladly kiss their blarney stone!,1269648000,3,1078,4.590673575129534
337352,5,630150528X,"I'd like to just confirm  what others have written,  this is just one of the greatest films of all time. To rate this anything less than 5 stars would be ridiculous for no other reason than the film is simply wonderful. If you have never seen it then wonder at the direction of John Huston, and the acting of Katherine Hepburn and understand why a smallish mumbler named Humphrey Bogart has consistently been rated as the screens greatest male icon....oh and Hepburn wins on the female side.

Now to the latest and long awaited DVD and blu-ray release...the news isn't as good. There is a nice 1 hour making of documentary which is a bonus to be sure but there are problems. Firstly I have a foreign edition (UK) of this DVD from quite a few years back and it has a stunning commentary by the films legendary cinematographer Jack Cardiff...that is MISSING on this ultimate edition? WHY? I can tell all you cinefiles that his memory of the filming is priceless and added so much to my enjoyment of the DVD I picked  up from the UK and to have it not included in what should be the definitive issue is  sad....I'm sure it was a money issue but they should have bought it from Carlton (the original company that released it)...and that inexpensive release also had the film ""Trailer"" that the definitive issue does not?

The Blu-Ray looks spectacular...and that is great to report. As far as the normal DVD I will give the nod to the new DVD on the restoration, although at times I  prefer the older edition for its snap/contrast. Ultimately , I  just believe that Warner Brothers would have done a far superior job on this than Paramount and there are too many things that could have been added...goodness this is truly one of the greatest films of all time and for years has been the number 1 movie requested by DVD buyers of films  yet to see a big time official release. To me this is a bare bones style of release and quite lacking in bonus features considering its place and the actors involved.

Bottom line..the Blu Ray looks terrific and the making of is nice....I just expected more.",1269475200,5,2090,4.519893899204244
337381,5,630150528X,"Now, I will admit it...I was never a great fan of John Huston's ""The African Queen"", as I viewed it's television airings, over the years. The story was too sappy (with an atypical, for Huston, 'happy' ending), Bogie was silly, rather than cool, the rear-screen effects during the rapids scenes looked pretty artificial, the overall picture and sound was poor...well, you get the picture!

So I purchased ""The African Queen (Commemorative Box Set)"" with reluctance, more for the special features than the film, itself...and BOY, was I in for a SURPRISE!!! With the cleaned-up audio and video elements, the film looks and sounds brand-new, and I could finally truly savor the remarkable performances of Bogart and Hepburn (Bogie won the 'Best Actor' Oscar in the role, beating, among others, Brando in ""A Streetcar Named Desire"", and Clift in ""A Place in the Sun"", and after viewing this edition, I can honestly say he deserved it!) Jack Cardiff's technicolor cinematography is breathtaking (even if he calls it 'routine', in the marvellous 'Making of' documentary, included), and the Agee/Huston adaptation of C.S. Forrester's novel crackles with witty one-liners and humanity. The boxed edition also includes a one-hour Lux radio adaptation, starring Bogie and Greer Garson, Katharine Hepburn's funny written account of the production (""The Making of The African Queen or How I Went to Africa with Bogart, Bacall and Huston and Almost Lost My Mind""), lobby card photos, and a four-panel recreation of how classic technicolor works...lots of goodies at a very reasonable price!

The only extra on the single disc blu-ray is a new one hour documentary on the making of the film. It's very good and in high definition too.

There is a missionary chapel in a village where the minister and his sister lead the congregation in a song. (Some don't look too religious to me.) A small steamboat approaches. [Is it too small to carry much cargo?] A brawl outside attracts the men from the chapel. The captain isn't too silent. [Can a minister be promoted if he marries wealth?] The war will delay the mail. Enemy aliens can be imprisoned. [The captain's opinions seem anachronistic.] German troops arrive to burn the village and disperse the people. Samuel is shocked by the events and dies. The captain explains why they must flee the German forces. [Why are English missionaries in German lands?]

Rose has plans to fight for Britain! Charlie goes along with her plan. [Believable?] The personal interactions keep the story going. The boat travels down the white-water rapids. Can gin purify river water? [Is this product placement? Is the film too talky?] There is danger is going down the river. Shots are fired at them. There is another perilous passage through rocks. They repair the mechanical problem. [This pads out the story.] Bugs are plentiful by the river bank. Will they get lost? Are there leeches? Will the boat get stuck in the mud? A heavy rain raises the river and lifts the boat, they drift into the lake. [Does the film drag here?]

The presence of the gunboat is a new hazard. Can they attack the 'Louise'? [Believable?] Is their attack suicidal even in the dark? They are caught in a forbidden zone. The penalty is death for spies. But there is an accident! There is a happy ending, mission accomplished.

I have watched this particular DVD once and have set it aside with no intention of future viewing.  I plan to seek out a better copy for my DVD Library.

337418,4,630150528X,"The African Queen ranks #17 on the American Film Institute'sits Top 100 Movies Of All Time. It also stars the AFI's number one actor (Humphrey Bogart) and actress (Katharine Hepburn) of all time. It won a clutch of Oscars in 1951.  So why does Hollywood refuse to restore or reissue this John Huston Technicolor classic? Beats me.

I love this great romantic adventure filmclassic, but at this time I will give it just four stars. Why? Reason One: See above paragraph. Reason Two: The Korean all-region DVD import version, while currently the best one available, is flawed.

There is a very small but noticable ""stutter"" in the fast movements of people, animals or water when they run across the camera lens; therefore, those objects are also a tiny bit out of synch with the accompanying sound. I grant that perhaps only former  Kodak film technicians (read: nerds) like me will even notice this, but for us it's like the tale of the princess and the pea. One little thing can really spoil it for you.

Otherwise, all things considered, the overall DVD quality is decent. Most images are clean; colors are vivid and true. The sound is reasonably clear but could use some cleaning. As others have noted, unwanted spoken languages and subtitles can be turned off easily in the DVD's features section. Of course, there are no special features. But English-only speakers should listen to Charlie and Rosie nitpick at each other in Korean at least once to get another perspective on the couple's initial cultural divide.

I will amend this review when The African Queen torpedos her way out of the Hollywood film vaults and demands that she get the royal treatment she deserves.

Update OCT09: Hollywood has heard us! The African Queen is getting her long overdue Hollywood re-release with what I hope is a first-class restoration. I've just pre-ordered the Blu-ray version as this year's Christmas present to myself.

337450,5,630150528X,"There are three primary reasons you might want to see this old black and white classic.

First it is a beautiful and touching love story.  Strait-laced teetotaler (and maiden sister of a preacher) Rose Sayer (Katharine Hepburn) meets a kind of ordinary joe who is a handyman deluxe sort of guy, Charlie Allnut (Humphrey Bogart) a man who is a bit crude and likes to swill his gin.  They're in the middle of Africa during the Great War.  Her brother has been killed, the Germans have the natives where they want them and, well, Charlie has an old river boat and offers to give the high-toned woman a ride.

There is nothing quite like the sparks that fly from opposite poles.  And yes, opposites do attract, but of course it takes them awhile to feel the magnetic force.  The beautiful thing about this love story is how Charlie proves his mettle and wins her heart--a heart never won before--by sheer gumption and by finding the courage he never knew he had--egged on and inspired by her relentless strength of character.  The moment that she realizes, despite all the differences between them, that she loves him is beautifully and exactingly captured by John Huston's superb direction.

The second reason to see this cinematic masterwork is the performance by Katherine Hepburn.  She has given many outstanding performances; there is hardly an actor anywhere held in higher esteem, nor one who has had a more lasting and admired career.  I have seen many of her movies but never have I seen her better.  She is just perfect for the part and delivers every line with style and a deep understanding of her character.  She allows us to understand that Rose's crazy, nave beliefs about what is possible infect Charlie to the extent that he becomes something more than himself, and it is that self that she falls madly in love with.

The third reason is the inspired performance by Humphrey Bogart.  This is not the usual worldly-wise, tough guy that Bogart usually plays.  Instead he is an ordinary, though pragmatic joe who knows his limitations.  He didn't last this long as a self-styled river boat captain without taking certain precautions in what he would venture and what he would not.  Yet, so taken with the relative status and the exquisite high-toned righteousness of Miss Rose Sayer, he is able to do things that ordinarily he wouldn't try.  And when she falls in love with him, he is amply rewarded, and the audience loves it.

I should add that shots of the boat, the African Queen, and of the animals along the river and in the river seemed authentic and atmospherically perfect even though I've seen a couple hundred much more modern African nature videos.

By the way, this movie contains the famous quote, spoken by Miss Hepburn: ""Human nature, Mr. Allnut, is what we were put on this earth to rise above.""

One more thing to add: the movie was adapted by C.S. Forester and James Agee from Forester's novel.  Those are two of the best writers to ever work a Hollywood screenplay, and it shows.  The dialogue and the development of character and story are exquisitely done so that one is lost in the events and only returns to the real world when the movie ends.

337455,4,630150528X,"This is almost strictly a two-person movie with Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn dominating the story and screen time. It's a likable classic film because of those two famous actors, a nice romance, good adventure and even some comedy thrown in to the mix.

 I'm shocked a well-known film with these actors still isn't available on DVD in Region 1, as of 2009.  That's just ridiculous. Hopefully, they'll produce a sharp Blu-Ray disc of this film.

The two actors squabble in the beginning but I like the fact that the film didn't go on too long in that regard as they did in many old-time battle-of-the-sexes movies. The story also a little unusual in that neither lead actor is in his/her prime, meaning it's almost a middle-age romance story.

Once they become enamored with each other, the movie mainly goes into the trials the two have in piloting this boat, ""The African Queen"" down river with the goal of reaching a German ship and blowing it up. Yes, it's a World War II movie, of sorts.

To be honest, the film does slow down a bit in the beginning of Bogie and Hepburn's romance but the last 30 minutes finish strong with one obstacle after another hitting the pair of adventurers, and it's interesting to watch.",1241740800,4,1227,4.657407407407407

337457,3,630150528X,"The title to my review (ripped from a Blue October song, since, like, I've been obsessing over them this past week) is probably how a lot of you are going to feel towards me after you read this review.  I'm sure that I'll receive quite a few comments and or e-mails degrading my taste and telling me that I don't know a classic when I see one (could this rival the response I got from my `Terminator' review?) and so on and so forth.

The point being that I completely understand that my opinion is not that of the general consensus, but when has that ever prevented me from stating my case?

So, let's get right into it.  I was apprehensive about this review going into it.  I've been sitting on this one for months, since I saw the film for the first time, and thankfully it reaired on TCM a few weeks back and so I was able to catch it again and reconfirm my sentiments.  While I understand why some like this movie, `love' is another equation, and so the response to this film and to a lesser degree the performances within it are astounding to me.

The film simply follows a riverboat captain in Africa as he offers a missionary an escape down the river from invading German armies.  They hate one another, but then suddenly love one another as they bond over their decision to try and attack the enemy warship.

The film tends to drag in a lot of places.  The pacing is poorly distributed at times and so the film can be a tad boring.  The action sequences seem forced and even corny at moments and the overall love story between the two is far fetched and unbelievable.  Sure, the chemistry between Hepburn and Bogart is there and so they make a lot of the film work even when it shouldn't, but their chemistry only takes the film so far.  The script needed a little more work (I abhor the ending too, which could have really gone a long way to redeeming the film had it stuck to a more realistic and harsh reality) and thus felt almost thrown together in parts.

Sure, the film is gorgeous to look at, but pretty is only part of the equation.

This brings me to the performances.  We'll start with Bogart, since he actually won the Oscar.  I like him, a lot even.  I consider his `Casablanca' performance one of the best of all time and find that his each and every performance is at least entertaining.  I noticed though, while watching this movie, that he was resting a little too much on gimmick.  I never really saw anything real with him.  He reminded me a lot of Denzel Washington (even his facial expressions, voice and mannerisms; it was crazy) in one of his showier roles.  He's all flash and gimmick and very little heart.  I was shocked by this, because I am a fan, but that is honestly what I saw.  Knowing that he beat out Marlon Brando, who was not only better (in `A Streetcar Named Desire'), he was LEAGUES better, makes this performance resonate even lower for me.  Then we have Katherine Hepburn.  I am not the biggest fan of hers.  I think that she is serviceable always, but only great once in a while.  Here she was great.  I truly mean that.  She wears concern so well that her face alone was acting circles around Bogart.  She captured every emotion, even the corny and out of place ones.  I believed her entirely.

She saved this movie, for me, from being awful.

So, that is just my feelings on the matter, but I wholly understand that I am basically alone in this.  I know a few who feel as I do, but judging from the reviews posted, they are not on this site.  Alas, I hope that my review doesn't offend you too much.  I'm sure we agree on something else.",1239840000,6,3590,4.328335832083958

The film was fine. We called the TV store first and they told us that ""All Regions"" would be fine on our TV screen which is a Sony.

337579,4,630150528X,"Keeping in mind that I watched this film on the subliminally par VHS option, I must say that ""The African Queen"" is a film that will bamboozle the senses, while cautiously telling the story about a daring duo in Africa.  What brings questions to this film, nearly 56 years since its initial release, is not so much the characters, or the story, or the location, but the transition from 50s cinema to modern.  Film studies coursework aside, one can tell the elasticity of a film by watching it again (over five decades later) and if it can continue to stretch, it has beaten through the space/film continuum.  Was it enjoyed as much the first time as it was the 100th time?  These are great questions to ponder as you watch another round of ""Breathless"", ""Brief Encounter"", or even ""Grand Illusion"" for the millionth time.  Time, like age, can either be a blessing for films or a curse.  ""The African Queen"" is a difficult one to pinpoint.  On one hand it stars giants like Bogart and Hepburn direction by John Ford, while on the other hand it suffers from serious plot holes, sinking character development, and some over-burdening outside connections.  I finished ""The African Queen"" today with bewilderment - it wasn't a disastrous film, nor was it the expected ""breathtaking tour of Africa's wild side"".  There is power behind the working forces of ""The African Queen"", but they need to soon realize that the elastic is pulled to the point of no return, without releasing a DVD soon - they will a broken film with time not on its side.

If one asked who the five most important characters were in ""The African Queen"", it would be simple.  They would be Hepburn, Bogart, Africa, Germany, and finally the boat itself (side note - none of these are in any symbolic order).  These are all of the elements that we, as the viewer, are asked to be involved with throughout the course of the 104 minutes.  Bogart is easy, on the eyes, ears, and soul.  He embodied the surly captain with no care in the world.  He was funny, captivating, and in control of every scene he was involved.  Hepburn was a good counter-balance, but not that powerful of a character.  She was weak when she was meant to be strong, insulting when kind, panicked when excited, and obviously had never been down rapids before in her life.  Bogart had the swagger, Hepburn had the cue-cards and patented voice.  They had chemistry, but more like a high school romance than a heated cinematic one.  Bogart deserved the Oscar.  They were great to watch on-screen, even as goofy as I thought Hepburn was, the pacing of the film and their dialogue kept me in motion.  I loved what 50s cinema tried when doing a destination shoot.  Africa was brought to the masses - in pre-production format.  Campy cinematography deterred the faithful viewer away from the story because plastic mosquitoes and leeches were an eye-sore.  It must have been amazing at the time to see Africa in its glory, now it seems forced and overwhelming.  Then, let's not forget, the Germans.  What good 50s film doesn't enjoy a good frolic in a wooded area without those pesky Germans lurking about?  They were hams - all of them, but they brought a beginning, center, and end climax to this claustrophobic film.  Finally, there was the African Queen herself, an aging professional that had more stories to tell than Ford would allow.  It may save the day, bring a couple closer together, or even be a drinking buddy.  Either way, these are the characters that create ""The African Queen"", whether you like them or not, they are with you throughout the journey.

As mentioned, the acting is bearable.  The cinematography will definitely need a strong re-vamp when transferred to a DVD.  The story itself keeps you seatbelted to your seat for the 104 minutes ... than why do I find myself so unfocused about my thoughts with this classic.  Finicky with the characters , what juggles my mind with this film more of the overall platter than just one part of the serving.  I didn't connect with the character, that's obvious, the story was fun - but at the same time seemed very dated and overwhelming.  In one scene Bogart is afraid of the rapids, in the next leeches, in the next mosquitoes, but is never afraid to sleep outside without shelter.  What can be irritating is that Africa really isn't all that frightening in this film, for being the major antagonist; I needed dark and seedy nights followed by blistering hot days with unbearable living conditions.  Hepburn sweat, Bogart drank - that was about it.  The boat itself was actually the scariest part of the film because of the cramp living area.  While it did feel like the ""African Queen"" grew and shrunk between scenes, there was this sense of claustrophobia that couldn't be replicated in other films.  There was tension, confusion, and panic on this boat, as well there should be, but it needed to be heightened.  The terror level needed to go up one more notch - Bogey wasn't duct taping his windows.

Overall, ""The African Queen"" is a classic.  There is never a reason to argue against that.  It is a classic, however, that is slowly deteriorating over time.  The sets are aged, the special effects are ""MST3K""-able, and the acting (albeit fun) seemed cheap by the end.  Set upon the background of the bestselling book by the same title, this is one of those that one should probably read prior to watching.  Descriptions could mean life or death, and only the printed page will give us a true sense of emotion.  I think I will add this film to my collection when it comes out, I could watch it again - but not side by side.  Bogey is the character that steals the show, while Africa - in all its glory - seems to be short changed in the long run.  Symbolically this film will be taught in film classes until the end of time, but for me, it seems to be loosing steam around each bend.  I am not afraid to say that I got scared when rushing down the rapids or wading through the reeds, but I wasn't sold on the idea.  Huston had the talent, he could have controlled his environment better.  A classic yes, but will it remain that way?  Guess I am back to wondering how many licks on the old Tootsie Pop for now...

As the Germans take over the village and force the natives into service, she and Humphrey Bogart, a working class Canadian steamboat pilot, must try and escape down the river and get out of German occupied Africa.

This is half an odd-couple unlikely romance story, half an African adventure story. As such it doesn't really do a good job of either. Hepburn and Bogart must deal with rapids, waterfalls, leeches, biting bugs, and German forts, but it really pales by the standards of today's action films. In fact even by the standards of the time there isn't near as much jungle adventure as there is in say a Tarzan movie. (In this day and age of CGI sets and backgrounds, however, it is nice to see a film from back in the days when they actually used real scenery.

To me, the film is an egalitarian love story.  During the voyage to reach the German ship 1) Charlie and Rosie fall in love with each other; 2) the audience falls in love with both of them; and 3) everyone except the Germans fall in love with the lovable Tub That Could, the African Queen. Under Huston's masterful direction we experience metamorphic character developments: The scampish Charlie becomes domesticated and the prissy Rosy becomes a ""regular"" gal. At the same time, we enjoy watching them both become British heroes as they instill in each other the courage and determination needed to fulfill their objective: Rosy persuades Charlie to rig up the African Queen as a home-made torpedo boat and, after overcoming many hardships, they finally meet up and clash with the German warship. (That Bogie sounds as British as my uncle Louie from Brooklyn is forgiven in this saga--he won an Oscar for his performance, anyway--Bogie, that is, not my Uncle Louie.

There's been some confusion about this release, so let me clear things up.

Because of some of the things I read, I waited for a long time before finally ordering one of these for myself.  Now I see there was no reason to hesitate.

This is a ""just fine"" print of the movie.  There's nothing ""wrong"" with the picture or sound--aside from simply being a dated production that has not been ""remastered"" in any way.

It's basically the same thing you would get if you carefully dubbed a very good copy of the VHS tape to DVD (which may actually be what they did!).

The picture and sound are basically as good as what you would have seen on your TV set back when this was first broadcast on network television.  In other words, there are no ""flaws"" that would in any way distract from the enjoyment of the drama.

Contrary to what another reviewer reported:  Yes, the Chinese subtitles are on by default--BUT THEY CAN BE TURNED OFF.  It's easy to do.

Someone was wishing that this release was ""wide screen.""  Sorry, but this would be IMPOSSIBLE.  The movie was ORIGINALLY FILMED IN 4:3 RATIO.  (""Wide screen"" ratios did not exist until a few years after this movie was made.)

I'd gladly give this title SIX STARS!  But since I'm reviewing the technical merits of THIS SPECIFIC DVD RELEASE (rather than the artistic merits of the movie itself) I gave it four.

Is this version a Chinese bootleg?  I suppose it's possible.  These are put out by a small company in Hong Kong.  But I took a chance, because unfortunately, it's the only REGION-1 version of this movie on DVD right now.  So until they come out with a better version, I'm glad I've got this one.

337665,5,630150528X,"""The African Queen"" was Bogart's fourth film to be directed by John Huston and his performance in it was very likely the best in his career as well as one which finally won him an Academy Award... He beat out Marlon Brando, who was heavily favored to win for ""A Streetcar Named Desire.""

The screenplay by Huston and the celebrated movie critic-writer, James Agee, matched Bogart with Katherine Hepburn in what amounted to a two-star tour de force in a deeply touching romance linked to adventures and heroics...

Bogart and Hepburn were delightful as they infused their personal conflict with a warmth, humor, and tenderness rarely seen in films... Mixing comedy and adventure, it was a two-character film, in which Hepburn gave a fine demonstration of her ability to develop within a role... The sensitive interaction between her and Bogart (in an unfamiliar guise) undoubtedly benefited from her many films with Tracy...

Bogart was given a rare opportunity to demonstrate his range as an actor, more than holding his own opposite the formidable Hepburn... He played many scenes with maximum effectiveness, down impossible rapids, where he becomes covered with leeches and suffers a severe fever attack, his drunk scene where he rebels against Hepburn and mocks her high-blown speeches, and the tender moments in which he realizes he's fallen under her bewitching spell...

""The African Queen"" was not an easy film to make, most of it being done on location in the insect-infested, suffocatingly hot and humid African Congo... But the result was a brilliantly entertaining film, a successful mixture of comedy, character and adventure...",1166227200,23,1640,5.1773584905660375

337691,5,630150528X,"The reputation of this deserved classic rests primarily on the shoulders of master director John Huston and his two legendary stars, Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn. The story itself, penned by Huston and James Agee (with uncredited help from Peter Viertel) based on a novel by C.S. Forester, is a two-character high adventure that moves its narrative in a rather contrived manner. Yet, the resulting 1951 film sparkles in a burnished aura of Hollywood lore, as Clint Eastwood saw fit to make a film about the production itself with 1990's ""White Hunter, Black Heart"" and Hepburn herself wrote an entertaining memoir 36 years after the fact with the seemingly apt title, ""The Making of the African Queen: Or How I Went to Africa With Bogart, Bacall and Huston and Almost Lost My Mind"". Between Bogart's apparent boozing, Huston's big game obsessions, Hepburn's idiosyncrasies and the challenging African jungle, it must have been quite an unpredictable set.

Set at the outbreak of WWI in 1914 German East Africa when there was an unabated frenzy to colonize and convert the native Africans, the story focuses on Rose Sayer, the prim sister of a missionary who just died from fever and dementia after the Germans invaded and destroyed the village in which they were living and holding mass. To escape the pending return of the Germans, she joins Charlie Allnut, the boozy steamship captain who runs supplies - including torpedo shells and the makings of explosives - along the Ulanga-Bora River. She concocts an ambitious plot to use the explosives aboard Charlie's boat, The African Queen, as a means to destroy the powerful German gunboat, the Louisa, which rules the large lake at the end of the river. Charlie reluctantly agrees, and their perilous journey takes up the bulk of the film. Even though the ending is a bit far-fetched, it doesn't matter much by that point since the characters have so completely ingratiated themselves with the viewer.

What makes the film memorable is how the characters evolve from lonely souls who have given up all hope for happiness in their lives to the heroic defenders of the British Empire whose mutual patriotic dedication turns to love. Lesser actors would have been defeated by the sharp corners of the sometimes incredulous plot turns, especially Rose's lightning-quick turnaround on Charlie's charms, but Bogart and Hepburn are so completely in their element that the contrivances actually become part of the allure of the movie. Both have given more accomplished performances in their careers, but neither has appeared more winning than they do here. A Huston favorite, Robert Morley has a few effective moments at the beginning as Rose's reverend brother Samuel, and toward the end, Peter Bull brings appropriate Teutonic bluster as the captain of the Louisa.

Obviously inspired by the real-life locations he uses in the Congo and Uganda, Huston directs the proceedings with passion, and he brings genuine excitement to scenes such as their conquest of the rapids and Charlie's dredging of the boat through the mud. More importantly, he allows the two stars ample room to generate the chemistry that has made this such an enduring classic. Jack Cardiff's cinematography is appropriately evocative for the first color film by either star (or for the director for that matter), though some of the later scenes, especially the storm sequence, feel comparatively claustrophobic given that they were obviously shot inside a studio tank in London. As a true must-see among Hollywood classics, it is disappointing that the current DVD package is quite sparse, even though picture quality is relatively good. The movie cries out for a refurbished release from the Criterion Collection.",1138579200,11,3735,5.139802631578948

Hepburn plays the spinster sister of a missionary in German East Africa at the outbreak of World War I. When war breaks out, German troops enter the village, round up the natives and club the parson. After a few days, he dies and Hepburn is left on her own until Bogart makes his appearance. He plays the captain of a river boat and offers to help her escape. While doing so, she hatches a plan to use his boat as a guided torpedo to sink a German gunboat on the lake that lies between them and British East Africa. Bogart thinks he is just humoring her but gets sucked further and further into the plot. She manages largely because Bogart falls in love with her.

The two battle the Germans, the wildlife, the river, the flies and each other. They come through it deeply in love. It is a nice story with a surprising ending.

Bogart and Hepburn play two diametrically opposed personalities in this classic film set during World War I. She is a prim and proper, middle-aged English missionary. He is a gin-soaked river rat living by trading up and down the Congo River from a ramshackle old steamboat named The African Queen. They are thrown together by a German offensive that leaves them isolated and in danger of being captured and held as prisoners of war (or worse, they could be shot as spies). To escape, they must travel down the river past the Germans. What follows is part comedy, part tense drama, and part high adventure. The river and its wildlife pose as much of an obstacle as the Germans, and Bogart and Hepburn must not only learn to get along, but to trust in, and rely on, each other to survive.

This is a wonderful movie. The acting is superb (Bogie got an Oscar for ""Best Actor""), the story is excellent, and the scenery is beautiful (it was shot on location).

The story is set in the early 1900s in German controlled colony in Africa.  Hepburn's character is a Methodist missionary there with her brother from Britian when WWI starts.  Bogart's character is a river-trader who hops from village to village delivering goods.  After German troops burn Hepburn's village and her brother dies, Bogart comes to hide her away from the Germans.  Hepburn gets some patriotic zeal and some unrealistic ideas and cons Bogart into following her schemes by praying on his good heart.

337718,5,630150528X,"Familiarity can sometimes numb us to how very odd a movie is, and that is certainly the case with THE AFRICAN QUEEN.  Most polls that have been done in recent years typically denote Humphrey Bogart as the greatest movie star of all time, and frequently Katherine Hepburn gets the number two slot (and always gets the number one slot for women).  Yet, these roles are almost antithetical to everything else they ever did.  Bogart, the great man of action of CASABLANCA and THE MALTESE FALCON and THE BIG SLEEP, is reduced to a dirty, disheveled, lewd, drunken captain of a remarkably inconsequential boat with the profoundly self-mocking name of ""The African Queen.""  Hepburn, who has made her career playing unbridled, liberated, and self-assertive modern women, here is a prudish (though only for a while), repressed, tightly wound spinster.  But despite this highly unusual pairing, the film was one of the finest that either was ever in, netting Bogart his only Oscar (and unbelievably, only one of three nominations) and Hepburn what was something like her 200th Oscar nomination.  It seems perverse that the only other two nominations were for Best Director (Huston) and screenplay (the great James Agee and Huston).  I'm not sure how a film can get nominations for four of the top five awards and not get nominated for Best Picture, but it did (the five films nominated that year were the deserving AN AMERICAN IN PARIS [the winner], the somewhat censored A STREET CAR NAMED DESIRE, A PLACE IN THE SUN [which has not aged well], and the considerably less deserving QUO VADIS and DECISION BEFORE DAWN).
Today we take filming on location for granted, but in the 1940s and 1950s, few producers and directors opted for filming on the spot upon which the film was supposed to take place.  Films might go to a famous locale and shoot a couple of scenes for realistic flavoring, as with a couple of scenes in ON THE TOWN or AN AMERICAN IN PARIS.  Many Westerns had been shot on location, but that was no great challenge given the close proximity of Hollywood to Western locales.  John Huston had previously filmed THE TREASURE OF SIERRA MADRE in Mexico, but going to the Congo and Uganda for extensive filming had rarely been attempted (sorry, all those Tarzan movies were filmed in California).  It was a spectacular undertaking (which Katherine Hepburn recorded in a book she wrote about making THE AFRICAN QUEEN).
There is a war plot that provides the setting for the film, but to be honest it really isn't very important.  What is crucial is the remarkable dynamics between Bogart and Hepburn, as they go from loathing one another, to liking, and then to loving.  It has to be the most unlikely love story in the history of film, and yet somehow these two great actors not only manage to sell it, but make it quietly majestic.  There is not much in the way of cast to speak of, apart from the two leads.  Robert Morley manages a small but memorable part near the beginning of the film, but Bogart and Hepburn utterly dominate the film's onscreen time.  Luckily, they have no trouble pulling it off.
As odd as this film was, there had been attempts to make it into a film for quite some time.  If one is familiar with Bette Davis's career, there had been a couple of attempts to film it with her in the lead with various leading men (including James Mason).  But surely Katherine Hepburn is the perfect Rose Sayer.  Like in THE PHILADELPHIA STORY, she can communicate self-righteousness better than anyone.  Davis would only have managed egotistical haughtiness.  But I'm sure everyone would agree that the casting ended up being for the best.",1076198400,192,3645,4.763116057233704

Starring Humphrey Bogart as Charlie Allnut and Katharine Hepburn as Rose Sayer.  Directed by John Huston.
The one thing I remembered most about The African Queen was the mosquitoes and leeches, used very effectively to intensify the struggles of Charlie (Bogart) and Rose (Hepburn) as they set out on an impossible mission.  Charlie is the mailman, traveling by use of an old steamboat tub called The African Queen.  He happens to be on hand when Rose loses her bother when he dies after their African missionary is burnt down by the Germans, at the beginning of World War I.  Rose decides that they need to sink the German gunboat patrolling the waters, using a crude bomb mounted on the African Queen to ram the gunship.  The rest of the action and plot develope around their relationship and struggle to sink the gunboat.  Charlie likes his gin and Rose, being a missionary, doesn't tolerate Charlie's lack of social skills.
I believe that the character development, with both Charlie and Rose ending up not exactly fitting into the stereotypes they start out with, is an important part of the movie.  The movie had realism, although some scenes could have been produced better.
Humphrey Bogart won his only Oscar for this film, although I believe he had better roles and did better work.  Katharine Hepburn does a great job as the ""crazy, psalm-singing, skinny old maid!""  I enjoyed this classic and recommend it highly.",1075766400,7,1447,4.873469387755102

337739,5,630150528X,"Directed by John Huston, this film attracted increased attention following the death of Katherine Hepburn and I fervently hope that it will soon be available in the DVD format. Of course, she is superb as Rose Sayer and her performance may well be her most fulfilled as she (Rose) evolves from a priggish spinster who initially views Charlie Alnutt (Bogart) as something to be scraped from his boat but over time develops grudging respect, admiration, and then even love for him. For whatever reasons, the film was nominated for only five Academy Awards and received just one (Bogart for best actor) but during the 52 years since its release, it has achieved well-deserved stature as a ""classic.""
Back to Katherine Hepburn for a moment. According to her own account, she was unsure how to portray Rose. Huston suggested that she play the role as if she were Eleanor Roosevelt. Throughout much of the film, she faithfully follows that suggestion. In one of the film's most glorious moments, she falls totally in love with the scruffy and sometimes irascible but undeniably courageous Charlie. Of course, by that point in the narrative, he feels the same way about ""Rosie."" All of her inhibitions and defense mechanisms are overcome by this kind and brave little man with whom she soon faces almost certain death.
It is worth noting that Huston enlisted James Agee to help him with the screenplay, based on C.S. Forester's novel. It is also worth noting that the production lasted much longer than expected and the working conditions in Africa were often intolerable. Those who are curious to know about all this are urged to read Hepburn's own account in The Making of the African Queen: Or How I Went to Africa With Bogart, Bacall and Huston and Almost Lost My Mind. It is also worth noting that Robert Morley has a small but pivotal role as Rose's brother, the Reverend Samuel Thayer. His death so early in the film achieves several objectives, notably enabling Rose to depart with Charlie because, had Thayer lived, he would have emphatically refused to leave his mission and she would have insisted on remaining with him. Also, I think, Huston wished to introduce elements of menace and danger as early in the film as appropriate. As a result, he suggests that are many other life-threatening perils through which the small boat and its two passengers must navigate their way.
For these and other reasons, I hold The African Queen in highest regard as I impatiently await the film's availability in the DVD format. Presumably the supplementary materials will be of a quality comparable with those now provided with the DVD version of other great films such as It's a Wonderful Life and Singin' in the Rain. I can almost hear Katherine Hepburn adding, ""They better be!""",1058313600,8,2771,4.872881355932203

After all, every guy I know loved it - not really something you can say about just any Katharine Hepburn movie, but then again, it does have Bogie in it... But, I am glad I did agree to watch it because after the first time through, I was hooked.
  The story is a little cheesy, but fun. Missionary brother and sister live in the heart of Africa before World War I. Bogie is  a boat captain that drinks a lot. The German Army comes through and burns the village where the missionaries live and the brother goes crazy and dies. That is where the adventure begins.
  Bogie agrees to take K.H. down the Ulanga River to get away from the Germans. What they find is that while they drive each other absolutely nuts, they are in love. Ultimately they are captured by the Germans and are married by the captain before they are to be hanged as spys. Before they can be hanged however, torpedoes they had made end up blowing up the German's boat and they get away singing and swimming together.
  While the movie is definately a previous generation's mindset, it is still fun to watch today. K.H. and Bogie are totally natural together have fun with their roles. I would definately recommed this movie to anyone that asks.",1051574400,5,1275,4.4935064935064934

337742,5,630150528X,"After a somewhat discordant and irreverent beginning we meet a Spinster Rose Sayer (Katharine Hepburn) and her brother who are missionaries in Africa in 1914. Charlie (Humphrey Bogart) arrives in his steam-powered boat and after delivering their mail, he delivers news of World War I. Almost immediately the Germans arrive and burn down the entire village. Distraut, Rose's brother dies suddenly from shock and she is left wondering what will become of her.

When Charlie arrives back and sees the destruction, his immediate impulse is to save this damsel in distress and the two are thrown together by circumstance in a mission so improbable, it is almost comical. Together they attempt to sail down an African river on ""The African Queen"" in order to attack the Germans. To do this, they must pass by a German fort and survive the rapids.

Charlie: There's only one little thing wrong with your idea. There ain't nothin' to torpedo.
Rose: Oh yes there is.
Charlie: There's what?
Rose: Something to torpedo.
Charlie: What's that?
Rose: The Louisa.
Charlie: The Louisa! Oh now, don't talk silly, Miss. You can't do that. Honest you can't. I told you before, we can't get down the Ulanga!

This is all Rose's idea, more than likely due to her romantic notion of the world. She is determined to have her way and sees Charlie as a way to help save her country. She becomes horrified when he starts to drink gin and the absolute shock she expresses reminds me of the story of Miss Jones and Ginger Ted in The Vessel of Wrath by W. Somerset Maugham.

As Rose would say: ""Nature, Mr. Allnut, is what we are put in this world to rise above."" As Charlie is in a drunken sleep, she pours his gin into the river, bottle by bottle.

Eventually Rose has to let go of her civilized English ways and starts to rely on her wild natural instincts. Fighting a river becomes the most exciting experience of her entire life and she enjoys this new feeling of being completely unconstrained in her passion for this new adventure.

Forced to rely on one another, they start to show their strengths and weaknesses. Fighting the river causes respect to be born and this grows into love.

To me, this entire movie is almost a metaphor of marriage. The calm times when you can relax and enjoy the scenery and the stressful times when you are holding hoping for better times. Just like this trip down an African river, marriage takes courage and staying there may in fact test the bedrock of your character.

Sometimes you don't want to be sailing down an African river, you'd rather be in Bali. But maybe Bali wouldn't build your character the way an African river could.

Adventure, romance, comedy and an unexpected conclusion.

337743,5,630150528X,"I really, really loved this movie! It is a great adventure story, with a wonderful plot and great dialogue between the two stars thrown in as a bonus. Also, it features great perfomances from the silver screen's most legendary stars, Katherine Hepburn and Humphery Bogart (both ranked #1 in all-time female and male legends, respectively).
Essentially, The African Queen is about an uptight missionary's wife living in Africa named Rosie (Katherine Hepburn). When Rosie's brother dies, she is forced to flee the area on board The African Queen, a small boat run by the gruff, hard-drinking Mr. Alnutt (Humphery Bogart, in a Oscar winning performance). They have many adventures together, and, pretty predictably, get to know each other much better after initially hating each other. My summary really doesn't do justice to this movie, but be sure that The African Queen is incredibly entertaining!
Additionally, because this movie was actually shot in Africa, the scenery is breathtaking. All in all - practically a perfect film. Exciting adventure, romance, great dialogue, quirky characters, and Kate and Bogie! What more could you ask for in a movie?",1027123200,6,1153,5.237837837837838
337755,5,630150528X,"Pros: Bogart, Hepburn, cinematography, writing.
Cons: A bit stereotypical. Maybe some racist themes.
Humphrey Bogart won his first and only Oscar as Charlie Allnut in John Huston's classic adventure ""The African Queen"". As the captain of the steamboat The African Queen, and regular mail deliverer to Rose Sawyer (Katherine Hepburn) and her brother, he takes Rose along with him after her church and living area is destroyed by Germans and her brother dies of a fever. The two decide to make the most of their predicament by traveling up the treacherous Ulanga and Bora rivers to a large lake patrolled by the German Gunboat Louisa. Here, they plan to prepare a pair of oxygen cylinders with explosive, rig up a detonator and ram the Queen into the ship. It is presumed impossible to travel upriver, but they do it anyway. The experience is a challenge for both, as they have to work together in order to survive rapids, German soldiers, steam boiler troubles, mosquitoes...and leeches (""If there's one thing I hate, its leeches. Filthy little devils"").
Though I usually don't use awards to judge films, some have questioned as to whether Bogart deserved this Oscar. Perhaps it could be he poked fun at his usual tough guy image by playing a drunken captain. Nevertheless, he is excellent in the role, being charismatic, romantic, charming and funny. I mean, who would have thought he could do such animal impressions. Hepburn, at first, seems like a stereotype of a proper lady. She is often, during the first half, dressed like a lady, talks and acts like one (Some might also point out her tea drinking). However, she looses that stereotypical image. She knows that in order to survive, she needs to be strong willed. It also helps that she discovers she loves sailing the rapids (""I never dreamed that any mere physical experience could be so stimulating."").
(Note: The paragraph reveals plot details. So beware). Eventually, they get to the end of the river, only to find it impossible to get across a marshland to the lake. Both of them are also at the end of their string and predict that death is imminent. However, because of a prayer Hepburn makes, it rains and the boat is floated onto the surface, with Charlie and Rosie being suddenly revitalized. This part, to me, seemed a bit unlikely and maybe even predictable. However, God does act in mysterious ways. As to whether it's possible or not can be debated elsewhere. Anyway, Bogie and Hepburn cross the lake and spot the Louisa. They prepare and ready the torpedoes and the ship, only to have their boat capsize in a storm and the couple is captured and put on trial aboard ship. Fans of ""Dr. Strangelove"" will recognize Peter Bull as the ship's captain. The captain finds Rose and Charlie to both be guilty and sentences them to be hanged. However, he fulfills one last request by Charlie: He marries them. Little does he know that he's inadvertently bought time for fate to step in. The Louisa is hit by the capsized Queen, with those cylinders jutting out of its bow. I don't think I need to say what happens next.
Now, why is the movie somewhat racist? When Charlie makes his first appearance, as his boat sails into the village, an African is seen lighting Charlie's cigar. The man, however, seems happy. Also, later on as the Queen sails past a German fort, there are several blacks around there. Then again, these people were captured and put into slavery like crazy. So the movie might just be trying to be honest. The ending was also somewhat empty-handed. Now I know that not every movie can end in one neat little package, with all the loose ends tied up. In fact, I sometimes prefer if these movies don't. Still, I wonder if Charlie and Rosie survived. Well, they have one thing going for them: Unlike Captain Willard in ""Apocalypse Now"", at least they're still sane.
The photography looks real nice, with a lot of it being shot on location in Africa. Through it, we see the beauty and danger that is the Ulanga and Bora Rivers. The writing is filled with danger and witty dialogue, and the direction is quick to the chase and focused on development of the two leads, who for most of the film are the only ones on screen. This was the fifth film that John Huston made with Humphrey Bogart, with the others before this being ""The Maltese Falcon"" (Also Huston's debut film), ""Across the Pacific"", ""Key Largo"" and ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"". Bogart and Huston made one more together, ""Beat the Devil"". Anyone of these movies would look good on your video shelf.",1026864000,2,4539,4.717884130982368

It gives great joy to see two great stars convey transformation and romance within the simple story of a trip downriver.  As another reviewer I read noted, a love story centered on a middle-aged couple also offers fare not often found in today's Hollywood.

337758,4,630150528X,"Two completely different people with conflicting sets of values thrown together in a tense situation.  This is the core of the story.  It was a notable movie because it was truly filmed in Africa, unusual for those times.  The charismatic stars, though both getting older, drew audiences.  It was based on a popular novel by C. S. Forester, a popular adventure writer.  The war theme was still popular although the time period was World War I
and the movie was made while World War II memories were still fresh.
However, I believe that it was the basic theme that I stated in the first line of this review that gives the movie a feeling of greatness.  Two opposites thrown together.  They face danger together.  And they come up with the plan to sink the German boat.  And so their seemingly conflicting personalities mesh together.  Naturally, they fall in love, and this is psychologically sound.  A man and a woman in a tense situation together, even with seemingly opposite personalities, are bound to turn to each other for the moment.
The actors of course were exactly right to breathe life into this situation.  And Robert Morley was also effective as Katherine Hepburn's brother missionary.  The realization that this was filmed on location, not on the studio's back lot, or in Griffith Park, enhanced the film.
I first saw it as a 14 year old and therefore, was impressed by the adventure and ready to got to the popcorn stand whenever it looked like it was going to go lovey-dovey.  More than 50 years later, I am still enthralled, but for altogether different reasons.
Rather than terming this a classic, because that word sounds stodgy to many, I would call this a timeless movie because of the basic human theme.  If asked to name my favorite movies, it may well fail to make the top 10, possibly not even the top 20, but it would definitely be in the top 50, and when you figure that I've probably seen between 50 and 100 movies a year for a number of years, top 50 isn't too shabby.",1022284800,2,1997,4.601694915254237

It is hard to imagine any one in the western world, especially in the United States, who has not seen the film at least once--and probably more than once. And so we take it for granted.
That is a mistake. Based on the famous C.S. Forester novel, which it follows quite closely, THE AFRICAN QUEEN is the simple story of pragmatic river-rat Charlie Allnut (Bogart) and high-minded Methodist missionary spinster Rose Sayer (Hepburn) who are thrown together by chance when German troups sweep through Africa during World War I. Once safely aboard his beat-up riverboat ""The African Queen,"" Allnut desires nothing more than to dodge the Germans until war's end; Rose, however, determines to strike a blow against the Germans by sailing the boat downriver to attack a German battleship.
There are so many fine things about this movie that they are hard to innumerate. Filmed on location in the Congo, the cinematography is remarkably fine without being obtrusive; the script, which is at once subtle and very purposeful, has a remarkably natural tone; the two stars--who play the vast majority of the film alone together--give justly famous performances; and Huston's direction is so fine that we never feel even the slightest hint of directorial manipulation. As an adventure, it has a sense of realism that most adventure stories lack; as a character study it is remarkably detailed and finely wrought; as a love story, it is quite touching without engaging in common sentimentality. And it can be enjoyed by many people of diverse backgrounds and ages without the faintest qualm.

337764,4,630150528X,"Directed by John Huston from C.S. Forester's novel and adapted to the screen by James Agee, this 1951 film stars Katherine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart. It is set 1914 in an unnamed country in East Africa.  Hepburn is an English spinster missionary whose brother dies as the result of a German raid. Bogart is a hard drinking Canadian riverboat captain who helps her get away on his 30-foot boat called ""The African Queen"".  Hepburn is all spunk and spitfire and convinces Bogart attack the German ship.  But before they do that that they have to travel the river and forced to overcome a variety of natural dangers.  Hepburn faces these dangers as an equal partner to Bogart and not as some retiring and timid female.  She steers the boat, dives underwater to make repairs, chops down tangled foliage with a machete and inspires Bogart with her courage. Naturally, they fall in love.
Now, fifty years later, I look at this film with fresh perspective, especially since I had never seen it before.  Bogart was 52 years old when it was made and was probably at the beginning of his illness.  He just didn't seem to have the physical strength that the role called for or the good looks that made him so popular in his day.  Perhaps it was the script, but some of his lines seemed awkward, and it surprised me that he won an academy award as Best Actor that year.  Hepburn, who was 45 at the time, fared better.  Her striking features, unique voice and personality added depth to her role.  Both characters had to go through changes during the course of the film and, as it was a two-character movie, there was no break in their constant on-screen performances.
Doing the special effects for this film had to be challenging.  Often, they didn't work for me.  Perhaps this was because so much of the film depended on showing Bogart and Hepburn grappling with the natural forces around them. I guess the director did his best with the techniques available at the time, but I must say I was distracted from the performances because much of the setting just didn't seem real.  I'm trying my best not to judge these special effects by contemporary standards, but I can't help it if I live in the year 2001.

Firstly, it was quite long...almost seven thousand two hundred seconds!  How do makers of such long movies  expect us not to get antsy and all fidgety?  I managed to keep myself busy  while watching by drinking coffee.  The second point I'd like to make about  this movie is that it is apparently set in some other country...and at some  other period of time.  I mean, can't we be a little more realistic if we're  going to go to all the trouble of making long movies that we have to drink  coffee while watching to keep from being fidgety?  Where was it set?  Africa...a country real far away full of people with much better tans than  us and some white people who keep either getting killed or seem to want to  kill each other.  How realistic is that?  I digress.  The story is this;  some guy with a steam-powered bass boat who delivers mail and supplies and  drinks too much and acts the same way in every movie he's in stops at a  mission (which is sort of a church summer camp in the middle of nowhere  where they try to convince the natives that worshipping sticks and mud is  bad unless it's in the shape of a cross) with some bad news for the church  folks within (Brother something or another and Sister Kenny, I think).  It  seems world war one has broken out.  Where do they get this stuff?  Well,  they politely invite him in for lunch, sit awkwardly exchanging  pleasantries while Mister All-nut farts and blames it on the dog.  He  leaves but returns later when he realizes he forgot his pager and finds the  mission in a shambles on account of the war going on.  Brother something or  another is dying and Sister Kenny decides to leave with All-nut on his  steam powered bass boat and for the rest of the movie they steam all over  Africa getting shot at and Mr. All-nut gets falling down drunk a lot  because Sister Kenny is so ugly and has PMS and is way to enfatuated with  god.  She dumps his hooch overboard and he falls in love with her.  Right.  Luckily the end is close by...they tow the bass boat through leech infested  water, make some home made torpedoes (it gets even better) then get married  on the enemy ship they later torpedo inadvertently!  Man, I must admit, I  couldn't have made a better version if I'd dug up the starring cast,  brought them back to life and filmed the entire thing in Africa with my  camcorder and got all the blank tapes and camcorder batteries I could use  for free.  I mean, it looks almost real and the special effects...wow!  And  Bogart looks almost life-like.",957312000,2,2636,4.453586497890296

Beautiful African locations are pure eye-candy and Bogart and Hepburn are a joy to watch. Also with some exciting adventure sequences, a beautiful script, and, as always, perfect direction by John Huston. This movie is worthy of repeated viewings and is one of the all-time greats. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 10!  END",953683200,9,454,5.135135135135135

A friend believes Hepburn was miscast because she wasn't beautiful enough, but she's a spinster who followed her missionary brother  to the deepest Africa, so you can't expect Elle McPherson, can you?  The  cast play their parts well and, apart from the wooden Germans at the end,  the whole movie is a joy to watch.",949622400,2,403,4.47945205479452

7812543,3,630150528X,"The Blue Ray quality was okay - just that the movie has lost a lot of attraction over the last almost 70 yrs. Was not quite as attention grabbing as say ""Return to Lonesome Dove"" . In its time it was a show stopper but unless you remember the good old days of actors such as those in this nostalgic flick, this review probably won't mean that much to you. Considering they never ate any food but drink tea during whole movie, most of it was barely believable. Not one of H.B.'s better roles but decent never the less. If you can find it on DVD for around $5 it's a good buy - but not so for $12, even on Blue Ray.",1525996800,,613,3.991869918699187
