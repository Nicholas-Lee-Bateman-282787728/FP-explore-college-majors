8229015,5,B000XPXMIO,"If you are a fan of this Tarkovsky influenced Russian director and his Silver Lion award winning film from the 2003 Venice Film Festival - The Return, then you should strive to check out this second film - The Banishment released in 2008 from Artificial Eye (U K region 2 DVD ). so what do we have here? possibly what can be described as a Return with vengeance and complete annihilation extremism. this is not for the timid, tame, or restless. this one unfurls with a quiet crush that will repave your perception of what an industrial Russian family drama can be. even an escape to some very remote, and awe struck countryside can't save this couple. there are moments of indescribable beauty and great cinematography thoroughout this killer movie.

I like my films to have guts, balls, the capacity to get and walk off on their own, kick dirt in your face, and you say ""that was awesome and beautiful"" in the same sentence. this one does in spades. the man of house chooses to travel further than the first open field, or next stand of trees. when he decides to settle perceived domestic matters he does so with with finality that will take your breath away. go figure where you will find a copy of this and half your battle is won. the rest is piece of mind enjoyment. so set down your personal, self-indulging digital technology and free your mind to travel where none of that stuff matters or even exists. this is a very wicked world even on the edges of pristine open plains and stands of crooked, green elms. toughest love possible.",1333065600,6,1539,4.555956678700361
8229016,5,B000XPXMIO,"You can debate if it is a good movie or not.  I thought it was.  However, I challenge you to find a movie that is as visually interesting as this one.  This movie is so beautiful and the camera work so perfect....any frame in this film could be a picture on your wall and you would not be disappointed.  Was ""The Return"" a better movie?  Probably, but not by much.  The Return was very beautiful as well, but The Banishment is more beautiful.  You will see interesting churches, countryside, people, houses, cars....it is all perfectly fascinating.",1299888000,,548,4.645833333333333
8229017,5,B000XPXMIO,"This is one of the most poignant and memorable movies I have recently seen. In fact, I keep returning to it over and over again. The story evokes introspection as it unfolds a  psychological drama  focused on the relationship between a husband and a wife whose failure to understand each other eventually results in a tragedy. The film develops slowly; and, every minute detail matters and is full of meaning. This calls for one's ability to reflect and contemplate as the film offers penetrating insights into human feelings and behavior. Konstantin Lavronenko's performance (Alex) is very emotional and deeply touching. He is one of those rare actors capable of making a profound emotional impact on the viewers. He and Aleksandr Baluyev (who plays Alex's brother) form an excellent team- making the movie truly unforgettable.
Zvyagintsev is sometimes criticized for having somewhat copied Tarkovsky. To some extent, this is correct. However, ""Izgnanie"" is such a powerful work that its impact and value are not in the least diminished by some similarities with Tarkovsky's approach.",1246752000,2,1085,5.265895953757226
8229018,4,B000XPXMIO,"I loved this film. Very quiet and very gorgeous, it functions like an x-ray of a marriage - personal revelations challenge the instincts of a Russian gangster, who we only see as both a husband and father. The film achieves this by throwing him out of his element, both geographically and psychologically, where his reactions to intimacy and family are revealed. The title works on several levels of meaning.

Andrei Zvyagintsev is not Tarkovsky, nor do I believe he is deliberately trying to be. Comparisons, may be inevitable, but are unhelpful beyond a certain point. Zvyagintsev is trying to tell a narrative story in a measured, meditative style, but he never loses sight of his desire to draw the audience into the story, through the characters' needs. Tarkovsky on the other hand, employed film as a medium for poetic expression, not narrative clarity. This was his genius. You engage a Tarkovsky film with different concerns than merely narrative form. An hour into ""Stalker"" or ""Nostalghia,"" the narrative gives way to something more elusive. Not so with Zvyagintsev whose aim is elsewhere; I believe he's very good at hitting his intended target.

""The Banishment"" is a delicate chorus of subtleties which all work to serve the idea within the conflict, one which is not immediately obvious. An action/reaction/Hollywood-style plot would likely saturate the audience's attention making it hard to hear the quiet heartbeat the story is addressing.

If there was any criticism that I would level at the filmmaker, it is that in this particular case he may be too aware of the Tarkovsky pedigree he is constantly lumped with - some shots seem to copy too closely the late filmmaker's stylistic particulars. Tarkovsky's voice was personal and specific, so it feels weird to see someone ""sampling"" him. But in the final reckoning, he could choose far worse filmmakers to emulate...

I highly recommend this film.",1245628800,3,1917,5.076190476190476
8229019,2,B000XPXMIO,"I wasn't that thrilled about ""The Return"", Zvyagintsev's first feature for a specific reason: people hailing him as ""the new Tarkovsky"", ""Tarkovsky successor""....etc
The Return wasn't a bad movie, in fact it was a decent work, especially as a first work of his. Now unlike the Return, Banishment isn't even a good movie. After a promising start, the movie succumbs into such mediocrity that even for everybody who hailed Zvyagintsev, they have to face the fact he had a major problem here.
There's a big responsibility in comparisons (though people tend to give it out of pure excitement sometimes), before Zvyagintsev Sokurov was regarded as the new Tarkovsky; but after watching some of his works, it's obvious that -though he has something to say- he's far from Tarkovsky's philosophical depth. Tarkovsky isn't only about landscapes, slow-panning cameras, smoke, and water.... (in fact if this is what it is for some, it means that they really don't get him, and Tarkovsky demands more than visual appreciations).
Zvyagintsev's Banishment doesn't really go beyond appearances. And having said that I wanted to use another word but I can't: PRETENTIOUS!!
It's not bad to be influenced by such master at all, but empty reproduction ends up harming more than helping. His camera ends up panning aimlessly and missing -clearly- the depth and grandeur of masters that used this technique before.
Another clear feature was his use of christian metaphors (blood washing, Churches, Leonardo's painting....), but again it wasn't convincing at all. It seemed that Zvyagintsev has all this in his baggage and just wanted to throw here and there.
Plot wise (I won't give spoilers, and I don't like reviews that recite the narrative plot stupidly just because it's part of the review) Zvyagintsev tries to go under the surface, to squeeze emotions, to build characters...and if he doesn't really fail, he doesn't do great also, and the already very artificial and distant drama features major flaws and unjustified missing elements.
The sound track is also inspired from orthodox Christian chants, but naively gives away a lot of the drama since it only culminates in a cresendo mode right before a twist or an incident. For me this isn't the role of a soundtrack (except in Hollywood of course), a soundtrack (if present) should add a different layer to the work instead of forcing attention.
As a summation, in spite of some VERY RARE fine moments and one or two clever camera tricks (especially by the end of the movie) it's just an overtly polished movie.

I'm always very open minded towards new emerging directors, new hopes in the current desert of mediocrity. Zvyagintsev's the Return was a nice minimalistic work, but the Banishment fails on many levels.
It would be wise for everybody to stop throwing comparisons and titles, and keep Tarkovsky where he belongs (with masters like Bergman, Antonioni, Dreyer, Bresson..) thus leaving these new directors free from such frames hoping for them to achieve their own identities.

And regarding Zvyagintsev, only time and more works will tell us if Banishment was a misfire, or The Return was a beginner's luck.",1218412800,3,3155,5.077071290944123
