8464897,5,B005C7FWZE,"For anyone looking beyond the big three of Soviet Cinema (Dovzhenko, Pudovkin, Eisenstein), this set is a gold mine of cinematic creativity. You get the opportunity to view documentaries (THE FALL OF THE ROMANOV DYNASTY, TURKSIB, SALT FOR SVANETIA), comedies (THE EXTRAORDINARY ADVENTURES OF MR WEST IN THE LAND OF THE BOLSHEVIKS, THE HOUSE ON TRUBNAYA), and an unexpected drama (BY THE LAW) based on a short story by Jack London. One of the big three does make an appearance here. Sergei Eisenstein's last silent film OLD AND NEW (originally THE GENERAL LINE) extols the virtues of collective farming through the classic manipulation of his montage editing. Editing also plays an important part in Dziga Vertov's STRIDE SOVIET! which did not please the powers that be at the time with its creative inventiveness just like his highly charged documentary LIVING RUSSIA OR THE MAN WITH A MOVIE CAMERA.

The quality of the images in this set is a marked improvement over the old VHS versions although one reviewer complained about the framing of BY THE LAW. While it does look cropped compared to the other movies (possibly soundtrack issues), I had no problem with it as I haven't seen the Region 2 version. It does illustrate the issue of different versions of silent movies being made available for home video. The Eisenstein and Vertov offerings are what you expect when you think of 1920s Soviet cinema but the comedies are completely unexpected. What they lack in sublety is made up for by their visual creativity. All of these films come with brand new scores and there's even a little booklet to help explain Soviet montage. First class all the way. Thanks again to David Shepard and Flicker Alley for making these available. An invaluable set for anyone interestd in editing techniques and how thwy can influence a film.",1319846400,10,1826,4.928571428571429
8464898,3,B005C7FWZE,"This is a good set, but ... though it pains me to criticize Flicker Alley, and always taking into account the possibility that my copy might be in some way flawed or defective (please do correct me if I'm wrong!), the version of BY THE LAW that is included in this box is so mutilated as to be unwatchable. I'm not talking about the natural damage prints of this film will necessarily have suffered, nor about a poor restoration or transfer or any of the other, expected flaws to be found on a DVD of early film. BY THE LAW is cropped here to be missing what looks like nearly a quarter of the frame on the left, and if I'm not mistaken a little on the right as well--MR. WEST, by contrast, looks fine. When there is a stunningly beautiful DVD of BY THE LAW available from Edition Filmmuseum (region 2), which contains not only the full, uncropped frame but at a far better resolution and with deeper blacks and better detail, I can't understand why so poor a version of this essential film should have been included in an otherwise praiseworthy collection. Perhaps the German print used for the Region 2 disc was unavailable to Flicker Alley, or was too expensive to license or convert--or who knows. There are manifold difficulties and compromises in any publishing venture, particularly in the home-video world. In this case, however, omitting BY THE LAW would have been the better decision. So: beware.",1319241600,25,1406,4.628
8464899,5,B005C7FWZE,"Back in film school, we watched almost all of these works in history and theory and documentary classes.  If you're looking for the primary building blocks of film grammar, this set is an invaluable tool.  That's not to say that these films are dry exercises in the theory of montage and nothing else: they're still enchanting and fresh and entertaining after nearly 90 years.

""The foundation of film art is editing."" --Pudovkin.  While Eisenstein is the best known early theorist of montage, each of the filmmakers represented here had his (or her) own notions of how to render action and character and space and emotion through editing.  With a scissors and a pastepot and nothing else-- no Moviola, no AVID-- these storytellers edited these masterworks.  All are worthy of study, but I think my two favorites stand out.

Lev Kuleshov's ""By The Law"" is a compelling interpretation of a Jack London story about a troupe of gold miners and their descent into madness.  At the ends of the earth, they make their own law.  When I saw ""There Will Be Blood"" a few years ago, parts of it reminded me of this film.

Sergei Eisenstein's ""Old & New"" (known when I first saw it as ""The General Line"") is a paean to the collectivization and mechanization of farming.  Sound sexy?  No?  Well, when thick-ankled farm girl Marfa Lapkina fantasizes about tractors and milking machines, you'll get hot under the collar.  The milking machine dream is almost a parody of an orgasmic release-- must be seen to be believed.  Oh Marfa, where are you now??

Interested in film history and good storytelling?  This collection is essential.",1316822400,12,1618,4.825454545454545
