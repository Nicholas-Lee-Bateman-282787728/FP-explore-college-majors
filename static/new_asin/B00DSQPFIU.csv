5853719,1,B00DSQPFIU,"There is plenty of awful in Zombie Hunter, but nothing is quite as annoying as the film's cover art. With Danny Trejo's picture in full focus and his name over the title, you would naturally assume Trejo to be the title character, but is instead just a passing bloodstain in this unintentionally humorous horror action film. Any film clinging to the celebrity of one of the bit players in order to be more marketable worries me. Zombie Hunter is 93 minutes of cheesy acting, effects and one-liners. Aside from the handful of shots with Trejo alone or shot from below to make the actor look taller than he actually is, Zombie Hunter focuses on the base elements of B-filmmaking, including a heavy dose of breast-flaunting women.

  Though this is yet another end-of-the-world zombie movie, it shares more in common with the Resident Evil franchise than anything else, complete with inexplicable morphed zombie creatures. Our title character is a gravelly-voiced narrator with something of a Road Warrior complex, mowing down zombies as he travels a solitary path. When he comes across a group of survivors, they band together to fight the zombies and whatever other elements of danger there are. This includes a man dressed as a clown who enjoys killing anything that crosses his path, zombie or human.

  Imagine ""The Walking Dead"" without any of the smart storylines, good special effects or characters you care about, and you would still have a zombie tale that is ten times more engaging than this film. More than anything, Zombie Hunter feels as though it wants to be a Robert Rodriguez movie, if only for the mere fact that Trejo has a few scenes to do what he has done moderately well for at least a decade.

5853720,3,B00DSQPFIU,"The story centers around ""The Hunter"" (Martin Copping) a man who has survived the zombie outbreak. The outbreak was caused by use of a new and popular recreational drug of unknown origin. The Hunter eventually ends up with a small group of survivors which include Father Jesus (Danny Trejo) and two women who vie for the attention of the new guy. Their goal is to fly to the proverbial safe island off the coast of California. The dialogue seemed fairly decent except for some unnecessary first person narration, which appears to have become too much of the norm since the success of ""Zombieland.""

Part of the film is shot as a grainy grindhouse, which worked well, but its use was haphazard and ended quickly. The music was grindhouse metal and the blood splatters on the camera lens. Fast Lane Debbie(Jade Regier) who is a better pole dancer than nurse, teases us with her overt sexuality. There was a WTF CG creature, apparently a new unquestionable plot must since a ""Residence Evil"" sequel did it.

The film had some good scenes and oozed with potential. If you are going to do a grindhouse film, you must go all the way to appeal to a grindhouse audience. This is a watered down film. Okay as a rental.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs that I recall. No nudity. Sex scene inspired by Natile Portman (keeps bra on)...seriously? In a Trejo grindhouse?",1380931200,4,1351,4.69198312236287
5853721,4,B00DSQPFIU,"""Zombie Hunter"" is an absolutely ridiculous film. That's not meant to be a putdown in this case. If it were anything but ridiculous, it just wouldn't work. It's what makes the movie watchable and gives it such an entertaining air.

After a zombie apocalypse, a loner (Martin Copping) with nothing left to lose drives cross-country taking out the walking dead whenever he crosses paths with them. After a car crash, he's brought to a remote refuge of survivors. He soon finds himself leading the misfits as they flee for their lives when the flesh-eaters discover their hideaway.

What could have easily been lost in a never-ending sea of movies centered on the walking dead rises above thanks to an obvious influence taken from Japanese films like ""Mutant Girl Squad,"" ""Helldriver,"" and ""Vampire Girl vs. Frankenstein Girl."" All the hyper-tense action sequences, vivid colors, and ultra-violence found in those are mimicked here to mostly successful results.

If what you're looking for is the realism of ""Night of the Living Dead"" or ""The Walking Dead,"" don't gaze in the direction of ""Zombie Hunters."" There's tons of gore and beheadings, but everything's done in an extremely animated and tongue-in-cheek manner. Instead of the dark crimson colors audiences expect when zombies are butchered and bludgeoned, blood flows in ultraviolet hues of pink and purple here. Just like the Japanese films this movie is influenced by, the brightly colored blood splatters across the screen as the zombies are sliced and diced.

The special effects for ""Zombie Hunters"" are also intentionally cartoon-like. Somehow they fit in with the absurdity of the rest of the movie. You can tell filmmakers deliberately used certain CGI and practical effects which transition in appearance from fake to realistic. It's evident because the quality shifts from scene to scene.

For instance, the film will go from a scene of zombie monsters which look like Ray Harryhausen models to a sequence of a person getting a chainsaw drilled through their stomach with lifelike blood pouring forth. The next scene features a zombie getting his head cut off as purple day-glo gore sprays out of it all over the camera lens.

Although ""Zombie Hunter"" is not yet rated by the MPAA, I would consider it to be an ""R."" There's no nudity, but plenty of sensuality. As an example, one of the woman survivors performs an unnecessary pole-dancing routine. There's a ton of gore and violence, even though most of it does come across as rather cartoonish. Plenty of bad language is uttered as well.

""Zombie Hunter"" is presented in 16:9 widescreen with 5.1 HD surround sound. The picture quality brings out all the vibrant colors of the gore spewing forth onto the camera lens. The audio engulfs the viewer in gunshots, the moans of zombies, and other apocalyptic noises.

If you're a fan of the excessively gory and irreverently silly films of Yoshihiro Nishimura, then you'll no doubt enjoy ""Zombie Hunter."" Just don't watch the movie expecting Academy Award-winning performances or the serious atmosphere of George A. Romero or Robert Kirkman's post-apocalyptic worlds. While nowhere near as good as the Japanese films it attempts to imitate, I have to give director Kevin King at least a B for effort.",1380326400,5,3534,5.058419243986254
5853722,1,B00DSQPFIU,"""Most of them are brainless globs of walking matter with one objective, eat, but every once in a while you'll get one thats a little tricky."" After the apocalypse there are two kinds of beings left...Zombies and humans. One man known as the hunter (Copping) who has nothing to lose drives around killing any flesh eater he can find. When he finds a small group of survivors he decides to help them out. When a group attacks them the hunter must now put his skills to the test. There isn't much I can say about this movie that will make you want to watch it. Danny Trejo is in it but only for about 10 minutes. The way I think the movie got made is this; Hey everyone likes zombies, should we make a movie about them. We only have $50 though who will be in it for that? I know Danny Trejo, he does anything and has a huge cult following...we can't lose. Much like Bruce Campbell in the 90's people will watch a movie based on if he is in it or not, no matter what the movie is. That's what the makers are hoping for. To prove my point...there is a scene where the group talks about how many zombies the hunter has killed that is interrupted by a woman stripping...using a pole that is conveniently located in the warehouse they are in, but since Danny Trejo is on the box people will watch. Overall, exactly what you would expect. I give it a D+",1380240000,3,1344,4.213178294573644

5853725,1,B00DSQPFIU,"Zombie Hunter (2013)

 Once again the exception proves the rule.  I have developed a theory that zombie flicks made in this century are superior to those made in the last century.  Somebody slapped Zombie Hunter together in 2013, well into this century, and it wasted my time-which of course is what I am for.  I waste my time so that you do not have to waste yours.
 This might have been a decent flick.  It has a good story.  After a recreational drug makes the scene, people turn into flesh eating Zombies.  These are traditional slow Zombies, which I always like.  Slow movers give the cast some chance of escape.  The hero, a guy named Hunter ( Zombie Hunter get it?  The place where the cannibals live is called Dahmer.  Get that?)  who went out partying with his pals only to return home the next morning to find that his wife and little daughter have been gruesomely devoured.  This gives him a certain reckless devotion to Zombie slaying that we find attractive in a Zombie flick hero.  He finds a small band of survivors in the wastes of Utah.  All good.
 We also have for our enjoyment Danny Trejo, a guy who has been the star of two major Hollywood films, Machete and Machete 2. He has a supporting role as Father Jesus, a Zombie killer of great skill.  He uses an ax.  Still all good.  The actual star is a guy named Martin Copping.  He has nearly 60 credits as an actor.  Clare Niederpruem, the female lead, also has professional credits to brag about.  Still good.
 Jade Reiger plays the supporting actress but she couldn't act her way out of a paper bag if you hit it with a fire hose.  She plays a character who acts like a stripper.  In real life Reiger is a well practiced Playboy photo model who now lives in Utah and teaches.... wait for it..... pole dancing.  The rest of the cast also can't act or at least didn't in this one.  Even Copping looks like he is bored by the whole thing and seems to amuse himself by channeling early Jack Nicholson riffs.  It is almost like two movies meshed into one with the troubled, tough survivor, Hunter, and the other with a bunch of people walking around and saying stuff.
 The sound does not reach theatrical standards and the effects, including the computer aided stuff, lacks any pretense at realism.  The Zombies are however, perfectly OK.
 I get it that the director didn't have much money.  The filming reportedly had a life saving transfusion of the inconsequential sum of $46,000 which allowed them to finish the film.  But walking through a scene with the cameras off a few times costs next to nothing and often improves the result.
 The script, in spite of a good story line, makes little sense.  We have an interlude straight out of Texas Chainsaw Massacre  which didn't help much.  We have a guy who has four sickle sized claws rip him through the torso calmly lighting a cigarette afterward.
 And worst of all from my point of view, we have people who have survived for a year after the Zombie outbreak utterly clueless about things like having close quarter weapons with them at all times and simple personal security protocols.  They act like the confused victims in a standard horror flick that don't last the first night.  Phoooy.
 Writer, director, producer Kevin King did his best I am sure and I hope he got his money back as the producer.  But you don't have to watch it.  Danny Trejo or not, this one gets a tiny one brain.
 Not rated but should be rated R for gore, bad words and adult situations.  One hour and 33 minutes that I will never get back.",1416960000,,3534,4.475667189952905

5853732,4,B00DSQPFIU,"First- as some others have mentioned- the cover is misleading. Trejo's in this, but not as a main character as expected. A disappointment, but he rocks the part he has anyway (of course!). I am quite certain that it's frowned upon for priests to use some of the language he uses freely in both English and Spanish!

I appreciated that this movie didn't try to be anything that it's not. It not only includes but actually unabashedly embraces many bad horror movie clichs. I mean over-the-top-has-to-be-done-on-purpose, the type that it seems unlikely anyone 'accidentally' formulated. So knowing that, anyone considering this movie should already have a good feeling as to if they'll enjoy it or not. Love cheesy bad horrors? Check this one out. Hate them? Don't waste your time here.

I knew I loved this movie about 3 minutes in. One of the best opening scenes I've enjoyed in a while in any horror movie, be it top-notch or high on the cheese factor. Fabulous, with some humor thrown in.

The acting's bad, really bad. Even the lead male voice over for his inner thoughts sounds like a poor man's Clint Eastwood, trying to be all manly and gruff, and just coming off, well...over done. The female actresses are equally as bad, but since there's a scene where a stripper pole just *happens* to be in the right place at the right time (read: in a place it has no business being, isn't that lucky for the guys?), we'll have to let it slide, I suppose. Seriously, the 'bad' girl's acting in particular is just hilarious, as are her attempts to catch the eye of the main man (to be fair, it's not like her part was ever going to be up for an Oscar no matter how well acted). But what can one expect from a character called 'Fast Lane' Debbie?

The rest of the characters are equally caricature- like and squarely in place to feed their stereotype- from the overly horny teenage little brother to the fat redneck to the stripper to the bad-guy-who's-actually-good-with-a-checkered past. No one is safe from the stereotype checklist here!

While there's no nudity, there's heavy emphasis on sex in this one, so if you tend to travel in the prudish lane, you'll probably be offended. There's a few 'Are you retarded?""s in here as well, which I could have done without.

The special effects are okay, just okay. There's some Resident Evil-esque bits that instead of impressing me just reminded me to see if any more of that line is coming out anytime soon. There's minor details amok in here at points, like bloody shirt-clean shirt-bloody shirt all in one scene.

You'll find a plethora of ridiculously bad one liners in here: 'Nothing puts a smile on my face like a mid-day massacre'
""'Nobody laughs at Allison-nobody!"" (spoken by Allison) ""I got a real short fuse when it comes to inbreds"" ""He was like a damn Ninja Turtle."" I'd like some chips with my cheese, please.

For a small bit, this turns into a sort of slasher film, which I could have lived without. Be zombies or be slasher, and never the two shall meet, in my book. The first half of the film was better than the second, but all in all, a very enjoyable watch IF you accept that this is what it is- a horribly clichd, cheesy horror flick.",1400112000,,3198,4.598245614035088

Yes, the acting was over the top, and the special effects were not particularly good with obvious animation. It was kind of like the cast of Gilligan's island with a distinctly Ginger character and a Mary Ann figure and with zombies, monsters, and of course the magnificent Mr. Trejo who played ""Father Jesus"" (for us gringos out there, that is pronounced ""Hay-soose.""). He played his part straight and well! I never get tired of that gravelly voice! I got a kick out of the town of Dahmer, and the movie also reminded me of Mad Max at Thunderdome.  I enjoyed the third party narration, like someone was trying to tip us off whether to be scared or to go ahead and laugh.  However, my favorite scenes involved the magnificent Mr. Trejo laying waste literally hundreds of zombies with an axe--without a shirt in sight too bad his part was so short.  Thank you JESUS, (or ""Hay-soose"" as the case may be"") for those shirtless scenes.  I wonder if Mr. Trejo's scowl muscles get tired?",1398211200,,1137,4.5268292682926825

5853739,1,B00DSQPFIU,"Zombie Hunter (K. King, 2013)

It is an extremely rare thing indeed for me to abandon a movie. I have watched somewhere north of four thousand films according to my spreadsheet, which is only 100% accurate past 2007, maybe 90% past 1999, and spotty before that, so the number is probably close to, if not over, five thousand (this is distinct titles, it doesn't count, say, the over one hundred times I have seen Before Night Falls, Begotten, or Scanners, for example). In all my movie-watching career, I have abandoned, with the definition of abandoned here being turned off before it was over with no intention of ever going back and watching the rest of it, less than two dozen. As far as I can remember, the most recent file to receive that treatment was Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter, which I watched (forty-five minutes of, anyway) in 2003. Ten and a half years later, the execrable Zombie Hunter has been added to the list.

It took me about thirty seconds to know this movie was going to get on my nerves. Martin Copping's horrible, overblown, faux-tough-guy narration style is impossible to listen to. Maybe there's less voiceover action past the thirty-four minute mark, but I will never find out. Perhaps this is the rare horror movie these days where Danny Trejo gets more than five minutes of screen time. Will never find that out either. Even the romance subplot was painfully ridiculous, setting up the nice girl against the slut, and I surely don't need to watch the rest of the movie to know how that one's going to turn out.  The rest of the characters are about as shallow as those. That Zombie Hunter appeared on the worst of 2013 list of one Dread Central staffer is far less surprising than the fact that Zombie Hunter did not appear on the worst of 2013 lists of every Dread Central staffer; I can only assume the rest of them didn't see it.

He says the phrase ""stone cold silence"" each time he is in a new location.  The narration itself is pointless, it does not provide the viewer with any new or interesting information.  Why is the lead actor wearing a leather jacket?  The actor is wearing a leather jacket when everyone else around him is wearing shorty shorts...and the lead actor isn't a bit toasty? The blood splatter in this movie is various colors...purple, pink.....its just unnatural.  I remember a video game doing that so it would be more kid friendly but why make the blood multicolored and still show a zombie pulling out entrails?  If you are thinking of watching this movie because Danny Trejo is in it, I would suggest you not bother.  He has a small part as a priest who governs a small group of people.  His part is less than 15 minutes long.  The fight sequence he has in the movie is over too quickly to be enjoyable.  Also, there is no explanation of the ""mutant""?  It just shows up?  The writer must be fond of Resident Evil or Silent HIll games because the ""mutant"" creature looks like something from one of those games.  Just odd to throw a creature that isn't zombielike in a zombie movie after showing the viewer only zombies.  I guess the writer was trying to spice things up for the viewer.  The writer of this movie is clearly very fond of clichs and lame dialogue.  When the girl in town asks the lead actor what his name is...he replies, ""I don't have one.""  Really?  Why?  So he can remain mysterious?  Then he has sex with her...hum. The movie does have a sex scene in it but it is more funny than anything.  The viewer gets to see bouncing feet for the most part.  What I couldn't figure out is how he got his pants off without taking off his combat boots.  But when he moves you are able to see a small part of black jean rolled up.

5853755,2,B00DSQPFIU,"This gets two stars for Trejo - otherwise it would get only one. As others have said, it's not the worst movie ever made, but it falls far short of its goals. The ""intro"" (how the apocalypse started) could have easily been left out. There's a few funny lines, and the ""freezer scene"" gave a chuckle, but the blatant continuity errors were as annoying as a slap in the back of the head. I don't know if they were there for comedic interlude, or just really poor attention to details. The ones that jolted me: car windshield cracking, then magically ""healed"" in the next scene; character shot in the chest, then a couple scenes later it was just a minor arm wound. Shirts that get covered with blood are then sparkly clean for a couple of scenes, then blood-soaked again (no killing happened in interim); a direct chainsaw hit (complete with cgi blood spray) that evidently didn't happen, as the character is fine a moment later; and many others. Speaking of details, someone in the production crew is either color-blind, or had no idea how items would look on ""film"". Pink blood? Bourbon whiskey the color of urine? Cover art barely related to content (that axe never appeared, and Danny Trejo had barely 10 minutes of screen time). Add in ""entrails"" that must have been made of leather (or the zombies were toothless; all they seemed to do was gum the guts!) and some bad cgi, and there you have it.

I guess ""disappointed"" pretty well sums it up. If you're a fan of bad zombie movies, or like to have a few friends over, have drinks and get silly making like MST2K, it's worth checking out on NetFlix - otherwise, pass on this one.",1383177600,,1632,4.532203389830508
5853756,3,B00DSQPFIU,"If a movie boasts Danny Trejo on its cover, chances are I'll give it a look.  I've been a fan of the guy for a long time, going way back to 1995 when I first saw him in Robert Rodriguez's DESPERADO.  Since then, he's been in some of my favorite movies.  His latest release, ZOMBIE HUNTER, is not an excellent film, but it is entertaining and definitely worth watching.

This movie is a lot of fun, but you can't go into it expecting a completely serious film.  If you do, you will be disappointed.  Instead, just take this one for what it is:  a tongue-in-cheek zombie flick with loads of gore and cheesy dialogue.

ZOMBIE HUNTER is done well and looks good onscreen, although it does have some flaws here and there.  I noticed a couple of continuity errors (for example, in one scene the main character is holding a knife; the shot cuts away and he does not have it in his hand anymore), but nothing that shoots down the credibility of the film as a whole.  Just about every film has something wrong with it, so please do not take this as a reason not to watch.

The plot is interesting and moves at a nice pace, and the characters are a motley bunch that will make you smile.  But there are two glaring issues with the film that kept bugging me.  First is the gore.  There's plenty of it, and that's a good thing...but almost all of it is computer generated.  This isn't necessarily a terrible thing, but you can definitely tell the difference between CG and practical effects...and practical looks so much better and believable.

The second issue I have with ZOMBIE HUNTER is that **spoiler alert** the hulking mutant creatures are never explained or even speculated about.  They look like something straight from RESIDENT EVIL, which is forgivable, but they were added into the film as almost an afterthought.  A bit of explanation or even a theory or two by the characters would have been nice.

Still, ZOMBIE HUNTER is a fun jaunt into zombie territory and definitely worth a look.  It's always good to see Danny Trejo onscreen, even if his role is more of a cameo than anything.  This film is available now in a variety of formats.",1382400000,,2138,4.501298701298701
5853757,1,B00DSQPFIU,"Just no way to excuse the poor quality. Trejo has proved himself to be worthy of better roles. I remember the first time I saw him, in Steven Seagal's 1990 MARKED FOR DEATH opening scene. He has a face only a blind mother could love.

Oddly, IMDB.com shows his first role was in 1983. He appeared in Jackie Chan's PROJECT A. That movie is highly regarded as the vehicle that put Chan on the international movie star A list. I think this is in error because the PROJECT A casting list does not include his name.

But back to this --even a hardcore zombie movie fan like me has to admit this is as cheap as you can get in that there is nothing new and outstanding. When the alternate title for your project is easily ""RUN OF THE MILL""  then it is time to put it aside until inspiration strikes and you have something to show the audience that keeps them from being bored to tears.",1382054400,,878,4.245508982035928

5853759,1,B00DSQPFIU,"I'm still trying to figure out what the reason for one ""character"" was. IF that's what you would call it. The beginning was boring and frankly didn't make much sense. When the ""main character"", who is NOT Danny Trejo (the sole reason I bought it to begin with), enters it gives you a hope that it will actually not be that bad. He was the only good part, until the end. That was just stupid. I would NOT buy this. I was disappointed and will definitely let reviews guide me next time. Pass on this one. Trejo's part was so small and minor it wasn't worth buying this. He's a great actor and I wish he had been more of a focus.",1381968000,,626,4.139344262295082

It was violent, gross, action packed, and even had a stripper!  Danny Trejo was cool.  Our hero/anti hero is ""Hunter"", a 30 year old adult who doesn't talk much in the acting segments, but will not shut up in his narration.  He talks with a more husky voice than his voice really allows--to me that is funny because it is like a 20 year old man with a duck dynasty beard that makes him look like an 18 year old Amish teen! Kevin Black directed this and wrote this and is in most of the credits over and over, giving me the idea that he must have had something to do with this film.  These zombies are not dead.  They might as well be.  They are the result of a new drug.  The CG monsters are pretty bada**.  Enjoy!  Greg",1381449600,,861,4.089820359281437

Zombie Hunter is one of those movies that is best viewed with the brain turned off. Something like a SyFy channel flick it is best to not take it seriously. Of course for most people it is the appeal of yet another zombie flick while others will see it for Danny Trejo. Well luckily if you go in like I have said chances are you will enjoy this movie. I watched this flick with my brother and we ended liking it a bit more than at least he thought we would. The only really bad thing is that the DVD comes with no special features, would have loved some behind the scenes stuff and an audio commentary.

After a drug turns most of the worlds population into zombies one man is out to hunt them since he is called Hunter. He comes across a group of survivors who are lead by a preacher [Trejo] who himself is not afraid to get a little dirty. But with so many out there and even some larger creatures who like something out of a Resident Evil game make their way towards them as well.

The movie is actually a pretty fun one with some cool kills plus zombies of course. Sure it isn't the biggest budgeted film but it looks good for what it is. The effects suffer some but that has never really bothered me but it might some else who may read this so it had to be mentioned. Also I loved the soundtrack; one of the songs in particular has become a favorite of mine. Writers Kurt Knight and K. King who also directed made an entertaining little flick thanks in part to fans on Kickstarter. I say check it out, it may be for you.",1423526400,,1540,4.1610738255033555
