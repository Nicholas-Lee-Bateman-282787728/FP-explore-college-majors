8077272,4,B000AARKB2,"Hard to top Annie Van Auken's review here, so I won't even try.

Excellent nostalgia horror viewing collection -- my mother wouldn't let me watch these when I was a child because she was sure that I'd have nightmares (that was my brother), and they'd stunt my growth, or something.  So of course I watch them now, and have even fallen asleep on the sofa watching these ( my insomnia thanks them).

I doubt jaded younger viewers would bat an eyelash at these today, but they do have their charms, imo -- but then, Turner Classic Movie channel is one of the top 5 watched in my household.  If you are looking for slasher films with pounding 'music', these aren't for you.",1453939200,,669,4.459016393442623

Their 15 film HORROR COLLECTION is typical public domain stuff. All have been in wide circulation for decades, yet several here are considered classics of the genre. My favorite: Roger Corman's BUCKET OF BLOOD, the tongue-in-cheek story of a beatnik club nobody whose lifelike statues make him a celebrity. What his fans don't know however is the artist's ""works"" were once alive! As good as ""Bucket"" is, Corman's THE TERROR is just as dreadful. Shot by at least two directors, it's a disjointed mess that features a young Nicholson and elderly Karloff.

SCARED TO DEATH has a minor role for little Angelo Rossitto, aka the top half of ""Master Blaster"" in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MAD-MAX-BEYOND-THUNDERDOME/dp/0790731932/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MAD MAX BEYOND THUNDERDOME</a>&nbsp;(1985). Perhaps all fright film aficionados are familiar with NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and CARNIVAL OF SOULS, classics that are more popular today than they were 45 or 50 years ago. Both were feature film debut masterpieces for directors George Romero (""Living Dead"") and Herk Hervey (""Carnival""). In Herk's case, this was his ONLY full length picture; quite an achievement for an industrial short film maker.

You can call DISC THREE a Vincent Price Festival. All are excellent, especially THE LAST MAN ON EARTH, a spaghetti frighter shot in Rome. SHOCK! has its tense moments but is more film noir than horror. HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL is by legendary 'B' movie producer/writer/director/promoter William Castle. Arguably his best work, it's the story of a group of folks who are each promised a tidy cash payment if they can survive the night in their host's creepy mansion.

After Francis Coppola did some uncredited second unit directing on Corman's ""Terror,"" he was rewarded with his own project. The result was less than sterling. DEMENTIA 13 is an ax murder frighter scripted by Coppola. Way down on the cast list of THE BAT is former Little Rascals cutie Darla Hood. Based on the 1920 Broadway stage production, this one's ""When it flies, someone dies!"" tag doesn't bode well for Alfalfa's former girlfriend.
