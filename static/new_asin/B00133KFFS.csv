8249133,1,B00133KFFS,"P. O. G. Piece of garbage.  This is junk.  Horror for the peanut butter eaters. To make this available to little kids is a travesty. I would have given it ZERO stars, but then my review would not be published. Do your kids a favor, and pass over this. Blech!  Unless, of course, you enjoy having your kids beg to get in bed with you at 3 AM.  You could put a lock on the door, though, and feel cool that you are so enlightened that you let your kids watch crap.",1265587200,,461,3.9782608695652173
