7753361,4,B01G1RCLLG,"Daryl Graham (Lamman Rucker) has just moved into Queens apartment 3B. There is a lot of gossip on the steps by the ladies who live there. Daryl is refined, educated and a former ""respected"" gang member. He tries to be a friend to everyone, calmly resolving problems. The issues range from infidelity, drug use, divorce, gay, and did I mention a manipulative ex-girlfriend? Oh yea. A gangster.

The characters were nearly all likeable, even the antagonists. The twist raises some questions,  try not to think too deep about forensics, or other plot points. Easy film to watch.

THERE WAS TOO MANY SCENES IN ONE MINUTE..
LOVED THE ACTORS.",1490659200,,97,4.764705882352941
7753375,5,B01G1RCLLG,"I loved this movie. It kept me entertained the whole time. There were lots of interesting characters who kept me guessing - nothing was what it seemed. I thought all of the actors were excellent, very believable, and the lead male actor perfectly plays the  part of the handsome, mysterious stranger whose presence  changes the dynamic of an entire building. As a side note, this movie is revolutionary, although you probably won't think of the reason while you're watching. Why is it revolutionary? Because the lead heroine and romantic female interest (sex scenes and all) is overweight- the movie shows jealous men fighting over her and her true lover finds her irresistibly sexy, unable to stop himself from ogling her, stealing a kiss from her in the hallway  and diving in when she tells him she wants him too.  She's also a great actress so I wasn't thinking about her weight while watching. Afterwards, I was reading an article stating that is an author or director truly wants to be revolutionary, that person should create a mainstream, fat, female romantic lead. It struck me then that this has already happened, and in such a natural way. Her character is also caring and feminine, yet able to show strength when she needs to take control of her life. I'm going to be stereotypical now and say that only the black community allows this type of female character- 'white' movies always overload fat female characters who get the guy with self-deprecating, over-the-top humor, as if the movie feels embarrassed about presenting an alternative type of sexiness.",1488844800,,1569,4.931818181818182

7753382,1,B01G1RCLLG,"The movie was not at all what I expected. The characters were a cross between 227 when the neighbors sat on the stoop minding everyone's business and the stereotypical  cast of black characters. Drug dealers,gang members,loose and gossiping women, black men  who are angry with the system. I would not recommend this movie.",1485216000,,323,5.0754716981132075

7753400,2,B01G1RCLLG,I am a big fan of Carl Weber's books and I personally own the man in 3B. I'm sorry but the movie just didn't truly capture what he wrote. The bypassed a lot of details. I feel like a movie shouldn't be made after a book if you aren't going to do the book justice. I'm fairly disappointed in the movie. I rather ready the book and picture what's going on in my mind than watch this movie. Some of the actors picked for the characters were wrong. They just didn't bring the passion and emotion I was looking for to the character. The book is much better.,1478908800,,552,4.12037037037037
