This one, a search for a Japanese sub loaded with gold , morphine, tin, and possibly dirty bomb materials was especially interesting to me. I could not find it available on dvd so the vhs will have do. prodution quality is very good. JB Nance",1293235200,,293,4.653846153846154
7923141,5,B00004TX2K,I would have to say this is one of the most interesting lesser known tales from the World War Two.  the trajic end of this Japanese Sub and it's journery to rediscover it's last days is truley riveting. Great computer animation reconstruction of events!!,997920000,4,254,4.7727272727272725
