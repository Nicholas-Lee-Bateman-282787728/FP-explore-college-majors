2326832,4,B0009WFFXG,"Home of the Brave is an excellent documentary about Civil Rights activist Viola Liuzzo. Liuzzo was a Detroit housewife who was murdered by the Ku Klux Klan after the famous Selma-to-Montgomery march in 1965. As the film notes, people have largely forgotten Viola; that is unfortunate because her story teaches us many lessons about democracy.

I was familiar with the basic outlines of Liuzzo's story, so I did not learn a lot about her involvement in the Civil Rights movement. The interviews with Liuzzo's children are the most-fascinating aspect of Home of the Brave. It is easy to see that most them are still struggling to come to grips with their mother's murder. One son, Tony, has become a leader in the Michigan Militia and expresses intense paranoia. Daughter Mary takes an emotional trip to Selma to visit the site of her mother's murder. Another son, Tommy, has moved to Alabama, changed his last name, and has had no contact with his siblings for over 20 years.

My only complaint about Home of the Brave is that I wished the film had more depth in places. I would have liked more background on Viola; her motivations for going to Selma are still a bit mysterious. The story of the State of Alabama's attempts to prosecute the Klansman for her murder is grossly oversimplified. In the end, a 75-minute film may simply not be long enough to tell Viola's story.

As someone who has spent most of his life in Alabama, I found the film particularly moving. It is difficult to believe that segregation was one of the pillars our society until recently; Home of the Brave helps explain why the South and the U.S. will continue to struggle with equal rights issues during my lifetime.

Viola's story reminds us that one courageous person can help create a better world; unfortunately, she also reminds us that courage often comes with a high cost.",1249430400,8,1853,4.745341614906832
2326833,4,B0009WFFXG,"Although nowhere near as well known as Martin Luther King Jr. or Medgar Evers, Viola Liuzzo earned her place in American history by also becoming a martyr to the cause of civil rights.  A white woman who was an activist long before it became fashionable to be one, Liuzzo could have chosen to live her life in quiet anonymity, safely ensconced with her husband and five children in their middle class home in Detroit.  Instead, she headed to the South to lend her services as a nurse for the civil rights march in Selma, Alabama on March 7, 1965, a day that came to be known as ""Black Sunday.""  For on that day, Liuzzo was gunned down while driving along a deserted road by four members of the Ku Klux Klan.  ""Home of the Brave"" tells us her story.

In form and style, this is a fairly conventional documentary, combining footage from the past with present-day interviews with friends and family members of the victim.  Through both memories and documented evidence, the movie paints the portrait of an inspiring woman who recoiled at the injustices she saw in the world around her and ended up paying the ultimate price for her consuming need to rectify them.  The most eye-opening aspect of the film involves the way in which, after her death, Liuzzo became the object of greater government scrutiny than even the men who perpetrated the crime.

The movie shows the rippling effect Viola's death had not only on society as a whole but on the lives of her children as well.  It was her murder that inspired President Johnson to sign into law the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which essentially ended the use of poll taxes and literacy tests for voting in this country.  As to her children, one of them - her oldest son - has since become a recluse living in the backwoods of Alabama, while her other son, Tommy, has become a leader of the Michigan militia, eventually being forced to go underground himself after 9/11 and the implementation of the Patriot Act.  Given the fact that it was the FBI's own undercover agent riding along with the Klansmen who allegedly pulled the trigger that fateful night and that many of the investigators` findings regarding the case seem questionable at best, is Tommy justified in his anti-government paranoia?  It is this question that haunts not only Tommy throughout his life but the audience throughout the movie.

Nevertheless, the film always comes back to Viola and the powerful part she played in helping to change the course of history.  However, the movie does not wear rose-colored glasses, for it informs us that, even today, racism is alive and well in the Deep South.  This is shown most remarkably in the image we see of a black doll strung up in a rural person's backyard, and in an elderly white couple's response of ""I don't know"" to the simple question of whether or not they're happy that blacks forty-plus years ago received the right to vote.  That is probably the most chilling moment in a movie filled with chilling moments.

If ""Home of the Brave"" has a weakness, it is one for which the movie itself cannot be blamed.  Unlike the subject of many documentaries, there are no clips of Viola speaking and no home movie depictions of her before her death.  We see her only in still photographs and even those are highly limited in number.  As a result, she remains an essentially shadowy figure, one whom it is easier for us to see as an icon for a cause than as a fully fleshed-out human being.  The reflections of the people who knew her are certainly helpful in this regard, but they can only go so far in making her come to life on screen.

Still, that is a minor flaw in an otherwise sterling tribute to a truly exceptional and courageous woman, one whose death helped to bring new hope and life to so many others.",1146268800,19,3774,4.584821428571429
2326834,4,B0009WFFXG,"Having had an opportunity to see this movie over a year ago, I have to admit going to see it without any idea of who Viola Liuzzo was or what part she played in the civil rights movement. The movie tells the story of who Viola Liuzzo was through the eyes of her contempararies and of her children, and the effect that her sacrifice had on all of them. In this sense, and with the very apt narration of Stockard Channing, this story is told with both passion and reverance. Also too, the story tells of all too human frailties in both Viola and her children, and as such deserves all the more respect for trying to portray the fact that all of those that we look up to as heros and/or martyrs are just as human as ourselves. For myself, the movie gave me a much greater understanding of what life was like during that period of my childhood that I had only been briefly aware of during the nightly newscasts. Too, the movie portrays what a terrible price can be paid by family when one stands up for their ideals. I definitely believe that this is a must-see movie for anyone that wishes to truly understand the Civil Rights Movement, or that wishes to understand the power of standing up for one's beliefs.",1120780800,27,1206,4.364444444444445

This story begins in what seems to be Iraq. [The hilly dry land reminds me of southern California.] An Army doctor treats a young child. The soldiers play games. Some soldiers are selected for an escort for a medical supplies truck. They pass through a town. A truck blocks the narrow street. People run for cover, there is an ambush! Two trucks take a detour. An Improvised Explosive Device hits the trucks! There are casualties, they need a Medivac helicopter. Their war is over. We see their home life. Life is different. We see the neighbors. Not all return alive. There is a funeral. Another soldier is getting therapy in a hospital.

The souvenirs of a dead soldier are reviewed. I gave that to him! One soldier adjusts to a lost arm. Another finds his old job was filled; he now works as a cashier in a movie theater. He recalls the Good War, where Europeans welcomed the American soldiers who liberated them from Nazi oppression. At night traffic causes a problem. Why is he restless at night? Soldiers talk about their problems over past memories. Whatever. The wounds have an after-effect. Whatd I do?

Vanessa visits Dr. Marsh. Good to see you. Public schools have rules. Buck Bush? [No offense except what you read into it.] A teenage son thinks for himself. Dr. Marsh has conflicts at home. Vanessa uses her plastic arm well. There is an incident with Jemal, he has a problem with his job and his family. It ends badly. There is an emotional after effect. Dr. Marsh takes too much of his medicine, and brings unexpected guests home for Thanksgiving. He talks to his family.

One veteran talks about his memories. Does he belong at home anymore? Dr. Marsh talks about his experiences during a surprise attack. More casualties and emotional experiences overwhelm him after a long 12-hour shift. I don't feel anything. [Doctors should always be cool and unemotional for their work.] Vanessa talks about the time of her accident. She was very lucky. She finds a new boyfriend. Forget it.

Dr. Marsh works on his problems. He talked to his son. One soldier reenlists, he doesnt belong at home. Im going back to do the best job I can do. [Was this some sort of advertising to get recruits for the war?] Wars begin where you will but don't end where you please wrote Machiavelli. [Its easier to start a war than to end it.]

This is not a happy movie but one that should make you think. Were there similar problems after other wars? Perhaps the better economy then prevented these problems? Maybe soldiers who believed in their mission had fewer problems. What about soldiers in other armies? Could this story be an argument for a new or expanded bureau to address these problems? Or is prevention better that a cure?",1459468800,,2753,4.665979381443299
8068024,5,B0009WFFXG,Very interesting film about one of the most forgotten incidents during the Civil Rights movement of the 1960's. It had my attention from beginning till end.

8068029,4,B0009WFFXG,"Treating the historic background and the contemporary context with respect, this documentary is both a tribute to a fearless person and her cause and an effort to rehabilitate the memory of a white American woman, Viola Liuzzi, whose memory and motives were sullied in the aftermath of the premeditated and senseless crime that brutally took her life. Although it cannot bare all the facts and stops short of delving deper into the racist machinations of the FBI (including J. Edgar Hoover himself) and others at the time, it does help to understand the complex issues and familial conflicts that are at the core of this personal story - and of the movement against racial discrimination lead by Dr. Martin Luther King and many others at the time.
Adding a very emotional touch, witnesses who personally knew the heroine of this movie, do lend to its credibility.
But it comes at a price: just as the desription of personal heroes - like in ""Schindler's List"" - center on one person's good deeds, the viewer does not - and cannot - get a grasp on the true horrors of all the historic facts that are at the base of the story.
In this movie that deplorable deflection lies not in the brave historical personality described. As has been pointed out by others, it lies in the very inept and truly misleading title of this production: ""Home Of The Brave"".

That is not the truth, nor does the title represent a valid contribution to true documentary filming.
Sadly, it only reflects wishful thinking. Peter Paulenz",1353456000,2,1509,4.759541984732825
8068030,4,B0009WFFXG,"The title of this documentary is very misleading and the subject of the film is far too important to be overlooked. I remember watching the television news report of the murder of Viola Liuzzo when I was a teenager in the 1960s. This story made a profound impact on me. So much so, that I remember the bullet riddled station wagon and I have always remembered her name--Viola Liuzzo. Being an African-American teenager at the time, I understood just how important the civil rights movement was when they murdered a white woman. Since that time, in my travels and years of teaching English at college and in high school, I always ask people if they know the name Viola Liuzzo and sadly, no one says yes. So I remind them. This documentary is painful to watch when you understand just how she was slandered and maligned, how her family had to live with the pain of losing her and the insult of having her reputation destroyed because she was doing a good thing. I teach my students about heroes, people who set aside their personal lives aside for the greater good of the people. Mrs. Liuzzo is a real hero. And she deserves a place in history. I share this film with my colleagues in the history department, hoping that they can make that happen. I want people to remember Viola Liuzzo.",1251849600,17,1285,4.543103448275862
