Suddenly is the name of a small town in California(Gold First Discovered Here in 1842). A young boy says his mom won't let him see war pictures. [Wouldnt a Western move be more likely then?] He wants a toy pistol. [His father was killed in the war.] Todd is in love with Ellen, she has been a widow for three years. Guns aren't necessarily bad, it depends on who uses them says Todd (a peace officer). She tells her son to remove that pistol. Todd says the boy must learn about the world. A confidential message on the telegraph tells of an emergency! A special train will arrive with the President and security must be provided. Sheriff Todd makes arrangements. Secret Service Agents arrive in town.

The stores facing the train station must be inspected. That house on the hill too. [Is a lone mother the best guide for a son?] Pidge spots the caravan of cars on the highway. Todd shows the routes to that ranch. They want the stores closed before the President arrives. Three strange men arrive at that house on the hill, they say they are FBI Agents and want to look around the house. Nobody leaves the house. He explains why - to protect the President. No strangers were in town. This isn't routine. The Sheriff and Dave Carney arrive to inspect that house. The visitors reveal their true nature! A passing train muffles the shots. The criminals set up a table by the window for a solid base. The leader says he won a Silver Star for killing 27 enemy soldiers at Cassino. Pop has a pistol but the cartridges were hidden! [No gun locks were required then.] Todd knows what will happen: no witnesses left behind.

Johnny shows his leadership. The TV repairman visits to join the captives. They wait for five oclock. Johnny asks for food. He tells about his youth. Johnny says he doesnt know who he is working for! [Motive?] Johnny learned a skill in the war that he used to earn a living afterwards. [For some its auto mechanics.] The criminal sent into town is caught, the shooting warns the police. Johnny acts to solve this problem. Pop Benson suggests a fix to the TV. Pidge retrieves the pills and that pistol! Todd tells the criminals they should leave with what money they already received. But something goes wrong! The shooting is a warning. It didn't stop! The actions of ordinary men prevented the assassination. Pop Benson will be alright, the TV repairman didn't make it. Todd will get a reward. [It takes a good guy with a gun to stop a bad guy with a gun.]

This is an interesting story in itself and as a picture of small town life in 1950's southern California. Note the importance of the railroad. Movies charged 25 cents for admission. Ten cents bought a comic book [before they were attacked to eliminate competition to television]. This movie was removed from circulation after November 22, 1963; it is an implied criticism of the Warren Reports lone gunman theory. Sterling Hayden had an interesting life. He joined the Marines as a private, tested well, and was sent to OCS. Afterwards he joined the OSS and was parachuted into Yugoslavia during WW II.",1446163200,,3099,4.608695652173913
