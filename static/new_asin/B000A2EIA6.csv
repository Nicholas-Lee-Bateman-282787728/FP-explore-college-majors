8072409,3,B000A2EIA6,"If you are familiar with Jeunet & Caro films, you should know what to expect: a bizarre movie that does not even consider giving you any explanation. It is not as good as ""The city of Lost Children"" (creater by Jeunet & Caro) or ""Amelie"" (created by Jeunet) but it is very enjoyable nevertheless.

The story takes place at a time (in the future?) when the shortage of food forces people to eat anything they can get their hands on (savor a cookie!) and pay for things with grains instead of money. The main characters are the inhabitants of an apartment building sitting atop of a delicatessen shop. The shop owner, Dreyfus, is also the head of the household - a fat, rich man with lots of grains stashed away in the depth of basement of the house. There is also Julie, a timid and neurotic bass player. She is Dreyfus' daughter. There is a strange man who lives in a flooded basement where he breeds frogs and snails for further consumption; an old and deaf grandma who knits all day long; a schizophrenic woman who hears voices telling her to kill herself, which she systematically tries throughout the film; her obsessed husband, as well as a few other minor character and two kids. The movie begins with an arrival of a newcomer (Louison) who agrees to work around the house and the shop in exchange for food and lodging. Julie falls in love with Louison and she makes it her goal to save his life. Why? Anyone who leaves their room past midnight ends up as the cold cuts in the Delicatessen shop and the only reason for Louison's employment is Dreyfus' plan to serve him up next. Just like he did with every other guy who worked for ""food and lodging.""

The movie is very funny, although it could look stupid to some. I gave it three stars because I wouldn't consider it Jeunet & Caro's best work, but I would recommend it for watching when you are in the mood for something bizarre and funny.",1138060800,,1898,4.4511494252873565
