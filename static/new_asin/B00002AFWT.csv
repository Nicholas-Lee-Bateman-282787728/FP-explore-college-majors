1252495,5,B00002AFWT,I thoroughly enjoy doing this tape!  It's a quick 30 minutes and I get better each time I do it.  I recommend it totally to anyone who is interested in learning more about bellydance.  I never get tired of it!  My  4 y/o son even tries to do it with me and enjoys it.  Fun workout!,955238400,,281,3.9285714285714284

1252517,5,B00002AFWT,"I own this on VHS and I like the fast pacing of the video. Most other instructional bellydance videos that I own are much slower and break up each segment into parts with a lot of explanation. Neena and Veena get right to it from the beginning and each part flows into the next without any breaks. I find myself having to pace myself at the hip drops but other than that, it's a great 30 minute workout I can do each day. I've been following this routine for 60 days now and I've lost several inches off my waist and stomach and I'm gaining muscle in my upper arms and legs. I use this workout to get into shape and my other instructional videos for routines. Overall, I would highly recommend!",1439251200,,694,4.265151515151516

1252536,5,B00002AFWT,"LOVE THIS, I remember when I was younger doing the Slim Down routine they had and having so much fun.  This is no different.  I do the Basic Moves routine every day, haven't tried the Fat Burning one due to the fact that I have knee problems so I'm a bit hesitant about that one. The Basic Moves works a little bit of everything, arms, abs, and legs.  I LOVE the hip exercises, they do enough to make me feel like I've actually worked out without causing my knee pain to flair up.  It's got a nice little warm up section that rolls right into the main body of the work out. First are arms, then a little rib and abs, and then hips and thighs. Ending it all is a nice stretch/cool down section.  One of the reasons I love this is that it's only 30 mins for one routine so it's perfect for those of us that have busy schedules. Can't wait till I can build up my knees so I can do the Fat Burning!",1407369600,,894,4.0
1252537,5,B00002AFWT,this is a good one to help with the basics. very easy to follow.  I had this on VHS and am glad I found the dvd.,1400284800,,112,3.3076923076923075
1252538,5,B00002AFWT,I have only done the first half of this workout. Basic Moves and warm up.  It lasts for thirty minutes. I love Veena and Neena.  There is calm music in the background as the twins slowly show you each exercise movement. It's slow paced and easy to do. ( For me anyway .)  Great for beginners.  You feel good through the workout and relaxed at the end. Very easy to learn. I will began the second half a little later. This will be a more active ( fat burning.)  I like the background as if you were in a palace.  The twins also wear exercise clothes and a little belly skirt so you can see their movements which I find very helpful. I am very pleased with my purchase.,1393286400,,667,4.131782945736434
1252539,4,B00002AFWT,"Used this video for several months to get in shape before starting a local belly dance class.  Found some of the aerobic section
difficult but just went at my own pace.  I think this is good for beginners.",1385769600,,205,4.368421052631579
1252540,3,B00002AFWT,"The basic moves were a good warm up and I felt winded after the workout. I've used it twice now, but I could see getting bored of it quickly",1383609600,,140,3.8620689655172415
1252541,5,B00002AFWT,"This says it's for beginners and it's fun and entertaining, but whoa, you will feel the results of these exercises immediately!  Neena and Veena are so much fun to watch and they give you a great illustration of what you are supposed to do.
You might want to go easy at first until you learn the moves and don't burn out by going the full pace until you know your limits. But you will get some great moves that you can use for fitness or the next time you want to spice up your dancing at a drum circle or party.  Neena and Veena are my favorite! I have other videos of theirs now.",1381622400,,581,4.087719298245614
1252542,3,B00002AFWT,"The basic moves portion is fine, but I hated the fat burning part!  It would probably be fine for someone with a longer attention span, but I just get bored SO easily!  It feels like there are about five different moves for the whole half hour workout, you just do each one for FOREVER before moving on to the next thing.  It probably doesn't help that I had been doing their Slim Down workout somewhat regularly before trying this one, and it's a lot more fun!  So if you're looking to buy this one for the Fat Burning workout, consider how much you like doing the same move for long stretches at a time.  If that's your thing, you'll probably love this!  If not, get Slim Down instead!",1374537600,,687,4.328125
1252543,5,B00002AFWT,"We own the 4 video set of this series and wanted it on DVD. Though there are no extras, the DVDs had really good quality and seemed like a decent value.",1369180800,,152,3.935483870967742
1252544,5,B00002AFWT,"short version: I've owned this for three years.  Product works if you use it. The music is wonderful and even you, yes you, the one that has no rhythm. Even you will start to intuitively/instinctively move to the music. It'll take a few times, but you'll be a natural in no time. Buy BM+FB if you want to get moving with bellydance moves and are completely new to the idea of dancing to lose weight. Buy AAHBT if you are a little more familiar to the concept. Buy both if you want some variety.

Long version:
When I bought this, weighed at least 298 pounds (135 kilos). I had seen a late-night infomercial for some sort of dancing for fitness thing. Anyways, since then I've lost 50 pounds so far and I have another 100 to go (23 kilos lost, 46 to go). I want to share that with you to brag a little bit, but also more importantly show that when you eat right and use this DVD, you WILL LOSE WEIGHT.

I was extremely out of shape from desk jobs and I wanted to do something fun and not feel embarrassed at a gym like Curves, but also low-intensity so I didn't feel like dying after two minutes. My very first time, I sort of followed along a little bit in Basic Moves, but again, I was very unhealthy and couldn't even keep up. Around my third time, I was able to complete it, and about five seconds of Fat Burning.

'Basic Moves' is low-intensity exercises based off of the basic moves of bellydance. 'Fat Burning' is high-intensity exercises based off bellydance. Obviously, you should know that this is for unhealthy people who need to stick their toes into exercise and ease into it, or want to learn a couple dance moves if you're already healthy.

The narrator's voice is quite pleasant and it is not either of the twins. You can turn it off if you want. The narrator is less 'exercise-y' about it. By that, I mean she is not continuously repeating the numbers of the reps, nor is she explaining HOW to do the moves very much. Since the twins do not speak throughout the video, you will either love or hate this. Basically, the narrator is there is keep you motivated to complete the workout in a calm way. I prefer it like this, but I did find that about my sixth time of working out, I then had some muscles and those muscles realized I had been doing half the workout in a bad/lazy way and then I really felt the burn one I self-learned the right way to do it. If you have a full-length mirror you could pause and compare I guess.

I lost weight (~20 pounds) and built muscle over two months with this through exercise alone (totally was still eating garbage food). Girly muscle is great, being ripped is not! I stopped caring though and gained it all back. About two years passed and then I renewed my determination to be healthy. This time I've lost about 50 pounds and I'm still not tired of BM+FB and AAHBT bellydance videos.

Since I own all three, this next part is to compare this one to the other two. I still have been unable to complete Fat Burning; I'm still 100lbs. overweight and there's some intense jumping/bobbing moves in it and my fat rolls just can't handle it. So in my opinion, I'm only getting half a video with content I can't use yet. I do Basic Moves 2-4 times a week. I do Arms, Abs, Hips, Buns, Thighs 2-4 times a week and it is a little more 'workout'. It has some more focused exercises compared to Basic Moves. In other words, Basic Moves is closer to actual bellydancing than the AAHBT video. The whole third video, Slim Down, I can't say much. It falls into the 'too fat for it' like Fat Burning. I've tried to follow along because I paid for it, but it's too much. Also, in Slim Down the narrator changed and she's all... exercise-y and stuff. She counts the reps and takes all of the fun out of it, making it a workout chore instead of a fun dance. I only play Slim Down with her voice turned off and unfortunately, without a mellow voice to keep me going, I quit before I'm tired.

You can search for these videos on YouTube and they have been uploaded in ten-minute intervals. If you like what you see, consider the purchase. I am grateful that I purchased BM+FB and AAHBT. I do recommend them to others. However, you might find this easy or boring if you are doing fast-pased workouts like calisthenics.",1364774400,2,4250,4.337106918238994
1252553,5,B00002AFWT,So this movie has 2 different workouts & plenty of moves to learn! I am in love with it. Neena & Veena are such great teachers and make this a delightful way to experience belly dancing while doing some steady state cardio :),1360540800,,225,4.255813953488372

If you are just beginning, this DVD is perfect.  You will not be disappointed.

Or,

If you have mastered the art of belly dance, I would recommend this DVD for an extra boost of inspiration.  I can't put my finger on it exactly, but something about this workout video gets the creative juices flowing.

Between buying belly dance videos and renting them on Netflix, this is by far one of the best I've ever seen.  I may be slightly bias from the sentimental view that it was the first belly dance DVD I ever had... but trust me, this DVD is well worth the asking price.",1285200000,2,729,4.3088235294117645

I must admit I had a difficult time trying to pick a belly dancing workout DVD from Amazon's selection. But I was persistent at reading all the reviews.  There were so many. Finally, I came across this DVD and the reviews seemed to be along the lines of what I was looking for, so I crossed my fingers and took a chance by purchasing it.  I am very pleased with this DVD. It is excellent for someone who doesn't have a whole lot of time to work out, for example, in the morning before going to work.  This DVD is perfect for individuals whose time is limited.  For all individuals who are interested in learning how to belly dance this DVD is highly recommended. I give it

Besides that, it works out every part of your body without you hardly realizing it. It gives you a nice womanly, fit, and toned figure. In just 30 minutes for only 10 dollars, what could be better? The fat burning section is also very good and you can really work up a sweat, I have yet to be able to finish the whole thing, it is a real workout!

I'm 39 and have a HORRIBLE back, so I was apprehensive about starting this workout.  The video was well made with clear camera angles that make it easy to see what your body should be doing.  After my first workout, I felt energized and my back felt fine.  The workout does a very good job at stretching your core muscles, which are especially important for those with back/hip issues.  You will feel the stretch in cable, abdominal, and oblique muscles at the end of the workout.  However, unlike other cardio/aerobic workouts, you feel energized and happy rather than exhausted and ache-y.  The basic workout had my heartrate up a bit, but nothing like traditional workout programs.  Try this video if you dislike gym style workouts, but would like to try something gentle and fun.",1234137600,2,903,4.707006369426751
1252585,4,B00002AFWT,"""Bellydance Fitness for Beginners - Basic Moves and Fat Burning"" featuring the Belly Twins, Neena and Veena provides a basic and very pleasant introduction to the age old art of Belly Dancing.

So that you can better use my analysis of this presentation to make a decision as to whether or not you would like to add this tape to your workout collection, let me preface all my comments with the following information.  I have been exercising for over 30 years and have successfully maintained my figure with a combination of exercise and diet that has served me well.  I am not a dancer, however, I have used Pilates and ballet to strengthen my core.  I am not particularly flexible yet I can get through a fairly strenuous yoga routine.  While my usual cardiovascular routine revolves around running outdoors, I enjoy the combination of kicking and punching used in kickboxing to tone and add definition to my arms and legs.  A firm believer in strength training, I advocate the Xtreme Fitness method of lifting heavier weights for less repetitions.  It all works well for me.

With that in mind, I like to mix it up a bit especially when the weather is bad and I cannot go out on the levee and run.  Rather than travel to my local gym, I opt for home exercise simply because I can step it up a notch by adding more movement if the presentation does not elevate my heart rate to what I require for my optimal fitness. With ""Bellydance Fitness for Beginners: Basic Moves and Fat Burning""  I did not have to step it up at all.

I had learned the basic moves from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amira-s-Belly-Dance-101-Dvd-a-5-Star-Instructional-Video-of-Belly-Dancing-Basics-for-Beginners/dp/B000DZB8XA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amira's Belly Dance 101 Dvd, a 5-Star Instructional Video of Belly Dancing Basics for Beginners</a>&nbsp;DVD, so I went directly to the Fat Burning session which runs for around 30 minutes.  The twins start you off with head rolls and leg stretches that are challenging enough to get the seasoned exerciser interested.  From there, the tempo increases and the twins lead you into a dance sequence that is fairly easy to follow albeit the voice over instructions are a bit vague, i.e. the background voice will tell you to ""Jump, Jump"" when the movement required to emulate the twins' foot action is a little more complicated than that.  I found that just throwing my head back and feeling the beat of the music helped me to disregard any concerns about getting the actual movement just right--when I stopped thinking about it, the step naturally came.  Now all of these movements are rather fast, however with repeated watching and practice the routine comes along nicely and provides a good workout for both the heart and the legs with the added advantage of feeling just plain sexy!  From rocking back and forth on the feet, the routine advances to a skipping motion and then accelerates into some heavy duty jumping on the toes.  I must admit that I had a pleasant little calf pain the next day which told me that the routine worked my legs as promised. I have done the routine 5 times and have enjoyed it each time.  I have decided to purchase the twins other dvds and a coin scarf to add some weight to my waistline.  I want to hear some jingling when I shimmy.

After Fat Burning, I tried the twins' Basic Moves portion of the presentation.  This routine is an introduction to the basic head, arm, shoulder, waist, hip and leg movements used in belly dancing. I stress the fact that these movements are low impact and will probably come easy to someone who has had dance training or has taken belly dance in a classroom environment.  For me, listening to the music, hearing the beat and making my body move languidly was a challenge that I enjoyed participating in.  I enjoyed doing this portion of the program after the Fat Burning because my body was already warm and more flexible after the cardio.

Bottom Line?  Veena and Neena are lovely to watch in this presentation of ""Bellydance Fitness for Beginners: Basic Moves and Fat Burning.""  If you have an interest in this form of dance, this dvd makes a good introduction.  The seasoned dancer would find this too rudimentary and could probably make up a routine of her own to work up a good cardio perspiration.  If you are interested in a good workout, the Fat Burning portion followed by the Basic Moves segment provides a fascinating alternative to other exercise formats. Not only will you sweat, but you will feel sexy while you do it.  The Fat Burning session may seem daunting as it consists of a lot of jumping, but keep at it--move only from the knee at first until you are read to use your feet and calves.  Its well worth it.  I have purchased 3 other DVDS starring the twins which I look forward to viewing, doing and reviewing!  Recommended.

1252588,4,B00002AFWT,"I bought these for my wife. She had already started with Neena and Veena overseas and we bought the DVD's for here. Overall they have a great dancing style and are fairly easy to follow.
The main problem is that you will need to rewind a lot when you first start out watching these as they tend to go a bit fast and not explain anything very well. A big help would be to put a full size mirror next to the TV to make certain you are doing the movements correctly.
Also if you want to learn how to do a Drum Solo look elsewhere as they really don't do them as well as others. They do have an alluring style of belly dance and if you can follow it, it's excellent but they really need to break down what they are doing instead of having you follow along with no explanation.",1227571200,,772,4.052287581699346

I'm so thankful that I did because these videos provide a basic understanding of belly dancing and a thorough workout, complete with warm-up, strength training, and cool-down. Veena and Neena are knowledgeable and explain the movements very clearly. This is a video every belly dancer should have: it is an excellent source for beginners, as well as something experienced belly dancers should refer back to.",1224979200,,591,4.584905660377358

1252591,4,B00002AFWT,"I bought this DVD to supplement a beginning belly dance class I was taking. The first half of the DVD included many of the basic moves I learned in class, as well as a few other simple ones. There was a bit of a learning curve, but they were fairly easy to pick up on. The second half was quite a bit more challenging. The fancy footwork is beyond my beginner level.

There is a dance demonstration before each half of the workout. While Neena and Veena are completely enchanting, and the demonstrations are well worth watching, I don't really want to sit through a five minute dance before getting to actually dance myself. So I usually fast-forward through those parts. It would have been better to just leave those demonstrations at the end of the workout as a ""treat,"" rather than inserting them before the workout.

I find the first half to be a gentle, invigorating workout. The second half, however - maybe one of these days I'll work up to completing it!",1211328000,,962,4.522988505747127
1252592,4,B00002AFWT,Neena and Veena provide an easy-going stretch workout and a much more intense fat burning workout (which a lot of beginners will probably need to work up to). Both are great in their way and I recommend the DVD.,1207612800,,211,4.435897435897436

1252594,4,B00002AFWT,"I enjoy dancing, but I had never tried bellydancing.  I tried this workout to get an intro to bellydance and exercise all in one.
There are many things that I like about this video: There are a lot of good isolations that will help tone certain parts of your body (I especially felt it in my arms).  There are also a lot of good hip isolations, which seems to be the heart of bellydancing.
But, I did not find myself enjoying the dancing/workout, and I think it comes down to the fact that bellydancing may not be for me.  I found it to be a little too slow and it didn't get my heart-rate up very much.
While this was not really my 'thing' it seems like this workout does provide a good introduction to basic bellydance moves and good isolations  that will work on toning some of your muscles.
Also, the dancers (Neena and Veena?) perform the moves beautifully.  So, I do not think that my opinion of the dancing is a reflection of the dancing, in general, or the instructors.",1204934400,,977,4.346153846153846

1252599,4,B00002AFWT,"The ""Basic Moves"" section of the dvd is good if you feel like ""taking it easy,"" being graceful, or just want to learn a few bellydance moves. It moves at a slow pace, and can be relaxing if you have the patience enough to be in a slow mode for 30 minutes. I use it as a long cool down after my cardio exercise work.

The ""Fat Burning"" portion of this dvd can be demanding on your body. I have been exercising for over 6 months,  for 6 days a week for an average of 50 to 70 minutes at a time. I was able to get through the entire exercise, but my calve muscles were hurting for a week. I like a challenge, and surprisingly, I had fun doing the exercise, and I worked-up a good sweat. However, I would not recommend this portion of the dvd for individuals with bad knees and/or calve muscles or, individuals who have been seditary (e.g., do not exercise on a regular basis). If you do plan on using this portion of the dvd, I recommend that you use your own modifications (I know that I will be doing this in the future). This section of the dvd contains much jumping and bouncing on your feet as well as your toes.  Also, there is NO bellydancing in this section of the dvd, except for a portion near the end called the ""choo choo"" where you are on your toes. This section of the dvd is about 26 minutes long (7 minutes for the warm-up, 14 minutes for the cardio section, and 5 minutes for the cool down)

I gave this dvd four stars because it adds a different change of pace to my regular exercise routines. I own quite a view exercise dvd's, so something different is always a welcomed change. I took one star off because I think the title of the dvd is a bit deceptive. Yes, this dvd is a beginners dvd if your are new to this style of exercise, but it may not be suitable for someone who is a beginner to exercising in general.",1195257600,,1831,4.120448179271708

This is a half hour dance *instruction* video.  Some moves may tire out your shoulders and hips, but it isn't much of a ""workout,"" and definitely not cardio or strenuous.

~10min of head/neck & shoulder/arm movements .

~10min of rib/hip movements.  ~5min of basic steps.

~5min of floor moves (Cleopatra/outer thigh lift, cat, leg stretch)

They introduce individual isolated moves, and repeat them several times for users to practice; most moves were easy to pick up (but will take time & practice to make it look graceful).  I don't know if it's the instructors or if it's because they are demonstrated isolated motions, but they look a bit robotic/jerky.  This seems is an  Intro to belly dance for total beginners.

I think people with previous belly dance experience will find this basic video too slow/boring and stiff.

However, I did not like the fat burning portion.  I was bored to tears.  It's a lot of bouncing, no hip or belly work at all.

1252612,5,B00002AFWT,"The emphasis of the title for this DVD would be ""workout,"" because while you are moving fluidly through dance moves, Neena and Veena are focusing on the basics rather than a choreographed routine. This works well for anyone at the end of the beginner scale or middle of intermediate bellydancing. The exercises are fast enough to give you a cardiovascular workout, but not so strenuous as to leave you catching your breath. Well, a few times during the Egyptian folk dancing segments it was a little more challenging.

There are two main sections with a second workout focusing on fat burning. The first workout can be used to stretch and warm the body. Both workouts are narrated and the music is inspirational.

During the truly enjoyable ""Basic Moves"" section the shoulder isolations are especially good as they allow you to work slowly into the shoulder shimmies with added confidence. In the Fat Burning workout you increase the strength of your feet and lower body by jumping around a bit more as you might in folk dancing. I found the exercises to be fun, challenging and emotionally freeing. In both sections you practice beautiful hand movements and get an excellent arm workout.

Overall I found this to be challenging for your feet, knees and shoulders. You will feel a burn in your calves as you try to remain up on your toes. The Fat Burning section is especially effective to help you increase the flexibility in your back and enhance your feminine grace. Drinking lots of water during the second section is recommended. I'd say that you will enjoy this most if you are intermediate because of the fast pace of the Fat Burning exercises.

Even if you are intermediate to advanced, there seems to be an interesting array of new exercises because this focuses more on the folk and Egyptian style of dance. If you are interested in increasing your awareness and talents in those two areas, I can highly recommend this to you.

1252617,3,B00002AFWT,"There are essentially two parts to this DVD: the basic moves, and the fat-burning workout.

The basic moves are a good teaching tool, and a decent low- to intermediate-level cardio workout.

The fat-burning section is INTENSE. I could barely get through it. There is a lot of hopping and jumping around, as explained by previous reviewers. My biggest gripe with this workout is that it's very repetetive and boring. There's only a few moves that are repeated for a very long time, and I found myself looking at the clock far more often than I'd like. Also, this section doesn't really focus on classic ""bellydance"" moves-- at least, not that I recognize. So it's not even helpful for teaching in that respect.

Overall, I'd say it's worth it just to see the twins dance, and for the light workout provided by the Basic Moves. For intense cardio, however, I'll go somewhere else.",1153440000,14,878,4.7631578947368425

The 'Basic Moves' section of the workout is exactly what it says: basic bellydance moves intended to work out the entire body and it does. Definitely. I've been doing these various bellydance workouts for a few years now and this still managed to beat me up just as it did when I first started. I plan on using this workout for a good long time as a source of general strength training. Now because I've been doing this for a little while, I can't really say if some of the moves might be difficult for people just starting into bellydance, but I don't think they would be. I think it'd be a good starting point for those interested in getting into it.

The 'Fat Burning' workout is intense. Really intense, almost too intense for me. I've yet to be able to finish the whole section and I've been working at it for a few weeks now. The cardio does not dissappoint though it can be really taxing on the body if you're like me and get overheated quickly. Just be careful, keep ventilated and have plenty of water and some gatorade and you should be okay.

The reason I put this at 4 stars instead of 5 is because while the Fat Burning section does the trick, it's also too harsh for people not used to cardio workouts. Personally, I've gotten overheated numerous times doing the workout and had to stop and hydrate to prevent myself from getting nauseous.

I'm picking away at it, but I'm not through the whole workout yet.  Even though I have to stop in the middle, I do feel better after the workout.

The second part is a lot of bouncing around, which gets the heart pumping, but not my cup of tea since it is hard on my knees.  I will do this workout when, say I've eaten one too many cookies and know I need a little more calories killed off that day.

It is well produced (no lavish sets and over-the-top costumes), easy to follow, and when the credits roll you can actually see one of the twins doing a full out belly dancing routine.

It's pretty, it's sensual, it's not too dance-heavy (for those of us who are coordination-challenged) and is a pleasant way to break up your workout routine.

This video is personally erotic, beautifully feminine and artfully spiritual. It's a terrific way to spend free time and has not been something to dread (as opposed to other workout videos) because it's as good for the mind and spirit as the body. This video is ""Me Time"".

The girls are lovely, have normal female bodies and the voice-overs aren't cloying, sugary, or filled with false pep.

1252625,5,B00002AFWT,"This DVD has what used to be sold as two separate VHS tapes -- ""Basic Moves"" and ""Fat Burning"".  My review is really just of ""Basic Moves"", which I love.  This video is intended for people who try to exercise regularly.  Over time, exercising gets REALLY BORRING, I mean, honestly, no matter what you do for exercise, you are doing the same thing over, and over, and over, and over again.  Also, most exercise tapes span a very limited range of movement -- for example, you never bend your spine or twist your torso.

""Basic Moves"" is a fun exercise tape that adds some much needed variety in your life.  Instead of the usual step aerobics, weight lifting, or traditional dance steps, this exercise tape uses belly dancing moves.  As a result, you'll find yourself moving in ways you never have before.  Unless you are a skilled bellydancer, these moves will be totally different and a pleasant surprise.

The workout is challenging because it uses muscles that most exercise plans completely ignore.  Overall, the workout is moderately aerobic, moderately muscle building, and fantastic for improving your overall range of movement.  Movement is an aspect of health that most exercise plans ignore.  Add ""Basic Moves"" to your exercise plan once a week and you'll be pleasantly surprised.

This workout has background music that is enjoyable and upbeat, all bellydancing music.  Visually, the workout quite entertaining:  colorful backdrop, windows with scenery, and a the two instructors look happy.",1134604800,12,1500,5.040650406504065
1252626,3,B00002AFWT,"I love the way this dvd makes exercise fun and the twins are good instructors. The first section is enjoyable and relaxing but very low key. I like using it on days when I don't feel like exercising but I don't consider it challenging enough to do by itself most of the time. It's more of a great warm-up. I agree with many previous posters that the fat burning section is not for beginners. I consider myself in good shape, around the intermediate level of fitness, but I can't come anywhere near doing the fat burning section the way it is presented. I can make it through it if I don't hop as much as they do but it bothers me to ""dumb down"" a workout. I had exercise-induced asthma as a child and after doing this routine, it made me cough again which I haven't done after exercise in a long time.

  I would recommend the basic moves for exercise beginners or for intermediates who want a fun warm-up. The fat burning section seems to me to be for people with an advanced level of fitness who have no knee, ankle, heart, or breathing problems. I would really like to find something like this dvd only on a level for intermediates.",1129420800,,1135,4.34433962264151
1252627,5,B00002AFWT,"I read some other review complaining about how the video is not low impact. The video states in the beginning that you should consult a doctor before starting any excersize program and also encourages you periodically to slowdown, try simplifying the move, or to stop if the moves become too strenuous. By doing this it encourages the viewer to go at their own pace while at the same time allowing people viewing the video for the second or third time an opportunity to continue to stretch their limits. If someone does not follow the directions to stop if there is strain, that is not a fault of the video.  This isn't a video that you will buy, use twice and put in a closet because you can do it all already and don't need to see it anymore.  The video and the time they spend on each move helps you guage your progress and build your endurance. This is a good workout that quickly gets you heart-rate up and lets you know you are getting some excercize!

I also liked the way it kept the movements simple and showed them for a long time, giving you an opportunity to observe exactly how the movement is supposed to work.  I watched another video, Bellydance! Magical Movement and thought that their frequent costumn changes, lack of real direction, and the short time spent on any given motion to be rather unmotivating and distracting. This video is different because it allows you to get simple movements down very well and a chance to build your stamina because from what I've seen, if you want to bellydance, you are going to need it!

If you get this video, do it the first time with a friend.  Like I said, it can be difficult in the beginning if you try to hard to keep up with them, but its so much fun to laugh together as you try!",1126915200,3,1744,4.38390092879257
1252628,2,B00002AFWT,"If you explore bellydance fitness and instructional videos and DVDs on Amazon you'll see everyone and their momma reccommending this one.

But this is NOT The best DVD out there for instruction OR fitness.

First of all: the ""basic moves"" DVD is a decent basic instruction, however there are other bellydance DVD's that teach a LOT more basic moves, such as the Goddess Workout with Dolphina or Magical Motion with Atea (the one that I would REALLY reccommend).  Even Neena and Veena's ""Discover Bellydance - Basic Dance"" teaches more than this DVD.

Second: the ""Fat Burning"" workout is, in a word, DANGEROUS.  There are several moves done in this workout, including head rolls during the workout and an extended piston shimmy (aka choo-choo shimmy, that whole toe-tapping on the balls of your fee thing) that can cause injury when done incorrectly.  The DVD does not teach the proper technique to do these moves.

Thirdly, ""Fat Burning"" is an extremely difficult workout and would be very bad for anyone with trouble in their ankles, knees or hips.  After the first time I did it my calves were excruciatingly sore for a week.

Fourthly, though the ""Basic Moves"" part does teach some bellydance moves, the moves used in ""Fat Burning"" are mostly just exercise moves.  If you want to learn to bellydance or do a workout that uses a lot of bellydance moves, you'll want to look elsewhere.

The Discover Bellydance workouts by Rania offer a far more gentle workout for those who haven't been exercising for a while.  For someone who exercises regularly, wants a workout that uses a few bellydance moves and can still be challenging, Neena and Veena's ""Slim Down"" is a far better choice.",1120435200,19,1684,4.84965034965035

1252630,3,B00002AFWT,This video is a good work out and will get you moving but for someone with knee problems watch out.  The first part with basic moves is good but the fat burning cardio has a lot of jumping.  This part is not only very hard on your knees but you do the same move for almost 5 minutes straight.  I am in good shape but had very minor knee surgery 7 months ago.  My hasn't given me any problems for at least two months untill I tryed to do this video.,1119571200,3,448,3.89010989010989
1252631,4,B00002AFWT,"I have a large collection of home fitness DVDs... Bellydance Fitness for Beginners is something that I throw in only once every few months when I need a change of pace.  Everytime I do it, I'm surprised at how much of a workout it actually is.  It truly gets my heart pumping and I am always sweating by the end of it.  Another plus, is that it REALLY works out the calf muscels, which is an area that many fitness DVDs do not include.  Another thing I love about the video is the hypnotic arabic music - it is such a nice break from the cheesey music on the rest of my workout DVDs.  The only downside of the DVD is that it only has a few moves that it repeats over and over and over.....  Also I should point out, this is a good DVD to add variety to your home workouts, but it certainly won't teach you to be a belly dancer....",1116288000,2,830,4.030487804878049
1252632,4,B00002AFWT,"This is the first bellydance video I have ever tried, and I enjoyed it.  At the start of the workout, the twins jump right into upper body and neck stretches--these days, it's considered a no-no to stretch cold muscles without warming up first, but this DID feel good in my shoulders and neck.  They then move on to introducing simple moves such as shoulder and hip ""punches,"" starting the moves slowly and then gradually increasing the pace.  In this manner, you learn to go from isolated movements to ""shimmies"" in your shoulders and hips.  I thought some of the hip movements were particularly fun, although it took me a few tries to catch on at times.  At the end of the workout, there are a few brief moves on the floor to work your inner thighs and provide a stretch, and then it's back to standing for a final stretch, bringing the workout in at a total of about 28 minutes.  Although I found this video to be fun, I felt that it provided only a very light workout, mostly through the toning work in the upper body and perhaps a bit of cardio work during the faster movements towards the end.  Therefore, the video would probably be best suited to beginning exercisers who need a gentle, low-impact workout or more experienced exercisers who enjoy doing a lighter workout now and then.",1116288000,3,1292,4.543103448275862
1252633,3,B00002AFWT,"I have some dance experience, so the first time I went through this workout, I was arrogant enough to think it would be too easy.  Veena and Neena don't switch moves very rapidly--they stay on each stretch and step for quite a while, and there is additional voiceover narration to help.  My arrogance quickly evaporated after 15 consecutive minutes of hopping with my arms held less and less gracefully at varying points above my shoulders.  The fat burning section is NOT for beginners, or I'm a lot more out of shape than I thought.

Pros:  The directions are clear and the moves are lovely.  This is a nice change from other workouts in that it offers new moves, and it's relaxing to hear the music--the set and costumes are pretty, and it's nice to imagine you're moving as beautifully as they are.

Cons:  Some of the moves are difficult to fit to the Eastern music, so if the move is on a count of 4, it feels awkward to stay with the music.

Also, I'm too impatient to really appreciate this workout--I want to get right to the fat burning, so I don't want to go through the slow, relaxing, head rolls and stretches in the first section.  But then when I get to the fat burning section, they do the same move over and over for the longest time, and I get too exhausted to finish properly and cheat by stepping instead of hopping.  It's not a great pay-off, the way some of the cardio salsa routines are--you don't feel like you're mastering steps and having fun so much as enduring some Survivor-style mental challenge (which, so far, I am continuing to fail).

I think if you were in excellent shape, you would love the fat burning section, and if you wanted to build strength over time, you would love the warm-up section.  The routines are lovely, but so far, none of them work quite right for me.",1110326400,11,1807,4.455927051671733
1252634,5,B00002AFWT,"I really like this video. First of all, there is NOT a lot of annoying introductory talking. The workout is low impact but will get your heart rate up when you get to the fat burning section.

I thought that there could have been a little more emphasis on teaching bellydance, but I did learn some good moves.

The camera angles are nicely done and professional. I really enjoyed the brief dances that Veena and Neena included.

It's a good deal! It's for beginners- exactly who the video says it's for.",1106784000,6,503,4.5054945054945055

1252636,3,B00002AFWT,"In searching for an exercise routine I could find motivating and stimulating, I came upon this title. Just the word 'bellydance' drew me in and it was a must have. Now, while I have enjoyed the Basic Moves section I feel like it does almost nothing for me. Maybe it raises my heart rate for a while, but it hasn't helped me tone up or lose any weight at all. On top of that, no matter how easy that section becomes, the Fat Burning section still requires a much higher level of activity because of the constant hopping. It's too big a difference for me to get used to. I'm asthmatic so my lungs get tired and tight really fast (lots of water helps immensely). Most workouts are fine for me. It's when jumping is included that I can't handle it well. Another reviewer advised to just step into positions instead of the hopping, so I'll have to try that and see if it makes it easier for me. Otherwise, I'm unable to finish that routine.

Now, I'm currently working out to the Classical Pilates DVD (intermediate) and, while I find there's nothing that has been better for me, I continue to use the Basic Moves routine in this DVD because it keeps me feeling really flexible (and yes, sensual).

If you can handle jumping around, then I'm sure the Fat Burning section will work well for you. But for me, the DVD has only given me as much as 3 stars can afford.",1104969600,7,1358,4.34251968503937

1252638,3,B00002AFWT,"Fat Burning (25 mins) is almost straight hopping. You can make the workout easier by stepping through the moves instead.  It will definitely get your heart rate up, and zaps the calves like nothing else.  Mine actually ache for several days after doing the routine.  The warmup and cooldown are enjoyable. This is a brief but CHALLENGING workout.

The other segment, Basic Moves (30 minutes) is low impact and low-effort.  It's more like a ""day-off"" workout--less strenuous than most yoga and pilates DVDs.  You will experience some upper-body toning as you do make ""snake arms,"" shimmy, and do other dancelike, sinuous moves. But unless you're a real fitness beginner, it won't work you out.",1096416000,8,692,5.026315789473684
1252639,5,B00002AFWT,"I love the beginning workout on this CD. It reminds me a lot of Tai Chi--but with music and some prettier moves. I bought this DVD to have a short and easy workout to alternate with an easy Tai Chi workout. I can almost do this workout and will be able to do it soon. It covers all sections of my body, but is not so strenuous that I will damage myself. Veena and Neena are experienced instructors and they make the workout fun, relaxing and thorough. I have not done the fat burning portion yet--I will save it for when I can do the basic moves easily and want to step up the action. It looks like there is a more advanced set of DVDs that is available if I ever get really smooth and want to move it up more.
This is a very professionally done DVD with attention to scene and background selection, good sound, selection of music and costuming as well as sound method.
Many films of this nature often leave a lot to be desired--but this one is professionally laid out and I will enjoy it for years.
I will probably buy the more advanced three set if I put in enough time to get smooth on this beginning tape.:)
I am too old to want to bellydance in a public class, but this is really fun and inspiring to try this in my own home. :)

It is really fun to do and the music they play in the background is great too. The only thing is I wish they would last longer than they do! This is the funnest way to exercise. You'll really enjoy it. But beware! After the first time you do it (both basic moves and fat burning) your WHOLE body may get really sore (especially your hips but that means the exercises really work and that your doing all the moves correctly!) You might need to take 1 or 2 days off before you do it again. Overall I can't wait to buy the rest of the DVDs from their collection!!,1088121600,5,731,4.304347826086956

Admittedly, my arms were more out of shape than I anticipated, as I found out while doing the various movements on this DVD.  The moves may feel a bit odd to those of us without any prior bellydancing experience, but I easily caught on.  I didn't realize how much of a workout I was getting until I sat down at the end and began to seriously sweat!  It's long enough to get a good workout, but short enough that it doesn't feel dragged out with filler and talk.  I can see how over a short period of time, the moves would become more natural.  This is a very fun workout that is both aerobically and visually stimulating.  It is well worth the money and time invested in it.",1087171200,7,740,4.205673758865248
1252643,4,B00002AFWT,"I recently rented this video because I wasn't sure if I wanted to actually buy it.  I have a bad lower back due to a work injury, so I was asking around for something low-impact.  Well, this is it! I haven't had to quit because my back was hurting too much to continue.  That's great! I've only done the Basic Moves part so far and I've only done it 3 times. I like the way the exercises move down your body, and no part is worked out too much. I also really like the music. The best part is I can already tell that my muscles are toning up. Everyone I know has commented ""have you lost weight?  Are you working out?""
I'll be the first to admit I usually don't do the whole workout video thing.  Mostly because they're boring, not fun, they hurt too much, etc.  The production value is not as good as I would have liked.  The narration threw me off the first time I did it, but after that I just ignored it.  Unfortunately, tuning the narrator out is almost essential.
Other than those two complaints, I'm extremely impressed with this DVD and will be buying it once I have the money.",1081468800,4,1084,4.202898550724638
1252644,4,B00002AFWT,"Basic Moves was the first Bellydance VHS I bought; I absolutely loved it because the moves were broken down so extremely well that I never felt discouraged and rather was motivated to learn more and buy more tapes. I continue to love this tape because now I use this routine to keep my fundamentals strong. Also more recently, I purchased the Fat Burning VHS and, well, Veena and Neena weren't kidding. This is definatley an awesome cardiovascular workout: the moves are simple and involve TONS of jumping (which i think is terrifically fun). I would die to try this on a giant trampoline just for the laughs!
Now that I've been upgrading to DVD, I noticed that these two workouts were on the same disc. Wow. This defines the difference between Lo Impact and Hi Impact better than anything I can think of. I tell you this: both programs are amazing no matter what level bellydancer you are, but definately be careful with Fat Burning if your fitness level isn't too high.",1079481600,5,971,4.651162790697675

They are workout videos. It says that right on the box and in the reviews. You want dance instruction, go buy a dance instruction video, and the twins do have several.
And as workout videos go, the whole series is great, including of course this one. I'm easily distracted and its hard to keep me entertained but these workouts are fun. Sure, its cheese and everyone else is saying the same thing, but that's because it's the truth. I only wish there were more videos by these two women. They are fun to watch and I enjoy the gentle guiding voice that gives the instructions. I don't feel like an idiot by watching or using these DVDs. It's a far cry from my mothers 80s workout videos!

1252646,4,B00002AFWT,"The first one is low-impact and low-sweat (for someone who is not completely out of shape like I am, no-sweat).  It's fun and sensual, and although some moves are tricky and you may have to view them in slow motion to get them fully (but I am phenomenally uncoordinated, so it might be easier if you're normal:)).  The next morning, your biceps will be sore.  Your obliques (the side abs) might also be.  During the workout, you'll also feel your outer thighs, abs, front of thighs, shoudlers and glutes.
The second workout contains a lot of JUMPING. Quite high-impact When you do it, you sweat and you jiggle all over.  However, it gets your heart rate nice and high and it gives your calves a killer workout. Your biceps will be sore the next day too.
For both workouts, the instruction and the demonstration are fine, although some parts of Neena and Veena's bodies do get cut off sometimes.  The instruction, however, is clear, and you get the option to turn it off once you know what you're doing.  Their outfits let you see EXACTLY what they are doing.  I found their bright smiles slightly annoying (but then, for the most part, you don't have to look at their heads so it's not important). By contrast, you DO have to look at their midsection quite a lot, and I found the fact that it's not completely flat and firm comforting (doesn't make me feel like a fat sow by comparison) and helpful (it's easier to figure moves out if the presenter's body is sort of like yours because then you know exactly what should be moving/jiggling and what shouldn't be).
I didn't like the fact that if I chose the Neena and Veena commentary option for audio, there wasn't any music to accompany it.  The commentary itself was interesting though.
Finally, the extra dance footage is varied and gives us beginners something to strive for. Also, Neena and Veena's little entrance dance gives us something more ACHIEVABLE to strive for.:)",1077667200,3,1926,4.641176470588236

In the  commentary, Veena and Neena reveals more information on the specific moves done in the dvd and some background/history of some moves etc...Also In the special features are EXTRA DANCE FOOTAGE. It is my favorite part in the special features section. Five seperate dances are shown, and I must say, VERY beautifully done. Each dance shows different forms of Egyptian bellydance (dancing to a drum solo, with a veil, cymbals, a sword, and a cane.)
Basic Moves is a slow, non-impact workout that is so much fun!!! It was hard for me to believe, just by watching the dvd, that the workout could have any effect on me. But it did. This workout doesnt build bulk, instead it tones the muscles and trims the fat on your body.
Fat burning is very hard for me. Its hard to keep up really. But its IS a good workout. There is lots of jumping/bouncing in this part of the DVD, so there is lots of emphasis on the calves.",1073260800,9,1197,4.4409090909090905

the fat burning portion is good. the twins take you through the proper ratio of hard/easy (1 to 3) to get a good cardio workout. this really works your legs (and i walk a lot, 1-2.5 miles a day).  plus this workout is short(30mins), which i helpful if you don't have a full hour to work out.

(although dolphina does say, ""ok and this time, do it with attitude!  like, 'aren't i fabulous?  but you can't have me!'"" which quote, in itself, is worth the price of the video.)  neena and veena are very accessible, they show you how to feel the flow of it.
after doing this tape once, three times i have found myself spontaneously doing the moves just for fun.  that has never happened to me with the goddess workout.  this workout just connects.  i also like the way the video was shot -- it's a very nice voice over, so you can hear the instructions very clearly and neena and veena aren't shouting.  also the camera stays on the right parts them and gives you different angles to see the moves from.  i haven't tried their other tape that i ordered yet, but i love this one.",1063497600,15,1220,4.417040358744394

Basic Moves is a good introductary tape and really helps you get started and confident in what you're doing. Fat Burning is a fast-paced cardio routine. Neena and Veena are great instructors and the routines are quality recordings, with very few continuity errors.
My few complaints with the DVD are that when playing through both workouts, I shouldn't have to suffer through the closing credits between sequences, and the commentary tracks, while interesting, were VERY sparse. I think each one lasted for about half the routine.
Both of these are such minor quibbles that I don't think it brings down the overall quality of the routines. I just wanted to mention it for the absolute purists out there.

I've never seen a tape like this before though, and would imagine it's great for breaking the monotony of a stale workout regimen.
The warm up consists of a some good stretches, with lots of twisting and control in the hip region (no surprise) later on in the tape. The arms are not ignored either - there was more 'snake arm' and shoulder work here than I anticipated. Camera angles are good, and the music is very ethnic and appropriate. These 2 ladies are very graceful and doing the tape with them  made me feel like maybe one day I will be to.",1043452800,2,1013,4.276041666666667
1252660,5,B00002AFWT,"I LOVE this video!! It is great if you are interested in Bellydancing as a workout. I am new to the dance and find this video to be a great video for starting out. It teaches you some basic moves, preparing you for the next level. It shows you how to isolate your muscles and get you into better shape for learning the dance. This video is a WORKOUT video. (FIRST in the series)...  But I believe THIS video and series will be EXCELLENT in PREPARING and CONDITIONING a person for the dance. ...Long live the oldest dance.",1039219200,5,521,4.316326530612245
1252661,2,B00002AFWT,"After reading all of the positive reviews on this DVD, I had high expectations when I popped it into my DVD.  The beginning is very promising, showing Veena and Neena performing a beautiful, exotic belly dance.  This is not what you will be doing.
  What you will be doing is repetitive, simple movements.  Underline repetitive.  During the beginning moves segment, I did feel it in some muscles I haven't used in years.  However, the workout does not resemble the dancing they do in the introduction and again at the credits.
  I was extremely disappointed in the fat burning segment.  Yes, I was sweating at the end of the workout.  However, the moves were so repetitive and unchallenging it was about as engaging and fun as jumping rope.
  I expected to be able to do a belly dance routine, or at least a series of 5 or 6 moves to make up my own routine, by the end of the DVD.  This DVD will not teach you enough to do so.  If the workout was closer to the belly dancing seen during the intro and credits, I would have been thrilled.  It was not.  I am going to rent before I buy another belly dancing DVD.",1033084800,21,1110,4.336585365853659
1252662,5,B00002AFWT,"I bought this Bellydance DVD along with their other VHS tapes.  I'd say this DVD is better than their VHS.  More workout More value.  I hope Veena and Neena will produce more varieties before we watch the same tape too much and get bored.  This is an excellent workout program, beautiful and fun.  Definitely a good investment.",1031097600,4,327,4.666666666666667
1252663,4,B00002AFWT,"This might not be the hardest workout in the world, it might not be the best but it will motivate you, move you and yes, excercise you.
The Basic Moves are fairly easy to do and a great start before you move on to any other of Neena and Veena's videos (specially the Slim Down VHS which is my favorite).
Fat Burning seems easy when you watch it but give it a try and you'll feel it.
I have found that using a bellydancing belt or scarf (you can get them at ebay for a good price) is really encouraging, it helps you keep the rythm and motivates you to move more and make sounds that not only sound beautiful, but you'll hear them matching the movements in the screen and will make you feel like a real bellydancer.
The DVD is a great value since you get for one low price, what you would otherwise have to buy as two separate VHS for about the same price.  I also recommend the Arms, Abs, Hips, Buns and Thighs DVD and the Slim Down VHS.",1027123200,15,937,4.092391304347826
1252664,5,B00002AFWT,"Step aerobics. Been there, done that. Tae Bo. Been there, done that.  I wanted a change in the usual workout.  I'm slim but I wanted to be toned up more (especially for fitness & for my modeling work).  I ordered the ""Fitness for Beginners"" box set.
I must say that these videos are a BREATH OF FRESH AIR.  Not only do you feel sensual as you learn the moves, but you also realize that ""HEY! I CAN DANCE!!""  Further, Neena and Veena keep you interested with tips and ideas, while the music helps keep you upbeat and ready for more.
I strongly recommend this video to EVERY WOMAN who wants to tone up, get stronger and get more flexible--- all while being sensual and feeling feminine.  What could be better???",1024272000,11,709,4.415384615384616
1252665,5,B00002AFWT,"I've just started out learning to dance (after a year of pondering the idea). This was the first thing I found in VHS form, and after going through it I had to convert it to DVD.  The first one is awsome for people who never quite learned how to move their bodies beyond walking and running (me!). It teaches the basic movements that will be incorporated into dance at a more advanced stage, as well as focuses on the exercise aspect of it. Plus, it takes the time to let you see how different things are done, rather than rushing ahead just to show off the expertise of the dancers on the video. The same thing goes for the second work out on this dvd. I was very happy with this and am looking forward to getting a hold of anything else by these sisters.",1023148800,6,756,4.213793103448276
1252666,2,B00002AFWT,"Wow, this is by far the worst dvd I own. Aerobically-its a good workout but you have to suffer through long repetitive movements that get boring FAST. Plus you have no shoes on so make sure the padding under your carpet is new to avoid injury. And, I never felt like I was even close to belly dancing. The extra dance segments that feature the twins dancing made me feel that this video was more about their self promotion than me getting into shape. Pass this one up or give it to your man for his personal enjoyment-thats about all its worth.",1022716800,6,544,4.3431372549019605
1252667,4,B00002AFWT,"I absolutely fell in love with Belly Dancing thanks to this DVD. It has helped me lose 2 pant sizes in a month (From 24 to a 22)and has upped my confidence, energy and has helped me develop a new love- Belly dancing!
My personal opinion: Basic Moves is best if you are a total novice to belly dancing, and if you are pretty out of shape. I would highly reccomend Basic Moves if you are looking for a work out that will teach you some moves, is fun, challenging yet dosen't leave you feeling like your gonna die any moment.
My only gripe is I don't understand why they included one of their HARDEST work outs on the same DVD as their easiest. I have weak ankles, so the fat burning portion of the DVD which deals mostly with Egyptian Folk dancing is pretty much a no go for me. It seems you would need to be in really good shape to do the fat burning portion.
If you are out of shape, I would save the money and just buy the VHS of Basic moves.",1019606400,15,943,4.048128342245989
1252668,5,B00002AFWT,"Neena and Veena present themselves well, and wisely leave the narration/instruction to voiceover, while concentrating on presenting the moves as cleanly and clearly as possible.  Basic Moves starts with a fluid warmup that leads you gradually into more strenuous activity.  This would be perfect for someone who's just beginning to explore belly dance and is not ready to invest in classes and gear.  It's not as good as taking a class, but it's a great supplement to those classes for someone like me, who needs to be lead through the warmup and workout.  I found it helpful to watch the sister on the left to see how to DO the moves, then watch the sister on the right to add more flair as I've gained confidence.  The second workout, Fat Burning, is a lot harder, so unless you're already in good shape, save it til the Basic Moves starts to feel too easy. I am woefully out of shape and cannot yet make it through more than half of the session (but it's only been a few undisciplined weeks.) I AM still having fun with it though, which keeps me motivated.",1017187200,17,1059,4.523560209424084
1252669,5,B00002AFWT,"This is a great tape. It was the first bellydance-oriented tape I bought, and it was after I hadn't worked out in any capacity for a good three months. I popped this tape in one night, found it very managable and pleasurable and was left feeling exhilirated - so much, in fact, I rewound it and did the moves again. After that I was hooked. The moves in this tape are not strenuous - stretching, some very mild aerobics, and so on, with a bit of bellydance tossed into the mix - snake arms, hip circles, Egyptian folk dance moves, head slides and so on. It is an excellent foundation tape, good for limbering up, and the twins demonstrate everything clearlyp; plus the camera shows the full body or zooms on on legs, etc. to give you a clearer example of the moves. Some people could do this tape without breaking a sweat, myself included, but it feels great to wake up the muscles with this tape. Excellent for the beginner, a warm-up or a quick 30-minute pick-me-up.",1012521600,,968,4.443820224719101
1252670,5,B00002AFWT,"The ""beginners"" part of the title is in reference to the DVD in question offering instructions on how to bellydance for someone who may never have done it before. It teaches basic moves and exercises the various areas of the body that are used during bellydance.  DO be able to get through the first workout if you aren't in shape -- but do NOT expect the same with the second workout (hence my reason for refering to the title as deceptive).
The basic moves section of this DVD is good for someone who is out of shape (like me) and looking for something that stretches and challenges at the same time. It doesn't really burn fat or get your heart rate going like, say, a Tae-Bo workout would, but it does get your body moving and teaches you some unusual dance moves at the same time.
The fat burning section is something else entirely. Intermediate users who have some tone and strength to their muscles might be able to deal with the constant up-down-up-down movement, but even after a month of fairly steady exercise with other titles, I still can't get through the first part of this workout. The constant bouncing in particular seems to agitate my knees and ankles.
So, in short -- the first workout is good for stretching, coordination, grace, and learning a little bit about bellydance. The second is good if your knees and ankles can take it and you have the endurance to tough it out. That person isn't me, but it might be you :)
DVD options include sound type (Dolby 5.1 or Dolby 2), editing out the commentators's voices, and information about the benefits of bellydance. The dance footage that was originally part of the credits on the VHS versions of these workouts is also included, and I would almost say that they're worth the price of admission. As difficult as I found the second workout to be, I find watching Veena and Neena dance to be awe-inspiring. They are very good at what they do, and their costumes are incredible!",1010448000,164,1943,4.583333333333333
1252671,5,B00002AFWT,"I love this video tape! I have bought other dance fitness tapes (Paula Abdul and even Richard Simmons) and even yoga fitness tapes but THIS tape is my favorite. I look forward to exercising!
The exercises are not intimidating at all and Neena and Veena take their time explaining each move. You work your arms, abs, butt, hips and legs! A complete all over body workout that is low-impact and that can be done at your own pace. I feel much more graceful and sensual after doing this video tape for seven months. And my hips are much looser and flexible, which is important to me since I had a hip dislocation six years ago.
This is a fun workout that only takes 30 minutes of your time! I totally recommend it!",998092800,4,710,4.386363636363637
1252672,5,B00002AFWT,"Seeing the advertisements for the Bellydance videos featuring Veena and Neena on TV, I was skeptical.  I thought to myself, ""This is just another 'miracle workout' that won't work.""
Later, as I went to the Nature Company, one of my favorite stores, I saw the video sets, and decided to buy this beginner's tape to try it out.  I went home, popped it in the VCR, and was amazed by how easy and fun bellydancing could be!  I've never been one to enjoy exercise, because I found it boring and repetitious.  However, this Bellydance Beginner tape is fun, and you won't believe how quickly the workout goes by.  Just when you are having maximum fun, it's time to cool-down and end.
Now, I feel healthier, have noticed a dramatic loss in my waist-area, and feel sensual and sexy.  One great thing about the tape is that not only is it a fun way to stay fit, but it is also a way to feel sexy-after all, who says you can't show your partner your new moves? =)",997142400,12,952,4.350282485875706
1252673,5,B00002AFWT,"I am really enjoying this video while getting back in shape. Since I had taken a belly dance class several years ago I was familiar with  the basic moves but, I enjoyed the refresher. The beginning of the tape is actually very relaxing and the woman doing the voice over has a great voice. The twins are fun to work out with and I enjoyed the continuous format of learning the basic belly dance moves in a flowing way that keeps you moving. ( although, don't expect to learn how to put all the moves together from this video ... But...it will give you a nice foundation to move on to additional instruction later on ) I wish I had this video years ago.. It is a nice low impact exercise without much or any sweat involved. I bought the set and I know I will be ready to move on to the next in the series after a couple of weeks but for those days where I just want a little something to get my body moving , this will be perfect..  And the middle eastern drumming in the background is just perfect too. As an amateur doumbek drummer I am planning on playing along with the video for practice also.

I've already lost 20 lbs!!! I've just purchased the ""Fat Burning"" workout and the ""Slim Down"" workout. I look forward to trying these two videos.

1252675,3,B00002AFWT,"I use this video as a change-up from Tae Bo and aerobic boxing, as a a way to stretch out and be more feminine and ""fluid"" for a change.  I've also used it when for various reasons I needed a less intense workout. It won't do much for you fitness-wise, some moderate toning at most.  You also won't find yourself with a repertoire of dance moves, though it does begin to build some of the muscles you'd need to do bellydancing. It begins with stretching, then head and neck, arm, waist/ribcage, and finally the most intense part of the workout, hip and thigh exercises.  The music is great and the sisters are fun, not too flamboyant.  They could have spared us the silly voice-over!  But this would be a good addition to your workout library or a pre-introduction into bellydance.",985392000,4,781,4.55
1252676,5,B00002AFWT,"I bought this tape after reviewing all the bellydancing tapes available thru amazon.com. I'm glad I did. This is a great tape for the beginner. The instructions are great and easier to follow because they are not wearing the flowing skirt part of a traditional bellydancing costume. Neenea and Veena are classy and professional. The workout, which consists of isolating different bellydance moves, is simple to follow, straightforward and lasts about 25 to 30 minutes-which as a busy mom is often all the time I get! My sister did the tape with me and commented that she didn't even break a sweat. The next day she called me to report her whole torso was feeling the effects of the workout. I think Bellydance is a lot like Yoga or Ballet; on the surface it seems easy enough. It gets harder the more you do it - and the more you do it correctly. I would highly recommend this tape to anyone who would like to try bellydancing. And to anyone who wants to work on their mid- section. After doing the tape for one month, I found that each time, as I got better at it, I did break a sweat and saw the effects! Like Yoga, I do come away feeling relaxed, open and full of feminine energy, which also benefits my husband!",975628800,13,1215,4.428571428571429
1252677,5,B00002AFWT,"I disagree with the people who say this workout doesn't teach you to dance -- a lot of what I've learned from just this video I've used while dancing.  The two times I've gone dancing, in fact, people have turned and cheered me on when they saw I was shaking my hips like there was no tomorrow.
But it probably is a poor video if you're looking to create dances out of what you learn here.  It's an EXCELLENT video, though, if you want something unusual and fun to add to your workout routine, which is why it's called the Bellydance Fitness WORKOUT.
If you don't have a lot of money, go with this video first.  If you're out of shape (like me), it WILL get your heartrate up and stretch your limbs.  Then when you get to a point where you're able, go for one of the other three.
I recommend it for a workout.  There are moves in here that make a woman feel sensuous and sexy, even if she doesn't have Neena or Veena's body :)",973036800,39,926,4.150837988826815

The excercises are very  concentrated, and quite easy to catch on to.  However, because of the  repetetive nature of the routine, if you have any shoulder or upper back  injuries, this is NOT the video for you.  I could not do it because I have  a pinched nerve which it really irritated.  But if you are looking for a  way to work that ""bye bye"" flab away, get this video.

Visual Demonstration is whole body  view, 2 demonstators, repeating the motion enough times for the viewer to  get a handle and be able to keep up as well. This is entertaining enough  that I actually study different aspects of the women each time in order to  improve.
