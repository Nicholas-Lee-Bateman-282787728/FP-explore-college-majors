8431526,3,B004J2FIZ2,"The best dark comedy film is ""He Died With A Falafel In His Hand"" from Australia, directed by Richard Lowenstein. This is a smart, stylish and sexy film. I give it five stars. If you liked the early films (Trainspotting and Shallow Grave) by Irish director Danny Boyle, I think you will like this one.
For second place I like the Canadian film ""Falling Angels"", which is about an incredibly dysfunctional family. I give it two stars.
For third place I have a tie: ""Aaltra"" from Finland, which takes place in France and Belgium, and ""Adam's Apples"" from Denmark, which is about God vs. Satan. I give each one 1 star.",1380672000,9,615,4.54954954954955
