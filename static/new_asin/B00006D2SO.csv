1744377,3,B00006D2SO,"I thought this was going to be a step-by-step exercise video, and it was not.  There are a couple of moves demonstrated, but all in all, it's a bunch of people doing a bunch of different dances.  It was fun to watch and it did get my daughter dancing, but it was just different than I had expected it to be.",1109548800,2,307,4.016393442622951
1744378,5,B00006D2SO,"Coach Coz has kept my 3 and 4 year old entertained for hours.  They enjoy imitating the dance moves  and get a real kick out of Coach Coz.  He is definately the coolest guy in town!!Coach Coz has kept my mischievious girls busy so I can make dinner, do laundry, and clean up uninterrupted! This video is a priceless addition to our collection!",1034553600,,343,4.412698412698413
1744379,5,B00006D2SO,"I actually thought this would be fun for my youngest daughter who is 3, but when I put the video in, my 13, 9 and 7 year olds were glued to it as well! It is REALLY lots of fun, and FUNNY too! The dances are engaging for kids, and it keeps you humming..""Coach Coz, he's the coolest guy around..."" I am looking forward to their next release!",1034553600,,340,4.014705882352941
1744380,5,B00006D2SO,"My children love the Coach coz video.
They have fun practicing the dances - snake, twist, and the water sprinkler.
I would highly recommend this video for all ages.",1034380800,,164,4.689655172413793
1744381,5,B00006D2SO,"Coach Coz And The Kid Crew made a better gift for my children than I expected.  I purchased the video for my older son (7 years old) thinking that it would be right up his alley, considering his age and all, and to my surprise my youngest son also loved it, who is only 19 months old!  They both dance to all of the songs and kid-videos and my wife and I get a huge kick from their responses.  I highly recommend the video to any parent who is looking for clean, wholesome fun for their children.",1034208000,,496,4.092783505154639
1744382,5,B00006D2SO,"From the moment we got the video, our son Kyle has been mesmerized by it - he loves to learn the new dances and at 2 and a half, he is just too cute as he dances around the room. He loves that there are kids in the movie, that there is alot of action and that he can move around, sing and dance with the video. Our neighborhood kids are in love with the video too. We have adults and kids dancing together in our family room on a regular basis. We love it!!",1034208000,,457,3.8210526315789473
1744383,5,B00006D2SO,"We got the tape last week, played it for our kids and they went nuts. They jumped off the couch and started laughing and dancing and singing along with Coach Coz. The tape is well made and will get a lot of use in our house. Get one for your kids.",1032912000,,247,3.8627450980392157

7967444,5,B00006D2SO,Coach Coz and the Kid Crew is a great DVD. My five year old niece and nephews love it. It has also been a big hit with the neighborhood children. They have so much fun doing the different dances that Coach Coz teaches them.,1135296000,,223,4.090909090909091
7967445,1,B00006D2SO,I thought this was going to be a fitness workout. It was like a home video of people dancing and acting silly.  I am extremely disapopinted with this.,1131321600,,150,4.357142857142857
7967446,5,B00006D2SO,"This video is absolutely awesome!  Every night when I come home from work, all my three year old wants to do is watch Coach Coz.  My wife says that they watch it 2-3 times during the day too.  It's good old wholesome fun and I highly recommend it to anyone!",1127260800,,257,4.1
7967447,1,B00006D2SO,Well I bought it to teach my students how to dance for PE.  Not a good idea.  Very little instruction.  It's more like a home movie showing off his neighborhood kids with music.  I'm very dissapointed.,1121558400,2,201,4.5
7967448,5,B00006D2SO,"Coach Coz and the Kid Crew is so much fun! It'll get the kids up and moving and the parents can enjoy the music from our earlier days.

I have given a couple videos as gifts and my friends' young kids love Coach Coz!",1118016000,,216,3.909090909090909
7967449,5,B00006D2SO,"What a great video! I have 2 boys 5 and 2 1/2 and they love Coach Coz! It is so great that we can dance to the music that I heard on the radio growing up! ""Car Wash"" and "" Shout"" are way better than the usual kid stuff. My boys dance and laugh at the silly stuff. Coach Coz makes my kids happy and that makes me happy. Rock on!",1117756800,,327,3.619718309859155
7967450,5,B00006D2SO,We love this DVD!!  Our 2 boys watch Coach Coz everyday and can't wait to get home from school so they can watch!  They do all the dances with him and sometimes make up some of their own!!,1117756800,,188,3.9210526315789473
7967451,1,B00006D2SO,"I gave this video 1 star but actually it deserves no stars.  This was a very bad video.  It is not an exercise video, just a grown man dancing throughout the video.  My daughter, who is 3, refused to watch it after the first 3 to 4 minutes.  I've tried to give it away but no one will take it.  I can't say that I blame them.  Please DO NOT waste your money.  I was highly disappointed.",1112659200,2,386,3.935064935064935
7967452,1,B00006D2SO,"This was billed as an exercise DVD.  It is not!  It is a couple of demonstrated dance moves, and a very few late 70's and early 80's songs.  I feel like I wasted my money.",1112659200,,171,3.8285714285714287
