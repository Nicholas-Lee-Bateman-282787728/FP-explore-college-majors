6076055,5,B00GHH9IKI,"From the moment Dawnn Lewis hits the stage  the fun, excitement, heartache and life lessons begin. Every note of this wonderfully written and skillfully directed piece is a testament to the subtle genius of Don B. Welch. He has an uncanny knack of casting an array of uniquely beautiful and talented artists to tell the stories he creates with his heart, mind and soul.  Vanessa Bell Calloway, Judy Pace, Freida Payne,  Tammi Mac and  Jonelle Allen are electric in this story of lifes ups and downs, love and loss.",1393113600,3,514,4.741573033707865

6076067,4,B00GHH9IKI,"Dawnn Lewis did such an amazing job in this play. Yes, it is a play. But a good play. Interesting, and informative. Of course Vanessa Bell Calloway did a good job. The closeness of females and the way they shared their stories were a treasure. Freda Payne and Judy Pace ( Brian's Song) play their roles well also. I enjoyed this movie. Get your girlfriends, get a small party going on, and watch this play. I watched it with my mom who has cancer, and we both enjoyed it. I have to keep finding good movies for the both of us to look at,and this was a winner.",1403740800,2,559,4.185185185185185

6076072,5,B00GHH9IKI,"Don B. Welch has put together another great cast to tell another very real story. The entire case brought their A game. Love, Loss, Death, Secrets, Reconciliation, Friendship, and so many other themes were touched upon. Well written and well acted. Definitely a movie I'd add to my collection. I really appreciated the fact that the lead character was a strong woman who recognized her own strength and didn't have to go back to an unhealthy situation. Women being shown in powerful positions is wonderful especially in this day. Don B. Welch takes care in how he presents women and it was refreshing to see the friendships and love between the characters. A great film with a great message. Also enjoyed the opening song called ""Back to Me"" which really captures the essence of ""The Divorce."" Anticipating the next film by Don B!",1393459200,,830,4.811188811188811
6076073,5,B00GHH9IKI,"Don B Welch has a way of blending legends with new talent flawlessly!  I love his Plays!  The Divorce was funny and spoke to me on so many levels.  Divorce for me has never been on the table, but I know so many people who have gotten Divorced. The message of how Divorce impacts everyone was played out so well.  Don thanks for laying it out on the stage and Big Screen!  You are an amazing director you pull talent out of retirement, pull legends with new talent, and make them all work on the stage and big screen flawlessly. Vanessa Bell Calloway character kept me laughing.  Dawnn Lewis character keeps you empowered in the midst of your life storms. All the other cast members kept us hanging onto each transition. Awesome Awesome Awesome. I've seen the play several times and now I can rewind the scenes and experience them over again with friends and family. I can't wait to see what is next in the amazingly creative mind of Don B Welch director, and live stage dream weaver. I love It!",1393372800,,994,4.434065934065934
6076074,5,B00GHH9IKI,"I picked up ""The Divorce"" by Don B. Donald Welch at ""Walmart"".  I enjoyed it, I laughed and cried.  Great writing, and entertaining.  That cast is off the chain!  They were all wonderful.  I loved all of them.  Good stuff.  I'll just say that life is to short. Lets learn to love and communicate family.  I am sure this piece of work is going to touch and heal some individuals.  A story that will make you think.  This is real stuff.  I've seen these people before. You will not be disappointed. There are some twist and turns that will make you say:  WOW! WHAT!",1393372800,,563,4.3076923076923075
6076075,5,B00GHH9IKI,"This writing in this film is so spot on! The way the women are depicted is so real that we all know someone like these people. This movie talks about friendship, has some good old fashioned gossip, it also includes dealing and living with an illness. But, the most noticeable and heart-wrenching aspect is the dialogue. The relationships we see between sisters, friends, and mother/daughter is so dynamic! Everyone needs to watch this. Miss Judy Pace is everything! And Dawnn Lewis is such a natural actress. I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!

I recommend this film to any writer, actress, storyteller, and all young adults as well as middle-aged and older.",1393372800,,644,4.908256880733945

8623193,2,B00GHH9IKI,"I generally don't watch filmed stage plays because they tend to be cheaply-made, statically filmed, and poorly written, with cliched plots, predictable outcomes, stereotypical,  under-developed characters, and annoying audience responses. Despite my reservations, I purchased THE DIVORCE, primarily because Judy Pace, THE film goddess of the 60's and early 70's, makes a rare appearance and has a featured role (still looking naturally beautiful, by the way). Also, I'm a fan of Dawnn Lewis and Vanessa Bell Calloway. After viewing the film, I got pretty much what I expected. THE DIVORCE starts off as a (stereo)typical ""chick flick"" comedy, but becomes an intense mother-daughter drama. I enjoyed the dramatic scenes much more than the comedy, largely because Ms. Lewis and film and stage veteran Jonelle Allen are so powerfully effective in their scenes together. They give the play/film it's most honest,  realistic, and affecting moments. Don B. Welch's script, which throws in a few too many distracting, unnecessary, and unresolved soap opera-ish subplots, doesn't give the rest of the talented female cast (including Tatyana Ali, Freda Payne, and Tammi Mac, who, oddly, is not listed in the credits) much to work with, though Ms. Pace manages to get some laughs with her amusing portrayal of a publicity-hungry snob married to an older man, and Ms. Bell Calloway brings her usual down-to-earth ""realness"" to her role as the earthy BFF. The two hunky male actors seem to be included primarily to provide eye candy. It was nice to see the versatile and under-used Ms. Lewis in the starring role, though she is, strangely, fourth-billed after Ms. Bell Calloway, Ms. Ali, and Angell Conwell with a ""with Dawnn Lewis"" credit as if she is a guest star (???).  THE DIVORCE (which perhaps should have been called THE DIVORCE PARTY) is a fairly typical, fairly predictable ""chick flick""/filmed stage play, elevated by the performances of Dawnn Lewis and Jonelle Allen. A better script would have made it a more worthy vehicle for these talented actresses, but I think most female viewers will still find it entertaining. I'd give it an extra half star if I could. It was great seeing Judy Pace on the screen again!!! Still a lovely, classy, sexy, charming lady.",1446508800,2,2260,5.119241192411924
