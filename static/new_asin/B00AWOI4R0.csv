8558486,5,B00AWOI4R0,"I was following Bobby Hacker from his YouTube days and I gotta say I about lost it to see cars 3 was released on DVD and more so that it was a Troma release! I'm still giving this 5 stars because it is THAT good but I gotta say that its disappointing that they had to remove the ""Reggie and the full effect"" soundtrack which I'm assuming is for licensing issues. Outside of that it's just as good as it was since I saw it as a funny or die exclusive!",1429747200,,450,3.956043956043956
8558487,2,B00AWOI4R0,"I am Troma's biggest fan. But I am not YouTube's biggest fan. I didn't know what Cars was when I bought this, but it looked...entertaining. It's only about 40 minutes long, thankfully, because this video is annoying, and to me, it wasn't very funny. It was like a Tim and Eric skit, only...this guy doesn't have the talent that Tim and Eric have, and can't pull it off. Now, I have seen worse, and I am sure there are people who will enjoy it, it just wasn't for me.",1377129600,,466,4.247191011235955
8558488,5,B00AWOI4R0,This movie was like Philadelphia and Lethal Weapon teamed up to fight The Passion of the Christ inside a helicopter made of Freejack DVDs. People should buy it and show it at weddings.,1372550400,2,184,4.606060606060606
8558489,5,B00AWOI4R0,"Bobby Hacker, the creator and director of the ""Cars"" webseries, of which the main film on this disc is the continuation, is something of a visionary in contemporary indie circles. Not only has he created content primarily for the online market, forgoing traditional distribution channels almost entirely (until this release,) but he's done so with a distinctive style and unique sensibilities that don't fit cleanly into any category and defy comparison with other works. The two are related, of course--forgoing traditional distribution allows Hacker to create more unique works, and conversely, his unique sensibilities are more suited to online distribution than they are to traditional markets--but that is really besides the point. The point is that Bobby Hacker's Cars 3 is awesome. Awesome in an off-beat, crazy, totally unique way where, if you weren't paying attention or if you didn't know what it was all about, you might end up totally confused.

In fact, even if you were paying attention, you might end up confused. That, however, is a tremendous part of its appeal.

Cars 3 is the story of one used car salesman's frantic, trippy adventure to sell a Mercury Topaz within one hour, to avoid losing his soul to the Devil. To say anything more than that would really do a disservice to the film, as well as to miss the point completely--the joy of Cars 3 isn't in the plot, it's in the execution. It's a wild ride, filled with absurd humor and an enthusiastic revelry in the idiotic, propelled by nothing less than unbridled insanity. It has a unique look, a unique feel and is full of unique performances and unique writing.

If you're worried that you'll be lost watching Cars 3 because you haven't seen the first two installments, fear not: they're both included on the disc as well, as special features. In fact, the disc includes a total of nine Bobby Hacker shorts outside of the main feature itself. These shorts are under titles such as ""Jesus Sandals,"" ""Roy Orbison's Bird S*** Fetish,"" ""Dusty Desperados,"" and of course ""Cars"" and ""Cars 2."" In addition, there is a handful of trailers from Troma included on the disc, and the great extra content (listed under ""Tromatic Extras"") that we've come to expect from them. The entire package is completed by appealing menu designs which match the quirky personality of the films on the disc. The sheer volume of content included on this DVD would make it worth the purchase, not to mention the quality of the content. Cars 3 is funny, clever, unique, fast-paced and extremely entertaining, and it's bolstered by a bevy of extra content that can be described the same way. I can't guarantee that you'll know exactly what you've seen by the time it's over, but I can guarantee that, if you go into it with an open mind, you're bound to enjoy it a lot.",1372291200,,2814,4.821946169772256

8558491,5,B00AWOI4R0,Hey this was the best movie I've ever seen! All of the bonus features were amazing as well. I love all of the decision makers videos they are gonna be famous soon. Thanks Troma for putting this out.,1366934400,2,198,4.2368421052631575
