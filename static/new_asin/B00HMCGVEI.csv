8633517,2,B00HMCGVEI,Disappointing product. Interviews were great but there were so many more highlights they could have used. There were very few highlights from the WS and the NLCS. There was no mention of how the Mets went into Chicago and won 2 of 3 from the Cubs. Nothing about Swobodas 2 HR game or the DH when they won by 1-0 twice.,1489017600,,318,4.229508196721311

8633520,5,B00HMCGVEI,"Ah yes, the 1969 season.  What excitement.  A fun DVD for any Mets fan.  Great to see the guys again.  The quality of the DVD shows its age but it still is worth the money.  1969.  It started with the Jets beating the powerhouse Baltimore Colts in the Super Bowl and then the Mets beat the favored Baltimore Orioles in the World Series.  New York had Baltimore's number that year.",1469577600,3,380,4.3428571428571425
