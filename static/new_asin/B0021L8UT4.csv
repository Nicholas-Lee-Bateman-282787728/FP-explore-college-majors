3836072,4,B0021L8UT4,"When Will (Gaelan Connell)'s mom gets a new job, he has a chance to change high schools and reinvent himself.  In movie tradition, he meets both a feisty brunette and a hot blonde, and gets to spend a lot of time hanging out with them.  The brunette loves to read and has a pretty good voice; the blonde recruits Will to manage their band (her boyfriend's got a band, too) so they'll be ready for a competition called Bandslam.  The brunette (Vanessa Hudgkins) turns out to be vulnerable beneath her tough exterior.  The blonde is a former cheerleader with her own Wikipedia page, and Will can't quite believe she likes him.  You can probably tell where this is all going, but it's a sweet movie and manages to feel fresh despite the clich&eacute;s.

Here the parents of the teens are either completely absent or always in the same room.  Lisa Kudrow plays Will's helicopter mom, who we always see hovering over her son, including in the bathroom while he showers.  Unlike so many movies where the kid's parent shows up at the last minute to watch his performance in the Big Show, she's right there the whole time selling t-shirts and cheering.

Frankly, I liked ""School of Rock,"" in which Jack Black plays a substitute teacher who organizes a multicultural group of kids to compete in a rock concert better.  The musicians seemed to be having a lot more fun performing.  You could believe, for once, that it was their love of music, and not just a desire to win, that was driving them.  Also, even if the ""SOR"" characters' were stereotypical, most of them at least got a storyline.  Here it's just Will's character and the two love interests.'  The rest of the characters are ciphers, but you root for them anyway.",1250553600,3,1715,4.617161716171617
3836073,5,B0021L8UT4,"The only words i can use to truly describe this movie are ""Terrific, amazing, spectacular, moving, fantastic, heart warming, ..."" This movie is a must see. Do not let the numbers from the first week affect what you may think about this movie. Watch it and let everyone know what you think. I promise you will only be disappointed if you are purely narcissistic.

The Movie tracks Will as he goes from the no so invisible ""DWI"" (Pronounced do-ee) to the music man of our day. He moves to get away from his old school where he was made fun of because of his past. At his new school he meets Sa5m (the 5 is silent, played by Vanessa Hudgens) who is a quiet book worm. The two pair up in Human studies (something like that) on a project to find out who the other person really is. During this project he meets the highly forward Charlotte Banks(Aly Michalka), a very spunky help all save the world attitude. Charlotte acts as Will's tutor of life and love while will him self teaches her about what music really is.

This is the basic description. Go see the movie without question.",1250294400,5,1078,4.4120603015075375
3836074,3,B0021L8UT4,"For the first time this year, a teen film actually appeals to teens. It's painfully routed in fantasy, a trend most adolescent movies tend to follow, but with interesting characters and a hip soundtrack, the target audience is likely to be thoroughly entertained. Formulaic at times but unpredictable at others, Bandslam isn't as unique as it is well-timed. Amidst the really sour teen flicks popping up in theaters, this is less immature, more comedic and generally more fun.

Will Burton (Gaelan Connell) trudges through high school life in Cincinnati at a school he describes as Guantanamo with a lunch period. It's Novocain for the soul, providing him a constant source of boredom and bullying. His mother Karen (Lisa Kudrow) brings him great news that they're going to move to New Jersey, and although he feels that his classmates will provide much of the same old annoyances, at least it will be a chance to start fresh as an unknown.

At Martin Van Buren High, he quickly attaches himself to a quiet, dark and mysterious girl named Sa5m (Vanessa Hudgens) - the 5 is silent. He also discovers that the cafeteria is used for live band performances and to support the local group the Glory Dogs, led by Ben Wheatly (Scott Porter), a singer/guitarist who is too cool (and too old) for school. Glory Dogs enters every year into the Bandslam competition, a battle-of-the-bands contest that awards the winner with a $10,000 record deal. Ex-Glory Dogs singer Charlotte Banks (Alyson Michalka) discovers that Will has an uncommon knowledge of music and uses him to jumpstart another band to compete in Bandslam, courageously going head-to-head against the school favorite. With his new career as a band manager, the confusing advances by Charlotte (a bound-to-be-trouble blonde with her own Wikipedia page who refuses to answer ""Why"" questions), and his occasionally overbearing mother, will young Burton have time for Sa5m, the girl he really likes?

It seems that teen dramedies always get carried away with pure fantasy, most notable when the dorky lead character immediately makes friends with the two hottest girls in school. In similar fashion to School of Rock, he also luckily unites several of the most talented musicians in the state to somehow work together and form an amazingly original band in which everyone has mastered improvisation and spontaneity. Anyone who's actually been through high school will probably wonder where exactly miracles like this take place. Fortunately, although the reality is slim, Bandslam employs enough humor and drama to keep things interesting, along with a good twist at the end and naturally catchy music. It's a film that may not boast the most original premise, but at least teens won't be disappointed in the entertainment value, even if they have to look past the mild PG rating. It's certainly a level more realistic than the High School Musicals.

3836535,5,B0021L8UT4,"My only regret with this movie is that I did not purchase it sooner when it first came out.  When I first came across this movie in the department store,  I quickly put it aside because the cover and the initial description sounded like just another poor attempt at ""another teen movie"".  But then I months later, after watching movies like ""Josie and the Pussycats"" and ""The Rocker"", I wanted to find more movies with various rock band focuses...and with trip drawing closer with a desire to pack in a few new movies, frankly I decided to bite the bullet and do more research on ""Bandslam"".  And the more and more I looked into it, the more interesting it became.  Obviously, I was finally convinced to give it a shot...and I'm totally glad I did.  It had some truly beautiful moments and inspiring messages.

CONTENT ISSUES:
Honestly, I really didn't remember too much issue for the content.  There may have been a few minor language things (such as a d-word here and there) but it's pretty clean in the language department.  The only ""sexually"" problematic scene is not sexual at all.  One of the female leads sneaks into the protagonists room via the window because she wants to share a potential song that they can do and make a deal with him.  After he accepts, in her happiness she starts tickling him on the bed...bad timing for the Mom to come in, right?  Exactly.  But honestly, there were no ""sexual"" things to really worry about.  Not even any innuendos.  Basically, this film is amazingly clean for the day and age.

PLOT & THEMES (ABSOLUTELY NO SPOILERS):
A  lot of movies that center around rock bands and rock music take a ""free-spirit"" and/or ""rebellious"" angle or perspective.  I was expecting ""Bandslam"" to go that route...have the loner rebellious kids, have musicians learn that they ""need to let go"" in order for their music to shine, etc.  I was pleasantly surprised that the film did not go that route one bit.  Sure, it had the loner kid...but he's no rebel and had a great relationship with his imperfect Mom.  He's also not apposed to meeting new people.  As to the music philosophy, it was actually meaty, useful, and realistic.  The protagonist taught them to listen to the other parts happening around them and fit into it.  He also taught them that the real power is not in the flourish of notes or flashiness (musically or visually), but in restraint and knowing when to hit the accelerator or back off.  And I really appreciated their perspective on music creation.  A lot of music films focus on music being an expression of emotion (which it is)...but this film took a slightly different angle.  Music is like a page in your life journal.  It's not just a pouring of your emotions, but glimpses into moments in your life...the happy times and the tragedies.

However, one thing that needs to be addressed was the amazing depth of the storyline and the wonderfully paced storytelling.  Again, I will not give you any spoilers because part of t he joy and impact of the film is watching it unfold.  But what I will say is that this ""teen movie"" did something that none of the other recent ""mature"" movies did for me...they actually had a multi-faceted storyline that interwove the 3 distinct issues of 3 individuals as well as the issues of a band into a cohesive and meaningful tale about redemption, family, new beginnings, second chances, the power and influence of good friends, and musicality.  Not only that, but this was one of the few films that gave me some good plot twists...or even turned cliches into unique experiences. Above all, with all these themes and issues...the pacing was great!  They always gradually pushed forward...in fact, there was always a new reveal even in the last portion of the film.

MUSIC:
Well, this being a music-centered film...certainly I should touch a little bit on the music.  I will be honest, the music, by itself is nothing that really stands out.  If I just heard the album by itself, I would definitely say the songs are nice, but nothing that is ""earth shattering"".  However, when in the context of the film itself, the music really shines since they help bolster what is happening as well as compliment the various characters.  A cool bit of trivia was that as part of the casting requirements, the the cast had to be able to provide vocals and instrument playing for the songs.  In fact, everyone in the cast recorded their playing and singing except for 3 of them (they did learn the parts...but I guess for the sake of production value, it just wasn't good enough and they had to bring in a professional guitarist and pianist for the recording).

ALL IN ALL:
This is a very underrated film...but it is inspiring, meaningful, and emotionally tugging at times.  It is not a ""groundbreaking"" film, but it does break away from what has become ""the standard teen movie"".  The crafting and development of the story is very mature, as well.  This may be a ""teen movie"", but it has a lot of sustenance for both the young and old...and a way for everyone to bond together.  It's definitely worth a watch, especially if you have a musician in the house.",1408492800,,5130,4.664810690423162

He takes some hard knocks in the film, but shows you that it doesn't matter what others think of you...what matters is what you think of yourself.

3836813,4,B0021L8UT4,"I tend to put movies into one of two categories, ""awesome"" or ""okay"".  ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies fall into the ""awesome"" category.  ""Hanna"" falls into the ""okay"" category.  ""Bandslam"" falls somewhere in the middle.

Will is a pretty typical ""I don't know where I fit in"" movie teenager.  He likes music and gets embarrassed rather easily.  He has a surprisingly close relationship with his mom, which is unusual for Hollywood.  Will falls in love fairly quickly, with a girl named Sa5m (the 5 is silent).  The two of them have some awkward, somewhat funny moments together.  Will's other friend, Charlotte, is a character who is both likeable and annoying.  Charlotte is funny and sweet, but can be overbearing and over-the-top.

The plot is going well until Charlotte's old boyfriend digs into Will's past.  The viewer then has an ""oh ugh"" moment when they realize that the plot can't go on the way it is; awkward embarrassed Will must once again deal with the ploys of school bullies.

For people who like comedy and drama, and movies involving music and bands, this is a somewhere-in-the middle movie that you may enjoy or hate. Either way, I still say that, for me, it falls between ""awesome"" and ""okay"".",1320105600,,1213,4.774038461538462

3836877,5,B0021L8UT4,"High school dramas often get slagged for being full of stereotyped situations and characters. The funny thing is they really aren't stereotypes. They are complete misses.

This movie nails the whole high school experience in a much more realistic way by focusing on a group of kids who have a shared love of music (and when I say music, I'm talking kids who have such eclectic tastes as the Velvet Underground, Cheap Trick, the Pistols right up to the Killers). Throw in the idea of casting actors who can actually play their instruments and sing and this movie is one underrated winner.

Now those of you who might figure having High School Musical's Vanessa Hudgens in it would be a recipe for disaster. Give her a shot as she plays totally against her Disney character in that film to play an intelligent, cool, unaffected bookworm who loves the movie Evil Dead 2 (hey, the scriptwriters know their stuff as anyone with a brain knows how much the sequel ups the ante from the first one).

Throw in another Disney star Aly Michalka as not only another total hottie but one who rocks (check out her singing ""Amphetamine""--guaranteed to blow you away) and this is a movie that defies stereotypes.

The star of the movie though is lead actor Gaelen Connell who plays the teenage loner not by choice but by pure bad luck who blossoms once his love of music is channeled into the right people.

All the bit players are classic, too, from the cello to piano player, to the daycare kids to mom Lisa Kudrow.

The extras are decent with some cool deleted scenes that get the director's commentary, too, as well as a couple of music videos tossed on.

Look, any movie that pays homage to the famous NYC punk dive CBGB (not it's not CBGB's actually, trivia fans) and does it right gets my vote.

Will, a nerdy teen, moves to a new community. He starts to fit in due to a love for music. He begins managing a band and puts it into a band competition. For the most part the movie avoids boring cliches (for example Will doesn't end up joining the band and receiving the accolades). He instead overcomes his unpopularity by using it against those harrassing him. This movie has almost NO bad language. It is appropriate for children (mine loved it) but also great for Adults.

Really harmless way to kill two hours and unlike the promotion done by Summit Entertainment really may flop badly with the High School Musical crowd. Yeah it has the typical teenage sexual innuendo moments, but there's also this very intriguing plotline about being something different both in the characters of Will and Charlotte, and the consequences of such behavior.

3836971,4,B0021L8UT4,"The decision to rent Bandslam this week for a family movie night was based purely on the strength of my awareness of very good reviews last year in the face of Summit Entertainment's marketing controversy.  My wife and I have four kids ranging from 14 to 9 so we try to cover a lot of bases on our movie nights.

The real story here is not that the movie is good (it is), but that the marketing is now famously referred to as possibly the worst for any film in recent memory.  To wit:  here is a movie that would appeal to a typical John Hughes audience (e.g. Farris Bueller's Day Off, etc.), which fell victim to such poor promotion -- from the trailers to the poster and even the title (changed by the studio against the director's wishes) -- that no one ever got close to the theater door.  Worse, when looking to rent it we found it located in the Blockbuster store in the ""Just for Kids"" section between a kiddie cartoon movie and the new Barbie cgi release.

Bandslam is funny, poignant and edgy enough to appeal to everyone in the family, yet, sadly, the marketing campaign spun this film toward a pre-teen High School Musical audience which by release date was as fashionable as highway roadkill.  The film was pulled from theaters before the ink was dry on the posters.

The final verdict:  our kids want to buy both the DVD as well as the very good soundtrack which features the likes of Wilco, Bowie, the Velvet Underground, and Nick Drake -- and my wife and I will happily oblige!",1276646400,9,1492,4.416058394160584

3837111,4,B0021L8UT4,"Having been a professional in the music biz for more than 40 years, I can't help but be ultra critical of rock 'n` roll movies. More often than not, a director with little or no sense of this peculiar world's idiosyncrasies or any interest at all in depicting it accurately offers the audience a ridiculous spectacle that has no connection with reality. Cameron Crowe hit the nail square on the head with his brilliant Almost Famous. With Bandslam, Todd Graf comes close enough to pass muster, while accomplishing a classy, compelling, and thoroughly entertaining film along the way.

Achieving such grounded performances from his youthful cast, it seems obvious that Graf is a director of enormous promise. Lisa Kudrow reaffirms her status as one of Filmdom's most under-appreciated and nuanced actors who invariably keeps in touch with her emotionally truth. The dialog is cool and smart, understated, and the story unravels believably, albeit predictably in its conclusion. These kids are real enough to strum your heartstrings, and colorful enough to keep your interest throughout. The songs are superbly composed and uncompromising; in fact, they even have integrity (this coming from the author of two books on songwriting).

I loved this movie, and I look forward to Todd Graf's next offering. May I recommend my snarky-yet-moving, new novel/mock-memoir Grand Pop?

I walked into BANDSLAM unawares, didn't really know what it was about, and I ended up pleased and tremendously entertained. I guess that's when the taste is sweetest, when you're not expecting too much. BANDSLAM has more in common with NICK & NORAH'S INFINITE PLAYLIST than it does with HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL.

Gaelan Connell, I haven't seen him before, but he seems a natural at playing the nervous, ill-fitting-in, fumbly role and, somewhere, a threatened Michael Cera has to be biting his fingernails. This kid is also glib enough that he even reminds me of vintage young John Cusack. Connell plays iPod-attached misfit Will Burton who is newly moved to Lodi, New Jersey, and he's actually glad to be in the Garden State, so you get an idea of how miserable his past existence must have been. He now attends Van Buren High School, where he learns that the biggest event is the Bandslam, this annual Tri-State Battle of the Bands (winner gets a record deal).

Will loves Indie rock; he regularly writes to David Bowie in this thoroughly one-way correspondence relationship. Will also happens to be a walking encyclopedia of rock & roll knowledge, and this may or may not have something to do with his being befriended by the very cool and popular ex-cheerleader Charlotte (Aly Michalka, of the pop duo Aly & AJ). Charlotte fronts a lowly garage band, and she dreams of competing on Bandslam, although her band would have to contend with her school's own juggernaut rock group, Ben Wheatly & the Glory Dogs (Ben Wheatly, by the way, is Charlotte's ex). Will, thru no fault of his own, becomes the manager of Charlotte's tiny band. Juuuust a bit out of his depth, he's got eight weeks to get good at this gig before the big Battle of the Bands swings around. For Will Burton, it's time to come out of his shell.

Will also meets Sa5m (Hudgens, branching out from sweetness and light). Sa5m - the ""5"" is silent - is quirky and brooding and talks a bit like MTV's Daria. Sa5m also has a secret. She and Will become partners in a classroom project, and one of my four best moments in the movie has to do with Will's part of the project. The other three moments? They're all musical numbers and performed by Will and Charlotte's band.

BANDSLAM is a coming-of-age movie and it isn't vanilla or moronic, and you could've knocked me over with a feather when I later realized this was a PG-rated film. But, yeah, looking back, I don't remember any profanity. Or gross-out content or mean-spiritedness for its own sake. Instead there's an emotional weight, a passion for music and an edginess and tons of smart screenplay. There's even possibly the most awkward first kiss in history. There isn't a bad performance, only varying shades of very good and terrific. It helps that there's a complexity to the characters. Gaelan Connell, endlessly relatable, easily carries the film. Aly Michalka comes in and blows me away, and I love that there are different sides to her unpredictable character, and a bite. And she has pipes, stronger than Vanessa Hudgens'. It's hard not to rock out to her rendition of Steve Wynn's ""Amphetamine."" Meanwhile, Vanessa Hudgens steps a bit out of her comfort zone, and I liked it. I didn't think Hudgens and emo would work, and yet it does.

And Lisa Kudrow is Lisa Kudrow, and that's always a good thing for the movie audience.

It wouldn't have worked so well if the music hadn't been so great. The actors sing the songs and play the instruments, and is it me or does that bass player remind you of a young Stephen King? I love that the little garage band develops its own sound, and ""I Can't Go On, I'll Go On"" is an absolutely inspired name for a rock band. Cameron Crowe will probably appreciate ""I Can't Go On, I'll Go On."" John Hughes probably would have liked this movie. I always like it when the nerd makes good.

DVD Special Features: the ""Making Of"" documentary (21 minutes long); commentary track with Director Todd Graff and actors Aly Michalka, Vanessa Hudgens and, showing up late (he was at the beach), Gaelan Connell; nine deleted scenes with optional director's intro (including Aly Michalka's brief acoustic version of ""Amphetamine,"" the full rendition of Charlotte's ex-boyfriend serenading her with ""Pretend,"" and the cute ""Shredding"" scene); Honor Society's music video ""Where Are You Now""; and Vanessa Hudgens performing ""Everything I Own"" with the band.",1269475200,31,4617,4.7565543071161045
3837197,4,B0021L8UT4,"Teenager Will Burton lives in his head, and his head is filled with music. When his mother, Karen Burton, gets a new job in New Jersey, Will starts his junior year at a new school only to find the old cliques still apply, but rock-n-roll rules the scene. Perpetually a misfit, Will strikes up a friendship with like-minded outsider Sa5m.  They are both surprised when the school's ""it"" girl, Charlotte recruits Will to help assemble a band to compete in ""Bandslam,"" a battle of the bands that is Texas High School Football Big."" Charlotte's ex-boyfriend Ben Wheatly is poised to win with his band Glory Dogs - Springsteen wannabes down to their hats. It's good to see a movie that while not setting it's sights very high, gives proper rounded characters.  The story is predictable, it's very clichd, and in places corny. The plot also has a number of plot holes in it. But despite all this, it is very enjoyable, and very well done.",1269388800,3,932,4.642424242424243
3837198,1,B0021L8UT4,"I really must have misses something in torturing myself with this film. I just don't get why more and more movies are being produced with characters that deliver dialogue that makes absolutely no sense. This movie is just chock full of mental patients that really should be locked up for their own protection and the protection of others. And it frightens me to think of the viewers who enjoyed it.
Someone please get script writers into rehab, cause they surely need to get clean and sober.",1268956800,2,491,4.72093023255814
3837199,4,B0021L8UT4,"There are great movies out there that become classics. There are movies out there that stink to high Heaven. There are art films that most people just don't get. And then there are movies that are nothing more than a load of fun. Such is the case with BANDSLAM.

BANDSLAM tells the tale of Will Burton (Gaelan Connell), a withdrawn teen in Cincinnati who can't stand his high school. Not part of any crowd he's pleased as can be when his mom (Lisa Kudrow) decides to quit her job and move the two of them to New Jersey where her sister has found her new work.

Will's love of music should make him a shoe in with the new kids but alas, such is not the case. Instead he discovers that the same cliques roam the halls of the new school just like the old. With one exception. Rather than high school sports being the main event, this school is pumped up for something called Bandslam.

At lunch one day a student takes the stage and introduces the local heroes, a band called Ben Wheatley and the Glory Dogs. As they begin to play, Will looks towards the stage and notices a girl sitting at his table named Sa5m (the 5 is silent) played by Vanessa Hudgens. When he asks her how big this Bandslam is here she tells him ""as big as Texas football"".

In class, Will and Sa5m are partnered up in an exercise the teacher has put together where two students get to know each other and then tell the rest of the class who that other person is. They can use everything from visual aids like slides or film to poetry. These two different individuals don't start well but eventually grow on one another.

At the same time Will catches the eye of Charlotte (Alyson Michalka). She snags Will into helping her sit the kids in a pre-schoolers class and then hooks his Ipod into the sound system. When Will tells her that his dad is a side musician who played with The Who, she invites him to hear her band at practice.

Will accepts, attracted to Charlotte who he obviously has no chance with. After hearing the band he tells them his opinions of how they sound and act. Hoping to improve themselves with Will's help in an attempt to take out the Glory Dogs (of which these were the original members till Ben kicked them all out), they follow his suggestions and add to the group. With a little work and perseverance, they begin to look like they have a chance to be the second band representing their high school at Bandslam.

Along the way Will and Charlotte become close friends. But Sa5m has warned Will from the start, girls like her are just trouble. While their friendship grows, Will and Sa5m become close as well, more along the couple type line.

A few mistakes in how to deal with friends, girlfriends, moms and more round out the story. Toss in Charlotte's being Ben's ex girlfriend that he wants to get back with and you have the makings for teen angst in a nutshell. Will Charlotte stay with the band? What is Charlotte's big secret? Will Will unite this rag tag group into a band? Will the band discover Will's misrepresentation of himself? And what about Will and Sa5m?  All is answered before the final moments of the film.

What makes this movie fun is the joy of music that is observed by all. While these kids talk a good talk about loving independent music like the early Ramones, etc., their sound doesn't come close to resembling it. But it doesn't matter. They have a youthful enthusiasm and it shows. And actually a ska rendition of the classic Bread song ""Everything I Own"" turns out to be pretty good.

Most people will toss this movie into the category of the HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL films. But it seemed to me to be less Disney and more John Hughes, kind of a combination of the two. The film does call for a healthy dose of suspension of belief, but it doesn't matter. Why? Because it's fun!

I've always thought that movies should be entertaining before anything else. This film offers that. Will it be one that folks will reference when talking about cinema? No way. Will it be one that people will remember forever? Nope. Will it offer a nice easy evening of entertainment? Definitely.

A decent (though unbelievable) story, a good looking cast, pretty good acting and some fairly good music make this a movie you can enjoy and the kids can watch as well. Give yourself a break, bypass the blood and guts or high art for one night and have some fun with BANDSLAM.",1268870400,,4374,4.4456928838951315
3837200,5,B0021L8UT4,"I saw this film last Summer not expecting much but  was pleasantly surprised-it was pretty good! Sure it is chocked full of teen movie cliches like Vanessa Hudgens' social outcast character, Sa5m; Gaelan Connell's dorky character Will; Alyson Michalka as the cliquey popular girl Charlotte and Scott Porter as the jockhead who hates geeks and dorks and anyone who tries to make a move on his girlfriend, Charlotte. Somehow director Todd Graff has managed to take all these been-there-done-that, seen it all before elements and turned it into a very entertaining musical film. The film moves along at a nice pace and the musical scenes are very well done especially when Will decides to add more instruments to the band that he's organized to try to win the local Battle of the Bands competition. I also
like their ska version of Bread's 1973 hit ""Everyting I Own"". Even the closing credits were entertaining as the band
led by Sa5m on electric guitar play throughout. A very polished production that was made for about $20 million and should have been a sleeper hit for Summit Entertainment last Summer but failed at the boxoffice due to poor marketing that relied too much on Hudgens' connection to the Disney High School Musical franchise and it looks like the Blu-ray in the U.S has been cancelled(but will be available in the U.K. I'm not sure if it will be region free or not.).Buy the DVD
if you live in the U.S. and hope and pray that a Blu-ray version will come out eventually.",1267833600,,1485,4.7335907335907335

What had to be a low budget film turned out to be a very well thought out , methodical movie .It was played very nicely with the very young cast who have shown that there is another side to them than being just another Disney brat. It was way to bad this movie never got the hype it deserved. People should buy the movie or rent , they will then know what they missed out on at the big screen.",1264464000,6,456,3.967391304347826
3837202,5,B0021L8UT4,I went to see this movie in order to be able to see the new moon trailer that was being released with it. I was planning on seeing the trailer and then suffering through some terrible movie because I had already paid for a ticket. I was pleasantly surprised to find it was a wonderful movie. I am really glad the new moon trailer showed before it because had it not I wouldn't have given the movie a second thought and would have missed one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. I will be buying this when it comes out on dvd.,1262563200,6,535,4.009345794392523
3837203,5,B0021L8UT4,"I seriously was hoping that this movie was going to be out on DVD for the holidays.  Really this little gem of a movie got so overlooked and lost in the end of summer shuffle.  Its greatest claim to fame is probably that you got your first glimpse of the Meet Jacob Black trailer for New Moon in the previews but that shouldn't be all it is known for.

I saw this with my two daughters and I seriously can say this was one of the best movies I had seen in a very long time.  What a positive, uplifting message this movie provided in a way that wasn't preachy or dorky to kids.  Good music, acting and storyline, no trash - which is such a refreshing concept for today's movies that are marketed to tweens and teens.  I love the whole way it was filmed, it was just new and fun.

I would love to be able to watch it again and hope that it comes out on DVD soon!  If you haven't seen this movie and are considering it when it does become available, don't hesitate.  You won't be sorry. It is a feel good movie with a positive message that parents and their children can watch together with no worries or reservations.",1258934400,12,1115,4.148837209302326
