8096159,4,B000C731OS,Not a top notch package it was broken :\ but luckily the dvd was just fine. The production is not up to date but that's just fine with me.,1309219200,,138,3.793103448275862
8096160,5,B000C731OS,"If you are interested in training in Systema, this is a must have DVD. It covers the basics, some of which is no longer taught. I would consider this the closest thing to a Systema 101 seminar that is out there.

Excellent.",1238976000,,223,4.309523809523809
8096161,5,B000C731OS,I could not believe that this mailed so fast.  The condition of the merchandise was exactly as stated and in excellent condition.,1211068800,,129,4.863636363636363
8096162,5,B000C731OS,"If you want to combine relaxed movement with devastating effictiveness, then Systema is for you you. This dvd covers many of teh unique and logical drills that Systema uses to teach relaxed and continuous movement during and before an attack. The drills can be incorporated into any martial arts training program, but they may very well change you for the better, so be careful if you think you know everything there is to know.

If nothing else, Valdimir Vasiliev's approach to partner work is refreshingly simple, clear and something you can start working on today at home with a friend or by yourself.

The quality of this dvd is also top notch. THis is a must have for serious students of movement.",1156550400,4,702,4.745901639344262
8096163,5,B000C731OS,"I really like this disk. For background, I have been studying Tae Kwon Do with Grandmast Yun S. Ko in Columbus Indiana for over 12 years. I also studied Wing Tsung with Sifu Todd Wright here in Columbus In for three years. I have worked out informally in Tai Chi. I only mention this to let you know that I'm not a martial arts 'snob'.

This disk has good production, it's not the ""A"" stuff from Hollywood, but it is very viewable. Critical sequences are displayed mulitple times from different angles.

Vasiliev's descriptions are clear and to the point.

This 'system' is not for everyone, but I recommend the disk if you are a) looking to broaden your exposure to martial arts, b) looking for ideas on how to expand your work-outs or c) interested in exposure to techniques you might not otherwise see.

This disk covers an introduction. Do not buy this if you think you are going to become a 'master' at native Russian Martial Arts.",1141516800,6,936,4.553571428571429
