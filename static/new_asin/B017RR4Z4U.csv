7513371,2,B017RR4Z4U,"A violent home invasion robbery turns into a game of cat and mouse, as a woman and stepson evade capture.  The twist is the place is rigged with a high tech camera security system.  The invaders are unaware their every move is being watched and guidance is being given to the woman and child.  The uncharacteristic violent nature of the robbers sacrifices realism.  Robbers rob and get out ASAP!  Don't they?",1454630400,,408,4.690140845070423

7513373,5,B017RR4Z4U,"Amazing!!!!  If u give this movie under 5 stars, u are ridiculously high maintenance and DO NOT love movies.  This is a thriller from behinning to end. Movie critics aggravate the crap out of me. Always something to complain about. Cant u just enjoy a well made movie??  2 thumbs up.....awesome!!!!  If u didn't like this movie, than stop watching movies and go watch nothing but romantic comedies.",1454371200,3,398,4.8088235294117645
7513374,2,B017RR4Z4U,"Home Invasion is a direct-to-video psychological thriller starring Natasha Henstridge, Jason Patric, and Scott Adkins. When a wealthy woman and her stepson living in a remote mansion are targeted by a trio of expert thieves, the only form of help comes from a call with a security systems specialist. As the intruders become increasingly hostile and the connection wavers, the likelihood of rescue diminishes.

This type of plot has been used quite a bit in films, including A Clockwork Orange, Panic Room, Straw Dogs, and The Strangers. Home Invasion follows the formula, adding the gimmick of an outside person attempting to help a homes occupants. What makes it gripping is that there have been a number of home invasions, often with deadly consequences, reported in the news. Viewers can identify more with this realistic kind of terror than with the kind of terror created in pictures featuring monsters or the supernatural.

Because of the films tame PG-13 rating, things never get really intense, although director David Tenant does manage some nicely crafted suspenseful sequences. Ms. Henstridge, who has carved out a niche for herself in the horror and sci-fi genres, does an effective job of looking terrified while trying desperately to follow the instructions of the security worker on the phone as grim circumstances escalate.

The three cold-blooded masked thieves are creepy in appearance and make clear that they mean business. Evidence of their lethal nature is shown almost as soon as they approach the house, setting us up for a frightening ride ahead.

There are no bonus features on the DVD release.",1454112000,14,1621,5.152091254752852

But as the intruders become increasingly hostile and the connection wavers. Well overall I really did like this, my pet peeve has to be the whole stepmom and stepson dynamic, BORING! The performances otherwise are all very good but let me say this, I was most impressed by Scott Adkins, finally he gets in a real movie with some meat to the part and he comes through bigtime. The other 2 standouts were his 2 male accomplices, the safe cracker and the shooter on the road. They were excellent, too. The lady bad guy? Way overdone. Jason Patric, his part was odd, he has a family but stays at work, why? never find out. Natasha and her ""son"" finally get it together and pull it out. The story is very good and so is the direction and support.",1480204800,3,920,4.385964912280702

7513388,4,B017RR4Z4U,Very intense!  Would still like to know what was in the safe. Great action and acting throughout.  Also it shows how greed comes between the criminals themselves.  They were second guessing their loyalties to each other when their plans fell apart.,1472860800,,248,5.0

7513391,2,B017RR4Z4U,"I love a good home invasion movie because it's such a scary concept, with the fun twist potential of the invadee's using home court advantage to turn the tables....but this was just awful.  The acting was just embarrassing (for actors who have been around as long as Natasha and Jason)....and the plot boring. No twists or turns and poor character development.  Skip this one....watch Hush or Kristy instead.",1465603200,,408,4.985294117647059

7513393,2,B017RR4Z4U,"Really silly movie where lots of opportunities to get away have to be inexplicably ignored to make the plot work. The story drags to a crawl after the first half hour as we wait for the inevitable ending.

7513419,2,B017RR4Z4U,"The movie was hit and miss for me.  The underlying mystery was pretty good but the overall execution (i.e., writing and acting) was sub-par.  The whole thing felt like it was written to a be a TV Movie of the Week or something for Lifetime.  Plot holes, a villain that was over the top and a mother and child who became Jason Borne.  And what about Jason Patric?  I hardly recognized him.  The actor and beauty from Lost Boys and Speed II is gone.  In his place is a guy who looks more and more like his father and famous grand-father every day.  There have been a number of Home Invasion type movies recently and this is not one of the better ones.",1461196800,,649,4.219512195121951

7513499,3,B017RR4Z4U,"Canadian production with a Bollywood producer.

Writing is way weak. Implausible and unrealistic. Very low on the suspense scale.

Felt like a MADE-for-TV movie with a little uptick of violence, but really not that much.  Would rent for a slow night when there is not thing else to watch. Probably not one to own.",1456704000,5,313,4.7592592592592595
7513500,4,B017RR4Z4U,"Home Invasion isn't anything special but it's all right if thrillers are your thing. Natasha Henstridge looks amazing. Yeah she gained weight but her boobs got bigger, too, so that's a plus. There's holes in the plot, a husband we never see and Mike the security guy's troubles are never explained. (He is seen with a pill bottle and a case of the shakes.)

The bad guys are pretty good. One of them is even sympathetic with the victims. So, he is just a thief and not a killer. Home Invasion is worth a look.",1456617600,,509,4.3578947368421055

Only she waits until the very end of the movie to FINALLY go get it and then, when she DOES shoot the bad guy, she breaks down as if ""Oh My Gosh, I shot a bad guy!"" Not only that, but before they revealed that there WAS a gun in the house, she had THREE opportunities in which she could have taken the bad guy's guns and used them to protect herself and her kid. But no... at every turn, she forgoes ""violence"", instead relying in some stranger hundreds of miles away to save her. I would rather pay $20 to see a 5 minute long movie where the hero/heroine puts an end to the bad guys at the first chance s/he gets and be done with it than to spend a single cent on this social propaganda bull.",1528070400,,870,4.034682080924855

8740203,5,B017RR4Z4U,Gives you an idea of what it would be like to go thru a home invasion if you were lucky enough to have time to think and react.  Even with expensive security system it is not perfect and gives you ideas to think about when having it installed.  I would definitely want a safe room with extra reinforced walls and back up power with a hidden escape route away from the home so you end up out away from the house while they are still in it.  Backup locations with weapons where only you can get to them but only if no children in the house and when they would be locked up safe where they can not get to the weapons.,1509753600,,614,4.016393442622951

Spoiler alert ..what was in the safe? Why didn't the mother and the security expert meet at the end? Why not find out what was in the safe..money no doubt ..and use it to pay off her bills? Why not show the family relaxing on the beach somewhere at the end? The end of the film really left many plot points in the air. I wanted more.
