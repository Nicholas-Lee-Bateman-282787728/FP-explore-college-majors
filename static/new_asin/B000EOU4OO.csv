8112381,4,B000EOU4OO,"I love Mexican cinema. Saw this film years ago and realized how familiar the plot line was so I bought it and showed it to a group of Mexican and Chicana literary friends. They concurred that this is an unacknowledged ranchera version of ""The Importance of Being Earnest."" I have researched ""Me he de comer esa tuna"" in Spanish and English language film databases and can find no reference to Oscar Wilde's play. Therefore I consider this discovery to be my contribution to Mexican cinema. Que viva Mxico!",1383609600,2,505,4.75
8112382,5,B000EOU4OO,"This is one of those old movies that make us wonder why today's cinematography believes that only violence and sex are THE KEY to success ... Old movies prove otherwise !
Comedy, drama, music... Funny and entertaining ! A must have for any Old Movie Lover!",1363737600,3,256,4.586956521739131
8112383,4,B000EOU4OO,"I ejoyed this Mexican romance movie. Even though the plot is uncomplicated, is funny and wholesome. No filthy innuendoes,which nowadays just about all movies have.",1268352000,,163,5.56
