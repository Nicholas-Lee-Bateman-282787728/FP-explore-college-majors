8384150,5,B002YD8FXA,This guy is a total psycho. It was like watching a combination of Monty Python and the Twilight Zone. Every time his head popped up you had no clue which way it was going to go. Fleshpainter totally spooks me out with his multiple characters. (I lost count) I want to be just like him when I grow up.,1269993600,2,300,4.101694915254237
8384151,1,B002YD8FXA,"If you want to see some actual body painting done then this isn't what you're looking for.  Pitiful production and poor quality acting ... and you ask ""why is there acting in a body painting film?""  Good question.  There shouldn't be.  This guy enjoyed seeing his lame face and hearing his own annoying voice more than showing anyone anything about body painting.",1266710400,7,363,4.806451612903226
