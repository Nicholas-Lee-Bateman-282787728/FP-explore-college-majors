8420240,5,B004AH3LVO,"This DVD shot shortly before Ross's death is a treasure.  Not only are his insights in the music played by two of his students (Bach's Cromatic Fantasia and Fugue and The Bb Major Partita) true revelations, but watching Ross and hearing him play is a pleasure as well as a lesson in musical integrity and discernment.
I recommend this DVD with utmost vigor.",1352764800,4,357,4.666666666666667
