1076963,5,6305812802,"To any anime fans out there that have seen the entire Cowboy Bebop series  and were greatly disappointed w/ how the series progressed and subsequently  ended (i.e. me) Trigun does exactly the opposite. Well, not exactly, but I  had really high expectations before seeing the Trigun series, and was a  little disappointed w/ the lack of action and the mainly comic plots of the  first 7 episodes or so. But Trigun just keeps getting stronger and stronger  and much more interesting. I never read the manga, but the anime series (as  it goes on) is very unpredictable, the background behind Vash the Stampede  is totally out there, and the action just gets cooler and cooler as the  series progresses. The last 2 episodes just were AWESOME. I highly  recommend getting the DVDs, Pioneer did a terrific job... well whoever  Pioneer got the DVDs from, and the menus and features are superb.",968284800,4,886,4.801324503311259
1076964,5,6305812802,"Trigun continues to entertain and Pioneer continues to deliver the highest  quality product.  This DVD shines with thoughtfully designed chapters  (which allow you to jump past the intros, intermissions, and credits  straight to the content) and the highest quality video and sound.  The  picture is crisp, with the deep reds and blues that were clearly intended  for its presentation.
In this particular series, after wrapping up the  cliffhanger (literally) from the end of Volume 2, a new character foil is  introduced in the chronicle of Vash the Stampede.  Wolfwood, whose history  is only hinted at, develops a comraderie with Vash that yields mutual  curiousity and occasional sparks between the two.  Overall, you'll be left  with the traditional Trigun feel - tough times, mostly nobody got hurt, and  hidden internal turmoil on the part of Vash.  More clues are dropped about  his origins...and more allusions to a love interest...
Thumbs up!",965174400,8,952,5.24
1076965,3,6305812802,"First, let me say i'm still very happy about the direction of the story.  Episode 8 (starts the disc) is the conclusion of a two part story that I  found... dull. However, hot on it's heels is the appearance of Reverand  Wolfwood, as strange a character as Vash as ever been. Both Murder Machine  (episode 9) and Quick Draw (episode 10) are interesting, exciting and  contenue to explore the characters and their motivations. I'm really  looking forward to the rest of the series!",964569600,2,480,4.72289156626506
1077015,5,6305812802,"The incredibly accurate gunman/priest is a walking contradiction. A man of peace and a man of war. He's great. He speaks to the world of contradictions we live in. His less talk, more action style counters Vash's overly vocal character nicely.
This DVD was a lot of fun. More firepower. The Josei-tachi girls are as entertaining as ever!
Love and PEACE!",1014422400,,353,4.80327868852459
1077016,5,6305812802,"I'll be frank. I love Wolfwood. I adore him. I worship him. I want to elope with him, but that is of course not actually possible. Watching Wolfwood and Vash interact, though, is such a joy - it brings such a fresh air to the series. The characters play off each other perfectly, laughing like total morons when they first meet, but buckling down and getting serious when it comes to rescuing a lost child. Oh yeah, and the volume starts with the conclusion to the Brilliant Dynamites Neon story. I like Neon, although he's a total weirdo, and I think the episode gives him a very satisfactory role. ^_^",1005436800,,603,4.490909090909091
1077017,5,6305812802,"I just finished watching this entire series, so I speak from experience when I say that this is one of the absolute best anime series out there right now.  The first few episodes seem rather light hearted and shallow, but as the series progresses, and you see more into Vash, the Stampede's character, it becomes incredible, addictive, and emotionally intense. I was barely able to watch many episodes without crying.  Yes, it's that good.  I HIGHLY recomend checking this series out.  It's phenomenal.",990921600,,502,5.0120481927710845

1077019,5,6305812802,"This is one of my favorites.
Basically this DVD introduces you to the character of Wolfwood the Priest.  Vash meets a rather jovial priest in his travels, but of course nothing is as it seems.  The first episode on this DVD, however, is the conclusion of the two-part series that began on ""Lost Past"".
This is probably the last of the DVDs that is totally devoted to slapstick comedy.  The rest of the series has comedy in it, but just not as much.  But the story makes up for that at least ^_^.
Unforunately the DVDs still don't include very many extras.  Just a few weapon designs in this one I think.  Pioneer should have followed Bandai's lead.  Cowboy Bebop had a bunch of great interviews/music videos/etc.",987897600,,712,4.559055118110236
1077020,5,6305812802,"If this series were any better than it already is...well, it can't be!  This is one of the most intense, funniest, wittiest, clever, and somewhat original series I have ever seen!  It has an extremely catchy soundtrack and you'll have all the tunes stuck in your head for weeks.  The new character introduced in this DVD, Nicholas D. Wolfwood, is a well-conceived, well-designed, good humored, likeable character, just as Vash is.  He is a priest who obviously has some past he (like Vash) is trying to atone for, but I won't go any farther than that.  More adventure, laughs, mystery, drama, and good times await you in this next DVD of Trigun! DON'T MISS OUT!!!!",982540800,3,664,4.739130434782608
1077021,5,6305812802,"If you're not sure about getting Trigun, get it. If you've never even seen any Anime series, get it. This is one of the best and most worth-while series ever produced. The characters are great, Wolfwood is the man (a gunslinging priest can only be good), and the story is engaging. Don't wait until everyone goes through that ""Trigun is so trendy now"" phrase. Just go out and get it.",970012800,,383,4.485714285714286

7895179,5,6305812802,"trigun is awesome.  i wish i had found this series earlier.  vash is the coolest hero!  he's so silly, lol!",1220745600,,107,4.25
7895180,5,6305812802,"This is by far the best installment of Trigun so far; a real treat!

The first episode picks up where the last one left off, as Vash must fight to save a hijacked vessel headed straight for a canyon. This is a pivotal episode, for two reasons: 1) we discover that Vash is not freakishly immortal, as he appeared to be in previous episodes - you will actually be worried this time ; 2) we dive into Vash's past once again, as his reasons for never killing and the haunting silhouette of a woman become more defined.

The second episode marks the appearance of one of the most stylish characters ever: Dr. Nicholas D. Wolfwood, a very unconventional priest who carries around a portable confessional (lol) and one of the coolest weapons I have ever seen. He is Vash's match in every way: class, style, wit, charm and even marksmanship and occasional silliness. He is the only character so far to have any real chemistry with Vash, and together they create some amazing scenes, with a balance of comradeship, friendly antagonism and understanding. There is an absolutely beautiful scene in which Vash, seeing Wolfwood perform an act of kindness, smiles sweetly, and Wolfwood remarks: ""So you can smile like that, too. It had me worried. You're always smiling, real friendly, but your smile is so empty it hurts to watch it. You're hurting like crazy and you're hiding it behind that grin.""

The third episode gives you a very funny, pseudo-zen glimpse of Vash's everyday routine (you get to see him witout the red coat for the first time), and some more Vash-Wolfwood improvised collaboration. It's impossible not to love those two.

It's definetely darker than before, but it's a change for the better, as the viewer gets more engrossed in the series. And for all the added suspense and drama, there's still enough slapstick to make you laugh out loud. Trigun finds its balance with this volume. That's it, I'm hooked!",1100131200,2,1916,4.7620481927710845
7895181,5,6305812802,"Once again Vash the Stampede is thrown into situations that he'd rather not be in in his quest for love and peace. This volume though introduces the character of Wolfwood, a man who becomes a major player later in the series.

And Between the Wasteland and the Sky- Concludes the two part series of Vash's adventures on the runaway sand train. He again has to decide between killing and the personal ideals he seems to have set up.

Murder Machine- Nicholas D. Wolfwood is introduced in this episode. A cross toting, chain smoking, child loving priest who can't stand to see a child suffer and is amazingly good with a gun. Vash and Wolfwood team up to save some lost children from killer spider robots. This episode also raises some more questions about Vash as he somehow seems to shoot several robots without a gun.

Quick Draw- Vash and Wolfwood get entered in a quick draw contest and must draw against each other to prevent the death of a young mother. The beginning sequence is one of the funniest in the series as Vash proceeds to get his day underway and the events therein.

This is one of the best disks in the series as it's before the action gets more serious and still has some of the same light hearted tone as Vash and Wolfwood bicker back and forth and Wolfwood flirts with Milly. This was the first disk I ever watched and what got me hooked on the series.",1099008000,2,1374,4.46215139442231
7895182,5,6305812802,"In this 3-episode DVD, the world is introduced to Nicholas D. Wolfwood, a cross-totin', cigarette-smokin', fast-talkin'...priest? Believe it or not, Wolfwood is a priest, and is good-hearted, trying to save orphans and such. When Vash and Wolfwood sink in quicksand, we first see Wolf's abilities with the gun - he actually told Vash he never shot one (clearly a lie). When they enter a quick-draw contest in Episode 10 to save a family, Vash and Wolf end up facing each other, but instead, they rescue the family from the sharpshooters, who were held at gunpoint. This is a pivotal episode in that this is the first time Wolfwood breaks out the cross - actually a huge carrying case for his guns - and is a must-see for any anime fan. Although Episode 8 finishes up with the hijacked sandship, all episodes are absolutely amazing. Trigun has the perfect combination of wacky humor and firearm action. A must buy, in my opinion.",1064448000,,928,4.770186335403727
7895183,3,6305812802,"Along with volume 1, this is my least favorite of the collections.  ""Quick Draw"" and ""Murder Machine"" are lightweight romps, entertaining but less interesting than what is to come.  This volumw is mostly noteworthy for the introduction of one of the series' most popular characters: gun-slinging priest, Nicholas V. Wolfwood.  Entertaining and humorous, with some good charcter interplay.",1056758400,2,388,5.655172413793103

7895185,4,6305812802,"So far the whole Trigun series is great. Not a lot of fighting, gun play, no course language,and no sex. This is a great series for young and old. If you love good amine then get this series!",1036108800,3,191,4.052631578947368
