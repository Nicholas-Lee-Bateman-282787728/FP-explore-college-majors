8689124,4,B00PT663VK,"I caught this handsomely produced, eminently British, drawing room melodrama the other day on the Retro channel and enjoyed it very much. Very Deborah Kerr-like (especially an uncannily similar voice), Anna Neagle is a revelation playing four roles, the same woman, more or less, in different eras of history to show the evolving social attitudes. Women, by the way, whose modern ideas don't sit well with the regressive husbands. Anna looks so fetching in all the varying historical garbs, especially the gossamer late Forties Dioresque gowns. In addition we get as an added bonus of  Anna singing a vintage song (Loves Old Sweet Song).

I confess I liked the New Years Eve celebration scene best of all where Neagle plays the 1920s style party girl, the most extreme version of the independent women she portrays in the four vignettes, a nice change of pace from the other, however noble-minded, but almost too admirable, socially conscious ladies.

The early color production values hold up exceptionally well, and BTW was this idea based on a play? It seems perfect for the medium of the theatre and a plum role for a good stage actress.

Perhaps the films true value is its time capsule-like glimpse into the past, with its clipped, upper-class accents and old boy rituals spanning several generations. Since this was a British production it carries quite a bit of weight for historical verisimilitude.

But most of all this is Annas show and she carries it off beautifully. This movie was my introduction to Anna Neagle, and Id love to see the two films she did with Errol Flynn during his Britain years in the 1950s.",1467936000,,1623,4.887272727272728
