5392318,5,B00A7GWGLS,"When Digimon Adventure 2 premiered on Fox Kids, at first I didn't know who the Digimon Emperor really was and who the later villains were. When I watched episode 17 (Ghost of a Chance) at Aunt Seda's house back in 2000, and I heard Wizardmon's warning regarding saving the Digital World, it became clear that Myotismon-possessed Yukio Oikawa was the ultimate mastermind of all chaos in the Digital World and that Myotismon was the final villain of Digimon Adventure 2.

Digimon Adventure 2 is basically a continuation of Digimon Adventure, but this time, six of the children from Digimon Adventure (Izzy, Joe, Matt, Mimi, Sora, and Tai) have enrolled in high school. TK and Kari have grown up to be big kids (TK is finally able to stop acting like a crybaby and he now acts very mature, while Kari was able to overcome the illness she had one day and grow to be a charming, smiley girl), and they are accompanied by four kids (Davis, Cody, Ken, and Yolei).

Compared to Digimon Adventure, Digimon Adventure 2 introduces a combination of both evil Digimon (Arukenimon, Mummymon, MaloMyotismon) and evil human beings (Digimon Emperor [=Ken], Myotismon-possessed Yukio Oikawa).

The Digimon Emperor has to be my favorite human villain of Digimon Adventure 2 and one of my top ten fictional tyrants (Napoleon the Pig is another one of my favorite fictional tyrant). He rules the Digital World with an iron fist, using Dark Rings and Spirals so as to treat Digimon as his slaves, and any Digimon that oppose him are locked up in prison. These methods of totalitarian control over the Digital World are enough for the Digimon Emperor to be considered as evil and ruthless as Nero and Ivan the Terrible.

When Arukenimon and Mummymon create BlackWarGreymon from 100 control spires, the children realize that defeating BlackWarGreymon is a tall task, since BWG is a Mega, and Paildramon is an Ultimate. But in Episode 37, the DNA Digivolved forms of ExVeemon, Stingmon, Aquilamon, Gatomon, Ankylomon, and Angemon are all able to inflict damage to BlackWarGreymon and then Azulongmon successfully convinces BWG not to destroy the last remaining Destiny Stone.

The last episode of this season had a very happy ending. After destroying MaloMyostismon and freeing Oikawa of all his malice, the DigiDestined of Digimon Adventure become parents and raise adorable little children",1411603200,,2366,5.025510204081633

5392323,5,B00A7GWGLS,"I had actually never watched Digimon before. I only bought to be signed by the voice actor of The Digimon Emperor/Ken Ichijouji. I watch the Tsubasa Abridged series alot and the Digimon Emperor is in a few episodes. The episodes he's in are absolutely hilarious, so even though it was
an abridged series of a totally different anime, I thought it be nice to have the actual Digimon Emperors VA to sign it. I have two friends who love the series and told me to watch it; when it finally came in, I thought bought it, might aswell watch it. I can see why friends like it. It's a pretty good series that made me laugh quite a bit. The DVD box it came in is really nice and so are the disks. Great, likeable characters and a cute and funny series overall. The only thing that bugged was the ""Digimon Energize!"" to the piont I started fast-forwarding it everytime they did it. I give it two thumbs up and may buy the other seasons now.",1407715200,,930,4.2897727272727275

5392329,5,B00A7GWGLS,"First of all I have to say I was hooked on digimon since the first episode back in the summer of 1999 and was waiting for years and years for it to come out on dvd. Considering the size of the season the price you can get it for is certainly worth it. Lack of features while disappointing is mitigated by the beautiful packaging with the character guide and eight discs that are label with a digidestined and digimon as well as all the episodes on it.

While 02 is enjoyable continuing the story from the Digimon adventure or 01 giving us new digimon and new digidestined. It lacks one of the core themes from its predecessor about finding your inner virture and thus the middle of the season for the most part seems unfocused and the plot just kind of meanders along with a Frankstein's monster villain in Black-Wargreymon that falls short. The digimon emperor arc though is some of the best in all of digimon and the episodes set in the real world where the older digidestined appear prominently are really enjoyable even though the season then ends rather abruptly leaving many loose ends while also trying to tie up stuff with the infamous epilogue.

For digimon fans who have waited over a decade it certainly worth having an appreciated its done well and at a reasonable price. For possible purchasers I can tell you have gotten my kids and several of their friends to share my joy of digimon. It would best to start with the first season but since after 02 digimon takes on the characteristic of power rangers where one season contains its own story so that the next seasons are only connected story wise to themselves. Digimon 02 is still a very fun story on the whole and nice to see T.K. and Kari and advance the story of the Odaiba digidestined",1400716800,,1755,4.515723270440252

5392344,5,B00A7GWGLS,"Unlike other seasons of Digimon, this is a direct continuation of the first season. Not only do you get to catch up with the old cast, you meet a new cast who has to deal with their own problems as well. Surprisingly enough, this season turns out much more mature than most kids would really understand or expect.",1389830400,,313,4.413793103448276
5392345,5,B00A7GWGLS,"I LOVE DIGIMON ADVENTURES! It was one of the best parts of my childhood, and I am glad I bought the DVDs!",1388707200,,105,3.8181818181818183
5392346,5,B00A7GWGLS,"As a child, I have been particularly keen on Digimon Adventure 02 and it this feeling of nostalgia that urged me to watch the series again, ten years later. However, not even my deep fondness of the series could make me turn a blind eye to some aspects which just didn't seem to fit in.

First of all, the plot is definitely underdeveloped. There are more gaps than I could have ever hoped to trace as a child, which not only spoil the overall feeling the series creates, they also fail to create strong and profound characters, as well. Even though the Digimon Empreror arc was interesting, since the DigiDestined are now forced to come up against another Human Being rather than a Digital monster, this aspect was rather neglected. What is more, the Kaizer's motives are given in a very flat and shallow way. Ken is brought to his senses when he realises that the Digimon are real? It is neither justified nor supported properly.

As the audience is introduced into the following arcs, we are left wondering what Arukenimon's true motives are. First, she claims it is her ultimate goal to destroy the Digital World but then again, she was created by someone whose one and only wish was to get to the Digital World? But then again, it is not Oikawa who is the villain behind it all, but MaloMyotismon? I personally felt the connection between the villains was rather poor and loose.

Compared to the first season, the main characters are also shallow and underdeveloped. TK and Ken are the only ones whose characters appear to be of a certain depth due to the family angst they have been trying to come to terms with and their complex relationship with their brothers. Kari appears to be too spotless and perfect, even though I must admit, she was my personal favourite. Yolei is constantly annoying for no reason at all and Cody has left me cold. Nevertheless, it is Davis, the leader who is supposed to be the one bringing the DigiDestined together, who has been the greatest disappointment of all. He remains dim-witted, naive, mindlessly optimistic and arrogant for half the season, while he spends the remaining half obsessed with Ken? I could only perceive it a feeble attempt to recreate the Tai-Matt dynamic of the first season, even though it was so poorly presented, it seemed to hint at romance at times.

As far as the ending is concerned, it didn't quite rise up to my expectations either. Throughout the entire series, the viewers are being prepared for a very strong and impressive climax, which eventually doesn't turn out to be half as strong or impressive. The ultimate villain is defeated in the simplest, least resourceful and insightful way. The 25-years-later scene has been just as flat, too. A personal complaint of mine would be TK and Kari not being together in the end, since so much evidence of their bond has been given throughout the season.

All in all, despite the somewhat flat characters and the underdeveloped plot, I cannot ever hope to deny that Digimon Adventure 02 has been an indispensable part of my childhood. I will always look back on it with the same admiration and love I did as a child and I honestly intend to make it part of my own kids' childhood, as well.

5392350,5,B00A7GWGLS,I just finished watching this complete season last night and it was an awesome trip down memory lane. The way the story makes me feel about darkness and light and good vs evil. It's very deep for a kids cartoon! But it's totally awesome and worth watching! Makes me wish I had a partner Digimon of my own LOL!,1381968000,,309,4.254237288135593

5392353,2,B00A7GWGLS,"Just like some of the other reviewers the DVD case on my item was broken. It is cracked at the top and doesn't close all the way. This case is not easy to find a replacement case for as it has 8-swing pockets for the DVDs. This problem may be easily fixed by adding a DO NOT DROP sign on the packaging.
The DVDs are legit copies. I didn't enjoy the season at all so I'm glad that I bought it for a cheaper price than the whopping $110.00 selling price at my local HMV.
Season One is my one true love (which I also own)",1379203200,,518,3.8962264150943398

5392357,5,B00A7GWGLS,"For those who bought the first season on DVD, the box set is similar.

PROS of set;  I am 30 episodes in and so far ALL episodes are PRE 9/11 airings. This means that all shots of the control spires being destroyed are intact.

CONS; 30 episodes in and some episodes (4 so far) are missing the opening and recap. One episode was missing the credits at the end. Again, only 30 eps in out of 50 so I'll let you know if anymore are missing openings and recaps. In addition, some episodes include a Y7 rating box for about 15 seconds at the start of each episodes. It makes it seem cheap like they ripped it off line for a bootleg.

Overall, a nice set. Some flaws as mentioned but its a great price and packaged nicely. A must have for Digimon fans!",1377129600,8,746,4.159722222222222

The destined are forced to go back to the world to free it only to find out there is a darker hand at work. Amazing show way more in depth then any Pokemon episode out there.

The quality of the video is wonderful, considering the show is over ten years old, and the episodes themselves are the original, uncensored dub versions that aired before 9/11, meaning you get some scenes or shots that make the sequences feel more complete, particularly with the destruction of the control spires.  My one nitpick with the set is that some episodes are missing the recap of the last episode, or the opening sequence.  This really hurts the very first episode, because there's a really sweet summary of what's happened over the last 3 years that's missing.  Nevertheless, this is a great set, and I can't wait for the release of the other seasons.",1367020800,,758,4.8076923076923075

The issues I have  run across with this set are episodes 1-6 have really bad ghosting thankfully by episode 7 this is fixed, also three episodes are missing their recaps and openings for some reason,and finally two episodes have the  TVY7 rating on the top the screen when the episodes begin. I don't know how New Video could miss these technical issuses when put this set together and I wish they had spent a little less time the 32 page insert and more time working out all the kinks in the set before releasing it. I do  still suggest you  pick up the set and try to look pass the technical issues like I did and  just be happy to finally have digimon on dvd.",1366675200,,804,4.188311688311688

like the first one i couldn't contain my excitement on this one and boy it doesent let one down...much, the packaging has the same issues as the season 1 set but oh well my onle negatives about this release would be that theres some sort of weird echo or something on the audio when it starts up on the menu and that the menu plays the season 1 theme song instead of the 2nd season one, also the prologue is missing on the first episode so from a technical standpoint, theres room for improvement here but on a general quality standpoint it's seemingly fine, my nitpicks aside this is a MUST BUY for any fan of digimon looking to add the 2nd season to there collection",1366243200,,758,4.270833333333333

5392406,5,B00A7GWGLS,"This is my second favorite season of Digimon next to season 1. In my own opinion, this is where the ""real Digimon"" ends. There were a few things that bugged me in this season though. One, I always kind of hoped Kari and TK would have gotten together, and I feel the fans of Kari and TK were robbed. Two, they didn't put Kari and TK together but were able to put Ken and Yolei together at the very end of the series. Never understood that one. Although, I did wish they did build up to the romance between Yolei and Ken which would have made more sense when they announced it at the end. Third, yes the ""plot holes."" One of the ""plot holes"" I didn't like that Toei did was stopping whatever plot they had going when they aired ""His Master's Voice"" (one of my favorite episodes this season next to Genesis of Evil). Don't know why Toei stopped it, they could have had a good plot and possibly let Kari have a story of her own. The few things I enjoyed about this season was seeing the old characters from season 1, the Ken saga, and the Davis/Ken friendship.

Overall, great season of Digimon and one of my favorites! I always felt  Digimon ended here when the second season finished. Digimon didn't feel the same in Tamers or beyond however I did surprisingly enjoyed Frontier. It truly was ashamed that Toei did not decide to continue using the Adventure characters for other seasons. They could have easily made them continue their adventures in high school or heck college and even continue building character development especially for the new kids in the second season.

Shout out to New Video Group for another amazing release! Can't wait to get this in the mail:)",1364256000,,1669,4.483552631578948

5392411,4,B00A7GWGLS,"Digimon Zero Two ranks as my second favorite digimon season, Season 1 and Tamers are tied for first.

Zero Two is a worthy sequel to the first season however In my opinion it is not better than Season 1. The biggest disappointment for me in Season 2 was the new characters they added in. Davis was the most obnoxious character in the franchise and for the life of me I don't understand why this moron was chosen to be the leader of the new digidestined. I felt that Yolei was a little too hyperactive at times and Cody didn't really leave an impression on me. On the other hand though, I thought that Ken was very well developed and interesting. His transition from good kid to villain to hero again was done very well and stands out as one of the highlights of season two. While on Villains, Oikawa, and sorry if I spelled that wrong, was also an interesting villain. His whole story is kind of heartbreaking and his resolution was also Tearjerking. I also wish the previous team hadn't taken a back seat to the new team, Half of which I didn't find interesting. Yes, I'm aware that the older kids went to the digital world with the new group on occasion but I just wish they had done it more often. I also didn't like that the older kids were given the thankless task of covering for the new kids in the first story arc. Kind of a small thing but I was a big fan of the characters in Season 1 and didn't like how they were treated in season 2.

That being said, there is a lot to like about season 2. Apart from the villains, I loved the armor digivolutions, they were an awesome and creative way of keeping digivolution in the show without becoming repetitive. I also liked the DNA digivolutions, except for Shakkoumon, which were again a great way to keep digivolution without becoming repetitive.

As for the reported plot holes in season 2, some of them I can forgive, Others make no sense to me even when explained. As for the Epilogue, I didn't care for it and that's all I'll say about it. There were also a couple of ideas and concepts that seemed awesome and incredible that I wished were explored more fully, one of which was the Guardians of the Digital World. We only saw one of them.

Overall I think there are a lot of good things about season 2, but there are also some bad things. It's a worthy sequel to Adventure, but In my opinion, it does not surpass the original.",1360454400,5,2386,4.34304932735426
5392412,3,B00A7GWGLS,"What can I say Digimon Adventure 02? It is one of the worst seasons of the show. It puts the characters we want to see in the back seat and introduces four new characters. Two of the new characters  are interesting and two of them are as annoying as finding a black gear in your back (Digimon reference anyone?).

There are many plot holes, inconsistencies, and dropped ideas in this  season that will leave any writer in painfully agonizing tears. Although this season doesn't hold up nearly as well as the others it does, however, have a lot of Nostalgia value for me. I enjoy watching it still it's fun, cartoony, and sometimes so over the top its still worth the watch.

If you were a fan of ""Digimon Adventure"" don't pass up this season. Its a mediocre sequel but it sort of acts as a second serving of the series by no means is it as satisfying as your first serving but you still enjoy it for what it is.",1358899200,7,911,4.309941520467836

Now we can see all 50 episodes of it in this soon-to-be-a-hit DVD set! But I haven't heard anything of this season's TV movie, Revenge of Diaboromon, being in this set; it'd make a be-awesome (Beyond awesome) bonus program, perfect for this set. For seasons 3 & 4, their respective TV movies should be in those sets too. The whole 2nd season of the show itself is here in this set; from the debut of the first Armor Digimon, to the relationship-controversial hit His Master's Voice (And yes, T.K. & Kari remain BFF's for sure; SpongeBob, Patrick and/or Sandy would be the same way if they lost each other in manners that Kari disappeared.), to the rise of BlackWarGreymon, to the rarely-seen Christmassy part of it, A Very Digi Christmas, Dramon Power & the whole Digimon World Tour trilogy (Believe me, if T.K. & Kari were more than BFF's, he'd be in boiling water if she caught him wooing the French Digidestened Catherine, just as Tai was doing.) to the Invasion of the Daemon Corps to the epic-and-brutal rebirth-and-final-demise of MaloMyotismon.

Now this is just my own personal complaint, but I wished there was Japanese audio. I'm not going to get into a sub vs dub debate, but these days majority of anime always come with the option with japanese audio/english subs... so seeing this without it, just feels like a step backwards",1355356800,9,629,4.3760683760683765

8547858,1,B00A7GWGLS,"There is next to no quality in the production value of this DVD release.  The set uses DVD-5's instead of DVD-9's to hold its episodes.  A DVD-5 will hold 4 episodes without quality loss through compression.  There are 7 episodes per DVD-5 in this set.  That means they used an awful lot of compression, so these episodes are not presented in the quality they should be.  DVD-5's are cheaper to produce than DVD-9's, which is why this company went this route.  I'm surprised they didn't even go cheaper and use flippers.  Flippers reduce the number of discs but are notoriously cheap and too often arrive unplayable.

If you're going to go cheap and use DVD-5's, then, by all means, increase the number of discs in a set and only put 4 episodes per disc.  To nearly double the number of episodes that will fit on a disc is simply cheap, to reduce production costs while still charging the maximum amount for the DVD set.

There is only one or two episodes where not much is accomplished , and the characters are primarily enjoyable, each having an unique personality. The Villains are obviously evil and cunning, but you also end up liking most of them. The partner digimon are cool and there is a large variety of digimon good and bad that they encounter.
