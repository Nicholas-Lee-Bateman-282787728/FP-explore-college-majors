8706606,4,B00UGQICYY,"A prince visits a Swiss resort and (under an assumed name) falls in love with the skating instructor. Incredible skating performances by Sonja Henie with scores of backup skaters and accompanied by a full orchestra and chorus. Breathtaking. Thin plot with musical numbers, dancing and skating featured. Henie tops the charts for cuteness, and she actually give a credible performance as an actress. If you like musicals from this period, you will like this moviea pleasurable, artistic experience.",1482796800,,497,5.384615384615385
