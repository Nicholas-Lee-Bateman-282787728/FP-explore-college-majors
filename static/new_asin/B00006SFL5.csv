1792215,2,B00006SFL5,"What do you get when you cross realism with an ultra-campy script and lots of dancing, half-naked people? Well, the answer to this question is ""Circuit,"" but if you also said ""Glitter,"" and/or ""Showgirls"" you are also correct. ""Circuit"" is the sophomore effort of former Playgirl Man-of-the Year turned film director, Dirk Shafer, who previously directed a small 'mockumentary' called ""Man of the Year,"" which discussed his trials and tribulations of being the object of desire among Playgirl's women readers, although he is gay.
Covering a series of 'circuit' parties in Southern California, ""Circuit"" covers the life of a small-town gay cop named John (played by Jonathan Wade-Drahos, who looks amazingly like Pierce Brosnan) who moves to Los Angeles in order to live a much more open life. Moving to Los Angeles, John meets up with his cousin Tad, an amateur filmmaker who is filming a documentary on attitudes and life on the circuit party scene.
While in Los Angeles, John finds himself delving in the decadent lifestyle common among many in the circuit scene. From drug use to hustling, John gets acquainted with the help of new found friend and hustler Hector (Andre Khabbazi) which allows the viewer to see changes in his character. With a slew of other forgettable characters, the film progresses somewhat like a crash and burn sequence where we see the principle character try to discover himself through the means of reinvention only to begin a recovery of his former self in order to live a more meaningful life with someone who can love him for himself and not for his appearance.
While many characters such as Bobby (Paul Lekakis) an HIV+ dancer who has little ambition in life and Gino (played by William Katt of the television cult classic ""The Greatest American Hero"") do add some substance to this film, ""Circuit"" fails in many attempts to capture many aspects that makes it a stand out as a realistic film. Due to a small budget, a cast of mainly amateur actors, and a very campy, and a predictable script, ""Circuit"" succumbs to these factors. I must admit that Shafer does a good job of covering drug use (the close-up, rotational views of a Special K bottle reminds me of Spanish director Pedro Almodovar's internal close-ups of normal, everyday objects in his films), but the film's overall art direction, the poor quality of the film used, the sappy selection of dance songs used throughout the film (except for Taylor Dayne's song, where are club legends such as Victor Calderone, Junior Vasquez, Thunderpuss, and Peter Rauhofer on this soundtrack?) and the short coverage of the actual party circuit causes the film to fizzle before its' time is up.
Although most of the actors are not Oscar-calibre thespians, four performances stand out in the film. Veteran actors William Katt and Nancy Allen (they had previously worked together in the horror classic ""Carrie"") are always great together, especially Katt who plays a seedy circuit party organizer/drug dealer. Paul Lekakis' character of Bobby does have some highpoints in the film, however the true standout in this film is Andre Khabbazi. As Hector, Khabbazi truly has a wide range of emotions that indicate that he has had some extensive dramatic training, and his overall appearance validates the film's message that in the 'circuit' beauty is everything.
The 'circuit' might be considered the ""Superbowl for gay men,"" but due to the above factors, ""Circuit"" the film is like the ""Showgirls for gay men."" Campy, predictable, weak script, and plenty of overacting, especially by Daniel Kucan (""Tad""), ""Circuit"" is a film that hits and misses not only when it comes to quality, independent filmmaking, but also when covering today's party/circuit scene. Again, I give the director and his team credit for some creative camera angles, some accuracy in covering the theme, and providing viewers with a morale, but ""Circuit"" falls short of what many encounter after a weekend of hard partying.",1041638400,11,3969,5.033434650455927
1792216,3,B00006SFL5,"Director Dirk Shafter offers a beautiful, glossy nightmare, with a dazzling soundtrack and wild camera angles. When John, played with perfect innocence and occasional disgust by Jonathan Wade-Drahos, suffers a gay-bashing at the hands of the very police force he serves on, he decides to move to L.A. and spend time with his gay cousin, Tad. Driving down the streets of L.A. and seeing openly gay men holding hands in public makes John smile. But then, when he arrives at Tad's house, he receives his first glimpses of a party scene that can destroy relationships and lives.
Despite his attempts to the contrary, John soon becomes caught up in the drug culture of Circuits-huge weekend parties for gay men. Besides making an incredible amount of money for the organizers, these events often provide a setting for drug trafficking, often leading to unsafe sex. Considering that the events cater strictly to gay men, all of that leads to the spread of HIV. As one character ironically points out, the events sometimes promote themselves as fund-raisers for AIDS, or as places where condoms and safe-sex messages make their way to the gay male community.
John has two tender, stabilizing relationships: one with his former girlfriend, and one with Tad's former boyfriend. Unfortunately, the less healthy relationships threaten to destroy him. While focusing on that plot, the movie also focuses on Tad's work as an amateur filmmaker who wants to make a documentary that exposes the dangers of the circuit scene. Even while filming interviews that show it at its worst, Tad still sees the scene's appeals, and the surprisingly positive sides of it. Will the two men survive their party world? I won't give that away, but I will say that the movie raises valid questions about a real scene with real allure and real dangers.
The acting needs more emotion at places, but Dirk Shafer does a great job weaving his tale through the music and images that attract certain gay men to the circuit.
One complaint about the DVD-a ""play all"" option always helps when offering a long list of deleted scenes or other features; hitting the remote every few seconds can get tiresome, even for people who usually commit channel surfing. Repeated viewings of this movie shouldn't get tiresome, though. Shafer offers a controversial depiction of a segment of the gay male community, one that will probably receive more recognition as we examine the impact of the circuit scene on a group that already lost way too many people to drugs and AIDS.
(Duane Simolke's books include The Acorn Stories, Degranon, and New Readings of Winesburg, Ohio.)",1041638400,5,2619,4.981735159817352
1792217,4,B00006SFL5,"The reviews for the movie, state that its terrible and projects the wrong image for the gay community.  The truth is the circuit community is a LARGE part of the gay community, at least the gay male community.  The images shown in Circuit as by and large truthful and unvarnished.  Thousands upon Thousands of gay boys flock the parties all over the country.  And while Circuit may show an extreme version of the events, they are nevertheless valid and accurate.  I have literally seen people drop dead next to me from overdose of GHB and the other boys look and then keep dancing.  The extensive 'partying' that surrounds those events is sad but its a fact that can not be overlooked not matter how much we might wish it to be otherwise.
This film should be taken for what it is a non-judgmental honest portrait of the circuit party lifestyle.  Its not for everyone but its factual and true to life.  Its part of our culture and we should not be afraid or ashamed of it.",1040083200,30,971,4.4772727272727275
1792218,1,B00006SFL5,"When it comes to ""Circuit,"" nothing could be worse than showcasing a film to deprave the gay community. Stereotyping steroid-bound, drug-taking, shirtless, muscled dancing boys as periodic sources of amusement is one thing (like in a comedy), but to see a full-blown celebration of their ""partying"" antics on the big-screen is another . . .
Never has the gay community been more divided (while projecting a unified front in most mainstream gay magazines and organizations) than you see it in ""Circuit.""  The characters are so inundated with themselves, only the most attractive men (there's nothing wrong with looking at goodlooking guys, but when they're extremely shallow and popping drugs, its another perspective of self-depravation that is conjured and un-sexy) are shown together with no other real, or ""regular-looking"", guys to congregate with.  Again, this mirrors the mentality of all circuit revelers where the technically unattractive are shunned and mistreated; better yet, not shown.  There's almost no other angle to their meaningless and pathetic lives, but to attend the latest circuit events.  Its entirely ironic how some of these beautifully-physiqued guys can ""counter-balance"" their health with poppers, crystal, ecstacy pills, and other forms of illegal narcotics for a singular night of partying.  This film is a shameful entry into the gay film genre, emitting no merits or morals to speak of.
On the technical aspect, just because the film was destined for an independent release, this should have not been an excuse for the lack of audio and visual presentation. The film is choppy, at times under-saturated in colors and skin tones (no, this is not a symbolic extention of on-screen drug taking and a character's lightening epidermis), where at other times the film stock appears grainy and poor.  Definitely not a colorful presentation to showcase the vibrancy of circuit party environs.  The acoustics of the music is cheap and low-rate; reverberating like it was recorded from a radio broadcast before it was applied to the soundtrack.  Though the music is typical (speedy techno-trance, along with some Taylor Dayne song) for the diagetic content, the visuals could have been juxtaposed more tightly with the constant, edgy, multi-framed cutting to match with the music's beat and rhythm. (MTV wouldn't be proud of the film's editing, I'm sure.) Instead, a cheap, almost lazy, production was evidentally sacrificed with belief the male imagery would compensate to its targetted audience. Truly awful.
The film was written and directed by none other than Dirk Schafer, a former Playgirl centerfold, who even made a little independent film about -- gasp -- himself and his experience during the magazine run...a superficial feature as a follow-up. ""Circuit"" is a horrible movie that doesn't praise the image for the gay community, but defiles it with its socially destructive imagery of lascivious and drugged-out gay men.",1035504000,23,2952,5.333333333333333

The film does a good job capturing the good and bad of the circuit scene and nuances of love and dating anyone can relate to. I love the fact this film is not preachy but lets the storyline speak for itself.  The music is awesome too: I bought the CD. I also think the introduction to Officer John is typical of a lot of gay people's experience when he left his job in a small town for LA.  Given some of the negative reviews here, I want to add that you can't expect every gay film to only portray the gay community as a white-washed mainstream version of itself: this film is about a gay party subculture that has its excesses, not unlike the rest of Hollywood to be honest.",1425081600,,738,4.302158273381295

1792276,4,B00006SFL5,"A dramatic film about the conjunction of three things that become deadly when put together under the guidance of a fourth one.

First you have techno music that goes along with partying as a total lifestyle. Those parties or rave parties if you prefer are the moment when everything is possible, when all risks are negated and forgotten, when for a few hours, generally about ten, you can do what you want, and particularly what is forbidden. A rather vast share or slice of the young people pie want to try and the older you are the more addicted to it you become. And in fact it is not only techno music that can have this dimension.

Second you want to look good, and in this culture to look good is to have strong and hard muscles, to be some kind of muscle man and you end up taking steroids, and all other hormonal complexes to increase your muscular structure. You also have to do a lot of lead pumping or beef pumping. You become then desirable, you become an object, a live object that finds its pleasure in being looked at and desired. Some will go slightly further and get on the stage to just make it a profession, on the stage of showbiz or the stage of hustling.  The result is often the same: you start living in the light and stars of an artificial sky that does not exist except in your own mind.

Third, and that is one option, you enter the gay planet and of course the AIDS trip, and then you can go further down everyday since you have to perform and to perform you have to take drugs that are short lived and that blur and dull your own sensations which means you need more of the stimulant to get up again and perform. The vicious circle that leads to an overdose sooner or later and then it will be too late.

The fourth element is the supervision you get from some entrepreneur who only aims at exploiting the mine. He organizes everything, hires the place that has to be a big hall easy to equip and evacuate eventually with higher floors that provide the party-revellers with all the equipments they need to amplify the partying with personal and more intimate ventures. That man is exploiting the show people on the stage, who are artists in spite of all, as if they were chattel, and even maybe cattle since when one is finished it has to be shot, and we all know we even shoot horses from time to time.

That mixture is set of course in Los Angeles and in Hollywood and then the rest is script writing to get a scenario that can hit the road with suspense and enough titillating to attract the voyeurs but not too much lest it would mean the film could be X-rated. You are targeting young people over 15, so please keep quiet enough and try to sound pedagogical, especially about the vanity of age, youth, as if the number of years had any sense when two minds meet, when two souls communicate.

And yet there is something attractive and even fascinating in that film: the slow discovery that love has nothing to do with this. Love needs some permanence, some natural passion, some trust in the other, some trust in nature and natural means to achieve that passion and the sentiments and desires that go along with it and that can even consider any physical intimacy as not necessary most of the time. Two men can find their satisfaction in just loving each other in all kinds of everyday activities, even chores.

- This movie is an embarassment to the gay community.  It portrays all gay men as shallow, stuck up, phoney, promiscuous, drug addicted and sex addicted.

- The movie is WAY too long.  They could have shaved off a good 30 or 45 minutes of unnecessary and bland footage.

- The plot is cheesy.  I won't give away the ending, but let me just say it's laughable because it's so ridiculous.

- The acting is TERRIBLE!  Oh boy, it was embarassing just watching these people try to act it was so bad.

- It looks like they filmed the movie with a handheld camcorder!  The entire film is grainy, the lighting is poor, and the sound is poor as well.  They should've been embarassed to even use whatever cheap equipment they used. smh.

All I can say is please don't spend too much money to watch this movie - either buy it used or rent it if possible, because I know I wish I never would've spent $22 on this garbage when it first came out.  I watched it once, and haven't watched it again since.",1297382400,,1141,4.271028037383178

1792284,2,B00006SFL5,"""Circuit"" is a sad film about superficial men who need drugs in order to give life a lift.  John Webster is a small-town policeman with whom no one will partner because he is gay.  His police chief urges him to go to a larger city.  Jonathan Wade-Drahos who is in a film this year with Ed Asner titled ""Trim"" plays the cop.  His performance is a little stiff, without much emotional depth.  Andre Khabbazi, who apparently stopped making films after this one, plays Hector Ray.  He does a great job at being vapid with the classic line that he doesn't like women or ugly men.  Khabbazi actually does give a super performance in the film.  Brian Lane Green who was nominated for a Tony for Best Actor in a Musical back in 1989 plays Gill in what was apparently his last film up to this time.  He does a decent job as the sensitive connection that helps John get established in Los Angeles.  Kiersten Warren who was such a hoot on ""Desperate Housewives"" plays Nina.  Her performance is not very deep either, but she's very pretty.  Daniel Kucan plays Tad who is doing a video on the circuit party scene, and actually does some terrific acting, particularly in the deleted scenes.  Paul Lekakis plays the blond Bobby Ross who performs a stage show highlighting his assets.  What I liked most about Dirk Shafer's film is the 20 deleted scenes.  It's an excellent study in filmmaking as you hear the director's coaching, see the shots from tight to mid to long shots that gives a real idea of what it's like to make a film.

The only thing wrong with the film is the intended main character, i.e., the cop who leaves the repressive and hostile smalltown life for the wildlife of West Hollywood. While his character is not a static one, the changes that take place in his life seem to come as a result of his passivity rather than any active move on his part. This isn't helped by the bland and vanilla acting of Jonathan Wade-Drahos. Andre Khabbazi as the jaded Hector on the other hand brings much to his character, and so Hector becomes the one your heart goes out to.

1792317,1,B00006SFL5,"I'd like to help the Director Dirk Shafer and the screenwriter Gregory Hinton make this a better movie.

This movie took me to a place I am unlikely never to see; the world of circuit parties. Some reviewers have praised this film for it's honesty and unflinching look at circuit parties. WHO CARES? If I wanted to learn about circuit parties, I'd tour the local sewage treatment plant.

Mr. Shafer and Mr Hinton, you can't seem to make up your minds if this film is supposed to be a fictional account or if it's a documentary. It fails miserably at both. The film tries to show the shallowness, danger and narcissism of the circuit lifestyle and becomes shallow and narcissistic itself. The plot is razor-thin (pardon the pun) the musical montages are wincingly bad. Worst of all the characters are cardboard cut-outs moved from scene to scene. We never really see any motivation let alone any growth. And in place of redemption Shafer offers a cheap and easy out: death.

I make these suggestions, Mr. Shafer, because I think -- and correct me if I'm wrong -- that you were trying to make a fictional film. Because if you were trying to make a documentary you would have partnered with Ken Burns and gotten funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.

The best movies have character-driven plots. My .02 Mr. Shafer: you really missed the boat with the main character. John leaves Illinois because he's been outed at work as a police officer and is led into the vacuous and empty world of the gay circuit party. Allow me to make some suggestions. Why doesn't he get a job as a cop in LA -- or at least attempt to? That would have lead to all sorts of interesting developments. How do his new coworkers feel about his sexuality? How does he deal with the demands of his job after a hard night of partying? How do the other characters such as Hector react to John's getting a job? Cop in LA --let's see...corruption, Rodney King...lots of opportunities there.

One last suggestion. Instead of having John leave Illinois couldn't he move to that big city up there by Lake Michigan? What's the name of it again? The city that beat LA as the USOC candidate for the 2016 Olympics? Oh yeah -- Chicago. But, silly me, gay men only live on the two coasts and the middle of America is simply a vast wasteland to be flown over.

1792324,3,B00006SFL5,"Dirk Schaefer's independent film examining the circuit party life in southern Califronia has had a pretty bad critical reputation, but the DVD version of it with the director's cut on it certainly deserves a look. At the core of the film is a very fine performance by Andre Khabbazi as a hardboiled gay hustler secretly terrified to find himself less wanted as he ages, a performance so strong that it puts over just about every scene Khabbazi is in. The film suffers mightily from having too many characters with subplots that never become satsifactorily explored, and (worst of all) from a clichd happy ending that allows its hero, a former policeman seduced by the circuit life, to discover redemption via true love and community. Schaefer also seems as if he wanted to tell an old-fashioned sensationalistic expos of the decadence of circuit life, but was convinced somehow to show the positive aspects of circuit life as well (i.e. that for many gay men it offers an outlet for pleasure and a chance to find a sense of community with one another). While the latter are undoubtedly true, Schaefer shows these aspects in such a halfhearted way so as to make the film seem ultimately more confused than complex. The performances also vary tremednously. Some of the more experimental sequences in the film work very well (such as a fine bit with a tweaked-out Khabbazi before a mirror); others are ultimately unsuccessful.",1137456000,8,1423,4.908713692946058

And of course by the end of the movie and many not need characters and subplots that really didn't help carry the story along. The lead characters hooks up with his old friend and everyone lives happy ever after. Except the hustler who dies because of bad drugs, to bad the rest of the character didn't follow in suit.

The characters are many and well fleshed-out (literally and figuratively) and the story is compelling and interesting.

There are some movies that just bore me because I don't CARE about the characters.  This movie is not one of them.  I was rooting for just about all of them, even as they spiraled down past anybody's help (or almost, in some cases.)

The movie-within-a-movie was a wonderful showcase for the characters to explain their point of veiw and showed them often at their most vulnerable, for all their posturing about how invincible they thought they were.

There is A LOT of drug use.  Perhaps it is accurate.  It was hard to watch because you could see the characters deteriorating.

There is a wonderful touching scene between John, the main character (who looks like Clark Kent) and Hector, his hustler friend (and perhaps his true love) in a limo toward the end of the film.  Okay, so I LOVE Hector.  Sue me.

There are also wonderful performances by the character of Nina, who is John's college girlfriend (now roommate) and Paul Lekakis, of ""Come On Over to My House"" and ""Boom Boom Boom"" fame from the '90s.

This movie focuses on the 'circuit boys' and the people in their lives. The movie centers around many circuit parties, but it's more than just parties. The movie is rich with exploration into each character.
The movie starts with a man who is a cop in a midwestern town where he grew up in, who leaves his cop life behind and moves to West Hollywood and opens up his repressed past and accepts it. He experiences the circuit life, and everything involved. The drug use, the heavy interest in physical appearance and beauty. He falls from grace and deals with the consequences of his drug use and overall lifestyle change.
However he is not the only character we get to know. There's a lot of different characters you get to know through this movie, and you truly get a sense of who they are and why they do what they are doing. The movie deals with a lot of ideas about the fear of getting older and not being the hot young thing anymore. I thought it was brilliant, the filmmaker making a movie within a movie really worked well and emphasized the point of the movie all that much more.

All of these guys are in this film and every TV show and film made. The ones who make the money, the ones teenage boys and girls put on their walls, are perfect in face and body. Circuit tries to show that this life, while sexually free of any morals, can be as empty as the space between the Earth and the moon. Still, they choose to live this life and I am sometimes jealous I cannot (me of no high cheekbones or flat chest and stomach. I'm just normal, which means I write about this than live it). I was surprised at how good the film is, even if the story is a little flat. Jonthan Wade Drahos, an almost bizarre version of Peirce Brosnan, Andre Khabbazi, Brian Lane Green and Daniel Kucan do fairly well with the thin material given, and all are very, very, very beautiful.

1792372,3,B00006SFL5,"Reading the comments here, after seeing the movie, one would need to consider the types of people who viewed this movie. I bet most have never even seen what the Circuit is, and can be.
I am a gay man, living in this `stereo-typical' gay world. I have seen the movie, and I can totally relate. I know people like Hector, the one who `doesn't like women, or ugly men.' They exist. I see them almost daily. I feel very sorry for them. At the same time, I feel sorry for me, that I cannot be one of their friends. To them, I am ugly. These types of people exist. I hate them. Moreover, love them at the same time. This is the essence of this movie Circuit.
Yes, the acting pretty much [is bad]. LOL. Nevertheless, think deeper. Do not be so superficial. (As the characters...) The message is there in your face.... I guess, as a movie, it could have been better with budget, and actors. Like one person said, a script doctor. I did like the movie, and I thought it hit the energy and confusion of a gay man's life, seduced into that world, on the nose. I have been there. Thank God, I knew enough to get out. Beautiful, seducing, and dangerous. All of these things make up this movie, and the Circuit. The people caught in this `scene' are just that... caught up in it. In its beauty, and in its addictions. Moreover, they are so duped, (or doped, pick your wording), they cannot see what's so wrong with it. I love thought provoking movies. This one made me think. I wish some of my acquaintances, and one particular person I love dearly, would see this movie, and snap out of the dream world they live in, where all there is is sex, drugs, the gym, and the party. `How beautiful am I', `I'm too skinny', `I'm too fat'...etc etc... Unfortunately, these people exist.
And Dirk Shafer captured the mystique, and seduction of the Circuit almost perfectly. While still giving us the message of how dangerous it is. Yes, the acting was not the best. Yes, the budget was low. With what he had to work with, I believe this movie was as good as it could get. I am going to buy the Directors Cut DVD, and give it to someone as a present.

(USA - 2000)

Aspect ratio: 1.85:1
Theatrical soundtrack: Mono

A gay police officer (Jonathan Wade Drahos) is outed at work and subsequently relocates to LA where he becomes caught up in the 'circuit party' lifestyle and is almost destroyed by its worst excesses...

Filmed in digital video format over a six month period by director/co-writer (and former 'Playgirl' centerfold) Dirk Shafer, CIRCUIT casts an uncritical eye over the circuit party scene and simply allows the characters' experiences - good and bad - to speak for themselves. This non-judgmental approach is the key to the film's success, both as a chronicle of the social pressures which can elevate or destroy those caught up in this particular scene, and as a high-powered drama. Drahos toplines a relatively unknown cast as the wide-eyed innocent torn asunder by corrupting influences, though he's upstaged by former soap actor Andre Khabazzi (""The Young and the Restless"", ""Sunset Beach"") as a pumped-up party boy who refuses to have sex with anyone unless they pay for it, and is obsessed with growing old and losing his beauty (there are moments in the film when Shafer's camera lingers on Khabbazi's sculpted body, culminating in a memorable sequence where Khabazzi indulges his characters' narcissism in front of a full-length mirror).

Equally impressive is Daniel Kucan as an aspiring filmmaker who records a series of video interviews with his circuit party friends (including Drahos, in a beautifully acted sequence where he's so spaced-out he can barely speak). Further down the cast list, veterans William Katt and Nancy Allen are reunited on-screen for the first time since CARRIE (1976), and while they both appear to enjoy playing against type, their roles seem pretty superfluous. Kiersten Warren and Brian Lane Green are solid as the only true friends in Drahos' life, and 80's pop sensation Paul Lekakis makes his screen debut as an erotic performance artist whose acts of self-mutilation will horrify all but the most hardened masochists. You have been warned!

Director Shafer revels in the beautiful gym-buffed bodies which form a crucial aspect of the circuit party scene, and he also includes a number of relatively chaste sexual encounters, mostly tender, sometimes dark and disturbing, always credible. The movie's production values are OK, and Shafer demonstrates a genuine cinematic awareness, helped by solid technical support all round. Look quickly for brief cameos by Craig Chester (SWOON), writer/comedian Bruce Vilanch (GET BRUCE) and director Randal Kleiser (THE BLUE LAGOON).

By the way, sensitive viewers are advised that the climactic party sequence contains prolonged flashing-light effects.",1048550400,7,2708,5.372641509433962

The story line, if that's what you want to call it is banal and predictable.  The dialogue is weak at best, and the acting, or lack there of, is deplorable.
What do you get when you take a small town cop and plunk him in the middle of the circuit scene in Southern Cal pumped up on steroids and tweaked out on 'K'?  Let's watch as his life spiral downward, while his supposedly good friends take a back seat and watch without intervention.  Mix this with a touch of HIV+, a homeless woman he dated when he thought he liked girls...whoops...a ditzy DJ, a long-time relationship gone bad, Circuit parties, gorgeous studs galore, narcissism and a ghetto fabulous trailer in the hills.

My biggest problem with the whole premise is that if the main character, John, is an experienced cop from a small midwesternish city...why is he living in a cheap trailer taking odd jobs barely able to pay rent instead of working as a cop in a more tolerant city like LA or West Hollywood?  It just seems that it would make more sense that way.  However, then we wouldn't have a movie, would we?
Dirk Schafer shows a great deal of talent as a director.  Some of his scenes, angles, and close-ups are very compelling and stylish.  There's a lot of potential there if he can get work in a mainstream production and break out of the gay ghetto of film making.
Overall, there's nothing redeemable about any of the characters, plus the situations are way too full of cliches and simplistic in their conclusions.

Well, the answer to this question is ""Circuit,"" but if you also said ""Glitter,"" and/or ""Showgirls"" you are also correct. ""Circuit"" is the sophomore effort of former Playgirl Man-of-the Year turned film director, Dirk Shafer, who previously directed a small 'mockumentary' called ""Man of the Year,"" which discussed his trials and tribulations of being the object of desire among Playgirl's women readers although he is gay.
Covering a series of 'circuit' parties in Southern California, ""Circuit"" covers the life of a small-town gay cop named John (played by Jonathan Wade-Drahos, who looks amazingly like Pierce Brosnan) who moves to Los Angeles in order to live a much more open life. Moving to Los Angeles, John meets up with his cousin Tad, an amateur filmmaker who is filming a documentary on attitudes and life on the circuit party scene.
While in Los Angeles, John finds himself delving in the decadent lifestyle common among many in the circuit scene. From drug use to hustling, John gets acquainted with the help of new found friend and hustler Hector (Andre Khabbazi) which allows the viewer to see changes in his character. With a slew of other forgettable characters, the film progresses somewhat like a crash and burn sequence where we see the principle character try to discover himself through the means of reinvention only to begin a recovery of his former self in order to live a more meaningful life with someone who can love him for himself and not for his appearance.
While many characters such as Bobby (Paul Lekakis) an HIV+ dancer who has little ambition in life and Gino (played by William Katt of the television cult classic ""The Greatest American Hero"") do add some substance to this film, ""Circuit"" fails in many attempts to capture many aspects that makes it a stand out as a realistic film. Due to a small budget, a cast of mainly amateur actors, and a very campy, and a predictable script, ""Circuit"" succumbs to these factors. I must admit that Shafer does a good job of covering drug use (the close-up, rotational views of a Special K bottle reminds me of Spanish director Pedro Almodovar's internal close-ups of normal, everyday objects in his films), but the film's overall art direction, the poor quality of the film used, the sappy selection of dance songs used throughout the film (except for Taylor Dayne's song, where are club legends such as Victor Calderone, Junior Vasquez, Thunderpuss, and Peter Rauhofer on this soundtrack?) and the short coverage of the actual party circuit causes the film to fizzle before its' time is up.
Although most of the actors are not Oscar-calibre thespians, four performances stand out in the film. Veteran actors William Katt and Nancy Allen (they had previously worked together in the horror classic ""Carrie"") are always great together, especially Katt who plays a seedy circuit party organizer/drug dealer. Paul Lekakis' character of Bobby does have some highpoints in the film, however the true standout in this film is Andre Khabbazi. As Hector, Khabbazi truly has a wide range of emotions that indicate that he has had some extensive dramatic training, and his overall appearance validates the film's message that in the 'circuit' beauty is everything.
The 'circuit' might be considered the ""Superbowl for gay men,"" but due to the above factors, ""Circuit"" the film is like the ""Showgirls for gay men."" Campy, predictable, weak script, and plenty of overacting, especially by Daniel Kucan (""Tad""), ""Circuit"" is a film that hits and misses not only when it comes to quality, independent filmmaking, but also when covering today's party/circuit scene.

I think that the director was on target with the drugs, narcissisms, shallowness, deceit and sex. The movie was called ""Circuit"" and it was true to its title. We all know that a circuit party is nothing but a festival of beautiful buffed men dancing and enjoying recreational drugs. I would not go to a circuit party looking for a bunch of nerds sitting around playing chess and listening to classical music.
I think that it was not a very polished movie. I also think that if you familiar with the circuit lifestyle. You would figure out the point that this movie was trying to make the viewers. I took it at face value. Great music and visuals!",1042675200,4,940,4.346590909090909

'Circuit' refers to the widespread gay parties that glorify the razzle dazzle of Dionysian sexuality - the White Party in Palm Springs, the Red Party, the Blue Party, etc.  The story shows how a closeted cop from a small town ventures to West Hollywood, finds comradery in the freedom of life he has been repressing, and goes all the way with the extremes of the wild life, ending up with the sad side effects of overindulgence. No one here is preaching that this compulsive behaviour is THE way to live; the other people our cop encounters include men and women who live on the periphery of the party line and are tender, loving, caring 'normal' folk.  What the writers and directors do examine here is just how fatal the wild life can become when the fear of aging, of no longer becoming the 'new sensation' in town, happens.  There is a lot of in-club dancing accompanied by a lot of drug use and abuse.  Yet in the end we have the opportunity of examining the Rake's Progress effects on all the characters who survive.  The use of the 'video being made' within a film is very effective and the cast is eye candy and for the most part a fine group of actors.
