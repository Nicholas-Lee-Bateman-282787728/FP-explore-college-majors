3032056,5,B000YKYT1W,this is the first choice of al the bob videos....our favourite character combined with live action of construction is awesome!!,1214006400,,127,5.4
3032057,4,B000YKYT1W,"My 3-1/2-year old is not a Bob the builder fan (he's a construction, fire engine and train fanatic), yet he loves this video. I think the live action helps--it shows actual roads and bridges being built. We've tried previous Bob the builder videos, but this is the only one he's asked for daily. Another plus is that the songs are not too annoying. If your child loves construction and is curious about how things are built, then this is the right DVD for you.",1208131200,9,460,4.488095238095238
3032058,5,B000YKYT1W,This is a great new Bob video. It uses real footage of construction  trucks and mixes in the animated Bob vehicles. It is educational and very entertaining. Any child who loves construstion would love this....even if they are not a fan of Bob the Builder. Love this video!!!!!!!!!,1204243200,,280,4.833333333333333
3032059,5,B000YKYT1W,"I bought this for my son for Valentine's Day and he loves it.  He has watched 2-3 times a day and can't get enough.  He loves the live ""real"" clips of the construction vehicles and has never really had an interest in them before.
I am glad we got this, well worth the money.",1203638400,,274,4.055555555555555
3032060,3,B000YKYT1W,"Picked this video up at the library right after it was released.  My 3-yr old was very entertained by the new Bob segments as well as the live action of the construction sites.  Only downsides would be that the Bob segments are limited to Roley and a brief piece with Lofty talking with Bob.  Several other members of Bob's team are in the video, but none of them talk, as if the video were made on a limited budget for royalty payments and none of the other character's voice actors were on the payroll for this one.  Lots of the animated portion is just a re-hash of scenes from old Bob episodes.  Also, the disk case shows a Sneak Peak teaser for some new Bob machines, but the video never plays it.  The main menu has no option for it and the AutoPlay function at the start of the video, while mentioning bonus features follow the main video, never plays anything after the feature video is done.  It just returns to the Main Menu again and that's it.  This caused some toddler questions of ""Where is the new part"" repeatedly when the Sneak Peak didn't play.
  Overall, it was entertaining for him, since it was different than normal with the live action interaction, but from a parents point of view, this is a low-cost filler for Bob the Builder video until new real episodes come out on DVD.",1202515200,22,1298,4.415966386554622

It appears that someone burned this dvd in his garage. I am very upset with this vendor and will not purchase anything else from them. The only reason I'm not returning the dvd is because fortunately my son likes Thomas and wants to keep it.",1343606400,,414,4.1234567901234565

3032154,5,B000YKYT1W,"I saw in some reviews that a few people were bothered that there is not much screen time for most of the Bob characters in this video (or any of the On-Site vidoes).  Personally, I find that to be a HUGE plus.  Our two year old son has recently discovered Bob the Builder but both my husband and I find most of the videos absolutely painful to sit through.  The stories can be dumb and the characters are, quite honestly, a bit dorky.  In the On-Site videos there are just short clips of Bob with one or two of the machines and then there is a ton of good footage of trucks and ""worker men"" with just Bob voicing over what is happening.  My son is kept interested throughout and I don't have to cringe the whole time.",1268006400,,717,4.166666666666667

3032156,5,B000YKYT1W,"This is the first tractor movie that I bought my son & it's still the best.  He has been into trucks & tractors from the beginning.  Normally he will watch tv/cartoons for a minute or two before getting up to do something else, however the first time I put this movie in he sat for at least 30 minutes straight.  My son is now 20 months old & still asks for this movie everyday (even as I write this review we are watching it for the 2nd time today).  The movie is of course annoying to me because I've now seen it countless times, but my son just can't get enough.",1247011200,,565,4.063063063063063
3032157,5,B000YKYT1W,"My son, age 3, just loves the Bob the Builder onsite videos.  He's not that into the regular Bob show, but loves the onsite mixed with the regular Bob characters.  He's more into seeing the 'real' heavy equipment with the actual how-to.  We own roads and bridges and we've seen skyscrapers and parking garages and love both.  I think the latter might be a little better.  Would recommend for a kid that likes construction and trucks--but don't expect a regular Bob show with a lot of the regular characters--they are not stories but more of a how it's made video.

Personally, I find that to be a HUGE plus.  Our two year old son has recently discovered Bob the Builder but both my husband and I find most of the videos absolutely painful to sit through.  The stories can be dumb and the characters are, quite honestly, a bit dorky.  In the On-Site videos there are just short clips of Bob with one or two of the machines and then there is a ton of good footage of trucks and ""worker men"" with just Bob voicing over what is happening.

My son is now 20 months old & still asks for this movie everyday (even as I write this review we are watching it for the 2nd time today).

He's more into seeing the 'real' heavy equipment with the actual how-to.  We own roads and bridges and we've seen skyscrapers and parking garages and love both.  I think the latter might be a little better.  Would recommend for a kid that likes construction and trucks--but don't expect a regular Bob show with a lot of the regular characters--they are not stories but more of a how it's made video.
