7882512,2,6305082189,"The worst parts are 1) the sound, often the words are unintelligible and the noise in background unbearable 2)the frequent repetitions of scenes across the 5 DVDs.

Often boring. The interviews of survivors are endless.

I couldn't watch more than two out of five.

Other documentaries on the topic are much better than this.",1125532800,3,325,4.981481481481482
7882513,2,6305082189,"Three of the five volumes in this collection are fairly good in and of themselves, one is nothing more special than acceptable, and one is quite abysmal.  The problems evident in the individual volumes are multiplied several fold when you consider all five together.  There is a great deal of repetition among these presentations, not only of facts and descriptions but also of interviews with ""experts"" and survivors of the disaster.  Too often the viewer is detoured into an interminable look at modern-day remembrances and memorial commemorations of the tragedy, forced to look at objects that may have been sort of like what might have been found on the Titanic-maybe, and taken on some very boring tours of essentially unimportant locations of statues and monuments.  For the most part, the sound quality of these presentations is rather poor, which only makes a bad thing worse.  You will get a number of the facts from this collection, but you are forced to pick up your knowledge here and there from each volume in turn.  If you want a chronological, serious examination of the Titanic's maiden voyage to disaster, you would do well to look elsewhere.  There are several one-volume documentaries that do a much better job of presenting the facts, theories, and legends of the unsinkable ship that sunk.  This collection also does not have a whole lot to offer in terms of modern video footage of the ship as she lies at the bottom of the ocean.  To get to the heart of the matter, this five-volume collection is really pretty disappointing when viewed as a whole and, in my opinion, is not the worth buying, although you might pick up one of the individual volumes such as the final entry, The End of an Era, and get a little satisfaction out of it.",1050192000,9,1757,4.753289473684211
7882514,5,6305082189,THis is the most fascinating video on the Titanic ever put to dvd or video. Hawaiians may have a hard time swallowing the truth about this controversial topic.,936316800,2,159,4.714285714285714
