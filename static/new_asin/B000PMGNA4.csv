2825661,5,B000PMGNA4,My grandson is having a ball with it. He is 4 and watches it all the time.,1204502400,,74,3.411764705882353
2825662,3,B000PMGNA4,"We ordered this DVD and train car set as well thinking we would get what was shown. But instead of the honey car we got Terrence too.  I contacted Amazon and they promised to replace it with the correct item. Unfortunately, they sent me the exact same thing again. If you can purchase this in an actual store, I would recommend it so that you know exactly what you're getting.",1193961600,9,376,4.371428571428571
2825663,3,B000PMGNA4,"My son enjoyed this dvd as he does ALL the Thomas ones, but in the picture they show the ""honey car"" as included with the video and ours came with Terrance instead. This may not be a big deal for everyone , but since we already have two Terrances it was a bit of a disappointment for our ""obsessed"" little Thomas fan!",1187568000,8,317,4.129032258064516
2825664,5,B000PMGNA4,My kids enjoy watching Thomas. They ask for it all the time. It's more wholesome then some of the other shows out there.,1369785600,3,120,4.260869565217392

2825666,5,B000PMGNA4,Ordered this for my 4-year old grandson as well as me - we both love it - used to love watching Shining Time Station with my son and wanted to pass along the experience to my grandson.,1359849600,4,184,4.0
2825667,5,B000PMGNA4,The box and cover are poor quality. Look like it is not the licensed DVD. The story is good and fun,1357257600,,99,3.761904761904762
2825668,4,B000PMGNA4,"I thought it is a cartoon, but not exactly. My Little One likes the cartoon version, this one seems not too interesting. This little movie is not bad, but a little bit boring. At the talking parts the face/mouth of Thomas and Friends don't move. When they are talking the mouths aren't moving, the faces change rarely. :(

11/24/2012: First I gave 3stars. Now I edit my review and I give one more star because my Child started to like this movie and really likes the song, too.",1341792000,,477,4.420454545454546
2825669,3,B000PMGNA4,I bought this for my grandson because he has many pieces to the train set and I thought he might like this video. It is just OK and not the quality of other DVD's. This one was passed onto a friend's younger child because my grandson quickly tired of it.,1330300800,,254,4.1
2825670,5,B000PMGNA4,"My grandson loves Thomas,so any Thomas toy is a hit. If you buy the dvds with the toy train,just don't always expect to get the train that is shown. Most of the time it is different.",1263686400,,182,4.083333333333333

2825672,5,B000PMGNA4,My son loves this video (he's almost turning 3 yrs old). The fact that it had a train in it was an added bonus.,1233964800,,111,3.6666666666666665
2825673,5,B000PMGNA4,"We picked this up in the store, so I was able to get the honey car (honestly, I bought it for the honey car... videos are bonus).  My son likes both the videos and the car.  I did notice in the store that the wooden cars are randomly packaged.
