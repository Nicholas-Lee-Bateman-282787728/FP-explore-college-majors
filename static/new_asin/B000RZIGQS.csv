""Escuela de Rateros,"" 1956

This film is special for its significance as well as its content; as a film it doesn't quite rise to the quality of some of Infante's best, but it is still extremely entertaining, and as his final film, it is certainly worth watching and owning, and has a place in film history. On this day 50 years ago, Infante crashed his plane near Merida, in the Yucutan, and Mexico lost its most loved singer and actor. In ""Escuela de Rateros"" Infante plays the dual role of Victor Valdez, a devious movie star, and Raul Hernandez, a poor but likable panadero down on his luck, after some pranksters topple his bread basket in the street. We see Victor getting shot, and the police, in order to trap the killer, who they suspect is a jewel thief, get Raul, Victor's almost identical look-alike, to pretend he is the dead actor and they tell the press Victor ""survived the attack, with the bullet just grazing his arm."" Though Infante is fabulous as Victor/Raul, the film has a ""Pink Panther"" feel to it (though it predates it by 8 years) and doesn't quite have the incredible romantic charm prevalent in so many of Infante's films, as well as only having 3 songs, the best being a beautiful rendition of ""Te Quiero Asi.""

""Escuela de Rateros"" is directed by Rogelio Gonzalez (who directed Infante in the fantastic ""Escuela de Vagabundos""), and the very talented cast is terrific, and includes Eduardo Fajardo as the Jewel Thief, and Eduardo Alcaraz as the butler Tonio, who covers Raul's mistakes while impersonating Victor by saying he's practicing for his next movie role, as ""un norteno del sur."" The film has many laugh out loud moments, and is in color; the audio is a little ""flat"" so you may have to raise the volume a bit, but otherwise the film quality is good considering its age.

""Gitana Tenias que Ser,"" 1953

The great Pedro Infante takes a back seat to Carmen Sevilla in this ""film within a film,"" as the plot revolves around a producer who contracts a Spanish movie star to make a film in Mexico, and as her ""love interest,"" hires an unknown charro singer who is performing in the ""Aqui es Jalisco"" cantina. Their initial meeting is a disaster, and goes from bad to worse, as in their pride and many insecurities they deny their love for each other. Directed by Rafael Baledon, ""Gitana Tenias Que Ser"" has 9 songs, most of them sung solo or in part by Sevilla, who was a mega-star in the 50's in her native Spain, and also well known internationally. Her beauty, graceful dancing and lovely voice show why she achieved so much success at such an early age (she was 23 at the time of this film).

There are many scenes with marvelous flamenco singing and dancing, as well as some mariachi numbers, in this blend of cultures and musical styles. There are some notable duets between Infante and Sevilla: ""Cielito Lindo,"" ""Piel Canela,"" and ""Guadalajara,"" and among Infante's solos are ""Que Me Toquen Las Golondrinas."" ""Gitana Tenias Que Ser"" alternates between broad slapstick comedy and romantic melodrama, and just squeaks into the 5 star category because of its 2 superb leads, and a solid supporting cast, which includes Estrellita Castro as Tia Paquita.
................................................
""Los Hijos de Maria Morales,"" 1952

Life is one big party for los hermanos Morales; Jose (Pedro Infante), and Luis (Antonio Badu) get a reputation as ""un par de escandalosos"" as they go from town to town, and from fiesta to fiesta, seducing the girls, and getting the male population very upset. They get tripped up, when they come to the town where Don Carlos Salvatierra is Mayor, and Don Carlos tricks them into thinking they're coming to town as celebrities. The Mayor meets them with a mariachi band, and deftly escorts them into a comfy prison cell, decorated with a large and threatening portrait of their mother. What follows is a hilarious romantic romp, with fast pacing and a sharp, witty script that will keep you entertained from start to finish.

The cast is superb, with Infante and Badu once again making a great team (they made ""El Gavilan Pollero"" the previous year), and Andres Soler marvelous as Don Carlos. Irma Dorantes and Carmelita Gonzalez are funny and sassy as Don Carlos' daughter Maria and and her friend Gloria (""las dos Rositas""), and Emma Roldan is the much feared Maria Morales (""quien manda, manda!""). Directed by Fernando de Fuentes, and with music by Manuel Esperon, there are lots of songs, and it's hard not to get misty eyed while listening to Infante's superb rendition of Jose Alfredo Jimenez' beautiful and melodic ""Corazon, Corazon."" This is one of the best of Infante's romantic comedies, and will delight his fans. The film quality is only slightly deteriorated, but you'll be laughing so much you won't notice it.

""El Gavilan Pollero,"" 1947

In ""El Gavilan Pollero"" Pedro Infante plays Jose, a scoundrel of a fellow, who gets his girlfriend of many years, Antonia (Lilia Prado), involved in his schemes. When she tires of his womanizing, she takes their ill-gotten gains from a fixed horse race, and leaves him. Jose steals the horse and escapes, and meets up with Luis (Antonio Badu), who is ""mal hablado, boracho y jugador,"" and like birds of a feather, they form a ""blood brother"" bond, and a friendship that is ""amistad y pura verdad."" After many adventures, they end up in the big city, where the mambo is the craze, and who should be the featured dancer at the Club La Sirena but Antonia! There begins a story of manipulation and revenge, as Antonia pits one friend against the other.

There are many songs, the big number for Infante being ""Ella"" by Jose Alfredo Jimenez. The mambo scenes are hilarious, as the ranch guys try to dance like the city folk, and there are many funny scenes and some wild slapstick in this film, which could be classified as a melodramatic comedy. Both Infante and Badu are terrific, and Rogelio Gonzalez, who directed many of Infante's films, is at the helm, with lovely black & white cinematography by Gabriel Figueroa.
Pedro Infante (1917-1957), was Mexico's most loved singer/actor, and 50 years after his untimely passing when he crashed his plane in the Yucatan, he reigns supreme, and his many films and recordings are national treasures.",1215993600,14,6566,4.882511210762332
