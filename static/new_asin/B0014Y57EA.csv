8256567,1,B0014Y57EA,"Owing to what appears to be unprofessional documentary skills, unappealing narration, and overall lack of focus, this was not worthwhile. Repetitive footage of the crew lolling about did not make the dvd more watchable.
What a waste of disc space.
Curiously, on The White Death disk, a frequently filmed shark seems to have considerable topside wounds which were not addresed. It was strange to see the crew jolly with the prey and newborn pups while chumming the waters nearby only to find this shark who probably had plenty to eat already and may have been potentially stressed. They should've moved on but they seemed to insist on meddling with a natural scene.
Overarchingly dismaying and disappointing.",1420934400,,707,5.103448275862069

8256569,2,B0014Y57EA,"I was able to find a New copy of this Box Set for about 5 dollars, and for that it was worth it; however this is not worth its usual original price of about 15 or so dollars.

The documentaries are short and while still interesting to watch are rather basic. One of the documentaries in this set, ""Shark: The Silent Killers"" is perhaps the more informational and interesting of them all compared to the others. What kind of foils some of the slight interest of the overall set is it use of the same footage for near the same information one or two of the other discs.

Overall, this documentary set might be good in classrooms for positive information on sharks without taking up a large amount of time; but for shark loves who want a good documentary experience it falls far short.",1309996800,2,782,4.423611111111111
8256570,1,B0014Y57EA,"I have always loved documentaries and sharks and so I thought that this DVD Collection may be worth the $26 investment. I was wrong. This DVD Collection uses the same footage over and over, implements grossly exaggerated commentaries and provides advice to anyone who ""dares enter the water"".
My advice is to save your money and/or purchase a BBC or National Geographic Collection DVD. I am throwing out these DVD's as I will never watch them again. They were a waste of time and money.",1288396800,6,486,4.729411764705882
