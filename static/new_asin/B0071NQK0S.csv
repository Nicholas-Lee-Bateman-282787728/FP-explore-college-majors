5048857,4,B0071NQK0S,"This is based on a true story and is all the more shocking for it. It is about Laura Guerrero (Stephanie Sigman), she wants to be a beauty queen and escape the poverty she has to endure. She goes with her friend to sign up for the `Miss Baja' pageant and is accepted. Its like the Miss Worlds of yesteryear. Her friend then decides to go and do a bit of partying with some low life crime types at Club Millennium.

Laura decides to go and get her and whilst powdering her nose another gang turn up and decide to kill absolutely every one in the club. She manages to escape and after much soul searching she decides to go to the police. She approaches a traffic cop who says he will take her in. This he indeed does, he takes her in to the drugs lord.

What happens next is well off the beaten track of how you expect these types of film to work. She does not become an over night hard ass, but remains herself, being very scared and just doing what she has to do to survive and more importantly, protect her father and little brother.

The drug lord takes more than a shine to her and is willing to help her `career', but only if she gives his back more than a bit of a scratch.

This is from writer and director Gerardo Naranjo and is a splendid (great word that) effort. He has taken a true story and weaved a bold tale involving corrupt police, officials, drug lords and every aspect of society to shine a light on the goings on in Mexico that don't normally get advertised. We even have the US involved through the DEA.

There is some real visceral violence too, no stylised stuff, this is how it does happen and no flash techniques are used to make this more explosive. It is good old fashioned honest camera work and some solid performances from all concerned. It is totally absorbing and just flew by, it is only 108 minutes, but that is fine. This is in Spanish (Mexican) and English, with good sub titles. It is to be Mexico's official entry for the Academy Awards for Foreign Language film. I have no idea how it fared, but wish it well.",1330300800,7,2047,4.251928020565552
5048858,4,B0071NQK0S,"Dark, very dark video of life in crime ridden overall corrupt northern Mexico.  Based on the true story of a beauty queen, the Tijuana cartel, death, destruction, blood and overall waste.  Having lived on both sides of the border I know how the entire population has been raped and murdered after being fully exploited.  For those of us who love Mexico this is sadness beyond words.",1440892800,,382,4.757575757575758

5048862,3,B0071NQK0S,Not as much as I expected. The Trailer really sells this movie,1437523200,,62,4.25
5048863,4,B0071NQK0S,"I usually like my flics to be ""pretty"".  Handsome, wealthy people in warm locales making ""nice.""  While there's no beauty in this one it offers a terrifying look at conditions in Mexico and the drug industry.  Things go from bad to worse in the life of a naive, innocent girl.  My only criticism is at some points it was difficult to follow the narrative.  (But I'm sure that's characteristic of life in TJ for many people.)
Highly recommended.",1435795200,,444,4.641025641025641
5048864,3,B0071NQK0S,I feel sorry for the protagonist and admire the way she struggles to survive a horrible situation. But I lost interest in her plight somewhere along the line.,1432339200,,158,4.678571428571429

5048867,4,B0071NQK0S,Bleak. Frightening. The film was meant to terrorize your worst fears about the War on Drugs that the U.S. has exported particularly to Mexico and Colombia.,1418601600,,155,5.0
5048868,4,B0071NQK0S,good movie....,1416960000,,14,6.5

5048871,4,B0071NQK0S,"This is a really fine film in the vein of Maria Full of Grace, if you've seen that exceptional film.  I got a little confused re good guys and bad guys at the end, and who did what to whom, but basically a fine film.  The acting was exceptional.  It is very suspenseful and also shows how people can get trapped by circumstances.",1406073600,2,329,4.190476190476191
5048872,3,B0071NQK0S,"Watching Miss Bala you definitely like Laura. Your totally disoriented and have no idea, other than what you've heard on the new about Mexican drug cartels, what's going on. That part is great.

The character of Laura is frustrating. She's too passive, which leaves you feeling distant and not engaged in the plot.",1393200000,,314,4.9245283018867925
5048873,3,B0071NQK0S,"Excellent thriller and great that it focuses on a young woman coming of age
However
It is a bit stereotypical of the narcotraficante culture",1392768000,,140,4.875
5048874,1,B0071NQK0S,Not what I was expecting I guess it needed more action for me and a little bit more information on the main character,1390435200,,117,4.130434782608695
5048875,4,B0071NQK0S,Well told story....although a few spots a bit confusing to me. I liked her actions and facial expressions. Very sad problem for the families just trying to live a nice life.,1386633600,,173,4.612903225806452
5048876,5,B0071NQK0S,One of the distinguishing features of this film is that the camera follows a character as he or she moves from one location to another in events that are moving the plot. It makes for a very realistic and seamless transition between scenes. It can be stunning. The story excellently captures the feeling of the narco-war in Mexico: the helplessness of the people in the absence of public security and the corruption at all levels that makes it hard to be sure the good guys are good guys. Well directed and acted. I am interested in this subject and found the movie enthralling.,1386028800,3,578,4.621359223300971
5048877,5,B0071NQK0S,It's a real awesome movie and it's crazy how other countries can be but it is what it is .good movie all in all,1382140800,,111,3.6666666666666665
5048878,4,B0071NQK0S,"If life in Tijuana is even close to the scenes depicted in Miss Bala, I would think that one would be driven mad.  In this movie, I will say - ""Expect the un-expected!""

View this movie - and you will see what I mean...

I rate Miss Bala...Four stars!!

Rent it (or buy it), then watch it, then give thanks that the United States isn't at that level of violence - yet.",1381881600,,368,4.069444444444445
5048879,4,B0071NQK0S,Excellent movie  i did enjoyit.  Got kind of lost but it was very interesting to watch.  The story could had been put together better.  But still not bad.,1376611200,,154,4.392857142857143
5048880,5,B0071NQK0S,Great film. Beautifully directed and acted. I wish they made more movies like this in America. Looking forward to seeing director's next movie.,1376524800,,143,5.260869565217392
5048881,5,B0071NQK0S,This movie is excellent movie enjoy but you need a strong stomic to watch so be a wear of the movie it is very sexuality not for kids at all do not bring kids only adults you need a good head to focus enjoy no girl friend recommended  enjoy if girls watch it remember its only a movie not real life .

5048882,3,B0071NQK0S,"Movie had the potential to be a whole better, seems like something is always missing ( better directing, better story, better whatever)",1363910400,,135,5.181818181818182

5048884,3,B0071NQK0S,"I enjoyed the movie, however the role of ms. bala was a little disjointed, since she spent so much time, just sort of staring.",1356912000,,126,4.291666666666667
5048885,5,B0071NQK0S,"This movie accuratey depicts the situation in Mexico with regard to narcotrafic. Although it is impossible to describe everything that is happening in Mexico in just one movie, this film succeeds in that it touches the essential aspects of the war on drugs. What I like the most about his movie is the way it portrays how defenceless is the Mexican society (encarnated in Miss Bala) against the drug-lords' rampage. I really recommend this movie to any one who wants to have a glipse at the destructive war going on in Mexico because of the drugs.",1356825600,,547,4.708333333333333
5048886,5,B0071NQK0S,The movie is great! The online viewing is crisp and clear. Very satisfied with my purchase! Amazon has some of the best prices for online movies!,1356307200,,145,4.615384615384615
5048887,4,B0071NQK0S,"One woman's experience being dragged into Mexico's drug war.  I almost turned it off 20 minutes through in horror, but am glad I stuck it out.  I have been staunchly against legalizing marijuana, but this is the first movie that has ever made me fear what our own borders might become if we don't.  I would call this naturalistic violence rather than stylized violence.",1343606400,10,369,4.734375
5048888,5,B0071NQK0S,"To write and film anything remotely critical of the drug gang mess in Mexico is either very courageous or very foolish. As we all know the reality is many times worse.

The Laura in this movie is most likely based upon another Laura, Miss Sinaloa, caught in a similar pageant, drugs, guns and gangs event that unfolded a couple of years ago and which also resulted in her arrest. I thought the movie title of Bala was a Baja misspelling, but bala translates to bullet.

Well acted, and somewhat well written and directed although there were a few holes and loose ends in the storyline that seemed choppy and out of place. Also, a bit too superficial with not enough depth and background to the characters.
Cinematography, props and settings contributed to the story's believability.

With 90% of U.S. drugs coming out of Mexico and with the U.S. supplying 90% of the weapons to those same drug cartels you would think the movie industry would be pursuing those issues in earnest. Is Hollywood afraid to broach the subject? The studios should assume some societal responsibility and show the individual and social costs of the drugs/guns enterprise with more factual educative realism.",1338076800,4,1184,4.880597014925373
5048889,3,B0071NQK0S,"This should have worked on many levels--great topic (Mexican Drug War), weird subplots (from the beauty pageant to the who's doublecrossing whom) and some creative POV cinematography. Problem is I found the thing ponderously slow plus couldn't quite get if the bad guy is some big Tijuana drug kingpin, why doesn't he already have a secret mansion hideout? I get the federales are deeply involved in the drug trade hence the war in the first place but a lot of the ""ambushes"" seemed way too easy.

I get where the lead character is supposed to play it cool out of fear of herself getting killed but I often felt she was just there and not really present in scenes. I guess it was the director's choice but other than a couple of tearful scenes, I just didn't buy the lead character at all.

After reading two terrific books on current day Mexico (This Love Is Not For Cowards and El Narco) I expected that level of filmmaking.",1337904000,2,926,4.538922155688622
5048890,5,B0071NQK0S,This proves that certain models can indeed act. Just give them a great script like this and a good director and let them show their stuff! This was a very good movie. Great seller!,1337731200,,180,4.323529411764706
5048891,4,B0071NQK0S,Excellent movie about how a mafia capitalism has taken the people of Mexico captive fueled by America's greed for drugs.,1335830400,2,120,5.05
5048892,4,B0071NQK0S,"MISS BALA is a strong film from Mexico (apparently based on a true account of the unending drug war focused in Tijuana produced by actors Gael Garcia Bernal and Diego Luna and James Russo who has a role in the film as a corrupt DEA agent) - a film that is unafraid to uncover the ruthless activities by the drug cartels, the Mexican police, and the US DEA agents in the endless battle against drug trafficking. It hits like a punch in the stomach and remains in the memory long after the credits have rolled.

Laura Guerrero (Stephanie Sigman) dreams of being a beauty queen in the Miss Baja California Beauty Pageant, a position that will raise her out of her meager existence as a dress maker in the outskirts of Tijuana where she lives with her little brother and father. She and her best friend Zuzu work their way into the line of women vying for the contest title. After winning entry into the pageant Laura reluctantly agrees to go to a sleazy nightclub with Zuzu. In the club's toilets she witnesses the covert entry of an organized drugs cartel led by Lino Valdez (Noe Hernandez). Lino is finds Laura to be attractive and smart, and allows her to escape. However, when Laura reports her missing friend Zuzu to a corrupt Mexican police officer, she finds herself delivered back into the hands of Lino, and entangled ever deeper in a vicious drugs war._ She is used as a mule to transport drug money across the border, returning to full fledged gang war. Lino uses her physically and then keeps his promise to have her crowned Miss Baja California, but the title and the events that follow lead to horrors and alienation Laura never dreamed possible.

Writers Mauricio Katz and writer/director Gerardo Naranjo push this expos of just how all consuming the drug traffic problem is at the border. It is terrifying and though Laura seems to be a helpless obeying victim throughout the tale, she represents just how futile it must be to attempt to stand against the atrocious crimes being committed. The power of the film is its willingness to show that both side of the war on drugs - gangs, police, DEA agents, and population - are at fault for allowing this outrage to continue. But business is business and the film hints at how hopeless the situation is. Stephanie Sigman emerges as an actress of importance and her part in this film will remain indelibly burned on the minds of the viewers. We should all see this film.

Loosely based on true events, the film follows a young Mexican beauty queen who becomes wrapped up with a gang of drug-runners as she competes for her crown. Though it received just a little buzz and opened for a short time in limited release, I found a lot to praise about the movie; it's a loaded film whose subject matter is already heavy, but is made even more powerful by some interesting directorial choices and an assured filmmaking style. Miss Bala is an unflinching, timely look at a side of Mexican culture much talked about but rarely explored in this fashion.",1330387200,7,757,4.656716417910448
