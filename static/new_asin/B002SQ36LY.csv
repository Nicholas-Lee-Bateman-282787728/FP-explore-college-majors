But i disagree with all who say the acting is bad.  It is mixed but mostly good.  Can decent acting save a lousy plot?  Not really, but I thought that aside from the young woman trying to find her sister, everyone else was very good, and even that young lady was not altogether bad, just inconsistent with to many twisted facial expressions.  Michael Madsen (the main bad guy) was excellent, as usual.  If you like decent acting but don't care about the plot, give this a try.",1462406400,,624,4.336206896551724

8379502,1,B002SQ36LY,"I agree that aside from the underwater views of the caverns--which were great--this film sucks big time.  The 'hero' is an alcoholic air-head but with a stud's muscular tanned body, and the shapely female is simply stupid with a death wish as she teams up with the boozer helping her to find her sister who's been kidnapped by Mayan treature hunters.  The acting--if you can call it that--is sub-par all the way, and the undoubtedly low budget for this movie is the anchor that--for me--sinks this unrealistic, but colorful kaleidoscope in a sea of mud.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS.",1278460800,2,574,4.777777777777778
8379503,5,B002SQ36LY,"Do yourself a favor and give this movie a try. No sci-fi effects, not much bad language and very few adult situations. No nudity. Sounds boring? Wrong! The story keeps your attention. The tropical settings are uplifting and beautiful. Most important however the actors in this movie are oh so sexy!  I would be surprised if they are not in some future big budget hollywood blockbuster in the near future.  I am  parent who has a hard time finding a movie that me and my daughter both like  and can watch together without me cringing in fear of the next nude scene or barrage of bad language. This is an  adult movie that is suitable for your teenage children and you to watch together. TRY IT YOU WILL LIKE IT!",1275091200,,710,4.430769230769231
8379504,1,B002SQ36LY,"Terrible acting...stupid plot.....couldnt even sit through the whole movie...only watched bits while channel surfing. Best way to watch it if u must.
They must have offered Michael Madsen and Keith david a free vacation!",1273017600,,220,5.5
8379505,1,B002SQ36LY,"This Film has nothing to say about the mysterious Maya civilization.
Wish I could rate it as negative.

Poor cast and there was very very ridiculous plot.
It is more boring than a silent movie.
The actors are horrible and know nothing about acting.
Don't watch it even if you get a free rental!!!",1270339200,,296,4.481481481481482
8379506,5,B002SQ36LY,"This film will surprise you with a great cast, locations, and surprisingly a good plot. Good mix of action and comedy. Don't pass this movie up!",1261958400,2,144,4.576923076923077
