8130867,2,B000GDH9KK,"I bought this at a clearance price; I may have overpaid.  In a post-apocalyptic world containing (as far as anyone knows) one continent and four large offshore islands, one of the continental powers, Megaronia, uses rediscovered ancient technology to conquer first the continent, then the four islands.  These four islands were able to hold out for awhile thanks to the efforts of one of their kings who put together a pirate fleet, but eventually Megaronia's metal ironclads won the day, and the entire defeated royal family was butchered, save a single baby prince spared and raised as a hostage.  Roughly a decade and a half later mysterious prophecies are resurfacing along with magical signs and wonders, prophecies about the reappearance of an all powerful god ship that had been responsible for the apocalypse.  Soon various and sundry ambitious types are seeking out said god ship, the titular Ellcia, along with the female pirate Eira and her crew of imbeciles.

This probably sounds at least a little interesting, which is what I thought; unfortunately the result is stomach-turningly awful.  Start with poor, occasionally downright ugly character design, and add in eye hurting colors.  Next, make most of the heroes annoyingly whiny morons that will have you rooting for the villains.  (Sure, they may be genocidal maniacs, but if they can just wipe out the heroes, they will have improved the gene pool tremendously.)  In fact the only signs of intelligent life come from the villains; their plans may be brutal and murderous, but at least they have plans.  The heroes barely have a clue about what is going on and largely win by default because quarreling villains take each other out.  Add a climax which makes&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hamlet/dp/B00005JLCI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hamlet</a>&nbsp;look like a feelgood family comedy and a what-the-heck-happened, oh-no-these-idiots-lived-to-breed ending.  Finally, give it the worst English dubbing I've ever heard.  (Even the music was bad!)

Frankly, this quarter century old premise might be worth revisiting and remaking; any new attempt could only be better.

Note: Thankfully, the title is misleading, dating to its VHS release days.  There is no more beyond the four episodes on this single OVA DVD, and God be praised for that!",1466121600,,2352,5.43801652892562
8130868,3,B000GDH9KK,"What we have here is a rather dated anime and it shows. The premise itself isn't bad, but it unfortunately suffers from a lot of the faults of early 90's anime.

On the visual side the color palette they use seems completely out of place for the series. The worst part though is the design of the characters. The mouth on the priest is just frightening looking and the king looks like a clown. Couple those with the butch princess and a number of other uninspired designs and it just looks bad. The animation itself isn't too bad for its day though and after awhile you just get used to the character designs.

The story is a bit interesting, although it's also somewhat of a tired overdone cliche. Expect people to get killed off in the show, as was pretty typical for OAV's and films of the time. I have nothing against it occurring, but sometimes it just seems like they do it just to do it as if it's part of the formula. The worst part of the series is the ending. I won't go into too much details; but needless to say it's pretty disappointing and it's just hard to see that anything was even accomplished aside from a whole lot of people dying.

It's not an atrocious series, but if it weren't for me having to fill the 10 DVD quota to get the deal at TRSI, I would have definitely passed on this one.",1203033600,2,1308,4.266129032258065
8130869,4,B000GDH9KK,"The aging King Nabosu of Megaronia has conquered most of the known islands around his kingdom due to finding an ancient technology left over from a previous destroyed civilization. Now his eye starts to drift to the land of Eija, one of the last islands that has not fully submitted to his rule. But when his court priest tells him of a prophecy of a ""Chosen One"" who will destroy Megaronia with ""God's Ship"" he doesn't take the dire oracle with much seriousness. His daughter, Princess Crystel, on the other hand starts to drool at the thought of acquiring this powerful weapon that is said to have already destroyed Megaronia once before! With the king of Eija in tow as a hostage, Crystel, along with the deadly warrior Felkis begin the search for the divine ship. Meanwhile, a group of pirates from Eija, led by the feisty girl Eira are on a collision course with Crystel and Megaronia, as a fateful series of events lands them control of God's Ship, named Ellcia. Eira will have to decide what to do with the ship, whether to use it to protect her country and save the king, or reduce Megaronia to dust. It doesn't help that an evil spirit from ancient times is moving in the world after being accidentally released by Eira's crew.

Since it came out in 1993, Ellcia has a lot of bad habits left over from old 80's anime. Mainly, The character designs are pretty awful. The costumes especially can leave your eyes hurting a little and Eira's tuft of miscolored hair on her forehead almost stole the show. But if you can get past the dated designs, the story and character personalities are pretty interesting. The story, while familiar, brings its own chaotic and forward-moving energy that makes up for some contrived circumstances. The pirate crew is mostly there for comedy relief and they do their job well. I really liked Eira because she's not interested in God's Ship except for protecting those she cares about. She really has no ambitions to subjugate the world with it like Crystel. The animation itself is well done and gets you nostalgic about the days when computer animation didn't exist in anime.  An oldie but a goodie.",1159747200,4,2140,4.673740053050398
