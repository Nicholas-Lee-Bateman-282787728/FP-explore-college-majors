Dr. Bashir is my favorite character on DS9 so I bought this episode thinking it was about him.  It is actually about Jake Sisko, but I was not disappointed.  Cirroc Lofton turns in a strong performance as the troubled Jake.  The young Sisko matures a lot in this episode and discovers a special kind of bravery within himself as he makes a confession to his father at the end.",1009670400,2,1358,4.461538461538462
7903145,1,B000003K8S,"Jake is doing an interview with Doctor Bashir on the frontlines of the Klingon-Starfleet warzone. When the Kligon's attack in brutal fashion Jake  has to change his opinion of war, it is not just the glamourous ship to  ship battles but the gritty trench wars in which innocent people die.
The storyline was good and had potential but wasn't given the fully  bloody, gritty treatment it deserved and would've sent a better message  about war, the true message it was trying to deliver. One of the few  episodes given to Jake which he acts great in, pitty no one else does!",966729600,,572,4.623762376237623
