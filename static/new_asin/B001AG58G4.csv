8277296,1,B001AG58G4,"This is so poorly done that if I hadn't read the BMF book by Mara Shalhoup I would not even be able to follow the story.  Actually, there is no story on this DVD - its just disjointed, doubletalk that mentions money, drug trafficking and living the high life - there is no timeline, there is no history of how the BMF was formed or even what they were about.  Martin Luther King has more air time on this video than Terry Flenory - so what does that tell you?  Read Shalhoup's book if you want to know the story.  Don't waste your time or money on this.",1281052800,,553,4.092592592592593
