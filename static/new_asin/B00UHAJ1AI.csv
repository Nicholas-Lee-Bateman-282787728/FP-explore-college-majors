7039416,4,B00UHAJ1AI,"Never has lacing food with rat poison been given such an unforgivably funny tone. This is Wild Tales, a Spanish language movie nominated for an Academy Award, and for good reason, as its one of the most ironically likable satires in recent memory. To my knowledge, theres no place to stream or buy this movie digitally yet, but that may no longer be the case when this $35 title gets released on Blu-Ray. Thats definitely a high price to pay, and even at a lower cost, regular moviegoers should understand the unusual setup and attitude of this film before making the purchase.

First off, Wild Tales is not a singular movie, but rather a compilation of six black comedy short films. While none of them are connected with each other by plot in any way, they share a similar idea of exacting ones revenge in the worst/best way possible. All of the main characters seem to be morally crooked and takes things to extreme measures, so director Dami&aacute;n Szifron certainly benefits from taking all of this in a comedic tone. But I cant promise that it won't offend in some way  particularly the opening short that might leave a bad taste in the mouths of the easily offended who've watched the news over the past year.

From a filmmaking standpoint, theres a lot to enjoy about this anthology. Every cruel joke, rude reaction, and over-the-top twist of fate here is all well timed and well invoked. Its refreshing to see a comedy of this nature be outfitted with this kind of love for cinematic style and screenwriting wit. Sure, most of the characters feel unrealistically cruel and outright insufferable, but their impulse to explode justifiably backfires  actually quite literally in one instance.

As far as narrative goes, the latter half of the movie  consisting of three longer and slower paced shorts  is not as strong as the first half. Maybe it is because of how unexpectedly great the first three were, but even with something like the final premise, it seems to simply rehash tropes about the differences between men and women we've seen many times before. That doesn't mean you should skip the last one, but don't expect much originality. My personal favorite might be the third short, in which we bear witness to one hilariously glorified consequence of giving another driver the bird.

Wild Tales is well deserving of its title, as all six shorts are proudly irreverent, with dark humor a step above what some may have seen from the recent Scorsese film The Wolf of Wall Street. Theres your reference point, readers. And like The Wolf of Wall Street, theres an overall lesson one may take out of all the hilarious scenarios and bleak outcomes: if you've ever thought about acting on your darkest instincts, dont. Detractors of black comedies need not see this movie, as it presents everything enjoyable about the genre in a very unique direction. This excellent foreign film is a reminder that some people just aren't meant to take matters into their own hands  even if they tell you otherwise.",1430438400,3,3008,4.7915057915057915

The film takes these scenarios to outrageous limits that we can only imagine doing ourselves. From start to finish, the scenes move swiftly and often with great suspense. No time is wasted, as the situations become clear almost immediately. The acting, directing, cinematography and editing are perfect. The final segment, taking place entirely during a wedding is an incredible combination of comedy, suspense, and drama that touches the heart and soul.",1524355200,,608,5.548387096774194

7039434,4,B00UHAJ1AI,"These are six wonderful little 20 minute stories about the perils of revenge -- most but not all of those seeking revenge suffered as much or more than their opponents.

But three of the characters won big, or at least were better off than they were before, and for one character the price may well have been worth the effort it took to arrange all those travel itineraries.

Very impressive visual effects and very well played and directed.

Every actor was so convincing that it made you sympathize and with them throughout the whole movie and prompt and internal and external dialogue About all sorts of moral and ethical things we are faced in life and reminds me if that quote, ""every action you make has an equal or greater reaction.""

7039511,3,B00UHAJ1AI,"It's been several days since I watched this film, and I'm still trying to define my opinion in an objective manner. I'd give it 5 stars for artistic and technical brilliance. The actors were amazingly good. I'll look for them in other movies. However, since this is a forum to express personal opinion, and not a professional review, it's valid to base a critique on subject matter as well, and in that, Wild Tales gets a zero, zed, naught. Wow factor (it's absolutely compelling) raises it up a bit, so 3 stars overall.

This is not a comedy, as the DVD cover photos might imply, and this is not a celebration of the best of the human spirit, to say the least. If you have a sensitive nature, this film is definitely not for you. These are six separate cautionary tales of the escalation of revenge, from the first incendiary spark of passion through to an inevitable, often horrendous and violent, end. There are some instances that are indeed funny, in a really twisted way. When I did laugh, it was one of those "" I can't believe I laughed at that"" kind of things. I don't know how to say schadenfreude in Spanish but I think it might have made a better title.

The film is very disturbing; I'm assuming this was the intention. Wild Tales does serve to remind us of what we're capable of, in sometimes tiny incremental steps, once we choose go down a dark path which our better instincts warn us (hopefully) against. It's those incremental steps that are most interesting; intellect vs. emotion, a choice made at every juncture that moves each tale forward.

 I'm not discouraging anyone from watching this, but once you do, you may never see things quite the same way as before. These scenes will stay in my head for a long time.  A week later and I'm still cringing whenever I hear a plane overhead. I'll likely also decline any future wedding invitations, and keep all fingers clamped firmly to my steering wheel whenever I drive.

I appreciate that Amazon offers so many international films, especially with subtitles, whether or not I agree with the subject matter, and I hope they continue to do so.",1471046400,7,2109,4.595744680851064

7039526,4,B00UHAJ1AI,"WILD TALES took me by surprise in its exploration of six stories dealing with Revenge, Rage and Retribution. These were stories that I did not expect, yet like a good book, you want to see how it ends. Each story has a bizarre twist. The very first story is comically absurd until you see it mirrors a real-life tragic event that happened last year. And this film was made before the event happened. Fiction and Reality collide here.

There are stories of road rage and revenge on a man who ruined the lives of a family. It's fun to see how Argentine actor Ricardo Darin (one of my favorite actors) handles unjustified parking tickets. One thought-provoking story places us in the shoes of a wealthy man surrounded by a greedy lawyer and city official. Should he pay to protect his careless son who caused an unintentional tragedy? Finally, watch a bride go totally crazy at her wedding reception after finding out her new husband has a secret. This is one twisted wedding reception.

Although WILD TALES won't appear to everyone, it just have an air of creativity with a touch of TWILIGHT ZONE and its bizarre twists. Some of these endings are so poetically justified. Above all, the actors are all in top form. This is a top-notch cast of fine actors from Spain and Argentina. It's completely different than most films so why not add a bit of variety to your movie-viewing list?",1467676800,3,1380,4.651639344262295

7039532,4,B00UHAJ1AI,"This excellent film from Argentina caught my attention when it was nominated for an Oscar.  Just now catching up with it, I was a bit surprised not only for its structure but with the quality of the production (excellent).  Assembled into 6 different short stories by director/writer Damian Szifron, it differs in that none are connected with the other.  Well, other than they each have a common thread of escalating conflict and revenge.  In fact, as I was watching the movie, I thought Revenge would be the better title.

The first story is Pasternak which takes place on a plane.  Small talk between passengers conclude that the whole plane knows someone named Paternak including a former girlfriend, a dismissive music critic and an elementary teacher.  It turns out hes also a flight attendant and has commandeered the cockpit.

One of my favorites is El Mas Fuerte where a well-dressed man in an Audi comes upon a field hand driving a beat up car, driving slowly in the fast lane.  After honking and flashing his lights don't work, the Audi driver passes on the right, rolls down his window, curses at the other guy and flashes the bird.  A few miles down the road, the Audi driver has a flat.  Things escalate from there.

Las Ratas features a waitress in a quiet diner who recognizes the lone customer as the man who drove her father to commit suicide.  He doesnt recognize her but is abusive and dismissive.  The cook, hearing the story has something special planned for his order.

An explosive engineer in Bombita has his car towed away even though he wasn't in a yellow zone.  Hes upset and doesnt want to pay for the tow or the parking fine.  When it happens again, he cant take it anymore.

In La Propuesta the teenage son of a wealthy man driving the family BMW strikes a pregnant woman, killing both.  When he confesses to his parents they come up with a plan to assign blame to the gardener.  He agrees but with the $500K payment that goes with it.  The familys attorney and then the district attorney want a cut too.

Finally, Hasta Que la Muerte Nos Separe closes out the movie with a wedding.  At the reception the bride finds out her fianc has cheated on her with one of his business associates who is at the wedding.  She doesnt take it well.

The common thread as you might surmise is escalating anger and reaches rage, only humans can feel.  While the film has some violence and some sex, it falls more in line with a dark comedy.  In each vignette we can see how common misunderstandings of everyday life can become catastrophic.  Highly recommended.",1465084800,,2575,4.6

7039584,4,B00UHAJ1AI,"This is a great movie! All well known and respected actors from Argentina. This movie in on the dark kind of humor, very ""Tarantinoesque"" minus the excessive sight of blood , in my opinion. It has English subtitles and even though you still can grasp (or imagine) the background for the characters and scenarios, a LOT is lost with these. I'm sorry, but some key fundamentals to support each character's rage gets lost in translation. The one with the ""Road Rage"" is a perfect example, the insult from one of the characters to the other one doesn't get the deep racism, social disparities, and real meaning in the translated version in English (FYI there are NO rednecks in Argentina) Find the definition in English for ""Cabecita negra or cabeza negra"" and you'll see what I mean.
Plus you have to, or try to, be familiar with the frustration that grows deep inside of you when you live in certain South American countries where bureaucracy, corruption and power from the wealthy rule the everyday of society. This is very clear for some of the stories here (the engineer and Negotiations) and maybe a dash on the other stories.
I'm from Argentina, and I watched this movie while reading the subtitles( interpreting and translation is my field as well) and I feel sorry for those who will loose the profound meaning (idiom and social) of some of the stories and characters. As a native, I can connect in a different way with this movie; but this does not mean that you have to speak Spanish (from Argentina) and/or be familiar with Latin America Cultural and Social disparities in order to enjoy it as much as I did.

7039607,2,B00UHAJ1AI,"Wild Tales  Sony Picture Classics  2014  Rated R

This film by an Argentinian director, in Spanish but with English subtitling, got an Academy Award nomination for best foreign picture of the year.  I'm glad it didn't win; most of the reviewers loved it but in Siskel/Ebert style, I'll take the opposite position and say why I give it a thumbs down.  No spoiler alerts here (unlike some reviews).

It presents a series of situations, not related to each other.  Each one depicts a person enraged by life in some way.  Exactly why and exactly how it plays out of course varies in each case.  So it's like the film version of short skits.

I tried desperately to grasp some underlying unity in the skits or some deep insights into human nature.  I tried in vain.  For a while I started thinking each one is going to begin with the main character in some kind of transportation: a plane, a car etc.  But no, the final skit violates that idea as it takes place at a wedding reception.

One underlying structural motif seems to be that each skit is a little longer than the one before.  The film opens with a pretty short skit taking place on an airplane, and the final skit, the wedding reception, was about the longest with roughly a half hour length.

An R rating seems a little excessive to me; I feel sure I've seen PG-13 or at least NA-17 films that are rougher than this one.  Yes there's serious fighting sometimes, and yes there are at least a couple of clear allusions to good old heterosexual activities, but without actually baring any private parts.  The most graphic it got in that regard was a man's bums.

I suppose some people do find this film funny; I'm just not one who finds tales of rage, jealousy, revenge or that kind of thing amusing as a rule.  Perhaps some people enjoy the surprise endings that many of the skits entail but on the whole I'd have liked some more coherence.

I wondered why or maybe HOW he strung these togetherare they all based on stories he's heard?  Did he invent them whole cloth?  In any case the acting is generally competent (one male actor whose name I didn't write down did perhaps the best job at showing quiet fury), the cinematography and score did not strike me as anything exceptional.  If you set your expectations low or if you are one who enjoys very dark humor perhaps you'll like it better than I, but this gives a general sense of what you'll encounter.

7039657,4,B00UHAJ1AI,"Personal perception accounts for much of our 'truth' in pretty much any situation.  In Wild Tales, Perception is a bitch.

I was given a heads-up to check out this movie by someone that isn't shy of violence and strange turns of events. Even if you don't like subtitles, I estimate only about half of the movie really needs them. In fact, the Road Rage segment speaks for itself. It is brutal and awesome. There are deaths in this dark film, but surprisingly there are no guns; obviously not from 'Murica.

Rather, this gem is from Argentine under the title 'Relatos Salvajes' (2014). Although I was hoping all the short stories would be tied together, the only defining string is scenes that go from bad to worse.  Well, actually 'Bombita' and 'Hasta que la muerte nos separe' end on more positive notes, but I won't give anything away.

There are some interesting camera shots, but overall it is pretty standard cinematography. The scenes, stories, and settings are all diverse and overall it is very well done. 'Pasternak's' freeze-frame ending is brilliant. I was almost expecting to see Tim Roth lurking in the background.

Little Bomb was completely predictable but utterly satisfying. The Strongest is the most brutal of the mix and frakken awesome.

Overall a quality, fun, violent and dark film.",1446249600,,1304,4.9

7039659,3,B00UHAJ1AI,"I was curious about this movie with all the wonderful reviews. I wanted to like it but by the end of the six stories I could not fully recommend it especially to buy it like I did. Like others have mentioned before the first story was simply amazing with the plane episode. Then it went downhill from there. It was a little too lunatic and a little too over the edge for me. It was gripping at times, fascinating at times, but it simply got too violent when it was over. It could have been much more gripping without the very violent acts. It is worth watching once. There is no other movie that I've seen that fits this type of subject matter. I'm glad that I watched it. I just regret that I bought a blu-ray copy along with two used DVD copies to give to my family to watch before I had even watched it myself. You can make your own opinions about the movie. It is certainly very different and like I said often fascinating in ways that you cannot imagine. Three stars for its creativity...",1445817600,,993,4.2592592592592595
7039660,5,B00UHAJ1AI,"These little vignettes on the topic of revenge are absolutely great. The subtitles enhance the stories and force you to pay attention to the characters and their facial exprssions, and gestures. There was not a single vignette that I did not like. The road rage one strikes a cord, and made me laugh in delight. The rat poisoning story was was also great. The plane full of people that had all abused and mistreated the pilot was filled with great acting, and emotion.

7039710,5,B00UHAJ1AI,"Wild tales is an Argentine anthology of short films meditating the theme of revenge.  When is it justified?  When is it excessive?  The short plot lines which comprise the segments are vividly entertaining, doubling as dark comedy.  An impressive aspect of the director's art is to maintain some sense of levity and dark humor in the context of rather egregious tragic situations.  In one segment, an escalating incident of road rage results in the mutual destruction of the protagonists/antagonists, exhibiting the pointless destructive nature of a cycle of revenge.  Another examines the relative value of civic honor.  A poor gardener takes the fall for the son of his neighbor, with unforeseen consequences.  One's civic honor is worth more than gold!  The final sequence gives us something of a glimmer of hope (sort of) when feuding newlyweds resolve their differences.  Note these lite spoilers shouldn't interfere with your enjoyment of the film.

  A friend of mine lived in South America for a decade or so and recounted several similar tales to me, much along the lines of the stories in this movie.  He said these stories were probably loosely based on real events.  Revenge appears to be a big theme of South American culture.",1443571200,,1239,5.0344827586206895
7039741,5,B00UHAJ1AI,"This film is bazaar.  The opening could have been an inspiration to a suicidal act that happened about a year after its release in Europe and cost many lives.  That makes the film interesting enough.  The rest may not be for everyone, but the film is a work of art, something that probably could not have been made in the US, is a portrait of much that people have to deal with, and is definitely worth a viewing if you can handle social critique, are open minded and ready for a shock or six.",1443398400,,493,4.223404255319149

7039743,4,B00UHAJ1AI,"I love the concept. I found some of the stories more engaging than others. The problem with short stories is that there's sometimes not enough time to care about the characters and really feel their despair and visceral urge for revenge. ""Until Death Do Us Part"" was most effective, because everybody can empathize with a bride on her wedding day. The BPD reception was something I'll never forget! Probably everyone can relate to the road rage sketch and will enjoy living vicariously (and laughing in shock) through the fantasy. ""The Proposal"" was a little too long--the least satisfying and most boring of the tales. Revolved mostly around greed and entitlement, which don't interest me. ""Pasternak"" was interesting but too unlikely to make a serious impact (no pun intended). ""Rats"" was pretty good. The one about the demolition guy was okay. Honestly, I might give this 3.5 stars. But I'm not at all sorry I rented it.",1443225600,2,923,4.923076923076923

I love the format -  a series of short stories telling compelling tales of personal revenge. This is dramatic, _not_ an uplifting, feel good movie...but it's brilliant and makes an impression. This is why I prefer foreign films - they focus on characters, dialog and the plot is interesting and intelligent...they aren't formulaic, predictable dumbed-down stories that use big productions and fancy effects to make up for an anemic story line.

We had no idea what to expect.  But before the opening credits had rolled, we were laughing out loud and acknowledging that this was going to be very different.

The only common theme throughout each of the six short stories is revenge and it is a dark comedy, so it may not be everyone's 'cup of tea'.  But if you like Hitchcock's sometimes morbid sense of humor, you may like this movie.

Do yourself a favor, try not to watch the trailer before viewing the whole movie.  The trailer kinda gives away some of the story lines and hence some of the surprises.",1440028800,2,725,4.4961832061068705

7039982,4,B00UHAJ1AI,"Dami&aacute;n Szifr&oacute;n is the Argentine writer director (with producer backup from Agust&iacute;n and Pedro Almod&oacute;var) who presents us with a series of stories that present the human animal and how it reacts to stress: six dark stories, involving six savage situations full of revenge and the dark sides of human beings - dreadful revenge to hated persons, accidental or intentional, dangerous and unexpected arguments, misunderstandings, and horrid  confrontations that permanently change the lives of people involved.

The film is advertised as wildly funny, and perhaps if we all view human foibles and anger management crises as food for laughter then the term comedy is appropriate. What the audience sees are situations most of us confront daily (on a much more quiet level)  frustrations with politics, misunderstandings of conversations, immediate flash hate responses like road rage, jealousies mishandled, bullying  and because we can relate to each of these stories the film works.

Briefly, the six stories have been summarized as 1) ""Pasternak"": one model and a music critic in a plane find that they have a common acquaintance called Pasternak. Soon they discover that every passenger and crew on board know Pasternak. Cosmic coincidence? (2) ""The Rats"": a waitress of a diner recognizes her client as the loan shark that caused a tragedy in her family. The cook suggests mixing rat poison in his food, but she refuses. But the cook decides to proceed in her plan. When his son arrives, the waitress tries to fix the situation. (3) ""The Strongest"": Two drivers on a lone highway have an argument with tragic consequences. (4) ""Little Bomb"": The demolition engineer has his car towed by a truck for parking in a wrong place and he has an argument with the employee of the towing company. This event destroys his private and professional life, and he plots revenge against the corrupt towing company and the City Hall. (5) ""The Proposal"": The reckless hit-and-run son of a wealthy family hits and kills a pregnant woman. He wakes up his parents and his father calls the lawyer. They propose to pay the groundskeeper to take the blame. Soon the father discovers that he is victim of extortion of his lawyer and the detective in charge of the investigation. What will be his decision? (6) ""Until Death Do Us Apart"": During the wedding party, the wife discovers that her husband has cheated her with one of the guests and decides to payback.

Stylish photography, a fine cast of basically unknown actors (with major exceptions) and excellent direction make this macabre human comedy work. This won top honors in ArgentinaGrady Harp, August 15",1438387200,8,2664,5.098623853211009

The first episode is mildly clever, but the ensuing stories are variations of the righteous revenge theme, and become tiresome after a while.  I told my wife she wouldn't like it, and by the third episode, she had had enough.  I said ""Basta"" as well.

However, if you're like us, and just the memory of coy songs and cute children starts your teeth rotting and your brain cells shutting down, you'll celebrate this film. Finally, a feel-good movie that isn't about feeling good! It's about those tuna cans of suspicion called airplanes. It's about that crazy driver in the next lane.

7040153,5,B00UHAJ1AI,"""Wild Tales"" is a Spanish-language collection of six short films about people who are - for one reason or another - very angry with one another.  It's one of those movies that got a lot of attention on the festival circuit last year.  But as long as Hollywood is being run by empty suits, movies like this are not going get much of a chance to attract an audience in the USA.  It's American commercial distribution was - shall we say - minimal.

It has neither giant robots nor superheroes, but it certainly does not skimp on the action.  Planes crash, firearms are brandished, cars and buildings blow up and the film ends with a wedding sequence that makes the infamous ""red wedding"" bloodbath from ""Game of Thrones"" look like the silly fan-boy ballet that it was.  Don't get me wrong - there's very little blood and gore here.  But although nobody gets decapitated in Wild Tales, the characters are made out of much more substantial stuff.  And that's what makes this a 5-star movie.

It was written and directed by Damin Szifron - which is a name that I did not know coming into the film.  But if this is any indication of his potential, we'll be hearing a lot from him in the future.  The producers are Pedro & Agustn Almodvar, who are better known for writing and producing films like ""Tie Me Up!  Tie me Down!"" which was one of the best black comedies of 1989.  It's clear that they have an eye for talent.",1436313600,,1412,4.426356589147287

7040165,3,B00UHAJ1AI,"Found the first 'tale' interesting...somewhat of an old Twilight Zone feel.  The 'wedding' tale equaling entertaining, but a bit over the top to the point of almost losing me.

Each one of these films told an intriguing story that will have most viewers either laughing or with their hands cupped in front of their faces in amazement at the end. The actors did a great job and the film quality was both interesting and moving. Our bet is most people will love this!!

We took the additional step of actually buying this film through Amazon so we can show it to our friends - one film at a time with a good Martini will make a great night.",1435536000,,541,4.201923076923077

7040243,5,B00UHAJ1AI,"This review is of the Bluray version with the bonus features. I was provided with a screener for an objective review. Note that Amazon combines reviews of theatrical and steaming versions (which have no bonues) with Bluray so I always recommend that buyers note which format is being reviewed.

I saw this wonder Argentinian comedy (produced, but not directed by, Pedro Almodovar) in the theaters and anxiously awaited the home video version. When the film starts, there are no titles and the first (of six) story drags you in. It's still my favorite episode. I won't give away any of the plot - that would spoil the fun.  Watching all six again, I found that some held up better than others but the BD is worth five stars because, if you don't like one of the stories you can go to the next and not have to sit through 2 hours.

I found influences of other major American movies in some of these. A few  - like the ""diner"" episode -reminded me of David Lynch films (""Blue Velvet"", ""Twin Peaks"" and had similar music). One - the ""road rage"" episode has a LOT of the ""comic violence"" of Russ Meyer films (but no buxom naked women).
Now to the BD. When I saw the film (which is in Spanish with subtitles) in the theaters, the subtitles were easy to read. On the BD I found that often the white typeface was sometimes on a light background and strained my eyes. (This on a 42"" screen).

There are two bonus features. One short one (6 minutes or so) was a short session with the director at the Toronto International Film Festival. That didn't add much for me. The other is a longer, 24-minute, interview with the director and comments from the cast about creating the film. It is in Spanish with subtitles.

The film's initial release garnered mixed reviews but I loved it. I'm glad I got to see it again and can recommend it to anyone interested in ""quirky"" comedies.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7040244,5,B00UHAJ1AI,"""Relatos Salvajes"" is an audacious collection of short stories from Argentina (English captions) which garnered a ten-minute standing ovation at Cannes and was nominated for Best Foreign Film at the Oscars. Written and directed by Damin Szifron (lots of Argentinian television), this starts with some memorable wildlife photography, shot with elegance and described by a playful voiceover. This sets the tone.

Rather than concentrate on the wonderful actors, I will instead give you hints about the unpredictable (and humorous) short stories; some are shorter (and darker) than others, but none leave you wondering about what happened. This is a refreshing change from many of the short stories we have seen or read. What a treat!

  * Let's start with Pasternak, or what I call ""Free Ticket."" We meet an assortment of passengers on a commercial airline who are strangers to one another. A sense of discovery is personal to start with and as our suspicions grow, we laugh at the contrived stories. That's all I'll say...
  * In ""The Rats"" (""Las Ratas"") we are in a late-night diner where a waitress greets a rude, demanding guest. As WE discover why she becomes so upset, so does the cook...
  * Road to Hell, or ""El ms fuerte"" is one I call ""Road Rage."" A businessman in an upscale car tries to pass a derelict clunker. The driver keeps swerving into his path and frustrating him, so when he finally passes him, he calls him an uncomplimentary name. Everything is fine until he gets a flat tire.
  * Bombita is one I call ""Tow-Away Zone."" We meet a successful demolitions engineer who is reminded by his wife to pick up a birthday cake on his way home. While in the bakery, his car is towed and our story begins. For anyone who has dealt with an implacable bureaucracy, this one is for you!
  * La Propuesta or The Deal,"" I call ""Hit and Run."" An irresponsible teenage driver hits and kills a pedestrian. Here we watch his wealthy family as it maneuvers to keep him out of jail, even as his conscience begins to bother him.
  * The final segment (I couldn't find a name for it), I call ""The Wedding Party."" This goofy, hilarious story takes place at a wedding reception. It's obvious that the bride and groom are delirious with joy and the elaborate party is very, very upscale. Just wait until she dials a guitar player whom her fianc had called a week or so earlier.

You won't recognize most of the faces...maybe Ricardo Darn (""The Secret in Their Eyes"")... as a result it's easier to suspend disbelief, even though this is a brilliant and convincing collection of actors. This film examines the human animal and how it reacts to stressful situations.

SEE THIS MOVIE!",1431734400,51,2673,4.703862660944206
7040245,4,B00UHAJ1AI,"Whats it about?

In this Oscar-nominated anthology of six darkly funny short stories, ordinary people carry out violent acts of revenge.

What did I think?

Szifrn has created a compelling feature-length experience out of very different and surprising short films. Each one steadily increases in length and scale but is also completely self-contained, so the whole film flies by, but youll be picking your favourites as you leave the theater. Its a fun, classy, and bloody affair that you should go into knowing as little about as possible.",1431648000,3,540,5.113636363636363
7040246,5,B00UHAJ1AI,"This is one of the most fantastic enjoyable movies I've ever see, No wonder it got so many awards and nominations. My brother came to visit so I took him to see it. So now I've seen it twice and I'll but the DVD.

7040247,5,B00UHAJ1AI,"You know you have a creepy disturbing movie when the first movie eerily foretells a plane tragedy to nearly identical events. Please don't let the tragedy detract you from viewing what should have been the academy award winner for best foreign film this year. This Movie covers various short stories (relatos salvajes) involving very different people with very different stories. The stories eventual unravel disturbing events that vary wildly ala twighlight zone fame but more morbid. Each story is well done and the actors are top notch! If you want a nonstop wild ride with well written and acted creepy stories, this is it. Highly recommend this Argentinian gem.",1431043200,,666,5.1192660550458715
7040248,5,B00UHAJ1AI,"For those most part, anthology movies tend to be quite uneven in large part because each story usually has its own director. Plus, the stories themselves are only tenuously connected in terms of theme. ""Wild Tales"" however, is a brilliant exception since Damin Szifrn wrote and directed all the stories. Plus, while each story is independent of the other in the sense that the characters do not overlap, there is a very strong theme that runs through each of them which is part desperation, part chaos and all dark humor.

It helps that the first story set aboard an airliner is so strong with a fantastic ending that sets the mood for the rest of the tales. All six stories are well told with solid performances all around, although the two most notable after the pre-title sequence may be ""The Strongest"" which may be the ultimate example of road rage put on the screen and finale, ""Until Death Do Us Part"" which is arguably the wedding reception from hell. However, this is not to downplay the other stories each of which has their own merits and are all entertaining.

Whether ""Wild Tales"" will spark a new line of anthology movies is difficult to say, but what Damin Szifrn has managed to do is revive the concept which was augmented by the Oscar nomination and demonstrate that there is still plenty of interest in this particular type of movie.",1431043200,4,1351,4.6722689075630255
7040249,5,B00UHAJ1AI,"""Wild Tales"" earned a well-deserved Oscar Nomination for Best Foreign Film in 2014, and it would have been entirely deserving of top honors had it actually won.

Argentinian director Damien Szifron's film is a mix between the sensibilities of Pedro Almodovar, who served as a Producer on the film, and Quentin Tarantino's freewheeling style, which may have served as an inspiration.  The movie contains six short films set in Argentina, primarily in and around Buenos Aires, that are united by (mostly) darkly comic revenge plots.  Each of the films has an element of poetic justice, so even though the treatments can be pretty violent, there is an almost moral dimension to the action.

These films are also a master class in the subtle uses of sound and camera placement in the service of telling stories.  There's a shift between the subjective viewpoint of some characters and the more ""God's eye"" view that happens multiple times within each of these stories that helps to create psychological distance and identification with the characters and their foibles in very subtle ways.  These are the kind of things that may not be obvious in a first viewing, but after repeat viewings there are levels to the stories and the cinematic treatment that reward repeat viewings.  So, in addition to having great, and well condensed stories, the treatment of those stories also sets the film apart from the typical weekend fare.  Movies like ""Wild Tales"" don't come around very often, so it's a real treat to see them when you have a chance.  Can't wait to see the film again!",1430697600,28,1571,4.89811320754717
