339244,4,6301608534,"These prices are getting out of hand.  Their are no extras on this dvd and it retails for almost $30!  This is a $15 release, and that's being generous.  I will hold out to find it on sale or  used.  Yes this is a terrific movie and it introduced me to Bob Newhart's style.  For now, I'll watch my vhs copy.
Please understand I want the most for my money.  For under $30 I've bought; The Abyss, T2, Bridge on the River Kwai and Lawrence of Arabia.  And these were ALL 2 disc releases! Last month I bought The Magnificent 7 for $13, it has a 1 hour documentry, 2 trailers, stills and a very enjoyable commentary with Eli Wallach, James Coburn plus others.
Well, I'm done venting.

339245,5,6301608534,"Was there ever a man more misunderstood? Steve McQueen plays a soldier who lives only for the thrill of combat. His character is cold and frightening and borders on the psychotic. He's a sociopath who carves up German soldiers with a butcher knife. After the war there is no going back for him. I saw this when I was a kid. I saw a lot of war movies in the theatre back then but this was the first one that really scared me. It gave me a sick feeling inside of how real war must be like. The scene with the bayonets and landmines left an impact on me for a long time after. Everyone in this film gave realistic performances but I remember how Steve McQueen's character seemed really demented. Yet despite the obvious psychological makeup of McQueen is there still a human being hidden deep within him. What is a hero? Don Siegel directed this tough and mean film and asks this profound question. Cinematographer Harold Lipstein's photography brings stark realism to this film. Composer Leonard Rosenman's score is very reminiscent of his brilliant work for the very popular W.W.II television series ""Combat!"" which ran for 5 years. This film also boasted a brilliant cast. Bobby Darin, James Coburn, Fess Parker, L.Q. Jones, Nick Adams, Harry Guardino, Mike Kellin and Bob Newhart are all featured. This is an underrated classic.",991353600,6,1329,4.732758620689655
339246,4,6301608534,"I tend to shy away from WWII movies made from the 40's till the early 60's, because they lack a certain realism.  This film is one of the first, however, to break out of that ultra-patriotic, propaganda ridden era that  Hollywood defined as World War II.  Within the censorship limits of the  time, this movie shows warfare at it's ugliest.  The film follows a squad  from the 95th Infantry Division as they face the Siegfried Line in the fall  of 1944.  The filmakers have researched the technical aspects of the film  fairly well.  The G.I.s are correctly uniformed and equiped, which is  somewhat of a rarity from Hollywood at the time.  ( Unfortunatly the  Germans in the film are not so lucky. They could have used a better tech  advisor.)  Overall a good movie.  Someone must have gained inspiration from  it when they made the movie WHEN TRUMPETS FADE in 1998.  Very similar story  line and just as well done.",953251200,7,916,4.6125

339508,5,6301608534,"1962's Hell is for Heroes has Steve McQueen as [Private] Reece who had been busted from Master Sergeant.  McQueen is sent to a squad which has the Senior NCO, Sgt Pike (Fess Parker [Daniel Boone]) as a former buddy.  The three squads are sent ""on the line"" and subsequently two of the squads are marched out in the middle of the night leaving a group of six to defend their position.

James Coburn plays Cpl Henshaw, one of the squad members who has to take over when the sergeant in charge of their squad (not Pike) is killed.  Henshaw authorizes a ploy to take out a machine gun bunker thought up by Reece.  Cut ins of actual footage of barrage and mortars in addition to cheesy special effects and over the top ""dying"" tie this movie together.

Bob Newhart's first movie appearance as a typist who had the misfortune of being caught up with the squad.  In a bit of lightheartedness, Newhart reenacts his ""one-sided telephone conversations"" from which he had been famous.

Shot in B&W and all the glorious shades of grey in between, Hell is for Heroes works really well until the last push.  At that point the movie seems too hurried and finishes.",1438214400,,1149,4.538834951456311

Not on the order of ""Saving Private Ryan"" for its graphic violence by any means, but still much more realistic than other '60s war flicks. And man, the cast!

339516,5,6301608534,"Have always liked this particular World War II film. It's a very fast-paced, direct portrayal of one small piece of the war. Comedian Bob Newhart's character portrayal was great, as was Steve McQueen's character.",1430870400,,212,5.264705882352941
339517,5,6301608534,"While I consider this to be one of the better American war dramas I must take issue with the historical credibility of the Polish character portrayed by Nick Adams.  In 1944 the Free Polish forces were operating in France, Belgium and Holland under the command of Generals Marcek (First Polish Armoured Division, which held the Falaise ring for the allies) and Sosabowski (Polish Paratroopers) as were the Free Polish Air Force and Navy.  These Polish forces were actively recruiting released Polish POW's, Polish conscripts in the German Army, French Poles and released forced laborers.  It is hard to believe that a Polish civilian would be allowed to fight in an American unit, particularly as such a Pole who would have had the opportunity to join the Polish Forces and undertake the necessary training before going into combat.  The Polish forces were actively seeking Poles to bolster their strength.  I am being picky here, but as an Australian whose father served with the Polish forces fighting alongside the allies in North Africa and in the Italian Campaign, I have this thing for historical accuracy.  Other than that little historical error I have no problem with the movie, or with Nick Adam's (himself of part Polish descent) depiction of the Polish character.",1430006400,,1275,5.0476190476190474
339548,5,6301608534,"This little-known war movie deserves a wider audience.  Written by WWII vet Robert Pirosh (who also created TV's longest-running WWII drama, ""Combat!"") and directed by Don Siegel (who went on to direct movies like ""Dirty Harry""), it is a compelling look at the life of American soldiers on the front lines during WWII.  Boasting an all-star cast that includes Steve McQueen, Bobby Darin, James Coburn, Fess Parker, Bob Newhart, and Nick Adams, this movie has characters that will make you think, make you laugh, maybe even make you tear up a little.",1429488000,,549,4.956521739130435
339549,3,6301608534,"I watched this movie once, a long time ago, but hadn't seen it again until now.  While I don't want this to sound overly negative but this film comes off mainly as a Steven McQueen vehicle.  McQueen plays a loner, a rebel, a once respected NCO now busted to private in the middle of the European theater of WWII near the end of WWII.  Though carrying a huge chip on his shoulder that we never learn about, McQueen is nevertheless a top-notch soldier in the field.

The bottom line is that a squad of soldiers is ordered to hold a section of the line it would normally require at least a full platoon to hold.  Knowing they are outnumbered and facing off against overwhelming odds McQueen and crew come up with some creative tricks to fool the enemy into thinking that there are more of them there than there are.

Sadly, as a viewer you never know where they are or why they are there, etc., perhaps lending reality to what it means to be boots on the ground during battle.

Frankly, as I watched this well-known film again the main memory I take away are many, many full-frame shots of terrorized, anguish-laden, or detached full-face framed shots.  That just didn't work all that well for me.

Back in the day (1962) this was probably a top-flight WWII movie and I remember seeing once as a kid.  Seeing it now though, it was less than an enjoyable experience - and I am a big fan of WWII movies.  While the cast includes lots of familiar names and faces, the best performance was IMO not McQueens', but that of James Coburn.  Coburn plays his role to perfection, underemoting and carrying his character well.  Most of the rest of the characters overacted too much for my tastes.

Toward the end of the movie several historic clips of battle scenes actually shot during WWII were spliced into the film.  This splicing is not seamless since there is a visible even stark mismatch between it and the filmed movie footage.  In short, the character development was largely limited and the action was not too realistic.

I'd say that if you are looking for a classic WWII movie, keep looking.  Consider perhaps ""The Longest Day"", ""Sahara"" (Bogart), ""The Dam Busters"", ""The Great Escape"", ""Stalag 17"", ""Battle of Britain"", ""Bridge on the River Kwai"", ""Hell in the Pacific"", ""Das Boot"", ""Enemy at the Gate"", ""They Were Expendable"", ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" or ""In Harm's Way"" as alternatives.

All in all I'm glad I watched it, but once is enough for a long time if not forever.  This is IMO a film whose time is past.

339581,5,6301608534,"How's this for a wrong time/wrong place scenario? A large U.S. army outfit has just moved into a position in rural France during World War II. A quarter mile ahead is an entrenched German force, anchored by a formidable pillbox with a machine gun. The G.I.s turn in for the night, and next morning one very shocked six-man squad discovers that everyone else has quietly pulled out in the dark. No word about a return, or if they're coming back at all. The squad's orders remain to hold the position, against a now presumably much larger group of Germans.

If this weren't tense enough for viewer and remaining six soldiers alike, there's Steve McQueen's character to crank it up another notch. Private John Reese, previously decorated for valor and Master Sergeant, has what we call today an attitude problem. He pushes ungracefully here for a nighttime preemptive attack on the pillbox, while the others are content to follow orders and dig in. And they all DO stay put, at least for a bit. But Reese acts as a spur to keep them--and the fast-paced story--speeding to its hellish climax.

No doubt a few viewers here will initially find the Reese character hellish. I thought so myself when first watching the movie as a kid in the sixties. Probably more than a few theater-going fans of McQueen's then-recent successes in ""Wanted: Dead Or Alive"" and ""The Magnificent Seven"" were alienated too by the unaccustomed chippiness of Reese. But I think there's enough evidence here in HIFH to justify showing the guy a little more sympathy. He's not a talker much less a diplomat, but bodily he'll be there for you when things get hot. I've been privileged to come to know a few such people, and it's worth the trouble of getting past the surface to the substance.

Anyhow, if I ever get around to compiling my 50 or 100 favorite action movies, this compact little 90-minute masterpiece will certainly be high on the list.",1418083200,,1917,4.733532934131737

In this earlier film, although he also got top billing, he was very much one among several in what amounts to quite an ensemble piece with, if anything, Bobby Darin, getting more on screen time with the more obviously flashy role of the cocky, happy go lucky platoon souvenir collector, Corby.  McQueen plays, Reese, a battle-hardened veteran recently demoted from sergeant: the reason is more or less skipped over but suggests that hes a bit wound-up.  In a relatively minor role, James Coburn, his Magnificent Seven buddy, plays mechanical whiz, Corporal Henshaw.  Harry Guardino and Fess (Davy Crockett) Parker play Sgts. Larkin and Pike, respectively.

The story opens in a rest area behind the front line in Montigny, 1944.  We don't know which Montigny  there are several dozen in France  but its near the Siegfried Line so its likely its around November/December just before the Battle of the Bulge. Reese arrives to join up with his new platoon and meet his new buddies but right away shows he isn't much of a team player.  The following day the company have to move back up to the front line and Reeses squad; Corby, Henshaw et. al under Sgt. Larkin have to hold a position on a slightly raised ridge across from a German pill box housing a machine gun post and situated behind a mine field.  Temporarily, the company is split up and the platoon is stretched far too thinly to be able to hold out for very long should the Germans discover just how thinly!  Needless to say they become stressed out; bullets begin to fly and tempers begin to fray.

This is a relatively short, tightly scripted film with McQueen on top form and all other performances right on the money; in particular, its a vivid reminder of the scandalously under-used acting talents of Darin (see also, Pressure Point with Sidney Poitier, released the same year).  The black and white cinematography and superb lighting are just right and brilliantly evoke the reality of the mud, dirt and squalor of foxhole life.  And, of course, its directed by Don Siegel  did he ever make a bad film?",1398556800,,2243,4.75968992248062

These are the primary players in this short play of a movie that takes place over about two days, has a necessarily limited plot and is really about the interaction of these characters--how they face up to an enemy all too happy to kill them, orders that are likely to help that enemy more than them and no real concern about there needs to be bloodshed in the first place.  The actors pull it off to the point that is interesting to watch and partly just to see all these famous faces in one small movie.

His character is cold and frightening and borders on the psychotic. He's a sociopath who carves up German soldiers with a butcher knife. After the war there is no going back for him. I saw this when I was a kid. I saw a lot of war movies in the theater back then but this was the first one that really scared me. It gave me a sick feeling inside of how real war must be like. The scene with the bayonets and landmines left an impact on me for a long time after. Everyone in this film gave realistic performances but I remember how Steve McQueen's character seemed really demented. Yet despite the obvious psychological makeup of McQueen is there still a human being hidden deep within him. What is a hero? Don Siegel directed this tough and mean film and asks this profound question. Cinematographer Harold Lipstein's photography brings stark realism to this film. Composer Leonard Rosenman's score is very reminiscent of his brilliant work for the very popular W.W.II television series ""Combat!"" which ran for 5 years. This film also boasted a brilliant cast.

Let me summarize the story for you:  Steve McQueen gets killed blowing up a German machine gun nest in WWII.  But, unlike in The Sandpebbles, he dies a completely unmemorable death.  That's okay because his character has about six lines of dialog in the whole film.  But, unlike in The Magnificent Seven, they are six completely unmemorable lines.  He also expresses two and only two emotions, testy and surly.  But, unlike in Bullitt, these bursts of emotion reveal nothing about his personality or core values.  This film is 90 minutes of your life that would be better spent watching The Cincinnati Kid again, since, of all his performances, this one was McQueen's personal favorite.  I've read all of his biographies, and McQueen never commented on this film.  That's probably because it had the same effect on him as it did on me.

339754,3,6301608534,"Like many classic war films of the Fifties and Sixties, this movie has little in common with modern thrill-a-minute action pictures, and is actually more of a psychological drama with some action vignettes. Made at a time when most World War II vets were in the prime of life, and perhaps coming to grips with the emotions of their youthful war experience, Hell is for Heroes is principally an examination of how small groups of men interact at moments of extreme stress. In that regard it's similar to the air-war classic Twelve o' Clock High-- which only momentarily shows pilots actually flying in combat-- or Run Silent Run Deep, which is largely a series of drawing-room conversations inside the hull of a submarine.

Here the first 40 minutes is almost a stage play-- a series of character introductions all staged on one set, with the key players entering camera left or camera right. Only then does the plot advance to a series of skirmishes along the German defensive Siegfried Line in the final months of the war.

The classic war-film archetypes are all there-- the conniver, the frightened unlikely hero (Bob Newhart's first role), the gadget fixer, the urban ethnic kid, and the omnicompetent, world-weary noncom. How they handle fear, rage, fatigue, and the burdens of mutual responsibility is what this film is actually about.

This was among Steve McQueen's starmaking roles, but don't expect the King of Cool he later became. In Hell is For Heroes McQueen is a fidgety, burnt-out antihero who soldiers on because he has become very good at the crafts of soldiering. Scruffy, sullen, and unruly, he is probably a little but of what most real veterans saw in their own service: less hero, more hellraiser.

339768,4,6301608534,"Sometimes a true story is just too incredible to believe than fiction. But here is a fascinating piece of WWII history told in HELL IS FOR HEROES. Of course, it's hard to know how exactly factual the film is but it is true that in 1944 a handful of US soldiers ended up in the front lines - almost breathing distance from a large squadron of German soldiers. Their impossible task was to hold their ground and prevent the Germans from advancing.
HELL FOR HEROES is one of the several ensemble films that Steve McQueen did early in his careers. Although he is always the shining star in his films, several other actors stand out in this film. James Coburn also appeared with McQueen in THE GREAT ESCAPE. Fess Parker, Bobby Darin, Harry Guardino, Nick Adams and a surprisingly young Bob Newhart complete the cast. Darin is a standout as ""the go to"" soldier who can get anything a soldier might need but for a price. He has a soulful youthful vigor that brightens the screen. Nick Adams does a great job playing a homeless Polish man desperately wanting to joing the American soldiers. I don't know how authentic his Polish was but he sounded totally believable. It's a surprise to see Bob Newhart adding some humor to this intense battle story. We can clearly see the Bob Newhart we would later come to know and love on TV.
Newhart is a likeable but bumbling clerk typist who makes a serious accidental detour to the battle lines on his way to deliver some badly needed typewriters to an office in a safe area.

McQueen is raw and gritty as ""Reese"" the mysterious and angry new soldier to the group. He has been through the hell of war and wants no part of anyone or anything, yet we know he will be an important part of this desperate battle. A young McQueen looks older because of beard stubble but Steve McQueen seems ageless in all of his movies.

The fun part of the story is how this small group of men tries to make the Germans believe they are actually a full platoon of men ready for battle.

HELL FOR HEROES was made less than 20 years after the actual events depicted and before the endless WWII movies that were to follow. I can imagine this was an intense and rivoting movie for its day and it still has that emotional charge of a incredible story.",1342396800,3,2259,4.43855421686747

339772,4,6301608534,"There was 'Hell is for Heroes', Don Siegel's crisp, highly effective war movie about an undermanned US Army platoon trying to hold a thinly-defended sector of the Siegfried Line in late 1944 against a potential German attack.  Obviously, a lot of the reviews focus heavily on its star, the famously difficult Steve McQueen. Although McQueen was not exactly the surly rebel he so often portrayed (he was a conservative Republican in real life), he does a fine job in playing the tightly-wound, probably shell-shocked Pvt. Reese.  What is great about this film is not so much McQueen's performance - which is commendable - but Siegel's direction, on a shoestring, of perhaps some of the most realistic combat action sequences ever shot.  The black and white cinematography helps conceal the fact that the France depicted here is actually southern California and the Germans wear uniforms that look borrowed from the Twilight Zone.  Indeed, Siegel had to 'make do' on a limited budget but where he got his money's worth is through his supporting cast.  Thankfully, Bobby Darin was not asked to sing a theme song for this film, and Bob Newhart's turn as the comic relief in this film is moderated by the fact that Newhart is actually a veteran (although he did not actually see combat, in Korea). Perhaps this film's most memorable moment, still shocking, is when Mike Kellin's character, Pvt Kolinski, is mortally wounded - his anguished screaming sends shivers up your spine and his final plea to his comrades, begging them to not tell his wife how bad the war (or any war, for that matter) really was is telling.

My Dad told me of many things that happened during his time in the service. The one part of the film which reminded me of one of his stories was when Calvados,the French Apple Brandy was mentioned.
He always told us about the time after landing on Normandy beach and advancing inland about a little older lady who was giving out one shot of Calvados to the soldiers that passed by her. They were very happy to see the United States soldiers who helped win back France's freedom from Nazi Germany.",1269648000,,695,4.3538461538461535
339776,5,6301608534,"I watched Saving Private Ryan once.  Not only did I fail to see what all the fuss was about, I thought it was pretty dumb and, at times, insulting.  Yes, the battle scenes were well done.  But every time one of the characters spoke, it sounded bogus and false.  Tom Hanks at the end, muttering, ""Earn ... this ...""  Please.

In contrast, ""Hell is for Heroes"" does not contain one false moment.  Every line of dialogue seems real.  Every scene - even the comic ones - resonates.  I've watched ""Hell is For Heroes"" about a dozen times and will likely watch it a dozen more.  Don Siegel didn't have Spielberg's budget, but the writing and acting in ""Hell is For Heroes"" are far superior.

In ""Private Ryan"", there's a bit of a ruse being played.  Spielberg made the action scenes so ""real"" and so gruesome and so violent.  This was done, ostensibly, to impress the audience with the ""authenticity"" of war.  But the gore covered what was essentially a weak storyline and inauthentic dialogue.  It's a way of cheating the audience.  Ben Stiller exposed this technique and justly ridiculed it in ""Tropic Thunder"", an infinitely more honest film than ""Private Ryan.""

Siegel didn't have the money for the big theatrics, the blockbuster opening scene.  Instead, the film begins with Steve McQueen reporting for duty.  And within a couple of minutes and only a couple of lines of dialogue, McQueen shows us what John Reese is about.  He has to.  Because we don't have the special effects, the actors and the writing need to carry the film.  Which is as it should be.

Take just a couple of scenes: Fess Parker's Sgt. Pike talking with McQueen's Private Reese:

Reese: What about Larkin?
Pike:  Knows how to take orders, how to give em'.  He's a good man.
Reese: He better be.

That's just a hundred times more realistic than ""earn this.""

Or McQueen saying to James Coburn's character, ""And you?""

Or McQueen saying to Nick Adams's Homer, ""You got no business on the front line.  Them heinies catch you and start pulling out your toenails, you'll spill everything you know.""

This is how men in a situation like that would talk.  Can we depend on the man in charge?  Does he know what he's doing?  Will we survive the night?  There's no time for maudlin speeches about getting home to the wife.

Everyone's good in the film.  Coburn, Harry Guardino, Parker, Adams, Bob Newhart ... they all turn in top performances.  But it's McQueen's film.

A word about McQueen.  It's become obvious over the years that he was a very underrated actor.  Because of his good looks and his superstar status, he was never really given his proper due during his lifetime.  But no one can watch this film and say he wasn't great at his craft.  This is the second best performance of his career.  (""Junior Bonner"" was his best.)  Look at what he does with motion.  The way he holds his cigarette or that bottle of brandy.  The intensity, the mood conveyed.  The way he tends to his guns, his ammo, his butcher knife.  There is no need for another character to tell us he's burned out and doomed or perhaps even psychotic.  We see it.  McQueen himself shows us.  Consider the best actors of that time: Brando, Montgomery Clift, or - had he been alive - James Dean.  Could they have done any better in that role?  I doubt it.

This movie also has various other well known actors in it, who seem out of character in certain aspects of this movie.  Steve McQueen seems to come across, basically the same way he did in Bullet, The Great Escape and so forth, he does things his own way, has his own way of doing things, and seems to always accomplish things better on his own.  I believe a big part of the way he was in real life, was brought over to the movies he did.  This movie reminded me more of a Television Production, then a feature film, it is just the way it was made, and how everything, and all the action and drama happens within a limited area.  At times,  it makes you feel like your enclosed by bounderies, and a captive in the darkness, even when it is day time.

Hell is for Heroes is a fairly well-made but thoroughly standard-order war film about a platoon of disparate characters pitted against the enemy: if you like the actors (a young Steve McQueen, a very young and amusing Bob Newhart, James Coburn, et al.) or really crave WWII check it out but if you don't then I doubt you'll find much to differentiate it from the thousand or so other films just like it.

339800,5,6301608534,"HELL IS FOR HEROES is one of the grittiest most realistic films made about war and men at war.  This is not a film that glorifies war nor does it serve as a patriotic song of war.  Rather director Don Siegel uses black and white in a manner that is more real than if he had used color. The time is late 1944 or early 1945 and the American army is getting ready to storm the Siegfried Line, the final steel curtain protecting Nazi Germany. But the Wehrmacht is far from licked and plans to counterattack.  It is at the critical juncture in the hours before this German push that the film begins.  Steve McQueen is private Reese, a soldier who has his private demons with which he must contend.  McQueen in real life and Reese of the film share the same tag of the bitter loner. Reese is the dramatic center as he is unable to fit into the regimented life of the GI.  He is reduced in rank for crashing a jeep and later is transfered to a unit that is promised a break from combat.  This promise is soon broken as military necessity demands that they be sent straight back into the front lines.  Reese cooly calculates his chances of survival as nil but he refuses to allow that realization to alter in any meaningful way his essential persona of the disgruntled GI. Instead he chooses to continue to fight in the only way that he knows, none of which involves working through sanctioned channels.  He leads an unauthorized attack on a fortified German pillbox that might have saved the day had his squad had more men, but it did not. The attack is beaten off with the loss of two fellow soldiers.  Even during the climax when Reese is threatened with courts martial, McQueen plays Reese as one who best communicates with facial tics and wobbly body language. We can see a world of torment within his brain as he knows with a bitter sureness that his life has no other purpose than to function as a lever to reduce that hated pillbox to smoking ruins.

There are other actors who complement McQueen's sterling performance.  Bob Newhart steals more than a few scenes as the bumbling real echelon soldier who complains that he knows only how to type. Fess Parker is the steady company sergeant who understands Reese's problems but cannot offer meaningful help.  Other notables from the 60s include Nick Adams, Mike Kellin, Harry Guardino, and James Coburn.  The film focuses relentlessly on the grotesqueness of combat.  We see Americans scream in pain while their mates cannot even take time to bury them. What emerges by the final reel is the same sense of mindless cruelty that later would come to mark SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, but here back in 1962 even with the limited budget that Siegel had to contend with does not reduce HELL IS FOR HEROES in stature.  It is quite simply one of the best films that purports to show how and why men react to combat as they do.",1236988800,3,2860,4.492277992277992

It's Coburn getting blown up and then whats left of him scorched by his blazing flamethrower. Its even Newhart in his weird comic relief role but isn't that how real combat always seems to happen, something always goes wrong, you improvise, his role is a great respite to totally relax your mind before the shock happens, its great. Its the Army folks, get used to it, and love this great low budget flick. It's not a chick flick either, its got guys flick written all over it. Its on TV again and again and again for a reason, guys will continue to watch it over and over and over again.

McQueen is as manic as ever, as if someone stole his prized cycle. Like the toughest of WWII yarns, the squad must hold the line after getting to know one another. As much character-driven as objective-driven, the squad improvises with laughs and violent strategems. Coburn, as a mechanical genius, rigs a jeep so it sounds like a Sherman tanks. Newhart has the opportunity to gag it via a tapped telephone that the company(squad,really) is tired of the same Betty Grable films. Running out of patience, McQueen gets suicidal to motivate the squad to take action against the impregnable bunker. They have a go and exceed their ambitions with high costs. Save for an improbable finish, the war yarn scores in realism, once more into the breech, for the few, proud and psychotic.

339822,4,6301608534,"As far as GI WW2 movies go this is not a bad one.  It does pretty well on realism, provides some basic character development, and does not get lost on sentimentality.  You won't find the required romance here! There are some well known actors in it which will be appealing for those seeking that aspect of things.  The story is pretty basic. A small squard of GIs has to hold the line against the Germans. This is pretty standard stuff.  Most WW2 movies persist in the fable of a handful of GIs outsmarting the Germans.  Quite silly in that it was usually the Wehrmacht that was out-gunned and out-numbered by this point in the war.  The movie portrays events at the Siegfried Line, the last ditch German defense on the border with France.  Steve McQueen always seems to portray the loner in most of these movies, and he does a chilling job showing a combat fanatic.  I don't understand where the Polish guy who wants to join the US forces comes from?  Is he a deserter from the Germans, or a freed slave labor camp guy??.  The film never makes his status clear.  Bob Newheart is amusing as the kind of rear echelon guy the US forces had too many of at this point in the war.  I give this film credit for trying to be realistic.  They could easily have made another super GI squad like the whole Combat Series, or Kelly's Heros or Dirty Dozen.  Fortunately none of that fantasy stuff is here.  The finale attack scene is quite gripping and authentic.  The film choses to end here which is somewhat unusual, but it seems to work.

Others in the cast include Fess Parker, Harry Guardino, James Coburn, and Bob Newhart, who was famous at the time for his stand-up comedy routines of one-way telephone conversations, and lightens the tension with a hilarious scene where to fool the Germans who have placed a ""bug"" near the telephone, he pretends to talk to the commander.

Based on a true story (which took a few years to be declassified and written about), it takes place near Montigny, France, in 1944, and is about a small squad that is outnumbered by the enemy, who is protected in a pillbox surrounded by mines; the script is tight and the pacing marvelous, with direction from Don Siegel, who would go on to direct so many great Clint Eastwood action films.

I have seen this film countless times since its theatrical release in 1962, and it never gets stale; the performances are all excellent, with a modernistic score by Leonard Rosenman that adds to the atmosphere, and Harold Lipstein's black & white cinematography capturing the muddy, gritty feel of the foxholes, the fear felt by all, and the incredible heroism that some men can rise to.

Where the story centers around a platoon of characters, all of which are memorable with depth of individual character.  A movie with the same type of ensemble acting in a War film is Olver Stone's ""Platoon.""  The fact that this particular film predates ""Platoon"" by 24 years is remarkable.  This is a story about a small, 6-man platoon left to hold a mile-wide stretch of ragged countryside until reinforcements arrive;  but there is no telling if or when they will.  It's that sort of tension that is held all the way to the explosive finale.  But it's the journey that makes this film worthwhile.  The entire cast is excellent, with Steve McQueen heading the list with another of his under-appreciated performances.  He is one of those rare types that is a movie-star that can act; it's the ones who can do both who become legendary.  The plotting in this film is also noteworthy, with ingenious ideas and interesting characters joined together to hold the line. The script is both sharp and intense.  There were a couple of extreme moments, one of which I actually exclaimed aloud.  However, there are two reasons why I just can't give this film 5 stars.  The first happens in the final, climactic battle, where many of the extras fall over (shot dead) so badly and with such fake screaming that I was crestfallen.  All the scenes leading up to the end are well-done and authentic, so it was a let-down to see mediocrity of any kind, particularly during the climax.  The second and last thing I didn't like was the splicing of real War footage in with the final assault.  All the voices are obviously dubbed, which was another moment to shake my head in dismay.  There are some great moments during that last battle, so take my criticism with a grain of proverbial salt.  ""Hell is for Heroes"" is nearly a great film, if not for those two inconsistencies.  This film has great acting, a solid script with more humor and intelligence than I would have imagined, and another legendary turn by Steve McQueen.

The story begins when a squad of combat-weary GI's is sent back to the front and then left behind by the rest of the Company to defend an insignifigant portion of the Siegfried Line.  Then the Germans decide it is not so insignifigant after all.  The hook is the diminutive squad must convince the company of Wermacht soldiers that they are facing a much larger force.  They employ a variety of illusions to keep up the charade (James Coburn runs a backfiring jeep in low gear in a circle to make the Germans think they have a tank, Bob Newhart sits in a pillbox making up radio traffic, and they string up rocks in empty ammo cans to make it sound like troop movement), but eventually the Germans begin to figure it out.  The only thing left for them to do is hit the enemy hard and without warning to discourage their advance until the company returns.
This is an engrossing small scale drama with some intense action (despite a liberal use of wartime stock footage, mostly of artillery crews, to give us a sense of place) - the scene where the German patrol charges McQueen's foxhole with fixed bayonets is pretty desperate, with McQueen resorting to throwing his helmet to beat down their advance!
Without a doubt this movie is carried by the skillful gritty direction of Segal and an awesome cast.  McQueen comes on strong and early as the grizzled vet busted down from Master Sergeant for trying to run down a colonel with his jeep.  Little details hint toward a bloody and intriguing past - he favors a captive Schweisser German machinegun and keeps a butcher knife strapped to his hip.  This is just about the toughest I've ever seen him.  Guardino as the Sarge is paternal, Newhart endearing as an inexperienced typist who stumbles onto the squad and gets his jeep requisitioned, and Nick Adams is pretty authentic as a Polish D.P. desperate to prove his worth and go back to America with the squad - I didn't even know it was him till the credits rolled.  James Coburn is reserved as a tinkering engineer, and Bobby Darin is fine too as a profit-minded procurer.  All the cast gives standout performances, never once blurring as individuals in my mind - which makes the impact of some of their deaths all the more real and shocking.
Little details about the movie help to sell it - the toilet seat hung on the base wall as a frame for a picture of Der Fuherer, Newhart talking into a radio-phone with the severed chord dangling there, and that nerve-wracking night crawl through the minefield!

339850,5,6301608534,"Hell for Heroes is an often underlooked WWII movie that is a must have for fans of the genre.  Private Reese has just been reassigned to a new battalion following a court martial that knocked him from a sergeant to a private.  When he arrives and joins his new squad, the battalion thinks they're being sent home, only to discover they have been assigned back onto the line.  Once on the line, much of the company is pulled out, leaving Reese and his undermanned squad to defend a section of the Siegfried Line that would normally require a company to hold.  As they wait for reinforcements, the 2nd Squad must convince the Germans that their numbers are bigger than they really are.  Directed by Don Siegel and shot in black and white, this movie gives a pretty realistic portrayal of war, or at least what I assume it to be.  The battle scenes are moving and often very powerful, especially a harrowing crawl across a minefield, and it all builds to a startling and unexpected finale.  Don't let this WWII classic slip by!

  Leading an excellent ensemble cast, Steve McQueen stars as Reese, a natural soldier who always seems to find himself in trouble and is really only comfortable/happy when he's fighting.  McQueen makes Reese a powderkeg you're just waiting to go off, and it's fun to see him already perfecting that hardened loner that he would become so well known for.  Singer Bobby Darin is also very good as Pvt. Corby, the affable scrounger who provides some comic relief.  Fess Parker plays Sgt. Pike, the platoon sergeant who has met Reese in the past and knows his background.  Harry Guardino gives good support as Sgt. Larkin, the squad sergeant who finds himself leading his undermanned squad in less than favorable conditions.  The rest of the squad includes James Coburn as Henshaw, the mechanical genius, Nick Adams as Homer, the Polish refugee who tags along with the squad, a very young Bob Newhart in a good part as Driscoll, a typist that gets caught up in the fight, Mike Kellin as Kolinsky, and Bill Mullikin as Cumberly.  Newhart's part even gives him a chance to do his famous phone bit!  The ensemble cast works really well together, which makes it that much tougher to watch as their numbers dwindle.  The DVD features a theatrical trailer and the movie in widescreen presentation.  Not a great offering with no extras but a trailer, but it's relatively cheap and the movie stands on it's own pretty well.

Fess Parker, best known for his portrayal of Davy Crockett for Disney, plays the infantry unit's company commander. The story opens in late 1944 with Parker's infantry company deploying across from the pillboxes of Germany's vaunted Westwall. To complicate matters, most of the company is temporarily detailed to another assignment leaving little more than a platoon to hold a frontage barely sustainable by a company. Steve McQueen plays his usual role as the angry young loner who plans to fight the war on his own terms. Look for other stars such as Harry Guardino, James Coburn and a youthful Bob Newhart. Filming took place in Northern California's Shasta County.  The set was complete with rows of ersatz dragons teeth.

The story is told primarily from the American point of view. Much like BATTLEGROUND, do not expect to see too many closeups of German soldiers except for a handful of bayonet-toting Landsers wearing sterotypical uniforms with World War One helmets direct from Hollywood wardrobe warehouses. No matter, the action is great and the story is simple and easy to follow.

This is also war. Sometimes you simply can't choose your destiny. You simply are and simply want to remain... alive.
It's a simple straight forward story that could very well be an ideal companion to two other movies of this kind: ""The Men"", starring Marlon Brando and ""Attack!"", starring Jack Palance.
It's the first time I have watched it on DVD and I was highly impressed by its quality. Unfortunately there are no extras, nor documentaries, whether of the movie or of that Historical period.
It would be nice if the Studios included some documentary footage referring to the various war movies made.
For instance, how would you like if 20th Century-Fox included some news or documentary reels on the actual attack on Pearl Harbor with ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" for you to compare reality with recreated fiction?
Or further, wouldn't you love to have footage of the actual Battle of Midway with Universal's ""Midway"", or the battle at Kasserine Pass with ""Patton"" or ""The Big Red One""?
Sometimes it's not enough to have trailers included, a bit history and culture, combined with entertainment wouldn't be so bad after all.
Pity, but still worth your hard earned money.",1028678400,4,1979,4.739130434782608
339854,4,6301608534,"Without wishing to spoil the ending I once heard Bob Newhart give an interview saying that they ran out of film and the studio wouldn't give them any more. Whether this is the case or not, it surely is a good spin in demonstrating the story of a war doesn't end at a convenient moment.",1014163200,,285,4.2
339855,5,6301608534,"I've seen them all, and this is solely about the campaign from September, 1944, until the Battle of the Bulge in December, 1944.  Since the Newhart character mentions his Division headquarters being at the French town of Thionville, it means that this fictional outfit was located at the sector just a few miles east, i.e., south of Trier, Germany and probably a part of Patton's Third Army.  My uncle fought in that campaign.  His letters home confirm the rough time his outfit had in September and October, 1944.  Most of the units were understrength after a few days at the front line.  The Germans had constructed their defenses so that the pillboxes, mostly camouflaged, had interlocking fields of fire so that they were mutually supporting.  Also, they had excellent observation points for artillery fire direction.  Thus, the ""Amis"" (the nickname for the U.S. troops given by the Nazis) were under fire at all times.
The replacement troops usually were so green that they didn't last a month, and many died after a day or two without knowning even what outfit they belonged to.  Thus, this movie captures the realism of what that combat was like.  I especially liked the attention to detail, e.g., the night patrols, the minefield, the concertina wire, etc.  Both sides sent out nightly patrols.  These were the days before spy satellites and infrared or night vision devices.  The only way to get good intelligence was to send out some men to capture prisoners for interrogation.  That explains why Reese was so concerned about the Germans finding out how thin his sector was held, and why the squad tried to take measures to fool the enemy into thinking they were a larger force.  Another good realism was having the mortar squads fire for effect on the approaches to the pillbox.  However, in the real war the troops tried to outflank it.  The veterans I have talked to say the best way to knock the pillbox out was to get in the rear of it and drop some grenades down the ventilation pipe.  The Germans usually came out running after one of the grenades exploded.  However, due to the need to provide a heroic end for Reese, the movie has him going directly in front of the firing aperture and making a fatal but explosive end to the machine gun.
The U.S. Army lost about 50,000 troops during this 3 month campaign.  The lines of supply were outstretched, and the equipment, e.g., tanks, trucks, artillery, were in need of resupply and repair due to the long trek across France.  Hitler had the West Wall(the actual name for the Siegfried Line) defended to give his forces time to reorganize in preparation for the Ardennes Campaign in December, 44.  My uncle's unit was restricted in its' battle against the West Wall to the point where the Division Artillery could only fire ten (10) rounds per gun per day!
This movie has to be seen in order to understand how this happened, and to appreciate what our ancestors had to endure.  This, in my estimate, is the best WW II movie before Saving Private Ryan since it captures the gritty and violent world in a realistic way, before all the advances in special effects.",1014076800,37,3125,4.716390423572744
339856,5,6301608534,"Gritty realism and a riveting performance by Steve McQueen highlight the World War II action/drama ""Hell Is For Heroes,"" directed by Don Siegel.  The setting is France, 1944, and American troops are spread thin across a sector of the Siegfried Line.  When heavy action in another area precipitates troop movement, a squad of six men is left behind to hold the position until reinforcements arrive, which means a day or maybe two of making the Germans believe they are actually up to strength with a full complement of men.  Not an easy task, but like the man said, war is hell.  With Sergeant Larkin (Harry Guardino) in charge, and left to their own devices for survival, the men of the 2nd Squad dig in for what just may be the longest night of their lives.  And for some, it will prove to be not only the longest, but their last.  In the shadow of a murderous pill box held by the enemy, the soldiers make their stand and add yet another footnote to another chapter in the history of the eternal struggle for freedom.
 Filmed in stark black&white, Siegel's film succinctly captures the fatal brutality of war, in terms perhaps not as graphic, but every bit as effectively as Steve Spielberg would do some thirty-six years later with his monumental film ""Saving Private Ryan.""  Siegel may not have had the special effects in 1961 that Spielberg had at his disposal in 1998, but he did have an excellent screenplay (by Robert Pirosh and Richard Carr) from which to work.  He tells his story in a direct, unromanticized way that maintains the focus and conveys the sense of urgency of the moment, through which he builds the tension and suspense that makes the peril of the situation immediate and real.  Siegel had two predominant elements going for him that helped him achieve success with this venture:  One was an instinctive knowledge of what works and how to deliver it; but most of all, he had Steve McQueen to sell it.
 McQueen plays Pvt. John Reese, a veteran soldier who transfers into this particular outfit on the very day they are ordered to the front line.  And that's just the way Reese wants it.  When he reports for duty (three days late), he runs into Sergeant Pike (Fess Parker), who had served with him in another campaign.  It's late evening, and the troops are assembling at an old church outside of town that now serves as a makeshift barracks; Pike sees Reese and asks him how he is.  ""Thirsty,"" Reese replies.  ""Town's off limits,"" Pike tells him.  The very next scene shows Reese walking into town and finding what appears to be the only bar on a lonely street.  Stepping up to the counter, Reese asks the bartender (a woman) for a bottle.  ""One pack or two?"" he asks.  ""We aren't allow to serve soldiers--"" she says.  ""Two,"" he replies, and setting the cigarettes on the counter, he walks around and takes a bottle.  And now, without a doubt, we know exactly who and what Reese is; the personification of the iconoclastic loner, embodied to perfection in the form of Steve McQueen.
 By all accounts, McQueen was not only a tough guy on screen, but in real life as well; tough meaning that he was always up for a challenge of any kind, and determined to live by his own set of rules, no matter what the cost.  But he was a complex individual, and that was but one side of his true persona.  To play Reese, McQueen went to that dark, stoic side of himself, exaggerated it, and the result was one of the most intense characters he ever created.  Reese is a force of one, adamant and relentless, single-minded and fatalistic.  At the moment he's on the Siegfried Line, but for him it's just another battle in a war he's been waging with life since the day he was born.  And he knows deep down that it's a war he's never going to win; it's just a matter of time before his hand plays out, and being on the line is just as good a place as any.  For him, it's not a matter of options, but of inevitability.  It's an exemplary performance, and one for which McQueen never received the acclaim he was due, which unfortunately was not an isolated instance in his career.  There was Vin in ""The Magnificent Seven,"" Frank Bullitt in ""Bullitt"" and Tom Horn in ""Tom Horn,"" as well.  And that's but a sample of the work he did for which he never received enough recognition.  His only real acknowledgement came with his creation of Jake Holman in ""The Sand Pebbles,"" a role for which he was nominated and should have received the Oscar for Best Actor.  But Reese was one of his first, and one of his best.
 The supporting cast includes Bobby Darin (Corby), James Coburn (Henshaw), Mike Kellin (Kolinsky), Joseph Hoover (Captain Loomis), Bill Mullikin (Cumberly), Nick Adams (Homer) and Bob Newhart in his film debut as Pvt. Driscoll.  Hard-hitting and with unforgiving realism, ""Hell Is For Heroes,"" though on a smaller scale, perhaps, than Spielberg's ""Ryan,"" is one of the most effective and memorable war films ever made; Siegel gave it direction and focus, McQueen brought it to life.  And it's quite simply one of the best of it's kind you'll ever see.",999993600,91,5068,4.57760532150776
