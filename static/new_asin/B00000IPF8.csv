1227197,5,B00000IPF8,"I agree that labeling this film as a comedy or romantic comedy is a huge mistake, but it is a really good film.  Janeane Garofalo goes beyond her eye-rolling, snippy sarcasm (although there is some of that for fans) to  demonstrate real acting ability.  Is it a perfect film?  No. But few are.  This is definately worth watching.",945302400,,329,4.603448275862069
1227198,1,B00000IPF8,"Five stars? Give me a break! The quality and content of this film had me believing that it could be no more than a junior high school production. The only thing sensitive about this film were my sides after I got through  laughing. The acting was unbearable. The dialogue was lacking.  Also, given  the seriousness of manic depression and the options that are available for  helping individuals stricken with this disorder-- the personal ads along  with viewing this film about equal the very last resort...short of suicide.  Don't ever waste your money purchasing this film. If you must- Rent it-and  that only out of curiousity!",944352000,3,630,4.942857142857143
1227199,4,B00000IPF8,"This movie was interesting with a very surprise ending.  i had some trouble believing that the two lead characters created such an intense bond so quickly but hey, it's just a movie i guess.  anyways, i'd recommend it,  but it's definitely a darker film, not something to watch if you're looking  for a laugh.",943920000,2,309,4.666666666666667
1227200,4,B00000IPF8,"This is a film for those who have been out on the dating scene and have HATED IT.  Janeane plays the role of Jasmine, a manic-depressive on the verge of killing herself when she comes across a message from one of her  personal ad ""buddies"" .  Jasmine commits herself to one last date  before she decides whether or not to end her life.  It's one of those films  that get deep under the skin, and transport you into the lives of two  lonely single people reaching out to make a connection.  I thought the  dialogue was original and fresh and overall the acting was right on the  money.  If you want to see a film with sensitivity that doesn't meander  into the mainstream, view this classic.  You won't be disappointed.",936835200,10,718,4.430769230769231
7911233,1,B00000IPF8,"Please look carefully at the director's name before buying.  This Paul Thomas movie is actually an adult movie produced by Vivid and not a very good one at that. Luckily I only spent 5 bucks buying a used version and not $69. Oops! The Janeane Garafolo movie, Sweethearts, is directed by Aleks Horvat and it's almost impossible to find since it was never released.",1096761600,3,364,4.6875
7911234,4,B00000IPF8,"Shudder.
Janeane looks lovely, and I'm not just saying that because she's armed.
Good date movie!",1000252800,,97,5.125
7911235,4,B00000IPF8,"Sweethearts is about a manic-depressive woman changing the unrealistic expectations of a man looking for love. It's a poignant, yet desperate look at how love can develop in weird circumstances, and shake your value sytems afterwards.  The main character is a man who places an ad with a dating service, and gets a respond from Jasmine. When they meet, he finds himself unable to leave (thanks to the prescence of a gun,and a death threat), then discovers he doesnt want to leave. For those expecting a tidy ending that leaves you feeling warm and mushy...beware. Margeret Cho co-stars as a waitresses bearing sage advice, with a liking for strong women with guns. Bobcat Goldwaith plays the part of the self pleasuring waiter always escaping to the bathroom.",998265600,,759,4.9763779527559056
7911236,4,B00000IPF8,"I almost turned it off but a half hour into it and I was hooked.  Garofolo and Rouse are excellent and Rouse is not too bad to look at either.  The standup supporting cast adds humor to this dark movie.  You'll either hate this movie or love it but one thing is for sure, you will never forget the characters.  They are engrained in my brain forever.",998006400,,350,4.17910447761194
7911237,5,B00000IPF8,"Wow. I watched it on HBO yesterday, was just channel surfing, and it caught my attention because of how dark the film's setting was. And I haven't been so captivated by a movie in a long time. Garofalo is fascinating as a bipolar manic depressive. The man, Arliss (Rouse), turns out to be unusually complex.
It's a manic-depressive movie about a manic-depressive woman, and it takes you right along on the emotional roller-coaster that will let you feel the disorder first hand.
Feel like watching a really strong drama? This is it.",995500800,2,532,4.793478260869565
7911238,5,B00000IPF8,"This movie is just completely breathtaking.  Not for those looking for a  happy ending, but so completely powerful and poignant.  Janeane Garofalo  really shows her acting chops in this one.  I have never seen an actor play  a person with severe depression so completely.  It's very touching and very  true to the human experience.  The characters in this movie are real people  - as warped as they may seem.  It's beautiful.  Gives you something to  think about for a long time after.  This movie makes me want to shake  Janeane's hand.  Just a remarkable performance!  This movie is a MUST-SEE  for the Garofalo fan.  Just don't expect it to be funny.",969235200,3,653,4.7207207207207205
7911239,5,B00000IPF8,"When I first saw that this movie was available on the shelves of my local  video store, I grabbed it, plunked down my hard earned cash and ran home,  giddy in the knowledge that I was about to see a very dark and disturbing  film.  See, one of the first things I noticed was that Ms. Garofalo herself  was a producer, and that to me was a good sign.  Finally a film where she  could spread her creative wings and give her best performance.  And I was  not disappointed.  While it's not Hamlet, this film breaks through the  typical barriers and doesn't play by the same rules as other films do.  And  the biggest barrier of all is the notion that a film HAS to have a  ""Disney-esque"" ending to be a good film.
And that's all I'm  going to say about the ending.
The setting for this film is so simple,  it's amazing.  Apartment, coffee house, bathroom, roof, street.  That's  about it.  And because the actors aren't fighting against scenery, you get  to pay attention to what the characters are REALLY saying.
Garofalo  brings a dark outlook on life that has only been really hinted at in her  other films. (At least when you comare them to this one.) In addition,  Margaret Cho and Bobcat Goldthwait only add to this film with their  portrayals of innocent bystanders, caught up in the moment that is Jasmine  (Garofalo) and Arliss (Mitch Rouse).
And what a moment it is.  Emotional states ranging from anger, love, confusion, hate, misery and  panic are just a few that are touched on.  For anyone that has been in a  similar moment, this movie is very real.  The anger is right.  The panic is  right.  And the love is right too, which might just be the hardest thing of  all about this film.
See this film.  Understand it.  It will change the  next date you have.",965865600,5,1766,4.420062695924765
7911240,5,B00000IPF8,"I didn't even know this film existed until i stumbled upon it at the video store. I've been leary about renting any more movies with janine garofalo only becuz i've been devestatedly disappointed with ""the truth about cats and dogs"", ""the matchmaker"", and ""bye bye  love"". The ironic thing is, im such the fan of janine garofalo it's  not even funny.  I finally found a film where she rocks. This film is what  i've been dying to see janine do. It was such the perfect role for her, and  it was filmed in such a way that was creative and art house-ish.
I also  loved the performances by Margaret Cho and Bobcat Goldswaith.  I love their  sense of humour, and along with janine, this makes such a raucous dark  comedy.  There are so many memorable quotes in the movie.  The dialogue had  me genuinely laughing hard. This is now my favourite janine garofalo movie.  Considering it's one of her few starring vechicle films, it surpasses  ""reality bites"". Now i want to own it.",955497600,4,973,4.5491329479768785
7911241,5,B00000IPF8,"I absoloutly LOVE this movie! Janeane's acting in it is beautiful and the message is disheartning but clear. This peice is kind of moral and fable like when she says things like ""Don't judge a book by it's cover."" The dialogue is edgy and there is alot of cursing but i wouldn't change any of it. The emotion that's there, the passion that she has in every word she says is unbelievable but you just come to expect that from her if you see enough of her movies. It centers on a man and woman who have met through personal ads (or a singles line) and their first blind date. It's her birthday and when he meets her he doesn't really think she's all that so he wants to leave but she makes him stay with a gun. they end up having a really good time together even with all the turmoil at the beginning and he buys her a present and really starts to like her. Then she drops the bomb of how she's going to kill herself at exactly the moment she was born because she can't live with her depression sickness any longer. He tries to convince her to live but to no avail. I love Janeane Garofalo and all her movies and this has to be my favorite. It's a beautifully acted emotionally draning experience so i agree with the person that said not to watch it when yr really happy becuz that will quickly take you down. just watch it when yr in the mood for a serious drama. You won't be disappointed!",948931200,,1389,4.186567164179104
