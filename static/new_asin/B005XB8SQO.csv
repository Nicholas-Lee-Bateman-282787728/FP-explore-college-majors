Now, as expected from the list of ""adventures"", there was an awful lot on the list that sounded familiar, but on viewing yesterday it turned out to be a lot more familiar than expected. I mean really familiar. I mean, like, I recognized a lot of the footage.

And so tonight I dusted off our copy of the 4 dvd set  of Dan Cruikshanks Around The World In 80 Treasures. Sure enough it seems that along with a few out of place travelogues (with a different narrator) on Finland and Cape Tribulation that the rest of the 52 Adventures are culled from footage of Dan's 80 Treasures made by cutting out the scenes in which he appears, giving up on 30 of his Treasures and dubbing on a new commentary - largely based on the original.

The only reason to get and watch this would be if you couldn't get hold of the original. It isn't bad, although each segment is very rushed, but the original is far, far better.",1335571200,8,1069,4.2
