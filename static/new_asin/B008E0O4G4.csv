5153541,5,B008E0O4G4,"An intimate visit with the artist in his studio.  It was a joy to watch him engaged in his creative process, and to see his paintings unfold.  He's very adept with both brush and squeegee.  It was delicious to watch.",1353888000,7,216,4.35
5153542,5,B008E0O4G4,"I bought and watched this DVD and learned a lot about the life of a major artist (80 yrs. old)and the contemporary art world. From this DVD I learned that G. Richter has multiple commitments for shows, just as he works on more than one painting at a time. His assistants! build models of museums and galleries and puts little paintings on the wall. He admits that some of his paintings don't work and will have to be painted over. Gerhard doesn't entertain the camera. Once he ponders if the camera makes it impossible for him to paint a successful painting. But he does tolerate the camera and does his rather ordinary thing. With his unique tools that he has crafted he paints luscious abstract paintings and attends openings and interviews. I don't want to get lost in giving you details. Let me summarize.
If you love contemporary painting this is a rare glimpse of an ordinary genius doing the business of contemporary art. Warning: sometimes it is boring. Yes, that fact is not hidden. He is not a showman like Dali. More like Picasso; it is just work. But so much is revealed. Also the soundtrack is an excellent selection of modern classical music including John Cage's Music for Marcel Duchamp.
I am so glad I bought this. It is a valuable resource. I'm sure when I watch it again, subtitled when they are not speaking English, I will discover something else. I'm glad it is in my collection.",1350172800,3,1401,4.608

this dvd is an attempt to explore the inner workings of the creative process of a great contemporary artist. what is highlighted in the inexpressible process of the artist's thinking and feeling as he works on his paintings until the ""moment"" of achievement is met. richter admits to not knowing from the get go what he is intending to achieve. his large size squeegees create transformations of the initial hand made painting, and the mechanical process offers him the opportunity for the painting to have a life of it's own. in watching this, the viewer is fascinated, puzzled, bored, and transfixed looking at an artist, but not quite seeing into his inner psyche. richter is often both self deprecating and humorous about the ""unknowable"" in mulling over the creative process. the film tends to be rather slow moving and at times lumbering, but it is none-the-less, a wonderful inside view of a great artist at work.",1348963200,21,1085,5.703703703703703

5153549,3,B008E0O4G4,"While the body of the movie gives a great perspective on Richter and his process- I would add a criticism of one of the features- where Mr. Benjamin Buchloh interviews the master and the conversation drones on into more and more ""abstract"" formulations...um...I though french critics were bad...but then Richter goes right along.
such terms as ""indeterminate linguistic formulations""...the conversation never mentions money, never mentions sexuality, never mentions other German modern masters such as Anselm Kiefer. What do they think?
We'll never know- and more's the pity.
Buchloh speaks of no musicality in the Munich exhibited works?

5153552,4,B008E0O4G4,"Always interesting documentary on the artist Gerhard Richter, his work process and his sometimes uneasy relationship with the larger world outside his studio.

The film effectively combines a mix of traditional documentary techniques (interviews, archival footage), and much more cinema verite style, where for long stretches we simply observe Richter working on his paintings with no comment (besides his own occasional mutterings).

Through it all, I gained a much deeper understanding of the man and his work. I've always struggled to really appreciate abstract expressionism and it's absence of obvious meaning. But somehow, watching this film and the process of creation of these works, I found myself far more pulled into the painting themselves than I would ever have been otherwise. (Note  Richter has worked in many forms and medium besides the abstract expressionist paintings he was focused on during the making of the film).

Likewise the quiet, introverted, but wryly funny Richter becomes an ever more rich and likable subject  even his cranky unease at being constantly filmed is understandable and ultimately a bit endearing. His struggle to deal with the commercial side of the art world, and the desire to retreat back to the safety of his studio make him tremendously human.

I also appreciated how sensual the film was. Not in any sexual sense of the term, but how Belz managed to make us feel the physical aspects of the painting process  the thickness of the paint, the muscular effort to spread it across the canvas, even the smell of the room seem to come through the screen.

In the end - for me - this wasn't an 'essential' or 'change your life' documentary. I wasn't deeply moved, nor do I think I will be haunted by its images years from now. Yet I appreciated being given a way in to an art form and a person who made my life a little richer, and whom I might have never really known otherwise.",1473033600,,1923,4.877300613496932

5153554,5,B008E0O4G4,"The insights, derived through the camera eye combined with the ballsy and naive questions posed by the interviewer, make this a must-see for artists.  Mr. Richter's humble and openly honest demeanor lets us into his motivations and methodology, while his discomfort with the camera echoes the privacy we studio artists need to feel free to commit to the work.  He works until he can see nothing more wrong.  This raw film, devoid of fluff and fill, is as good as being there, there is nothing left to change.",1470873600,,508,4.75

5153561,2,B008E0O4G4,Gerhard Richter Painting gets low marks due to the lazy filmmaking (with the boom coming into shots) and is overall not very good as a documentary.

5153573,5,B008E0O4G4,"What an interesting documentarty.  I was intrigued by the ""block"" that being observed was to him.  The reveal of the inner workings of this marvelous talent was wonderful to watch.  I will be watching this over and over again.  Unfortunately for me, I don't get to go to Europe anymore, so I won't be seeing any of his work unless they do a retrospective of his work here in the mid-West in the near future.  I wish that my own art work was so well received.  But, as an artist, I paint for  myself first, and for anyone else that may like it, I thank them.

Also like Richter, I paint in watercolors, oil, acrylic, and latex & enamel house paints.  I do landscapes, seascapes, and abstracts.  This being said, this is why I enjoyed this documentary so much, I believe that an artist NEEDS to get outside of his mainstream method in order to bring new life into it.  I don't ever want the desire to be a mid-West Pollock to be lost if I can prevent the staleness of my artwork from creeping in, I hope to stay relevant to myself much as Gerhard Richter is.  I commend him and salute him and thank the filmmakers for creating this salute to a modern genius.",1426550400,,1156,4.300925925925926
5153574,4,B008E0O4G4,"I enjoyed this movie a lot. One of its most appealing elements is getting to hear Richter share his painter's wisdom and philosophy. He has a knack for being able to verbalize very abstract ideas and thoughts regarding his experiences with the creative process and his impressions of his work as far as aesthetics are concerned. And he's able to do that in terse sentences, versus being long-winded and convoluted like some other artists.

Another perk of the film is getting to sample Richter's personality. For those who may have never heard him speak, he might come off as somewhat of a grouch, for instance. But he has a pretty charming sense of humor that's infused with his insight and wisdom.

The only thing I would change about the film is add more footage of him painting in the studio. Instead, the scenes of him painting are mingled with behind-the-scenes footage of his staff organizing exhibitions and taking care of other practical details. But at the same time, I am biased because I'm an artist myself and absolutely love being a proverbial fly on the wall in other artists' studios.",1425427200,2,1100,4.78421052631579
5153575,2,B008E0O4G4,"Disappointing, slow, boring.  There is nothing here that sheds light on Gerhard Richter as a man or his development as a painter.

There are scenes where Gerhard is just painting and staring at the canvas and I'm not sure how interesting those segments will be for 'non artist types.' For me, I felt every though he was vocalizing. I 'know' those moments. It was exciting to have it captured so subtly.
I believe any abstract painter will surely enjoy this film. ! Perfect amount of studio time, conversations, history, gallery planning, art-busy-ness, personal technique, etc. I would watch again in a heartbeat!",1391040000,12,695,4.898305084745763

I still remember how exiting it was to see a display of his abstractions at the top of the stairs as I was visiting his retrospective at the San Francisco Museum of Modern art about ten years ago. Like Czanne's works, they seem to emit some kind of like from the inside of the work.

This video is good insofar as it shows him painting and offers some sense of his career. It isn't nearly as robust as the one Corinna Belz did in the 1990s, when she interviewed him extensively. Perhaps it is unfair to look at them comparatively.
