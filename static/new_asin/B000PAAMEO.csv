2814746,5,B000PAAMEO,"What an excellent product. Technical quality is flawless but much more important, the subject and the treatment of it is first class.

I remember when at school, studying history, we read about how victors in war since centuries ago destroyed everything related to their enemies. Unfortunately the same thing happened with the Third Reich. Thinking that the Nazi problem was in the hardware instead of the software (ideas on people's minds) the Allied Powers destroyed everything they could put their hands on. Just to mention:

-the New Chancellery building
-the Flak Towers
-The Berghof
-the submarines shelters
-Hitler Bunkers
-Spandau Prison

These were impressive, even beautiful engineering pieces but above all, they had a story to tell. A bad and terrible story, never to happen again, but a story nonetheless.

Thanks to this DVD I could see that some of these Nazi era buildings have survived the anti-Nazi hysteria and we still can learn history from them.

VERY, VERY nice product. I absolutely recommend it",1281744000,19,1019,5.151515151515151
2814747,5,B000PAAMEO,"Finally!!A video about Hitler and the Third Reich that isn't a re-hash of the same old thing you see on the history channel and elsewhere. I was completely unaware that these enormous castle like structures even exsisted, yet providing the training for Hitler's elite political soldiers. The architecture is intriguing and beautiful. I am not supporting the purpose of these schools, only the unique design. The unusual B&W archival film together with the current footage, makes this video a truley special program. Very,very highly recommended.",1186790400,40,545,5.423529411764706
2814748,5,B000PAAMEO,"This was probably the most interesting video I've seen on Hitler's Third Reich. Most videos I've watched on this subject are pretty much all the same. But this was completely different. The video not only focused on the unique architecture of the Order Castles, but presented an intriguing insight into the education system of the time and how the Nazi's used the schools to indoctrinate their youth. For those interested in both art and architecture the program is a definite must. All of R.J.Adam's videos are great!!",1186617600,35,519,4.977011494252873
8189986,4,B000PAAMEO,A good dvd on the history of germany's ww2 sites.,1461801600,,49,4.0
8189987,1,B000PAAMEO,Seller refused to honor guarantee. Product not up to expectations and requested exchange. Seller went by purchase date and not mail date. Stuck with item and not able to view because of stalling during play time. The only reason I am giving one star is to be allowed to post a comment to warn other buyers.,1442275200,,306,4.482142857142857
8189988,4,B000PAAMEO,This dvd is advertised as a two disc version. I received one disc in a two dvd case. I don't know if I am missing a dvd or if they have changed the format. The dvd I received lasts about 60 mins and seems complete. The content was quite interesting but not outstanding.,1435881600,,269,4.09433962264151
8189989,5,B000PAAMEO,Glad these places survived both the bombing and the horrible Nazis.  Amazing that people who could build these were also duped by evil men.,1419120000,,139,4.791666666666667
8189990,5,B000PAAMEO,What a sad movie about Hitler and his complete control he had on the German Youth. So sad that such a crazy person can take hold of a whole country. And what he did to the citizens is amazingly sad.,1391990400,,198,3.975
8189991,5,B000PAAMEO,"This  is  a  Very  interesting  Compilation  of  The  Pomp  &  Ceremony  of  The  Third  Riech !  The  Hitler  Youth  Was  An  Organization  For  Young  Teenagers  Which  Taught  Them  To  See  The  Glory  &  Honor  of  Adolf  Hitlers  Dream  Germania  Which  Would  Take  The  Place  of  Berlin !  The  Book  Was  Well  Written  and  Character  Development  Was  impeccable .  The  Allies  Were  The  War  Criminals  For  Attacking  Dresden ,  Cologne,  and  Many  Other  Cities  Which  Had  No  Military  Significance  and  Were  Sanctuaries  For  Civilians  Whose  Homes  Had  Been  Destroyed  in  Other  Cities .  Then  At  Wars  End  They  Allowed  Jews  And  Others  To  Roam  About  Shooting  People  at  will  and  The  British  Started  WW  II  By  The  Unprovoked  Declaration  of  War  Because  Germany  Took  Back  Territory  Lost  During  the  First  World  War  in  Poland .  They  Should  Have  Had  War  Crime  Trials  For  Britain , USA, and  Russia  !",1391472000,,969,4.621621621621622
8189992,5,B000PAAMEO,"A fascinating insight into Third Reich architecture, very well presented and researched. You should consider releasing it in Region 2 format to give it the wider audience that it deserves. Many thanks",1388188800,2,200,5.28125
8189993,2,B000PAAMEO,"Not what I expected, boring and nothing really new. The reviews lead me to believe this would be interesting. Nope.",1383955200,,115,4.8
8189994,5,B000PAAMEO,Is was a very good documentary on the Hitler Youth. It shows how the Nazi brainwashed their children to make them feel a lot more superior to all the other races. But at the end it didn't succeed.,1363824000,5,196,4.184210526315789
8189995,4,B000PAAMEO,"As usual, the producers of these films explore the architecture of the Nazis and invariably the culture & history. You will not see this footage elsewhere - it is material potentially ""boring"" or of no consequence to the War, made pertinent and interesting by the producers and by the architecture itself.

Very good work, on a/from a different tangent/angle.",1363046400,6,359,5.084745762711864
