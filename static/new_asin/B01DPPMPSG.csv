7721432,5,B01DPPMPSG,"There have been more books written about the OJ Simpson case than there were about September 11th. With that in mind, I never fully immersed myself into the whole story. To me, it was information overkill so I didn't feel like I ""had"" to learn about this as much as other true crime cases. I was only about 6 when the whole fiasco took place but I had heard enough to keep myself occupied.. Or so I thought. About a year ago is when I started dabbling in more literature about him/her/it: Toobin's book, Darden's, Marcia Clark's, Shapiro's and a few of the seedier cash in books (Read: Resnick..and she totally spread) and after reading them i felt myself wanting more. Since so much of this took place in front of a live television camera (the arrest, the chase, the trial) I wound up in a Youtube wormhole of any archival footage I could find and after about 40 hours (yeah I checked) of pretrial, trial, and all that type of footage, I thought myself pretty much an expert on the case. This doc produced by ESPN is that Youtube wormhole and much more. A deep look at not only OJ, his life and the crime but the racial tensions leading up to the LA riots and the history of the LAPD with minorities. Although many documentaries have been made about OJ, none of them felt like they had that ""punch"" that REALLY told the/his FULL story, all the way through. 2 hours simply isn't enough. Not only was this a terrible crime and a terrible injustice but it was also that type of ""Cause clbre"" that brought EVERYONE out of the woodwork from all angles. So much of this was left out of the much hyped (but still very well acted) American Crime Story: The People V. OJ Simpson, so I was glad to see that detailed here as well. I'm hoping more archival footage is put on the bluray release of this doc, maybe as special features because it would be fantastic to have THE DEFINITIVE bluray for THE DEFINITIVE OJ Simpson documentary. Highly suggested",1467072000,6,1941,4.439775910364146
7721433,5,B01DPPMPSG,"This is one of the best long-form documentaries I can remember seeing. It worked hard to win me over because the whole OJ Simpson circus was something that never cared much of anything about. I watched a short bit of it by accident and got hooked. Its amazing as a character study, a history of the decline & fall of the LAPD and race relations in LA at multiple class levels. It is also a very useful set of material on the flaws of the criminal justice system and how money corrupts it. Its occasionally mean to people who didn't participate (Chris. Darden in particular), but its so good that its flaws can be forgiven.

The story is told through individual interviews carefully put together into a chronological narration. Whats brilliant is that an enormous amount of information is presented to the viewer without any actual narration or biographical information to tell us who these people are. The pieces of interviews are so well put together that they tell the story with no assistance. And even more amazing, they are able to sustain the narrative over many, many hours of documentary. I don't think I've ever seen anything like it or at least this well done.

The only flaw in the lack of narration is that they are entirely dependent on those who are interviewed to make their points. Where this goes wrong is when someone (Marcia Clark for example) says things that are self-serving and there is nobody interviewed who is willing to go after her.

The only flaws in it are aspects of OJ' Simpson's life that could not be gone into because certain people declined to participate. The lack of participation by his first wife leaves a major gap in the story. As well, we are left without the perspective of one of the prosecutors which has the unfortunate effect of other people being able to shape perceptions of him. And there is Marcus Allen who is strongly suggested to have had an affair with his friend OJ Simpon's ex-wife.

OJ Simpson comes across as an entitled, selfish narcissist. The question it can't answer however is if he was born that way or he became that way as a consequence of the entitled life of a successful athlete. He was social climber who seemed to care little about his family other than in the sense of something that he needed for his ambitions and that he owned. Its made rather clear that in marriage he was never faithful and never home.

I think goes too far in repeatedly hammering on the point that simpson was ""too white"" in the way he lived. And it somewhat manages to counter its own point on that by showing the color of his closest friends. Its somewhat playing with the cliche that being ""in the community"" is equal to flattering politicians, church leaders and community leaders. But that is not entirely true. The idea that Simpson should not have been allowed certain defenses in the court because he wasn't of ""the community"" is actually kind of insulting beyond just being wrong. He was entitled to any defense in court that the jury accepted and the judge allowed.

Large parts of the documentary deal with the problems between LAPD and the African American community in LA. A number of awful incidents are highlighted that many people either never knew about or forgot about. It makes a rather good case about how the LAPD got out of control and how a police culture of protecting their own at all costs eventually leads to corruption and incompetent behavior. That is a major point to be made about the Simpson trial. Solid evidence and a good case was often undermined by people who no longer acted professionally, no longer followed procedure and allowed troublemakers to stay in jobs they should have been pushed out of. The other telling point is the department's complete and total failure of leadership during the Rodney King riots. They also do a good job on tracing the long rise of johnny cochran in LA.

The marriage, the abuse of his wife and the murders are dealt with in graphic detail. But about all it does new is perhaps push it right in the viewers face how crazy Simpson was and how brutal the murders were.

The defense lawyers all come across bad. Since johnny cochran is gone, they interview one of his guys. He doesn't across well, has no particular charm and just says things that look bad. Several of the other attorneys as much as disown what they did in the case. None of the defense team seems to have like each other much. Rather than a team, it seemed like they all cut out individual roles for themselves in the defense and were acting autonomously. johnny cochran is there as the black face to speak to the mostly black jury.  Robert Shapiro and Robert Kardashian were political fixers in LA.  F. Lee Bailey was there to do one easy cross-examination. Barry Scheck was there to discredit the DNA evidence. Alan Dershowitz,contribution is anyone's guess. Many of the lawyers for the defense that appear either disown what happened in the trial or blame others for it. Robert Shapiro attacking the other attorneys shortly after the win is a very surreal moment. Of course its easy to speculate that Robert Shapiro's statements after the trial were political and cynically designed to play to the hostile views of mostly white other clients and potential clients.

As to the case itself, it was won in jury selection. The prosecutors fall all over themselves to explain how they ended up with a jury that was a stacked deck loaded against them. But it was their own fault. By the end, when one of the jurors turns out to be a former panther, its kind of clear that the prosecution failed entirely to do its job in selection. They strangely admit how bad Marcia Clark came across in front of practice juries (they hated her), but fail to explain why they kept her on the case. Because he didn't participate, Chris Darden gets slammed by everyone and blamed for everything.

As to the trial, my impression is that the judge was largely at fault for turning it into a circus. The defense lawyers can't really be blamed for it because its their job to push things in the courtroom to the limit while it is the job of the judge to restrain them. It was the judge that allowed the case to get off the facts. It was the judge who did things like allow the field trip where the jury took a tour inside Simpson's home. It was the judge that law the defense put the police on trial. In the long run, I don't think any of it made any difference other than extending the trial out. The jury selection process really seems in retrospect to have been either entirely incompetent or corrupt.

The decision to put the trial on television in full was also probably in retrospect a terrible mistake. Everyone was playing to the cameras rather than to the jury or the facts of the case. Often what happened in the courtroom seemed to be about playing to the media. But who can fault these people. It made of them famous and launched some of them on new careers.

We get more than one view from the jury. We get one woman who is absolutely rational in explaining her reaction to the trail. We get another old woman who comes across as -------- crazy. I don't think the crazy woman added anything. The majority (black women) on the jury seemed to have no particular sympathy for a battered wife.

The parts that follow the trial are really interesting as well. Simpson wins, but it most respects the whole world becomes his jail. He becomes a total social outcast. He scatters his personal posessions among people he thinks are his friends to protect his wealth from the civil verdict and then has most everything stolen.

Then there is the move to Florida. He surrounds himself with the only people who still respect him: Lowlifes, drug addicts, women with cocaine habits and borderline criminals. He gives into hedonism and seems to slowly drive himself crazy. It was as if the furies of Greek Mythology were actually pursuing him for the murder.

He then goes to Las Vegas and gets involved in events that are so crazy that they can only probably be explained by the fact that everyone was taking lots of drugs. Though it never says it directly, I think the documentary makes a good case that he was set up by his lowlife friends. One guy records the whole incident and sells it to TMZ. They steal things that simpson has no claim to. What makes me wonder most about the whole thing is that none of things Simpson wanted were actually in the hotel room.

Simpson is then faced with the law again. But he is no longer important to much of anyone. He is no longer rich. He is no longer politically important to community leaders like he was in LA. The judge isn't interested in being a celebrity. And he gets a much more typical jury than what he got in the murder trial. They threw the book at him and he got a sentence which was as unjust as his getting off the murder charge was unjust. Everyone else involved seemed to be given a break including multiple people who deserved equal punishment with Simpson.",1466726400,22,8978,4.569297700435053
7721434,5,B01DPPMPSG,"One of the best documentaries I've ever watched.  It was impossible to live through the nineties and not be aware of the Simpson trial.  Most of us, unless we were big football fans or legal buffs, watched it with some interest but were not enthralled with it.  The verdict, when rendered, was a shock to most.  I was one of the ones holding out some hope that maybe O.J. didn't do it.  After watching this excellent series, there is no doubt in my mind that he ""got away with murder(s)"".  His fall into debauchery and filth after the trial is documented in some detail here, and his final comeuppance, while gratifying to some, is just what he deserved to get (and more).  Absolutely fascinating, the evolution of O.J. from street kid to supernaturally talented athlete, Heisman trophy winner, Hall of Fame football player, celebrity, and a man who truly believed that ""I'm not black, I'm O.J.""  Race relations and the troubled history of race relations between the LAPD and the black community are explored in great depth.  Clearly, that had more of an impact on the verdict than the mountain of evidence that should have convicted Simpson.  The irony that his race is what ultimately got him the ""innocent"" verdict from an almost all-black jury is one of the lynch-pins of the film.  For most of his adult life, Simpson courted and lived in a cult of white celebrity, wealth, and fame.  This is a tragedy of Shakespearean depths.  A must-see.",1466726400,4,1445,4.709163346613546
7721435,5,B01DPPMPSG,"Some reviewers have insisted that ""O.J.: Made in America"" is sufficiently compelling to hold any spectator's attention for its 11- hour duration.  Not only is that a tall order but it's misleading, especially if it produces in any American over the age of 30 expectations of seeing documentary footage that's unfamiliar--images new and sensational enough to lead to a single binge-watching of a truly remarkable documentary about O.J., his trial, and the consequences of not knowing why ""black lives matter.""  Guilty or not, O.J. was acquited by experts and rhetoricians who completely outmatched and overwhelmed the prosecution.

""Made in America"" is a most ambitious, labor-intensive, artfully-arranged montage of documentary footage that, without the assistance of some unidentified 3rd-person narrator, tells the story of O.J.--from his emergence as a college football star to his success as a franchise player in the NFL, from his post-career steps and missteps to his lucky break and bigger mistake. The viewer is left to judge whether O.J. is guilty or innocent--or if, by now, even matters.  The film makes clear that, although O.J. became a symbol of black people and their struggles for justice in America, he had associated and identified almost exclusively with an elitist white comunity. Therefore, we're led to believe, the black community was seriously misguided, even gullible, to make O.J. of all black celebrities the carrier of the banner for civil liberties and justice.  My question is: does it really make any difference whom O.J. selected as his friends and intimates before the trial?  Marica Clark, among other voices in the film, seems to think that it did.  To this viewer--who watched the trial and commentary on a day-by-day/night-by-night basis on MSNBC--O.J.'s preference for white friends wasn't relevant to the consciousness-raising issue of race and its role in American society. Regardless of the friends we associate with, we retain the color of our skin.

That was one of the few details that didn't ring true. A few things that did strike me this time around:

1. O.J.'s magnificence as a running back during the year that he gained 2000 years for the Bills;

2. The appearance of Mark Fuhrman--first as a potentially heroic, exceptional member of the LAPD; then suddenly a problematic participant in the trial--one who still seems shell-shocked--unable to comprehend how a single mistake in the past, long before the trial, could be uncovered and become an indelible ""fatal flaw"" following him to this day. Even after a seond mistake is uncovered--the discovery and surrender of the audio tapes he made at the request of a writer--in which he ""overacts"" the part of a racist cop, Fuhrman is a crushed, destroyed individual, his life no less a train wreck than O.J.'s.  I could feel the prosecution's intense hatred of the man who had ""blown"" their case, but watching him trying to understand his own sad story even as he's describing it was enough to make him a more sympathetic figure in my mind than he was at the time of the trial.  Today, he appears to have grown as a human being.

3. Barry Scheck sounds even more shrill than I remembered him: ""How about THAT Mr. Hong?""  His scorching, excoriating words to a a neophyte criminologist who suddenly looks like a lost, bullied boy looking for his mother.

4. Johnny Cochran's utterly smooth fielding of Darden's petition to Judge Ito, asking him to suppress prior evidence because it would introduce the race card.  In his counter-argument, Cochran performs a triple play: Frist,.slaughtering Darden; 2nd, introducing the evidence in question; and third, playing the race card for all its worth while feigning ""mock horror"" that any black would believe that a single word (the ""N"" word) could affect the ""objectivity"" of a black juror after all of the ""real"" violence in L.A.  In this film Cochran's play-acting, especially his climactic defense in which he elevates the proceedings from race to Nazi Germany, seems more obvious than ever before..  Only in seeing it now does it strike me as a ""performance"" upstaging the famous ""ill-fitting glove.""  He comes off as a folk hero who becomes witness to his own coronation--a diminutive figure with a silver tongue, not to mention an extremely flashy dresser.

[Personal Note: Shaprio's apparent disgust and subsequent disassociation from Cochran for invoking Hitler in his closing argument is understandable.  At the time Cochran said it, I felt the same disgust as Shapiro, and when the final decision was shown to us in split screen, my spirit was with the silenced whites, not with the half of the screen showing blacks celebrating outside the courtroom. Afterwards, the contention by many blacks that, guilty or not, the O.J. decision was justified as ""pay back"" rang hollow for me, especially when it came within 2-3 hours following a trial which, after many months, had produced a mountain of incriminating evidence.  But looking back upon the decision  today, when America's ""sensitivity"" toward Israel is milked for all its worth by a Hawkish Congress determined to ""expose"" the perceived weakness of a hated President, it's America--with its troubled history of slavery--that suffers an injustice no less severe.  In 2002 Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu entered the halls of Congress to give a speech, urging a revenge-minded America, after 9/11, to invade a country that had nothing to do with 9/11.  Again in 2015 Netanyahu was invited, by House Speaker Boehner, to return for the purpose of giving a speech to placate a Congress incensed by their President's optimistic, positive State of the Union Address. It was another Hawkish speech, except this time aimed at the recent U.S. peace treaty with Iran. Netanyah broke his country's rules surrounding elections, overrode Obama's objections, and ensured his own election and the public humiliation (albeit momentary) of a U.S. President.  The gleeful reception the Prime Minister received from the House struck me as eerily similar to the clamor of the present film's shots of blacks responding gleefully to the Simpson verdict. At that moment, I changed my mind.  Without diminishing the offense taken by Shapiro over Cochran's use of the ""H"" word, I couldn't help but ask myself: Who are WE, of all people, to blame black people throughout America for seeing the O.J. verdict as ""pay-back"" for centuries of injustice?

5. The parallel rise of O. J. Simpson and the fall of Christopher Darden.  As things go bad for the prosecutors, and after Cochran has not only rebuked Darden's attempt to keep out the ""race card"" but hung it around Darden's own neck, the mannerisms I formerly mistook for Darden's usual understated way of conducting business take on a whole new meaning.  It's clear from this documentary that the prosecution's defeats and his own fear of failure were building up in Darden to an excutiatingly painful degree.  And when the suggestion is made that Simpson's mounting successes inside and outside the courtroom were making Darden feel almost like an ""Uncle Tom,"" the point is entirely credible.  Marsha Clark for the first time (to my ears) adamantly insists that she repeatedly argued with Darden AGAINST making O.J.--in full view of the court and the entire world--try on the bloody glove (which the defense maintained had been planted).  It would be seen, at best, as a mock-heroic move and, at worst, as a ""bad fit.""  A lose-lose situation and a fool-hardy move by the prosecution.  And when Darden ignores Clark and goes for the ""coup-de-grace"" only to come up short--way short--we're positioned to feel the one prosecutors' intense irritation and the other's total humiliation and defeat.

Memories are not that long, and even in our current state of national unrest and racial polarization, I doubt that Darden's reputation as ""selling out his race"" holds any water compared to the knowledge--increasingly held by blacks as well as whites--that  1. O.J. did it;  2. he was perhaps justified in ""beating the rap"" but lucky as well; 3. he squandered the opportunity he had been given, throwing away the freedom so precious to black people throughout their history.  In the end, O.J. became a tarnished hero and, for many of his own race, a blot in the struggle to be free at last.  Darden's moment of impulsive pride is one we have all experienced and can learn from; O.J.'s hubris, on the other hand, was of a totally different order.

And now we come to the most imporant question of all:  Was O.J.'s fall ""tragic"" or ""pathetic.""  Was it the ""fatal flaw"" of a potentially noble hero, temporarily blinded by pride and self-importance?  Or was O.J. the victim of the circumstances of America, its racism and violence, and its celebrity culture?  Was his fallure Shakespearean and universal?  Or was it cultural-specific?  Was O. J. made ""in"" America or ""by"" America?  The former question acknowledges the free choice offered the individual in American democracy, with no guarantees that the offer will be ""fair"" or the outcome ""just.""  The latter places the individual in a system that's ""rigged"" against him and is ultimately to blame for whatever he becomes--man or monster.

The film offers ample evidence for viewers to play jury before issuing their final judgments about  O. J., about America, and about the relation between the two.  It's a comprehensive yet detailed picture that should be viewed from the very beginning and in its entirety (I chose to view it in 30+ minute installments over the course of a month).

The documentary is not Shakespeare, but it may be as close as many present-day viewers will get to what's at stake in Shakespearean tragedy.  If the film succeeds in making Americans look inward--reflecting on matters of race, celebrity, violence, freedom and responsibility--it will have proven itself many times over.  This may be the one film about O.J. that's not merely another exploitive spin-off about an American idol whose fall led to the trial of the century.  We've all already been there, done that.  This documentary invites us to move on.",1466640000,7,10110,5.063932448733413
7721436,5,B01DPPMPSG,"A little less than a century ago as of this writing, ""The Crime of the Century"" was the Lindbergh Kidnapping case, beginning with the kidnapping and eventual slaying of aviator Charles Lindbergh's son Charles Lindbergh Jr. in 1932 and ending with a conviction of a German immigrant in 1935. Similar to the O.J. Simpson case of about 65 years later, the Lindbergh Kidnapping trial had the same kind of sensationalism: celebrity, murder, and public obsession. Reporters and newspapers were constantly offering up-to-date coverage to a public who couldn't get enough about the Lindbergh case. However, there is one huge difference between the two cases. While the Lindbergh case did reveal American distrust of immigrants in certain circumstances, it did not have the biting racial hostility which erupted into public view as with the O.J. Simpson case of the mid 1990's and the Rodney King case which occurred only three years earlier. What began as a case about the guilt or innocence of O.J. Simpson, famous American Football player and movie star, became a referendum about race.

The present documentary ""O.J.: Made in America"" is more than a chronological account of the events leading up to the murder of O.J. Simpson's ex-wife, Nicole Brown-Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman, and the eventual indictment and acquittal of O.J. Simpson. It's really both a history of O.J. Simpson and the historical context of race relations in the United States in the mid-to-late 20th century, particularly in Los Angeles. Other athletes who fought the injustice of racial segregation and prejudice are briefly profiled, such as the late Mohammed Ali (formerly Cassius Clay) and track stars Tommie Smith and John Carlos who famously raised their fists to signify ""Black Power"" at the 1968 Olympics held in Mexico City. During much of this tumultuous time, O.J. Simpson is strangely absent from the conflict even though he played football for USC and then eventually for the Buffalo Bills from the late 1960's and throughout the 1970's. (He ended his football career with the San Francisco 49ers at the end of the decade.)

Probably the most revealing aspect of the documentary which chronicles O.J.'s life is how disassociated he was from the African-American community and their struggles for racial equality. Yes, certainly he had African-American friends, but according to interviews in the documentary, he ingratiated himself into the upper-crust of the White community. At certain times in his career he is asked to participate in the cause of racial justice, but he declines, sometimes saying he's not an African-American, but instead saying ""I'm O.J."" For a time O.J. Simpson was quite possibly the most recognizable athlete in the United States, but he declined to use his status to assist in the cause of racial integration and judicial equality. While at face value there is nothing inherently wrong with his attitudes, it becomes a strange set-up for the events which follow. He divorced his African-American wife of nearly 12 years, Marguerite L. Whitley, and married white aspiring model and photographer Nicole Brown.

He had become, according to his closest associates, the ""whitest"" African-American in the United States. Even his first commercials with Hertz rental car have subtle undertones of racism. Certainly not overt but subtle. As one interviewee pointed out, when Simpson runs through the airport, he is only acknowledged by Whites. No other African-Americans appear in the advertisement. He is an African-American acknowledged by Whites but that doesn't mean there is a now a categorical acceptance of Blacks among White America. He is the exception rather than the rule.

When O.J.'s former wife Nicole Brown-Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman were found slain, and O.J. became the prime suspect, now the tide of White ""acceptance"" had turned. As long as he was a successful football player, played in modestly successful films, and stayed out of trouble, which may have included the civil rights struggles, the White public embraced him. Now the White community turned on him as they felt betrayed, and the racial divides came under public scrutiny. (It was speculated that if he had been accused of murdering a black woman, the public would not have been nearly as obsessed with the case.) Certainly other celebrities have faced similar scrutiny and public anger, such as the attack on ice skater Nancy Kerrigan which was eventually pinned to her rival Tonya Harding. But none had ever broken down on such clearly racial divides. And when detective Mark Fuhrman, who claimed he found a bloody glove at the Simpson estate, was found to use racially explosive language, the racial tensions of Los Angeles were again displayed nationally. The trial was all but over. Some have speculated it was pay-back for the acquittals of the police officers in the Rodney King case.

This is a fascinating documentary whose subject matter transcends just the guilt or innocence of O.J. Simpson. This story demonstrates how race does and continues to permeate aspects of American life. Interestingly, many Whites have claimed that defense attorney Johnny Cochran went ""out of bounds"" by playing the so-called ""race card"". While I respect those people's points of view, there are too many instances of injustice in which the race card wasn't played, such as in the brutal killing of adolescent Emmett Till in 1955. In no way do I wish to minimize the brutality of the slaying of Nicole Brown-Simpson and Ronald Goldman, but only to say that acts of similar violence and injustice have been perpetrated upon African-Americans and other racial minorities for going on several centuries. The idea that the Simpson acquittal was the grossest miscarriage of justice in the history of United States Jurisprudence is no less than ridiculous. Jim Crowe laws in the south affected thousands if not millions of African-Americans for many decades, some allowing the unjustifiable lynching of many innocent people. Maybe if anything, the case shows that when injustice does happen it is excruciating, no matter which race was victimized.",1466380800,23,6132,5.18989898989899

So many aspects of the case are covered, including the history of racism in Los Angeles, the cult of celebrity, forensic evidence, and our system of justice.  The pieces of this puzzle are perfectly analyzed.

7721439,5,B01DPPMPSG,"Just finished watching this on ESPN... And man oh man, is this film compelling! ""Made in America"" isn't just an eye-catching part of the title of the film - it's an indictment that only in America, with our ugly history of racism, police violence, cult of celebrity, and obsession with athletes, could this happen.

The film does an excellent job painting the picture of how the history of race relations in LA and with the LAPD impacted the events of 1994.  It also dives deeply into the evidence from the trial, the mistakes made by the prosecution, and the ""race card"" played by the defense team.  It's packed full of interviews from the major players of the time and their perspectives are absolutely fascinating.

The filmmakers clearly believe O.J. did it - which in this day in age is a pretty common viewpoint, regardless of race and age.  If you're looking for an objective film... This isn't it.  But if you're looking for a thorough and colorful recap of his life and the cultural impact he made on America, this documentary is likely one you'll enjoy.",1466294400,7,1063,4.688172043010753
7721440,5,B01DPPMPSG,"This is a very different show from the AMERICAN CRIME STORY which just played a short while ago. That was a very well done step by step rendition of his trial for the murder of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson. This, by contrast, is a documentary about every facet of O.J. There was a lot of footage shot of him at every phase of his life so there is no shortage of moving images of him. But added into this are all the ""witnesses"" of his entire life who were there at various points along the way.

We go through his entire time as a football star at USC. It was a huge event for USC to have this big a football star who took them to football glory. He was a hero to virtually everyone on that campus. It is a school which takes its football very seriously. It is clear from this very early point that he does not identify with being a black man. He wants to be a super star and not regarded as black at all. What helps him enormously is that he has a very charming and engaging manner to everyone. He draws people like a magnet.

His next step up is to the Buffalo Bills football team. It is a career which almost came unraveled when he was put into the wrong position. Fortunately, that coach was fired and the new coach knew how to better use him. He's not thrilled about being located in Buffalo in the snow but OJ is willing to do whatever it takes to meet his goals.

It is while he is finishing up with the Bills that he makes the Hertz commercial. This documentary gives us everything on the making of the Hertz commercial with OJ. This is important because it shows multiple facets of his character. In order to make the commercial work, the crew had to get rid of every other black person in the footage and use white people everywhere. That way the audience focused on ""this was OJ, not a black man."" This was fine with him. He said constantly that the black civil rights and empowerment movement was not his thing.

One of the most revealing moments to me was when he was interviewed on tv about his being turned down for a leading part in the film ""Ragtime"" in 1981 which was given to Howard E. Rollins Jr. instead. He was miffed but tried to exude his usual charm to the interviewer. He told her this was the only thing he had ever been turned down for that he'd tried to get. What he was oblivious to was the quality of the artists he wanted to join. Rollins was a world class actor. The director was Milos Forman, formerly a famous foreign film director from Prague, who became American and a major Oscar winner (AMADEUS, ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST). Jimmy Cagney came out of retirement to play a role. It was based on a major novel by E.L. Doctorow. That OJ's charm and sports career failed to win over these major film talents so as to give him the role, clearly astonished him. He couldn't comprehend that they immediately realized he did not have enough acting ability and that was the sole basis for the decision. Simpson had no inkling that there were limitations to his talents and abilities. He expected to succeed at anything he tried.

At every step, the people who worked with him along the way give us their accounts of him. Again, he was so well photographed that when we get to his meeting Nicole, there are lots of pictures of each of them individually and together at the restaurant where she worked and he saw her for the first time.

I think the saddest thing about Nicole Brown Simpson was that her divorce settlement wasn't structured differently. There are different types of alimony. She was an excellent candidate for rehab alimony. This is where the husband pays tuition money for the wife to obtain skills. OJ could have been compelled to pay her college tuition while she learned an employable skill, like nursing or accounting. I think if she had pursued this kind of solution, instead of living amongst and partying with the same social set (derived from him) most of the time, she might still be alive. OJ would have had less interest in a serious drone of a student. He had a lot of interest though in an ex-wife who was dating (or more) people from his circle. She would have still received enough other support from him to adequately support her and the children.

I did not know that Ron Goldman had qualified for belts in martial arts. We hear the details of the fight. I now believe it is likely there was an accomplice who had held Goldman. The theory has always been that the accomplice was OJ's oldest son with his first wife. He was a chef in the area.

I do not watch football. I never have and generally do not care for team sports. This is produced by ESPN. This is the one and only time I have ever seen an ESPN show. I am the least sports oriented person one could meet. Nevertheless, even I found all of the football material about him fascinating.

After OJ's acquittal, he starts spiraling downward. This begins when he realizes he no longer has his white friends. He moves to Southern Florida and gets in with a crowd which is dissolute. He does things with these people that he never sunk to before his criminal law problems. He leads such a bizarre life in Florida that it makes his prior life look normal in comparison. Perhaps the capper in Florida is seeing him in his Elvis Impersonator outfit.

By the time he gets to Vegas, he has no way of appreciating what is criminal conduct and what is not.  He just walks right in and commits armed robbery, kidnapping and a host of other crimes. In his mind he seems to think he's just being OJ again, which used to get him out of any difficulty. Not anymore.

He gets a really long sentence but it is within the provisions of Nevada's penal code. Armed Robbery and Kidnapping are not minor crimes though by anyone's reckoning. So he's still in prison and has been for a long time. I didn't get the sense from blacks or whites, who gave their viewpoints at the end of the show, that this upsets either group in 2016.

This is probably the best media production on OJ which has been done. It is a fully fleshed out portrait and it is impossible to imagine anyone not being interested in it.",1465862400,75,6108,4.366197183098592

7721456,3,B01DPPMPSG,"Of all the documentaries on the case done by a major network, this documentary is the fairest, but there is still a fairly obvious pro-guilty slant. Previous major-network documentaries were so biased and incomplete that O.J.: Made in America looks almost perfect by comparison. However, the documentary fails to adequately discuss evidence that refutes key prosecution claims.

The prosecution's case rested almost entirely on the blood evidence, but the defense presented serious, substantive reasons to doubt the blood evidence. The sock blood and the back-gate blood were clearly planted. The bloody glove was clearly moved from Bundy and planted at O.J.'s house (when Kato went back to the air conditioner with a flashlight at around 11:00, he saw no bloody glove). The Bronco blood is both suspect and explainable, starting with the fact that the two non-police people who looked inside the Bronco days after the murders saw no blood in the interior, and they were both looking for blood because they'd heard on the news that there was blood in the vehicle. The tiny amount of O.J.'s blood that the police said they found on Nicole's driveway might not have been there on the night of the murders: the swatches from Bundy could have been switched with swatches dabbed with blood from O.J.'s blood vial---keep in mind that the LAPD, amazingly, did not log or record *any* of the blood evidence until *four days* after the murders, not to mention that there were serious problems with the chain of custody for the Bundy blood, as Dr. Henry Lee noted during the criminal trial.

The documentary could have also done a better job of pointing out the enormous problems with the prosecution's timeline, such as the fact that their timeline required them to ignore most of the earwitness and eyewitness testimony, which testimony indicated that the murders occurred too late for O.J. to have committed them.

Finally, I wish some attention had been given to the refusal of the LADA's office and the Brown family to authorize the release of the Browns' GTE phone records for the night of the murders. Both Juditha Brown and Lou Brown originally indicated that Juditha called Nicole between 10:00 and 11:00 and spoke to her about the glasses Juditha had left at the Mezzaluna restaurant. Juditha said it was ""shortly before 11:00."" Lou said it was ""closer to 10:00."" Based on these statements, the coroner put the time of death at 11:00. Even if Juditha called Nicole at 10:00 on the dot, this would absolutely rule out O.J. as the killer. Much later, the Browns changed their story and claimed that they left Mezzaluna earlier than they originally said and that Juditha called Nicole at 9:40. However, in order for Juditha to have called Nicole at 9:40, the Browns would have had to make the 70-mile drive from the restaurant to their house in Dana Point in 66 minutes. This is unlikely. That drive included 14 traffic lights and two 90-degree turns, and we know from California state traffic records that traffic was very heavy on that route between 8:00 and 9:00 that night, and that traffic slowed to an average speed of about 30 mph for 8 miles of the 70-mile trip. This issue could be resolved quickly by releasing the Browns' original GTE phone records for that night. However, when O.J. tried to obtain those phone records in 2000, the LADA's office opposed their release and the Browns refused to authorize their release, and a federal judge refused to overrule the Browns. Those records remain sealed to this day.",1501718400,,3520,4.892797319932998

7721462,5,B01DPPMPSG,"I was in my 20s at the time of OJ's trial, and I think that the social issues were simply over my head at the time. Although I was just as transfixed as everybody else, I didn't think very critically about the underlying issues that were being played out. Watching this series has really added to my understanding of the whole thing. The trial was like a perfect storm where social issues and personal psychology came together to make a complex, multi-faceted mosaic. I still believe that he was guilty, but I can also see that his guilt or innocence wasn't the sole issue. There was so much more at stake.

In general, the series does a great job of providing a lot of really important context. But it isn't flawless. There were a couple points where I think they were simply providing a little more of the same, just to fill 1.5 hours. And there was an over-reliance on certain commentators. You had the same people commenting on their personal relationship with OJ, sports, racial relations, and legal issues. The producers could have been a little more selective in that regard.

7721467,5,B01DPPMPSG,"This is a superb documentary and well-deserving of its Oscar. I got it at the library.

The sociopathic killer walked free, among other reasons, because of Gil Garcetti's political decision to try the case downtown and not where it should have been tried, because of the soulless attorneys who represented the killer, and because of the ""reverse Darwinism"" that served to put a group of prejudiced and ignorant jurors in charge of the fate of a man who hadn't been black for 20+ years.

I believe that had Simpson never been a football player he would have still ended up exactly where he sits right now. Some reviewers have expressed compassion for him, which baffles me. The real American tragedy is that a man so undeserving of adulation lived a life of privilege because he could run with a ball and charm everyone in the room.",1499817600,,831,4.684931506849315

Instead of vilifying OJ Simpson this presentation avoids the usual knee-jerk reactions, presenting a more nuanced context.  I began to see OJ in a more compassionate way, although not excusing the destruction he wrought on his marriage and family.  It seems that underneath the male bravado, OJ may be a very insecure man. A ""man who had everything"" perhaps only had material externals, and was lacking some important inner elements.  I've often wondered if his sentencing for roberry in Las Vegas was ""overkill"", and this film also raises this issue.  I also began to see the viewpoint of African Americans, their distrust of American justice.  I can finally put this ordeal to rest in my mind.

7721472,5,B01DPPMPSG,"The People vs. O.J. Simpson was an excellent miniseries (it was consistently entertaining, and Sarah Paulsons performance is one of the greatest Ive ever seen on a TV show), but it did stumble at times with an overly sympathetic portrayal of O.J. Simpson (Cuba Gooding Jr. spoke in interviews about doing guilty and innocent takes of several scenes, which probably gave O.J. more good faith than he deserves). Ezra Edelmans documentary O.J.: Made in America, on the other hand, is less ambiguous and more objective. At nearly eight hours, its very thorough and comprehensivethough it never feels bloated or unnecessarily expansive.

At its heart, O.J.: Made in America is a study of many things, most notably race, gender, wealth, sports, media, and the power of celebrity. With the exception of district attorney Christopher Darden and O.J. Simpson himself (who declined participation), all the major figures during the trial are interviewed, along with people who crossed paths with O.J. in his earlier years. Archival footage is used for people who have passed (like Robert Kardashian, an eminently decent man and former friend of O.J.s who had a falling out with him during the trial, despite remaining one of his attorneys).

O.J.: Made in America is divided into five parts, and its not until several house in until we get to the murders. The early scenes cover O.J.s childhood, presenting him as a man who from a very young age knew how to manipulate his way out of trouble. This first part of the film may sound superfluous, but its anything but; in fact, it helps to contextualize who O.J. Simpson was at one point, and it helps the audience to understand how he became so beloved in the first place: the footage of him playing football for USC is electrifying, and the archival interview footage of him showcases a charming, handsome, charismatic, and all-around likable guy in ways that can be rather easy to forget in retrospect.

Edelmans film really shows the audience why O.J. was asked to be on so many commercials back in the day, and why he was wanted for cameos in movies and TV shows, something that people from a younger generation (like myself) may not have really understood. For all his personal demons, O.J. really was one of the greatest running backs in history, and the footage of him as his peak is spellbinding. Like Muhammad Ali, he redefined what an athlete could be as a cultural iconunlike Ali, though, he never really became politically or socially active with the issues that so many of his African-American contemporaries championed. In fact, O.J. went out of his way to make it in a while world, making Hertz commercials and Naked Gun movies and deliberately avoiding controversy (Colin Kaepernick, he was not).

O.J. was free to be as politically active or inactive as he desired, of course, but this point is all the more notable in the context his his eventual trial (and acquittal) for the murder of his ex-wife and her lover. For many white Americans, O.J. being found not guilty was a travesty, and Ill admit that Ive always found the outcome to be both baffling and maddening. After all, all the DNA evidence points towards him being the murder, the defense never presented anyone else as a possible suspect, and O.J. even wrote a book (If I Did It) outlining how he would have killed Ron and Nicole (you know, hypothetically). The film shows graphic crime scene photos (with Nicoles throat slit nearly to the point of decapitation), but it never feels gratuitous or exploitative; it just serves to remind that O.J. Simpson wasand isan absolute monster.

What Edelman does so masterfully in the film, though, is show how jurors could find him not guilty, without engaging in any dopey conspiracy theories or claiming that O.J. was innocent. Edelman contextualizes O.J.s trial in the aftermath of the beatings of Rodney King and the shooting of Latasha Harlins (a fifteen-year old African-American girl who was shot and killed by a store owner for stealing orange juice). Harlins wasn't stealing it, but the store owner shot and killed her anyway; that store owner was only given 400 hours of community service and a $500 fine, and an all-white jury found the officers who beat Rodney King not guilty. Many in the African-American community had a deep district of the LAPDand the film demonstrates why their distrust was thoroughly justifiable, even if it led to a serious miscarriage of justice for Ron and Nicoles families. It can be easy to dismiss the jury as a bunch of idiots, but the film seems to render most of the jurors more sympathetic than you might expectwhile still highlighting that O.J. clearly committed the murders.

Mark Fuhrmana former detective for the LAPD during the investigationhas been proven a racist time and time again. He famously lied during the trial about not using the N word (he eventually admitted to giving a false testimony, and hes lucky to have avoided a felony for perjury). The interview footage with him is often chilling, especially a section involving the LAPDs eventual adoption of a choke hold ban after several African-American suspects were literally killed by police officers using the practice.

One LAPD officer, Daryl Gates, is even quoted in the film as saying the deaths may have been caused by physiological differences in black people (the veins or arteries do not open up as fast as they do on normal people). This was a shockingly racist organization (and perhaps still is), and when hes asked in the film about the Rodney King beatings, Fuhrman simply says, This is what happens when you take away a tool that would have ended this in ten seconds: chokehold. Its a chilling and disturbing moment, and theres probably a very good case to be made that Fuhrman was as responsible for letting O.J. get away with murder as any of his attorneys were.

Edelmans film also brilliantly tackles an under-discussed point in this case: O.J.s misogyny and contempt for women, including calling Nicole a fat pig when she was pregnant, constantly cheating on her, beating her up, and manipulating her into getting back with him time and time again. Many of the jurors engaged in serious victim-blaming against Nicole (one is quoted as say that they lose respect for any woman who takes an ass-whopping when she don't have to), and there was an undeniably misogynistic element to how the prosecuting attorney, Marcia Clark, was treated (she was tough, assertive, and ambitiousall qualities we would praise in men, yet she was often dismissed as some sort of unbearable person for reasons that totally elude me).

Even for someone like myself who has been fascinated with this case for a long time, has watched The People vs. O.J. Simpson and has read Jeffrey Toobins excellent book The Run of His Life, there still were plenty of surprises to be had here. The eight hours race by and the film never feels like a slog, as the material is so rich and the ideas on display in the caserace, class, gender, celebrity, etc.seem just as relevant today as they were in 1995, perhaps even depressingly so.",1498780800,,7085,4.8681592039801

7721500,5,B01DPPMPSG,"Excellent story telling.  I really liked how it laid out the story with the history of how popular and revered O.J. was and how Los Angeles police, race relations, and the Rodney King beating all played a part leading up to the trial.  It also gives you really great insight into the thinking and strategy of both sides, the defense and prosecution.  And, as expected, shows how many forensic mistakes were made not only by crime scene investigators, but the police, too.  It also shows how the police let the media circus cloud their judgement; letting the slow speed Bronco chase run on and on, and letting so many spectators gather at both Rockingham and the Bundy crime scene.  I think everyone, from Judge Ito, the prosecution, defense, and police all got caught up in the Hollywood aspect of the trial, to the point where it impeded their ability to do their jobs correctly; that combined with Los Angeles race relations being what they were, made it difficult to choose a fair and impartial jury.  I always felt that O.J. was guilty, but I have a new found empathy for what his life became after the trial.  Of course, he brought this all on himself, but given how everyone treated him like a god, for him to fall so far from grace is truly sad.  You have two innocent people that were brutally murdered, careers were ruined, friendships broken, and a community was split apart.

One thing came to mind in watching this, which is: we still put athletes, actors, actresses on pedestals, we pay them more than they are worth and we tell them constantly how great they are.  This is a systematic failure in our society that awards all the wrong people with too much attention and a belief they can do no wrong.  No one is above the law or perfect, but until we recognize that we will continue to create  ordinary people who believe they are impenetrable.",1489622400,,1858,4.580060422960725

It shows that sometimes you don't get justice in the court system, but life somehow hands you that justice in a different way, at a different time. OJ, arguably one of the worst human beings to grace this earth got away with killing Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman, but somehow in a very strange turn of events he got what he deserved in Nevada. He got 33 years in prison. And he'll never be the ""Juice"" again. Do we get what we deserve in life....somehow, someway. Yes!!!!!!

I especially appreciated the history of race relations in LA and the relationship between the LAPD and the black community.  What bothered me during the trial and after the verdict has not changed, however.  OJ was and is an Oreo. There is nothing black about him.  So why did so many black Americans sympathize with him? Why celebrate his acquittal? Two people are dead. How is that appropriate? I believed in 1995 and still believe in 2017 that the jury were lazy, prejudiced, and incompetent.

7721514,4,B01DPPMPSG,"Great documentary.  Traces OJ Simpson from his upbringing in Oakland (an old friend says that to the guys in the poor neighborhood OJ grew up in, civil rights leaders were ""bougie"" and the men they admired most were the hustlers on the street), to football celebrity, and his trial(s) and eventual imprisonment.

OJ reached stardom in the late 60's, when African-American athletes were being sent home and stripped of medals for pumping a fist, and as blacks were being shot dead in the street by LAPD just outside the gated, all-white USC campus where he was making his name.  It was a strange time: the sediment, almost, of the Civil rights movement, when the establishment was looking to quell the upheaval of the era by pointing to post-racial, high-achieving ""stand-outs,"" as if to prove the race problem which has always been our problem was never one at all.  Cue Orenthal James Simpson.  Handsome, modest, a great football player and an even better interview, OJ picked up on the mood of the times and presented himself as beyond race.  It seems a patently dumb idea in 2017, but to a young man eager for fame and fortune in a ""post""-segregation America, it seemed worth a shot:  if he didn't bring too much attention to his skin color and made his best effort in front of these wealthy white people, all things would be open to him.

Except, the post-racial was not that at all.  As a model and admonition to other people of color who did not fare as well as he, the role was to be eternally amiable, smiling, winning:  ironically, to be pleasing to whites and non-blacks (African-Americans could come along too, of course, but were not the target audience).  A TV clip circa the late 1970's-80's shows OJ tapping in a tux with a young girl; it vaguely reminds you of a 30's film with Shirley Temple and the faithful black retainer.  The people who produced OJ's famous ""Go Juice, Go!"" commercials for Hertz proudly note his handsomeness stemmed from not having ""too black"" of features and that they never thought of him as black - but as ""successful."" Chew on that one a moment. Another from this same circle dismissively shrugs his shoulders when he recalls OJ had corporate boardroom ambitions.  (Like that was going to happen, right?) The athletic career ends in a minor movie career, as sidekicks, a security guard in a posh hotel (Towering Inferno), the butt of the joke (Naked Gun).

Interviews with friends indicate his creeping use of the ""N"" word to describe other African-Americans.  Friends warn him he is becoming lost, separate from himself. He begins courting wealthy white entrepreneur friends and drops his first, African-American wife, Marguerite. He meets Nicole, a young blonde Southern California waitress and would-be model.  We learn he sexually assaulted her on their first date, violence which we are led to infer did not happen with Marguerite.  It still explains absolutely nothing, but the wooing and abusing of Nicole seems to mirror the professional degradation which makes him wealthy on a daily basis.  These two people should not have been together.

OJ is granted the ""privilege"" of abusing his poor young wife by the LAPD because of his very status as corporate spokesman. A sad, sick indicator of how race and class privilege pollute everything.  Meanwhile, LA is a powder keg:  Rodney King, Latasha Harlins, the riots, the beating of Reginald Denny.  If you grew up in LA as I did in these times, you know the LAPD's reputation was in the basement. Particularly for brutality and for falsifying evidence.  When Nicole and Ron are found dead OJ reaches out to Johnnie Cochran, who senses that the Downtown minority communities who will make up OJ's jury are at their breaking point.  Nicole and Ron are buried again, as this racial psychodrama comes home to roost.

The short of the story is, once OJ is acquitted, the white elite remember his skin color (if they ever really forgot), and drop him.  OJ deals by acting like the criminal everyone thought he was, and loses the freedom, success, and most of the wealth that had motivated his life to start with.  (A video of Robert Kardashian Sr. shows him recalling he only ever saw OJ ""once or twice a year."") OJ was never convicted of murder, but gets a sentence for minor Nevada crimes nearly totaling that of one (or two).  And thus, OJ, once a poor black youth from Oakland, comes full circle and ends up in prison.

The evidence sure seems like OJ did it, but we'll never know for sure.  It will never justify these murders, but could his life have ended up much better in such a racist society? All you can really say is a few twists of fate would have saved Nicole and Ron.",1487548800,,4675,4.721674876847291

7721536,5,B01DPPMPSG,"This documentary won the Best Documentary at the 2017 Academy Awards. While we may grumble about who did and who did not receive the award, this documentary JUSTLY DESERVED Best Documentary of the year.

OJ Simpson story here is fresh, compelling, and gut-wrenching. This documentary allows, as all good documentaries do, the main characters and events tell the story, as opposed to having a background voice do the narration. The story is told through O.J.s friends, confidants, business partners, his partners in other crimes. It is told through the legal teams, prosecution and defense. Some members from that team were conspicuous through their absence. Chris Darden and Robert Shapiro, for instance, were not interviewed. Members of Nicoles and Goldmans family were interviewed. Members of the jury were interviewed. This allows the story to be told without filters. It also allows a fuller, more complete story to be told, from all perspectives.

The product is compelling. As a result we understand how the jury arrived at its surprising verdict, and, of course, feel even more badly for the family members of the victims. But dare I say it, ... nay, this documentary accomplishes the near-impossible: One almost feels sorry for the main character himself  O.J. Simpson.

Th documentary is almost seven and a half hours. Yes, thats seven hours. No matter, you will be glued to the screen. If you were around at the time it will feel like you entered a time tunnel. If you weren't it will give you a real good idea of how it was like to live through that ordeal.

Its been twenty-three years now that OJ Simpson was acquitted on murder charges. For those who were around and aware of the daily drama of the trial, this documentary will bring all those feelings, whatever they were, to the surface again, like a dragon whose sleep was disturbed. For those who were either not around or too young to remember the psycho-drama, this documentary will give you perhaps the most balanced presentation of the trial, viewed against the tense racial atmosphere of Los Angeles, both contemporary to the trial, and the sea of resentment which had built up prior to the trial.

From any perspective OJ Simpson and his murder trial was perhaps one of the most polarizing topics of the day. Everyone  and I mean Everyone   had an opinion as to his guilt or innocence. That opinion was sometimes, but not always, based on a pre-existing racial experience of the person who held that opinion. Local public opinion was certainly informed by the recent spate of scandals involving the LA police with its minorities, Rodney King being the most prominent. And this is how this documentary so meticulously provides the background to covering the trial. This documentary is not only an excellent account of the OJ Simpson trial, but an expert history of race relations in Los Angeles.

Ultimately, this documentary is a testament of personal failure and fall from grace  in gargantuan proportions. Certainly, it is an account of the rise and fall of OJ Simpson, the person, Heisman trophy winner now prison inmate. It is an abject lesson in how NOT to conduct a trial. Every law student knows, what the DA Chris Darden did not, or cared not to know, that you NEVER ask a question unless you know what the answer or outcome will be. It is an up-close look at the brutal loss of the victims parents and siblings, who will, as they do now, live with the loss of Nicole Simpson and Ronald Goldman forever. It is a story of the tarnished or failed careers of just about any witness from the LA prosecutors office who testified at the trial, and whose testimony and/or reputations were ripped to shreds by the defenses cross examination. No one walked away unscathed. Even individual members of OJs defense team refused to talk with each other after the trial. One would be hard-pressed to find any winners at all in this tragedy, save, of course for OJs defense lawyers, who, it was indicated, charged $50,000.00 per day to defend their client.

7721543,5,B01DPPMPSG,"This is a superb documentary.  It consists of five episodes, each approximately 90 minutes long, in other words, the length of a feature film.  While it is riveting in its script and production values, it takes its time in order to tell the complete story.  Thus, we do not begin on Bundy in a sea of blood.  We begin in the projects of San Francisco and move slowly through OJs career at USC, in Buffalo, with Hertz, etc.  The thematic backdrop is, broadly, race in America but OJ does not fit into this overarching narrative neatly.

Thus, e.g., we get an account of the Rodney King events as a backdrop/foreshadowing of OJs trial, but while OJs defense team dealt the race card from the bottom of the deck (in Shapiros words), OJ did not see himself as, principally, African-American.  He saw himself as different and separate.  In fact, he seems to have thought of himself more as a phenomenon than as an individualthe OJ phenomenon.  Thus, when Lance Ito brought the jury to Rockingham to see the scene, the black members of OJs defense team were quick to re-dress the set, removing the pictures of OJ among many white people and substituting pictures of OJ with black people, adding African art works, etc.  They shoehorned him into a black narrative to appeal to the black members of the jury and the fit was an uneasy one, for OJ himself.

These themes are fascinating, since they include a history of race relations in Los Angeles, on the one hand, and an extremely prominent black individual whose experience did not fit the standard template.  In effect, the documentary creates a large tapestry or puzzle of Los Angeles, with a missing pieceOJthat doesnt quite fit.

I was particularly impressed that the documentary does not obsess over the first criminal trial (particularly when we all know its details already).  Instead it gives us previously-unnoticed or unknown details (Marcia Clark cursing a newsman outside her house to such an extreme degree that we see the tempests roiling inside her).  It also provides an extended and detailed account of OJs arrest in Las Vegas.  This episode is less well-known than the criminal trial for murder and we get to meet all of the players who were involved in securing/stealing OJs property/memorabilia, with fulsome closed-circuit tv footage of OJ and his people walking through the hallways en route to the confrontation and aftermath.

There is an old saying among mystery writers and criminologists that you may receive any number of things at a trial, but justice is not necessarily one of them.  Hence the interest in the OJ verdict, which divided America.  Hence the civil trial which was more or less open and shut (though it was clear from the get-go that the Goldmans were highly unlikely to ever see any of the 33mil in damages).  And then--the third actin which OJ gets 33 years for a brief and stupid action that pales in importance to the deaths of Nicole and Ron.  White justice, one black commentator opines, thus linking the actions in Las Vegas to the larger race-in-America theme.

While I enjoyed the John Travolta et al. dramatization of the OJ trial, this is a must-see for the larger context.  Its most telling point, perhaps, is OJs split personality.  He is capable of rage and violence, vulgarity and extreme self-indulgence.  At the same time he is enormously charming and outgoing, happily signing autographs and shaking hands, attracting both men and women to an uncommon degree.  The documentarys interpretation is that OJ was addicted to fame and comfortable with it.  When the adulation left, however, the dark side came to the fore.  Im not certain that this is the whole story, but the five episodes here provide enough grist for the curious viewer to judge for him- or herself.

Highly recommended.",1479427200,2,3790,4.841614906832298

7721549,4,B01DPPMPSG,"OJ: Made in America captures the essence of the OJ drama.  The media circus, OJ's egotism and fall from grace, LAPD's and prosecution's incompetence, the twisted race relations in American society.

That said, it's hardly a fair and balanced presentation.  90% of interviews are from people who believe OJ is guilty, and their opinions drive the narrative.  Little detail was shown of Barry Scheck's work pointing out the evidence collection process allowed contamination.  But plenty was shown of Marcia Clark and her team's opinion that this was dirty lawyer gimmick.  None of the sordid details of Nicole's circle of friends ever came up. Johnny Cochran's drug dealer theory was not allowed to make its own case.  It's only relayed through Marcia Clark's flat denial of it.  No question was ever raised about facts that are hard to reconcile: how could a small cut in OJ's finger produce so much blood evidence in 3 difference places?  How could OJ be capable of cleaning up so much blood in less than half an hour and yet dumb enough to drop gloves in 2 different places?

I don't have an opinion on OJ.  I don't think anybody outside of OJ himself knows if he's guilty or not.  But entertaining as it is, this is not a documentary for those interested in facts of the case.",1477785600,,1278,4.707207207207207

7721570,5,B01DPPMPSG,SUPER EXCELLENT,1473033600,,15,7.0
7721571,5,B01DPPMPSG,"The murders and trial are central here of course, but time and focus is also given Simpson's pre murder-case history as one of our greatest
athletes, his personal attitudes about race and his own role in society, his adolescence, the racial tensions that seethed in the country at the time of the trial, and then goes on to examine his years after the trial, including Simpson's arrest and conviction for armed robbery in Las Vegas.

What emerges is a sad, chilling and complex portrait of a deeply disturbed if once brilliantly talented and charismatic human being, one
who seemed to have mislaid his sense of inner self and identity paradoxically allowing a whole nation read into him whatever they wanted to see.

At the same time, the film is a scathing indictment of a society for years willing to overlook O.J.'s violence towards women, and - simultaneously - the L.A.P.D.'s violence towards African-Americans -- leading to a trial featuring was a face off of the most extreme and
dysfunctional of anti-heroes on both sides.

The documentary presents a very different O.J. than the one in FX's docudrama ""American Crime"". That fictionalized O.J. seemed hapless, and weirdly unaware of himself or how he comes off. This O.J. comes off as more of a very smart sociopath, aggressively helping direct his own defense, and brilliantly manipulating those in his life -- lying with confidence and ease. There's also a sense of the epic Shakespearian
tragic irony of the man's story; his journey from brilliance to hubris and violence, to escaping punishment, only to be brought down while
attempting to steal back things that were once his.

It's a powerful look at both a man and his society, and it addresses the complexity of the racial issues around a man who never saw himself
as black, but who became a symbol for millions of people so long denied justice that they hitched their wagon to a very questionable hero. It
also makes a little clearer just how badly the police and prosecution messed up the handling of the case, making it a bit easier perhaps for
the white audience to understand that finding O.J. innocent wasn't simply a case of willful blindness, but of punishing a system that was for years shockingly, deeply dysfunctional. And that, wildly unjust though the verdict may have been (polls show even most African Americans now believe O.J. was guilty), there are arguably worse things than one man getting away with murder. Like centuries of a whole society accepting a murderous attitude by law enforcement and the justice system towards a race of people.

The film does have flaws: certain ideas, thematic elements and even specific stories are repeated needlessly, bogging the narrative down at
points, while other elements that one would seem crucial (e.g. : O.J.'s early childhood and how it helped shape him) get less attention and
focus than they would seem to deserve.

But whatever it's minor shortcomings, this is an important and epic look at both a man who was is/was both a dangerous human being and a
symbol, how America looks at race, fame, wealth, the justice system, and how one person could both hold and represent the grace of the gods and the violence and destructive anger of his own devils.",1473033600,4,3232,4.877959927140255

7721573,5,B01DPPMPSG,"This is an in-depth look at the life trajectory of O.J. Simpson.  The viewer will get a better sense of how O.J. got from being just another young black child without a father figure around to a criminal.  It's the in-between that is miraculous ride.  You will see how that spark of being different evolved to a world-class athlete, a rich young man who believed he was colorless, a groundbreaking advertising pitchman, a movie star, an accused murderer, and, finally, a convicted felon.  After the early ""charmed life"" years at USC it seemed O.J. had bumps in the road at every turn initially landing professionally in the NFL wasteland of Buffalo, New York.  There would be some serendipitous turns keeping O.J. from ever hitting rock bottom when, after two years, his professional career exploded with the famed 2000-yard record breaking season.  Teflon Simpson had once more been elevated to a charmed life.  Older and, in his own bubble, wiser he must have believed he'd found the key to being invincible.  Only thing is a narcissist can't escape himself and the seeds for destruction were in the mix.  This is shown fairly early on and the series takes it's time to properly flesh out behaviors/decisions that set up a quite horrific later life.  I'd say the series doesn't pander and gets to the meat of who O.J. really was.  It isn't pretty.  In fact it's far uglier than the friendly smile of the O.J. we saw much of on our TV screens.  How he managed to go so long being such a flawed human being is a big question as he belief of entitlement blows away any overblown egotistical male you've likely ever read about...or could even conceive of.  Of course it culminates in the most outrageous criminal trial in history.  The path is well documented, the trial itself is revealed in the best concise recap I've seen, and the final chapter in Las Vegas is explained in a way it makes more sense, but is still dumbfounding in it's stupidity.

7721600,5,B01DPPMPSG,"I watched this over the weekend and was completely in awe of the fabulous job that was done on it. The intricacies of it reminded me very much of the excellent documentaries Spike Lee made about Hurricane Katrina. I am not so much of a sports fan as I am of true crime and Civil Rights Movement history,  and this overwhelmingly filled the bill regarding both. Although there was much that I did recall about O.J. Simpson from my childhood, it wasn't from him being a football legend since I was too young to remember and I had no interest in that; it was from his endorsements, TV appearances, movies and as a sportscaster.  I'll admit I was not aware of everything and I had some ""whoa"" moments while viewing it. While it does have some holes in it due to key people not being interviewed (either because they declined to participate, were not asked, or because they've since passed on) and the omission of Simpson's other minor brushes with the law,  it is still pretty thorough.

Unlike the recent FX TV dramatization ""The People v. O.J. Simpson"", which only focused on the murder trial and the main players in that entire media circus,  this documentary is far more extensive. It covers his childhood in the Potrero Hill projects in San Francisco to his eventual conviction and imprisonment in Nevada in 2008 for armed robbery and kidnapping for the theft of sports memorabilia that he claimed was actually stolen from him, although it is not always chronologically in order.  In his heyday though, Orenthal James Simpson, famously nicknamed ""The Juice"",  was an exceptional, history-making athlete whose prowess on the field was unmatched by very few from his era and his charm, eloquence and good looks endeared him to many. He was regarded as a hero by adults and a role model for the youth, black youths in particular, at the height of his career.

However, as the layers are peeled back about this man, we see how ironic it is that a fame-obsessed and egocentric O.J. became a symbol of racial injustice for so many people. It's odd, because for decades, he disassociated himself from any and all things black -- from the people he socialized with to the neighborhood he moved to -- because he never viewed himself as a black man, and apparently a large majority of his white associates didn't, either. (What really irritated me is one of the people interviewed said he was ""a good looking African American...he had white (physical) features"". Seriously? What kind of ignorant statement is that?)  It seems that he unquestionably felt that his celebrity erased his race, and that was true to some extent. As long as he pandered to white America, didn't involve himself in anything controversial, like speaking out on the Vietnam War or civil rights, and behaved like the ""good Negro"", he wasn't viewed as a threat and therefore very appealing to whites. He had no interest in fighting on the front lines for other people of color who were discriminated against or victimized.  As long as it didn't affect him, he couldn't have cared less.

Of course, a lot of people's view of Simpson  forever changed after the murders of his ex-wife Nicole and her friend Ron Goldman in 1994 and his subsequent acquittal in October 1995. The civil suit the Brown and Goldman families filed against him is mentioned, and what I found to be disturbing in the judgment against him was the seizure of his elderly mother's home and her piano, both of which O.J. purchased for her...really? That, I felt, was unfair to her. She had nothing to do with what her son did.  Even the Browns admitted that the seizure of nearly everything O.J. ever owned was excessive, and would not bring Nicole and Ron back. It, to me, borders on avarice.

Everything mentioned in the background was relevant to Simpson's story (i.e. history of the LAPD in the 20th century, Muhammad Ali's resistance to the draft, Olympic boycotts in 1968 and several incidents that sparked racial unrest in California over the years, including the Watts and Los Angeles riots), and I was particularly intrigued seeing a young Johnnie Cochran in action prior to his years of defending celebrities in court. ""O.J.: Made In America"" not only successfully delivers the story of the meteoric rise and tragic fall of a celebrity sports icon, but more importantly,  it is also an excellent profile of race relations in America. It probably came out too late in the year to be considered for an Emmy win for an Outstanding Long Form Documentary, but I'm sure it will be considered for an award in 2017. You won't watch it with any sense of mirth, knowing what the eventual outcome is...just with the realization of how much of a shame it all is.",1471219200,4,4691,4.738650306748466

7721602,3,B01DPPMPSG,"This is an absolutely terrific documentary, and the boxed-set packaging is of high quality.  My three stars, however, factor in the disc issues I encountered.  In this five-disc set, disc #3 was defective and would not play on any of our machines (relatively new Blu-Ray players), and disc #4 was a mislabeled repeat copy of disc #1.  I have submitted the set to Amazon for an exchange, and will update this review based on the replacement set's performance.  Again, this is a very well done documentary that people should see; it not only gives insight into Simpson, his murder of his wife, but provides a first-hand overview of the criminal justice system and of U.S. race relations.",1470960000,2,685,4.829059829059829
7721603,5,B01DPPMPSG,"I lived through this, but I'd forgotten or perhaps never really seen the context that created OJ. I watched every minute of the trial, like everyone else did, but since I'm not a football fan, I only knew OJ as a super-celeb from my youth, and seeing him in the context of both the times and his life was amazingly illuminating. I will certainly watch this again. It seems crazy to say, but this doco on OJ is perhaps one of the best-made documentaries I've ever seen. Ezra Edelman should be incredibly proud and garner another Emmy for this one.",1470700800,6,546,4.47

7721612,5,B01DPPMPSG,"I've heard this called the greatest documentary series ever shown on TV and while that seems like hyperbole, I have a really hard time coming up with another example that truly lays its subject bare and delivers in so many ways as OJ: Made in America.

I was in college when the OJ trial was taking place, so I remember quite a bit of the details presented here (and even found myself swept away a little by 90s nostalgia) but this documentary mini-series goes so much deeper than what was presented to the public at the time and offers the type of perspective that one can only get 20 years removed from the actual events.  Although not every key player was available to be interviewed, the ones that were provide some deep insight and shocking insider info about not only OJ and what makes him tick, but an unflinching look at race relations in our country from the 1960s up to the present.

Keep in mind that this is a 5-part series and, at 7 hours 44 minutes of total running time, is definitely a commitment.  With that said, I was astonished to find that it held my attention for the duration and I never wanted to fast-forward through a second of it.  Every minute of its runtime is justified and actually leaves you wanting more when it comes to an end.  Another surprising thing is that each part really stood on its own and no part of the 5-part series felt inferior to another.

Other reviewers have done a good job of giving a synopsis of the events and storyline and you're probably quite familiar with most of them anyways, so I won't spend time on that here.  I also won't spoil a lot of the damning information that was presented, other than this interesting tidbit of info from his Mike Gilbert, his former agent and friend:  Besides the obvious stagecraft of the whole ""trying on the gloves"" spectacle, one reason that they didn't fit is that OJ's friends and advisors told him to lay off his arthritis meds for the 2 weeks prior, causing his fingers and hands to stiffen and swell.  I mention that not to convince you that OJ is guilty (although I don't see how you could walk away from this documentary with a shred of doubt in your mind that he did it), but to give an idea of some of the details that come out in this piece that were not available to the public 20 years ago.  There are many, many more where that came from.

Still, this never comes off as a character assassination and there is a high level of objectivity and journalistic integrity throughout.  Lawyers from both sides give their accounts, OJs friends, both current and former, supporters and haters and the whole gamut of parties involved are given a voice.

Simply put, whether you lived through this time or are unaware of O.J.'s story, this is a must-see document of a pivotal time in our country and a no-holds-barred look at the perhaps the highest profile criminal trial of all time.  Every angle is explored and it will stay with you for quite some time.",1469145600,2,2953,4.472998137802607
7721613,5,B01DPPMPSG,"The ESPN documentary miniseries OJ: MADE IN AMERICA was as great a TV documentary as THE CIVIL WAR and WATERGATE and as great a mega-long documentary film as THE SORROW AND THE PITY or SHOAH.  An absolute masterpiece, just as the recent FX dramatized miniseries THE PEOPLE VS OJ SIMPSON was a docudrama masterpiece.  This documentary reveals the story, and the fascinating, gifted, but morally blank man at its center in all of its surprising complexity.  This whole case is truly one of the most important stories in modern American history.  A documentary to be bought, watched, and rematched again and again.",1468281600,,611,4.96078431372549
7721614,5,B01DPPMPSG,I've read a lot about OJSimpson and his life and this documentary added some things I didn't know about the two trials and his life. Very interesting and well done. It attempts to answer the question of why.... but it just seems fully unanswerable.,1468281600,4,248,4.659090909090909
7721615,5,B01DPPMPSG,"Very well done. Recalls the senselessness of horrendous murders by a truly beloved athlete.  It's like a gut puch. This is a review for episode 1, which focuses on Simpson's rise, him as an ndividual as well as putting his enormous success in the larger context of American society at the time. Episode ends with his meeting Nicole Brown. I'll be purchasing the dvd for the rest.",1468108800,4,379,4.656716417910448

7721619,5,B01DPPMPSG,1st of all I sure hope that some of the money generated from the sale of this DVD set goes to the Brown and Goldman family's !! Now having said that let me say that this is an excellent documentary that covers all areas of this 'Killers Life' and it's never been more abundantly clear that while he was ' Declared Not Guilty' by a jury that 'Took care of one of there own ' it's never been proven that he didn't commit these murders. The Killers attorneys did a brilliant job of 'Hijacking' the trial ' and capitalizing on the Prosecution's mistakes and turning this into a trial about race instead of about the two murders this Killer committed!  A complete and total miscarriage of justice.,1467504000,4,692,4.448818897637795
7721620,3,B01DPPMPSG,"It's a great docu-series about race and the trial; however, utilizing that lense doesn't fully paint the full picture of why Simpson was acquitted.

Also reveals the OJ mindset from his youth in San Francisco as well as at UCLA. Can understand that he was going wrong for a long time. Out of sorts with who he is or should and playing a role that he could not maintain. Still playing that role, so it appears. Obviously has a lot of anger.",1526256000,,426,4.405063291139241
