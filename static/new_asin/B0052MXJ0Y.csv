8454038,1,B0052MXJ0Y,The Paramount logo does NOT belong in the opening sequence. They should remove the Paramount logo in the opening sequence. Because in TV shows the production company's logo go in the closing credits not in the opening sequence. And I can wait to write and produce new episodes of Corduroy The Bear at Nelvana.,1480809600,,309,4.7407407407407405
8454039,3,B0052MXJ0Y,"Entertainment for my grandson.  Some stories are almost the same as other DVR.  Quality is not so good. Picture is not so sharp.  But for a three year old, it is still entwining.",1465084800,,178,4.333333333333333
8454040,5,B0052MXJ0Y,"This is a really great series for children aged 4-5.  But all these episodes are on the DVD set  ""Busy World of Richard Scarry - Fun in Busytown"".  At a similar price, the latter is the obvious choice (35 episodes including these 10)!",1425772800,,234,4.395348837209302

8454042,2,B0052MXJ0Y,"I like Richard Scarry, and the episodes I viewed so far were good.
I will see if I can delete the ads at the beginning - they don't fit Busytown.",1364342400,,145,3.8666666666666667
8454043,5,B0052MXJ0Y,"Love, love, love Richard Scarry and his sweet drawings/animation?  This was a huge hit with my sons, and their older sibs watched, too.  Gotta love it.",1361577600,,151,4.769230769230769
8454044,5,B0052MXJ0Y,"I was familiar with Richard Scarry stories from my own childhood.  They are classic.  I thought my youngest children would love them, but I find even the older ones will watch, too.  The episodes are clever and give practical life lessons.  The characters are fun and the cartoons creative.  The DVD is loaded with many episodes.  Great value at a price too good to pass up.  However, If your kids are hooked on Cartoon Network, they might not appreciate this DVD.  It is wholesome and much slower pace than the modern, wacked-out cartoons.",1358553600,2,540,4.731182795698925
8454045,5,B0052MXJ0Y,"My daughter who is 36 grew up  on Mr Scarry and now my granddaughter is too.  Of all the DVD's and books, this one is # 1",1358035200,,121,3.4444444444444446
8454046,5,B0052MXJ0Y,"This video is eduactional and wholesome. I don't have to worry about what my young children are being exposed to when they watch this. The video has many episodes on it, so you are really getting your money's worth!",1356566400,,215,4.538461538461538
