1631556,4,B00005NBR2,"This DVD collection of the band's videos is not all that could be hoped for, but certainly not awful either.  The quality of the presentations are first rate.  The sound is wonderful and the visuals are crisp and clear.  The audio commentaries are brief, but mostly interesting.  The ""making of"" short videos were disappointing to me as they didn't really show too much about the concepts and the production, but more-so just a few behind the scenes type moments.  Overall, however, if you are a DMB fan this is a good, solid addition to your collection.  It is a good way to whet your appetite for this October's release of the December 19th, 1998 show from Chicago.",998438400,2,667,4.6581196581196584
1631557,5,B00005NBR2,"Who are we kidding?  Dave Matthews Band has an infinite number of fans, just look as his ticket sales, especially for last year's summer tour.  MTV and VH1 have become networks that no longer show videos like in the past but rather have programming that sometimes doesn't even concern music.  When the videos are played it is a shortened version and only of the most popular song (i.e. The Space Between, I Did It).  This DVD is an excellent opportunity for us fans to view the band when we want to, see the videos we may have only seen once or twice and if you want a concert, buy Listener Supported on DVD.  As for the money, look at all of the charitable causes that the band contributes to and works for, hello the Farm Aid concert...Next time do your research before you put down DMB, the DVD is a great resource for fans everywhere to see Dave when they feel like it, and not for a bad price either.",998265600,6,905,4.3
1631558,5,B00005NBR2,"Finally we can see all twelve videos without any commercials. On MTV I saw the ""DMB Collection"" or something like that. It Only showed like 5 or 6 videos. If you look at the DMB website, they have videos for songs like ""What Would You Say"" and ""Satellite"". They aren't ever played on MTV or VH1. I think this is going to be a great video and Im gonna buy it.",998179200,,358,4.056338028169014
1631559,5,B00005NBR2,"Dave Matthews Band has always been a band of the people.  The only reason they made this compillation is so we can have it- us fans really want this; it's another piece of Dave!  These videos are rarely played on VH1 or MTV, or MTV2, MTVX or VH1 Classic.  (except the space between)  Why complain about this?  If you think it's stupid or are convinced the videos are in heavy rotation, don't buy it.  But I know I will buy it as soon as it's released.",997833600,,451,4.186046511627907
1631560,5,B00005NBR2,"It's about time the band has made such a video collection; I have been waiting for this DVD a couple years now. I think DVDs of our favorite bands are better than a greatest hits CD, because it offers all of us the opportunity to hear the same great music we are used to getting, along with some of the most creative videos on TV today. The essence of each video lies within of the great music created by the Dave Matthews Band; each video tells its own story, which has an artistic style unmatched by any other band around today. I say the DVD is a must have for any fan.",997574400,8,572,4.116071428571429
1631561,3,B00005NBR2,"3 stars- just bring down the average. First, no one you has seen this yet. Second, do you realize how much video one can cram onto a dvd- Dave could give us the 12 videos, the short films, and a concert or two. Third, is there really a demand for this? I think everyone would rather a live show than some videos I could see on VH1 tonight. This happened on the Tool -Salival DVD- Sure, the Tool videos are the best around, but that (and this) dvd could be put together in an afternoon. Don't waste my money, Dave!",997228800,6,513,4.14

1631579,5,B00005NBR2,Great DVD of all the videos from Dave Matthews Band up to 2001.  Great 'making of the videos' shorts & extra features - including subtitles to all the songs.  In case you want to figure out what Dave is singing in Ants.,1168300800,,219,4.190476190476191

1631581,4,B00005NBR2,"Excelent compilation of the DMB's hits. This is a must for DMB's fans. And if you are not, it is great opportunity to listen to one of the best pop music bands out there.

I particularly enjoy this DVD because many of the songs that are prior to the Everyday album were not recorded in good quality, so it was hard to find decent studio versions (Apart from the fact that this band sounds much better live). Besides, the videos are amazing, so full of creativity, with unsual camera angles, some are so surreal. The quality is great, clear and clean video and great Dolby 5.1 sound. Furthermore, they added subtitled lyrics, so one can sing along.

The only con is that the extra features are not so good, I expected more interviews with the band members, instead it is just a bunch of clips from the video making. I got the Under THe Table and Drumming DVD, and there one can understand what was on Carter's mind when jamming with the rest group members, he explains the approach he used for each track. It is excelent. I would be great that BMG sell a DVD with a jamming session. These guys are so good musicians and there is so much chemistry between them that it must be delight watching them in during the creative process of making their music.",1135382400,,1250,4.430434782608696
1631582,5,B00005NBR2,"Love this DVD. It has his most well-known video's and it has the suprise of having ""The Space Between"" on it. I was quite thrilled with it and hope they do another one soon. Would also love to see the VH1 storytellers with Tim Reynolds. Dave really tells some funny stories. Please release that! But for now, I will stay satisfied with this DVD.",1111708800,6,345,4.40625
1631583,5,B00005NBR2,"Me myself, I'm not a fan of the music video.  I think it is a terrible way to promote an album.  This DVD has all of their videos in excellent quality and behind the scenes footage and much more.  I enjoyed this, although I thought it would be a terrible buy.",1053648000,6,259,4.03921568627451

1631596,5,B00005NBR2,"Well what can I say about this DVD that hasn't already been said. How about this. I have read three books on the band, own all of their CDs, travelled countless kilometers to see them live and read about them on the net all the time. The fact is I still learned some new stuff about the band during this DVD. The director commentaries are just perfect. The are informative, funand fact-filled. There are some really interesting perspectives on the band as a whole and their approach to shooting a video. The directors are really interesting people as well and it is funny to watch them relate to the wacky antics of Dave. (i.e. &#8220;So I just kept saying things to him like, &#8216;Pretend there are birds flying at your head, the floor is made of Jell-O!' Hilarious!) The fact you can se the lyrics on the screen with the video is wonderful for my roommate (who has a tendency to sing along really loud with the wrong lyrics)! The lyrics are superimposed in a way that really doesn't detract from the colour or feel of the video. I hate to admit it but it is kind of a cool feature despite the fact my initial reaction was, &#8220;Who would need lyrics to Dave songs?&#8221; The behind the scenes extras are kind of cool, one of them is rather weak. I won't say which one in case you feel differently, but you could really tell it was shot before DVDs really carried features like it! I (like many Dave fans) am not too thrilled by the song I Did It, but the video and making of feature are really enjoyable to watch. All in all a good buy! However, I will have to rate it as a 4.9999999999999997 because my girlfriend found a typo in the lyrics within the first 20 minutes. However, we played it for almost three hours the first night we had it and we will be watching it over and over and over no doubt. So if you are a fan of movies, videos and the Dave Matthews Band check it out! It has a little bit of all of these in it along with a lot of fun mixed in!",1039046400,6,1963,4.237333333333333
1631597,5,B00005NBR2,"I have the DMB CDs, but not having cable, I decided to see what their music videos are like.  What a great purchase.
There's not much to say about the videos themselves other than they are well done.  The cool thing is what they've added to the DVD.  For instance:
- Press ""Subtitle"" on your remote and you get the lyrics on the bottom of the sceen as the video plays.  Nice touch.
- Commentaries... once you get curious or want a change of pace, you can get the video with the makers talking over the top.  Kind of interesting, but I only want to go through it once... the music is better than the talking!
- Special features ... They go into detail of how they made a couple of the videos.  The ""I Did It"" feature is the most interesting.
One thing I didn't realize when I bought the DVD, turning off the TV and letting it play through the stereo system is, in effect, playing a DMB ""greatest hits"" album.  That's nice too.
One more thing, if you are an DMB fan, this is worth the money.  However, I met someone yesterday who had never heard of Dave Matthews Band.  Don't ask ME how that happened.  Anyway, she saw some of the disc with me and is now a fan too.  So, for fans and soon-to-be-fans, this is definitely a good buy.",1038528000,7,1229,4.187234042553191
1631598,5,B00005NBR2,"In a way, this is DMB's greatest hits.  All of these songs were hits, and putting the videos togehter was Dave's way of releasing these ""greatest hits.""  The result is great, because these videos are truly amazing.  From the visual wonder of ""Crash Into Me"" to the fun, summer-y feel of ""Stay"" to the live clips in ""Tripping Billies"" and the cool effects in ""I Did it,"" this DVd delivers on all levels.  All 12 videos have director commentary, and there are behind the scenes fueatures on ""Don't Drink the Water,"" ""Stay"" and ""I Did It.""  This DVD is worht buying.  The songs are great, and the quality is very good, with optional lyrics at the bottom.
What Would You Say- (10 of 10)- A very cool debut video.  It features the now famous firedancer.  It's a good song and the video is funky, just like the song.  It is very good.
Ants Marching (10 of 10)- This video is the worst video on here.  It is simply boring, but the song is great, and this is the first ever Dave video I saw, so I love it.
Satellite- (10 of 10)- This is a great song with an interesting video that makes me want to go and blow bubbles.  It's a cool video.
Too Much (10 of 10)- This is a very cool video, too.  It is just plain funky.  The song is great, too.
So Much to Say- (10 of 10)- This video is cool to watch.  There is a very cool scene with two Dave's!  What could be better than two Dave's!
Crash Into Me (11 of 10)- By far their best video.  It is so clever, and I love the shot of Stefan with the bass with his hand reaching out.  The colors, the lyrics, the music, everything about this video is great.
Tripping Billies (10 of 10)- This video is very cool.  It shows the listener what is great about their live shows.  The song is packed with power, and by the end of the video, you feel like you just watched a live show.  Very cool.
Don't Drink the Water (10 of 10)- This is a very cool vidoe, as well.  I love Dave's head, and Boyd in dressed in the violins.  The only problem is that ths song was cut short by several minutes.  This song is so good, and I wish it was the whole thing that got released.
Stay (11 of 10)- Another of my favorite videos.  It is such a fun video.  From the barber to the dancing chick with the big head, to the band playing in white tuxedos, it is just a great video and a great song.
Crush (10 of 10)- Like ""Don't Drink the Water"" this song, too was cut short when it was released.  It is still a great song, and the video is very cool.  It captures the mood of the song very well, with the black and white, and I love the part with the tiled floor.  Cool video.
I Did it (10 of 10)- Cool video, not so cool song.  This song is weak, but the video has cool effects and some fuky scenes.  It is a cool video.  Don't get me wrong, the song isn't bad, it's just not their best.
The Space Between (10 of 10)- Pretty cool video.  I like the rain int he end, especially on the drum.  It is pretty cool, and I love the song.  Along with ""Everyday"" and ""When the World Ends"" its the strongest song off of ""Everyday.""
The only thing I don't like about this DVD is that it doesn't add videos as Dav'e career progresses.  I miss not having ""Everyday"" and ""Where are you Going.""  Someday, they'll hopefully release another one.  This DVD is well worth the money, and is fun to watch over and over.",1038441600,11,3306,4.077639751552795
1631599,5,B00005NBR2,"I was a little nervous about this DVD at first, but it is worth the purchase.  The videos bring out the spirit of the songs and the optional lyrics on-screen are nice as well.  It helps you to contemplate the poetry and meaning of the lyrics.  The director commentaries are nice as well and it gives some behind the scenes info on the band as well.  I would recommend this DVD to any Dave fan.",1030579200,,393,4.2
1631600,5,B00005NBR2,"I've never seen any DMB video before.  I first saw Dave Matthews as a guest on a Rolling Stones live DVD.  I was caught by his bizarre way of singing, but quickly I realized he was a good musician (not only a good singer) because of the way he improvisated.  When I heard The Space Between on the radio (I first tought it was Phil Collins, sorry...) and learned it was DM who sang it, I decided to buy some of DMB material.  I was amazed of how much albums he had.  I bought the Videos DVD and immediately fell in love of his coolness and style.
This DVD has one of the sharpest images I've ever seen and audio quality is great.  I don't own a sofisticated Home Theater system, but the surround channels sound very clear and you get an almost 3-dimensional sound, just like if you were on the middle of stage.
DMB style is fresh and creative.  I'm not sure, but I think his musicians must came from New Orleans or something.  I can hardly catalog their music as ""Pop"" becasue they have so much Jazz influences and a great non-commercial songwriting.  I can watch it (or just listen to it) a thousand times and still fin new stuff on each song.
If you know DMB you probably own this DVD already, but if you don't know them, this is probably the best way to know them.  Don't hesitate to buy this DVD first, for it has the best songs from all his albums.",1026864000,7,1352,4.205426356589148
1631601,5,B00005NBR2,"I was in search of the video ""Crush"" and finally located it on this DVD.  Little did I know how good the whole DVD is.  Serendipity!!  The music speaks for itself but the videos are quite entertaining.  We play this DVD in our house to relax to.  Even my 8-year-old son knows all the videos now and enjoys watching the DVD with us.
I like to come home from work, get a beer and crank up this DVD/stereo.  It's quite an attitude adjuster.",1021593600,,437,4.204819277108434
1631602,5,B00005NBR2,"This is a GREAT DVD! It has all the videos from DMB up until ""The Space Between."" This is a must for any DMB fan because the videos are rarely played on music video channels. Plus the DVD has special features like commentary for every video and behind the scenes for a couple. The sound quality is superb. This is a GREAT DVD and I give it five stars.",1018569600,5,351,4.101449275362318
1631603,5,B00005NBR2,"I bought this video for my wife for Christmas and she loves it. We both love the Dave Matthews Band and have all of their CD's but this is great to watch the video's that we have not seen for the longest time.  The making of the videos is nice to watch although it does not have one for every video. The 5.1 sounds great on the home theater system, but if you do not have 5.1 capabilities the stereo sounds great too. You can also turn the lyrics on or off while watching the video's. Overall a great video!",1008720000,3,507,4.07
1631604,5,B00005NBR2,"If you're a fan of Dave Matthews Band, you will absolutely love this DVD.  There are a couple of videos that solely in-concert, but the other ones...well, they're different.  They're incredible, but they have a very different tone and feeling than most modern videos present.  Accompanying these videos are the wonderful sounds of the Dave Matthews Band, a unique and pure kind of music rarely found these days.  If you like DMB, there is no way you won't like this DVD.  I love the music, the videos are unique and amazing; this is definitely a worthy buy.",1006214400,7,557,4.701030927835052

However, if you have ever caught yourself so much as tapping your toes to a DMB tune... this is a must have for your home theater.  Every recorded DMB video thus far, including special scenes and extras make this a perfect buy for the DMB fan and promise to make it a collectible treasure for newbies.",1003104000,3,371,4.426470588235294
1631606,5,B00005NBR2,"I am not a huge fan of Dave Mathews Band, but I like their music video ""I did it"", plus this DVD was on sale, so I bought it.

1631607,5,B00005NBR2,"I found that in some cases (""I Did It"", in particular), I ended up like the song more after I had seen the video for it.  If you think anything DMB-related is worth its water, then this is definitely something to invest $X in.
From the truly excellent videos (""Crush"", ""The Space Between"") to the entertaining (""Too Much"", ""Stay"", ""I Did It"") to the downright weird (""Crash"", ""Don't Drink the Water"") and everywhere in between, this video provides a good viewer experience from front to back.",1000512000,,492,4.72093023255814
1631608,2,B00005NBR2,"I recently purchased this DVD and was enjoying it thouroughly until i got to the ""Don't Drink the Water"" Video. Near the end of the video, the DVD froze and there was nothing i could do to get it to continue playing short of turning it off and starting over.  I figured this might be a fluke so i tried it again and it did the same thing on both of my other two DVD players.
The content in the dvd is excellent, but it is up to you to decide if you can put up with the technical problems.",999907200,3,488,3.88
1631609,5,B00005NBR2,"Up until a year or so ago, I hadn't really listened to Dave Matthews Band regularly. Now after getting all their albums and hearing most of their tunes, I had to get this DVD to catch up on all the videos. I can't believe how much I've missed out on this great band in the last eight years.
Each video had its director's commentary, and three of them (Don't Drink the Water, Stay, I Did It) have short behind the scenes clips. Other than lyrical subtitles and 5.1 sound, these are the only extras, so you may be disappointed if you've memorized all the videos and are expecting in-depth interviews or biographies - there's none of that.
If I had been a long time fan, I probably wouldn't give it 5 stars, but since I had only seen a couple videos, it was a real treat for me.",999302400,5,775,4.243243243243243
1631610,5,B00005NBR2,"This is great DVD to own if you want a collection of all the Dave Matthews Band videos, what makes this particular collection great are the director commentaries, while short, they give some pretty interesting insight into the ideas that were used in making the videos as well good tid-bits on the band members themselves.  Ok...I also wanted to comment on cdubb24's review first off, its John Coltrane not John Cole Train and its the Temptations not the Temptaions learn how to spell before you post a review.  Second Dave's fan base is huge in the 20-24 year old age range, walk in any dorm hall in any North American college/university and I guarentee to you at least half of the students own a DMB cd.  Thirdly a bad review coming from a guy you gave the Red Shoe Diaries 5 stars is clearly suspect, hell when David Duchovney himself is ashamed of the ...you know it's not going to be quality viewing.  And lastly, if you want to go rip these Mike and Josh guys who you probably know in real life go do it their faces, it's pretty weak when you have to resort to ripping people you know in real life on the internet.",999216000,,1120,4.396135265700483
1631611,4,B00005NBR2,"I tend to agree that they want to milk every last cent out of us. However, being such a huge fan I would probably buy a DVD of Dave burping the ABCs. Normally this is where I would have said, ""WHY NOT A LIVE CONCERT??"" However, the band has redeemed themselves by offering the 12-19-1998 show in Chicago on DVD. This is due out October 23. This show is simply amazing... the opener of Last Stop gives me chills! Add Vic Wooten, Maceo Parker and Tim Reynolds to the mix and you've got perfection. I've had this show on MPG for about a year and I promise you are going to be blown away.",998784000,8,584,4.131578947368421
1631612,4,B00005NBR2,"then this is probably your thing. Musically, it isn't worth it. Most serious DMB fans acknowldge the songs released to radio, MTV etc. as the band's weaker yet more commercial songs. So much to Say, Too Much, and similar songs are NOT DMB's best work. If you're looking for the real Dave Matthews experience, check out Live at Luther College, which is essentially an acoustic greatest hits collection.
The videos aren't all bad, however. Songs like Stay, Crush, Crash Into Me and Sattelite are among the band's finer songs, and the videos show off Dave (and most of the band's) african heritage and diversity. If you're a dave matthews band fan, this is probably worth getting. Just get Live At Luther College first.",998438400,2,716,4.829268292682927
