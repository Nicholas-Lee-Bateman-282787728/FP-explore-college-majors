1344286,4,B00004RL4M,"This movie has been one of my favorite ""guilty pleasures"", and I recently bought it on DVD. Why? Well, if you're a Pat Morita fan, you'll like the movie. Even if he isn't playing Mr. Miyagi.

What you WILL enjoy is Jay Leno's rather fun take on a Detroit cop. And his observations on what Americans will and won't tolerate is accurate and funny. (Car alarm sounds --""Turn that **** off""!

It does seem as if Jackie Chan saw this and decided to remake it as the ""Rush Hour"" series. I liked this one better.",1155427200,5,505,4.3052631578947365

1344289,1,B00004RL4M,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

I have to rate some of the IMDB reviews as 10s because I never laughed harder than even seeing Pat Morita karate kick a moving car windshield. I was very surprised how much they rough housed Morita continually, this guy is no youngin'!

It was great to see the mighty USA in grand auto production and recall how you were treated if you bought a toyota. I imagine the animosity was real between the two countries, especially in Detroit. They even hand a line by their own admission, we had it coming.

The Vette in the opening scene was stunning and super cherried, saweeet ride! I was waiting to see if the car rental lady was going to end up in that Formula One race, that would be hilarious. They only issued a yellow flag for that scene with non-racers on the track, so realistic!

The music score was extremely annoying and sounded so much like Beverly Hills Cop I was rather 'shocked' to find the song list contained primarily nobodies.

The train scene with the non-stop shotgun/rifle/? was very funny for one minute but 10, I almost turned this film off. I was piqued by the size of the famed supercharger and determined you might decrease power with that thing in the way.

High recommend to watch and then read the comments on IMDB and also to see Leno try to act with very limited results. The final scene was the icing on this cake of cheese!",1422403200,,1395,4.450980392156863

1344297,4,B00004RL4M,"Writing fantastic B reviews can be very difficult. Sid makes it look effortless but its not. The first step is to make a proper selection. There is nothing worse than putting on a movie then 20 minutes later realizing that what you're watching is not good b or funny b but just worthless. Thankfully, when you see a buddy cop flick starring Jay Leno, yes the Jay Leno, and Pat Morita(from here on referred to as Mr. Myiagi) you know you're in for the long haul. This movie was filmed in 1989 but was not released until 1992. That and The Look are two hallmarks of phenomenal B power. Also take a look at the DVD cover...we'll wait until you're done laughing.

Could this piece really have been an impetus for Rush Hour? It certainly appears so. Leno plays a fast and loose Detroit detective in an era when the American auto industry was getting worked by its Japanese counterparts. Something that could turn the tide is a brand new turbocharger that was created by Saito, the supervillain from Karate Kid 2. He brings the turbo time to the U.S. and is killed over it almost immediately by a silent partner/thug of a third rate American car company. Mr. Myiagi is a detective from Tokyo sent to Detroit to find Saito and/or the turbocharger. At first, Leno and Myiagi don't get along at all but after a while they bond. It all starts with a drinking session where Myiagi reenacts the Banzai! scene from Karate Kid with Leno as Daniel-San. Naturally, they then team up to get the bad guys. The film culminates with Leno and Myiagi in a motorcycle chase with the bad guys that runs through the Detroit Grand Prix. This was definitely one of the best parts of the movie. When Leno and Myiagi first get on the motorcycle it takes them like 10 seconds and there are 4 guys standing there with guns. How many shots do they take on Leno or Miyagi? Of course zero. Like always there's the one main bad guy left and Leno and Myiagi have thrashed their chopper. The bad guy has them cornered in an alley and he's driving towards them. Nut job Miyagi runs right at the car and drop kicks the guy right through the windshield! It was every bit as cool as it sounds.

This masterpiece ends up with Leno seeing Miyagi off at the airport. He's got a going away present for Myiagi and it the turbocharger so Myiagi gets to keep his job. Aw. I'm surprised this was a concern. The Japanese are very fiscally responsible. Even that kimono you wear, where do you think that money goes? There were a few other interesting tidbits surrounding this one. Myigai's boss was played by the legend, Soon-Tek Oh. Again, the movie was filmed in 89. That's 48 years after Pearl Harbor and double Brett years after World War 2 ended. Having said that, there were roughly 200 Japanese slurs in the movie. Just seemed really weird. If you're gonna be racist at least be funny. When Leno wanted to make his face into a bicycle face like Dice suggested, he would tell a lady she was now part of an ongoing investigation so he needed her number. Smooth. Last but not least we always joke about this, but the reason this gem sat on the shelf for three years? They ran out of money on the last day of shooting. Perfect.",1401753600,,3179,4.432478632478633
1344308,3,B00004RL4M,"Collision Course is an Action/Comedy filmed in 1987, but not released until 1989.  If you're not offended by ethnic stereotypes, and enjoy cartoon violence and a little bit of bloodshed you might enjoy this movie.  It stars Jay Leno in his only leading film role to date, along with a fresh from the Karate Kid Pat Morita.

I personally purchased this video because I knew that it was filmed in my hometown of Detroit during the Grand Prix when it was still run downtown.  Fellow Detroiters will enjoy spotting locations such as the old Trapper's Alley in Greektown, Eastern Market, inside the State Fairgrounds Coliseum and a pre-Majestic Garden Bowl, as well as many drives down Woodward Avenue.  Another appeal of this film for me was the politically incorrect spirit which was still alive in the late '80's.  If you're easily offended or a millennial reared on ethnic sensitivity you might want to steer clear of this one.",1396137600,2,926,4.829113924050633

1344310,4,B00004RL4M,kind of like BLACK RAIN but in reverse. this is jay lenos only movie. love the many references to TOYOTA.,1382313600,2,105,4.3
1344311,4,B00004RL4M,"If you inhabit Detroit City, and a crime there desperately needed solving, how would you feel knowing that Jay Leno and Pat Morita were on the case? I thought so. COLLISION COURSE is a 1989 straight-to-video release - that was actually made in 1986 and then held back for three years - that tries to capitalize on the buddy cop formula. Leno and Morita are an earlier, more vanilla version of Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan. I confess to a bump of curiosity which compelled me to tune in.

Detroit cop Tony Costas (Leno) is already a loose cannon, so imagine his escalation of mayhem when his friend gets murdered with a rocket gun at an auto junk yard. Detective First Class Fujitsuka Natsuo (Morita) is one also not averse to sidestepping proper protocol. An officer in Tokyo Police's Industrial Espionage Division, he flies into Detroit on assignment to root out the thieves who stole a Japanese turbocharger prototype. Detectives Costas and Natsuo are on a collision course. But unlike another volatile East vs. West dust-up - yes, I refer to Michael Keaton and Gedde Watanabe in GUNG HO - our odd couple is armed.

Sure, this movie isn't without a smidge of social relevance. It examines - or at least touches on - the culture clash between Detroit - whose economy depends on its car industry - and Japan - whose export of its automobiles to America triggered mass downsizings in Detroit. One can't blame a native son of Detroit like Tony Costas for bearing rancor against someone like Fujitsuka Natsuo, never mind that Natsuo is this gracious, super-polite person. There's a sobering scene in which the pair drives thru a Detroit slum and an embittered Costas makes with the pointed commentary.

But mostly it's a comedic crime thriller. Like me, the big reason to watch COLLISION COURSE is to see how Mr. Miyagi and The Tonight Show host go about their business. It's jarring (in a good way) to take in Leno playing such an aggressive hot-head. As a nod to his gearhead hobby, there's a scene in which he drag races a c0cky bunch down the street. Meanwhile, Pat Morita remains cool as the other side of the pillow, laying down the wink of an eye, constantly undermining the stereotype of the inscrutable man of the East. I love the scene in which he gets down in the club. COLLISION COURSE is cheesy but also pretty cool. Nowadays it's very much a retro movie. It's got some good laughs; it covers a whole mess of buddy cop tropes. In another neat scene, Leno and Morita even get chewed out simultaneously by their respective bosses. Just goes to show, no matter where you're from, there's no getting away from an asschewing. 3.5 out of 5 stars.",1369785600,,2650,4.6581196581196584

East meets West as Pat Morita (Tokyo police detective) and Jay Leno (Detroit detective) team up to find a stolen auto turbo-charger thats to be sold on the American auto market in Detroit. A classic 80s movie with the music, acting, and screen presence. Kinda corny, kinda bad, no remarkable stunts or award-winning acting, but the movie gives a good vibe of fun. Good entertainment.
