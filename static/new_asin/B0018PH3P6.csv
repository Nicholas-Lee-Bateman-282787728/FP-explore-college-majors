Super Spooks

Ten of these are theatrical shorts already available on a much larger compilation called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harvey-Toons-The-Complete-Collection/dp/B000GG4XWE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harvey Toons - The Complete Collection</a>.
