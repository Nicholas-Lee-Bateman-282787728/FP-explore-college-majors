1891465,4,B00009W0UL,"The Team Angle-Team Lesnar match while having some flaws,it was still a good match. The Women's title match between Lita & Molly Holly was not great but pretty good. The Kane-Shane McMahon Ambulance match was a good reminder of ECW in the 1990's. The Smackdown tag team championship bout between The Basham Brothers(Doug & Danny) & Los Guerreros(Eddie & Chavo) was a pretty good bout for a tag team match. The Team Biscoff-Team Austin math was a hard-hitting,heart-stopping,nail-biting & epic bout. The Buried Alive match between The Undertaker & VKM was kind of one-sided with Vinnie Mac giving only a few shots. The RAW world title match between Goldberg & HHH was while not a good match,it still has it's moments. I give this event a 7 out of 10.",1279497600,,749,4.769230769230769

1891467,4,B00009W0UL,"This PPV came about in 2003, at the tail end of a dynamite run of PPV's from the WWE/WWF. The highlights in this year's edition of Survivor Series include a potential retirement match for Stone Cold Steve Austin, a battle for the World title featuring Goldberg defending against HHH; and the Undertaker attempting to get his final revenge against Mr. McMahon.

1) Basham Bros. vs Eddie and Chavo Guerrero for the WWE tag team titles
This opening bout, featuring a quartet of fine workers, keeps up the torrid pace till the finale, setting off this PPV on a fine note. Unexpected finish bonus: most people assumed Los Guerreros would regain the belts, but it was not to be as Chavo did the job. (***)

2)Molly Holly vs Lita for the women's championship
After all this time, and the WWE still can't put together a decent womens match. Lita looks great however. (*1/2)

3)Team Angle vs Team Lesnar
The WWE was absolutely loaded with talent at this time. They must've been, to have their two best workers, Lesnar and Angle, in a crowded, meaningless survivor match. Entertaining? Totally. Angle's team also consisted of Chris Benoit, Hardcore Holly, JBL (still just Bradshaw then) and brash rookie John Cena, who was allowed to score the winning pinfall. Brock's team was comprised of Big Show, A-Train, Nathan Jones, and a pre-TNA Matt Morgan. (Shocking that Vince let a wooden, muscular 7 footer go!) (***1/2)

4) Shane McMahon vs Kane in an ambulance match
Despite the proliferation of talent, it seemed that at least 2 matches in every PPV of this time featured a McMahon. In this case, big bump-crazy Shane facing the demonic Kane. Shane O'Mac managed to get over with the fans almost upon arrival to in-ring action back in the late 90's. His ridiculous tolerance for punishment, best evidenced in the brutal anything goes match against Angle won him a great deal of respect from fans, if not wrestlers and internet scribes. This one just feels tired, though; we've seen it enough. Break time, Shane-O. (**)

5)Team Austin vs Team Bischoff: If Austin's team loses, he must resign as co-GM of Raw, effectively ending his career.
The absolute highlight of the show. The stakes were high, but the majority of fans had to assume Austin's team would get the win, allowing the most popular and financially lucrative pro wrestler in history to resume his ass-kicking ways. The dastardly Eric Bischoff, who wanted Raw all to himself, brought a formidable team: Scott Steiner, Christian, Mark Henry, Randy Orton, and the great Chris Jericho. Defending Austin's honor were Booker T, Rob Van Dam, The Dudleys, and the incomparable Shawn Michaels. The match itself was long and told a story, just like it should. Austin's team was disadvantaged first, losing D-Von Dudley, and the action was fast and furious. The beginning of the end started with 3 men left on EB's squad, Jericho, Christian, and Orton. On Stone Cold's side, there was one. The Heartbreak Kid was at his best from here on out, battling seemingly unbeatable odds. After a bump outside the ring, Michaels bladed and came up just hemmoraging blood. He obviously hit an artery, as a near arterial spray continued for several minutes. This being the Kid, however, he found the will to not only compete, but blow everyone else out of the water. Shawn was first able to get a pinfall on Christian, leaving Bischoff apoplectic. But HBK was spent; it appeared he, and Austin's WWE future, was doomed. But after some more double teams and administered poundings, Shawn shocked Jericho with a superkick and got the pin. Now, it looked like a sure thing, just on the other side. Orton, who'd been thrown out of the ring, returned and beat on the feisty Showstopper. A ref bump ensued, however, just when it appeared Michaels had it won. At that time, a newcomer by the name of Batista flew into the ring, and delivered a thunderous powerslam to the Heartbreak kid. Orton then rolled over and got the pinfall win counted by a slowly recovering ref. Austin was devastated, Shawn apologized, and Steve accepted it. He made a speech to the Texas fans, but then for some reason Jonathon Coachman came out surrounded by security. He ragged on Austin for a bit, at which point the Texas Rattlesnake did what he does: whoop ass. He beat up the guards, then proceeded to stomp Coachman into oblivion. And off he went into the sunset. (****1/4)

The Undertaker vs Vince McMahon: Buried Alive match
The crowd was emotionally spent after the last match, as the bookers must have known they'd be. So why is this silly match on in the #2 spot? Uh, 1 guess. Anyway, McMahon spent the majority of the match getting crushed, and almost immediately gigged. His wound compared to Shawns, in that it might have been excessive. But Vince just had to show he's one of the boys. Taker threw the boss into the pre-dug hole, and opened the door to the massive loader. The machine, however, was loaded with an explosive, blowing the Dead Man backwards. Out came Kane, who pummeled, then literally buried Undertaker. Vince gets the duke. (**)

Goldberg vs Triple H for the World Heavyweight Title
It seems Trips has had the same entrance forever! If Motorhead wrote a song about me, I'd keep it too. Goldberg followed, at first to a quieter than expected pop. But the fans got behind the big guy in no time, cheering along the champ as he tried to keep the belt away from Mr. Stephanie McMahon. To the surprise of many, Goldberg succeeded, pinning the challenger after his trademark suplex. (***1/2)",1259280000,,5517,4.782791185729276
1891468,3,B00009W0UL,"Survivor Series has always been a hit or miss PPV. This year was a good PPV but nothing really stood out.

Team Angle(Angle, Benoit, Cena, Bradshaw, and Holly) vs Team Lesnar(Brock, A-Train, Jones, Morgan and Big Show): Smackdown had so much talent at this time. A good much with Cena giving an F-U to Big Show to win for Team Angle.

Lita vs Molly Holly: Skip

Shane vs Kane (Ambulence Match): A very brutal match that didn't last long. Shane is always good in hardcore matches but I wouldnt rank this in his top five.

Gurreros vs Bashams Brothers: Gurreros always put on a good show but this could have been seen on any Smackdown program that year.

Team Austin(HBK, Dudleys, RVD, and Booker T.) vs Team Bischoff(Steiner, Henry, Christian, Y2J and Randy Orton)- A very good performance by HBK despite a losing effort.

HHH vs Goldberg: Hated Goldberg in WCW but couldn't wait to see him dethorne Triple H. Good thing Goldberg kept the title but that would only last for anther month.

Good wrestling and well worth the price of admission.",1196121600,,1041,4.655737704918033
1891469,4,B00009W0UL,"The buildup to WM20 started here, not as good as the prior year's event, but nonetheless a strong effort from WWE.

Classic SS Elimination Match
Team Angle: Kurt Angle, Chris Beniot, John Cena, Bradshaw, & Hardcore Holly vs. Team Lesnar: Brock Lesnar, Big Show, Nathan Jones, Matt Morgan, & A-Train:
Overall a crisp, good performance from everyone, with a few head scratchers thrown in.  It does little to promote the upcoming match at the Rumble between Holly and Lesnar, the first few eliminations happen in less than five minutes, and the WWE Champ, who doesn't have a title match at Survivor Series is forced to tap?  With that aside, it's a pretty good watch.

Women's Title
Molly Holly vs. Lita:
Surprisingly, this manages to exceed mediocrity and produce a watchable match. Leaps and bounds better than WWE's 2011 divas efforts.

Ambulance Match
Kane vs. Shane McMahon:
The usual spotfest of a match when Shane McMahon is involved, but it is still pretty good.  There are lots of hard hits and ouch moments.  Probably not as good as their match at Unforgiven, but still a solid encounter.  Predictable ending.

WWE Tag Team Titles
The Basham Brothers w/ Shaniqua vs. Los Guerreros:
An above average filler match, that continues the pace of good matches on the evening.  However this is plagued by the usual cheap ending that we were used to seeing when these two teams had matches together.  Probably one of the worst matches on the night, but still passable.

Classic SS Elimination Match
Team Austin: Rob Van Dam, Booker T, Shawn Michaels, & Dudley Boyz vs. Team Bischoff: Christian, Mark Henry, Chris Jericho, Randy Orton, & Scott Steiner:
In my opinion, one of the best matches of the decade!  This one is given plenty of time to get going, none of the eliminations were rushed or questionable.  There were times of faster pace and slower, but still moving to keep the crowd cheering.  The drama at the end is also outstanding, with the croud into the match the whole time.  Shawn Michaels puts on another remarkable performance.  One for the ages.

Buried Alive Match
Undertaker vs. Vince McMahon:
Not even the surprising ending at the timely buildup for the match could save the slow squash that this was.  It merely consists of Taker beating down McMahon for ten straight minutes, with no defense from McMahon.  A bloodbath, with an interesting twist.  Worst match of the night.

World Heavyweight Title
Goldberg vs. Triple H:
Nothing really to speak of here.  This storyline had already been beat to death by the time the event started, and the WWE did nothing to keep me interested in the bounty HHH was holding over Goldberg.  As for the match, it's the worst of their three (or four) PPV matches together, with a strange ending.  An unsatisfying way to end this PPV.

This is one of the only Survivor Series of the decade that actually lives up the name of SURVIVOR.  A few of the matches deliver in a big way with only one letdown.  However this is one you can pop in, watch from start to finish, and be entertained the whole way.  DVD comes with some good extras as well.  Enjoy.",1184716800,,3099,4.716945996275605
1891470,4,B00009W0UL,"The road to the WWE's biggest PPV event (at that time) in WrestleMania XX started here as the Survivor Series.  Various seeds for the upcoming months leading up to WrestleMania were planted here along with a few suprizes that you didn't expect at that time.

Elimination Match: Kurt Angle, John Cena, Chris Benoit, Bradshaw, Hardcore Holly vs. Brock Lesnar, Big Show, Nathan Jones, Matt Morgan, A-Train - The SmackDown elimination match kicked off the show here with a bang.  Before we got get down to a really good match, they had to get over the obivious storylines & eliminations such as Holly's DQ along with A-Train & Bradshaw's quick eliminations with Nathan Jones & Matt Morgan being the next ones to go.  After losing the ""dead weight"", the match went along well with a few suprizing eliminations such as both team captains not surviving in the end (which they do most of the time).

Womens Champion Molly Holly vs. Lita - Before I get started, look at Molly's tape on her wrist for the initals ""C.H."" that were in memory of the late Crash Holly who died earlier that month.  As the match itself, it was a few months since Lita's return from her neck injury so this was more of a ground based match instead of the usual lucha libre style that Lita showed before he injury.  It was good but slow at times.

Ambulance Match: Shane McMahon vs. Kane - Just was a non-stop brawl that passed the expectations set by their previous match at Unforgiven months earlier.  They went all the way backstage and Shane McMahon was able to take some harsh punishment by Kane including being tossed onto the ambulance various times.  This was the end of their fued but Shane was really able to sell Kane's punishment.

Right around here I think they did an interview with Brock Lesnar that was interrupted...by Goldberg.

WWE Tag Team Champions Basham Brothers vs. Los Guerreros - This was a good match here that went back & forth at times with great athleticism shown by the Guerrero's.  The main story behind the match was to continue the tease of a split between Chavo & Eddie.

Elimination Match - Team Austin vs. Team Bischoff: Shawn Michaels, Dudley Boyz, Rob Van Dam, Booker T vs Chris Jericho, Christian, Mark Henry, Randy Orton, Scott Steiner - This was the match of the night & it was a great effort put forth by a majority of those involved.  The story in the end was HBK fighting the odds against 3 men only to be cost the match in the end by Evolution member Batista giving his fellow teammate Randy Orton the sole surviving victory in the end.

Around here, Austin gave an emotional ""farewell"" speech which was interrupted by Coach before he ended up getting beat up & stunnered before Austin drank beer & left.  If this wasn't a storyline, it would have made an awesome retirement speech.

Buried Alive Match: Undertaker vs. Mr. McMahon - To summerize, McMahon is just spilling blood...after the first punch in less than a minute & takes a non-stop beating here until Kane comes to his aid in the end and buries Undertaker alive.

World Champion Goldberg vs. Triple H - WWE couldn't have put Goldberg over anymore than they did during this match.  Goldberg was heavily selling his injured lower leg from Batista collecting the bounty weeks earlier and was able to overcome the constant interfearence of Ric Flair and fellow Evolution members in Randy Orton & Batista before gaining the pinfall.  It was one of Goldberg's best match in this WWE career (and you can't say there were alot of them).

In the end, this PPV did it's job in ending & planting seends for future storylines along with giving up an entertaining card from top to bottom.  This was one of the best Surivivor Series of all time & I highly recommend it.",1182384000,,3728,4.623672230652504
1891471,5,B00009W0UL,We can always recommend any WWE Series dvd.  They are always worth the money.,1180828800,,77,4.5
1891472,4,B00009W0UL,"With the recent decay in WWE's quality, and a lack of real show-stopping events I've seen lately in 2003, I was surprised by this PPV event's greatness in comparison with others I've seen before this one.  It's still no WWF, but it's solid for its time.

Classic Survivor Series Match
Team Angle (Kurt Angle, Chris Benoit, John Cena, Hardcore Holly, Bradshaw) vs Team Lesnar (Brock Lesnar, Matt Morgan, Nathan Jones, The Big Show, A-Train)
This one was a disappointment, but it at least had some surprises to keep me interested.  It was very quick, considering the scope of the men involved, and there were some pretty weak eliminations, especially that of Hardcore Holly and Bradshaw, but I was surprised to see the team leaders eliminated before their other team members.  (5/10)

Women's Championship
Lita vs Molly Holly
I had said before that WWE has a nasty reputation for making little use of it's women's division beyond eye candy and four or five wrestling moves.  This one was perhaps the last great women's match I've seen since the year before between Trish Stratus and Victoria.  More than four or five wrestling moves are used, and these two compete at a level like the men.  One of the better matches of the night, surprisingly.  (8/10)

Ambulance Match
Kane vs Shane McMahon
This one had a lot of backstory accompanying it, so there was plenty of emotion fueling these two.  It was an impressive brawl, extending far backstage even, and it was great seeing Shane McMahon's high flying moves from the ring and atop the ambulance.  I didn't really like it too much, but I see how great it was.  (10/10)

WWE Tag Team Championship
The Basham Brothers (C) vs Los Guerrerros
If it weren't for Eddie and Chavo Guerrerro's athleticism in this match, it would have been a bit of a boring match.  The Bashams really didn't show much to be impressed with, and their S&M gimmick was really unsettling.  Not because it was scary or anything, but just that it was weird...  (5.5/10)

Classic Survivor Series Match
Team Austin (Shawn Michaels, Buh Buh Ray Dudley, D-Von Dudley, Rob Van Dam, Booker T) vs Team Bischoff (Chris Jericho, Randy Orton, Mark Henry, Scott Steiner, Christian)
This was a vast improvement over the first night's Survivor Series Match.  I was heavily impressed by the athleticism and might of all the people here on Stone Cold's team, and all but two of the members of Bischoff's team.  Steiner surprised me with an actual wrestling move, but he did very little else.  Mark Henry was his usual disappointing self.  When it came down to Shawn Michaels and Randy Orton, Chris Jericho, and Christian, it got very tense, and Michaels could just barely hold himself up towards the end.  The ending was disappointing, but the match itself was tremendous.  (10/10)

Buried Alive Match
Undertaker vs Vince McMahon
I believe this match was a good idea.  With the Undertaker's loss, he could return with the old Deadman gimmick which everyone so loved, and ditch this American Bad Ass biker gimmick.  The match was essentially a glorified squash match, with McMahon blading on the first punch, and apparently botching as he was bleeding profusely throughout the entire match.  While a squash, Undertaker managed to make it look good, and thankfully it wasn't too long, ending effectively.  (8/10)

World Heavyweight Championship
Triple H vs Goldberg (C)
Eh.  I don't really like Goldberg, but you can clearly see his talent for wrestling in this match.  It was a short, weak match, with really little going for it except Goldberg's heavy skill and Triple H's great skill.  (5/10)

All in all, it was simply solid.  Not a best ever, but certainly a good one.  Better than the last year's event.",1178668800,,3707,4.837837837837838
1891473,4,B00009W0UL,"Angle's Team: Kurt Angle, Chris Benoit, John Cena, Bradshaw, & Hardcore Holly Vs. Lesnar's Team: WWE Champion Brock Lesnar, U.S. Champion The Big Show, Nathan Jones, Matt Morgan, & A-Train (Survivor Series Elimination Match) - Smackdown's elimination match opens up the show here as this match is one heck of an opening bout. This match had a few varibales going in such as Hardcore Holly's rage to gain vengeance against Brock Lesnar for breaking his neck a year ago, Bradshaw's & A-Train's early eliminations, John Cena's loyalty to his team, & the surpirse eliminations of both team's captains. After the first three early eliminations, the match flowed at a good & steady pace allowing each individual to shine which gave great action along the way. This is one of the best matches of the night & an awesome match to start things off. 4/5

Around here is a segment involving Mr. McMahon talking to his son Shane about their matches later in the night that eventually leads to an ""awkward"" moment among Mr. McMahon and Stone Cold Steve Austin...

WWE Women's Champion Molly Holly Vs. Lita - This was Lita's first Women's Title Match since her return back after her neck injury and she really performed quite well. Molly was wrestling a very rough and ruthless match while Lita was relying on her high flying, unothodoxed, ""Hardy like"" offense. Another good match of the night & a great WWE Women's Title as well. 3.25/5

Shane McMahon Vs. Kane (Ambulance Match) - Literally, this match was an all out brawl and in ways it surpassed their Last Man Standing match in Steptember at Unforgiven. These two fought all over the arena starting at ringside and quickly fighting their way to the backstage area and finally back to the Ambulance site. Shane McMahon did an outstanding job selling the punishment inflected by Kane and also showed at great deal of athleticism in the progress. This match was advertised as ""The Final Encounter"" and that was indeed what it was between these two. 4.5/5

Around here is an interview with Smackdown's WWE Champion Brock Lesnar that led to a confrontation with Raw's World Heavyweight Champion...Goldberg.

WWE Tag Team Champions The Basham Brothers Vs. Los Guerreros - This turned out to be a very good Tag Team Title match. There were some good high flying maneuvers from Los Guerreros and some good team work from both the Bashams and the Guerreros. Again, just a good all around tag team match but the story here is to further the animosity between Eddie & Chavo. 3.75/5

Stone Cold Steve Austin's Team: Shawn Michaels, Booker T, Intercontinental Champion RVD, & World Tag Team Champions The Dudley Boyz Vs. Eric Bischoff's Team: Chris Jericho, Christian, Scott Steiner, Mark Henry, & Randy Orton (Survivor Series Elimination Match) - The added on stipulation here was if Stone Cold's team loses, then Stone Cold must quit his job as Co-GM but if Stone Cold's team wins, then the ""old"" Stone Cold would return. But the main story here was that Stone Cold had to ""trust"" five guys enable to keep his job as the Co-GM of Raw.

This is the match of the night without a doubt with the majority of the guys in the match putting in a good effort to produce a great 5 on 5 match. But the main story here in this match was a bloody Shawn Michaels nearly over coming the 3 on 1 odds if it wasn't for Batista interferring and helping out his fellow Evolution member Randy Orton in gaining the sole survivor victory for his team. After which, Stone Cold Steve Austin gives an emotional ""farewell"" speech that later leads to Stone Cold stunning The Coach and having one last beer bash...or so we thought at the time. 5/5

Undertaker Vs. Mr. McMahon (Buried Alive Match) - To make things short...McMahon begins to spill blood after one punch and from there takes a non-stop beating until Kane interferes and helps McMahon bury the Undertaker alive which gave reason for the Undertaker to go back to his dark days ways. 3/5

World Heavyweight Champion Goldberg Vs. Triple H - Goldberg was heavily put over here in this match after suffering a broken ankle thanks to Evolution member Batista after collecting the bounty HHH placed on the head of Goldberg's. This match is certainly not one of the bests in either Triple H's or Goldberg's career but this was one of Goldberg's best matches in his short WWE career. HHH thoroughly targeted the lower injured leg of Goldberg's until Goldberg fought back even battling interferneces from all of Evolution until hitting th Jackhammer on HHH for the win. Again, not a bad World Title Match and certainly one of Goldberg's best matches throughout his WWE career. 3.75/5

Survivor Series was a great PPV one of the bests throughout 2003. I highly recommend this event.",1171324800,,4735,4.77045177045177

1891476,5,B00009W0UL,"This was one of the best Survivor Series I've seen.

1. Team Angle vs. Team Lesnar

I was surprised that this match was first, but I guess it was necessary. It got the crowd excited for the show. Some early eliminations helped the match run better, such as Hardcore Holly,A-Train and Bradshaw. The fast paced action was good and John Cena became a contender in my mind because of this match. 9 out of 10.

2. Molly Holly vs. Lita(WWE Women's Championship)

This match was just average. It wasn't too great. Lita should be wrestling now because there is a lack of really talented Divas in the WWE and she could help5 out of 10.

3. Ambulance Match

Kane vs. Shane McMahon

Match of the night. This match was brutal and had non-stop action. Within the first minute and a half Shane did an elbow drop through the Announcer's Table. Some sick bumps were taken, such as the ambulance door being opened right into Kane's head. Shane did a nice move off the top of the ambulance. 10 out of 10.

4. Los Guerreros(R.I.P. Eddie) vs. The Basham Brothers(WWE Tag Team Championship)

This was a good tag team match;better than I expected. The Bashams were a good tag team and they had some good tag team matches. Good pace. 7 out of 10.

5. Team Austin vs. Team Bischoff(If Austin wins, he can whoop ass again. If Bischoff wins,Austin is fired)

This match had a lot riding on it for both teams. This would've been the match of the night if it wasn't for the Ambulance Match. I liked the order of Elimination, except Rob Van Dam always gets eliminated early on.(Why?)Shawn Michaels tried to fight 3-on-1 odds, but Batista interfered and cost Austin his job. Truly a shocking ending and not the last one of the night. 10 out of 10.

6. Buried Alive Match

Undertaker vs. Vince McMahon

I really thought that this should've been the main event. Vince got his ass handed to him on a silver platter. He was bleeding pretty bad too. Another shocking ending with Kane coming out. Another memorable moment in SS history. 8 out of 10.

7. Goldberg vs. Triple H(World Heavyweight Championship)

This was a very weak main event. I was expecting the Buried Alive match to be the main event. The only good part was the interference. 6 out of 10.

Truly a great Survivor Series with many memorable moments.",1144540800,3,2280,4.521951219512195

1891482,4,B00009W0UL,"Hello and welcome to my review on Survivor Series 2003. I use a grading system and each match receives a grade. Then to determine how the show ranks the total of the matches scores are divided by the number of matches giving the grade and a comment about whether you should buy it or not. The grading system is as follows.

Grading E- =0.8.33%-Waste of time and money.
  E  =8.33 - 16.66%-Waste of time and money.
  E+ = 16.66 - 24.99%-Waste of time and money.
  D- = 24.99 - 33.32%-Very poor event maybe read about it.
  D  = 33.32 - 41.65%-Poor event with a little something standing out.
  D+ = 41.65 - 50%-Not a very good event but it just below passing.
  C- = 50 - 55.55%-Just below average worth a watch.
  C  = 55.55 - 61%-An average event worth a renting.
  C+ = 61 - 66.65%-Above average worth a purchase if you can find it for cheap.
  B- = 66.65 - 72.20%-Good event with a lot of good stuff. Purchase if you're a collector or interested.
  B  = 72.20 - 77.75%-Good quality event which is worth purchase and should be collected.
  B+ = 77.75 - 83.30%-Very high quality event with awesome matches. Must have for anyone.
  A- = 83.30 - 88.85%-Excellent event, must have for anyone. Lock this one away.
  A  = 88.85 - 94.40%-Extremely spectacular event with lots of great stuff. Lock this away.
  A+ = 94.40 - 100%-DVD of the century, must buy and keep in a very safe place.

Match One-Elimination Match-Team Angle-Kurt Angle,Chris Benoit,Bradshaw,John Cena & Hardcore Holly Vs Team Lesnar-Brock Lesnar,Big Show,A-Train,Matt Morgan & Nathan Jones-This was a strange choice like John Cena said in his rap as it was supposedly Smackdowns main event. Matt Morgans and Nathan Jones's PPV debut and they both did their best they could. The eliminations were well spread out except some at the start were a little too quick but it was still alright. My rating 8.71/10.

Match Two-Womens Title-Molly Holly(C)Vs Lita-This was Litas first title match since returning from injury and she did very well in my opinion. There were some great moves done with some great action done by them both. The ending was nothing great but it did what was needed and finished off this nice little match in a good way. My rating 7.15/10.

Match Three-Ambulance Match-Shane McMahon Vs Kane-This was off the chart from the word go. They had awesome and amazing bumps and used the ambulance to the most of what they could do with it.  There was no blood in this match but it was still an exceptional match and a great idea on how to end this feud. Hopefully Kane goes on to destroy more people and play the great heel he has done so far. My rating 8.67/10.

Match Four-WWE Tag Team Championships-Doug & Danny Basham(C)Vs Chavo & Eddie Guerrero-This was the perfect match to have in between match four and five as it kept the crowd in it while cooling them down a little bit. There was great teamwork in this match between the teams and Shaniqua interefered constantly which was a nice idea. This match was a great match. Keep up the good work guys. My rating 8.53/10.

Match Five-Elimination Match-Team Austin-RVD,Booker T,D-Von Dudley,Buh Buh Ray Dudley & Shawn""HBK""Michaels Vs Team Bischoff-Chris""Y2J""Jericho,Scott Steiner,Mark Henry,Christian & Randy Orton-Great match,there was lots of action from all ten men and they all contributed to this match. HBK bled like anything and he fought with everything he had for Stone Cold. Great great match,worth price of DVD alone. My rating 9.79/10.

Match Six-Buried Alive-Undertaker Vs Vince McMahon-This match was a bloody mess with Vince being opened up and gushing blood after two punches. There was lots of brawling, some shovel shots, some electrical cable and many more objects used to destroy each other. This told a story better then a book with them destroying each other and beating on each other for ten odd minutes. The ending wasn't the greatest but it did what was needed. My rating 9.07/10.

Match Seven-Main Event-World Heavyweight Championship-Goldberg(C)Vs HHH-This was Hunters rematch from Unforgiven and it was a little bit better then their Unforgiven match in my opinion. They both put on a stellar effort with all of Evolution interfering. Goldberg was very strong out there and so was Hunter with both men doing their best. This may well end the feud as its starting to lose quite a bit of steam. My rating 8.82/10.

Overall this show had a lot of good matches with it being a must buy in my opinion. The score of it was 60.74 out of 70 which is 86.77% which as a grade is an A- which means its an excellent event,must have for anyone. Lock this DVD away as its too good to lose.

1891484,4,B00009W0UL,"2003 was one of the WWE's best years.  Goldberg getting signed and the takeover of Brock Lesnar made this year excellent.  With amazing PPV's throughout the year of 2003, how can anyone forget the Survivor Series.  Being one of the classic five ppv's and having an unbelievable card, I couldn't help but order it live and also buy the DVD when it was released.  Below are match by match ratings and my thoughts on the matches, respectively.

World Heavyweight Championship

Triple-H (champ) vs Goldberg

My Rating: **1/2

Slow to start and it did get pretty boring in the middle, but the finish really kept me on the edge of my seat.  These guys have really good, physical matches together.  However, I think their match at Unforgiven was a bit better.  Still good, though.

Classic Survivor Series Match

Stone Cold's Team vs Bischoff's Team

My Rating: ****1/2

Two Words: Shawn Michaels.  The guy completely stole the show.  A very long, physical, bloody, and amazing match.

Classic Survivor Series Match

Team Angle vs Team Lesnar

My Rating: ****

Really fast paced match.  Really good choice for an opener.  Finish was great.

Ambulance Match

Shane McMahon vs Kane

My Rating: ***3/4

A VERY rough match.  Shane took all the usual bumps and then some.  Kane took a sick shot to the head when Kane slammed the ambulance door on his skull.  This is usual crazy Shane O Mac stuff.

WWE Tag Team Championship

Basham Brothers vs Los Guerreros

My Rating: **1/2

Not bad.  A usual Bashams/Guerreros Match.  Seemed like a filler to me since these guys have loads of matches on Smackdown!

Women's Championship

Molly Holly vs Lita

My Rating: **1/4

Good for a women's match, which usually suck anyway.  Obviously a filler though, so who cares.

Buried Alive Match

Undertaker vs Mr McMahon

My Rating: **1/2

All I have to say is that the blood in this match was SICK.  Vince's head was literally spraying blood.  Finish was surprising.  Otherwise, an average Undertaker match.

Overall, the 2003 Survivor Series was great.  One of the really good PPV's of 2003 and a lot better than the 2004 Survivor Series.  It definitely ranks in the top five Surv. Ser. PPV's.  Worth the money.",1120348800,,2185,4.7831978319783195

great! very fast paced. no boring spots. very smart of them to get rid of holly early becasue he sucks at wrestling. still team lesnar stuck to their power moves while team angle stuck at what they do best. 9/10

2. Molly Holly vs. Lita for womens title

garbage 1/10

3. Kane vs. Shane Mcmahon in an ambulance match

wow this was hardcore! both of these guys just tried to rip each other to pieces doing some of the craziest stunts i have ever seen! both guys took some big bumps and in the end the we see shane actually jump of the ambulance onto kane! 10/10

4. WWE tag team titles

  Basham Brothers vs. Los Gurreos

nothing special. just a normal tag match. just put in to cool down the crowd. 7/10

5. team Austin( Booker T, Rob Van Dam, Dudley Boyz, and Shawn Mhicaels )vs. team Bischoff( Scott Stenier, Mark Henry, Christan, Chris Jerhico, and Randy Orton )

a classic. best match on the card. i still can not believe that Mhicaels was able to last that long in the ring. i can not believe how much blood he lost! there were a lot of different styles clashing so i was worried but it ended up working out as soon as steiner and henry were elminated but Booker was elminated too quikley for my taste. 10/10

6. Vince Mcmahon vs. Undertaker in a buried alive match

what the hell was this? it was just a lot of blood no offensive moves from vince and kane betarys his brother. 6/10

7. World Heavyweight title

  Goldberg vs. HHH

a good match but not main event quailty. Goldberg was getting tired at the end and he is definatley past his prime. Evoultion charged out at the end and to make goldberg look strong they had him destroy them. good but not great. 8/10

Team Lesnar vs Team Angle- Great match. SD! Main Event was the opener. Even John Cena says something about that in his freestyle before the match. Lesnar's team is huge. Hardcore Holly gets DQed before the match started by shoving the ref. Then Bradshaw hits the clothesline from hell on A-Train and he's eliminated. Then Big Show hits the chokeslam on Bradshaw and he's gone. Matt Morgan comes in and gets Angle slammed and is eliminated. Brock hits the F-5 to eliminate Angle. The Crippler makes Brock submit. Cena hits Show with the brass knucks and then hits the F-U. Survivors are Cena and Benoit. Match Rating 8

Molly Holly vs Lita- I tried to watch the first two minutes of it but then I pressed skip and Molly won. Match Rating ?

Kane vs Shane Mcmahon Ambulance match- Before the match I knew this one would be very spotty. The cameramen miss Kane falling on his head at the begining of the match. Shane hits his classic elbow drop through the annouce table. Then Shane takes Kane to the back and hits him with a car and Kane falls through glass. Then they go back out and Shane lays a trash can at Kane's face and get's on the Ambulance and dropkicks the can into his face. Kane gets up and then tombstone him on the concrete and wins. Match Rating 7

SD! Tag titles Bashams vs Los Gurreos- Good tag match. Shnikque gets involved. Then She body slams Eddie on the outside! Nice Luchador style by the Gurreos. Bashams steal it with the tights. Match Rating 6.5

Team Austin vs Team Bischoff Austin loses his job if his team loses- What a match. This was match of the night in my opionion. Booker T eliminates Scott Steiner with the sciccors kick. Then the Dudleys hit the 3-D and RVD hits the Frog Splash and then they all pile on top of him to get him eliminated. Then Orton and RVD are in then Orton hits the RKO to elimnate RVD. Then Jericho elimnates D-von. Christian eliminates Bubba. Then its three on 1. Michaels gives Christian the Sweet Chin Music and he's gone. Then Michaels eliminates Chris Jericho. Jericho then flips the rattlesnake of and they start yelling at each other. The ref gets hit and then Batista Powerbombs HBK. Then Orton picks up the victory for Team Bischoff. Match Rating 10

Buried Alive Undertaker vs Mr. Mcmahon- ok match. Very brutual. Vince is bleeding so bad. Taker dominates. Taker hits Vince with the steel shovel. They go to the grave and he has Vince in there and tries to go dump the dirt on him then a big fire ball hits him and Kane puts him in the grave and buries him.

HHH vs Goldberg World Heavyweight Championship- Good match. Goldberg is so strong. It had a good length of 16 minutes. Goldberg shouldn't have been injured but he still beat Triple H and all of evolution so he is still the World Heavyweight Champion. Nice way to end a great PPV. Match Rating 8

Buried Alive Match
Undertaker vs. Vince McMahon

the best match of the PPV. undertaker dominates the match. beating Vince to a bloody mess. one punch and vince is pouring blood. when they get to the hole. undertaker puts vince in the hole. but when he gets to the truck holding the dirt above the hole. then surpisingly.... well you have to watch to find out what happens. it will have you frozen with you mouth droping to the floor in disbelieve.

1891488,5,B00009W0UL,"Team Angle def Team Lesnar : As even John Cena had pointed out, it seemed a little unusual for Smackdown's main event to be placed at the beginning of the match card. Nevertheless, this got the excitement level going in the crowd (i think) and although Smackdown in 2005 continue to promote Matt Morgan as a newcomer, watch this match and you will learn the truth!

WWE Women's Championship match - These matches turn me off completely from wrestling. When I bought wrestling videos I had to watch them, but with wrestling DVD's I skipped to something a little more interesting.

Kane def Shane McMahon : This match was extremely early in the card, when the tag team match definitely should have been first. This match was reminiscent of the Big Show vs Shane match at Backlash 2001, a time when Shane McMahon was clashing with the likes of Kurt Angle and The Rock. At the previous PPV we witnessed deja vu when Shane jumped off the stage. However, nothing on that scale of spectacular happened in this match and did anyone notice that Kane has the most boring wrestling technique of all time.

Raw promo segments - The clash between Bischoff and Cuben wasn't appropriate as being in England I would not have known who he was!! The Evolution locker room scene was slightly better and you could tell how Orton was indeed getting the cold shoulder in the group with how he had to do the dirty work for Bischoff, whilst Batista, HHH and Flair sat back and had a few drinks with the ladies. It was inevitable from this point in time believe me!

Basham Brothers def Los Guerreros : I really can't see the interest in Smackdown's tag division, particularly at this point in time, with the likes of the Basham Brothers as champions. I skipped this match too, haha!

Team Austin vs Team Bischoff - This match had me pumped and was the one thing I was looking forward to seeing on the card. Nevertheless, my heart sank when I started to see Austin's team fade away, leaving Michaels with 3 opponents on his hands. I was literally jumping up and down on the couch when Michaels covered Jericho and Christian, but I found it hard to believe when Orton covered Michaels. I hadn't watched wrestling the previous year and didn't know of how Austin's career had ended but I was astounded to find out the truth.

Buried Alive Match : Undertaker vs McMahon - This has always been a disaster area for Undertaker. He hadn't won the first Buried Alive match or any Buried Alive match, so despite cheering the Dead Man on, I was a little sceptical of the outcome. I found the match unconvincing on several levels, the huge open wound on McMahon's face for one, which couldn't possibly be caused by a mere punch. Things had further failed to go to plan, with Undertaker injuring himself badly towards the end of the bout, if you viewers will look closely. I had watched this match and this whole PPV a year after the night so it wasn't shocking to me what happened.

Goldberg vs Triple H : What do the Raw storywriters do when they're fresh out of ideas? Just book a rematch. I had seen a better bout at Unforgiven and it took a while for business to pick up, particularly with Ric Flair on the outside of the ring. I believe in the past two matches the fans were devasted at the outcome of the Austin match to really care if Goldberg retained or not. Nothing would ever last forever and Triple H will always capture the world heavyweight championship at least twice a year.

In summary, I think the WWE attempted to do too much in one Pay Per View, with too many surprises to handle. All I know is that I wished I saw Raw the night after, for watching one of these classic pay per views had spurred me on to watch more WWE.",1116547200,,3703,4.459379615952733

TEAM ANGLE defeated TEAM LESNAR (Survivors: John Cena & Chris Benoit): Interesting choice as the opener, but a daring & good one (because of the way the match played out). Three superstars being eliminated in the first 2 minutes was probably a bit much, but Holly, Bradshaw & A-Train were pretty much there for the ride anyway. Morgan & Jones did their jobs, while Angle's flurry of offense was sensational. Lesnar F-5'ing Angle, but then tapping to Benoit basically ends one feud & begins another. While the U.S Champion (The Big Show) was put over fairly well. Cena continues the huge (& too soon) face push. I would have much preferred if he turned on Benoit at the end, but it appears a U.S title run is on it's way. Definitely too short at only 14 minutes, but as the opener it had to be as fast-paced as possible. Efficiency was high here, as it was entertaining & paved the way for future storylines in that time. Good stuff. Match Rating...8

MOLLY HOLLY defeated LITA to Retain the Women's Title: Fairly well put together 6 minute bout which saw Molly retain following a semi-clean pinfall. Yes, the 2 different styles did clash a little, but that fact was occasionally used quite well throughout the match. Plus, Molly has always been good at adapting to her opponents. Match Rating...6

KANE defeated SHANE McMAHON in an Ambulance Match: Ok (when taken individually) ending to a sometimes mind-boggling feud. Definitely nothing special, but there were enough good spots & enough of a frenetic pace for most of it's 13 minute duration. Production goofs hurt this match badly, as 2 cameramen missed Kane landing on his head at the beginning of the bout, and then the camera blacked out twice backstage. That's very un-WWE-like!!! In fact, the whole trip backstage, although logical, was a waste of time. There could have been more innovative hardcore action taking place, but the match didn't really deserve too much more time than it got. Passable. Match Rating...5

MARK CUBAN SEGMENT: This gets included in the 'PPV Rating' because it took up enough time to warrant it (It lasted longer than the Molly vs Lita match). There were so many things wrong with this. Firstly, it took the Tajiri vs Noble match off the card. Secondly, why did Bischoff & Orton have to be put over, considering what would happen later on? And of course my biggest gripe (being an Australian); How many people throughout the world (that's what the first 'W' in WWE stands for, right!?!?!?) know who Cuban is. I do, only because my team (The Spurs) had the privilege of ending his team's run last year. But otherwise, he could have been a bum off the street. Fair enough if Tim Duncan or Dirk No-whatshisname was involved, but Mark Who!?!?!? Having said all that, the segment was put together rather nicely & definitely had the hometown crowd going off their nut. A tough one to rank because it was ok, but made no sense. I just can't pass it though. Segment Rating...4

THE BASHAM BROTHERS defeated LOS GUERREROS to Retain the WWE Tag-Team Championships: This was a very good tag-team bout. Considering this match & the ppv opener, I'm starting to think that there is more merit in keeping bouts shorter when they are as frenetically paced as this 8 minute match. Plus, the WWE can't push their luck with rookies & have to protect them to some extent. There was some excellent double-team maneuvers by both teams here, while the byplay involving Shaniqua was also quite entertaining. Sure, Los Guerreros stood out as the fine team they are, but The Bashams more than played their part & looked good when they were asked to. Furthermore, the Eddie & Chavo angle didn't get involved too much concerning the match quality. Definitely the pleasant surprise of the night. Match Rating...8

TEAM BISCHOFF defeated TEAM ANGLE (Survivor: Randy Orton): If the WWE ever question having these traditional 5 on 5 Survivor Series matches again, all they have to do is watch this bout over & over again. A feud which I didn't really care for, quickly made me care about 1 minute into this enthralling match. For 27 minutes, we saw a great mixture of all sorts of wrestling; Fast-paced, mat, tag-team & even sheer brutality. Well booked with the exception of Booker T's & RVD's early exits. One question that also has to be posed after this bout; After all that has happened to him, is HBK still in the top 5 workers in the company...??? The after-match went on a little too long, but I suppose it did put over the stipulation well. Don't ask me what happens to Austin now!!! Match of the night. Match Rating...9

VINCE McMAHON defeated THE UNDERTAKER in a Buried Alive Match: Why wasn't this the main event!?!?!? Definitely the quickest blade-job I have ever seen. And boy, what a blade-job!!! Vince leaking that much blood couldn't have been healthy, especially when he got near the dirt!! Anyway, this was sheer brutality & a huge squash from the opening bell, as Vince basically got no offense in. Those who read my column would have expected the Kane interference & the Vince win. Pretty ordinary as a wrestling bout & it didn't really deliver anything special except for the blade-job & Kane's appearance (both of which were partially expected). While the entertainment value could have been better, it was still sufficient. Again, it was well-timed (only lasting 12 minutes) & had both the live crowd & me involved in the action. Yes, I'm giving an extra rating point for Vince's bleeding. Match Rating...6

BILL GOLDBERG defeated TRIPLE H to Retain the World HeavyWeight Title: The fact that only one face had won to this stage & that this was made the main event of the night, basically told me that Goldberg was going to retain here. But the fact that he did it so cleanly was the surprise. Overbooked, but it had to be, with both wrestlers not 100% fit. Thank God they didn't continue with the psychological ankle business!!! The way the match was booked tends to suggest that Goldberg will now be booked as the unstoppable force he was in WCW. Is it a couple of months too late!?!?!? Again, well timed at approximately 13 minutes, this was decently paced for the most part. As per usual, Flair's histrionics helped. Match Rating...6

PPV RATING (52/80) = 65

Looking at the key, I have given Survivor Series a 'B' grade & have said that it was a 'Good event that was worth the money'. Right on, if I do say so myself. I have rated this pay-per-view equal second for the year with the Royal Rumble (only behind WrestleMania 19). Scrapping the Mark Cuban segment for a crusierweight match would have almost guaranteed a better rating, but I suppose we must see our sports-entertainment, mustn't we!?!?!? But let's not hark on the few negatives, as there were far too many positives at this event. Three really good matches, plus most matches being very cleverly, as well as logically, booked, paced & timed. Furthermore, the two 5 on 5 matches prove that they must be annual events. Both were very entertaining (despite being so much different) & resulted in the motivation for many key angles in the upcoming months. And for the icing on the cake, we even had some inter-promotional hints thrown in there to fuel some fan conjecture. Good stuff indeed!!! Well done WWE.",1114732800,,7795,4.711453744493392

1891491,5,B00009W0UL,"This PPV is probably the best of the year 2003. Ill go through all the matches:

1. Team Angle def. Team Lesnar - Nice 14 minute battle. A little abrupt beginning but the match got better as it went. Rating: 9.5/10

2. Molly def. Lita to retain her Women's title - ok match considering its a women's match. Rating: 7/10

3. Kane def. Shane in the 'Final Encounter' Ambulance match - This match was SO brutal. Plenty of good spots in this match, with Shane hitting a Van Terminator from the top of the ambulance, the announcers table goes, and the ambulance takes some damage as well!! even goes backstage. had it all. Rating: 10/10

4. Bashams def. Guerreros to retain the tag team titles - Pretty good tag team match. Not much I can say about this match but some good spots. Rating: 7.5/10

5. Team Bischoff def. Team Austin to retire Austin - Stipulations: If Austin's team wins, he can raise hell anytime he wants to on RAW; if Bischoff's team wins, Austin is gone from RAW - SPECTACULAR 27 minute classic survivor series match. All eliminations were timed perfectly, very good spots, etc. Rating: 10/10

6. Vince McMahon def. Undertaker in a Buried Alive match - another very brutal match. This is a walk in the park for Undertaker, as he uses shovels, steps to break Vince's ankle, announcers table, etc. With Taker almost burying a very helpless Vince alive, something happens that you will NEVER forget. Buy this video to find out. Rating: 9/10 (gave it a 9/10 for being a bit too short, but the brutality made up for it a bit)

7. Goldberg def. Triple H to retain his World Heavyweight Championship - A very good main event that features all of Evolution coming to the ring to help HHH, but they get KO'ed with the sledgehammer. Good match that turned into a little brawl with brass knucks (if i remember right), the sledgehammer, and the steel steps. Rating: 9.5/10

All in all, a very good (and i mean very good) PPV. This is going to be remembered for 3 careers supposedly being over without looking ahead (Shane, Taker and Austin). This is a MUST buy for anyone that likes hardcore wrestling, technical wrestling (with Benoit, Jericho, Christian, etc). Also, at the end of the RAW Survivor Series match, Austin gives a VERY good and sad promo about his career being over. Buy this!!",1112745600,,2294,4.578048780487805

4th Match:WWE Tag Team Championship Match,Basham Brothers w/Shaniqa(c)vs Los Guerreros:a good tag match between each teams,the bashams do the switchy thing,shaniqa uses her man like strength to bodyslam eddie while the refs bein distracted,then at the end chavo tornado DDTs doug and catches eddie by accident and grabs chavos tites for the at the end.

6th Match:Buried Alive Match,Undertaker vs Mr. Mcmahon:taker had one of the most dominating matches of his career,the WWE has always beleived don't cross the boss but now we know don't cross the deadman as mcmahon was in a massive bloodbath and he must have to have grapefruit tablets every day from now on after this assualt by the deadman he broke his leg, hit mcmahon with a steel shovel, choked him with TV wires, and this has a great ending with kane im tellin don't miss out on this match.

hell of a match 10/10

7th Match:World Heavyweight Championship Match,Goldberg(c)vs Triple H:an amazing match,goldberg was crippled on his leg and still took evolution with a sledgehammer when the ref was out,he was typically goldberg about to use the sledgehammer on triple h but instead used the sledgehammer like spear and finished triple h off with a jackhammer pin,ill ask you somethin do you beleive the HYPE!!!!

Maybe the second greatest classic SS match of all time.  HBK's puts on another stellar performance.  A lot of drama and chaotic action.  Great match.

One of the rarest gimmick matches in the WWE.  Perfect storyline, perfect setting and just a good squash match.  Vince bleeds a lot!  Crazy finish too!

1891497,4,B00009W0UL,"This is Mudd.  I can't figure out why Goldberg vs. Triple H was the Main Event.  I believe that Taker vs. Vince should have been because of the great ending.

Team Lesnar (Brock Lesnar, Big Show, Matt Morgan, Nathan Jones & A-Train vs. Team Angle (Kurt Angle, John Cena, Chris Benoit, Bradshaw & Hardcore Holly) in a Classic Survivor Series Elimination Match.  This was a decent opening match.  I think it could have been better but what can you do.  Cena wins it for his team when he hits Show with an F-U. (7/10)

Molly Holly vs. Lita for the Women's Title.  This match wasn't that good at all and I decided that it is not worth people's time to watch but if you do only watch the end when Molly unties the bottom turnbuckle and Lita hits her head and then Molly pins her. (4.5/10)

Shane McMahon vs. Kane in an Ambulance Match.  I really enjoyed this match and I thought it was gonna be bad but it was awesome and Kane picks up the win and he's not done for the night. (8/10)

Basham Brothers vs. Los Guerreros for the WWE Tag Titles.  This match was very slow and boring at the beginning and the Basham just stink and that doesn't help much but it gets better and it still wasn't that good.  The Bashams retain their gold. (5.5/10)

Team Austin (Shawn Michaels, Booker T, Dudley Boyz & Rob Van Dam) vs. Team Bischoff (Randy Orton, Chris Jericho, Christian, Mark Henry & Scott Steiner) in a Classic Survivor Series Elimination Match.  I thought this was a great match but it is not a greatest match ever candidate.  Team Bischoff wins when Batista comes down and Powerbombs Shawn Michaels and Orton covers Michaels for the win. (9/10)

Undertaker vs. Mr. McMahon in a Buried Alive Match.  Was a great match and I thought Vince might actually die in this match not just from getting Buried Alive but the beating he took and when Taker is about to bury Vince, Kane comes and blows Taker up and throws him in the hole and buries him alive and this should have been the Main Event. (8/10)

Goldberg vs. Triple H for the World Title.  Was a intersting match and it showed how dominating Goldberg is by taking out all of Evolution and retaining his belt. (8/10)

Bad opener,Decent match. I was really looking forward to this match and it didn't dissapoint...Much...Some fast Eliminations,Holly,''JBL'' & A-train,Then that's where the action heats up,Lesnar taps out!! ((Yeah you heard me.)) He taps out,Then we get to see Benoit & Cena against...THE BIG SHOW! John gives big show a ***SPOILER WARNING*** FU at the end! Overall,a Decent match. 7/10.

2. Kane Vs. Shane McMahon,The Final Encounter Ambulance match.

Not 1 wrestling move was used in this match,well,Maybe a Tornado DDT but that's it. It's an all-out Brawl Backstage where Shane even Hits Kane With an SUV O_O; The best part would probably Be Shane giving Kane a Van-Daminator off the Ambulance and into a Trash can in Kanes face,Not better than they're Unforgiven match but still good,Some people would probably buy this DVD for this match. 8/10.

3. WWE Tag Titles,Los' Guererro's Vs. The Basham's.

Are you kidding me...? They could of atleast added 'Batista Vs. Matt Hardy' instead of this crap!

1. John Cena, Chris Benoit, Kurt Angle, Hardcore Holly, & Bradshaw vs. Brock Lesnar, Big Show, A-Train, Matt Morgan, & Nathan Jones (Elimination Match)

Great way to kick off the show.  I did not expect this to be the opening match, but good thing it was.  Team Angle worked great together.  This match marked the return of Hardcore Holly to in ring action.  This match also helped start the rise of Chris Benoit.  Good match.  (8.5/10)

2. Lita vs. Molly Holly (Women's Championship)

Women's match.  Who cares?  (2/10)

3. Shane McMahon vs. Kane (Ambulance Match)

Good match.  It marked the end to these two's fued.  Pretty sick spot when Shane jumps off the top of the ambulance and gives Kane the Van Daminator.  Great door shot by Kane on Shane.  Different match, but very good.  This has been the last time we have seen Shane in the WWE.  (8/1)

4. Los Guerrero's vs. Basham Brothers (WWE Tag Title)

Not a very good match.  It was kind of thrown together at the last second.  I think it was put in just to further the fued between Eddie and Chavo.  (6/10)

5. Booker T, Rob Van Dam, Shawn Michaels, The Dudley's vs. Scott Steiner, Randy Orton, Mark Henry, Christian, & Chris Jerico (Elimnation Match/If Booker T's team wins Bischoff leaves RAW, if Steiner's team wins Austin leaves RAW)

Amazing match.  One of the top ten matches of the year in my opinon.  It really picks up when Shawn Michaels gets in.  He carries the match on his shoulders.  Amazing performance.  Still a good effort by all men.  Michaels bleeds like crazy in the match.  Great match.  (9.5/10)

6. Undertaker vs. Vince McMahon (Buried Alive Match)

Undertaker puts a whupping on Vince.  Amazing shovel shot taken by Vince.  Very surprising ending.  Kane makes an appearance.  This has been Vince's last match to date in the WWE.  (8.5/10)

7. Triple H vs. Goldberg (World Heavyweight Title)

Decent match.  It was much better than their match at Unforgiven, but still not the best.  They would go on to wrestle a pretty good match on RAW a few weeks later.  Good ending to the match.  (7.5/10)

I would definately pick up this DVD, especially for the two Eliminatio matches.  The other matches were pretty good as well.

Benoit makes Lesnar tapp out for the second time in his career. And John Cena gives the FU to Big Show. A good match for Smackdown to begin with. 8/10

Not that both matches were bad, they were both entertaining, but I was expecting a fantastic match since it was the final encounter. Still a good match, with Trash cans, TV monitors, announce tables, and even the ambulance were used in this match, the crowd was really into this one. This match was a little too short also, but it was still entertaining. 8.5/10

The Guerreroes vs. The Basham Brothers: This would be the last ppv where the Guerreroes would be on the same team, and I think they should get back together. This match also sucked by the way. The Basham Brothers are so stupid, they pretend to switch because they look so much alike, puh-lease, don't make me laugh. Do yourself a favor and skip this match. 6.5/10

Austin's Team vs. Bischoff's Team Eliminaion Match: Match of the night. You could feel the electricity before, and during this match. Shawn gives a performance of a lifetime when he is left against Jericho, Christian, and Randy Orton. The ending was the most shocking one to a ppv in 2003. Stone Cold's Speech was good at the end and when Coach comes out, acting like the Jacka** that he is, he gets beat up. Stone Cold comes back in a month anyway, so it didn't matter. 10/10

Undertaker vs. Mr. McMahon - Buried Alive Match: This was too short but also had a very big surprise at the end when Kane appeared and buried the Undertaker alive, which then set up their match at Wrestlmania 20. Mr. McMahon bled like a river was flowing down his head. 7.5/10

Goldberg vs. Triple H: I totally thought Triple H would win but Goldberg proves once again why he is the man, and kicks Evolution's candya**es at the end with the sledghammer. Payback for what happened at Summerslam. A good title match. 8.5/10

This was a good match and contained some of the biggest surprises at the end of some matches ever. A definate must have.",1093219200,,2744,4.463073852295409

The Survivor Series 2003 PPV was definitely one of the greatest PPV's of 2003. It's not saying much of course, but it was one hell of a PPV. It doesn't topple over WrestleMania XIX in wrestling skill, but if you had seen it live it would have definitely been more suspenseful because much more was on the line: Austin's career, Vince or Taker's life, World Heavyweight Title and the outcome of the Ambulance match. Doesn't seem great on paper really, but the DVD should keep you entertained for a long time to come.

1. Team Angle (Kurt Angle, Chris Benoit, John Cena, Hardcore Holly & Bradshaw) vs. Team Lesnar (Brock Lesnar, Big Show, A-Train, Matt Morgan & Nathan Jones) in a classic Survivor Series elimination tag-match:

This match didn't have much of a storyline going for it, but here it is: For some reason GM Paul Heyman decided to have a classic SS match to take place at The Series. It had to be Kurt picking members for his team vs. Brock Lesnar's chosen teammates. John Cena had become a babyface just after No Mercy and had not goten along with Benoit. Brock had Paul Heyman to aid him to produce the heaviest team in Survivor history. The match had nothing on the line at all. To not ruin part of the match, I'll just say that 3 unimportant wrestlers get eliminated very, very hastily (And thank god). The match doesn't run for too long, but it is very solid action. Kurt doesn't get much wrestling time in the match, which was expected at the time. For an opening match, it's great. For what action it offers...

***

2. Women's Title Match- Lita vs. Molly

Yeah yeah yeah...

*1/2

3. Shane McMahon vs. Kane- Ambulance Match

The Kane vs. Shane saga continues from their clash at Unforgiven 2 months earlier. The feud started when Kane's mask came off and he tombstoned Shane's mother, Linda. At Unforgiven, it was a last man standing match, where Shane had taken a dive off of the stage (very high) and had lost the match. Then, an Ambulance match was declared for the Survivor Series to end the feud once and for all.

The start of the match was decent, with some stupid bits in it. You'll think to yourself, 'why does Kane get to get up from moves that would normally KO a normal opponent?', but nonetheless... eventually, the war heads to the back, where Kane almost gets beat. The action, again, decent. Then, the fight ensues on the entrance path, where they fight around the Ambulance. One big high-flying risk by Shane was amzing, which saves the match from being a little stiff. Overall, it's solid hardcore action.

***1/2

4. WWE Tag Team Championship match- Los Guerreros vs. Basham Brothers

This match is a filler match, and sets up Eddie and Chavo's feud which leads up to the Royal Rumble. The match itself is decent, but ends a bit stupidly which will leave you moaning.

**

5. Austin's Career vs. Bischoff's Career- Team Austin (Dudleyz, Booker T, RVD & Shawn Michaels) vs. Team Bischoff (Randy Orton, Chris Jericho, Christian, Mark Henry & Scott Steiner) in a classic Survivor Series elimination tag-match:

The match came about when Austin was not allowed to attack anyone without being physically provoked. Bischoff and Austin had been feuding as co-general managers since May, and even though Austin's wrestling career was over, his on-screen persona still existed. Bischoff had declared that a team that Bischoff assembled could defeat a team that Austin assembled, and that whoever's team lost would have to leave forever, and resign as a co-GM. Austin accepted, and the match would take place at the Series. The first part of the match is quite stiff, with some usual tag-match action, but eventually ran smoothly. The stakes were so high, that seeing this live would have been so much more greater than it already is, but that fact is that some of the earlier parts of the match were average. Eventually, a bloody battle occurred with the remaining competitors, and if it was seen live, the tension would have been out of this world. Unfortunately, if you know the outcome, it won't be that great, but I'm telling you, the last efforts that were put in the match to keep the fans entertained were just too great to be ignored. All in all, this match definitely deserves...

****

6. Buried Alive Match- Undertaker vs. Vince McMahon.

The match was assigned when Paul Heyman had accidentally given authority to the Deadman, so that he could choose a match at Survivor Series. A month earlier, Vince had interfered in Taker's match, and Taker wanted to punish Vince in a Buried Alive Match. Vince had said some violent things about Undertaker, so the bad blood rose to an all-new high.

To keep it short, this match is indeed entertaining, but a real squash match, as you would expect. Vince starts bleeding profusely on the first punch, and is basically mutilated throughout the remainder of the match. There isn't much real wrestling invloved, and is a set-up for a certain match at WrestleMania XX. This match can only deserve...

**1/2

7. World Heavyweight Title Match- Goldberg vs. Triple H

This match occurred when HHH had put a $100,000 bounty on Goldberg's head. Batista collected the bounty by injuring Goldberg's shin or ankle. So, a match was made at the Series, obviously, for these two men to wrestle for the Title, which was held by Goldberg.

Let me just tell you something- HHH can only wrestle a real good match when he is involved with another wrestler with a lot of talent; and Goldie just does not have enough talent OR charisma to carry Trips to an above *** match. Big power moves mixed with low ring psychology and low charisma isn't truly good enough to be a high-carder, so Goldberg really shouldn't have had the belt, and I don't care what any mainstream wrestling fans say about it. The match is basically Goldberg getting the upper hand early on, and then Trips capitalizing on Goldberg's ankle injury, with Ric Flair helping Triple H by beating on Goldberg when the ref isn't looking. The match is mediocre, but still is a fine way to top off an otherwise great PPV.

**1/2

Also, on the DVD, there is a fairly good Cruiserweight Title match involving the champ, Tajiri, and his opponent the then-babyface Jamie Noble. It's definitely Sunday Night Heat quality, and in all respects to the cruiser devision it should have been included AT the PPV instead of on Spike TV or whatever it's on before the event actually starts. This match gets a rating of **1/2, which is good for a match on SNH, which would embarass the likes of Bill Goldberg's/HHH's efforts.

The overall DVD extras section is decent, as you get to see the Survivor Series ad, the making of it, Survivor Series history, the extra match, Austin/Michaels aftermath and the usual pre-match and post-match interviews.

Overall, some matches are lacklustre, particularly the Goldberg/HHH match, but the rest of the event makes this DVD definitely worth a purchase. This DVD and this PPV put together deserves a rating of ****, as the mainevent just brings the event down by half a star.",1092355200,4,7358,4.694401244167962

final encounter ambulance match  shane vs. kane

awsome, awsome match.  went backstage, lost a couple cameras.  shane used a kindo stick a lot, and the ran kane into a phone booth with an SUV.  also drove a trash can into kanes face from the top of the ambulance.  however kane fought back and eventually tombstoned shane on the concrete to win

Buried alive match.  undertkaer vs. vince

very brutal and bloody.  vince busted open very early on and from then on it was undertakers match.  as taker was about to go the bulldozer to win, there was an explosion of fire, sending tkaer back to the grave, where kane came out and had vince win the match.  too bad.

Team Angle vs Team Lesnar-This was an okay elimination survivor series match but not as good as the Raw one later on in the night. The first few eliminations were so sudden and in no time it was down to 2 on 2. Team Angle wins thanks to John Cena and his chain. Time-12 mins 7/10
Molly Holly vs Lita-Exellent womans match. It was slightly longer than normal woman matches and there was some great moves from Lita. Molly retains her title. Time-6 mins 6/10
Ambulance match-Kane vs Shane-Brutal match from the start with Shane taking Kane over the top rope. The match was contested on the outside not in the ring which made it more interesting. Shane as usual entertained with several risks I loved it when Shane jumped off the ambulance and kicked the can in Kanes face. Kane wins the final encounter by tombstoning Shane on the concrete. Awsome match up!!! Time-12 minutes 9/10
Los Guerros vs Bashams-Not a good tag team match. Its what I expected The Bashams are plain and boring and Los guerros were not much better. Worst match of the PPV by far fast foward this match. Time-7 mins of crap  4/10
Team Austin vs Team Biscoff-In my view the best match of the night. Come on it was 27 minutes long and the eliminations were well timed not like the Smackdown one. All 10 superstars were great and did some exellent wrestling moves. HBK was brave but got beaten thanks to Orton and Batista. Austin loses his job but go's out on a good note ,Stunning coach Time-27 mins 10/10
Undertaker vs Mr McMahon-Brutal match Undertaker was beating up McMahon for most of the match. McMahon didn't throw a punch before Undertaker carried him to the grave yard. Shocking end with Kane,Takers brother burrying the deadman after an explosion in the truck. The match was a bit disappointing because it was boring at times and was too short. The huge lead up was not worth it. Time-10 mins 7/10
Goldberg vs Triple H-Pretty good match concidering Goldberg was 1 legged and Triple H was off his game. It was a physicaly intense battle between two huge athletes with Goldberg winning by eliminating Evolution with a sledge hammer and pinning the Game with The Jackhammer. Time-12 mins 8/10

I don't know if I'd go that far but it was a solid ppv nevertheless.  I've always been a fan of Survior Series PPVs a great deal because it's one of the big four for WWE and it usually resolves a lot of their big storylines going on and starts new ones going into the new year.  2003 doesn't disappoint in that area.

--TEAM AUSTIN vs. TEAM BISCHOFF: Best match of the night, mostly because the stipulations were interesting and because HBK was a star in that match (but then again, when isn't he a star in his own matches?).  Boiled down to HBK vs. Christian, Y2J, and Orton and HBK roughed them all up while bleeding all over the place until it came down to him and Orton.  Batista interferes, HBK loses, Austin loses job.  Very well done match, although it's pretty obvious Austin is coming back soon so his little goodbye speech at the end, while nicely done, was not all that dramatic and emotional.  Still a great four-star match.
--TEAM ANGLE vs. TEAM LESNAR: It wasn't the wrestling so much that made this good, how can you say that when you got a now-departed Nathan Jones, unproven Matt Morgan, and the one-move wonder Bradshaw working in the ring together?  At least they had Angle, Cena, Lesnar, and Benoit to save us.  No, it was more the two things that stood out in this match that let people know who's moving up in the world.  Benoit making Lesnar tap out showed us they might actually consider giving his well-deserved push and Cena FUing the Big Show just boggled my mind.  Just having them win as sole survivors as well (with NO team captains) made it seem strange but gave it a sense of unpredictability, somewhat lacking in WWE these days.
--BURIED ALIVE MATCH: Short and painless, although I can't say the same for Vinnie Mac.  Man did he lose blood, YUCK!!!  Kane finished the job for Vince and buries Taker, which will finally give us the Dead Man we really want to see come 2004!
--HHH LOSES TWO PPVS IN A ROW!!:  I know he eventually got the belt back at Armageddon, but it was nice to see how much WWE put its faith in a fresh champion for the time they gave it to Goldberg.  Even though I'm not Goldberg's biggest fan, he's improved his skills quite a bit and learned the WWE pace pretty good.  And as stated, HHH did not come through with a title win two ppvs in a row!  What's the world coming to???
THE BAD:
--MARK CUBAN FAVORED OVER NOBLE/TAJIRI MATCH: Can someone tell me why?  The idea is to get wrestlers over on ppv, not basketball owners.  They hype this match good on SD what with Nidia being blinded by Tajiri's mist and it's pushed down to Heat so Cuban can get RKOed by Orton.  How dumb are these people?
--SHANE/KANE AMBULANCE MATCH: The match wasn't bad, I just expected a little more what with the things they did to each other week after week as well as their unforgiven match.  Ambulance matches are suppose to tell you someone's going to get bloody and use insane methods of incapacitating you.  Oh well, like I said, not a bad match, just not the conclusion I was looking for in this long dragging feud.
--LITA/HOLLY MATCH: I didn't want to hate this match, I like the way the women's wrestling has improved lately.  I just feel bad for the fact that Lita has not been the same since her neck broke and got fused.  She just seemed sluggish out there.  Molly did her best but this match just was too sloppy for me.
OVERALL:I enjoyed it overall.  The two survivor series matches did good for me and the buried alive match was kept short but very brutal.  The storylines concluded well too and started some new fresh feuds to start going into their road to WMXX.  A couple of sluggish matches and that irritating Cuban/Bischoff segment kept it from making five stars.  Still a worthy buy for the dedicated wrestling fan.",1072396800,,3904,4.419580419580419

Eddie Gurrero's match was much more better than in 2000.
There was more main events than the last one.

GREAT MATCH!!!!!!! it was great seeing Brock tap out again and seeing John Cena FU the Bigshow for the win. I'd give this match a 9/10  order of elimination:
- HardcoreHolly by DQ
-A-train by pin
-Bradshaw by pin
-Matt Morgan by pin
-Nathan Jones taped out
-Kurt Angle by pin
-Brock Lesnar TAPED OUT!!
-Bigshow by pin
Lita v.s Molly Holly
This was an ok match. I thought Lita should of won the match. It was a good storyline though. Lita did good untl Molly took her out by slamming her face into undun turnbuckle. It gets a 5/10

ambulance match: kane v.s shane
I thought this was one of the best matches of the night. Shane did evreything to try to stop kane but nothing could stop kane.(cause kane is the best wrestler)shane beat the s*** out of kane at the beginning but kane's tombstone did the job and sent shane to the hospital.this match deserves a 9/10
Guerros vs Bashams Brothers
I thought this match sucked. It was smackdown material. The Guerros would of won it if those damn bashams didn't switch. This deserves a poor 4/10
Team Austin vs Team Bichoff
Exellent match. Austin kicked Bichoff's a**. and Shawn Micheals put up a hell of a fight. he was covered with blood after a chair shot and being swung into the steel ringpost. He pinned Christean and Chris Jericho when it was a 3on1. But when that nimrod Batista came and powerbombed Micheals did the job wich means Austins FIRED!!!

Buried Alive: Undertaker vs vince
Taker split open vince with the first punch. Ihate Vince so I was glad he got beatup. Taker hit the steel steps together with Vinces ankle in the middle. It was great when Taker hit him with the shovel. Vince bled alot this match so it was great. But to end the match kane interfiered so vince won. it gets a 10/10

Goldberg vs HHH
it was a good match besides goldberg getting his but kicked alot of the match. but he took on all of eveolution with the sledgehammer and jackhammered tripleH for the win. I think Goldberg should of destroyed the game in this match. since goldberg won it got a 9/10",1070409600,,2057,4.4338624338624335
1891524,3,B00009W0UL,"WWE Survivor Series 2003 was a good PPV. Despite all the hype going into this wrestling event, there's wasn't anything too special about it. Sure, it was a heck of a show, but compared to last years Survivor Series, it just doesn't seem that great. There were plenty of matches that could've been much better.
Team Lesnar vs. Team Angle - this match was really good. It was action-packed and very athletic, to say the least. ***1/2
Molly Holly vs. Lita - while not a bad women's match, not a good one either. Both women put forth a fair amount of effort but not enough to make this one a gem. **
Ambulance match: Kane vs. Shane McMahon - after watching their brutal Last Man Standing match at Unforgiven, I was expecting this one to be even better. Unfortunately, it wasn't exactly as good as their first one. Sure, it was indeed brutal and both men took some very ugly bumps, but it wasn't enough to make this match a true classic. The match wasn't even 15 minutes long. However, it still managed to hold my interest. **1/2
Los Guerreros vs. The Basham Brothers - this match was pretty cool. The athletisicm was good, and the offense was amazing. Too bad it couldn't have been a little bit longer. ***1/2
Team Austin vs. Team Bischoff - this was easily the best match on the card. Shawn Michaels gets busted open and still continues to fight his heart out. This was a very exciting match with a lot of effort from both teams. However, the ending is very shocking. ****
Buried Alive match: The Undertaker vs. Mr. McMahon - this wasn't much of a match, but it sure was very interesting. Vince McMahon recieves one of the nastiest beatings of his life by the Undertaker, and loses a ton of blood in the process. Taker' even crashes a solid steel shovel over McMahon's head! The ending was somewhat disappointing though, and plus, the match was too d@mn short! I still give this match a lot of credit, especially Vince for the nasty beating he took from the Undertaker. ***
Goldberg vs. Triple H - watch Goldberg teach Triple H and team Evolution yet another lesson. Their match as Unforgiven was better, but this one still delivered. **1/4",1069718400,,2137,4.538860103626943
1891525,4,B00009W0UL,"Team Lesnar Vs. Team Angle;Very good opener for such a PPV. Man i only wished if Hardcore Holly would kick Brock Lesnar's .... I still can't believe that John Cena gave an ... to the Big Show. 9/10
Molly vs. Lita:A decent match. Both women put up a good fight. Though, it shouldn't have been after Team Angle vs. team Lesnar. 6.5/10
Kane vs. Shane McMahon(Ambulance Match):A very good match. I think it was as good as their Last Man Standing match at Unforgiven. It had very cool spots for example when Shane dropkicked a trash can intom Kane's head. 8.5/10
Los Guerreros vs. Basham Brothers:Not a bad match. I only wished if the Bashams wouldn't have won this match. The thing that amused me the most in this match was when Eddie Guerrero knocked down that ... Shaniqua whit his trademark Frog Splash.
 7/10.
Undertaker vs. Vince McMahon:(Buried Alive Match) An incredible match. Undertaker did everything he could to bury Vince McMahon Alive. He busted Vince McMahon wide open. He knocked him down by cracking his head with a shovel. If Only, only Kane didn't interfered, i would rate it as the best matchup on the card. 9.5/10.
Goldberg vs. Triple H(World HeavyWeight Championship Match): Entertaining match. Man, Goldberg realy knows how to manhandle all members of Evolution at one time. Goldberg finishes HHH with the jackhammer. I think that HHH sucks and Goldberg rules. 8/10.
Team Austin vs. Team Bischoff(If Team Austin loses Stone Cold will leave the WWE. If team Bischoff loses Austin can get his hands on any superstar on RAW). It was simply the best match of the night. I'm sos sad that Austin quit the WWE just like that. All because that legend killer Randy Orton. it was one history making. HBK put on a classic performance by eliminating Christian and Chris Jericho. In my view it is one of the top matches of 2003. 1000/10!!

1891527,4,B00009W0UL,"In weeks prior to the show, I wondered if it was actually gonna be good.  I mean the WWE this year has hyped up many matches and ppvs this year, and they have failed to deliver on many occasions.  Luckily, we got a nice show this time around.  Here's a run-down of the card and my opinion on them
1.  Team Angle(Angle, Benoit, Cena, Bradshaw, and Holly) vs Team Lesnar(Brock, A-Train, Jones, Morgan and Big Show)
An unlikely group of team angle vs The biggest tag team ever assembled in team lesnar which weights at a total of 1800 lbs.
Holly made his return in over a year and Cena had just turned face, Matt Morgan debuts, Nathan Jones turned heel.
 Order of Elimantions:
 - Hardcore Holly got DQ when he attacked lesnar and manhandled a referee who tried to break up the fight in :30
 - Bradshaw delivered the clothsline from hell on A-Train in 1:05
 - Big Show chokeslammed Bradshaw in 1:25
 - Angle hit the angle slam on Matt Morgan in 9:42
 - Angle made Nathan Jones tap out to the ankle lock in 10:08
 - Brock f-5ed Angle in 10:20
 - Benoit became the 2nd person to make Brock tap in 12:28
 - Cena believe it or not gave the f-U to the big show in 13:53
 Survivors: Benoit and Cena
Very fast paced, good wrestling and great performances all around
2.  Lita vs Molly Holly
 Lita made her return at Unforgiven and became the #1 contender for the women's title in a fatal four way on Raw. Molly targeted on Lita's neck throughout the match, obvisously since Lita did have neck surgery.  Lita put on a good effort surviving the molly-go-round but got pinned when Molly took the turnbuckle pad off and rammed lita face into that turnbuckle.  Match lasted 6:49. It was decent.
3.  Shane vs Kane (Ambulence Match)
  The final encounter between these two came to a close in this match.  I didn't this match was as good as their last man standing match at Unforgiven but it wasn't bad.  Shane tried everything to win the match.  He delivered the elbow off the top rope on kane thru the spanish announcer's table, lured kane into the back and backed a truck into him, and placed the trashcan on kane and jumped on top of the ambulence truck and dropkick the trashcan into kane's face but Kane's strength was too much for the boy wonder as he thrown back and forth into the ambulence truck. The match ended with a tombstone on the outside of the ring which is similar to what happened to Linda.  Match wasn't as brutal as I was expecting but it was still good. Match time 13:34
4.  Gurreros vs Bashams Brothers
An okay match.  The Gurreros outperformed Bashams Bros. throughtout the match.  A good amt of interference from shanquia who ended up getting a frog splash from Eddy.  Chavo delivered a swinging ddt on one of the bashams but accidentally kicked Eddy when he did the move.  As chavo was checking up on Eddy the other basham bros rolled up chavo and hooked the tights to remain champs in time of 7:33
5.  Team Austin(HBK, Dudleys, RVD, and Booker T.) vs Team Bischoff(Steiner, Henry, Christian, Y2J and Randy Orton)
  You know the stipulation, if austin's team loses he's gone, if Austin's team wins Austin can back to raising hell and kicking some a--.  This was another good elimantion match which was filled with alot of chaos and interference from Austin, Bischoff, and Batista. HBK put on an all-star performance
  Order of elimantion:
- Booker T. gave Steiner the book end in 7:26
- Henry powerslammed Booker T. in 7:49
- Dudleys and RVD stacked on top of Henry for the pin at 10:04
- Orton RKO RVD in 12:04
- Jericho did a Reverse Bulldog on D'von in 13:47
- Christian hitted the unprettier on Bubba Ray in 16:50
- HBK used sweet chin music on christian in 20:27
- HBK countered the walls of jericho into a rollup in 23:54
- Orton pinned HBK after a batista powerbomb in 27:26
Sole Survivor: Randy ORTON
6. Undertaker vs Vince McMahon (Buried Alive)
 I don't if you even want to call this match.  McMahon got murdered in this one, as he was busted wide open with only 2 undertaker punches.  Taker whacked Vince in the face with a shovel, took vince over to the steps and the stairs to whack vince on the leg with them.  After a dissing out tons of punishment, Taker carries vince over to try and bury him.  Kane makes a surprise apperance and help Vince bury the Taker. Match Time: 11:59
7. HHH vs Goldberg
 Decent title match. Goldberg was able to dodge an attack from evolution and pinning the game with the jackhammer.  Match time:12:23
Good wrestling and well paced action and entertaining non-match segments.  Austin saying goodbye and beating up the Coach.  A confortation b/w Bischoff and the manager of Dallas Mavs.  Backstage encounters with goldberg and lesnar.
I strongly recommended buying this when it comes out.",1068940800,16,4737,4.494145199063232
1891528,5,B00009W0UL,"Here are some predictions of mine for what looks to be the best PPV of 2003:

Team Angle vs Team Lesnar - I think Benoit will pull an upset and pin the WWE Champion to win the match, and Lesnar And Benoit will start a great rivalry.
WWE Burried Alive Match
Undertaker vs Vince McMahon - I think in the end Stephanie will come back... But help Vince pick up the win. Then Taker will return as The Deadman and face Kane at WM XX.
WWE Classic Survivor Series Match
Team Bischoff vs Team Austin - I think Austin's team will win, and I have a gut feeling Jericho will turn on Bischoff's team and become a face again.

Molly Holly (c) vs Lita - Lita's got it won!

7993324,4,B00009W0UL,"2003 is typically remembered as a poor year for the WWE due in large to the misuse of Goldberg on RAW and Triple H's woeful stint as the Ric Flair type heel that cut a swathe through the top WCW stars the WWE bothered to keep around. Survivor Series 2003 was probably the 2nd or 3rd best event that year, and that's because it cut down on the bludgeoning sports entertainment and let the wrestlers tell good stories.

There's something for everyone on this show: fans of hardcore wrestling have a solid Ambulance Match between Kane and Shane McMahon, fans of fast paced ring action had the Smackdown elimination match, and fans of great storytelling had the RAW elimination match where Steve Austin's team of rebels took on Eric Bischoff's heels in a stunner of a match that delivered in every conceivable way.

There's also a bit of a hidden gem on this show with the WWE Tag Team Titles match with Eddie & Chavo Guerrero taking on the Basham Brothers. The match is short, yet features lots of chain wrestling and character development

If anything disappointed on the show, it was the double-main event that featured a bloody Buried Alive Match where Vince McMahon somehow defeated the Undertaker despite the butt-kicking of a lifetime and a World Title Match between Goldberg and Triple H. Neither match is terrible, but fail to capture the emotional high of the RAW Elimination Match.
