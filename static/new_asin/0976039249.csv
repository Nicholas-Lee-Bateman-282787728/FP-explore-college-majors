7794655,3,0976039249,I saw a film once on TV that was a great story-behind-the story. This wasn't it.  Some of this is just a slide show of stills with music.  You've got to be a extreme fan of Steve and his movie to enjoy this.,1384387200,,207,3.7906976744186047
7794656,1,0976039249,I was tremendiuosly letdown with this DVD.  It was mostly sound on slide with race car noise in the background.  Very little in the way of video.  No interviews on how the movie was made except some slight narration in the middle feature about the camera car.  I would not recommend this DVD to anyone,1358035200,,301,4.418181818181818
7794657,2,0976039249,"As much as I love the movie 'LeMans', and as much as I love the 1970 period and style of racing and cars, I cannot in good conscience recommend this DVD. It is made up of three shorts: 'LeMans: The 24 Hours - 1970' (11:09 minutes); 'LeMans: The Race, The Movie' (14:09 minutes); and 'LeMans: Behind The Scenes' (27:02 minutes). About two-thirds of the DVD is simply photographic stills, many of which are taken from the book ""A French Kiss With Death"".

Sadly, the best of the three featurettes is also the shortest: ""LeMans: The 24 Hours"". It at least includes some footage of the race, interspersed with footage from the movie and more stills. The last and longest featurette, ""Behind The Scenes"", includes photos with titles such as ""Steve sitting on the camera car"" and ""Steve checking another camera angle"". Much of this information seemed pretty self-evident. There is a lot of hokey background music playing throughout, too, and when there is a little bit of dialog (Steve McQueen talking in ""LeMans: The Race, The Movie""), it is so muffled that about 90% of it is unintelligible.

Throughout each featurette, I found myself looking at my watch multiple times.  Engrossing is one term that I would NOT use to describe this DVD. There are no interviews - none from drivers who were involved in either the race or the movie, and not one of any of the crew or cast. There is very little in terms of film outtakes from the movie (perhaps a total of 1 minute in the whole DVD). If you don't own the book 'French Kiss with Death', purchase it and forget about buying this DVD. It pains me to say, but I can almost guarantee that after you have watched this DVD once, you will never watch it again.",1341014400,5,1698,4.560655737704918
