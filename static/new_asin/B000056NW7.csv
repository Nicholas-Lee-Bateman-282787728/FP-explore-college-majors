1399271,3,B000056NW7,"Slow, repetitive, bland, uninteresting - I would use these words to discribe this film, but when you include Technicolor pcyhadelic LSD flip-outs where the ""tripee"" imagines the heads of men are watermelons and then promtly lops them off, we've got to be onto some kind of a winner!!!! This is the coolest LSD film ever made, bar maybe PSYCHED BY THE 4D WITCH, for the sheer fact that it could actually induce acid flashbacks, even for those who have never partaken of said substance.  However, I wouldn't like to be on any form of Lysergic whilst viewing this monstrosity!! Also, some rather excellent frugging is in evidence throughout, also in said glaring Technicolor, as well as some pretty hideous sex scenes. Oh, and then there's that annoying theme song!!!",983318400,9,764,4.922480620155039
7932484,2,B000056NW7,"For those unfamiliar with Something Weird Video, the company specializes in nearly forgotten public domain schlock exploitation films, primarily from the 1950s to 70s. The subject matter of these movies varies widely, but they can generally be classified in two categories: so-bad-they're good movies and just plain bad movies. ""Mantis in Lace"" is just plain bad.

""Mantis in Lace,"" made in 1968, is a relic from the days in which softcore porn movies paid at least lip service to the notion of actually having a plot, while still devoting the bulk of their running time to displaying relatively attractive nude women. In this case, the plot concerns a go-go dancer named Lila (Susan Stewart), who likes to take LSD and then hack her boyfriends to bits with a meat cleaver. As near as I can tell, she doesn't actually intend to kill them at first; instead, she takes them back to her ""love nest,"" which is an abandoned warehouse with a convenient mattress and more convenient hiding places for meat cleavers. However, she's deathly afraid of bananas, and whenever she takes LSD, she imagines a guy trying to attack her with a banana he's holding in his hand (the movie actually shows some fat bald guy in his underwear waving a banana). So, she panics and freaks out, and exit another boyfriend.

The movie (whose title in the opening credits is ""Lila,"" not ""Mantis jn Lace"") essentially consists of four scenes in which Lila seduces then kills guys, separated by lengthy filler sequences of topless go-go dancers at the club where Lila works and a completely extraneous sex scene involving the club owner and another dancer. These dance scenes are necessary because Stewart almost never appears nude in the movie, so a group of unbilled, less camera-shy actresses take up the slack.

""Mantis in Lace"" is a dreadfully inept movie. The script is ridiculous, filled with attempts at hip language (Lila says ""groovy"" a lot), and the acting is worse. None of the performers would have been likely to win a role in a high school drama production. The only interesting aspect of the movie is the psychedelic acid trip cinematography by a young Laszlo Kovacs (who made a number of these soft core porn films before getting his break in ""Easy Rider""). There are a couple of unintentionally funny moments (such as a shot of a cardboard box with a body in it, one arm sticking straight up in the air), but no actual jokes, and most of the language is downright cringeworthy.

Fortunately for viewers, the DVD does have some extra features that are more entertaining than ""Mantis"" itself. The best of these is a faux documentary featurette aimed at high school students showing the ""evils"" of LSD, as one student takes the drug and winds up dead while another is smart enough to know better. The featurette is narrated with such seriousness, and the acting of the ""students,"" who appear to be about 30 years old, is so wooden that it's often hilarious. There are far more laughs in the 20 minute featurette than the 90 minute movie.

To be blunt, how much a viewer likes ""Mantis"" will depend on his taste for multiple scenes of gyrating topless go-go dancers. I found these scenes to be somewhat boring after the first two or three minutes, and nothing in the rest of the movie was much more interesting, so I'm rating it two stars (primarily for the LSD featurette), but those who enjoy this type of vintage soft core entertainment will probably like it a bit better.",1411603200,2,3457,4.764607679465776
7932485,3,B000056NW7,"""Mantis in Lace"" can't seem to decide if it's a sexploitation flick, a psychedelic horror movie, or a straightforward police story, so it just bounces around between the three in a kind of rancid oil-and-water combination -- a harmless tale of the strip club life as visited by the straight-laced detectives could work, but the disturbing acid murder scenes upset both apple carts, making each thread seem out of place.  Then, oddly, we have a scene wherein the bartender/strip club owner lures an auditioning dancer back to his apartment for some ""if you want the job you'll do this"" sex, but it's full of smiles, lingering kisses and set to sincere, romantic music that suggests they're deeply in love.  (Creepier yet, the Bartender appears to be played by Bethel Buckalew, the film's Production Manager.)

Rock history buffs will appreciate some late 60s shots of  Sunset Boulevard (including the exterior of Gazzarri's and a marquee listing Procol Harum) as the detectives begrudgingly ""visit every gogo bar on the Strip,"" but unfortunately that's about it in terms of  L.A. period exteriors.  Meanwhile, the acid trips graciously become briefer as the film includes more  frequent nudity and the detectives start to hone in on the perpetrator.  Some pretty enjoyable clunky dialogue and acting as a real estate agent shows a potential client Lila's warehouse at night.  ""What on earth am I stepping in? What is this sticky stuff, do you know? It's looks like blood. All over the place.""  Later another of Lila's would-be victims flubs a line but they just keep rolling, barreling  toward the type of thud ending you'd expect but still feels like a rip-off for all you've endured to get there.

If you like low budget gore combined with a bombardment of cheap acid imagery and extended strip club scenes, have at it; there's plenty of all of that.  But to my mind it's an uneasy combination that ultimately leaves one feeling a bit dizzy and in need of some fresh air.

The Bonus Features

This disc includes outtakes longer than the film itself, the first of which is an alternate psychedelic murder sequence that is actually much more visually inspired than what was used.  It also ties together the threads of acid hallucination with flashbacks of the strip club, superimposed in negative, which would've helped unite the disparate elements.  (Not to mention the arch absurdity of a fat, shirtless, masked man carrying a bunch of bananas and a pile of cash.)  Though still gory, it is less brutal overall and more interesting; it would've been a better film had it been included.

The remaining outtakes are presented with a novel approach: lumped together in a continuous stream and paired with out-of-context snippets of dialogue, sound effects and music from the film.  It generates some interesting juxtapositions, like Lila brutally murdering her victims set to the upbeat music and  crowd of the strip club cheering her on.  It's a suitably psychedelic way to present what would have otherwise probably been a dull series of merely alternate takes, and plays out like an extended experimental art film of the period.  After awhile it becomes a meditation on filmmaking itself, with inclusion of multiple slated takes,  threading glitches, scrawled film leader, flashes of white as the reel runs out, and quick pans that include glimpses of the crew.  Unfortunately, whoever put it together eventually stops trying with the audio and merely repeats the lengthier sections of music, rain, club ambiance, and eerie drones, which become tiresome.

This would be more than enough for most DVDs, but there are still more bonus features, including 3 archival short subjects: ""LSD: Trip or Trap!"" (a typical antidrug school film), an excerpt from ""Alice Goes to Acidland"" (which blames drug problems on a ""known lesbian"" then basks in a trippy, lesbian-themed nude montage) and ""Girl in a Cage,"" a campy, highly dramatized, Charo-esque striptease.  Finally, there is a gallery of Harry Novak exploitation art accompanied by radio spots, and the Something Weird Trailer Park, which is just 3 trailers for other Something Weird offerings.  A generous package for the price, but probably best consumed in more than one viewing - and with an experienced guide present for safety.",1333584000,,4280,5.049786628733997
7932486,1,B000056NW7,"I know that there are those that like when someone like Something Weird Video digs up some old forgotten cult gem and re-releases it but, I'm sorry, this movie sucks by any standard. Yes. It is a sexploitation sleaze piece but it even sucks by those standards.

A topless dancer brings a club patron to her ""special place"" (an abandoned warehouse) for a little coochie coo. He gives her some acid which causes her to go bazonkers and smite the filthy sleazebag dope peddler. This scene repeats itself a few times while, meantime, two knucklehead detectives, who couldn't find Michael Jordan in a snowpile, try to solve the mystery of where all these body parts are coming from.

About the only thing worth watching are a couple of the non-star girls doing their dancing thing. They're gorgeous and pre-silicone curvy. Everything else here is pretty God-awful. OK. You don't have a budget. That's par for the course on these flicks, but much better movies have been made on similar budgets. The ""love"" scenes here go on forever. They are in no way erotic or titillating. Of course the acting is awful. The dialog is supposed to be what was ""hip"" for 1968. Maybe it was, but it's laughable now.

The holes in the plot are huge. Didn't victims two and three see the bloody meat cleaver on the floor in the puddles of blood? How about the bloody smear running down the wall? The two idiot detectives seemed to notice them right off. How is it that this young girl was able to dismember these guys, stuff them in cardboard boxes and tote them to some remote location? Jeezo Peezo, I'm a big guy and I couldn't do it.

The sound and the look of the ""freak out"" scenes are pretty sucky. The editor seemed to be getting help from his seeing eye dog and the camera guy probably did the best he could with what he had but it still sucked.

Sorry. Unless you want to see about 15 minutes of a couple of beautiful, curvy women dancing topless, this movie will be a waste of your time.",1289174400,,1972,4.481894150417827
7932487,3,B000056NW7,"3 stars for Mantis In Lace,4 for the rest of the disc. Lila! Get use to that tune,it'll probably stick with you forever. Every previous review has told all there is to know. I actually think the two cops are the best actors of the crew.

I watched it once,it took two attempts;got very bored and put it on pause. Watched it again and it grew on me. I'll have to be in a very strange mood to watch it again.

The extras are the good stuff. I think the cage girl is the original pole-dancer! The LSD film by the Inglewood cops is interesting,but the birth-defects pics ruined a very good..uh,mood.

My review is all over the place,but then again,so is this disc.",1181347200,,660,4.306451612903226
7932488,3,B000056NW7,"""Mantis in Lace"" asks the question: Can a movie have too much topless go go dancing? In the case of this late `60s sexploitation epic, the answer is a resounding yes! To be fair, ""Mantis in Lace"" was made before the cinematic barriers came crashing down in the 1970s, so I guess jiggling  mammaries were still considered pretty risqu. Yet I'm sure even the members of the raincoat crowd of 1968 had to be checking their watches halfway into this leaden mix of sex, LSD and murder.

As the go go dancer Lila (""Lila"" was this movie's alternate title), Susan Stewart has a vague English (maybe Dutch?) accent,  la Dolly Read from ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls,"" and an acting style akin to John Waters' late star Edith Massey. After dancing her set, she picks up a ""hippie"" (you can tell he's a hippie because he's wearing a dorky earring that resembles a homemade Christmas ornament) and takes him back to a warehouse owned by her father. They drop acid and have tepid sex on a mattress, while Lila sees all the swirling colors that signify all cinematic acid trips of this time period. But when she thinks she's being force-fed bananas (?) she freaks and stabs her faux-hippie one-night-stand in the back with a screwdriver, then hacks him to bits with a meat cleaver that happens to be handy. Then it's time for more topless go go dancing! The whole movie follows this pattern: Lila dances, picks up a man, does acid, freaks during sex and kills him. In between the go go dancing and LSD carnage are scenes of two ""Dragnet""-style cops investigating (poorly) the murders. There's also one ""casting couch"" scene, apropos of nothing, in which an aspiring stripper--who looks like Kate Mulgrew--has sex with a bar owner (the only scene to give a flash of female full-frontal nudity and a bare male backside). Through it all we repeatedly hear the theme song, ""Lila,"" so hypnotically awful you'll remember it long after you've forgotten the movie.

Despite its problems, ""Mantis in Lace"" does have its charm. The camera work by Lazslo Kovacs is excellent, giving this cheap movie a more polished look than it deserves. Pat Barrington has a small part as a belly-dancing stripper, and while she's not a much better actress than Stewart, she's certainly a more interesting one. The movie's concept is a pretty inspired mix for its time, if only director William Rotsler had used the premise to its fullest potential, starting with a real script. The Something Weird DVD release features an alternate ""LSD murder scene"" that's a lot more interesting than the one in the final film. There also are 100 minutes of outtakes, and while their inclusion seems like a good idea, I defy anyone to sit and watch these scenes--which, other than featuring a bit more blood and yet another go go dancer, differ little from what's in the final cut--without hitting fast forward. Rounding out the extras are an LSD scare film, a tedious LSD-themed nudie loop/morality tale, and a short featuring a crazed-looking stripper writhing about in a bamboo cage.",1092009600,6,3034,4.784351145038168
7932489,3,B000056NW7,"Mantis in Lace is a very mixed bag.  You would think that a sexploitation / mad-slasher movie combined with the LSD subculture of the 60's would be a great idea -- and it is.  But nearly half of this movie consists of extended scenes of strippers performing in the club or ""trying out"" on the casting couch.  One can't help but feel that they only had enough time and budget to shoot half a movie and needed to pad it to get to a feature length running time.
With that said, the scenes where Lila trips out on acid and kills her prey are outstanding.  Laszlo Kovacs was the cinematographer and it's easy to see that he would go on to shoot such classics as Easy Rider and Five Easy Pieces.  Susan Stewart is a remarkably bad actress who can't deliver a line to save her life or even pass herself off as a mediocre stripper.  But she's very cute and she has a certain charm that prevents her lack of talent from completely ruining the movie.
The DVD presentation of the movie is in full frame (1.33:1).  The picture quality is outstanding for a 35 year old low-budget movie.  The outtakes are actually longer than the movie itself, and it appears that there may have been a version of this movie that was far bloodier the the final cut that's presented her.
There are three short films on the DVD as extras, two of which are great time capsule relics from the 60's.  ""LSD: Trip or Trap!"" is a 19-minute film produced by the Inglewood Police Department to warn youth of the dangers of LSD.  It's sort of a 1960's version of Refer Madness.  The second, ""Alice Goes to Acidland"", is a 12-minute nudie acid trip that almost defies description.",1077408000,4,1638,4.408637873754153
7932490,5,B000056NW7,"First of all, kudos to Something Weird Video for the Special Edition DVD release of ""Mantis in Lace"". SWV has done an excellent job with this DVD. I have never seen this movie before and I've wanted to buy this DVD for some time. I really love this film. I like the way it was filmed. The lighting or lack of lighting, on most of the scenes are great. The lack of lighting makes the film look like a film noir. The scenes where Lila is tripping out on acid are excellent. The colors and the geometric designs that are lighted on the actor's faces are fantastic. The director of photography, Laszlo Kovacks, has done an excellent job of capturing the psychedelic imagery to the screen. The acting is just awful, but that's what makes the film great. The movie is 87 minutes long. It was filmed between November 18-25 of 1967 and released in theaters and drive-ins in 1968. The psychedelic music sounds like early unreleased Pink Floyd recordings. It uses tapes that were cut up and then edited back together at random, backwards tapes, heavy echo, laughter, and strange music. The theme to the movie is really corny, but I found myself playing it over and over again. It's kind of like a train wreck, you don't want to look, but you know you just have to. The special edition DVD includes the original theatrical trailer of the film, an alternate psychedelic murder scene which is the same as the first murder scene, but more psychedelic designs are superimposed to the original scene. Things like fireworks going off, more geometric psychedelic designs, negative exposure of go-go girls dancing, and a fat man in a black mask holding bananas and dollar bills in his hands. The DVD also includes over 100 minutes of out takes, deleted and alternate scenes from the film. This feature doesn't have any sound, but the music and sound effect tapes from ""Mantis in Lace"" is dubbed in so you can hear the music and effects without the dialog. It's like having the original soundtrack on the DVD. This section also features a much longer version of the movie's theme. The funny thing is that some of the music that is in ""Mantis in Lace"" is also in the movie ""Mondo Mod"". This is because the same man, Harry Novack, produced both films. The DVD also includes The following archival short subject films:
1. Sid Davis's classic classroom scare film ""LSD: Trip or Trap?""
2. ""Alice Goes To Acidland""
3. ""Girl in a Cage"" Why this short film is added, I don't know why. It doesn't relate to the rest of the DVD.
4. A gallery of Harry Novack Exploitation movie poster art with Harry Novack radio-spot rarities.
If you want to know what an underground psychedelic/sexploitation/exploitation film is, this is the film to watch. I highly recommend it. I am very pleased with ""Mantis in Lace. It's everything I thought it would be. This DVD will be played a lot on my DVD player. It's now one of my three favorite DVDs. I am not disappointed with ""Mantis in Lace"". This is psychedelia at its best. They don't make movies like this anymore. By the way, does anyone know what ever happened to Susan(Lila)Stewart? She's a real H-O-T-T-I-E.",1043280000,14,3118,4.629963898916968
7932491,4,B000056NW7,"I recently bought this on VHS and finally finished watching it. Nothing really to add except that Lila's indeciferable accent is just a slight ""Little Dutch Girl"" twang in her speech. Far out! The ending is about what one would expect. Susan Stewart was a very attractive girl. I wonder whatever became of her.
Selling Real Estate down in Florida no doubt. Groovy, Man.
What's the deal with the bananas?",1018137600,4,403,4.771428571428571
7932492,3,B000056NW7,"A trippy psychedelic go-go dancing murder movie. The dialogue scenes were pretty fun to watch - wish there were more of them.
One drawback was the frequency and length of the topless go-go dancing scenes. At least 4 of them seemed to last 5-10 minutes.
I actually liked the theme song (it was constantly played). The color and video looked very high quality.",996796800,5,358,4.698412698412699
7932493,4,B000056NW7,"This little gem is one of the first key films to combine gore with sleaze. Groovy 60s psychedelia, go-go dancers, sexploitation and horror all beautifully photographed by Laszlo Kovacs (Easy Rider)collide in a kaleidoscope of color and LSD laden sensibilities.
The plot concerns a topless dancer, Lila (Susan Stewart)who has taken one too many acid trips. The result leaves her a murderous, psychotic sexual freak who, after making love, slaughters her lovers with two handy weapons of choice - a screwdriver and meatcleaver.
The image quality and sound are nothing short of stunning for a film of this ilk. Evidently the transfer used was from the original negative and it certainly shows.
The extras on this Something Weird disc are quite amazing. We get an alternative Mantis murder sequence, the wonderful color trip sequence to Alice In Acidland, a go-go loop called Lady in a Cage,a poster gallery with radio spots, and 100 minutes of outtakes filled with gore, sex and ultra groovy LSD visuals. To top it off there are previews for The Mad Butcher, The Curious Dr Humpp and Frankenstein's Castle of Freaks.
Something Weird have certainly delivered a wonderful release of a film that defined the underground Grindhouse movement of the 60s.",983491200,33,1245,5.078048780487805
