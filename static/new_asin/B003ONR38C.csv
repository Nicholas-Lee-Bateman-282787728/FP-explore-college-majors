4162465,5,B003ONR38C,Another outstanding documentary with a combination of great photography and good information about the geological and ecological development of this area of Africa. Highly recommended.,1286496000,37,184,6.4
4162466,5,B003ONR38C,"If you've seen any of the other HD nature documentaries from BBC (Planet Earth, Life, Nature's Most Amazing Events, etc), you already know what to expect from this series. There is nothing groundbreaking here, just more of the amazing, high-quality, exciting nautre scenes that, frankly, only BBC knows how to deliver. While I wish David Attenborough had narrated the series, simply because no one else has that kind of gravitas, Hugh Quarshie's narration is decent and takes nothing away from the presentation.

East Africa had already been pretty well documented before this series. I have also traveled there. And still, in shot after shot, this series showed me things I had never before seen.

If you're a fan of high-quality, serious, beautiful nature documentaries, pick this up right away.",1282780800,146,797,5.170542635658915

4162471,1,B003ONR38C,"I ordered it and sent to a friend over seas. Unfortunately, the sound track is missing on this disc. You can watch it silent with titles, but it is far from pleasant. Unfortunately, it is too expensive to return and exchange.",1415491200,,225,4.512195121951219
4162472,5,B003ONR38C,"I think every student should watch this movie. It is biologically and geographically the most relevant documentary I have ever seen. The photography is so stunning, especially on Blu-ray. I had no idea the Rift was so large and so diverse as well as ringed with volcanic activity. I will watch this several times and pass it on to my grandchildren.",1397433600,,348,4.721311475409836
4162473,4,B003ONR38C,"Yes it is possible to get 'animal documentary overload' but the chances of it are minimalized if you stick to quality organisations like the BBC Natural History Unit.

This production maintains their fine standards and really excels in portraying one of the more iconic areas of Africa - the great rift - with verve and splendid photography. This film showcases this geographic feature from top to bottom in terms of looking at the breadth of animal life that inhabits the area and neatly presents how so much of what goes on there is intertwined.

At almost three hours running time you are getting value and if that sort of length is daunting then consume it in chunks. A fine purchase for the animal lover and/or armchair traveller.",1397260800,,735,4.7795275590551185
4162474,5,B003ONR38C,Best i have watched in awhile.. since planet earth released i suppose. not just another nature movie  will recommend to friends,1393891200,,127,5.0476190476190474

4162477,4,B003ONR38C,"This series has a nice mix of both fascinating animals and magnificent landscapes.
Broken into 3 parts, it can be easily enjoyed over a span of several days.",1377993600,,157,4.642857142857143

4162479,5,B003ONR38C,"This film is beautiful and fascinating. I knew a little bit about the Great Rift before, but I learned a lot of new things about it through this documentary. The photography is stunning and the explanations are easy to follow. It kept my attention.",1368576000,,248,4.659090909090909
4162480,3,B003ONR38C,"I did not like this film very much, it was very slow and academic, (which is not what I was expecting).",1364774400,2,103,3.9523809523809526
4162481,3,B003ONR38C,if your into nature films it is not a bad movie lots of pretty scenery and animals to see how they live,1356220800,,103,3.727272727272727
4162482,5,B003ONR38C,"The BBC's The Great Rift is an amazing journey through one of the most diverse and unique regions on Earth, located in eastern Africa. The various animals and plants there presented in the documentary are astounding and really reminded me what a wonderful world this is. The facts presented also show just how vulnerable and fragile all these amazing places are. It is narrated by Hugh Quarshie, who some people may remember from his role in Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace as Queen Amidala's Captain of the Guard.

  The BBC has a long history of making great documentaries and this one does not let down the tradition. The cinematography is sharp, the locations are amazing in their remoteness and each episode is followed by a short anecdotal section showing just how much work the crew put into getting the footage they shot. The presentation is broke into three parts all telling the story of the Great Rift from different angles. One focuses on the geological aspect, describing how fire and lava have played a role in forging the shear valleys and mighty volcanoes. The next talks about how water and lack of it have affected the evolution of plants and animals in the area. The third and final installment talks about how the grasslands that make up most of the area came to be and in turn affect everything in and around them. It is an astonishing story to say the least.

  I can't lie about the fact that I am a huge fan of the BBC's natural world documentary series. Like the others, The Great Rift looks amazing on the HD release and really catches your eye. The only downer to the whole thing is just how threatened it all is by human encroachment. I recommend this movie with 5 stars for anyone who loves nature for what it is and for everyone else who may not know the natural world that is out there. I hope it brings the wonder to everyone that it brings to me and opens eyes and hearts to taking the preservation of the natural world more seriously.",1342569600,15,1975,4.533707865168539
4162483,5,B003ONR38C,"This is a great video, I love this video I'm sure that I will buy another video dealing with information like this one. Love it.",1334793600,2,128,4.16
4162484,5,B003ONR38C,"This producer is good and really good and no wonder it is part of the BBC Earth collection. His other productions are as astonishing as this. You want to learn about Africa topography, nature and ecosystem, this is the one to watch. Double Bravo.",1328659200,5,246,4.613636363636363
4162485,5,B003ONR38C,I have viewed other works by the BBC and have always found them to be of high quality. These are the kinds of films that can be both entertaining and educational. This is another fine example of outstanding photography and very informative nature of BBC programs. I recommend it to young and old alike.,1326672000,,302,4.611111111111111
4162486,5,B003ONR38C,"The filming in this DVD is fantastic!  The scenery, animals, birds, everything is absolutely gorgeous.  I highly recommend this DVD to anyone interested in the African landscape and its inhabitants.",1326067200,,198,5.566666666666666
4162487,5,B003ONR38C,"When it comes to nature films, NOBODY does it better than BBC's Natural History Unit!  The photography is superlative high definition, the content very interresting and informative, plus, I personally prefer the original BBC versions with British narrators than Discovery Channel's re-issued ""Americanized"" versions which replace the original voice with  voice-overs using American actors instead!  Why would they do that?  England IS where the English language comes from, don't cha know?",1325548800,10,489,5.845070422535211
4162488,5,B003ONR38C,shows the best evidence of man origins as not connected to any of popular samples but independent. First time  evidence that God does exist,1324944000,,139,4.791666666666667
4162489,5,B003ONR38C,This dvd shows the wildlife in Africa's Rift Valley. I found it very informative and entertaining. The videography is fantastic. This dvd is a nice one to watch over and over again.,1323993600,,181,4.6875
4162490,5,B003ONR38C,"This show really shows the beautiful sites across Africa's and it's animal kingdom. Great Show. Loved it! When one hears about Africa it's hard to even think about vegetation, rivers and oceans. but they do exist and this show is great to learn about it.",1318291200,,254,4.666666666666667

4162492,4,B003ONR38C,"Beautiful footage! Commentary is obviously slightly biased as it makes statements of ""facts"" about earth's history (that no one was there to observe) but other than that it's a high quality production. I especially like the part about Suswa Caves as I've been there and know the local people as well. I'd recommend this to any teacher of Earth Science.",1310601600,3,352,4.883333333333334
4162493,5,B003ONR38C,"Having just been in Tanzania at the Serengeti, Lake Manyara and the Ngorongoro Crater, we could especially appreciate the content and visual quality of this 3 hour documentary about the Rift Valley. The footage and sound are amazing. How they get so close to the animals is a mystery. Clearly the film team is highly professional and accomplished. The information content is exceptional and this DVD provided hours of entertainment and fascination for the whole family even for our 2 year old niece. A wonderful DVD to have in the library. Well done BBC.",1306627200,17,554,4.904255319148936
4162494,5,B003ONR38C,"This DVD has the best video images I have ever seen.  I viewed this on a 53"" Sony Hi Def TV.  The images were solid, the color intense and many scenes appeared nearly three dimensional.  Over and over again we replayed a section just because of the quality of the image on the screen.",1303430400,30,284,4.222222222222222

8401669,4,B003ONR38C,"Great, but a little dry on the narration. Definately not David Attenborough quality, but it is still really great information and stunning camera shots.  I especially liked the parts about the mountain gorillas. You do not see gorillas in many documentaries, believe me, I have looked. This is great for the price. BBC never disappoints!",1444608000,,337,5.127272727272727
