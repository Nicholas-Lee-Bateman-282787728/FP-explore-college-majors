8670310,5,B00M4OJA5G,"Jake (Charlie Sheen), the new kid in town has a love interest Keri (Sherilyn Fenn). Evidentially Keri is coveted by local hotrod gang leader Packard Walsh (Nick Cassavetes.) so Packard and his minions dispose of Jake.

Low and behold Jake has returned in the form of a Wraith. We have a hot time watching the revenge using a Christine inspired car and bike.
