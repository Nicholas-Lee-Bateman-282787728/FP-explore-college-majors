8045708,5,B000784XRG,"Though again these movies do not include both these two clowns in the same movie, but each movie has one or the other in the movie...not usually the main star either so don't expect real Laurel or real Hardy movies where they are the central character... though they are key figures in each movie to be certain.  but just the same the 6 count 'em SIX movies you get are lots of fun. only one do I recall seeing on other sets so they were almost all new to me.
  1917 the hobo has a Charlie Chaplin copycat. I figured out it wasn't him but it took a minute. a real swipe, but curious to see Hardy acting with ""Chaplin"" as the Hobo...obviously a swipe of the tramp. but overall he was about 60% a perfect imitation of Chaplin so it was deceiving. you get 5 other movies from 1922 to 1926. these of course aren't feature length movies but typical two reelers I would guess... about 20 minutes each. I think the last one was about 10 or 15 minutes...it seemed to go by faster.  two of the movies if I recall had poor contrast but not as bad as I've seen. but they were all good clean fun for the whole family. definitely a bargain.",1376611200,,1127,4.179723502304148

A word about this DVD: UN-RESTORED
Even worse, it looks like it is mastered from VHS!!!

The first two shorts still look quite good, then it goes down hill.  Thundering Fleas is so washed out at times that you have a white screen with a black object running around, and you must guess what is happening.

Another problem: The 'Menu'.  It only has frame grabs from the shorts, you have to guess what the titles are.

THE HOBO - Oliver Hardy & Billy West - same good VHS quality video as on the BRENTWOOD DVD. Very watchable!  Billy West is a Chaplin impersonator, and you will think you are watching a Chaplin film with Ollie as the heavy.

THE SHOW - Larry Semon & Oliver Hardy - Only VHS quality, watch the KINO 'OLIVER HARDY COLLECTION' 35mm presentation, that version looks great!  This has the classic Car v.s. Train chase sequence seen in many compilations!  It is a Larry Semon starring comedy, Ollie has little to do except wear heavy make up over his face.

THE SOILERS - Stan Laurel & James Finlayson - Forget this VHS quality dub, watch the much superior KINO 35mm presentation on their STAN LAUREL DVD.  This copy has a dark, distorted image. The sides looked streached out and cropped.  Next...

WHITE WINGS - Stan Laurel - Also available on Passport's 'LAUREL OR HARDY COLLECTION' but only VHS quality. Worse, the tape was made from a very contrasty 16mm print.  This is the only copy out there right now, so we may as well enjoy it and hope a better film print turns up.

SHOULD SAILORS MARRY? = Oliver Hardy & Clyde Cook - VHS quality video, so watch the LOST FILMS OF LAUREL & HARDY volume 4 or KINO's 'OLIVER HARDY COLLECTION' for 35mm quality.

THUNDERING FLEAS - Our Gang & Oliver Hardy - Also available on Passport's 'LAUREL OR HARDY COLLECTION'. This is from a VERY contrasty 16mm print.  At times it is hard to tell what is going on.",1110240000,8,1883,4.456140350877193
