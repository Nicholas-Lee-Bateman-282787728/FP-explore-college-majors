Excellent teaching.  A bonus is the wonderful singing that accompanies the lessons.

It is a very entertaining video and covers several levels.

Highly recommended.",1275696000,,203,5.666666666666667
8122426,4,1584961279,"Chris Jones does a great job of demonstrating proper rhythm guitar technique.  In addition to rhythm, he gives  examples of bass runs which are executed slowly at first, then at tempo, making them easily learned by most beginners.  Overall, the material is well done, great lighting, closeups,etc. This coupled with Chris'articulate presentational skills makes for an enjoyable and informative instructional session.  My only criticism, more left hand shots showing the chord forms that accompany the strumming patterns.
Chris Jones deserves a hardy round of applause for producing this fine instructional dvd.",1084406400,8,610,5.670329670329671
