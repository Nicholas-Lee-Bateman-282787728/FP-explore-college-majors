8232480,5,B000YENUP4,I love Joyce's workouts.  I know they really work because I was able to get in shape years ago when I lived in Germany by following her book back then.  Now I can do these from a DVD anytime I want.  Beats going to the gym any day.  I love Joyce motivation and sense of humor she is the best. Totally recommend her DVDs and this one is just great!,1401840000,2,347,3.914285714285714

8232482,5,B000YENUP4,"I rented this video first, but unlike the other reviewer, I loved it.  I have never done any weight-training before, because I thought it was too hard and too boring.  In the first two weeks after doing the video three times a week, I lost three pounds.  I found the video to be very inspiring, easy to follow and made me look forward to the workouts.  She recommends that you watch any exercise video before you start working out, which is a really good idea, and you should do anyway.  I recommend this video to beginners through advanced.  My husband, who has weight-trained since high school, says this is an excellent video with challenging workouts for both men and women.",1214697600,7,678,4.608333333333333
8232483,2,B000YENUP4,"I rented this DVD before making the decision to buy.  I won't be buying it.  I've used her books in the past, with success, but only b/c of those books was I able to follow along with the DVD.  She doesn't provide any exercise explaination, or form guidance.  Not a good work out for beginners, I'm an intermediate level and I still didn't think it was great.  For the bra fat it's mostly back exercises, and you need at least 3 sets of weights, for her super sets, which is not explained ahead of time.  The butt workout doesn't require any weights.  I'm only giving it two stars, I think there are better workouts out there.",1201564800,10,626,4.344827586206897
