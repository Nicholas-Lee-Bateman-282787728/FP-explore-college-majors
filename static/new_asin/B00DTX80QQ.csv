8597728,5,B00DTX80QQ,Fabulous instruction and return demonstrations for some of the most difficult movements in ballet.  I really like how she shows the correct way to execute a movement as well as showing the mistakes and how to improve ones technique.,1457740800,,232,4.948717948717949
8597729,5,B00DTX80QQ,"Great to have if you want to understand Balanchine's style of turns and spotting.
Detailed explanation of each type of turns, what it's for, why and how to execute it properly aka Balanchine style by Ms Suki Schorer with occasional filler by Ms Merrill Ashley.
Alignment and spotting was discussed and you'll see Ms Schorer giving corrections with immediate results on the demonstrators.
She also gave some philosophy why a certain position is preferred. Very helpful to understand Balanchine's preference and ""style"".
I'm so glad I bought it!",1420070400,2,543,5.181818181818182
