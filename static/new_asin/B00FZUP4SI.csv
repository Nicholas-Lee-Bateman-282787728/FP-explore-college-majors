8619790,3,B00FZUP4SI,"I found the presentation of this very important information, which deserves 5 stars so irritating my initial  inclination was to deduct 3 stars, but thinking that too dissuasive, changed the rating.

This new understanding of how  1.) the attempt to define our behavior and nervous system by ""Sympathetic and Parasympathetic"" is too shallow an intellectual construct, and 2.) how we have a more ancient branch which controls our ""below cognitive ""or conscious awareness of safety thereby allowing us to interact socially to get human needs met is  SO VALUABLE it blows me away.

This is important for those who have had ""good enough"" parenting and modeling when going into long term relationships and experiencing problems that seem irresolvable AND for those who had childhood trauma and abuse.

Most therapists are using cognitive and behavior therapies and strategies which for a large section of our population do not work and only serve to
create guilt and more shame and blame.

I just regret that about 65% - 75%  of the  lecture consisting of valuable and illustrative slides was completely omitted!!!  The target audience would have been better served by issuing this as a CD, not a DVD.  Dr Porges is an appealing man himself, but with  all these present time slides excluded from the lecture it is a serious omission.  I tried to find a way to email this objection without success,so although I would like to think someone will be observant enough to correct the omission and issue  a new DVD or errata slip of the slides, I am not sanguine.

However, if this doesn't irritate you as much as it did me, I highly recommend this lecture, and his website for more videos (stephenporges.com).",1471651200,,1699,4.912280701754386

Don't stop searching till you find answers...especially ""out of the box"" answers. Check out anything you can find on neurofeedback also. There are solutions and they don't have to be pharmaceuticals.",1469059200,,371,5.526315789473684
