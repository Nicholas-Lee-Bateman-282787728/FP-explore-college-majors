8469652,5,B005F678YU,This DVD was recommended by my dog's vet.  I have a 1 year old Boxer that I would like to get involved in agility.  The DVD contains exercises and stretches to help her fitness and strength level.  The DVD is easy to follow and apply with my dog (with a little practice).,1482364800,2,271,4.173076923076923
8469653,3,B005F678YU,"I purchased this DVD after it was recommended for me at the canine rehabilitation center where I take my dog.  It had a lot of good information on exercises for my dog, who used to do agility before her hip dysplasia, as I hope she will again soon.  However, I had trouble playing this video in my DVD player.  The disc made loud whirring noises, and the menu often skipped to items I had not selected, went blank, or froze up.  I did manage to play it on my laptop, however, with only brief 'noisy' periods, and an error that I was unable to repeat on the beg-stand-beg item.  These problems may have been due to a faulty disc, however, I also found the menu system irritating.  With the exception of the last segment, which ran only as a single 6:26 section, every segment had multiple items, which had to be played separately.  The menu also defaulted to the first item after any item was played, which was especially annoying in the 15 item long ""strength exercises"" section.  A ""play all"" button would have been much more convenient.",1366416000,7,1038,4.48404255319149
