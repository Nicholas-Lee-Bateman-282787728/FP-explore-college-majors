8251058,5,B0013HXBBO,"I am an Enewetak Atoll Atomic Cleanup veteran.  I was there for the cleanup all the way until the end on an extended tour; even when 60 minutes came to film this.  We were told NOT to talk to them apart from the ""script"".  One did.  He just answered a basic question and was disciplined.  In addition, out of a possible 8000 participants, we in the Enewetak Atoll Cleanup Veterans Group have only found close to 600 still alive and racked with ailments from the radiation.  We were NOT protected. We were NOT given the right badges.  It's so horrible and to watch all of my brothers slowly disintegrate with cancers, bone loss, etc",1521590400,,631,4.482456140350878
8251059,5,B0013HXBBO,"This is the only video documentary I could find that covers just Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall islands, rather than as a part of the WWII pacific theater.  As a civilian biologist with an Air Force Survey in the 1970s, I worked on these islets for many weeks before the natives were returned.  This documentary is not of best quality, but contains the only video documentary record I know of that shows the Atoll, goes through some history, and spends time with the subject of returning the natives.  The 43  atomic tests on and around the atoll and the earlier devastation of the war and Japanese occupation have reduced most of the islets to barren low sandy platforms that are now at risk from storms and rising sea levels.  Since this documentary was shown on ABC news, further cleanup has been attempted and more legal settlements for the natives has occurred.  From other sources, I gather that this Atoll is not self sufficient and that it remains a problem site with radioactivity and lack of opportunity for the people who elected to live there.",1361664000,,1055,4.706521739130435
