2911073,5,B000TXPXCS,"The incomparable Angela Lansbury returns again as Jessica Fletcher and viewers are sure to be pleased as our beloved sleuth from Cabot Cove unravels the clues and uncovers the truth  behind twisted murder mysteries in this season of Murder She Wrote.  It's always fun to ""travel"" with Jessica and try to solve the mystery with her, and like in previous seasons before it, Season 7 does not disappoint in the intrigue and fun category.  I have always loved Murder She Wrote because it is just a pleasant show to watch.  I can always relax and enjoy the show without ever  having to worry about what cuss words I will hear, or what graphic/bloody images or nudity I will see.  Each episode weaves a good mystery and Jessica Fletcher is a wonderful and likeable character.  I think everyone could use a Jessica Fletcher somewhere in their lives. I believe it is truly sad that Angela Lansbury was never awarded for her work in this series, because she always played Jessica with so much sincerity and warmth.  There were many episodes that I liked this season, but her performance in the episode ""Thursday's Child"" touched me.  Spoiler alert!  Jessica encounters a woman with whom her beloved husband Frank may have had a child with while he was away at war, and she has to learn if it is the truth or not.
There were moments in the episode where Angela Lansbury didn't even say a word of dialogue and the look in her eyes made me almost cry.  An emotional impact from just a mere look in her eyes and her deafening silence.
That is the mark of a superior actor in this superior series.",1421020800,4,1583,4.5583038869257955

2911115,5,B000TXPXCS,"First of all, I love Murder SHe Wrote. I have read a lot of the problems many were experiencing, and I was happy to see that I got five discs, and not double sided. More important for me was the bonus features. That was what I wanted as I have come across, Murder She Wrote discs elsewhere and they didn't have that.

What I would love to get are many of the moves and or shows that Angela Lansbury has been in as well as the ones William Windom was in. I am a very, very big fan of William WIndom, this was the cats meow to get this series.

2911134,5,B000TXPXCS,"Season 7 another great season of Murder She Wrote. Sure there are non-Jessica episodes, but I like the ones with Dennis Stanton, and Harry McGraw too. This season contains one of my favorite episodes A Body to Die for, It's the one where Cabot Cove's  new gym owner prompts women in town to take up physical fitness again,along with  Where Have You Gone Billy Boy? the one with the creepy ventriloquist.

Great price, super-fast shipping. I actually received it 4 days earlier than expected. There was one problem. My box for Disc 5 was broken at the top where it closed,(broken all along the top) no damage to the cd though, plays just fine.(4 episodes on disc 5) But other than that very satisfied.

2911143,5,B000TXPXCS,"There is actually little on TV these days that I consider worth spending time to watch; just too much gore per square inch. But I never get tired of watching the older mysteries-- Poirot, Perry Mason, and especially Murder, She Wrote. These mysteries have just the right amount of suspense, action, and even humor-- nice comic relief. I highly recommend these to anyone who wants a good story without having nightmares!",1251763200,15,419,4.915492957746479
2911144,4,B000TXPXCS,"I really enjoyed this season overall, but I was disappointed with the number of episodes Jessica seemed to be missing from. (as seen on the dvd feature, I understand it was because Angela Lansbury was feeling overworked. Understandable)

But for a replacement I would've much preferred Michael Haggardy or even Harry the PI. They would've been much more interesting and appealing to follow, than this Dennis character. He creeped me out.",1242518400,5,437,5.154929577464789

2911154,5,B000TXPXCS,"I have loved Murder She Wrote since watching the first season as a thirteen year-old back in 1984. I have faithfully followed all the seasons, and Season Seven [1990-1991] is as entertaining as ever.

As with Season Six, J.B. Fletcher does not appear as a central character in all of the episodes. In all, there are about 5 episodes without Ms Fletcher where Dennis Stanton [former jewel thief turned insurance investigator] solves the murder mystery.

Even without Angela Lansbury's Ms Fletcher solving the mysteries, the stories are so well-written and acted that it is still fun to watch them.

Of course, the regulars are a hoot to watch as usual! Angela Lansbury is flawless in her role as super sleuth J.B. Fletcher, and there are of course  William Windom as Dr Seth Hazlitt, Richard Paul as mayor Sam Booth, Jerry Orbach as PI Harry McGraw, Ron Masak playing Sheriff Mort Metzger etc.

Some of my favorite episodes in this season are ""The Family Jewels"" [a murder during a political fundraiser for Jessica's old friend reveals a rich woman's past], ""A Body to Die For"" [a male fitness instructor who seems to have dazzled the females of Cabot Cove is accused of murder], ""The Family Doctor"" [Seth and Jessica get involved with a mob family]& ""The Prodigal Father"" [set in Cabot Cove, Jessica helps her neighbor solve the mystery of her long-lost father's return to Cabot Cove, and subsequent murder].

All in all, another entertaining season of MSW. I hope the later seasons [9-12] will be made available on DVD soon!",1205539200,7,1525,4.846153846153846

2911158,5,B000TXPXCS,"I have all of the seasons up to this one.  I am addicted I guess to ""Murder She Wrote"". It is so entertaining even if revolves around ""Murder"".  Never gross like some murder/mystery shows, and the setting in Maine (really Mendocino, CA) is so ideal in the small town sea coast.

My whole family, both our sons and now our grand daughter are fans of this show.  I am so glad that they are available for home entertainment.  We watch them again and again.",1203120000,,453,4.345238095238095

She now has all seven seasons that have been released. She watches them over and over and over. If they had been VHS, the tape would have been worn out by now.

They could have titled this season as the Dennis Stanton (Keith Michell) show, as episodes 3, 8, 10, 12, and 18 were exclusively devoted to that character.
