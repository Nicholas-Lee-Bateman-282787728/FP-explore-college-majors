3079587,2,B00127RAF8,"Now before I render what little feedback I have following my viewing of Color of the Cross 2: Resurrection, in no way am I harboring disrespect for Mr. Jean Claude LaMarre nor am I unappreciative for his overall investment and bringing to life of his vision for Color of the Cross and it's attempt(s) at giving the world a fresh perspective on Jesus, His life, ministry, death, burial and resurrection. I feel that, like many other movies such as Jesus of Nazareth, Passion of the Christ, The Last Temptation of Christ, Color of the Cross, though not a perfect account, is a worthy addition to your collection and in a class of it's own(refer to my post for the 1st film for details). However, while the Color of the Cross was a one of a kind classic for being the 1st major motion picture to portray Christ as a black Jew and for it's controversial racial spin on the crucifixion...the sequel is an 85 minute MISERY. Seriously, if you look at the terrible dubbing, the splicing together of stock footage from the 1st film with the soap opera-ish appeal of the sequel, the confusing sequence of events before, during and after the resurrection, the backyard graphics, and poor make-up and constuming...one may ponder whether Jean Claude either ran out of money going into this production or if this was a minute man job thrown together amidst criticism for not incorporating the resurrection in the 1st film. The technical flaws make it easy to note the OBVIOUS difference in the cast, the bad acting, the rambling, and the leaving of little to the imagination. It begins with clips from the 1st film(including dialogue from the 1st film, featuring actors who were replaced in the sequel), Jesus disciples are in hiding, His family is harrassed,Judas' body is found, Joseph of Arimathea has Jesus' entombed, Jesus raises from the dead(in a predictable manner, leaving nothing to the imagination), makes ghost like appearances(and performs a miracle) throughout most of the film after His tomb is found empty, appears to His disciples while they're attempting to fish(strangely, there's no lake, and we see the feeding of the multitudes miracle incorporated as opposed to the disciples casting their net to the other side...lol), Jesus forgives Peter, charges the 11 with the great commission, and ""ascends."" Amidst it's MANY shortcomings, one can grasp the art in Jean Claude LaMarre's follow-up...we see portrayals of the disciples doubts and fears, His family's struggles, His appearance to the 2 followers on the Emmaus Road as an old man(at 1st) and in the fact that we see Him concealed until toward the end when He allows Himself to be handled by Thomas and the others(bald fade and a clean shave...interesting take on Jesus appearing in a new form). If not for the technical/acting shortcomings...this film would've been passable. But how serious can you take a movie on the life of Christ that looks like it was shot in someone's back yard on a handheld cam w/t live sound one moment and studio dubbing the next? With all due respect, Mr. LaMarre...this one needed a little more time and money. Could've been a lot better and should've made a lot more since than it did. Buyers...this is ONLY for you if you're a completist.",1205452800,14,3232,4.856884057971015

8244557,1,B00127RAF8,As this DVD sleeve had the Warner Brothers logo proudly displayed on the spine and back I was confident I would have a good quality transfer.  Not so. 2.35:1 letterboxed in a 4:3 frame!!!!!!!!!!! In 2008 this is just inexcusable. The video itself was dark and grainy. Also no subtitles. This is deceptive to have the WB logo on such a shameful release. Shame on Lightyear video and shame on WB for allowing their logo to be used on such rubbish.,1482883200,,445,4.493827160493828

8244560,1,B00127RAF8,"I like to give filmakers and book writers room for artistic liberty (e.g. The Robe), but this film leaves out so much pertinent information of the story reaching for some non achieved artistry that it was painful to watch.  So much opportunity was lost in the road to Emmaus scene I wondered what the filmakers could possibly have been thinking.  Plenty of other good films to watch without wasting time on this one.",1399248000,,416,4.684931506849315

people in part 2, but overall It was a good movie. It was also too short.",1362873600,,156,4.032258064516129
