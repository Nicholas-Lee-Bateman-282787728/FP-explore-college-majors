119583,2,0790751143,Clint Eastwood must have been offered a lot of money to do this picture.  Without a doubt the worst of the Dirty Harry movies.  It seemed like Clint was doing a parody of himself. The only saving grace is Taye Daly's role as  a rookie detective that gives Harry a run for his money.  There are also  some good oneliners.  The next Dirty Harry film Sudden Impact is a major  improvement.,944006400,4,386,4.352112676056338
119603,3,0790751143,"The third Dirty Harry film is one of the two weakest, along with THE DEAD POOL.  Its still quite enjoyable, if you adjust your expectations and see it more as a generic 70s cop film rather than something on the intense wavelength of the first two Harry pictures.

THE ENFORCER opens with promise.  On a too-brightly lit day, an attractive but obviously dangerous hitchhiker picks up a couple of working stiffs, luring them into the placid hills to their doom.  Then we cut to picturesque San Francisco, a sprawling metropolis shrouded in fog.  It makes for a tense, and promising, sense of contrast.

Then we get a little horsing around (both some comic relief as well as some solid action) before diving into the main plot.  Thats fine because its entertaining stuff, even if Eastwoods interpretation of Callahan has obviously mellowed a bit from his almost Man Without A Name intensity in the original DIRTY HARRY.

But we have to get back to that plot, and thats where things start to drift.  THE ENFORCER obviously tries to balance out  MAGNUM FORCE, presenting Harry with a Mansonesque left-wing radical cabal as antagonists to match the Fascist dirty cops of the previous entry.

Their leader, Bobby Maxwell,  is a bug-eyed blond played by DeVeren Bookwalter, an Andy Warhol protg (!) who won a bunch of theatre awards for his own adaptation of Cyrano de Bergerac (!).  I think he does well with what hes given, but the script equivocates on his real motives: at one point, we are emphatically told by a source that Maxwell isn't a true believer, that he preaches left-wing revolution to galvanize his followers but hes just in it for the money.  Well, thats interesting perhaps, but nothing we see on screen follows that up in any way.  In fact, everthing we see with Maxwell makes him look like a totally committed (and completely whacko) cult leader.  I sense that the scriptwriters never really smoothed out their ideas.

Maxwells crew of radicals is one of the most strangely miscast gangs ever assembled.  The hot Manson Chick-lookalike gets terminated early, leaving Maxwell with a lot of overweight, low-energy followers who look more like the dregs of a teachers lounge an hour after coffee break.  Its truly a headscratcher because these are not the threatening-looking types of people this film needs!

Famously, this is the early feminist cop/buddy picture because Tyne Daly made her career playing plucky Insp. Kate Moore.  As a non-feminist myself, this is an interesting characterization because while in some ways the film obviously promotes this progressive attitude towards a Lady Cop it also doesnt stint on showing her physical and sometimes emotional limitations in doing her job.  She demands respect as an equal but seems at least tacitly to admit she doesnt deserve it if she cant perform equally: and in crucial respects she doesnt.  Her characters strength ultimately depends on something more like moral fiber, up to and including an almost saintly bravery which plays well on screen but is perhaps unlikely to be replayed in real life by many of either sex.

Still, Daly and Eastwood have good buddy chemistry, which the filmmakers wisely chose not to steer towards a romantic destination, even if there are maybe just a couple of hints that Insp. Moore grows almost a puppyish devotion to her stalwart leading partner.

Eastwood himself may understandably have felt less enthusiasm during this production than before.  Still, its a fun performance and the script (for all its nagging structural problems) does give him some memorably salty exchanges with his bureaucratic overlords, along with some wry social commentary when visiting the local branch of black militants.

As an action film, THE ENFORCER is relatively perfunctory.  I enjoy the foot chase that spirals over the stairwells and across the rooftops of San Francisco (crashing, at one memorable juncture, into a porno shoot) to the pleasant if not altogether memorable sounds of Jerry Fieldings jazz score.  However,--and this in spite of the films memorable use of rocket launchers-- its just no great shakes in staging action scenes, and the Alcatraz finale, while functional and watchable, could surely have used more tension.

The violence can at times be graphic, and there are a couple of scenes (at the coroners and in a seedy business establishment) which frankly are in rather poor taste.  You could say some of the same about MAGNUM FORCE, but in that film these elements seemed to contribute to an overall mood of intensity, dread, and corruption which make that film full of impact.  With THE ENFORCER you're getting a functional genre piece with some interesting ideas floating around but not quite gelling.  Still, this is Eastwood, and this is Dirty Harry, so theres something to enjoy.  Id give it a Leonard Maltin two-and-a-half stars.",1492387200,,4850,5.006234413965087

119620,5,0790751143,"- DiGiorgio to Callahan as Dirty Harry is about to walk into a hostage situation: ""What about me? I'm your partner.""
- Callahan: ""I may have to move fast, and I don't need too much linguini to hold me back.""
- DiGiorgio: ""You got a lot of class, Harry.""

1976's The Enforcer is, chronologically, the third of five in the Dirty Harry series, and maybe it's my favorite of the bunch. It's as violent as its predecessors, and Eastwood is as laconic and as insubordinate and engages in several cool action sequences. The decider for me was the inclusion of Tyne Daly whose character ends up the perfect foil to our iconoclastic SFPD Homicide Inspector. The Enforcer was intended to be the capper to what was originally supposed to be a trilogy, except these movies kept on making money and Dirty Harry kept on being just too damn popular .

Callahan's at it again, as the movie opens. He and his partner, Frank DiGiorgio (John Mitchum), spend the morning first responding to a restaurant emergency - in which Harry cures a heart attack victim in his own inimitable way - and then to an all units call to a liquor store hold-up. Harry's excessive methods resolve the incident but result in injured hostages and $14,379 in property damage, rendering his superiors incredibly pissed. So, for saving the day, Harry's taken off Homicide (again!) and transferred to Personnel. (Harry's rebuttal: ""Personnel? That's for a--holes!"")

We find out that Callahan isn't a fan of affirmative action, not when it imperils badges on the streets. As part of the interview board to promote candidates to Inspector, he rips into a nervous Kate Moore (Daly) who's been on the force for nine years, yeah, but in the Personnel & Records Dept. Still, when his old partner gets hurt, take a wild guess as to whom Callahan lands as his new partner?

I should mention that the crime elements of the plot concern rocket-armed radicals, black militants, bombings, Dirty Harry's flushing a sleazoid down a toilet, and the mayor's abduction. But, to me, all those take second place to what really hooked me: the interplay between Eastwood and Daly. Not that they go this route, but this may be the closest to a love story that a Dirty Harry flick will ever get. I think Tyne Daly was perfectly cast. She doesn't have those classic Hollywood looks, but, man, does she look striking. She foreshadows how awesome she'll be in Cagney & Lacey. I like that they keep it real with Daly's depiction. Kate Moore, starting out, has very limited experience in the field so, of course, she'd be in over her head when she and Callahan are on the streets chasing leads. But she's got tremendous guts, and I love that she refuses to lose her composure, and that she all the time stands up to Callahan in spite of his condescending treatment of her. It's inevitable that she earns his grudging trust and respect. That's more than the slimy mayor of San Francisco ever does.

If there's one thing that disappointed me, it's that this one fails to produce a memorable catch phrase, although I did go thru a phase as a kid when I went around telling people, ""Your mouthwash ain't making it.""",1467417600,,3139,4.689655172413793

119662,4,0790751143,"The Enforcer is a American police action film that stars Clint Eastwood as Inspector ""Dirty"" Harry Callahan. This third installment of the Dirty Harry Series is about the police detective being paired with a female partner.

Harry Callahan is paired with Kate Moore. Together,they try to bring down a terrorist organization that has kidnapped the mayor of San Francisco. He goes undercover as a terrorist. Later,they both discover that that the mayor is being held at Alcatraz Island. Together,they battle the kidnappers. Moore frees the mayor but a terrorist kills her as she saves Callahan's life. He avenges Moore. At the end,the inspector is uninterested in the mayor's gratitude,as he returns to his partner's corpse.

The movie is action packed but obviously violent. But nevertheless,its level of violence is not up to up as compared to today's films. Having Dirty Harry go up against terrorists also provide an interesting premise and entertainment especially among Dirty Harry fans. As for the performances,Tyne Daly provides a riveting one as the female partner. The viewer will definitely get her sympathy especially when she gives up her life to save Harry. Overall,this is not up to par with the first film but it is still a good one to watch and reminisce especially when action heroes are people and not robotic mercenaries.",1420588800,,1339,5.137614678899083

119679,5,0790751143,"I like THE ENFORCER as a follow-up to the original DIRTY HARRY. Harry is not after a single suspect, but now a terrorist group in San Francisco demanding a ransom. Looking back at MAGNUM FORCE there is an attempt to justify the true nature and motivations of Harry Callahan. THE ENFORCER's straight forward approach in many scenes, primarily those scenes dealing with the terrorist group, is more satisfying and more believable in that respect, but not as entertaining. THE ENFORCER does not beat around the bush and there is a true sense of realism throughout the scenes dealing with the terrorists. However, THE ENFORCER is the first Dirty Harry film that shows signs of self parody. THE ENFORCER is several years beyond the effect of the 60s and cynicism seems to have taken hold and returned to all aspects of society. Now Harry is taking on the Women's liberation movement and in these scenes you do not get a sense of real conviction on Harry's part. Harry is no longer taking on the system in the larger scheme of things and the script now seems to have him nitpicking almost strictly for chuckles. He tries to tear apart detective candidate Tyne Daly and she eventually ends up being his partner. The film tries to balance 2 storylines in a way. We now have terrorists and Harry's having to break in a female partner and he is at odds with the higher ups on both fronts. Jerry Fielding's score seems to handle this pretty well. Eastwood's Harry seems a bit older, a bit wiser here and perhaps showing signs that you just can't beat the system. At the time of its release the Women's liberation movement was starting to shows signs of coming to some fruition, but one gets the feeling that the film itself was not convinced. In the end, Harry just gets the job done without all the bureaucratic nonsense.",1413676800,2,1811,4.644859813084112

""We want one million dollars or we start blowing things up.  The People's Revolutionary Strike Force.  Remember Fessenheim.""

The above is the motivation for this third installment in the ""Dirty Harry"" movie series.

This movie tries to follow the same formula as the first movie (""Dirty Harry,"" 1971) but this time instead of pursuing a single thug, ""Dirty"" Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) is going after a group of thugs.

The first movie also presents Dirty Harry to the world and does a memorable job in doing this.  This movie can't do this so, to make it more interesting, Harry is teamed up with a newly-minted female inspector (Tyne Daly).

Unfortunately, this does make for a very interesting film.  Clint Eastwood seems to walk through his performance and does not seem to deliver the same energy or intensity as he did in the first two installments of the series.  (The second installment was ""Magnum Force,"" 1973.)

The only bright spot is Tyne Daly.  She gives an admirable performance.

This movie has a high level of violence but even with this, this film seems ""routine.""

As well, the background music was lack-lustre.

I was surprised when I read that this movie was a major commercial success.  (Its budget was nine million dollars and its box office draw was about forty-six million.)  I think this was due to Clint Eastwood's star power which was firmly established by then.

Finally, the DVD itself (released in 2001, part of ""The Clint Eastwood Collection"") has six extras.

In conclusion, after two excellent installments in the ""Dirty Harry"" movie series, this movie falls below expectations.

119717,2,0790751143,"""Dirty Harry"" was a gritty, brilliant suspense movie. ""Magnum Force"" was more of a Hollywood product, but still a solid timeless thriller.

Sadly ""The Enforcer"" is the first misstep in the classic Dirty Harry series, skewing the series in all the wrong directions -- we've got dated villains, a weird soundtrack, and an oddly defanged Harry dealing with TV-drama woes (oh no, he's got a WOMAN partner! And she's BY THE BOOK!). Clint Eastwood is as cool as ever, but he seems to be sleepwalking through large portions of the story.

After getting in trouble (again) for using excessive force, Harry (Eastwood) ends up exiled to the personnel department, where he's forced to deal with inexperienced cops being made inspectors. But when his newest partner, Frank DiGiorgio (John Mitchum), is fatally injured by an extremist group called the People's Revolutionary Strike (what?), Harry is launched back into the fray.

To his dismay, his new partner is Inspector Kate Moore (Tyne Daly), who has never made an arrest or worked a real case. But because she's a woman, the publicity-hungry mayor wants her on the case. And when a bomb is set off in the Hall of Justice, the uneasy partners are forced to go after the people responsible -- with shocking and tragic results.

""The Enforcer"" doesn't really feel much like the previous two Dirty Harry movies. In fact, it sometimes feels more like an overlong episode of a '70s cop TV show -- just look at the whole subplot about Harry getting an ""odd couple"" partner who, of course, complements him well. And let's face it, the whole revolutionary bomber thing has not aged well, nor are any of villains very memorable.

And James Fargo doesn't really inject much life into the lackluster story. There are some humorous moments that elicit laughter (Freddie the Fainter), but the more script isn't as witty or tight as you would expect. And the action scenes are completely derailed by the soundtrack -- we get this weird cheery jazz music that sounds completely out of place. Whose idea was that?

That isn't to say that there aren't some powerful scenes -- there is a very intense scene when Harry speaks to a dying friend, and Eastwood pulls it off with a real sense of repressed rage and grief. But they're too few and far between.

Eastwood himself seems to be going through this one on autopilot, probably because Harry seems oddly defanged in this one. Oh, he's still awesome and hard-boiled, but he just doesn't seem as menacing or independent here. Tyne Daly does a pretty good job as Kate, though, and the inexperienced but brave cop does complement Eastwood's hard-bitten Harry well. Too bad she didn't appear in any future movies.

""The Enforcer"" stumbles badly by having very little in common with the previous two Dirty Harry movies -- it feels strangely generic, as if it were a copy of a copy of a Clint Eastwood movie. Watch only if you want to see the complete series.",1364774400,,2928,4.784158415841584

119722,1,0790751143,"""The Enforcer"" is the third of the first three Dirty Harry movies
(the others being ""Dirty Harry"" and ""Magnum Force"")
and it is the worst by far.
Not only is it the worst of the three,
it is an objectively bad movie.
I can't think of any reason to recommend it.
It is a caricature of itself, if that is possible.

Lame acting of lame characters, lame jokes, lame plot.
Mediocre in every way except for moments
of good action cinematography.
This would not even rate as good television.
Give me an episode of Kojak over this any day.

There is excessive and blatant reference
to popular political issues of the day (mid-70's)
with no point to be made.
It is trapped in the time it was made.

Clint Eastwood sleep-walks through this one.
This movie appears to be simply an attempt to capitalize
on the success of the previous two Dirty Harry movies.
That would be alright if it was good, but...

There are these violent social revolutionaries
with no purpose causing mayhem for no apparent
reason except for the occasional bumper sicker slogan
about ""the people"" and to get some money.
What people? I don't know.
They rob an armory.
They blow up a toilet.
They kidnap the mayor for a ransom.
They should have asked a ransom for the toilet.
They made obscure references to sabotage of a nuclear power plant,
but what good is a threat if no one knows what you are talking about.
Their secret lair is Alcatraz. Way to keep a low profile.

Inspector ""Dirty"" Harry Callahan of the San Francisco
Police Department's Homocide Division has a woman partner
with no law enforcement experience whatsoever,
but that's a good thing because it advances the cause
of women by proving that they are incompetent
and can only achieve by special allowances being made
based on their gender, female.
She was able to shoot a few people with a gun,
but only because Harry yanked her out of the way
of the exhaust of a bazooka during a demonstration
a second before it would have incinerated her.

Harry and his partneress, who never takes his good
advise to stay behind while he tries to do police
investigative work, visit a black peoples gang crib
which allows for lots of dissing of white people
proving that the problem of racism is actually
that black people are racist and no white woman
is safe in a room with black men in it.
Huh?

It's a good thing that Harry's partner, Kate (Tyne Daley),
doesn't listen to him when he tells her to stay behind
because she saves his life by shooting a heavily armed nun
gunning for the dirty one as he is threatening a crazed priest
in a confessional by holding The Gun to his head.
Don't ask.
Never refuse to give Harry communion at the altar rail
because he will prove that he is worthy by blowing your
head clean off.

A movie that has an inflatable sex doll with a live
instructor to show the 32 ways it can be used
can't be all bad.
Harry pops the doll with a lit cigarette,
proving that even latex balloons get off on a little
S&M now and then.

Sorry about the spoilers.

Don't bother with this movie,
but do check out the classic ""Dirty Harry""
and the even better ""Magnum Force"".",1346198400,2,3106,4.471731448763251

I have seen all of his movies all the way back to TV shows Rawhide 1959-1965. I know a movie does not pleas too very ones like.
 some movies are no good or just bad. I know the movies i see that the next person does not like and etc.
Back to the Enforcer is a good one give it a look, and see if you like it or not.
One movie that Clint as a actor called Thunderbolt and Light Foot is a funny and good action.
In this movie there other good actors like young Jeff  Bridges. In fact the movie was made were I live at. You can see all the actors and inf on IMDB. I love IMDB inf on all movies, actors, and clips

119735,5,0790751143,"Once again, Eastwood reprises his signature role as Dirty Harry in this third, and imo, funniest installment. This time Harry and his rookie partner, played by Tyne Daly,are out to catch a group of hippie terrorists who look like the Village People. Like the other previous films, Harry's blunt but effective style of police work isn't to the tastes of his superiors who want him to work within the system. Just to piss him off, they assign a female rookie to be his new partner after his old partner goes down.

Daly is perfect in her feminist ""I-can-do-this-job-as-well-as-a-man"" role. Though book-smart, her lack of experience is glaring, one time almost getting her head blown off by a bazooka. Eastwood captures perfectly the sexism of the time in which this film was made, gradually warming to his female partner as the film progresses. There's a funny scene where Eastwood is in pursuit of one of the terrorists and lands literally in the middle of a porno movie. My favorite scene is the one at the barbershop belonging to a Black Panther-looking soul-brother named Mustafa who is Harry's street-level informer. Can't think of his name right now, but the same brother played in the previous films as well, as a pimp in the second movie and as a bank robber in the first one. Then there's the hip long-haired hippie-looking priest in the cathedral: ""Hey, man, you can't bring a gun in the church!""

I rank this one up there with Penitentiary 1 as far as laughs are concerned. Like I said, my favorite of the series. No one has, ever, or will do it like Eastwood. What I'd give to shake his hand.",1319155200,3,1602,4.677304964539007
119736,4,0790751143,"THE ENFORCER is not the best of the Dirty Harry films, but it's not a bad romp through Frisco, either. Unremittingly brutal and violent, it also shows more heart and character-complexity than its predecessors, and arguably has the best acting-chemistry of any entry in the series.

In DIRTY HARRY (1971), Clint Eastwood's man-alone detective, Inspector Harry Callahan, was pitted against a vicious serial killer. In MAGNUM FORCE (1973), he crossed revolvers with a gang of ruthless vigilante cops. But by the time THE ENFORCER came round, in 1976, terrorism - domestic and international - had become the public's principal anxiety; so it's not surprising Dirty Harry was summoned to give it a sound thrashing with his .44 Magnum.

THE ENFORCER opens in true D.H. style, with two brutal murders, as a domestic terrorist group called the People's Revolutionary Strikeforce steals a gas truck, which they soon use to rob a weapons warehouse of a huge supply of machine guns and rocket launchers. The robbery is detected by Harry's sometime partner, the tubby but tough Inspector DiGorgio (John Mitchum), a veteran of the two previous films, who gets a Bowie knife in his liver for his troubles. Enraged by the loss of yet another partner, Callahan sets out to hunt down these killhappy terrorists, a motley crew of idealists and mercenary-types led by the psychopathic Bobby Maxwell (DeVeren Brookwalter). Unfortunately, he has to deal with the constant interference of his boss Captain ""criminals have rights too!"" McKay (Bradford Dillman), and his new partner, a newbie female officer named Kate Moore (Tyne Daly). Maxwell's gang terrorizes the city for a time, before finally electing to kidnap the mayor (John Crawford) and hold him for ransom. This being a Dirty Harry movie, the City naturally agrees to pay the ransom. Funny thing, though; making a deal with the City doesn't protect you from Harry. He makes his own deals, and he makes them with a Magnum.

THE ENFORCER has its problems; it isn't as visceral as DIRTY HARRY or as visually pleasing and well-constructed as MAGNUM FORCE, and the villains are bit generic, but it has a lot of enjoyable moments. Harry's shall we say...creative...solution to a liquor store holdup, his verbal evisceration of an annoying feminist from City Hall, his rage over bureacratic inefficiency (""I'm comin' down there in five minutes, and you'd better have those files ready, you pencil-pushing son of a ----!""), his ten-minute foot chase of a suspect (that ends up interrupting a porno shoot), his flabbergasted reaction to being assigned a female partner, his thrashing of a militant priest (""I ain't got time to argue religion with you, boy!"") and the anatomically uncomfortable suggestions he continually makes to Captain McKay are all classic D.H. To top it off, Eastwood has great chemistry with Tyne Daly, with Albert Popwell (who plays different roles in four different D.H. films), and with Dillman, too.

Beneath all the shallow charges of ""fascism"" that this series had to endure from witless clods who couldn't define ""fascism"" if you gave them three years to do it, is the simple truth that Harry simply represents The Man Who Is Fed The F Up And Ain't Gonna Take It No More. Not from his boss and certainly not from the criminals. If his methods are about as subtle as a stick of dynamite, they merely reflect the secret fantasies of nearly all of us, namely, that bureacracy be given the finger and the bad guys given a taste of their own medicine. Is that so bad? I don't think so. And neither is THE ENFORCER.",1319068800,,3568,4.951585976627713

119738,4,0790751143,"Clint Eastwood set the mold for gritty 1970's police thrillers, as Inspector Harry Callahan in Dirty Harry (1971).  Things kind of spun off course in the sequel Magnum Force (1973), where the focus was on Callahan and a band of rogue police officers, rather than pursing a major villain.  Rather than continuing to show regard and respect for the men in blue, Magnum Force featured vigilantes betraying the public trust.  After these mixed messages, The Enforcer (1976) is a return to more solid ground.  Callahan remains a larger than life character, continually at odds with the brass, but his motivation is more personal, after the death of his long time friend Frank DiGeorgio (John Mitchum).

Following in the wake of the recent Patty Hearst's kidnapping by the SLA, the plot features the People's Revolutionary Strike Force (PRSF), a terrorist group who have major plans.  DiGeorgio is knifed, while trying to stop the PRSF from stealing weapons.  Callahan is enraged at the death of his partner, but can't work on the case.  For disciplinary reasons, Callahan has been transferred to the personnel department, interviewing candidates for detective.  Foreshadowing her role in Cagney and Lacy, Tyne Daly stars as Kate Moore, an officer with no street experience who is promoted to inspector, and made Harry's partner.

Much about The Enforcer is cartoonish clich that had been seen in the previous films, but the relationship between Callahan and Moore is something new, and has some sense of realism.  Moore initially struggles with coming to terms with her new job.  Without much guidance from Harry, she slowly evolves from making her first kill, into someone prepared to take charge.  Daly's strong performance connects with the audience, and what happens to Kate Moore probably makes the deepest impression among any of Dirty Harry's partners.

The terrorist group is largely made up of fanatical ultra-violent types, who kill when they don't really have to.  Their kidnapping of the mayor is a bold move, but is a repeat of the ransom theme that was kind of played out in Dirty Harry.  Considering that the terrorists could have blown up city hall or worse, their actions are far less destructive than they could have been.  While it may serve a cinematic purpose, it makes little logical sense for the terrorists to hole up in Alcatraz prison, where they can't make a fast getaway.  There are some decent action scenes on the island, but they are far from spectacular, and seem a little rushed.  Perhaps it's more scaling things down, to a level that Harry can still manage mostly by himself.

Eastwood had planned on directing the film, but was too involved in the post-production of The Outlaw Josey Wales, so the job went to James Fargo, who made his directorial debut.  Jerry Fielding, who also worked on Josey Wales, provides the music, giving the movie a more jazzy feel.  The Enforcer is gratuitously violent, and the plot drifts off course particularly at the end, but overall the film recaptures some of the gritty feel of being on the streets, and steers the series back in a direction slightly closer to the original.  It's a 3.5 star film, rounded up to 4.",1304121600,2,3181,4.926829268292683

If you look at this item's picture (at the top of this web page) you see a `bullet hole' at the end of the gun's barrel.  That hole is NOT part of the picture, it is an actual jagged hole in a clear plastic sleve that slides over the DVD case (the glass cracks are also printed on that sleve).

If you are a collecter of this (Dirty Harry) series and have other movies with that bullet hole sleeve you should be aware that this movie ordered from Amazon will NOT have that sleeve even though it is shown in Amazon's picture.  C'mon Amazon, pay attention to the details.  Either furnish the DVD case WITH the sleeve or correct the picture.

In ""The Enforcer,"" Eastwood again presents the I'll-do-it-my-way San Francisco police inspector, this time teamed with a woman partner, and he's fun to watch. This time, the bad guys involve a group of domestic terrorists out to rob the city of San Francisco and gain a few million dollars by capturing the mayor and holding him hostage for ransom. Somehow, the whole scheme just doesn't ring true. Hopefully, we're through the days of little liberation armies. Maybe it was more believable when the movie came out, but it seems now very dated. Anyway, the bad guys are really bad and Dirty Harry manages to bring them to justice in the most violent of ways. It's a fun, if unrealistic, movie to watch but it has a rather depressing ending.

119756,5,0790751143,"This is the third episode of the saga. The mould was established two films ago and the first variations were introduced in the second episode. Now we have the third episode and the variation is clearly defined.

On one side the group of criminals are politically motivated, like some kind of revolutionary secret army that manages to steal a whole lot of state-of-the-art modern weaponry. On the other side the police who is completely impotent because of the political pressure that imposes women and at the same time a more civil or polite if not courteous way of dealing with criminals and crime. Ms Miranda again. Absolutely Shakespearian!

That of course goes against the grain of what Dirty Harry considers as good police work. The pseudo-revolutionary group kidnaps the mayor of San Francisco, then demands a couple of million and then a helicopter to transport them to the airport where the money will be waiting in a plane that would be ready to take off.

Dirty Harry is provided with a new partner after the killing of the one he had at the beginning and that new partner is a woman. She has to prove herself in the eyes of the famous Dirty Harry. She picks the challenge and she succeeds against all odds.

This time what makes the police inefficient is the political pressures they are suffering from, and that crashes them down. The mayor is saved in extremis by Dirty Harry and his partner, but the partner is killed and the mayor survives for sure but deeply shaken by the method used to liberate him. The main criminal detaining him is purely, truly and authentically blown into smithereens by a rocket launcher just hardly one meter over the head of the Mayor.

In this case it is your best friend who makes the police incompetent. The last touch of the film is the helicopter arriving and announcing the money has been collected and is waiting for ""you"" at the airport along with a plane on its loudspeakers just minutes if not seconds after the killing of the main criminal and the freeing of the mayor. It shows how far behind their own times these modernistic politicians can be.

Your worst enemies are always your best friends.

119771,3,0790751143,"I know there are 5 films with Clint Eastwood playing the ""Dirty Harry"" role,but because of the time between the third and fourth installment and the commercialization of the franchise, I only really look at the three Dirty Harry films from the 70's as part of the series.

I don't need a complexed plot to enjoy a Dirty Harry film. Clint Eastwood acts fine in California based cop flicks with little dialogue as he did in his great Westerns during the 60's. There is decent shot-popping action in ""The Enforcer"" as Callahan and it is surely a watchable and not boring film.

If you are looking for a continuation of the Cop vs. Bureaucracy tale that made the original ""Dirty Harry"" so compelling, you may come away unsatisfied as ""The Enforcer"" tacitly embraces some of the PC stupidity so cleverly attacked in the first go-around. It's a bad move for the franchise and the world introducing future ""Cagney and Lacey"" star Tyne Dailey as Harry's quota-hire female partner. Subtle message here is one of ""gender equality"" and shows Callhan developing deep respect for the lady cop he was reluctant to work with. Maybe Eastwood wanted to do something he hadn't done in the first two Harry flicks and show some sensitivity and maybe even deflect some of the media criticism of his macho and rule bending character. There's not that much of the PC nonsense, but enough to make one wish they took a script another way. Preach in church, not in action movies..
Good villians help me forgive the PC pandering undertone. Lunatic leftist revolutionaries styled after Patty Hearst kidnappers the Symbionese Liberation Army are the culprit here, with a full-70's ambition of helping the poor fight ""the man"" and ""off the pigs"". Nice appearance by Robert Mitchum brother John as a fellow lawman.",1205020800,7,1783,4.842622950819672

The action highlights are rather sparse, with surprisingly few Clint one-liners to enliven the proceedings.

119776,3,0790751143,"As the third entry in the Dirty Harry film series, The Enforcer is probably a little above average in terms of the time spent in watching it.  Yet, it is a bit of a misfire (no pun intended) after ""Dirty Harry"" and ""Magnum Force"".  The character of Harry Callahan returns more to the roots of his original incarnation in the first film, however his presence seems almost wasted here for some unexplained reason.  James Fargo, a long-time member of Eastwood's film-family crew, takes over as director in the third installment of the Dirty Harry saga.

The basic premise of the movie involves a group of self-proclaimed revolutionaries who threaten the city by the Bay, so it's up to Harry to enforce the law and bring them to justice.  At the business-end of a .44 magnum, of course.  The film follows the basic formula of all the other films, as noted below.

The film opens up with a brutal, chilling scene involving a couple of the militants killing two truck delivery men.  Shift to Harry and his current partner, Frank DiGiorgio (John Mitchum, a.k.a. brother of actor Robert Mitchum) who has appeared in the previous 2 Dirty Harry films.  The robbery/hostage scene is the typical Harry-must-establish-his-credentials-for-the-audience, as in the beginning of every Dirty Harry film.  He does so quite effectively here by dispensing with words and creating his own 'mini-Entebbe raid' on the perps and the store (note Joe Spano, a.k.a. Henry Goldblume from ""Hill Street Blues"" as one of the bad guys).

We next find Callahan moved from Homicide to personnel thanks to Captain McKay (Bradford Dillman), which is not to his liking.  Some great dialogue in the personnel board interview scene among all actors involved, and we get introduced to who will obviously become Callahan's new partner, Kate Moore, played by Tyne Daly (sister of actor Tim Daly).  The text of Harry's dislike of political correctness, or 'being stylish' as he puts it, still rings very true today.  In keeping with the previous films, Harry is given a minority person as a partner: Chico the Hispanic-American in Dirty Harry, Early Smith an African-American in Magnum Force, and now a woman. To being saddled with Moore, Harry utters his tag-line for this film ""Marvelous"".  Not as good as ""Do I feel lucky"" or ""Make my day"", or even ""A man's got to know his limitations"", but it's what we the audience are left with. Thus continues the formula.

The People's Revolutionary Strike Force are striking hard, including steeling weapons like LAWS rockets, automatic rifles, and then fatally stabbing Harry's detective friend Frank DiGiorgio who just happened to be in the area while the warehouse robbery was going down.

The city wants to pin the robbery and threat on black militants, but Harry doesn't buy it.  So, when the terrorists kidnap the Mayor, Harry uses every tactic at his disposal to hunt them down.

Throughout the picture, Harry pretty much has disdain for everyone: his superiors, his partner, his informants, the people he questions, the mayor, and even a guy trying to get a free meal at the beginning of the picture.  When Big Ed Mustafa (Albert Popwell, who appeared in 4 of the 5 Dirty Harry films as different characters) says, ""Man, you really are dirty, aren't you"", Harry's answer ""The dirtiest"" is in some ways an understatement, and in other ways incorrect.  He seems more like ""Grouchy Harry"" throughout the film.

There are some excellent lines sprinkled throughout, like ""V.F.W. - very few whites"", ""Why, that's mighty white of you"", and ""Your mouthwash ain't makin' it!"".

Two very glaring errors in The Enforcer are the absence of Lalo Schifrin as composer of the soundtrack and the building-to-building rooftop chase over San Francisco that not only contains rather odd jazz music for such a violent action picture, but also lasts twice as long on screen as it should have.

The final confrontation on Alcatraz Island is exciting and leads to the inevitable death of Harry's partner, again not unexpected given what has been presented to us in the previous two films.

Although exciting in parts, The Enforcer just seemed to have been rushed into production and finished in order to give movie-goers a Dirty Harry film by Christmas.  We are given even less to know about Harry than the previous 2 films, and in some ways he almost seems a caricature of the more despondant, over-worked, not-sure-why-he's-even-doing-this person whom we met in Dirty Harry.  Although a decent action picture, some good lines, and  of course Clint Eastwood all help it, the final result in many ways, ""The Enforcer"" still does not rise to any level other than plain old-fashioned popcorn entertainment, and fairly ordinary popcorn at that.",1168300800,3,4725,4.969504447268107

119779,3,0790751143,"In the first movie in this series, ""Dirty Harry,"" Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) hunted a serial killer.  In the second movie Detective Callahan went after a group of vigilante cops.  To expand the scope of those deserving of Harry's attentions, this movie adds domestic terrorists, who really are little more than glorified kidnappers and thieves.

Clint Eastwood had fully established Harry Callahan's role by this third movie, so most viewers knew what they were getting.  However, near the beginning of the movie several vignettes are offered to show Harry Callahan in all his stylistic glory.  We see Harry kick a man who appears to be having a heart attack, admonishing him to ""get up,"" to the chagrin of bystanders.  We see Harry deal directly and violently with an armed group of robbers by giving them a car when they requested it.  We also see Harry try to make new detective candidates understand the real world while being typically politically incorrect.

While Clint Eastwood is reminding fans of Dirty Harry what kind of person he is, there is a group of people who initially appear to be after some sort of ""power to the people,"" but are in reality being led by Bobby Maxwell to do a bit of old-fashioned murder and mayhem, with the goal being large quantities of money.

Eventually the supposed terrorists and Dirty Harry must intersect, and that intersection is provided by an encounter between the criminals and Inspector Frank DiGiorgio (John Mitchum), Harry's most recent partner.  DiGiorgio and his new partner encounter the robbers at a warehouse containing arms, where they have already killed one man.  When the robbers critically injure DiGiorgio we know that Harry will track them down and bring them to his own unique style of justice.

The movie drags a little while Harry is trying to locate the crooks.  During this time we are treated to Harry's own cold opinion of bumbling politicians and what might be Harry's opinion of women.  One scene to watch for is when his new partner, Inspector Kate Moore (Tyne Daly), stands behinds a LAWS rocket as it is being prepared for test firing.

The movie speeds up again when the crooks kidnap the Mayor (John Crawford) and Harry finally determines they are on Alcatraz Island.  Callahan and Moore head out to bring the bad guys to justice and to rescue the Mayor, with the action remaining constant to the end.

The interactions between Harry and Kate are quite interesting.  Harry has no respect for Kate initially, not because she is a woman, but because she has no experience in the field.  The movie goes out of its way to explain that Harry would treat anyone with Kate's level of experience the same way, male or female.  However, Harry begrudgingly begins to accept Kate as a partner, and by the end of the movie Harry has developed a greater respect for Kate than for the Mayor and all the other politicians in this movie.  The end scene firmly establishing that respect and is one of the rare emotionally moving scenes in the Dirty Harry series.

I have always considered the Dirty Harry movies to be a comparison of how we sometimes perceive criminals are treated versus the way we would like to see them treated, especially considering the violence criminals perpetrate on others.  Of course, such behavior falls into the category of fanciful thought, because Harry's actions often border on being illegal, and in real life it is hard to constrain such violence to the criminals.  Still, these movies can be enjoyable to watch.

This particular movie is dated and the pacing is slow in places.  This movie is well below the level of the original, and is a bit weaker than the second movie.  However, it remains a Dirty Harry movie, and they can be addictive.

Several scenes in this movie are humorous or unbelievable.  When Harry leaves a government building through a metal detector he does not set it off.  When DiGiorgio and his partner approach the warehouse being robbed by the terrorists, why did DiGiorgio continue to proceed once he knew how many people were involved?  Then his partner stands in front of the crooks speeding vehicle as it bears down on him during their escape.  The Mayor's driver should have turned the limousine the opposite direction from the way he turned, and simultaneously called for help, instead of turning the way he did.  However, these implausibilities help set up the confrontation between Harry and the crooks.  Could the plotting have been more believable?  Probably, but that would have required more care in development of the plot, and apparently speed was more important than quality in this movie.",1118188800,,4629,4.860969387755102
119780,4,0790751143,"You gotta give Harry Callahan credit for taking the law seriously.

In this one, Harry goes after a supposed citizen's group who are really nothing more than a bunch of psychopaths killing for money.  This group is even supported by a young Catholic priest, and in one ironic scene, Harry kneels in the communion line just to tick he priest off.  Tyne Daly is very good as Harry's partner, a big issue in the seventies, when female cops were far and few between.  A talented bunch of character actors lend good support:  Bradford Dillman, Harry Guardino, John Crawford and Albert Popwell particularly.  The movie is dated in its music and in some of its philosophies, but the Dirty Harry movies were not meant to be great social commentaries; they were a vehicle for the star power of Eastwood and giving the bad guys their due whether it was politically correct or not.

THE ENFORCER tackles some mid-1970's issues, most notable women being indoctrinated into mainstream law enforcement and the front line men having to accept their presence.  The times they were changing, but Clint keeps Harry Callahan true to the old guard:  when in doubt, shoot.  Plenty of action in this nominal storyline about a group of west coast revolutionaries, who Harry discovers to be just a group of street thugs looking for easy money and piling up bodies along the way for their own enjoyment.  They meet with the rath of Callahan in predictable fashion.  But along the way, you get a first rate performance from Tyne Daley, solid work by Harry Guardino and some hysterical dialogue, whether it was intended to be that way or not.",1105833600,5,805,4.839416058394161
119782,4,0790751143,"In the original ""Dirty Harry,"" Inspector Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) went after a serial killer and in the ""Magnum Force"" sequel he went after vigilante cops.  To balance the latter, with its liberal nightmare, the third film in the series, ""The Enforcer,"" offers up a conservative counterpart by having the villains be long-haired hippie freaks in something called the Ecumenical Liberation Army (i.e., think about Tanya, a.k.a. Patty Hearst, and the SLA).  The obvious point is that when it comes to be judge, jury, and executioner, Dirty Harry does not make distinctions, ideological or otherwise.

On the one hand the villains in ""The Enforcer"" are the weakest of any of the films in the series, but then the ELA is only Dirty Harry's target and not his opponent.  That would be Kate Moore (Tyne Daly).  The film begins with another example of how Dirty Harry has this bad habit of going after criminals on the streets of San Francisco in his own special way (hey, criminals ask for a car, Harry gives them a car), which always gets him punished by being transferred from Homicide to something less fun like the Personnel department, which is where he ends up this time, working on the promotion board.  When he first Moore she is up for a promotion and although he puts her through the wringer, making clear his disdain for the idea that a woman can be a good cop, the politics of the time not only ensure that she gets promoted to fullfill some quota, but the ironic frame of the film means she ends up being Harry's partner when he is put back on the street so that he has a chance to go around and shoot more people, who, this time around at least, tend to start shooting first so that it is more self defense than natural orneriness when Harry starts firing back with greater accuracy and bigger bullets.

Moore surprises Harry because she is not stupid, either in what she says or does, and manages to learn from him despite his attitude and unwillingness to explicitly teacher her anything about the job.  Of course, in due time she actually saves Harry's life and he is forced to mumble something about how he could have a worse partner than Moore.  Of course, in retrospect we are not surprised that Tyne Daly, who went on to win four Emmys (including three in a row) for her consummate performance as Mary Beth Lacey on ""Cagney & Lacey), can hold her own with Clint Eastwood.  Given how laughable the hippie revolutionaries are this film could have ended up being a big joke without her performance and the chemistry she has with the star, which is made all the more impressive by the fact that there is absolute nothing sexual about their relationship.

The best parts of this movie are Harry and Moore establishing their relationship and becoming a team.  These are the scenes that have not only the most humor, as Harry's chauvinism runs into Moore's competence, but also that actually bet beyond the facade of the character of Dirty Harry.  This is what makes many of the action sequences, in contrast, to seem so cartoonish, especially in the film's end game when the mayor is kidnapped and Harry gets to use a bazooka during the final shootout on Alcatraz Island.  It might seem strange that the interpersonal relationship is the best part of a Dirty Harry movie, but that is the part of ""The Enforcer"" that gets five stars, while the violence that was supposed to be the big attraction gets only a three (and the film almost loses another star because of the costumes and music, even more so now that they are both so outdated).",1097884800,10,3553,4.6369426751592355

119784,4,0790751143,"THE ENFORCER is the third entry to the Dirty Harry series. While a good perforance by Eastwood overall, the movie does not quite match up to the Don Siegel-directed original or MAGNUM FORCE, (which I consider his best movie). While THE ENFORCER is not the weakest Dirty Harry movie, it does have the weakest plot. Here Dirty Harry has to save the city of San Fancisco from a group of rebellious punks who are obsessed with heavy artiliary. They call themselves the People's Revolutionary Strike Force, and they are led by Bobby Maxwell, a deranged Vietnam Vet who wants to terrorize the public in exchange for ransom. After slaughtering 2 gas company employees, they break into an artility warehouse to steal the goods. Harry's partner, DeGeorgio arrives on the scene and is killed in the process. While trying to try down DeGeorgio's killer, Harry is assigned a new parter in the form of Kate Moore, (Tyne Daly), a yacking half-pint who wants to impress him in every way possible. Harry doesn't quite agree with the plan, especially when she is on the force just to coincide with the mayor's plans to be ""stylish."" But Moore turns out to be more valuable then he ever imagined, helping lead him to Maxwell, and saving his life twice along the way.
Of all the Dirty Harry films, this one has the most humor. The comments that Callahan makes at the personel review of Moore are hilarious. We also have him driving a car through a liquor store, (continuing with the traditon of breaking up a robbery). Another funny sequence is when he chases Henry Lee Coldwell halfway across the city and back! He follows him over fences, across rooftops, and through skylights, disturbing a porn shooting in the process! Jerry Fielding took over the musical score here, and as a result, the traditional Dirty Harry theme is nowhere to be found. This is rather disappointing and takes away from the movie's serious potential. Fielding's jazzy them is effective during the chase sequence however. These film does suffer from long sequences that really aren't neccessary. The one that will really make you laugh is when Callahan enters a brothel posing as ""Larry Dickman!"" Dirty Harry regular, Albert Popwell, shows up here as a leader of a black militant group.
The Revolutionary Strike Force eventually switches gears by kidnapping the mayor for even more ransom.  Harry is eventually is led to Alcatraz Island, where the mayor is being held captive. The climax on Alcatraz is exciting, but I wish it didn't unfold so fast. The ending is very sad, although I will not give that away. While THE ENFORCER is not up to par with the first two movies in the series, it is still a solid chapter in the book of Dirty Harry. ""Power to the People.""",1081382400,5,2722,4.754756871035941
119785,4,0790751143,"This is the third of five ""Dirty Harry"" films in which Eastwood stars as a San Francisco police detective. By the time the last appeared (The Dead Pool, in 1988), Eastwood had aged and times had changed but Callahan's non-negotiaable values and unorthodox methods had remained essentially the same. What I find especially interesting in this film is the relationship which develops between Callahan and his partner Kate Moore, skillfully portrayed by Tyne Daly. Until now, Callahan has indeed been a ""lone ranger,"" alienated (by choice or circumstance) from his superiors and fellow officers as well as from the criminals whom he pursues with deadly efficiency. Over time, Moore eventually earns Callahan's respect and trust (albeit grudgingly) as they attempt to rescue San Francisco's kidnapped mayor (John Crawford) amidst all manner of mayhem unrelated to that assignment. Credit James Fargo with keeping the narrative flowing smoothly. The supporting cast is solid, notably Bradford Dillman (Captain McKay) and Harry Guardino (Lieutenant Bressler). There is plenty of action, of course, skillfully presented. Despite its lack of much subtlety or nuance, I recommend it to those with a taste for this sort of urban adventure film. Those who enjoy it should also check out Coogan's Bluff and Bullitt (both 1968) as well as The Gauntlet (1977).",1080691200,10,1346,5.323943661971831

Callahan's new partner is a woman, something he does not particularly agree with, and she can barely keep up as Inspector #71 tears through San Francisco looking for the PRA.  The Enforcer (Dirty Harry #3) lacks the grit and energy of the first Dirty Harry and the excessive bullet riddled body count of the second (Magnum Force).  In comparison it almost seems sedate, both visually and in terms of its action content.  What the movie does offer is a solid, if a bit routine, police action thriller story made better than average by its script.  Harry's deathbed visit to the fading Frank DiGiorgio and his snappy relationship with rookie Inspector Kate Moore are both well done.  On the action side of things, fans will no doubt enjoy Harry's unique handling of a hostage situation, a foot chase across San Francisco's rooftops, and the kidnapping of The Mayor.  Recommended.

Dirty Harry, in his dealings with these terrorists, was at no time compassionate, tolerant, diverse or inclusive.  He just seemed to think that killing them was the only way to stop them (which, indicentally, it WAS -- but that's beside the point).  Harry did not at any time take into account any specific cultural or religious motivations which might have prompted the terrorists to kill people, and he seemed to have no regard whatever for their feelings.

And beyond the action, it's a film that manages to make a valid statement about bureaucratic nonsense, as well as the lack of common sense employed by those ensconced in the budding agenda of ""political correctness,"" who put an emphasis on image over purpose and results.  Mostly, though, it gives the audience a chance to share vicariously in the triumph of good over evil, as Harry once again metes out justice in his own inimitable way.
After taking charge and cleaning up a hostage situation in a way that only ""Dirty Harry"" can, Harry (Eastwood) is assigned to a desk job in personnel.  But when his partner, Frank DiGiorgio (John Mitchum) goes down on the job during the robbery of a munitions warehouse, Harry is back on the street, but with a new partner, Kate Moore (Daly), one of the first female inspectors in the country.  And Harry puts her through her paces as they attempt to track down this particularly volatile gang, who seemingly put little value on human life as they cut their swath through the city of San Francisco and pursue their own ""for the people"" agenda, which in reality means they want to get their hands on as much cash as possible, and plan to hold the city hostage to do it.  But they had better think again; because when they took down Frank, they inadvertently provoked the ire of Inspector Callahan himself, who does not take kindly to their sort to begin with.
James Fargo is in the director's chair for this one, and he comports himself well, recapturing all of the attitudes and elements that made the first two ""Dirty Harry"" films so successful.  Fargo sets a good pace and keeps the story on at least an equal footing with the action, which keeps this one involving.  Giving Harry a female partner puts some added interest into the mix as well, in light of the fact that this film was made in an era in which women were just beginning to emerge in such positions, on the screen or otherwise.  ""Cagney and Lacey,"" for instance, was still some five or six years away, and Kathleen Turner's ""V.I. Warshawski"" wouldn't make an appearance until 1991.  Initially,  the film takes something of a patronizing attitude toward her, but Harry treats her as an equal from the beginning, and in the end, Inspector Moore emerges as a strong character, gender aside.  Most importantly, that is not the focus of the filmmakers here, and the fact that Moore is a woman is little more in the overall scheme of things than a footnote in cinematic history; Moore is just another character in the ""Dirty Harry"" saga, and she's a good one (especially when compared to Harry's partner, Al Quan-- played by Evan C. Kim-- in ""The Dead Pool"").  And credit Fargo with insuring that it all blends together naturally within the context of the story, as well as the fact that he keeps the relationship between Callahan and Moore on task, and allows it to develop quite credibly.  All in all, it's a good, collaborative effort from all concerned.
What really gives this one that ring of authenticity, however, is that Clint Eastwood is in top form, and even in his third outing as Harry seems more immersed in the character than ever.  And, in the final analysis, story aside, it's the ""Dirty Harry"" character that makes these films so popular and successful.  Creating a cinematic icon is no easy task, and that's precisely what Eastwood has done with Harry; and it's gratifying to see that he is willing to give that 110% at this stage of the game, in order to maintain the credibility of the character and the films, as well.  A lesser actor would have taken this kind of success to the bank by now, while possibly allowing the character to slip into caricature rather than being concerned with keeping it real and convincing.  It demonstrates what a pro Eastwood is, and why he commands the kind of respect afforded him within the industry.
Taking on the role of Kate Moore had to be a challenge for Tyne Daly, and happily, she succeeds quite well with it.  She makes her character convincing by allowing her to develop in a ""real time"" manner; she doesn't just jump in there, full blown and ready to take on hardened criminals.  Initially, she displays some intimidation in Harry's presence, which gives their relationship some realism from the beginning.  After all, Harry IS an intimidating guy; add to that the fact that this is a new job for Moore, which in reality would create a level of discomfort for anyone, anywhere.  And Daly has tapped into all of that with her portrayal of Moore, making her a very believable character, and one of the most memorable from among the five ""Dirty Harry"" films.
The supporting cast includes Harry Guardino (Lt. Bressler), Bradford Dillman (Capt. McKay), DeVeren Bookwalter (Bobby Maxwell), John Crawford (The Mayor), Samantha Doane (Wanda) and Albert Popwell as ""Big"" Ed Mustapha (look for Popwell in the original ""Dirty Harry"" as the Bank Robber; in ""Magnum Force"" as pimp J.J. Wilson; and again in ""Sudden Impact"" as one of Harry's partners, Horace).  A well made and entertaining film, ""The Enforcer"" keeps the ""Dirty Harry"" series alive, well and on solid ground; in retrospect, it seems a shame now that Eastwood waited seven years to make the next installment, ""Sudden Impact,"" as with the dreadful ""The Dead Pool"" in 1988, it all ended with barely a whimper.  The first four, however, more than make up for it-- and that's the magic of the movies.",1026000000,2,5734,4.734939759036145
119790,5,0790751143,"Personally I think that this is an excellent movie but not for the reasons that you might think.
This is not the best action Dirty Harry movie, nor is it the best for reasons that other reviewers have reiterated elsewhere.
As an entertainment piece it is watchable and even fun, but for me the best thing about the movie is the jibes at the whole politically correct movement.
From the outset at the liquor store, Callahan, although affecting the requires result, does so in a way which costs the city money and which is feared will undermine mayoral initiatives.
Reassigned to Personnel Harry shows up at a promotion board and immediately crosses swords with the mayor's representative who is to supervise proceedings to ensure that there is diversity. The scenario worsens when Officer Moore (Tyne Daly) enters the picture. Callahan is concerned that the job of Inspector is dangerous and politically correct decisions may result in loss of life.
The movie attacks other aspects of life where others fear to tread. The priest who supports revolutionary causes, believing that no-one ought to be killed comes to see the error of his ways, and the search for a key witness sees Harry in the brothel undercover (pardon the pun) discovering the delights of rubber dollies and a reality of the sex industry where punters paying for sex through the mail receive letters signed by elderly women some without teeth.
All told the movie really is a rather vicious attack on the values of our society in the face of a violent reality whether it be from organised crime or from so-called revolutionary groups. It also casts doubt on the so-called principles of such groups, basically viewing them as just another way to get money much like the group in 'Die Hard'.
From that point of view it is an extremely interesting movie and where else to portray such an attack? San Francisco, the capital city of liberal politics. On a final note, the movie really does not have much time for career politicians either, presenting the mayor as being concerned only with image, trying to succour the votes of minorities by playing to their sensibilities rather than coming up with real solutions to real problems and being more concerned with poll findings to determine his direction rather than having a strong character.",1025654400,3,2301,4.887468030690537
119791,4,0790751143,"It should come as no surprise that, after dealing with right wing vigilantes in Magnum Force, SFPD Inspector 'Dirty' Harry Callahan went up again militant left radicals in The Enforcer.
When Harry breaks up a liquor store robbery in his own special way, he gets busted down to the Personnel Department.  The transfer is short lived though, for Harry's former partner is killed when a group of radicals steals a large amount of weaponry.  Saddled with an unwanted female partner, one whose promotion to Inspector is politcally motivated (and in Harry's opinion unsafe), Callahan goes on the hunt.  The political pressure increases when the militants kidnap the Mayor.
The third Dirty Harry adventure, like the previous entries, had been inspired by actual events (the seizing of Alcatraz by a group of Native American activists and the infamous Patty Hearst kidnapping by the SLA), which, in and off itself, lifts it above the average Rogue Cop thriller.  Which is a good thing, for The Enforcer stands out from the other films in the series for all the wrong reasons.  James Fargo's direction is uninspired, the cinematography is flat, and Jerry Fielding's score (while quite good) is no replacement for Lalo Schifrin's now classic themes.  Working in the film's favor is Tyne Daly's performance, Clint Eastwood's charisma, and some rousing action pieces (including a city spanning footchase as opposed to the seemingly ubiquitous car chase).  Fans of both Eastwood and Cop movies should find something to like in this formulaic thriller, recommended.",1007942400,,1551,5.18
119792,3,0790751143,"About a decade before Billy Crystal beat the word to death on SNL, ""marvelous"" became Harry's little catch phrase in `The Enforcer', which I consider to be the weakest entry in the entire `Dirty Harry' saga. The bad guys, a bunch of Symbionese Liberation Front wannabes, didn't exactly put any fear in me. Their leader looked like he'd be more at home hangin' ten down in SoCal than as an urban terrorist. The climax to the obligatory final fight scene at Alcatraz was kinda hokey too. And they also decided to bump off one of the beloved supporting characters that had seen action in the previous two DH flicks. I'll not say who exactly-let's just say he'll not have to worry about ""too much linguine"" anymore.
But, even with these nits, I still find `The Enforcer' to be a passable waste of an hour-and-a-half. Much like the previous & subsequent DH mo-pics, this one features a future notable TV/film star. Tyne Daly, four-time Emmy winner of `Cagney & Lacey' fame, saw her action as a street cop here, as yet another unfortunate partner for Harry.
Then there's my fave moment: the big in-joke. Our anti-hero's talking to Big Ed Mustapha, a Black Pantheresque militant. At one point Harry asks him if they know each other from somewhere. What's the joke, you ask? Well, here you go: The guy who plays Mustapha (Albert Popwell) appeared in the first four DH movies, each time as a different character. He was the bank robber who felt lucky in DH, the pimp in MF, and Harry's partner Horace in the subsequent `Sudden Impact'.
Now on to the DVD's features. The guys at the WB did a really good job fixing up the picture & sound quality for the DVD release. There's far less crud & clutter on the film, and the new sound mix really gives the gunshots good reverb. As for extras, there isn't all that much- a mini-doc covering the making of `The Enforcer', and a trailer.
One final bit of useless trivia: `The Enforcer' is the only DH movie where the soundtrack score was not composed by Lalo Schifrin. Strangely enough, however, one of the members of the bad-guy crew is named Lalo. A coincidence? Probably...

119793,3,0790751143,This movie is probably the worst of all the Dirty Harry movies but you gotta admit it is an orginal set-up.

Make her a woman and then all hell breaks loose. See Harry as he tries to cope with a woman partner and try to stop a bunch of crazy people from threatening peace in San Francisco. This is probably also the most boring Dirty Harry movie also because it seems to take its sweet time getting to where its supposed to be going.

Harry is more hard edged than in ""Magnum Force"" and there are some wonderful scenes here, like when he foils a liquor store robbery by driving his car through the store window (after the punks demanded a getaway car) or when he questions a suspect while smashing a toilet plunger in his face.  Tough cop Frank ""Fatso"" DiGeorgio (John Mitchum) has his last stand here.  Lalo Schifrin's score is sorely missed, although he returned for the next two sequels.

119798,5,0790751143,"""The Enforcer"" from 1976 (the bicentennial year),the third ""Dirty Harry"" flick,(considered by many to be one of the all time classic detective films,The American Film Institute and The Library Of Congress' National Film Registry included),is a really good flick too. It came out at Christmas like the others and was a big hit at the box office. The screenplay was written by the late Dean Riesner who co-wrote the original ""Dirty Harry"" and the late Stirling Silliphant, (Academy Award winner in 1967 for the crime drama ""In The Heat Of The Night"" and he co-wrote the disaster flicks ""The Poseidon Adventure"" from 1972 and ""The Towering Inferno"" from 1974). I first saw ""The Enforcer"" in the theater when it was first released(in the same place I saw both ""Dirty Harry"" and ""Magnum Force"",my hometown of Arlington,Virginia),and the movie still holds up after more than 40 years. It became one of the most popular of the series. It was on both the ABC & NBC television networks and was broadcast more than a half a dozen times,a sign of a ratings winner. A then relatively unknown Tyne Daly gives a believable performance in her role. Back then in the mid '70's she was one of the first women detectives portrayed on screen along with Raquel Welch in ""Fuzz"" with Burt Reynolds, Angie Dickinson's ""Police Woman"" and ""Charlie's Angels"".This was several years before she became known as Detective Lacy in CBS's ""Cagney & Lacy"" back in the '80's for which she was an Emmy Award winner. In an article in TV Guide in August 2000,Ms. Daly revealed that she turned the part of ""Inspector Kate Moore"" down a few times because she thought the part was too cartoonish..However,Clint Eastwood talked her into doing it after he decided to expand her role and let her in on the action.

The picture was directed by James Fargo,who had been an Assistant Director on Clint Eastwood's previous film ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" that was released just six months earlier. He also had been Assistant Director on some other Eastwood films and two of then unknown Steven Spielbergs' earliest films,""The Sugarland Express"" and ""Duel"".And, he was Production Manager on ""Jaws"".""The Enforcer"" was James Fargo's first film as Director. The picture has fine cinematography and makes good use of the San Francisco locations. I missed composer Lalo Schifrin's jazz-rock fusion music. He was unavailable at the time. The late Jerry Fielding's jazz score is good though. Mr. Fielding had been nominated for an ""Oscar"" for Best Original Score for ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"". The film's plot involves an underground terrorist group who called themselves ""The People's Revolutionary Strike Force"",(probably modeled  after The Symbianese Liberation Army), led by a Vietnam War vet named Bobby Maxwell, who was kicked out of the Army on a Section 8,for being a psychopath. Maxwell,(effectively played by the late DeVeren Bookwalter),now a Pimp,along with two of his girls,Nikki and Wanda and his buddies Carl, Lalo,Tex and Caldwell;rob a armored warehouse; stealing machine guns,explosives and LAWS rockets;wrecking havoc and demanding millions from the city or else. It's rated R for violence and language, for more mature audiences.

Some trivia; the original title was ""Moving Target"";then ""Dirty Harry 3"";then they decided on ""The Enforcer"" which was also the title of a Humphrey Bogart movie from 1951 also from Warner Bros.;(one of Clint Eastwood's favorites.) The late John Mitchum,who played Harry's occasional partner, Detective Frank ""Fatso"" DiGeorgio in all three pictures,is the brother of Robert Mitchum. He was a year younger.
James Fargo went on to direct ""Every Which Way But Loose"" two years later in 1978,which was Clint Eastwood's biggest box-office hit,adjusted for inflation. Not adjusted,it's ""Gran Torino"". The late Albert Popwell plays the leader of a militant group, (modeled after ""The Black Panthers""), who helps Harry out on the case because Caldwell is one of his men and Harry had arrested him for exploding a bomb at Police Headquarters.

  ""The Enforcer"" was meant to be the final film of a trilogy;like ""The Man With No Name"" trilogy, ""A Fistful of Dollars"", ""For A Few Dollars More"" and ""The Good,The Bad and The Ugly"", back in the mid 1960's, which made Clint Eastwood a movie star. There have been many trilogies since. ""The Godfather"" trilogy; ""Shaft"" ; the ""Star Wars"" trilogy; the ""Batman"" trilogy; the ""Back To The Future"" trilogy to name a few. ""The Enforcer"" was the biggest moneymaker at the box-office of all the ""Dirty Harry"" flicks. The famous film critics Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel who had a movie review program for over 20 years, first on PBS,then for The Walt Disney Company and belonged to The American Film Institute; did a special on the ""Dirty Harry"" movies back in 1984,called ""The Force Behind The .44"". I have this special in my video collection. They were both Eastwood fans. Ebert said,""that cop movies were a dime a dozen and cop T.V. shows were a dime for six dozen and the ""Dirty Harry"" movies were the most successful cop movies ever made."" ""And,Clint Eastwood was the most popular movie stars in the world."" That's when N.A.T.O.,(The National Association of Theater Owners),kept track of the top box-office stars. John Wayne,Steve McQueen,Paul Newman. Robert Redford,and Burt Reynolds were also on the list,(names lost on the younger generation.) Since then,""Beverly Hills Cop""; ""Lethal Weapon""; ""Robocop"" and ""Die Hard"" came along in the 1980's and have made more money,however Inspector Harry Callahan was the inspiration for them and those weren't any better. I've had ""The Enforcer"" since the 1980's,first on Beta,then VHS and now on DVD and in the widescreen format and DOLBY Digital it's better than ever. Thanks again Warner Bros.

7791740,4,0790751143,"Released in 1976 and directed by James Fargo, ""The Enforcer"" stars Clint Eastwood in the eponymous role as a no-nonsense San Francisco detective, who teams-up with a novice female partner (Tyne Daly) to take down a terrorist organization made up of disgruntled Vietnam veterans.

Im a fan of all five of the Dirty Harry films, which are as follows: ""Dirty Harry"" (1971), ""Magnum Force"" (1973), ""The Enforcer"" (1976), ""Sudden Impact"" (1983) and ""The Dead Pool"" (1988).

""Magnum Force"" is my favorite, a rare case where the sequel is superior to the original. My second favorite is the nigh-surreal Sudden Impact while the first film is my least preferred, although I still like it. I just think the stories in the four sequels have more story drive. Dirty Harry seems languid and hollow by comparison, but it gets points for being the original film and establishing the series.

The Enforcer starts out with a bang on a couple of fronts with perfectly-sculptured Jocelyn Jones being a highlight, although her character is a bit of a biyatch. Unfortunately her role is rather small. The twist with this third installment is the addition of a female partner for Harry and their relationship nicely develops. You find yourself really caring for both, especially her. The Enforcer ups the ante with the violence and theres a cool, albeit contrived, final act on Alcatraz Island.

THE FILM RUNS 96 minutes and was shot in the San Francisco Bay area.  THE SCRIPT was written by Stirling Silliphant  & Dean Riesner with the additions by a few others. ADDITIONAL CAST: Harry Guardino returns as Lt. Bressler while Bradford Dilford appears as the Chief and John Crawford as the mayor. DeVeren Bookwalter & Michael Cavanaugh play the lead psychos while Albert Popwell is on hand as the leader of a black gang that Harry (sort of) befriends.
