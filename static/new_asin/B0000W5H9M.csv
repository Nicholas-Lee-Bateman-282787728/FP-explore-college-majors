1957262,5,B0000W5H9M,"Having played against C.B. West I know the dedication those players had for that great coach and that team. The tradition that team has develop over the past 30 years is breath taking! In 9th grade when USA Today ranked West #5 in the nation, and I first saw this team play, there was know way in the world you could have told me this was a high school team. The size, speed, and raw talent of those players were just unbelievable! West was just an unstoppable team all you could do was just watch in amazement. What a coach, Pettine was just top notch! Probably the best coach to ever coach the game at the high school level! What can I say about this movie! If you are any kind of sports fan get this movie! The lesson of football can be emulated to any game! Just go out and get this movie, it is truly amazing! Being a Pennsbury Guy! Go Falcons!(...)",1088726400,5,854,4.213414634146342

1957264,5,B0000W5H9M,Man how I miss the Pettine days. Hollywood could not script this. It has to be one of the top 3 football documetaries or movies of all time!!!!,1186531200,2,143,4.142857142857143
1957265,5,B0000W5H9M,"""The Last Game"" relates a rich human story while taking us into the surprisingly ruthless, disciplined world of high school football. This riveting, highly personal film fascinates on several levels: the brutal sense of competition felt even at the high school level (Coach Pettine is no pussycat); the senior Pettine's struggle to decide whether it's time to close his admirable run as coach; and finally, the unusual, awkward dynamic of father and son going head to head as rival coaches. Surprisingly gripping and intense, ""The Last Game"" is one match-up you won't soon forget.",1185321600,3,580,5.180851063829787
1957266,5,B0000W5H9M,The best football documentary ever made.  I've seen them all and they cannot even come close to the feel of this movie.  If I did not know any better I would think this film was fully scripted.,1182124800,3,193,4.1891891891891895
1957267,5,B0000W5H9M,This is by far the best football movie/documentary I have ever seen.  It is hard to believe that this story is actually true; in fact if I didn't see it with my own two eye I would not believe it.  This film was brilliantly filmed and beautifully done!  If you like high school football or even football in general this movie is for you!  I highly recommend this film to everyone! You won't be able to leave you seat!!,1173398400,3,418,4.253164556962025
1957268,4,B0000W5H9M,"This entertaining documentary really fits the bill for football fans - and for the families who follow and support high school athletes.  It's the inside story of an entire season of championship football in Eastern PA.  Infrequently, weak reality-TV camera work zeroes in too much on the less-than-inspiring star player.  But overall, the story merits its current popularity in a medium thin on family choices.",1168387200,2,411,5.292307692307692
1957269,2,B0000W5H9M,"I remember when this ran on ESPN2 during the week between Christmas & New Year's back in 2000. I'm a huge fan of the microgenre of football movies...but this one stays at the bottom of the barrel.

Pettine Sr. seems like a class act & worthy of the respect ""local legend"" high school football coaches deserve. His son, Pettine Jr, coaches at the rival school but lacks the charisma to make this documentary work.  Maybe the footage of him not seeming like a dolt didn't record right & thus we have no reason to root for him or his program at the finale. Rather than having a bittersweet moment at the ending after the dad plays the head-to-head season finale against the son, Pettine Jr seems kinda clueless giving the old guy a half-hearted handshake.  So much for paternal respect & love.

Had the potential to be great w/the setup. But don't let the glowing summary trick you...there's no emotional payoff to speak of for ""The Last Game.""  Football, after all, has driven grown men to tears on numerous occassions. Your time would be better spent watching Brian's Song, Rudy or the NBC series ""Friday Night Lights."" Even reruns of MTV's ""Two-a-days"" about Hoover of Alabama would be superior if you prefer the doc/reality TV style.",1160006400,,1234,4.694444444444445
1957270,3,B0000W5H9M,"Sorry folks but I disagree with the glowing reviews and wished somebody would have warned me.  This movie is okay and nothing more.  Granted I am a sports mom who bought this movie for teenage sons.  We watched this as a family and the only thing that impressed all of us was the poor attitude of the players.  We are Hawkeyes and gave thanks that not a one of them ended up here.  I blame it on the writing and the cinematography as I have to believe that Coach Pettine is better than the clips this movie chose.  The action footage and editing are 3rd rate compared to Friday Night Lights or Miracle.  Here is an opportunity to view a coach as a teacher and mentor but not much coaching is shown...just a lot of yelling and, not being from Pennsylvania, we did not get a clue as to whether Coach Pettine and his staff actually knew much about football.  Coach must know what he is doing because of his winning record but this movie only filmed him as a pushy, little screamer.  By the end, we were rooting for his team to lose particularly when the Erie Prep team they were playing had players that eventually ended up in Iowa.  Anyway, this movie appeared to be somebody's rookie effort at movie making.  Maybe you have to be from Pennsylvania and interject your own images to make it better.",1135555200,3,1295,4.376569037656904
1957271,5,B0000W5H9M,"This movie starts off a bit slowly with some character building and some background views of the area and the football program, but before long you can see where its all heading, to a big showdown, Father v Son, undefeated CB West, against the only other team that seems able to hold a candle to them, coached by the son of their Coach.

Great footage of that match , and then each step down the State Championship road gets more exciting and more intense.",1123459200,6,456,4.428571428571429

I wanted to see the behind the scenes of that season and I was amazed at the entire movie. Personally to see that particular team and the perfection they had off the field, ABSOLUTE mistake free football I was amazed at how the players acted off the field. It was like watching two different worlds. It also shows how great of a coach Pettine Sr, really is. The movie is terrific in every aspect.

8003969,5,B0000W5H9M,A great window into the inner workings of high school football. The video clearly shows how football at CB West became legend and remained successful for so long. The character profiles demonstrate the importance of the relationships between teammates and coaches and how much participation in sports and other extra curricular activities can contribute to the growth in maturity of high school students.,1323907200,,404,5.428571428571429

All I want to say:

1) I hate sports

2) I hate football

3) I love movies

4) I was forced to watch it... and think it is better than SPELLBOUND, or any MICHAEL MOORE film,
or even HOOP DREAMS, which is the only other sports film I respect fully.

I went to a great school, and majored in film history for criticism work.

I know great docs- this is the best one I have ever seen- they were VERY lucky and very TALENTED
to focus on family and flaws--- not just football.

Thought I'd pick it up cheap here at Amazon, but the movie arrived in an open case and contained a blank DVD rather than the actual movie.

8003973,5,B0000W5H9M,"This video gives a great insight into the CB West program under coach Pettine during his tenure. It illustrates Coach Pettine's coaching style as well as the impact football has made on his family. Coach Pettine is not afraid to call a player out when their performance is less than desirable or when they are not focused. He is also very hard, but fair, on his ""star"" players when they need to be disicplined or motivated.  As for his family, the video shows how football has impacted his relationship with his son, wife, and grandchild. It also shows how Coach Pettine learned and grew from these experiences. Without going into too much detail about the film, let me say that it was a great video documentary that showed why CB West experienced so much successful under Coach Pettine's tenure, and how coaching football impacts the life of the coach. This video is a must see for any aspiring footall coach!",1264032000,,910,4.6875

8003975,4,B0000W5H9M,"Having lived in central Bucks County for most of my life, I will admit to a complete bias toward this cinema verite style documentary, created by Alex Weinress and Patrick Murray; who follow the football team at Central Bucks West High School, located in Doylestown Pa, during their 1999 season. Mike Pettine, CB West's legendary (in high school football circles); head coach; gives the filmmakers carte blanch to follow the Bucks everywhere as their season unfolds. When the entire season suddenly seems to hinge on one play, they are right there as well. You'll just have to watch the movie if you want to know more about this item, though. Suffice to say that unbiased viewers; even those who have little interest in sports; may find themselves vicariously living and dying with the fortunes of these CB West kids as they fight for their third consecutive State Championship.

Though biased I can't fathom some of the criticism leveled at this movie. At first glance the drill sergeant-like attitude Coach Pettine exhibits toward his players may seem petty and demeaning, but anyone actually following the movie will certainly note his explanation for this. He knows that if they can take his verbal punishment they can then take the psychological battering leveled by opposing teams. A good example of this can be seen in the way the West players respond in a crucial game against BecaHi (Bethlehem Catholic High School) when they (strategically, it seems) adopt a no respect attitude toward the Bucks. BecaHi's blue collar kids, many of whose fathers and grandfathers must have worked at the steel mill in town before it closed, make it clear from the git go that they aren't in awe of Pennsylvania's supposed #1 team one bit; nor of nationally ranked fullback Dustin Picciotti. At one point after a play has ended, and while Picciotti's back is partially turned toward him, one of BecaHi's smaller players nonchalantly throws a shoulder into Picciotti while walking back to the huddle--what cohones! Conversely, Coach Pettine brooks no such behavior on the part of his players, whom he would rather see respect the other team while grinding them into the turf. In any event, BecaHi's psych-out ploy temporarily throws a wrench into the CB West machine during the first half of the game, but the Bucks then steel themselves and regain their form. Pettine's approach is vindicated. (This doesn't necessarily mean they win the game of course!) In another scene we see three West players walking out to the field before a game with Neshaminy High School, a contest described by the coach as a kind of midseason championship game. The kids are lightheartedly singing the words to the pop tune ""Leaving on a Jet Plane"" together. No game face on at all! It's as though Pettine's practices are so tough, the game itself is sometimes a breeze.

I mentioned earlier that Coach's ""tough-as-nails"" attitude toward his players is employed to enable in them the poise necessary to win games against topnotch opponents. This doesn't mean however, that the stereotype of the ""tough but fair"" high school coach is realized in Pettine who at times can be a perfect petty tyrant, screaming questions during games at slacking players; who; when they try to answer, are cut off with in-your-face insults--epithets really. He also isn't above berating his own coaching staff--right in front of his players, sadly. If viewers remember however, that they are watching a documentary, they can see that the filmmakers, with their fly-on-the-wall point of view, aren't trying to put Mr. Pettine up as a knight in shining armor. It must be admitted too, that the coach is a pretty complex individual. He readily concedes during one of his voiceovers in the film that football games mean little in the greater scheme of things; quite an eyebrow raising statement from a man you'd assume would maintain a ""winning is everything"" philosophy. In another telling scene, as the CB West kids find their backs against the wall near the end of a crucial game, several players are standing along the sideline in a semi-circle around the coach. He's imploring them to step up to the plate now that their best player, Dustin Picciotti, has exited the game with a twisted ankle. Through an uncanny coach-to-team flow of inspiration, he instills in these players the confidence in their abilities at that moment, a quantity absolutely necessary if they are to emerge victorious.

I wish I could describe the look in these kids' eyes as they hang on Coach Pettine's every word. I'll just say it's worth the price of the DVD alone.

In another segment filmed surreptitiously by an effectively hidden camera, the coach is shown to be quite a stand up guy. While relating to a college scout how this documentary originated Pettine explains that after he had conceded to the two filmmakers the privilege of filming the team, he was approached by an ESPN representative, coincidentally, to make a similar film. When Coach told the ESPN rep he'd  already committed to Weinress and Murray, the rep replied, ""Hey, this is ESPN!"" Coach stood his ground however, and mentioned that although CB West was the #1 ranked team in Pennsyvania, #2 was league rival North Penn coached by his son Mike Pettine Jr, and that they might want to film that team; which they ended up doing.

When CB West then hosts North Penn for the league championship we see the first real tension in the film developing. The Philadelphia Daily News devotes a good part of its sports section to hyping the game; a perfect storybook match-up. We see the West players walking from the gym toward the battleground; the stands at War Memorial Field utterly filled to overflowing; five deep in the SRO areas; earsplitting bedlam even before the game's start, with the berserk North Penn students hurling epithets, some quite creative, at the CB West players. (Some of the North Penn rooters hold up signs that read ""FTB"".) (!) All this against the backdrop of  the voiceover of a local TV channel's sports announcer: ""....tonight it's for all the marbles.... father versus son....game of the century....""  Again; if you need to know more; buy the movie!

The North Penn games themselves (there are two, actually), make a nice prelude to the contests that follow. As I mentioned, these Bucks are usually loose before a game, most of which they typically win by scores of 40 to 10 or so. The irony here is that this team can be crippled by their own talent since as they meet stiffer competition, they find themselves in unfamiliar waters. This kind of drama, which takes place in spades toward the end of the season; is well capitalized on by the two filmmakers, who, though working with a shoestring budget, seem to have done a good editing  job. Anyone paying close attention throughout will be rewarded handsomely upon realization that these dramatic developments (created by the natural playing out of reality--the best kind), have been foreshadowed or ""flashbacked"" by the filmmakers. In one segment a potentially crushing development for CB West takes place as three of their best players leave another crucial game with injuries. In a flashback we then see a 4th string halfback griping about not getting enough practice time. Now he's given a chance to prove himself. Will he rise to the occasion? Or will he tragically; heartbreakingly; crumble under pressure? In an earlier segment shot during practice, Coach is yelling at #20, Andrew Elsing, showing him how to perform a certain gridiron feat. Later....

At this point it becomes hard to argue anymore for the legitimacy of the film's ""highlight reel as unfolding drama"" approach without ruining it for potential viewers.

I personally found the suspense toward the end of the film nearly unbearable.",1221955200,2,7781,4.940366972477064
