3657545,4,B001JAHQ0W,"Finally, Warner Bros. seems to have sped up their release of ER seasons on DVD!

Season 11 includes Ray Liotta's emmy winning tour de force in ""Time of Death"", a real time episode following the final 43 minutes of his character's life. Alex Kingston, Ming Na and Noah Wyle exit County General. Other guest stars include Red Buttons, Danny Glover, Cynthia Nixon, Francis Fisher and Sharif Atkins.

Season 11 of ER includes some of the series' most memorable patient storylines. New doc Ray Barnett (Shane West) juggles medicine and music,
Sam and Luka continue their turbulent relationship, and Corday is punished for performing an illegal operation. There is much to like about season 11, so why only four stars?

While season 11 is very good, certain episodes leave something to be desired. Having Sharif Atkins return as Dr. Gallant was a good idea, but
actually having an episode take place in Iraq made the show wander too far from County General. I liked the Gallant-Neela-Iraq storyline, but
if I wanted to watched Baghdad ER, I would. Also, Carter unfortunately ends up with Kem. Some people like her, others don't. I think she's O.K., but nothing more. And the so-called cliffhanger with Sam's son at the end of the season didn't have me on the edge of my seat, and only led to a dull season 12 premiere.

Now that I got all that outta the way, I can say that the rest of the stories, performances and medical cases are top notch ER. I'm looking forward to July 14th!",1237507200,19,1475,4.683397683397684
3657546,5,B001JAHQ0W,"ER Season 11 (2004-2005) is the final season for Dr. Elizabeth Corday played by Alex Kingston, Dr. Jing-Mei Chen played by Ming-Na, and Dr. John Carter played by Noah Wyle.

ER Season 11 (2004-2005) also introduces Dr. Ray Barnett played Shane West.

Speaking of predictable, the storyline got to the point where we were turning it on and saying, ""well, let's see what terrible thing is going to happen to who, this time.""
At this point, we were watching it just to finish the series.",1473206400,3,390,4.666666666666667

3657597,5,B001JAHQ0W,"This ER series rises way above simple entertainment. It makes a case for creative freedom. The challenges of an inner city ER are explicity shown. Each day is an adrenalin high. BUT, The politics of running an ER within the structure of a big hospital with budgets, politics, personalities all constrict the Doctors creative freedom in dealing with patients. Beginning with the African episodes the opportunity for creative freedom is further explored. Go where you are needed. Where the controls of the big inner city hospitals arnt in place. Granted that has its plus sides and minuses. If a Doctor wants to spend more quality time with a patient they are free to do so. They won't be fired on the spot. It{s different.

3657612,3,B001JAHQ0W,"This season is not as appealing as the previous ones. Nevertheless, if you are followed the series you cannot miss this season because it continues with the members of the hospital stories and it give a very good idea about life inside the emergency room. In my opinion several characters are less structured as Carter or Abby, and the conflict between Kovack and the nurse is not well develovep because there are not explanation in their relation seesaw. But, nevertheless, I enjoyed watching it",1392768000,,496,4.916666666666667
3657613,5,B001JAHQ0W,"I now have the advantage of reviewing ER seasons after having watched all 15.and I'm happy to say that this episode sets the stage for what is good about the final third of the show. The best addition to the cast, although not as a regular, is Leland Orser, as Dr. Lucian Dubenko. He is similar in character to Wm. H. Macy's character in the first five episodes, but with greater day to day involvement. The difference between an average and an outstanding season can often rest with the major guest stars. This season has Red Buttons in two episodes, and I have never seen him better. Cynthia Nixon is in a one episode appearance. Like her guest appearance on Law and Order, SVU, it is stunning. The episode starring Ray Liotta is similar to a previous year's episode starring James Woods. But not quite as good as the Woods episode.

Some of the regular cast members' story arches are a bit weak, such as when Dr. Archie Morris is selected as chief resident, simply because no one else wanted the job. It's odd that Scott Grimes, who plays Archie, is not listed as a lead actor yet. The best new face is Shane West. The addition of Sharif Atkins and the story ark with his character and Neela is engaging, but not as good as others.

It seems as if Maura Tierney and Goran Visnjic are settling in to be the focus of the last third of ER",1390176000,2,1338,4.3694779116465865

3657630,5,B001JAHQ0W,"For those who want a almost perfect review, read the review by author ""Amanda"".  I can not think of much to add after reading what she wrote. For this season you need to read her review. What i will say i while the writing has changed, you have to remember this is its 11th season, and went to its 15th season.  So after ten seasons you have to expect changes. As a die hard fan, this season was very hard to watch. I think the writing was good. I was more than happy with the writing.  And for the record, i think some of its best seasons came after George Clooney left. Although i will give him the credit he is due with the episode where he saves a young boy from drowning. It was not long after that he left the show. People thought the show would tank. It got better. Season 8 is a standout for me, with Dr. Green leaving County General, and the show. The idea of ending a character through death really bothers me. But in this case, although it was brutal, season 8 is one of its best. The major theme was Dr. Green and his brain tumor.  Along with some side line themes.

Season 11 for me was good, but very depressing. It was the end of what i think is the single most loved and best character of the show. Dr. Carter.  Noah Wyle leaves the show for good with some guest appearances.  Nobody would have guest that he would become one of the most loved characters of the show and for me, the most loved. His relationship with Dr. Benton over the early years, as mentor and student, really gave you a closeness to these characters. So in this season 11, to watch him go was very hard. Almost in a way where ER for me was never the same. Still a great show, the numbers did great, new fans had new characters to watch and grow up with.  But for day one fans, a very hard season to watch. I also do not like the send off they gave the character DR. Carter.  His send off party filled with nobody we knew, including a janitor.  Why would he be there. Even Carter asked who he was?  Dr. Kovac was there to give the toast, but in ER fashion a massive tragedy hits and they all leave to go back to the ER except Carter where he watches old clips on a projecter with the guy he did not know. And in the end, he says good bye to three people. Neela, Abby, and the New Dr. who's name is escaping me. Sorry?  It was a tear jerker as he reads a letter he had written to himself when he first started. Another tribute to Dr. Greene as it was Greene who was Carter's mentor after leaving surgery. The letter was sad, he gives it to abby, and in a way he is saying goodbye to her. I thought his character deserved a much better send off.  Dr. Greene had a whole season for his send  off.  To this day nobody can watch that and not cry. Carter deserved much better.

Then the season i think where the writing was really  bad, was season 12?  Carter falls in love in Africa, and him and his wife end up splitting. I won't go into why. I feel they took Carter and just made his whole life a mess. All the way up until the end, there was nothing good for Carter except his foundation for the poor.  Which was great. But Carter was not happy with his life. The writers gave him nothing. A show about compassion,life, and love, and Carter had little of any of it. He ended up where he started in the 15th season in the last episode. At county general ER.  Season 11 also has Ray Liotta in an episode ""Time of Death"".  If you watch nothing else?  You must watch this episode in season 11.  Ray won an emmy for this character.  He plays a alcoholic, dying, and it's done in real time, and before he dies he tries reaching out to his son.  Not a soul who watched this was left with a dry face void of tears.  Overall, Carter leaves, you have a great cast, but still you miss the old cast. you cant help it after eleven years.  So i think the great new cast and the writing gets lost because you miss the originals so much. Season 12 I don't watch. They destroy Carter's life. So there was no joy in that for me. If your a ER fan, Or new to the show, I say you start with season 1 and go forward.

You cant go wrong with one of the best drama's of all time. 15 years on the air?  and in the end still wanting more?  I think that speaks volumes. So season 11 is like most seasons. Worth watching, and new things to love about the show. Like i said in the beggining, if you want a perfect review, read ""Amanda"" review. I only disagree with her about the writing not being all that great. I think we just missed the old cast, and Carter leaving, it was just a bit hard for die hard fans. But her review was just about perfect and spot on.  My review is nowhere as good as i don't think anyones is as good as hers. Rent it, buy it, i own ever season on dvd.  And i still watch them to this day. I wish it was still on. enjoy....",1364515200,5,4806,4.036919831223629

3657640,5,B001JAHQ0W,"ER was an amazing series and as with all series to have one end is sad..This season was excellent, but i did not like the switching to Iraq episodes, as i do not like the Africa episodes. Seems like the regulars in the show get fewer and fewer, as the show progresses to the end which is sad. I really think ER was at its best when Doug..Mark..Benton..Carol..etc were there. I do not care much for the character Sam and seems like Kovak can never decide which woman he wants. It is disappointing to see Carter leave to go back to Africa and seems like Kem does not really care for him or love him, or she would have stayed with him. The baby dies, so she takes off not caring one bit about him. I have never seen ER all the way through, so am anxious to buy the last 4 seasons...Overall..The medical procedures are realistic, as well as showing the private struggles of the Doctors and Nurses..always suspenful..sometimes sad...One of the best TV series, I think that was ever shown.",1332028800,,983,4.406593406593407

3657654,2,B001JAHQ0W,"ER: Season Eleven

On July fourteenth Warner Home Video released season eleven of this immensely popular series ER, and though season eleven marks the last for popular regulars Ming Na as Dr. Jing Mei ""Deb"" Chen, Alex Kingston as Dr. Elizabeth Corday, Sherry Stringfield as Dr. Susan Lewis, and Noah Wylie as Dr. John Carter, their respective exits were anticlimactic at best, if even acknowledged at all.  This season certainly represented a changing of the guard, unfortunately, with writing that took a step down from season ten, and one dimensional performances, said guard changing came a season too late.

Season Eleven was one of conflict.  Some in the relationships within the show, but more so in the factions that existed within the cast and writers.  Attempts to write stories for the cast members that had been with the show longer yielded poor results, and simply not enough storylines were given to burgeoning stars such as Shane West as Dr. Ray Barnett and Scott Grimes as Dr. Archie Morris.  The performance of Grimes on ER would prove to be under appreciated throughout his tenure on the show, as he brought a comedic element to the show worthy of The Office, long before it was a hit.

In season twelve, the writers would set things right as more storylines are dedicated to the people the fans want to see, and storylines such as the relationship between Luka (Goran Visnjic) and Sam (Linda Cardellini) are done away with in favor of those less annoying such as Luka and Abby (Maura Tierney).  Nonetheless, much awkwardness is endured throughout season eleven.

Quality guest appearances are also few and far between in season eleven, and though Ray Liotta garnered an Emmy for his performance in Episode six ""Time of Death"", it was the writing and directing worthy of awards more than the limited performance of Liotta.  Legendary actor Red Buttons gives a superior performance as Jules ""Ruby"" Rubadoux the husband of a former patient of a young Dr. Carter, who is now in the ER as a patient and wants nothing to do with the Doctor that he believes killed his wife.  Cynthia Nixon gives a fine performance as a stroke victim in episode fifteen ""Alone in a Crowd"".  The writing in ""Alone in a Crowd"" is reminiscent and as innovative as an episode of MASH. We are also introduced to Charlie Pratt (Danny Glover), father of ER Doc Greg Pratt.  Like much of the cast, Glover would have more opportunities to truly display his acting chops in season twelve.

Not much to be said of the performances of the regular cast member in season eleven, though Maura Tierney gives a credible performance when she is kidnapped in episode ten ""Skin"" which would have made a far superior season finale than that of ""The Show Must Go On"" in which we are left wondering what will become of Sam's runaway son Alex (Oliver Davis).

Where as previous releases have included Gag reels as part of the bonus material, season eleven only provides outpatient outtakes and unaired scenes, the majority of which were justifiably left on the cutting room floor.

Recommendation: Season eleven simply as not as good as season nine or twelve.  There is probably enough here for the true fan, but little for those not truly hooked.  Better that you check out of the ER for a year rather than checking out ER season eleven.",1248652800,15,3308,4.773684210526316

8312745,3,B001JAHQ0W,"Distinct dip in quality this season. In previous seasons, things happened. This season, people sat around and thought about things that happened, and maybe talked about those things, and gave long faces to each other. Linda Cardellini is a lovely and wonderful actress, but I found the Lindsay Weir attitude on a health care professional off-putting and grating. Kovac's schtick is also getting old by this point, and the two of them together are on-screen cyanide.

There's some good Chicago stuff to see, and some interesting backstory on Weaver (because...?) and also on Pratt... but a shortage of doctoring by both of them. And poor Abby has no brother or mother or Carter - she's basically an upturned mop in a bucket in the corner that has an MD now. We hadn't appreciated the ensemble cast until it got blasted to bits. The season started out with a car in the water and went on to have nothing else cool happen.

Medical shows are still trying to do the dual-location doctor/soldier/cowboy plot, despite how badly it failed for Sharif Atkins' character here and has failed on every show that's tried it since (most recently Night Syria Shift).

The finale event was ripped from the headlines. I remember when that deck fell in Chicago, not far from where I lived. Every deck built since has bolts as heavy-duty as possible. I don't think it's a regulation, but even a bad landlord doesn't want to see that happen again.

Get ready for seasons 12-15, The Life Support Years. They didn't want to have to put the show on a vent, but they did.",1500595200,,1547,4.697416974169742
