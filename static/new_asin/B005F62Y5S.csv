8469645,1,B005F62Y5S,"I give this freaking messed up game and deserves  zero stars. Anyone who gave stars must be being paid. The active  makes you buy equipment that is cheaply made. The activities mess up, such as squats you do 12 of them and then you do something else, and the game returns to squats and it does not like your squats this time. This game sucks",1431820800,,341,4.230769230769231

8469647,3,B005F62Y5S,"The exercise are good, however, it requires the use of the leg strap or at least something to hold the nun-chuck on your leg.  It is not very good at counting reps either, and unless it counts the total number of reps you can be doing upright rows for all eternity until it senses the complete set.  I thought it was the sensing bar, tried getting a new one, I also tried changing batteries in the controllers, and using a different set, but it's the game itself, for whatever reason it does not count well.  If you get stuck in rep. hell you can click to quit the exercise and go on to the next, so it's not a total frustration.  Not a bad workout, just a little frustrating.",1424822400,3,676,4.217054263565892
