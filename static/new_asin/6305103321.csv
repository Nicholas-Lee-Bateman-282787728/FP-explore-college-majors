When  I randomly came across the first film in the series, No Contest about a year ago, it was more than just a pleasant surprise. It was awesome. I loved it. Essentially just a low-budget Die Hard ripoff, it ended up being one of the better ones in a sea of Die Hard ripoffs. In fact, it's damn near an identical clone! What was even more surprising, aside from it's impressive casting, was that it was directed by Paul Lynch, who's only real big credit was directing the very first Prom Night. He again returns in the director's chair, and again re-teams with star Shannon Tweed.

In this sequel, oddly re-titled Face The Evil here in the U.S., they bring along the always reliable baddie Lance Henrikeson, and Bruce Payne, who shockingly turns a good guy performance this time around. While not as impressive as the cast of the first film, they do solid work with what they have to work with.

Aesthetically, director Paul Lynch seems to kind of go-through-the-motions here. While a competent looking film, it's a far cry from his slick streamlined approach where he was channeling John McTiernan. Here he takes a much looser and more freestyle approach, meaning you won't find any of the impressive widescreen shots and slick camerawork that made the first one so good.

I have to admit. I had high hopes for this one. I mean, how could I not? The first one was just so fun and well made when I wasn't really expecting much to begin with. And knowing the same star and director were returning only got my excitement even hotter. But while the story, about a mad man who wants to release a chemical agent that kills instantly, was okay, the many sub-par fight scenes, action sequences, and less than stellar camerawork leave you let down.

While knowing full well that Shannon Tweed cannot possibly do most of the fighting and stunts in both of these films, it was easier to take seeing her stunt double the first time around simply because the first one was a much better and enjoyable film all around. Here though, it comes off as annoying when 90% of the time you see a stunt double with a bad blonde wig doing everything, even the simplest punches, kicks, or tumbles.

I think what this film does best is remind you how good the first film was, and if anything, get's you to go back and revisit that randomly surprising film.",1474848000,,2408,4.5368663594470044

7888301,5,6305103321,Cool movie of the lethal diva SHANNON TWEED plus her action in this one is really dashing. You could say that the blazing guns and explosions in a hectic situation can really turn an ordinary movie star into some kind of hero when they least expect it. YOU'VE HANDLED THIS PROBLEM VERY WELL SHANNON.,1390089600,,299,4.555555555555555
7888302,4,6305103321,"Shannon Tweed (Of Unknown Origin) plays Sharon, an actress visiting her sister's art gallery. It's a pleasant visit up until the group of homicidal criminals shows up! Sharon finds herself up against terrorists, led by the loathesome Mr. Dengler (Lance Henriksen from Aliens, Pumpkinhead, Near Dark, etc.). Sharon must shift from ber-hot celebrity into ber-hot commando mode in order to deal w/ Dengler and his ruthless cohorts, and rescue her sister and her friends. Both Tweed and Henriksen are perfect in their roles, actually raising the material above the usual DIE HARD-clone, action rubbish. Yes, there's gunfire, explosions, and karate, but it's well handled, and the plot is fairly engaging. The final, when Dengler gets what's coming to him, is a horrifically gooshy classic!...",1248480000,3,788,5.362903225806452
