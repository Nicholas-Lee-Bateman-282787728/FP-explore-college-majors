8121050,5,B000FDEV34,"Don't let the "" Midnight Movie"" packaging fool you these are not B-rate pirate adventures at all, in fact they were penned by one of the premiere swashbuckler writers of his time Rafael Sabatini who wrote "" The Black Swan"", "" The Sea Hawks"" , "" Scaramouch"" & of course "" The Chronicles of Captain Blood""!!!  Hollywood springboarded...no catapulted Errol Flynn up into the heavens as a star with "" Captain Blood"" & why they went with Rafael Sabatini's "" The Sea Hawks"" as a follow up for Errol Flynn instead of just coming straight out with the  Captain Blood trilogy I will never know.  But they did what they did & years flew by and finally Louis Hayward brought us the rest of Sabatini's brilliant Pirate tales!  I suppose if you want to put them in chronological order you would have to pause Errol Flynn's "" Captain Blood"" during the pastiche scene's of battle where the words blood!, blood! BLOOD! flash on the screen & insert "" The Fortunes of captain Blood"" finish them both and then put in "" Captain Pirate"" A.K.A. The Return of Captain Blood"", ( I wish they would have went with that title) & that would just about round out Rafael Sabatini's body of work dealing with Captain Blood.  Or just watch them in the order they were put out & view the second film as if Peter Blood was retelling one of his adventures from the height of his adventuring days.  What ever the case these are MUST HAVES for all serious Pirate Movie collectors!!!  Rafael Sabatini wrote his Captain Blood Chronicles much as Alexander Dumas wrote the Chronicles of a Musketeer in the kings guard, which became the Three, Four & Return of the Musketeers/ 20 years After & The Man in the Iron Mask.  But back to these D.V.D.'s they are of great quality both in sound & picture & the materials there made of.  While for many Errol Flynn will always be their favorite Captain Peter Blood, don't discount the talents of Louis Hayward he certainly brings his own skill sets to the table making a more than adequate older Captain Blood with all the realism that Errol Flynn brought to the character.  Adding the rest of Rafael Sabatini's Captain Blood story's to my Pirate collection is far over due & not a minute to late as I see this double set sky rocketing in price in the near future, especially when collector's of Pirate movie's realize just how good these two movies are & their importance to the genre is !!!  I could be wrong but since Douglas Fairbanks literally rampaged a crossed the screen in the old silent film "" The Black Pirate"" not a decade has gone by without Hollywood offering up at least one gratuitous Pirate film, if not one great pirate film from every decade.  These days "" The Pirates of the Caribbean"" have been in the spotlight & there has been a lack of fantasy free pirate movies but I look to see that turn around soon.  Don't get me wrong I enjoy those films but they lack the guttural realism that a lot of the older swashbuckler's brought to the screen.  If you are a collector of pirate movies like myself please don't wait to snatch this set up along with Errol Flynn's movie "" Captain Blood"" these complete Sabatini's glorious contribution to the Pirate genre as far as Captain Blood tales & bump up your collection several notches in quality!!!",1495756800,3,3259,4.520408163265306
8121051,5,B000FDEV34,"This movie set started me on my research into Louis Hayward and his movies. These are follow-ups to the 1935 movie Captain Blood starring Errol Flynn as Dr. Peter Blood. In ""Fortunes of Captain Blood"" (1950) Louis Hayward, as Capt./Dr. Blood, is betrayed causing some of his men to be captured and sold into slavery as pearl divers in shark filled waters! Yikes! With the help of the Marquis's niece he rescues his men, vanquishes the Marquis in a shipboard sword fight, and wins the heart of the beautiful Patricia Medina. As an interesting casting note you will notice Alfonso Bedoya as Carmilio, the overseer of the slave prison. He is the actor from ""Treasure of Sierra Madre"" immortalized by the famous line ""We don't need no stinkin' badges!"" to Humphrey Bogart. In ""Captain Pirate"" (1952) it starts off with, the now, Dr Blood saving some escaped slaves. This is a big no-no at the time. He is also preparing to marry the lovely Ms Medina when he is imprisoned for a raid on Cartagena. He knows he has been set-up and is about to be shipped off to England for trial (he knows how well those turn out for him) when his old crew rescues him just prior to sailing. Naturally, this forces him back to his life of piracy while he tries to figure a way to prove his innocence. He eventually discovers the dastardly Hillary Evans and saves the city, his reputation, and his girl in a fun, swashbuckling ending! I had a great time watching these two movies and have actually watched the original Capt Blood followed by these two movies. A great afternoon filled with sword fights, betrayals, and love scenes!",1487894400,,1607,4.6223776223776225

8121055,3,B000FDEV34,"Fortunes of Captain Blood, 1950 film

The movie starts with a 17th century ship that sails the West Indies to prey upon Spanish shipping. Captain Peter Blood commands this pirate ship. King Charles II orders action against those who are bleeding his kingdom of its wealth (taken from South America). Blood's ship needs supplies and they go ashore when they get a signal. It is a trap! One man swims back to warn the ship, they sail away. The captured men won't talk. In disguise Blood goes into town but finds his contact won't talk. He meets Seorita Evita. We see the conditions of the pearl divers who survived, and the rulers of that island. Seor Fairfax talks to Isabella, her uncle disapproves A medallion attracts unwanted attention. People talk. Two men follow Pedro, so does a third. He is captured! Seor Fairfax has visitors, he is to be arrested. ""Come and take it!"" There are swordfights. Pedro and Fairfax flee to a safe refuge.

The Guards search this inn for the Marquis' niece and the two wanted men but find nothing. Pedro suggests a plan to Isabella. Billy Bragg recognizes Pedro. Pedro squares things with the Marquis. Isabella gets an explanation from Pedro; it works! There are other complications. Pedro goes to see those six pirates. Can they fight their way out of jail? The Marquis wants to find Captain Blood and finds where his ship is anchored. Back on board Captain Blood rewards Miguel for the use of his cart. Can they leave before their enemy arrives? Will they be trapped? Will they run up a white flag? Is this a clever ruse to capture the enemy's ship? Blood fights with Fairfax. Cannons fire at the approaching ship. [Note the use of models.] The pirates fight for freedom. They will trade Captain Alvarado and his remaining crew for the prisoners in the jail. A happy ending for the survivors? They sail out to sea for another adventure.

Pirate ships were usually armed merchant vessels, like the privateers of the late 18th century. Pirates operated with a ""share and share alike"" policy, their crew was treated better than in navy or merchant vessels. There were no daily floggings. These outlaw gangs respected no laws except their own. They could depose their captain if he displeased them. [The `black spot' in Robert Louis Stevenson's ""Treasure Island"".] This movie is based on the novel by Rafael Sabatini. This is a sequel to the earlier and bigger budget movie ""Captain Blood"". It was followed by another movie ""Captain Pirate"". They are worth watching once.",1345075200,,2504,4.791666666666667
8121056,4,B000FDEV34,"Pristine presentation, though no extras. Two films on two discs follow the adventures of Captain Blood made fameous by Errol Flynn 15 years earlier. Fourtunes of Catain Blood is in black and white while Captain Pirate is in quite glorious color. No Oscar contenders here, but interesting stories, colorful characters, and some pretty good swordplay. Recommended to those who cherished their time as a kid at the Saturday matinee, or those too young to have had the pleasure.",1155427200,15,474,5.089743589743589
8121057,5,B000FDEV34,"This review is for the Midnite Movies DVD ""Fortunes of Captain Blood"" and ""Captain Pirate,"" both from Columbia Pictures and produced by Harry Joe Brown, who produced a number of Randolph Scott westerns.

This Double Feature DVD is distributed by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. The video transfer is excellent. The movies are remastered in high definition and have subtitles in English, Japanese, Portuguese and Spanish.

Louis Hayward and Patricia Medina were teamed together for a number of swashbuckling sagas. In addition to the above, the team also did ""The Lady in the Iron Mask"", and ""The Lady and the Bandit"", which I hope will be released soon since their movies were very entertaining.

The first movie on the DVD is ""Fortunes of Captain Blood"", 91 min., black & white, 1950, directed by Gordon Douglas (G. Douglas directed ""Doolins of Oklahoma"" and ""The Nevadan"", two exciting Randolph Scott westerns. ""Fortunes"" had an excellent supporting role from Dona Drake. She plays the Spanish spitfire who helps Captain Blood release his mates from prison, and generally steals every scene she's in. The heavy is George Macready. Incidentally he was the heavy in the two Randy Scott westerns I mentioned above.

The second movie is ""Captain Pirate"", 85 min., color, 1952, directed by Ralph Murphy, who had previously directed them in ""The Lady and the Bandit"", 1951. ""Captain Pirate"" is a lively buccaneering programmer with plenty of high spirits. Needless to say, Patricia Medina looks ravishing in Technicolor. Although he never reached the swordsmanship skills of Errol Flynn, the South African Louis Hayward handles his action scenes well enough.

For all of the above, I rate it five stars.",1153267200,33,1701,5.170909090909091
8121058,5,B000FDEV34,"Fortunes of Captain Blood:

Rousing Adventure Yarn WITH LOTS OF ACTION, plenty of sword-play, an excellent cast (Macready, Bedoya, Gilmore) and a marvellous musical score by Paul Sawtell.

Captain Pirate: continued good swashbuckling entertainment in technicolor, Louis Hayward starring in both. Both an excellent opportunity to re-enjoy good cinema entertainment of Columbia's golden B-era of the 40's and the 50's. Should be followed by Cornel Wilde ( A Thousand and One Nights, Bandit of Sherwood Forest), Larry Parks (The Swordsman, the Gallant Blade), Jon Hall (Prince of Thieves -48) and John Derek (Rogues of Sherwood Forest, Mask of the Avenger, Prince of Pirates) and many others.

Salute from Sweden",1150416000,18,709,5.486238532110092
