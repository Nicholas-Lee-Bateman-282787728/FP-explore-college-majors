5972948,5,B00FA9629E,"Great bang for your buck I love these double and in this case triple features, especially this one, I think Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are a dynamic duo, at the time of purchase I hadn't yet watched ""the worlds end"" but after doing so I found it to be hilarious as well, great buy!",1452297600,,280,4.109090909090909

5972970,5,B00FA9629E,"Not reviewing the movies, which are more a question of personal taste (fwiw I love them all), but price, delivery and packaging were all top notch. Exactly what I wanted in a reasonable time at a reasonable price; whats not to like? :)",1465084800,,235,4.488372093023256
5972971,5,B00FA9629E,If your a fan of Shaun of the Dead then you can't go wrong with this DVD. I have seen The World's End too but I never even heard of Hot Fuzz but it didn't dissapoint. All 3 movies are very funny and made me want to watch them all more than once. Best part is I got some hard drive back on my DVR because I've had Shaun of the Dead and The World's End on it for a few years now.,1464566400,,377,3.5542168674698793

5972973,2,B00FA9629E,"I've ordered this twice and the case has come broken both times. I've ordered many blu-rays before and never had this problem, so I find it strange that it has happened twice with the same product. It might be because the white case these movies come in is worse quality than the normal blue cases, but I can't be sure. Hopefully the third time's the charm because I love these movies!",1460332800,,385,4.436619718309859
