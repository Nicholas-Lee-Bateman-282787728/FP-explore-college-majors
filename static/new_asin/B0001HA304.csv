For correctness this version far surpasses the equally lengthy 1977 TV miniseries (though I miss those BRIGHT blue eyes the '77 version and the 1961 ""King Of Kings"" had for Jesus!!). On the slight downside is the as-usual great shyness of virtually all the films of Jesus to actually SHOW both the great miracles and the several appearances of angels (the Gospels CAREFULLY only detail 35 miracles of Jesus plus His own Resurrection... for a total of 36, though ""many more"" are mentioned in passing. This adaptation does dramatically show the raising of Lazarus, but then at Christ's Resurrection we just get a spotlight to indicate where the angels supposedly are sitting.  (The 1928 DeMille version of ""King Of Kings"" has the best, most dramatic conclusion of the Crucifixion though).  And on the issue of possibly showing the mass resurrection at Jesus' moment of death carefully mentioned by Matthew, there is as-usual not even the slightest attempt at presenting that or even telling it, yes of course due to budget... (The 1990's film version of the the Gospel Of Matthew is the only one that at least had the aged Apostle even TELLING that part...)  And again the budget for THIS adaptation didn't allow for anything like depicting the Ascension.  IFFF you want to see angelic appearances around Jesus and a proper version of the Ascension (and the most unique depicting of His Resurrection EVER) then the film to get ALONGSIDE this is the 1905 (yes 1905) ""Life And Passion of Jesus Christ""). But in sum-total, of all the Jesus film adaptations ever this is the best!",1467072000,,1699,4.868512110726644
8012512,5,B0001HA304,"I was delighted to find out this series had been made into a box set on DVD! I had purchased this series on VHS years ago, the quality was poor and the set started to deteriorate one by one. This DVD Box Set is very good quality for a TV series from 1951, with a very basic budget. You may recognize a few of the actors and actresses but most seem to be unknown, but all do a good job recreating the facts and culture of that time. Many years ago, some of my earliest memories were getting up early in the morning with my Mom, Sister, and Brother to watch episodes of this Christian series. I loved the basic approach, straight to the point nature and factual accuracy of the film. I could not be more pleased to have made this purchase from Amazon, and the price was great! Thank you",1373155200,,784,4.1644736842105265
