8114154,5,B000ETQ0S8,"Meet the Last Chance Detectives, a group of friends who are Christians & have started their own detective agency: Mike - the leader. He holds the group together & looks out for cases to solve. Winnie - a full-blooded Navajo. If you have a question about Ambrosia, she can either give you the answer or find it out. She also knows the desert like the back of her hand. Spence - he's the brain of the group & is their computer & forensics expert - actually, it's hard to find something he's not an expert in! Ben - does a lot of the leg work...well, when he can be dragged away from his TV! Also the one with more imagination than the rest of them put together!

The detectives are looking for a new mystery to solve. They decided to split up & search looking for anything that will give them a new case, making plans to meet up later - all the while behind them a bank robbery is going on!

Mike soon stumbles on the bank robbers though when his dog Jake's ball bounces into an old, closed up yard. At least, it's supposed to be closed up, but Mike spots 2 guys loading up a truck. Figuring they are up to something, Mike & Jake go in to investigate. Seeing bank sack in the back of the truck Mike knows he has to get Sheriff Smitty. However, the men come back out & there's only one place to hide - inside the truck. Mike decides to leave a trail of bank notes from the moving truck, writing on them to call the Sheriff. He also decides to put the jade figurine he's found in his pocket for evidence. The ""breadcrumbs"" leave a trail...one of which is spotted by the robbers. Not liking complications, they take Mike to Fire Lake & leave him there to find his way back. Now Mike & Jack just have to survive the wilderness while finding their way back.

The rest of the detectives meet back at HQ but are concerned when Mike doesn't turn up. Combing the streets they eventually find Mike's compass by the side of the road near the old yard. They discover Jake's ball in the yard & an abandoned car with Illinois plates - one that matches the description of the car used in the bank robbery. Then an old man stops by the diner with a $100 bill. Now they know which way they are headed, the Last Chance Detectives are on the trail...& to the rescue.

A great fast-paced adventure of survival, hope & courage, & where Mike realises how his personal faith in God makes all the difference during a crisis.  Our 10-13 year old group really enjoyed this 3rd film in the series.
