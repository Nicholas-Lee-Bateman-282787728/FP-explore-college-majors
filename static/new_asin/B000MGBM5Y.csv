2733999,5,B000MGBM5Y,"Hands down the best stretching book I've read for martial artists. At the back of the book they have ""flow chart"" like stretching combinations based upon what it is you're trying to accomplish. Whether it be high kicks, boxing, grappling, ... Nice touch!",1303516800,2,254,4.930232558139535
2734000,4,B000MGBM5Y,"I bought this whilst in the UK, and had to import from US.
The DVD is broken down into the different levels, from Beginner to Intense, which is ideal for the different levels of flexibility (I started from basic and I am building up gradually..)
The programs last a maximum of 20 Minutes each which is good if you are short for time or get bored easily doing sessions over 30mins.

I already participate in Kickboxing (Intermediate level) and found that even within a week of this stretching my kicking has improved in speed and height. So something must be working..:-)

I found the whole DVD of a good standard, and am currently in the process of buying more from Sang H Kim.
No-nonsense, straight down to it attitude and the little comment at the end of every session, of ""I'll see you tommorrow"" Really works for me!",1270512000,3,820,4.533783783783784
2734001,2,B000MGBM5Y,Did not care for the video--it's the personal idea of this particular instuctor. I found better strecting and kicking techniqes in Jame Lew's the Art of Kicking and Strecting--I highly recomment the video.,1242432000,3,205,5.242424242424242
2734002,1,B000MGBM5Y,"After 5 years of Taekwondo, I was looking for something to take me to the next level.  I was very disappointed with this video.  If you have been doing any form of martial arts for longer than 2 weeks, save your money... you already know as much as this video will teach you.",1242000000,6,275,4.169811320754717
2734003,5,B000MGBM5Y,"There are 3 wonderful, full body stretching routines on this DVD. Sang H. Kim's energy is magnificent!!!

There are 3 levels of routines each one is approx. 20 minutes. Sang moves thru the routine fairly quickly and counts 1 thru 8 keeping a good rhythm. It is a very nice alternative to typical yoga sun salutations and your whole body will feel alive and open after the exercises.

You can do each one individually or together for a full hour of fun! I would probably not recommend for beginners as he doesn't give a lot of explanation on form, but if you know a bit about stretching and possibly yoga already this is a ""must have"".

The intense workout is quite invigorating. The moderate workout is done completely on the floor. The easy routine is a nice practice for easy days. Each one is quite different and allows you a variety choice depending on how you feel.

I love the music which comes on intermittently throughout the practices. The staging is quite simple and no fancy stuff. You can just concentrate on stretching, moving, and breathing.

Please see my other yoga and stretching dvds on amazon and check my web site to view my very favorites (including this one) at worldturning dot com.",1217462400,9,1205,4.63849765258216
2734004,4,B000MGBM5Y,"While this video is titled ""Stretching for Martial Arts"" it is so fundamental in approach that it will be equally useful to anyone. It is not an overly strenuous or violent type of stretching. Each user is advised to proceed at their own pace and given a method for doing so.

After using this video daily for about a month I have found it to be extremely effective. Mr Kim is very organized and through in his method, systematically going from joint to joint providing graded exercises for
each. He provides three levels of workouts, each increasing in intensity. The first level can be used by anyone without prior experience or training.
Anyone consistently using this video will benefit almost immediately.
Each session in about 20 minutes and provides a  good workout as Mr. Kim goes rather quickly. I recommend this video to anyone begining a stretching program.",1195689600,47,868,4.858108108108108
2734005,4,B000MGBM5Y,"Since beginning my martial arts journey a few months ago, I wanted to find some ways to increase my flexibility outside the dojo.  I found a great video called Ultimate Flexibility by Sang H. Kim.  Sang provides 3 different workouts that are less than 30 minutes each, so it's easy for anyone to fit into their busy schedule.  Simple exercises to keep you flexible from head to toe!  There's also a great bonus section on stretches to improve your kicks and splits.",1186444800,11,465,4.634146341463414
2734006,5,B000MGBM5Y,"I recently viewed this DVD in order to learn some good stretching techniques for martial arts and I was not dissapointed.  All three of the routines are excellent and stretch the entire body.  No matter what the athletic endeavor, I think this DVD provides the perfect stretching routine.",1185408000,26,288,4.979166666666667
2734007,4,B000MGBM5Y,"To give you an idea of my ability, I have been doing yoga for over 5 years & a full knees & nose on the floor straight back butterfly stretch is 90% of the time too easy for me, most times can touch my nose to my knees in standing or seated fwd bend & on a good day can do a full Russian split but not a fwd split.
The menu options are intro, easy workout, moderate & intense. The bonus has 10 min on kicking, an old video of him for advanced exercises & 1 min trailers of 6 other martial arts dvds. The production values are good, his speaking sound & lighting are nice. The camera work was very good (I wish all workouts had this cameraman & director). The camera stayed back to see his whole body almost at all times. Only occasionally to see where to put emphasis, such as seeing that he is standing on tip toes, or how to move into that stretch, etc. does the camera zoom in for just long enough to see, then stays back. There is NO MUSIC except for the menu & at the end of each workout.
Sang H. Kim is alone on floor with natural beige tie-dye curtain behind him, black mat on the floor & 2 simple black/red/white Asian painting next to him on either side. He gives little instruction, though his English is clear & no problem understanding & tells you & shows you quick first, then has you do everything as he counts to 8 for each side. He moves in a good pace so you just keep up, not get bored, but w/o music & everything counted it still bored me a little.
Intro is 8 min about how stretching is good & about how the dvd works.
Easy Workout: 20 min, basic necks, shoulder, arm, wrist circles, hip circles, leg stretches, yoga sitting fwd stretch, wide leg stretch normal & stretching to each foot, butterfly, bridge, child's pose, spine rocking, etc. All the stretches are done laying down, seated, kneeling or on knees. The same stretches almost any workout dvd has, maybe 1 or 2 different & some basic yoga ones for the everyday person. I didn't feel much, a little stretched out, but this was below my ability. There was a couple stretches at angles most dvds don't do but so far wasn't impressed.
Moderate Workout: 20 min, neck stretches w/hand pushing, wrist twists & pulling with other hand & each individual finger. Nothing you can't figure out on your own. Basic stretches like above, some little deeper, not really different then most workout dvds, more butterfly, sitting forward bend, wide angle, half attempt at split, lunges, ends in shoulder stand. Only a few moves were different the most basic stretch or yoga dvds. Most of the stretches are done laying down, seated, kneeling, on knees except shoulder stand. Most people who exercise at least semi-regularly should be able to handle this with no problem. I felt more stretched out, but still didn't feel that much.
Intense Workout: 16 min. Ok, this one was harder after doing the other 2 with only short breaks in between. This one was done much faster, like cardio speed for a few stretches & it did feel real good. It then slow down to some of the regular stretches. This one had more lunges with torso twisting, modified side angle pose, sitting wide angle stretch to each side, deeper side lunges to the ground, camel, bridge but only feet & skull on ground, wheel, etc.
By this time, my legs got rubbery. This one was more my speed & about now 1/3 of the moves were different & felt good. After doing all 3, the next day I only felt a tiny bit sore & a little stretched out, about what was to be expected after any 56 min of normal mainstream stretching.
Bonus Kicking: 10 min, is 2 general stretches, practicing slowly w/a chair & regular speed front kicks, side, back, roundhouse, spinning kick. The roundhouse he only shows one leg. His kicking is still very flexible & with great control.
Bonus Advanced Kicking Exercises: 7 min of him in 1988 with blue mat & looks like a gym. Lunges, wide angle fwd bend, lateral touching of the legs in wide angle, splits & he even touches his head to toes in that position, split & rolling back/forth.

Not sure if it was him or maybe they had to film it many times & was at the end of the night, but his energy seemed a bit low, careful. On the easy, moderate, intense workouts, 80% time I had more flexibility then him. I was expecting more body awareness & more fluid feel to the workout & how the body is stretched/released considering he's a martial artist. Some of the stretches that weren't mainstream did flow & felt right, but there wasn't enough of them to make me really reach for this. Those were done like stepping forward & swing back the arms, or swing arms to the side to open up the torso in a fast motion.

Most of all the stretches you'd get from any regular gym class or beginner's yoga dvds & the couple ones I'd never seen before are probably done in any dojo. I'd suggest this dvd for anyone who's flexibility isn't on the same level as mine and/or doesn't like yoga and/or rather have a male martial artist lead rather then a woman or aerobics instructor.

2734078,5,B000MGBM5Y,This program is perfect even for those not interested in Martial Arts. I'm pretty flexible to begin with from years of dancing as a child but the older I got the less and less flexible I have become.

2734081,5,B000MGBM5Y,"This is an easy, gentle way to improve your flexibility. Dr. Kim is very knowledgeable about how a person becomes limber and he goes into some of the basic biology behind human body flexibility and movement. The easy, moderate and difficult format Dr. Kim leads you through allows you to scale your flexibility workout. Dr. Kim is easy to understand and none of the stretches are very difficult to set up or require extensive explanation as with a more traditional yoga-style workout. The pacing of the stretches is natural and are not held as long as a more traditional yoga either and transition between stretches is easy. All the major joints and muscle groups receive attention, and more specific areas get focused on in the moderate and advanced workout - for example, the fingers and wrists of each hand get throughly stretched in the moderate flexibility workout. Done frequently, this could be an excellent foundation to more strenuous flexibility training or a flexibility/mobility component of a comprehensive exercise program.",1459209600,2,1037,5.1420118343195265

This is health.",1444608000,,169,5.222222222222222
2734085,4,B000MGBM5Y,"This is a comprehensive stretching program divided into three separate workouts, approximately 20 minutes each.

Each body part is stretched in each workout, and if you do all of the workouts, I daresay you'll have stretched every single muscle except your tongue and scalp muscles.  The workouts build upon each other, too.  What you do in the Easy workout helps you prepare for the Moderate workout, and you need to be capable of doing both of these to do the Intense workout.

Attention is paid to the neck, shoulders, arms, wrists, fingers, chest, back, groin, glutes, all four major thigh muscles, calves, ankles, feet, and toes.  In 20 minutes, no less.  Many of the stretches are active stretches.  None are held more than a few seconds.  The Intense workout has some ballistic stretches.

The Intense workout is somewhat aerobic, and successful practice of some of the moves calls for considerable strength.  The Easy and Moderate workouts are easy for me, but I have some difficulty with some of the moves in the Intense workout, primarily the backbend series that begins around one hour and three minutes in the streaming version.  Something to aspire to, though.

I do the Moderate followed by the Easy workout at least twice a week, after an aerobic, strength, or yoga session.  Please note, you've probably done most of these stretches in some form in P.E. classes at school.  They are not exotic moves, and easy to re-learn.

I do have a couple of quibbles, though.  There is a glaring error in the instruction in the Easy workout.  Following a lift-your-toe calf stretch, one knee is forward and bent; the other leg is behind you and straight.  Kim says to stretch the ""back hamstrings"".  You're not stretching your hamstrings.  You're stretching your calf.  If you try to stretch your hamstrings from this position, you'll hyperextend your knee.  So, watch out for that part.

The other quibble is a bit more serious.  I've had my reasons to practice flexibility all my life, and I find some of the transitions too fast for my taste.  I can do them, but my form suffers.  For the person unacquainted with flexibility exercises, they could cause loss of balance or a strain, particularly in the adductors.

Otherwise, this is a fine program for overall flexibility, and I do recommend it.  Be sure to watch each workout first, and if you have difficulty with the pacing, opt for skipping a move.  And remember, if you don't use it, you lose it.",1440720000,7,2459,4.801909307875895

Additionally I have some arthritis in my neck which makes other forms of exercise like weight lifting problematic on a bad day. I've jogged and walked for years, swim fairly often and go to the gym but as I age, my flexibility has steadily grown worse and worse. Muscle tension has become a major issue.

This begins slowly but very thoroughly. The examples are very complete and comprehensive...I am NOT able to do them all and must modify many of them to my personal level of flexibility (or lack thereof) but within the first week, I'm already feeling a notable difference. There is minimal music, minimal distraction and maximum emphasis on stretching every part of the body including areas that are often ignored.

I especailly appreciate the fact that Dr. Kim takes a more scientific approach to this discipline with an emphasis on function as well as form. I wish I had started this decades ago but so glad to have found this now. Wonderful resource!",1306886400,19,1461,4.7896825396825395

Love counting to eight reminded me about my PE classes when I was at school. The instructor knows what he is doing, and I like that he was straight to the point. Also liked that there were no music so I could concentrate on instructor's comments and counting) I am not a martial artist so as a regular person I can say that it is awesome stretch workout) and the kicks comments in the end of the video made me laugh when I was doing them so I am starting to think about few martial arts tricks)",1507939200,,600,4.136752136752137
8168904,5,B000MGBM5Y,"This is an excellent program to keep your flexibility and work muscles when you do not have time to work out at a gym and/or as you grow older and have no interest in excessive exercise programs.  It is simply presented and works.  I especially like that he shows you ahead of time what you are going to do before he does it with counts.  He has three sections of 20 minutes each.  They are progressively more aggressive and they work different muscle groups.  Even if you do not exercise for awhile, you can always start over with the first session until you work yourself up again.  It is so encouraging.  I tried several exercise videos using my Prime.  I kept coming back to this one.  I liked it so much that even though I get it free with Prime, I purchased it.",1488672000,2,767,4.3076923076923075
