8427141,4,B004EL5NIU,"he film is a laugh-riot. akshay delivers another mighty 'cop' performance, the most prolific section of his repertoire. he moves effortlessly from an almost instantaneous romance, to a nervous meeting with the girl's father and on to a stormy climax of good cops taking on an empire of criminals, politicians and corrupt policemen. as you can probably tell, a truly original script.
raveena is excellent in her role as the tortured girlfriend of a virtuous cop. this film has 'moving' performances by all of bollywood's best-known baddies. the item girl, payal rohatgi, deserves special mention as the least laughable part of the film.
this film offers more laughs than most bollywood comedies can claim to. enjoy!",1302480000,,714,5.163793103448276
