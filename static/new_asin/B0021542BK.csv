However, there is about 4 minutes of talking before starting the exercises and there is no interactive menu to skip this part and get straight to the exercises.  Everyday, I have to fast forward through all the talking to get started with the exercises.  If this DVD is ever re-done, please keep this in mind for persons who are actually using this on a daily basis and provide interactive menus so that we can choose the exercise session only.",1252281600,,512,4.604395604395604
