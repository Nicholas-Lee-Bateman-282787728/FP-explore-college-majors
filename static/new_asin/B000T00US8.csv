8207127,5,B000T00US8,"Salvador Sanchez was a great Mexican fighter, and who knows that he wouldn't have risen to all-time great status if only he hadn't died so young. The potential was certainly there. This DVD puts together two of his bouts, one of them an all-time classic slugfest and the other one a pretty intense tussle, as well.

On April 12, 1980, in Tucson, Arizona, Salvador Sanchez stepped into the ring with Ruben Castillo, making the first title defense of the WBC World Featherweight Championship after snatching the sucker from Danny ""Little Red"" Lopez just two months before. Sanchez and the challenger Castillo were both 22 years old at this time, with both fighters each having suffered only one loss thus far in their careers. Sanchez's record back then was 34-1-1 with 28 KOs, Castillo's was 45-1 with 23 KOs. These are very legit creds.

There was some question going into this one about how Castillo's conditioning would fare. Two fights before, he had been outpointing Alexis Arguello but then got caught in the 11th round. On this night, starting out, Castillo was the one making the flashier impression, his faster hands allowing him to score early. This fight was shown on ABC's Wide World of Sports, back when the networks still thought boxing was the shizzy, and Howard Cosell called this one and, watching the thing, you can hear him several times blurt out his classic staccato ""Right there!"" each time this or that fighter would land a telling punch or combo.

But Salvador Sanchez, the dude is undeterred. No expression on his face; he keeps on coming. The stronger puncher, Sanchez right around the seventh round began to really impose his will on Castillo, and Sanchez's thunderous right hand was always very dangerous, anyway. The last half of the fight Castillo, showing heart and stamina, would stay competitive and would occasionally hold back the tide with a flurry here and there, but he never did really hurt the champ. After fifteen enjoyable rounds, the judges would ultimately award Sanchez a unanimous decision.

This next one is a doozy. Salvador Sanchez and Wilfredo ""Bazooka"" Gomez, man, what a be-yoo-tiful fight! I don't know what the buzz was leading into this one, because I'm not sure that Salvador Sanchez was yet that well-known a fighter (Gomez was probably the bigger name at this stage). But our guy became an overnight sensation with his rousing win over the Bazooka. Going into this one, Gomez sported an undefeated record, 32 wins and 32 impressive knockouts (and, okay, one draw). The guy can crack, he wasn't called ""Bazooka"" because he liked the chewing gum.

On August 21, 1981, the crowd was hyped up and these two cats waged a friggin' war, tore into each other. But, check this, what happened in the first round was totally unexpected, as Gomez went down from a ""surprise left hook."" From that moment and for the rest of that first round, Sanchez had Gomez glassy-eyed and reeling from pillar to post. In round 2 Gomez had sufficiently recovered that he again started earnestly trading with Sanchez, and remember that Gomez can punch like a grizzly bear. But I have never seen Sanchez lose composure (and, granted, I've only seen a few of his fights). He kept his calm and cool, and that same set expression stayed planted on his mug. Sanchez was the one exhibiting good movement and showing good angles, letting Gomez come to him and counterpunching effectively. So, Sanchez launching that sledgehammer right; Gomez pressing forward, dynamite in the fists, but ugly lumps swelling on his face.

The fight was contested at an unbelievable pace. Thing is, Sanchez never really allowed Gomez to fully recover. Time and again he'd land something and put Gomez on Wobbly Street. I had never seen Gomez out on his feet before and it's a bit surreal watching him stumble around like a newborn foal, his eyes getting puffier by the round. Occasionally Gomez would land something hard but Sanchez had a granite chin and just maintained his work rate, kept breaking the Puerto Rican down. Then he got Gomez against the ropes one last time, and, brother, that was all she wrote. Sanchez had gotten the biggest win he would ever get.

So this is a DVD worth getting. I only wish that whoever had compiled the two fights included here would've instead paired Sanchez-Gomez with the Sanchez-Azumah Nelson thriller. Not to dis on Ruben Castillo, but Azumah Nelson is a more relevant boxer and his 15 rounds with Sanchez was an exciting hell of a thing. Not to mention that Nelson would be the last fighter Sanchez would ever face in the squared circle. A few months later, a 23-year-old Salvador Sanchez would die in a car crash, still the reigning WBC featherweight champion and talk of a rematch with Wilfredo Gomez floating around.",1264550400,7,4767,4.848894348894349
