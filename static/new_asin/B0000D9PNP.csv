1921400,4,B0000D9PNP,"Shia Lebeouf plays Kelly Ernswiler, a high school senior trying to just survive life in this comedy-drama by directors Efram Potelle and Kyle Rankin in what is arguably there biggest job yet.
Kelly is a young man who enjoys reinacting famous battles from past wars.  This is partly a way of reliving history, and a partly a way of escaping life with his recovering drug addict father, played by William Sadler of The Green Mile, and his mother, played by Kathleen Quinlen from Apollo 13.  Kelly still hasn't found a way to forgive his father for his past abuses, so he prefers to spend the day with his new friend Bart Rowland and his wealthy family.  Bart and Kelly strike up a friendship over their shared love of history and Kelly's desire to strike back at a school bully.  Along the way, Kelly finds himself attracted to Bart's older sister, Tabby, a girl engaged to another man, which threatens to destroy their friendship.
This is a very rich coming-of-age story with characters you can't help falling in love with.  Kelly's character is complex, and there are times you want to strangle him, but you feel his heart is in the right place.  Shia Lebeouf does a tremendous job in his role.  After Holes and Charlie's Angels, you can feel that this young man has a great future ahead of him.  The supporting cast played their roles perfectly, and the script was very welldone.  From the minute you start watching this film, you can't take your eyes off of it.  It didn't get 5 stars due to the lack of extras.  Being a Project Greenlight winner, you would think that they would have had plenty of material.  Given that and the short 77 minute running time, it loses a star.
Overall though, I highly recommend this film if you want to see a perfectly well-rounded movie that has very few flaws.",1071878400,10,1797,4.58125
1921401,5,B0000D9PNP,"Well, it was an interesting experiment. Most of the reviews of this film unfairly reviewed the TV series, rather than considering the film on it's own merits. Of course, one could quibble about the film given the nature of how it was made in the public eye.

Nonetheless, the cast of this film is is excellent and this film is never less than compelling and entertaining. There is much to recommend this film if you simply willing to consider it for what it was: a small film that tried it's damndest to win your heart. A good film, with a great film wanting to break out of it... give it a chance for once, without considering how it was made. It's witty, funny and endearing.",1071360000,3,799,4.555555555555555

1921403,4,B0000D9PNP,"Putting Chris Moore in charge of a film with human emotion, psychological depth, and warm humor is like hiring Howard Stern to produce The Secret Garden.  Moore, as you might know if you watched the Project Greenlight television series, has the subtlety of an ox (he actually did manage to shatter a defenseless chair under his formidable bulk), a point more than reconfirmed by the litany of teen sex films he's chosen to perpetrate on the American public.  The latest of these sorry movies, American Wedding, is a perfect summation of Moore's contributions to filmdom.  So, you know what the young, naive amateurs of Project Greenlight were up against.
And it's worth recounting what else they were up against:  a miniscule budget of just over $1,000,000 (yes, in Hollywood, there are so many mouths at the trough that a million bucks barely gets you a no frills, no looking back dash to the finish line, if that); a compressed schedule that required six months from first draft script to final, polished film; a single test screening just weeks before final edits had to be completed; directors who had no power to inject their own creativity in the conversion of the screenplay to the film; and the almost non-involvement of the contest's sponsoring celebrities.  All of this is more than apparent from the HBO series on the making of this film.
Against this backdrop, Battle of Shaker Heights is a wonder.  It tells a touching story of a young man coming to grips with his own unhappiness, and the difficulties of navigating the strange waters between childhood and adulthood.  Sure, it isn't exactly an original theme, but Shia LeBouef's Kelly, the lead character, comes across like a real human being, someone of flesh, blood, and ideas.  At the end of Shaker Heights, I wished that I could see more of Kelly, perhaps count him among my friends.  That's a rare feat for a film, and a real tribute to the young writer and directors.
There likely will be another version of this DVD down the pike--one that includes the television show and director commentaries.",1070236800,4,2067,4.8328611898017
1921404,1,B0000D9PNP,"Fans like myself of HBO's PROJECT GREENLIGHT are unfortunately more than aware of the making of THE BATTLE OF SHAKER HEIGHTS: itself a battle of visions and wills.
The Project is a competition which, in this case chose Erica Beeney's screenplay and as directors of this screenplay, Kyle Rankin and Efram Potelle. Rankin and Potelle submitted a short film of uncommon grace and humor and deserved to be given the chance to film this screenplay.  Chris Moore the producer (American Pie Movies) did everything he could to dilute the talents of Potelle and Rankin and unfortunately in the process did the same to Beeney's screenplay. ""They"" gave these artists the opportunity to make a studio film and then bit by bit stripped away and soiled their artistic visions by demanding changes with the threat of discharge if they didn't make them. Nasty Stuff, if you ask me.  I don't know whose movie is on view in the in theaters now, but it I were Rankin, Potelle and Beeney, I'd remove my name.
Rankin and Potelle filmed a drama with comedy. After the first public screening the studio demanded a more comedic film. Unfortunately since they were on such a tight budget, there was very little comedic footage to tack on. And on and on. A real horror story that Moore and Miramax should be ashamed of.
Right now, as is, TBOSH is a hodgepodge of scenes that are much of the time, incoherent. It is very obvious where comedy stuff was patched in to the detriment of the dramatic flow of the story. Shia LaBeouf comes off best but it is obvious his best scenes were left on the cutting room floor and poor William Sandler and Kathleen Quinlan's roles have been relegated to cameo status.
Since those of us who watched The Project Greenlight episodes know that this released version of THE BATTLE OF SHAKER HEIGHTS is a sad, pallid, botched mess of a film, we long for what might have been if the powers that be had allowed their directors and artisans to do the work they were hired to do.",1063065600,15,1978,4.600566572237961
1921405,4,B0000D9PNP,"I would like to start out by pointing out that the Battle of Shaker Hieghts was written, directed, and had actors that were all under 21.  This in itself is completely unapparent.  It is about a boy named Kelly Ernswiler (Shia LaBeouf)who just can't quite seem to get what he deserves out of life.  He isn't exactly popular at school, his teachers all think he's too smart for his own good, and his dad a recovering drug addict spends most of his time at a shelter for other recovering addicts.  the only thing that Kelly seems to do and enjoy is reenact battle scenes from wars.  Then one day he meets Bart who is also very interested in wars, and Kelly is taught how to overcome pretty much all his problems.  Except for one thing, he starts to fall in love with Bart's older sister.  Then, everything just seems to go wrong.  But in the end, everything turns out for the best.  This movie has a good plot, although slightly predictable.  Shia is also very convincing in his part.  All in all, I'd give this movie 4 stars.",1062892800,5,1024,4.3936170212765955

I have always been a Shia Labeoudf fan. When I saw the ""Battle of Shaker Heights"" trailer I knew I had to see it just because it had Shia in it.  I am lucky enough to live about 20 miles from Shaker Heights, so despite the limited release I was able to see it in theaters. The day it came out, I picked up the paper and was dissapointed to see that it had only recieved 2 1/2 stars. I still went to see it, not expecting very much, and boy was I pleasantly suprised.
The storyline was incerdibly touching and so real that everyone can see themselves in one of the characters. I laughed out loud at least a dozen times. What was so touching was the article I read after I had seen the film about the extreme parallels between Shia's real life experiences with his father and the role of Kelly's father in this film. It was probably difficult for Shia to revisit certain aspects of his childhood, but at the same time I really think this aided him in making his character come alive.
I did not watch the ""Project Greenlight"" show but I plan to watch it when it comes out on DVD. I think this movie might have been even better if the studio was given more money and time to produce it. It is a shame that movies like Gigli get millions of dollars to produce and this movie barely had enough to scrape by.
*Synopsis
Some critics labeled this movie as a dull coming of age story. I beg to differ. Kelly ( Shia's character) was able to derive a sense of gravity from his interactions with his mother ( Kathleen Quiinlan), who was a starving artist, and his father (William Sadler) a recovering drug addict, that at times made it difficult to predict whether the movie would end up being a drama or comedy.
This story chronicles Kelly,  a war reanactor enthusiast, who falls for his wealthy friend Bart's ( Elden Henson) sister, Tabby ( AMY Smart). Kelly akwardly approaches any social situation with the same cluelessness he employs on the mock battle field. He even mentions to Bart that he writes his own rules about everything. Unfortuantely in highschool individuality is not a hot commodity. Instead of blending in, all of Kelly's flaws are accentuated by his akward, sometimes forward demeanor. You can only imagine how funny his interactions are when he attempts to win the heart of Tabby. Despite his flaws and quirks, the audience will end up rooting for him to win all the perverbial ""battles"" in his own life.
 Due to his friends urging, Kelly eventually takes a stand against his peers in school and  confronts his parents. He later is forced to deal with regret after seeking revenge on a certain classmate that had been his greatest nemisis. The movie ends on a bittersweet note when Kelly ultimately reconciles with his father and forgives him for squandering his college savings for drugs. Kelly also realizes that Tabby ( Amy Smart) has entered into a grown up world in which Kelly is not yet accustomed to. When Tabby dismisses Kelly, it is a moment that everyone can relate to. It will bring the viewer back to their own experience of akward adolescent relationships. It definately is a pivotal moment in the film, and rightfully so.
I think that this movie was much better than critics suggested and it proves that movies do not need to be laced with vulgarity and sex to be entertaining. Perhaps this is why the critics did not enjoy it. Maybe we are so used to seeing garbage that it has become some sort of standard in which we measure everything by.
Bottom line : See this movie you won't be dissapointed.",1062547200,8,3535,4.51875
1921407,4,B0000D9PNP,"It took me year to finally sit down and watch this movie.  I quite enjoyed it.  It is defiantly classic Shia, sweet and funny.  The story has a little bit of everything, love, friendship, heartbreak and teenage antics.",1397260800,,218,4.684210526315789
1921408,5,B0000D9PNP,"I'm interested in what goes behind the scenes of a motion picture.  Turns out there is a lot more to the process than one might expect.

Project Greenlight lasted a mere three seasons, the first two on HBO, the last on Bravo.  Only the first two seasons are available.  I enjoyed the first year with Pete Jones, so I ponied up the bucks for the second.

The second season features a change from the first season.  This time, there were to be a writer whose script was chosen, and a different director to direct the film.  There was still a competition that narrowed down the list from the thousands of scripts submitted, and the hundreds of potential directors.

The format was similar in the competition.  Each screenwriter and director had to make a pitch to a team of studio executives as well as Ben Affleck and Matt Damon.  Once the screenplay and the director was chosen, then the team had a short period of time to do pre-production.

The main problem this year was casting.  The directors wanted certain actors/actresses, but Miramax (who was funding the film) had final say.  This caused a LOT of friction.  The final casting was not done until the film was underway (!).

All-in-all, a superb entry in the short series.  I enjoyed it immensely, and felt it was as good as, or even a bit better than, the first season.

Highly recommended if you have even a passing curiosity about the filmmaking process.  As Affleck and Damon comment, it's a lot harder than it looks.  And infused with a lot more drama, arguments and strife than you'd think.  Probably more so than some of the films that result!",1308182400,,1607,4.591549295774648
1921409,5,B0000D9PNP,The product as a video was fine. I enjoyed the movie except I could not understand why I had sub titles when they were speaking English. It was not the video but the way it was shipped to me that was not appreciative. I knew it was not in a case but they did not even place the video in a cardboard. It was thrown into the paper cover that usually is on the case and just dropped into the envelope. When I got it it had been bounced around inside the envelope and it is a wonder it arrived to me without being all scratched up. I wouldn't buy from them again.,1274832000,,559,3.9557522123893807
1921410,4,B0000D9PNP,"Project Greenlight season two was very entertaining, unlike the movie that resulted from it.  I think it is a wonderful idea, and applaud Ben And Matt for sponsoring it. Bottom line, the problem with the project results may be the frustrating process.

What I believe from watching the DVDs was that Project Greenlight and Miramax need to choose the director(s) and then let him/her/them have a large part in selecting the script.  The group selecting the script now, including Ben and Matt, either do not know how to choose a good script, or have too much politics involved in the process.  After watching the comments on the scripts, you still have no idea what they will ultimately pick.

In my opinion, the ""Battle of Shaker Heights"" was a lame story, and had no hope of making a profit regardless of who directed it, because there was nothing novel about it on top of being a very contrived (unrealistic) plot.  The casting process also was a political process driven by Miramax which seemed to almost force actors on the directors, but even great actors cannot fix a story that is not very interesting, funny, or believable.

If the directors were chosen and given a large input into the script selection process, this could be a huge step forward in the quality of the project. I felt it was unfair for the directors to have to produce a script that really had nothing new to offer other than a showcase for the actor Shia.

It somewhat killed my desire to compete in Project Greenlight again, but the support by Chris Moore and others gives great insight to the difficulties and challenges in making a low budget movie even with the best crew and equipment.  I hope they have more financial success in the future and let the directors have more input into the script in the future. The director does not have to be the writer, which may have been a season 3 mistake, but at least be in tune with the script chosen.",1256947200,,1922,4.5964912280701755

1921412,5,B0000D9PNP,"This film is a joy to watch.  A simple independant film that shows a little slice of life and be sure, that slice of life will move you in all ways.  This film is the second production as a result of the Ben Affleck/Matt Damon show Project Greenlight.

The story is simple but the acting is impeccable and it develops a wallop emotionally.  The movie is totally carried by Shia LaBeouf.  He had done some work before this, but here, at 17 he shows the maturity and skill that his furthering career would only develop.  He is the sparkle that shines in this film.  LaBeouf plays Kelly, a somewhat unhappy teen from a somewhat unhappy family.  He escapes by participating in war reenactments.  It is here he meets the wealthy, preppie Bart.  They become best friends and his family an escape for the emotionally lost Kelly.  He also falls for Bart's sister played by Amy Smart.

The story is well told and all the characters have depth.  They all experience some life changes through their experiences together but it is Kelly and Labeouf's portrayal that shows the most depth.  His innocence is very believable.  The drama is provided in some excellent moments by him but the biggest surprise is his comedic timimg.  All the comedic touches are provided by the shyness of Kelly.

I highly recommend this slice of life coming of age film to all independant film lovers and also Shia LaBeouf fans.  It is an excellent part of his ever developing career.",1223596800,,1450,4.641732283464567

I have never watched Project Greenlight.  There I said it.  I happened upon this movie and I'm glad I did.  To me it's only of minor importance how this movie was funded and made, because the end product matters most.  And the end product is much better than many would lead you to believe.  You just have to know what kind of movie watcher you are.  If you love independent films and don't mind slow and nuanced acting and a story with no cheap thrills, you can enjoy this.  If you like more traditional movie experiences, you might find this treatment a bit slow.

Shia LaBoeuf shows why he is the ""next big thing"" of his generation in a very subtle and impressive portrayal of the main character.  As Kelly he's an extremely over-intelligent high school kid who channels his brain power into nerdy pursuits like World War II history and military memorablia. Elden Henson is Bart, his fast friend from the better-off side of town.  When he meets Bart's older sister Tabby, he develops a crush for a girl way out of his league, something every boy in high school is familiar with.

All the while, he works at the supermarket with Sarah, played well by Shiri Appleby, who would have clearly been an easier target for him.  All of these relationships are a back drop to the frustration we see Kelly experience from his family life, with a father battling his demons and a mother fighting to hold it together.

William Sadler and Ray Wise round out what really is an all star cast.  And even though the slow is made in a slow and deliberate way, the cast of this movie is really one of the treats.  They all perform exceptionally well, even in parts that are written sparsely.

I think they definitely captured the angst of high school in a way that was honest and real.  These are not typical kids, but that makes it all the more easy to understand why a character like Kelly might not fit in and might act out.  Sure they could have fleshed this one out more, but I guess all those Damon and Affleck connections helped to cast this one well enough to more than make up for it.

If you enjoy slow and introspective independent films, or are a fan of Shia LaBoeuf, you will find lots to like in this movie.

Enjoy!",1209600000,21,2386,4.728813559322034

1921415,5,B0000D9PNP,"First let me say I was disappointed in the show which was project Greenlight 1, but liked the movie by the winning writer/director Pete Jones, STOLEN SUMMER very much.  I would watch STOLEN SUMMER again.  The show, on the other hand, with what seemed to me phony senseless bickering between producers Jeff Balis and Chris Moore seemed to lack the insight into the movie making I would have liked.  Come on, Chris Moore fussing because Jeff and Pete postponed the lake swim because the water was too cold for the child stars, made Moore look like an idiot.  And made careful thinking about what you'll need to get the movie done seem bad.  I do want to point out that Jones went on to make other movies.

Project Greenlight 2, was an inversion.  I loved the show, and found the movie, BATTLE OF SHAKER HEIGHTS lacking.

Now I have made a feature film.  I made my feature KNAPTID for $6,000 and wrote about how in my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/How-to-Make-a-Low-Budget-Digital-Movie/dp/B000P296YY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">How to Make a Low-Budget Digital Movie</a>&nbsp;short. Even though I had some bad actors I think&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Knaptid-4-Days-After-The-First-Abduction/dp/B0006PJYME/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Knaptid--4 Days After The First Abduction</a>&nbsp;is a better movie than BATTLE OF SHAKER HEIGHTS.  So my comments here are those of an experienced low-budget filmmaker.

Project Greenlight 2 does give you some real insight into how a Hollywood film is made, and what all happens.  The way in which the parent company tried to change the movie after it went before a test audience is a lesson by itself for the would-be filmmaker. The casting problems which I experienced myself--though not with stars, struck home, and the list goes on.  What might really be of value to the independent filmmaker here is watching the problems develop.

Greenlight 2 makes producers Balis and Moore look good, and the winning directors look like idiots, while the writer, Erica Beeney is treated sympathetically.  The question is: did the show treat Potelle and Rankin fairly or just make them look bad?  (One does wonder after watching the show if the winner had been the director candidate who said she would only make SHAKER HEIGHTS or the one who actually did the best job on his directorial sample, the one with the crazy person in the psych ward, whether the end product would have been better. )

How bad are the directors? Here is an example.  We see them filming at a church.  They need the church for outside shots of Shia LaBeouf as Kelly at his best friend's sister's (Amy Smart) wedding.  So what do the directors do.  They spend way to much time filming LaBeouf  in a Limo talking to Smart in a scene they never get right, and then have to set up lights to fake daylight in a scene that has to be outdoors.  In the final movie there is a shot of LaBeouf riding away from the church before the daytime service starts, while cars on the street have their headlights on because it is actually dusk.  They only had the church for a day.  LaBeouf did okay,  but Smart never got the 'in limo scene' right.  We never get the idea that she is being confronted just before her wedding by a guy she may have made love to while on the outs with her fiance.  (Want to see the surprised bride done right watch THE GRADUATE.) The thing is there was no background in focus, so they could have shot the 'in the limo shot' anywhere after spending a little time directing Smart.

When the movie making was beginning, I can't believe the directors didn't ask the casting director right up front 'who can we reasonably get? LaBeouf was a bad choice here for example. LaBeouf may be great in comedy, but he did not always deliver here.  Example, the bully.

The bully picks on LaBeouf because LaBeouf harasses the bully's father who is a history teacher.  But the bully's demeanor and LaBeouf's is cartoonish.  The fact that the bully has motive to hate LaBeouf is important as LaBeouf later regrets the trick he pulls on the bully.  The interaction of the two characters comprise some of the worst, most wooden acting in the movie.  In fact, LaBeouf barely seems bothered by the bully, emotionally detached.

Speaking of emotion to really show it in a movie you need close-ups.  This movie seems shot entirely in medium shots. In fact, one extreme close up is of a tiny doll held by LaBeouf's best friend's father.  The problem is instead of a real character the friend's father is a caricature.

Directing the actors:  Didn't these people ever rehearse? Kathleen Quinlan does this scene that ends where her saying 'because' she loves her husband.  This is an emotional scene yet she doesn't seem real because she goes from smiling to serious without really being the character.

Some of the problems could be placed on Beeney the writer.  But if you watch the show you'll see the directors tried to rewrite her.  And the studio heads redid the movie edit. So who is to blame for some of the movie's problems is up in the air, for example: Why LaBeouf hates his father is not revealed until the end of the movie.  Meanwhile we go through the movie finding his 'I hate you Dad' attitude unbelievable enough to make him unsympathetic.

Here  the directors made mistakes, the writer may have, the studio heads obviously did, and so what was in Matt Damon and Ben Affleck's heads when they actually said the fiasco that was THE BATTLE OF SHAKER HEIGHTS was better than STOLEN SUMMER.

(By the way: The directors and the writer here have not gone on as Pete Jones has. At the time of this writing the SHAKER directing gang has one movie of their own they are working on.  Beeney has no further credits.  Pete Jones seems to have done a few things.)

This all makes for an educating show.  They show these guys making mistakes people can learn from.  So enjoy the show, endure the movie and learn.",1201824000,,5994,4.854187192118227

I loved both seasons of PGL but the second was more insteresting. I liked the bonus section with the submitted films much better than the SHAKER HEIGHTS film. There's a film maker named OTTING who made a creepy film about a man with a cross in a mental hospital. I thought that film rocked. If I had been the judge they would have had him as the film maker instead the two guys they picked and the screenplay would have been PRISONER which was written by the weird guy who sat on a couch for five days and did nothing but stare. I don't know anything about the PRISONER script but I figure if the guy's that strange then the screenplay was probably much better than shaker heights. I fill bad saying that the movie sucked because the girl who wrote it seemed nice but she was a bit over emotional. What's funny is they finally made a descent movie with a great director in PGL3 (FEAST with JOHN G.) and PGL3 was the best of the three seasons and it hasn't been released. It almost makes me think that PGL was a Hollywood conspiracy meant to make it look to the rest of the world like people outside of the Hollywood system could only make crappy movies.

(This may have something to do with something called Project Greenlight, as the box makes sure to tell us that this is ""the Project Greenlight movie!"", whatever that may be.) Me, I knew absolutely nothing about it other than that the words ""Shaker Heights"" are in the name. I wasn't even sure it was the Shaker Heights I was thinking of. So it's pretty fair to say I went into this with no expectations at all, and what I got was a small, but pleasant, surprise. (Oh, and yes, I did get the Shaker Heights I was expecting-- but since I live on the other side of town, I didn't actually recognize anything, assuming it was, in fact, filmed here.)

Kelly Ernsweiler (Holes' Shia LaBoeuf) is seventeen, in high school, and a social misfit, only interacting with others in reenactments of World War II battles. After one of them, he meets Bart Bowland (Lords of Dogtown's Elden Henson), a kid from the other side of the tracks. The two immediately fall to ribbing one another about the differences in their stations, but they becomes fast friends.

There is, of course, a love triangle. Kelly works with Sarah (Shiri Appleby, recently of Swimfan), a pixie-like waif who's obviously got the hots for him, but he's interested in Tabby (Win a Date with Tad Hamilton!'s Amy Smart), Bart's graduate-school-aged sister who's on the verge of getting married. There's also the big fight, though this one's got a minor twist; the other guy is defending his father, a history teacher who spends his days being corrected, argued with, and otherwise hampered in his profession by Kelly (who, as a World War II reenactor, knows a good deal more about the subject than most high-school kids).

It's a coming-of-age tale that's somewhat idealized, sure, but knows when to come back to earth for a breath of fresh air. The acting is at least never less than tolerable, and contains two real star turns by two actors of whom we see far too little these days, Trespass' William Sadler and Twin Peaks' Ray Wise, as the two boys' fathers.

A fun little movie; nothing groundbreaking, but a feel-good flick, in an odd kind of way. Worth your time. ***",1139184000,2,2396,4.668246445497631
1921421,5,B0000D9PNP,"I must say that the second season of Project Greenlight was some of the most engrossing viewing I've enjoyed in years. I'm not a person who watches much television at all so for me to actually purchase the dvd set is saying much.

As an aspiring filmmaker I felt this dvd set was the next best thing to an actual internship. A really educational and insp

iring television series.

I wasn't crazy about the film and thought it was actually mediocre. I don't blame the directors for this and if you watch the episodes detailing the day to day process you'll understand why.

I can't recommend this product highly enough. A must for aspiring filmmakers.",1122076800,4,651,4.6347826086956525

No, it is not the best movie I have ever seen, and no, it isn't even in my top 10 ""movies of all time"".....but, I do feel it is a great coming of age film and deserves to be seen. Shia ROCKS in this movie, and I hope he is given the chance to act in many more films.",1115337600,4,370,3.6962025316455698

1921424,5,B0000D9PNP,"Here's why:

1)From the beginning, they set up the filmmakers to fail by allotting a comparitively meager budget and ridiculously short timeframe to produce a ""Hollywood"" feature. They go way over-budget by spending most of the dough on bloated production costs for a supposedly low-budget picture. It's a big enough crew to work on Braveheart. If they are going to have that kind of staff, they should increase the production costs so that the movie can compete with multi-million dollar blockbusters. Otherwise, get rid of half the staff, and spend more time and money working on the script.

Watch the ""making of"" featurette on the Citizen Toxie bonus dvd. THAT'S low-budget filmaking. And Toxie is a movie that's watchable, too.

2)The producers constantly bad-mouth their last Project Greenlight film, Stolen Summer. ""It's a REAL MOVIE this year,"" says Affleck.

3)The directors show their dismay for allowing Chris Balis, the awful producer of the last project, to produce their movie. Cut to Balis wolfing down a bagel. Its obvious Chris Moore brought him on so he could have someone under his thumb. When Balis wisely suggests that there should be another editor on the movie other than the directors, to allow for a diffent point of view, Moore responds,""I see producing as supporting the directors' process, not subverting it!"". Balis is left impotent for the rest of the production. (Balis was right. The directors end up cutting the film and the movie is awful.).

4)Moore blames everyone else for the faults of the movie, yet its his hands-off approach (read: he's never there), allowing the directors to do whatever they want, that in large part is what's responsible for the movie's failure. When he asks the writer on the set how she could allow the directors to run roughshod over her script, after giving her no power at all to prevent it, she rightly responds,""F-You, Dude!""

5)The only time EXECUTIVE PRODUCER Ben Affleck arrives on the set, its with superstar girlfriend J-Lo. Not too disruptive to a production, is it? Reminds me of when Elizabeth Taylor would show up to Richard Burton's set with her whole entourage.

6)We see Good ol' Matt Damon at the beginning of the series, when they choose the winners, and then at the end, when filming is finished. He doesn't even show up at the premeire, but cuts a ten second closing comment for the series from another location. However, he's wearing a Project Greenlight hat, so he must have been deeply involved. HAW!! I want to be an EXECUTIVE PRODUCER, too!

Can't wait for Season Three!!",1094515200,8,2560,4.923433874709977
1921425,5,B0000D9PNP,"This movie caught me off guard, I had no real idea what the film was about.  The opening scene really throws the audience off guard and I felt it set a nice tone for the rest of the movie.  Sure the movie might be a bit of a teen movie, but the battle re-enactments and unique characters sets it apart from the rest of the genre.

Overall, the movie has a great personality.  It kept me smiling and curious the whole way through and in the end, everything was tied together pretty well. This is a great movie to watch when you are bored and looking for something different.",1091232000,,573,4.229357798165138
1921426,4,B0000D9PNP,"The time and budgets are shortened and the stress levels are high on all of the winners of the PGL contest.  But let's face it. that makes for some good reality TV.
The Battle of Shaker Heights has as much class as any movie in it's genre.  It has heart and humor, well balanced and does the three project winners proud.  The DVD, yes I actually bought and watched it BEFORE writing my review, has a little more of a glimpse into what really went on behind the scenes and not just the good for Reality TV stuff.  These are some great talents that were put in a situation to make them look bad.  It is good TV but not good business for the PGL Executives.
I recommend you get the DVD, watch the movie with commentary, and see a glimpse of some of the stuff that was cut from the series.  These items shed a little more light on the fun the cast and crew had making the film and the dedication that was much more dramatic than blowing a few conflicts out of proportion.
To all the players in PGL, I commend the effort, and hope that those who put the show together can try not to use shock value in the future and show us why these people really do have a reason to love their work.",1089849600,9,1180,4.108695652173913

I only hope the muttonheads who think that any of the ordinary people on Project Greenlight were depicted in an accurate light grow up and grow up fast.

1921430,3,B0000D9PNP,"If you watched season 2 of HBO's Project Greenlight you know that the writer of ""The Battle Of Shaker Heights"" wrote more than just a 79 minute movie. The filmmakers turned the film into something much less than it was on paper. There were so many scenes that were shot, that were deleted from the final cut (which has many movie fans asking ""Where is the deleted scenes on the DVD"") Yes, (cutting scenes) this is true for any movie and you might say all movies don't have 12 episodes on the making of... that show you what you're missing. So perhaps Project Greenlight hurt the film more than it helped it. Still in all anyone would have been able to see that this movie is missing something. What it isn't missing is a great character and an even better performance from Shia La Beouf. His work is the high light of the movie. THE BATTLE OF SHAKER HEIGHTS received mixed reviews, but everyone can agree Shia La Beouf is a fine actor and his work here will be easy to remember.",1088035200,5,978,4.3791208791208796
1921431,1,B0000D9PNP,"Maybe, but without the Force.  But, you can see his considerable ass break a rather sturdy chair.  I agree that this show and the ""contest"" are pure scams, and are designed like a joke to catch decent, well-meaning contestants in a trap designed to humiliate them.  It's painful to watch, unfair, and certainly not worth owning.  Of course, this may be all Ben Affleck has left after his string of awful movies.

1921432,1,B0000D9PNP,"In its second season, Project Greenlight demonstrated--with crystal clarity--its true designs:  to destroy decent, talented people for the sake of television ratings and money.  Let's be clear about this.  PGL isn't about giving amateurs a fair shot at making a feature film.  They're given almost no time, a half-baked script, whining, semi-talented overseers, and a editing room intent on twisting words and events to make the two young directors look like fools.
Thankfully, Ben Affleck and Chris Moore didn't need PGL to make themselves look like fools.  And that may be the ultimate truth here--misery loves company.",1087516800,21,621,5.360824742268041
1921433,3,B0000D9PNP,"Shame, this. ""The Battle of Shaker Heights"" is a slight time-waster with some fun dialogue and great performances. But there's a much stronger, deeper movie in here somewhere. Unfortunately, that movie is somewhere on the Mirimax cutting room floor.
This year's installment of ""Project Greenlight"" was really amusing. I liked all three of the winners - Kyle, Efram and Erica - and the movie seemed like it had potential to be a great one. But K & E, who seemed to get unfairly villified as arrogant control freaks, were unprepared to get slammed against the Mirimax machine.
They made mistakes. They weren't team players. But they have talent and an honest vision, and their movie really could have been great. Instead, we have this, a 75-minute lightweight job that touches on many subjects and characters, only to ""resolve"" them with two-sentence exchanges.
Think of all the missed opportunities here. The parents. The fiance. The bully, who is fascinatingly literate and short of stature. Bart's parents. And, most importantly, Kelly himself. Shia's performance is deeply perceptive and natural, but this cut of the movie refuses to let us see the source of Kelly's anger and intelligence. All we get is an awkward ""One day I got angry"" speech.
There's a heart in ""The Battle of Shaker Heights,"" and there's genuine talent on the screen and behind the cameras. Unfortunately, the Chris Moore's and Harvey Weinstein's of the world have molded that heart and talent into a shapeless piece of throwaway Mirimax entertainment.",1077753600,2,1525,5.079681274900398
1921434,4,B0000D9PNP,"I watched Project Greenlight when Battle of Shaker Heights was featured. Getting a fly-on-the-wall perspective of the movie making process was fascinating. The show allowed a glimpse of the angst the writer experienced having her story re-written a few times to suit the directors' vision. Conflicts between the directors and the writer and producers as well as Mirimax execs made it seem the movie would not finish successfully.
Sadly, the movie was only released in a limited number of cities and theaters, and probably wasn't the blockbuster hit originally hoped for.
I believe the movie was a huge success in a couple of ways: great writing and super acting by Shia LeBeouf. Witty subtleties in the dialogue can be attributed to brilliant writing. I hope Erica, the writer (also listed in the credits as a bridesmaid), didn't have to compromise as much as it seems she did during the course of Project Greenlight.
I think this was a breakthrough performance for Shia. He artfully and comically captured Kelly's (his character) intriguing mix of angst, passion, self-deprecating humor, knowledge and intellect. I was captivated by his passion, pitied him for being a bully target, and was mad at him for his resentment aimed at his freshly sober dad.
The movie was lacking in plot and character development, especially the relationship between Kelly and his father. This, I believe, was due in great part to editing, and not the original story. Another area I felt the movie lacked was the crush Kelly had on his best friend's sister. It didn't seem particularly believable and more awkward than anything. Hooray that in the end Kelly chose his friend-coworker. That was a much more believable and endearing match.
Though I wouldn't categorize the movie as Oscar-worthy, all in all, it was very sweet and cleanly pulled together. It held my attention and left me loving and empathizing with Kelly.",1075075200,6,1900,5.034920634920635
1921435,4,B0000D9PNP,"This is a well written, entertaining film from the Project Greenlight series.  Kelly is beautifully acted by young Shia LaBleuf (his performance is worth watching the movie alone).  Shaker Heights follows 17-year old Kelly has he progresses from rebellious smart alleck to a caring adolescent.  Kelly's off the cuff remarks are humorous throughout as he often ""says whatever enters his mind"".  Kelly befriends Bart through their mutual interest in war reenactments.  Bart's sister Taddy quickly becomes Kelly's object of affection.  Kelly's attempts at courting Taddy are also often humorous.
Shaker Heights clocks in at under 80 minutes.  I recommend that this is time well spent.",1075075200,3,681,5.428571428571429

I especially like that the movie was changed into a comedy (instead of a drama-comedy), and felt lucky that I was able to see the grueling process of how the movie was made. Left out were the sappy scenes of Kelly crying in his mother's arms (and the father joining in a group hug), and the violent scene of his father pushing him up against the garage door. The film didn't need it, and I'm glad it was cut (even though it was the reason Shia took on the role, as it reminded him of his own family). The voice do-overs worked well to show Sarah resigning from the grocery store night shift while Kelly was putting cat food on the shelves (using the same film footage shot earlier for a different scene, which was brilliantly incorporated after Kelly commented that there were more selections of cat foods than baby foods), and having Tabby comment that all Kelly did was kiss her (not sleep with her, as implied in the original film footage). It was brilliant how the final cut was edited. It reflects a comedy about the coming of age of a young and intelligent boy with a vivid imagination, who eventually learns to discern the difference between fantasy and reality. This movie was better than I expected. I ended up loving it, the characters (even Lance), and I highly recommend it.",1441238400,,1441,4.482889733840304
