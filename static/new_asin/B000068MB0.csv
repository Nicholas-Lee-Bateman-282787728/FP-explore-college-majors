7964213,2,B000068MB0,"This is awful Softcore, with no real Nudity to speak of and this is the Unrated Version!. I hate to see what the R Rated version looks like. However, if you actually like a real story and less Nudity in your Softcore then I guess this is for you. I don't recall if it was in 4:3 or Widescreen but I think 4:3 and the Picture quality was OK. I think Mia has only one brief sex scene in the entire movie unfortunately.",1402185600,,416,4.024096385542169

Believe me when I say that once you're finished watching this movie, you would wish that you had this experience of a lifetime. WATCH IT AND ENJOY IT FOR SURE!!!",1338681600,,259,4.777777777777778
7964215,3,B000068MB0,"Let me start by saying that as a b-movie fan, I enjoy adult spoofs of mainstream movies.  The campiness, the corny acting, the lack of decent special effects and of coure the titalation factor are all essential to appeal of this genre.  Sexual Matrix, however is not a parody of The Matrix, but rather just another average soft-core skin flick.
Ken Ashbrook( Jay Stewart ) is a professor at Morgan University who is conducting experiments on the students of the college with the help of a seven million dollar scientific grant to perfect his virtual reality software.  He submits his subjects to a virtual renditions of their deepest sexual desires, because as he explains it they are what drive us most strongly and are therefore easier to pick up on.  To make sure that professor Ken isn't just using his research as an excuse to get his jollies off, the powers that be send an assistant in the form of the pretty, but timid Stacy Lovejoy ( Mia ) to monitor his progress.  His subjects are easily recruited with a 50 dollar incentive and since they are simple college kids, obviously have no problem getting their virtual freak on.
For what it is, Sexual Matrix is pretty good.  The soft-core scenes are more or less entertaining despite some rather lame-brained editing ( a later fantasy on a plane with a lovely red-headed stewardess comes to mind ), and the various student stereotypes are somewhat amusing.  The bad girl, the horny science teacher, the cheating young wife, heck even the typical fast-talkin' Texas gal.  As a Texan myself, you know it's bad when the lone star girl is from Dallas, a cowgirl, hardcore into the rodeo scene and claims that the only other "" new, big"" thing to do in Dallas is to watch the Stars play!  She even states, "" Can you belive they have ice hockey in Texas? "", at one point!
The only features on the dvd are the trailers for Sexual Matrix, as well as for three other videos from the company and a bio on some of the "" stars "" .  At any rate, if you' re looking for a soft-core romp this weekend you could do a lot worse than this.",1063324800,18,2076,4.482758620689655
