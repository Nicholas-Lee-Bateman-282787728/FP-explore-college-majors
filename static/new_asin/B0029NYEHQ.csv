Like another reviewer wrote, it really is packed with great information and goes into more detail than the small sections covered in the Mislabeled Child book.  I loved that it gave some good, concrete recommendations.  Yes, there are a couple of quality issues with the DVD - it is basically a non-professional recording, I think, of a presentation the Eides gave on dyslexia and dysgraphia.  But the quality does not detract from the material at all and I am so grateful for the material.  Thank you Eides!  Your work and sharing that work through youtr books and DVDs like these have made such a difference in my child's life!",1362528000,,662,4.672413793103448
8357998,2,B0029NYEHQ,"I bought this in an effort to understand my daughter's dyslexic/dysgraphic issues. The quality of the DVD is poor, with obviously no attempt at editing an on-line presentation. The information is good however I was frustrated by the lack of quality as well as the umms and ahs of these renown speakers. I could have read the slides myself and gotten as much out of the presentation. Very little in depth discusion was offered. I realize that there is very little information out there regarding Stealth dyslexia and handwriting,therefore it is easy for these folks to take advantage of parents who are desparate for the information. I am disappointed to say the least.",1294444800,,668,4.920353982300885
8357999,4,B0029NYEHQ,"If you ""think"" your child may have writing issues and they are gifted (or you suspect they are) definitely get this DVD. It really is packed with a ton of information and goes further in detail than the small sections covered in the Mislabeled Child. It also doesn't skimp on recommendations and gives you a number of options to choose from.
The only reason for 3 stars is there are a couple of quality issues with the DVD, but nothing to take away from the material.",1253404800,5,467,4.441860465116279
