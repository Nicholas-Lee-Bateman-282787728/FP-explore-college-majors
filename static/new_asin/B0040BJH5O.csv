Now, 45 years later I was able to finally see it again on Amazon Prime thanks to Cinema Epoch, and it still impresses. It would be easy to dismiss it because of it's low budget and occasional pretensions, but it nevertheless tells a classic story. This film represents one of those rare instances when a low-budget actually enhances a film, and makes it more authentic and believable. Contrary to some of the other reviews here, it is not a ""Bad Seed"" kind of movie. A sex scene in the movie, involving the boy and his sitter, would probably result in criminal charges today. Scott Jacoby was an extraordinary young actor and Joan Hackett has always been one of my favorites, sadly she died young in real life BAXTER! is another film of his I haven't seen in 30+ years. I would love to see it as well. This is a forgotten gem, definitely check it out",1523059200,,966,4.313186813186813
8463368,5,B0040BJH5O,"This is a totally underrated masterpiece.
One of my favorite films.
Great time capsule of New York in the 1970's.
All the actors are great and Scott Jacoby's feature debut is so impressive.
I hope there are some bonus features included.",1284076800,5,236,4.780487804878049
