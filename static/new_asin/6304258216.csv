Cheap-looking and, on occasion, lackadaisical in execution, sure, but also truly over-the-top and unashamed of its crudeness and lowest-common-denominator urges, it's like a Jack Chick anti-rock music Bible tract crossed with a '70s John Waters film, and includes a live rock band-accompanied multiple gang-rape scene; a chopped-off lady's hand in a box (eeeeeeeee!); the eye-poppingly endowed Princesa Lea nude and strutting it (boi-oi-oi-OIING!), girl punk rocker bank robbers disguised as nuns (the opening scene!), plus some of the most abominable tonsorial and sartorial choices ever committed to film (even for a Mexican film from the '80s), and the ear-wormiest, most incessantly repeated theme song since ""Let It Go""!",1449792000,2,950,5.25

A follow-up is La venganza de los punks (1991).",1426550400,,111,4.238095238095238

7866719,1,6304258216,"What an awful mess! How did Princesa Lea, Martha Elena Cervantes, and Ana Luisa Peluffo ever agree to appear in this shocker! This stupid movie was about a cowardly biker gang, that went on a senseless rampage of crime and violence. These idiots looked like circus clowns on motorcycles!! And the most annoying thing, was this obnoxious song with the title of the movie ""Intrepidos punks"", that kept playing over and over! This was really awful stuff! There was even a young Rosita Bouchot playing one of the gang members. The very pretty Angelica Ruiz had a very small uncredited part (albeit sans nudity!). The DVD picture quality was actually very good (the movie wasn't). NTSC, Spanish (no English subtitles), NR 84 mins. (the DVD case reads 98 mins?)

Love and Peace,
Carlos Romero",1335312000,,786,4.865671641791045
