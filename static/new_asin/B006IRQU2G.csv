Yes, you can watch it, but it's not the quality you expect from modern-day DVDs. It's one thing if the video isn't digitally remastered, which this isn't, but this is poor even by regular standards. How could they release it like this? It's good to have the show available, but hopefully they will release another set that looks a lot better than this.

4991649,4,B006IRQU2G,"MI was one of my all time favorite TV shows; especially the first three seasons with what I consider the original casts.  I especially liked Steven Hill and was disappointed when Peter Graves took over in second season.  But with the remaining cast from the first season Graves did not skip a beat and after a while he became the man.  (His brother James Arness of Gunsmoke fame, was also a favorite of actor of mine and I am glad both achieved fame in their respective shows.)  I was sorely disappointed when Bain and Landau did not return.  So I was excited to see the 88 and 89 seasons which I missed.  This is pretty much in parts updated stories from the original series.  I enjoyed seeing Greg Morris in his cameo roles and his son did a decent job as his successor.  Overall though not as good as the original series.  I did not realize how much cursing had moved into the series for you never heard that so much in the original series.  I hate shows with so much cursing.  Yet, I really enjoyed the one where Barney is left behind.  So for all MI fans this is the best.  I don't particularly care for the movie remakes of TV shows because it is too much of the special effects.  There is still some acting in this series and that is a plus for me.

4991656,5,B006IRQU2G,"Mission: Impossible is a television series that chronicles the missions of a team of secret American government agents known as the Impossible Missions Force (IMF). The show is a revival of the 1966 TV series of the same name. The only actor to return for the series as a regular cast member was Peter Graves who played Jim Phelps, although two other cast members from the original series (Greg Morris and Lynda Day George) returned as guest stars. The other regular cast includes Thaao Penghlis, Tony Hamilton,Phil Morris,Terry Markwell,who only appeared in the first season, and Jane Badler. Bob Johnson was the voice of ""The Disc"".

The events of the series take place 15 years after the last season of the original Mission: Impossible TV series. After his prot&eacute;g&eacute; and successor as leader of the top-secret Impossible Missions Force is killed, Jim Phelps is called out of retirement and asked to form a new IMF team and track down the assassin. His team consists of Nicholas Black, a disguise expert and actor; Max Harte, a strongman; Casey Randall, a model-turned-agent; and Grant Collier, the son of Barney Collier, the IMF's original technology expert, and a technical genius in his own right. After finding the killer, Jim decides to stay on and keep the team together. Midway through season 1, Casey is killed during a mission (becoming the first ongoing IMF agent to be disavowed), and Secret Service agent Shannon Reed replaces her for the remainder of the series. With the exception of this cast change, Phelps' team remains constant throughout the series.

This show does not live up to the original Mission Impossible series of the 1960's. But not every remake will be better than the original for that was a classic series. Nevertheless,this may not be a classic but it still should be considered an excellent series. It definitely gave birth to Mission Impossible fans to the new generation. Added to that,it will still a good show to watch despite the fact that it only lasted two seasons.

Compared to the Mission Impossible films made by Tom Cruise,I still prefer this series considering that it still fun to see the IMF team work as a team and the integrity of Jim Phelps to remain intact. It was definitely a travesty to see the first Mission Impossible film by Cruise turn Jim Phelps into a villain in order to make the Tom Cruise character - Ethan Hunt - the primary IMF agent and the rest of the films become primarily ""The Ethan Hunt Show"".",1440633600,7,2478,4.839622641509434

4991663,5,B006IRQU2G,"I'm a huge fan of the original series but I honestly have grown to prefer the 80s series. They were going to reboot it, but in the last minute they decided to give the characters new names and make it a continuation of the original series, which was a great idea. Especially added by the presence of the Peter Graves as team leader Jim Phelps, and Phil Morris playing the team's tech wizard (who is the son of Jim Morris) who played the same role in the original series and returns for several episodes here too. I could go on about the merits of the rest of the team too, who I think are great. Unlike the original series I feel like there's even more of a sense of comraderie between the IMF force, it's also nice that Peter Graves finally got a chance to emote more, something that the original series producer was adamantly against (they are all deadly serious in the original series, which wears thin eventually). With all this said, the original series is of course a tv classic and Im just happy that this continued the series for two more solid seasons.",1421971200,,1061,4.418367346938775

4991670,5,B006IRQU2G,"A result of a writers strike in the late 80's,  it was decided to make a second generation  series of Mission Impossible episodes.  This series consists of updated versions of re-written scripts from the original 60's series, although you might hardly notice that.

Jim Phelps comes out of retirement,  Barney is replaced by his real life son as the tech  guru, the others are not from the original series but play their parts very well.  Everything is updated to  late 80's technology in regards to all of the "" tools of the trade "" used in these episodes.

Video and Audio quality are the same as with the original  Mission Impossible series on DVD, absolutely excellent.  For anyone that has the complete set of the  1960's Mission Impossible, I would say these are must haves as I doubt Mission Impossible will ever be made again. I have watched many of the original series over and over again and I am sure I will of these as well.  There is just so much detail crammed into each episode, every time you watch one of them over again more  not before noticed detail will come out.

8498844,3,B006IRQU2G,"I am glad I watched all the episodes before reviewing, because if I'd followed my first impulse and done so after discs 1 and 2, I would probably have given this only one star. Why? Because most of the episodes were near-perfect copies of episodes from the original series. Not only that, they weren't even the best episodes. In fact, most of them even kept the titles and large chunks of the dialog. The most substantial changes are in the form of more impressive technology.

Take the series premier episode. It's a retelling of Season 5's ""The Killer,"" transplanted to London and with John De Lancie stepping into the Robert Conrad role. He even squashes three fake golf balls into his explosive. Biggest difference? He attacks from the floor below instead of the floor above.

This ""double exposure"" was more than occasionally disconcerting. For example, ""The System""  is a nearly exact duplicate right down to the dialog, but with Peter Graves stepping into the role played by Martin Landau. It was interesting to see how a different actor interpreted identical lines, but to anyone familiar with the original series, there was a palpable sense of ""wrongness.""

Generally, the cast is likeable. Greg Morris's son, Phil, steps in as Barney's son, Grant, an even more impressive tech wizard than his father. Thaao Penghlis is the team's master of disguise, and brings a cool, urbane sensibility to the role. Antony Hamilton was the muscle, but had more range as an actor than Peter Lupus had. The original female lead, Terry Markwell was killed in the line of duty and officially ""disavowed."" Which brings up a side point. This is supposedly an American team, and all team members have American passports, but only Graves and Morris speak American English. When Jane Badler joined the cast, the ""American"" team members moved into the majority. Peter Graves looks dreadful here. It's hard to believe he was only in his early sixties when these were shot. He looks at least a decade older. But he does get the occasional good line, such as wry comments on the changes wrought by time.  Greg Morris had the occasional guest spot as Barney Collier. For example, in ""The Condemned."" he takes the place of Kevin Hagen as Jim's friend, ""unjustly convicted  of murder.""  There are a few original twists, but for the most part if you've seen the Season 2 episode, you've seen the 1988 version.

But when the show produces original plots, things pick up a bit. The cast is likeable and the plots above average, if not up to the quality of the original series. Mildly entertaining but not memorable.",1518048000,5,2591,4.832957110609481
