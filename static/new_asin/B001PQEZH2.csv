3756383,5,B001PQEZH2,"This story is far important than the theatrical presentation of it. The introduction of Social Science evidence and the Supreme Court's treatment of it is the key element in Richard Kluger's book which this videoplay is taken from. If the sequence with the dolls is not gut-wrenching enough for you then you are craving the wrong things, in my opinion.",1360627200,,352,4.883333333333334
3756384,4,B001PQEZH2,"This is one of the very best films of our time.  Peter Francis James is a SUPERB actor.
This is why I am not happy with the producers cutting parts out for the DVD. I always felt that the DVD would be preserving the best , well, this is not so.  Some of the final argument was deleted.  Would you believe that  the final argument was actually better?  @Barbara Marshall: Remember the part in the final argument when Thurgood said: ""The children go down the road TOGETHER, they play ball TOGETHER."" This movie was just too good for any of the parts to be deleted.",1359158400,,562,4.314285714285714
3756385,4,B001PQEZH2,"The film is a view of the life of Thurgood Marshall (Peter Francis James) from his beginning of law school under Charles Hamilton Houston (James Avery) to its climax with his Brown vs. The Board of Education argument before the Supreme Court. I see it as an excellent educational tool as it not only delves into the problem of segregation but also shows how the Court operated and the decisive role played by the newly appointed Chief Justice Earl Warren.

My main criticism is that the acting and intensity was soft. There were times they could have created some real drama, but ""they"" either cut it out, or didn't do it. For instance, Marshall was about to lose his case. He had one final argument to make. The night before he says to his wife, ""They know what this is about."" At this point they should have taken some liberty with the facts...his wife touches him on the shoulder and says, ""Then use that Thurgood."" Yes Thurgood does use it, but there was no epiphany movement followed by a late night composition that would have made his climax argument when he shames the court for the Plessy vs Ferguson decision more dramatic.

3756386,4,B001PQEZH2,"I love this film and have shown the VHS version to my American Government students for several years. I was thrilled when it was finally released on DVD! Then, as I was showing the DVD version for the first time, I realized a number of scenes had been cut. Altogether nearly 25 minutes of the original version has been deleted for the DVD version! At 137 minutes, the original was not too long, in my opinion, and I see no improvement with the cuts. In fact, I feel the second half of the film suffers for the cuts that were made. I would give the original version 5 stars, but due to the cuts, am only willing to give it 4.",1323820800,4,624,4.1652892561983474
3756387,4,B001PQEZH2,I enjoyed this movie because it shows the beginning of Thurgood Marshall's Law Practice and him being actively involved in desegregation of the schools in the South. I believe the story is told realistically and to the point where everyone can understand it.,1301011200,,258,5.023255813953488
8334294,5,B001PQEZH2,"This is a very engrossing movie. My students had loved it.

I know what it's like to be denied opportunities because of my gender and even my skin color, considering where I live I'm a minority, but I cannot even fathom being denied an education because of the color of one's skin.

I can't imagine what was done to the movie to make it 40 minutes, or why it was butchered so much. Whatever was done to it, it cannot be good. Someone stated she has a copy that is an hour and 37 minutes. Mine is 2 hours and 12 minutes from opening to closing credits. I wonder what was done to her copy.

I came looking for the movie on DVD, but won't waste my money on something so obviously inferior. Instead, I ripped the VHS to my computer. It's not the greatest quality, considering how old the videotape is, but it's still pretty good. At least I get the whole thing.

Did PBS butcher the movie to make it fit a class period? If so, that wasn't a good idea. One simply shows it over several days. I'd rather students view it over several days and get the entire story than have them short-changed with an inferior copy.",1524268800,,1109,4.241706161137441

8334297,5,B001PQEZH2,Best video I have ever showed any students I have ever had- junior high/high school. I bought one for my government teacher and begged her to show it to her seniors.,1467590400,,165,4.354838709677419
8334298,5,B001PQEZH2,Great Movie.  VERY Well done about Justice.  It is sad what the white man did to the innocent children.,1465430400,,103,4.368421052631579

Fast service, for sure!!!! Thanks so much guys. I SO APPRECIATE IT. I tend to go alittle crazy when buying the movies. LOL",1411257600,,271,4.551020408163265

8334301,5,B001PQEZH2,I would recommend this movie to any history buff or anyone interested at looking into the strategies involved in over turning the case of Plessy v Ferguson. Great acting and good pacing for such an important time in our American History experience.,1370476800,,248,4.928571428571429
8334302,5,B001PQEZH2,"Yet another of those 'saw-it-at-the-library..."" With lots of background to the Brown decision, this American Experience offering should be part of school curricula, as far as I'm concerned. Great performances, insight into how the Supreme Court decided things during the 50's -- just all around good. Good accompaniment to Richard Kluger's book of the same name.",1366156800,,362,5.482142857142857
8334303,2,B001PQEZH2,"I have the original American Experience version I recorded on VHS. It is the most dramtic/moving and well-told version of this important story. I was excited to find a DVD of the movie, as I fear my VHS won't last much longer. However, this version is heavily edited and edits out some key scenes. For example, the trial on the very title case, Brown, is not shown!  Again, great original move. Wish it was brought to DVD as originally filmed/aired.",1365120000,4,449,4.6125
