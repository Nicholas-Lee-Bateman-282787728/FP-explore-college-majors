3987304,5,B002U4UZSQ,"I have yet to watch Dreamcatcher but I bought this for the other three movies, and for the price it was well worth it. The only complaint I have, and for some it may be a positive, is that the movies are on two discs instead of four, as it says in the description. I personally like having all of my movies separated but it does add space in the DVD binder. Overall I recommend this product to anyone interested, even if you only want one of the movies.",1357430400,2,453,4.101123595505618

I recommend this to ANYONE who loves horror films!",1337299200,4,204,3.951219512195122
3987308,5,B002U4UZSQ,Was such a good deal for 4 movies my family couldn't pass up. We love family time so this was a great find.,1336780800,3,107,3.6956521739130435
3987309,4,B002U4UZSQ,"As with any movie, or collection, it depends what your personal preferences are.

All these movies are what I'd describe as horror mystery thrillers. I certainly wouldn't class any of them as ""PG"".

Gothica is well written, well directed, reasonable acting with a decent storyline. The sets are good, the costumes and make up excellent, there's really nothing that takes your attention away from the movie being presented by screaming ""fake"" at you when you're just getting engrossed.

Queen of the Damned likewise shares the good points from Gothica while being a vampire based movie. The story here is very far fetched but spun in such a way as to be totally engrossing within the frame presented.

Dreamcatcher has a more oblique storyline decent directing and average acting. It's very much a different take on the genere, but one which I thoroughly enjoyed and having watched it I'm surprised it didn't do a little better at the box office.

Ghost Ship was the better storyline, but was let down in some other respects, though it had an interesting twist at the finale. This movie certainly takes the watcher into the real of ""not everything is always what it seems"".

All in all a decent collection, with no movie falling into the 'B' category. Not a bad buy overall, I'd recommend it for anyone who likes the genere.",1285545600,17,1323,4.8061674008810575

Not to mention superb actor Robert Doney Jr. Lots of scary scenes and pleanty of action .
Ghost ship has really good special effects and lots of spooky scenes. Queen of the damned not a great movie but
enjoyed watching the late aleyah as a vampiar vixen. Have not scene Dreamcatcher yet,hope its good!.",1401667200,4,409,4.774647887323944

3987336,4,B002U4UZSQ,"I bought this because of Ghost Ship, a spooky film with a great cast (Gabriel Byrne, Julainne Margoils, Karl Urban), and it still holds up, though the movie it rips off, the Event Horizon is still the better film. Gothika features a great Academy Award winning performance by Haley Berry, Rober Downey Jr. is also in it before his career comeback in Iron Man. Queen of the Damned provides interest only because its lead died so tragically as the movie was released: the premise of the movie, a vampire as a rock star, well, it really isn't explored, and Dreamcatcher makes absolutely no sense at all, it has to be one of Stephen KIng's worst works. All films are worth seeing, at least!",1395964800,,686,4.585365853658536
