6261447,5,B00IETWWXW,NICE FOUND FOOTAGE MOVIE WITH A CLEVER AND UNEXPECTED ENDING!!!,1404259200,,63,5.4
6261448,5,B00IETWWXW,"This isn't your typical ""horror"" movie. The suspense of what is going to happen next will keep you on the edge of your seat. It has a super storyline that keeps you going in order to figure out what it is. The actors do a great job. They're really natural and you can definitely feel their fear! Awesome!!",1399852800,,305,4.275862068965517
6261449,5,B00IETWWXW,"a great suspenseful movie, the actors are great, a must see. hold on to your loved one when you watch it",1399334400,,104,4.0
6261450,5,B00IETWWXW,Love found footage so definitely glad I came across this movie!!!,1530835200,,65,5.0
6261451,5,B00IETWWXW,"I love shaky terrible foundfootage films. I loved Cloverfield even though it made me throw up. (I get bad motion sickness)

The thing you have to accept about this movie is that you will never actually know what is going on. There is no villain telling you the plot or some genius to figure it out. These are ordinary idiots on a camping trip and they act just like they should and don't randomly supply scientific explanations. I am so okay with that.

The cast was awesome at acting exactly like some around college age friends on a camping excursion. They react and scream and tremble incredibly well. The terror was superb!

I watch tons of horror movies of all grades and I appreciate all unique flavors of the genre. This government experiment/camping gone wrong/boogeymonster you never get too good a look at/crazed zombie mash up was awesome! I appreciated this movie and the bad/good gore.",1530316800,,898,4.743589743589744
6261452,1,B00IETWWXW,Awful. If 0 stars was an option that would be what this film deserves.,1529193600,,70,4.071428571428571

6261455,2,B00IETWWXW,"This movies takes four previously beaten-to-death ideas and mashes them together. Blair Witch + unknown creature + zombies + found footage = confused, directionless mess. There are no unique ideas here and simply putting a bunch of them together doesn't make it unique; it makes the movie a bad video facsimile x 4.",1526860800,,315,4.962264150943396

6261459,3,B00IETWWXW,"This is a very ambitious, low budget, found footage horror flick. 9 times out of 10, you'd bet a movie like this wouldn't be very good, but this is that rare movie that actually pulls it off. It has plenty of jump scares, a knack for doing weird stuff that makes you go, ""What the hell is that,"" and a great twist that I didn't see coming. Amazon doesn't have a 3 and a half star rating. If they did, that's where I'd put this one and that's not too shabby for a horror film. If you enjoy B horror movies, I think you'll not only like this film, you will be surprised at how much you like it. I certainly was.",1525132800,,609,4.0
6261460,4,B00IETWWXW,"It starts off badly. I gave it a second chance based on the reviews, and it ended up getting much better. But you really have to suffer through the first half of the thing. 3.5 stars.",1525046400,,183,4.111111111111111
6261461,5,B00IETWWXW,WOW! Amazing! What a fantastic found footage film. Say that four times fast. Intense and interesting. I like it. Would definitely buy it someday. Big 5 Stars.,1523664000,,158,4.888888888888889
6261462,5,B00IETWWXW,"I wanted to give this one some love.  No, I do not know the filmmaker or anyone in the cast.

I am a sucker for found footage.  It's my guilty pleasure.  This is probably the best found footage movie you've never seen.  Seriously.  It starts off with some bros and their chicks, filming their camping trip.  You think it's going to be one of those movies about a bunch of idiots getting drunk and maybe a monster or something in the woods.  Appearances are deceiving, and there's a big surprise in this one, without giving anything away.  Give it a shot - if you enjoy found footage, definitely worth a look.",1523232000,,608,4.405405405405405
6261463,3,B00IETWWXW,"Alright, it really isn't that bad. I'm giving it three stars because the first 3/4 of the movie, while kind of annoying, was actually really well done and I felt like the acting was good. The last 1/4th, though? While not terrible, I feel like it just totally threw away the entirety of the first 3/4ths of the movie and took on an entirely different plot line. As I have seem someone else comment, who was the one scratching words into the trees? Who was the dude in the hospital gown and why was he relevant? Why wasn't he attacked when the two girls were suddenly attacked by that dude? Are they zombies? Are they government experiments gone wrong? I feel like this movie was trying to be bigger than it was -- it felt like two totally different movies shoved together in the same hour and a half feature.
Also my biggest concern was why Brett, Ashley, and Abi all stayed for as long as they did? Because they didn't want to leave Ryan? Why not just take off in the RV while Ryan is sleeping and take the consequences later? Why did Ashley and Abi wait so long to look for Ryan? I don't know... The motivations of these characters, their reasoning, and the plotline just feels so unfinished. I felt like it could have been really good but the director/writers were too ambitious in their writing and just wanted the movie to be bigger than it was.",1522886400,,1350,4.404

6261466,4,B00IETWWXW,"OK, I have to agree that if you want a movie where everything is all tied up in a neat little, bloody bundle, then this movie is not for you.  If you want a movie that has blood, guts (strewn all over the floor - horrible FX by the way), and no semblance of WTF is going on, then this movie is for you.  I found it to be likeable considering I was watching this waiting for the day to go by.  Yes, there is no dialogue at the end except for a few ""strangers"" who were firing at them and then not firing at them, kept telling them to keep up but don't stop recording, AND a whole lot of whining and screaming from our starlets, and the plot was holier than our deacon at Sunday mass, but it was still an ok movie.  I wouldn't add it to my collection or anything but it did its job - I watched it for 1 1/2 hours and didn't get up at the end wondering why the hell I didn't turn it off!  Of course, I probably did lose a few brain cells along the way, but I still liked it.",1521417600,,971,3.810945273631841
6261467,4,B00IETWWXW,I really enjoyed the way they show more monsters than any movie in this genre.  The last section is a real puzzler but I quite liked this film overall,1521072000,,150,4.172413793103448
6261468,1,B00IETWWXW,"This is truly one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. If I had to describe this movie it would be as follows. Its like the directors, editors, writers and everyone sat down had a huge thanksgiving dinner, stretching out their stomachs to the point where they burst, then vomiting it all up having a seizure in their own puke then they made this movie. The whole thing is a huge mix of almost every horror/thriller movie I have ever seen. It first begins with the classic group of friends going camping and experiencing paranormal things. Then everything blows up into this horrible creation the writers have decided to curse this Earth with. This movie contains government conspiracy, plague, mental asylum patients, CSI, drinking, lots of unnecessary screaming, crying and gunfire. Its like a bunch of college kids who have too much money for their own good got drunk and created this movie. During this whole movie I saw little editing value, it looks like the whole thing was put together using Imovie. Not only is the production of this movie complete trash, but so are the characters decisions. I don't know about you but, I have this thing called common sense so if something is knocking on my RV, I am not going to go running outside to get away from it if it can't get into the RV. Don't worry I am almost finished with my rant. This movie would have been so much better as a short film where everyone dies. The second part of the movie you can't see anything because the camera is too ""glitchy"". Also in the second part of the movie, there is little to no dialogue. There is also the random guy that shows up with a gun and a flask halfway through the movie. WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT. Literally this random guys shows up at the group's campsite and asks them if they've seen a dog lately. He then shows them that he has a gun then puts some wood on the fire. Then he just walks into the woods. What relevance does that have to the non-existent plot line of the movie. Then finally at the end of the movie SPOILERS: the girl is saved and there is no explanation to the whole thing. Personally I could have made a better film and I have no experience whatsoever. The sasquatch creatures are obviously just people in gillie suits crawling around trying to make minimum wage to support their families. I truly feel bad for the people who have been unfortunate enough to have crossed paths with this movie. I hope that the writers can realize that this is not what they were meant to do in life and find another profession soon. This would fit into the category of 'horror' if horror meant horrible movie. You know when you watch a movie trailer and it looks kind of sketchy but, you watch the movie and it becomes your favorite movie. This is the exact opposite. I saw a decent trailer with my family and we all thought it looked like a decent movie. We watched it today and we all agreed that it felt like a virtual reality seizure. I want to warn everyone to not watch this movie EVER. It is one of the worst things to curse this Earth since oatmeal raisin cookies. Thank you for listening to my rant but, it needed to be said. I hope nobody is ever unfortunate enough to see this monstrosity of a movie.",1518134400,2,3219,4.402684563758389
6261469,5,B00IETWWXW,"People, keep in mind this is a lower budget film. That being said, huge surprise in how well this film is shot. Going into this with low expectations probably helped, but I can't deny the effort here. Acting is probably its biggest strength, top notch and believable. Sound would be another strength, properly placed and enhanced the experience. The two male leads did seem a little douchey at times, but not overly obnoxious. The main threat leading into the end, itself,  was a little generic looking, but more than made up for in build up and the nail biting last 25 minutes of the film where it just goes off the rails in a good way.  Its not perfect, but people are being way too hard on this.  Mostly due to being found footage, which if that isn't your thing, fair enough, but don't give it a bad review just because its not your cup of tea.",1517875200,,848,4.388535031847134
6261470,1,B00IETWWXW,"This isn't movie. It's a bunch of stuff on film that's been edited together. There is no script to speak of. The 1st part of the movie is your usual ""friends going off to film for no real reason, let's get drunk and yell at each other/make out"". The 2nd part of the movie is running and screaming. No, really, that's it -- 2 girls running and screaming. And filming it all so that the footage can be ""found"". Thing is, they're filming with a camera that you really need to hold steady with 2 hands so it's kind of impossible for these running women to have done that and not, you know, DIED. They joke about a space gorilla, but the ... whatever it is that you never really see kind of looks like a space gorilla which is just dumb. I thought they would stumble on information in a lab or something to explain what's going on. No. They run through what could only be a facility in a no-budget film, yelling and screaming -- there is virtually NO dialogue for the last 1/2 of the movie. The monster chasing them and the human ""monsters"" don't make sense and aren't explained. And the appearance of the random freaky hiker -- wtf was up with that? Was that at all necessary? Frankly, it would have been a much better short film where everyone dies in the beginning. Mind you, it would have still been bad, but there would have been so much less yelling and screaming.",1517702400,8,1365,4.315175097276264

6261472,2,B00IETWWXW,"The characters turn into horrible pants-on-head-morons real quick, and the twist in the movie is in the description; you can tell you're in for a bland and shouty ride.

6261474,4,B00IETWWXW,"Excellent movie, but I'll need the DVD or BluRay (sp?) to go over the ending as I simply couldn't keep up with everything.  Be aware that the first half is a bit unlikable, but the second half rocks.",1515542400,,199,4.2368421052631575
6261475,5,B00IETWWXW,Wow. This ended up being a very good movie. Lots of the completely unexpected.,1515456000,,78,4.642857142857143
6261476,5,B00IETWWXW,"Don't believe the bad ratings. This film is very good for what it is. If you don't like found footage films then don't watch it or review it. Much better than the ""Paranormal this"" and ""Paranormal that"" crap. Don't be deceived by the typical ""idiot campers in the forest"" beginning - it becomes much much more. The acting is believable, and the writer and director do a great job of pulling you in to the soap opera of the camper interactions that the story catches you by surprise at a good pace then all hell breaks loose.  I'll see it again after a while - maybe then I'll better understand what happened...

Might just be because the first half was really meh.",1514678400,,322,3.9692307692307693

6261483,5,B00IETWWXW,"I'm a big fan of found footage films. Saw this movie a while back on you-tube. Have not seen anything quite like it since,or even before. While it starts out as your basic group of friends camping in the creepy woods film; it progresses into something totally unexpected and incredible. There's really nothing to compare it to. Anyone giving it a one star rating was just half watching; this film has to be experienced. So happy it has been released on DVD,wish they'd make a sequel.",1500681600,3,483,4.627906976744186

6261485,2,B00IETWWXW,"Okay...in the interest of total disclosure, I am not a fan of ""found footage"" movies, for a variety of reasons, all of which this film has in spades...arrogant idiot city dwellers going totally unprepared into a wilderness situation with poor planning and less skill to deal with even the most mundane of situations. Top that with he fact that every single one of them is a complete vulgarian, who, in their spare time, teaches swearing and foul language to wayward sailors and truck drivers...having said that, this one was fairly scary, even though the plot had more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings...not the worst movie ever made...in fact, fairly good for this genre",1495929600,2,677,4.895652173913043

6261487,5,B00IETWWXW,"Major fear and anxiety grabs you from the first minute and only gets worse and worse (better and better) as the movie progresses. The people who gave this film a bad rating do not understand film. The CREATIVITY level and ORIGINALITY of every development is, I assure you, NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED. (NO SPOILER) The movie moves through a time context from the present until it is as if made 100 years from now--it starts with earthly atmosphere and ends up, well, you never grasp how it ends up unless maybe you stop the film and read the computer screens, which I didn't do. But it ends completely futuristically, with a monster you never really get to see full on, but there is plenty of GORE, and there appear to be more than one, and humans giving birth to more and more. That isn't for sure what's happening, but from a human camping story this film flies into a futuristic scene of bizarre terror. MAIN POINT: GUARANTEED THAT YOU HAVE NEVER EVER IN YOUR LIFE SEEN A MOVIE SO STRANGE, SO NON-FULLY-UNDERSTANDABLE, SO CREATIVE, SO UNEXPECTED. THE BAD RATINGS ARE WRONG! WATCH THIS MOVIE!",1495756800,2,1100,4.6461538461538465
6261488,4,B00IETWWXW,"I am a shameless found footage freak.

If you too are a shameless found footage freak, disregard the negative reviews. If you're a shameless found footage freak, you need to see this movie. Actually, you might as well just add it to your collection already, because it's one of the best POV horror flicks of the last decade.

Part creature feature, part horror-in-the-woods, with a batsh*t insane final act you won't see coming. It's flawed in ways that'll be quite evident to any viewer, but the good outweighs the bad. Well-directed by Howie Adkins, and writer/actor Ryan McCall's script is a balance of tried-and-true tropes and imaginative twists, action-packed turns. The cast is solid and sells the realism seamlessly so, which is vital to the viewer playing along. Atypical to the subgenre but a welcome swerve, 3 outta 4 characters are actually quite likable. The unlikable guy is the archetypal character-who-won't-stop-filming, but as annoying as he gets, we all know he's the pillar who holds the gimmick together. He stops filming, the movie is over. Embrace him.

For years, Evidence had no US distribution, so imagine my excitement upon seeing it available  even if it is a DVD-R. Don't let that dissuade you, by the way: it comes in a rad black case with beautiful cover art and disc label as professional-looking as any DVD you'd buy. The thick black case is a sweet touch.

I rarely jump at intended scares in horror flicks anymore, but there were two different scares that sprung me right off my seat. It's fun, frightening, and the final act is super charged mayhem. It's like REC meets EXISTS, but this is NOT a Bigfoot movie. Happy to have it in my collection.",1495584000,6,1681,4.822916666666667
6261489,2,B00IETWWXW,Didn't hate it but didn't like it. A lot of running around screaming in the dark and tortuous scenes without any story resolution. Waaaay too much running around screaming in the dark.,1494633600,,184,4.78125

It starts out as the typical ""four friends go out in the woods and get drunk before experiencing super-weird, deadly crap"", but took a nice, divergent turn into the sci-fi realm.

Not the best movie I've ever seen (of course), but I've definitely seen worse.  However, I have to take off points for the acting, the cheap ""shaky cam""-ness, and rather stereotypical characters.",1494460800,,504,4.7701149425287355

Of Coarse the guy with the camera is TOTALLY annoying with getting everything on film first and putting the safety of his three friends plus himself in danger. BUT someone had to play that role..right! The beginning may have been a bit slow but the rest of the movie makes up for it by leading you along with them through the dark maze of hallways, holding your breath as they run through-out the building...knowing that their being chased and at any second something scary is going to jump out an attack them. YES, it's a bit shaky but again that's because it's being filmed from a hand held camera,and they need the light to see what's happening & where they're going. I was TOTALLY surprised by who ended up living, and that was great. The whole Military being involved added some craziness to the movie as well. Especially when they first find out that their envolved, and the do a great Mind Screw as they BRIGHTLY introduce themselves leaving you to think WHAT THE HELL!!

So, if you like Zombies and weird Bush/Tree like looking Aliens that are lurking in the dark making strange noises, with an element of surprise and flight or fight....You should enjoy this.

It's worth saluting the creators with genuinely throwing me off initially, as the film takes a rather odd but not unpleasant sudden left turn right as I started to think I knew where it was going.

6261504,4,B00IETWWXW,"Let me preface this review by saying I love found footage horror movies.  I liked Blair Witch, I LOVED all the Paranormal Activity movies... countless others.  This one in comparison to others of its ilk wasn't half bad.  The actors were pretty believable in their reactions to each other, and their fight or flight knee-jerk reactions to the situation.
When all hell breaks loose it turns into a roller coaster that would have been right at home as a ride at Universal Studios, pulled from one tense scene to another.  I got the feeling like I was along for a walk through of a haunted house attraction.  It made me jump a few times (which hardly ever happens), and by the end I was really rooting for the survivors.
The real negative I will say about the movie was near the end the camera got so messed up, it was difficult to make out what was going on, but really that added to the intense confusion.
Overall I really liked it.  If you're into found footage Indy films, you really can't go wrong with Evidence.",1491523200,2,1014,4.454054054054054

Buuuuut now that I've finished it... um, what WAS that? Was it a zombie flick? Was it a video game? Who was the naked guy? Why oh WHY did the two girls give up multiple opportunities to just sit tight and wait for daylight? Who was scratching words into the trees? Why was Brett even there if he was so annoyed the whole time?

If that one statement isn't enough for you, then let me tell you what you're in for.

1) The acting isn't bad, its wretched. Staged sobs, over the top testosterone fueled rage dialogue, a friend that could care less about the welfare of another friend. Nothing about this is believable. A story like this hinges on identifying with your characters, and caring about their survival. Within 15 minutes of the start, I was rooting for the creature.

2) Dialogue needs to be believable. The last I checked no realistic boyfriend threatens to brain his girlfriend with a camera because she doesn't want him to go off chasing high pitched screams in the middle of nowhere. And that's just one sterling gem in this pile of.... stuff. If you watch this and aren't convinced the guys hate each other and the women by the first 20 minutes, Ill be amazed.

3) You did not seriously put an ultra light helo kit in there and try to pass it off as military.....

4) There is nothing redeemable about this movie. Nothing. Not even a single boob shot to give it some sort of sad b rated status. Its just wretched acting, wretched writing, wretched camera work, and the post production was apparently done on a laptop with an FX budget of about 20 bucks.

6261516,1,B00IETWWXW,"Easily one of the most irritating, unlikable found footage films out there.  If you know found footage films, you know there are WAY too many poor efforts available.  And yet this one manages to stand among the top few worst.  This attempt at a film is totally distracting and non-immersive... as you're watching it you just have to wonder if, during filming, they all knew how awful this thing really was... I'd say that they HAD to know.  And I wish they had scrapped the whole thing.

I should say that, like so many found footage films, this didn't have to be a disaster.  There was a chance to do something unusual with the story, or at least interesting.  I don't mind shaky cams and all that, though that could have worked.  But the bad acting is another story.  If the acting is so bad that you can't get even partially immersed in the story, the movie is doomed.  It's not scary, it's not creepy, there's no sense of fear or desperation. This is because on top of the poor acting, you have ridiculously obnoxious and unlikable characters.  Rarely have I wanted a character to meet a grisly end like I did with Ryan.  String together any number of insulting, foul words to describe a person, and you will undoubtedly have a good description of him.  It's hard to imagine he has any friends, much less a girlfriend (speaking of which, Abi is the only somewhat likable character... so good job, for what it's worth). And what friends!  Are LA people really like this?  Are they all vulgar, contemptuous, unappealing miscreants with little to no common sense, screeching like banshees and biting at each others' throats?  What a depressing thought.

I could go on, but you probably get the gist that this is really bad.  If this was a college/high school film project, I'd say ""nice try, better luck next time"".  As it is, I have to plead, ""please please please don't make any more movies, you people!""

One flaw was that out of nowhere (after all the male companions were killed off) the women were all of a sudden in a military base when just one minute ago they were in a thick forest type wilderness. There was no adjustment to the scene to account for it. Then the brunette yelled and screamed through the rest of movie, although it was amusing that once they would find a safe place, she couldn't wait to get outside again to play with the monsters.

6261532,4,B00IETWWXW,"I stumbled upon this movie while trying to get information on another found footage movie also called Evidence,(2013) by Image Entertainment and which is also a very good movie in my opinion. After that happened, I decided to look into this particular movie (directed by Howie Askins), found a number of positive reviews about it on both Amazon and other sites and decided to give it a look.

I cant begin to imagine how many movies of this genre involve teenagers either camping out in the woods during the night (as this one does) or teenagers at a summer camp in the woods at night. For the first 20 minutes or so of this movie, you might think you are seeing a movie thats going to turn out like dozens of others you have already seen. If you hang in there with this movie after that however, you will find a movie thats probably unlike any other you have seen.

As you might expect, strange things begin to happen in the woods. Are they aliens from outer space? Something  supernatural? Bigfoot? Something else? Director Askins quickly manages to get the suspense level fairly high and from there, just keeps building it higher and higher until the movie reaches an ending of an almost unbearable level of intensity. Unfortunately, the ending is also confusing however and you can be forgiven if you are left thinking WTH just happened?

The actors in the movie probably won't be familiar to most viewers but that helps contribute to the sense of authenticity found in this movie (as it does in most other found footage films). The actors also use their real names in this movie. For example, the character Ashley is the actress Ashley Bracken, Abi is Abigail Ritchie, and Brett is Brett Rosenberg.  The character Ryan (who is behind the camera much of the movie) is Ryan McCoy, who is also the movies writer.

Apparently the movie was originally only available in Australia but now can be found on multi region coded (blu-ray only) versions both here on Amazon and on that famous auction site. I found that it was very hard to find on Amazon and didn't show up if I did just a search of just the title Evidence. I had to either search via Google using the search terms Evidence combined with Askins and Amazon on the same line. I was also finally able to find it using the Amazons own search by entering Evidence and Askins on the same line.

I am also reporting that problem directly to Amazon since its obvious that those involved in making and distributing this film put in a lot of hard work into its production (despite its obviously low budget) and they deserve to have it be easier to find. If you like found footage and horror/thriller genres, you should find this movie entertaining and much fun to watchin the safety of your living room!

P.S. I don't think the filmmaker had any idea how long it takes to walk half a mile... I think the average human walks 2-3 mph. I don't know what that stands out to me so much. I've watched the movie twice and it just bothers me how long they make a half mile hike take : )",1432598400,2,512,4.019607843137255
6261535,3,B00IETWWXW,"This video, shot on a budget of just over $14,000, is one of the strangest microbudget indie horror films I've seen, not to mention it's been heavily reviewed on IMDB, so it clearly reached a wide audience despite it being one of the least known found footage films I'm aware of.

Certainly, the ending was unique in that there's no closure, you're just left to wonder what the hell just happened. The characters, too, were certainly odd, though on the whole the actors were quite good. I did think the chaotic feel of the entire film was something folks either loved or hated, at least if you looks through a sampling of reviews on the internet.

Personally, I found myself strangely in the middle. I have to give Howie Askins, the director, (and of course the writer[s] as well) credit for creating what I think is the hallmark of good indie filmmaking: it left an impression on me as a unique experience, for better or worse. I did think that the ending, which seemed to be a character's escape from a government or private corporate lab, from which a virus or some supernatural breeding operation was taking place (and from which the zombies/monsters had escaped) was also interesting, even throughout the end credits.

There were some elements, though, that I felt were flaws. First, the cameraman through the first half of the film actually comes off as a sociopath, though I don't know if that was the filmmakers' intent. Based on that, I found it challenging to understand why the other three chose to not only hang out with him, but be essentially led by him. It was a bizarre byproduct of the script that I couldn't reconcile with the story. Second, I have to say that, for me, the lack of closure at the ending, and the near total chaos didn't provide a level of closure that would have allowed me to enjoy the film. I think that was probably the intent, the ""WTF"" ending, as far as the film and the work as art. Some people loved that. For me, it didn't work. But, again, I have to say it was certainly unique, and I do like the fact that I was disturbed by what ending there was - I think that's a sign, again, of good art. It certainly was not a lazy ending - it was clearly intentional, so I have to give props there. Just because I didn't care for it doesn't mean it was bad filmmaking.

I'm a huge found footage fan, and this works particularly well with microbudget indie horror videos like these. Most often, this results in a lazy regurgitation of every other horror movie - a team of friends or a group of amateur ghost hunters or ____ (fill in the blank) visit a former insane asylum, or prison, or ___ (whatever), with crappy actors, inane dialogue, crappy music, and ultimately just another hunk of cinematic junk to throw on the pile (the video ""The Expedition"" is a c-movie I like to cite when drawing those comparisons, as it contains all the worst aspects of c-horror). I think this film will stay with me for awhile, in a disturbing way.

If you are a fan of linear films, with the usual beginning-middle-end, and a complete plot (in short, of ""normal"" horror films), and even if you are a huge found footage fan like me, you may not find this to your liking. But, clearly, many people do like this video and it's clearly made the rounds on the word-of-mouth, underground indie horror fan base since its 2012 release.

I can only say, if you do manage to catch this on DVD, you will certainly be in for a unique ride.",1426896000,4,3446,4.470588235294118
