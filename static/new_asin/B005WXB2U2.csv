8488163,4,B005WXB2U2,"The plot is interesting. The female lead isn't right for this part though. She doesn't look at all like a man nor did they try at all to make her look like a man. It is impossible to believe that anybody can mistake her for one so the entire story becomes unbelievable. They put her in very form fitted clothing in all of the scenes where she is supposed to be a man. You can clearly see that she has breasts (such as they are) and female hips. She sounds like a woman, moves like one, sings like one, acts like one. It is also really strange that she is gender swapping to take the part of her injured brother but she doesn't call him even though she loves him so much.

Otherwise, it is a cute series. The characters are nicely developed if you can suspend disbelief about how unrealistic the premise is.",1358380800,,806,4.233766233766234

8488165,4,B005WXB2U2,"This is a remake of the Korean drama, You're Beautiful.  The story is a light comedy/romance about a girl raised to be a nun, but who must take her twin brother's place in a rock band while he recovers from minor surgery.  It is a fun, enjoyable story.

The original series contained 16 episodes while the Japanese version is only 11 episodes.  This means that a lot was cut out of the story.  They did a decent job of casting the Japanese version using members of Kis-My-Ft2 and Hey! Say! Jump for the main male characters. The soundtrack is good, though again, the Korean version is better.  Tamamori Yuta of Kis-My-Ft2 just doesn't match Jang Keun Suk's (the star of the Korean version) incredible voice.

There are several star cameos in this series, including Koda Kumi, Katori Shingo from SMAP and Jang Keun Suk, the star of the Korean version.",1342483200,,850,4.626666666666667
8488166,5,B005WXB2U2,"So, how do I begin.
Well, I purchased this item on May 4 (Thurday), and I was excited waiting for it. I thought it'd be like those other things I bought where it would arrive a week or two later. This afternoon, May 7 (Monday), it arrived. I nearly jumped out of my skin with excitment:) If it wasn't for the weekend, I'm sure it would've have arrived a day earlier!! Other than that, the item did come in the condition they said it would be. NEW! I started watching it and the quality is very good. The subtitles also work well as well. I'm totally going to purchase from this seller again!!",1336348800,,592,4.247787610619469
8488167,5,B005WXB2U2,"Ikemen desu ne is the Japanese remake of South Korea's 2009 ""You're Beautiful"". It is very funny and the music is just like the original except for a brand new song that is featured in the show. This product has good visual and sound quality with easy to read subtitles. A must see for all fans of the original. Malaysian packaged version. Just episodes, and no extra features or behind the scenes footage.",1334966400,3,406,4.575342465753424
