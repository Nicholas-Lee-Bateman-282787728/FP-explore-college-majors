8395776,2,B003F0ZO6M,"After reading John Leake's book on Unterweger, I was eager to see Malkovich's treatment.  Mistake.  If one doesn't know anything about Unterweger, I think it would only be worse.  No context or background is really given, and there is a lot of  overwrought emoting and rather silly behaviour by the actor.  The orchestra and singers are all competent, but the musical choices weren't enlightening, nor did they add anything to the story or M's performance.  Very disappointed.  I recommend you skip this one.",1345939200,,508,5.048192771084337
8395777,5,B003F0ZO6M,"John Malkovich is eerily convincing in the role of the plausible sociopath Jack Unterweger. If Malkovich isn't in actuality a serial murderer, he's a more able actor than anyone suspected. Perhaps he should be under surveillance. What's more, after 102 minutes of his ghastly/ghostly monologue, I found myself half convinced that I also must be a serial murderer -- the famous Zodiac maybe -- though I couldn't recall a single victim. Unterweger/Malkovich's sociopathic logic of woman-hating is painfully easy to recognize from one's own ugliest thoughts. Jack/John justifies himself with his amazement at ""how much emotional material women are capable of producing"", and as we listen to him, evidence of the feminine emotions of oppression and betrayal accumulates on stage behind the 'celebrated' writer-murderer, with the insidious implication that women desire to be murdered. Perverted and unredeemable as Unterweger/Malkovich must be, his fascination is undeniable. He is the archetype: Don Giovanni, Don Juan, Jack the Ripper. One has to struggle to loath the man appropriately.

The evidence of that ""emotional material"" which inflames Unterweger's brutal lust is to be heard in the music -- selections from the darkest scenes of baroque and romantic operas, beginning with Gluck's ciaconna from Don Juan in Hell and including arias by Vivaldi, Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, and von Weber -- while the two sopranos who sing these fiery denunciations of masculine perfidy are simultaneously the victims of Jack/John's torture and murder. I confess that when I heard about this stage business, this juxtaposition of a baroque orchestra and singers with the monologue of a real-life serial murderer ostensibly touting his newly-published autobiography, I was profoundly skeptical.

But it works as theater. It works distressingly well.

I suppose I should mention that Malkovich delivers his monologue in English, with an astoundingly convincing Austrian accent throughout. The two sopranos, Laura Aiken and Aleksandra Zamojska, are vocally and dramatically excellent, and the Orchester Wiener Akademie, conducted by Martin Haselbck, is impeccable. In fact, their musical virtuosity is seemingly part of Unterweger's torment in Hell. [If I were indeed the Zodiac killer, I wouldn't get Vivaldi for my soundtrack in the Inferno. I'd get Glenn Gould playing Bach for eternity.]

This production is now on tour! It may be coming to a theater near you. I know that it's scheduled on Cal Performances in Berkeley this year. I can't imagine it without Malkovich, so you'd better see it before the star gets bored with his own sociopathy.",1311292800,4,2632,5.443627450980392
8395778,5,B003F0ZO6M,"The 2009 play ""The Infernal Comedy"" - confessions of a serial killer by Austrian dramatist Michael Sturminger is a ""comedy"" only in the most dark and ironic sense. Based on the true events surrounding the conviction, release and recapture of Jack Unterweger, this is a strangely compelling vision. John Malkovich created the role and is, essentially, talking to his audience as if they are witnessing a lecture and book signing from the ""Vienna Woods Killer"", back from the dead. The drama and vision are made more complete and surreal by having a Baroque orchestra accompany two sopranos as a form of commentary throughout the monologue. The arias are chosen carefully for their depiction of various operatic women in abused, subjugated, disadvantaged and mistreated roles. The two sopranos, Laura Aikan and Aleksandra Zamojska, perform wonderfully and also serve to act as if they are but two of Unterweger's many victims. In real life, Unterweger had written a book, gone on tour, exhibiting the same charm that no doubt gave him access to women, all while still executing an additional nine women, only to commit suicide while awaiting trial in prison. The irony and the palpable ""deadly charm"" that Jack Unterweger probably possessed are carried off brilliantly by Malkovich, who excels at portraying unusual characters in intense ways. The opera extracts and the performances by the sopranos - musically and dramatically - actually highten the mood and make one want to learn more about this strange case. The orchestra, playing period instruments conducted by Martin Haselbock plays wonderfully and this play/opera/commentary makes a fascinating addition to anyone's collection. The ""comedy"" is present, especially in some of Jack's almost ""throw away"" dialogue (like his disgust with the laptop computer provided him) but ultimately the realization that this man was real and notorious and scarily unique make the comedy less funny and more - infernal.",1276473600,6,1960,5.305466237942122
