Mr. Ham is known for his Biblical stance and shares points regarding that argument. However, the title of this DVD is ""Where Did God Come From?"", unfortunately. Mr. Ham didn't address this question at all in this presentation. Not at all. I'm certain that he has thoughts on this topic and it would have been nice for him to share them, especially since the title is what draws someone to watch the video in the first place.
Additionally, the beginning of the video has the late Dr. Jerry Falwell introducing Mr. Ham and going over the time slots for the conference that was being held at the time of recording. This is truly unnecessary and should be removed from the DVD.",1467590400,,777,4.597122302158273

8192515,5,B000PMGK6G,Ken Ham's powerful presentation teaches Christians the right way to defend their faith when they debate creation versus evolution. Learn how to answer such compelling questions as: How can we know there is a God?; Can we see any evidence of God's handiwork today?; Can the Bible be defended by real science?; Does creation really explain the scientific evidence we have in the present?...AN OUTSTANDING VIDEO PRESENTATION...Recommended for adults and teens.,1346716800,,457,5.450704225352113
