8529791,3,B008QPY4ZI,"Any and all chi kung meditation movements from the Doo Wai family lineage produce the strongest sensation of chi that you will experience from any chi kung method out there. I have obsessively tried many chi kung forms over the past 9 years and there is nothing that compares to Flying Phoenix Chi Kung for its unique feeling of chi. That is the good news. The bad news is that the movements are not broken down in order to learn them. All of Doo Wai's videos that I have seen are merely demonstration but not instruction so there are only a few movements on this dvd that I am capable of learning how to do just by watching. That is a shame because his system is very powerful. Doo Wai was always talking about how his family's chi kung lineage was so good for health, yet he had multiple strokes in recent years and died from that condition. So I put away all Doo Wai chi kung dvds and moved on to other chi kung forms.",1447804800,2,921,4.238636363636363
8529792,5,B008QPY4ZI,"This Meditation is amazing!  I've been practicing meditation and Chi Kung or Qi gong for nearly 15 years and this is one of the strongest I've ever felt!  From the moment I did the first series of movements I could feel the Chi everywhere!  It gets stronger and stronger every time I practice it.

It is my sincere hope that everyone drawn to this product to buy it and practice it...you will know why you did it after you're doing it:)

I've bought this DVD for friends also...makes a great gift!",1383523200,3,497,4.417582417582418
