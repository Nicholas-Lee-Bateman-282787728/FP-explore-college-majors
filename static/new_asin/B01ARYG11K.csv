8748114,1,B01ARYG11K,"This movie was horrible. It was 70 minutes of a woman walking around, riding the subway or ""disco"" sex (strobes, b&w, zoom in and out) while a random guy with a hoody and glue on witch fingers on his gloves pops up now and then. I have seen silent movies that have more dialogue than this movie. The music would have even been tolerable if it hadn't been accompanied by the worst camera effecta ever. Don't bother watching this, the nudity isn't good enough to warrant the rest of the film.",1471132800,2,490,4.395604395604396

8748117,1,B01ARYG11K,"Scarlett (Amber West, a blonde) moves to London where she does drugs and has poorly filmed sex, mostly in black and white, David Lynch, WTF style. She has visions and dreams of someone following her in a hoodie and needing a manicure. That is pretty much it until the end.

The film doesn't have much in the way of dialogue. I was waiting for Woody Allen to do an aside or outtake and explain what I was watching and why I should keep watching it....other than the nudity. It didn't happen. Scarlett films what she believes is the man tracking her. We don't know if she was a victim of rape and is haunted by it, or has a premonition of the future until it is explained by her late in the film.

Terrible art house style script. It has ""paranormal"" in the title, but is not a found footage tape. At times it is worse than a found footage tape. It does have a twist. Too bad we had to watch an hour of this production to get there.
