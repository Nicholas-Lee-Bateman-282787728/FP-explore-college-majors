7697616,4,B01D5MPOYG,"Spoiler alert!! This was an entertaining film about an excellent high school football team. The key members of the team should've had more character development. Nevertheless, the story was of a team that triumphed over adversity was inspiring. I just couldn't believe how stupid these players were to endanger their future with petty crimes. The sentences were extreme for nonviolent crimes. I couldn't believe that they were stripped of their championship after the convictions. This story is tragic. Several players who avoided making foolish choices did go on to have successful football careers. This film should be watched by all teens. It let's all viewers know that foolish decisions can destroy your future. Before the crimes occurred this was a great story with a happy ending. The team overcame many scandals and won the championship. The whole community applauded them for their excellence. Fox and Dutton were excellent as always. Highly recommended.",1470528000,7,963,5.342105263157895
7697617,3,B01D5MPOYG,"This is based on the true story of the David W. Carter high school in Texas during the 1988-1989 season. They had won the state championship but had players that misbehaved too much even for Florida State. The film includes actual footage of the games they played as well as messages from some of the players at the end of the film. While everyone in town was giving special favors for the team members, the judge did not.  Fair performances. Script needed some more creative drama.

Note the stylish razor cuts.

7697618,5,B01D5MPOYG,"I applaud this movie for telling the essence of a true story that is far more amazing than fiction.  I am white and as a Carter High school graduate of 1972, I witnessed the closing of J. Ervay (an all black school) in an attempt to integrate Carter, and the ensuing white flight.  This movie actually downplayed the racism that was at the center of the attempt to keep Carter from competing. Newspaper articles accused Carter of being a black football factory while at the same time suburbs were pouring millions into building big stadiums, enlarging coaching staffs and building big high schools for only juniors and seniors in order to ensure a big pool of seasoned athletes. The local newspaper described Carter as a poor inter city school of blacks and Mexicans.  There were virtually no Mexicans at Carter and the high school is over 10 miles from Downtown Dallas.  the journalist had obviously never visited Carter and was inventing stereotypes. Carter is in the southern part of the Oak Cliff section and Mexicans lived mostly in northern Oak Cliff.  The movie did a great job of visually showing the nightmare of the UIL's attacks on the Carter football program.  I believe that Plano East, a suburban school,  had a similar issue a few years later and very little happened to them. I have long heard impolite groans when I explained to folks in North Dallas where I was raised. Many individuals from Oak Cliff have excelled over the years (bluesmen T-Bone Walker and Stevie Ray Vaughn are notable examples). The idea that the folks in the suburbs can't buy superiority in everything is disturbing to many in the Dallas metro area. I also happen to have a degree in Theatre from UTD and I would like to add that the acting in the film is very good in my opinion.",1489968000,3,1771,4.657051282051282

7697627,4,B01D5MPOYG,"I am really glad this story came to life on the big screen. It demonstrates that opportunity can be taken away by stupid actions, and with opportunity comes responsibility to making society a better place.",1485129600,2,205,4.885714285714286
7697628,1,B01D5MPOYG,"Terrible movie. Really bad script, with little to no point. In fact, I think I've spent more time writing this review than the screenwriter spent on the movie.

7697631,1,B01D5MPOYG,Horrible movie with horrible acting whose message seems to be that you should always blame others for your own stupid mistakes. I couldn't believe how cheesy this movie is. It would have been a much better documentary.,1480982400,,218,4.918918918918919
7697632,1,B01D5MPOYG,Yea it very well might be the worst. It was unbearable to sit through. I felt bad for Vivica Fox to see how far she's fallen to do a such a obviously bad movie. I say avoid at all cost,1480291200,,184,3.625

7697634,1,B01D5MPOYG,Not what I expected at all... Although all of it was based on a true story... The movie itself wasn't well put together... At least in my opinion anyway. I think it should have been a documentary instead.,1479168000,,204,4.394736842105263

7697636,2,B01D5MPOYG,"I managed a Diamond Shamrock store and filling station on Zang Bluv. in Oak Cliff, Dallas, Texas in1988-1989. One of the boys from the Carter High
School foot ball team came in to rob me shortly after 6am. He was a nice young man. He said good morning mam. I said fine- may I help you. He said Well you see it's like this and he stuck a 9 mm Ozzy in my face. My friend was working at a 7/11 on Twelfth Street . She was robbed the following evening by one of the boys using a 9 mm Ozzy. They were not mean. It's the gun that bothered us. The movie is wrong. They showed them being loud and cussing and using a hand gun at made up robberies . Looks to me like they just made some stuff up to make that movie.
I was never mad at them. They were good kids who made a bad decision and they paid a Horrible price for it. I am now a 75 year old great grand mother of five.
I hope they paid those boys well. They spent 16 to 25 years in the pen for that where the mean one that robbed me cussing me and spitting in my face-he was a drug addict and he got 10 years probation. There was nothing fair in any of that.

7697672,1,B01D5MPOYG,"If you like terrible acting and and watching people make poor life decisions, you'll like this. It's like an after school special, without the moral motivation. The players are not redeemable and hard to sympathize with. Normally in a movie like this, the audience feels like the main characters did something wrong, but we root for them anyway. This is not the case. They don't even clearly differentiate the guys, so when you hear a name, you don't know who they're talking about.
Vivica A Fox came off like she was in a high school play, Charles S. Dutton was a predictable caricature.
They also had a random nerd that the players are friends with... WTF?! It was a terrible over-the-top performance and the kid wasn't even a convincing nerd. They didn't make sense of why he was in the movie at all,

I liked the idea of using real footage in the film, but everything else was a FAIL.",1471219200,,888,4.55

8754994,1,B01D5MPOYG,"Despite some solid delivery of the material given in a top billed cast (who are all actually supporting characters!) led by an intriguing real life story, Carter High ends up having too much dead space to fill. The camerawork and themes occasionally stand out but they're in sparse places of an otherwise dreary running time. It is currently streaming on Netflix but will not leave up an impression regardless of the format you're viewing it on. Rent, buy or watch a cable TV viewing of better rated football dramas if you are hungry for some inspiring sports stories. You will not get any reasonable sports action, there's many speeches, the real life news stories don't match up with the film's digitally shot format and the court trial lingers to where it's very clear the filmmakers had zero imagination at outlining the enticing story that needed to be summed up. The only stuff of interest are the performances by Charles S. Dutton, Vivica A. Fox and Kerry McCormick and the troubled behind the scenes trivia including where the extras department was a nightmare and the film kept struggling to find theatre venues to play at.",1491091200,,1132,4.84020618556701
