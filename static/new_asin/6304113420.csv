My wife and I watched this mini series together and since she has passed this is something I desire to have in my library.
My wife was was a seeker and spiritualist with an uncanny knack to see into your soul and it doesn't matter whether you believe it or not her faith was to have faith so she learned about everything and like Shirely Maclaine she was not afraid where it lead her.
This movie was an honest and thought provoking look at an area most consider career suicide but I am happy Shirely Maclaine gave us the story, since then I have read her books, followed her journey and kept the spirit alive by living the teachings graciously given to us by those who see with eyes not clouded by fear.

Stand alone ONAL is an excellent spiritual adventure, but it comes into full light if one understands the making of the film where the book presents the background information that is needed to get the full picture.",1385337600,6,354,4.634920634920635
783286,5,6304113420,"First, the delivery of the product was better than expected.  From order to delivery, it was 7 days (and I used the free shipping option).  Kudos!

Second, I saw this when it was first broadcast years ago and the story and images stuck with me all this time.  The story is well told, there are more details than the book, and the filming was good for a made-for-TV moview.  I sat down an watched the whole thing in an evening and was surprised at how well it flowed (TV movies tend to be a little chopped up).

Third, while some of the ideas presented in the film are a little generic, it must be remembered that this came out in the early days of mainstream new age.  Especially good were the arguments between Shirley and the various ""guides"" she comes across during her search -- they address many of the criticisms of new age spirituality and the arguments that ""non-believers"" tend to have.

Fourth, the DVD quality was good -- color and sound were surprisingly good for a film of this age and type (made-for-TV).  There are no extras and you need to turn off the captioning if you don't need it.

Finally, I am so glad that I finally found this DVD.  I had been searching for it for 10-12 years because I wanted to re-watch it.  It will be a fine addition to my collection and I plan to rewatch it every few years.  Thank you!!!",1377475200,19,1334,4.330645161290323

783353,2,6304113420,"I bought the Out on a Limb many years ago, and haven't watched them for a long time.  But I watched them last night and this morning.  The first tape was interesting.  The usual love affair that cannot be climaxed because the guy is married. OK.  No big deal.  Happens in lots of movies.  This guy, however is in politics and is running for a high office, so the relationship is fuzzy from the start.  Shirley MacLaine keeps wondering why they are involved? To solve this problems she begins looking into esoteric answers. Doesn't everyone wonder about a shaky relationship?  But this affair is impossible because they are both well known people and their love affair must be kept secret from the press.  Shirley has come to think it strange that she got herself into such a difficult love affair. Not unusual.  Love is often blind especially in a movie film.

The 2nd tape was different.  In fact, it was ridiculous.  Now she's into ESP and trance channelers, who probably did it for her free because of the publicity it would bring them when the film came out. Beyond that, idiots would pay tons of money to hear him talk about their lives.  His usual fee, I read was about $250.00. No mention of his fee in the film.  She takes a trip to Peru in the mountains where her esoteric buddy whom she met in the first film took her and tells her about lots of flying saucers that people who live in the mountains have seen.  And not only that, but his girl friend is from another planet who visits him!  Shirley's car get's stuck somewhere far up in the mountains, and is rescued by her friend whose car can drive at any speed on dangerous curvy mountain roads when his hand is not on the steering wheel.  Too much.  I didn't even feel like watching the 2nd tape this time.  I'd seen it years before, and even then doubted that any of it was true. Now I felt even more dubious, so I just took out the tape and put it away.",1336262400,,1918,4.349295774647888

Now I want a DVD!

Shirley MacLaine shines in this role based on her spiritual journey.  In her opening remarks in the beginning narration, she describes that the search came about as a result of a love affair.  When she meets him for the first time, she feels as though she has known him before....

But before any of these events, she describes the ever-present question that seemingly haunts her: what is missing?

Then, almost like destiny, a series of events begin to unfold, from meeting the spiritual guide David to taking a trip to the Andes, where strange and unforgettable events occur.

Afterwards, she will never be the same again.  Her investigations lead her to trans-channeling guides, among other things.  As she explores the possibilities, she discovers so much more than she had expected.

Her quote says it all:  ""To get to the fruit of the tree, you have to go out on a limb.""

This version I purchased claimed to be the version that was originally shown on
ABC-TV - but integral scenes are cut out! Certain portions don't make sense with the scenes chosen to cut for whatever reasons! A scene that I vaguely remember shown on the ABC- version was cut - when Shirley confronted a psychioc in Peru concerning Bela Abzug running for Mayor of New York against the former Mayor Koch. I know this scene was shown on the original showing because I remember watching the series with an elderly Aunt (now deceased), and I remembered asking her if Bela Abzug had ran for the Mayoral office against Koch and she responded,""Yes.""
Of course I ordered the original uncut version when it was available through a New Age magazine - and that scene as well as all the others were intact.

Quick to capitalize on the skyrocketing success of Shirley MacLaine's '83 bestselling book `Out on a Limb' Shirley and ABC Network released this 160 minute miniseries of the same name in '87. `Out on a Limb' was highly anticipated television event aired on two consecutive nights, January 18-19 (that was a Monday and Tuesday if I remember correctly).

I was one amongst a multitude of fans who couldn't wait for this show to air and made sure I had sent the allotted time set aside to view without interruption. Hard to believe as it may seem, that was before the advent of home recording devices so you were at the mercy of Network scheduling. You either watched at the appointed time or missed out (yes, it was a primitive time to be alive).

The miniseries lived up to my every expectation. After all it's rather difficult to be disappointed with an autobiographical story about a contemporary person with that person in the starring role. Also considering the fact that I had enjoyed the book and was fascinated with the subject matter, there wasn't going to be much objectivity in judging its merits of this cinematic production. This import VD is the extended 235 minute version containing 75 minutes of additional film never seen on television. In this particular case, ""more is better"".

My Rating: Worth a watch? Absolutely! Whether you're a believer, or just want to see what the `New Age"" is all about you'll come away with food for thought. -4 Stars-.

PS: I don't understand why this film has yet to be made available on a Region 1 DVD? There's a big market for this one, somebody should have seen the dollar signs all around this one by now.",1205884800,7,1762,4.652733118971061

783500,5,6304113420,Adam and Eve is at it again.  Great movie that summarizes all that we know to be real and doesn't pull any punches or spon the insanity of reality.,1139875200,2,147,4.068965517241379
783501,3,6304113420,"There are 2 versions of this film. This review is based on the 160 minute TV version as opposed to the 234 minute video that was released afterwaeds.

  First and foremost is the prologue disclaimer that some characters are composites of the actual events. Bella Abzug and Mort Viner were real people and obviously not in this category. Since the British politician provides the catalyst and title for her journey one can assume he is not a composite unless you choose to believe Ms. Maclaine has had numerous affairs with the English politic. The two Mystics are again real people and played themselves. That leaves David. If his character, superbly played by John Heard, is representative of many it somewhat distorts the viability of the journey. One man and his faith is quite different than that of many and gives the impression Ms. Maclaine jumped around till she found suitable finality to her quest.

  The plot beckons us with Synchroncity, Reincarnation and then delves into various forms of New Age philosophy and incidents involving Andes mineral baths, ET driven vehicles, and a superfluous amount of meditation. The finality of this baptizes Shirley as the chosen one to spread the word and tell the world of her new life discovery. But there is no real satisfactyion for the viewer unless you are a vibrant Shirley Maclaine fan. It leaves you a bit unsettled with another walk on the Malibu beach.

  One looks for a common denominator in the paranormal and here we have The Silver Thread which is demonstrated quite profoundly. Many OBE and Remote Viewing subjects include this phenomena with similar definition.

  Perhaps there is more truth and finality in the four hour version. Here the film delivers us to the limb but there are too many fruits to choose from.",1139875200,10,1782,4.883720930232558
783502,5,6304113420,"I've had OUT ON A LIMB on video tape since the original showing in 1987. Tonight for some reason I pulled it out to watch after an absence of at least 10 years (I have hundreds of video tapes so it was easy for this to recede into the darker corner of the closet).

I am most amazed at Shirley's incredible courage (others might call it arrogance or gall) to present material that is so antagonistic to the mainstream middle American mind set. After watching this excellent time capsule of New Age Thought from the mid 1980's, I felt a wee bit sad, since I realize this mini-series could never be shown  on network TV today! After decades of Republican rule and the subtle but merciless pressure of right wing Christian religion in the US, the beliefs that Shirley presented in this film are much MORE controversial today than they were back in the benignn 1980's.  How dare she have an affair with a married man? How dare she claim to be God? How dare she hobnob with channelers who are in the hands of Satan? I can hear all the babble on TV and right wing talk radio if that poor woman were to try this today!

Even if every concept presented in this film is false, it is a tremendously rewarding adventure.

However, I do have to state that after this film was made, Shirley admitted on a talk show that the book/film are NOT literally true! She created composite characters like David to represent her spiritual research. So it might come down to her NOT having any personal metaphysical adventures at all outside the confines of her book reading, but she created such adventures, e.g., having an invisible alien drive a truck in Peru that she and the make-believe David were in, to jazz up the topic a bit.  I think a lot of people lost faith in Shirley when she made the confession that her books are NOT literally true!

Nonetheless, Kevin Ryerson is a trance channeler and is still out there charging $275 for a 90 minute consultation. Why go to law school when you can charge prices like that for your services?

I may seem like a skeptic. Well, I am skeptical of some of the more cartoonish aspects of the so-called New Age. We have grown more jaded since 1987. However, there are underlying spiritual truths within the film/book that make it worthwhile, although this film/book certainly contains no revelations that cannot also be found in a bounty of spiritual oriented books on the market today.

So in one sense, you may enjoy this film/book as a nostalgic throwback to a time when the New Age was ""new"", not the butt of comedians and the horror of fundamentalists. To call someone ""new age"" now is considered practically an insult, like calling someone a ""liberal"". That shows how reactionary and scared our culture has become since those heady times.

Take time from worrying about terrorism and the fact that George Bush believes that his fundamentalist Old Testament God is telling the US to invade other countries. Pop OUT ON A LIMB into your VCR or read a copy of the book. It may make you wish you could time travel back to those exuberant times!",1095465600,88,3068,4.551724137931035

783504,5,6304113420,"With all my heart and soul, Shirley MacLaine, I love what you have done to help those of us who are searching for our spirituality! If you have questions, look out. You will have more and many answers will come your way while watching ""Out On A Limb"". Everyone that I have recommended this movie to loves it.
I lost my 3-tape set to a house fire. Would like to find same. I have to say, the one tape version just isn't enough. Shirley MacLaine was there during my early search for spirit through her books. Her movie was a big help. It has opened many eyes to the truth...even my husband's. I loaned my set to a friend who thought six hours was too much. The following day he told me that he couldn't stop watching. He didn't get much sleep that night. Was so excited about the movie and had more questions.
We love ""Out On A Limb"". Don't be afraid to climb out there on that limb...so enlightening! Shirley MacLaine at her best and most of all...being herself! Thankyou Shirley for all you have done to help this soul find her way home. Chi Megwetch!",1033948800,10,1051,4.313131313131313
783505,5,6304113420,"I have had several special encounters with this enlightening film,since first seeing it during its original mini-series broadcast on TV years ago! It seems to periodically come up in consciousness to me,when I am sharing with others,my Spiritual journey,as they too become aware of a greater potential for their own lives! It has been over the years available at most larger video rental stores,ie. Blockbuster,etc.,but now has apparently been removed and no longer has any distributor to even be able to order a copy for purchase anywhere. It is very sad that a film with such consciousness raising and healing qualities to it would just disappear. I am hoping someone may be able to help me to acquire an audio-visually decent copy,so that it may continue to bless and inspire people,as it has done for all who have seen it in the past! Just for myself,I know what it has done for me,everytime I've watched it with whatever ""new"" person,I've recommended it to. It is the only movie that I have ever written notes from as I watched it,just from the nuggets shared between the characters in the dialogue! I'm so glad that I am not alone in the enthusiastic pull to get this film re-released,re-distributed and available once again to the general public! I don't know what we'd all have to do,short of writing a petition of sorts to Ms. MacLaine herself as a vote of confidence in this timeless piece of work but I feel that it is far too important a film to simply be satisfied in being just one of the many who remembers this uplifting movie with fond warmth and affection.

783508,4,6304113420,"When this movie debuted as a mini-series, I copied each episode, commercials and all, as I knew little about how to work a VCR. It might not have been the best visual quality, the filming might have been rushed to production, but the message is most profound.
I  'made do'  with this old copy from my VCR for years.  Everyone who came to stay a few days with me wanted to view it, so I saw the film many times.  Over the years it lost much of its visual sharpness, so when it came out commercially I was eager to have a professional copy of this series.
Shirley MacLaine's book, OUT ON A LIMB, and those that followed are very meaningful in my life. The book she wrote after the filming of this series added much more enlightenment to my life. Perhaps, what I am trying unsuccessfully to say is:  Ms. MacLaine has given me a feeling of 'not being alone' with my own experiences.  She has openly shared with us the things she's experienced, so that we can see another dimension of ourselves, if we choose.
The material, the subject, etc., I rate 5 stars.
I only rated it 4 stars overall, because of the shortcuts the crew had to take, the amount of time they had for filming, and the segmentation they had to create for tv commercials.
