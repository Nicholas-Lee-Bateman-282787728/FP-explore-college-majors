8153077,1,B000JUBFEG,It is seriously awful. We only purchased as a training supplement for our adoption process and it was painful to get through the whole thing.,1481673600,,141,4.68
8153078,3,B000JUBFEG,"Probably fairly cutting edge when it came out (I am guessing that's why it won awards), but it could be better.  Only white women were interviewed, though I did like the diversity of economics and reasons for relinquishment.  A good ""starter"" film for those not knowledgeable about the journey of adoption, relinquishment, placement, and open adoptions.",1420675200,,353,5.285714285714286
8153079,5,B000JUBFEG,"As a grandmother of two adopted children by my daughter, this documentary was a perfect way to better understand the choices the birthmothers made.  The six different stories tell the inside feelings and thoughts of the birthmothers beautifully. I am so glad I watched this.",1394236800,,274,5.088888888888889
8153080,2,B000JUBFEG,I got nothing out of this film.  It didn't represent me at all.  I guess everyone's story is different so maybe it will affect others positively.  I personally was disappointed.,1367539200,,177,4.833333333333333
8153081,5,B000JUBFEG,"This thoughtful and profound movie should be a ""must see"" for all high school-aged students and anyone who has faced or is facing the difficult choices that come with with unwanted or unexpected pregnancy. It is a moving film that touches the heart and opens the mind to the gift of adoption to all involved.",1177804800,4,308,4.618181818181818
8153082,5,B000JUBFEG,"This is an incredibly powerful film, telling the story for those who cannot tell it themselves. Ms. Durnin has greatly empowered these faceless women and highlighted their pain, their incredible personal strength and their ultimate triumph in extraordinarily difficult situations. Very moving, very instructive. This should be required viewing for every mother facing the difficult circumstance of an unwanted pregnancy.  One of the most moving films I have ever seen...I recommend it to everyone I know thinking of adoption.",1168300800,7,525,5.6455696202531644
