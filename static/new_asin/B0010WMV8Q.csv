3052715,5,B0010WMV8Q,"Flicker Alley has been the producer of some interesting silent and early sound packages lately, and this is their latest entry. This is the press release describing the contents:

Flicker Alley's ""SAVED FROM THE FLAMES"" DVD set is the North American home video premiere of Lobster Films and Blackhawk Films materials previously exhibited as part of the semi-annual live presentation of Serge Bromberg's ""Retour le Flamme"" in Paris as well as many materials which have rarely been shown before. The DVD edition also includes an illustrated booklet with annotations by film preservationists and historians David Shepard and Serge Bromberg. The DVD content is as follows:

NEW BEGINNINGS: Seven early cinematic experiments of Lumire, Georges Mendel and others, including Cyrano De Bergerac (1900), generally believed to be the first ever film produced with both color and sound.

MAGICAL MOVIES: Five early fantasy and trick films--including a previously-unseen trick film by Georges Mlis, hand-colored films from Segundo de Chomon and Gaston Velle, and astonishing stop-motion animation from 1911.

SEEING THE WORLD: Among the ten films in this section are a transatlantic crossing in a Zeppelin dirigible, a 1925 stencil-colored trek through the Belgian Congo, World War I-era Parisian street kids in Montmartre, a 1916 visit to Los Angeles, a 1927 sound film of pilot Charles Lindbergh embarking on his New York-Paris flight, an early 1930s portrait of New York City's Coney Island, and a promotional film made for Josephine Baker's revue at the Folies-Bergre, Paris.

LAUGHING LIKE WE USED TO: Seven comedies, including four restored from turn of the century Italy and France, a recently-discovered nitrate negative of Charlie Chaplin's first appearance in his ""tramp"" attire, a frenetic Mack Sennett ""gag fest"" replete with tin lizzies, and The Pest (1922), starring a pre-Hardy Stan Laurel.

DRAWINGS AND MODELS: Six works of animation: Gaumont's Fantasmagorie (1908); three Fleischer Studios cartoons--Cartoon Factory (1924), Ain't She Sweet (1932), and Play Safe (1936); Ub Iwerks' Balloonland (1935), featuring a new color restoration made from the original negatives; and a filmed performance by puppetry pioneer Tony Sarg.

GRACE NOTES: Rare musical performances: Django Reinhardt with Stphane Grapelli and the Quintet of the Hot Club of France in Jazz Hot (1939), Duke Ellington and the Cotton Club Orchestra featured in Black and Tan (1929), Louis Armstrong in Copenhagen, 1934, and a 1929 performance from the Utica Jubilee Singers.

PERSUADE ME: Eleven films designed to influence, including a vintage promotional film of a French-dubbed Laurel & Hardy, theatrical advertisements featuring Michel Simon and Jacques Tati, a 1938 George Pal puppet animation, three WW-II era musical shorts, two political campaign films, and the National Film registry selection Master Hands, a paean to the 1936 Chevrolet automobile.

TELL ME A STORY: Narratives from 1912-1913: D.W. Griffith's ""For His Son"", Lois Weber's ""Suspense"", and Thomas Ince's ""The Heart of an Indian"", all mastered from beautiful 35mm film elements.

Don't expect this set to be as flawlessly put together as the National Film Archives' Treasures series. The films have been digitally cleaned up some, but not completely restored such as the NFA sets have been. It's still an interesting collection though.",1201564800,33,3377,5.501930501930502

8238802,1,B0010WMV8Q,"There are a lot of interesting items in this collection, but the production is nothing short of atrocious. When using the up-and-down arrows on the disc menus, there is at least a five-second delay before the menu responds. This is exasperating and annoying, but tolerable (just barely).

Even more annoying -- and entirely UNacceptable -- is the fact that the second disc (of three) would not play in any of my players. I got a replacement set (thanks to Amazon's usual excellent customer service), but the replacement set was similarly defective. Again, it was Disc 2 -- it would plays as far as menus, but one selection would freeze up. Several others had severe image disruption or wouldn't play at all (depending on player). This time I gave up on getting a replacement and just took a refund (thanks again, Amazon, for great service).

Perhaps it's because this was originally a French DVD set -- maybe they had inadequate protections in place in preparing the set for Region 1 marketing. Whatever, it's not worth the trouble. Don't bother ordering this, because you'll only waste your time and Amazon's postage when you return it. Too bad, because it would be a collection worth having if it had been properly produced.",1226793600,14,1226,4.861244019138756
8238803,5,B0010WMV8Q,"Watching this marvelous 3-disc set kept reminding me of the famous Forrest Gump quote: ""Life is like a box of chocolates:  you never know what you're going to get.""  With such a variety of rare and unusual short films, this set is just as pleasing and delightful as discovering what kind of delicious filling is in the next chocolate in the box.  Some films are sure to surprise and others might be an acquired taste, but the overall result is that this collection is a wonderful visual record of history and society as it changed and developed over a 50-year period.  Starting in 1896 when the moving picture was in its infancy, scenes of everyday life on the streets can transport the viewer back in time to a different era; an era in which people had different tastes and ideas of entertainment, such as `the torso man' and `The Dancing Pig' - just two of the short films that must be seen to believed.

Although still in its early stages, tricks and special effects were already widely used in the early 1900s as some other films in the group entitled ""Magical Movies"" show.  Then there are documentaries of various kinds, some political messages, cartoons and also three short films in the format of today's movies.  The early cinema enthusiast will be delighted with the choice, namely one by each of the most influential filmmakers and directors of the first two decades of the century:  D.W. Griffith, who perhaps contributed the most to the development of cinema, directed ""For His Son"" in 1912 about the use of cocaine in Coca Cola before it was made illegal in 1906, and the drama is a typical example of Griffith's style and `social commentary' meant to educate audiences and enlighten them about problems, ethics and morals.  Along similar lines, Lois Weber contributed significantly in making films dealing with issues concerning women, and because most of her films have been lost, it's a special treat to have ""Suspense"" in this set.  Long before Hitchcock, the art of scary suspense was perfected in this 10-minute short film of 1913, and I was very surprised and impressed by the impact it had on me.  The simple story of a woman alone in an isolated house as a tramp breaks in has been transformed into a masterpiece of horror and suspense in the hands of Lois Weber.  Lastly, another great name of early cinema, Thomas Ince, is also featured in a 30-minute film about American Indians; one of the many Western-themed films made in the Ince studios out in California before Hollywood came into existence.  Comedy has not been forgotten, of course, and the famous representatives of this genre are also featured:  Chaplin, Stan Laurel (before teaming up with Hardy) and a Mack Sennett/Keystone auto race classic, ""Lizzies of the Field"".  Important films for the serious cinema aficionado, but also good and interesting entertainment in general.

Apart from the `narrative film' we are used to, there are many more types of short films in this ""Saved from the Flames"" set which are just as interesting and important in both historical and entertainment value.  Personally, I was most impressed by the half-hour documentary on how Chevrolets were made in 1936, and have never seen factory footage look so beautiful and artistically photographed as in this film, ""Master Hands"".  Other nice surprises were the animation films ""Balloonland"" and ""Hell Bent for Election"" which has a strong political message for the year 1944.  Musical clips featuring Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong also impressed me more than I thought they would, as did some of the documentaries, such as about the dirigible or zeppelin flight across the Atlantic in 1924.  All films are well restored and have perfect musical accompaniment of various styles to suit the film, and an excellent booklet gives the viewer essential information without becoming too longwinded.  All in all, there is something for everyone here, and is as much fun as getting a big box of chocolates with many different, new, rare and unusual centers!",1224979200,3,4017,4.903988183161005

8238805,5,B0010WMV8Q,"Wonderful!

Fans of Prince Ranian wil cherish a 1900 film of human torso ""Kobelkoff,"" showing off his unique dance stylings.

""Danse Serpentine,"" ""The Talion Punishment,"" and ""Kiriki"" feature breathtakingly beautiful coloring by hand and stencil.

In the delightfully funny ""Excelsior,"" Melies materializes a giant lobster (seventy years before ""Multiple Maniacs""), among other magical feats.

""Over the Top"" documents a trip across a snowy mountain range by a group of madmen in a 1915 Buick, a feat to daunt Werner Herzog.

""The Dirigible Los Angeles"" documents the majestic airship's trip from Germany to the U. S.

""The Fireman of the Follies-Bergere"" resembles a fifties Nudie movie: some slob wanders around and imagines naked ladies in every nook and cranny of Paris.  At one point a priest is transformed into a nude, starting rumors of Bunuel's involvement!  Notable only for a forgotten dance routine by Josephine Baker, allowed to retain her top.

""In The Land of Pygmies and Giants,"" a documentary on the Belgian Congo, is prettily stencil-colored but depressingly condescending and not recommended to those who are sensitive to elephant slaughter.

""The Pest,"" a Stan Laurel comedy, features a cameo by the Hats Off/Music Box stairs (or are those the ""An Ache In Every Stake"" stairs?) and will teach you a politically incorrect term for the Brazil nut.

The Fleischers are represented by several films, from the Screen Song ""Ain't She Sweet?"" featuring a charming pre-alcoholic Lillian Roth and lots of bouncing black cats, to ""Play Safe,"" from their bland and cutesy period, with some great 3-D technicolor effects.

We have several musical shorts, documenting the Utica Jubilee Singers, Louis Armstrong (in 1934, performing ""I Cover The Waterfront,"" ""Dinah,"" and ""Tiger Rag""), and Django Reinhardt and Stephane Grapelli (performing ""J'attendra"" in 1939, in a short which unfortunately wastes half its brief running time explaining what jazz is before getting to the musical number!).  Less important musicians are showcased in three WWII soundies; William Frawley in ""The Yankee Doodler,"" the Smoothies and the Cappy Barra Harmonica Boys in ""Rosie the Riveter,"" and Ray Noble in ""Dear Arabella.""

A 1936 MGM promo reel is hosted by Stan Laurel, Oliver Hardy, and James Finlayson!  They are dubbed into French, but with their own wordless exclamations intact; it amounts to a brief Laurel/Hardy/Finlayson short you've probably never seen!

A few familiar titles - ""Kid's Auto Race,"" ""Black and Tan"" with Duke Ellington, Ub Iwerk's Cinecolor ""Balloonland"" - are here reproduced from original negatives, and presumably look as good as they ever will.

Chuck Jones, Yip Harburg, and UPA rally support for FDR in the stylish ""Hell Bent for Election"" (if you vote Republican you'll soon be selling apples on a street corner for Hoover), while MGM undermines Upton Sinclair's gubernatorial campaign in the fake newsreel, ""California Election News #2"" (Sinclair is supported by twitchy foreigners).

""Philips Broadcast of 1938"" is one of George Pal's most beautiful works.

D. W. Griffith's ""For My Son"" is a 1912 morality drama that prefigures the later drug scare exploitation cycle.  A doctor invents a cocaine laced soft drink, ""Dopokoke"" (!), ""For That Tired Feeling,"" only to see his son fall victim to soda pop addiction!

In ""Suspense,"" cinematically sophisticated for 1913, writer/director/star Lois Weber is menaced by a sandwich-purloining, knife-wielding tramp; Lon Chaney is rumored to be an extra, but I must have blinked.

And more!  Overall, ""Save from the Flames"" at least as resourceful and engaging a collection as the American Film Archives compilations.  There are no commentaries; the accompanying booklet tells how the films were rediscovered, but otherwise adds little to the discs.",1208908800,27,3813,5.359060402684563
