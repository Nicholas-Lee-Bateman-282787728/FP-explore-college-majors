8693971,5,B00R3TFMTU,"This album proves that Ozark Henry (Piet Goddaer) is a very talented singer. His ability is brought to the front with the symphonic backing on this album. Ozark is very real  nothing bogus with this singer.  His songs pull at the strings of the social roles that all humans have. His songs lower our guard and relax the mind.  I enjoy listen to this album as a form of transcendence after a difficult day at work.
Some of the songs are reworked from Henrys catalogue which has a 30 year span. My personal ratings of certain songs on this album are as follows:
Sweet Instigator - -> A+ (a solid hit)
At Sea - - > A+ (masterpiece)
Indian Summer - - > A (very smooth)
Free Haven - -> A (calming with a strong message)
Out of This World - - > B+ (sad song)
Godspeed - - > B+ (great beat)
I hope he brings his tour to the United States; it would be a real treat to see him perform with a full orchestra backing.
Bottom line - if you are a fan of Ozark Henry, maybe you have his Stay Gold album, you will not be disappointed with this tour de force.",1446336000,,1043,4.053398058252427

and  tone of his voice. very much atmosphere music which  wouldn't be out of place on a tim burton film score
takes me back to the early to mid 80's vibe and it works nicely.",1445126400,,267,4.019230769230769

-------------------------------

I've never even heard of Ozark Henry, but I'm always game for a new artist. In this case, I found myself kind of intrigued by Ozark Henry and think there is clear merit to giving more of his albums a shot.

Paramount is a little different. He worked with the National Orchestra of Belgium on this album. There are times it feels a little bit like an alternative album, and other songs made me think of Broadway. That's not a bad thing by any means. Now take that orchestra and pair the music with Bono and Leonard Cohen's lovechild and you have Ozark Henry's vocals. It's fresh and unique.

That said, there were two songs that niggled at me. Radio was a little jarring from the relaxed state the music had put me in. I'm not sure what all the numbers were supposed to be, but they distracted me from the song. That ended up being my least favorite song on the album.

My husband, the purist that he is, wasn't impressed with the cover of David Bowie's We Can Be Heroes, but I thought it worked well. I was more upset with Vespertine, which sounds very similar at times to U2's One. My favorite track, however, and it's a song I played over and over is Godspeed. I can actually see that track getting airplay on the alternative stations, and it would be deserving.

Bottom line is to give Ozark Henry a shot, especially if you do like Leonard Cohen's raw, earthy vocals. I think you'll be pleased by this album.",1444262400,,1519,4.465703971119134
