7795105,5,0982639589,"I am someone who lives with unwanted same sex attractions. I believe what the Bible says that homosexuality is wrong. I first heard Sy Rogers speak at a conference put on by an ex-gay live in program that I was part over 10 years ago. What struck me was his humor and his ability to shatter my American Christianity with the truth of Gods word. I have since then acquired all of Sys materials. He has been the number one influence in my life on my journey out of homosexuality.
I have watched and listened to the Lessons Learned series many times. They truly have changed my life. They have given me practical steps to implement into my life and my daily recovery. Sy uses science, the Bible, Psychology and stories from his own life to teach us how we work with God as he redeems our sexuality.
In Lessons Learned Vol. 1 Sy tackles such topics as Realistic Expectations, Forgiveness, Renewing The Mind, The Power of Relationships, What Works & Relapse Prevention.
Even though Sy takes examples from his own homosexual struggle, these principles can be applied to anyone dealing with any sexual struggle. Sy has been teaching these lessons for over 20 years. This DVD series is broken down into 30 minute sessions that would be perfect for any group. The DVD also contains MP3 files that can be downloaded for your listening pleasure and further study.
I would highly recommend this product to anyone with a sexual struggle. It is also useful to any church, family member or friend wanting to help them.",1432771200,,1503,4.654135338345864
7795106,5,0982639589,"Sy Rogers is amazing!! Although Sy is an amazing communicator, an engaging speaker, with a strong sense of who God is, alongside a great sense of humor, with godly wisdom, as well as experiential insight concerning the subject of homosexuality...that's not what makes Sy the amazing man he is...it's his surrendered life to Jesus Christ that makes him this incredible man!! Sigh teaches with strength and humility at the same time. You will NOT go wrong in using ALL of Sy's material. Not only will it help you grow in your understanding of our sexual brokenness, but it will help you come to understand God in a much clearer way! My church has many guest speakers. But the guest speaker people most still talk about is when Sy Rogers came and spoke at our church. I'm so thankful that we had him speak 2 separate times! We are all still gleaning from that!! You may not be able to have Sy come and speak, but it's like having him there with you when you listen to his teachings.",1414713600,3,979,4.50561797752809
