183376,3,1562190075,"Four (not three as publicity suggests) actors play almost all the characters in a tiny England town in this first of two volumes collecting the first 6 episodes of the BBC comedy.
Be warned that the humor almost always involves cruelty, to humans as well as to dogs and turtles.  Even the funniest  sequences have a sharp, hurtful edge. The acting is extremely good.  In each episode we come back to various sets of two, three or four characters and see how their (hopeless) situations are evolving.  A young hiker finds himself rooming with the most deranged and tight-haired married couple in all TV history. A community course in job hunting is populated by losers and retards, and taught by a fat psychotic who's never held a real job herself.  An isolated store is run by two inbred maniacs who torture and kill any outsider uncautious enough to enter. A local vet kills all his patients through mindlessness. Three executives at the local factory have a beer or two at the pub of an evening, their enjoyment hampered only slightly by the fact that one of them is a sweating, red-faced sociopath who packs an automatic inside his suitcoat. A one-armed nutcase runs the local novelty shop, and nobody gets out without putting their hand in the... well, maybe you get the picture.  The town's only cabdriver can't stop talking about the details of his sex-change operations.  And so on. There are some genuinely funny things here, but most of the laughs are of the ""gross out"" variety, and not the fruit of any actual comedy writing or performance.  In fact, most of the performances work on a purely dramatic level, rather than a comedic one. I sort of hope this is not the new direction for BBC comedy. There's a huge amount of talent here, but for laughs untinged with wincing, embarrassment and shock, we need to look elsewhere.",991526400,3,1835,4.7125
183377,5,1562190075,"League of gentlemen is 5th generation Monty Python. Classic British humour not all will find palatable!!  When I watched the first episode, I got the same buzz that The Young Ones/Python/Black Adder/Comic Strip/Absolutley Fabulous/Falty Towers/Vic Reeves... ETC. gave me.  I wasn't sure whether it's humour would appeal to Americans. It appears the people who wrote it don't care about this sort of minor distraction. But after sending copies to my friends in the States. I've found out it does.  It's dark, strange and challenging.  It isn't the kind of comedy that is cleverer than it is funny. Trust me, It's funny.....that's the bottom line.  Tread carefully....It'll blow your mind",987552000,,686,5.256880733944954
183378,5,1562190075,"This series is a ""must see"" if you're headed to western China! It's also a ""must-see"" even if you're only an armchair traveler to the Middle Kingdom. This is a well-done series which makes you feel you are there, as you travel the same route as the silk caravans of centuries ago. Excellent footage of rural villages, where life goes on much as it has for many centuries. From Chang'an (now Xi'an) to Kashgar, you travel from desert to oasis to mountains via camel, train and auto.",986601600,20,481,4.540229885057471

183380,4,1562190075,"This is the most bizarre, complex and cohesive work to come available in recent years.  No topic (xenophobia, sexual obsession, incest, cruelty [to animals and to humans]) is too distasteful.  Both the performances (by the three Gentlemen, who portray amongst themselves most of the characters) and the writing (with its undercurrents of isolation, frustration and rage) are what make this offering unpalatable to some and fascinating to others.  My friends are equally divided in their responses to the series.  I look forward to volumes three and four.",975283200,,554,5.333333333333333
183381,5,1562190075,This is by far one of the funniest shows I have ever seen in my entire life.  The characters are hilarious.  I'm sure that everyone who loves comedy shows will surely love this one.,970272000,2,181,4.294117647058823
183382,4,1562190075,"Andy Kaufman was a brilliant man, but one thing about true brilliance is that it is not satisfied easily.  Andy Kaufman never appreciated his role on TAXI, nor what it could possibly be.  These gems that were compiled are  a little taste of what could've been had this man lived longer and/or  appreciated his place a little more.  He was picked, in the beginning, as  the vehicle for this show...a role he was supposed to have shared with Judd  Hirsch...Andy didn't want it.  Instead, Andy wanted to play.  He wanted  to wrestle and do his little variety show.  Now, had that variety show run  its course, this entire story may have been different.  Of course, there  were only two shows, and the rest of Andy's career can be looked at as  near-failure.  Christopher Lloyd, however, seized upon the opportunity  granted him.  He took a small bit roll, episode 2, playing a  stoned/drunk/out of it priest, and he launched a career based on it.  Now  Lloyd may never be considered a ""genius"" in his field, but he  definitely provided my friends, my family and I with a ton of laughs.  His  career, from the result of the subsequent movie roles and the overall work  ethic, has to be considered a blazing success.  But all in all the man  who should've been considered a genius is well-captured in this three shows  and his variety shows...do not rent the full-length movies.",964656000,9,1373,4.65546218487395

7796331,4,1562190075,This video was very good for my son.  I did learn a few basic words from it but my 8 year old son got most out of it.  I felt that this video would be very good for children and even schools that teach Spanish to children under 13 years.  For adults I'd stick to the Pimsleur Spanish course which is the best on the market but without the visuals which is important for children.,1029369600,8,379,4.026666666666666
7796332,3,1562190075,"This series is really really funny. It has that going for it. The reason I didn't love it though was the fact that the story was too....I dunno...long I guess. Maybe if there weren't so many episodes of Kasuga bleating out ""Ayakawa, Ayukawa"" and then turning to ...what's her name?... the brown haired girl, and going ""sure I love u too"". I know it's supposed to be a love triangle but it was to annoyingly repititious for my tastes.

 The episodes are interesting though. Kasuga and his family try to go on living a normal life even though they are a psychics with ""the power"". His two perverted little friends are pretty funny too (though equally annoying at the same time) and Ayukawa has a very likable personality. Her brown haired friend is also pretty hilarious. She makes the most goofiest anime faces I've ever seen and she spouts out ""darling"" or should I say
""daaaling"" every five seconds like it's nothing.
  The art is mediocre considering the fact that this series is pretty old. It is decent though. There is also a cat that I think is somewhat overused. All it is, is an ugly, huge,red eyed cat that get's thrown around the house and city by Kasuga's really annoying sister in like every episode. She's the one with the brown hair and doesn't wear glasses. I dunno I really just did not find that funny.
  All in all I'd say this series is neither good or bad. It's interesting but not one of my favorites. But, If you like romantic humor and the whole never ending love triangle thing though then this is the show for you.",1018137600,,1539,4.49820788530466
7796333,5,1562190075,"I caught this show on comedy central back two years ago, and I finally got a credit card to buy this! (first thing I actually used it on.) The TV show itself had me laughing for hours- days- no I'm still laughing. The only complaint I had was I did not realize this tape only had three episodes on it. I was left in my dark room trying to remember what happened. If you're going to buy this, make sure you pick up the whole series. It's worth every penny.  The three ""gentlemen"" who act out these parts are perfect. Sometimes you wonder who plays who or if it is even one of the three. It'd take us Americans a team of 30 to come up with half of the things the four writers think up in one sitting. Hat's off to them all. And if you don't find it funny, then go back to watching friends.",996019200,3,787,4.012738853503185
7796334,5,1562190075,"So funny I fell off the couch laughing! The first time I ever saw this series was during a trip to the UK ... and the moment I got home I rushed onto amazon.com to see if 'The League of Gentleman' was available to the Canadian public. So absolutely hysterical I can't praise it enough!
Alot of Canadians familliar with 'The League of Gentleman' have compared it to 'The Kids in The Hall', which, by comparison, is really quite dull. ""The Kids in The Hall' have never made me laugh so hard tears literally streamed down my cheeks. This tape is great because you get 3 episodes ... including the very first episode ... finally the mystery of how poor Ben wound up in Royerston Vasey is revealed! As well, Tubbs and Edward still remain at the local shop ... homicidal and twisted from the very start! Pauline at the job center is absolutley my favorite (next to Tubbs and Edward) and well ... it's better seen from the comfort of your living room to appreciate to it's fullest!
In the second episode we take a deeper look into the psyche of Tubbs and Edward (scary stuff!), and we meet Hillary Briss ... who I'm still not too sure about as far as his 'special stuff' is concerned!
In the last episode, a few loose ends are tied up (to say the least!) and somewhere, if I'm not mistaken, I spot Tubbs eating what appears to be a hair sandwich. As always, it's definately something no reviewer could possible do justice for ... it simply HAS to be watched ... over and over again! Even after seeing it again and again you'll still laugh till your sides hurt!
I would like to point out, however, that some people may not find this kind of humor to their liking. It's not exactly comedy by the usual North American standards ... and it's what has been described as 'dark humor'. If silly jokes about self-pleasuring techniques and mentally unstable naked people with homicidal tendancies don't put you off ... it's well worth the money!",995846400,,1929,4.482954545454546
