8533893,5,B0091916WW,"Conflict is not an easy topic to digest. In a world that seems to grow more violent with each passing day, the community of self defense instructors is full of ""experts,"" all with their own ideas on how to protect oneself. One pervasive line of thinking suggests that we should ""incapacitate"" our attacker, teaching techniques designed to do everything from gouging eyes to breaking wrists and knees, etc. While this may seem an obvious and logical choice to some, ask yourself if that feels right to you; is permanently injuring someone always the right decision? Does a drunk person in a bar really deserve to lose an eye because he pushed you? Should every conflict consist of end-game violence? This mentality is all too common and we are in desperate need of a counterbalance.

Fortunately, that much-needed counter comes in the form of Jack Hoban's ""Ethical Protector"" DVD series. Mr. Hoban has clarified a very important concept for us; the idea that conflict resolution is not one-sided (the development of physical skills for protection). There is also an ethical component, which is just as important - if not more so - than simply acquiring a set of techniques you can use against an attacker.

In Volume 1 of his DVD series, Mr. Hoban demonstrates five scenarios; self defense situations for lack of a better term. In each scenario, Mr. Hoban simultaneously teaches movement ideas that enable you to gain a tactical advantage to protect yourself, and at the same time talks us through the mindset of an ethical protector to help keep us mindful of the ultimate purpose of protecting ourselves. (Namely, to protect ourselves rather than fight the opponent.) This is not a trivial inclusion, nor should it be taken lightly; the combination of physical and ethical skills are groundbreaking and a welcome change from what is commonly being taught to people today. The pairing of physical and ethical skills seems to me as paramount.

Of special note in this DVD is the addition of ""tie-in"" segments - stories with ethical/values-based messages that help to clarify the ethical protector concept. These are real-case stories that help to illustate what the ethical protector is all about. I found these tie-ins to be very helpful in putting these ideas into a real-world perspective.

I cannot recommend this DVD highly enough. Thanks to Mr. Hoban for providing us with a clear path to keeping everyone safe.",1379376000,,2416,4.9727722772277225
8533894,5,B0091916WW,"This video series, as with anything else, will strike different people in different ways. If one carefully reads Jack Hoban's background and what he puts forth here, he is presenting something that is (unfortunately) rare and unusual. He presents a perspective to help clarify and deal with humanity's age old problem of conflict - physical, emotional and mental. One of the most important and basic sciences in health care is Anatomy & Physiology - better known as Structure & Function. Jack Hoban works to demonstrate some structures that fulfill the functions of certain humans who are wired for the challenge to help humanity for wherever they walk. If you're looking for a better kick ass video, this isn't what you're looking for. If you're looking for some clarification regarding the moral and ethical considerations concerning the protection and defense of self and others, as well as help in clarifying structural tactics that physically manifest those functions, then this video is for you. Designed to be practical - both physical and cerebral, this series calls upon those who are willing to answer that call. To use a biology reference, if you are wired to be a ""white blood cell,"" you'll get this series. If you're a ""red blood cell,"" you may not be ready for or get this right away. ""Cancer cells"" may rightly flat out reject it's worth and validity. May everyone around you feel and be safer because you are there. Joe Lau, RN, AE-C",1378684800,,1449,4.894308943089431
8533895,1,B0091916WW,"I generally like to watch these for some tips and tricks to practice, however, with the way that this is portrayed and drags out, I didn't even finish it, or bother to watch volume II which I had already paid for. I'm glad I only rented them because it is definitely not worth the cost to buy it.",1369612800,,296,4.120689655172414
