The washed up attempt at marketing of throwing the word ""Teen"" around is understandable to under rate or maybe think of ignoring the series. believe me, this series is gold. Though if you recommend it to someone. Call it ""Oregairu"", On my experience it gets not respect when you use the word ""Teen"".",1473984000,2,437,4.7631578947368425
7316537,5,B010SZ0S9E,"By browsing at SNAFU-II chances are you're already familiar at some point with the first season, which is good because this season is not very forgiving with new comers. Most of its story lines were over dramatic, opposed to our uncaring human attitudes. Yet, without this drama like 90-99% of SNAFU-II (and most other media production) could not be created.

So, everything follows season 1, and we get what we had to expect first from the main character, Hachiman Hikigaya (Hiki) who faces the consequences from his last verbal fight with Minami, a girl from the cliques that always discriminated him. The show made some think that Hiki did it out of his typical trait of self-sacrifice to help others, a Japanese stereotype. Another interpretation is that what he did was getting the grudge out of his chest while lying to himself, a typical real human action. Anyways, his snap made him look like a horrible person for most people around. Many people may feel familiar with the situation. Solutions? SNAFU-II is about Hiki's solutions!

The animation art improved while Hiki mellowed on his antisocial behaviors, but don't expect too much though! The others didn't mellow very much their own either. Yukino Yukinoshita -2nd lead character- will get quite testing at times. Some people superficially complained from the 1st season that at the end he (and nobody else for that matter) never changed, which is real life! Nobody changes personality quickly and most of us never change much for real, just what happened here; thats what the SNAFU initials stand for (explicit). And SNAFU for all its limitations- is still about reality.

Reality can only be figured out by meditation, deep thought or philosophy, which carries the risk of losing itself, which is what Hiki may fall for at the end, without losing himself. I even doubted the shows translation accuracy (from another source), but Hiki was already on this path.  It must be stated that the plots got more complex and exciting in this season. Remember delirious-chubby Yoshiteru Zaimokuza? Hes back and becomes Hikis right arm on a plot to take on the student council!

So, Hiki is finally changing and improving his relations with his school peers, which implies and awesome display of forgiveness, especially to Yumiko, maybe the nastiest person in season 1 and still some here. Perhaps Hiki over-did his healing by turning himself in a sort of cupid, spy or some other servant position, which also happen quite often in real life, moving between extremes.

SNAFU-II gave excessive attention to Hayato, the popular guy and presented communication problems too hard to believe, but who knows. Human communication is in fact a hard skill, the very gist of these series. It was great when the show displayed the typical debacle of todays middle-class meetings wasted in hollow-wordy speech, sometimes plain pretentiousness, either at work, school, church, etc.

So our time-wasteful ways have spread even to Japan. BUT the final meeting here will show you a real lesson of leadership. Most bloggers praised both Hiki and Yukino for their confrontational ways that wouldve ruined any agreement and totally missed who was the real deal-maker: Yui Yuigahama, cheerful but clueless and incapable of speaking up. Yui did take Hiki and Yukinos stream but used it for gaining supporters to their cause to the point of making good use of useless jerks such as Kaori Orimoto. Yui was the real hero in the plot to organize the Christmas event.

The one who didn't look much like a hero was Haruno, Yukinos older sister. Haruno, charismatic, rich, beautiful and revered, both in the show and by the audience, even though she caused serious trouble in the previous season by encouraging people to goof-off during the cultural festival. Then the workload piled on a few ones, like Hiki, who was not even supposed to complain. A situation not only Japanese but perfectly American as well. Well, Haruno finally start showing her true colors, ruins the mood in one event, goes on full preying on Yukino and getting their mom involved, which made SNAFU-II become one of the few anime shows displaying a scene of parental sexual repression. Yukino will finally start showing a feeling for Hiki, but the ever-present sexual-repression of most anime heroes should only distress Yukino, never her mom.

SNAFU-II probably gave too much space to a new cute, lively and cunning girl, Iroha Isshiki, the one on the cover between the main trio. But it was a great example of the typical female assumption that we men- are always after women, especially pretty ones. Yet, Iroha did make the show more entertaining.

If you're rightly tired that what the best regular media-entertainment approach to reality is trash like duck dynasty and other reality shows do something and support-buy products like SNAFU-II.",1473984000,5,4844,5.021170610211706
