I picked some very simple but yet very good tips especially in fast jazz.
Nice video.",1373155200,,122,4.3478260869565215

Get this DVD, too.",1353024000,,129,4.6521739130434785
8044024,5,B0006ZIEHU,"I don't know.  I love his playing on this video and everywhere else.  Wish it was 200 minutes, but 100 is great.

Shares some very very important stuff.  Not stuff no one else in the universe could use, but how to think.  How to feel.  How to approach what you already know.  Not a star showing you rudiments.",1296691200,,309,4.224137931034483
8044025,5,B0006ZIEHU,"One of the earliest instructional/interview video productions, this remains one of the most helpful and inspiring.
if you are willing to exert a little effort to organize the material yourself, and consider it carefully,  you will get an unimaginably rich insight into the imaginative and technical world of one of the most creative and successful jazz drummers of the last forty years.

Jack illustrates his stick technique particularly well. Most drummers used to play in a similar way, with a very relaxed coordination from the shoulder to the finger tips.  Jack says, ""the sticks should feel very light in your hands"" and throughout the presentation, it is easy to see how comfortably and gently he moves with the sticks.
The hallmark of Jack's playing is his intuitive rhythmic sense.  It is almost impossible to write down most of Jack's memorable performances: he seldom settles into a repetitive pattern, and his subtle use of the parts of his kit is not based on repeating well-practiced ""licks"" (although you will notice, for instance, how much he likes double stroke rolls and paradiddle sequences).  As a drummer, Jack is a great listener, both to the sounds and structures he is making and to the other players in an ensemble.  The slight disappointment in this production, is that Jack's demonstrations are not at his inspired musical best, but this is an unfair cavil.  As one of the most recorded jazz drummers in history, there are lots and lots of examples of his superb playing.  In this production he is taking the time to explain how he approaches the instrument and how he approaches the musical phrase.
If you are interest in jazz drumming, or just interested in musical cfeativity, I think you will enjoy this DVD very much! If only Tony and Elvin had made the same kind of presentation available to other musicians! But Jack has, and we should be grateful.",1291852800,3,1881,4.8930817610062896
