7850443,1,6303568408,"My son, 3 yrs old, loves all the ""There goes ... "" videos (aka Real Wheels on DVD).  I thought he'd enjoy this as we get closer to the holidays.  This video is awful.  To give you an idea how bad, there's even a scene where Dave ""has to go"" and you see him behind a tree.  How low!!!  These videos are usually informative and fun.  How disappointing.",1290988800,,350,4.073529411764706
7850444,5,6303568408,"My 3yr.old son loves this Santa tape. He was going though a stage where he was afraid of Santa, but this tape has made that fear disappear even though Santa doesn't actually appear on this episode. He really enjoys the various methods they use to get to the North Pole. He loves Dave & Becky & brings his big collection of ""There goes..."" tapes to the hospital with him & they all keep him happy & occupied. We highly recommend all of the tapes.

7850445,5,6303568408,"This one didn't seem as good when we watched it the first time.  My son did want to watch it again a day later though and after that it has quickly grown on all of us.  Kids age 2 up will watch this over and over.  My son is 3 and has been watching the whole line of ""There goes a"" videos over for a year with no signs things will change soon.  What did he ask Santa for?  A new ""There goes a"" video!  We now own 6 and have rented all the others multiple times.  Forget all the PC people who say Dave and Becky sometimes aren't PC enough - it's all obviously in fun and won't even be noticed by your kids much less affect them in any way.",1010361600,6,638,3.787878787878788
