3695634,5,B001MEJYBY,"I received this volume within three days of purchasing it.

I personally think this volume of Chowder is better than the first. I found the compilations quite awkward for both of the volumes since they do not go in order of release date. Anyways, one of my favorite episodes (Burple Nurples & Shnitzel Makes a Deposit) came with this volume.

If you are new to watching the Chowder series, I would recommend buying this volume rather than the first one. There are other great episodes besides the one I favored within this volume.",1239148800,,530,4.688172043010753
3695635,5,B001MEJYBY,excellent and very funny i recommend this to anyone who injoys shows like spongebob or flapjack,1238284800,,95,5.0

3695637,5,B001MEJYBY,"This is a second volume of the hit Cartoon Network show ""Chowder"". These are the next five episodes from the show's first season.

Highlights including the Wrong Address/Wrong Customer combo (the two seemingly different shorts that are connected together into one story, one from Chowder and Mung's side and other from Shnitzel and Truffles')

Gazpacho Stands Up is another funny episode, where Chowder helps Gazpacho by writing down all the jokes for his stand-up comedy appearance. Unfortunately Chowder's handwriting is too terrible for one to read.

Then there's ""Shnitzel Makes a Deposit"" (one of the first eps to air) where Shnitzel is forced to take Chowder to the bank.

All the episodes are funny. Hope more DVDs will come; the series gets funnier as each episode pass.

Recommended to cartoon fans.",1236729600,7,808,5.137404580152672

3695711,5,B001MEJYBY,My family absolutely LOVED Chowder and I love that it didn't have much potty/sarcastic/disrespectful humor that I feel is inappropriate for my little dudes. We really like Adventure Time and Regular Show but sometimes it can be a little much for younger kids. Chowder was the perfect in-between show for the out of Nick Jr. but not into tween shows category that my kids fall into. I wish CN would release the rest of the series.,1370217600,,429,4.657894736842105

3695750,1,B001MEJYBY,"Though my daughter (and admittedly myself) thoroughly enjoy Chowder, this particular copy came in the mail scratched to the point that I cannot play the last two episodes on any of the multiple DVD players I've tried. If I had paid a penny plus s&h this might not be a big deal, but I paid $5 before tax and other charges, ofcourse putting close to $10 which is about what it would cost used without having to wait for it to come in the mail. The condition was listed as merely 'acceptable' rather than 'fair' or 'like new' etc. but I believe even that is quite a stretch for a show that only plays 4/5ths of the way through. In the future I will go out of may way to avoid ordering anything from ""Centcolorado"".

3695757,4,B001MEJYBY,"This is the next volume of Cartoon Network's hit series ""Chowder"" as seen on Thursday nights as part of the ""Har Har Tharsdays"" lineup with other shows like ""The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack"" and ""Total Drama Island"".

This DVD has 10 more episodes where the little fella with a huge appetite cooks up (literally) some more trouble as he makes his first dish he unknowingly poisons, travels with Mung Daal to bizarre part of town, takes a wild journey inside his own mouth, and tries to get a little exercise by joining a sports team.  But some of these episodes don't just focus on Chowder, these episodes focus on other characters like Truffles trying to befriend large fruit creatures, Shnitzel reluctantly taking Chowder to the bank, and even Gazpacho and his first comedy routine.

Although some of these episodes are not my personal favorites, there's a special feature that pretty much makes up for it.  It's called ""Chowder's Artwork"" and it's a slide show of character models and backgrounds used in all the episodes.  It's quite interesting.

I hope there's a third volume in the works, but for now there are some more brand-new episodes on Thursday nights on TV and even new stories in ""Cartoon Network Block Party"" comic books !",1245283200,,1247,4.8584905660377355
