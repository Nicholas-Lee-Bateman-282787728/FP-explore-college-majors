1108088,5,6305882010,"As you will note from reading the reviews, some people found this movie a bore! And that's Okay!  I saw TT in Dallas at a preview attended by the  local Gilbert and Sullivan Society, as well as others of us who managed to  get a ticket.  I loved it from the first moment and laughed my fool head  off - until I realized hardly anyone else was laughing.  Adult people  actually left and one young lady told me she would have liked it more if  there ""had not been so much music in it.""
The music of Gilbert  and Sullivan has been little heard in the last thirty years or so.  And  frankly, most people either really love it or really hate it.  My father  raised my sister and I on Gilbert and Sullivan - it played all day every  Sunday on our Victrola - and it is something I truly love and appreciate.  With this said, if I had to sit through a Wagnerian opera, I would be a  nervous wreck, because I don't like or understand this composer's work.  I  took my best friend to this screening, and could tell that she was bored  through some of it, and exhausted by the nearly three hour length.
If you  are familiar with Gilbert and Sullivan, love music, enjoy satrical wit,  this is a great movie.  But don't push friends to go and see it.  Gilbert  and Sullivan are almost like an ""inside joke"" nowadays.  My  friends loved ""The Green Mile"" - I feel asleep watching it and I  never could get through ""Dances with Wolves"".
I think home  video is a real treasure, as everyone can indulged their own tastes - also,  you can laugh louder at home!",966124800,10,1541,4.235294117647059
1108089,5,6305882010,"This movie was delightful, and that is from someone who is not a  particularly big Gilbert & Sullivan fan.  I have always loved Mike  Leigh's work and this one didn't disappoint.  It's quite different from  say, Life is Sweet or Secrets and Lies, but it is very, very well done.  Watch this movie when you have some time to relax, it's not a fast paced  quickie, but rather a two and a half hour film that is meant to be savored  and enjoyed.  The acting is superb, the costumes enchanting and the music  is entertaining.  It's also pretty funny, in typical Mike Leigh fashion.  Enjoy",965088000,2,584,4.457142857142857
1108090,5,6305882010,"Mike Leigh went to every painstaking effort to produce this film and the result is a brillinatly-cast, beautifully-staged, utterly-delightful account of the year surrounding the production of Gilbert & Sullivan's  comic opera, The Mikado.  What can I say about the cast?  They are all  fabulous!  Not one actor is mis-cast in this production.  Aside from the  obviously first-rate performances of Broadbent and Corduner as the movie's  primaries, the supporting cast turns in an outstanding performance.  Most  notable to me is newcomer Martin Savage as the brilliant (but flawed)  George Grossmith.  Shirley Henderson is also fabulous as Leonora Braham.  Timothy Spall as Richard Temple and Dorothy Adkinson as Jessie Bond also  help make the musical numbers in this movie look like part of a Mikado  G&S purists would be delighted to see.  Even after 2 1/2 hours, this  film left me wanting more.  Everything about it is splendid!",964828800,,932,5.224489795918367
1108091,5,6305882010,"Never a particular Gilbert & Sullivan fan, I only rented this because I had heard some good things.  Well,I was captivated--not only by the uniformly excellent performances, the wonderful sets and costuming but also  the music and lyrics. The picture of the ""time"" was absorbing and  both humourous and sobering. The legacy of these creative artists is well  conveyed. If you love theatre this is a must see.  Never thought I'd buy  this,but you can bet I well. See it.",964051200,5,469,4.8
1108092,5,6305882010,"If you don't like Gilbert and Sullivan, you should avoid  TOPSY-TURVY; clocking in at about two hours and forty minutes, it would probably be a torturous experience.  For everyone else, however, I give this movie my  highest recommendation.  TOPSY-TURVY concerns itself with a period during  which Gilbert and Sullivan find themselves at a professional impasse.  Their inability to agree on a suitable story for collaboration eventually  leads to their most popular operetta, ""The Mikado.""  Director  Mike Leigh's object, however, is to tell the story behind the story; he  lets us peek into the professional and personal lives of Sullivan, Gilbert,  and the D'Oyly Carte Company.  Jim Broadbent anchors the film with his  tremendous performance as W.S. Gilbert; he is infuriating and arrogant, yet  plagued with self doubt and even occasionally gentle.  Alan Cordeneur does  well as Arthur Sullivan, yet his performance is less involving and we don't  get to know him that well; but perhaps that was the point.  Leslie Manville  is quite touching as Gilbert's long suffering wife, Kitty.  The D'Oyly  Carte performers are played with just the right combination of humanity and  theatricality; in particular, Timothy Spall as Richard Temple (bewildered  and hurt that his role as the Mikado might be whittled to almost nothing!)  and Dorothy Atkinson, charming and alluring as Jessie Bond, are  outstanding.  There are generous musical excerpts from ""The  Mikado,"" ""The Sorcerer,"" ""Princess Ida,"" and  Sullivan's non-Gilbert music.  There is so much more worth praising in  TOPSY-TURVY, but instead I'll just close by saying: DON'T MISS IT!",958435200,45,1640,5.367588932806324
1108093,5,6305882010,"Naturally, as the DVD is not yet released this review is on the movie which should appear uncut on the DVD. It makes one realise the depth of theatrical talent in the UK when one can produce show like this with a large cast and not know one of the performers. Don't let this be a concern.  The show is realistic, to the best that one knows of the life and times of  Gilbert and Sullivan. It really shows their interaction, not always  perfect, their failings, personally and in business, all of which makes you  feel that you know them well, so realistic are the settings and the script.  The humourous interludes are plenty and the music, superb. In the theatre  and I would surmise on the DVD, the soundtrack is exceptional. You do not  need to be a G & S enthusiast to have a pleasurable three hours of  entertainment, musically and theatrically. I can't remember the last time I  enjoyed a movie as much and it deserves as many awards as can be offered.  Strongly recommended.",957225600,10,980,4.455056179775281
1108163,5,6305882010,"this movie has a mystical quality to it, it carries the viewer back to the Victorian age and the brightest period of comic opera, certainly Gilbert and Sullivan, and Carte were geniuses, but so were many of their actors.
Really top notch film...",1488326400,,245,4.72093023255814
1108164,1,6305882010,"Unlike the original release to DVD, this version has no close captioning, unless you are conversant in Edwardian mumble, much of the dialogue may be lost to you. This is a shame as it is otherwise a great movie for lovers of Gilbert and Sullivan and music in general. Ironic that Criterion provides an extensive commentary to tell the viewer what they are looking but not the captioning that would allow them know what the actual dialoge is.",1487203200,2,441,4.666666666666667
1108165,5,6305882010,"A magnificent film, quite beautiful in spots, but definitely for the Gilbert and Sullivan fan only.  While telling the story of how Gilbert and Sullivan wrote one of the all-time musical classics ""The Mikado"", the film presents us with a series of scenes rather than unified, flowing narrative.  Anyone familiar with G&S and their output will have no trouble following it, but it may be a bit of a challenge for the novice.

The performances are superb (Jim Broadbent was born to play W. S. Gilbert and Ron Cook is the very image of Richard D'Oyly Carte).  The evocation of a time gone by (when people were polite, civil and courteous, even backstage) is extremely well done.  Since most of the actors are not widely known in the states apart from Broadbent, Timothy Spall and possibly Andy Serkis (Gollum), one may actually see them as the characters they portray (apart from Jesse Bond, see below).  Many of the great Gilbert and Sullivan songs from the piece are aired, in various forms.  Sometimes it is in rehearsal, sometimes full-blown onstage.  And the lyrics, as Gilbert always insisted, are well enunciated and fully understandable, though a few get drowned in the finale.  Altogether a workmanlike piece.

A few caveats.  There is a totally gratuitous scene of topless female nudity.  If they are to be included they ought to be women with lovelier poitrines.  If filmmakers insist on shoving these in our faces they may as well be worth looking at.  And the ending is a downer.  We live in an age where joy and triumph can't have the last word so while I would have ended the film with G&S taking their well-deserved curtain calls, this flick travels on past that to make us understand Life is earnest!  Life is real!  Fiddlesticks.  All we needed as a memento mori was a bunch of tag overlays at the end telling us they're all dead now.

Minor quibbles. First, the portrayal of Jesse Bond.  She is a favorite of G&S addicts who studied the Savoyards and collected recordings dating back to Henry Lytton.  Those of us who dote on Jesse and read her (no doubt ghosted) book are disappointed that she comes off in the film as querulous and dim;  but the actors, I suppose, must be given different characters, and Bond does appear genuinely talented in actual performance.  Two other quibbles concern authenticity. Approaching the first night of ""Mikado"" the background music (presumably, by its sound, emanating from the orchestra) has a snatch of a tune from ""Yeoman of the Guard"" which has yet to be written.  And during Gama's song in ""Princess Ida"" the other characters onstage do a bit of mugging I doubt Gilbert would have countenanced--he believed the humor should rise from the words, not stage business.  Also, while the film buys wholesale the story of the falling Samurai sword, it gives Broadbent's Gilbert a wonderful moment of illumination that's well worth the effort.  Bravo.

I wish I could correct one thing, however.  ""The Mikado"" as portrayed on the film is done so beautifully I wish they had filmed the entire thing to add as a bonus disk.  Leigh's vision of ""The Mikado"" as staged comes off even better (arguably) than the 1967 D'oyly Carte film with actual Savoyards like Donald Adams and John Reed.  I'd like to see the whole thing, even with GG's legendary nervousness showing so obviously through.  After all, Koko is looking forward to boiling oil or melted lead.

Overall, worth owning for any G&S fan.  Worth watching for anyone interested in the era or curious about the music.  If nothing else, worth seeing once as a film of beauty when people had a sense of honor, of dignity, and civility.  And great music.",1486252800,5,3652,4.761146496815287

1108198,5,6305882010,"A recreation of the creation of the Mikado, generally faithful to the times and characters of the participants.  If I have a quibble, it is with the relationship of Gilbert with his wife.  Couples can be childless without one partner being totally clueless about sex.
That said, it does spare the foibles of the people involved.  Gilbert's irrascibility, Sullivan's womanizing (yes, the composer of Onward Christian Soldiers frequented brothels and had a mistress) and gambling. Helen, the super efficient manager for Richard d'Oyly Carte eventually married him and was key to the continued operation of the Savoy theater and the perpetuation of the G&S tradition after his death.
The best part of the movie, however, is the presentation of scenes from Princess Ida and the Sorcerer in addition to highlights from the Mikado itself.",1455408000,5,832,5.1940298507462686

I watched this film since it was made by the great and excellent Mike Leigh, and as a result, suddenly discovered the joys and wonders of Gilbert and Sullivan.

I now neither know how they did it nor how such a marvellous movie as this one got made.

1108275,5,6305882010,"Before film in the 20th century, the primary means of experiencing grand entertainment was music theater, known universally as ""opera"", an Italian word meaning ""many works"". Opera was regarded as a fusion of all the arts (hence ""works""), including the visual arts (the sets), literature (the libretto/story), and music (orchestra, chorus, singers). All these elements were combined to create the only large-scale theatrical experiences available at the time. In the 19th century on the continent, Rossini, Weber, Verdi, and Wagner were the masters of their versions of the art-form. Nearby in England/Britain of the late 19th century, the most popular collaborators were Gilbert and Sullivan, respectively the librettist and composer of ""topsy turvy"", or so-called ""light opera"", a sub-branch of opera more suitable to the tastes of the English-speaking world than the tragic grand opera of the European continent. ""Topsy Turvy"" the film concerns the up's and down's, the in's and out's of the duo regarded by both music scholars and music lovers alike as the instigators of what will eventually become musical and Broadway theater.

""Topsy Turvy"" takes us into the world of ""light opera"" of 19th-century London at the Savoy Theater-Hotel which sided on the humorous over the maudlin, favoring witty plots over morality tales. Gilbert and Sullivan's operas centered on exilirs, sorcerers, pirates, and princesses with humorous love-triangles and predicaments, all the while making subtle comments about English society. Instead of the tragedy of Italian, French and German Opera which involved Shakespearian monarchs and doomed lovers dying in the last act, light opera always ended on a happy chord with rather ingeniously amusing libretti.

The present film features Jim Broadbent as Sir William Gilbert and Allan Corduner as Sir Arthur Sullivan, both of which offer exemplary performances as the kings of topsy-turvy. The film begins with one of their few pieces which achieved only moderate success by their standards, Princess Ida. After the Princess' run, a revival production of their earlier opera The Sorcerer is put into play. However, the creators and the owner of the Savoy, D'oyle Carte, determine they need a much bigger hit than Princess Ida. The trouble is, the dynamic duo is at an impasse. Gilbert has written a new libretto concerning a magic potion set in Italy but Sullivan resists the work, feeling it rehashes old formulas, similar to an elixir and a lozenge of past productions. He fears his own contributions are starting to repreat themselves. From the outset, it appears the duo may never collaborate again.

By chance, Gilbert and his wife learn of a small community of Japanese who have moved to Knightsbridge in London where they sell Japanese culture to the English who are unfamiliar with Asian culture. These include music, theatrical performances, and artifacts. They take in a musical and theatrical performance, probably Kabuki Theater; Gilbert also acquires a Samuri Sword. Through a chance incident, which is apparently historically accurate, Gilbert conceives the idea for a new play, a piece which will become the duo's biggest success and their most enduring work.

""Topsy Turvy"" is a wonderful time portal into the late 19th century world of theater, its sensibilities, its ethics, and its dynamics. The world of actors, musicians, and producers are an eccentric lot, not always easily dealt with, and this film provides much incite into their world. In addition to Broadbent and Corduner who should have been nominated for Academy Awards, honorable mention goes to some of the supporting cast, particularly Timothy Spall as Richard Temple, one of the most talented actors of the Savory who was the original Mikado. Spall could have easily been nominated for Best Supporting Actor. Also Ron Cook as D'oyle Carte, Lesley Manville as Lucy Gilbert, and Martin Savage as George Grossmith also deserve strong accolades. This is the best film of such a subject since Amadeus in 1984.",1433808000,4,4019,5.284820031298905
1108276,5,6305882010,"Not much I can add that others haven't already. A wonderful (if slightly inaccurate) movie, presented in stellar Criterion fashion. Jim Broadbent and Allan Corduner are truly spectacular and believable in their roles (full disclosure: I do favor Mr. Broadbent's work), but in truth the entire cast really does shine. The movie's makeup, both 'actual' and 'stage', is impressive as well. As someone who has worked on the stage, I did find myself laughing at some of the smaller ""theater moments"" (like the cast in the wings mouthing the lines along with the ones being said on stage) but there's something here for everyone. I'm not a huge fan of G&S musicals, but one can't help but be captivated when hearing their songs being presented in such rich DTS sound and the stages being shot with such excellent cinematography.

1108381,5,6305882010,"An observation that I have made before on many occasions has to do with film being the only true time machine that humans have come up with so far. Starting with the oldest films from the beginning of movies in the late 1890s through the latest releases, we have a visual and aural record of events, people, places, and the fashions and attitudes in favor at the time the movies were produced. In addition there are those movies which are deliberate historical recreations of a specific time and place with specific historical characters that are also subject to the attitudes present when they were made. TOPSY-TURVY is one of these latter movies and it is one of the best examples of that genre that I have ever seen.

It is set in 1885. Gilbert & Sullivan have lost their creative spark and are relying on revivals of past works to keep themselves and the Savoy Theater going. A chance visit to a Japanese exhibition in London gives Gilbert the idea for a ""Japanese opera"" and thus THE MIKADO comes into being. That's the story of the film in a nutshell. What director Mike Leigh does is to expand that basic scenario and give us much, much more. We not only see THE MIKADO come into being but get a good look at the lives of Gilbert & Sullivan away from the theater. We also get to see a detailed look at the world of Victorian London and a behind-the-scenes look at the D'Oyly-Carte Opera Company and how a show is created from scratch.

What makes TOPSY-TURVY truly stand out is that you really do feel as if you have been transported back in time to the late 19th century. Every detail from the opulent and repressive Victorian fashions to the cluttered rooms with heavy furnishings to the secret lives of the characters is captured with remarkable fidelity (or the illusion of it). Gas jets and horse drawn carriages, backstage dressing rooms and secret boudoirs, the lost art of elegant conversation and more are impeccably recreated. Only ANONYMOUS (2011) about the authorship of Shakespeare's plays with its vivid rendering of Elizabethan London gave me such a powerful feeling of being there not as an audience member but as an actual observer.

The performances are all flawless from Jim Broadbent and Alan Cordurer as G & S to Timothy Spall and Martin Savage as leading members of the company. Since this is a Mike Leigh film there are several strong roles for women with Lesley Manville as Gilbert's long suffering wife a standout. The look of the film is incredibly sumptious and to think that it was made for only 10 million pounds seems beyond belief. The film's length (160 minutes) and deliberate pace will frustrate some people and Savoyards will want more opera and less background but if you love history, it's a dream come true. The Criterion edition is a definite upgrade from the previous DVD featuring lots of extras with the only flaw being no subtitles.",1397433600,5,2882,4.680473372781065

1108444,4,6305882010,"OK, might as well just confess it right up front--I basically don't like Gilbert & Sullivan's operas. I've tried, Lord knows I've tried, but to me they just all sound, look, and feel exactly alike.

BUT...all is not lost, as my husband is a G&S-aholic who has actually starred in several (local, OK, but still!) productions of their works. So I have had some force-fed exposure to G&S.

That is where I was at when I first saw this film in 1999 at our local indie (read: uriney-smelling firetrap) theater. I sat through it, enjoyed the lush cinematograpy and costuming and the wonderful period atmosphere...and laughed exactly one time.

Fast-forward to 2011. I have now been married to Mr. G&S for 21 years, regularly hear the music when he plays his CD's, and am availed of extended dissertations on practically every syllable. Still not excited by the stuff, but at least I know something about it.

With that in mind, I was sitting on the couch at home with Hubby and we decided to watch *Topsy-Turvy* on TV. I still enjoyed the atmosphere and the color, BUT THIS TIME I ALSO LAUGHED A WHOLE BUNCH! The reason? I had instantaneous commentary from Hubby to explain to me why this or that was funny.

I would give this film five stars if the viewer is very familiar with G&S--not just the music but the guys and the members of the company--but I'd have to take it down to two stars if you have no knowledge and/or no one to help you understand what is going on. I almost wish the film had subtitles that would say things like: ""And it may be amusing to note that the guy in this French whorehouse also wrote the music to *Onward Christian Soldiers*!"" Because really, there is just so much of this behind-the-scenes type of information you'd have to know to get the full impact of the film.

I would say anyone with a liking for costume/period films should at least give this one a start. You may get bored and give up, or you may, like I did the first time, enjoy it just for its portrayal of the period. And 100% absolutely anyone who likes G&S should buy at least three copies of the DVD just in case one wears out from overwatching. There's a lot to like about it either way, but you will definitely get more out of it the more you know about the subject matter.",1320796800,3,2267,4.424460431654676
1108445,4,6305882010,"`Topsy-Turvy' is a detailed and authenticated accounting of the collaborative efforts of composer Arthur Sullivan and playwright W.S. Gilbert to create something `serious' in tone, as opposed to their usual fare.  After a string of successes with their proven formula of topsy-turvy, they hit a stump when their latest release, `Princess Ida', fails to universally impress.  Sullivan is at a crossroads.  He wants to be taken seriously, and yet Gilbert's constant regurgitation of impossibilities makes their collective body of work feel redundantly childish and nothing more than entertaining fare; whereas Sullivan wants to be more than that.  He outright refuses to compose Gilbert's next play, simply because it is as absurdly formulaic as the last.  Gilbert, in a bout of equaled stubbornness, refuses to change his play.  Then, with a stroke of luck, Gilbert finds inspiration in an unlikely source (a Japanese exposition in London) and soon `The Mikado' is born.

The subject indulged here is quite elaborate, especially under the strong arm of director Mike Leigh.  This is a film that is rich with colorful details that create so many layers within the grandeur of the plot.  Sadly, some of those details can bog down the jovial mobility of the film.  There is a crisp atmospheric fluidity that Leigh creates, but he trips up in parts where he elaborates too much on the actual process taken to create `The Mikado'.

The length can become an issue.

That said, the components here are all beautiful on their own.  Leigh directs with a keen sense of dramatic humor, allowing the film to strike a beautiful balance between both worlds.  The production values are remarkable.  The costumes, the makeup, the art direction; it's all stunning to look at.  Every wall has character, polish and intrigue.  The way that multiple eras, cultures and personalities were encapsulated in this film is extremely impressive.  The acting is also a triumph.  Jim Broadbent is fantastic, delivering a deeply sincere performance that embodies the slight use of comedic touches that help make up the themes presented in the film itself.  I also found Shirley Henderson to be just consuming.  Every little detail is beautifully matched by her internal composition.  You can feel the melancholia surrounding her situation, and the way she closes out the film is sheer brilliance.

`Topsy-Turvy' is a spectacle for sure, a film that is larger than life and elaborate in tone.  It could have used with some tightening of the reigns a bit, for the material can seem slightly stretched thin in parts, but overall this is a film that will hold your interest tightly; and rightfully so.",1320710400,,2666,5.075862068965518

1108473,5,6305882010,"Amongst the greatest musical collaborations of all time, the collaboration between English dramatist, poet and illustrator W.S. Gilbert and composer Sir Arthur Sullivan. Both famous for their work which include ""H.M.S. Pinafore"", ""The Pirates of Penzance"" and ""The Mikado"".

""The Mikado"" is a comedic opera featuring music by Sullivan and libretto by Gilbert and it was their ninth of fourteenth operatic collaboration which opened in London back in March 14, 1885 and ran at the Savoy Theatre for 672 performances and by the end of that year, it was estimated that at least 150 companies were producing the opera.

When the opera was created, it was back during the 1880's when no one knew much about Japan and since the 1860's, there has been a fad of interest in Japan because all that people have heard was how exotic the location was and needless to say, people were intrigued by another country, so different than theirs. So, because of the interest in Japan, W.S. Gilbert was able to satirize British politics and institutions by disguising them as Japanese. But the inspiration for Gilbert to create something around Japanese culture, was because of a sword which supposedly fell from his wall. Because a Japanese family had moved to Knightsbridge, he recalled seeing the Japanese in their exotic robes and this was the inspiration he needed to create ""The Mikado"".

To celebrate this collaboration, the Criterion Collection is releasing on Blu-ray and DVD, both the 1939 film adaptation of ""The Mikado"" and Mike Leigh's (""Happy-Go-Lucky"", ""Vera Drake"", ""Secrets & Lies"") 1999 music drama film ""Topsy-Turvy"" about Gilbert & Sullivan's strained relationship and how ""The Mikado"" came to fruition.

The film would win an Oscar for ""Best Costume Design (Lindy Hemming) and ""Best Make-Up"" (Christine Blundell, Trefor Proud) and would also be nominated for ""Best writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen"" (Mike Leigh) and ""Best Art Direction-Set Decoration (Eve Stewart, John Bush).

""Topsy-Turvy"" begins in 1984 as ""Princess Ida"" is having its opening night at the Savoy Theatre.  We get to see Arthur Sullivan (played by Allan Corduner) who is quite ill and is injected morphine (common during that time) in order for him to conduct at the theater.  For Sullivan, he is growing tired of the operas that he and Gilbert are creating and wants to create a Grand Opera which pretty falls on deaf ears.

While Sullivan goes to Europe in hopes for his health to improve, ticket sales for ""Princess Ida"" continue to worse, so producer Richard D'Oyly Carte (played by Ron Cook) contacts W.S. Gilbert and Sullivan to an important meeting to create a new piece for the Savoy Theatre.  Unfortunately, despite having a winning collaboration with W.S. Gilbert (played by Jim Broadbent), their relationship is starting to sour and both men do not know if they can work together and feel that their partnership has run its course.  So, for now...Carte has no choice but to revive an earlier work of theirs titled ""The Sorcerer"".

But one day, while Gilbert and his wife visit a popular exhibition of Japanese arts and crafts in Knightsbridge, London, he is captured by the Japanese tradition culture.  From the geisha's who are dancing, to watching a little kabuki, he has no idea how much being there at the time would capture his attention to exotic Japan.

While in his study, a katana sword falls off the wall and from that point on, Arthur Sullivan is inspired to write a libretto set in exotic Japan.

The second half of the film features Gilbert, Carte and Sullivan working together in making ""The Mikado"" a success, which includes the challenges of getting the talent to wear Japanese outfits, the rehearsals and trying to get it right, backstage presentations, negotiating of salaries and also trying to capture the authenticity of Japan from the way they walk and use their fans.

With the lack of success of ""Princess Ida"", will Gilbert and Sullivan's ""The Mikado"" succeed with the audience this time?  Or is this the absolute final collaboration for the duo?

VIDEO:

""Topsy-Turvy"" is presented in the filmmaker's preferred aspect ration of 1:78:1.  The film looks absolutely fantastic in HD.  First, the art direction by Helen Scott, production design by Eve Stewart and the set decoration by John Bush and Stewart were fantastic.  The crew worked hard in trying to capture the 1880's and because of the colorful outfits of ""The Mikado"", the film is quite vibrant. You can see the textures in the clothing, even for the sets and walls.  Amazing detail and clarity and considering this is a 1999 film, there are times when you noticed films from the '90s on Blu-ray looking a bit soft or even aged.  Not in the case for this film.  The picture quality was great, even during the more reddish moments where you expect banding, didn't see it at all.

Skin tones were natural, blacks were nice and deep.  The Criterion Collection fans should be quite happy with the video presentation of this film.

""Topsy-Turvy"" was supervised by cinematographer Dick Pope and approved by director Mike Leigh.  According to the Criterion Collection, the new digital transfer was created on a Spirit Datacine in 2K resolution from a 35 mm interpositive.  Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, warps, jitter and flicker were manually removed using MTI's DRS system and Pixel Farm's PFClean system, while Digital Vision's DVNR system was used for small dirt, grain and noise reduction.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Topsy-Turvy"" is presented in DTS-HD Master Audio.  The lossless soundtrack is crystal clear as the crisp dialogue and music definitely sounds fantastic as it comes through the front and center channels.  The surround channels feature the crowd ambiance as you can hear the audience clapping or cheering after a play.

According to the Criterion Collection, the surround soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit from the original 35mm magnetic tracks. Clicks, thumps, hiss and hum were manually removed using Pro Tools HD. Crackle was attenuated using AudioCube's integrated audio workstation.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Topsy-Turvy"" is well-crafted, well-acted and a magnificent film by director Mike Leigh.

If there is one thing can you truly appreciate about this film is how authentic Leigh and his crew would try to attain a high level of efficacy when it comes to performance, set-up, production and costume design and make-up.  But also important was the casting of Allan Corduner and Jim Broadbent, the two men who brought out the characteristics of Sir Arthur Sullivan and W.S. Gilbert.

It's one thing to watch an opera and be entertained by the performances and the music but for me, part of the intrigue in learning about the two men are learning about their intricacies and also how unfriendly the two were towards each other.  The duo are known for producing enjoyable work that has quite literally made a lot of money for them but who would have known how Sullivan was with women.  How pompous of a man he was and who would have known how conflicted, petulant and driven Gilbert was.  The fact is not many of us know the men behind the music, this is where Mike Leigh comes in with ""Topsy-Turvy"", a film based on the famous Gilbert & Sullivan who went on to create the beloved ""The Mikado"" comic opera back in 1885.

So, popular that it was the second longest run for any work of a musical theatre and one of the longest runs of any theatre pieces of that time.  At least 150 companies were producing the opera and would continue to show the world that these two men still had it within them to work together and create financial operatic hits.  But ""The Mikado"" was the duo's most influential and most accomplished work.

Mike Leigh is able to hire talent that work as a perfect ensemble as these talent portray the actors that are featured on-stage ala ""The Mikado"" and also what transpires during their rehearsals.  What Leigh is able to capture is the actual creation of an opera.  From rehearsals to costume design, to capturing Japanese authenticity, the research that Leigh had to do in order to make this film look right and sound right is magnificent.  I don't think one will ever see a rehearsal captured on film as effective as ""Topsy-Turvy"" and at the same time, one may wonder if a film like this can ever be made by a major film studio.

""Topsy-Turvy"" is a wonderful Blu-ray release from The Criterion Collection and anyone who is passionate or intrigued by the work of Gilbert and Sullivan, especially curious about the individuals, this Blu-ray release is quite fantastic in presentation, special features and a film that looks and sounds fantastic in HD.

Overall, some may feel the film's duration may be too long for their taste at 170-minutes, but personally, this is one of those films were time goes quickly because it's so enjoyable to watch.  It's an accessible Mike Leigh film created with passion and it's look, feel and music succeeds in every level.  It's a film about man's pursuit of success but also one's shortcomings and I emphasize that one must not need to be an erudite in opera or the works of Gilbert & Sullivan to enjoy this film.  It may not be for everyone but it's a delightful film that is quite easy for me to recommend.

If you are a cineaste looking for a Blu-ray or DVD release that has soul, that has passion and captures the vibrancy and doldrums of two fascinating music icons, ""Topsy-Turvy"" is a must-buy release on day one.  Highly recommended!",1302652800,8,10765,4.942745969983324

Obviously some love this movie, but others will be a little letdown.  Perhaps a rental first is in order.",1298073600,4,584,4.596153846153846
1108517,5,6305882010,"Mike Leigh's affectionate, (mostly) factual and painstakingly detailed account of the partnership of William Schwenck Gilbert and Sir Arthur Sullivan--and the near dissolution of their partnership before writing The Mikado--might be the greatest backstage opera movie in recent memory. And it's being released on March 29 as part of the Criterion Collecton.

The film is set in 1884. Gilbert & Sullivan were coming off Princess Ida, a box-office bomb. Sullivan, newly knighted, was itching to write ""serious"" music. Gilbert was working on a new story idea, involving a magic lozenge--which Sullivan wanted nothing to do with. At a creative impasse, Gilbert hit upon the idea of setting an English farce in far-away Japan. The result: The Mikado.

Mr. Leigh's film takes you inside the world of these two creative geniuses, thanks to tour de force performances by Jim Broadbent and Alan Corduner as the librettist and composer, respectively. Mr. Broadbent plays Gilbert as a curmudgeon--the funniest man in England who can amuse the masses but barely cracks a smile. He is an irascible jerk, cold and distant to his wife, and absolute hell on his actors. Mr. Corduner does not pull punches with the portrayal of Sir Arthur. The composer is a drug-addicted mess who goes whoring in Paris and can barely get out of bed to conduct the Ida premiere. But the depravities of both men are redeemed by their respective creative genius, and the sheer alchemy that results when they put their minds together on a project.

And what alchemy it is. The core of Topsy-Turvy is a cracking series of lovingly staged excerpts from The Mikado, The Sorceror and Princess Ida, showcasing the multi-talented cast of singig actors--who all did their own work. Timothy Spall is memorable as Richard Temple, the bass whose booming ""Mikado"" aria nearly meets Gilbert's snicker-snee. Martin Savage is sufficiently decayed as the opium-addicted George Grossmith who originated the role of Ko-Ko. The supporting cast includes brief (but brilliant turns from Andy Serkis, Dexter Fletcher and

The female leads are strong as well. Shirley Henderson, (Leonora Braham/Yum-Yum) Dorothy Atkinson (Jessie Bond/Pitti-Sing) and Lesley Manville (Mrs. Gilbert) are all appealing. The elegant Eleanor David plays singer Fanny Ronalds: Sullivan's mistress. A scene where she and the composer duet on his song ""The Lost Chord"" at a recital  provides the most sublime moment of the early going, while Ms. Henderson's verion of ""The Sun Whose Rays"" ends the film on a perfect, wistful note.",1297468800,2,2546,5.215158924205379
1108518,5,6305882010,"A brilliant movie from Mike Leigh about fame, insecurity, and the creative process, masquerading as a bio-pic about Gilbert and Sullivan.  Leigh highlights the differences between these men: Sullivan crawls from his sick bed to conduct an opening night performance, held up by coffee, alcohol, and injections, while Gilbert runs from the theatre before the performance begins, preferring to face indignities on the foul backstreets of London rather than face the audience's judgment.  Sullivan is a randy devil, visiting French brothels and indulging a hedonistic lifestyle, while Gilbert appears to be celibate, never getting closer to his wife than sitting at the foot of her bed while in full evening dress.  He tells her, ""You must be tired.  I'll leave you to your beauty sleep,"" and then he does just that.  Sullivan longs to explore larger musical forms, and write grand opera.  Gilbert is comfortable repeating the same comic formula again and again, usually involving a magical device that sets the usual social relationships on their heads: servant becomes master.  Everything is topsy-turvy.

Though their operettas are very popular, the public seems to be growing a bit weary of this formula as well.  Conflict arises when Sullivan can take it no longer, and refuses to write the music for Gilbert's next work.  There is a rather low-key and civil argument between the men, mediated by theatre-owner D'Oyly Carte, but neither will budge.  But soon Gilbert's wife drags him to a Japanese exhibit, and the experience inspires Gilbert to write The Mikado.  Leigh may have taken liberties with the timing of the actual events, but it helps make the point that when creative people are forced outside of their comfort zone whole new avenues of creativity may be revealed.  The conflict between thier personalities provided the energy of creation.

Leigh then shines a fascinating light on sausage being made.  The Mikado comes together under strict direction by Gilbert, for whom every word and gesture are important, emphasizing that in any great performance (including the making of a movie) everything that _can_ be controlled _must_ be controlled.  The cast have their personalities, foibles, shortcomings, and quirks which Leigh sometimes focuses on in passing without providing much in the way of explanation or back story.  To me these omissions intrigue without cluttering the narrative, and they give a sense of the random variables that Gilbert must wrestle into shape.  In the end he and Sullivan create a huge success that has remained popular for more than a century.

At the end of the story, Sullivan (Allan Corduner) is reveling in the success of The Mikado, while Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) is confessing to his wife (Lesley Manville), that he is very uncomfortable with approval and fame.  She wants to connect with him and experience the success and approval that he rejects, and makes a mild plea for intimacy.  ""Don't go,"" she says as he prepares to leave.  ""Aren't there any more thoughts racing around in that head of yours?""  She looks at him longingly.  He replies, ""Like what?""  The camera captures her face slowly falling as her heart breaks.  She recovers by suggesting an idea for his next play that involves a wife, childless and ageing, being locked away by her husband.  His face reveals that he gets the point, but also that there is not much he can do about it.

If there is any doubt that the movie is about the conflicted combination of ego, talent, and drive that underlies the creation of art, it ends with Shirley Henderson on stage alone, singing ""The Sun Whose Rays are All Ablaze.""  Her character sings about the Sun, who does not apologize for being brilliant. He simply glories all effulgent.  Then there is the Moon, who shines by reflected light ""...that through the night / Mankind may all acclaim her. / But truth to tell she lights up well/ so I for one don't blame her.""  The creator's brilliance shines through the actors, like forces of nature, which require neither explanation nor apology.

The production numbers are gems.  I was mostly unfamiliar with The Mikado, but I perused the Internet to find clips of various productions.  From viewing these it seems that Leigh got the tone and intent of Gilbert and Sullivan's work exactly right.  Some of these productions were full of pratfalls, mugging, and unnecessary and uncoordinated choreography that distracted from the precision and brilliance of the lyrics.  Some were stiff and formal and lifeless.  Leigh let the words and music be heard.  There is an organic quality to the movie, as all the actors sing and play their own instruments.  I found myself regretting that Mike Leigh didn't set an entire production of The Mikado.  It would have been spectacular.  But I was very pleased to see that a blu-ray is to be released shortly, as this movie deserves to be seen and heard in its glory, all effulgent.",1293667200,4,4920,4.973072215422277
1108519,4,6305882010,"TOPSY-TURVY is a delightful music-laden biopic of Sir Arthur Sullivan and William Schwenck Gilbert (knighthood came in 1907) that deftly blends some fact with a good deal of fiction. Outstanding performances here from classically trained pianist Allan Corduner as Sullivan and Jim Broadbent as Gilbert, also from a supporting cast that's more than equal to the task.

Both leads are depicted as highly flawed. Early in the story, Sir Arthur's plans to vacation alone in France correctly lead his wife to suspect that soon after reaching Paris he'll be partying in a local cathouse. 'Schwenck' has a hair trigger temper and a hatred of his own mother that's never fully explained. Both lyricist and composer are stubborn men whose artistic differences may prevent collaboration on any new D'Oyly Carte plays.

Of the opera company, mezzo Jessie Bond suffers from a bad leg, again unexplained. Comic lead George Grossmith obviously has a morphine addiction. His usual opening night jitters nearly torpedo Mikado's debut. Romantic lead, Scotsman Dunward Lely is self-flattering, somewhat fey and very temperamental. Baritone Richard Temple seems luckless, prone to dwell on past triumphs and to worry about the future.

Lead soprano Leonora Braham is widowed by suicide, has a child and a drinking problem. The threat of termination hangs over her. Miss Henderson wasn't the ideal choice for this role. Braham had a delicate, expressive voice. What Henderson lacks in nuance she makes up for in overmodulation, especially on her shrill and slightly flat ""The sun whose rays"" which closes the movie.

Most interesting are the rehearsal phase and seeing the play come to life, also select numbers from Mikado, Princess Ida and G&S's third work, The Sorcerer, a two-act play based on Gilbert's Christmas story, ""An Elixir of Love.""  Mr. Savage in his big screen debut (as Grossmith) shines as the magician, and in his Mikado songs.

A particularly glaring factual error involves events preceding Mikado's creation. Gilbert never visited the Japanese expo in Knightsbridge until *after* the play's first act was completed, and he didn't purchase a Japanese sword there. In fact, he'd owned that weapon for some years. Nor did it fall from the wall of his study. But, this is a movie, yes?

Enjoy the music in Topsy-Turvy yet take its several personal stories with a lump of sugar, one that perhaps was brought back from Switzerland by Sir Arthur. Either way, this is a sweet experience, especially for aficionados of British light opera.

1. For Gilbert and Sullivan fans, it's hog heaven!

2. The cast includes some of my favorite British talent - Jim Broadbent, Alan Corduner, Timothy Spall, and now, some new favorites. Every single actor was so thoroughly involved in the life of his character; all turned out tremendous acting and singing performances.

3. The script was beautifully written; I was completely transported into the music, situations, historical events (such as the Japanese exhibition) and overall sense and sensibilities of the Victorian age.

4. It's one of the few movies I'll consider owning in this day and age of Netflix. This movie is one that I'll watch again and again, lend out, make sure that friends and family get to see.

And the music!  If you don't enjoy the delightful music of Sir Arthur Sullivan with the lyrics of William Schwenk Gilbert then perhaps this movie is not for you and I hope you enjoy your life on the moon.  If you are a seasoned Savoyard or a novice to G&S you will find this movie a total treat.  And if you have that rare gift of getting goosebumps when hearing beautiful music, then Topsy Turvy was written with you in mind. The movie is about the creative spark and the hard work that went into the premier, on March 14, 1885,  of The Mikado, arguably the most famous and best G&S opera.  Jim Broadbent is excellent as the curmudgeonly but hard-working Gilbert, whose inspiration lead to the staging of the opera, whose lyrics told the story of the little Japanese town of Titipu.  It also shows how  Gilbert's force of will was responsible for the entire style of the opera.  Alan Cordunnier is top-notch as Sir Arthur Sullivan, the composer whose desire to write beautiful music was only equaled by his desire to partake of all the physical pleasures of life.  Everyone in the film does a first-rate job. Beautiful costumes, heavenly music and acting of the first order will make you want to see Topsy Turvy again and again.

The only reason I can see for other reviewers describing Topsy Turvy as a comedy is Broadbent's portrayal of Gilbert as a man of limitless wit. It is about comedy, and much of it is funny, but by the end of the film one has been touched by the humanity of its characters and the perfect period performances of G&S masterpieces.

I found the rendering of the historical period to be splendid --as convincing as Rossellini's ""Louis XIV"".
The actual creation and staging of the Mikado (in the second half of the film) is likely to delight anyone familiar with the works of G&S -- or anyone who has ever struggled to put together an effective theatrical production.  The poignant illnesses and psychic suffering of the Savoy actors -- as well as the suffering of G&S -- set one up for goosebumps when they soared triumphantly into song on opening night.

The story of Gilbert and Sullivan's creative struggle before the inception of The Mikado is a classic tale of artistic partnership and of the lost-and-found muse.  If you have ever, as a writer or musician, found yourself in the doldrums of creativity and struggled through it, this movie is a wonderful articulation of the tedium and exultation of that process.  The love and resentment between Gilbert and Sullivan are beautifully characterized by Broadbent and Corduner.  And it only begins there.  The D'Oyly company and their relationship to one another and to their librettist and mentor Gilbert as they all struggle to produce The Mikado is subtly developed with a hyper-real texture that only Mike Leigh can possibly achieve.

1108588,1,6305882010,"Topsy-Turvy (Mike Leigh, 1999)

Mike Leigh's most recent foray into the wonderful world of celluloid made quite a stir when it came out. Much was made of how wonderfully the film showed the tension between Gilbert and Sullivan in the span between Princess Ida and The Mikado. Really? Well, then, where on Earth was it?

First, the movie could have been shortened from its interminable two hours and forty-five minutes by at least half an hour by simply cutting out extraneous and unwarranted bits of musical. Gilbert and Sullivan fans have already seen it all, thank you, and those of us seeing it out of curiosity, or forced to see it by others, don't care. Second, reality only goes so far in films, whether the films are non-fiction or not. If one of the cast of your play is a heroin addict, but it's not important to the action, you either don't include it at all or you use the character for some moral statement. It's not the best alternative, but it's certainly better than simply showing your character shooting up and then never going back to that particular subplot.

As for Gilbert and Sullivan, the much-ballyhooed tension between them could have been scripted by a ten-year-old. Perhaps my distaste for this film stems from seeing it in conjunction with a number of other films where tension between characters is handled with far more aplomb (Dancing at Lughnasa being a sterling example), but the two of them came off as not having enough depth to have any tension between them whatsoever.

If you don't mind sitting through two and a half hours of complete and utter boredom for a few chuckles (almost all of which come courtesy of Charles Simon as Gilbert's sadistically funny father), you're a huge fan of Shirley Henderson (though even that might not be enough to save you, she made a fan of me by making the most of a flat role here), or you just want to see disembodied clips of Gilbert and Sullivan, have at it.
Otherwise, you can safely ignore this. * 1/2",977788800,8,1979,4.645714285714286

But actually I've been a huge fan of G&S since my old school put on their own version of Ruddygore and my parents dragged me off to see Pirates of Penzance at the theatre!! I was intrigued by Topsy Turvey, not least because Mikado is one of my favourites, but because I didn't know what to expect from G&S as real life people.  This film was an absolute eye-opener. It not only explores the production of Mikado and the relationship (or lack of) between Gilbert and Sullivan, but it also gives a glimpse into British life at that time.  I think it provides wonderful viewing from script, scenery, acting and music.  You do, ideally, need to be either a Gilbert and Sullivan fan or interested in becoming one, but this film is definitely a moving and educational masterpiece and I am only sorry that not enough people know about it!",977356800,3,992,4.469613259668508
1108590,5,6305882010,"Topsy-Turvy takes to the world of 1885 London where Khartoum is under seige  by The Mahdi and Gilbert & Sullivan have created a new operetta that is playing to very mixed reviews.  The film opens to the release of a new operetta called Princess Ida, to less than falttering reviews.  Gilbert takes the reviews badly and Sullivan decides he wants to write his long delayed grand opera.  A new play by Sullivan does not improve the situation, it only gets worse as the two do not seem able to work together any longer.
Having reached a low point, we are shown how from this point of no return, something wonderful is created, The Mikado.  We see how Gilbert obtains the inspiration visiting a Japanese exhibition with his wife.  His enthusiasm is passed on to Sullivan and he writes some of the best music in the realm of light opera.
Watching Gilbert as director is engaging and entertaining.  It also shows the master at work.  The critique of 'Three Little Maids...' by visiting Japanese men and women from the exhibition is an important point in the film.  Likewise Gilbert's initial decision to scrap the Mikado's solo just before opening night, only to change his mind at the urging of the men and women of the chorus.  It speaks well of his ability and charecter.
Sullivan is likewise shown working with the singers and the orchestra as makes the magic of the operetta audible.  An important point to see is that Sullivan was not always out in the pit directing the orchestra and singers.  His very capable assistant is shown in this role and in the production rehersals of the play itself.  A very balanced rendering of the facts of the matter.
THe casting is excellent.  After I saw the movie, I looked up the original charecters on ther Gilbert & Sullivan Society webpage.  Some of the resemblences to the original people of 1885 by the actors in this film was incredible.
I feel the film's length was acceptable as we are given a better understanding of lives of Gilbert and Sullivan.  To have jumped right into the impasse without the preamble of the initial staging and reviews of Princess Ida would have been a disaster and destroyed a lot of the meaning of the film.  That the producer and director did not shorten the film, is to their credit.
This is an ensemble performance that seems to be a specialty of the British.  While Gilbert and Sullivan are central to the plot of the film, without the exceptional support given them by the rest of the cast a film such as this would never have gotten into production let alone been released.
Ther is one seeming inconsistency that, while not vital to the continuity of the film, is amusing.  Watch for the first date at the beginning of the film and the later reference climactic conditions.  See if you can see what it is I am amused by.

The attention to detail is quite breathtaking; everything from restaurant interiors to peoples bedrooms is created with such authenticity and craftsmanship that it puts many other films to shame. And its never boring.
Topsy-Turvy breaks down into a number of set pieces that each can be enjoyed individually: rehearsals, business meetings, creative disputes, attacks of food poisoning, tantrums, drug addictions, opening night jitters, etc. But this is no soft focus, travel brochure production of the Merchant Ivory school or (ugh!) Chariots of Fire; we are not hidden from the realities and social ills that characterised late-Victorian Britain. There are too many great performances to single out but one of my favourites is from Martin Savage, who shines as star tenor George Grossmith. Ron Cook as Richard D'Oyly Carte, Kevin McKidd, Lesley Manville as Gilbert's wife, Andy Serkis as choreographer John D'Auban, and Timothy Spall are also very good. I was less enamoured with Shirley Henderssons performance as Leanora Braham as she mumbles, and either has no screen presence or is simply not trying. Jim Broadbent is a towering presence throughout the whole film. And a good thing too.",1518566400,,1907,5.4391891891891895
7899319,5,6305882010,"This movie really makes you feel a good bit like you are seeing what it was like 100 years ago in a famous English theater company.  the detail from costume to the famous real events, even seconds in a Dickerson like London  and name drops, all shade  and hint at what it must have been like as the world was really changing into the modern world we know.  every person in this film the acting is so nuanced the dialects, the tiniest muscle moves in faces...let alone the actual music and lyrics can be beautiful witty or inspiring.  If you are a philistine like me but lightly enjoy a tiny bit of opera, this might get you into it.  I tried sowing a young-in this hope it works- along with the pirates of penzance movie the famous keystone cop scene is incredible like a live action cartoon Tony is incredible.  Too bad these are not available in better quality but at least topsy is available in blue ray.  not to mention besides the stars which are great chameleons, you got people like kevin kidd ( from the awesome series Rome,  Journeyman and famous TV doctor stuff) and other pre harry potter notable actors as an easter egg.",1516924800,,1132,4.429951690821256

7899326,5,6305882010,"I had to buy this to replace my VHS of it, because it is the sort of movie one watches with delight and wonder about 2-3 times a year. This film opens a window on a world in which so much was different that it is a revelation. I'm a fan of Mikado, of course, and seeing it from conception to premiere from a dozen viewpoints is a unique thrill. The costumes alone justify the cost, and of course the film won the Oscar for costuming in its year. And it is so very HUMAN.",1490054400,,470,3.957894736842105
