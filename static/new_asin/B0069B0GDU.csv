4980478,5,B0069B0GDU,"Heartwarming, inspirational documentary following a select group of nursing students in various stages of their schooling.  While some of the individuals in the film are Christians themselves, this film does not attempt to focus or force this issue as other reviews have suggested.

I loved the personal stories from each of the nurses and how they didn't pull any punches!

This would be a great choice for those interested in a nursing career, already in the medical field, or just like uplifting documentary films.",1388275200,3,517,5.130952380952381
4980479,2,B0069B0GDU,"As a soon to be nursing student, I was hoping to find motivation for my new adventure coming next summer with nursing school. This was far from it, I get the explanation of helping others as that is one of my main reasons for going down this path; but I expected a little more. Not worth the two dollars, should be a free video...",1384128000,,330,4.171875
4980480,1,B0069B0GDU,"The synopsis did not contain information of 7th-Day Adventist ministry under the auspices of what is otherwise generally understood secular, science-based profession. I am not, nor ever wish to be religious. My journey to RN is from a natural science background, not supernatural flavor of ""science"". Very deceiving and disappointing. I can only assume the high star reviews preceding my one star review are primarily from believer perspectives. I find it arrogant that the producers if this video assume that RNs, by intrinsic behavior, are religious. There are plenty of RNs that also happen to be agnostic or atheist. One does not need to adopt a supernatural, mythological dogma to care for the sick and injured.",1382227200,8,716,5.181034482758621
4980481,2,B0069B0GDU,As someone who is trying to figure out if they want to go to nursing or med school this was absolutely no help. Don't waste your money.,1368576000,,135,4.037037037037037
4980482,3,B0069B0GDU,"This video is pretty short and while somewhat interesting, it wasn't quite what I thought it would be by its description. It focuses mainly on a few people's personal lives while going to nursing school.",1362787200,,203,4.828571428571428
4980483,5,B0069B0GDU,"Journey of Healers is a documentary about nursing students giving their all to complete their education. This inspirational look into the sacrifices and challenges of nursing students will make you thankful the next time you're cared for by healthcare professional. Not only does it show just how difficult it is to juggle classes and clinicals, but it reveals the mind-set of the students and why they feel that it's all worth it in the end.

I would recommend this documentary to any student interested in nursing that wants to get a look at what nursing classes might be like. This would also make an excellent resource for nursing professors in their introductory courses.",1341273600,5,676,4.982300884955753
8495252,1,B0069B0GDU,Ok I only paid $1.99  for this film ands it was not worth it DO NOT BUY OR RENT,1489708800,,79,3.1578947368421053
8495253,2,B0069B0GDU,"On many levels this was a good documentary; however, there was a lot of ""plugs"" for the university that the students were attending, and quite a bit of church/missionary ""motivation"" mentioned. Given that this is a pay-for-view, I didn't like that at all. On the other hand, there is nothing left unturned about the amazing people and the commitment that it takes to make it through a nursing program.",1488326400,,401,4.826086956521739
8495254,2,B0069B0GDU,I should have rented instead of purchased. It's only 26 minutes and focused on a handful of students at a single small school. Worth a quick watch but not worth $15. Wish I could get my money back.,1488153600,,197,4.2105263157894735
8495255,1,B0069B0GDU,"This documentary was unfortunately the very whiney side of nursing students. I'm sorry but while nursing school isn't easy, it's not too hard where one should fail. I think these students make people scared to join a program because everyone hypes of the work load. You may not make straight A's, but if you put your time and energy into it you will pass. It came off as whiney, poorly represented, and a false reality.",1476144000,,419,4.6
8495256,4,B0069B0GDU,I like to watch Medical shows. This is an interesting one.,1464048000,,58,4.363636363636363
8495257,1,B0069B0GDU,I am a nurse.  Nursing school is the hardest thing you will ever do.  That being said I would never go back.  Becoming a nurse is the best thing I have ever done.  This movie is terrible.  The whining was endless.  I couldn't even finish watching.  I advise an information interview with a practicing nurse in your area of interest.,1457827200,2,332,4.433333333333334
8495258,1,B0069B0GDU,Absolutely terrible.  Don't waste your money!,1453766400,,45,6.5
8495259,3,B0069B0GDU,Good for new nursing students-to help them understand what nursing school is like and the special commitment and sacrifice needed to succeed. Only 30 minutes long.,1449100800,,163,5.3076923076923075
8495260,5,B0069B0GDU,important and great,1438300800,,19,5.666666666666667
8495261,5,B0069B0GDU,"Accidentally, I fhound this film. I am middle way of being a nurse. I was encaraged.

Thank you.",1430611200,,96,4.333333333333333
