8521838,5,B00008N72C,I think this is my favorite Bollywood movie. No one gets shot (though there is a little beat 'em up action).,1529971200,,108,4.190476190476191

8521840,4,B00008N72C,"Vicky (Sanjay Dutt) and Prem (Salman Khan) are brothers and the closest of friends. Sapna (Karishma Kapoor), Vicky's secretary, and Prem fall in love, but Prem waits to announce it hoping that his older brother will find a wife first. Unfortunately, when Vicky settles on a bride, it's none other than Sapna. Prem is torn between his new love for Sapna and his long-standing devotion to Vicky.

As often happens with Bollywood, this begins as a lighthearted romantic comedy, but in the second hour becomes a more serious family drama dealing with love, duty, and sacrifice. Dutt and Khan have excellent chemistry together and were entirely convincing as brothers. Kapoor, as usual, gave a fine performance, both comedic and serious. The musical numbers were good and the costumes were beautiful. Overall, it's an excellent and enjoyable movie from beginning to end.",1505260800,,865,5.134751773049645
8521841,5,B00008N72C,"Sooooooo good !!  It made you happy as they were in the movie.  It was a really good movie, but the camaraderie between Salman and Sanjay was really something to watch. It seemed like there was a lot of ad-libing between the two actors -- made it even better.",1462406400,,259,4.26530612244898
8521842,3,B00008N72C,"This is a familiar Bollywood plot focusing on the love and devotion of 2 brothers (Salman Khan and Sanjay Dutt). A girl comes into their life (Karisma Kapoor) and a romance secretly develops between her and Salman. Older brother Sanjay is encouraged to marry by their grandma who chooses Karisma for him. Salman does the noble thing and tried to arrange for Karisma to fall out of love with him and clear the way for big brother.
I don't mind a repeat of the worn theme but this sort of teetered uneasily between romance and comedy. The comedy took it out of heart commitment and into silliness which undermined my belief in the love. Salman's character is generally immature and giggly and even throws himself on the floor in a 2 year old tantrum at one point. Yet we are made to believe he has a deep heart commitment with Karisma. Sanjay looks a bit weary and, while he mouths the words of devotion to his brother, doesn't really look that interested.
Salman and Sanjay do connect OK though and they visually could pass for brothers. I wonder if director David Dhawan (who does seem to direct some pretty mixed comedies- some more subtle and enjoyable and some gratingly over-the-top) had reined in Salman and played the whole thing more from the heart, whether it would have worked better. If you don't like Salman (and he seems to evoke polarized responses) I'd guess you'd find this movie irritating as he can drift into a thick slice of hamminess - and again high pitched feminised shrieks which always look strange given the manly body image he tries also to evoke with his typical open shirts and shirt removals (and even a dialogue on how his abs were looking in this one!).
There seem to be more than average number of musical numbers. A few songs were more catchy but I haven't rushed to download them. They didn't extend the leads much in the dance either - though Salman and Karisma are capable of more zip than used here.
Elsewhere on the Net it tends to barely get average and that's where I'd place it too. Not a keeper.",1243296000,4,2037,4.553133514986376
