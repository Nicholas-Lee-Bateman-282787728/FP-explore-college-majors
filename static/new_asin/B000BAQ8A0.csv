2409541,1,B000BAQ8A0,"In this production, there is a transition from black and white costumes and background to color as the opera reaches the finish.  Even the black and white costumes are just a distraction and the final colors are so over the top that the music is subdued.

The other issue I have with the production is that many of the original musical flushes and peaks have been removed, especially from the Figaro aria.  In the special features, Pietro Spagnoli, who plays Figaro, admits that he and director Emilio Sagi removed the traditional and ""stuffy"" portions to ""polish"" the opera.

If you would like to watch a outstanding production of Il Barbiere Di Siviglia, the Metropolitan Opera House televised a version in
2007, in which Peter Mattei performs Figaro to what it should be, with the skill and comedy.  Him and Juan Diego Florez, who plays Count Almaviva in both, are able to act and sing to the best of their abilities as they play off each other's skill.

You can find this version on YouTube.  It might not be in high definition, but it is high in musical and visual quality.",1390867200,8,1078,4.6421052631578945
2409542,3,B000BAQ8A0,"Signor Figaro is not very enthusiastic, more or less he looks like he wants to get out of the stage as soon as the opera is over... and Count Almaviva tries too hard, but I don't think he did a great job.... Overall, beautiful modern stage to look at and entertaining.",1373241600,,268,4.2745098039215685
2409543,3,B000BAQ8A0,"I am very distracted by the modern set.  Give me the old fashion staging any day.  Probably would have been nice to watch in person, but on DVD....I think it is just ...OK.....",1370908800,,176,4.303030303030303
2409544,5,B000BAQ8A0,Bravo! I'm sure that others have already explained why this is such a fine production so I'm keeping it short and sweet. The entire cast do a great job. Nuff said.,1365897600,,163,4.290322580645161
2409545,5,B000BAQ8A0,"A wonderful production, visually stunning and and a remarkable performance by Juan Diego Florez. Definitely a worthy addition to your opera library.",1359331200,,148,5.7727272727272725
2409546,5,B000BAQ8A0,Great performance. Great singers. Beautiful music. Juan Diego Florez has become one of my favorite tenors and this is another performance i really enjoyed.,1357689600,,155,5.5
2409547,5,B000BAQ8A0,"This production of The Barber of Seville from 2005 was made at Madrid's Teatro Real which seems particularly appropriate for an opera set in Spain. There is, throughout this performance, a very Spanish variety of energy with background characters moving about with references to Spanish dance movements and postures which also feature strongly at the conclusion of the opera.

The setting is very stylish and strikingly clean-cut with much use made of black and white colour schemes.  Stage sets are moved in full view of the audience and are moved in such a way as to become part of the performance. The period is not precise but has an 18th century aura about it but seen very much through a stylised modern viewpoint. I found this to be very effective. The predominantly black and white colour scheme changes dramatically at the end with a festive burst of colour which adds significantly to the celebratory feel of the finale complete with .

The cast are uniformly excellent with a strong sense of fun being created. This is apparent between Figaro and Almaviva, between Figaro and Rosina and also extends to individual roles such as Bartolo, Don Basilio and the maid Berta who also sings her aria in act 3 especially well. Florez is very much billed as the star of this production and he is on very good form vocally and clearly enjoys his role in this production. A surprise addition is his extended final aria, normally heard at the end of Cinderella, which brings to tumultuous applause. However, he by no means otherwise outshines Pietro Spagnoli as Figaro who comes over as a particularly strong characterisation. He is also a particularly good singer who easily copes with the range and the speed of the vocal challenges. I would go so far as to suggest that this is one of the best musical performances of this role that I have yet seen.

Maria Bayo makes a fine Rosina with secure vocal technique and a good dramatic sense. She is also young enough and attractive enough for her to be believably attractive to Count Almaviva. Too often the singers chosen for this role are unlikely to appeal in these ways and therefore undermine the necessary suspension of disbelief for the story to work dramatically. Bartolo, in this performance, is more youthfully vigorous than in some performances which portray him as far past his prime. The role here is portrayed as more blustering and lightweight so his acceptance of rejection at the conclusion comes as no surprise to either him or the audience.  Don Basilio, performed by Ruggero Raimondi, is a reliable portrayal and the signature `scandal' aria in act 1 comes over well.

The chorus support the main character parts with good singing and characterisation and the orchestra play well under the attentive guidance of the conductor, Gianluigi Gelmetti.

The camera work and imaging quality are of a high standard as is the sound reproduction. The sound is presented in DTS 5.0 and stereo and is of good range and fidelity.

The is a 16 minute bonus film which takes a look backstage and a full-length documentary, `The Useless Precaution', during which the cast and the director provide a detailed introduction to the opera. This is well-worth watching and offers far more depth than is often the case.

Overall this can be described as a particularly stylish production with first class musical values couples with a strong forward momentum and strong dramatic characterisations. There is a winning sense of fun maintained throughout and the whole was much appreciated by the audience.  For these reasons I would expect most purchasers of this disc to share that enjoyment and to find this a very good production and performance. A 5 star rating seems appropriate therefore.",1343520000,2,3735,4.9049128367670365

2409549,4,B000BAQ8A0,"Barber of Seville is probably one of the most 'produced' opera on the Video for over 3 decades now. To compare these productions would be quite a folly, as one can see experimentation from time to time, trying to make the Opera 'feel' a little different all the time. That way, this one is no exception, except that the directors have gone overboard to make it as clumsy as possible.

The fact that it is staged in Madrid, does not mean that one has to incorporate a lot of Spanish peasantry dancing the Spanish thingies all over the place. At times I feel that there is a lot of 'loitering' around. I was, however, impressed with the sets as such and people moving it physically right from the time of the overture throughout the staging. This is probably the only redeeming factor of the newer 'innovations'. Otherwise, the 'extras' in this production are simply distracting, irrelevant and hamming it out most of the time.

Singing is just Divine. I would compare Florez with Florez himself. In the recent production of this opera in the Royal Opera House with DiDonato (in a wheel chair), Florez was not half this good. There, he took some time to warm up, his introductory Aria and the first two or three pieces were clearly shaky. Not in this production. He is fantastic throughout.

Maria Bayo, the pocket sized Rosina is better heard than seen. Oh, she has quite a charming smile all by itself, and I am sure she looks quite cute in real life when not singing. But this soprano, who has probably the BEST delivery of words and clear diction and a voice and intonation to match is no sight for sore eyes while singing. She contorts her face out of proportion (I have seen that happen in L'Elisir which she sung with Villazon last year) and makes a spectacle of herself. Of course, she is not really alone in this, but in a production that is being filmed in HD and sold in blu ray, I am afraid, it stands out quite a bit. I think the cameramen were aware of this too, and thankfully there are not too many close-ups of Bayo.

Spagnoli singing the Barber is making quite an impression as a 'Great' Barber, both here and in the ROH production. He is even better here than in the ROH again, because of the rather different tempi adopted by the conductor, Gelmetti.
It is always a pleasure to hear the other old warhorse, Raimondi as Don Basilio. Pratico as Bartolo has done as splendid a job here as he has as Dr. Dulcamara in the L'Elisir. He is the only one whose role fits the slapstick type designed in this production.

All in all, a good recording, sometimes muddy during the more animated portions involving more than 3 singers together.
One star less for the staging and dramatization, where the visual element which is so important while experiencing opera in any form makes it less satisfying to watch and have the satisfaction of having 'experienced' it in the end. I am only relieved that these guys did not try and transplant it into the 21st century as some would have been tempted to do.",1300924800,7,3006,4.518382352941177

8084039,5,B000BAQ8A0,I suppose that nearly everyone bought this DVD especially to hear Juan Diego Florez although he is not in the principal role..he does not disappoint. He never disappoints except when he sings songs at concerts that are not his forte. The production was very professional with increasing colour introduced as the opera went along. The main characters of the Barber and of the father and of the lawyer are all open to different interpretations with every singer in every production but in this production the only thing was that Maria Bayo loooked and sung much differently than as a woman in love with JD Florez ...But still  I enjoyed every minute so five stars,1421193600,,661,4.798245614035087
