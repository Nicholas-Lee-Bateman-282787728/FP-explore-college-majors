5740789,5,B00CU55HHY,"This Metropolitan Opera HD production is superb in every respect, technically and aesthetically. Anyone who appreciates the staging of this masterwork by Wagner in traditional form may be shocked and dismayed by this rather ""avant garde"" treatment, but the beauty of the music and the singing of all, particularly Kaufmann should transcend any and all negative initial reactions. Gatti's direction is wonderfully paced and adeptly nuanced.

Why this wonderful blu ray edition is available only in the European format and not in the U.S format is an excellent question, but not one that ought to reduce the rating of this particular performance to one star. To manifest one's ire in such fashion is misguided and wholly inappropriate. While I have a blu ray player that plays all formats, I too do not understand why Sony Classics or the Met would release an import version in a non US format. Shame on them, to be sure!  Amazon, perhaps you can wield your economic leverage and pursuade them to correct this folly expeditiously!",1389571200,11,1028,5.005847953216374

I'm not crazy about the production it's sort of contemporary but it's boring to look at IFAR the better parts of fall which is also well song to actually watch as well as listen to is also from the mat but from several years ago so there you have it there both are worth having",1447545600,,406,4.217948717948718
5740792,3,B00CU55HHY,"I was greatly disappointed. The singing is fine but the production was too, too extravagant  for my taste and I'm sure Wagner would be completely enraged if he saw it. It's fine to bring an opera to a more modern time but the spirit of it must remain the same or do not update the content so that the reason for producing it and seeing is completely lost. I know it was a mistake for me to buy it but of course when you buy it it's yours to keep but in this case not to ever see it again.",1445817600,6,488,3.88
5740793,5,B00CU55HHY,"There is no question that Jonas Kaufmann is a reigning tenor and Parsifal sounds as if it was written for him.  He is able to bring many colors to the score and make the entire portrayal of the title role an exciting one.  The cast all together is simply perfection: Rene Pape's Gurnemanz is full of emotions and conveys them even when he is not singing. The Amfortas of Peter Mattei is riveting and beautiful.  And Katarina Dalayman's Kundry is unexpected, she gives a fresh reading of the role.  The rest of the cast is very strong, but definitely the Met's chorus takes center stage in several instances and they sound impeccable.
Of course the orchestra plays at its very best, and I believe that musically this production is so satisfying due to the baton of maestro Daniele Gatti, who brings the most glorious sounds of the entire cast and musicians.  Comes to no surprise to learn in the bonus material that he was conducting the entire opera without a score: his understanding of Wagner, the music, the text, and the emotions are felt throughout and his attention to the smallest details and all the nuances in such complicated story make this a hard-to-beat performance.

And as stated before, it is a complicated story, one not easy to put on stage.  However, this production by Francois Girard is very well done.  Do not expect, however, to have everything given to the audience right off the bat, it is a very artistic vision, and I appreciate that many things are hinted leaving the audience to become active participants in making this an artistic experience from all angles.",1441584000,7,1589,4.731884057971015

5740797,5,B00CU55HHY,"I have over 150 classical DVD/BRs that I watch on a 120"" screen and listen through a 7.2 loudspeaker setup where the front speakers are about 9' 6"" apart and the surround / surround back speakers are placed where they ought to be. The room has sound treatments so I hear what's on the disc, not distorting reflections from the walls. My reviews concentrate on the surround audio, as you can pretty much judge the video and stereo for yourself on youtube and similar sites.

Surround track is listed as DTS HD-MA 5.1, but I listen to it in 7.2 with the receiver doing the decoding.

I don't think that I have ever praised a MET surround recording, but here it is:
Sound stage 180 degrees? Check
Orchestra detailed recorded? Check
Good balance between principals, chorus and orchestra?  Check
Voices are clear and move with the principals? Check
No drastic voice fluctuations?  Check
Applause from the sides and not the front?  Check

Result: 5 Stars for the surround audio, that seems to have been recorded with stage microphones only.

The staging helped with the stage on an angle and plenty of dirt that will not reflect as well as a wooden floor. Then what seems like 6 feet of carpet before the stage microphones that will further dampen unwanted reflections. The direction with pretty much everything in slow motion and the principals facing forward makes for a relatively uniform sound and still allows the depth of the stage to be captured.
Much to my surprise Post Production Audio Mix was still Ken Hahn, who shows that he can mix once he's given clean and enough channels. Audio Supervisor was John Kerswell, 10 names are given for Audio. My compliments.

Let's hope that this is the new surround audio standard of the MET",1434844800,7,1732,4.711920529801325

5740800,5,B00CU55HHY,"This is a fantastic production of Parsifal if you can tolerate modern adaptations. I generally prefer a traditional, as intended, production but there are times when the modern adaptation works. In this case, it works beautifully.

Remember, you're reading a skeptic. I almost dreaded seeing what is going to happen to Kaufmann in this opera. Sure enough, they get his shoes and shirt off but the silliness ends there. The acting and singing in this production are pretty close to perfect---again, Kaufmann isn't the greatest actor in the world though he well may be the best tenor. However, acting befuddled and confused suites him perfectly in this role. I don't think he fully assumes the title of keeper of the Grail and Spear collection at the end of the opera. He still doesn't really seem to get it. I give Kaufmann a B+. (only because of acting)

Pape on the other hand hits it so far out of the park that they'll never find the ball. Acting and singing are perfect. He nails it. A+

Katarina Dalayman is really good Kundry. She seems to understand the personal hell that Kundry faces daily. She wants to do good but is owned because of her transgression. This is a tough role very well performed. Solid A for Katarina Dalayman.

Peter Mattei is a terrific Amfortas. Man, I feel your pain. A+

Maestro Gatti steers the orchestra for 4 1/2 hours of perfection.

I cried at the end. It's that powerful. It's that good. Watch an act each night and savor it. This is well worth adding to your collection. It's a beautiful work of art.

The staging? I thought it was rather interesting. It delivers the right message at the proper time. No, you don't get people in knight costumes running around a castle and you get a meadow scene with blooming flowers---well, sort of. You do get a good feel for what Wagner was trying to say...

Don't let the bad reviews scare you off. It's wonderful. And I'm very critical.",1428451200,22,1914,4.608823529411764

5740802,5,B00CU55HHY,A great production of Parsifal. I saw this at the Met two years ago and the video is almost better than being there. Terrific cast! The lighting projections alone are worth owning this video!,1427068800,2,191,4.647058823529412
5740803,4,B00CU55HHY,"It would be better to have this production only in a cd, because it is a feast for the ears, the best sung Parsifal I have ever hear, but it is the ugliest to see.
I am tired of minimalist decorations in opera. I understand that the management of the houses like them because they are cheaper, but the old realistic decorations were beautiful most of the times, and we need to go back to them again. The decoration in this Parsifal it is not only minimalist, but it is also ugly. When Parsifal sings that Nature renews on Easter Day, you do not see anything of that, like in the old productions, but a barren landscape in dark colors that only makes you think of ugliness and doom. Also, I have never seen such an unatractive group of Flower Girls.
Besides, I miss the times when people went to the opera to hear the music, not to see naked people in the scenary. I am not an expert on male beauty, but I think that Jonas Kaufmann's flaccid body or Peter Mattei's prominent belly look better when they are covered.",1426118400,4,1014,4.31413612565445

5740807,5,B00CU55HHY,"Not usually a fan of 'modern' or 're-imagined' productions that stray far from the composer's concept or intent, I approached this Parsifal warily, having read early reviews and seen production photos online. Of course, news of the bloody stage of Act II further set off alarms. Having experienced live and on video several 'Eurotrash' productions in the 80-90's (Turandot, Die Tote Stadt etc), I was prepared to walk out at the end of Act I of the LIve HD broadcast in my local cinema.
But no.
From the very beginning of the Prelude, with the reflecting but transparent curtain gradually revealing the 'citizens' standing in their modern clothes - the men in white shirts, ties and black jackets, the women in black dresses with veils - moving seemingly at random, and then the men taking off their coats and ties and shoes. Watching the individual singers/dancers, the expressions on their faces, it was clear something almost surreal was taking place. Something emotionally overwhelming was happening onstage; every person was a participant in this story and obviously affected by it.
Watch Amforta's two attendants, who support him throughout, physically and emotionally. Watch their faces and body movements. Shattering.
I have the DVD of the Met's 1993 Parsifal with Sigfrid Jerusalem et al; and cherish it as much for its traditional staging and its spiritual faithfulness to Wagner's vision as for the music and vocal talents of the cast (Bernt Weikel's Amfortas especially).
But this Parsifal stands alone and apart.
The movements and actions of the people on stage reflect the words and actions of the principals; like a Greek Chorus they reflect on and punctuate and intensify the action. Watch their faces (get the Blue-Ray) and you will see they are as moved by what they are doing and seeing and hearing as we are.
About the bloody spear-carrying Flower Maidens of Act II. Here they are Klingsor's guards as much as Parsifal's would-be seducers. Their syncronized movements are again as a Greek chorus. (a bit of missed drama here as Parsifal takes the spear)
Another reviewer has said 'this is not a Christian opera'.
The themes of sacrifice, salvation, love, selfless charity are Christian values.
This is the story of the 'holy Grail', the cup used at the Last Supper that contained wine symbolizing Christ's blood; the spear that pierced Christ's side, and Gundry, who reveals she witnessed the Crucifixion and mocked Christ on the cross, therefore being forever cursed.
So no matter how 'modernized' it may be, and with references to Buddah, it is a 'Christian' Opera.
The pain suffered by Amfortas, to be relieved only by the 'pure fool' who will endure much pain and duress to save him...the ultimate baptism and salvation of Gundry...the reuniting of man and woman and rebirth of the Earth...with clouds and Planets and dunes moving and floating continuously across the backdrop are a living part of the action and not just a gimmick.
The glory of Act III builds and then plunges to the final sublime and heavenly final transformation. Amfortas falls into his father's grave; he grasps the spear to the wound and is healed. Gundry is finally saved and falls lifeless.
This is a complete re-interpretation in staging, but true to the Composer's theme and intent...and it achieves greatness, I think. Somehow, I saw and heard things I had never heard or understood in many previous viewings of the opera.  I wonder what the composer would think.
Open your ears and eyes and be prepared to challenge your very conception of Parsifal.  I pulled my chair closer to the bigscreen Hi-def TV; turned up the surround sound, like being just in front of  the orchestra pit.
My only complaint would be: the stream begins to flow again, and the sky blazes, but where is a blade of grass, a flowering branch or single flower to illuminate the glory of Spring and Resurrection, as the music portrays and Gunemanz proclaims?
This is a performance that repeated viewings only enhances and deepens; I have yet to show any of my non-Wagnerian friends. It is too personal, and how do you explain to them how and why it affects us so?
Get the Blue-Ray, and watch the faces and movements of the entire cast.
I'm getting verklempt all over again.....",1420502400,8,4249,4.923291492329149
5740808,5,B00CU55HHY,"This is a masterpiece,As far as  was concern, there was no weak point. Gati and the orchestra gave a fluid and moving performance. As far as the singers ,I cannot say which one was better than the other. Peter Matei was superb in the first act .To me ,he was incredible. I am a great fan of Jonas Kaufmann,and he did not disappoint me Bis development from a young fool ,not caring for anything,to a formidable king,full of faith was so moving and creditable. Rene Pape was also the ideal Gurnemants. Each time I play this DVD,I am overwhelmed by it. This is the best performance of this work to date.",1419465600,3,600,4.405405405405405
5740809,5,B00CU55HHY,"I did not know what to think of it at first, but as I viewed it several times it became more real and a super metaphor for what makes us human and how we are always striving for the perfection that is out there somewhere.",1418860800,2,221,3.933333333333333

5740811,5,B00CU55HHY,"Saw this live at the Met- the video does a good job of what was for many, an overwhelming experience. Gatti conducting from memory- outrageously brilliant-Pape one of the greatest Gurmemanz...and Kaufman, Mattei... and the overall IDEA-- another post apocalyp[tic Wagner but it just worked and was so moving. Not Euro-trash by any means. Yes a lot of blood (?menstrual/crucifiction/???)but constant with the over arching theme of universal pain, wound and redemption. The DVD did miss a few intriguing moments, like the strange women who appears at the very end and wafts away--maybe Herodias' spirit or doppelgnger...WOW",1416182400,6,621,5.412371134020619

5740814,5,B00CU55HHY,"I wish I could assign ten stars to this recording. This the one to purchase. Period. I bought it primarily because of the presence of Jonas Kaufman. Eventually, he will record TRISTAN UND ISOLDE, and perhaps the last two RING operas as Siegfried. Those also will be the ones to buy. How fortunate we are in the early 21st century to have a true HELDENTENOR to sing Wagner! But the wonderful surprise is that this whole production - singers, conductor. stage director, set designer - is blessed with an innovative approach to PARSIFAL that finally fulfills the hopes of those of us who see this opera as a visionary experience. I won't even try to justify that statement to those who still view PARSIFAL as the sick, bitter Nietszche did or those who can only see Wagner as a proto-Nazi. Gone from this production are all the medievalisms of Wolfram's poem, gone too are the affectations of directors who despise the work's intense re-interpretation of the GRAIL theme. The director gives us instead a COSMIC PARSIFAL. The sky is the real arena of action in Acts One and Three. Huge planets loom into view and cast their solemn weight over the Grail ceremony as if the GRAIL KNIGHTS were putting themselves in accord with the Universe by the ceremony. A tiny stream trickles over the dessicated ground but is transformed into a broad waterway fructifying the land in Act Three as the men of the Grail castle intermingle with the women of Klingsor's destroyed castle, and a New Age of Male-Female union begins on a restored earth. This is
a visionary PARSIFAL for the 21st century, and I believe it was implicit in Wagner's amazingly beautiful music all along. Listen. Watch. Believe.",1413763200,6,1682,4.763698630136986
5740815,5,B00CU55HHY,"I had never been a great fan of ""Parsifal"" until I saw this production in HD  last season in the theater. I had sat through what seemed like five hours of self-flagellation during the acclaimed Wieland production at Bayreuth in 1971 and a couple of other productions in different places. As a life-long Wagner fanatic, I kept wondering why I could not find my way into this marvelous work. Thanks to this production, that has all changed. The music is gloriously played and the setting is very effective in bringing out the current imbalance in our masculine and feminine values. Yes,""relevant"" seems to be a very apt term for this production, and the mirrored screen used during the prelude is an obvious reminder to look around and see a wasteland much more in need of the redemptive values of the grail than the world on the other side of the glass. The directing has so many fine touches that moments like Parsifal's two entrances in act III are extremely powerful as is the ""entrance of the bed"" in act II. The singing is nothing short of glorious and the acting is as if it were inspired by The Master himself, leading, guiding the performers infallibly from somewhere within each artist. In the final scene I think Kaufmann and Matei rise to levels of breath taking conviction in their ability to convey such heart wrenching suffering and compassion. Astonishing accomplishments, both .And one truly feels a release, perhaps redemption for the redeemer, when Kundry finally is released from life and from endless incarnations.

According to Father Lee in his very fine""The Olive Tree Bed and Other Quests,"" Mahler,after seeing his first ""Parsifal"" in Bayreuth said,"" Emerging from the Festspielhaus,I realized that I had undergone the greatest and most soul-wrenching experience in my life, and that I would carry this experience with me for the rest of my days."" Father Lee adds that when Sibelius saw his first""Parsifal,""he said ""Nothing else in all the world made so overwhelming an impression on me. All my innermost heartstrings throbbed."" Also,Hugo Wolf, says Father Lee, declared""Parsifal"" ""by far the most beautiful and sublime work in the whole field of art."" Father Lee recounts similar responses of his own after the ""Parsifals"" he has witnessed saying ""I can remember...staggering out of the theatre after ""Parsifal,the music streaming through me, carried out of myself, seeing my experience--indeed feeling that I was seeing all experience--at a higher level of awareness, unable to speak,put in touch with a power greater than myself.""

Such is the power, the enchantment one can experience when encountering""Parsifal.""Thanks to this Met production this work carrying such powerful redemptive value has been redeemed for me. Even so, there can never be
a last word, a definitive reading of this enigma wrapped in a riddle, but this production is the best for those just beginning to explore the riches of this masterpiece.",1413763200,4,2943,5.051440329218107
5740816,2,B00CU55HHY,"Parsifal on the Mars???

The set is supposed to be in the mountains of Gothic Spain, at least with some tree.  Where is the castle and forest?  Where is the thick heavy medieval atmosphere Wagner loved so much?  To me it seems the stage set is salvage of the wreckage of the last act of Manon or Manon Lescaut.

In the 1st act, the hand movement of the male chorus on white shirts - what is it?  Chines Chi exercise?  I understand it is time to economize everything, such as fancy medieval knight armors and wounded king's fancy litter.  I simply wonder what signature designer brand of shirts they are on.  Above all, why are the male chorus there on the stage?  Aren't they supposed to be with Amfortas at the back stage?  The stage is already full of 3 main singers, and again their meaningless body movements makes it difficult to focus on singing of Gurnemanz and Parsifal.

In the 3rd act, where is the well?  It is supposed to be a well, not an almost invisible small stream.  Where on earth did the director get the idea of dipping the the spear in the holy Grail?  How original!

Why doesn't MPO commission a new opera of which set is in the Mars or a desert and singers  in more futuristic costume instead of messing up such a beautiful opera full of medieval European spiritual austerity!

Here is Parsifal singing of the beauty of the flowers, how he's never seen such wonderful blooms before... and they are standing on what looks like the surface of the moon with a huge projection of a planet behind them (looks just the the Sphere from the movie of the same name).

It is so beautifully sung and acted, full of pathos and nuance, a truly deeply moving performance in this exquisite music. Pape and Mattei rise to the occasion as well.

This one, I did, only because of the magnificent singing of Jonas Kaufmann and Rene Pape.  I have never seen the opera live; however, I doubt that would matter.  I would probably come out complaining about having spent so much money for such nonsense.  I have always felt that Richard Wagner had an overblown opinion of himself and his music.  Be that as it may, I find some of his work incredibly beautiful:  ""The Ring Cycle,"" ""Tannhauser,"" ""Die Meistersinger...,""  and ""Lohengrin"" to name only four.  His overtures and instrumental sections are gorgeous and lush.  But ""Parsifal"" is the stupidest story and the most boring music I have ever had to sit through.  With it, Wagner certainly did not find the Holy Grail.  At least I hope not.
The production was excellent and I laud the Met on continuing to do marvelous things.  My hat's off to Daniele Gatti, Francois Girard and Michael Levine.  They should use their talents with better material.",1403481600,6,1068,4.733695652173913
5740825,5,B00CU55HHY,"It was pure luck that I happened upon the Public TV broadcast of this""Parsifal"" last year and I was glued to my seat for the duration of this opera, at first because of curiosity and then because of fascination with this oddly moving production. It moves extremely slowly, too, for close to 5 hours, I think. However, if you're willing to give it your time and attention you will understand why this performance has won so much acclaim. For me the highlight was Jonas Kaufmann's performance of Parsifal's aria ""Amfortas! Die Wunde!"" in the second act. Pure genius, I think. And if that is not enough, how about Peter Mattei's portrayal of the unfortunate king Amfortas. He sings and acts that role to perfection. And then there is Rene Pape as Gurnemanz, the benevolent head of the religious community Parsifal wanders into and mezzo soprano Katarina Dalayman as Kundry who changes Parsifal from carefree young man into a man with a mission with her kiss. All of the protagonists are experienced and skilled singers and the staging of Francois Girard is imaginative,intriguing, and impressive. Daniele Gatti conducts with sensitivity and cooperates with the singers on stage, apparently, as they express their appreciation for him. For me this is a hallmark performance, so much talent and creativity assembled in one great opera house!

But this recording has quite a few other gems. There is first and foremost the Gurnemanz of Rene Pape. He's had a lot of competition from previous singers in this role. Kurt Moll comes to mind. But Pape cannot only take it up with the best, he can simply outdo them. And then there is the revelation of Peter Mattei. My only previous acquaintance with this baritone was as ""Figaro"" in the ""Barbiere di Siviglia"" - quite a switch from his gripping, pluperfect Amfortas here. And Katarina Dalayman and Evgeny Nikitin can easily hold up their heads in this illustrious company.
On the other hand, as much as I admired the singing, I disliked the production. Give me a traditional setting for ""Parsifal"" anytime. The barren first act had little to offer but having the scenery repeated in the third act, stopped making sense altogether. According to the libretto, it is spring - Good Friday, to be more specific - with greenery and flowers and all we have is that barren landscape once more. And then there is the second act: nothing but imitation gory kitsch. However, while the second act actually could get away with that, the first - but especially the third - are nothing but just drab.
The sublime music was in the capable hands of Daniele Gatti and along with the superlative voices and acting, this recording is definitely a ""Parsifal"" for the ages.",1402444800,9,1731,4.623376623376624
5740827,5,B00CU55HHY,"I saw this production in HD and knew immediately that I had to own it. It is, subjectively speaking, the most satisfying performance of this glorious opera, visually and aurally,  that I have ever heard or seen - and my memory goes back to Sandor Konya and Jerome Hines, continues through Jon VIckers, Sigfried Jerusalem, Kurt Moll, Bernd Weikl, Christa Ludwig, Jessye Norman, Waltraud Meier, Thomas Hampson - a more recent, profoundly moving Amfortas - to name some of the great Met singers who have previously sung Parsifal there. There is passion in this performance, and subtlety. The orchestra pours forth glorious sound in one moment and  in the next whispers thanks to the inspired conducting of Daniel Gatti. Rene Pape, Peter Mattei, Katerina Dalayman are astounding singers and actors. Each is caught up in the moment, coloring their voices accordingly. After Dalayman's ""lachend,"" I broke my rule of never uttering a sound during any performance to whisper to my wife: ""she nailed it."" And then there is Jonas Kaufmann.  Mere words do not describe this magnificent tenor. One must feel his presence, the power and beauty of his voice, the depth of his understandng of this complicated role. ""Amfortas, die wunde"" will tear your heart out.  This is a run don't walk purchase.",1402272000,7,1284,4.985981308411215
5740828,5,B00CU55HHY,"As usual, the production will ultimately be a matter of personal taste but the performance is superb.  There is much more to like here but the performances of Kaufmann and Pape are reason enough to cherish this disc.  There are many DVDs available with one or more outstanding performer to recommend them but this, in my opinion, carries the least number of reservations and delivers a stunning HD image; there is no doubt that the viewer will have a trans formative experience.

The opera DVDs allow one to possess these magnificent performances and review their effects once again. I purchased this DVD and anxiously watched on my nice 27 inch TV and it was like watching paint dry. I watched it an act at a time and I have to admit that I still haven't finished watching the last act. I am going to give it anther try on the 42 inch HD screen later and maybe it will show better.

Having a DVD one can choose how long to watch and one can see the best parts again, even having  new insights on close repetition.  The exquisite performances of Jonas Kaufmann and Rene Pape make the story more meaningful than ever.  The excess blood on the maidens was, perhaps, overdone.",1398988800,,378,4.681818181818182
5740836,4,B00CU55HHY,"The reviews of this production of Parsifal, thus far, show an interesting pattern.  Either reviewers love it (5 stars) or hate it (1 star).  Having just viewed the DVD, my reaction is quite positive but not gushing.  Let's start with the positives.  Even the few who have panned the production agree that the singing is generally first class. The roles of Gurnamenz, Parsifal, Amfortas and Kundry can hardly be better cast today.  Klingsor was also well sung although I must confess that I don't care that much for Act 2 (in general, not just this production).  For one thing Act 2 seems too long by half.  (I realize many folks have the opposite reaction and consider the narratives in Act 1 interminable, but I relish the music of the outer acts.  In any event, all Parsifal fans can agree that Act 3 is superlative.  Like most successful composers, Wagner had real skill in building his operas to a satisfying, often overwhelming, last act.)  Back to the review: in vocal terms the primary interest to many will be Kaufmann and Pape since they have the most singing time.  As others have noted, Kaufmann has the rare combination of a great voice and acting skills -- these are both in evidence in this production.  (Although I am an immense fan of Vickers, I  must confess that Kaufmann almost equals his intensity and surpasses him for vocal smoothness although not necessarily power.)  Pape, in my view, is a wonderful singer; I have never been disappointed by him; he handles the length of the part well and my only carping would be that he doesn't quite have the gravitas (subjective judgment obviously) of a Hotter or the depth of a Frick.  Dalayman has come in for some criticism in these reviews, but I thought she was fine both vocally and as an actress.  But, again, I must confess that I regard Act 2 as a duty to endure rather than a pleasure.  The seduction scene in all productions of Parsifal seems to lumber along like a bored prostitute with a bumbling customer (well, maybe that's what it is).  Here's where the big mistake enters this production.  As Kundry attempts to seduce Parsifal in a rather austere staging, the director has the brilliant idea (heavy sarcasm here) to roll in a large bed upon which they can frolic.  It is so out of place (and so dumb -- like we don't know what her intentions are) that I laughed aloud.  The runner-up was dressing all the men in suits and cheap ones at that. (Oh, of course, that make the message of Parsifal relevant to our era; never would have thought of that without the director's help.)  Seriously, aside from these gaffes, I found the staging to be involving and thought provoking (even if some of my thoughts were ""what the heck does that mean"").  To the traditionalists who are scandalized by the singers  wading through a river of blood, and having many silent extras on stage, yes this production was not staged like the Bayreuth original, and there is nothing inherently wrong with either approach.  If all productions kept closely to the original, there would be less need to have new productions in the first place.  I have seen just about every DVD of Parsifal that is available, and I would put this one in the first rank.  It's certainly not traditional like the more literally staged MET production conducted by Levine.  That one is fine if you want a more literal staging, although, overall, it is not as well sung or conducted as this one.  But why not have both a traditional production and something different to pull off the shelf?  Among the ""something different"" productions, this one is the best.",1397779200,12,3585,4.662420382165605
5740837,1,B00CU55HHY,"This ridiculous staging has nothing to do with the work; dozens of characters constantly milling around and uselessly cluttering up the stage, stage action which has nothing to do with the tale, flower Maidens with spears moving in synch (phallic symbols perhaps, and representing what?  your guess is as good as mine), and what could possibly be the purpose of covering the entire stage with fake blood during the second act!!  Just to show the MET has the resources and money to waste on doing it??  I actually did wonder how much that little stunt actually did cost.

To my way of thinking this nightmarish and demented vision of the work is an example of artistic treachery and lunacy of the first order.  It may not be quite as terrible as the present completely worthless, jumbled up hodge-podge of a production gracing the Bayreuth stage presently  (which can be viewed on several online sources), but it's still not worth watching or purchasing.

I cannot fathom why or how anyone could like this theatrical garbage unless they were completely ignorant of the Parsifal myths and cared nothing for Wagner's original intentions and vision.  If you want to see a first rate Parsifal production get the MET's older production.  It's far superior; the only outright failure being Klingsor's idiotic spinning globe.  Contemporary directors and designers seem to be laboring under the delusion that we humans live for hundreds of years, have been overloaded with ""normal"" productions and are so bored with them, we are yearning for anything different no matter how absurd it may be.

What frustrates me most about all these foolish ""updatings"" and reinterpretations of Wagner's works is that we finally live in an age where the technological realization of Wagner's very specific and perfect stage directions and scenic designs even on a live stage, is finally within our grasp and instead of pursuing this goal.  And what we have are modern directors who use them as vehicles for their warped perception of theater and its purpose.

If anyone out there truly loves Parsifal and wishes to hear it at its best, try to get a hold of a CD of one of the live concert performances on period instruments which Thomas Hengelbrock conducted and performed in three European cities.  I have the one from Dortmund.  It is a revelation in every respect; easily the best Parsifal I ever heard.  The singers though not the best I've ever heard, are all excellent and committed and though it may seem hard to believe, Hengelbrook's conducting is superior to EVERYONE else, past or present. His tempos are exactly in line with those Wagner preferred and would have wanted.  If you read Cosima's diary, he was constantly railing against conductors, especially Richter, for not maintaining tempos and ""dragging the beat"" (""schleppend"" was the exact word he used)..  Even with more bracing tempos, he brings out a wealth of musical detail that has previously gone unnoticed.  Let me point out just one musical detail I've been waiting to hear for years and all previous conductor's have missed:  the deep brass notes two measures into the act II prelude which point out the thematic connection between the ""Klingsor"" motif and the minor key version of the ""Last Supper"" motive first heard at the beginning of the second half of the act I prelude.  The only times I ever heard these notes before was when I was playing through the prelude in the vocal score on the piano!",1397692800,40,3452,4.896907216494846
5740838,1,B00CU55HHY,"The only reason I bought this DVD was that it had two of my favorite singers, Rene Pape and Jonas Kaufman. I will continue to listen to this production; Im not wasting my eyesight on it ever again.
The actors sing the traditional verses describing the peaceful woodland and fields of flowers. In this post apocalyptic world trees and flowers no longer exist, shedding a new light on why the swan was so precious to the brethren. Apparently it was the last non-human life form left on the planet, making Parsifal an ecological villain of the first water.
Who were those women in black, Klingsors evil minions, widows of fallen knights, spiritual widows of the actors rhythmically nodding on plastic chairs?
In Forbidden Planet, Walter Pigeon played the death scene of Dr. Morbius with less histrionics than the long suffering Amfortas.
Anyone pretending to portray Kundry needs to study Eva Randovas performances, she never missed the mark.
The Flower Maidens may have been the worst assault to the psyche. Ive seen them portrayed as childishly silly and pathetically enslaved but they always retained at least a shred of humanity. Girard transforms them into frenetic automatons splashing about in that oh so original pool of blood. What was Girard thinking; was it supposed to have issued from Klingsor when he castrated himself or had Parsifal unfortunately visited the Flower Maidens at the wrong time of the month? Who besides Charley Manson or Jack the Ripper would have been tempted into that bloody bed?
Clearly the set designer overspent the budget on that movable pool of stage blood. There was nothing left for the costume designer to do but dumpster dive for cast offs that looked like something out of a1950s Sears and Roebuck catalog to cloth the cast.

5740842,5,B00CU55HHY,"I saw this production of ""Parsifal"" a year ago, and have been waiting for the DVD with high hopes. Those hopes have been met, especially in a breathtaking Act 2. The long suduction/rejection scenes between Kundry (Katarina Dalayman) and Parsifal (Jonas Kaufmann) are electric. It's Kaufmann at his very, very best. The two singers are helped greatly by the very fine orchestra conductor Daniele Gatti. The entire cast is first rate, Rene Pape is especially good as Gurnemanz. Watching the DVD tonight was one of best opera experiences of my life. There are two problems: the closing credits start to role just as Kaufmann comes out for his bows, followed by Gatti. It's discouraging after spend 4.5 hours with the two men. Also, the blood water in Act 2 is far more difficult is see than at the Met  -- understandable, but a shame.

5740843,5,B00CU55HHY,"It's so good to see this production coming out on DVD at last.  Here is a post-modern production that goes right to the heart of the work, without insulting the viewer by introducing some stupid Konzept that has nothing to do with the piece.

The entire earth is wounded and longing for redemption.  Even in Act 1, while Parsifal may lack understanding, he begins to show compassion.  His moment of enlightenment in the second act has some of the best singing imaginable.  In Act 3 when Parsifal is anointed, the little rill begins to run with water again, to show that the process of healing has begun.  At the end, when the wounds of the community begin to be resolved and the men and women move together, one of the women steps towards him too.  Surely the most satisfying ending ever.

What Girard understands is that this is not a Christian opera (despite the comment Pape makes in his interview) any more than it is a Buddhist work.  Wagner uses some strands of semi-Christian mythology and ritual, as well as strands of Buddhist thought via Schopenhauer, for his own dramatic purpose.

I thoroughly recommend this DVD to all lovers of Wagner.  The singing is uniformly excellent, and Kaufmann was born for this role.  (These comments are based on the HD showing in Australian cinemas.)

(April 2014)  Finally received the DVD, and it fulfilled every expectation.  This is the BEST Parsifal on DVD.",1394150400,36,1404,4.743801652892562

Everything in that performance is perfect: the singing of ALL performers is astounding. One would focus on Kaufmann but Pape, Mattei, Dalayman and Nikitin are just as good. The chorus really outdoes itself and so does the orchestra.
The simplicity of the production allows us to hear the richness of the music and the text. The cosmic effects that accompany (or one should say: `describe`) the transformation music are breathtaking.

5740845,5,B00CU55HHY,"Parsifal is my favorite opera, and perhaps one of my top favorite pieces of artwork created.  I first saw it performed when I was 15 years old and have loved Wagner ever since.

Truth be told, when I first saw production stills of this version, I was highly skeptical. I am quite a traditionalist by heart, suppose I don't get post-modernism (especially some of the latest stuff coming out of Bayreuth lately).  I attended a screening of this at my local movie theater, and was shocked!  It turned out to be one of my absolute favorite renderings of Parsifal.  I was so emotional I had to wipe away tears.  The cloud projections used as a backdrop, the vocal talent, and the music = all blended perfectly together.  Even though I wanted the knight in shining armor vision, I couldn't fault this staging at all.  Kaufmann is the perfect Parsifal, and Pape made the (sometimes tedious) role of Gurnemarz feel real and highly significant. Mattei's Amfortas is heartbreaking, I had tremendous amount of sympathy for the character here - something that surprised me, or I had overlooked in previous productions.

5740848,5,B00CU55HHY,"One of the most amazing performances I've experienced of my favorite opera. The production was stunning, the cast superb, caught up completely in the drama.

Gatti has the score firmly in hand and the orchestra responds splendidly through every measure. His nuanced, non-rushed reading glimmered in all the right places, the transformation music of the outer acts truly transforming, the pulse (and pace) in Act II's opening, dangerous sounding ... as it should be. The chorus, as ever, was superb, the multiple choir effects of the different levels of sound coming through incredibly across the theatre's sound system.

Rene Pape's Gurnamenz is one that stands alongside the very best, his face registering so many emotions it was almost unbearably beautiful at times. During the first Grail ceremony, with (finally) nothing to sing, every gesture, every movement felt genuine, his eyes and lips those of one daring to hope this young man was the ""one."" Pape's way with text remains a miracle and in the Good Friday scene, his utterance of ""Nun freut sich alle Kreatur"" took my breath away revealing a dignified rapture . . . a genuine rejoicing.

Kaufmann gives a performance capturing youthful casualness, then in Act II, opening up for ""Amfortas! Die Wunde!"" with a sound that filled with pain as he finally comprehends what his purpose must now be and ends that monologue. with a desperate cry: ""Erlser! Heiland! Herr der Huld! Wie bss ich Snder meine Schuld?"" The intensity he exhibited from this point on was tremendous.

Peter Mattei, a surprising choice for Amfortas - but ultimately a glorious one, giving one of the most riveting, painfully beautiful accounts of the role I've seen or heard.  His great narrative in Act I, heart wrenching.

Evgeny Nikitin is as spooky and commanding a Klingsor as one could hope for, literally dripping with blood, the malevolence both in voice and deed not only palpable but terrifying.

Katarina Dalayman clearly knows the essence of Kundry down to her toes and every nuance of the tortured woman (in this production around not only centuries, but millennia) making her redemption a stunning, coupe de theatre,

Francois Girard's production is a remarkable achievement, and along with Maestro Gatti and the company achieving a true realization of gesamtkunstwerk the likes of which we rarely see at this level. Even in this barren post-apocalyptic wasteland, there was a genuine, raw, beauty about it all. The choreographed movements of the Flower Maidens will is burned, forever in my mind. Unforgettable in every way. The score of Parsifal has my eyes moist, and a lump in my throat from the opening notes of the Vorspiel to the curtain's final fall and today's performance - visually and sonically was no exception.

Barbara Willis Sweet's work here could set the benchmark for ""how it should be done."" Few long, intrusive close-ups, and capturing the stage either in its entirety or in large portions.",1391644800,66,2952,5.05761316872428
