1966919,5,B00012FX4A,"Ever wake up the morning after a workout and you feel it all over? Not usually. I generally feel it in one place or another but not in every single muscle group in my body. Well, this DVD was an exception. I ache in places I didn't know I had muscles - and it's a GOOD ache. A feeling of accomplishment! The great thing about this program is the variety of exercises. These ladies somehow manage to give you an effective workout without making you do countless masochistic reps of the same exercise. Come on! Just 50 more! You can do it! Yeah, right... You are constantly switching positions and for almost every exercise there is a moderate version you can do that allows you to still benefit without hurting yourself or looking really silly trying to do something too advanced. This is one I will definitely stick with.",1089849600,27,821,4.516778523489933
1966920,5,B00012FX4A,"I have not been able to find an exercise DVD that made me want to do it again, until now.  I absolutely LOVE this DVD.
As a beginner, I know that I will be able to use this DVD for some time to come.  The reason I know this is because the two instructors give you a modified stance and an advanced stance.  I am still on the modified stance (for some, not all), which means I will advance with this DVD.
I am very pleased with the soreness I feel because I KNOW that I was working out.  I would strongly recommend this DVD to ANYONE interested in Pilates.",1088208000,27,555,4.0181818181818185
1966921,5,B00012FX4A,"I am an avid at-home workout fiend.  I think this video does exactly what it claims to--sculpts!!!!!  Note: You will need hand weights with this DVD.  Also,  it is not just pilates.  It starts with a lot of leg exercises(lunges) and it will really sculpt your entire body... abs, arms, shoulders, legs!!! A great purchase.",1087430400,12,322,4.781818181818182
1966922,5,B00012FX4A,"I really enjoyed this dvd.  It felt good, it was enjoyable to work out to and i would highly recommend it.  It isn't intense, however, you can up the intensity and/or use heavier weights.",1086048000,3,187,4.470588235294118
1966923,5,B00012FX4A,"Wow, this is certainly the most challenging workout I've ever done and it's exactly what I've been looking for.  This workout is a mix of cardio with weights & pilates.  If you're doing the cardio section, you'll probably want 5lb weights.  I tried it with 10lbs and found it to be a bit too much to start.  These ladies really know what they're doing.  No gimmicks whatsoever.  I'd say that if you do this 3-5 times a week and eat healthy meals, you'll have an amazing body in no time.  If you're looking to be challenged and get into top shape, buy this video.",1081382400,14,562,4.346153846153846
1966924,5,B00012FX4A,"I was eagerly anticipating the release of this DVD, I already own their Pilates Plus.  I was surprised by the format of the workout.  The first twenty-two minutes of the workout is a combination of arms sculpting exercises and squats,reminiscent of the firm videos.  The middle section of the exercise focuses on butt and leg strengthing exercises.  The last section is devoted to the abs and the chest.  This is a true total body workout, however I think the title is a little misleading.  If you are looking for pilates floor exercises and a separate arm sculpting section then I would recommend the Jennifer Kries perfect mix and precision pilates.  Jennifer Kries generally uses three-pound weights, while Tracey and Michelle use 5 pound weights throughout this workout.  Having said that, I think that this is a great workout.  I am an advanced exerciser, and I certainly felt this the day after!",1078790400,41,901,4.913907284768212
1966935,5,B00012FX4A,This is a replacement dvd for a tape so I was already familiar with the program. The shipment arrived promptly and product was as advertised. The actual workout dvd is very good.,1293926400,,178,4.59375
1966936,5,B00012FX4A,"I originally checked this out at my library and liked it so much I bought my own copy.  The best part of this dvd for me is how well the two women work together.  I really like the workout:  it has modifications to keep you challenged, and most of the exercises have a slight twist making them unique and more interesting to do.  It takes about 50 minutes to complete the  workout which doesn't bother me, but some people prefer shorter sessions.  All the major muscle groups are targeted, there's a lot of focus on finding and keeping your balance, and the instructors do not compete with each other or have annoying voices.",1270857600,,625,4.486725663716814
1966937,5,B00012FX4A,"I'm generally not a fan of Dozois and York, they have some bad DVDs out there, but this one surprised me. I also don't care for Pilates, it's just too boring and slow, so lucky for me, that this workout is a well-rounded, challenging and intersting strength routine with various weights. The ab section contains some Pilates-inspired moves, but nothing too goofy. I originally rented this workout, but like it so much that I'm buying it. Also, Tracy looks really good (buff and toned) in this workout which is inspiring.",1248048000,,520,4.788888888888889
1966938,5,B00012FX4A,"This is a great video. I started out with it after I had no worked out for 2 years, and could only do it without weights. I then icreased from 2 lb weights, and after 2 months am able to 5 lbs weights in each hand.

The instruction is clear, and it really gives you a good workout. Its one of the best videos I own.",1231459200,,315,3.772727272727273
1966939,5,B00012FX4A,I had back pain for 4 years before I found this video and the pain has compeleteley dissappared.  I think this is a great total body workout.  The nice thing is all you need is some light weights-even soup cans will work at first and a mat or towel.  The stretching and weights is really relaxing.  It has no complicated steps and they move from exercise to exercise often enough that you don't exhaust yourself.,1227312000,,412,4.453333333333333
1966940,5,B00012FX4A,"I purchased this DVD based on the other great reviews because I was looking for a sculpting/toning workout with weights, but also a some pilates. I really enjoy this DVD because the sculpting sections have different exercises than I'm used to. The workout is broken into several different sections, so you don't have to do it all at once if you're short on time. I especially like the abs section and the floor section with weights. I'd say this is geared more for an intermediate level because there is not a lot of specific instruction on exercise form. There are two instructors, and one shows the modified form of the exercise at all times, which is helpful. I recommend this to anyone who is looking to tone up and add some new exercies to their routine.",1191110400,,759,4.588235294117647
1966941,5,B00012FX4A,I couldn't say enough about this DVD.  It is a wonderful work out.  The instructors and easy to follow and not dorky.  My muscles really feel it for at least a day after I work out to this DVD.  I love it and you will to!,1174348800,,221,3.739130434782609
1966942,5,B00012FX4A,"This video is not only easy to follow, but a very effective workout.  I highly recommend this video to anyone looking to firm up quickly.",1167782400,3,137,4.48
1966943,5,B00012FX4A,"This is a great workout in that in combines weights with Pilates moves.  I really feel that I'm getting a full body workout in an efficient amount of time.  The moves are challenging and the instructors are very pleasant and informative.  Even though this workout is one of the older ones, don't doubt it's ability.  It's one of my favorites, and I own about 20 workout DVD's and end up pulling this one off the shelf about 30% of the time.",1163721600,3,440,4.395061728395062
1966944,5,B00012FX4A,"I really like this workout.  I really enjoy Pilates and have certainly seen the benefits of my regular Pilates workout; however, Pilates workouts do not often address the upper body so I find I have to do a separate workout for my arms.  I also like to use some weights.  This workout fits the bill:  I get Pilates, weights and upper body work.  I also like the instructors.  I am pretty much instructor driven - I really have to enjoy the instructor or I cannot get through the workout nor enjoy the journey.  They are friendly and helpful without being over the top.  My other favorite instructors are Ellen Barrett and Katalin Rodriguez Kamiar.",1158192000,10,647,4.614035087719298
1966955,4,B00012FX4A,"First a disclaimer--this isn't strictly pilates it's more a fusion workout of weights and some pilates moves.  I don't see how you could get bulky doing this workout as you start off with 3-5 pound dumbells.  I know a female bodybuilder and you would have to lift alot more than this :)

I get sick of regular weight workouts but I love this one.  I didn't feel like it was that taxing when I did it...but God I was sore the next day.  I think it's good for advanced beginners or intermediates.  Great if you know you should add weight but don't really like them.",1142380800,5,563,4.314285714285714
1966956,5,B00012FX4A,"I really like the instructors, and the routine is not as hard as I thought initially.  Of course I was a little sore the first couple of times, but now I am comfortable with it even if I still can't do the advanced moves. This is not for the pilates beginner.  You really need to know the basics. The warm up is a really nice way of getting your heart pumping, and the floor routine works your entire body.  Both Michelle and Tracy are great together, and I don't think you will get bulky with the weights as other reviewers mentioned.  In my opinion, the video delivers everything it promises!",1141948800,2,594,4.372727272727273
1966957,5,B00012FX4A,"This workout has a warm-up then 11 minutes of standing toning with weights.  It's squats, lunges and plies with shoulder raises and bicep curls.  There's a short stretch and then it's yoga push-ups and then 30 minutes of pilates inspired exercises with weights.  The first section makes a great add-on after walking or running.  I use 5 lb. weights during both sections and feel this is a very effective workout.",1128297600,4,412,4.8428571428571425
1966958,5,B00012FX4A,"I purchased this DVD at the very end of my first pregnancy longing to get back in shape after I had my baby.  I found this to be an excellent workout and even though my son is over a year now I am still doing it consistently.  In the past I have gotten bored with the same workout DVD but not this one.  I combined this with a cardiovascular exercise and definitely noticed the results.  I also feel great after I do this. I have seen many printouts of good exercises to do after you have had a baby and this DVD incorporates all of those as well as teaching balance and coordination.  I feel much more balanced and in shape than I have since I got married.

The other thing I enjoy very much about this DVD is that the instructors are down to earth and do not fill time with needless chatter.  I get very annoyed at flighty or silly instructors and very tired of hearing their jokes over and over but this one is not like that at all.  They are both very down to earth and explain the exercises so you not only know how to do them but why you are doing them.

I would definitely recommend this to anyone but especially women who want to get their shape back after having a baby.",1127952000,8,1179,4.11353711790393
1966959,5,B00012FX4A,"This was a very challenging and varied workout. You get cardio, strength training and pilates. The instructors are wonderful and motivating and the workout is such a nice change of pace. A great addition to a workout dvd rotation.",1123891200,3,230,4.923076923076923
1966960,1,B00012FX4A,"If you want to build muscles, this is the DVD for you. I was hoping for some stretching and relaxation as well as pilates, so I was disappointed. I gave this DVD away almost as soon as I got it because I don't want big bulky muscles like the ladies in the video have. Most of the video is not even pilates.",1115596800,3,306,3.9516129032258065
1966961,5,B00012FX4A,"Michelle Dozois and Tracy York give you a helpful workout that feels good inside and out. Unlike other trainers/instructors, they know how to keep you moving with encouraging words that don't sound so scripted. This is definitely worth getting. I haven't gotten sick of continuously re-using the DVD for my workouts.",1111536000,4,316,5.215686274509804
1966962,4,B00012FX4A,"I run, lift weights and do an hour of Bryan Kest's power yoga several times a week, but I am always on the lookout for something new to incorporate into my routine - this tape is definately it!!  It does require good balance, and it moves faster than I am used to, but I like that because I am being challenged.  The weights are awesome - together with the aerobic/pilates aspects of the video you are sure to get a total body workout that leaves you sore all over.  I did the video yesterday morning and this morning I am sore and I feel great.  I highly recommend this video.  I do think that you should at least be intermediate/expirienced in either pilates, weights, yoga, etc. so that you can master quickly one aspect of the video. and then the other parts will be easier to learn.  I would not recommend this to a total beginner.",1106611200,9,836,4.326923076923077
1966963,3,B00012FX4A,"I liked this video.  It did tend to move rather quickly for a begginner like myself who also has no balance.  The instructors were really great at motivating you, though at times I felt they moved a little to fast.  The pilates moves were not easy and required a great deal of concentration and I had a hard time keeping up at some points.  This video has a lot more body sculpting with free weights than it does pilates.  I will be checking out a begginers pilates video next time.",1098748800,8,482,4.311111111111111
1966964,4,B00012FX4A,"Although the moves in the video are good and do result in strengthening, many of the exercises aren't repeated often enough to be very effective. Although some are (squats and inner thighs, for example), I actually started to notice how quickly some exercises were rushed through. This is ok, though - you can simply pause the video and do a few more reps before continuing on.

I had been hoping that this would be an equal mix of pilates and sculpting, but the focus was definitely on weights, with a few pilates moves, and adjustments that focus mainly on improving balance. Importantly, I was sweating like crazy and my muscles were fatigued when I was done - I looked like I'd just stepped out of the shower! Good enough to recommend and use often, but I'll be buying a simple pilates video to give me the core strength exercises I was hoping for. I'll also be keeping my remote control handy to pause and do additional repetitions.",1094774400,15,937,4.610778443113772
8005510,5,B00012FX4A,This is an oldie but a classic since it never ceases to challenge you and provide results. I've done this video at home off and on for over 10 years and always enjoy the exercises and improving on the techniques as I get stronger. Strengthens core and you will notice results within a few weeks. The dialogue could get a little boring if done daily so I tend to mute it and blast my own music.,1451520000,,393,4.184210526315789
8005511,5,B00012FX4A,"This is a great workout and you will see results fast. The weights have really helped to sculpt my arms and chest faster than their Breakthru Pilates DVD. It works your buns, abs, thighs, arms, back- it's pretty ""easy"" while you're doing it, but you definitely notice the results. It was very challenging in the beginning, but after about a week I was able to do most of the exercises with light weights in the beginner poses. (I'm 40 years old and 125 pounds and I don't exercise as much as I should, but I'm slim.) The more I do this workout the more challenge I'm able to add so I can see myself sticking with this DVD for a long time.

The music and instructors are calm and they're not real polished and hyper like some DVDs. My husband has started doing it with me and says it's a good workout and he's a runner and P90x-er. It doesn't have a lot of cardio so it might not be the best all around workout, but it's now my go to when I feel like toning and working up a sweat 4-5 times a week.",1404000000,,997,4.112820512820512
8005512,5,B00012FX4A,"I love this workout. It mixes yoga and weight lifting in 1 hour. It's not too hard, but it sure isn't easy and makes me sweat. 2 good teachers motivate you and the reps are just high enough to do all of them without thinking you can't finish it (well, you may have to work up to it, but it's doable!). Great exercises for a full body workout.",1380499200,,342,4.044117647058823
8005513,5,B00012FX4A,"This is the least annoying of the Pilates videos I have tried.  Good workout, modifications available if you aren't in awesome shape.",1379462400,,133,5.045454545454546
8005514,4,B00012FX4A,"I like this video, but was disappointed that I paid a higher price than was attached to the box.  Someone had covered the original price over with a sticker.  I thought that was deceptive.",1366934400,,188,4.5
8005515,4,B00012FX4A,"A good workout, zero cardio - all toning & pilates & weights. I used 3 lbs, I will use 5 lbs next time. A few moves with ab & floor work that I never seen! Not extremely hard but good core & balance work. Covers all upper & lower body. I'm new to pilates so it was good for me!",1342051200,,277,3.6333333333333333
8005516,5,B00012FX4A,"This was one of the first videos I borrowed from the library when I got interested in Pilates, my first was Pilates weight-loss workout for Dummies.  I love love love that the workout uses weights and it is very easy to use after mastering the basic techniques of Pilates in a very short time.  It's been a year since I have found this, I was able to do most of it for two trimesters while being pregnant with my third child (I switched to prenatal Pilates for the third trimester.  I am in the best post-pregnancy shape ever!",1339200000,,526,4.346938775510204
8005517,5,B00012FX4A,"This DVD is an excellent workout for both men and women, from beginners to advanced exercisers.  I've been doing it for years, adding my own slight modifications (flyes on a stability ball, rather than on the floor; heavier weights, added ankle weights), and it still does the trick.  I particularly like what it does for my flexibility and core strength, and was pleasantly surprised, when I first got it, to discover that it's got quite an aerobic component to it as well.  The one-legged exercises are fantastic for improving one's balance.  All in all, a very thorough and effective workout.  It helped me lose 40 lbs.!",1338854400,2,623,4.839622641509434
8005518,5,B00012FX4A,"This is my second copy of this DVD. Sadly my first copy froze up. I'm not sure why that happened especially given the gentle, 2-3 times per month use.  For that reason, I would rate the DVD only 2-3 stars. The workout, however, I would rate 5 stars. The routine is easy to follow.  As Tracy and Michelle say, ""tough but doable"". You can do the workout with or without weights. The Pilates moves are peppered throughout.  Be forwarned, this is a sculpting DVD and that seems to be the emphasis.  They incorporate lots of lunges so keep that in mind if you have bad knees. We like mixing this workout in with our more traditional Pilates workout DVDs.",1329696000,,649,4.428571428571429
8005519,5,B00012FX4A,"I checked out Breakthru-Pilates Sculpt from the library and tried it at home first. Then I bought it online and was very pleased with the product I received. I'm 57, and those young ladies instructions are easy to follow, and since you have it on dvd you can always watch and listen to it again. Yes, their method is preparing me for life's adventure! I recommend this exercise video for those who want a thorough and concise workout that's a good foundation for all their other physical activities. Thanks!",1311033600,,507,4.707865168539326
