8078715,2,B000AL7BEC,"This 1964 movie, directed by Russ Meyer, would get a PG rating today, since there's no nudity or profanity.  Filmed in Berlin, this black-and-white film is set in 18th century London.  Fanny Hill is played by Letcia Romn.  She is very pretty, but doesn't measure up to the super-stacked women who usually appear in Russ Meyer movies.  Young, nave, and penniless, Fanny fortunately finds work as a chambermaid in a bordello, run by the madam Mrs. Brown (Miriam Hopkins).  Of course, Fanny doesn't realize that the place is a bordello.  Later in the movie, she meets Charles (Ulli Lommel), who is also a virgin.  The two fall in love and, after a series of mishaps, end up getting married at the end of the movie.  Russ Meyer is out of his element in this costume comedy, which includes slapstick humor, silly music, and overacting.",1405468800,,830,4.715277777777778
