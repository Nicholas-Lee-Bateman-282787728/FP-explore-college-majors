3048126,5,B00106TXAQ,"Cowboy Legends 50 Movie Pack

This product has twelve double-sided DVDs containing fifty movies from the 1930s and 1940s, the prime era for traditional Westerns. There is a wide range of actors in this set, many now long forgotten. About one-third star Roy Rogers, a popular actor who played in a wide range of stories. Four feature Gene Autry, the best singing cowboy in those times. Other films star: Harry Carey Sr., Johnny Mack Brown, Buster Crabbe, Hoot Gibson, Ken Maynard, Buck Jones, Tim McCoy, Tex Ritter, Bob Steele, Randolph Scott, etc.

Most stories are concerned with saving a small ranch or business from economic disaster. Big landowners, or robbers, threaten these small businesses. This must echo the fears of the small movie producers who were threatened by the big studios and their control of movie theater chains. These movies from the late 1930s often had music and singing as part of the story (""horse operas""). There was a limited amount of gunfire. The usual story showed the hero saving the ranch or farm, and getting rewarded by a grateful young woman. It was like those older stories where a young man performs a task successfully then winds up marrying his employer's daughter. Other stories has the stars working undercover, as US Marshals or Texas Rangers to neutralize various criminal gangs, like the private detective stories that were also popular. In the 19th century the many Committees of Vigilance and Regulators controlled crime and protected people. This was not shown because of the political implications of a volunteer militia as a police force.

Most of these films are set in modern times where they have automobiles, telephones, radio, etc. This provides more realism to the audience. The right to keep and bear arms was well-recognized when these films were made. These classic westerns began to decline in the 1940s when stories became concerned with personal conflicts rather than economic troubles. Horses became scarcer after the end of WW II when tractors replaced horses. Increasing costs harmed the low-budget movie studios. The decline in movie audiences matched a vast increase in television viewing. ""Shane"" was one of the last movies where small farmers and ranchers were threatened by a big landowner's greed for their lands. [""The Banditti of the Plains"" provides an historical example from the 1890s.] ""High Noon"" was an example of the new style of personal conflicts driving the story.

This might be true but to me there is nothing better on a rainy afternoon than to sit down, slip into a world of fantasy, and watch the old classic westerns with such acclaimed heros of the '30s and'40s as Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, Buck Jones, Tim Holt, Johnny Mack Brown (and the list goes on and on). And how can one forget to mention the comedy in these movies provided by the likes of Gabby Hayes and Smiley Burnett
These Amazon collections have it all and I would recommend them to all old film buffs.

3048133,5,B00106TXAQ,"Anyone who likes western movies from the 1930s and 1940s will want this set.  It has a little bit of everything from what was known as the ""B"" list that theater managers were given.  The famous movies of the genre just aren't here.  But no matter.  Gene Autry, Roy Rogers, Tex Ritter, et al. are still a rootin' and a shootin'.

Of special note is the movie ""Rawhide,"" released in 1938 and starring Lou Gehrig of the New York Yankees in his only movie.  He became ill shortly after that with the disease named for him and was gone from this earth before he could make another movie.  His performance is a lot better than one might expect--better, certainly, than most other sports figures who made movies, including Babe Ruth and Red Grange.  Gehrig plays himself, thinking to retire from baseball and move to the quiet of a western ranch with his sister.  But he is confronted by a whole passle of bad guys who are running a protection racket for ranchers.  Gehrig's sister is the usual movie blond, and she falls in love with a singing cowboy lawyer--yes indeedy.  But I don't want to ruin this for you.  It's just fun, even if it is silly.

The transfers are probably as good as one can expect from those old black and white movies.  Who thought, in 1938, that anyone would be watching them 70 years later?",1202342400,11,1309,4.468354430379747

3282628,4,B00106TXAQ,"The British playwrite and wit, Katherine Whitehorn once said ""I wouldn't say when you've seen one western you've seen the lot; but when you've seen the lot you get the feeling you've seen one.""
This might be true but to me there is nothing better on a rainy afternoon than to sit down, slip into a world of fantasy, and watch the old classic westerns with such acclaimed heros of the '30s and'40s as Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, Buck Jones, Tim Holt, Johnny Mack Brown (and the list goes on and on). And how can one forget to mention the comedy in these movies provided by the likes of Gabby Hayes and Smiley Burnett
These Amazon collections have it all and I would recommend them to all old film buffs.

3282630,5,B00106TXAQ,"Anyone who likes western movies from the 1930s and 1940s will want this set.  It has a little bit of everything from what was known as the ""B"" list that theater managers were given.  The famous movies of the genre just aren't here.  But no matter.  Gene Autry, Roy Rogers, Tex Ritter, et al. are still a rootin' and a shootin'.

Of special note is the movie ""Rawhide,"" released in 1938 and starring Lou Gehrig of the New York Yankees in his only movie.  He became ill shortly after that with the disease named for him and was gone from this earth before he could make another movie.  His performance is a lot better than one might expect--better, certainly, than most other sports figures who made movies, including Babe Ruth and Red Grange.  Gehrig plays himself, thinking to retire from baseball and move to the quiet of a western ranch with his sister.  But he is confronted by a whole passle of bad guys who are running a protection racket for ranchers.  Gehrig's sister is the usual movie blond, and she falls in love with a singing cowboy lawyer--yes indeedy.  But I don't want to ruin this for you.  It's just fun, even if it is silly.

The transfers are probably as good as one can expect from those old black and white movies.  Who thought, in 1938, that anyone would be watching them 70 years later?",1202342400,11,1309,4.468354430379747
