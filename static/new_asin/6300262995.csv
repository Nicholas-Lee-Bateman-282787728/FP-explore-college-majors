7807766,5,6300262995,If you like Samurai swords and Samurai warriors you will like this movie.  I like the plot where a Samurai warrior is revived in Los Angeles and makes sushi out of street gang punks especially when one loses his hand with a chain still in it. The movie is kind a science fiction sword porn flick but I really liked and found it entertaining.,1436745600,,341,4.328125

7807770,5,6300262995,"Most People don't even know what ""Samurai"" means. Most people think's it means ""Warrior or Fighter"",but what it truly means ""To Serve"". It's mostly to their Lords & Masters and in some cases there own families. In this story he is fighting for his wife and he is outnumber and is shot 4 times by arrows, he falls into ""Freezing"" water that when he is found 500 years later still frozen & the fact that he was frozen so quickly by the water he became preserved and he was able to bring him back to life. He is a ""Ghost from the past"". If you like what I wrote, watch the movie you will not be sorry.",1342656000,2,598,4.119658119658119
7807771,4,6300262995,"Ghost Warrior is one of those movies I purchased expecting it to be absolutely dreadful, and comedic for that reason. It had all the signs of being a terrible movie. Proudly emblazoned on the video case is ""By the makers of Troll."" That alone makes it look awful. The plot synopsis cements this belief. It's about a Samurai from the 1500s who runs amok in 1980s California.

Astonishingly enough, the movie is very good. Sure, there's a whole buttload of suspension of disbelief, but the acting is strong, especially on the part of Hiroshi Fujioka. Watching him makes it easy to suspend disbelief. He is very skilled with his weapons, and his demeanor is redolent with bushido. I'd like to watch more of his films, even though they look uniformly awful. Maybe he's the Japanese version of Rutger Hauer--a good actor with undiscriminating taste when it comes to acting gigs.",1102896000,8,873,4.82
7807772,3,6300262995,"A samurai rescues a lady, but in the process, is stabbed and thrown into freezing water when he fails to kill a defeated foe. He is frozen until the 20th century, when he is thawed out by scientists. He winds up in modern-day Los Angeles with a young and beautiful female expert in Japanese culture. There are the expected ""fish-out-of-water"" scenarios, and a few more interesting ones, such as the sushi chef who tries to speak with him and says he speaks with a strange dialect, and must be nuts. conflits of interest regarding the samurai bring the story to a climax where he is forced to make a similar choice as he had in the past.
The technical production quality is not first-rate, as if this was done on a low budget with low-end equipment. But the sincerity of the production comes through and makes the film surprisingly watchable.",1088208000,7,841,4.613333333333333
