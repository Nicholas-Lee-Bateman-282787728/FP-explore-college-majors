7948068,5,B00005O077,"I  enjoyed the performance of Actor Stephen Sorrentino.
 A great range in an amazing face.  I have seen him in other films but this is my fav!
 So the film itself lacks at bit of direction,  it's worth seeing Crisp & Sorrentino on this mad cap film.",1494374400,,249,4.212765957446808

7948070,1,B00005O077,I bought it cuz Quentin Crisp was in it.  The rest of it is boring and makes no sense to me.  Maybe more for someone else?,1411689600,,122,3.6538461538461537
7948071,2,B00005O077,"bad lighting, disjointed, too many close-ups of peoples pores.  I don't really know why this was created or released.  Would have better to shelve and make it mysterious.  The lighting is really what makes it hard to watch.  One never has a reference point because you don't know if they are in diner, an apartment, a club, a bar, etc.  you can only see the 2 people yelling at each other.  everyone is talking loudly in an affected tone.  gets old real quick.",1390435200,,460,4.469879518072289
7948072,4,B00005O077,This movie is fantastic. More people should watch it. It has some of the best lines of any gay-themed movies you'll ever watch.,1382054400,,127,4.565217391304348
7948073,4,B00005O077,"I don't understand the terrible reviews. You don't watch something like this and expect Citizen Kane. For a no-budget film that was dressed from a drag queen's rent controlled flat, it is really very good. And I cherish every moment of Quentin Crisp on the screen. I would be entranced just watching him read the phone book. And I would much rather watch this than any of the hundreds of insipid, coming out films that have flooded the market in recent years. Films like this remind us that queer culture had it's genesis in the underground, where it grew into a rare and fabulous flower. It seems now that everyone wants to get married, adopt babies, and live tastefully in the suburbs. It's like they're saying, ""You can accept us now. We're just like straight people."" Well, I'd rather be, as Quentin said, in the gutter but looking at the stars. Great film.",1285804800,5,861,4.633986928104576
7948074,1,B00005O077,"This just may be one of the worst gay themed movies I have ever seen and I make it my practice to see as many as are avialable. The film is a completely disjointed, confusing mess. The only saving grace is the presence of Lea DeLaria. Ms DeLaria makes no false moves...ever. She has a natural talent and the camera loves her. DeLaria has the remarkable ability to make the[...] crap she is given to act here seem like the sweetest perfume.
Rent, do not buy this movie, if you have to see it.",1036195200,4,491,4.23404255319149
7948075,2,B00005O077,"""Homo Heights"" revolves around an older man named Malcolm (played by Quentin Crisp), who is somewhat of an idol to the gay community in town. Malcolm desperately wants to leave said town, but the gay-mafia boss, a drag-queen named Maria Callous, needs Malcolm in town to keep her power. The movie, then, is more or less Malcolm's friend's trying to outwit Callous and help Malcolm escape.
Simple plot. This movie is really just a vehicle for campy jokes and situations. And while it works sometime, most of the time we're confused.
For instance, Quentin Crisp is a captivating character. His collection of Hollywood memorabilia is too funny-- including Charleton Heston's codpiece.
But while other characters have some great moments, and the script references some movies and people that are hilarious in their obscurity (Astrud Gilberto, anyone?)-- most of the movie is muddled and confused. There are so many side plots in this movie it takes until about 3/4 into the film that you actually understand where everyone stands. Lea DeLaria, especially, gets caught up in some bad film making that will have the viewer simply asking, ""what?"" There are times when I was so confused that I contemplated just turning it off. It would have been much easier than trying to figure out what was supposed to be happening.
Some people I was talking to praised the campy humor of this film. Indeed, some of the jokes are very good-- and very smart. But it takes more than good jokes to make a movie. The film reads as a mound of good jokes that don't always fit together.
My advice to the filmmaker-- find a stronger script to carry your witty jokes. My advice to the viewer-- get ""Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss"" instead. It has lots of the camp-- but it balances that with a much more understandable plot.",1021680000,3,1794,4.809061488673139
