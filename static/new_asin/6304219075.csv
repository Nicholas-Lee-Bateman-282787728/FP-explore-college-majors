7865044,1,6304219075,The only reason watching this film is the presence of Jennifer Tilly. This Bulgarian mess is full of bad dialogue in the style of Glen or Glenda and Andy Warhol's Dracula. The sex scenes are rather sleazy in a funny way but that doesn't save the film. It's hard to think this film was made to be serious. Just for fans of Tilly.,970704000,5,328,4.222222222222222
