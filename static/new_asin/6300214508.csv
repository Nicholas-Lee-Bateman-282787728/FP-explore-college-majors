You wouldn't think that this story had anything to do w/ Ancient Egypt, would you? It's a new way to look at  Sherlock Holmes, and has some good special effects. Don't expect Jurassic  Park quality ones, but it's not Jason & The Argonauts.(check out the  stained-glass window scene)  It's become one of my faves as well as my  mom's, and I recommend anyone who enjoys a good action/adventure movie will  like this!",947808000,,526,4.542553191489362
229625,4,6300214508,"about 15 years ago, I've watched this movie in the theater. It was amazing! I even thought there was possiblitites that Doyle wrote this story. Most of Holmes stories which by non-Doyle are awful, actually - look  LeBlanc, even good writer like him spolied Holmes just for his gentle thief  Rupin. But Chris Columbus made perfect Holmes and Watson. That's really I  love this movie even now. Doyle's characters have humors - specially  Watson. He is lovely, he has loyalty. The only one shortage is, the  director didn't recognize the humors - Barry Levinson actually serious  director, so he couldn't understand a whole of script, I think. That makes  sometimes 'a little bit of awkwardness' - look Watson's illusion. It's  fnny, but not funny as we expected. only one my wish is - I want to get  this movie's original music score CD. Some score is come from classical  score, but music is also good.",945907200,,901,4.754838709677419

Everything has a purpose. The heroes are witty, the villains are mysterious and ruthless, and the sets look spectacular. Also, the similarities to Harry Potter are staggering. Keep in mind though that this came out a full 12 years before The Philosopher's Stone was released in the UK (Young Sherlock in 1985, Potter in 1997).

229841,5,6300214508,"This movie probably one of the most underrated movies of the 80's.  It had some of the real first computer generated animation (the knight).  Plus a really really good post credit scene that shows the ""birth"" of Moriarty.  If you have seen Harry Potter, it is easy to see where it takes a lot of cues from Young Sherlock Holmes.  Definitely worth a look.  Unfortunately, this is the 5th DVD of this movie I have had to buy.  Probably, should quit watching it so much.",1461888000,,467,4.435294117647059

You'd never guess from this movie that they had any acting talent at all.  Oh man, were they terrible in this film.  c) Only redeeming feature: the terror of the pastries.  But that was the only scene in the entire movie worth watching.  It's one minute long.  Find it on youtube and save 108 minutes of your life by ignoring the rest.

There are eight million stories in the naked city.  A good many of them are about Sherlock Holmes and Watson, and have been made into movies.  Watch _any_ of the other Sherlock Holmes films and be greatly entertained.  Skip this one.",1453507200,,820,4.489795918367347

Picture was pretty good and sound was above average. Acting ranged from good to only fair - I thought the actor who player Watson was only ok. Plot needed some work and not sure why they killed off the female lead. The DVD arrived quickly but there was a 'glitch' toward the end - the picture kept freezing up. I used this in 3 different DVD players and it happened at the same spot in all of them. The disc didn't appear damaged so there must have been a problem when it was manufactured.

Chris Columbus provides the clunky exposition that advances the plot from the repainted sets from Temple of Doom to the flying with ET redone as flying with a chubby Watson, to the Nepalese, er, Egyptian bar where secrets are revealed. Oh, there's also a flashback to the hero's daddy issues. But you knew that already.

I was skeptical when I started to play the movie. My kids ages 8, 10, & 11 were asking where's Robert Downey Jr? I was like he is  not in this movie. Then they mentioned that  various scenery reminded them of Harry Potter. I told them this movie came way before Harry Potter. To say the least they were intrigued and entertained. They want to watch it again and I thinks it's one of their favorites now. It's not everyday that my kids and I  enjoy the same movie.

Watson, as SH's room mate is just what you would have expected when you remember the original Dr. Watson actor.

Direction is ok but nothing stellar.

Production values are modest and where they attempt to go-grand they don't quite meet the goal.

For introducing a younger crowd to the historical sleuth this is by far and away the best film that is out there.

A series of deaths occur early on and we the audience are aware of how it is happening but the town and the local detective think it is all just accidental.  Sherlock realizes there is something amist when a death occurs closer to home and he announces that ""The Game is a foot!"".  Steven Spielberg produced this movie and his influence is very apparent.  There is a disclaimer that points out that Holmes and Watson in the book really meet much later in life but with that said the movie is still Fun and believable should the two have met early on.",1412121600,,712,4.396946564885496

232167,1,6300214508,"This is weird mixture of varied movie themes in one confused and sad movie.
The genius of the true SACD Holmes and several of the independent off-shoots is that the resolution of the mysteries requires astute deduction and the answer revealed may be improbable, but is not impossible. Many plot elements here are impossible.
The professor's plane comes straight from ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" (released seventeen years previously), although here the plane is pedal-powered, not a magical engine-powered car/plane. The professor's plane could not possibly fly, or even do more than an almost-vertical glide. Sustained human-powered flight requires a very large and very light plane (see the Gossamer Condor).
A lot of the swashbuckling, torch-lit scenes, mysterious ancient religions, and even the sword fights come right out ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" released four years previously.
The several hallucinogenic experiences come from Steven King's movies -- five had been released prior to this one. The horrifying aspects of the hallucinogenic experiences, not to mention the ritual killings of young teen girls, make this movie unacceptable for younger audiences, who otherwise might enjoy the magical boarding school and crime-solving adventures.
The movie precedes the boarding-school antics of the Harry Potter series -- Holmes even ""magically"" (through chemistry) transforms one of his student rivals, but this is not developed.
Impossibilities? Just for fun, young Holmes deduces the location of an eight-inch figurine hidden somewhere in a huge building within a one-hour time limit. The youthful Holmes knows that a certain candle wax is only sold in one London shop. A huge Egyptian pyramid/ worship center, complete with many converted devoted followers of an ancient Egyptian religion, is secretly built in downtown London. Not to mention, of course, that ancient Egyptians did not worship inside pyramids.
Wild improbabilities? Ancient sect has a ""hit list"" of several Englishmen, who are killed by a mysterious cowled figure using an ancient Egyptian blowgun, shooting darts tipped with a hallucinogen guaranteed to produce hallucinations which will result in the victims fleeing so rapidly that they will be killed in the process of fleeing. If you want to kill someone, just kill them -- the victims, after all, are mainly older men wandering the dark streets of London at night.
Character development? There is none. A few characters have a secret identity -- not needed in the context of the story -- but the dumb remain dumb, the wise remain wise, the good are always good and the bad are always bad.
This is a movie definitely worth staying away from!!!",1411862400,,2672,5.319148936170213

232600,5,6300214508,"This movie has all the great elements, which made a wonderful movie.  The original team of producers of Amblin Entertainment (Spielberg, Marshall and Kennedy) together with Industrial Light & Magic; I would venture to write produced eight out of ten money making productions.  Unfortunately this movie for all age groups of theatrical attending movie payers, was one of the two out of ten that did not make enough money to warrant a sequel.

Director Barry Levinson was given enough money (18 million dollars) and the wonderful studio facilities, Thorn EMI Elstree Studios, Hertfordshire, England.  Levinson and his team presented us a marvelous (yes dark) Victorian setting for Young Sherlock Holmes.  The team gave us humors scenes, which are not typical for a Sherlock Holmes movie production.  The Production Design, Art Direction, Set Decoration, Costume Design and Makeup Design were all spot on for entertaining the younger audience and us adult paying audience members.

The special production values, special effects if you will, which were used in 1984-85 still make me, as an older movie fan, wonder how the Industrial Light & Magic team got their computers to create the magic they achieved.  There was not one actor in this production which was miscast and did not make me believe the character they were portraying.

So the question remains. Why did this movie only make twenty percent of the cost to make it?  Did Paramount choose the wrong time to release the movie; during the Christmas season?.  Did Paramount not do a great job of promoting the release of the movie?  Did parents think it was too dark for their children to see during the Christmas season?  A better question would be, what other movies did Young Sherlock Holmes compete against for the almighty Christmas dollar?  This writer is not going to Google what movies, were release during the 1985 Christmas season.  There may have been a couple of movies that made the all mighty 100 million dollar weekend gross.

There is one thing I know, this is a movie I watch at least once a year.  Why do I do this?  I am a Sherlock Holmes fan.  I own all of the written works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, abridged and unabridged forms.  The powers of deduction are so fanciful they bridge the adolescent mind to the adult mind to entertain us in written form or in movie form.  It is unfortunate theatrical audiences did not get to see what the great production team could have given us with Young Men; Holmes and Watson vs. Professor James Moriarty.

Ultimately, there is no account for ones taste of beauty or art.",1410480000,,2587,4.831818181818182

232726,2,6300214508,"He's called Sherlock Holmes, but in reality he is a vapid Indiana Jones living in Victorian London.

People who are fans of the Sherlock Holmes character, and the clever mystery-solving, plot-twisting adventures of Holmes and Watson will be disappointed. Precious little cleverness lives in this movie.

Fans of the Indiana Jones genre will be disappointed, too: the character introduction and development, fight, and  chase scenes are sub-standard [terrible, poorly done, badly staged sword fight scene at the end, for example]. The bad guys are dull, the events that drive the plot are uninteresting, and the good guys are not played by actors capably of carrying the movie.

That having been said; movie buffs, or nerds,  may enjoy how many of the scenes remind them of the way similar scenes were shot in the Indiana Jones series: ex., the scene when a character is flying/driving/riding by and all of the spectators rush to windows, etc. to watch while the camera pans by the backs of their heads.  An ""oh, yeah, where have I seen that before?"" moment. There are plenty of those in ""Young Sherlock Holmes"".

232954,5,6300214508,"Refuting the A Conan Doyle premise that Holmes and Watson first met as adults, this film has them becoming acquainted as students at a school to which young Watson has just transferred because his own has closed for lack of funds. Holmes immediately astounds the younger student with facts about him he's inferred from observation and Watson is hooked. When Holmes is expelled through the machinations of a rival and his mentor, an eccentric steampunk-inventing professor dies under mysterious circumstances, Holmes ties it to the just as odd deaths of two other citizens. Because the police, in the form of a younger Lestrade, won't investigate, he, Watson, and his mentor's niece (yes, in this one Holmes has a girlfriend) take it upon themselves to solve the crime.

Punctuated with the sayings easily recognizable and ascribed to Holmes (""The game is afoot"" ""Elementary""), the rest leads into explaining the development of the character of the Great Detective as he is later depicted in Doyle's stories.

This is a fun, entertaining movie. At first glance, it may seem designed for children but soon evolves into a very adult story.  Holmes is much more :""human"" here, a youngster in his late teens who wants to get as romantically involved with his mentor's' niece as would be allowed during Victorian times, while still being the observant perfectionist. He's good at everything he does, except the one thing which is undoubtedly the turning point in his life. (No spoiler.) There aren't many special effects but I understand this was one of, if not the first, to use CGI so perhaps that's the reason...if they didn't work, their sparse use wouldn't spoil the rest of the movie. The story, especially the ending shown after the credits, opens possibilities for a sequel though one was never done. Too bad. With another good script, these same characters might've developed into a series.  It's an enjoyable Harry Potter-like, steampunkish tale geared toward children (after all it IS a Disney film) but walking a fine line where adult can enjoy it also.",1405036800,,2059,5.011695906432749

233099,4,6300214508,"For most of us stuffy Holmesians, this movie will never amount to much more than an ""alternate universe"" reworking of the first meeting between the doctor and detective, and yet, there is not a single adaptation that can claim it is anything other than another writer's revitalization of our much beloved characters. When one considers the liberties taken with Holmes & Watson of late, any deviations here are tame by comparison. This was written with the utmost respect for the source material, and not by someone attempting to outdo Doyle, so in that regard, I view it as a deserving film pastiche.

The main divergence from the cold, occasionally misogynistic reasoner of Canon was the insertion of a love interest. I am not particularly enthusiastic about adding romantic elements, though if it had to be done, this was the way to go about it. Elisabeth, the niece of an eccentric inventor, Professor Waxflatter (portrayed, incidentally, by Nigel Stock, who may be remembered as Dr Watson beside both Douglas Wilmer/Peter Cushing in the 1960s BBC series), exudes such a radiance, and is an immensely likeable, competent female lead with absolutely nothing of the dreaded Mary-Sue about her.

In fact, Elisabeth becomes less of a distraction to a good Holmes/Watson adventure, and more of a vital addition. What little we do see of the romance, however, quickly takes a back seat to the plot. And an enjoyable one it is, with secret Egyptian societies, a killer who strikes using a dart gun whose poison drives the victim to madness - very reminiscent of the era in general, with elements straight out of SIGN and DEVI.

Overall,I was not bothered much by the alterations. Holmes retains his cleverness - as evidenced by some fairly good deductions - and Watson, his heart. In no way whatsoever did it seek to ""reinvent"" Holmes, so much of his character was recognizable enough. The sets and costumes were absolutely glorious, being richly evocative of the mid-Victorian era, making this movie an extremely underrated serious, if slightly darker, period piece. Young Sherlock Holmes may not rank up there with the best of them, but it at least deserves a spot as an above average attempt, and was actually quite good by its own rights. I was prepared not to care for it, but ended up falling for it by the end.

As a side note, continue watching until the end credits have finished rolling for the bonus scene...",1393027200,,2415,4.882926829268293

233102,5,6300214508,"This film caught my attention when it was released in theaters.  I love Holmes and this film gives you a glimpse into what might have been the start of Watson and Holmes.  It is hard to imagine a youthful Holmes being any different than the adult we have come to know, and this film doesn't disappoint.  Young Sherlock has already begun to be that wizard of observation we all know and love, and Watson is amazed to find himself caught up in an adventure with this new friend,  Too bad no one ever followed this film with another following these young men into more mysteries.",1392163200,,576,4.457142857142857
233103,5,6300214508,"Very entertaining ""what-if"" take on Sherlock Holmes.  While the film acknowledges the fact Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote Holmes' and Watson's introduction, it entertains the notion that they met in a boarding school in their late teens.

I'm not a review writer or adept at writing reviews, but I will tell you what I liked about it.  In general I've never been able to get into Sherlock Holmes because it was a product of it's time, a little bit slow for me (although in my middle age I'm starting to slow down and enjoy slower stuff more).  The latest Holmes movies with Robert Downey Jr. are entertaining in their own right, but they're not really Sherlock Holmes.  This was the only movie that actually made Holmes exciting in a framework that still seemed like Sherlock Holmes, as I understood it.  Explaining how the crime works, and how Holmes came to it's conclusions, in an exciting way.  If you want to get a youngster into Sherlock Holmes this is probably the movie to do it with.  I can't comment on the current BBC series Sherlock as I've not seen it, but still, it's fun enough you want to read the actual books.

Of course the movie is helped with a decent dose of (for the time) state-of-the-art special effects.  Especially the computer generated ""Stained-Glass Knight"" sequence, which was one of the first big sequences from the fledgling Pixar division of industrial light and magic (Obviously movies like Tron and even Star Trek 2 had computer generated graphics sequences, but the sequence in YSH was the most realistic to date).

Now I haven't mentioned the story yet, for good reason.  You probably already know the story from the description of the video, and other people's reviews.  I will say that YSH gets into high gear when a man going to dinner gets hit by a poison dart, and begins to hallucinate that his dinner is trying to kill him, running home, it leads to his unintentional suicide.  I'll just leave that there so you can watch it for yourself.

As far as the DVD itself, the picture quality is good (again not really an expert, it looked good to me) in widescreen, and had a dolby digital 5.1 audio track which was equally good.  Other than that there's not much to say.

If you're a fan of 80's adventure movies and Holmes you will probably like this.",1392076800,,2290,4.614814814814815

233165,5,6300214508,"Beautiful film.  Even though it is geared toward a youthful audience, it's still fun to look at what Speilberg, et al, and Chris Columbus came up with from the canon in terms of how these friends might have become acquainted.  I particularly like their extrapolations abut the origins of parts of the myth, such as Holmes and women, the deerstalker hat, and the friendship of Holmes and Watson.
The young actors are up to it---even if Watson's youthful stodginess is a bit much at times---and he seems cast in the mold of a young Nigel Bruce.  Nicholas Rowe's Holmes is an interesting mixture of adolescence and burgeoning self-confidence.  Very intriguing take on Moriarty and his background.

I was torn between buying the digital version in HD from iTunes/Amazon or get the standard DVD so I could have the physical copy and just back it up to stream at home. I ended up buying the DVD and now that I've seen the quality I almost wish I would've skipped the physical copy and spent the extra money on the HD digital copy.  Its definitely watchable but it looks pretty rough in some spots and overall just isn't a great transfer. That doesn't detract from the movie itself though, I heartily recommend it, especially to those that may have some nostalgic feelings toward the movie and can relive a fun movie from their childhood.

233214,1,6300214508,"Cardboard characters & comic book plot from start to finish. An insult to ACD.

An equivalent would be devising a film of young Napoleon and shoveling in all the cliches one can think of: i.e., young Nappy playing with toy soldiers under his blankets with a flashlight after Lights Out in the dorm + cramming his hand into the middle of his shirt front and strutting before the mirror + his roommates calling him a dreamer + him studying big maps of Russia, etc.  This is the equivalent of the junk cramked out of the sausage machine for this uninspired, by-the-numbers sludge.

I visited Holmes's digs at 221B Baker Street in London and found them meticulously faithful to the stories, including the number of steps leading up to their digs, the tobacco in the toe of the Persian slipper + all other details. The site maintains a scrapbook of letters from all over the world addressed ""Dear Mr. Holmes"" and the letters look up to him, admire him and treat him as a real person. While there, I chatted with other Holmes afficiandos who gave priority to visiting the site in the midst of their extensive travels from India, Japan, Ceylon & the like.

233317,1,6300214508,"Who doesn't love Sherlock Holmes? Surely, anyone reading this review, considering this movie is already a fan. I feel like it is my duty to warn you from watching this rubbish.

Where do I start? The premise is intriguing: What would Holmes and Watson be like in their late teens? Some adjustments need to made, but that's OK. After the opening credits, however, everything goes downhill.

The plot was, from the start, implausible. The case: Why did several men commit suicide despite having every reason to live? Lestrade says it is all coincidence, but Holmes, with scant evidence, is certain otherwise.

The writing is bad, as are the overall character developments.

Nicholas Rowe's portrayal of Holmes is fair enough. He comes off smart and youthful, though not quite the brilliant adult Holmes. That makes sense.

Alan Cox is miserable, whiny, and insipid as John Watson. Watson here is as dumb as a dolt, unable to come to the most obvious conclusion. Cox plays him as if he were trying to be foolish.

Holmes' love interest is Elizabeth, played by Sophie Ward. Her role is not much more than as a pretty place keeper. She fawns over Holmes, as the most weak of stereotyped woman as can be found on film.

Anthony Higgins is the bad guy, Professor Rathe, who seems wooden and predictable.

Lestrade is presented by Roger Ashton-Griffiths as having no particular police skills at all. Bad scripting left him coming across as off-off-off Broadway.

Rupert Waxflatter, Elizabeth's uncle, seen here by Nigel Stock, is written as a cartoonish Disney-like character.

I could on and dwell on the plot progressions and how unrealistic they are, or the ways problems are solved. I won't. Do yourself a favor and skip ""Young Sherlock Holmes.""

233746,5,6300214508,"Young Sherlock Holmes is a unique spin on the classic Sherlock Holmes stories. Now a days we are growing more and more used to adaptations such as Robert Downey Jr.'s films and Sherlock from the BBC. And dozens upon dozens of adaptations have been created featuring this Victorian sleuth. And in 1985, a younger, unique version of the character set about onto his own adventure.

Basic Plot
Sherlock and Watson are school boys who meet when Watson transfers to the school Holmes has made himself known through amazing feats of intellect. And though Watson is younger than the...18 something Holmes and he is less....quick witted let's say, he brings a friendly and practical element to Holmes' life. He also is loyal quickly and soon they become friends. With Elizabeth (Holmes' love interest), Watson and Holmes we are taken on an exciting mystery of a zealous religious cult, hallucinogenics, several missing women, and several odd deaths .

Characters
Hands down I believe they are given unique personalities that are true to the nature in general of the books and the actors do a grand job of performing them. Holmes is arrogant and yet sweet, more emotional than tradition and in love (which didn't happen in the books and is still debated where Irene Adler comes in) which I felt was a GREAT aspect. This is younger more impulsive Holmes with a very sweet love story and a budding friendship with Watson. Watson is played as a scared, pudgy boy who dreams of becoming a doctor who has to learn courageousness as the course of the film progresses, and learn to use his mind. Elizabeth, the made up character and 3rd main cast member, doesn't get much screen time, but you gather that she is a relatively intelligent woman (Holmes loves her for goodness sake) with a strong sense of independence while yes, still holding onto some femininity ascribed to Victorian ladies.

In general
The unique twist of Holmes and Watson meeting at school, later to meet as adults, and growing together, getting glimpses of an unrefined/emotional Holmes and dim-witted Watson shows the developmental stage of this characters. We get an interpretation of the groundwork that will lead into the characters being fully realized later.

Given Chris Columbus as a writer and Stephen Spielburg among the producers; some of the more fun aspects of this movie arenoting the similarities with the scenes of life in Hogworts and a near exact reuse of the temple scene in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.  The special effects from an early Industrial Light and Magic team also add to what is other wise an OK movie. In fact there is a fine watch-maker/craftsmanly look to these animations.

Plot is a fairly pedestrian take on Sherlock Holmes style detective work. Fanatic Egyptian secret society, mysterious seemingly unrelated deaths and an 'Oh by the way"" mention of disappearing girls and so forth. The time spent on introducing us to the key cast members are a sure sign that this was intended as a pilot for either a TV series or more than one movie.

This is another movie that made little impression on me when it was new. It is worth a home viewing, all the more so because it is an easy movie to interrupt when it is time to get a beverage. Harry Potter fans may find this as something of a completer piece for movies about that strange kid with special abilities staged in an exclusive public school.

Readers, I want to find praise for this movie, but about all I can muster is that it is not bad. It makes sense for family time, or an inoffensive kid's party movie.

Animation was good for the year.

The bad:
The acting overall was not great.
The story had huge holes in it.
I found myself often bored at the progression of events.
The sound was TERRIBLY EDITED.  The speaking was so soft and then the orchestra, especially in the temple, became so loud that I had to turn the volume almost a quarter of the way.  God, I would think they could have at least normalized the sound a little.

Watson meet as school boys sharing rooms at a prestigious British boarding school. A string of odd
suicides prompts a young Holmes to go to the police with warnings of ""something going on"". He can see a pattern to them that suggests murder. Unable to convince any adults to believe them, the
boys set off to investigate on their own. This leads them to uncover a secret cult of Egyptian
death worshippers on campus.
  O.K. the plot is total nonsense. Any Holmes purist will tell you that they never met as boys.
The film's creators even admit as much as the credits roll. The story is a ""What if..?"" and is
intended as an homage to the characters and to Conan Doyle's work. Everything from the opening
credits (a tip of the hat to the credits on the old Basil Rathebone films) to the final post
credit scene is intended as a love letter to this astounding character. Somewhat reminicent of Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom (which was released only a year before)there is one vaguely
dark dream sequence where Holmes confronts his weeping mother and his adulterous father, but for the most part it is light-hearted and fast paced entertainment. The effects are surprisingly
good considering CGI was still in its infancy at this time (or perhaps not so surprising as
ILM/Pixar was the effects house used). Writer Chris Columbus, Director Barry Levinson, and

233965,2,6300214508,"This film was written by Chris Columbus who went on to direct Home Alone and several Harry Potter films. Too bad this one is such a clunker. Considering the talent involved (Columbus, Barry Levinson, Steven Spielberg) it was a let down! I felt like the story just chugged along with huge gaps in it and really was just a series of silly scenes to explain the quirks behind Sherlock Holmes. We learn how the teen became the man he is in later books. Some examples include why he plays the violin, how he picked up the word 'Elementary,' and how as a tender teen he can solve ANY mystery.

Watson and Holmes are teenagers of different ages yet in the same dorm/class. In addition, Holmes looks about sixteen while Watson is about twelve or thirteen. They meet at boarding school during 'the Victorian era' (the narrator's words not mine). They have antics together and Holmes encourages Watson to take risks. There is a love interest, Egyptian cult, and who knows what else?

Too many things annoyed me about the movie. Why was Elizabeth wearing tons of make up? In Victorian England, only prostitutes wore makeup...hers was not to look good on camera--it was over the top. Also, why would some 15/16 year old GIRL be allowed to live at a boys' school EVEN AFTER her uncle/the ex-teacher who lived in a laboratory was murdered...again, just convoluted. Also, no nice girl would live with a boy unchaperoned! She lets Holmes move in with her in the 'laboratory' and they are obviously in love so what is up with that ?? Her reputation would be ruined. I suppose 'realism' is not important in these children's films so forgive me for picking holes!

I found the movie very slow and really uninteresting. I didn't care what happened to any of them! The graphics/special effects during several hallucination scenes were cheesy but this WAS 1985! After about an hour, my son (age 13) was bored and I said I can't stand this anymore so we stopped watching it.

I remarked to my husband (a rabid Holmes fan) that a movie has to be REALLY awful in order for my son or me to shut it off before it finishes! He didn't like it either. We aren't snobs and do like many children's films but this one was just one dimensional and I say give it miss!",1314316800,5,2233,4.54726368159204

The Steven-Spielberg-created setting is first class and, for the most part, the acting is pretty good. As for the action, however, young Mr. Holmes sometimes draws important conclusions (really assumptions) from evidence that is weak at best, for example, his conclusion that the first two ""suicides"" were really murders. (I can not help but think of the quote repeated throughout Sherlock Holmes literature: ""Never assume, Watson!"") He also immediately identifies these two dead men among a group of men in a picture even though he apparently has never seen them or previous pictures of them. Even Jeremy Brett, my favorite Sherlock Holmes actor, couldn't do that! A small blow gun is used to shoot poison darts (one or two inches long!) into the necks of victims yet the victims only seem to notice a slight sting from the dart for one or two seconds whereas ""in real life"" the physical experience of the dart itself would be much stronger and noticeable for much longer. The poison, which generally takes effect a few minutes after the dart is felt, creates nightmarish hallucinations which, unrealistically, young Holmes easily counters with the repetition of the person's name a few times. (I presume the creators of this movie never took LSD, DMT, or any of the other hallucinogenic drugs of the '60s.) (To be fair, regarding the effects of the darts and their poison, ""it's a movie"" - unrealistic scenes of this nature could even appear in an ""adult"" Sherlock Holmes film.) Then there is the sword that ""happens"" to appear next to Holmes after he has fallen to the ground in the final sword fight. It is some distance from the burning building that was used by the evil sect. Where did it come from? And for a Sherlock Holmes to kiss a girl! That just seems really out of character, even if the character is a youth. (If the girl had lived and she had been a young Irene Adler in Spielberg's movie, who for the ""real"" S.H. was ""THE woman"", maybe it would have worked for me???)

For adults, this is an entertaining fantasy, but not really a great Sherlock Holmes movie.

S. Baring-Gould tells us that Holmes was born in 1854 and sent, c. 1865-7, to ""a board school"" (name unspecified), of which he says ""It is a pity that we do not know more about the two years Sherlock spent there.""  The creators of this movie must have read that sentence and taken off from it, and in this fast-moving adventure movie they show us a young Holmes who clearly has the roots of his adult self already in place.  A keen observer, impatient with incompetence, and the master of a vast store of esoteric knowledge, young Holmes (Nicholas Rowe) is older than Baring-Gould's version of him--probably around 17--when, attending Brompton School in London, he meets an even younger (about 11) John Watson (John Cox), who's immediately dazzled by his skills and overwhelming personality.  But Holmes isn't just a future British eccentric (a species common to that nationality).  When the school's clergyman (Donald Eccles) runs out in front of a carriage and is killed, Holmes is quick to connect his death with the apparent suicide of Bentley Bobster (Patrick Newell), and soon figures out that both were murdered in a very exotic way.  Although his obsession gets him expelled, he doggedly pursues his findings and follows the trail to a hidden pseudo-Egyptian temple that is the headquarters of the Rametap, a fanatical religious group that has survived since the heyday of Ancient Egypt.

This Steven Spielberg presentation has all the pace, thrills, and stunning special effects (by George Lucas's ILM) that we might expect, along with a scary and sinister band of villains and some really unforgettable characters, including the eccentric retired Prof. Waxflatter (Nigel Stock), who's obsessed with creating a working ornithopter, his niece Elizabeth Hardy (Sophie Ward), with whom Holmes is in love, and Prof. Rathe (Anthony Higgins), Brompton's headmaster, who proves to be more than he appears.  The look of Victorian London is brilliantly recreated and the script gives us several hints into the roots of Holmes's future, including his notorious use of cocaine.  Though the vivid effects and the Rametap in their hideout are occasionally a bit scary, no one over 11 or 12 should be seriously troubled by them.

Showing Holmes and Watson in their intial meeting and partnership was genius.  A little on the supernatural side, but that just adds to the quality and keeps your interest.  I also like how they explain why Sherlock avoids any future serious female relationships.  And what can I say about the exceptionally debonair but evil arch-rival Moriarty....you just have to see for yourself.

I think sequels would have taken away from this original film.  By the other comments I've read, I am glad to see that this film has held up well after all these years.  Being a period piece, it does not suffer from ever being outdated.

First of all the special effects take up way to much time in the movie that could have been given to establishing a better story line.  The idea of Sherlock and Watson being together in school long before the ""Study in Scarlet"" is distasteful.  The actor playing Holmes was badly cast.

SPOILER ALERT!!! With a shocking revelation at the end of the movie (stay tuned during the credits), it looked like Paramount intended this movie to be the first in a franchise.

It just goes to show that the name of Steven Spielberg doesn't always mean gold at the box office although officially the film was not directed by him it was directed Barry Levinson (RAIN MAN).

Having recently watched it for the first time, I am astonished at how much it resembles the early HARRY POTTER films. On closer examination this comes as no surprise as YOUNG SHERLOCK HOLMES was written by Chris Columbus who directed the first two Potter outings. The costumes, the photography, the settings are all strikingly similar and this has to be more than coincidence.

Fans of Sherlock Holmes should find the clever plot about mysterious murders engaging while fans of Harry Potter will find marked similarities to Harry's environment at Hogwarts and Diagon Alley. Alex Cox who plays young Watson looks just like Harry even down to the glasses.

I remember it, the coming of age story of an inquisitive young man and the navet of his friend as they investigate the mysteries that the adults around them ignored.

This is an old movie, at that painful cusp when computer graphics had yet to touch mainstream movies and movie making was still trying to avoid dreaded R-ratings. There is no blood, guts, gore or dismemberment; there are not fast paced montages to pander to our ADD addled attention spans. What you have here is a rather innocent, if not hokey, look at a fun story of adolescent adventure. The actors have all since faded, their performances not particularly noteworthy however the plot, the story and the idea remain a comfortable look back into how such an iconic character may have been formed.

But this movie, it's a bargain, it may not be something you watch more than a handful of times but you'll be glad you did. You'll see that one Harry Potter was not the first young boy to seek out adventure while the rest of us toiled in our busy lives.

234125,4,6300214508,"This movie was ahead of its time in terms of fantasy and elements that kids now enjoy in the form of Harry Potter books (right down to the stripped school boy scarves they wear).  It's a Victorian era tale about one of the most famous pairs in literary history, Sherlock Holmes and John Watson.  While there is no official tale in their history how Holmes and Watson ever met, this was a delightful set up for their possible first meeting.  Having the teen element within it, it appealed to the teen audience.  However, the detail and accuracy of the tale was way over a kid's head, plus the nature of the story was, now that I see it again, rather dark.

Watson transfers from his home in northern England to attend a boarding school in London, where he would meet his famous friend and companion, Holmes.  He finds Holmes a brilliant genius and cannot comprehend how he is able to deduce so much from his observations of others.  They are confronted with an unusual mystery, once they are caught up in the mysterious death of a beloved eccentric professor, Waxflatter, and Holmes sees a connection between the professor's death, two odd deaths of two seemingly unrelated people in London, and the word Waxflatter whispers to Holmes upon his death ""Hathar"".  Soon, Holmes and Watson, as well as Holmes's love, Elizabeth, his professor's niece, are on the trail of these rather strange deaths around London, all seeming to stem from a secret from the past.

The story moved rather slowly, but it kept the viewer's interest.  It was marketed somewhat to the teen set, which would trickle down to children, but the subjects are a bit over their heads.  There is one comment I would like to make, of which I apologize if this is a spoiler - the scene with Watson hallucinating over the those walking gingerbread men - that was a little silly.  But otherwise, a slow moving story to keep a sophisticated viewer's interest in what makes a great horror mystery.  It nicely parallels the more adult Holmes/Watson stories that we would read as adults and provides a nice springboard into adult literature and an interest in the actual stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle for adults and children alike.",1235174400,,2199,4.710182767624021
234126,2,6300214508,"Awfully slow moving today. When it came out, it may have been a Spielberg project, a technological piece, but it definity lacks the wonder of ET or the appeal of Star Wars. The teen kids will find it rather tame, the horror scenes, not even as weird as Harry Potter.

Sherlock Holmes is best handled by the BBC. Holmes is sort of an early James Bond, almost a Union Jack superman without the need for female companionship. Hmmm?",1229990400,3,428,4.487179487179487
234127,3,6300214508,"Anytime I hear about a work on Sherlock Holmes done outside of the standard canon by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle I cringe. Several attempts over and above the standard stories were very good. ""The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes"", ""Murder by Decree"" to name a few, Outstanding work within the Holmes stories were produced by Granada Television with Jeremy Brett and David Burke as the main characters. So, where do we place this interpretation by Spielberg?
Well, somewhere in between Fair to Good. The storyline is interesting, setting around the High School era of the characters,the sets are mysterious and the actors all do a good job. Even though Holmes never met Watson in his youth we are nonetheless given a reason why Holmes has a lack of emotional involvement as an older adult. Quite simply, in this movie he pours it all out into a youthful romance that ends in tragic circumstances.
Some of the special effects are fantastic. One is when a stained glass Crusader is brought to life and his two dimensional image is accurately transitioned from front to back, all with grinding glass sound effects done to perfection!
The ""flying machine"" reminds you of the great Leonardo in every way (I believe this was intentional) and as someone has mentioned in these reviews you MUST continue all through the ending credits to receive a bit of a surprise that portends of future adventures.
This movie is certainly ""Harry Potter"" in many ways and was perhaps ahead of it's time in this theme. It is a movie that should be approached as ""entertainment"", not to be taken seriously and as a light entry in the Holmesian quest.",1229212800,9,1620,4.789285714285715

This movie has surely stood the test of time and is destined to become a classic, not only with Holmes connoisseurs, but with fans of period movies as well.

234222,5,6300214508,"Young Sherlock Holmes got a rough ride when it came out - not so much for the notion of Holmes and Watson meeting as children (there'd been a more straight-laced British childrens' TV series about just that a few years earlier that passed without any noticeable outrage) but because it was felt that it owed far more to executive producer than Steven Spielberg than Arthur Conan Doyle. The fact that after it opened to mediocre business Stateside it was retitled Young Sherlock Holmes and the Pyramid of Fear to add an Indiana Jones spin to the marketing only added to their impression. Egyptian cults in the heart of London committing human sacrifices, hallucinogenic drugs leading to fatal encounters with turkey dinners and stained-glass windows, flying machines and, worse still, a girl was hardly the stuff of The Strand Magazine's most famous creation. But Doyle himself might have been a bit more forgiving - after all, he had Holmes come up against demon dogs, vengeful Mormons, deadly pygmies and even a vampire, and wasn't adverse to penning tales about vampires and monsters on the side when not attending s&eacute;ances or declaring children's photographs of fairies to be genuine proof of ethereal beings. In many ways the screenwriters have been rather more sympathetic to his creations and their world than they were ever given credit for, speculating on the origins of Holmes' strained relationship with Inspector Lestrade, his reticence with the opposite sex and even his vicious feud with Moriarty (you'll have to stick around for the post-end credits coda for that). And while critics complained that the film was special effects heavy, with his love of camera trickery it's affair bet whatever else he thought of the film, he'd have been delighted by the groundbreaking early CGI effects, which still manage to impress without overwhelming the film (the 2-D stained glass knight in armour is particularly cleverly designed)

Nicholas Rowe is an entirely convincing young Holmes, with an air of natural superiority without being unlikeable, and for the most part Alan Cox (rather unflatteringly used by his father Brian as the model for his turn as Hannibal Lektor!) avoids turning Watson into a clown, while a young Sophie Ward is a very fetching female lead and Anthony Higgins a dashing mentor-figure. The story is enjoyable even if it veers into adventure more than detection by the end, climaxing with a fine swordfight on a thin ice on a frozen river Thames. Not everything is entirely successful - there's a nightmare sequence with some pastries that really should have stayed on the cutting room floor - but the film's much more enjoyable than it has any right to be. It's also beautifully designed with a rather splendid score by Bruce Broughton that ensures it sounds as good as it looks. Great fun.",1198886400,6,2828,5.017021276595744

234224,5,6300214508,"I've always wanted a copy of this movie after seeing it in a theatre in the 80s.  Although it strays from the canon by Sir A. Conan Doyle, it is done so with respect.  The story is engaging, and the special effects are wonderfully done.  This is one that a person with even the slightest interest in Sherlock Holmes will enjoy.",1186617600,2,327,4.327868852459017
234225,2,6300214508,"Since Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson meet each other for the first time as adults in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's ""The Sign of the Four"", the story in this movie is distinctly extra-canonical. And yet, aside from that one minor continuity glitch, everything else in this movie lines up very well with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's stories. If the first few chapters of ""The Sign of the Four"" can be temporarily forgotten (or ret-conned, as us comic book fans say) the story in the movie not only works well with the rest of Sherlock Holmes continuity, but helps to explain a lot of things Conan Doyle never got around to explaining, such as the origin of Holmes's distinctive deer-stalker cap, coat, and pipe, the beginnings of Holmes's relationship with Inspector Lestrade, the origins of Moriarity and his rivalry with Holmes, and finally the reason Holmes has maintained a distance from women all his adult life.
This last reason, the death of a true love, turns out to be remarkably similar to the reason Ian Fleming gives for James Bond inability to stay monogamous, but since Ian Fleming was inspired by the Fu-Manchu series, which in turn was inspired by Sherlock Holmes, I suppose its not altogether inappropriate that the characters share this link.

The story in this movie, about an Egyptian cult of the dead in an underground temple, is at points very similar to ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"", particularly a scene with a human sacrifice, lots of chanting, and the young heroes looking on horrified from their hiding place. I'm going to have to double check the dates, but I suspect this movie came out after ""Temple of Doom"" and was trying to cash in on the Indiana Jones adventure craze.

Again, this is not entirely inappropriate, since Indiana Jones was based partly on the adventure movies of the 30s, which in turn were based off of stories like ""Sherlock Holmes"" and ""Fu-Manchu"". In fact the real sin is not that they attempted to rip Indiana Jones off, but that they failed so horribly in doing so.

Which brings me to the flaws of this film...
I'm told this film has been criticized because the story involves Holmes and Watson more or less stumbling onto the bad guys, instead of using Holmes characteristic deductive reasoning. However some of Conan Doyle's original stories also follow this pattern, so I don't hold that against the film. Also in the movie, like Conan Doyle's stories, Holmes does not share all of his information with Watson at the time, but only once the case is all over does he reveal how he solved it.

Unfortunately in the movie the viewer gets to see some of the assassinations in the film, and thus has more information than Holmes does, which is unfortunate and takes away from the suspense a little bit. Also the victims are shot with a poison dart which causes them to hallucinate, and (again unfortunately) we the viewer have to sit through these hallucinations, which I suspect were just an excuse to cram some Hollywood special effects into this movie and make it more marketable.

Really, sometimes you have to wonder what in the world Hollywood is thinking. I don't know a single person who likes those weird dream/ Hallucination sequences (unless watching them while high), and yet Hollywood films are often full of them.

Also the directing in this film is terrible. None of the action sequences are choreographed with any sort of suspense, and most of the physical action in this movie doesn't make any sense at all. Examples:
- --the heroine is abducted by the bad guy, and she appears to run off with him without making any effort to resist whatsoever.
- --The bad guys with swords are the clumsiest bad guys ever, and can't seem to hit Holmes or Watson, even though the latter two are making what look like only lazy efforts to get away.
- --A character gets knocked into the ice water, and sinks way too quickly.
---A crash landing, which should have been a dramatic sequence, is almost boring. I could go on and on.

Verdict: Worth watching for Sherlock Holmes fans or 80s nostalgia, but there are good reasons why this film never became a classic.",1183075200,,4116,4.724233983286908

234279,3,6300214508,"I agree with Mr. DeRiemer's comment: ""A wonderful film for the most part, until it moves into young Indiana Jones territory"", although I am inclined to put it this way: A wonderful film until it goes straight into the toilet in the last half hour.

Holmes faced many exotic foes who were represented in perfectly convincing ways--a Napoleon of Crime, some Scowrers, a Speckled Band, a Sign of Four, multiple Garridebs, a whole League of Red-Headed Men, even an American mezzo-soprano who turned out to be tougher and smarter than he was.  There was really no need at all to mess up the ending of the picture with a gaudily witless journey into Indiana Jones-Land.

Some earlier reviewers have commented on a resemblance between this story and the Harry Potter series.  At least one reviewer has speculated that the idea (at least) of the books is derived from the film.  The fact is that there is a long history of schooldays adventures in England, probably originating in ""Tom Brown's Schooldays"" and highlighted by Rudyard Kipling's ""Stalky & Co."" as well as a series of novels by P.G. Wodehouse set at a London school called Wryken.

There is also an undercurrent of disdain from ""Sherlockian"" (American) and ""Holmesian"" (British) purists who object to the distortion of the relationship and initial meeting of Holmes and Watson.  Well, add me to the purists.  Anyone who will take the time to read ""A Study in Scarlet,"" the first published Holmes story--something that I heartily recommend to anyone who thinks THIS film is good!--will find a precise description of how, when, where and why the two men met for the very first time.  There is no way on earth that the two could previously have met as boys.

However, for what it is worth, all could be salvaged if the boy in the film were not John H. Watson but a certain ""Young Stamford,"" the mutual friend who brought the two strangers together and promptly evaporated entirely out of the series.

For those too young to have seen the theatrical release of this picture, I will point out that this was the first major film to use CGI effects.  In fact, Intel made a major product placement based on that fact.  When the film was released, many of us were agog with anticipation of a soon-to-come wonderful new thing called a ""Pentium.""  Boldly placed among the film's credits was an announcement that some special effects had been created with a computer using a Pentium chip (which, I imagine, was running at about 90 Hz in those long-ago days.)

234339,5,6300214508,"YOUNG SHERLOCK HOLMES is a very imaginative and entertaining addition to the Holmes Saga, detailing the boyhood of Holmes and Watson and their first brush with their most dangerous adversary...

As the story opens, Watson is the new mid-term arrival at Brompton, a boarding-school in the heart of Victorian-era London, where he quickly makes friends with charismatic senior student Sherlock Holmes.

On a quest to discover the reason why his mentor Waxflatter apparently killed himself, Holmes (Nicholas Rowe), girlfriend Elizabeth (Sophie Ward) and Watson (Alan Cox) are swept up into a horrifying adventure when they uncover a sinister revival of an Egyptian cult.

Filmed in 1985 (a fabulous time for fantasy films with ""Return to Oz"", ""The Goonies"", and ""Labyrinth"" also pushing the boundaries of the genre), YOUNG SHERLOCK HOLMES barely broke even when it was originally released and was supposed to have been the first entry in a new film franchise detailing the further exploits of Holmes and Watson as adolescents.  The series was aborted but the following and admiration of this movie has only grown throughout the years.  The entire cast is superb (and also features veteran British talents Susan Fleetwood, Freddie Jones, Nigel Stock and Anthony Higgins).

234418,5,6300214508,"With Steven Spielberg in the producing chair it should come as no real susprise that 1985s YOUNG SHERLOCK HOLMES as a definite Indiana Jones influence to it - most specifically Spielberg's most recent entry (at that time) into the popular frnachise INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM. Nowhere is this more evident than in the ancient hidden temple setting where our young heroes uncover much of the villains evil plot.

For a Sherlockian the movie is a curious anomaly, but incredibly entertaining. We know from the books of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle that Dr. Watson met Sherlock Holmes when both were in adulthood, yet this movie poses the irresistible `what-if' they had met earlier when both were in boarding school.

As one would expect with a movie from Spielberg's Amblin company, this movie is very colorful and filed with dazzling special effects - courtesy of Industrial Light and Magic. The plot essentially takes a back seat to the fun of spotting Holmesian references, watching his already developing deductive intellect solving puzzles and rooting for a bittersweet, blossoming romance between Holmes (played by Nicholas Rowe of LA FEMME MUSKETEER) and Elizabeth (Sophie Ward).

For what it's worth the central plot involves a poisoned darts, hallucinations, DaVinci inventions, a strange Egyptian religious cult and a mysterious secret several distinguished men have kept buried for years. It all makes for some very Spielbergesque style adventure entertainment that director Barry (RAIN MAN) Levinson manages to weave into an enjoyable and intriguing movie.

Sherlockian purists will likely find this premise hard to swallow, but as a diehard fan of the Great Detective, I for one had a great time with this movie.

Unquestionably the chracterization of Watson is influenced more by the Rathbone-Bruce movies of the 1930s and 1940s than Conan Doyles novels with this movie featuring Alan Cox in the part of the future doctor, a role he handles well with warmth and good humor.

Also of note in this movie is some wonderful period costumes and impressive sets.

(USA - 1985)

Aspect ratio: 1.85:1
Theatrical soundtrack: 6-track Dolby Stereo

In Victorian London, the teenage Sherlock Holmes (Nicholas Rowe) and John Watson (Alan Cox) meet for the first time at school, where they become intrigued by a series of apparently unrelated 'suicides' which lead them to a murderous Egyptian cult operating in the bowels of the city...

Barry Levinson's reimagining of Holmes' teenage years is an enjoyable - though inconsequential - work which blends old-fashioned British melodrama with the demands of a US summer blockbuster (Steven Spielberg is one of the co-producers), whilst simultaneously acknowledging its debt to previous Holmes movies (note the iconic 'shadow-on-cobblestones' during the opening credits, derived from a similar image featured in the Rathbone-Bruce movies of the 1940's). The script, by future director Chris Columbus (HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCEROR'S STONE), plays fair with audience expectations by setting Holmes on the trail of a shadowy villain who leaves a series of intriguing clues in his/her wake, and the entire production is sumptuously designed (by Norman Reynolds) and photographed (by Stephen Goldblatt). Vivid set-pieces include a number of frightening hallucinations suffered by the 'suicide' victims before they die (parents of younger children, take note), and there's a major plot development at the VERY END of the film.

Of the younger cast members, only Cox makes much of an impression, playing Watson as a decent, loyal friend prone to juvenile weaknesses (in particular, a fondness for custard tarts!), while Sophie Ward is unable to make much of an underwritten role as Holmes' first - and only - sweetheart. Rowe's performance as Holmes lacks the zest and dynamism that might have lifted the movie out of the ordinary, and his blank-faced, emotionless characterization is the single most disappointing aspect of the entire production, though the supporting cast of familiar British thesps (including Freddie Jones, Anthony Higgins, Susan Fleetwood and Roger Ashton-Griffiths) does much to fill the void in Rowe's wake.

Look out for some interesting names in the credits, including animatronics supervisor Stephen Norrington (later the director of BLADE and THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN) and computer animation technician John Lasseter (director of TOY STORY and A BUG'S LIFE).",1082505600,2,2391,5.554945054945055

234485,4,6300214508,"Fans of Harry Potter should check out this Victoriana fantasy ; in style and tone, they have much in common. They share the classic English boarding school setting, and are filled with magic and monsters, jaw-dropping sets, and wonderfully crusty and unusual British personalities.
Chris Columbus, who helmed the first two Harry Potter movies, wrote the script for this bouncy marriage of a Sherlock Holmes detection story and an Indiana Jones-style cliffhangers. This odd combination received a lot of criticism when the film was first released, but ultimately the mixture of a Victorian detective story and an ancient Egyptian cult is charming and a lot of fun.
Nicholas Rowe is perfect as the snotty, elegant young Sherlock Holmes, and Sophie Ward is absolutely radiant as his romantic interest. Alan Cox as Watson (a dead-ringer for Daniel Radcliffe who plays Harry Potter) is less effective, but tolerable. The effects were groundbreaking in their time, featuring the first computer-generated characters -- animated by Pixar before they became a household word -- and still hold up nicely. They actually have more charm than most modern CGI effects. The film does suffer from slow patches and a premise that could have been pushed even further, but this is still a good family film and most older kids and adults interested in special effects should enjoy it. (Be warned, however: younger children may find parts too frightening.)
Sadly, as far as extras goes, the DVD is ""Elementary, my dear Watson"": nothing, not even a trailer. That's a shame, since many special effects breaththroughs were made on this movies, such as the computer animated stained-glass window character, and early work from Pixar (yes, Pixar!)

234486,4,6300214508,"I'll readily admit, here and now, hand on heart; I have never picked up a Sherlock Holmes book, never mind read one! I can tell you what I know about this: the author is Arthur Conan Doyle, and the names of the main characters are Sherlock Holmes and John Watson. That will get me far in a general knowledge quiz. Apart from that, I know nothing, and have no interest in the books. (Although, there is a Sherlock Holmes book based around the Titanic disaster by William B. Seil , and I want that!) So why did I watch this film? Arm pushed up behind my back; I was forced to watch it. OK, seriously, I was given it to watch, and I could have put off watching it, but I guess I was curious.
And to my utter horror, I actually found myself enjoying it! Not enough to go out and start reading the books though. But from a novice's point of view, to know nothing about the books, and to enjoy the film on its own, without having read the books, is quite good. When you've read the book and go to see the film based on the book (or vice versa), you end up liking one or the other. I wouldn't necessarily go out and buy the books, or borrow one from the library. But I really did like the film. And I wasn't expecting to!
The only thing that annoyed me about the film was the period of time it was set in. I know that's when it was supposed to be set, but the whole Victorian era just annoys me. The fashion, the little boys dressed up like old men, and the stupid way of talking.
I loved the characters. The little Harry Potter lookalike (Alan Cox) who played Watson, Sophie Ward who played Elizabeth was beautiful, and Sherlock (Nicholas Rowe) - well, I couldn't really see it, until he put on that stupid coat, hat and put the pipe in his mouth in the last few scenes.
It was also quite interesting to find out how the young Sherlock came across the items you would normally associate with Sherlock Holmes from the books. The daft-looking hat was from Elizabeth's uncle; the pipe is when Watson had to buy something in a shop; and the coat/cloak thing . . . Watch the film for yourself and find out.
Directed by the wonderful director who did Rain Man, Barry Levinson couldn't quite live up to Rain Man, but has done a brilliant job. The (young) stars shine in this.
If you're not a fan of Sherlock Holmes, don't worry. Look at me! Never read a book, and found myself enjoying it like any other film. Not really that much of a Christmas-y movie, until the end - apart from the snow on the ground of course!",1072051200,,2502,4.214583333333334
234487,5,6300214508,"This movie has been repeatedly underrated since it came out in 1985 and for no good reason. It has strong writing, directing, acting and setting, and a balanced dose of mystery, fantasy, reality and adventure.
Sherlock Holmes, a young man still in school, faces a mystery that involves an old religious cult that may be responsible for the recent, strange murders taking place in London. Watson is the narrator of the story. He has just arrived at Sherlock's school, and fascinated by the charm, intelligence and wit of his soon to be good friend, follows him along on his adventure. Poisoned darts, DaVinci-like experiments, mysterious acquaintances, seemingly unexplained events, and ghosts from the past make an appearance and very soon ""the game is afoot"".
It has a solid script that combines the mundane environment and events of high school with an interesting mystery/adventure plot penned by Chris Colombus in the well-known Conan Doyle style. It has equally solid main characters that not only accurately portray younger versions of Sherlock Holmes and John Watson, but also behave believably and in accord to the books written by Conan Doyle.
The realistically reproduced sets and costumes (you will even get to see the iconic cape, hat and pipe) and the speculative twists on the origins of the characters make this movie more than just enjoyable and entertaining, it makes it as charming as Holmes and Watson's personalities.
If you are a Sherlock Holmes fan or simply enjoy an old-fashioned, well-crafted, surprising mystery, buy this movie. You won't be disappointed.

234488,5,6300214508,"The sequence where the stained glass window figure becomes alive was terribly innovative at the time, and remains artistically very satisfying today.
I often find many of Spielberg's productions would make wonderful silent movies, whether or not the dialogs are any good. The dialogs ARE interesting in this picture, but also there are so many moments that are pure film, when you can just follow everything without the need for any words.
It's thoroughly enjoyable and I give it five stars, although I saw many flaws in it when I first watched it as a child and my objections remain valid. Sherlock isn't remotely interested in his ""love interest"". This girl is an impossibility in an all boy's school in the Victorian Era, anyway. But if one where to let oneself get carried away by suspension of disbelief (which I find difficult in this instance) it would still remain impossible that this - by the way, extremely - pretty girl has only two (yes, that is 2) rivals to her affection in that whole school full of pubescent boys! There is this scene when they are in the library and Sherlock actually moves to kiss her, and this is not looked upon with either scandal or envy. I'm sorry, but that would not do at all in real life, not in those days anyway.
Also, at that age I already knew that one had to be thoroughly dead and devoid of any internal organs in order to be mummified, so several of the scenes were outrageously implausible to me even then.
The movie has hardly aged, though, and remains one of my personal favorites.",1070755200,5,1534,4.602189781021898
234489,5,6300214508,"Originally planned as the first of a series, Young Sherlock Holmes was a bit of a misfire at the box office. It cost $18 million and only grossed about 20 per cent of its budget back. In the years since its release it has become a cult film for those who can appreciate it for the blockbuster it never was. I personally discovered it on a Christmas Eve showing on BBC in the late 80s. Even then, I thought it was great despite it being a darker Christmas film than we're used to.

In a snowy and sinister December at the height of the Victorian Era, Watson, as a teenager, is sent to Brompton, a private school in a snowy London, when his old one is shut down due to lack of funding. Upon arrival, he meets a violin-playing smart-Alec who deducts his character from his mere appearance. It's the beginning of a life-long friendship.

Holmes' life on campus is rather cosy. He has a pretty girlfriend Elizabeth (Sophie Ward) and her uncle, Professor Waxflatter, is a crackpot inventor of the Doc Brown variety who lives in the school attic with all of his crazy inventions. At first, Watson and Holmes have fun getting up to mischief on campus but a series of bizarre suicides soon distracts them.

The local Inspector Lestrade is too lazy to do anything about it, leaving them free to investigate. Apparently the victims are all sane, happy men who seem to go suddenly mad with fear and hurl themselves to the nearest oncoming death. Things get personal when Waxflatter suffers the same fate and stabs himself in fit of madness.

Why are ordinary men going crazy? Who is the mysterious black robed person hiding in the shadows? What dark secret was Waxflatter hiding? All questions to which Holmes demands answers and he drags along the nervous Watson and Elizabeth as he scours all the dodgy areas of Wapping talking to loads of cockneys and people who call you 'Govna'. What they discover is an ancient blood oath and a huge conspiracy brewing in the spooky alleyways.

In the 80s, Chris Columbus penned a string of imaginative movies from Gremlins to The Goonies and later he directed the Home Alone films as well as Bicentennial Man (yes, I like it) and the first two Harry Potters. He's one of those writers who can hide a surprising amount of darkness in a kid's film and Young Sherlock is a fine example of his most sophisticated writing.

With strong direction from Barry Levinson and enchanting production values from Steven Spielberg there's no denying that this movie looks absolutely great. But it's how it sounds that'll really impress you. Bruce Broughton - a tragically under-rated composer who has talent equal to John Williams - has been unfairly slumming most of his career in TV movies. Here, he delivers one of the most spellbinding and Gothic scores you have ever heard. There are dozens of themes, moments of real magic, evil menace and breathtaking action. If this film had been a hit it really would have become as famous as themes for Jaws, Indiana Jones and Harry Potter.

And speaking of Harry Potter, one cannot deny that JK Rowling was inspired by this film in many ways when creating her Potter universe. I'm not crude enough to list all the similarities in this review but let me just say that while there may not be anywhere near enough to call it plagiarism there sure is more than enough to call it a coincidence. Watch the film and you'll know what I mean.

Originally the critics dismissed Young Sherlock Holmes as another effects-filled Spielberg fantasy, but that's an unfair judgement. The visual effects (really quite something for its time) are essential to the story as well as being pioneering. You may not believe it but YSH was actually the first ever film to feature a fully CGI character (a stained-glass knight who comes alive), created by Pixar. Future Toy Story director John Lasseter was even one of the computer wizards who helped bring it to life. Unfortunately it lost its well-deserved Academy Award to the inferior effects of Cocoon.

Even 20 years on a sequel definitely needed. Chris Columbus has stated he was upset that a sequel never got off the ground and that the series never took off. He shouldn't sell himself short. Of course it would need new actors but so many have put on the hat and coat of Sherlock Holmes that the role doesn't belong to just one man. There is still life in this spin-off franchise. All it needs is the right story and some of the magic that is missing from most kids' films these days.

And when I say kids' films I should really play-down the negative connotations of such a label. As one of the first PG-13 rated films, YSH has a bit of a savage edge, a hardness unfamiliar the condescending kids' films of today.

Sir Arthur would be proud. He may have felt indifferent towards his most famous creation, but if he were alive today he would have loved this film. And it well and truly deserves 5/5.",1070064000,70,4890,4.628604382929643

234552,5,6300214508,"A good deal of literary license in fact since Sir Arthur Conan Doyle did not write about a young Sherlock. It is however a delightful renditon that I think even he would appreciate. The Spielberg and Levin magic that later went into the Young Indiana Jones movies was well established in this movie. The cast, sets, and music are excellent. The special effects add to the movie but don't overpower it. The story is compelling and you will be glued to your seat.

Most fans of the Harry Potter series should enjoy this movie. It starts out with young Sherlock going to a private school and meeting Watson for the first time. As he unravels the mystery of an underground society that worships the occult in a hidden pyramid he meets his nemesis Moriarty for the first time. The movie is magical and draws the viewer into a wonderful world of Victorian England.

 If you like Spielberg movies you will probably enjoy this movie. If you liked the Indiana Jones or Young Indiana Jones movies you will probably like this movie.

This one directed by Barry Levinson (""Rainman"") and written by Chris Columbus (""Gremlins"", ""Goonies"")follows the adventure in which a teenager Holmes launches himself, with an equally young Watson, to discover a murderous plot that threatens some British men with nothing apparently in common.
The importance of this film is not only the fact that it shows the first digital character in movie history, but the freshness that Columbus brought to the story and the extremely original point of view with which he aproaches one of literature's most precious and serious characters.
The story will keep you nailed to your chair, and you'll start seeing shadows around the corner. Production Design is equally impecable as you're transported magically to Victorian London... with its fog and misterious streets.
The seriousness that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle imprinted to his character is still there, but comic relief has an important presence, courtesy of young Watson.
There are some mistakes, alright, but the movie's exceptional 80's innocence will be forgiven by almost every one who gets to see it.
Bruce Broughton's score is one of a kind!
I couldn't nearly believe when I discovered this movie is going to be released on the DVD format, it has been one of my favorites of all time and you can feel the Spielbergian scent all over it! With the Indiana Jones Trilogy being released this
October, I will be the proud owner of almost every Spielberg (directed or executive produced) movie related with the occult.

Holmes falls in love with an English beauty, and not to give too much away, he loses her (gotcha), thus beginning his famous lonely path.

I am not sure why they didn't do a sequel at the time, perhaps to many other projects. Now the ages of the actors/actresses, not to mention I believe a death of one of them would prevent it with the same cast.

234561,5,6300214508,"Tom Brown's School Days meets Arthur Conan Doyle!!  And the mix is sheer genius!  Young Sherlock Holmes is the sort of Disney Film they made in the late 50's and 60's.  Not a child's film, but a family film.  It is outstanding for plot, originality while remaining faithful to Conan Doyle's characters.
The movie poses the question of what if Holmes and Watson met while they were school boys.  Instead of movie into the ridiculous, they give you an intelligent movie on that premise - one which Conan Doyle, I think, would have approved.  The atmosphere and sets are wonderful, the actors perfect, writing, direction are crisp and with a pace that keeps you totally absorbed.
Watson come to a school in London during midterm and immediately is taken under the wing by Holmes.  He is resented by many of the students for his brilliance, is somewhat the teachers pet, though some of the elder stodgy and calcified ones dislike his arrogance.  Holmes is in love with the niece of a former headmaster, who know lives retired on the school grounds.  He is a wacky inventor that is working on all sorts of inventions including a flying machine.  There is a getting to know period, where Waston sees Holmes solving a mystery challenge, but soon they are involved in a real mystery.
Someone is using blow darts tipped in hallucinogens that causes them to see horrid visions driving them to kill themselves.  As one by one these men die, home begins to catch on something is not right.  But when his old master dies in the same fashion, he is determined to find out who is murdering these people and kidnapped young girls.
Won't ruin the thrilling mystery, but it is wonderfully done.  As Holmes and Watson rush to save his love, with Lestrade several steps behind.  It is a wonderful homage to Holmes and Watson character, yet still being so fresh and original.

Narrated by none other than Watson himself, it begins as Watson is beginning his stay at a new school.  It is almost inevitable that he meets the young Sherlock Holmes, and immediately befriends him and is taken on a daring journey to solve a mystery.
The suspense in this film certainly delivers, and the mystery never fails to tug at your brain.  You'll find yourself guessing who the perpetrator might be very early in the film, and you'll hold onto your breath until the moment he's brought to justice (or is he...).
While intense, dramatic, and speckled with violence, this is a movie that can be enjoyed by older children and adults alike.
If for no other reason, it's worth a viewing simply to see the first use of computer graphics in a film, earlier works of one Industrial Light and Magic; The same people responsible for classics such as Jurassic Park and Star Wars.

Anyway, I've been waiting for a sequel ever since I waited for the credits  to finish in the movie theatre.  There's a little twist at the end that has  something to do with Sherlock Holmes adult adventures in the Sir Arthur  Conan Doyle stories and it leads you to believe that there will be more  Young Sherlock Holmes stories to come.  Although I guess he won't be young  anymore.  If you like Sherlock Holmes or adventure, this movie will not  disappoint you.",948758400,5,761,4.194444444444445

7805389,5,6300214508,"Spielberg's company really outdoes itself by letting Barry Levinson direct a very Spielberg and youth oriented who-dunnit movie with Indiana Jones' overtones.

I really liked this movie.  It moved well, it captured the spirit of Doyle's characters were we able to see them in their youth.  And the film apologizes at the end saying that this only took the characters and paid homage to Doyle by creating an entirely new tale for two of literature's favorite detectives.

I think were Conan Doyle and Basil Rathbone were alive today and seen this film, they would have approved.

A well made film.  It has a dash of high adventure for the mystery, but it works.  A film from the 80s, meant for the 80s, but can be enjoyed by all generations.

Give it a shot.",1513468800,,757,4.639097744360902
