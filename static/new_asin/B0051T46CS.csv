8453219,4,B0051T46CS,Love the Lick Library classes and Danny Gil who is the instructer is top knotch...just understand this is truly Intermidaete you do need to have some basic Theory knowledge to be able to use this such as knowing your Majior and Minor scale formula as well as you Maijor and Minor scales as well as Pentatonic...if you have at least a basic understanding of these ...then this will help develop the usage of those in a musical way instead of just going through reps.,1410825600,,465,4.5476190476190474
8453220,3,B0051T46CS,"Danny Gill is great and in general all the instructors featured in Lick Library videos are pretty good. My only complain about them is the lack of music notation on screen. Why is that? Why not to make it like Hal Leonard and even Youtube amateur teachers do? I get tired when Danny (or other instructor) says ""Now play second fret on the G string and then first fret on the B string""... isn't it easier to just say ""play A and then C""? showing the staff/tablature overlaying the screen foot? The same happens when they explain chords. It's a LOT easier to show the typical diagram for an Em chord than saying string after string which fret you have to play, mute or let it sound freely. If they showed diagrams and staff/tablature it would be much helpful for people like me who have visual memory. Besides, it would be a great way for the ones who want to know what notes they are playing and not just place their fingers where the instructor says. Also when they explain songs you are kind of lost since you don't have the staff, nor the clef so you don't see written that the song is in the G or D scales or whatever scale they are, or if the song is in 3/4 or 4/4 or 6/8. Nothing about the rhythm or pace either. They usually give you all that information orally, but I wonder why they choose to disregard the music notation part, which is actually very important for a serious musician.",1400025600,2,1392,4.316793893129771
8453221,5,B0051T46CS,"This Dvd was very helpful for me, it taught me all the basics of music theory. its a short dvd if you know some basic theory and this dvd is only for those noice guitarists. so if you're an intermediate or advance I would not recommend this dvd to you. however, if you know zero music theory, this dvd is the one for you.",1360022400,,321,4.03125
8453222,5,B0051T46CS,Danny Gill is a fantastic teacher. His teaching methods are clear and easy to follow. He will explain to you step by step on all the different aspects and techniques. Well done Danny!,1357084800,,183,4.575757575757576
8453223,1,B0051T46CS,"I'm very very dissapointed with this DVD. After being playing guitar for about 16 years now and being only an intermediate or upper-intermediate player, I find this kind of teaching just a nonsense...The concepts are barely explained and 80% of the time the guy is telling you ""play 12th fret on 5th string, then 10th on 4th..."". IS THIS A JOKE? He tells you how to play the exact solo he has played, but not HOW TO USE the modes, harmonic minor scale, etc.

I can't understand why he keeps on telling you the EXACT NOTES he is playing as it is just a waste of time. Instead, what I wanted to know is how to spread the patterns through the fretboard, how to construct the chord progressions and when and how to use each mode/scale.

Skip it, there are much better instructional tools out there. (Fretboard navigator by Jamie Humphries is much much better, for instance).

8453224,3,B0051T46CS,"I have over 17 years playing experience,and have over 40 dvds ,and over 60 books on learning guitar. This is ok stuff but a much better to get is the Jamie Humphries Fretboard Navigation 1 and 2,or Andy James, also with LickLibray All these guys at LickLibrary know how to play,and Teach very well. Danny Gill is a Great Player and I Recomend anyone to get any other DVDs he has done like Whitesnake,Randy Rhoads just Solos DVD,Quick Licks Richie Blackmore,Jimmy Page,and the learn Joe Satriani DVD.But as for this I learned only about 2 things and got bored alot,I even question somethings he says. Jamie Humphries DVDs on Learn Van Halen ,Zack Wylde,and FretBoard Navigation on Theory taught me Many ,Many things .Over 100 Chords,Caged System how to use it,and right off the bat the notes on the fret board  by showing them in Octave and shape form,rather than Danny's Way of Teaching. So Long story Short ,I give it 2 stars,and give Fret Board Navigation a 10 ,take care and don't get stressed with theory just have fun and take it a little bit at a time,its worth it ,BELIVE Me.",1233878400,5,1082,4.606217616580311
