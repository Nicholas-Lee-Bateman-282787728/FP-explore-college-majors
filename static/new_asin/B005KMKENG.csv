4718038,5,B005KMKENG,"Awarded the prestigious ""Johnny on the Spot Award"" for its use of the phrase, TUB offers the viewer a glimpse into the ""hard knock"" world of single parenting. Voted best indie shower scene since Joe Swanberg.",1314921600,,208,4.805555555555555
4718039,4,B005KMKENG,"Bobby Miller's TUB is a master work of epic proportions. Miller took a simple urban legend and transformed it into a visionary piece, complete with ""special effects"" and dramatic tension that is remarkable. Certainly his best work to date.

8477005,5,B005KMKENG,"At first, I wasn't sure what I was watching. It was definitely the weirdest thing I have ever seen in my entire life, but as we learned more about the character, I actually felt bad. This short is great. It inspires me to make my own.

Poor Paul. Poor tub baby.",1317168000,,261,4.117647058823529
8477006,4,B005KMKENG,"Lucky for me, I just so happen to have a mutant baby fetish. However, I found the shower scene in the beginning slightly vulgar. That being said, 4 stars.",1317168000,,154,4.344827586206897
8477007,5,B005KMKENG,"A saga of epic proportions... well not really. To be blunt, it's weird. As the tagline reads ""Paul jerked off in the shower. Paul just impregnated his bath tub."", from that alone you know it's not going to be your typical short film.

Sure the concept sounds a bit fishy, but the script has been written in such a way that you believe every minute of it. The emotions are made so real you can't help feeling sympathy for Paul and his hideous disaster we may call a baby, not to mention his girlfriend. The relationships portrayed in this short are also pretty believable, it seems that Paul and his girlfriend are the ypical young adult couple who've been dating for a few years. But what really sells this short is how Paul reacts to the baby, his whole world gets turned upside down. Although a tub baby has never landed in my lap, I know I would react in just the same manor as he did.

If you're one for a odd, but emotionally enticing short watch this, it's worth your time.",1316736000,,979,4.344262295081967
8477008,4,B005KMKENG,"TUB is a shortfilm about a guy who impregnates his bathtub while masturbating in the shower. How can that NOT be a good film?

What I really liked about this film was the way everything looked. It had a sleak style to it where a lot of shots were centered wich i kind of like becuase the feeling i got when i watched it and the shots were centered made the whole experience a little more disturbing, and disturbing was one of the feeling i was hoping to get from the film, and i did.

At first I was like, woah, I knew what the film was about, but I did not expect it to be shown to me like that. After a little while, I started feeling the main characters feelings and the ending actullay touched me a LOT when I kind of realized what I think the film meant. I even think I made an ""Aaaaahaa"" sound at that moment.

I also liked the directing, the actors did a good job. They were pretty believable, but I felt like the were missing a little bit. That might have been what Bobby Miller was aiming for, but I felt like they were a little bit empty, both of them. Like they weren't thinking anything. If that was the goal, then oh my god, they did a HECK of a job.

In the end, this is not a salespitch, it's a review, I've reviewed it. You don't have to buy it if you don't want to, but I liked it, it made me feel SO many things during the whole shortfilm. And when a film (not even a feature length film) can make me feel MORE than 3 emotions during the time i watch it, then it's a good screenplay in my book.

8477009,5,B005KMKENG,"When you first hear the plot, it sounds very crazy. Dont let that drive you away, the film actually takes the plot very seriously. It was very well filmed, edited and the effects... that is a whole other story. Bobby Miller did a very good job at directing this, from seeing his other work I can tell that it was HIM that made this work, if you got someone else to do it they probably would have played up for laughs or gross out humor. Bobby makes the protagonist's situation feel very real and the things he do very relatable. I think I actually teared up a little at the end. and now on the the effects, where do I start. First off the effects were eerie, I was surprised, shocked and amazed at the same time. What I like about the effects are they don't show too much of it. I think they showed just enough to get the picture but not enough to start seeing that it is just effects. You can tell that Bobby put a lot of work into this film and it shows. All in all Tub is very well done movie and deserved to win at the Sundance Film Festival. Here is to seeing more of Bobby Miller's work in the future.",1315180800,,1107,4.08256880733945
8477010,5,B005KMKENG,"I just watched tub. There were scenes that honestly made me feel like vomiting, but in the end there was something that made me like it. The movie was really well made in a weird messed up kind of way. I think I would buy the DVD just for the extras.",1315180800,,250,3.9215686274509802
8477011,4,B005KMKENG,"I had been following Bobby Miller's work since his first web series, Best Short Films in the World, and he always was a fun guy to watch and engaged with his fans well. So when I first heard about him trying to make TUB it had me excited because he was so passionate about it, which makes me wonder how much of a true story it could be based on.

Anyways, when it came out and was getting into great festivals left and right, I was excited for it to come closer, and finally it came to the Dallas International Film Festival which was my first festival I'd ever been too, mostly just because I wanted to see TUB. Thanks to TUB I got the great experience of a festival, and as a film student that was great for me....almost as great as TUB. TUB was a fun, kinda dark and weird tale, but incredibly awesomely acted and I love the shots as well.

As for this DVD, I'll admit I bought it before it was on Amazon and had the cool disc art, but it is the same stuff on the disc. TUB is just as great as it was on a big screen, and the special features like the fan made TUB 2 trailer makes me happy as well as shows how great of a following Bobby has (yes you may be all by yourself in your room, but we do love you lol) as well as video of Bobby at Sundance which is cool to watch because I feel like if I got into Sundance, that's kind of how I'd feel/act.

Anyways, buy this. Its really cool and a great short film and the perfect story for that. Plus, it has a kinda creepy animatronic TUB baby which is cool and odd. Also Bobby seems to still have the creepy latex baby face with him, and that's worrisome.",1315094400,,1605,3.9937694704049846
8477012,4,B005KMKENG,"Caught this s&*% when I was at the LA shorts fest and I was like ""DAAAANNNNGGGG oh no he didn't just do that in the shower"". Kept me on the edge of my monkey-fightin seat when he looked through the milky stuff in the tub; then I was like ""no don't take that lil man to work with chu, you trippin homie."" Best one of da whole shorts fest fo' real. I met B-dizzle afterwards and I was like ""F yeah you the nig from the real good show right? I been creeping on you since Indy Mogul. that was some straight up good cinema."" can't wait to see what Big-Bobby gone do next fo' real. I'm from H-town Texas brotha and this movie made my entire trip to california wort it.",1315094400,,662,4.0227272727272725
8477013,5,B005KMKENG,"Bobby Miller's TUB is a work of art. The filmmaker's style and the tone that is given out throughout the film is fantastically done. I don't think that it falls short in any way and keeps you 100% into the story. The baby was shown the perfect ammount. Not too much and not too little. I'd compare Bobby Miller's style to the works of Sam Raimi (The Evil Dead) because of his brilliant visual style, Tom Six (The Human Centipede) for his amazing talent for making a film that is so out there and different that you just can't look away, David Cronenberg (The Fly, Naked Lunch, Videodrome), I think that nothing else really needs to be said there. I would even go as far to say there are elements of Kubrick in Miller's work (wheather they be simply homages or rip offs).

Bottom line, TUB is a fantastic piece of work that sadly will not be seen enough. It surprises me (and sadens me) that Miller is not directing in the main stream movies on a much larger budget. From looking at his previous short and student films (Losing It, The Trouble With Cloning, Spitsville etc) Bobby Miller shows a lot of promise, so I hope to see him either break into the main stream soon or go on to make another short film like TUB that will play at film festivals and go to DVD.

Actors, Eric M. Levy and Megan Raye Manzi are both fantastic and naturalistic. Manzi's performance as Emily is done so well. In the scene where Emily waits for Paul in the office after the bathroom scene, when Paul walks out with the baby and simply leaves, you can litterally see the actress's art breaking at that moment and it could not be more perfect. Also, the scene where Eric M. Levy puts his hand in the gew early on in the film, his reaction is pricless and perfectly directed by Bobby Miller.

As far as a feature version of TUB goes, the first time I watched TUB I felt like it was a condensed version of what could be a fantastic full length film, however on multiple viewings, I feel it is better to be the way it is. I am interested to read the feature screenplays I've heard Bobby has written but don't know where to find them.

To conclude, I thought that TUB was one of (if not the best) short films I've ever seen (in all honesty). Bobby Miller is by far my favourite SHORT filmmaker of all time. I can't wait to see what he does next. I just wish he'd put a lot more effort into more short films like TUB rather than doing web series like That Movie Show. I think if he reall has the confidence and ideas then Bobby Miller could go on to make a brilliant first feature film.",1315094400,2,2558,4.268041237113402
8477014,4,B005KMKENG,"I've been a fan of Bobby Miller's stuff since Best Short Films In The World and it's really cool to finally see a film made by the man himself.

I'm in my last year of high school and next year I'm going off to film school and its great to see someones idea become a reality and then to witness it gaining success and getting into Sundance.

The idea is brilliant (very unique)  and its told in a very dark, creative and hilarious way. I hope Bobby can keep making short films or move on to a feature!

Anyway its an entertaining short film and I recommend watching it!

P.S. I had to omit a few sentences because of the lude themes of the film...
