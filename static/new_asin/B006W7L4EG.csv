5022270,4,B006W7L4EG,"Amanda Burton carries herself well in the second season.

Without giving too much away, I can state clearly that most of the dramas are significantly better than the first season, primarily because it was missing much of the drama. The earlier shows were a little too involved with her personal life and its dilemas, errors and catastrophes.

The set appeared to build on the first series, again developing charachters and focusing more on the case loads than the bedroom. To think that a woman of this level in an organisation such as this would have such a repeatedly self destructive personal life is almost beyond comprehension, and that's what stopped it getting five stars.

The plus points in the series were that the acting was generally high quality, the sets accurate and believable, the storylines [excluding the personal life] sellable to the viewer.

It makes a good change from the standard fare NYPD blue, CSI, NCIS that is often available.

Silent Witness was a better effort on the part of Ms. Burton, not because of any deficiency of talent or application of craft, but the storylines were simply so much better crafted.

Overall I'm not sorry I bought these, but they will sit on the shelf for a while before [if] being watched again.

I struggled to give 4 stars overall, but felt three stars were a bit stingy. If you like the personal drama intertwined with the caseloads, you migh want to give it more.",1340582400,7,1425,4.7682926829268295
5022271,2,B006W7L4EG,I own a number of British Series.  Commander Set 1 and Set 2 along with An Unsuitable Job for a Woman are probably three of the less desirable to buy.  I did not think that that women with such power could be so weak.,1339200000,2,217,3.909090909090909
5022272,5,B006W7L4EG,"Amanda Blake returns to command 4 final feature-length crime mysteries with her usual toughness, pudginess, terseness, & non-compassion. Played by Amanda Burton, she wants DCI James [Mark Lewis Jones] to `think of her as your mentor.' James called her `frost-on-legs' behind her back. But together they fight tough crimes filled with violence, graphic scenes, blood, and language. So limit the kids in this fast moving, yet finely woven and written intrigue. Better than set 1. Blake has her emotions in check, almost, until the end. A host of guest stars join 3-episode DS Hall [Paul Brightwell] with that character being a primary focus in the final episode.

8505391,1,B006W7L4EG,"Commander set 1 was borderline good, but with unbelievable behavior of a senior police officer.

In set 2 the main character, the commander, was very different from the one in set 1 and the stories were not believable.  No police officers would remain in their jobs if their behavior were like that of the characters in this set of stories.

I will not recommend this series to anybody, in spite of the fact ? that the series was popular in England.",1398211200,,449,4.518518518518518
