7889305,5,6305425558,"This is a KARAOKE DVD+video.  I like this disk because it is a Karaoke disk with video and not just graphics.  You must play this disk in a Karaoke player for it to work properly.  You can play it with tracking vocals or without.  It allows two microphones for the male and female, or either with the other part played in the opposite channel.  A must own DVD+V fan!",1133654400,,366,4.246376811594203
