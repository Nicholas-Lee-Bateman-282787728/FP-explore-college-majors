7882120,4,6305057052,"I bought this DVD after my 2nd graders read a book about building bridges.  When they found out I had been inside a dam, they went nuts and I decided to try and find something that they could have part of the experience I had.

I was amazed that my 17 chatterboxes sat quietly and actually paid attention to what was going on.  The fact that they got to go back in time and watch the actual construction in black and white film was wonderful.  The only thing that would've made this DVD better was a little more footage of Hoover Dam today.",1232236800,13,540,4.213592233009709
