8668042,4,B00LTTUD58,"Musically, this concert is quite enjoyable, of course -- especially considering the superb level of talent involved in the project. However, I was thoroughly disappointed with the camerawork by those in the video production crew; it was absolutely lousy, unprofessional, and just terrible! I mean, who wants and/or needs to see Carlos switching guitars while one of the incredible musicians in the band is pouring his heart and soul out into a solo?!? It's disappointing, really.",1419897600,,479,5.315789473684211

8668044,5,B00LTTUD58,This was a great show because of the meaning of it. Everyday in news you hear about all the drugs and killings in Mexico. What you don't hear is the beauty and the fantastic music that comes from Mexico. Carlos Santana created this project to show Latin music at it's best performed by some great Latin artists. Showing diversity of different styles. The whole show was about love and music. This DVD/CD combo is the only place where you can get the CD version of the show. Otherwise the import version of the Cd is like almost $40 that's a lot to pay for a single live CD. Great quality sound and video makes you feel live you were there and the interviews touch the heart.,1414713600,,674,4.357142857142857
8668045,5,B00LTTUD58,"Great performance by Santana, brought back beautiful memories from his most recent concert.  He still has the magic guitar touch.  Highly recommend it",1412812800,,150,5.478260869565218
