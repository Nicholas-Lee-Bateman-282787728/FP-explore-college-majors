4390960,5,B004JA99XG,Spike Lee captures the truth about what happened in New Orleans years after Katrina hit.  This documentary shows the struggles that the people of the community faced and how they are adapting to life after the disaster. Another masterpiece by Spike Lee.,1308873600,,253,5.023809523809524
4390961,5,B004JA99XG,"You'll laugh, cry and get MAD AS HELL, as you watch the incredible 2-part, 4-hour absolutely fascinating documentary about the aftermath of Hurrican Katrina and the horrendous and unforgivable BP oil catastrophe!

From the many problems and con jobs connected to the corrupt Bush-Cheney administration and their cronies before and after Hurricane Katrina, to the inexcusable and unconscionable BP oil disaster, Lee speaks critically, but fairly to the good guys and the bad. Just as the people of New Orleans and surrounding areas were starting to recover from nature's Hurricane Katrina (and poorly-built levees, etc.), they have to contend with a man-made disaster of horrendous proportions, the BP oil tsunami. That most of them can keep going in the face of all this adversity is commendable in itself!

Good work, Spike Lee and HBO! ""If God Is Willing and Da Creek Don't Rise"" should be seen be everyone who is concerned about the welfare of humanity and this planet.",1301356800,12,972,5.1069182389937104
4390962,5,B004JA99XG,"There is a reason Spike Lee is one of the most provocative American film directors. This is it. If you still believe the government is there to help Americans in time of crisis and disaster you need to see this film. Post Katrina New Orleans is a microcosm of capitalism and the free-market. They have no public school system, historic homes are eminent domained to make way for a ""new"" downtown, a perfectly good hospital is shuttered, all in the name of rebuilding. Meanwhile five years later hundreds of former Crescent City residents are still unable to return home, an offense to every American. This film is a must see. The best documentary of 2010.",1297728000,17,655,4.7043478260869565
4390963,5,B004JA99XG,"Many of us continue to hold sacred, 9/11 and ground zero which is being rebuilt every day. After watching this documentary, I was left with the feeling that somehow these Americans of the Gulf have simply been forgotten and those displaced still have no way to return home. This is the TRUE story of our America in the Gulf, and how it is being dismantled with one disaster after another. This has to change.",1282694400,23,408,4.527027027027027

4390967,5,B004JA99XG,"This documentary is such a brilliant follow up to ""When the Levees Broke"": it makes even clearer the manipulations, thefts, deceits and cold-bloodedness of the ""fat cats"" who wanted to make New Orleans over for themselves and for continued ""gentrification"" of the city. Spike Lee is a cinematic genius of contemporary history and his documentaries speak the truth about how all kinds of different systems, including George W. Bush's administration, local NO government, various govt. agencies and numerous private companies who were contracted by those agencies, were guided by the tenets of  white supremacy which continues to marginalize and brutalize poor Black folks in this country.

Anyone who claims that we live in a ""post-racial"" era in this country is blind, deaf and stupid.",1426896000,3,785,5.32258064516129

4390969,5,B004JA99XG,"I thought this was one of the best documentaries Ive seen in my lifetime. What a tradgedy the hurricane in New Orleans but the bigger tradegy was how our US goverment responded. WE can rescue every country on the planet ,but we let our own people to fend for themselves in impossible curcumstances,and perish. This was a dark moment in US history, not that it happened but how our goverment chose to respond, (not respond). Sad but enlightening",1417478400,2,444,4.705128205128205

4390974,5,B004JA99XG,"A sad but engrossing update on how developers are taking advantage of a tragedy to eliminate large sections of the New Orleans populous. It had been felt for years that politicians wanted to get rid of the black majority in this creole NOT Cajun city. And unfortunately it looks like they are succeeding by abolishing Charity Hospital, the 2nd largest hospital in the states and not rebuilding the 9th Ward.",1386633600,2,407,4.828571428571428

4390976,3,B004JA99XG,"The DVD was okay...but if you have not seen When The Levees Failed (or whatever it is by Spike Lee), you should buy that instead; much, much better than this. Even the National Geographic documentary was better than this one. I enjoyed it because I am bonded to New Orleans and the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Unless have the same perspective, you probably could do without seeing this",1369008000,,381,4.701492537313433
4390977,5,B004JA99XG,"I don't think any director could've done a better job covering this sensitive subject. It is educating, unbelievable, and unforgettable. It should be mandatory for every American to watch and appreciate our Southern neighbors, especially the politicians. When will more people rise up for what is right?!",1365120000,,304,5.48936170212766
4390978,5,B004JA99XG,"As a New Orleans resident, I am always skeptical of how the city is portrayed, but Spike Lee did such a good job of talking to so many of the wonderfully different folks who call New Orleans home. Everyone who cares about New Orleans should own this DVD.",1360368000,,254,4.3125

4390980,5,B004JA99XG,I think this movie does a great job at showing what really happened. I had to watch this for my class and I can honestly say this is one of the films where I still mention it to this day.,1355875200,,187,3.7
4390981,5,B004JA99XG,"Every American should own a copy of When the Levees Broke and If God is Willing and Da Creek Don't Rise, especially those living along the vulnerable Gulf Coast and Atlantic seaboard - otherwise known as prime Hurricane territory. It's hard to imagine living through one of the worst disasters in the history of the region and then sitting back and watching as your government and its leaders bicker over the best way to throw you a half-rotten bone. The people of New Orleans deserved better, and these films acknowledge that it is their spirit and will that is making things better, not some name Hollywood helper. Creek is easily one of the best documentaries ever made, Lee's amazing effort earns 5 stars. Not just for the technical elements, mind you. No, something this important deserves to be seen by as many people as possible. We nearly lost New Orleans six years ago. Here's hoping that Spike Lee's motion picture masterpieces shames some people into finally trying to fix things - before it really is too late.",1321142400,3,1022,4.779661016949152
4390982,5,B004JA99XG,Spike Lee did a wonderful job as usual with this documentary. He hit every point and covered every aspect not holding anything back.,1317081600,,132,4.782608695652174
4390983,4,B004JA99XG,"Judge Adam Arseneau, DVD Verdict-- Time may have numbed the sense of public outcry and desperation of the Hurricane Katrina fiasco, but it may just make If God Is Willing and da Creek Don't Rise a more important film than When The Levees Broke for this very reason. The twenty-four-hour news channels may have long since moved onto juicer stories, but that doesn't mean that New Orleans has recovered from its horrible ordeal. Spike Lee wants audiences to be fully and painfully aware of this fact. We have all seen the reality, but few outside of the Crescent City see the recovery.

Director Spike Lee and his crew return to New Orleans in 2010 and find a city overrun by the Who Dat nation, basking in exuberance from its recent Super Bowl victory. Abandoned storefronts and wreckage in the streets have been replaced by singing, dancing, and public displays of drunken affection and heavy tourism. At first glance, one might think that New Orleans is back, restored magically to its former glory from the sheer force of will of thousands of football fans, but, alas, it is not the case. New Orleans is a city deeply divided by conflict, financial uncertainty, and gentrification in the wake of Katrina, reeling from a BP oil spill in the Gulf choking the lifeblood of the economy. Competing visions of how to rebuild the city, with debates raging from healthcare to real estate threaten to tear the community in two. Corruption permeates every level of public life, from the police on the street to the bureaucrats above.

And yet there is hope, sprinkled like seeds on a farmer's field. Five years have not healed Katrina's wounds, but the film admires the sheer stubborn optimism of New Orleans, a city that never gives up. This time around, rage has given way to wary optimism, though Spike Lee still projects his natural suspicion of the cultural and social institutions that continue to fail African-Americans. (Hey, it wouldn't be a Spike Lee Joint any other way.)

As with the previous film, HBO puts together a handsome package for the home viewer. The film is presented in two acts, each on its own DVD. Lee shoots the city and edits the film with care and affection, creating a kind of ethereal beauty amidst the wreckage. Assembled from interview footage, archival elements and still photographs, If God Is Willing and da Creek Don't Rise looks fantastic on DVD. Colors are vibrant, flesh tones are well-balanced, and black levels are solid. Some grain is evident, but it never detracts. In an era of 1080p, the detail and fidelity of this SD presentation is top-grade.

Audio comes in a full 5.1 surround treatment, which sounds clean and crisp but fails to take advantage of the full sonic space. Rear channels go largely unutilized, and bass response is average at best. The detail and fidelity is superb, but even the musical cues and ambient noises fail to deliver the kind of presentation this film demands.

Extras include a full-length commentary track with director Spike Lee, who does his best to fill up the four-hour film with observations and commentary, but who cannot help but fall into silence now and again. A 60-minute featurette of additional material is also included, featuring never-before-seen material.

8431815,5,B004JA99XG,This is extremely enlightening. It starts off all about football but evolves into a very thorough follow up and post-mortem of some aspects of governmental failures and injustices. Highly recommended for all.
