Any parent with an interest in teaching their young child the basics of reading should include this in their collection of educational material!!",1248652800,,322,4.551724137931035
8214797,5,B000UUAVA4,"Duck and Dog- Word Discovery was a great dvd, if you're trying to teach your child sight words and/or how to read, this dvd will definitely help your child, and entertain it too! Not only can it help your child read, but it will make your child smile just looking at the cleverly designed characters, who have unique voices and personalties. Yet again I will say, this was a great dvd for any child learning to read!",1188000000,3,416,4.415584415584416
