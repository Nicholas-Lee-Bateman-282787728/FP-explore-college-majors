Kei, the main character, turns out to be more than he seems.  To say anything else would give away much of the plot, but I would suggest at least watching this DVD once.
Get it used or rent it, but don't buy it unless you like robots, alien invasions or weird X-File like plots.",1073001600,3,522,4.427083333333333
7955050,1,B00005UQ6C,"Man, oh man. I wasted ninety minutes of my life for THIS!? Yeah, all the other reviews say the same thing doesn't it? Well, there is one thing want to clear up. This title does NOT have a confusing storyline. Okay, this is all you need to know: A boy joins a secret military organization called Spirits to avoid school and follow a cute girl. His sister gets mad and joins Spirits too (gee, don't they have high standards). When they arrive, they are informed that Spirits actually a training center for the mecha Devadasy, which is humanity's (guess what?) last hope. Well, there is one catch. The Devadasy runs on sexual power. Yes, you heard me. The pilot becomes aroused from the fighting and transfer his sexual vibes onto the female, which orgasms support humanity's last hope (at least De:Vadasy lives up to its name, a devadasy is a Hindu cultic prostitute). Anno Kei (whoa) is the boy. Even though the story is weird in the first place, something else came up that REALLY troubled me. Anno Kei has half of the personality that Ikari Shinji from EVA has. And that, folks, is NOT a good thing in any possible way. Aside from the sexual ""tension"" in the robot, a bunch of sex scenes follows outside the robot. It's as if a producer from Japan got bored one day and said ""Hey, what happens if we make an EVA-clone, but instead of the Judeo-Christianity, we use the Kama Sutra?"" Puh-leeze. People, stick to your Evangelion, RahXephon and Pilot Candidate, believe me, you'll be much better off.",1050883200,2,1497,4.610486891385768
7955051,3,B00005UQ6C,"Taking place after an alien attack on the Earth in 2012, a teenage boy named Kei and his girlfriend Naoki are recruited by a government orginization called Spirits to operate the Evangelon-looking mecha, Devadasy. It takes a male and female pilot to operate it, and lucky Kei has his pick from several sexy candidates to choose from as his partner since he's the only male pilot. He has a strong attraction toward the silent Amala who shares a secret link to his late father. Devadasy actually works on the sexual energy between its two pilots, which almost sounds like its a hentai video, but its not. They must use Devadasy to clense the Earth of the alien infestation which are like huge bacteria monsters, because an even larger force the size of a solar system are coming towards Earth! This 3-episode series has some decent animation and unique storytelling. Recommended!",1041292800,2,877,4.8533333333333335
7955052,1,B00005UQ6C,"After reading the back of the DVD case in suncoast I was kinda looking forward to seeing this, but let me tell you this was really not good at all. The Story is kinda hard to follow and really didn't get me interested at all. The action sequences were not all that good at all. The music was mediocre at best. This is an anime that you should rent and in all honesty never buy. In my opinion it is one of the worst anime's I have ever seen.",1031270400,,440,3.955056179775281
7955053,2,B00005UQ6C,"When I saw this movie in the store I was very excited.  I thought it looked great.  But after purchasing I was reminded to never judge a Book(or in this case an Anime) by it's cover.  The story line was short and confusing with the first episode consisting only of flash backs and flash forwards.  The plot was almost nonexistent, what little plot there was came across as a jerky halfhearted Evangelion copy without any of the redeeming features.  The sound effects were poor and the action scenes while animated well made up less than 10 minutes of the 90 minute run time.
Over all this is definately a DVD to rent and not buy.  Or if you can't find someplace to rent it you should fell glad you won't be tempted to waste a portion of your life.  If you feel the need to occupy 90 minutes of your time you would be better suited to watch the dust on your TV screen and try to decide if it affects the sound quality for 90 minutes.",1023667200,5,932,4.231638418079096
