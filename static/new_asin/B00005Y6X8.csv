7956326,4,B00005Y6X8,If you are a John Grisham fan you will enjoy this interpretation of his novel. This movie is worth watching.,1357689600,,108,4.45
7956327,1,B00005Y6X8,"After the Fourth Reich captures and implants a computer chip in the brain of John Shea and soon after Shea leaps off a bridge, gets shot and hits water, does soon after his brother, played by Patrick Bergin (Eye Of The Beholder), assume his brother's identity to continue the investigation. Bergin gets help from other agent, played by Virginia Madsen (Sideways, Candyman, The Florentine) and they risk love, identies and lives to undercover the details behind the Fourth Riech. Not much here but a overlong snoozer with cardboard performances by all 3...especially Madsen who doesnt show the goods here. The Apocalypse Watch sinks in the water Shea jumped into in that one scene where he died...yeah.",1125360000,5,701,5.051724137931035
7956328,1,B00005Y6X8,"The Apocalypse watch is great!--to make fun of.  In this yarn that drags us into the depths of a world in which the CIA HQ is sometimes in Langley, and sometimes in Britain, all armed guards are mentally retarded, the script is riddled with errors only a complete idiot could miss in the proofread, and there are enough continuity errors to make a mathemitician explode. The story has all of the feel of a perfectly good story that was spliced and the scenes played in random order right after another.  For instance, one moment the new main character (you'll find out what i mean if you watch it) is crying, and the next moment he's doing his flashy-eyed-cute pose.  Terrible.  Now, my friend Quinn Woodhouse would like to give his opinion.

  A movie where a main character can be replaced by his brother should be shot out of a cannon and punch the face of the moon. when you combine nazis with bad story, anything can happen. i would rate this film with a ten in make-fun-of-ability. this film also defies physics, where a person can drive a car from the czech republic to britain. (evidently there is a bridge connecting britain and the mainland). the axiom of crisis management is to never panic, and these people never do--even when they're being shot at.",1103673600,9,1262,4.607142857142857
