8061681,5,B0009IWFSS,Older version dating back to early 90s but very informative. We purchased for an upcoming educational field trip.,1424995200,,113,5.333333333333333
8061682,4,B0009IWFSS,"My 8 year old son enjoyed this video and it was helpful for all of our family to be prepared for what we were going to see on our vacation stop at the cave.  Informative and accurate, it assuaded my youngest son's concerns about bats attacking us (implanted in his head by his older brothers).  It does come across as a bit dated in appearance, but it's not like much changes happen at the cave so I can see why they don't spend more money to update it.  This National Park is a wonderful place, with wonderful staff and a value for the experience.  Highly recommend a visit to Mammoth Cave.",1378166400,,591,4.297297297297297
