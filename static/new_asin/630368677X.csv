713305,5,630368677X,I actually saw this at the theater when it first came out. I nearly wet my pants laughing. It's a little dated in styles now but still just as funny as ever. I'm sure everyone can relate to some of the scenes. One of my all time favorite movies and I am waiting to buy it on DVD!,1019520000,4,279,3.8275862068965516
713306,5,630368677X,"If properly promoted, this comedy would have been a major hit.  I'm hoping and waiting for a DVD as are 3 others that I know of.  Everyone that I have shown my VHS tape of it, loves the movie.  In fact I've had this tape floating around with my movie buff friends for a long time and I'm sorry that it is showing its age.  I'm just afraid that this is one of those wonderful movies that are going to get lost forever.  Watching it once just doesn't allow the viewer to catch all of the spoofs on life.  It's even more enjoyable after a second and third time, because of it.",1017792000,7,573,4.071428571428571
713307,4,630368677X,"See Dick.  See Jane.  See Dick and Jane live beyond their means by using credit cards.  See Dick get laid off from his aerospace executive job during a downturn in the economy.  See Dick not get a new job because he is overqualified.  See Jane not get a new job because she is underqualified.  See Dick go on welfare.  See creditors move in on the family of Dick and Jane.  See Jane make sacrifices.  See Jane quit the Book-of-the-Month Club and let the pool go unheated.  See Dick get the idea that robbing drugstores, supermarkets and the telephone company would be a good way of getting money to feed Jane and the kids.  Steal Dick!  Steal Jane!  See Dick and Jane turn the tables on the evil boss who fired Dick.  See Dick and Jane live happily every after.
George Segal plays Dick and Jane Fonda plays, well, Jane, in this 1977 comedy directed by Ted Kotcheff.  Of course ""Fun with Dick and Jane"" is a less than subtle attack on the vulgarity of the American middle-class.  The comedy comes from seeing the trouble Dick and Jane have in dealing with being poor; apparently it is easier to function with nothing if you never had anything in the first place.  My favorite scenes are when Dick and Jane's unpaid for front lawn is repossessed by the local nursery and when the aspiring robbers are applauded by customers when they rob the phone company.  Segal and Fonda are both fine in comic performances that play to their strong suits, and Ed McMahon takes an interesting ""dramatic"" as Dick's boss, who not only fires our hero but who also has been skimming money from the company.  Maybe that is the source of all that Publishers Clearinghouse money.  ""Fun with Dick and Jane"" is one of the better social comedies about the ""Great Recession"" of the late Seventies.",1013817600,16,1770,4.5587301587301585
713308,5,630368677X,"This is certainly my favorite show for both George Segal and Jane Fonda. They are marvelous as folks trying to make ends meet (by hook OR crook) in the face of unemployment. Their hijinks are very funny, as they exhaust ALL  the possibilities for humor in the search for employment and  solvency.
Especially memorable are the fashion show, the celebratory  dinner (with food stamp inspector), and the performance of Carmen. But good  spots in this film are too frequent to cite!

713422,5,630368677X,"There's nothing like an original, especially when it's this well done.  Sorry Mr. Carrey, but your remake was close to a dud.  Not even the great looks and added comedic talent of Tea Leoni could salvage this from a made-for-direct-to-DVD listing.  George Segal and Jane Fonda did a much more convincing job of portraying the set-upon-suburbanites and their zany attempts to reclaim their spot in the Upper Middle Class Echelons.  McMahon plays a fine, leacherous, money-grubbing exec who could care less about his help.  From ""Zlute"" to ""Barbarella"" to ""Comes A Horseman"" Fonda makes whatever role she's in something you care about.  (Okay; ""Barbarella"" was a stretch...)
So if Jim Carrey's antics are what makes you laugh, so be it.  I just wish he'd have had less funny looks and a MUCH funnier script to work with.
If fun and frolic with two great actors is what you'd prefer, go for the original~!  Also, the sight gags are wonderful!",1470873600,3,939,4.861635220125786

  It's a great visit to the 70's. A time I don't remember much myself because I was only about 7 when the movie came out, but it's not hard to see how anyone would have a crush on Jane Fonda. She is funny, classy and very sexy.

 The movie does a great job in getting you to feel for a couple of Spoiled, Rich white folk that really don't deserve your sympathy even if they really didn't do anything wrong other then live life on the hog.

713829,2,630368677X,"Fun with Dick and Jane, 1977 film

Dick and Jane graduated from college and get married. Dick is an engineer at an aerospace company. Its been a rough year. [Was the budget cut by Congress?] Charlie has news for Dick. He is serious! Mr. Harper leaves. [Were there no rumors in advance?] Was this couple spending way too much? Can they cut back? Bounced checks result in landscape changes. Jane puts up a front for her neighbors. [That $77,000 value dates this movie.] Dick visits the unemployment office and applies for food stamps. [Now called SNAP.] He visits a bar and learns new facts. Jane tries working as a model but makes a misstep. Dick's friend visits and offers a job. [That $30,000 pay dates this movie.] Can Dick work ""of the books""? Will somebody see him? Jane visits her parents to tell about her problem. ""Self-reliant"" is his principle. ""I'm so happy for you"" says her Mom.

Does adversity test a person? [Do you like surprise exams?] Applying for a loan does. There is a dramatic event. The police shoot at the robbers, but they get away. Jane thinks fast and profits. ""I can't believe we're talking this way."" Finders-keepers? The inspector from the food stamp program arrives for a surprise visit. Can they make the mortgage payment? [Does crime increase in a recession?] Will Dick become desperate? Their son watches a western movie on TV. [Why don't they show them on TV anymore?] Dick uses the ""two-car method"" for his part-time work. A druggist offers help. [Censorship here?] There is another attempt at a bar. [Is this still funny?] They stop at a motel for a quick withdrawal. [Is that record shop product placement?] Next the telephone company. [Was this funny?] There is a visit to a preacher who talks about raising money. A crowd of people grab for loose cash in the street. [Does this remind you of a story about Jesse James?]

Are bribes part of ""doing business""? Dick and Jane get an idea for a new job. They visit a party at the aerospace company. Dick has brought along his tool kit. Jane learned a trick while dancing. What if the office is guarded? What if people party in the empty offices? Jane has a delicate touch. It is a big haul! There is a surprise in the elevator. The guard sees the open door! Security guards stand by the exit doors. But Jane drops a dime and help arrives. The last message tells what happened. Charles is out, Dick is in. [Can you believe this ending?]

I suppose this parody of the ""American Dream"" seemed funny to many. ""Work hard and become successful"" is still the ideal for most people, even if from inherited wealth. Production creates wealth, although some use other means. Do things always work out as you hope? This movie tells you what was considered a comedy in that era.

The devaluation of the dollar by Nixon in August 1971 marked the end of the prosperous 1960s. Then wages accounted for about 50% of the GDP. Currently wages are about 40% of the GDP. People are getting less in wages and paying more in prices and taxes. The devaluation of the currency by the Federal Reserve results in less wealth for working people. With a 6% devaluation per year, your $100 is only worth $94 by year's end; and what you bought for $94 now costs $100! This transfers immense wealth from the many to the few. They won't tell you about this in the corporate media (talk shows, reality TV, local newspapers). You can check it out.",1363046400,,3396,4.5881383855024716

George Segal plays Dick Harper who is a high powered executive who suddenly finds himself unemployed.  Segal plays Harper with a comic flair.  Segal was nominated for a supporting Oscar for ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?""  Playing opposite of him is 7-time Oscar nominee and two time winner Jane Fonda.

One scene where Jane is on the toilet and talks matter-of-factly to her husband brought home how domestic the comedy is.  Her scene as model at a banquet is as hilarious as it is disastrous.  Ed McMahon who recently passed played the boss Charlie Blanchard who fires Dick and lies to Congress.  The twist at the end leaves a smile on your face.  A couple cameo performances are especially sweet for me.  Hank Garcia in his only credited role that I know of played Raoul Esteban, the streetwise new friend of Dick.  Robert Lussier who played on TV shows like ""Bewitched"" turns in a funny cameo as the unemployment clerk.

713971,4,630368677X,"Long before Jim Carey starred in the remake, George Segal and Jane Fonda played the roles.  Dick and Jane have an ideal life until Dick loses his job.  As Dick's quest for a suitable new job drags on, the two must start to face the facts of just how bad their financial situation is.  Their lawn has been repossessed and other creditors are banging on their door.  But things change for the better when they are in a loan office that gets robbed.  Jane pockets some of the stolen money.  Suddenly Dick and Jane know how they can get more.  It takes a while to get started but finally their criminal career begins and money is flowing in.  Things are looking good.

But then one of their jobs goes a little wrong and they have to abandon their take in order to escape.  The close call makes then give up their new criminal ways.  But only for a bit.  The opportunity rises to get back at Dick's boss and score a huge take.  A little planning, some training, and the new game is afoot.  Of course there are complications but Dick and Jane manage to rise to the occasion.  As the tag line states, they lost everything and now they are stealing it back.

I had forgotten much of this film since I saw it decades ago.  I was surprised to see how close the remake was to this original (i.e. the repossessed lawn and immigration trouble).  But like with The Thomas Crown Affair, the original had a grittier ending.  There is some harsh language but no nudity (although Fonda does use the toilet while talking to Segal).  Segal and Fonda are delightful to watch as they go through their various disguises.  Segal may not be as clownish as Carey but he carries the role very well and Fonda comes across as a much more competent Jane (despite being a homemaker to Tea Leoni's office worker).  Strong acting and good comedy make this just as good as the remake although less wacky.  Check it out.",1175126400,2,1885,4.4
713972,4,630368677X,"Things were really tough in the mid and late-1970s.  All around the country companies were laying people off.  Union workers went on strike only to have their jobs given to scabs.  Gas prices shot up at an incredible rate.  Meanwhile, rich executives retired with huge bonuses or bankrupted their companies through seeming legal embezzling.  FUN WITH DICK AND JANE is a social comedy commenting about everyone's foibles.

Dick Harper (George Segal) is an executive aeronautic engineer at an important company, Taft Aerospace.  Dick has paid his dues.  He has risen through the ranks and is on the verge of becoming a top man in the company.  Dick's also a nice guy who is living beyond his means.  He and his family live in a really nice home and only have the best of everything.  When he goes to meet his boss, Charlie Blanchard (Ed McMahon), he's expecting to get a promotion.  Instead, he gets fired.  It's later revealed that Charlie has been tipping from the till and had to cut corners somehow.  Dick and his beloved wife Jane (Jane Fonda) think that they will be able to get by, but they soon learn that getting a job is much more difficult than keeping one and that it's a lot easier to be poor if you already more than it is to become poor.  An unexpected turn of events reveals to the couple how easy stealing money can be and soon Dick and Jane become a couple of wealthy thieves set on getting back at the man who caused all their misfortunes to begin with, Charlie Blanchard.

FUN WITH DICK AND JANE is a movie from the 1970s, but unlike many films of the era it has aged rather well (and thus was ripe for remaking).  Some of the jokes won't make much sense anymore, such as when the couple robs the phone company only to be applauded by the customers.  George Segal fits quite well in the shoes of Dick Harper while Jane Fonda actually displays that she had a little bit of talent (in fact, this is the movie that revitalized Fonda's career).

I enjoyed watching FUN WITH DICK AND JANE.  It's a short and fun film.  For a bit of trivia, look for Jay Leno's film debut as a carpenter working at the floor of the Harper home about four minutes into the film.",1170028800,,2172,4.434343434343434

It's more like a dream sequence. The humor is dated and many jokes fall so flat you hardly realize they are attempts at humor.  Despite this, the array of 70s interiors, furnishing, and autos was interesting and brought back repressed (for obvious aesthetic reasons) memories from my childhood. 70s must be the worst design and fashion decade ever, totally off the reservation.

Anyway, Ed McMahon give an interesting performance, definitely not the straight man he's ubiquitously known as.  However, one can see the story had potential, and timeliness, for the recent remake, which overall was definitely better (although not great).",1153353600,2,812,5.113636363636363

Dick and Jane had been living like there was no tomorrow in a high maintenance life style.  When Dick is terminated, they have no resources.  The local nursery reposseses their shrubbery and lawn.  Their utilities are shut off.  Jane finds she has no job skills, and Dick is trying to get by on unemployment.  They don't give a thought, of course, to selling their house and cutting back.  It's decision time.  They decide to turn to crime.

The film has its funny moments, like when they are being pursued by the TV evangelist who wants his money back.  They discover that some people don't seem to care if they rob big business, especially if the people are having trouble with the business.  But, they discover that they really have no net gain as the money is just meeting their bills as they maintain a high life style (and how do they explain their employment to their social set).

They finally hit on the solution to their troubles.  If you steal money that does not officially exist, who will people complain to, the police?  Dick discovers he has some inside information, and Jane has a few skills that you would not expect a young woman to learn at a university.  Universities don't teach urban survival skills.

The film shows that Jane Fonda could act if she was given a suitable role by a producer.  After all, acting runs in her family.",1135814400,10,1586,4.603571428571429

""Dick and Jane"" still works all by itself.  We might be conditioned to think of Jane Fonda for her dramatic roles, but she is a superior comedian and does a superb job as Jane.
  I consider it one of the top movies of all time -- but many people need weight and heft before they will stake any such claim.  If you are one of those, I'm sorry.  I will always love this film.
  If anyone knows how to campaign for a DVD version, let us know.  A few other reviewers have asked for a DVD version, I see.
  One reason I wanted to write this review is that I recently saw ""The Morning After"" and was surprised that my opinion was so different than most reviews I researched.  This is a fine look at Jane Fonda's ability by Sidney Lumet.  I think a lot of people misunderstand what they are seeing, however.  If you don't ""get it"" you might not appreciate the brilliance of this performance:  we don't know who Fonda is portraying for most of the movie.  Seeing an actor is most often like receiving a specially prepared gift.  The actor's work ususally supplies a lot of ""givens"" to the developing story.  Not the case in ""The Morning After.""  Here, we are challenged rather than coddled to.  Only near the end do we find that the character's history includes more than the status of a ""ne'er-been"" TV walk-on actress.
  I was will be thinking about this movie for days and watching it again.  And watching ""Fun with Dick and Jane"" more, too.  Both of these films should make you proud of a job well done by Jane Fonda.",1036540800,3,1649,4.363036303630363

7853548,3,630368677X,"Review of Fun with Dick and Jane
Hot Toasty Rag, September 29, 2017

Fun with Dick and Jane is a take on the Dick and Jane childrens books; George Segal and Jane Fonda play the title characters whove always played by the rules and done everything societys told them to do. Just when theyve incurred $70 grand in debt for home improvements, George gets fired. They try everything they can think of to get jobs and money, but when they reach the end of their rope, they turn to crime.

This movie isn't made to be taken seriously, so don't expect a dramatic heist film. This is a fun frolic through the 1970s with a few robberies along the way. George and Jane bounce off each other well, and they let the lines flow naturally, which makes the farcical situations even funnier. Hollywood remade the film in 2005, but it wasn't nearly as funny as the original.",1506643200,,857,4.452229299363057
7853549,5,630368677X,"Hilarious and if you like Jane's comedies such as 9 to 5, I think you are going to like this one as well. This was made in the 1970s, so don't expect it to be all up to date technology wise for movies, etc.
The basic premise for the movie is the two of them as a couple rip off (George's) Boss, because they find out he has been embezzling the company for his own gain. But first, they are ""hard up"" for cash, so small time crime robbing, etc. is tried with hilarious results.
Jane and George have good chemistry and Ed McMahon plays the Boss embezzling the thousands of dollars.
Some great comedy scenes even today as you watch it, you can't help but laugh.
This DVD doesn't have much in the way of features, in fact, the only thing is audio subtitles which are numerous.
