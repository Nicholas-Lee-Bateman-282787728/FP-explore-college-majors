829559,3,6304217420,"Sugar Hill (Paul Maslansky, 1974)

Okay, take the blaxploitation genre, add zombies, and put Samuel Z. Arkoff in charge of the whole mess. What do you get?

Pure. Cinematic. Gold. I kid you not. Sugar Hill is about as silly as it gets, and as a result holds up better than most of its more dated contemporaries. The plot: Sugar Hill (The Landlord's Marki Bey) and her boyfriend Langston (Larry D. Johnson, who never appeared in another movie) run a club that the local mob is trying to shake down. After they refuse to pay protection money, Langston is brutally beaten and left for dead outside the club. Sugar appeals to the underworld for revenge, entreating her grandmother to summon Baron Samedi (Don Pedro Colley, recently seen in Roger Corman's Piranha remake), the voodoo god of the dead, to raise an army of zombies which she can use to strike back at the mob. Lieutenant Valentine (Guess Who's Richard Lawson), investigating Langston's death, finds himself drawn to Sugar, but can't help thinking she's behind the string of murders and disappearances plaguing the mobsters...

Don't get me wrong-- this is a bad movie. The script (penned by High Chaparral staff writer Tim Kelly) is stiff, and the acting follows suit. The direction is inept (Maslansky is a producer, and since this attempt behind the camera, has remained a producer). The lighting often looks as if it was provided by a couple of car headlights and a bonfire. But come on, now, you're watching a blaxploitation zombie movie, are you expecting The Godfather? The cheese factor is high on this one, and that's part of what makes it so enjoyable. There have been a lot of voodoo-based horror movies over the years, and most of them are better than this by any empirical measure-- but it's this one that's going to stay with you years after you've seen it. ***",1172534400,21,1833,4.7578616352201255

829946,4,6304217420,Leave it to me to have been a projectionist in a black exploitation theater for almost 10 years and miss THIS film until tonight. My theory is that it didn't have Black in the title and the booking was dropped. You get the feeling that the director was familiar with the genre going back to WHITE ZOMBIE right through INVISABLE INVADERS. A near maxed out bit rate but I would have appreciated a little more light on the screen. Some attention was paid here that resulted in a better film than this had a right to be.

There's nothing even remotely funny about any of this, except maybe the stock footage they used for the nature scenes.  The acting is beyond terrible.  You can look at the movie cover and that's about as much as you'll get from the rest of it.  Several reviews rave about the leading lady's beauty ... well .... I wouldn't throw rocks at her or anything, but that purple jumpsuit isn't her best look, and like the rest of the cast, she seems to have smeared a layer of crisco all over her face before every scene.  No idea how this got a decent rating.  I'd post zero if they let me ... the fact that this movie was released in the new millennium is an embarrassment to the human race.",1406073600,,836,4.326923076923077

As an example of horror ""Blaxploitation"" I found it very enjoyable in the same vein as Blacula or Scream, Blacula, Scream. The plot isn't all that complex and is primarily a revenge through voodoo/zombies movie. The transfer looks really good and this is a fun way to spend an afternoon or evening. Oh, and Robert Quarry, of Count Yorga notoriety, is a primary character too.

830141,4,6304217420,"This story takes place in an area of Louisiana where the bodies of abused  African slaves  had been buried/dumped.

The type of dancing at the opening of the film  told me that this was going to be a sufficiently conscious movie.

Some white thug boss orders the destruction of  Sugar Hill's man in order to  take over his successful livelihood.

The spirit of revenge is awakened in this feminine and  beautiful, empowered Black woman, and she goes on to DEAL with quite a few foes and forces of the underworld.

VOODOO is presented in a superficial way, however the film ITSELF is a kind of voodoo, so hoodoo to you-do.  The comedic aspect of Sugar Hill is very much on the subtle side unlike other films like ""Dolemite"" for example (I'm assuming most anybody interested in this movie has an appreciation for ""Blacksploitation""  genre).

For those who want to experience the eerie, the sexy, the ghoulish, the mumbo jumbo, the woo-woo and the push and pull of the realities of the  genre, I would say Sugar Hill delivers.",1397260800,3,1023,4.674157303370786

830211,3,6304217420,"More hoot than horror, this treacley little offering is doubly black comedy, both in its subject matter and its use of the macabre for humor.
Don Pedro Colley, in his apparently relished role as voodoo spirit incarnate Baron Samedi, is the film's standout performer as he leers ecstatically at the prospect of suffering sinners.  His dark eyes appearing to gleam with demonic glee, he could have been a truly horrifying character in a film aimed more at terror than tease.  The movie's zombies, as well, would have been quite disquieting in a feature that utilized them solely as shadowy, shambling, nighttime creatures.  As ghoulishly good as the makeup is, it looks glaringly fake in light bright enough to reveal the black-on-gray greasepaint streaked across their bare chests.
But this flick is really all about fun, not fright.  As cathartic revenge fantasy, it delivers in a lighthearted manner unlikely to offend any involved ethnicities.  Most people can appreciate the dark humor of comeuppance delivered to vicious criminals and hate-filled bigots, especially in a common comedic format made farcical by contemporary notions regarding 'fros and flares.
To put it shortly and sweetly, this is good blaxploitation.",1335398400,,1222,5.278350515463917
830212,4,6304217420,"Remarkably clear for its age and obscurity, and what's very nice is the DVD is LOUD. Volume is so often a problem with older movies transferring to DVD so it's nice to see one where you don't have to have the TV all the way up then blow up your eardrums during dramatic bits.

The edit is a bit shaky at times. Occasionally cuts stutter to repeat a few seconds of film. It happens a few times, but not so often as to really get under your skin.

If you like Blacksploitation and MST3K, you'll likely enjoy this. It has a camp feeling, but it also has an honest enthusiasm about it. It seems like the actors and everyone else enjoyed making this film, and that comes across, and it's rather contagious.",1325203200,,701,4.303030303030303

830214,4,6304217420,"The Blacksploitation cycle of the Seventies was an incredible force which produced some of the best genre movies ever made.  After their success with Director William Crain's 'BLACULA'-1972, American International Pictures also produced a sequel Director Bob Kelljan's 'SCREAM,BLACULA,SCREAM'-1973 and this mixture of Cajun gangster and Voodoo magic, Director Paul Maslansky's 'SUGAR HILL'-1974, an entertaining time capsule featuring the beautiful Marki Bey as the main revenge seeking character.  Venerable actor Robert Quarry, who debuted one of the most successful Horror screen characters of the early Seventies 'COUNT YORGA' appears as Morgan, villain extroadinaire who wants Sugar's nightclub. After Sugar's beau is brutally murdered, she seeks the aid of Voodoo prince Baron Samedi played over the top by Don Pedro Colley who unleashes his zombie army to rid the area of Quarry's domain.  The zombies are not the flesh eaters of Director George Romero's territory but more like the automatons of the thirties and forties poverty row horror films.  Actor Richard Lawson who appeared as Blaculas's Renfield like character in ""SCREAM,BLACULA,SCREAM' does a good turn as a detective who aids Sugar and Zara Culley chews the scenery as the ancient voodoo priestess Mama Maitresse but Ms. Bey really is the standout as she eagerly plays out her revenge scenario kicking butt if she has to.  The film boasts good production values and is one of the best of its type. This release is culled from a Japanese Laser disc and looks good although the image is a tinch on the soft side but is in its 1.85 ratio.  MGM Limited just released a DVD-R of the film and is a bit more higher in the price range so you can take your pick on which version you may prefer.  All in all, this is highly recommended for genre buffs of all ages.",1323129600,,1824,5.039867109634551
830280,4,6304217420,"The Blaxploitation genre is more well known for it's tales of street crime, but filmmakers occasionally got creative and attempted crossovers with other genres.  Blaxploitation comedies, dramas, and yes, horror films started showing up.  Hell, even James Bond jumped on board with Live and Let Die.  But there were a few interesting horror titles like Blacula, Abby, JD's Revenge, and lets not forget Blackenstein.
Sugar Hill is one of the more original Blaxploitation/horror films, as it is a movie that wasn't trying to be the ""black"" version of a classic horror film like Blacula or Abby(an Exorcist ripoff).  Instead, it's more like Foxy Brown with a shot of voodoo black magic.
In the film, Diana ""Sugar"" Hill(named so because she looks as sweet as sugar tastes), loses her boyfriend when he refuses to sell his nightclub(Club Haiti, if you care to know the club's name) to a slimy criminal bigwig named Morgan(Played by Count Yorga himself, Robert Quarry!).  The club ownership now passes to Sugar and Morgan sets his sights on buying her out.  Sugar has different plans, however-Revenge....sweet revenge if you will.
Instead of arming herself to the teeth and going in all-guns-blazing Pam Grier style, Sugar takes a more sensible approach, and like most folks would do, seeks out a voodoo priestess.  The priestess summons Baron Samedi(who, if you all payed attention to your voodoo studies in school, would know is the guy who stands between the living and the dead in the voodoo religion.  He's the one who takes the dead to the other side.  A kind of voodoo version of the Grim Reaper if you will,  but a much snazzier dresser), and Samedi agrees to loan out his army of the undead to Sugar to carry out her vengeance.  ""Army"" in this case means about six zombies.  They're pasty, matted with cobwebs, and look like they have metal pinballs shoved into their eyesockets.  They also give a mean massage.
So, with her army of the undead, Sugar systematically hunts down and kills just about every one of Morgan's goons until finally going after the man himself.  Will she get her man?  You really think I'm gonna tell you?  You really think for a second that she doesn't?
This film is PG rated, so it's rather tame on all fronts.  Nothing in the way of brutality, sex or anything else you sick mothers want to see.  But it makes up for it all in style, as it's very entertaining.  Marki Bey is no Pam Grier, but she can carry the movie, and she's certainly easy on the eyes.  Robert Quarry is always fun to watch in his slimy, sophisticated villain roles.  The highight here is Don Pedro Colley as Baron Samedi.  The term ""overacting"" is putting it lightly.  Don acts as though he's never going to make another movie in his life, so he decided to put everything into this role.  He's easily the most entertaining part of the movie.
So, while this isn't exactly Ben-Friggin-Hur(though add a chariot race and it'd be damn close), it is quite fun, and has a considerably shorter running time.",1322352000,,2998,4.732177263969171

830283,3,6304217420,"Not to be confused with the 90's Wesley Snipes vehicle, Sugar Hill is the story of a woman seeking revenge against the gangsters who stomped her boyfriend to death after he refuses to sell them his lucrative nightclub business. Unlike the shoot 'em ups ""Slaughter,"" ""Coffy"" and ""Truck Turner"", this film takes on a supernatural bent when the vengeful woman solicits the help of a voodoo priestess (played by Zora Culley, best known for her role as Mother Jefferson on the sitcom ""The Jeffersons"") who summons zombies to carry out her deadly desires--in exchange for her soul, that is.

The zombies are outlandish and the death scenes hilarious, some I think which are unintentionally so. Nonetheless, this quirky mix of farce and blaxploitation anger is one of my favorites of the genre and is one no viewer will soon forget.  Got a little extra cash? Pick up ""Sugar Hill"" for a ninety-minute good time.",1282780800,,903,4.857142857142857
830284,5,6304217420,"Hi Amazon, I'm gonna buy the dvd. I hope it will play all the way through since i've been warned it's a chinese bootleg copy,oh well...
However I'll take my chances, this movie is worth it!!Sugar Hill starring Robert Quarry(yeh, the guy that looks like my husband)and the beautiful Marki Bey of the film ""The Landlord"" and she also posed nude in Playboy,star in this film. It's cool and cheesy but fun, a great zombie movie!!. OMG the EYE's on the zombies!!.Zara Cully(Mother Jefferson) from the tv show,The Jefferson's play's the grandmother who's into voodoo and all kinds of spooky stuff helps grandaughter teach the bad guy's a lesson. I think what I remember most about this film were the fashions, leisure suits, sexy dresses,the music. It's a pretty good horror film and it's unique, so if you got the money-BUY baby, buy.",1281657600,,829,4.804195804195804
830285,5,6304217420,"Marki Bey stars as a foxy lady, named Diana ""Sugar"" Hill. Her handsome prince fianc, Langston, owns a Voodoo-themed night club in the deep south. The club is
so successful, that the local mobster, Mr. Morgan, wants to pressure Langston into selling the club to him. When Langston refuses, Morgan's thugs beat Langston to death, in the parking lot of the club.

Consumed with anguish and thoughts of vengeance, Sugar decides to take matters into her own hands. She seeks out an elderly Voodoo priestess, named Mama Maitresse. Sugar explains to her, that she needs Mama's help, via her Voodoo powers. Mama Maitresse conjures up the ruler of the dead, Baron Zamedi. He then summons an army of Zombies, who were all former slaves, to help Sugar dispatch Langston's killers, one-by-one.

Marki Bey can certainly compete in the looks department, with that other 70s Blaxploitation goddess, Pam Grier. Ms. Bey is completely convincing as the grief-stricken Sugar, who is determined to settle the score with Morgan and his henchmen.

Robert Quarry's performance as the suave yet vicious Morgan, is pulled-off well. But it's not Quarry's most compelling role. He was much more charismatic, in his past performances in his Vampire films. So if you're a Robert Quarry fan, be forewarned that he doesn't shine that brightly, in this film.

Betty Anne Rees plays Morgan's racist, sex-starved girlfriend, Celeste. Betty Anne has a natural talent for portraying licentious, dangerous characters, with malicious intent. Her wicked-looking, gleaming gray eyes, make your blood run cold. Celeste is a particularly vile character, and Sugar exacts exquisitely appropriate revenge on her, in this film. Viewers will be cheering at Celeste's utter comeuppance, orchestrated by Sugar and the zombies.

Don Pedro Colley as Baron Samedi, gives an over-the-top performance. Don really chews-up the scenery, emoting like mad. You can tell that he really enjoys his role, as Baron Samedi. The other actors give mostly wooden performances. Especially Richard Lawson's portrayal of Valentine, the cop who was also Sugar's former love interest.

Like virtually all the films of the Blaxploitation genre, Sugar Hill's main thrust is revenge. Only a tiny handful of 70s Blaxploitation films, worked horror into their plot-lines. Of those, Sugar Hill stands out from the rest of the bunch. For fans of 70s Blaxploitation films, Sugar Hill delivers the goods.",1257033600,13,2425,5.269430051813472
830286,4,6304217420,"For B addicts like Sid, it takes only one suggestion to get a B in. Hmm, we just got Mr. Collins off&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Ring/dp/B00069QD74/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Ring</a>&nbsp;Island and it's 11:30. Football doesn't start til 1. O yeah. So Sid quickly scouted Ondemand, the old reliable, and came upon Sugar Hill. It definitely qualified for Sid's October Horrorgreatsuccess because it was described as a zombie flick so we took a shot.

A few minutes in the film was dubbed ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dolemite-the-story-of-Rudy-Ray-Moore/dp/1575021927/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dolemite : the story of Rudy Ray Moore</a>&nbsp;with zombies."" It fit Sid's mood to a t. ""Sugar"" Hill, played by pantheon-level 70's smokeshow Marki Bey, is a club owner who is being shaken down by the mob for protection money. Instead of forking over the dough to the real Lefty Rosenthal, Hill contacts her legitimately frightening Grandmother. Hill's Grandma is is into some black magic, midnight, evil stuff. So she conjures the zombies to take care of the mob. It was a super-original flick with lots of unintentional comedy, a good plot, and a few surprising scares(especially when the Grandmother was onscreen).

Sugar Hill was honestly one of the most entertaining films Sid has seen all month. It had the predictable lag in the middle of the film but it was still a very very good effort. Seriously, this is a really really solid horror flick. There was one thing that kept it from 5 cans and greatness:Marki Bey stayed fully clothed the entire time. I mean, those things were good. Sid wanted to be friends with them. Sid hopes that now, 35 years later, whoever made that terrible decision is reading this, realizes that they missed out on greatness, and feels like an absolute failure because they are.",1256083200,3,1909,5.602076124567474
