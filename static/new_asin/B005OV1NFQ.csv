However, I found it difficult to watch because of the constant cuts. I think the longest shot in this movie was about 15 seconds long. Too many close ups on individual dancers made it difficult to follow the big picture of what was happening. A theatrical performance is meant to be seen in the big picture, which this recording gives us very few of.

Disappointed that the film itself ruined a beautiful dance piece.",1510790400,,542,4.817204301075269

8482104,5,B005OV1NFQ,"Dance theater at its best. Beautifully filmed with great sensitivity to the complex and multi-layered choreography.  John Neumeier is a force of nature and this ballet is perhaps one of his very best. Very few, if any, choreographers today are able to sustain a 2 hour story-based ballet, while creating a self-contained universe on stage that brings the audience to an overwhelming emotional climax - as it is the case with this great work of art. His commission of a brand new musical score that is able to sustain and enhance the emotional impact of the choreography so organically was a stroke of genius. This is the future of dance theater and without a doubt a modern masterpiece.",1324252800,19,686,4.813559322033898
8482105,5,B005OV1NFQ,"Absolutely love this DVD!! I saw this production live in San Francisco War memorial Opera House about a year and half ago, and really enjoyed it.  Finally I get to have the DVD. Yay!!! The principal ballerina Yuan Yuan Tan is truly amazing, and role fits her perfectly. It seemed as if the role was created just for her!!!! I really wish to see more of her DVDs as I no longer live in San Francisco, but really want to see her dance. The entire cast was just as wonderful.  The camera work was great, and the costumes were colorful and creative.  This is definitely a DVD or blue-ray to own. I'm also thinking about buying a Blue-ray as well since sometimes DVDs wear out over years of playing, and the edition could be out of print by then.  I would like to keep this production in my library forever.",1322611200,20,802,4.326666666666667
