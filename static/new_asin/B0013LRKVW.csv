Field Day at James Tovar Middle School is supposed to be fun. However, for Jack, Skye, and Darryl, it turns out to be everything but fun. Skye could not finish the jump rope rally, Jack could barely climb one foot up the rock-climbing wall, and Darryl was absolutely no competition for Hogarth in the 100-yard dash. Stunned, embarrassed and a little confused, our three competitors look to Trevor to find out what exactly happened at the field day games. Tips for Becoming Fun-ergized!
Coach Trevor Romain issues a 30-day fitness challenge to Jack and his buddies while explaining to them the importance of a healthy lifestyle. During the challenge, they learn that physical activity and healthy eating habits are not only good for you but fun as well. Jack, Skye and Darryl prove to Coach Trevor, and more importantly to themselves, that taking better care of your body improves the quality of your life and your performance in school and on the field. 25 minutes (plus special features). Ages 6 and up.
