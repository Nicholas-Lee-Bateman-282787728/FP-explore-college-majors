The movies on the disc are at best B rated movies. (very bad) I am very disapointed in the way the disc was advertised.",1240963200,2,262,3.943396226415094
8213627,2,B000UL61JS,"As a HUGE Maureen O'Hara fan I am disappointed in this DVD, and do not recommend it to fellow fans. Jamaica Inn is the only decent one, but the picture is very gritty, poor quality and muffled sound. Since this is O'Hara's first movie, and she does an excellent job acting, I decided to  give this DVD two stars, instead of one.

Kangaroo and Deadly Companions are not enjoyable, and according to Ms. O'Hara's autobiography, they were not enjoyable to her, either. Kangaroo's orignial script was great, so she signed up for the film, but when she went to Australia the script was revised to the abomination it is now. Speaking of abominations: it does not help that the two actors who played the main male leads got caught in Australia abusing boys, while making this film. Sickening. Speaking of sickening: Sam Peckinpah troubled Maureen during the filming of Deadly Companions, by getting a sadistic enjoyment out of his cruelty to animals (it doesn't surprise me that this sadist later on directed the Wild Bunch). He must have been too busy with animal cruelty because Peckinpah FORGOT TO FILM A CLIMACTIC INDIAN BATTLE!

For signature Maureen O'Hara movies, purchase McClintock! and Quiet Man.",1214784000,10,1198,4.891625615763547

8213629,2,B000UL61JS,"I mainly bought this DVD because I absolutely love Maureen O'Hara and because I was curious about the film, ""Kangaroo"". Since it was very reasonably priced I figured 'nothing ventured, nothing gained' - so I'm glad I didn't pay more than a few dollars for it! The video transfers were from the worst possible film sources with tons of bad splices, missing dialog and poor picture quality. I was curious about ""Kangaroo"" because of the stories Maureen O'Hara told in her autobiography, "" 'Tis Herself"". She said it was a real ""stinkeroo"" (as she called it) and, by golly, it is! None the less, it didn't cost me much to find out for myself. I should've taken her word for it!",1197331200,20,674,4.578512396694215
8213630,4,B000UL61JS,"ST. CLAIR's ""signature"" series each consist of three public domain films (on a single DVD) that are good, but not necessarily the featured artist's best work.

Contents of the MAUREEN O'HARA COLLECTION:

JAMAICA INN-- O'Hara's screen debut is also Alfred Hitchcock's last British-made film. A nicely-paced story rendered by a strong cast. The Jamaica Inn is home for land-based pirates  (headed by a nobleman) who trick passing ships into stranding on Cornwall's shoals, after which they loot the abandoned wrecks.

KANGAROO -- Immigrants from Ireland settle in rural Australia. Technicolor Aussie scenery may be the highlight of this too-predictible story. Richard Boone as the villain is over-the-top.

THE DEADLY COMPANIONS-- Western about an Army officer who escorts the funeral procession of O'Hara's young son through dangerous Indian territory. The best of this small collection, thanks in part to Sam Peckinpah's unusual direction and editing.
