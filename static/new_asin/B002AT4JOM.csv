3891882,3,B002AT4JOM,"Proving his filmmaking prowess has come a long way since Combat Shock, Buddy Giovinazzo adapts his own novel with Life is Hot in Cracktown, which depicts some intertwining tales along the lines of Crash, only that most of the denziens are either crack addicts or somehow effected by the drug running rampant in the inner city.  Among them are a pre-op transexual (Kerry Washington) and her volitale beau (Desmond Harrington), a violent and doomed gangbanger (Evan Ross), a guy (Victor Rasuk) just trying to get by and support his wife (Shannyn Sossamon) and baby, and a kid (Ridge Canipe) taking care of his baby sister and addict mother (Illeana Douglas).  While some of the film's dialogue borderlines on laughable, Life is Hot in Cracktown as a whole bears some undoubtedly powerful and heartbreaking moments regardless.  The end result of the film is definitely unsavory, but if it is one thing that Giovinazzo has proven over the years, he has an unflinching attitude, and isn't afraid to put it on display.  Also among the cast are blink and you'll miss them roles from Lara Flynn Boyle, RZA, Thomas Ian Nicholas, and Brandon ""Superman"" Routh.",1251504000,,1149,4.937823834196891
3891883,1,B002AT4JOM,"This may well have been a best selling novel.  But as we all know, great books don't necessarily make for great films.  Life Is Hot In Cracktown could perhaps have been something worthwhile in the right hands.  But this clearly low-budget endeavor falls short of anything worth your time.  The shortcomings of this film are many, but chief among them are tortoise like plot development, one dimensional characters and amateurish editing.  The story isn't new.  We've pretty much seen the inner-city struggles routine a hundred times by now and Cracktown brings nothing new to the table.  Save your money and avoid this one.",1251504000,,623,4.990291262135922
3891884,5,B002AT4JOM,"This is not an easy cinematic experience. In fact, it is probably best that it only had a run on silver screens in New York and Los Angeles. I would have found it a very uncomfortable 100 min. theatrical residency. Featuring jaw dropping performances by Evan Ross, in yet another intense character study as Romeo.....a dangerously menacing character, Kerry Washington as a post-op transsexual, Victor Rasuk showcasing his sensitivity and sexiness at the same time and a brief appearance by Ileana Douglas in a stripped down role as a drug addicted mother. There is nothing easy about this film. But though it showcases the grittier side of human behavior, it also captures the honesty and beauty of a pure love as captured in performances by Victor Rasuk and a misfit love story featuring Kerry Washington.

But it is Evan Ross that commands the viewer's undivided attention when he darts in and out of scenes with his predatory gait, misplaced value system and his demonstration of a human quickly becoming devoid of any recognizable emotion. This is Mr. Ross'  6th performance before his 21st birthday. He specializes in playing tough, lost and multi-layered, troubled teens on his way to being ""indie kid of the year"". In ""ATL"" he impatiently tried to rush through puberty as he romanced a thuggish future, in ""Pride"" he was the neighborhood misfit with bruting sensitivity, In ""Linewatch"" he portrayed an orphaned kid headed down a dark path, in ""Life Support"" he captured the dying angst of a young HIV-infected gay teen, in ""Gardens of the Night"" he once again plays an abandoned youth forced to learn the ways of the world to protect his adopted sister and himself from the pending cruel world and here in ""Life is Hot in Cracktown"" he perfectly plays against type as a gang leader destined for finality. It will be  welcome relief to see Mr. Ross in his soon to be released, ""Greta"" love story w/Hillary Duff.....but judging from the trailer, he doesn't stray too far from his pursuit of the intense characters best associated with actor's actors like a young Al Pacino or a young Robert De Niro.

It is hard to call this entertaining. It is quite draining. In fact, I had to pause the DVD several times and take a breather. But if you appreciate your drama with the intensity of a Martin Scorcese film or HBO's acclaimed ""Wired"" series, then this movie will work for you. See it if only for the truly haunting portrayal of Romeo by one, Evan Olaf Ross.",1251331200,,2461,4.769953051643192

3891919,3,B002AT4JOM,"(WARNING: The beginning of this movie has a tremendously violent rape scene-as all rape scenes are.) I bought it to watch Kerry Washington's acting. As usual, she can bring a character to life. The character she portrays is believeable and I think she added depth where there was none written. I am no advocate for the main storyline, but I'd watch this movie again.",1385510400,,366,4.734375
3891920,1,B002AT4JOM,"I'll start from the beginning:

In the opening scene a young man walks through his rough neighborhood and passes a basketball court where a girl he knows is hanging out. He leads her into a trap where she is very briefly raped by 3 guys and peed on by another. Anyone with half a brain will notice that the mattress is brand new, because, apparently, this back alley rape was sponsored by Sleepy's. I'm imagining the planning for this. The leader of the group must have gotten together with his boys over breakfast and said,

""Hey guys, we should rape Jenny today.""
""Oh, snap,"" replied his homey, ""I know her from AP History; she's such a special girl. If we're gonna do this, we better do it right.""
""Right, let's go to the mattress store and pick up a queen size.""
""A queen size!"" says the leader, appalled.
""Billy, you know there was a budget shortfall and we've already pledged $500 to the PAL.""
""True,"" he says, remembering his own days of playing pee-wee football before everyone else's nuts dropped and he ended up playing kissy face with their navels in the HS locker room.
""Okay, whitey and me will get the queen size, Billy'll get Jenny, and...""
""I'll go get a couple quarts of Gatorade. If I'm gonna do this, it's gotta be done right.""

After this they bust in on an old guy who they steal a social security check from, which is odd that the old guy would live so long and take crap from these kids, but it's a fair way of showing how they terrorize the neighborhood despite them all being punks and there only being four of them.

Next, the rapist leader/geriatric beater goes home where he looks at a picture of a kid on his mirror and I think it's supposed to be sad. The point of the scene was to show that the little monster has feelings. Whatever.

The second storyline is of a mom, her two kids, and a loser boyfriend who is always on the run. They live in a one-room dump and the kids hardly have food. Despite this, the little girl's hair is always perfectly done. She has dirt make-up on her face, but she apparently just came from the salon. My guess is that while filming this she was also the understudy for a part in a local play, but I'm just speculating, which made the movie more enjoyable since the actual story was not.

The 3rd storyline is of a guy working a couple jobs trying to take care of his wife and kid. He's at work most of the time, his wife goes down on him another, and then there is a marital argument, proving that life is not only hot in cracktown, but it's also boring.

There was another part where the 4 thugsters were doing a slow-motion walking scene that ended with the leader bumping shoulders with a white kid who seemed kind of surprised more than anything else. I'm going to guess that the leader used to have sleepovers with that kid and probably played Red Rocket with him before they discovered girls.

A last note on the leader of this 4-way: he looks very clean as opposed to being from a poor neighborhood that introduced him to drugs, violence, and sex at a young age. He is like the little girl's hair - out of place, at best, and another example of how poorly done this film is.

The acting, overall, was good, but the execution was just awful.",1377648000,4,3210,4.354515050167224
3891921,5,B002AT4JOM,This was an AWESOME MOVIE! Not for the faint of heart. The very first (opening) scene had my jaws to the floor and I could not take my eyes off the screen until it went off... This is a must see!,1376870400,,195,3.7804878048780486
3891922,3,B002AT4JOM,"I think the cast was great, the story was very realistic & believable.  The only problem was the story felt too real for me.  I know the issues here need to be brought to light, but for me I prefer my movies as escapism, not ultra realism.  Towards the beginning there was a very graphic rape & honestly it was hard to follow afterwards.  The comfort level in the room was non-existent.  Afterwards I stopped the movie & attempted to watch alone later.  Even then those type of scenes seem to overshadow the other details, leaving the feeling of dread that I prefer not to watch most of the time.  Don't get me wrong this movie is well made & achieves some truly difficult degrees of believability that no one can deny this director.  But for me, just not my kind of movie.

3891927,4,B002AT4JOM,"This film is quite possibly one of the most brutal and horrific films I've ever seen, even more frightening than many horror films that I have seen, because it felt so real. Growing up in a largely lower class environment, with a former drug-addict mother, I have known many drug addicts and former drug addicts and I can honestly say that the depiction of many of the addicts in this film, especially Desmond Harrington's character, felt incredibly authentic and genuine. As for whether I liked the film or not, to be honest I did like it, at times it definitely felt like it was trying too hard to be shocking and that kept me from giving it 5 stars, but most of the characters, especially considering how bad they could have turned out given the circumstances they lived in, were oddly likable! They certainly didn't feel fake or stereotyped in any way, which made them more appealing to me. They still had hopes and dreams, and you could definitely sympathize with them, which made their circumstances all the more sad and depressing. I'm not a big fan of gritty films like this, but I couldn't stop watching this film, wanting to see how all the characters ended up, if they ever make it out of this hellish existence. The ending didn't offer any hopeful conclusions but I honestly didn't expect it to, real life isn't a fairy tale or sitcom, it can come close, but it can also be incredibly dark and tragic, Life is Hot in Cracktown takes an unflinching look at just how bleak life can be. Of course this isn't the first film to take issues related to poverty and drug addiction and definitely not the best, but it is able to hold it's own ground among the contenders.",1357171200,,1674,4.546357615894039

3891929,1,B002AT4JOM,"Characters run too fast through choppy scenes, and it seems like the shock value of some of their excess behavior outweighs any real story value or entertainment.

3891930,4,B002AT4JOM,"There isn't another movie about drugs quite like this one.  The characters aren't skewed toward misery, it's just that misery sort of oozes out of their every word and deed.  Particularly disturbing are the latch-key kids of a crack smoking couple and a non drug using couple with a baby who just happen to live and work in a crack neighborhood.  You'll never look at the ghetto quite the same again.",1343865600,,400,4.605633802816901
3891931,1,B002AT4JOM,"The point of this movie was to show the brutality of the crack filled inner city (or something), but there is no real meaning or redemption to be found in the film. Not one single character in the movie seemed to have any redeeming qualities that a decent person could relate to. I get it, drugs mess people up, but there is no excuse for any of these people's behavior. Gang raping, forcing an enema on an old man, a mother pimping out her young daughter, just to name a few of the disturbing scenes.

There is no rhyme or reason to anything these people do, we see people throughout the movie being victimized and then turning around victiming themselves or others. Young women date Romeo and has little ""friends,"" get treated like absolute crap and never once question it. In fact, the only people that seem to have any interest in living a decent life were the couple with the baby, and even they seemed to settle for the life they had.

To me this movie portrayed an existence so horrific it is unimaginable. I don't understand why they won't just do something, ANYTHING to just leave that place and live a better life. The product description says that despite the inner city struggles, ""humanity and hope can still prevail."" Really? What ""hope"" or ""humanity"" was in this film? This film almost leaves you with no hope in humanity.

Isn't it comforting knowing that places like this actually exist in the world? Prostitutes, drug dealers, rapists, and murderers just walk the streets and apparently the police and community as a whole can't control the situation. These people commit crimes of drugs, rape, prostitution, child abuse, and murder on an apparently daily basis and somehow none of them ever gets caught. It's a disgusting example of the lowest of the low of humanity, and apparently the writer(s) just wanted to revel in the human destruction with absolutely no redemption in the end whatsoever. I would rather not watch a bunch of screwed up people who don't want to change.",1317513600,,1994,4.707736389684814
3891932,3,B002AT4JOM,"I have mixed feelings about this movie.  I did not critique the actors or the directors, but I was focused on the message.  The message was disturbing but typical of the life style some people may or may not choose to live.  Hopelessness, addiction, violence, abuse, child neglect and exploitation, prostitution, etc.  The parts that disturbed me most were the ""enema scene""--I turned my head away--and the abused and neglected children.  After the movie I cried for the human race and I asked God to help us all.  To help us to realize that we have the gift of a higher self that we can tap into for salvation.",1314489600,,611,4.559633027522936
3891933,1,B002AT4JOM,"This has been done a so many times its irritating. It seemed like they tried too hard to take on too many situations and be shocking and sobering. To me it seemed like a cheap a_ _ wannabe crash part 2. A friend of mine showed this to me as a joke. The subject matter was not at all bad and is no laughing matter but the execution was so horrible it was hilarious. One great point that my friend brought up that kept us laughing and joking for over an hour is that instead of the old man buying some food, he should have went out and bought a gun. They tried too hard too make the Romeo character hardcore but sadistical at the same time. To me he just looked like a cheap a_ _ Micheal Jackson or some kid that would be on the Disney channel. Being in the Army myself and spending over 4 out of my over ten years in the military fighting in the cities and streets of Iraq and Afghanistan and born and raised in the City of Houston prior to the Army, I just couldn't take the twerps in this movie seriously and would take great pleasure in capturing and exterminating Romeo and his lil friends. Judging by his a facial features and girly build his squeals of pain when he is near death would be very feminine. This movie just tried too hard and I couldn't help but laugh at it. For me this was a big waste of time and I hope the director didn't think he was making a work of art or some sort of master peice. Watch this at your own risk you have been warned lol lol.",1310342400,2,1465,4.037800687285223
3891934,4,B002AT4JOM,"With a title like ""Life Is Hot In Cracktown"", I was mostly expecting a throwaway exploitation film with, I hoped, a tolerably engaging story.  But the movie actually turned out to be pretty serious: it was well acted, engaging, and stylishly directed.  As widely reported elsewhere, however, the film is indeed extremely brutal.

As described by writer/director Buddy Giovinazzo in the thoughtful ""making of"" featurette on the DVD, the aim of the film was to present an in-your-face, unsanitized, essentially hopeless view of life in the ghetto, but then inject as much humanity as possible into the crooks, drug addicts, murderers, and fringe characters on display.  To paraphrase Mr. Giovinazzo: ""I wanted to show that these people, despite their problems and situations, ultimately aren't all that different from you or me, that we're all maybe one or two pieces of bad luck away from living lives just as tragic and desperate.""

This approach makes the film interesting, as normal, mundane concerns and interactions are stirred into the brutality and addictions and abusive behavior.  So we end up caring for these people (well, many of them, anyway), even as we're angry at them for their behaviors.  Also making the film interesting is its sympathetic view of its two transsexual characters, as the story doesn't lump them into the bad stuff going on around them (well, except for the fact that they're seriously drug addicted like so many of the film's characters), but rather portrays them as people trying to be true to themselves.

Before concluding, I should again emphasize the brutality in the film.  This isn't an ""afterschool special"" version of drug addiction and urban blight.  This is very dark material, with few rays of light, that some people just won't want to sit through no matter how well done.  However, if you're like me and can sometimes embrace difficult, harsh material in order to avoid seeing the same old thing all the time, this film might be worth a look.",1290988800,,1990,5.0
3891935,3,B002AT4JOM,"To say that this movie is not engaging will be an understatement. True, it reveals a lot of pain points for a leading society, primarily the struggle for survival for the underprivileged that could make for a good debate at a literary university class. What lacks is the types of characters that viewers can fall in love with and follow through. There were moments indeed. Moments where a young boy is out on the street begging for money in order to feed his little sister, or a young father working two jobs and studying part time to provide for his new born. Within these moments, one looks to connect somewhat remotely and share in the struggle. Then there the moments where a transvestite is hiding his true identity from his boyfriend, while both abuse hard drugs - these in particular are too tough to decipher for us the identity-settled middle class folk.
This isn't a date-movie, feel-good-movie, entertaining-movie, get-together-with-old-pals-movie. This is a weak attempt to capture what could be a powerful book (it is always doubtful that a movie can capture the soul of the poor ghetto survivor).",1285113600,2,1110,4.909574468085107
3891946,5,B002AT4JOM,"Before I go into this review, I must caution people that Life is Hot in Cracktown has an awful lot of extreme violence and there is some nudity as well. This is anything but a family film; and indeed, after watching and reviewing Shutter Island just three days ago I can honestly say that this makes Shutter Island look like something put out by The Walt Disney Studios. This is not to say, however, that this motion picture is bad--in fact, it's really rather well done; but it's not for the faint of heart at all.

Life is Hot in Cracktown does have its noted similarities to Crash; only the action is extremely rough and the outlook bleak at best for its principle characters. There are four major stories told throughout this film although none of them is finished when it ends; this gives the film a slice of life quality that I actually enjoyed very much.

When the film starts, it isn't long before we meet Marybeth (Kerry Washington), a pre-op transgender person who is loved by a straight man called Benny (Desmond Harrington). Things are much more complicated, though: they each use drugs and while Marybeth uses heroin Benny smokes crack to get by; and their money woes never seem to stop. In addition, there's ten year old Willy (Ridge Canipe) and his younger sister who live in a flophouse with two crack addicted adults one of whom is his mother (Illeana Douglas). Moreover, there's Romeo (Evan Ross, who gives a particularly stunning performance) who leads a street gang and who doesn't care what damage and violence he does to others. Finally, there are Concetta (Shannyn Sossamon) and her husband Manny (Victor Rasuk) who are struggling to get out of the ghetto and into a much better life as far away from there as they can get.

The acting is uniformly excellent and the cinematography and choreography work wonders for this low budget film. The DVD comes with a few extras. I enjoyed the commentary by director Buddy Giovinazzo and the deleted scenes are also very interesting to watch. Look also for very good performances by Mark Webber as Ridley; Brandon Routh as ""Sizemore;"" Richard Portnow as ""the guy in 4K"" and Elena Franklin as Melody. Vondie Curtis-Hall also does an excellent job portraying a cop named Dixon.

Overall, Life is Hot in Cracktown is certainly not for the faint at heart; it's quite graphic and the action, often violent, never stops from the beginning of the film up until the very final frame. I do recommend this film, however, for people who enjoy gritty, social issue dramas that tell it like it is about life in very impoverished neighborhoods and fans of the actors in this movie will want to get this for their collections.",1278201600,4,2675,4.7094017094017095
3891947,3,B002AT4JOM,"In the beginning of the film ""Life is Hot in Cracktown"" a young man named Romeo extends a playful invitation to a young lady. ""Come with me ... I wanna show you something."" He leads her by the hand down an alley, at the end of which is a mattress on the ground and a group of his friends, who proceed to brutally gang rape her.

The film doesn't get any easier or nicer from there. ""Life is Hot in Cracktown"", the title of which sounds like either a dark comedy or a grindhouse B-movie, clearly aims to show humanity at its most brutal, soulless, and cruel. The viewer is taken on a tour of a poor, inner-city neighborhood, where most of the characters have ties to hard drugs, either through being addicts, dealers, or police officers. The combination of poverty, despair, and drug abuse has created situations that range from bleak to horrific.

""Precious"" was a film that balanced its brutal portrayal of urban poverty with enough humor and fantasy to keep it from being too bleak. ""Life is Hot in Cracktown"" aims for pure gritty realism. At its best, it succeeds, and at its worst, it seems exploitive and sensationalistic.

What redeems the film is the performances. Kudos to Evan Ross, who plays Romeo, for infusing his monstrous, sadistic character with tiny shreds of humanity. When I first saw Kerry Washington in the film, I thought she was basically just playing the same character (a drug addicted prostitute) that she played in ""The Dead Girl"", until it quickly becomes clear that her character is actually a transgendered woman, and she delivers the powerful, multi-faceted performance needed. In fact, most of the actors, even the children, give their characters the depth and humanity needed in order to keep the whole film from turning into a trite morality play.",1277164800,9,1780,4.7540453074433655

3891950,2,B002AT4JOM,"This movie, based on a 1993 novel (really a collection of stories) by Buddy Giovinazzi, is a gritty and unpleasant look at life in the inner-city (New York's Lower East Side, supposedly).  The loosely-connected stories share really only one thing: the descent into hell for those sad cases (and their families) who are addicted to drugs (the crack of the title) or the money it brings.

This is not a movie for those looking for anyone sympathetic (though we are supposed to be moved by the story of a young man who decides he wants to live as a woman and gets breast augmentation surgery.  The 'transformation' is totally unbelievable complete with one terrible wig (why not grow your own hair out, guy?).  He is having problems with his self-identity (no kidding) and depends on his few friends for moral support.  His main friend is MaryBeth, a black woman who supposedly has undergone a more complete transition from male to female.  We do not believe this for a minute, as MaryBeth is played by an actress, Kerry Washington, who, though talented, cannot make us think she was ever a man.  (See Victor/Victoria for a similar lack of conviction on the part of Julie Andrews.)  MaryBeth is hooked up with a 'small-time' criminal, slow-witted Benny.

Each one of the stories is downbeat.  Even the male-to-female transsexual comes to an unhappy end.  The other somewhat positive character is Victor Rasuk, who plays a guy trying to stay out of trouble and support his wife and ever-crying child.  Of course, he fails.

The worst story involves a black gang led by the unpleasant and evil Romeo (Evan Ross), who support themselves by robbing, maiming, and dealing drugs.  They terrorize a old, white guy in the welfare apartment (where much of the unpleasantness occurs) for his welfare check, finally beating and sodomizing him to death.  There is, of course, no remorse.  Luckily, Romeo runs afoul of a rival gang and gets what is coming to him, too late for this reviewer.

To me, this plays like a budget version of the much-superior 'The Wire.'  I suppose the budget was much smaller here, and the writing snappier, but my main complaint is that every last one of these stories is in varying degrees, grim and disheartening.

For lovers of all that is disgusting in humans, this is your film.  For the average film-goer, I'd say, stick with 'The Wire' or any of a number of other films dealing with complete losers.  Way too downbeat for me.  The only redemption comes with death.

This is the first time I was able to get a DVD to review. They are usually all gone. So I felt very lucky and I love MOVIES so I was anxious to see the film. I red the names of the actors and I recognized no one by name. However, i the course of the film I recognized an actor from ""UGLY BETTY"" (TV) and also an actress from ""SIX FEET UNDER"" (Cable). So this film had some very good actors available to it. It opens with a stupid rape scene - intended to shock but not believable. And you know what? That is the best discription of this movie, READY???

IT IS INTENDED TO SHOCK BUT IT IS NOT BELIEVABLE!

I would suggest that you buy: ""NEW JACK CITY"" with Chris Rock if you really want to understand drugs in the intercity. But ""Life is hot in Cracktown"" is at best a lousy ""after school special"" but frankly a total failure. No wonder Amazon had to give this DVD away to get anyone to watch it.

3891954,3,B002AT4JOM,"A very dystopian work, Cracktown tries a little too hard to be realistic and misses the many opportunities afforded by art. For how many minutes must we be subjected to a howling baby's screams before the director feels we get it? One too many, maybe three. Same goes for some of the other of the many unpleasantries here.

This film seems to almost revel in displaying sociopathic behavior, and while it's to be commended for seeking some kind of redemption for some of these characters, somehow it just didn't make me care for any of them very much.

A few of the performances, however, are occasionally excellent, specifically Evan Ross, fine as the chief young hood, and especially Desmond Harrington as Benny. The one transcendent moment in the film for me comes at 22:12. Benny takes a crack hit in an alley and goes into a brief, mumbling anti-Shakespearean soliloquy that rings truer than true; finally, artistry! It is a truly solid bit of acting that unfortunately highlights what's missing from the rest of this film: masterfulness.

It's all a little too gritty while still being a little too unbelievable in its depiction. I just don't buy a lot of these lines, though the situations ring true. On the plus side, the transgender story is unique and interesting, as are various moments.

Though I couldn't feel much for the characters it is still a pretty decent movie. One thing it had going for it is the fact it was directed by the author of the original stories, allowing him to show us what the work means instead of another persons interpretation.

At times it was hard to relate to the characters but as with any other movie, or book for that matter, if it's broken down to the most basic of human elements there is something there to grasp.

I tried on several occasions to watch it but could never find a reason to watch it more than a few minutes at a time.  I finally just gutted it out and forced myself to wait it out until the end.  I think I managed to finish it on my sixth try.

This is easily one of the least pleasant movies that I have ever seen.  It starts with the characters.  The film is essentially an anthology show, telling the story of a number of characters in an area of a city that has been destroyed by drug culture.  OK, this is all well and good, but regardless of intent, a film is only as good as its characters.  I can honestly say that there was not a single character that I cared about even in the least.  I can honestly say that there was not a single minute of the film that I cared for in the least.  The film is an unremitting exploration of the inconceivably bleak existence of a string of completely unlikeable characters.  The film has no redeeming qualities.  The writing is wretched, the acting adequate but unable rise above the horrid material, and the narrative bleak without redemptive features.

Not many movies have left me feeling as bored and soiled as this one.  Honestly, if I had not felt obligated by getting it through the Vine Program, I would not have finished it or reviewed it.",1258848000,,1357,4.270588235294118
3891957,3,B002AT4JOM,"I did not expect entertainment. Prior to seeing the film, I read a handful of plot synopses on ""Life is Hot in Cracktown"" which all painted a picture of a complex narrative spanning dozens of characters and their problems with sex, drugs, money, or life in general. I also sough out specifics on why the film is rated R, to wit: strong violence, rape, drug content throughout, graphic sexuality, nudity, and pervasive language (for those who keep score). I was aware of the comparisons to the 2004 Oscar-winning film ""Crash"", high praise to be certain, and further evidence that this was to be a weighty film. The sort of film that wrestles with the inexplicable human predilection for self-destruction and its inevitable fallout on the unfortunate bystanders.

So I did not expect entertainment. Unfortunately, in trying to so fervently rail against the injustices of man, the film collapses under its own weight as it minutely details the flaws and excesses of each character yet provides no cohesive statement about the entire convoluted affair. It isn't that the film should provide some cliched moral lesson or even a hollow attempt to suggest solutions, it's that the film comes off as an excessive and overwrought effort to shock the audience with explicit depictions of, well, nearly everything. Aside from the graphic rape scenes, one of the most disturbing scenes was one in which three young men robbed and horrifically brutalized an elderly man in his own apartment. Watching the film unfold gives the impression that it seeks to exploit the very vices it is presumably intended to attack.

The low budget is a plus for this film, however, as the lack of Hollywood gloss only heightens the gritty feel. Though the cast is composed of relatively unknown actors, it's a strong collection of up-and-comers along with a handful of veteran C-listers. Desmond Harrington (of ""Dexter"" fame) and Kerry Washington (""The Last King of Scotland"") were two stand outs. ""Life is Hot in Cracktown"" is an ambitious film that ultimately bites off more than it can chew.

3891959,1,B002AT4JOM,"Wanted to like it. Really, really tried to watch it. Couldn't do it.

Cracktown starts out gritty and violent. We're introduced right off the bat to the fact that the characters live in a rough, crime riddled, depressing environment. Poverty, prostitution, rampant drug use - these people have it rough, and there's little to look forward to.

The film is very poorly edited. The obvious edits are jarring and extremely distracting; in fact, there were a few times when I honestly thought part of the film was totally cut out by accident (what the heck actually happened to the young girl in the opening scene? is something missing?). Dialogue is mumbled and overpowered by background noises and music. I kept turning up the volume and rewinding to catch what the characters were saying.

Still, I was determined to finish the film so I would have a complete picture on which to base an opinion. I gave up and threw in the towel shortly after the forced enema scene. Yes, you read that correctly. Forced. Enema. Scene.

As some previous reviewers have pointed out, the style and concept here are much like that of Crash; vignettes of seemingly unrelated characters that I assume eventually intersect. Unfortunately, the poor technical qualities of the film combined with the jarring violence without context made me give up. Gritty reality makes for amazing viewing when done by the right hand. I don't think I would ever be able to say that a film in the vein of Crash (which I liked) is ""enjoyable."" Sheer entertainment is not the goal of these films, and I wanted to watch Cracktown in its entirety just to get the filmmaker's intent and message. I just couldn't do it. Give me a reason early in the picture to be invested enough in the outcome that I'm willing to watch the violence and the despair.

There are a lot of good actors in it, including Ileana Douglas, Kerry Washington, Desmond Harrington (who I didn't realize was a character in the show Dexter until after I had looked it up) and I enjoyed Evan Ross's acting, because his character was the most difficult to watch.

I'm not even sure I could describe why it was average. I guess it's because it didn't blow me away.

3891963,4,B002AT4JOM,"Buddy Giovinazzo writes and directs this adaptation of his own novel, which in both story and structure instantly made me recall films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crash-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000A3XY5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crash (Widescreen Edition)</a>. Yes, this low-budget movie about the lives of several people living in inner-city New York will feel instantly familiar to many filmgoers. Life is Hot in Cracktown has an advantage though that many of the films like this one do not have; without the restrictions of a Hollywood movie, this film goes places that no Hollywood production would dare go.

The film opens brutally with Romeo (Evan Ross), the ringleader of a group of thugs, leads a girl into a near-rape situation. Next, we meet Manny (Victor Rasuk) who works in both a convenience store and a low-rent hotel to be able to support his wife and child. At this hotel lives Willy, a 10-year-old boy, along with his younger sister, drug-addicted mother (Illeana Douglas), and her violent boyfriend. Finally, there's Marybeth (Kerry Washington), a pre-op transsexual and prostitute who lives with her husband Benny (Desmond Harrington).

You'll see some familiar faces too, such as Brandon Routh (a.k.a. Superman) as a friendly junkie and Thomas Ian Nicholas as a young, rookie cop.

Many, if not most, of the characters dabble in illicit drug use; specifically (you guessed it!) crack. Seeing the depths these character's have sunken to is tragic enough, but there's still more room for them to sink and the camera follows them through this process unflinchingly.

Giovinazzo has no obligation to gloss over his characters and he has no problem showing them to us in all their depraved glory. There are some scenes in this film that are truly disturbing and difficult to watch. One scene in particular has Romeo and his thugs attacking an elderly man. Some may call this scene excessive, but it does a great job of illustrating how neither Romeo nor the rest of his gang possess any capacity for sympathy.

What sets it apart from similar films and keeps it from just being a re-tread is that it gives the characters complete freedom to lead the plot to it's conclusion rather than relying on dramatic circumstances and life-affirming dynamics. There is no sense of optimism and even it's devastating, well-edited, and powerful conclusion doesn't try to lift that.

I don't know how realistic it is as a portrait of life in inner-city New York, but it is realistic in the way it seems to follow the characters to their destiny rather than throwing their destiny in front of them. At the same time, it never asks us to sympathize with or loathe anyone, but just to watch them. It's realism is furthered in its treatment of the relationship between Marybeth and Benny, which could've been exploitative or could've become parody. Giovinazzo is smart, handling it like a typical male-female relationship.

This is not a movie for just anyone and many will be turned off by its graphic content. If you're up for it, you'll find Life is Hot in Cracktown to be a raw, gritty movie with a subtle undercurrent of sensitivity. It's not perfect though and it's not unlike many other (better) movies that have come before it. It's not a masterpiece for that reason and that there's really no reason to watch the film more than once.

As the pre-op transsexual Marybeth, Kerry Washington shows depth and grace in a movie that has so little of these qualities that she seems four dimensional, and gang member Evan Ross (son of Diana) who tortures an elderly man for his welfare checks. Ross is so darkly evil that he burns the screen in his scenes. This pair of actors offer the highlights to an unrelentingly bleak film about the lowest part of a city where everyone's an addict, whore, or pimp with issues. Other than the characthers of Manny and his wife, no-one here offers any redeeming qualities. Anyone that might (the victimized old man, the cop whose been on the street just a little too long) seem like human props for the scumbags that populate cracktown to abuse.

Scenes are telegraphed way in advance and so painfully slowly that you're three steps ahead when the point gets driven home.

They are the best and worst of us all, and it shows a rugged side of humanity that most of us would rather not see ...except to realize that one of these people might have been you had you not had a few breaks.

However, they also, in spite of all those problems and mistakes, TRY their best to do whatever they can for the people they care about - and they do care about others and have others who care about them.  I think that's what hooked me into the story.  These people's lives are terrible, but they still go on having real relationships and trying to make a go of it in their own strange brand of ""normal"".  The only complaint I have - and I'm pretty sure it only applies to the R rated version of the movie that I watched - is that the editing is pretty sloppy.  Parts of scenes are cut out in a very rough manner that makes the cut extremely obvious.  I'm sure the cuts were made to obtain the R rating, but it really takes you out of the story for a few moments while you wonder what was cut instead of following what's continuing to happen on-screen.  That's why I recommend that you get the unrated version of this excellent movie rather than the R rated version.",1251849600,2,1468,4.313868613138686

I thought Evan Ross did a great job, although crackhead gang-bangers are a bit unrealistic; the crackhead girl they raped at the beginning was dressed just too nice to be a crackhead and other aspects were unrealistic, but an okay film.  I wouldn't want to see it again, though and I waited for this film.",1251676800,,349,4.4375

Being based on 'the best-selling novel', I can only hope the book was better.

The story of a prostitute transsexual (with a heart of gold) and her boyfriend the small-time burglar. Somewhat likable although they spend their days smoking crack.

Then we have the story of Willy, a ten year old who willingly cares for his younger sister, begging on the streets for money to buy food while his mother and her abusive boyfriend smoke crack.

Romeo, a gang member angry about the murder of his younger brother, terrorizes an old man for his monthly check.  Of course he also smokes crack.

The only couple I could relate to would be Manny and his wife and their sick baby.  They live in a welfare housing.  Manny works 2 jobs to support his wife and baby.  Life is stressful for them as Manny and his wife get very little time to sleep due to the all night crying of their baby.  You do feel sorry for them.

Good or bad, there is no real climax to this movie and I was happy it was over.

No depth to the characters and at times the photography made me dizzy.

Unless you're desperate to watch a movie, I'd advise you to skip this one.

Thank you.

8360323,4,B002AT4JOM,"The movie was straight, but in the beginning the rape scene was cut off and it was only featured on the deleted scene. They should play the whole movie instead of cutting the good stuff. I mean come on! That's what they did on the movie I use to see called Ms. 45! But the movie was good, but it could be better! I just give this a 4 1/2!
