Mr. Velez is a great speaker, who only gave small snippet of information regarding his methods. I was under the impression that this tape was a full seminar. No such luck. It was like a tease to get someone to buy his full, workshop for thousands of dollars. For the most part, it was extremely basic, covering investing material  (What is a trend? And ,What are candle stick charts?) which is readily available at most FREE financial sites. Half the time the charts weren't shown as he discussed them. I did however, come away with a miniscule piece of the ""swing trading pie"" (a $50 piece), which may, or may not be helpful in future trades. In fact, with incomplete information, my trading may be at more risk. Hey, you get what you pay for. Buyer beware!",1069804800,13,909,4.4431137724550895
