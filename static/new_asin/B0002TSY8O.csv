Little Joe is essentially the story of Joseph who is sold off into slavery by his other brothers after they become jealous of the special place he holds in his father's heart.  It is a story of perseverance and trust in God, as Joseph works his way from slave/prisoner to second in command to Pharoah in all of Egypt.  It is also a story of God's grace & mercy as Joseph eventually forgives his brothers because he comes to understand that their evil act was used by God to save not only the Israelite nation, but also the entire country of Egypt from 7 years of drought.

In the video, Larry the Cucumber, is ""Little Joe"", Pa Grape is his father, and the French Pea's are his jealous brothers.  Larry goes on to work in a saloon selling rootbeer and assends to the 2nd highest post of Dodgeball City.

Another success story in a long line for Big Ideas!",1177286400,,997,4.333333333333333
