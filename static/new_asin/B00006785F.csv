7962481,4,B00006785F,"The dips and lifts part is good.  There isn't much instruction for the woman on this video other than curl your arm, keep clean lines, and other few things pointed out. I guess if you have a good leader and you are a good follower you wouldn't need much. I was disappointed with the solo part.  I was expecting more instruction but she just does her thing and i guess you are supposed to learn by watching.  I really would have preferred a breakdown.  They did include a breakdown in the lifts that follow the solo.  Overall, its pretty good, especially for the men or anyone leading, but found a little lacking on the woman's part.",1208390400,,632,4.413793103448276
7962482,3,B00006785F,I would recommend this tape to anyone out there. The moves are excellant and well presented. If anything the lighting could have been better and there was too much space on the set such that the people seem to be too far back and you can't see their facial details. These are minor details however in the dance scheme of things. Good work overall.,1167177600,,347,4.4375
7962483,4,B00006785F,"Personally, I would not have cast David.  I don't know how he won any competitions quite frankly.  But I do like the series of patterns that these two offer.  They do a good job of demonstrating the move with it's name and then breaking it down with an explanation.  Additionally, they have other moves that they dance.  They don't breakdown the extras, but you can glean a few new things from them if you're capable enough.  Decent video, but the audio was rather muffled.  I'd recommend it for the actual material presented, although their style isn't what I'd hoped.",1114819200,2,569,4.686868686868687
7962484,5,B00006785F,I totally enjoyed this video. Lisa's dancing was wonderful - a level to aspire to. Dave's explanations were clear and well thought out. I especially liked the way he explained how to lead in a way that avoids injury to both the leader AND the person he is leading - I've danced with a few people I'd like to give this video to! I also like his use of slow motion on the most complex lift - very helpful. I will definitely look for more of their vidoes.,1078963200,,452,4.1477272727272725
7962485,5,B00006785F,"I bought the video after watching Lisa and Dave dance.  I was very impressed with their moves and style. I've had the video for over 2 years and I still consistently watch it.  Dave is great at explaining all the moves, including what mistakes to avoid, very important for dips. He makes it easy to follow.  I'm not a professional dancer, I've been taking lessons and the video is a great tool.  I personally love the solos.  If you want to look good at a club this is the video to buy!",1077580800,,486,4.239130434782608
7962486,5,B00006785F,"This video is awesome! David and Lisa are excellents salsa teachers. The moves are fantastic, david and Lisa break and down all the steps of a  very easy way to learn. If you want to improove your dancing i recomend this video and make shure you have a partner because if you don`t, you gonna need one.",1058486400,3,302,4.298245614035087
7962487,5,B00006785F,"This is a terrific Salsa video. The material unfolds from simple and straightforward dips to more intricate moves. There are even a couple of exotic moves that are guaranteed to ""spice up your Salsa!""
I liked the listing of moves that appears on the right side of the screen - they help me track where I am in the video. I found myself going back and forth to a few cool moves that interested me the most.  Slow-motion and freeze-frame playback let me study the moves in detail. You tend to pick up the subtler instructions after several viewings and actually trying the move.  I especially appreciated the printed subtitles that had extra instructions or tips to help understand the moves.  Even though I'm a bit of a beginner, it's clear that this video will appeal to even the most advanced dance couple.
This video should be used more like a reference manual than just an instructional video.  It's not just for competition, but will also be appealing to those who prefer clubbing.  I recommend ""Dips, Lifts and Solos to spice up your SALSA"" to dance couples of all levels. It's great fun!",1028764800,3,1093,4.642487046632124
7962488,5,B00006785F,"We found the instructional video called ""DIPS, LIFTS and SOLOS to spice up your SALSA"" with Lisa Perez and Dave Morgan to be by far, one of the best videos that finally illustrates how these awesome, impressive dips and lifts are performed.  Dave and Lisa have clearly demonstrated in a well-thought out, step-by-step manner how to execute those moves that you have always admired, wanted to try, but lacked confidence. Never has a tape shown such an easy to learn step-by-step progression of difficult dips and lifts while emphasizing safety and the consideration of others around you. In addition, the music selection was a perfect fit whether dancing on the ""1"" or ""2"" beat.
We have competed in several SALSA contests here in Europe and because of our strong free style performance have won a few, and have lost some to those who could perform these incredible crowd pleasing dips and lifts.  Now that we have the ""secret"" of how lifts and dips are performed con SABOR because of Lisa and Dave's video we will have a routine that cannot lose.  We definitely give it a 5 star.",1027987200,6,1078,4.723404255319149
7962489,5,B00006785F,"Highly recommended. This is the only video I can recommend for dips, lifts & couples styling. This is one of the best Salsa instruction videos I have seen.
This is a great video for intermediate to advanced dancers who want to learn dips & lifts for social nightclubs right up to demonstrations & competitions.
Lisa Perez and Dave Morgan cover the gentle beginner dips to some very advanced dips & lifts.
I was very impressed with the common sense of the instruction. It covers how to behave in a nightclub, how to clear space for the dips & lifts, and how to protect the female.
This is a very detailed & long video.
A demo is given showing how to use the move with in a pattern of moves. Then the move is broken down giving very detailed instruction. Common mistakes are covered. Variations of the moves are given. There are written instructions of the key points on the video.
The instruction covers both On 1 & On 2 dancers.
The styling in this video is great. The solo's at the end are a great way to show off. In fact the female styling is amongst the best I have ever seen in a video. The solo's with joined shines & lifts were great. Styling is covered for all the moves in this video.
Lisa and Dave are advanced dancers who cover all the common sense rules to protect & show off your female.
Well worth buying.",1027814400,4,1319,4.34412955465587
