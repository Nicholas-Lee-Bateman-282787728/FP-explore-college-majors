8007824,5,B00018D4L8,"Lexx is a decent sci-fi series.

I wanted more, but lexx was cancelled after 4 seasons.

No other sci-fi matches lexx, in my humble opinion.

I've seen my fair share of sci-fi.",1227398400,,176,4.4375
8007825,3,B00018D4L8,"On this DVD volume there is a good episode, a great episode!, another ""stupid teenagers"" invade The Lexx story, and a head scratcher where the writers are seriously reaching for plot.  Here are the episodes:
4.17 Dutch Treat--President Priest, First Lady Bunny, and Prince (caught inside a television set--this is completely unexplained, and seems to have no other purpose than to allow Prince some dialogue).  This has some fun editing during on sequence where President Priest and Bunny have to kill a bunch of Moth Breeders in able to regain the key to the Lexx.  Just call him ""Cowboy Priest.""  But when they finally get the key, the Lexx is too ill to go anywhere without eating first.  They let the Lexx eat Holland.  Thus the title of this episode.
4.18 The Game--Chess enthusiasts will love this episode, as I did.  Kai and Prince play a high stakes game of chess in the Other Zone where, if Prince wins, Stan and Xev will die.  If Kai wins, he will be given life by Prince so that he may finally die.  The character discrepancy that allows Kai any sort of motivation other than to kill is always questionable.  But this is, and always will be, a classic Lexx episode.
4.19 Haley's Comet--This is where the Lexx is showing it's fatigue as a show.  This is another re-do story from season 2 but with a minor plot change.  Teenagers invade the Lexx, and instead of Kai going on a murderous rampage slaughtering them all, one of the teens does it with a little motivation from psycho-Robot Head 790.  Oh, and there just happens to be a ""black pack"" on the bridge that nobody has noticed?  A ""black pack,"" for those unacquainted, is a very nasty disintegration weapon.  This is a tired episode, and if not for a couple truly dazzling special effects near the end, would be a complete waste of time.
4.20  Apocalexx Now--Lyekka, or rather a reasonable facsimile, returns to the Lexx.  Now the crew is in Vietnam, of all places, and this is another case of the makers of this show reaching for any sort of story.  There are a lot of episodes in season 4 that just don't feel like science fiction, but more along the borders of bizarre fantasy.  And just like the previous episode, the humor is either forced on the viewer or absent.  This show used to have great satire, but all too often during season 4, like in this weird episode, the story fails to enthrall.
The first two episodes here are the DVD's only saving grace, while the last two are really unnecessary viewing.  One more DVD to go...",1087344000,7,2499,4.558295964125561
