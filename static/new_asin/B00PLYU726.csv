6817740,5,B00PLYU726,"Finally, the complete Season Six, SubSeason One Box Set of the English dubbed version of Digimon Xros Wars! I have already seen all three subseasons of Digimon Fusion in Japanese, and I really want to see all three of them in English. Looking forward to the next two subseasons.",1425254400,,278,4.6938775510204085

6817742,4,B00PLYU726,"Going back to origins and giving it, it's own unique twist; digimon fusion season 1 is the beginning of a glorious adventure waiting to behold with your hands (if you buy this collection). The moment you play the first episode, you see the title sequence, you hear the music, you'll be hooked. The variety of characters, the new evolution of fusion, some of the returning voice actors of previous digimon seasons, all is worth it within this DVD collection. Bring on season 2!

The American dub it is only, but that's fine. Which aired on tv in the US?... Oh yeh, the American version of the show, so that's what's being released in the US. (Import the Japanese DVD set or alternative English dub set if you want something closer to the original script).",1421193600,2,754,4.626865671641791
6817743,1,B00PLYU726,"This is a horrible release which loses all of the majesty present in the original version. Despite the fact that a full subtitled version has already been made available, this DVD only includes the English dub, which removes all of the music, changes almost every name, and removes most of the meaning from the scripts.

Additionally, this is only presented in DVD format, despite the series having been produced in High Definition. This product is a rip off, bordering on an outright scam aimed at stealing money from honest Digimon fans. There's no reason to buy Digimon Xros Wars until they release it on blu-ray with the orginal audio track.",1420848000,7,645,4.863636363636363
6817744,5,B00PLYU726,"Like the mon says, ""don't doubt the shout"", and this news is really worth shouting about, for veteran Digi-fans AND new ones! All 30 USA-prints/episodes of the feverishly-anticipated 6th season of Digimon are finally on DVD in the USA, as a 6-disc set! It even contains a character gallery and a 12-page booklet, similar to each of seasons 1 to 5! All 6 discs also contain 2 different audio tracks, both in English of course; 2.0 Stereo sound and 5.1 Surround sound, something Cinedigm didn't think of for Data Squad, but Well Go USA did for their own sets. But I digress, this is really the 1st season of the Fusion shebang, it has 3 seasons of its own in all, and the 6th season is the first season ever made in HD-Widescreen, that's how it's presented on Nicktoons & this DVD set. (It's a crying shame Nick itself chickened out after showing the first 3 episodes of this season, but we don't have to worry about that anymore!) There's not yet any word, when I typed this, of when season 8 will be in English in the USA. At least seasons 1 to 7, including the 1st & 2nd Fusion seasons, will definitely tide us over until then. Cinedigm is releasing this set, like seasons 1 to 5, and not Lionsgate, as fans of the newer Power Rangers sagas had hypothesized. Now we can enjoy Mikey, Angie, and Jeremy's first bunch of adventures inside and out of the Digi-world, anytime we want, without needing Netflix or advanced Digital Cable or Satellite packages! In this season, there's a bunch of new species to original Digimon, just as Marcus Damon's Agumon is a different species than the one Tai Kamiya has, such as the Fusion Fighters' Starmon, Knightmon, & Deputymon, and ChibiTortomon (who's a subspecies of Kamemon and NOT Tortomon), Christopher's Greymon/MetalGreymon & Cyberdramon, Beelzemon (reborn from Reapmon), Etemon, Shurimon, Machinedramon, MegaKabuterimon (red AND blue!), several unspecified species of Trailmon, and Mantaraymon. It's sure not easy trying to save the Digi-world, zone by zone, Code Crown by Code Crown, from Bagramon (alias Lord Bagra) and his endless armies of goons, AND also trying to figure out AxeKnightmon's mysterious agenda with Nene and her little brother Ewan; but luckily, Mikey has his red Fusion Loader digivice that enables Digi-fuses, be they stronger forms like Digivolutions, living weaponry/gadgetry, or both at once! Many veteran Digimon actors and crew members returned for Fusion, and thank goodness for that. You also get to hear ""Numbuh 2"", or Hoagie, of Codename: Kids Next Door playing Shoutmon (in all his forms so far), Cutemon and his missing daddy, and many minor roles to boot; as with Jeremy sounding like Ken, Angie sounding like Sora and Yoshi (2 other famous human redheads in Digi-history), Nene sounding like Rika and Kristy, Sparrowmon sounding like Zoe, SkullMeramon sounding similar to MegaSeadramon in season 2 but with punk-like flair, AncientVolcanomon sounding like Bruce from Finding Nemo, Starmon and the leader of the Etemon ninjas sounding like Elvis (in a similar way to Etemon/MetalEtemon in season 1 and SuperStarmon in season 4), Gargoylemon sounding like Arnold Schwarzenegger himself, and Damemon sounding like Neemon. At the end of each episode is a profile on a specific Digimon called Data Files or Digimon Data Collection, told by Monitamon in episodes 1 to 12, and by Mikey in episodes 13 to 30, as well as sneak peeks of the next episode, or next season in the case of this season's last episode, told by Mikey and/or Shoutmon. What's more, Coronamon and Lunamon make their first animated appearances with this season, when they got their start with Digimon World Dawn/Dusk for the Nintendo DS systems in 2007. There's still some natural digivolving to behold in this season, such as with Lucemon, Damemon, and Shoutmon himself, but the level system was never used here, like with season 4 but noticeably more so. It's great to hear of Fusion being on DVD in 2015, but it's still a crying shame that there still isn't a Digimon Movie Collection, in the USA anyway. If you wish to see Digimon continue after Data Squad and hate to consult advanced cable packages or even YouTube for Fusion, go ahead and add Fusion to your Digimon season sets collection, be they on DVD or Digital Download, today! It's hard to believe that this was on DVD the same day as Disney's 101 Dalmatians came to DVD & Blu-ray (and its animated sequel from 2003 also, but only from the Disney Movie Club), and the 75th anniversary of the world's most famous cat-and-mouse duo, Tom and Jerry (February 10th), on top of Race For Your Life, Charlie Brown finally being on DVD! It would take another Christmas miracle to hear of a Digimon Movie Collection on DVD, like Data Squad and Fusion have already done. Please make season 8 (#3 of Fusion) come soon, Nicktoons! And for Cinedigm to release a Digimon Movie Collection here in the USA, once and for all! BRING 'EM ON!!! (Please?)",1416182400,14,4940,4.8612099644128115
