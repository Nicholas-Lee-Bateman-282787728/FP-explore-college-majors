8301372,3,B001FACHAA,"I watched this after seeing the Tom Cruise movie, to hopefully get more details to fill in the history of the plot.  It is about an hour long, and starts with a detailed history of the rise of Hitler.  After about 30 minutes, we haven't delved too much into the plot.  The last ten minutes seemed rushed, discussing the failed plot, and subsequent executions of the plotters.  There could have been more coverage of the kangaroo trials than there was, and also it totally was silent on the piano wire strangulation of some of the plotters.  It shows the meathooks, with no explanation that this was the hanging room, and that Hitler had the slow deaths filmed so he could watch it.  This would be a good film for someone without a lot of knowledge of the Nazi regime and rise to power, but doesn't have enough of the title subject in its content.",1257120000,7,846,4.461038961038961
8301373,2,B001FACHAA,"This documentary is nothing new even though it purports to augment the Valkyrie plot story with details.  It was disappointing and mercifully short.  It doesn't go into the kind of detail I was hoping for in regard to the setting of the stage for the audacious revolt which was attempted and which failed so spectacularly.
I suspect there are much better productions out there somewhere.",1245283200,7,387,4.938461538461539
8301374,4,B001FACHAA,"Killing Hitler: The True Story Of The Valkyrie Plot is one of several films on the topic. It is fairly good in comparison to the others.
