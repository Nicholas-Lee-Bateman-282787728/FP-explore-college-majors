618929,5,6303232221,"This is one of the most hilarious things I've watched on tape. The Muppets do their versions of several classic stories.

Including:

The Emperor's New Clothes

The Boy Who Cried Wolf

King Midas

Three Little Pigs

Rumpelstiltskin

The Elves and the Shoemaker

It's something I can watch over and over. And my favorite part of the entire movie deals with my title: the song they sing during Rumpelstiltskin when trying to guess his name. Priceless.",1156464000,9,449,4.8933333333333335
618930,5,6303232221,Who doesn't love a fairy tale? Now imagine your favorite fairy tale with a new humoristic twist performed by the muppets and you have unstoppable laughter. The songs are catchy and I found my daughters singing them after watching this movie. Muppets are supposed to be fun and this movie is an fine example of their very best. This movie has been viewed many times in our household.,1121212800,7,382,4.632352941176471
618931,3,6303232221,"The Muppets are still the Muppets. I agree that since Jim Henson died, it seems to take a lot more effort to put together something worthy of their original off the wall charm, but it can and has be done in Muppet Christmas Carol and Muppets Tonight!. Muppet Classic Theater shows us that the focus has shifted to Gonzo and Rizzo since Dave Goelz and Steve Whitmire are among the few Muppeteers still dedicated exclusively to Muppet projects. Granted, these stories are rushed and simplistic and the songs are mediocre, but the work Goelz and Whitmire put in reminds us that these are still the characters we love. It's much like seeing your favorite actors in a bad movie. The story isn't so hot, but you can tell they've still got it and will go onto do better things.",1118793600,4,770,4.546762589928058
618932,5,6303232221,"We love this video.  It's funny, warm and fozzy!  We love it so much we want to add it to our DVD LIBRARY, so please put it on DVD soon!",1077062400,5,136,3.5
618933,5,6303232221,"In this awesome video collection, the Muppets take turns at telling six spoofs of classic fairy tales. The six stories told are ""The Three Little Pigs"", ""King Midas"", ""Rumplestiltskin"", ""The Boy Who Cried Wolf"", ""The Elves & The Shoemaker"", and ""The Emperor's New Clothes"". This video is hilarious and during a couple of the stories I was laughing so hard I couldn't breathe. My favorite in the collection is ""The Elves & The Shoemaker"". A tape that everyone in the family is sure to enjoy. Gotta love the Muppets.",1014940800,20,514,4.786516853932584

7842819,5,6303232221,"This may not be one of the most popular Muppets videos, but I do not know why! In it we have a few separate fairy tales all supposedly narrated and introduced by The Great Gonzo. It is just as funny and enjoyable as every other Muppet film and I HIGHLY recommend it to everyone!",1506902400,,278,4.166666666666667

7842822,5,6303232221,"I wish this movie would be released on DVD! I watched it hundreds of times as a kid (and can still sing most of the songs from memory!) and I keep watching for it to be released on DVD, but it hasn't been yet. PLEASE bring it out on DVD, I know there are a lot of kids (and adults) that would love to be able to watch it- it's so hard to find a working VHS player that won't die on you.",1471219200,,386,3.6626506024096384

7842826,4,6303232221,I grew up with this video but I somehow misplaced it. It took me a few years to find another copy until I finally found it on Amazon.com. A few of the musical numbers were lengthy yet annoying though.,1434672000,,200,4.153846153846154
