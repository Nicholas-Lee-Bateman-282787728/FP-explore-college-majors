7994504,2,B00009YXER,"I didn't like this. I tried and tried to watch it all the way the through but I couldn't.  The music was good but I was tired of hearing it.  They broke out in some kind of musical number every 10-15 minutes.  They told the story both threw acting and music, which is ok, but I was tired of it.  I don't want to listen to rap music for hours. The movie description and the movie itself seemed not to match to me either.  I don't know.  Redo the movie and remove the music and you might have a pretty good show.",1293408000,,510,3.950980392156863
7994505,5,B00009YXER,"This is the best ""thug motivation-type"" movie I've seen in a long time,eventhough it's been out for a long time now? I didn't even know it existed unitl Amazon put it in my recomemdations. It was worth buying and watching because it really brought out street survival. Although I didn't like the ending, because it left you wondering?",1218672000,,334,4.775862068965517
7994506,5,B00009YXER,"I bought this movie and watched it twice so far. It is an excellent movie.  I don't know what people mean by bad acting, because I think the acting was great in this movie.  That is how people act in the streets.  I liked the story line, loved the music, and loved the sad parts of the movie.  I love the funeral scene, it feels like I'm in the same church crying with them. Very nice movie this was indeed.  I doubt anybody I know in the offline world would like this movie, but they are not street life fanatics like me.",1092441600,,522,4.078431372549019
7994507,4,B00009YXER,"OK LETS GET ONE THING STRAIGHT, THE RAPPERS IN THE MOVIE ARE TIGHT AS HELL!!! BUT THAT IS THE BEST PART OF THE MOVIE.  I GOT THE SURROUND SOUND IN THE BASEMENT AND IT RUMBLES THROUGH MY HOUSE. I LUV IT.  I'M NOT BIG ON INDEPENDENT FILMS BUT THIS ONE IS A HIT. AND TIFFANY, SHE'S FINE!!!!!!",1063238400,,289,4.052631578947368
7994508,2,B00009YXER,"The opening, title and credit graphics were excellent.  The overall film was, at the least, a decent portrayal of urban, African-American men fighting against the odds and obstacles to reach their dreams.  However, one can also see from watching this film that urban life can have an unyielding hold on you.  One bright spot, which is definitely a reason that this movie will be a staple on my video shelf, is the character of Tiffany.  Not only was she one of the few characters in the movie that can actually act, that girl is fine as hell and her semi-nude scenes didn't hurt either.  Get this movie if you like urban/gangster/rapper/shoot-em-up fare.  And I know the TIFFANY character will have you watching over and over again.",1061510400,,732,4.76984126984127
