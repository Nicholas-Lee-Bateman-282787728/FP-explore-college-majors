8356746,5,B0028RXZFK,"On April 22-27, 2008, Dr. Geeta S. Iyengar taught a benefit workshop for Ascent magazine at the Yasodhara Ashram in Kootenay Bay, British Columbia, Canada. This series of videos documents this unique learning experience as Dr. Geeta S. Iyengar presents a compressed series of progressive asana and pranayama classes. Questions and answers are also included.

Extremely useful, Dr. Geetaji provides detailed instructions regarding body alignment, points that one need to watch out etc. to get into a particular asana. Her style is to first have Abhi (Guruji's grand daughter) provide a demo and then Dr. Geetaji gets into the details. In the workshop she also showed where people go wrong frequently and what one should be careful about. Overall these DVDs are very useful if you are interested in learning Iyengar Yoga. There is a great possibility for non native speakers of English to not understand Dr. Geetaji's accent but since she repeats the instructions multiple times, there shouldn't be a strong barrier to understand her messages.",1442361600,,1041,5.233532934131737

She has Abhijata (BKS Iyengar's grandaughter) demonstrate the asana, then the whole class does the pose, then Geetaji demonstrates how to make corrections and adjustments to the pose. This is a Gem!",1388361600,6,347,5.0
