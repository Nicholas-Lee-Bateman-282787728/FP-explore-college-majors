8168736,4,B000MGEPVW,"Feels like ""In a league of their own,"" for lifeguarding.  The voice-over is a relic of a bygone, sexist era, but the actual work depicted in the film shows some very serious lifeguard training.  Although the picture quality is at times quite poor, I would recommend this short DVD to anyone training lifeguards.  Some of the training of lifeguards has changed quite a bit, some of the resuscitation techniques of the time are pretty amusing.  On the other hand, these women seem to have undergone more rigorous physical training than today's lifeguards, and some principles of vigilance and water rescue really haven't changed.",1236124800,,627,5.058252427184466
