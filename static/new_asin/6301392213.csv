7811465,2,6301392213,"Bought this more or less to check out an older Georgina Spelvin (star of The Devil In Miss Jones) in a legitimate role. Not really a heck of a lot going on in this flick. Suppose I'd categorize it best as a mildly-erotic psychological horror flick, but not a particularly good or enduring one. Pretty much one of those movies I'd already forgotten about within hours of seeing it. Spelvin is quite a ways past her prime here, so if one is buying this because she's in it, well...unless you have a thing for mature, disheveled-looking women, there may not be much here for you. Mildly amusing in a (low)b-grade movie kind of way.",1205193600,3,628,4.517543859649122
7811466,3,6301392213,"This is one of those overblown cheesy direct to video movies that tries to take itself so seriously and goes over the top. Linda blair is the best actress in the movie and shes only in it for about 20 minutes!
its about a husband and wife who run into a famous paintist(ruth raymond who claims that he is her long lost son. well this bad mother won't take no for an answer as she kidnaps him and ah, well i won't say what happens. the ending is unbelievable. actually the last hour of the film is unbelievable. its so bad its good but its still bad. (that maid was a pretty bad actress).
but for your money's worth you get a catfight between ruth in a wedding dress and her son's adoptive mother. not once, but about three times! ater its over youll shake your head but youll get a few good laughs at least. well i did anyway.",1058572800,5,826,4.16875
