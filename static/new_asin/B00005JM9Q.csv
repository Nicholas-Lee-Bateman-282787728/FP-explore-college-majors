1486323,5,B00005JM9Q,"I went to see this movie yesterday, May 2nd. I had been waiting anxiously to see it for weeks. It was a fantastic movie! The theater was full, from elders to toddlers and teenagers. Everybody loved this movie! If you are a big fan of the Lizzie Mcguire show on Disney channel, you will enjoy this movie. If you haven't even heard of the show,, make sure you still see it!",1051920000,,371,4.23943661971831
1486324,5,B00005JM9Q,"Fans of Lizzie McGuire are in for a really feel-good movie that gives them what they want. The class trip scenes (with Kate, Ethan, Gordo, and Miss Ungermeyer) are fun, while the scenes with Lizzie and Paolo are really sweet. Plus, it gets extra hilarious when the movie switches over to Matt and the parents. If you think the plot was completely given away in the trailers, you are in for a huge surprise. Any fan will be cheering towards the end when something happens that we've all wanted to see for years...  The Lizzie McGuire Movie is a special way to end the show.",1051833600,,572,4.447619047619048

1486476,3,B00005JM9Q,"The Lizzie McGuire Movie is a fun watch, but its quite as much for 40-something moms as for their daughters. While the series is for the kids, this movies delicious Italian setting and vulnerable, ditzy young girl off on an adventure inspires the radically overprotective in their moms. Lizzies all-American ways and obsessive basket heels can get a little irritating (the movie is almost 15 years old, after all), but parents will only have eyes for the two boys, Paolo and Gordo, as they have secret designs on her. A grown-up chick-flick disguised as a D-Com, and something for the family to watch together.",1500076800,,610,4.875

So if your one of those individuals debating on living back in that moment, or wanting to share it with a special little human then don't even think about it! JUST DO IT!

The movie is stupid funny. One of those movies that has you cracking up at one of the stupidest lines ever. I think that kind f comedy is the best. People not trying to be funny makes things funny, the actors definitely do a great job playing their parts and the kids in the movie were also hilarious. Please watch it! You will not regret it. Very pleased with the movie and how easy it was to watch from my iPad. I love Hillary Duff she was so funny and just a great actor all around.

1487492,5,B00005JM9Q,"I purchased this movie as a birthday gift for the daughter of one of my friends.  Although the Disney Television production - and movies - about Lizzie McGuire were viewed years ago, they remain popular.  The popularity was based on real-life experiences which a young girl, her family and friends are confronted with in a society where several standards and choices are available.  Adam Lamberg plays the part of her best friend, ""Gordo""
and both of them deal with tough issues for young teenagers without succumbing to sex, drugs or political correctness.  In the movie, Hilary Duff
and her usual entourage of supporting actors were superb according to my friends who agree with their daughter, this is an excellent family movie
with several good messages about family loyalty and self-respect.",1426464000,,796,5.1

1487917,5,B00005JM9Q,Lizzie McGuire does not disappoint when she says that this movie is what dreams are made of. The terrible storyline and awful lip-synching pay homage to the greatest movies of our generation. Flawless.,1388707200,,201,5.121212121212121

1487923,5,B00005JM9Q,"I grew up watching the Lizzie McGuire TV show and I think the movie is just as good. Everyone seems to be complaining about how unrealistic it is- it's a Disney movie, so it's to be expected. Of course none of it could happen in real life, but that's all the fun of watching it! There'd be no point in watching a movie where she goes on a normal trip and nothing happens, that'd be boring. If all you want is to enjoy some harmless Disney fluff that's fun and not supposed to be taken too seriously, I think you'll really enjoy this film. If you want a movie that is realistic and serious, you'll be disappointed. If you know what kind of a film you're watching beforehand, you'll know what to expect. Anyway, I think it's a great classic Disney film, very entertaining, fun, and enjoyable and some great music too. The scenery in Italy is also very beautiful.",1375488000,4,860,4.38125

When I opened the package the disc was loose and when I looked at the bottom of the disc, it had smears all over the dvd when the disc is suppose to play. I also figured I would get the disc in a day or two after I ordered because I live in the State where the disc was being shipped. So it took longer then I would have liked.

1488119,5,B00005JM9Q,"Disney Channel has had a hard time adapting their pre-teen series into movies, but The Lizzie McGuire Movie was an exception, despite the fact that the character Miranda was written off.

Lizzie and her best-friend Gordo along with Ethan, Kate, and their other classmates go on a school trip to Italy! Lizzie is mistaken for Italy's biggest singer, Isabella, and Lizzie falls for Isabella's singing partner, Paolo. When Isabella goes missing before an upcoming event, Lizzie must learn how to lip-sing and act like Lizzie. Meanwhile, Lizzie's little brother, Matt, knows the truth about Lizzie. He convinces his parents that he misses his sister and that they should go visit her.

The movie is not perfect, but it is a clean-cut family film.",1346457600,4,742,5.024390243902439

All my friends and I used to watch the TV show/movie . In fact, I am pretty sure I had the movie soundtrack. Not to mention that a lot of girls from our area went to a Hilary Duff concert not too long after the movie released. This show/movie brings back a lot of memories! I am considering purchasing the DVD to watch strictly for nostalgic purposes. I'm not saying that you should buy this movie for your teenager, but I am saying that I really enjoyed it as a child and I'd watch it again to reminisce.",1328140800,,655,4.0852713178294575

Also, the drama is interesting but not too intense or cheesy. I bought the soundtrack several years ago, and I enjoy it immensely. This is a good chick flick or a movie to be watched with a younger audience. I would reccomend The Lizzie McGuire movie to anyone wanting an entertaing movie that isn't too much geared toward younger people.",1316131200,,497,4.790697674418604

Plus Gordo was really cute and endearing in this movie and he finally got to kiss Lizzie.  The final musical number totally pushed the movie over the top and into the perfect level of corniness.,1271721600,,332,4.426229508196721

1488316,4,B00005JM9Q,"I bought this movie for my niece for her seventh birthday & see loved it.  This movie is good it goes along with the story line of the Disney tv show ""Lizzie McGuire"".  The movie is typicall about teenage love. Lizzie & her school class went to Rome and she meet a cute pop star within first arriving named Paolo.  Paolo is nice,sweet, and good looking.  Lizzie & Paolo have fun tobgether because he shows her Rome and he is going to make her a star.  The whole time she is with Paolo she is leaving Gordo to cover for her.

1488319,4,B00005JM9Q,"I really enjoyed the Lizzie McGuire movie. It was light and entertaining.

But I don't know if I would want my daughter to watch it because it's based on deception and I am really concerned about her not learning the wrong thing.

Lizzie is pretending to get sick so she could sneak out and do other things.  But for those who already know right from wrong and won't be convinced that lying is ok based on this movie, it's entertaining.",1171065600,,436,4.425
1488320,1,B00005JM9Q,"The only thought in my mind throughout this whole movie was the Natalie Holloway case, about the girl last summer that went on that school trip, went off with a boy and disappeared. In this movie, Hilary Duff's character is on a school trip to Rome, meets a guy there and then fakes sick to get away from the school group to follow this guy around Rome. I felt so bad that Disney had made this movie showing a young girl going off on her own with a boy she did not know on a school trip because it rang so close to home from that tragic dissappearance of Natalie Holloway. In this movie the only repurcussions the character gets for doing such completely unsafe acts was that she was grounded..and they didn't even show that part. Young girls are very impressionable and will jsut see the glamour in the movie.

However, a Kid, on Dec. 29, 2005, wrote that this was a great, ""family film"". I have to disagree. This movie is more geared towards 9-year-old Lizzie fans and their moms...not a good movie to sit down with some Jujubees and your dad and brother (trust me...they'd rather be watching some sweaty guys get the snot kicked out themselves.)

I've watched this movie COUNTLESS times, and I'm STILL not tired of it. (Plus, the end gave us the Lizzie/Gordo action we'd all been waiting for since Seas. 1!)

In addition, I wanted to see more of Sam, Jo, and Matt.  However, I loved the parts with Matt and Melina together.  I missed Lanny Onasis (Matt's silent, but profound friend), Larry Tudgeman, and Claire too.  Lizzie's graduating class sure looked different from her class on the series.  Plus, there were too many ""explanations"" and discontinuities.  When was she elected secretary/treasurer of the student council?  And, she didn't get to go to the spring fling dance.

Hilary's performance was okay;Yanni's performance was stereotypical.  The supporting cast rocked, actually.

All in all, it was a nice way to end the series.  I don't see how they could've made an effective sequel, so I'm glad they stopped here.",1123891200,,878,4.972413793103448

1488531,1,B00005JM9Q,"I screen everything before I let my 6 year old daughter watch it, and her cousin had recommended the Lizzie McGuire TV show. I found it safe, wonderful family fare. I must admit, I enjoyed the show almost as much as my daughter, and often watched it with her. But also, as a mother, the one thing I have always appreciated about Lizzie McGuire is that it gives me lots of opportunities to have little teaching moments. This movie was no exception in that respect. Despite her parents not being as involved in the movie as this parent would have liked, we still often hit the pause button to talk about what was going on and why. It made for a great first mother/daughter chick flick.

Yes, the plot is a little ""out there"" at times (what high school would send out a field trip with just one chaperone?). But Lizzie plots have done that many times before, and we still loved the show. The sight of Ethan Craft flying back and forth on his skateboard in his hotel room delivering lines on perfect cue still rings in my memory, and is one of my most favorite scenes. It also tells you that for as hillariously dumb as the character is, the actor behind it is quite talented. Also notable was Sergi- the stereotypical bodyguard who successfully integrated stone-cold comedy with a warm and tender heart.

We missed Miranda deeply, and it would have been nice to have her family a bit more involved- perhaps chaperoning, can you imagine Matt loose in Rome? But we had a cameo from Melina, who is always great fun. Adam Lamberg did a wonderful job as Gordo, and had some really great moments as the ever devoted, silently in love, way-too-far-beyond-his-years Gordo. It allowed Hillary Duff to transition her career into a show performer with a great number at the end. Disney is not known for suspense films, the plot twists could be seen a mile away. But for as predicitble as the plot was, it even managed a surprise ending- the redemption of Kate Sanders!

This is the stereotypical Disney fare- family safe and great fun. Well worth the investment. Though I really did miss the outtakes at the end...",1120694400,,2100,4.56498673740053

I think Lizzie's other best friend, Miranda, should have been in it.  It wasn't the same without her.  Yes, get ready for a few surprises in this flick.  Hilary Duff's movies, for the most part, are really good.  However, I think her latest movie, The Perfect Man, is compromised and is hardly as good as her other movies.  This movie is a good one to rent or buy.  Some other good movies from Hilary Duff are A Cinderella Story, Cadet Kelly, Cheaper By the Dozen, and Raise Your Voice.",1119484800,,673,4.4227642276422765

HILARY ON A VESPA!). Also, what's with the PG rating? This is kid's stuff!

Luckily, Lizzie is off to Rome with her high school principal-to-be (Alex Borstein of Miss Swan/Mad TV fame) and a group of her new classmates, including snobby Kate and her best friend Gordo.

In Rome, Lizzie runs into dreamy Italian Paolo, (Yani Gellman) who is struck by Lizzie's beauty and innocent charm.  Paolo wants her to fill in for his singing partner, Isabella (also played by Duff) to whom Lizzie bears a striking resemblance.  But Ms. Ungermeyer is a strict chaperone, and anyone caught breaking the rules will be on a plane back home.

Banking on the popularity of the half-hour comedy series ""Lizzie McGuire"", Disney did a great job reuniting 98% of the show's original cast, including the-dare I say it?-HOT Ashlie Brillault as Lizzie's nemesis, the lovely Kate Sanders. Don't misunderstand me though, I LOVE Lizzie; she is down to earth and sooo lovable. The soundtrack to this movie is AWESOME!! I think the movie's PG rating was just to attract older kids to seeing this family comedy. ""Pirates Of The Caribbean"" would be rated PG-13 the following summer and was a huge hit because a lot of people went to see it-in spite of the rating, because there was nothing objectionable in the film; just pure Disney fun.

All the characters from the tv show such as the ""evil"" Kate Sanders who turns her confident in this movie and also Lizzie's best and loyal friend ""Gordo"" who is soooo sweet and really an example of loyalty and finally (in his way) declares his love to Lizzie AAAAW!!! .

First of all, the cast and scenery.  All the characters seemed a little different in some way, not completely the same.  And Lizzie had a different house from that on the show.  Second, the whole movie was basically about Lizzie blowing off Gordo and lying to get out of tours so she could hang out with Paolo.  I found that to also be different from the TV series.  Usually Lizzie is at least a LITTLE nicer than that.  I also think certain things were taken to extremes in the movie, such as Matt, and Mr. and Mrs. McGuire flying all the way to Rome just because Matt missed Lizzie and the dad thought she might be around boys that wanted to be her boyfriend.  There were a few things I liked, though, such as how Lizzie and Kate got along in some parts.

Oh, sorry, there was no plot. The so called ""story"" revolves around Hilary Duff prancing around Rome like an idiot. Hilary Duff is possibly the worst actress ever born. She also could never pass as a singer, however, the computer that is supposed to be her voice is pretty good. There are no less then eight musical montages each lasting about five minutes. You do the math. The last is a disgrace to civilization, especially Italy. Hilary Duff ""sings"" and dances around on a stage in the Colosseum. If I lived in Italy I would be mortally offended. However coming from the U.S. I am offended that this movie came from the land I call home.

  You wonder how they got someone who looks excatly like Hilary Duff only with brown hair and a fake Italian accent. It couldn't have been Hilary Duff in a wig *wink wink* because that would've been so stupid even the producers would know not to do that.

  All in all, this movie was horrible and you should never buy it, or even see it for that matter, if you don't want to suffer beyond human belief.

1488734,3,B00005JM9Q,"When Warner has Amanda Bynes and 'What a Girl Wants,' Disney has its own starlet, charming Hiraly Duff as Lizzie McGuire.  She is more famous as pop singer here in Japan (and more popular as singer), but the film sadly went to video straight (while 'What a Girl' was theatrically released at theatres run by Warner).  So, is this so bad, as some critics say?  Not exactly.

The story is just an excuse for the entended running time in which Lizzie has another misadventure, this time in Rome.  Lizzie and her friends travel to Italy guided by glum teacher Ms. Ungermeyer.  There, for some reasons I don't believe, Lizze is mistaken for Italian pop singer, and more incredibly, has to play the role for the distraught (but hunky) Italian idol singer, who welcomes the secret replacement.

All these set-ups are made for Lizzie to sing in front of the audience ... and in a big stadium.  The picture-perfect location of Rome is all shot with the postcard beauty, and Lizzie is always in the middle of that.  And of course, her best friend Gordo never fails to help her out in every difficulty, even though in a clumsy way, and his platonic admiration for Lizzie, or love maybe, is quite sincerely expressed.

The film has has potentially disturbing elements -- the nagging teacher could be a bully; the peksy brother of Lizzie could be annoying; and her parents could be more wooden.  But all ends well, in a miraculous way, and that's not a bad thing.  After all, it's Disney, you remember.

I don't say acting is perfect, or great for that matter, but I don't think it's as bad as some people say, and Hilary Duff shows fairly good turn playing double roles.  And when she must be 'Lizzie' here, who cannot change her image on TV she was doing for four years, you cannot blame her.  This is what Disney has been doing -- like the beloved duo of Annette and Frankie in 'Beach' movies series, and why not Hilary Duff?

'The Lizzie McGuire Movie' is fluff, sure, but it's lovely fluff (and why not?), for it's Hilary Duff, who is undoubtedly cute, lovely, and most importantly, accesable.  She could be your daughter, your neighbor, or your friend at school, having the very affable quality.  And that's why we like her, isn't it?",1095984000,,2227,4.594936708860759

Hilary Duff plays the clumsy, yet charming young Lizzie McGuire who journeys to Rome for a school trip. Disney could not have picked a better location for Rome is one of my favorite cities. The movie does well to highlight certain sites, the Colosseum, the Roman Forum, Villa d'Este (which isn't even in Rome but just northeast of it) and a montage scene when Lizzie arrives in Rome is a nice addition. After Lizzie finds herself mistaken for an Italian pop star (strange coincidence isn't it?) she goes on a whirlwind adventure trying to sneak past Ms. Ungermeyer, her teacher, who is an enjoyable character herself, while enjoying the delights of Rome.

It is a little difficult seeing Lizzie McGuire as an unpopular girl in her grade. She is way too cute to not be part of the in-crowd and has a fantastic wardrobe (although I could not imagine walking around the cobblestone streets of Rome in the hot Mediterranean sun in heels) while Lizzie's quasi-nemesis Kate wears suits daily and is mean to everyone.

Bottom line is that this is a fun, believe-in-yourself-and-your-dreams-will-come-true Disney story. A true guilty pleasure. Just enjoy it!",1090972800,3,1336,4.928888888888889

And the Lizzie McGuire TV show hasn't really appeared here either, although I did see a tiny clip of it today when I was flicking channels. So to say she hasn't made much of an impact here, is an understatement. So what better way to make an impact, than release a movie? Which is what she does!
The movie has all the major characters from the TV series, so instantly you're lost, as the characters are so well-known in America, they don't bother to think about introductions, for the people who haven't seen the TV show. The only person who's really identifiable as being famous is Hilary Duff, but that's only because of her teen romance with Aaron Carter (younger brother of Nick, Backstreet Boys) a few years ago.
The only other 'major' star in this is Alex Borstein (Miss Ungermeyer), who I had quite a bit of trouble placing. She hasn't really starred in that much, having bit parts in Friends and Coyote Ugly. So if you think you recognise her, you'll have to rack what little brains you have to realise who she is. I'll give you a clue - you know her voice better than you probably know her face! And you'll probably recognise her name more, due to seeing it in credits. She's only the voice(s) for Lois Griffin/Loretta/Tricia Takanawa/Barbara Pewterschmidt, to name but a few from Family Guy! Which I thought was pretty cool!
What was best about this movie? The little alter-ego Lizzie cartoon interstitials, which are so funny! They're confusing to begin with, as they're probably a prominent part in the TV series.
In this Hilary plays two people - Lizzie, and Isabella. Who are both exactly the same, except one is blonde, and one is brunette. When you see Isabella at the start of the movie, she doesn't look a thing like Hilary Duff, but that kinda changes towards the end.
As far as I can tell, this was basically the swan-song for the TV series, which has since ended, and all the film is really doing is pushing Hilary as a singer. For a singer, she's OK, but not really anything special. She's blonde, she's pretty, she's American, she has clear skin, how many other singers do we know like that? So whereas she has an OK voice, she has to be a bit more unique, and try and get away from the Disney sweet as sugar image she has at the moment.
This is a good film, to just sit and watch, and relax. Forget about all the stresses and strains of life. And have a good old moan about the fact that you can totally tell Hilary Duff is 'pasted' (for want of a better word) onto the Colosseum backdrop/starry sky.",1089590400,2,3044,4.476618705035971
1488840,2,B00005JM9Q,"But Hilary Duff can SERIOUSLY not act. And the bad part is, this is a pretty decent plot for a TV show spin-off. Completely unrealistic, but still decent.
It's about a girl named Lizzie (Duff) who goes on a class trip to Rome. Her best friend, David Gordon (Gordo, as a nickname) goes with her, along with most of the kids in her grade. When in Rome, she meets a famous Italian singing star, Paolo, and, surprise, surprise, she looks EXACTLY like Paolo's counterpart singer, Isabella (Duff, again).
Lizzie gets a major crush on Paolo (again, surprise, surprise) and she agrees to impersonate Isabella in the upcoming music awards show. (Isabella, Paolo said, lip-synched and left the group because Paolo wanted to 'develop as an artist' and she didn't.)
Well, in the end, everything is sorted out. Gordo finds Isabella and learns that SHE was the one that wanted to develop her music career. Paolo is exposed as having the terrible voice that he does, and Gordo and Lizzie have their first kiss.
As I said, Duff's acting isn't up to par, and she's supposed to be the one that carries the whole movie. The plot is unrealistic, and at times the actors and actresses don't seem to have chemistry together.

1488893,3,B00005JM9Q,"I babysit for a ten year old girl and she absolutely adores this movie. Every time I babysit her she puts it on, and I don't really have a problem with that. I don't like the Lizzie McGuire TV show, but the movie was actually pretty cute.
It starts off with Lizzie in her room dancing and singing on the day of her junior high graduation. She's excited about growing up and moving on in her life. But at graduation, she totally embarasses herself - she trips and falls, which ends up in a curtian falling on the graduating class.
Thankfully, Lizzie has the chance to forget her problems when she goes on her class trip to Rome - two weeks with no parents, her best friend, and her arch nemisis Kate is nowhere in sight. Until things take a turn for the worse, and Kate decides to go after all - and she rooms with Lizzie once they actually get to Rome. On the first day of sightseeing, Lizzie meets up with the popular Italian singer Paolo. He asks if he can see her again, and soon she's faking sick to be able to hang out with him. He tells her that she looks just like his old singing partner, but with blonde hair instead of brown, and somehow she ends up singing with him at a big awards show.
This movie is cute, but totally predictable and sugarcoated. I recommed it for younger kids though, because it doesn't have any dirty humor or language. THE LIZZIE MCGUIRE MOVIE isn't Oscar-worthy, but its a cute movie to watch with a group of friends.
Overall grade - C",1084060800,,1469,4.287769784172662
1488894,4,B00005JM9Q,"I had never seen the television version of ""Lizzie McGuire"" and all I really know about Hillary Duff is that her mom does not like Lindsay Lohan (I bought a copy of Duff's CD for my daughter for Christmas and completely spaced that out).  But it did not take long to pick up on who is who in ""The Lizzie McGuire Movie.""  Hillary Duff is Lizzie McGuire, who is having trouble being a teenager, mainly because her pesky younger brother Matt (Jake Thomas) is videotaping her worst moments for posterity and/or blackmailing purposes while mom (Jo McGuire) and dad (Robert Carradine) are supportive but essentially clueless.  Her best friend Gordo (Adam Lamberg) is obviously smitten with Lizzie, but all she sees is her best friend Gordo.  Kate (Ashlie Brillault) is the snobby girl who makes Hillary feel inferior and Ethan (Clayton Snyder) is the resident space cadet.  So getting up to speed is not a problem.  That comes when we get to the plot.
Having graduated junior high, which was a disaster in and of itself, Lizzie and her classmates immediately head for Rome as part of some strange program at their new high school that sends freshmen on a trip to Europe so they can get some appropriate degree of culture that will allow them to do well.  Their chaperone is their principal, Miss Ungermeyer (Alex Borstein), because she has nothing better to do in the summer but indoctrinate incoming freshman while in a foreign land.
Once they get into Rome things get complicated.  Lizzie runs into Paolo Valisari (Yani Gallman), an Italian pop idol who says she looks exactly like his singing partner, Isabella, except Lizzie is a blond.  It seems Isabella is mad at Paolo and they are going to get sued if they do not show up to present an award at an award show at Coliseum.  So, of course, Lizzie should take Isabella's place.  But it turns out to be a lot more complicated than that, which is just a way of setting up the big finale involving Lizzie McGuire singing a new hit song by Hillary Duff (that was probably on that aforementioned Hillary Duff album).
Now, this is all completely standard teenage movie fare, where the movie is not over until the same actress playing two different characters shows up.  But in the finale of this one, once it is explained what is really going on with Paolo's plan, it turns out to be really stupid (if the plan worked it would not have worked, take my word for it).  Still, it is all just an excuse for a big production at the number, so what is really the problem here?
""The Lizzie McGuire Movie"" has several things going for it.  First, Duff can turn the world on with her smile and she gets to do that a lot.  Second, the supporting cast from the show are all comfortable in their roles and I really liked Gordo from the moment he woke up on the plan and realized that Lizzie was sleeping nestled against him; the look on his face told the whole story.  Third, most of the film is set in Rome and they take full advantage of the spectacularly beautiful sites to convince you this is where you want to plan your next trip.  As long as Lizzie is riding around on the back of Paolo's scooter at least nothing stupid can happen with the plot.  The bottom line is that I probably enjoyed this movie more than it deserved.  I was going to give it a 3.5, but I at the end I was humming the song from the finale, so I rounded up.  But watch it.  Next time I might not grade on a curve.",1083888000,,3423,4.436102236421725

It was what I expect from a Hilary Duff movie, and let me tell you, I wasn't expecting much. The movie was bad. Not terrible, but bad.
The whole movie was about a girl who goes to Rome(?) for a some school trip or something, and winds up meeting some famous Italian boy singer who's partner left him. But amazingly, Lizzie McGuire looks exactly like her, so the boy wants her to be his partner. She accepts and then has to fake her way through doing the work she should be doing for school (Naughty girl!!) to secretly meet with that guy.
I recommend these movies instead....
What A Girl Wants (Amanda Bynes) PG.....Way better!!! A great girl-power story!
Agent Cody Banks (Frankie Muniz) PG.....Not a girl story, but still awesome! Hilary Duff is in this one, but not as a main character.

1488899,5,B00005JM9Q,"The summer of 2003 will be memorable for a number of reasons, but one event will stand out in my mind.  2004 was the summer in which negotiations between Disney and Hilary Duff broke down.  The bottom line was that Hilary Duff would no longer assume the mantle of Lizzie McGuire.  The working title for this film had been, ""Ciao Lizzie!"" and we see only too late that indeed this film was our goodbye to Lizzie.  Knowing that this is our last glimpse into the life of this blossoming heroine infuses The Lizzie McGuire Movie with a certain elegiac resonance.  Watching this movie is like a final parting with an intimate childhood friend who moves away before falling out of touch.
The movie, though, is a fitting climax to an entertaining and warm show.  The movie faithfully concentrates and expands upon the major themes of the television program.  Lizzie, an awkward and klutzy middle school student, must respond to such character-defining challenges as remaining loyalty to friends and family, fulfilling responsibility to others, confronting her fears of not being accepted by her peers, and the general awkwardness of being a teenager.  Part of the charm of the movie is its sensitive portrait of Lizzie herself.  Lizzie must act decisively and conscientiously despite her self-doubt and clouded self-image.  What the film captures ever so subtly is Lizzie's quiet growth and the emergence of her inner strength.  We see her emerge from the battlefield of her adolescent war perhaps not unscathed but all the stronger for having survived.  At times she is lured astray by such her own vanity or the promise of indulging short terms aspirations such as being popular.  She does not always honor the right people and she blindly misplaces her affections at a whim.  But even so, in the end she has the courage to act upon her convictions, and despite the disingenuous designs manipulating her, her heart remains pure.
As others have noted, many of the show's central characters are conspicuously missing.  Most noticeable is the absence of Lalaine who played Lizzie's best friend, Miranda Sanchez.  The dynamic feels stilted and incomplete without Miranda to round out Gordo's neuroticisms and Lizzie's navet.  Also M.I.A. are such recurring characters as Larry Tudgeman, Veruca, Kate's cousin Amy (played by Hilary's big sister Haylie), Lanny, Claire, Parker, and David.  Even if they were minor characters, it still would have been a nice touch to see some of them touring Rome with Lizzie.
The DVD features are on the whole attention-grabbing.  Most interesting are the ""Why Not?"" music video, the behind the scenes documentary, and the deleted scenes with an alternate ending.  I love the video for ""Why Not?"" because the lyrics personify perfectly the sheer optimism and cheerfulness that were the cardinal traits of Lizzie herself.  The documentary isn't terribly insightful, but helps to flesh out what it took to make the film and how the cast and crew approached the project.  The deleted scenes are a treat, but won't really change how you interpret the movie.  The alternate ending isn't revolutionary (i.e. Lizzie's crudely drawn alter ego doesn't come to life and kill everyone) but it is fun to imagine having it in place of the actual ending.
What is perhaps most rewarding about the film is appreciating how much Lizzie has matured.  In the early episodes, she still looks very much like a little girl.  By the time she performs for a sold-out audience in the Coliseum during the film's climax, one comes to a slow realization that Lizzie is no longer a child but has become a young woman.  Though the curtains are drawn on the window into Lizzie's life and we are forced to part, we are grateful that we were privy to the formative years of this extraordinary and beloved individual, Lizzie McGuire.

Granted, if you have seen the show, you'll already know the background of the characters and have more emotional investment in them as well.
So in the movie, Lizzie, best friend Gordo, and some school friends go on a trip to Rome. Their new principal is their tour guide and while she shows them around beautiful Italy, she's also trying to whip them into shape for high school, which is really funny and one of the reasons the movie is so enjoyable to watch. Lizzie gets involved with an Italian pop singer, who wants her to pose as his ex-partner Isabella that Lizzie (coincidence?) looks exactly like.
The plot may be unrealistic and fluffy, but that's this movie's charm. It wouldn't be Lizzie McGuire if it weren't a bit cheesy, but in a good way. Hilary Duff gives a fun performance as usual and after this movie, girls will no doubt try to be exactly like her because that's the kind of star quality Hilary carries.
I recommend this movie to anyone who's looking to smile and laugh and go ""awwww"" in the end. It's the kind of movie that is perfect for curling up on the couch in your PJ's. So see this movie, whether you like Lizzie or not. Give this one a chance!",1078099200,,1312,4.359183673469388

Hilary Duff goes to Rome in this movie!!"" Oh, joy. I love shows where something really crazy but brilliant happens to a normal person, but this was out of proportion.
The Lizzie McGuire Movie is about how the infamous Hilary's character Lizzie (who seems to act the same way as all the characters she ever ever acts in anything, ever) goes off to Rome with her class to celebrate their graduation. The people in the movie seemed to act differently from in the TV series, they lack the characteristics that actually made them PEOPLE. Not to mention that her bestest fwiend in the whole wide wowld, Miranda, was missing. Which is further proof of the fact that this movie was just a publicity stunt...
But anyway, when they arrive and are touring around, she is mistaken to be an Italian pop star by the star's parter or whatever. This is when it gets absolutely rediculous. I mean, come on, how does Lizzie, who is supposedly portrayed to be an average American girl, who's makeup comes from Wal-Mart, is mistaken for an insanely rich and famous Italian pop star, who has a gazillion makeup artists waiting on her hand and foot?! I mean, come on...this isn't fantasy, it's just stupid.
The Paolo kid takes Lizzie off on his moped, and the plot goes on and on and spirals into more chaotic fluff that only all the brainwashed preteen girls around us can possibly enjoy. I also noticed that they didn't portray Italy well at all. Honestly, how does she go to Rome and everyone speaks English???? Well apparantly in Hilary's world, EVERYONE does!! It's horribly closed-minded. Not to mention Hilary seems to even lack acting skills. She seems to be reciting her lines rather than just thinking about them on the spot, and her movements seems rather constrictive and robotic. It's so sad.

He likes Lizzie a lot and Lizzie likes him too but just don't show it.  He finds Isabella and they go and find Lizzie.  Gordo also takes up for Lizzie and say that HE'S been sneaking out to have fun away from the group.
3.)  Others :  They others acted the same way as they do in the show.  Kate is still mean, until Lizzie tells her the truth and that she will be a famous singer if she stays with Palo and gets ready for the award show.  Ethan is still dumb and a klutz.  He's totally a chick magnet.  Meliena acts a whole lot different and a whole lot less bossy.  You only see her once but she is in there.  Matt is still a noisy and good for nothing brother.

The Lizzie McGuire Movie is a follow up on the hit Disney Channel Original Series Lizzie McGuire.  The movie follows main characters, Lizze McGuire (Hilary Duff), David Gordon a.k.a. Gordo (Adam Lamberg), Kate Sanders (Ashlie Brillault) and the oh so cute but dumb as a brick, Ethan Craft (Clayton Snyder) on a trip to Rome, Italy.
Upon arriving in Rome, you will receive a short history lesson and you will get a quick view of the historic monuments that are a part of Rome.  While on their first day of sightseeing Lizzie is mistaken for, a Roman pop star names Isabella (Hilary Duff).  Once she is mistaken, she meets Isabella's singing partner Paolo Valisari (Yani Gellman).  Lizzie soon falls in love with Paolo and he asks some, in my mind, crazy things of her.  Lizzie, being in love, accepts his little challenges.  In the end, Paolo does not turn out to be what he seems to be.
Hilary Duff shines in this movie with her singing, dancing and acting, of course.  I saw this movie on opening night and I could not wait for is to be available on DVD for me to purchase.  Immediately after I viewed the movie, I went to the nearest store that was happy and purchased The Lizze McGuire Movie Original Soundtrack.  I have a good feeling that if you see the movie you will not only fall in love with it but you will also feel the need to own the soundtrack as well.
All good movies have a love story; great music and a history lesson or two to offer and The Lizzie McGuire Movie has it all.  If you or someone you know likes Lizzie McGuire on the Disney Channel then this is the movie to get.  I give it two thumbs and to big toes up!",1069718400,,1882,4.3125

Okay so that's two words but honestly I can not describe how much I enjoyed this film! It has something for everybody in it; sentimentality between a mother and daughter (Lizzie and her mom), teen romance (Lizzie and Paolo), there's a lot of great music in it too sung by the fantastic Hilary Duff who shines as the star of this movie, and of course the obvious clash between siblings which we can all relate too! I have probably never been impressed with any other film as much, and having not seen Hilary Duff on anything other than a few episodes of Lizzie McGuire, I had the pleasure of experiencing such an amazing amount of talent from such a young actress. She can act, she can sing, she's beautiful and she gets the gorgeous Italian guy in the movie so basically she's everything a teenage girl could want to be, which makes her such a fantastic role model for everybody.

  Duff can't act, sing nor does she have any on-screen appeal. She is just another pop star clone created by Disney and her publicist, stamped with a ""safe for kids"" label. Don't worry parents, your 14 year-old Ritilin addicted daughters will love this waste of film due to the mindless dialog, music video styled, rapid-fire camera work and the fasion show scenes.

Paolo convinces Lizzie (Duff) to impersonate his partner to perform at an award show. She can lip-sync the lyrics he tells her. ""You will be great I know.""

Hilary Duff who is very popular among young girls who is only 15 but looks older. Serves as a role model for girls who are obsesses with makeup and hairstyles, and popularity and don't have a though in their head. The movie celebrates beauty, popularity, above all other values, and its lighthearted fantasy for young teenagers and at that level of work just like her last movie ""Agent Cody Banks."" But Duff is talented and it time for her to move on to films with a few more ideas.
They did the same think in ""What a Girl Wants"" with (Amanda Bynes) they go over to Europe and they become media sensations why not in this story just have her go to Rome and have the adventures and normal 15 year old girl might have. They pack on this Briteny Spears type of adventure for her, which is so over the top and so silly. They get rid of Paolo so she can actually do a duet with her-self and don't know how that happened but it's like she's just such a big star we can't even have the Italian singing star on screen anymore, it would be nice just to have seen her trip to Europe in reality time.

You may have your own opinions about Hilary Duff and her Lizzie character, but I personally really glad that today's kids are responding to Duff's positive influence and taking her as a role model.
For any fan of the show, this movie does not disappoint. It is very enjoyable, with some great moments and a whole lot to like regarding the development of the characters. That, to me, is one of the biggest strengths of the film: the way they managed to develop and even put a little twist on the main characters without totally making it dumb or unrealistic. Take Kate Sanders, for starters. What she does for Lizzie in the movie is definitely something she would have never done in the show, but something about it makes it believable anyway. You realize also what a precious person Gordo is in Lizzie's life, and of course by the end of the movie Lizzie makes the final cut from the shy, insecure young girl she used to be and finds her moment, her time to shine. Through that, her confidence comes barreling out, and don't be surprised if her final onstage performance in the end chokes you up a little. It is so awesome to see how much Lizzie has grown up, and regardless of whether or not you buy into the whole ordeal, you have to admit that this is a great movie for young girls. Some of Lizzie's awkward and embarrassing moments are a little over the edge--for example, how many school principles give a student as insecure as her the responsibility of delivering the graduation speech? And how many people completely fall over and cause an entire stage curtain to come tumbling down? The whole graduations scene was pretty dumb, and I think it would have helped a lot to have Lalaine (Miranda) appear in the movie, but it is still an overall great film. There's a decent plot, beautiful scenery from Rome, good acting, and a character and story that deserves what is has for its positive message.",1065139200,,2004,4.569444444444445

1489300,4,B00005JM9Q,"""The Lizzie McGuire Movie"" sees our favorite Junior High students embark on International mis-adventures.
THE STORY:
Lizzie and the gang graduate from Junior High and embark on a summer field trip to Rome with their new High School principal.  While in Rome, Lizzie hooks up with Italian pop-sensation Paolo (apparently all cute Italian boys are named Paolo, see the Olsen's ""When In Rome"" for details) and substitutes for his estranged singing-partner Isabella for whom she is a dead-ringer.  Action, adventure and romance ensue as Lizzie pursues her relationship with Paolo, lives the life of a pop star, escapes evil Principal Miss Ungermeyer, and catches all the sights of Rome.  In the midst of it all Lizzie learns some valuable life lessons courtesy of Paolo, Gordo and Kate Sanders????
THE ANALYSIS:
The movie starts off quite a bit slow but once in Rome the action begins to pick up.  Most of the cast from the series returns for the movie (with the noticeable absence of gal-pal best-bud Miranda).  Overall the charm of the series stays through for the movie.  Mind you, I'm not a regular of the series (seen a few bits of a few episodes when the Mrs. watches) but from what I've seen of the series it seems like it's pretty much like the show (animated Lizzie and all).
THE DVD SPECIAL FEATURES:
You've got a pretty stuffed DVD features section here, but unfortunately A LOT of it is Disney fluff.  Included in the DVD special features are:
1. ""Hilary's Roman Adventure""  - 12 minute behind the scenes feature where the cast and crew (mainly Hilary) discuss everything from the movie, their experiences filming it, comparisons to the TV show, their experiences touring Rome and Hilary's life on the set (still needs to go to school).
2. ""Hilary Duff Music Video - `Why Not'""
3. ""In the Recording Studio with Hilary"" - 2 minute feature where Hilary discusses her upcoming CD release.
4. ""Roamin' Volare"" - The Tour of Rome scene with Lizzie and Paolo on the moped done up music video style.
5. 3 deleted scenes with optional director intro commentary.
6. ""Sneak Peak"" Trailers:  The multi-million dollar Disney marketing machine was in full force here!!!  This stuff actually plays when the DVD first loads but Disney was nice enough to put in a navigational link to it on the menu in case you wanted to watch it AGAIN.  Disney shills the following from their extensive product line:
a. ""The Lion King Special Edition DVD""
b. ""Lizzie McGuire"" TV Volume Sets
c. ""Kim Possible"" TV series
d. ""Sleeping Beauty Special Edition DVD""
e. ""George of the Jungle 2""
f. ""That's So Raven"" TV series
THE VERDICT:
In all, if you're a fan of ""Lizzie McGuire"" you're bound to love the movie if you haven't seen it yet.  Too bad Hilary and Disney couldn't come to terms on a deal as the movie was an ideal branch from the original series set in Junior High to the new seasons they'd have set in High School.  Overall though, the movie makes a fitting end to a great series.
GRADES:
Film:  3.5 stars
Extras:  3.5 stars
Overall:  3.5 stars
Highly Recommended",1063584000,,3048,4.722641509433962

Balance her in a undoable position on the cover of her DVD, give her a miniskirt, blonde braids, and an ugly floral trunk, send her to Rome, you've got yourself a stack of money. What an excellent role model. Did someone say role model? She's like a living store display. Her first song is ""So Yesterday"" -- who came up with that title? A ten-year-old? Oh, wait. She did. It's my idea that if you can sing, you probably can't act (Madonna), and vice-versa, it's just too many talents for one person. You can badly voice what's just another ugly, cheap, meaningless, and badly-done cartoon, what a good reason to think you can have your own wannabe CD and cheesy movie!

However, all personal opinions on that subject aside I do like Hilary Duff and I think for such a young girl she has amazing talent. A lot of people say that the plot was cheesy but I think it was easy enough to understand for the younger generation and I think it fit in with Disney's genre. Anyway, the only disappointment that I had in the movie was the basic time she didn't spend with Gordo. I know that the movie is all about her but I think she should have sneaked off with him a couple of times. Indeed my very favorite part was the concert part due to the fact that I think Hilary and Isabella shine the most in that scene and the music is also VERY catchy and I enjoy listening to it over and over again.

1489387,3,B00005JM9Q,"Hilary Duff is easily the queen of the big mid-teens boom these days.  Her Disney Channel show has turned Hilary into a mega-star, and if you enjoy her clumsy yet normal antics on the tube, you'll get a kick out of her antics as she tackles Rome.
The movie picks up at Lizzie's 8th grade graduation, as she is about to enter High School (Sadly the show has stopped filming, as High School is too mature for Disney viewers?).  Lizzie and a number of other kids are going on a two-week trip to Rome to meet their new principal and get a taste of culture.  Upon arriving, Lizzie makes a shocking discovery and is (kinda) torn between a new life or her old one.  The ensemble cast is at its finest in this 95 minute flick, with great preformances by Kate, Ethan, and Gordo (her classmates) who make the movie a lot more funny.  Alex Borstein, who plays the drill sargent like principal Ungermeyer really shines and is cause for some of the biggest laughs in the flick.  The cartoon Lizzie from the shows is also prominent, and provides good narration for the flim.
The extra features on the dvd aren't anything special, and seem mainly there for the purpose of boosting Hilary's music career.  In fact, one could argue that was the purpose of the movie,as her two songs are prominent throughout the film, which itself centered on preforming and singing.  We'll see how it all turns out I suppose, but if you liked the show I'd say watch this flick.  If you've never seen the show, maybe pass up the movie, as while it is entertaining, the plot is a little repetitive.",1060992000,,1563,4.475352112676056

I got it right when Target put it out, and the soundtrack, too! Part of me wishes Kate had gone to Waterslide Wonderland- but at least she didn't! She, like, totally saved Lizzie's life when she covered for her. Um, did you want a short,short, SHORT summary? Okay. That's the summary I can do the best. Well, it goes something like this:
  After suffering complete and total humiliation at her junior high graduation, there's only one thing Lizzie McGuire wants to do- leave the country!
  Luckily, she's off on a class trip to Rome, where she meets hot Italian pop star Paolo Valisari. Lizzie's in heaven. Even better. It seems that she bears a striking resemblance to Paolo's singing partner Isabella. Lizzie starts getting star treatment-and that's when her adventures really begin!
  Is Lizzie in love? Is Paolo really as nice as he seems? And why is Gordo suddenly acting so...jealous?
  This movie stars Hilary Duff (Lizzie & Isabella), Adam Lamberg (Gordo), Yani Gellman (Paolo), Jake Thomas (Matt McGuire), Hallie Todd (Jo McGuire), Robert Carradine (Sam McGuire), Ashlie Brillault (Kate Sanders), and Alex Borstein (Mrs. Ungermeyer). It's awesome! U Gotta C It!

1489391,5,B00005JM9Q,"For me, this is one of the most heart-warming and self-discovery filled movies I have seen.  In this masterpiece of a film made from Disney's hit television show ""Lizzie McGuire"" we are all shown the true meaning of friendship and loyalty.  The adventures of Lizzie McGuire is something people of all ages can see value and entertainment in, as well as the deep feelings we all experience.
Lizzie McGuire, the star of the movie, is about to graduate from junior high.  And as usual, her life is full of things that are totally bothersome.  There's Kate, the girl at school who treats Lizzie like dirt and who always tries to make Lizzie feel inferior (in my opinion, Lizzie, you are totally superior to Kate).  Then there's Matt, Lizzie's bratty and obnoxious little brother, who's always trying to make Lizzie embarressed and get money for himself.  Just like in the series, Lizzie has three people who she can turn to for anything, her mother and father and her best friend Gordo, who is a lot like Lizzie in more ways than I can even count.  After a totally disasterous graduation ceremony, Lizzie goes on a school trip to Rome, Italy, totally excited to leave the life where she feels like she can't do anything without embarressing herself.  In Rome, she and Gordo make a promise to each other to have an adventure on this trip.  Later, Lizzie makes a wish by tossing a coin into the Trevi Fountain, and suddenly, as if it comes true, she meets the man of her dreams, Paolo, an Italian rockstar.  Lizzie soon learns that she looks identical to Paolo's singing partner, Isabella, except for the hair.  Isabella has brown hair and Lizzie has blond hair.  And what's more, all the people in Italy think that Lizzie is Isabella.  Paolo asks Lizzie to fill in for Isabella in a concert that will send his career skyward.  Lizzie is excited, but Gordo is suspicious, thinking that there is more to Paolo than meets the eye.  As Gordo uncovers some secrets of Paolo's, both Lizzie and Gordo are in for the time of their lives!
A totally appluade Hilary Duff for this movie.  If you want a movie that will be total entertainment from the whole family, this is it.  I see Lizzie as the shy, nervous, and beautiful girl who is just trying to fit in without success, but inside, I see a spirit greater than anyone else's around her and a heart of gold.  Lizzie's true nature, good heart, and willingness to help others make her a true young heroine.  And the best scene is the concert scene, where Lizzie is at her finest and most musical!  Another thing that the movie has is great music.  Lizzie McGuire fans will not be dissappointed.",1060646400,,2631,4.591006423982869
1489487,1,B00005JM9Q,"The Lizzie McGuire Movie(LMM) is a tremedously bad film. It amkes the Gidget movies look like classics. It's protagonist is Lizzie McGuire from Disney's TV series, in the film Lizzie goes to Rome for a class trip(pretty expensive class trip, but nevermind). While in Rome Lizzie meets up with a cute-ish boy, (I honestly forget his name, I thinnk it's Paolo) who wants Lizzie to be part of his act, his partner having just recently quit. The that Lizzie speaks no Italian doesn't seem to matter even tough the group is allegedly one of the hottest groups in all of Italy. Actually no one in the film speaks Italian, and the have some odd accent. Anyway Lizzie decides to take the allegdly Italian (He has an American accent people!)heartthrob up on the offer, thus ditching her group and leaving boy pal Gordo to explain her absence. After awhile we learn the the Italian-ish guy is a cad and LMM tries to teach us a lesson about friendship and loyalty or something. Oh, and the movie features nauseating and irritating carton Lizzies that echo Lizzie's thoughts. The movie also lacks charactars from the show most notably Lizzie best friend Miranda
  I saw the previews for this movie wherein Hilary Duff, who plays Lizzie assures the audience the the movie was filmed in Rome Italy, not Rome, New York. Very clever.

The Lizzie McGuire Movie was an off the bat Hit in the big screen. I don't know any Lizzie fan who didn't watch this charming movie. The only thing I didn't like about this movie was the corny line, the one where Paolo tells Lizzie she looks like something (I think the sun?).
In the beginning Lizzie says to Gordo that Miranda is on Vacation (Mexico City). But I think if they had them all...it would have been much more...whats the word...edgier. I don't know...I am only a critic.

1489493,5,B00005JM9Q,"The movie is set in Rome, Italy, where Lizzie Mcguire is mistaken for international singing sensation Izabella by Izabella's singing partenr, Paolo.  Paolo seems to be a nice guy at first, but his image changes in a quite impactful way.
  But that's not the real story for fans of the Lizzie Mcguire TV show.  The part about the movie that is the real interest is the romantic growth in the relationsip between Lizzie and best friend Eric Gordon AKA ""Gordo.""  As those who have followed the TV series diligently know, Lizzie already knows that Gordo has started to like her more than a friend, but it is in the movie where Lizzie starts to feel romantically toward Gordo.
  The movie is actually quite touching and romantic when the audience gets over the ridiculessness of Izabella.  The only dissapointing part of the movie is that the end, while trying not to spoil it, is awkard, but for those fans of romantic literature, it's dissapointing in a good way.  In short, the movie is a fantastic family film that touches the hearts of movie goers while also providing comic relief and a little bit of action and mischeif as well.  Everyone who is familiar with the TV show cannot afford to miss this wonderful cinematic presentation.",1059955200,,1234,4.724299065420561

I never, ever thought it would end like it did, which made it even better. 4 stars for how cool the movie was. (ooh, yay! Im so happy we FINALLY got a friggin DVD player- Im getting the DVD ASAP) As for the actors and actresses, it's the last star that I can budge on this rating thing. If it wasn't, I'd give it 4 stars (again). Hilary is so sweet, so charming. Some say she's a modder, or a poser. I wouldn't believe that for eternity. You know why?
  She isn't a modder or poser. She's a fifteen-going-on-sweet-sixteen girl that loves her fans and everything else good with a lovely life. Mom, dad, sis, and dogs. She sings, acts, dances, you know. Hils (&the other stars deserve what they want. Especially Hilary.
  The story is so long, more than the stupid ""maximum of 1000 words"" thingermabobber, that I can't put it down.
  Sorry, but just trust me. For y'all that either never saw it and want to, or who don't know whether or not to buy it, take my advice. It deserves five stars. If you are a fan of Lizzie or Hilary, get it ASAP- before they run out. If you have a little girl from 5-15 years old, let 'em see it. They'll love it.
  I know I did.
  And my mom.

Well, your wish came true on May 2, 2003 when Hilary (Lizzie), Adam (Gordo) and the  rest of the Lizzie McGuire  crew made a Lizzie McGuire Movie. This movie is filled with laughter and some sad parts but you should rate this movie 5 stars. I listened to Hilary Duff  one of the characters of the movie what she thought it was like filming the  movie. (Hilary): The film what we tried to do was not make it like one one long veg Lizzie McGuire episode which I think was cool. I loved that we all worked together again. I loved that we went to Rome and there was so much in it I mean we rode on vespas,there was a fashion show with crazy ridiculus outfits, there was this huge preformance peace and even though it was funny, there was a great learning experiance for Lizzie in the movie. Also there`s some sad parts where she feels like she`s lost her best friend and then she finds her best friend and you know she realizes that she had a great relationship between them there that she didn`t really know about and you know she even though she fell in love with this guy who used her he didn` really mean much to her and he really didn`t care about her. There were really good learning experiances it was funny and it was cool.(Kelli) The lizzie McGuire movie comes out o video and Dvd August 12,2003.",1058227200,,1361,4.284046692607004

The entire movie is full of laughs, especially from the INCREDIBLY rough and gruff Ms Ungermeyer. Add to that the stellar tv cast, Hilary Duff in two roles (equally adept at each), the Rome scenery the great soundtrack (Hilary can SING!), the great humour, etc etc etc.

1489651,5,B00005JM9Q,"To quote Hilary, ""I Can't Wait"" for this DVD, the extra features will make it really worth it! I wonder if they will use the same pic as the poster, or the sweet smiling Lizzie pic from the limited edition CD soundtrack. I hope it's the latter.
Here's my review of the movie:
Ok, I am not a Disney Channel fan, other than the occasional Mickey Mouse reruns, I never even tune in to that channel. I'm a Mickey fan. However I am aware of ""Lizzie"" through posters and other propagandas that they sell in stores over here. They also have a lot of teenybopper mags with Hilary on the cover (ok, I don't read the mags, but I notice them in stores!) Anyway, I haven't even seen an episode of the show when I saw a trailer of this movie, and I thought that the storyline is strange, because I thought Lizzie was just a little kid, and now she's hanging out with a stranger and singing on stage. I thought nothing of the preview, except for the fact that I noticed that Lizzie's not that little girl in the posters and ads anymore, she's growing into a lovely young lady with a precious, dazzling killer  smile.
I saw a couple episodes of the show before the movie premiered, and I thought the show was okay...and I can't believe I actually chose to watch this movie first before XMEN 2. There must've been like 10 people in the theatre, since this is the first show and school isn't out yet for the little kids.
I liked the first few scenes where the family is involved, because it is similar to the show. The brother is funny and I think the kid is a real talent. Once they got to Rome, it felt different, it felt kind of strange or something. And of course, Miranda is missing. It got nastier when the Paolo guy stepped into the picture, that guy can't do accents and I dunno if he can really act or not. I also didn't like the fact that everyday girl Lizzie became a famous performer in like, 4 days or so. I mean come on, I know it's Disney and stuff, but still.
The movie drags in the later stages when they hang out and rehearse and try different outfits. That never really did anything to the plot, so I decided to just forget the plot and focus on Lizzie/Hilary instead. The lady can act, and she's so cute and adorable.
In the end they showed this performance in the music awards, and although the song was kinda corny, I didn't mind Hilary's singing though, I think she's great. The ending was ok, the kiss could've been longer, but this is Disney. I just didn't like the flow of this movie. Kids and Lizzie fans will definitely like it. I'd rather watch an ep than the movie though. My favorite scene has got to be the first one where Lizzie sings ""The Tide Is High"" and she looks cute in it.
Hilary can smile for me anytime, and that is the film's saving grace. What a sweetie!",1056240000,,2781,4.257088846880907

You see I have been waiting for Gordo and Lizzie to get closer I have seen every episode where they hug and just be friends who look out for each other. The only thing that bugs me is the fact that the animated Lizzie popped up a whole lot during the movie. Igonoring that flaw through the film was a piece of cake cause the rest of the movie was spelind. If you have to ask me the plot was short and sweet it also helps you discover that there is a friend out there that really cares for you. As you can see Hilary Duff can act,dance and the best talent of hers is singing! I thought ""Dreams Are Made Of""  was the best song in the movie. Krystle (Sister) loved the Atomic Kitten song ""Tide Is High (Get The Feeling). So a cute plot, terrific music, and the most greatest cast in the whole wide world. What more could Lizzie Mcguire fans ask for? Nothing, I am going to write a sequel where Lizzie takes another trip to Canada (I'll explain later) so this review coming from a 13- year - old Lizzie Mcguire fan and Hilary Duff lover I say it was a truly awesome film. Infact before it comes out on video I plan to see it again on the big screen then wait for it's DVD release in a couple of months.

1489791,4,B00005JM9Q,"Hillary Duff is going to be a big star and she is already on the bright road to a great future. Not only does she look cute, but she can act and sing to. Oh yeah, and she seems incredibly humble and sweet despite all of her success.
Her Disney Channel series ""Lizzie McGuire"" makes its way to the big-screen in a finale movie that will certainly sit well with young girls. It's just a 90-minute episode of the popular television show, with some extra money in the budget to shoot on location in Rome. But we can be grateful that it is a nice, wholeome story created for an age group usually neglected by Hollywood.
Duff has a warm, sweet presence and the use of a little animated Lizzie to comment on the action adds a liveliness to her adventures. She is a proficient comedic actress, and clearly doesn't find `Lizzie' much of a stretch. The film mainly serves as the aforementioned goodbye to the show, and another chance to plug Duff as a pop singer, which she is aggressively pursuing in real life. Now that her show is over, it will be interesting to see what Duff tackles next. Hopefully something more dramatic.

Jim Fall was an odd choice to direct. His only other film is the highly bawdy, R rated gay film ""Trick,"" but he does a pretty decent job here, wonderfully capturing Duff's charming on-screen persona. Beautiful shots of Rome add to the atmosphere and the lively soundtrack adds to the fun.

The film is a delightful, sugary treat from start to finish. If it isn't exactly high art, but a fun teen-girl romp that traffics in cute boys, hip outfits, and loads of cheesy (but fun) pop music. Throw in some light morals about friendship, fame, and trust, along with adorable teen crushes, and there's something to recommend for fun family viewing.",1052870400,5,1762,4.555205047318612

It's just pure fun with beautiful Rome as a backdrop. Ms. Hilary Duff is the big problem with the movie. She seems not to be able to act with another person without seeming like she is on a different planet and not all there. The supportive cast provides the laughs. Alex Borstein is great and provided funny antidotes. The Italian characters are played by Americans and seem to be the to provide comic relief as bumbling fools. They even pronounce Italian words wrong. Paolo always pronounces Franca as Franka. Also the color of the film is different the TV show (as many TV to movies are) It is first annoying but you finally get used to it.

It stars Hilary Duff as Lizzie, and she goes on a field trip to Rome.  While in Rome, she is spotted by an Italian pop star who thinks she should join him in his performance at an awards show.  How realistic is that? Yeah, this movie was horrible.

1489798,5,B00005JM9Q,"The Lizzie McGuire Movie picks up where the Hit Disney Channel Original TV Series left off. Hilary Duff is back as Lizzie, a gorgeous and good hearted, but totally insecure teenage girl, preparing to leave Jr. High and move on to bigger and better things. The movie focuses on a very special graduation trip that Lizzie and some of her classmates take that summer, to Rome, Italy. Hoping this will be her chance to find adventure instead of bad luck for a change, Lizzie and her best friend Gordo vow to take chances and have fun, and forget about the embarrassing social order of school and home. Once in Rome, Lizzie's friend-turned-enemy, Kate, mopes about being ignored by the Italian boys, meanwhile, Lizzie's old crush Ethan scopes the chicks, and Gordo repeatedly catches himself scoping Lizzie. But Lizzie is entranced by an Italian pop-star she's just met, Paolo, who's amazed at the likeness Lizzie shares with his former singing partner, the dark-haired beauty Isabella. Paolo begs Lizzie to perform on stage with him at a major awards show in the guise of the vacationing Isabella, and, remembering her vow to have an adventure, Lizzie agrees to go through with it. Time passes as Lizzie is being prepped for the fraud, and as it does, she finds herself growing closer to Paolo and discovering assertive qualities she didn't know she had. But as Paolo's scheme is rising to fruition, Gordo is having a heck of a time keeping Lizzie's adventures secret from the group of American travelers and their vicious chaperone/tour guide. Back home, Lizzie's little brother Matt, under the evil influence of his friend Melina, is working on another plan to ruin his sister's reputation, this time requiring himself and his parents to travel to Rome as well. When the day of Lizzie's big performance finally arrives, so does Lizzie's family, not to mention the mysterious pop-star Isabella! It's anybody's guess how the big show will turn out, not to mention who will get the girls in the end!
 The Lizzie McGuire Movie was a wonderful surprise, even for this loyal Hilary lover and long-time fan of the series. From the super cute and perfect opening scene, to the fan and crowd pleasing feel-good ending, this was a perfect movie for such a great hit TV show. I must admit, it WAS pretty weird to see all the Lizzie McGuire characters on the big screen, but it was very cool once I got used to it. The graduation scene bothered me a bit, because they felt they had to give an explanation for every major character, making statements the TV show fans already knew, like how Kate used to be Lizzie's best friend until she became popular, etc..., but that was the only thing in the whole movie that bugged me. It wouldn't even have been that bad, if not for the way they did it, rushing from one character to another like, ""we need to get these character explanations out of the way,"" mentioning how Lizzie's other best friend, Miranda, was away in Mexico and things like that. But like I said, that was the only part that bugged me in an otherwise incredibly great movie! As a long-time fan of the show, a couple of parts nearly made me cry, though I'm sure sometimes it was just the result of seeing my dreamgirl, Hilary Duff, up there looking incredible and doing the best acting I've ever seen her do! The part where she gets on stage and does her thing, I was really getting choked up, because after coming to know the character the way we have from the TV series, it was amazing to see the things Lizzie was doing in this movie as she finally found her confidence! I should also say that Hilary has really improved as a singer, actress, and in everything else she does! She even did a great job as Isabella, the Italian pop-star! There were only a couple of times where she lost the accent a bit. But every girl should be able to look that good with both blonde AND brown hair! Ha. I wonder how Hilary would look as a redhead? I can't say enough good things about this movie! I just can't wait till it comes out on DVD. My eyes are even a little teary right now.

As you can tell from the trailors & commercial, Lizzie and her friend Gordo go to Rome, Italy on a school trip.  Lizzie meets and falls ""in love"" with an italian pop singer who says she bares an uncanny resemblence to his now ex-singing partner, except that the hair color is different.  Lizzie sneaks off from her ""school"" group to meet the pop star (Paulo) and they make several day trips throughout Rome, while Paulo convinces Lizzie to pretend she is Isabella his ex-singing partner.  Lizzie agrees and her world changes.  She get's to do things that young girls dream about.  While Lizzie does all the sneaking around, Gordo, her best friend, helps cover for her so the escort doesn't know what's going on.
What happens at the end of the movie is funny and not what you expect.  However, I can't tell you what exactly happens so you'll just have to see the movie for yourself.  You'll enjoy it!",1052092800,2,1134,4.461165048543689
1489908,3,B00005JM9Q,"I saw the movie two days after it came out, and the theater was packed.. As I was walking out, I overheard two woman saying that it was a really dumb and very terribly made movie. I can't say I don't agree with them, but I can't say I do. The movie is about.. you know what, just watch the preview. While I was watching the movie, I was waiting and waiting for something to happen, something exciting, something fun to watch, but it never came. The only part I liked was probably the part everyone likes -- the part where.. sorry can't tell you, you have to see it for yourself. This movie is the type of movie that you see it and that's it, you don't have to see it again.
Well, I hope that you like it (if your 9-13 (the tween ages))!",1052092800,,736,4.0479452054794525
1489909,3,B00005JM9Q,"Call me a wet blanket but I think this movie is BAD for young girls. Hilary Duff is one of the most beautiful teenagers I have ever seen with absolutely no awkwardness whatsoever. (Making her fall in every scene in the movie and putting her in tomboy clothes doesn't make her awkward). This movie sends the wrong message because ""Lizzie"" is getting by on her beauty and her ""cuteness"". She meets a guy who is so overcome by her beauty he falls in love with her, offers her a ride on his moped and a chance to sing with him, posing as another girl who turns out to be- her sister??
Critics will say ""but young girls love her"" ""this movie made money"" ""this is every girl's dream"". Sure it is. But in REAL LIFE dreams are achieved by ambition, intelligence, wisdom and confidence NOT beauty and cuteness. Wouldn't it be refreshing, inspiring and more realistic if this ""Lizzie"" got offered a moped ride, a chance to sing and a boy for the qualities I mentioned, not the qualities emphasized in this movie?
Why can't they do this for girls? Seems to me they don't think the average girl has the capability (or the looks) to accomplish such dreams.",1052092800,3,1143,4.473684210526316
1489910,4,B00005JM9Q,"My two nieces are nuts about Lizzie Mc Guire so I was anxious to see the movie and know what the fuss was all about.

Lizzie Mc Guire (Hilary Duff) is your common teenager - shy, afraid of singing for her parents at home, image conscious, and a little brother who tries to get her most embarassing moments on videotape for blackmail.

When the class president is unable to make the speech at her junior high school graduation, and the VP is MIA, Mc Guire (class treasurer) is chosen for the task a few minutes before the ceremony begins.  She stutters throughout the speech, says the president would have wanted her to get a drink of water, trips over the stage curtain, and the whole thing winds up on ""Good Morning America.""

Lizzie goes on a trip to Rome with her classmates (and trying to forget her foul up and make a ""fresh start"" didn't hurt) and meets up with charismatic Paolo (Yani Gellman).  People mistake her for Paolo's singing partner, Isabella (who looks like Lizzie with black hair).  He tells Lizzie that Isabella doesn't want anything to do with the duo anymore and how she will have to make an appearance on the Italian Video Music Awards and act as Isabella so he is not sued by his record company.

The only gripe I have was some unfavorable depictions of Italians in the movie (there's more to the language than ""Si"") but there is justice done in the beautiful depictions of La Citta Eterna - Roma.

The ending wasn't at all what I had expected, coming out of virtually nowhere (which is great.  If you know what's going to happen, why bother seeing the movie?).  Hilary Duff is cute and her character is simply adorable.

I don't want to ruin the ending but take your children to see it.  It's definitely worth it.",1052092800,2,1738,4.5
1489911,4,B00005JM9Q,"Being a fan of Lizzie Mcguire (the tv show), of course I had to see the movie, i even got out of school early to do so. I thought the movie was great, but I expected a little more, I don't know exactly what...but something. I think Hilary Duff made this movie and honestly if she weren't in this movie, I don't think I would have liked it that much. Go see it though, it's worth your money. Maybe it's not as good as Holes, but it's definately better than What A Girl Wants.",1052006400,,474,4.053191489361702
1489912,5,B00005JM9Q,"Well lets see... Before I saw Holes and saw how good Disney had made it I though "" Wow Disney is going to ruin Lizzie McGuire and Hilary's career"" But after Holes I saw they could do SOME things correctly so I checked it out. It was good. It was excellent family entertainment while teens won't mind seeing it because of Hilary! I would know. It wasn't really funny but threw in a few things that made me chuckle. They really did a good job transforming what was a sitcom of a teen in school to and adventure. The only obvious thing was that Disney made sure that Hilary's singning career was advertised out in the open, playing two parts that sing in the movie. But this doesn't interfere as she is a good singer and is part of the over all scheme of things. I wouldn't mind picking up the album. I thought it was done well and made a pretty good transition to the big screen. The only people who would raise an eyebrow at this movie probably has't seen the TV show TWO THUMBS UP go ahead and give this a try. It's charm will just rub off on you and keep you smiling!",1052006400,,1068,4.164251207729468
