I am always drawn to fantasy but fantasy is not easily obtained for me this was a very little distraction and no I don't want it to be hard core . No - now that I have seen this movie I wouldn't purchase it again.",1447200000,,251,3.7547169811320753

766770,4,6303953921,"Another good movie from Surrender Cinema with plenty of naked eye candy.  Like most Surrender Cinema videos, the women are beautiful.  But, also like most of these movies the story is just ok.  Of course no one is watching this movie for the storyline.  Taylor St. Claire plays a business owner/ housewife who is very sexually shy.  Her assistant buys her a visit to a virtual reality sex spa.  At first she is very hesitant to try it out due to her shyness.
The encounters start very mild as she is watching another couple.  They progress with each session involving her more and more.  They range from girl/girl, bondage, one where she is placed in the guys body so she can understand how the man feels.  Definitely some erotic scenes in there.  At the end of it all, she is very sexually liberated and ready to please her man",1375401600,2,828,4.496644295302014

766772,5,6303953921,"I have a few Surrender Cinema dvds but this one is my personal fav. The acting is decent and the story (well, the plot doesn't require much story.) A timid housewife needs a sexual awakening and she gets one after visiting a cyberspace dayspa a couple of times. She's very good looking and ample bodied. In many of her Encounters she is someone else. Everyone is hot though. Even the fake tits don't look freakishly fake (well, two do.) It's an interesting concept for a softcore tit flick and each scenario has a sexy charm of it's own. It's a one of a kind that I've recomended to friends.",1361577600,4,591,4.431192660550459
766773,3,6303953921,"gotta be honest:  Elizabeth Kaitan is the reason I rented this.  The plot has something to do with an executive (played by Kaitan) who has something of a cold personality.  Her boyfriend buys her a membership into a ""virtual reality"" service, where she can get in touch with her sensual side.

it's not Shakespeare, but this is good for relaxing weekend viewing.  Kaitan brings energy and enthusiasm to the role.",1283126400,,412,4.828571428571428
766774,5,6303953921,"My wife and I really enjoy this movie.  The performers are hot and the scenes are erotic, and not too short.  Some movies have sex scenes that are a minute or 2 long, and just as you're getting into the scene, it ends.  Not this movie.  The massage scene between the asian and white girls is so erotic!  The threesome scene is hot too.  Those are our favorites.",1249516800,,361,4.235294117647059
766775,1,6303953921,"While nobody expects a skin flick to have a plot or emmy award winning acting, this movie failed to meet my already low expectations.

I had 2 issues with this movie.
1. The music: the sound track is more fitting for an info-mercial than for an erotic movie. I think I heard the same music in the ad for the DR Field and Brush mower.
2. The acting...I expected the in-between acting to be bad- everyone does.  But the acting when they're pretending to have sex was simply sub-par.  They didn't look as they were even trying to be convincing. Maybe I'm just a hard critic, or maybe these people are simply not good at sex.  Find a different title if you're looking for anything halfway decent.",1197244800,,692,4.425196850393701
766776,5,6303953921,"""Virtual Encounters"" is one of the better erotic soft-core DVDs I've seen. There are lots of crummy ones out there, but this one does NOT disappoint. True, there's not a lot of story to it beyond a girl getting caught up in erotic virtual reality scenes, but since most of the DVD consists of those scenes, how much story could you have? You've gotta make your choice. If I counted correctly, there are 8 boy-girl scenes, 2 girl-girl, and 1 boy-girl-girl. Anyone who complains about the actors in this must live at the Playboy Mansion, because to me they all look great and are very sexy. Two of my favorite scenes are with the bodacious Taylor St. Claire, one with her as a sizzling stripper who brings a guy from the audience onto the stage with her, and in the other, she's dominating another woman in a dungeon in a manner too hot to describe here. Other big name contributors are Jacqueline Lovell and Jill Kelly. Overall, the disc gets pretty close to x-rated, and to avoid that a few parts of scenes are done in a rather fake looking manner. For example, there's full frontal nudity of the women, but they had to compromise realism a little in order not to show men's privates and to avoid an x-rating. Other than that, they sure don't hold back much. The disc also has a nice extra with previews of 4 other Surrender Cinema DVDs. Overall, ""Virtual Encounters"" is very impressively acted and filmed, and there are quite many really HOT scenes in here. Especially at the very moderate price, this one is a winner!",1146700800,36,1519,4.547445255474453
766777,2,6303953921,"All the promos made me think that this would be a really great Sci-Fi story with beautiful babes all over the place.  Well, there WERE some beautiful babes but the anticipated provocative poses by sexy ladies, never materialized.  Has the art of ""posing"" been lost by modern girls?  Maybe all the good directors have retired or died!  What a pity...Why, I couldn't even muster a stiff upper lip as I played this DVD through to the end.

In spite of my being a certifiable ""dirty old man"". [:-)",1126051200,7,493,4.556818181818182
766778,5,6303953921,"It is becoming pretty clear to me that Surrender Cinema is ahead of the game compared to other purveyors of erotic (all right-soft porn) movies.  Virtual Encounters is an impressive effort.  The look and sound of the movie are excellent, way beyond that of your typical naughty movie.  The plot holds together, the acting is pretty good overall, and the players in the arena are generally pretty attractive.  Amy (Elizabeth Kaitan) is a take-control kind of woman who is apparently somewhat reluctant to shift into intimacy overdrive with her boyfriend.  He kindly gives her a deluxe pass to Virtual Encounters for her birthday.  There she meets the disembodied, smooth-talking Rob, who guides her through a number of virtual reality sessions designed to help her discover her hidden desires and activate the wild gene that has been lying dormant inside her for too long.  She starts slowly, simply observing, but eventually she becomes a participant in the sexual escapades revealed to her, taking on a number of different forms (including that of a man) in the course of the experience.  The plot works pretty well because the moviemakers don't spend a whole lot of time worrying about it, preferring to simply jump from one virtual reality session to another fairly quickly.  Things start slowing down a little bit midway through the film, but the last few scenes pick up the pace significantly.  It goes without saying that Virtual Encounters is definitely for adults only.  This is the kind of movie that will make an erotic movie fan out of anyone who sees it; basically, there's something here for just about everyone.",1046476800,37,1625,4.981481481481482
766779,3,6303953921,"As my second Surrender Cinema flick I was looking forward to seeing Virtual Encounters. Not only do I love Elizabeth Cayton (Slave Girls From Beyond Infinity) but I had just seen The Exotic House Of Wax by Surrender  Cinema, and aside from it being an outright soft core porno, it had an  interesting storyline between the sex as well.
Not so with Virtual  Encounters. While it was nice to see the expected sex scenes aplenty in  this movie, there was no story whatsoever.
Kaitan hooks herself up to the  Virtual Reality machine and it shows her all types of sexual pleasures.  They try and develop Kaitan's character as a shy woman who isn't  comfortable with her sexuality. As a result, her relationship is suffering.  Her boyfriend gives her the gift of Virtual Reality and she loves it.
A  so-so movie I would watch the Exotic House Of Wax instead.",947721600,,852,4.6644295302013425
7859911,5,6303953921,"Surrender Cinema makes wonderful Soft Core Movies.  Each Soft Core scene is sexy, sensual, passionate, and stimulating.  Each soft core star has a distinct face and figure. Though some do look like Hard Core Actresses others appear to have natural beauty.

The Story involves a young woman named Amy.  She was involved with a great guy, but couldn't sleep with him.  She couldn't let go of her need to be in control nor could she admit how repressed her sexuality was.  Also she didn't realize she also had latent bisexual tendencies

That changes when she receives a full package to Virtual Encounters - a VR training program.  Completely life like experiences - full sensory experience.  She starts with voyeur programs.  Then moves on to interactive programs.  In each program she takes a different form.  She gains the skill and experience from each form.  She learns to dominate and to be dominated.  She learns to give in to uncontrolled passion.  She has lesbian and threesome programs.  She learns of the most primal sexuality and to understand male sexuality.

By the end her sexual awakening was complete.  She was ready to turn fantasy into reality, she was eager for the real thing.",1505433600,,1194,4.885
