8409045,3,B003YDORRM,"The image is ok, but the sound quality is terrible, and most of the dialogue is impossible to understand.
The distributor should put English subtitles on, if they can't clean up the soundtrack. That way it would be easier to follow....
Too bad.",1455667200,,244,4.6976744186046515
8409046,3,B003YDORRM,"Although the poor sound certainly leaves much to be desired, this remains an interesting movie capturing a specific period during the years immediately following WWII. I saw ""Four in a Jeep"" many years ago on TV. I was fascinated by the images of Vienna and the living conditions of its citizens. At the time I first viewed this movie I knew that Berlin was partitioned into four zones after the war, but had no idea that Vienna experienced the same situation. Too bad this remarkable period piece was not restored. Both the picture and sound desperately require substantial repair. I guess they only commit the funds for restoration for more well-known films.  To watch this in its present condition is difficult at best. English subtitles for the entire movie would have helped. I recommend you pass on this until a better version is released if ever. Peace.",1359072000,,860,4.850340136054422
8409047,1,B003YDORRM,"Picture quality of this VCI DVD is okay, what I have seen of it, but unfortunately I have never been able to complete watching it on the three occasions I have tried, due to the atrocious sound quality. A different DVD player was used each time I tried watching it, so it is not the equipment I was playing it on. Other reviewers do not seem to have had this problem, so maybe I just got a dud DVD - just my luck. In any event, this is the worst quality VCI DVD I have ever purchased. What I have been able to watch of the film is interesting - maybe one day I will get to watch the rest somehow.",1356048000,2,596,3.9338842975206614
8409048,5,B003YDORRM,My father in law heard of the book and was wondering if there was anyway he could get the dvd. I told him I could probably find it on Amazon and sure enough there it was. I know he really enjoyed the dvd because he served in this area during the war.,1327708800,,250,3.826923076923077
8409049,4,B003YDORRM,"There are moments watching this film that you are tempted to give up in frustration. The film, you see, is a highly polished piece of cinema, with a story that pulls you in, and a fine cast, but the sound track in places is barely audible. The picture, too, shows its age. But you persist and, in the end, the rewards of the filming-making overcome the shortcomings of this particular release.

Be aware also that the joint Swiss-American production has a lot of non-English dialogue, which is not very well subtitled.

I agree with the other reviewers who admire the location shooting in Vienna and make favourable comparisons with The Third Man. In some ways, this film is a superior document of those times; the scenes at the railway station where families are greeting returning ex-POWs are very powerful. Viveca Lindfors, who plays the faithful wife waiting for her husband to be released, gives a convincing and nuanced performance in a role that binds the documentary and dramatic elements of the film.

The DVD contains, as an extra, a propaganda film made in 1945 for US servicemen stationed in occupied Germany, explaining why they must never trust Germans. It is an interesting document of its time, although the transfer is awful (jerky images).",1307664000,,1257,4.892018779342723
8409050,5,B003YDORRM,"United Artists presents ""FOUR IN A JEEP"" [Un-Cut European Version] (30 March 1951) (99 min/B&W (Dolby digitally remastered) --- Powerful story, just as it happened in post-war Vienna, occupied by four sergeants representing each of the four occupying nations [England, France, Soviet Union and United States] --- Each rides patrol in the same Jeep --- But there is some unrest, they are given an order to capture and arrest a prisoner who has run away from a Soviet war prisoner camp --- Ralph Meeker decides to help Karl and his wife Franziska when the truth is uncovered --- The Soviet superiors have the sergeant on a short leash, this becomes a drama within itself  --- The actress Viveca Lindfors who plays Franziska is outstanding in every scene, steals the film and her performance is touching,-- This is actor's Ralph Meeker's very first appearance --- The film captures every morsel of the tension between the four powers as well as the desperation of the Viennese, trying to get on with their lives and serve four masters at the same time --- Highly recommend to all the ""Free People of the World"".

8409051,4,B003YDORRM,"While most of us remember the separation of post-war Berlin into ""four zones"" controlled by the Allied powers, let us recall that Vienna suffered the same fate.  Film buffs who have seen Orson Welles' ""The Third Man"" know this.  A less well known film carefully depicting the world of post-war Vienna is this little known picture of devastated Europe.  An Austrian prisoner-of-war has escaped from the Russian Zone and is desperately trying to burst out of the communist section to make it safe to freedom  (or) his lovely wife. She enlists the aid of a sympathetic man of the American Military Police.  Is he trying to help or is he more interested in the woman for himself? On the trail of the escaped man is the Russian counterpart of the American MP,  a military officer named Voroshenko.  The exchanges between the four patrols of the occupying powers (English French, Russian, & American) is the heart of the film.  This is a world with no heroes - no villains - each man morally divided as the city is physically divided.

What makes this movie memorable is the fantastic location shooting and the beautiful allure of Swedish actress Viveca Lindfors.",1289347200,7,1157,4.803030303030303
8409052,5,B003YDORRM,"I like this movie and have been waiting for it to be released for a long time. For those who remember the aftermath of WW2 and the Cold War this is a step back to those times when the 4 Powers governed Germany and Austria. The military police jeep patrols that prowled the city streets were comprised of an American, a Russian, a Frenchman, and an Englishman....one each of the 4 powers.
This is the story of one of those jeep patrols and the refugees that want to escape to the West and out of the Russian Zone.
Not an Academy Award winner, however it is an important piece of history back when the Russians tried to rule Europe and the West tried to prevent it.",1281052800,10,663,4.26984126984127
