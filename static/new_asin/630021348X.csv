235106,5,630021348X,"This is another top episode of the original series.  In this episode viewers find out that Spock's half human and half Vulcan.  Spocks father is Sarek (Mark Lenard) and mother is Jane Wyatt, the twist is that Sarek is Vulcan's ambassador to the Federation and has not accepted the fact that Spock chose to join the Federation instead of the Vulcan Science Academy.  A bit of a strained situation follows.
The Enterprise is headed to Babel with a bunch of different ambassadors and Sarek has a tense situation with another ambassador over federation membership. This lead to Sarek's nemisis's murder.  But is Sarek the culprit?  Plus Sarek has a heart condition which makes him gravely ill?  Will Spock help his father or will he remain loyal to Captain Kirk who is also injured by an unknown assassin.
The answers to these will leave the viewer impressed with the plot and as stated before this is one of Star Trek's finest episodes.  Plus the music when Sarek and Amanda (Spocks mother) first arrive on the Enterprise is classic!
Highly recommended!",999734400,2,1050,4.832402234636872
235107,5,630021348X,"Two excellent pieces of Star Trek lore, lost in the ""official"" history of Star Trek.
Captain Kirk, Mr. Spock, and the entire classic cast live on in these episodes.  I wasn't even around when these episodes were produced for NBC in 1973-1974, but managed to catch the series in reruns.  Some of these stories were so good, they could have been produced as live action episodes.  But unfortunately, they suffered from the fact that they were meant to be kiddie fare.  I recommend purchasing these eleven volumes for your Star Trek collection.",972259200,4,541,4.8478260869565215

235111,4,630021348X,"The U.S.S. Enterprise is appointed to transport ambassadors from many worlds to  the Babel Conferences. Among those aboard are Ambassador Sarek of Vulcan and  his human wife, Amanda... Spock's parents.  Keeping peace  aboard his ship is complicated for Kirk by an unidentified vessel  following the U.S.S. Enterprise and high tensions running among delegates  on  board. At a cocktail party, Ambassador Gav, a Tellarite, quarrels  openly with Sarek  about the admission of Coridan into the Federation. When  Gav is later murdered,  circumstantial evidence points to Sarek. The strain  of such an accusation causes  Sarek's already existing heart condition to  worsen and he has the Vulcan equivalent  of a heart attack. McCoy battles  with less familiar Vulcan physiology to try and  correct the damage. Spock  is needed as a blood donor for the operation.  When Kirk is attacked by  Thelev, an Andorian, Spock assumes command of the  U.S.S. Enterprise, and  refuses to participate in McCoy's operation on his father. The  Vulcan  insists that they identify and stop the vessel that is following them. Kirk  fakes  recovery and returns to the bridge, freeing Spock to go to the  sickbay and assist in  his father's surgery. On the bridge, Kirk must deal  with the unknown ship, now in  contact with someone on board the U.S.S.  Enterprise. A search uncovers the fact  that Thelev is not Andorian, but a  surgically altered Orion, put on board to disrupt the  Babel Conference.  The unknown ship attacks the U.S.S. Enterprise and is defeated. Rather than  be  captured, it destroys itself and Thelev commits suicide. With Spock  available for the  blood transfusion, Sarek's operation is a success and he  recovers. Father and son  make peace, realizing they have a common bond  that transcends their differences.  Kirk returns to sickbay for treatment  of the knife wound caused by Thelev and McCoy  gets the last word.",940291200,4,1919,5.147540983606557

235398,5,630021348X,"I will warn you now that I am a semi-Treky.  I love to watch Star Trek although I have never gone to a convention.  That is why I consider myself a semi-Treky.  Anyway, this DVD has 4 great episodes of the original Star Trek.  They are: The City On The Edge Of Forever, The Trouble With Tribbles, Balance Of Terror and Amok Time.
The City On The Edge Of Forever is when Spock and Kirk go back in time to the 1930's and of-course Kirk finds a hot girl.
The Trouble With Tribbles is when Uhura buys a Tribble (cute fuzzy hunk of lint) and brings it on board the ship.  Fun things happen after that!
Balance Of Terror is my personal favorite out of the four.  It is when the Romulans decide to tryout a new supper weapon on the Federations outposts (outposts don't seem to enjoy it) and it is up to the Enterprise and Kirk to stop them before they get away!  Cool side note is the Romulan Capt. looks a lot like Spock's Dad?
Amok Time is when Spock has to go back to Vulcan to get ""lucky"" or he will die.  Of course the Vulcan girl sees Kirk and well you will just have to watch for yourself...",1366243200,,1091,4.089201877934272

235506,4,630021348X,"This budget DVD from 2009 has four solid episodes of the original Star Trek(1966-1969).

The City on the Edge of Forever: Kirk and Spock use a portal to travel to the year 1930 on Earth. They must stop a crazy Doctor McCoy from altering human history. Joan Collins played Edith Keeler. She's an empathic, educated social worker who helps poor people during The Great Depression.

The Trouble With Tribbles: The crew of the USS Enterprise deal with benign animals known as Tribbles and Klingon spies. This is definitely one of the most lighthearted of the Star Trek episodes. The animated Star Trek episode 'More Tribbles, More Troubles' picks up where this episode left off. Footage from The Trouble With Tribbles was used Forrest Gump-style on an episode of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine(1993-1999). We get to see Captain Sisko talk to Captain Kirk and Chief O' Brien fight with Klingons! The episode tried to give a rational explanation for the Klingon's change in superficial appearance.

Balance of Terror: The USS Enterprise must keep a Romulan ship from getting into Federation Space after it destroys a human outpost. There's a lot of Cold War satire in this episode. Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan(1982) borrows a few ideas from this episode.

Amok Time: Spock's emotions go wild and the USS Enterprise must drop him off on Vulcan. Spock's betrothed wife forces Captain Kirk to fight Spock! The music from this episode was used as ""the national anthem"" on an episode of Futurama where Dr. Zoidberg is forced to fight Fry! This Star Trek episode was spoofed in The Cable Guy(1996).

The video and audio on all four episodes has been restored. The special effects shots that were too cheesy are enhanced with glossy CGI. This DVD has three video spots as extras and a dedication to the late Majel Barrett. She played a lot of different characters on Star Trek(Number One, Nurse Chapel, the Computer Voice, and others). This DVD gives you the best of the original Star Trek.",1310515200,3,1977,4.820058997050148

235662,5,630021348X,"This is a great way for anyone who owns the original broadcast shows as a set.  CBS/Paramount assembled some really good episodes in the remastered versions.  Why bother?  Well, let me tell you.  The remastered versions are incredibly well done.  They include added exterior space shots, plus the Enterprise looks slightly darker in color - making it look more like the color of the ship on Next Generation. PLUS---and this is amazing - the artists who did all the painstaking work on this--did an excellent job adding new shots - like in ""Amok Time"" - on the remastered version - we see a super wide shot of Capt Kirk, Dr. McCoy and Mr. Spock walk toward the center of the meeting place---it's AMAZING!!!  Love it.  Plus - when we see the Enterprise shoot her weapons, the weapons are more colorful, more precise and just a heckuva lot cooler.  So for anyone hesitating about buying the remastered set--- it's money well spent.  Perhaps one has to be a truly truly hard-core Star Trek fan to want the newer versions, or heck, maybe you're thinking only true fans would stick with the originals - but regardless of what you decide, this ""Best of"" DVD is a cool way to take a peek at what the remastered versions look like.

235665,4,630021348X,"With the release of the latest Star Trek film in theaters, Paramount is making sure they are releasing a good number of Star Trek related films and TV series on Blu-ray but two DVD's that would showcase both ""Star Trek"" and ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" on DVD with four episodes.

Personally, any ""Best of"" is subject for criticism by fans.  But the good news that for this series, these four episodes are on the top of the lists for various polls of ""Best of Star Trek: The Original Series"".  Granted, there could have been many episodes that could have made the cut but for these four episodes alone, you can't deny how attractive this DVD is for its price ($10 or less) and the fact that it is the enhanced remastered version (although presented in standard definition on DVD).

For me, I was excited to see ""THE CITY ON THE EDGE OF FOREVER"" included.  This is such a classic, well-written episode that I remember buying an original VHS release for this one episode alone.  The addition of ""THE TROUBLE WITH TRIBBLES"" is no surprise, as this episode is a classic for it's fuzzily cute storyline.  The other two episodes ""BALANCE OF TERROR"" and ""AMOK TIME"" are two classics but personally, I would love to have seen ""SPACE SEED"" which is the first appearance of Khan (would make sense for this film to be added since the films were released on the same day on Blu-ray) and also ""Mirror, Mirror"" or ""The Doomsday Machine"" which are really awesome episodes.

But I figured, that perhaps Paramount doesn't want to give it all away and give the viewer a reason why to pick up the series on DVD or Blu-ray.  And for those who have prevented themselves from watching the latest ""Star Trek"" film because you felt you knew nothing about ""Star Trek"", then this DVD can definitely be a primer to the working relationship and friendship between Captain Kirk, Mr. Spock and Dr. McCoy.

For those who have owned the box sets or the fan collections, personally, there is no reason for them to buy this DVD.  Unless one is a hardcore completest or want to own a ""Star Trek"" DVD with a ""Best Of"" attached to the name, then go for it.

But for those who recently watched the latest J.J. Abrams ""Star Trek"" film and are now curious about the older ""Star Trek"" series but don't want to spend for the DVD or Blu-ray set, then you really can't go wrong with ""THE BEST OF STAR TREK THE ORIGINAL SERIES"".

You get four popular episodes that are quite solid and are highly regarded episodes by Trekkers.  Personally, at $10, this release is a steal!  Definitely worth the purchase if you don't own the DVD/Blu-ray sets!",1243468800,54,2601,4.551502145922747
235666,4,630021348X,"On May 12 2009 Paramount released The Best of Star Trek: The Original Series

Though the release seems a bit rushed as there is no bonus material, and the packaging does not mention the re-mastered aspects of these classic episodes, this is Star Trek at it's original best.

Yes, one could certainly argue the choices made in picking the four episodes to include under the header of ""The Best of"", but these four episodes certainly will serve as a pleasant reminder to the Trekies/Trekkers of the world as to why they fell in love with the series in the first place, and trying to spot the new and improved footage makes watching what you seen hundreds of times, fun all over again.  For those new to the series, these four episodes serve as a nice introduction to not only the action of the series, but the lighthearted aspects as well.

The four episodes chosen include two from the first season, and two from the second, yet they don't come up on the menu in the order in which they originally aired.  First up is ""The City on the Edge of Forever"", which is generally considered by many to be the best episode of the original series.  Written by Harlan Ellison and directed by Joseph Pevney, ""The City on the Edge of Forever"" aired on April 6th, 1967, and featured a fine guest performance by Joan Collins as Edith Keeler, a social worker on earth in the 1930's.

After McCoy accidentally injects himself with a volatile drug that causes paranoia and delusions, he manages to beam himself down to the planet currently being orbited by the Enterprise, and enters a time portal that refers to itself as the Guardian of Forever.  McCoy' entrance into Earths past causes time to be changed, and the enterprise disappears from orbit stranding the landing party.  Kirk and Spock follow McCoy back in time in an effort to correct the change.

The story is well crafted and the performances are top notch, making it quite clear why this episode is so highly regarded.  The episode is certainly not without its distractions.  The heavy filter used on close-ups of Collins gets rather annoying, as does some of McCoy's make-up.  It's certainly not clear why the drug would cause his teeth to yellow.  The drug also seems to impact McCoy's physical abilities, as one who was never much of a fighter in the series, manages to effectively subdue the transporter chief with two martial arts type blows.

The second episode on the disk menu, ""The Trouble with Tribbles"" was actually the last of the four to air. Written by David Gerrold and directed by Joseph Pevney, ""The Trouble with Tribbles aired on December 29th, 1967.

In ""The Trouble with Tribbles"" The Enterprise is summoned to space station K7 where they encounter pompous politicians, Klingons, and Tribbles. The Tribbles, affectionate little hairballs that multiply at an amazing rate, eventually fill the Enterprise and the space station, but do manage to reveal a Klingon plot to sabotage the Federations colonization of a highly sought after planet.

Certainly one of the most comedic episodes in the three-year run of the series, ""The Trouble with Tribbles"" sports fine supporting performances, and displays a more competitive than combative relationship between the earthlings and the Klingons. The guest stars include classic character actor William Schallert, and William Campbell who had appeared in the first season episode; ""The Squire of Gothos"".

The Trouble of Tribbles opens with an interesting conversation being held in one of the conference rooms between Kirk, Spock, and Chekov.  Chekov display his comedic Russian loyalties as the threesome appear to be discussing some of the storyline from the first seasons episode; ""Errand of Mercy"".

The fifteenth episode of season one aired on December 15th, 1966, and was titled ""Balance of Terror"".  Written by Paul Schneider (III) and directed by Vincent McEveety, in this episode, we are introduced to the Romulans, and the history between them and the Federation.  After a long war, a neutral zone was established, and Federation outposts set up along the border. In the ""Balance of Terror"" we find that the Federation outposts are being destroyed, and the Enterprise is in pursuit of the ship causing the destruction.  The enemy ship is indeed a Romulan vessel that possesses the ability to become virtually invisible and an extremely powerful plasma weapon.

An exciting chess game ensues between Kirk and the Romulan commander portrayed by Mark Leonard who would have an extensive run in guest starring roles throughout the Star Trek entertainment franchise.  The episode also features an appearance by Lawrence Montaigne who also appears in the last of the four episodes in this collection.

We learn in ""Balance of Terror"" that the Romulans bare a strong resemblance to the Vulcans, and this fact allows for tension within the episode as paranoia strikes many members of the crew.  This is one of many times in the series that racial issues would be at the forefront of the episode themes.

One notable distraction in the ""Balance of Terror"" is the phaser fire that appears to be Photon torpedoes. This seems like something that could have been easily remedied during the re-mastering process, but it remains in its original state.
The final of the four episodes, and quite possibly the least worthy, is ""Amok Time"" which aired on September 15th, 1967 as the first episode of the second season. Written by Theodore Sturgeon and directed by Joseph Peveny, ""Amok Time"" delves deep into the Vulcan society as it deals with Spock and the Vulcan mating cycle.
With the Enterprise in route to an important diplomatic ceremony, Mr. Spock begins to display behavior extremely unusual for a Vulcan, and requests a leave on his home planet.  Kirk disobeys orders and changes course to Vulcan in hopes of saving the life of his friend.  Kirk and McCoy accompany Spock down to the planet where they attend a formal Vulcan ritual, and Kirk eventually participates.

The major distraction in ""Amok Time"" is the constant switching from actors to stuntmen in the fight scene between Kirk And Spock. For those familiar with this episode, the re-mastered additions will be interesting to see, but this episode is more appealing to those familiar with the show.  Many others could have easily replaced ""Amok Time"" in this release.  ""Amok Time"" marks the introduction of not only Walter Koenig as Chekov, but also the Vulcan salute.

Recommendation:  For those who don't own any Star Trek episodes on DVD, this is certainly a great way to start a collection, but, with complete season and series sets available, it may be the inexpensive price that will attract most fans.  For those who were introduced to the iconic series through the release of the new motion picture, this is a great way to explore the roots of Star Trek.",1243382400,9,6825,4.924956369982548

It's amazing how many times you've released the live-action episodes.  I can recall one release on beta, 3 different releases on VHS.  Two releases from Columbia House.  One on laser disc.  Then on dvd.  Then another double-dip on dvd with season sets.

And still no animated Trek.

Well guess what, Paramount?  I've had enough. You want to sit on your ass and not take my money? That's fine. I'll just head over to ebay and buy a pirate copy.  They'll get the money, and you won't.

That's good news for fans that have been waiting for this overlooked part of the Trek saga for some time. Between the original series and the first movie there was a gap of 10 years and the animated series filled in some of that time.

Although long gone (on video at least)but not forgotten, ""Star Trek-The Animated Series"" had many advantages over the original series. Since it was animated we got to see alien species that we might not otherwise have seen. Many writers from the original series returned to pen scripts. The main core members of the cast did return to do the voices. The drawbacks were few but signficant including lousy animation. The action sequences just aren't all that active and the 1/2 format didn't really allow the character development and story development of the original series.

As for reveiwing the series, I can add very little except that I remember that the soundtrack in a few episodes as being exstremely silent.  The Original series was extremely ingenious in its use of music and sound effects - not only for the oblivous sound effects but for sound effects for little things like switches and such.  In some of the amminated series episodes, the background soundtrack is noticebly quiet.  Maybe Paramount can work on the soundtracks and sound effects for the release.

As for the stories, Yes, I think that many of the stories rate as on par with the originnal series.  Especially, YESTERYEAR, which I personnally think is one of the best ever written and worth the price of getting this if it is released on DVD. It tells the tale of Mr. Spock having to go back in time to an event in his own childhood and deals with matters of childhood self esteem, emotions of being different, and the childhood emotion of love for a family pet.

Trek Animated Coming in (...):

With nothing left to release on DVD once the third season of Star Trek: the Original Series hits shelves, it was only a matter of time before certain executives at Paramount bit their lips and finally released a DVD set of Star Trek: The Animated Series.  Executive Producer Rick Berman has publicly stated a number of times that he felt an animated incarnation of Trek ""weakened"" the franchise and he has done everything possible to avoid even acknowledging the existence of the 1970's series.  Berman has blocked development of an animated Star Trek: The Next Generation for years despite a great deal of interest from both the fans and the studio.

A direct continuation of the original series, Star Trek: The Animated Series was an interesting combination of the 60's dramatic format and 70's animation.  The animated series got to do some things the original series couldn't because of the budget restrictions.  ST-TAS had budget problems of its own that resulted in a few actors having to supply the voices for various supporting and guest characters (there's a reason a lot of the aliens sounded like Uhura and Scotty).  The scripts were some of the most intelligent ever written for Saturday morning animation and used many of the original series writers, including D.C. Fontana and David Gerrold.

Star Trek: The Animated Series is schedule for DVD release on (...).  Reserve your copies now!",1104278400,8,1439,4.98326359832636
235842,5,630021348X,"It's really too band that the animated Star Trek from 1973 and '74 is so criminally overlooked. Probably because it was slated on the Saturday morning cartoon lineup, many adult fans of Star Trek probably dismissed it thinking it would be for kids, while the subject matter was likely a bit over the heads of the kids. If this was aired during prime time, the story might have been a bit different. Regardless, while I wasn't around to see the originally run of the animated series in '73-'74 (I was only one year old when it was first aired in the fall of '73), I did catch it as reruns, during Saturday morning cartoons in the early '80s, and then again on Nickelodeon at the end of the '80s/beginning of the '90s. I loved how the series ended with Hal Sutherland's signature and Lou Scheimer and Norm Prescott's name rotating in a circle (which was normal to see on any Filmation production of the time). Then I never saw the animated Star Trek again, until I got them on VHS. And the great thing about owning these series on VHS is the pleasure of seeing them without commercials!

These animated series was produced by Filmation, the same animation company that gave us Fat Albert, the Archies, He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, Ghostbusters (not to be confused with the cartoon adaptation of the 1984 movie by the same name entitled the Real Ghostbusters), and even non-animateds like Ark II.

This set includes The Pirates of Orion with The Practical Joker, which consists of two episodes from the final season, from the fall of 1974. It's a bit strange that Orion, in this case would be pronounced ""or-ee-on"", instead of ""or-eye-on"", make me wonder why it wasn't called ""The Pirates of Oreon"". This episode involves Spock contracting a fatal disease (at least to Vulcans) that require strobolin, which can only be found on a few planets, only to have a cargo ship (the Huron) carrying the strobolin be hijacked by the Orions.

The Practical Joker is the attempt to put humor on this particular episode. The Enterprise was ambushed by Romulans, then passes through an energy field to escape the Romulans only to find out this energy field causes the Enterprise to pull practical jokes. This was also the very first Star Trek episode to premiere the holodeck (they called the recreation room here), beating Star Trek: The Next Generation to it. Perhaps the most hilarious part involves Kirk's uniform, which you gotta get this tape to see for yourself! As this episode progresses, you'll find out the practical jokes started getting less funny and more dangerous.

These are two well-written and solid episodes, and I highly recommend this VHS.",1103673600,2,2656,4.767391304347826

November!!! Yes!!! Excellent!!! I would like to think that the reason for the animated series on DVD is because of our relentless pestering here and at the Star Trek website.

  One of the contributing factors was using many of the writers  as well as the actors (except Walter Koenig's Chekov who did contribute The Infinite Vulcan) from the original series. Another interesting aspect is that animation allowed for more interesteng storytelling, backdrops, and aliens that the bargin basement budget of the series wouldn't allow, including a feline crew member Lt. M'Ress, and the tri-limbed navagator, Lt. Arex.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Captain Jean-Luc Picard and the crew of the U.S.S Starship Enterprise-E become involved when the Romulan Star Empire's new leader, Praetor Shinzon, makes overtures for peace with the Federation. Surprisingly, Praetor Shinzon is not from Romulus, but from Remus, a native of the darkness-shrouded twin world of Romulus. But he is not even a normal Romulan at that. Captain Jean-Luc Picard faces a new, very personal enemy, and the Enterprise-E is tasked with preventing a costly re-ignition of war between the Empire and the Federation.
In STAR TREK X: NEMESIS, the balance has shifted and this is decisively an action-oriented type Sci-Fi film, with a misguided attempt to challenge James Bond and Star Wars on their own turf. Issues and the human element are the two things that set STAR TREK apart from other science fiction efforts and are left stranded in the background this time around. So we get multi-ship battles, a few hand-to-hand fights, lots of phasor fire, and even believe it or not, a car chase! In fact, most of the action sequences are competently done, if too short on tension, but the one-hour build-up is slightly dull. STAR TREK Sci-Fi films always take a while to get going; this one is the worst offender.

The screenplay for STAR TREK X: NEMESIS is slightly bordering on lame side. The Sci-Fi film begins with an uprising in the Romulan Senate. A human by the name of Praetor Shinzon [Tom Hardy] usurps the reins of power and pretends he wants to make peace with the Federation. The Starship U.S.S. Enterprise-E under the command of Captain Jean-Luc Picard [Patrick Stewart] is dispatched to the planet Romulus on a diplomatic mission. On board is his usual crew and the just married first officer, William T. Riker [Jonathan Frakes], and his bride, Deanna Troi [Marina Sirtis]; Dr. Beverly Crusher [Gates McFadden]; Security Officer Worf [Michael Dorn]; Chief Engineer LaForge [LeVar Burton]; and the resident android, Commander Data [Brent Spiner]. Actually, there are two androids. Before going to Romulus, the Starship U.S.S. Enterprise investigates an energy reading and discovers Commander Data's long-lost ""older brother,"" called B4 (who was created ""before"" Data).

Upon reaching Romulus, Captain Jean-Luc Picard discovers that all is not as it seems to be. The appearance of Praetor Shinzon [Tom Hardy] identity surprises the Starship U.S.S. Enterprise-E crew, and the telepathic abilities of his Viceroy [Ron Perlman] allow the Romulan Praetor Hiren [Alan Dale] to invade the mind of Counsellor Deanna Troi [Marina Sirtis]. It soon becomes clear that peace is the last thing on his mind and intends to use his seemingly invincible warship, the Scimitar, to dispatch the Starship U.S.S. Enterprise-E, and then moves onto bigger targets. Eventually, a massive space battle gets underway, and, as always, the Starship U.S.S. Enterprise-E's shields are collapsing and the warp drive is out. Where is engineer Scotty when you need him?

The returning regulars are a solid lot, even if they are largely sleepwalking through their parts. 15 years of familiarity and the TV series Star Trek: The Next Generation premiered in 1987, have allowed Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, and the rest to slip into and out of character with relative ease. Their alter-egos are like old, comfortable clothes that can be donned at any time. They may be frayed with age, but they still fit. The newcomers are less promising. Tom Hardy's Praetor Shinzon is a Khan wannabe, but Tom Hardy slightly lacks the machismo and charisma of Ricardo Montalban. The result is a hum-drum villain. Dina Meyer is wooden as the Romulan Commander Donatra. The only one who shows any energy is Ron Perlman, as the Reman Viceroy. Whoopi Goldberg, Wil Wheaton, Kate Mulgrew, and Bryan Singer, who was the director of X-Men, have cameo roles.

The special effects are definitely first-rate. Everything from the outside detail of the Romulan capitol to the ships in combat looks flawless. One might argue that nothing less could be expected from a big-budget science fiction film. But STAR TREK has not always been known for top flight visuals. This is one area, perhaps the only one, in which STAR TREK X: NEMESIS has an advantage over its predecessors.

There was a time when I would have been sad to see the STAR TREK Sci-Fi film franchise series end, but with STAR TREK X: NEMESIS, however, it has become apparent that the Sci-Fi franchise's best years are long past with this particular film. The trailers and TV spots tout this Sci-Fi film as ""a generation's final journey,"" and that may be an accurate statement. Idea-based storylines, which have always been STAR TREK's forte, no longer seems to be relevant with this particular Sci-Fi film. And mutating the series into the kind of action-oriented endeavour evidenced here is a disservice to STAR TREK and its loyal Trekkie fans. STAR TREK X: NEMESIS will not send the Starship U.S.S. Enterprise-E crew out on a high note, but at least they'll be spared the ignominy of becoming redundant, which could happen if Paramount Pictures decides to make a STAR TREK XI Sci-Fi film, which as you know is now a brand new beginning for a brand new generation of STAR TREK Trekkie fans of this Sci-Fi genre franchise and of course new screenwriters and directors help to make the new STAR TREK Sci-Fi films to go boldly where no one else has gone before.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Once again Paramount Pictures UK has made a really spectacular effort with the last of this set of the original 10 STAR TREK film franchise in bringing you this Blu-ray disc with a really stunning 1080p encoded image that gives you a viewing spectacular experience and especially the outer space special effects scenes are sharp and is a definite visual treat for your eyes, and especially with the Panavision 2.35:1 aspect ratio shows off this film in a totally spectacular visual experience The Spaceship U.S.S. Enterprise-E displays incredible detail as does the Shinzon warship Scimitar. The space battle in the Bassen Rift is suitably impressive and ranks up there with the Borg fight in the STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT Sci-Fi film.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Once again Paramount Pictures UK has made another spectacular effort with the amazing 5.1 Dolby TrueHD Surround audio experience, and is near reference quality as you are treated to loud phasor blasts and especially the exceptional genius that is Jerry Goldsmiths excellent film music score that again really enhances the film. Everything hits you with a bang during the space battle scenes and especially giving your surround speakers a good workout that makes you feel you are actually there with this really action packed film, that will keep you on the edge of your seats on wondering where the next explosive sound will hit your senses.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

No. 1 Audio Commentary by Director Stuart Baird: Stuart Baird says that normally with the STAR TREK picture, it normally starts with a big opening film fanfare and stars are introduced, and also the main crew, but Stewart decided to put all that at the end of the film and just start the picture with the title STAR TREK NEMESIS and the reason for that is that it is such a dark beginning and felt we should get on with the story. When we get to the wedding scene, Stuart tells us that originally it was a much longer scene, but on reflection decided to edit it much shorter, to get the right balance. Stuart felt that if you have never seen a STAR TREK film, especially with NEMESIS, you do not need that whole back story history and their relationships. Stuart was also so pleased to have Jerry Goldsmith doing the film music score, especially many times before with the previous STAR TREK films and of course they call him Mr. Star trek, and also feels Jerry Goldsmith has done a really fantastic wonderful film score for this film. When we see B-4 and Data hooked up together, Stuart tells us that the overhead filming was done by a motion control shot, which is computer controlled camera, and the move was very complicated and of course Brent Spiner played both parts and had to be filmed twice and took a total of nine hours to complete the filming of that particular scene, and Stuart feels it was totally worth it. When Praetor Shinzon and Captain Jean-Luc Picard talk face to face over the meal, he wanted really good colour, compared to when you see the young Shinzon as a small boy down the mines, well Stuart wanted those scenes to be completely devoid of any colour and look washed out. With most of the rest of the audio commentary Stuart just goes into lots of technical. But as we get to the long credits at the end of the film Stuart stopped talking without warning which I found very, but despite this, it was not too bad audio commentary.

No. 2 Audio Commentary by Producer Rick Berman: As the film starts, Rick Berman introduces himself, and informs us that this film was the brain child of John Logan, who he praises very much as a wonderful writer, and of course informs us that John is a massive STAR TREK fan and a dream come true to actually be involved with this STAR TREK film. When the toxic radiation poison is released in the Romulan Senate and all the senators turn to stone, we are told that it took hours of make-up and eventually was finished off with computer generated images, especially the part when the senator crashes to the floor. Rick tells us that all the sets for the Enterprise, especially when the film has been shot, all the scenery is carefully dismantled for the next STAR TREK film and it is all stored in big warehouses in different locations like Burbank and the San Fernando Valley. Rick Berman is another one who gives great praise to the late great genius of the film music score composer Jerry Goldsmith, who is definitely the film music score maestro genius. When the STAR TREK crew get beamed onto the Scimitar ship, Rick gives great praise on Herman Zimmermans production design. And so ends the second audio commentary that was quite interesting, but unfortunately Rick Berman does a lot of long gaps before he comments on.

No. 3 Audio Commentary by Michael Okuda and Denise Lynn Okuda: Here as usual both of these people introduce themselves and inform us that they are here to talk about the film STAR TREK: NEMESIS and the heroes from The Next Generation Sci-Fi franchise. They talk specifically about film titles that were designed by Richard Greenberg who is a motion graphics and main titles designer from Chicago and in 1977. During his R/GA period, he was responsible for the main titles for Superman, Alien, The World According to Garp, Altered States, Dirty Dancing, Death Becomes Her, and The Untouchables, as well as visual effects work on Predator and The Devils Advocate. Richard Greenberg has don work with Stan Winston for Predator earned them an Academy Award nomination for visual effects in 1987. So without doubt do not contemplate listening to these two talk 90% vacuous comments, this audio commentary should definitely get the No. 1 Raspberry Award for total boredom.

Special Feature: Library Computer [2016] [1080p] A very cool interactive graphic trivia interface, which is loaded with screen-specific information with just about every aspect of the 'STAR TREK' universe. The Library Computer is overflowing with data that pours out at steady amounts of clips. The Library Computer is an interactive experience that allows you to access information about People, Technology, Locations and more, at the moment each item appears in the film. Switch to Index Mode to scan the entire database and jumps directly to the items of interest. All content is divided into the following categories: Culture; Science & Medicine; Starfleet Ops; Miscellaneous; Life Forms; Planets & Location; People; Technology and Ships.

Special Feature: Production: Here you have a selection of seven different features, which are as follows:

01. NEMESIS Revisited [2005] [480i] [1.37:1] [25:45] When the STAR TREK IX: INSURRECTION was completed, they thought of another STAR TREK film was not on the cards and everyone thought that the film STAR TREK X: NEMESIS was the last thing anyone thought would never happen. But soon word got around that this film was given the go ahead and of course all the actors and crew were really excited to be back together again, as they all worked so well on the previous film, just like one big happy family.

02. New Frontiers: Stuart Bird on Directing NEMESIS [2003] [480i] [1.37:1] [8:42] here we get to hear views with great praise to the director Stuart Bird, as they all felt he gave a breath of fresh air and especially a new set of eyes into the STAR TREK Sci-Fi franchise. We also get some nice in-depth insight into the directors thoughts on how he wanted to tackle the film.

03. Storyboarding The Action [2005] [480i] [1.37:1] [3:37] Here we get to meet Tom Southwell [Conceptual Artist] at working creating the storyboard for the film STAR TREK X, plus we also get to see images of the storyboard drawing at the top of the screen and below it an actual scene from the film relating to the drawing.

04. Red Alert! Shooting the Action of NEMESIS [2003] [480i] [1.37:1] [10:08] With the NEMESIS film, people wanted to get back to the scenario of a real action packed film, to compensate for the lack of action in the previous STAR TREK IX film, and you certainly got this with this film. We also see some rare behind-the-scene filming of some of the action parts of the film.

05. Build and Rebuild [2005] [480i] [1.37:1] [7:44] We get a behind-the-scene of the crew working on the different sets of the insides of the Enterprise and Shinzon space ships in their rough stages and then eventually we see the finished look of the film STAR TREK X.

06. Four-Wheeling In The Final Frontier [2005] [480i] [1.37:1] [10:14] Here once again we get to see behind-the-scene filming the desert scenes, especially with the special spectacular stunts with the four-wheel special vehicles, which are in fact 2.5 litre four cylinder Baja Off-Road Race cars that have been specially modified to be able to be driven in a desert scenario, which as you will see is quite spectacular in what you view.

07. Screen Test: Shinzon [2005] [480i] [1.37:1] [6:30] What we get to view is the actor Tom Hardy in Scene 49 [STAR TREK X] that was shot on the 1st November, 2001, which also has Patrick Stewart sitting opposite and facing the actor Tom Hardy.

Special Feature: The STAR TREK Universe: Here you have a selection of nine different features, which are as follows:

01. A STAR TREK Familys Final Journey [2003] [480i] [1.37:1] [16:16] With this feature it is all about making the actual STAR TREK X film and not about filming the STAR TREK X film, and everyone was so happy to be reunited once again, especially knowing that the director Stuart Baird was at the helm, especially as he is a massive fan of the STAR TREK genre, and especially directing the last of the 10 original 10 STAR TREK film franchise. We also get to hear in detail about the long process in getting the script up to scratch to bring it into the final process to start filming.

02. A Bold Vision of The Final Frontier [200?] [480i] [1.37:1] [00:00] Stuart Baird [Director] talks about the differences between the Enterprise and the Shiznon bridges, that he wanted to be completely different in look, and especially having the Shiznon bridge to be completely massive, bold and intimidating, especially asking Herman Zimmerman to give it a very Germanic metallic look. All in all this is again a very nice little feature and especially hearing the personal views of the director Stuart Baird.

03. The Enterprise-E [2005] [480i] [1.37:1] [11:36] Herman Zimmerman [Production Designer] gives us his personal views on his designs and constructions of the different sets for all the sets on the STAR TREK X film. John Eaves [Illustrator] talks about his involvement in producing all the artwork designs, especially as they he was asked to design new sets.

04. Reunion With The Rikers [2009] [1080p] [1.78:1] [10:47] Here we meet Marina Sirtis and Jonathan Frakes talking about producing a half hour TV sitcom entitled The Rikers in Space and would have their whacky Uncle Data and their little dog Worf, and they would live on the Titan spaceship and would be a comedy. But the main plot is that the Rikers would go into space and carry out the Prime Directive with all the planets in the Federation, but most of the time you take their comments about their proposed TV series very tongue in cheek!

05. Todays Tech Tomorrows Data [2009] [1080p] [1.78:1] [4:23] Here we meet Laurent Itti [Associate Professor of Computer Science at the USC] and is a computational neuroscientist, and talks about how we can learn from biology and can see the use for the next generation with robots. I got so totally bored by the whole experience.

06. Robot: Hall of Fame [2009] [1080p] [1.78:1] [4:34] We are at the Carnegie Mellon University, which is a Private University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where in 2007 spokesperson Donald Marinelli [Carnegie Mellon Technology Executive] announces the name of the first of their class of four robots that is to be inducted into their Robot Hall of Fame, at robot of Lt. Commander Data, which Brent Spiner was very honoured to be included.

05. Brent Spiner: Data and Beyond Part 4 [2009] [1080p] [1.78:1] [9:18] Here for the very last time is Brent Spiner [Data/B-4] talking about his time with the STAR TREK Sci-Fi franchise and especially appearing in NEMESIS, which came about when Brent was on stage in a Broadway play and afterwards met John Logan to ask Brent to come on board to help write the screenplay for NEMESIS, especially in collaboration with Rick Berman and be like the three Musketeers.

08: Trek Roundtable: NEMESIS [2009] [1080p] [1.78:1] [10:26] Here once again for the last time thankfully we have these ghastly four boring STAR TREK nerds again, talking about the film STAR TREK X: NEMESIS as this feature is the most boring one I have ever had to endure. One thing I hope, that Paramount Pictures did not pay them a fee to appear in the studio?

09: Academy Starfleet Academy SCISEC Brief 010: Thalaron Radiation [2009] [1080p] [1.78:1] [2:27] This is the tenth and final one in the series of plot recaps hosted as though they were Starfleet instructional videos at the Starfleet Academy, Ex Astris, Scientia, San Francisco MMCLXI. In this episode, Starfleet Science Officer [Sarah Backhouse] from the 24th century examines the effects of Shinzon's use of Thalaron radiation. Thalaron radiation is a form of electromagnetic radiation in the tertiary EM band that was deadly to organic forms of life as it was capable of instantly killing such organisms with even small amounts. Unlike gamma rays, Thalaron radiation did not bring about a mutative effect to a living organism's genome but rather destroys it through a form of necrosis. Once every cell has been exposed to the radiation, the once-living being simply turns to ash and fractures.

Special Feature: The Romulan Empire: Here you have a selection of five different features, which are as follows:

01. Romulan Lore [2005] [480i] [1.37:1] [11:51] Rick Berman [Producer] informs us that John Logan is a massive fan of the STAR TREK franchise and loves big epic characters, and especially creating their home planet of the Romulans.

02. Shinzon and The Viceroy [2005] [480i] [1.37:1] [10:00] Rick Berman [Producer] informs us once again and talks about the baddies that always stars in the STAR TREK film franchise and this time the villain is Shiznon.

03. Romulan Design [2005] [480i] [1.37:1] [9:05] Here we meet Syd Dutton [Special Visual Effects of Illusion Arts Inc.] who did all the artistic paintings for the concept of the Romulan world, which is really spectacular.

04. The Romulan Senate [2005] [480i] [1.37:1] [8:37] This feature goes into great detail into the design of the Romulan Senate and the reason for the style of the characters. The actual design of the Romulan Senate was again done by Herman Zimmerman [Production Designer.

05. The Scimitar [2005] [480i] [1.37:1] [13:14] This particular feature goes into great detail about the design of the Shiznon spaceship the Scimitar as informed by Herman Zimmerman [Production Designer]. We also get input from William Ladd Skinner [Film Art Set Designer] who designed the tactical Scorpion fighter space vehicle that Captain Picard and Data escape from the Scimitar spaceship.

Special Feature: Deleted Scenes [2003] [480i] [1.33:1] [27:13] Here you have a selection of thirteen different deleted scenes, which are as follows: Rick Berman Introduction; Wesleys New Mission; Chateau Picard; 2267; The Time of Conquest; Data and B-4; Federation Protocols; The Change For Peace; A Loss of Self; Remember Him? [Extended]; Turbolift Violation; Sickbay Prepares For Battle; Cleaning Out Datas Quarters; Crusher At Starfleet Medical and Advice For The First Officer. As usual you can either watch them separately or Play All. Contributors include Rick Berman [Producer], Patrick Stewart [Jean-Luc Picard]

Special Feature: Archives: Here you have a selection of three different features and they are as follows:

01. Storyboards: With this feature you have a selection of four different subjects and to view the said features you get displayed, you have to use the right and left arrow keys on your remote control to view the said images in each of these galleries, which are as follows: Scorpion Escape: Here you get to view 49 very roughly drawn storyboard images. The Jeffries Tube: Here you get to view 53 very roughly drawn storyboard images. Collision: Here you get to view 45 very roughly drawn storyboard images.

02. Production: Here you get to view a total of 58 stunning images, which consist of John Eaves brilliant illustrations, photographs of some of the sets and lots of behind-0the-scene photographs of the cast and crew.

03. Props: Here you get to view a total of 21 colour photographs of different props that were used in the film STAR TREK X: NEMESIS.

Special Feature: Trailers: Here you have a selection of two different trailers for the film STAR TREK X: NEMESIS, which are as follows: Teaser Trailer [2002] [1080p] [2.35:1] [1:31] and Theatrical Trailer [2002] [1080p] [2.35:1] [2:01]. Here you get to view two totally stunning and spectacular trailers that give you a great impression of what to expect when you actually view the brilliant action packed film STAR TREK X: NEMESIS.

BD-LIVE: To view the contents via your Blu-ray player, it has to be connected to the internet; otherwise it is not BD-LIVE capable. For possible solutions to resolve this problem, please consult your Blu-ray player manual.

Finally, with the STAR TREK X: NEMESIS [2002] film, it is important to note NEMESIS has a place in the STAR TREK folk lore history. It is the last filmed adventure of THE NEW GENERATION crew, at least as of this moment in time, but as always there is always hope! Ironically and unfortunately, STAR TREK X: NEMESIS was a sad failure at the box office, especially a bald Romulan leader with a long coat, acting like the Roman leader Nero, and look what happened to him. As a STAR TREK fan myself, I did enjoy seeing these great characters in action again, and just as good as the FIRST CONTACT film. Highly Recommended!

This episode had everything: action and adventure, political intrigue, drama and even a murder mystery thrown in to boot. I couldn't get enough of it. I've shown it to two of my good friends and I believe this episode to be in the top 10 for The Original Series. I especially liked the fight scene involving Kirk and the Andorian. Simply put, Kirk can fight! I loved how the fight scene was not subbed by stuntmen. You see William Shatner in all his athletic glory doing things that maybe only Avery Brooks could do as Benjamin Sisko.

I'm proud to be the fifth person to review this VHS tape and the third to award it a Five Star review. It's too bad that individual episodes are not available on DVD. Thus the only way to view these episodes is to see them individually on VHS. But I promise you, you will not be disappointed. This is an episode worth seeing. My favorite quote from this episode comes from a minor Andorian character. ""Perhaps you should forget logic and devote yourself to motivations of passion for gain. Those are reasons for murder."" Spock could only look at a crime in a logical way which prevented him from seeing the overall total picture... until it was almost too late.
