8561508,3,B00B2MKSPM,"Was just Ok, somewhat entertaining. Was watching the Chris Isaak show and wondered what happened to Anson, and low and behold I searched and found this movie. Typical Hollywood story. Some of the actors were pretty lame, but otherwise, if you like the actors that are in it, you should be glad you watched it. If you are like ""who are those people"", move on to the next show and pass on this one.",1444953600,,396,4.364864864864865
8561509,5,B00B2MKSPM,"This is a really fun movie and it deserves all of the critical awards that it got. It is obviously a relatively low-budget film and I never heard of anyone in it (other than the stars that do cameos), but the two stars (Jed Rees and Jon Huck) are terrific and play their roles with as much confidence and commitment as any actor could. There is nothing spectacular going on here, no special effects, no worlds colliding in outer space, just two friends on an adventure in Hollywood that teaches them both some lessons about what is really valuable in life and what is just a sideshow.

I don't think there are two many guys out there that sit around and watch films with their male friends, but this is a great buddy film. So guys will have to watch it alone, lol, and just pretend they're watching it with a friend.

Really, a worthwhile film and one of those slow and easy movies that is nice to watch in bed (which is where I watched it) after a long and stressful day. This film was worth making and it's worth watching.",1433635200,,1024,4.328125
8561510,5,B00B2MKSPM,"Oh the fleeting dream of a Hollywood star. Great performances, and a great lesson about what is truly important in life.",1398988800,,120,4.761904761904762
8561511,3,B00B2MKSPM,"Abbott and Lennie are two garbage men who have been working together for 13 years and who pick up trash in Beverly Hills. Lenny in particular is a celebrity worshipper and finds his route, which includes the mansions of many of the stars, to be fascinating. One day upon dumping their trash at the landfill, Lenny discovers an Oscar belonging to Cuba Gooding, Jr. He and Abbott take the Oscar back to the office of the trash-collecting company.

Soon word gets out and Abbott and Lenny become instant celebrities. An agent contacts them and sets up numerous interviews (including one with Oprah). Enduring fame seems certain, especially when they are scheduled to go to Cuba Gooding's house to hand over the Oscar (while the TV cameras roll). So certain is Lenny his fame is going to make him wealthy that he hands in his resignation to his boss (who gives him a going-away party).

That's pretty much the plot (except for the predictable ending). And the take-away message isn't much more profound. Namely, the Hollywood press goes after the latest news, and fame is fleeting.

Nor is there much to be said for the dialogue. It too is trite, and the actors say their lines without much emotion.

Giving this movie three stars is generous. I do so only because there aren't too many movies (to my knowledge) that are made about garbagemen. And there's a nice background shot at one point of a BNSF container train. (I'm a railfan, and for me this was the high point of the movie.)",1375056000,,1480,4.659003831417625
8561512,5,B00B2MKSPM,"Very intuitive, thought-provoking movie that depicts a no-holds-barred approach to the movie industry, and the amount of division there truly is between the classes.  Not since ""The Player"" have I seen a movie that really tells it like it is in Hollywood, and just how far ""fandom"" stretches.",1367971200,2,292,5.083333333333333

8561514,5,B00B2MKSPM,Unique subject matter. Award winning festival favorite. Film about obsession with celebrity and how far is going too far. Sweet and charming!,1367193600,2,141,5.454545454545454
