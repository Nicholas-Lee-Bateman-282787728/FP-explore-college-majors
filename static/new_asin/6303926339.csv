If you are, in fact, fascinated by bugs you should know that this is actually just a tiny taste of the amazing things that Thomas Eisner presents in his book ""For Love of Insects""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/For-Love-of-Insects/dp/0674018273/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">For Love of Insects</a>.

7854962,5,6303926339,"This documentary follows the piorneering explorations of a Cornell Entomologist by the name of Professor Thomas Eisner.  Some of the footage in this film has never been shown.  Thomas Eisiner takes us into the world of chemical defenses among insects.  We see a beetle that shoots poison, a millipede that emits a cloud of toxins, a moth that secretes aphrodisiacs.  And one of the most fascinating segments is on a beetle (hemisperota) that has the ability to hold on with its feet with over one hundred times its body weight.  Eisner takes us through the scientific process by making observations, making a hypothesis, investigating and then reaching a conclusion.  Amazingly, during the filming of this program, Eisner made a discovery of an insect which resulted in a science journal article.
This film is perfect for high school biology students.",994032000,3,851,5.086330935251799
