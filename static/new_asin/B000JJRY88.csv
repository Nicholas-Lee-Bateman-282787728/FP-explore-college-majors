I have an upcoming back surgery, the doctor said I will have to work hard if I'm to return to my job(Sergeant Police Force.) This video shows the amount of dedication and hard work someone put into reaching her dreams. Really made me feel sad to think I used to go to the gym for an hour 3-4 days a week and get upset I didn't see much improvement. Seeing how hard Monica trains, I expected (look at her!) but the behind the scenes look at all the other training besides weights and eating well, supplements, and the constant dance routine work. It's a great video and this just made me appreciate her more.",1217376000,4,676,4.373015873015873
