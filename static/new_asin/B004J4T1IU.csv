8431619,1,B004J4T1IU,"This film was originally titled ""Oasis of the Zombies"" back in 1981. It is titled ""Treasure of the Living Dead"" at IMDB.  People are after the Nazi gold guarded at an oasis. There are flashbacks to desert fighting as I felt I was watching ""Rat Patrol"" with zombies, only worse. There is a girl in Daisy Dukes who is grabbed similarly to the cover. Yeah!

The transfer was exceptionally bad for a 1981 film. It had a grainy video and audio movie buzz. The translation wasn't too swift either. The product is more bad than cheesy. The zombie faces never moved and appeared to be well done masks/heads, some with worms crawling in them. I suspect for many of the close ups, someone simply held up a fake head and moved it forward. If you are going to watch it, I suggest do it for free at Dailymotion...or buy my once viewed copy ;).

8431620,5,B004J4T1IU,I love this  movie! It has nothing to do with brain craving zombies. It is a cheezy movie about Nazi Zombies who want revenge. If you love C rated as in cheezy than this one is great. But please don't pay more than $3.99 & that is from the distributor. That is all it's worth & they know. Had a fun time laughing at the cheezy effects. It is easy being cheezy :),1346284800,,362,3.958904109589041
8431621,1,B004J4T1IU,"The only this I can say about this movies is that it is a poor copy of ""Oasis of the zombies"". The video quality is poor compared to Oasis of the Zombies. The movie itself has very poor acting. The zombie walk like the actors in the zombie costumes had trouble seeing where to go. The plot is poor. The action scenes are very unrealistic with poor editing. All in all a very poor movie. I am sorry I purchased it.

If you are looking for a nazi zombie movie do not buy this one. Buy a better movie like ""Outpost"".",1304121600,2,513,4.079207920792079
8431622,1,B004J4T1IU,"I saw this some years ago, thinking it might at least be good for a few laughs.

It wasn't.

Not even the title can save this F grade flick. So cheap in it's attempt to horrify, all it does is gross you out, and not even that very well. If you like scenes of zombies deliberately holding up animal entrails for you to see so you know that they are supposedly eating the guts of their victims, this film is for you.

If you are a director of a horror flick, you have to scare people carefully and not just dump it in their face, like this poor attempt at a movie. When you get the sense that the director had no feeling for finesse, you realize that you are not involved in the story at all, but just watching how this incompetent person tried to make a movie and failed. Beyond 'affected', it seems from the start that no one making this celluloid cared about any aspect of it at all, and just wanted to finish and move on, as you should.

Some cheap horror flicks are so bad they are good, but this one doesn't get anywhere near that. No surprise it's unavailable. I don't believe in censorship or bookburning, but Western Civilization will be better off if this one is completely forgotten.

Hope no one even gets as far as to read this review.

Go look up 'Cannibal Holocaust' if you want a GOOD bad flick.",1303171200,3,1309,4.236947791164659
