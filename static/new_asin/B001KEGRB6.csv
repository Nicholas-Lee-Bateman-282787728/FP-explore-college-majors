8314770,4,B001KEGRB6,"The dvd is about 60 minutes long and in total you see about 6 models being interviewed and evetually strip naked for the camera. All the girls are pretty much beautiful if not somewhat SHAG-able. The first one is a blonde girl with a cat face tattoo on her vagina, she shows the camera her mother son symbol ring and during the interview she brags about how she is a single mommy and has 2 kiddos. YOu can see the stretch marks on most of the girls in this video but they hardly bother me as they still look good under certain lighting. There is also one latina who by the way talks about her wedding ring but doesnt mention she is a mommy because you can visibly view her c-section scar and stretch marks along her sides and inner thighs, she is busty and a little bit big on the butt size end but she is still worth a view. The only thing about this dvd that I did not like  is that there is a beautiful and very georgous young latina who is doing all the interviewing, you expect to see her naked at some time during this video but she keeps her clothes on the whole time. SHe is probably the youngest and most prettiest of them all but she never takes any clothing off, so don't be dissapointed because of this. I pretty much enjoyed the nudity and busty bodies in this video but I would say if you are not into the MILFY genere don't buy this one because these are not real playboy models and no computer generated effects were used to air brush out any wrinkles or childbirth scarring.",1296691200,4,1491,4.213286713286713
8314771,2,B001KEGRB6,"False advertisement...or perhaps more appropriately, falsie advertisement. Not a single natural breast to be found ANYWHERE on this DVD, and most of the surgical enhancements are downright Frankenstein-like. Scary and disgusting.

Busty? Not even close. Even with the implants none of these women really live up to the moniker by nude modeling standards.

Babes? Well, there are three...in a row...near the end. The rest of these women range from just OK to honestly homely.

And the production values are poor for Playboy standards. For some reason many of the Playboy TV fare like this has taken a turn in the last couple or three years to this weird style that cuts everything to close-close-closeup, so you end up seeing really great shots of belly-button lint but have no real perspective. A good nude vid needs a mix of shots so that the viewer really gets an idea of what the model looks like. You can't shoot every single frame with a 300mm telephoto from 10 feet.

If you like busty women, dont' waste your time or money on this. Heck, if you like naked women period, don't waste your time or money on this. There are plenty of quality productions out there, and many of them by Playboy, but this one is about as far away from quality as it could be. Gets two stars only because there are several scenes of explicit nudity and I never overlook that.",1258416000,5,1358,4.669456066945607
8314772,3,B001KEGRB6,"It's too bad that this DVD didn't live up to its' title.  Some of the women are very hot, but most are average at best.  Only two truly qualify as ""busty"" based upon the Voluptuous Vixens videos Playboy released in the past.  The housewife from Indiana, though, is very hot.  Very hot.  Still, it's overpriced for what you get.",1240876800,10,327,4.47457627118644
