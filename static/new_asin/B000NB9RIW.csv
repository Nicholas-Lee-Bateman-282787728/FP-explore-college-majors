8176503,4,B000NB9RIW,"This latest contribution from the team that brought us ""Infernal Affairs"" deals with similar issues of the blurring of lines between moral good versus darkness. ""Confession of Pain"" has all the ingredients for a great movie about the scars and wounds of the past (evident in both Tony Leung's and Takeshi Kaneshiro's characters) affecting actions in the present. While both actors give very strong performances, it is more the lack of substantial development of back stories for the characters that leave them with little to work with. The fault lies with the filmmaker, who couldn't decide if he wanted a whodunit-cop movie or a textured narrative about pain and loss. All said, though, the fact of the matter is that the movie has Kaneshiro (as in Takeshi Kaneshiro) in it: Jeez, buy it for that reason alone.",1195084800,9,811,4.927007299270073
