8565923,5,157486999X,"I checked this DVD out from the library and liked it so much I decided to buy my own copy. I have been crocheting for many decades and consider myself fairly good at it. I learned many useful tidbits from this DVD. Also I hope it will be helpful as I teach my grand-daughter the art of crochet! You won't be disappointed if you decide to purchase this DVD,",1382832000,2,356,4.173913043478261
