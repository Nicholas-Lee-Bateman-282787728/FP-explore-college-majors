8181699,1,B000NVJSH2,"Seriously... Between the Walls was superfluous for theatrical time for anyone wanting to watch a 'movie'; God forbid (<-- see what I did there, *wink) any one wasted money on such an unneeded 'work of art'; regardless of the cinematic presentation, because it was obviously a low-budget film, which is fine. But, c'mon, a horribly presented ""I hate Daddy"" story only to come at you with a ""this is why you need Jesus"" plot structure.  Heedless of the horribly creepy daddy presence of secretly recording the family for decades... yes lets just forget that all together, because that is obviously not ominous at all.  Instead, lets just 'leave it to Jesus' because... you know... God and stuff... and life will be so much better... Hey, how about WHY Daddy dearest was secretly recording? Was it some weird and sick perversion? No, Daddy just wanted to know what was going on ALL the time, then saving the recordings. Yea, because that is practical (sarcasm for anyone who couldn't infer the typing tone).  Why did I waste my life watching this?!",1513209600,,1045,4.826815642458101

8181702,5,B000NVJSH2,Great movie about forgiveness between a Father and a Son and how God forgives us,1485043200,,80,4.4
8181703,1,B000NVJSH2,"I have seen a zillion movies in my lifetime, but after watching this one, I know that I have now scraped the absolute BOTTOM of the barrel.  The FBI warning should dictate that this film only be shown within the walls of fundamentalist Sunday school classes.",1227139200,4,258,4.608695652173913
8181704,5,B000NVJSH2,THOUGH THE MOVIE IS LOW BUDGET THE STORY IS GREAT. THE ACTING IS PRETTY GOOD IT WAS WORTH BUYING AND OWNING. THERE IS ONLY ONE CAMERA BUT IT WAS WELL SHOT. GREAT FOR YOUTH GROUP SHOWING. MOST CHRISTIAN MOVIES ARE DONE ON A LOW BUDGET. SOME FILMS HAVE MILLIONS SPENT AND WASTED BASICLY LOOK NO FURTHER THAN CATWOMAN.,1225411200,3,315,4.448275862068965
8181705,5,B000NVJSH2,"The move was an outstanding Christian Drama.  Every man, who had a 1950s Dad should watch it!",1210636800,,93,4.470588235294118
8181706,4,B000NVJSH2,"This is an excellent film that gives the viewer an inside look at the disastrous effects of religious delusion within any family.  A so-called ""Christian"" scenario is presented here, though.

I love the simplicity of the film.  It is not presented in the typical overdone fashion of Hollywood films that are out there today.

It is real and to the point.  Highly recommended to folks of all ideological persuasions.  Keep an open mind.",1207353600,4,435,4.890410958904109
8181707,1,B000NVJSH2,"I largely agree that this is not very entertaining. I agree with its premise that letting go of anger and resentment is very therapeutic. But it was awkward getting there and the case was not made that God is necessary to get there. That was simply claimed.

The premise of a family's life secretly recorded by a tyranical father was full of possibilities but full use was not made of it, other than to say that the boy had every right to be angry. The acting and script were weak. It was nice seeing the son able to be happy at the end after he made a snap decision to forgive, but not worth the whole film to get there.",1196208000,7,621,4.175
8181708,1,B000NVJSH2,"This ""movie"" is actually a Christian ""self help"" presentation that should not be included in the Entertainment or Drama sections of any video store. I am not going to make negative comments about the production...all involved seem to be conscientious and well-intended, but if you rent or buy this for traditional entertainment value you will be very disappointed. It belongs on the shelf of a Christian bookstore, not mixed in with R-rated DVD's at the local Hollywood Video (where I found it). If you hate your dead father and want to get over it, this might do you some good; but if you're looking for a good drama or action movie, this isn't it.",1187654400,6,649,4.701754385964913
