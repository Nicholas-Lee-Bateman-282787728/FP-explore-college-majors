8368119,5,B002EP8TW0,"None of the three existing reviews actually address this ballet film so I have to chime in. This is a rare modern large-scale ballet with a 'cast of hundreds' including soloists, dancers, orchestra and chorus, filmed live at the Arena di Verona in 1990. Led by composer Theodorakis, the musicians and vocalists are nothing short of magnificent. All of the fabled tunes from the 1960s movie are here -- doubled and trippled in length, so we really get to savour those wonderful tunes! The choreography by Lorca Massine is both touchingly lyrical and bouyant, depending on tone; all is quite effective. He knows how to fill the huge Verona stage with effective & energetic movement. The dance soloists are all extraordinary, from the great Vasiliev as Zorba to Iancu as the young man (""John"" in the ballet version) to Savignano as the Widow he loves. The Italian ballerina who dances the elderly Mme Hortense, who believes that Zorba wants to marry her, is quite touching. [Unlike the film version, here we get to see Mme Hortense in her fantasy wedding garb, with 30-foot wedding veil. An amazing moment!] The all-purpose set depicts a whitewashed, multi-leveled Cretan village. My only quibble is with the slight fuzziness of the photography but such was the technology available 25 years ago; on the other hand, the composition of shots and editing are spot on. This is a beautiful piece of 'total art,' the scale of which would probably be financially prohibitive to stage today (in 2013). Thank goodness that it has been captured on film, available in this extraordinary DVD.",1376265600,4,1578,4.93609022556391

Thank You,

8368121,5,B002EP8TW0,"Apparently Mr. Walker has mistaken this production for the film version with Anthony Quinn, which illustrates the danger of reviewing an item that you have not laid eyes on. I haven't seen it either, but a glance at the sleeve photo will tell you that this is an Arena di Verona production, not a Hollywood film.",1249171200,6,312,4.589285714285714
8368122,1,B002EP8TW0,"Well, here's another great film to avoid, avoid, avoid.

Zorba the Greek is a film from 1964, not 1990.  It was filmed in 1.85:1 widescreen.  You want to buy a butchered version in which half the film has been hacked away?  Go ahead.  We all know that ""full"" screen is a marketing lie: a ""full"" screen is whatever aspect the film was originally.  The 1.33:1 mutilation isn't ""full"" screen in any sense of the term.

Don't buy this turkey.  Wait until a responsible DVD producer gives you at least a 16:9 version.  Giving money to the people who deliberately mutilate films only encourages them -- this is only a ploy to get your money for the butchered version and then get your money again when the film as the director intended it is released.",1248912000,,745,4.5
