7969357,5,B00006ISA7,"This might seem hard to believe, but the three episodes within this DVD, are funnier than those in the first DVD!  First, the school is having the yearly physical and Hibiki might have to have a physical too!  Then, in the second lesson, the students start getting into fights.  How will Hibiki handle their flaring tempers?  Then, in the last lesson, the school's director tries to set Hibiki up with the perfect man!
During all this Hibiki finds out he likes bras and is starting to enjoy shopping.  What is a cross-dresser to do?  And does breast size REALLY matter?
The extras are great.  Another art gallery and the female student roll call.  High ratio of laughs per minute.  While only 75 minutes, I think there is more humor packed into the second DVD than the first (as I pointed out before).  IF they can keep to these high standards I will have to declare this the best cross-dressing anime series EVER!",1057968000,,914,4.58641975308642
7969358,5,B00006ISA7,"I bought the first one cause I was in the mood for something silly. And while indeed it is a silly anime about this young guy who ends up crossdressing to get a job at a prestigious private school(that only accepts females as teacher) it has a certain warmth that caught me off guard.
The character I like most is young Fuko, who is becoming more and more interested in Hibiki. (our male/transvestite lead)
This situation should provide some interesting moments in future episodes. As she herself is starting to feel unsure of herself because she has feelings for someone who she thinks is a woman.
But it's not all seriousness. This is a comedy, and a pretty naughty one at that. While there's no real sex and stuff to speak of(good thing cause it would bring down the quality) there's the 2 school girl lovers from Hibiki's appartment complex who keep trying to get a peak at the girls in skimpy gym clothes ;-) Ofcourse their plans keep getting foiled by the landlady from hell who's on Hibiki's side. A foundation for some hilarious scenes :-)
all In all highly reccomended",1049155200,5,1077,4.614583333333333
7969359,5,B00006ISA7,"This series is intended for mature teens of the high-school age and deals with some of the problems of growing kids, but overall is mainly a fun watch - the people aren't stuck on any personal problems, for example, and live their life nicely enough. It's serious enough not to be outright silly, and decent enough for kids in high school. Sentimentality is often a subject and nothing more gripping than being honest. This is like any main stream people oriented afterschool show intended to entertain teens - some goofing around, but overall a freindly vieing.",1044489600,,562,4.864583333333333
7969360,5,B00006ISA7,"Hibiki's story continues in this second disk. He starts to make mistakes causing the vice principle to question his disguise. Unlike in the first disk where you were forced to believe the impossible, here Hibiki actually panics a bit when his secret may be found out. The schoolkids continue to be quirky and fun adding to the enjoyment of the show. I'm glad I picked this series up on a whim. :)",1037664000,2,396,4.513888888888889
7969361,5,B00006ISA7,"I think this had more of a touch of humor than the first one.  This is called Pop Quiz because his gender is being tested by this vice principal; for instance, there is an annual physical examination.  Meanwhile, Fuko develops a weird fascination with other women's breasts!  I will leave it up to you to find out why.  Please watch this film, but you better watch carefully to pick up on the Japanese cultural references.",1036195200,2,422,4.586666666666667
