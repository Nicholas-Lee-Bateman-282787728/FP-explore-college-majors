I recently found out that Cosell never made it into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Talk about a glaring oversight!

How can the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton 'legitimately' write the history of professional football without a single mention of Howard Cosell?

The Pete Rozelle Radio-Television Award is given annually by the Pro Football Hall of Fame to an iconic football broadcasting figure for ""longtime exceptional contributions to radio and television in professional football."" Yet for the 23-year history of the award, there has been one glaring oversight: Howard Cosell has not yet won it. Cosell needs no explanation of why he belongs. Monday Night Football made the NFL the dominant professional sports league in America. Cosell was simply the most famous radio and television sportscaster of all time and the lead of the classic Monday Night Football broadcast team of the 1970s and early '80s. Everyone else associated with that team; Frank Gifford, Don Meredith, Dan Dierdorf, and producer Roone Arledge, have won the award. This makes no sense to me. With Howard Cosell's exceptional contributions to professional football, how can the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton legitimately write the history of football without honoring Howard Cosell with the Pete Rozelle Radio-Television Award???

It features on the first MNF game between the Jets and the Browns,some of the biggest players on MNF,the Greatest MNF game ever(on release),a look at the great commentaries over the years and players comments on the BIGGEST GAME OF THE WEEK!.
Hosted by AL,DAN and FRANK!.It prepares you for the next chapter of MNF with Madden in 02. I only wish that it was longer and had more games featuring Elway and Montana!.",1020556800,2,665,4.5041322314049586
7840744,5,6303194125,Although the 25th Anniversary video shows some of the same footage that was included in the 20th Anniversary video I still enjoyed it. I consider myself to be a fanatical of football and there is nothing better to cap off  the week than Monday Night Football. This video brings you right into  Monday Night Football even on tuesday in April! Great job folks.  I watch  it when I need a football fix. P8 from  P8 Speaks,928800000,3,418,4.447368421052632
