8434961,5,B004LVRQ5Q,"I liked this production because it was informative. However, I feel as though it was poorly put together. I am a long time fan of all 5 actors including; Anthony Quinn, Audrey Hepburn, Charlton Heston, Grace Kelly, and Marilyn Monroe. I felt as though it held my attention the entire time. I loved learning new things about all the Actors and Actress in the production that I did not previously know. I am a huge fan of all of them and appreciate the chance to get to learn more about them. There were several pictures and stories that were told about them that helped you to really picture what the narrator was saying. All of these Actors and Actresses are the kind of people who should be looked up to. I feel as though this production did them the honor of making their well deserving lives better known. This film made them look like real people who encountered every day struggles, just as we do. I feel this film showed that they were all real people who weren't just picture perfect. In my opinion it made me respect them that much more. All 5 of them had to work very hard to get where they were and I believe we tend to look over this. In my opinion I believe the they did an honorable job educating others and remembering these 5 very special people. If was a family friendly production although more geared towards mature ages. I also had no problems with my shipping experience and received the product in a timely manner.",1365206400,4,1435,4.4393939393939394
