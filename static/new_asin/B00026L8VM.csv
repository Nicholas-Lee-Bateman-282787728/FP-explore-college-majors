2064256,1,B00026L8VM,Amazon incorrectly has this item listed as closed captioned. If you are hearing impaired and buying this video based on that information do not bother as it is a waste of money.,1116892800,,177,4.5625
2064257,1,B00026L8VM,I am in pretty good shape and thought this DVD was just awful.  The pace is WAY to slow for anyone in shape.  I thought the instructor took way to long to explain very simple moves and I did not feel like this video would help me stay in shape.  I could barely complete the DVD one time because it was so incredibly boring. I also did not like the set up of the DVD itself because each individual excercise needed to be prompted by pushing a button so after each exercise I had to push the next button and this was annoying. I would only purchase this DVD is I had NEVER excerised before in my life and was interested in only simple stretches. Ultimately it is a waste of money and I was very disapointed.,1116547200,2,705,4.131386861313868
2064258,3,B00026L8VM,"For a beginner and for being pregnant, the exercises are good. Less intense than I'm used to, but helps with flexibility.

Unfortunately, the presentation is poor. The instructor stops the exercise to announce the next movement, which lasts a minute or two, disrupting the flow. You find yourself antsy and waiting for her to stop talking and get on with it. It would be a better dvd if they had figured out a way to explain the exercise while creating a smooth transition to the next exercise. I solved the problem by continuing to do the previous exercise while she was talking. But, it would be nice to have it flow more.",1114732800,8,624,4.571428571428571
2064259,2,B00026L8VM,"This was a very slow moving workout.  Literally, one move at a time with long pauses between each one.  Very slow and boring.  I am very disappointed with the amount of money I spent on this.  It is long and has a lot of different moves, but that's it.  You would be better off buying ""Yoga Mama"" by Crunch videos.",1114128000,6,314,4.166666666666667
2064260,4,B00026L8VM,"This is an excellent video/DVD: It is well organized, clear, concise.  There are two people to follow, one for early or post pregnancy and one who is in a more advanced trimester (the maker of the DVD herself, whose personality and demeanor are very pleasant). The emphasis is pregnancy and postnatal conditioning and protection of the pregnant and postnatal body. All of the exercises have been well modified for pregnancy, which I appreciated after 3 months of Pilates prior to pregnancy and 3 months of unmodified Pilates during pregnancy. The reason that I did not give this video 5 stars is that I found it too easy and too short of a session for someone with my amount of experience in Pilates and conditioning from other athletic activities (martial arts, aerobics, weight training, yoga).  It is certainly excellent for those new to Pilates.  Women should consider it body strengthening and conditioning along the lines of yoga, weight training, and tai chi and pursue other sources for more aerobic workouts.",1109289600,16,1017,5.005917159763314
2064261,5,B00026L8VM,"Having done this exercise whilst I was pregnant, which I enjoyed very much... I now put it on and my baby lies still on the playmat next to me when he hears the instructors voice! Worth every cent! The pace is slow and calm, which was helpful when I was bigger and finding it slower to move positions. Now it helps me to relax when the baby has a sleep.

The pelvic floor reminders are excellent throughout, as these often get forgotten in exercise videos.

I'd describe is as a bsic but effective workout, that is achievable even when you energy is low. I really recommend this one.",1102291200,25,583,4.388888888888889
2064262,5,B00026L8VM,"As a women who practices Pilates outside of Pregnancy I was impressed to find a DVD that adapted it so well for during pregnancy. Careful attention is paid to explaining the moves and ensuring that they are executed properly.

I was impressed and re-assured that the instructor was herself heavily pregnant. Two big thumbs up!",1093564800,22,326,4.927272727272728
2064263,3,B00026L8VM,"One admission.  I am 16 weeks into my pregnancy with a sore bump, so I did the Later Pregnancy Workout.  The exercises are fine.  They are mild.  My biggest issue is that the workout stops each time the moves change and the instructor discusses what's coming next.  So, the pace is very slow.  I may come to appreciate it during my 8th month, but today I will place the DVD in the back of my rotation.",1091664000,48,401,4.2105263157894735
2064267,4,B00026L8VM,"I agree with the reviewer regarding the annoying break between exercises--once you've done the workout several times, you don't need to hear the description of the next exercise anymore. However, don't let this deter you from buying this DVD. As a Pilates instructor, I was looking for something more gentle to do while pregnant, and the later pregnancy workout is an excellent prep for your abs and back. Jackson's breathing cues and demonstration of the exercises are excellent. Great stretches are included, too.",1125360000,14,515,5.216867469879518
2064268,4,B00026L8VM,This DVD is different. Instead of the up-beat power workout that is so usual in exercise programmes this one has a calming and reflective influence. I was reassured by the endorsement of the professional physical therapists. The pace suits my growing body. How nice to take time to exercise in a tranquil way with my baby.,1122163200,4,322,4.767857142857143
2064269,5,B00026L8VM,"I'm really enjoying using this DVD. I'm 30 weeks pregnant with my second child and the calm and relaxing feel of the workouts is brilliant at the end of a long day with my toddler! I feel very safe doing the exercises, even with my big bump, and it's really made me think about my posture during pregnancy.",1122076800,4,306,4.293103448275862
2064270,4,B00026L8VM,"After suffering for years with lower back pain, I was worried about how I'd go with my pregnancy, until my physiotherpaist recommended this fantastic DVD. After only a few sessions, I could really feel the difference in my stance, my strength and the ease in my lower back was heaven. The DVD is slow and meditative which is great for concentrating on each move and really feeling into the positions. It's not for gym bunnies, but then who wants to get all sweaty when you can get fantastic results, safely and solidly with maximum relaxation! Well done!!",1121558400,5,555,4.731958762886598
2064271,4,B00026L8VM,"I started using this DVD when I was 5 months pregnant and really enjoyed it. The exercises really helped my aches and pains, especially in my lower back. I've recommended it to my pregnant friends.",1121385600,2,197,4.6571428571428575
2064272,5,B00026L8VM,"I'm a yoga teacher who teaches Yoga to women in pregnancy.  I find Pilates in Pregnancy gives very clear,informative and safe instruction.  The pace is just right for women in pregnancy who need to go a little slower and the tone of the whole DVD is soothing.  All in all just what's needed for pregnant women who wish to prepare for birth with Pilates!",1121299200,2,353,4.484375
2064273,5,B00026L8VM,"An excellent DVD.  The work-out was safe and thorough.  I was reassured by the Physiotherapy Endorsement  I found the steady pace of the routines to be ideal.

2064274,2,B00026L8VM,"Before pregnancy I was working out 3-4 times per week with the Jennifer Kries pilates DVDs (which are great by the way) and after becoming pregnant, purchased this one to continue my exercise routine. I was SO disappointed in this one. It is achingly slow. Doing this video is like being in a trance state. In addition, between each exercise there's about a minute of nothing- just music and ""slo-mo"" footage of misc body parts moving, which I can't stand. I bought it because it looked serious- I didn't want any cheerleader-type perkily bouncing around, but I didn't want to be bored either! What a waste of $30.00 too- WAY overpriced- the production is cheesy also.",1121212800,2,668,4.767241379310345
2064275,1,B00026L8VM,This DVD is way too slow and is just basic stretching.  Not much focus on strength.  I was very disappointed and thought it was a waste of money.  I am still searching for a decent prenatal pilates DVD.,1118620800,2,202,4.2631578947368425
2064276,1,B00026L8VM,"I cannot believe that they put a 30 second ""intro"" inbetween each exercise!!  It was totally ridiculous!  I don't recommend this DVD at all!",1117497600,2,140,4.791666666666667
8022992,3,B00026L8VM,I have found this DVD to be very boring. Her explanations are long and you cannot skip them. There should be an option to skip instructions once you have the hang of it. I found the movements good for pregnancy.,1323820800,,211,4.3
8022993,5,B00026L8VM,fantastic workout. easy enough to do every day but as long as i did it every day the back pain stayed away. If i skipped a day i knew it.,1315094400,,137,3.6
8022994,5,B00026L8VM,"Yes, it is slow... but after trying 4 other prenatal pilates dvds, this is the one I came back to. The instructions are phenomenal, this was the only dvd that really helped with proper positioning and breathing. I definitely still felt the workout, but did not feel rushed in any way. This really helps to start my day out right. It also got rid of the back pain that I thought would just be a normal part of my pregnancy.",1267401600,,422,4.2875
8022995,2,B00026L8VM,"The long explanations are overkill, even for the first time you do the workout.  It almost put me to sleep.  The workout itself is very low-intensity.",1194307200,,150,4.730769230769231
8022996,1,B00026L8VM,"This was supposed to be one of the better pilates tapes, but it put me right to sleep. I hated her voice.
I ended up taking a class instead!",1182556800,,140,3.8620689655172415
8022997,5,B00026L8VM,I'm in my 15th week of pregnancy and suffered with intermittent but increasing pain in my tailbone for 2 weeks. I walk my dogs about 30-40 minutes per day and was moderately fit/toned all along so this pain was unusual. Putting socks and shoes on or picking up something from the floor was becoming severe agony. I was going to call my doctor to get chiropractic permission but I tried this DVD 1 time and it was like a switch that releived the pain. I felt 95% better immediatly after completing the warmup and early pregnancy portions of the video.  I agree with some reveiwers that it seems a bit slow but go with the pace and you'll feel the magic.  It's not for someone looking to transform their figure or get a good cardio workout- there are other great videos available for cardio lovers.,1158192000,2,796,4.482758620689655
8022998,1,B00026L8VM,"After reading the reviews posted here I decided to rent it before buying.  What a good decision!  The pace is just painfully slow.  The stretches are all very nice and very gentle, but to be honest I could not even finish it.  It stops between all moves to introduce the next move, and while you can certainly fast-forward through those intros, it's very annoying to have to do that.  If you have 1.5 hours to kill and aren't looking for a good-paced workout, then I guess this DVD would be good for you.  I'll never use it again, though.",1143676800,4,538,4.383838383838384
8022999,1,B00026L8VM,"I am currently 7 months pregnant with my second child.  As most others, I have found that your second pregnancy is totally different on your body than your first.  Soon into my pregnancy I came to the conclusion that I was definitely going to have to exercise frequently.

I am an avid fan of Pilates and I love all of my Windsor Pilates dvds that I have.  So I decided that it would be a great idea to find a pilates dvd for pregnancy. After searching the internet trying to find the perfect one, I settled on this dvd.  Thank goodness my parents bought it for me for my birthday!! I would be very upset if I had spent my own money on this dvd.  It is horrible!!  Yes, the stretches are great and you definitely feel relaxed when your ""work out"" is completed, but making it through the dvd is excrutiating.  I actually fell asleep the first time I used this dvd.  The pace is beyond slow and the way the narrator talks is even slower.  I was so disappointed that I have only used the dvd a total of 2 times.

If you want a great Pilates work out I would suggest purchasing ""Pilates During Pregnancy with Niece Pecenka"".  I love this dvd, I do this workout every night.  It is relaxing as well as it makes you feel like you have actually exercised.

So if I was you and had it to do all over again I would not purchase Pilates in Pregnancy...keep looking.",1138233600,22,1355,4.221789883268483
8023000,2,B00026L8VM,"I am glad I rented Pilates in Pregnancy instead of buying it.  I hesitate to call it a workout. It was more instructional than something I would actually use as a workout. Maybe if it came with cards (it might if you buy it) telling you what comes next... so you could do it without the dvd when you know the exercises... maybe that would be better.

It is put out by a British woman, so it was at least fun to listen to her talk. There was an ""Introduction"" section that I watched some of (it was really slow and boring - should have given me a hint as to the tone of the workout!) about neutral spine, breathing, and the pelvic floor.

Next came a warmup - about 7 minutes, only 4 moves. Here is the main defect I see in this workout. Each move has at least a minute of explanation beforehand. You should, I think, be able to select the workout without the explanations. It was ok the first time, but MY GOD, it would be so boring if I was doing it more than once.

There is a workout for Early Pregnancy, Later Pregnancy, and Post-Pregnancy. Here is another problem - if you go to the next chapter (so you can skip the Early Pregnancy section, for example), you have to skip through each exercise separately. I could have gone back to the main menu and skipped to the Later Pregancy workout, but it didn't seem worth it. SO - had to skip through the 12 exercises outlined in the Early Pregnancy workout before getting to mine.  (I am 24 weeks pregnant)

The moves were pretty good, again, but nothing new, and nothing challenging at all. And they spend about 2-3 minutes on each move. First, explain, explain, explain... then set-up. Are you sure you are set up properly? Ok... let's do the ""exercise,"" (and I generally use this term loosely with this dvd).

There is only one person doing the moves (there were two doing the warm-up - wonder what happened to the other lady? Maybe she got bored and left...) I think it is the same woman who is doing the voice-over. She is pregnant, maybe 5 or 6 months?

I can't say much about the moves. Again, nothing new, nothing challenging, I guess it felt good, but I wish I had done something else this morning. SO - back it goes to Netflix.  A pilates workout I like better for pregnancy is Jennifer Gianni's Fusion Pilates for Pregnancy.",1138233600,8,2284,4.342723004694836
8023001,4,B00026L8VM,"I used this video alongside Pilates classes during my second pregnancy and found it clear, calming and just the right pace for my changing body shape - there's no way I could have kept up with anything faster at 7 months pregnant!

I found it very informative, relaxing and a great way to focus myself in preparation for labour.",1125446400,6,328,4.559322033898305
