3852559,5,B00266PDZI,"Thank goodness season 2 is finally being released.  Police Woman fans have been waiting far too long for this.  Let's hope that seasons 3 and 4 will quickly follow.  Season 3 is my favorite, but season 2 has much to offer, as well.  Yaay!!",1320883200,24,239,4.363636363636363
3852560,5,B00266PDZI,"Sony released Season One of ""Police Woman"" in 2006 and I thought Season Two would quickly follow since they showed remastered clips from it on their ""Ladies Night"" promos that appeared on the ""Maude"" and ""Mary Hartman"" DVDs, among others. I guess sales weren't what they'd hoped and I've been longing for my Pepper fix for nearly six years! Thankfully, Shout Factory comes through once again, resurrecting this groundbreaking '70s series from oblivion.

This set consists of the 24 episodes that aired during the 1975-76 TV season on NBC. The picture quality is excellent and they all look like they were filmed yesterday. Purists will be delighted because the original Columbia logo is present at the end of the episodes so you are experiencing them exactly as they aired in 1975-76! Some episodes contain the alternate harpsichord theme song instead of the more familiar piano one. The insert has a nice color photo of Angie on the back and the same image of her appears on all 6 discs. The episode title and original airdates are listed; the episode descriptions are not.

I was most looking forward to the segment that features Donna Mills as a crazed woman who put her baby up for adoption, and now will go to any lengths--even murder--to get that baby back. The guest stars this season read like a who's-who of Hollywood from the '50s to the '80s including Ida Lupino, Sam Elliott, Erik Estrada, Diane Baker, James Darren, Joan Collins, Joanna Pettet, Gerald McRaney, Amy Irving, Jeannette Nolan and plenty more! The guest stars are the gravy but Angie Dickinson, who's effortless sexuality oozes out of the screen and reliable Earl Holliman are of course the meat-and-potatoes of the show.

Sometimes gritty, sometimes campy '70s fun (thanks to Pepper's wigs, massive hoop earrings and bell-bottom hip-huggers), ""Police Woman"" is long overdue on DVD and won't likely be shown on a cable network near you anytime soon. Buy it so we get Seasons 3 and 4 quickly after!",1320796800,48,1972,4.8982035928143715
3852561,5,B00266PDZI,"I will speak for many and say that this is great news!  At long last the second season of Police Woman becomes a reality!  I hope that this means that future seasons will not be long behind.  I also hope that there are extras on this like the season one set, like star commentary and interviews and the like.  If not, then there is always season three to add these to as well.  I have pre-ordered mine, and look forward to the usual high quality Shout Factory releases!",1320796800,20,469,4.284090909090909

3852563,5,B00266PDZI,"Why has Sony Pictures Television not released other than the first season Police Woman (Angie Dickenson) DVD's?

Sony Picturres url:  [...]

I agree with other review comments;  the first season episodes (23) are great with a lot of star characters.

I am wondering if the 2nd - 4th season episodes are available from Internet video sellers -- maybe old VCR recordings?  I have not seen any for sale anywhere.",1318723200,4,409,4.855072463768116
3852564,5,B00266PDZI,"I would love to review this item, but since it hasn't been released I'm unable to do so.  I'm getting to the point where I'm no longer going to buy the first season of anything until the second season has been released.  I've waited 6 years for another season of Police Woman, about 4 years for the third season of Hart to Hart and Cagney and Lacey....it really stinks.

Alot of what's on TV today does not appeal to me, so I create my own TV line ups with these videos...gets me through the long winter months.

I know Amazon is just the retailer here and is in no position to have these released, however, I do thank them for allowing me to voice my frustration out to the great unknown.",1316131200,10,689,4.236641221374046

Angie Dickenson proves to be one of the most sexiest women alive. Also, each episode is loaded with guest stars of a by gone era. You can't tell me Season 1 hasn't sold well.

3852578,5,B00266PDZI,"I love this series!  Angie Dickinson & Earl Holliman are the best! I wish The Shout Factory would release the rest of it, but according to their comment in the discussion section for season 2, they don't have any plans to release the rest.  Everyone who is interested should leave a comment asking them to release the final two seasons & also make this suggestion on their contact page under their suggested titles section.

I would also suggest contacting VEI Entertainment and suggesting Police Woman to them.  They have saved several series from release hell like Cagney & Lacey.  Maybe with some encouragement, they would be willing to pick up where Shout Factory left off, if Shout Factory will let them.",1477612800,6,709,4.8264462809917354

3852600,4,B00266PDZI,"Lavishly produced with lots of outdoor location shots and a liberal dose of car chases conducted in that style particular to the 70s, Police Woman is a crime drama which manages to entertain with a wink to the audience. While the plots and writing generally are unevenly matched with the heavy artillery calibre of talent which seems to crop up on nearly every episode (including, for example, such heavy hitting 70s guest starts such as the inimitable Robert Vaughn and the sexy Paula Kelly), things improve as the season progresses. The last few episodes of the season are distinguished by non-stop gripping story lines, suggesting a mid-season change in the writing team. Also noticeable toward the end of season 2 are wide angle shots comparable to those used on the big screen. Very fitting for a show with Angie Dickinson as its lead. These last episodes have left me pining for Season 3 which promises to be spectacular!",1409356800,6,927,4.8734177215189876

3852608,5,B00266PDZI,"Police Woman is better than Police Story, from which it originated.  What makes it work is the team of four undercover cops working together.  Police Story was way ahead of its time, hard hitting and often unpleasant to watch.  Too often the good guys get killed on Police Story whereas with Police Woman its almost always the bad guys who get killed.  as it should be.  I hope they will release all the other seasons soon.",1364342400,4,423,4.5131578947368425
3852609,5,B00266PDZI,"Police woman second season.
Angie Dickinson had to be at least 43 at the time yet what can you say
there had been a great cast supporting old Angie, a zimmer frame and a
flashing red light was the only thing she really needed, just joking of
course, it ran for four seasons and by the time the show went into
retirement so did the cast, ha ha ha, no, no, just me kidding again
there lovely, bad acting makes the show skip along with the odd body
bag ready there for the villains and scoundrels.",1338422400,2,494,4.15625

3852611,5,B00266PDZI,"Finally,the second season comes to DVD thanks to Shout Factory.
I believe this is the first series to have a policewoman as the lead character. Angie Dickinson was expertly cast as Pepper Anderson,the Policewoman of the series. She has excellent support from Earl Holliman as her superior Bill Crowley. The two gel perfectly, as do their sidekicks Charles Dierkop and Ed Bernard.
This series I believe is a spin-off of another series called ""Police Story""which I have bought, but haven't seen yet.
This is a hard gritty cop show from the seventies with plenty of action. A series that they don't do anymore. Unlike the heroines of today that seem more like  comic book super-heroes with their kung-fu kicks and anything else that whips the bad guys butts,this heroine is more realistic that needs the help of her colleagues when she sometimes gets into trouble.
This is a good series that I thoroughly enjoyed watching.",1331683200,5,919,4.929032258064516
3852612,5,B00266PDZI,"Thanks to Shout Factory for rescuing Angie Dickinson's POLICE WOMAN series after the first season didn't sell enough copies in 2006 for Sony to continue releasing the remaining three seasons. While the first season had numerous (and wonderfully funny) commentaries by Dickinson and co-star Earl Holliman, the second season only has one extra--a preview of the upcoming episode just prior to the opening credits of each episode.

This is a surprisingly violent and sexy police show. Yes, there are some camp aspects of costumes (where does Pepper hide her transmitter when she goes undercover in such skimpy outfits?) and situations but for the most part, POLICE WOMAN boasts smart, fast-moving scripts (with funny banter between the show's regulars), assured direction and a great guest cast.

3852613,5,B00266PDZI,"Received my Police Woman season 2 Dvd and love it!  This was my favorite show of all time and was thrilled to finally have season 2 released.  If you love the 70's cop dramas, believe me, you will not be disappointed.  Angie Dickinson and Earl Holliman exude the chemistry that made this show such a hit  ....  even after 30+ years!

This show is just a crazy sweet mix of thundering action, daring psychology, and gorgeous sex appeal. This season two release was far too long in coming (5+ years), but thank goodness its finally out. It picks up right where season one left off, that is, fast and crazy. Pop it in the DVD player.

3852615,5,B00266PDZI,"Wow. Have the first season. Had the thrill of my life last week seeing Angie at a film noir fest in San Fran. being interviewed. They screened 'The Killers and Point Blank' with Marvin and Casavetes. At 80, Angie has class, style, clear headed humor directed towards herself and descreetly towards others intermixed with a humble descency. This classy actress has not let her accomplishments go to her head. I remembered why I worshiped her like the Goddess she is. Looking forward to the 2nd season and hoping they don't take as long with 3 and 4. Nothing like a diet of high school comfort food served up in quality DVDs.",1327795200,10,623,4.621621621621622

8352182,5,B00266PDZI,"Those who are familiar with this show will probably already own this, but then again there is a good chance they wouldn't be reading reviews anyway, so if you are on the fence about buying Season 2 of Police Woman, come down off of that fence and slam dunk a copy of this DVD Set into your shopping cart while you're at it.

Why? Because you won't regret it, that's why. Angie Dickinson plays Pepper Anderson (and she's a Sergeant; was there a veiled Beatles reference here?) and she don't take no goofing around, well, maybe a little bit, she DOES have a sense of humor, but when it comes down to business, you best not take her for granted, you criminal you.

No I didn't mean YOU, I meant...oh never mind, maybe Pepper should lock me up for an attempt to write a review that wasn't entertaining enough for people to keep reading. I surrender, Sgt. Anderson, I'll go quietly, I've seen the show, I know how it works...

How many people are still reading raise their hands. One? Okay, if you are that one person who is a fan of drive-in movie legend Don Stroud, he is in TWO whole episodes here, so do the guest villain dance if you please. He plays a Bonnie & Clyde-worshipping bank robber, and an evil biker, too. Both performances are over-the-top in that way we've come to expect from Mr. Stroud, so I do believe you, like I, will not be disappointed in what you see.",1508803200,,1372,4.372549019607843
8352183,4,B00266PDZI,"The first season was terrific, well-produced, and they let Angie be Angie, and the show even hit #1 for the week a few times... But, as the result of politics ('70s feminists who found Angie too sexy and therefore ""degrading to real police women,"" and producers mad at their star because she'd refused to drive an 18-wheeler -- ""and they never forgave me,"" Dickinson admitted many years later) Angie's charisma is flipped off like a light switch by the middle of Season 2, leaving her in a kind of neurotic no man's land about how to play a scene. The sensuous, tough lady cop from the first season has really been de-ovaried as you get further into the sophomore year of POLICE WOMAN, and the show struggles to stay focused as a result; she increasingly feels like a supporting player in her own show. In fact, in THE CHASERS with Ian McShane and Ida Lupino as insurance scammers, Pepper gets caught up in half a dozen action fight scenes, and she fumbles ALL of them!... There are some good episodes, especially earlier in the season: PAWNS OF POWER with Roddy McDowall and Robert Goulet is solid, the show still confident; THE SCORE with Michael Constantine as a drug pusher is a decent entry, too; PARADISE MALL with a very young Bruce Boxleitner is a good, creepy serial killer story, although it seems to wimp out in the final scene; PATTERN FOR EVIL with terror in the fashion industry is strong; and COLD WIND about a mysterious, nighttime double murder at a soda factory is quite moody and effective; SILENCE with Joanna Pettet as a mute looking for her dead sister has an excellent Poe-like quality; and BLAZE OF GLORY with undercover Pepper picked up by a trio of redneck bank robbers who then drive her into the desert is great fun; we see a youthful Sam Elliot in FAREWELL MARY JANE about drug-running in the badlands; and Erik Estrada is robbing the bank accounts of little old ladies in DON'T FEED THE PIGEONS.... These were the better episodes, but by mid-Season 2 there's a draining of energy, and a lot of episodes just sit there lazily -- or, worse, rip off from the previous season (as in GENERATION OF EVIL where Pepper goes under as a dancer with a crooked boss played by Robert Vaughn, a weak replay of BLAST from S1 where Pepper goes under as a dancer with a crooked boss played by Robert Vaughn). Season 2 ends well with entries like DOUBLE IMAGE with Catherine Burns; and TASK FORCE, Parts 1 & 2, about a cycle cops chasing after a biker gang run by a Manson-like leader... And yet there is the constant feeling of the show holding back, or holding Angie back, through out Season 2... Not only that, but the producers couldn't decide if they wanted to use a new, funkadelicious orchestration of the theme music (used only in PARADISE MALL and COLD WIND, and removed from DVD for THE CHASERS) and then unwisely dropped it as they returned to the S1 version for the remainder of S2... Plus, the Season 2 DVD has a lousy cover art pic... Such potential, but so exasperating!",1505260800,6,2997,4.562152133580705
