8642785,5,B00IK0UZKW,"A truly playful film, it seems like what you might get if Godard had ever made a sweet romantic comedy.  Full of oddball characters, oddball situations and oddball cinematic devices, it somehow feels coherent, interesting and fun, and not sophomoric.

Betbeder plays with narrative, often having his characters directly address the camera, narrating their own lives in deadpan minutia.  Mostly its about love, specifically 33 year old Arman finding the love of his life (maybe) in Amelie  whom he gets to know after being stabbed trying to protect her during an attempted mugging.  Meanwhile his buddy Benjamin, who is recovering from a stroke, falls for his speech therapist.

That all sounds grim, but its just the opposite.  Made up of 40 short pieces strung together with funny titles, the film is witty and clever, and all 4 lead actors are charming and endearing.  That word endearing could also describe the film -- as unlikely a word as that is for a film so experimental and self-consciously weird.

Im sure this won't be everyones cup of tea, but for someone like me who has seen the same old rom-coms for 50 years, seeing a film-maker fearlessly deconstruct and reconstruct the genre is as much fun as it must have been to see those French new wave film-makers tear down all the rules 50 years ago.",1452297600,,1309,4.808035714285714
8642786,2,B00IK0UZKW,"Foreign films have become my guilty pleasure, but this one missed the mark. I never did understand the point of the whole film. It was filmed in a part documentary style, with the characters giving interviews, and the remained in a dramatic fashion (if that is how one would describe it). I can't believe that I wasted a full 2 hours waiting for something to happen.",1431216000,,366,4.5606060606060606
8642787,5,B00IK0UZKW,"I watch a great deal of film fest films and particularly foreign films. This one was sweet. I will need to watch it again, I know...but I do remember that I enjoyed it.",1426636800,,168,4.121212121212121
8642788,4,B00IK0UZKW,"A very nice film! What I found most lovable, as in other French romantic comedies, is how the filmmaker took well-worn clichs of the genre and presented them in a new way, making them fresh and enjoyable. I also loved the films lightness and how it doesnt seem to take itself too seriously. If you are in the mood for an unconventional, light and tender romantic comedy this is highly recommended!",1405296000,,397,4.605633802816901
8642789,3,B00IK0UZKW,"2 Autumns, 3 Winters is from French director Sbastien Betbeder.

 Thirty something Arman literally bumps into Amelie while out jogging. He contrives to run into her again and eventually does. Arman's best friend Benjamin suffers a stroke and while recuperating, makes a connection with his physical therapist.

 Those are the players. And the rest of the film is a series of vignettes and ruminations from the characters on life, love, moments and memories.

 Some of the film is shot so it appears as though a hand held camera was used. I dislike this style - I find the movement jarring and hard to watch.  The addition of labelled chapters also added to the 'homemade' feel.

 In much of the film, the actors are speaking directly to the viewer. (And sometimes when they are in a scene with another actor) Although you would think this would provide an intimate relationship between actor and viewer, for me it didn't. Initially I was interested in the four, learning of their lives and wondering what would happen over the course of the film. But as the film progressed,  I found myself becoming tired and frankly somewhat bored with the almost repetitiveness of their ruminations.

 From the director: ""I wanted the narrative to be dense, to alternate between serious, critical moments in the lives of these young people, and more incidental moments that have no real impact. I wanted to talk about death and shopping at the grocery store, about love and reality TV.""

 Initially I connected with the main character Arman (Vincent Macaigne). His attempts to meet Amelie (Maud Wyler) were engaging. And I liked him at the end of the film. But in between, he seemed to almost overact. And I know this is petty, but I found myself tuning out and instead his hair became my focus, instead of his lines. He's always flipping it back, it's dirty and greasy and growing it long and doing a comb over does not hide the large bald spot at the back.

 There are many film references that will be noted by avid film buffs. Through my own lacking, I was unable to appreciate many of these homages.

 2 Autumns, 3 Winters was just too 'arty' for this viewer. However, the bonus short film, Business Trip, that Film Movement always includes was just excellent.",1404432000,,2251,4.74293059125964
8642790,4,B00IK0UZKW,"Writer/director S&eacute;bastien Betbeder Feels more like a film and a story - if that makes sense. It is the type of film you need to be in the mood to see - a rather extended, and at times tedious, conversation between actors and camera that works for a while and then becomes a distraction. But as with the French, even when bouquet isn't entirely fresh it still has charm.

As fate would have it the bored and distracted early thirties Arman (Vincent Macaigne) inadvertently bumps into Am&eacute;lie (Maud Wyler) - pretty but not exactly pleased with her life or life in general - while taking a healthy jog in the park. Up pops a problem: Arman's best friend Benjamin (Bastien Bouillon) has a cerebrovascular accident and is hospitalized, impaired but still with eyes for his physical therapist.  The stage is then set for an ongoing exchange of life stories, accidents, memories (good and bad) among the three main characters. It is a stage for some philosophical comments - some poignant, others plebeian. And that is all there is to it - a conversation a trois.

Despite the fact that there isn't a lot of substance, there is still that Gallic charm that makes up for many flaws. Grady Harp, June 14",1403136000,2,1207,4.710900473933649
8642791,3,B00IK0UZKW,"We saw '2 Autumns, 3 Winters' as part of the excellent Film Movement series.  It's a winning little film that succeeds despite itself.  It feels at times like a parody of a French film: characters talking directly to the camera, baring their feelings (typically, deeply introspective); depression and ennui; perennial art students who appear to be underemployed well into adulthood.

However, writer/director Sbastien Betbeder ultimately triumphs: he keeps the length of this work to 'feels right' 91 minutes and delivers some likable characters.  Vincent Macaigne ('Arman') is an unlikely leading man, but he grows on you.  By the end of the film, you're rooting for him.",1402963200,,672,5.30188679245283
8642792,5,B00IK0UZKW,"This has been called `quirky' which is normally a cop-out phrase for not quite being able to categorise a film. I think highly original would be a lot better. We meet Arman - Vincent Macaigne- who hits 33 with a bang and so decides to start taking life seriously which will include packing up the Gauloises and going jogging in the park. Whilst doing the running he runs into Amelie (Maud Wyler - `Blue is the warmest colour') and he knows that something special will happen. He also has a best mate in Benjamin played by the really nice Bastien Bouillon who suffers a stroke at the age of thirty.

What happens then is we are taken on a linear but sometimes quite random series of events from 2009 to 2012. There is a lot of addressing direct to the camera and often this is done to explain both sides of a situation. The film is told in chapters too which helps to show the significance of each segment. Director Sebastien Betbeder uses these techniques as a way to develop more intimacy with the viewer and the characters and I have to say it works beautifully. I was hooked by about seven minutes in and wanted to know more about all the characters. I particularly liked the way all the actors are relatively unknown and Vincent Macaigne has a Gerrard Depardieu screen presence that made him immediately engaging.  Bastien Bouillon is effortlessly good looking and so extremely nice that you just want to take him out for a pint (that would probably be half a litre being Paris I suppose). Maud Wyler is both asserting and vulnerable and comes across as totally convincing despite some challenging twists in the story.

This was made up from real life experiences of Sebastien Betbeder and it is clear a lot of love has gone into it. It also features a cracking sound track that one you could easily miss as the narrative carries you along- look out for `Le Chasseur' by Michel Delpeche - I had never heard of him so downloaded the track straight away - c'est magnifique! You can probably tell by now that I completely loved this film. Yes it is quirky, it is funny in places, it is about real lives told simply and is one of those films that will stay with you for a while after seeing it - in a very good way. I got this from Film Movement as a review piece and it also contains a short film by the same director - `Voyages D'Affaires'. An excellent addition to anyone's collection - absolutely recommended.",1402790400,2,2413,4.4795454545454545
8642793,4,B00IK0UZKW,"This French film with English subtitles begins in a stereotypical romantic comedy way, with two of the protagonists literally running into each other in a park.  Arman is 33 and drifting aimlessly.  Amelie is 27, driven and more than a little cynical.  After their meeting their lives seem to twist and turn, eventually leading to another meeting and a relationship.  Tied in with the main story are other characters, including Arman's friend Benjamin and his own  love interest.  In an American romantic comedy that would have been pretty much it, but there are some deeper levels here.

The story plays out from 2009 to early 2012. In stereotypical French film fashion the characters indulge in a great deal of introspection, speaking directly to the camera about their perceptions. I'm not fluent in French and had to rely on the subtitles, so some of the subtleties and ironies were undoubtedly lost on me, however I did find the characters appealing and the story interesting.  Additionally, there are some nice scenes set in Paris and in the Alps which were very lovely.",1401235200,,1076,4.938888888888889
8642794,4,B00IK0UZKW,"""2 Autumns, 3 Winters"" (2013 release from France; 91 min.) brings the story of Arman (played by Vincent Macaigne), a 30-something man who is drifting through life, unsure of what he will do. Then one day, while jogging in the park, he (literally) bumps into Amelie (played by Maud Wyler), who's in her late 20s and in a less than great relationship. After an awkward exchange, Arman is sure that ""she's the one"" and tries to run into her again, but to no avail. In a parallel story line, we get to know Benjamin (played by Bastien Bouillon), a longtime friend of Arman. One day, Benjamin suffers a stroke and during his recovery he gets to know Katia (played by Audrey Bastien), his speech therapist. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is a conversation-driven relationship movie, in which there's (in case there was any doubt) lots of talking. Yet it is done in a slightly off-center manner. The main characters talk to each other and also into the camera on-and-off, as if to provide commentary to their own lives. Second, the movie is divided into two parts, with each having about 20 'subchapters', many of which last barely a minute. Third, there are a couple of nice music references in the movie. It had been years, decades really, that I had been reminded of Michel Delpech, the French singer who had great success in the 1970s. And then there is the placement of Fleet Foxes' ""Tiger Mountain Peasant Song"", from their stellar debut album some years ago. What a gorgeous (and romantic) song that still is. Last but not least, in this type of movie, you had better have engaging acting performances, and on that level the movie certain delivers. I was not familiar with any of the lead actors, but they delivered a nice ensemble performance. In all, this feels like a quirky little movie, which I quite enjoyed for what it was, and it flew by in no time.

This movie was the January, 2014 release in the on-going series of Film Movement's DVD-of-the-Month Club of foreign and indie movies, and it will be released to the public at large in June, 2014. As usual, the DVD comes with a number of bonus materials, including a nice shortie, ""Voyage d'Affaires"" (""Business Trip"", 2013 release from France; 11 min.), also worth checking out.",1393891200,,2352,4.678743961352657
