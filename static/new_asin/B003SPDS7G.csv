4189372,5,B003SPDS7G,Being a fan of the original Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z series I thought GT just as great as it's predecessors. GT had the feel of the original Dragon Ball series to start and incorporates a good mix of playfull with the action packed fighting of the Z series.,1288051200,15,262,4.26
4189373,3,B003SPDS7G,both the previous releases that funimation put out currently cost less to buy together than this set so don't waste the money on this one. but as for the series its a decent series definatly good if your a big dragonball fan but for non fans its alright. the first couple discs are really boring with tons of slapstick humor and weak oppenents but once baby arrives on the scene (and they finally find all the dragonballs spread across the galaxy) the series gets pretty good with its fair share of great fights (it may just be worth it for super saiyen 4 its awesome) anyone who needs more dragonball after z buy this series but if your not a fan its a decent series but you would not be missing anything special by passing on the series,1286236800,10,738,4.355072463768116
4189374,5,B003SPDS7G,"I personally own the 2 season sets, but this is the same thing. I think it's a nice little spin off type of series for us Dragonball fans. Pick it up now, I remember spending $15 a tape to get these as they came out on VHS years ago.. buying 21 tapes in all. Now everything, for $40? You guys got it so lucky. =]",1285632000,,312,3.8153846153846156
4189375,4,B003SPDS7G,"This DVD Box contains the two already released Dragon Ball GT season sets stuck together, that is all. There is nothing new except the front and back cover. If you don't already have GT then buy this, if you do then don't bother. Here's hoping that FUNimation releases the GT Dragon Boxes next.

As for the series, GT is a great adventure story. With a fun story at first, and then awesome action at the end. You will definitely enjoy it!",1284595200,72,438,4.407407407407407
4189376,1,B003SPDS7G,"This is a complete rip off, you're better off spending an extra $100 and getting a truly remastered product, dragon book, and the dragon box.
If you support the Japanese version DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!

It's interlaced and looks quite bad when compared to the Dragon Box!",1283040000,5,272,4.666666666666667
4189377,2,B003SPDS7G,"In my honest opinion the seriers was really boring until around disc 3 and 4 of season one but after that the action picked up. But I did spend a lot of time fastforwarding through the boring parts and juss waiting for those epic fight scenes that made the series worth watching. There were only 2 parts to the whole series that actually excited me and that was the baby saga towards the end and the evil shenron dragon series toward the end. It had the built up suspense that the cell saga and buu saga had but I could have really done without pan, she was very talkative, arrogant, and over confident to say the least for a meer human compared to vegeta and goku. If pan would have been less of the focus it might have made a better watch. Overall its an okay series just because I got to see saiyan 4..but outside of that it was not as interesting to watch. Cell, buu, and frieza were enemies with style and constant changes that made the suspense build as opposed to a parasite and a dragon/parasite.",1282003200,7,1004,4.317460317460317
4189378,1,B003SPDS7G,"Did not include the booklets you normally get with the series.

Every other dragon ball series i had bought included it.

Outside of that disk and delivery time very good.",1519257600,,171,4.666666666666667
4189379,5,B003SPDS7G,"Unlike other reviews, mines came in perfect condition. I never watched gt and wanted to check it out and im loving the show so far.",1517961600,,131,4.28
4189380,5,B003SPDS7G,"This DVD box set is great. It has all 64 episodes of DBGT including a movie. The box set itself is packaged nicely with a slip cover. Every episode is uncut too, so we don't miss anything that was originally censored. What's also great is how the episodes are presented in a 4:3 aspect ratio, which shows the entire frame of animation. The DBZ orange brick box sets were cropped to a 16:9 widescreen aspect ratio, which cut off a lot of the picture. Props to Funimation for not making the same mistake again. The remastered and restored picture is clean and beautiful as well.

Now onto the show. For some reason, DBGT wasn't liked by many fans of DBZ. I think most people were expecting something as amazing as DBZ and were disappointed. I'm apart of the group that actually enjoyed DBGT. The story wasn't written by Akira Toriyama, but it's still fun and interesting. Goku, Pan, and Trunks have to travel across space to distant planets in order to find the Dragon Balls and save the Earth. It's a grand adventure that reminded me of Dragon Ball. The music of DBGT is also worth mentioning. I recommend watching it with the Japanese soundtrack. The melodies in it are simply wonderful. As for the included movie, A Hero's Legacy, it's also great. It's an emotional movie about Pan's grandson, Goku Jr., finding his true potential as a warrior.

Overall, this box set is a perfect buy for any DBGT and DBZ fan. I highly recommend getting it!",1517529600,,1442,4.5852713178294575

4189382,5,B003SPDS7G,"This show is not on par with Dragon Ball or Dragon Ball Z, which it tried so hard to emulate, but it has its moments that make it worth the journey. You can't say it lacks originality because despite being reminiscent of its predecessors, it took the franchise in a new direction with a handful of new concepts that on paper are quite interesting and the fandom wholeheartedly accept, but the execution was off. That doesn't mean it was unwatchable, it was just obvious what they could have done differently. The concept behind Baby's character, the shadow dragons and the dragon balls' negative energy and yes, Super Saiyan 4, are highlights that define this short series. The ending though, was the perfect tear-jerking sendoff to Dragon Ball that even DBZ never gave us. I'm content with this being the series' finale and Dragon Ball Super being something to just ignore. Though that's just my opinion and an argument for another day.",1517184000,7,937,4.826086956521739

I was somewhat disappointed with this series since it didn't include a handbook like all the other seasons have from other collections that are similar in style to this one. It is also kind of annoying that both DVDs fit into the same cardboard sleeve. Overall I'm happy with the product, and happy to add it to my dragon ball collection. Also at the price this collection is a steal!",1512691200,,453,4.341176470588235
4189393,3,B003SPDS7G,"What can I say that hasn't already been said about GT? At first I was actually excited when Goku was turned back into a kid in the beginning. I've always preferred DB to DBZ. Kid Goku has always been one of my favorite characters (I think adult Goku kinda goes down hill after the Freiza saga). Unfortunately, it was not the same Goku I remember. They clearly didn't know how to write for him, or maybe the DB universe has just changed too much for his charm to be captured again. They treated him like adult Goku, but made him a bit dumber and had him constantly complain about being hungry.

If you can make it through the first 2/3's of the series, which is mostly Goku, Pan, and Trunks looking for Dragonballs on other planets and the Baby saga, you get to see the brief Super 17 saga and then the evil dragons. The dragons were the best part, but even that was kind of lame. Maybe it just seemed better compared to the priors sections.

Luckily, thanks to DB Super, it seems like GT is being glossed over as canon. I'd only advise watching this if you need to see everything DB related. Otherwise, you can skip over it without missing much.

Pan, Baby, Super 17, evil dragons, SS4. There. That's what you missed.",1507852800,2,1217,4.376106194690266

4189398,4,B003SPDS7G,Finally got my hands on this box set.

4189405,5,B003SPDS7G,"I was hoping it was the case, and sure enough, this box set is of the uncut versions of the anime.  There are options for listening in English, but you can set it up (via the on-disc 'Audio Settings') to listen to the original Japanese dialogue/audio as well as opening and closing songs.

I much prefer the original Japanese audio as it and the English subtitles can be quite different from the English dubbed versions.  The audio of the English dubbed verisons sometimes changed the mood/intent of a particular scene.

Visually, the video is quite good; albeit of course only DVD quality.  Colors are nice and vibrant.

Highly recommended for any fan of the series that would like to experience it in its original intent.",1494115200,,723,4.744

4189420,5,B003SPDS7G,"People are saying this collection doesn't contain the lost episodes, but the lost episodes was just done in the original American release to cut out the more polarizing episodes of the series for Z fans. The original Japanese tv airing had 64 episodes. This dvd release has 64 episodes, 7 on each disc. It also has a english dub of the Japanese theme in case you weren't a fan of the original US theme, which is great.

4189422,4,B003SPDS7G,"I grew up with this Anime specifically as a child; so this is really about the quality of the DVD.

Its not great. I'm getting line/tears on movement, usually an effect of converting a VHS to DVD improperly.
I can tell they didn't care all that much in the quality of this box set as much as the Dragon Ball Z box set I already have.
I've watched Bootlegs at 720p HD and without these static lines.

But other than that it's nice they at least DID create a DVD box set for this. Because you know, this Anime is apparently worse than Hitler because ""plot-holes"" even though Z had way more plot holes, and its Dragon Ball: there are aliens, dinosaurs, golden monkey warriors; you can suspend your disbelief pretty easily if you enjoy this series anyway.",1469664000,2,751,4.434782608695652

4189438,4,B003SPDS7G,"Definitely not as bad as you remember, but of course, not as good as it's previous series's.  It tries to harken back to original Dragon Ball for the first three discs, and it does successfully for the most part [not without taking away all of your respect for Trunk's character].  If you want to get to the meat, I recommend skipping to disc 4, where Baby saga starts off.  Baby saga is on par with an actual Dragon Ball Z saga [definitely better than any filler arcs like Garlic Jr.], but the latter two sagas [Super 17 & Omega Shenron] leave something to be desired.  It presents some likable characters and scenarios [and some really, really unlikable characters and scenarios], good action, and good voice acting [when the voice actors were given good direction].  With the knowledge that this is no longer canon, I feel any fan could enjoy the large part of this as much as any of the middling Dragon Ball films.  Definitely worth powering through once or twice.",1451779200,4,968,4.631578947368421

4189459,3,B003SPDS7G,"a horrible, horrible travesty to an otherwise amazing series. not only to they throw the DB color scheme out the window they change the character personalities drastically, for example goku is a/an (insert insulting curse word), u get my picture. while the story could have been brilliant it is instead almost total goofyness. the replace bulma with a much more annoying pan(worse than chi-chi) that being said, it does have some great fight scenes and super saiyan 5 is awesome. also my opinion is based off of a comparison the the original two cannon series",1438905600,,559,4.894736842105263

4189464,4,B003SPDS7G,"I am a huge DBZ fan that never got around to watching GT. With super coming out (even though GT isn't considered canon) I figured now is the time. For the price I think this is a great set. The case is a wimpy paper sleeve that holds two more sturdy cases inside, one for each season.

The main reason I gave it a 4 star instead of 5 is the subtitles. I have to use subtitles sometimes to avoid waking my toddler and the subtitles do not correspond with the voices. They follow each other similarly, but sometimes the sub titles have Goku talking about the bad guy and the voice over is talking about how he is hungry. I guess if you watch with no sound or no subtitles you would never know, it just got me thinking ""What was ACTUALLY supposed to be said right here?""",1437436800,,767,4.147651006711409

Dragonball GT has to be my favorite spin off of Dragonball.
Season one, Goku finishes training with Uub and becomes a small child again due to the black starred dragon balls. Goku, Trunks, and Pan (Gokus granddaughter) have to travel the galaxy to find the balls. They run into some troubles though, Baby. Baby is a tuffel seeking revenge on the saiyans for destroying his ancestors planet.
Season two picks up with Goku becoming a SS4 and whooping some ass.
Then Goku, Trunks, and Pan have to defeat the the shenrons and super android 17.
This also comes with the Dragonball GT movie which is about Goku Jr.

All in all, Dragonball GT the complete series is so worth every penny.",1435449600,,703,4.579365079365079

Granted some arcs take ideas from Z (like Dr. Myuu being almost exactly like Dr. Gero and the androids). Anyway, excellent viewing and a definite must-buy.",1426377600,2,435,4.589743589743589

It is a good deal right now at around 30 something bucks and really you can't beat that deal.  There is so much content for that amount of cash that I really would have been willing to buy it for 50 if I knew how much I would enjoy it before buying it.

When I finally got through the plastic that wrapped the box collection, I found that one of the latches on the DVD holders was broken and the DVD that was supposed to be in its place and I assume the DVD was basically sliding freely while it was being shipped.  Luckily there was no damage on the disk, itself.  But still the dvd holder doesnt hold the disk.

Besides that, I had watched all of the series over a weekend and found no damage to any of the merchandise.  ""A Hero's Legacy"" short movie, featuring Goku's great great grandchild was also included on the final DVD disk of the collection.",1393286400,,774,4.453900709219858

4189564,3,B003SPDS7G,"The only two good things to come out of GT:
1. Super Saiyan 4
2. The Idea of the negative energy creating shadow dragons

Other than that, GT isn't very special. The creator of Dragon Ball and Z insists GT is not canon for obvious reasons. The fight with Baby, the fact that the Super 17 saga was 2 episodes, some of the ridiculous plots. GT is not as good, in fact not NEAR as good, as Z or Dragon Ball.",1392508800,,404,3.9876543209876543

4189569,2,B003SPDS7G,"I've been a fan of the dragon ball series since I was 6th grade, but this wasn't what I was hoping for. I've watch all the Dragon Ball / Z series and movies, so it's not that I'm close minded. My older brother really wanted to see these since we had never seen them. Told him I really didn't want to since the series creator had no part in creating GT series but I did want to see what happened with Uub and Goku.  Anyways, we are already in the 2nd season but this is just hard to watch. They skip large sections of the story; after they kill Baby and the Earth blows up and Piccolo dies the narrator says just says they wished Earth back with the regular dragon balls. When they first set out to find the black dragon balls, Goku, Goten and Trunks are supposed to go look for them, next thing you know Pan is on the ship and Goten is nowhere to be seen, about 20 minutes later it finally says that Pan accidentally set launching sequence while she, Goku and Trunks were on the ship but Goten wasn't. It was almost like the writers forgot to say what happened and in a hurry just put some bullcrap story to fix their mistake.
The world tournament episodes are only one episode each.
The show does have some very funny parts, kinda like the original series and some of the fights are worth watching.  But most of this series is worth skipping, you won't get satisfaction from finishing this, they should have let it end at the end of Z. This is only 68 episodes, so they also knew it wasn't  worth creating.  I won't consider this to be a part of the Greatest Series of All-time,  Dragon Ball / Z.",1389744000,5,1597,4.205882352941177

4189575,3,B003SPDS7G,"I was thrilled to receive this DVD set in the mail. When I went to watch it I was heavily disappointed that even if you select ""US Broadcast Version"", the American DBGT rap theme is gone and in it's place is a Japanese song I've never heard. I'm not trying to be judgmental to the original Japanese opening, it's just that I had grown quite fond of the US version when I viewed it in my youth. Sad day... :(",1388534400,2,407,4.1

4189580,4,B003SPDS7G,Great set to buy if you collect all the Dragon Ball series and just want to buy it to complete the set. Contains the GT movies as well so you don't need to go looking for them separately.,1384300800,,187,3.9473684210526314
4189581,4,B003SPDS7G,"I thought this set was great, the only criticism I would have would be that there is no special features I would have liked to have some extra stuff just to see the behind the scenes process that went into the storyline.  But this does gives you the complete GT which is great in itself, once you get past the Baby saga that is.

Update: Okay I bought this for 25 dollars from Best Buy when I first bought this I am seeing Amazon selling it for like 45, really disappointing Amazon...super disappointing",1383177600,,503,4.397849462365591

4189590,5,B003SPDS7G,"This series was perfect.  From start to finish it had action. I had to hold myself to only watching a few episodes a day so I can enjoy it for a while.  The action was excellent and had so many scenes of it. Every scene was jam packed with it.  Now the story was so epic.  There was literally some times where I was screaming at the TV saying ""NO Goku just attack! Stop goofing!"" I loved King Kai! The story had me so involved I thought I was holding the camera there. The voices were crisp and fit the characters.  The music was perfect and flowed with the combat.

I 100% recommend this to all Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z watchers and if you finished all 9 seasons you need to end with this.  GT was like 9 Sagas in 2 seasons. There was only one thing...I think I cried lol when i finished the last episode. I was like is this seriously over? That's how good it was.  Get this Series and I know you won't regret it.",1374192000,3,919,4.038674033149171

Though this show isn't done by the original artist, Akira Toriyama, and is considered to be what fans call a filler, it still adds depth to the DB universe. As a dragonball fan I like it for it's rich in story, great battles, and one last chance to see Goku, Vegeta, and the rest of my fav characters. if your a fan of DGZ and you want to be entertain again then I say buy it.",1339459200,,553,4.08256880733945

4189634,3,B003SPDS7G,"contains spoilers.

when i watched dragonball GT, i felt that it was alot different than DBZ. the major things i noticed first were, Goku becomes the absolute main character and immediately surpasses everyone. in dragonball z, we see depth within every character. the strengths of both Goku and Vegeta are fairly matched throughout the series, however in GT, Goku becomes the absolute main power force.

another point that i didn't like much of GT was that, the sagas of GT seemed to lack depth and in my opinion seemed rushed. the main part that makes me say this is because ALL the fights seem rushed, in DBZ they show the saiyans and other fighters, fighting to there absolute limits and beyond. you can truely feel the amount of energy, and dedication they are putting out in the fight. in GT the fights are really quick and u don't feel much a sense of passion as you did in Z. GT had the potential, but it just could not deliver, i believe  if the entire show was dragged onto atleast 100+ episodes then the depth and values of the fights would be portrayed more.

Overall the series seems rushed and just doesnt seem to fit. Vegeta shouldve atleast reached SSJ3 by himself, the DBZ Vegeta wouldnt have had the pride and honor to cheat his way SSJ4. when Bulma said she could have the technology, i expected Vegeta to refuse in utter disgust at the mere fact that Bulma would even think of it.

The series would have been much better if Goku didn't surpass everyones strengths and levels as much as he did.",1314403200,7,1512,4.523809523809524
4189635,2,B003SPDS7G,Like 99% of anime this involved sexual situations. Why is it all anime involves naked underage girls? There was a piticular scene between Pan and Doltaki that was really disturbing. I liked DBZ but this was really dark and perverted.,1314144000,4,233,4.85
4189636,5,B003SPDS7G,"this is a great buy. the whole series on 9 discs and for such a reasonable price. i am very pleased and I would recommend this set to any who ever watched dragonball, dragonball z, or gt. its remastered and it includes the gt movie. awesome set!",1313884800,14,245,4.23404255319149

4189640,5,B003SPDS7G,"Though not written by Toriyama the action is still as good as ever. The story is a bit repetitive but not bad. The dub is as always good and the adventure of it is what helps redeem the series. There's also a surprising bit of humor including surprisingly from Vegeta which makes this series, in my opinion, worth watching",1309392000,,322,4.47457627118644
4189641,5,B003SPDS7G,"Ok people I know this isn't Dragon Ball or DBZ but it is pretty frickin good. The episodes are in good quality, the music is terrible but I don't care. It is in full screen and is not cropped. The sound is good. The reason I think this show may not have done well is because it is sometimes slow. What people want is fighting, action, excitement. Well in this show there is that, but there is a lot of story too. Of the course the plot is looking for dragon balls spread out in the galaxy and if they don't find them in a year the Earth will somehow explode. Emperor Pilaf finds the black star dragon balls and being stupid wastes his wish on Goku. Goku is suddenly changed back into a 10 year old. There is still a marathon mode for those of you that HATE the music like me and want to skip the openings. I think if you are on the verge with this show, and you are not sure what to do go ahead and get it. It still comes with the movie from season 2, well at least mine did. I absolutely think you will like this show.",1307318400,3,1019,3.975609756097561

4189643,3,B003SPDS7G,The only reason that I bought this is because I like Dragonball and Dragonball Z. GT is certainly not as good as its predecessors and for good reason. Mr. Toriyama was not involved in making it. The whole series simply thrives to survive off of the others and it is the least generally accepted of Dragonball series. I give it three stars only because I love the characters that Toriyama created.,1305072000,4,396,4.591549295774648

I must warn you though it's not as exciting at first just because they kind of went out there but bought it back to interesting by season two and to see this great cartoon come to it's end is almost tear jerking.. It's got a spiritual grip to it I can't explain it but yes it was sad to see it come to an end but one of the best cartoons I've ever followed even though it was over two decades ago when Dragon Ball hit the seen when it was originally made.. How cool is that? (to see a cartoon last this long and kids today just love it as though it was brand new.. Japanesse Anime Rocks big time..",1298160000,3,766,3.9166666666666665

4189647,5,B003SPDS7G,"Here's the bottom line. This series was not nearly as good as DBZ. How could it be? Mr. Toriyama didn't even create the story. Yet. If you, like the hundreds of thousands of others out there, have been captivated by any of the wonders of the Dragon Ball Universe, you need to purchase this set. Or at least, the two previous box sets. DBGT does not surpass it's predesescor by any means, but it is still a series that I classify as a 'must own'. If this wasn't a 'must own', I wouldn't be writing this review.
