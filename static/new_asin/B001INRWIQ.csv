8311206,4,B001INRWIQ,"After his somewhat misfire, war-supernatural thriller ""R-Point"", writer/director Kong Su-Chang seems poised to redeem himself with a second film that deals with military and horror elements. ""GP506"" (aka. The Guard Post) is a lot better than ""R-Point"" having a more coherent screenplay and certain spooky elements that is almost guaranteed to give the viewer chills and thrills--oh, this may well be the one of the bloodiest and goriest South Korean horror films I've seen in awhile.

Guard Posts are quite common in Korea--the DMZ area is indeed full of tension between the Northern and Southern army. In a small island where there is a demilitarized zone between the North and South Korean borders, a mystifying event with cataclysmic results seemingly left 20 soldiers dead with only one survivor--a comatose corporal Kang. Military officials want to get to the bottom of this mystery and dispatches Sgt. Major Noh (Cheon Ho-Jin) is sent to investigate and he has until morning to find  answers--Noh is under pressure since the son of their commanding officer is the head of the GP. A video tape is also found explaining Kang's intentions. The investigative group sets out to find the answers and send the bodies home but unfortunately, strong torrential rains causes a landslide and the team is trapped in the guard post. Now, Noh's group finds another survivor--in the person of Lt. Yoo (Hyeon Jae-Jo) who is obviously in shock. Noh is relieved that they found the head of the post alive but is he really who seems to be? The investigative team is about to uncover startling secrets which may prove deadly to all those involved...

I've read that director Kong spent some time in the South Korean military so he wanted to make films that express his observations and the way soldiers are pushed to the breaking point. Kong has said that even his diary is subject to continuous inspection by his military superiors and that mysterious things always happen within those army confines that defies simple explanation. At first impression, ""GP506"" feels like another ""R-Point"" redux but the film quickly abandons the idea as soon as you see its groundwork. The film is shot in an actual isolated location from the remnants of the cold war; the set designs are kept as realistic as possible and no women were cast--director Kong is said to have visited one of these posts and so he knows exactly what they look like.

What really grabbed my attention in the film is its unsettling and gloomy atmosphere. The film definitely looks very damp and dirty--moody and disquieting, the bunker has a lot of dark places where creepy shadows can lurk; this effect can give the viewer the creeps. Of course, atmosphere is all good in a horror film but it can only take you so far. The film's investigation sets in a nice screenplay, granted it isn't one without a few plot holes, (I found certain elements to require a suspension of disbelief) but the script is strong enough to keep the viewer interested. The mystery is slowly revealed through flashbacks and entries from a journal--I suppose the direction made a successful calculated risk in presenting some less delineated flashbacks that lacks clarity and leaves the audience wondering which flashback is a lie and which is the truth. All will revealed anyway, while the film's main premise of a virus isn't really that original, I liked the way it played on its strengths.

The virus itself is one interesting animal and is the one element that gives the film its dose of suspense. It's symptoms look like a ""doped up"" chickenpox but it is the way that it drives people to paranoia and violent behavior, up until they are driven mad that is by itself scary. Oh yes, the film is gory and serves up a lot of blood. When the virus attacks an individual, you will see the very gruesome symptoms and it is quite intriguing that it makes them almost act like intelligent zombies. The gore effects has that B-movie charm, complete with the use of prosthetics and make up; and I was quite pleased that it stuck to old-fashioned red ink than CGI blood and effects.

The acting is quite good and then it can be expected when you have veteran such as Cheon Ho-Jin and the supporting cast headed by Lee Young-Hoon and Hyeon Jae Jo aren't bad either. The film's story is well-structured and managed to generate spooky thrills. However, for a story that supposedly revolves around a ""time is of the essence"" concept, the film is rather slow-moving that it may alienate some viewers. The film could've been edited a little better but then again, this is a South Korean film, so expect it fully flesh out its emotions and have some dramatic elements.

Overall, ""GP506"" is very much worth a watch. I wouldn't be surprised if this film would be remade for U.S. audiences. This is one horror film that counts on the mystery behind its plot rather than to induce cheap scares to generate suspense and chills.

Recommended! [3  Stars]
