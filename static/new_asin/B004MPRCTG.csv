4432184,4,B004MPRCTG,"At first, I thought this was a documentary.  When I found out it was a drama, I lost interest.  It may be absolutely sublime, but it's not what I was looking for: I pursue technical films on the Hubble.",1299369600,,202,4.153846153846154
4432185,5,B004MPRCTG,"I saw this movie last night and am still in awe at what the space program has done and also how IMAX filmed this incredible movie.  I worked for NASA during the development of Hubble and felt pride (and goosebumps) seeing it put into place in this film. Amazing to witness and see the stress on the astronaut's faces as they were being dressed in their flightsuits just a few hours from liftoff.

It also left me a little sad that we're so blessed to live on such a beautiful, miraculous planet and to know how society (and terrorists) are trying its best to ruin life on this planet Earth.

I've just ordered my copy; can't wait to share it with family and friends.",1298678400,44,666,4.354838709677419
4432186,5,B004MPRCTG,"I've been an astronomy buff ever since I was a small child. So, when I learned that the Denver Museum of Nature and Science was showing a new IMAX movie about the Hubble Space Telescope, I had to see it. The theater hadn't yet upgraded to a 3D projection system, so the version I saw was in 2D. Believe me, that was plenty good enough.

It is said that Hubble is the most famous telescope ever built, and there are about 20 years' worth of fabulous cosmic images to prove it. When NASA initially announced that it was too dangerous for the Space Shuttle to make one last Hubble servicing mission to do needed repairs and upgrades, a lot of us went into mourning. And when they changed their minds, we rejoiced.

The movie is partly about the 2009 servicing mission, along with archival footage from earlier missions. This part is interesting, but not particularly new to me -- the PBS science program Nova has done at least one hour-long segment which goes into much greater detail. We get to meet the seven very brave astronauts who were literally willing to risk their lives to get the job done. Space is a dangerous place, and a single careless slip of the hands can lead to a sliced glove and a fatal loss of suit pressure.

Also, two space shuttles have been lost over the years, along with 14 astronauts, so they had a backup shuttle on the pad just in case a rescue mission was needed. Thankfully, it wasn't.

We learn a few fun things about life in orbit, such as how to make a chicken burrito in microgravity, and how to get ready for a space walk. I discovered that, even though space is silent, the sounds of power tools can be transmitted through a space suit, to be picked up by the helmet microphone.

Where the movie really shines, however, is when they show footage of the Earth from orbit, and especially when they begin to explore the cosmos. Decades of effects-laden blockbuster films have tended to jade us, but what we see in Hubble IMAX is real, as seen from the Hubble Space Telescope itself.

I about lost it when the camera began to zoom in on Orion's Belt, and slowly the Orion Nebula swam into view. It was as if we were spanning lightyears, at warp speed, in mere seconds. Then the camera began to explore an enormous cosmic valley with walls of gas and dust, some 15 lightyears across, hollowed out by fierce interstellar winds and dotted with infant solar systems dubbed ""tadpoles"" by scientists. One particular system looked like a tiny golden gem swathed in a huge, black nest, and might well resemble our own solar system aeons ago when the planets were just beginning to form.

What struck me more than anything else was how uniquely privileged our generation is, of all the generations in human history. The ancients could gaze up in awe at the stars from their campfires and make up poems and stories, but only we, thanks to telescopes like Hubble, can see such stunningly beautiful images of planets, stars, nebulae, galaxies, even the entire visible universe looking like a piece of gauze, the strands sprinkled liberally with gem dust.

I was struck also by the fact that there was hardly a peep from any of the children in the audience. They were all paying rapt attention.

I've never before seen any IMAX movie more than once. So far, I've seen Hubble three times. My most recent trip was to a 3D showing at a local cineplex. That was a plus. Now, as the camera zoomed, the stars actually came out of the screen at me. The 2009 shuttle footage, presumably shot in 3D, was incredibly real -- I was tempted to reach out and try to touch the astronauts' equipment as they got ready for a space walk. Archival footage, most likely converted to 3D, had a peculiar, subtle flatness to it I've dubbed 2-1/2D. It just didn't look quite right. I'm sure the producers did their very best, but the technology is still evolving.

A note on the music: The film featured two familiar tunes -- ""Somewhere, Over the Rainbow"" and ""What a Wonderful World"". I would have loved to have heard, respectively, the original Judy Garland and Louis Armstrong versions. However, what appeared in the film did the job -- and I can't get the tunes out of my head.

In conclusion, this movie is well worth watching, if you're into astronomy or if you have kids who are. I'm seriously looking forward to the DVD. Even in 2D, it will be worth it. For the first time, I can imagine why someone would want a giant-screen TV in their house. If ever I come into a large amount of money, maybe I'll build my own IMAX theater in the basement.",1298505600,223,4546,4.504854368932039
4432187,5,B004MPRCTG,The only thing that I can say: Its AWESOME. I saw this video at Houston Museum and  waiting to buy this marvelous product.,1296864000,,122,4.304347826086956
4432188,5,B004MPRCTG,"Not much to add that hasn't already been written in the other reviews.  The only bad thing was the running time but the ticket price was not that of other Imax 3D shows so that was slightly offset.
I was in awe and can't figure out how the audience was able to navigate through space via the Hubble telescope images.  Highly entertaining and makes you feel humble by the size of what is out there.",1283126400,2,397,4.28
4432189,4,B004MPRCTG,"In May of 2009, the crew of Space Shuttle ""Atlantis"" oversaw the fifth and final service mission of the Hubble Space Telescope, known to NASA as STS-125 or Hubble Space Telescope Servicing Mission 4. The mission called for delicate repairs and state-of-the-art upgrades, including the instillation of the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (to study the formation and evolution of galaxies) and the Wide Field Camera 3 (which captures images on the visible spectrum). The crew also had to replace one of the telescope's three Fine Guidance Sensors, six gyroscopes, and two battery unit modules. The mission was a success, completed in less than thirteen days. Because of the crew's efforts, Hubble will continue to operate until at least 2014, when it's expected to be replaced by the James Webb Space Telescope.

IMAX's ""Hubble 3D,"" narrated by Leonardo DiCaprio, is in part a documentation of this mission, made possible due to the IMAX Space Team and the specially designed IMAX 3D camera. While hardly an exhaustive account - which is just as well, since it would mean having to endure confusing technobabble and a slew of acronyms known only to NASA personnel - we're shown some impressive spacewalk and repair footage, aided greatly by the ever-present backdrop of Earth. We also get some insightful, if brief, moments with the ""Atlantis"" crew, including a demonstration of how to dress for a spacewalk, a discussion of some of the tools they will be using, and an amusing look at what an astronaut can eat and how it's made possible. There's a general sense of enthusiasm amongst the seven astronauts, although that may have more to do with the camera crew than with the actual mission.

We don't get a detailed history of the Hubble itself. Its original 1990 launch, for example, and the subsequent three-year odyssey to repair its design flaw are mentioned in passing, drastically downplaying the time, money, and effort that was spent to get it working properly. You have to understand that this is by no means a cheap piece of machinery; its initial cost was estimated at around $400 million, and that figure has only increased with time. With so much invested in it, there was an understandable backlash when it was apparent that there was an error with the optical system, the returned images failing to achieve sharp focus. The cause of the problem was the telescope's primary mirror, which had been ground to the wrong shape - the edges were off measurement by 2,200 nanometers, and to give you some perspective, a single nanometer is about 1/100th the width of a human hair. The flaw was corrected in 1993 during Service Mission 1, known as STS-61, with the instillation of specially designed corrective optics.

Since then, Hubble has captured a number of remarkable images. Because of its orbit outside the distortion of Earth's atmosphere, there's virtually no background light, allowing for the sharpest quality pictures. Consider the Ultra Deep Field image, which captures a small section of space in the constellation Fornax and is composited from four months worth of data; it reveals a cluster of galaxies of all shapes, ages, and colors, and it remains to this day the deepest image of space ever captured, looking back approximately 13 billion years. The film takes data similar to this and transforms it into breathtaking computer generated flights through distant regions of space. One scene in particular takes us into the Orion Nebula, where a massive group of stars form in a crevice that spans 90 million light years. Given time, some of those stars may form solar systems very much like our own.

This is the second part of what ""Hubble 3D"" is: An awe-inspiring journey, a deeply thought-provoking foray into the great unknown. It has the power to make you think, to raise questions about ourselves, about where it all came from, about what it all means. It wisely avoids speculation; it merely presents the material as is, and your mind does the rest. The fact that it's all presented in 3D only adds to the wonder. Plenty has been said about James Cameron's ""Avatar"" - and I've certainly contributed - but ""Hubble 3D"" is by far the best 3D film I've ever seen. Never have I felt so deeply immersed, so entirely a part of the world projected up on the screen. It reaches a level so rarely reached by the hordes of 3D movies released on conventionally sized screens.

If there is a weakness to ""Hubble 3D,"" it's that it doesn't spend enough time on its subject. It clocks in at a measly forty-five minutes - on television, that would amount to an hour-long special. I would have greatly appreciated an expansion of telescope's history, including who designed it, how it was funded, when it was built, how it affected popular culture, and so on. The images it has captured, after all, are the reason we can create such accurate computer generated maps of nebulas and galaxies. I don't believe we can truly appreciate the contributions the Hubble has made without first knowing what went into making them possible. Sure, any book or internet site can fill you in on the details, but if you're already at the theater, you might as well learn everything you need to know there.",1282780800,5,5199,4.870056497175141
4432190,5,B004MPRCTG,"Space.  To bodly go where no man has gone before...

For a recommended movie, this one tops the cake.  You just gotta see it.

As an adult, I wouldn't normally use the term OMG, but there's no better description for this show we saw at the IMAX theatre the other day.  And my husband... well all he could say was WOW!  I almost had to close his mouth shut at the end because he was so impressed, his jaw dropped.  We were both taken aback.

4432191,5,B004MPRCTG,"There is no way you can see this absolutely stunning IMAX 3D show and not ask yourself, ""And, why are we basically suspending our space program?""

Just a terrific show and the film brings home the fact that every penny spent on our space program, and Hubble, has proved to be the best bargain ever purchased in the history of our planet .. ..

There is absolutely no way we could see back to the beginning of creation without the Hubble & NASA .. ..

It will make you tear up seeing what we can accomplish and what we can do .. ..

More fulfilling is seeing all the young kids in the audience and watching their jaws drop when they see pictures of the universe from Hubble and all the star nurseries that have been discovered .. ..

Our space program (NASA) proves to all of us that anything is possible and that they have made 'the impossible into inevitable' .. ..

Even the Hubble stuff they show is so old and out of date and to be honest there aren't many pictures from Hubble.  A lot of the video is about the telescope it's self and the repairing of it.

4432330,5,B004MPRCTG,"I think I have been a little unfair towards the collection of IMAX 3D Blu-ray
releases that have been available for the past few years, giving more
preference to movie releases when compiling my list of top 3D titles.  After
all, I am guessing most consumers who are gauging 3D Blu-ray purchases
are looking for the most bang for the buck and tend to pick movies over
documentaries.  After all, these IMAX Blu-rays are very expensive when
considering they only have a running time of 45 minutes.  That's a huge
deterrent for anyone looking to keep their entertainment purchases within
budget.

The good news is, if you wait long enough, the price of these IMAX titles
usually always hit the $20 mark, which I think is the perfect price point for
most individuals, including myself.  You see, I never received an advanced
screener of Imax Hubble 3D, so I took my time and waited for the eventual
price drop. For those of you reading this review, I am about to persuade you
to open your wallets and make a very wise $20 investment that will harness
the full power of your 3D display.

With the space shuttle program winding down in May of 2009, Imax Hubble 3D
archives the mission of 7 astronauts and their last chance to save the ailing
Hubble Telescope's warped mirror.  With state-of-the-art instruments on board,
their mission is to improve the telescope's discovery capability.

The best word to describe the experience of watching this mission unfold is
""stunning.""  Donning 3D eyewear, I was simply amazed at how my display was
turned into a perfect picture-window where I felt instantly connected to the events
on screen.  The IMAX footage itself is incredibly awe-inspiring -- so crisp and
ultra-detailed -- that I felt as if I could reach out and touch the telescope laying
before me.  An astounding level of depth -- almost limitless -- creates an immersive
environment like no other.

Some of the best moments to savor....

* There's an amazing shot of the pool in which the astronauts use for weightless
training.  We are actually introduced to it at water level, just before going under.
The perspective of depth within the room combined with the gorgeous blue color
of the water at eye-level is breathtaking to see.

* Approximately 19 minutes into the documentary there is a shot from, I believe,
the Space Shuttle Endeavor.  A long rescue arm extends downwards, with the
Earth hovering just beneath. On a large screen, it is perhaps the most incredible
sight you will ever witness on your display.  Just sit back and savor the reach.

* At Approximately 27 minutes, there are more stunning shots of the Hubble
telescope floating above earth, but with the addition of a very thin tether that
places itself most prominently forward in view, creating an additional layered
obstacle that only furthers the 3D enhancement.

I mentioned limitless depth earlier in the review, and it plays the most essential
part of this 3D experience.  You really get a sense of the vastness of space,
watching our earth and the man-made creations above it, floating in what can be
best described as black nothingness.  If you want to test the level of black your
display can produce, this is the perfect demo disc.  I am very fortunate to have a
plasma that was able to produce the inkiest levels of black.  When you see that type
of blackness surrounding the Earth, it's...well...something you really need to see for
yourself.

While watching some of this awesome footage, you begin to take notice of items
that pop themselves forward.  Look at how the open panel doors of the Hubble
telescope extend themselves outward.  Various tools that the astronauts use for
repair also protrude forward.  This isn't an overly gimmicky presentation -- and
it need not be as the visuals from space are inspiring enough to watch on their own.

Some may complain that a lot of spectacular 3D footage is bogged down by the
personal moments spent with the astronauts aboard the space shuttle. Personally,
I found these moments rather cool to watch.  Some may also object to the amount
of computer-generated 2D static images taken from the Hubble telescope that were
converted to 3D by pulling apart stars and nebulas, giving them more texture and
a feeling of space as it really is. Personally, I really enjoyed these re-imagined images.
All I can say is be patient.  As we near the end of this documentary, we find ourselves
peering into the edge of the observable universe, looking at images 10 billion light
years away.  I have never dropped acid in my life, but as the camera pulls back on a
multitude of star fields, I can just imagine what the drug-induced experience must
have been like.

The audible experience of Imax Hubble 3D is just as immersive as the video.  The
soothing narration by Leonardo Dicaprio is delegated to the center channel.  The fronts
and rears provide an enveloping array of effect sounds.  I love the way that the voices
of the astronauts and mission controllers were placed squarely into the rears.  This
provides a constant level of vocal cross-direction.  Do yourself a favor and turn up
your receiver/amps during the launch of the Space Shuttle Atlantis.  It will be quite
an amazing experience to watch and feel, thanks to the strong rumble of the LFE channel.

Imax Hubble 3D arrives as a single Blu-ray disc with both 3D and 2D feature
presentation.  It may have originally come with an outer cardboard sleeve -- I am
not certain -- but with the discounted price it comes in a standard case.  There is a
really great added feature that takes viewers behind-the-scenes of filming this
Imax documentary.  There is also a Hubble Mission Logs Webisode Gallery included.

What more can I say to persuade you to drop $20 on the best IMAX feature I have
had the pleasure of reviewing thus far?

If you have been spending all your money buying and watching 3D feature films, I
urge you to give these IMAX documentaries your highest consideration -- particularly
this one.  They really unleash the full potential of your 3D display.  These are the the
moments that you just sit back in your chair, gasp in admiration, while continually
uttering the word, ""WOW!""",1453075200,18,6170,4.789224952741021

It contained the birthplace of stars. What amazed me was how that portion was filmed. First showing the immensity of Hubble's observable space and then zeroing in on the pink nebulous telling the viewer it was 1,500 light years away. A light year is 6 trillion miles. We then enter the star nursery, which is 90 trillion miles across. When I saw the baby stars, I have to admit that my eyes welled up. I was really overwhelmed with the images I was witnessing. They took my breath away. This film captured the bravery of the astronauts, the beauty of space and my imagination.

4432359,3,B004MPRCTG,"Amazon says a three star rating means you feel it is ""ok.""  That's about right!  Not great, not awful.

Pros: some fantastic shots of stuff the Hubble has seen, including the (presumably) computer simulations allowing us to be whisked inside the Orion Nebula, even! Very cool, indeed.  I also enjoyed the sense of humor conveyed by the men and woman (although ""she"" didn't actually have a whole lot of talk time, I'm gong to assume ""she"" had a good sense of humor, too) who comprised the final shuttle servicing mission to Hubble - made the whole thing more human and helped me enter into the joyful excitement of being a part of such a mission.

Cons: strange shifting in the sound quality (presumably b/c I don't have a super-cool IMAX sound system at my house) and unfortunately shifting from great IMAX/high def footage to teeny TV clips from the 1990s....a little weird, again it might have worked better in an IMAX theater.  Also, although the description of the subject of the DVD clearly says it focuses on the repairs the Hubble needed, I was still hoping for more of the ""wow!"" footage that Hubble actually brought us for all that time and trouble to repair and enhance over the years.  An interesting angle would be to compare shots of similar parts of space with each lens improvement, for instance...how much better can we see now, etc.?

We have been studying space for our homeschooling science for awhile now and are now finishing up by looking at Hubble and other satellites and space probes.  Prior to this film, we watched the Nat Geo's DVD *Hubble's Cosmic Journey* and, although it had many, many positives about it and (perhaps) covered more ground than this film, was definitely not as interesting nor nearly as beautiful as this IMAX one.",1433808000,,1762,4.73202614379085

4432421,5,B004MPRCTG,"This is a very nice piece of work, with great IMAX production values.  It is the go-to disc when showing off my home theater, with awesome sound, spectacular space sequences on the shuttles, and highly informative deep space Hubble imagery.",1403654400,,240,5.0
4432422,5,B004MPRCTG,Man are you kidding you've got to see this in 3D this is the same movie IMAX had if you haven't seen this it will blow your mind I love it,1402704000,,138,3.4838709677419355
4432423,5,B004MPRCTG,Unbelievable view of the Universe. The 3D effects made the trip seem as though I was in a Space Craft.. flying through the Galaxy. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has a penchant for 'Beauty'; The colors are astounding !!,1402358400,,231,4.523809523809524
4432424,5,B004MPRCTG,This video captures a key part of history and under 3D mesmerizes many who watch.  We're used this in our media room w/ several kids and they are simply entertained beyond our expectation.  Along w/ IMAX Under the Sea these are great babysitting videos.,1402272000,,253,4.7272727272727275
4432425,5,B004MPRCTG,"I am a teacher in NYC. We are currently studying Space Science.  We played this DVD as a supplement to our academic curriculum.  It is perfect because it can be viewed within one period.  The DVD is about 45 minutes long. My 5th graders loved it.

The price was awesome as well. Individually priced at Kennedy Space Center the cost would have be $25.00 each IMAX.
 I ordered a bundle of three DVD's for $27.00!
The bundle included:
IMAX Hubble,
When We Left Earth: The NASA Missions (Limited Edition),-not in IMAX
IMAX Space Station",1401580800,5,532,4.617021276595745
4432426,5,B004MPRCTG,This IMAX film does a beautiful job of explaining the effort to save Hubble and the importance of the telescope's work. The footage taken from Hubble creates a rich backdrop unlike any of the images you may have seen before of the cosmos.,1400716800,,238,4.558139534883721

4432429,5,B004MPRCTG,Highly recommend this DVD. IMAX cameras and quality of the 3D is very cool especially in space.  Product was very cooperatively priced as shipped quickly. Highly recommend both the DVD and seller!,1399680000,,196,5.125

4432431,4,B004MPRCTG,My family and I enjoyed watching and learning about the telescope and how much we can learn from space.  The 3D was awesome and the Astronauts in space life was amazing to watch.  We like facts that are known and not someone's idea of what maybe or could have been.  This was a good documentary.,1397606400,,295,4.327272727272727
4432432,5,B004MPRCTG,"I have a Panasonic Blu-ray 3d player and TV so it works great.  Haven't tried it on regular Blu-ray, but should work fine.  It tells about going up to repair the Hubble.  Great views from space and learning how to use the unique tools.",1397174400,,235,4.295454545454546

I hope that IMAX comes out with another doc that JUST travels the universe from start to finish. This is a great start for more 3D space rides to come! The music and voiceover is perfect! I sat about 4 feet away from my 73 inch TV. HOLY CRAP! It was so great!....if you have the means, I highly suggest you do this once in your life. It brought tears to my eyes!!...JEEPERS!! I don't know what else to say! Why do I need 19 more words! I see other reviews with less words than this! Why do I have to type out so many damn words to post a stupid review!! You know what, I take it back! This movie sucked!  Just kidding, it was awesome. Like I said before. Im just mad now because I have to keep typing words so you will be able to read this review.

4432436,5,B004MPRCTG,"This 3D film is outstanding. The 3D visuals are out of this world-literally amazing. The content is equally impressive.

I bought this film purely out of my personal interest in the latest discoveries of space and the universe, expecting possibly a visually impacting experience. However I had not done any research or had not even heard of this film.

Now it is one of my most prized 3D films. It is great to watch with guests because it is short and is great for conversation, learning, and just overall a pleasant experience.",1394496000,,528,4.728260869565218
4432437,2,B004MPRCTG,Boring and not worth your time even though it had potential... Not even in 2D. Waste of money and time!,1393286400,2,103,4.2

sound is fantastic.  A must buy if you are interested in space.",1393286400,,196,4.157894736842105

4432440,5,B004MPRCTG,The 3D is 10/10. Stunning photography of and from Hubble as well as eye-popping nebulae just go beyond the words breathtaking. Definite worth the purchase.,1392508800,,155,5.24
4432441,5,B004MPRCTG,"This is the best 3D film that I've bought from Amazon so far (I have had 14 discs). The scene of outer space and pictures taken by Hubble are just spectacular. Though some images are made into 3D, but still the effect is great. If you have to choose only one 3D film, this will be the best choice!",1392336000,,297,4.0508474576271185
4432442,5,B004MPRCTG,"as far as 3D goes, this is one of the best,great graphics, nicely made, watched it many times yet only had it for a month",1392249600,,121,3.88
4432443,5,B004MPRCTG,"This is an amazing 3D video. Got my new Viera 3D TV and this was the first movie I HAD to have. I had seen it in iMax and loved it. It's better at home where you can talk and be comfortable.

With home 3D active shutter glasses, it's more ""alive"" then iMax which uses passive 3D glasses, which are cheaper. My 65"" Panasonic Viera TV is huge and this fills it with incredible motion and beautiful scenes. The space repairs are amazing, and 3D does these astronaut heroes justice as they provide repairs that allow us to see outer space as never before. The Hubble is a scientific wonder, and has provided oodles of information for astronomers. Now you can see the heroes work to keep it doing its job.

FYI: THe Hubble was made with a mirror that was misshapen, and didn't work as planned (D'oh!!). The first repair literally applied a contact lens to correct the refractive error. The second repair was to replace dying parts, which is the main focus of this video.

I've watched it three times because it's not the STORY that matters here; it's the space images, which never get old. Our blue orb never looked this good.

Enjoy, and pass the popcorn please.",1391990400,2,1158,4.4739336492890995
4432444,5,B004MPRCTG,"There is not a lot of space footage in this movie, but what there is is spectacular not just because of the visuals, but the information that goes along with it. I found the rest of the movie fascinating. I saw this originally in the theatre in 3D. It looses a little on a TV screen, but still amazing.",1391644800,,302,4.135593220338983

4432446,5,B004MPRCTG,I was amazed at how many aspects of this video were of such high quality. The Hubble digital photos in 3D were hypnotizing beautiful. The writing was informative and captivating. Leonardo De Caprio has a future doing voice overs for videos. I was thoroughly entertained.,1391126400,,270,5.022222222222222
4432447,5,B004MPRCTG,I chose this rating because this cd was excellent.  The 3d was very well done.  I enjoyed it very much.,1390953600,,103,4.1

4432452,4,B004MPRCTG,"Not as good as the Imax Under the Sea when it comes to 3D - that is the best I have seen so far.  But this is good, and if you have a sub-woofer with your surround sound system, you will enjoy the rocket launches. Frankly I was watching and wondering if what I was seeing was really all captures from the Hubble or if some of it was animated.  We live in an incredible universe.",1389830400,,378,3.960526315789474
4432453,5,B004MPRCTG,Awesome picture. Amazing story. Altime favorite movie as a kid. Even better in the dark. Shared it with my mom and dad.,1389312000,,119,4.454545454545454
4432454,5,B004MPRCTG,To think that you are actually looking at real pictures from space taken by the Hubble telescope is impressive. The travel through space and the shear magnitude of space is beyond my ability of comprehension. All people should see this movie just to put their own worth in the world in perspective.,1389225600,,298,4.75
4432455,4,B004MPRCTG,"This is by far my top 3D BlueRay DVD & everytime I watch it, it further proves to me how wonderful, how awesome, how omnipotent God that created it is.

4432458,3,B004MPRCTG,"I purchased this DVD from Amazon and watched it on my new Sony 70"" MDL KDL-70550A 3-D TV.  The 3D effects were decent and the view of the outter space was spectacular.  Bigger is better with 3-D.  You will enjoy it even more if you have a  3D projector that gives a screen size of 115"" to 120"" .  The 3D effects were not as spectacular as the ""Space Station"" but worth watching.
Nice to have it on the shelf of your 3-D library. Since I bought it I will keep it with my 3-D collection but if you can rent it from Red Box for  $1 then go for it.",1388448000,3,544,3.855855855855856

It came in a large box with other items I had purchased on the same order.  The case is broken on the corner preventing it to be completely closed.  The speed of the shipping and delivery was 2 Day Prime shipping so I can't complain but with the case being broken like that, I can't leave it unrecognized.",1387238400,,444,4.011363636363637

4432477,5,B004MPRCTG,"First off: You need 3D on your home TV and surround sound. Good surround sound. If you have this, this video will expand your brane. I've seen it twice on the 60' IMAX screen at the California Science Center, and with my home rig, this is a scaled-down but equally awesome experience, right here in my man cave. I have a 60"" Panasonic 3D flatscreen and real surround speakers, not those little boxes which come in a kit.

The sequence of events is fascinating, and the space shuttle launch, especially the one seen from an up-close camera, will blow your windows out. You have to keep telling yourself that the images of planets and star clusters and galaxies are REAL ones, captured by the Hubble Space Telescope. The video is not only visually and sonically superb, it is perilously educational. Show it to your kids and grandkids.

I did another interesting thing. After seeing this on the big screen, I took the subway up to Hollywood and saw the movie ""Gravity"" at the Chinese theater, also with a big IMAX screen, 3D, and surround sound. The fake scenes in the movie are exactly the same as the real ones in this video. Both are absolutely amazing.

Get 3D and surround sound at home! Then, get this video!",1385164800,6,1212,4.576036866359447
4432478,5,B004MPRCTG,I am in awe of the many spectacular accomplishments of men and women in science and mathematics. The Hubble Space Telescope is one of those accomplishments.

4432480,1,B004MPRCTG,Well I would have been pleased to give a Five Star Review if I had gotten the IMAX: Hubble 3D (Blu-ray 3D + Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy Combo Pack) instead all I got was the 3D Blu-ray. I don't have away to watch this at the moment since I don't own a 3D Blu-ray player yet.

4432483,5,B004MPRCTG,"It's all absolutely amazing. At times stars fill the room and invade your space so that you can almost reach out and grab them. But one scene in particular just blew my mind. At about 14:30 minutes into the video the shuttle's robotic arm juts totally out of the screen in the most jaw dropping and spectacular 3D effect I have ever seen. I have a projector and a 200 inch diagonal viewing surface. So this is a giant robotic arm that stretches out across the room (it's probably as big as the actual shuttle arm). It extends out across the full length of the room all the way to where I'm sitting 14 feet away. I can raise my foot from the recliner and ""touch"" it. I've never experienced anything like that with 3D before.",1382572800,,723,4.323529411764706

I would estimate 40 minutes of this IMAX footage focuses on the astronauts and only 5 minutes on the photographic results of their repairs.

I wanted to see more time spent showing what it can photograph than how they put it there and repaired it, though that is interesting.  I will watch it again and again for the spetactular photos that it is capable of taking.

This what I am amazed at.  There is a sequence in this movie where you're taken on a trip into the Crab Nebula and see stars in the process of being born.  wow.  It seems that 3D technology is applied after the movie is created.  Therefore, can they convert any movie into 3D?  Leo DiCaprio is a good narrator, although his voice is slightly nasal.  I don't mind.  He speaks with ""heart"".  The problem is that this is only 40 min. long.  It's over before you know it.  Just when you are settling back into your seat, it's over!  Also, it's just a primer for the ""rest of the story"".  No deep scientific insights for adults.  Just to impress kids.  I keep asking myself, is this worth $30? .........  no.

If you love space footage, you'll get it.  You get to see the astronauts completing EVAs to fix Hubble and it feels like you're there.  I've always wanted to go into space, so this part was interesting and exciting for me vs other people who completed reviews out here and were bored by that footage.  The enlarged images from Hubble that are used in the movie are amazing and hauntingly beautiful.

The voice over by Leonard Dicaprio is unobtrusive.  You hear him, and don't think about it being his voice, unlike other movies where the actors voice can become distracting.

Overall, this is a great movie.  Better in the IMAX and in 3D, but still really fun to watch if you love space exploration and are pining for the days of live feeds from NASA during shuttle missions.",1364860800,,966,4.4124293785310735

4432611,4,B004MPRCTG,"Hubble 3D follows several astronauts as they launch into space to repair the Hubble telescope. The documentary itself is pretty good but where it really pays off is in the final part of the film.
They take the Hubble's images,render them into 3D,then take you the viewer through a tour of our universe as far back as we can possibly go through the cosmos to the primordial beginnings of ancient galaxies that barely resemble our own,and yes, it's as awesome as it sounds.
Honestly,it's pretty cool to watch what the astronauts go through preparing for a trip into space but this film could have been the final part all the way through and I think it would have packed a better punch.
Sometimes instead of telling us about something it's simply better just to show us,and I feel this is where Hubble 3D fell a little short.
I think a Hubble exploration 3D bluray would hit the sweet spot a little better,but still, this Imax movie all around is a great one to watch and to add to your collection.

Know what you're buying here:

half of the film is about the discoveries that they've made through the use of the Hubble. Using wonderful computer enhancements you'll see things you've never seen before.

The other half of the flick is about the astronauts themselves, their training and the space station.

It's paced very well, and my kids all loved it. They range in age from 6-10. (their friends thought it was pretty awesome too)

I love watching films like this, but tend to get nervous because I don't have a similar world view as many of the film makers or the scientists they quote. Yet, in this film I was not bombarded with someone's personal beliefs or the views, but what they see as facts and the astounding images of the universe.

Soundtrack is awesome, but needs a high quality, full range system, with lots of headroom and really good subwoofers to hear it all. The launch sequences are truly speaker-breaking (for less-than-adequate systems). Like all/most IMAX films, the quality of the high resolution video, seen on a BIG screen is always impressive and this film is no different. Some scenes are simply awesome (that word again), and with most shots, especially of the Hubble itself while under repair/refit, being shot with a stationary camera, you get a chance to look around the scene to see some of the minutiae. One small bonus for me was seeing the actual work required to break off a troublesome handle that got in the way. The vantage points they managed, especially around the launch pad, are just fabulous.

A top film, stunning, made with care. Too bad they could only afford to send up 1 mile of film. And we need to constantly remind ourselves that IMAX allows a max of 10 minutes of shooting per reel. Changing reels in space would have been fun.",1356912000,,1112,4.791666666666667

4432668,1,B004MPRCTG,"After watching it, I felt that Imax Hubble 3D failed to meet the experience expected of an Imax 3d movie. I don't want to make strong comment, but I would say that I felt cheated of my money. Why?

Visual Experience:
On outer space scenes, the point of view and movement of the camera were very limited, which kept showing the same angle, the back of astronauts fixing the telescope, understandably so, since it is extremely difficult to get a footage from moving camera in outer space outside the shuttle. So the main outer space scenes are mostly static and boring, and shown repeatedly, which didn't really bring out the advantage of Imax 3d camera. With today's standard of filming, this is a major flaw, it's like watching footage of a surveillance camera.

Next thing, scenes are switching back and forth from full hd to low-res and cropped footage of astronaut fixing the telescope's parts. I wondered why such editing style? I paid handsome price of Imax 3d blu ray to enjoy the experience and visual. Not low-res and extremely low-res in someparts .

Content:
Other than visual, the information and education materials conveyed in this documentary, none are really new to public knowledge about living in outer space. Underwater training, space diets, etc. The documentary team could do better by exploring deeper aspects of living in outer space, peculiar stuffs that public don't already know.

The Best Part:
The best part of it is ironically the 3d animation / simulation of a galaxy, which isn't directly produced by hubble. And it is short.

3D effect:
3D effect is nothing special. None of the scene is noteworthy, it didn't make significant difference in experience nor making the audience understand the space quest better.

My Conclusion:
For children or audience that is relatively new to space journey, this documentary may be acceptable. But for intermediate audience and above, and if you're looking for 'wow' moment, meaningful information, and thrills. Well, this is not for you. I am honestly surprised that this title made it to Imax 3D collection, other than the fact that it was shot in space, nothing is special or worth the price tag.",1355961600,28,2165,4.917808219178082

4432683,5,B004MPRCTG,"I read most of the other reviews before buying this wonderful DVD.  Almost all rated it very highly.  However there was one review that put it down a peg referring to is as simply a NASA promotion.  However this was not the feeling that I got at all.  The sense of drama carrying out intricate repairs in space is real. The views as you 'travel' 'through' star systems is absolutely breath-taking. All in all a very good purchase and I have no regrets.

4432688,5,B004MPRCTG,The producers of this film did an AMAZING job. I believe this is the kind of thing that Imax was made for! I originally had seen this at the Reuben H. Fleet Science center in San Diego a year ago and went looking for it in there store recently. They wanted $40 for it!! Started looking on Amazon and discovered Prime instant videos and got it for $15!! I love this film and would recommend it to anyone who likes seeing great high quality shots of space and learning about how small we really are on this place called Earth.

It just doesn't seem right that you pay the same for a 2 hour movie for a documentary thats under an hour.. Fortunately the prices on Amazon are better than you'd find in a store, but even so..

4432691,3,B004MPRCTG,I guess I expected more space views and views from the Hubble for the price paid.  It was interesting to watch once but I don't feel it was worth the cost.,1346457600,9,155,4.0
4432692,4,B004MPRCTG,"I'm a big fan of 3D Blu-Rays. I have about 65 total so far and decided to check out a few of the IMAX titles since the prices have recently gone down and they're generally rated pretty highly.

To start, HUBBLE is available in 4 different packages:

DVD (2D-only)
Blu-Ray (2D-only)
Blu-Ray 3D (3D and 2D versions.. note that while described as a 2-disc set, it's a single disc with both versions)
Blu-Ray Combo (3D + 2D + DVD + Digital Copy)

Make sure that when buying it you buy one of the releases which says ""3D"" on it. Also note this is a real Blu-Ray 3D (requiring a 3D capable Blu-Ray player and 3DTV.. not the red/blue glasses)

With that out of the way, HUBBLE 3D clocks in at 44 minutes. At first I was a bit concerned as that didn't seem very long at all -- in reality, that's a bit of a mixed bag (at times I wish they went further into depth on some parts and at other times felt it dragged on too long).

I did know what I was getting into with this release - a 3D IMAX film about the Hubble repair. I wasn't going into this expecting to see 45 minutes of amazing footage captured by the Hubble, but I still left somewhat disappointed.

The film uses a variety of media - some of it being recent (2009), some being very old BBC clips, some being what looks like 1990's webcam footage and some being footage from around the original launch of the hubble. Most is presented in a way that fills the widescreen, some is presented as a small portion of the screen (sometimes what seems like 1/4 of the screen size, other times closer to 1/16 of the size), fortunately these are small.

Despite the mixed media types, most of it is presented in 3D (I'm assuming some of it was post-converted, as it looks like it was filmed with a webcam, but it does still look good. Just not ""as good"" as the IMAX 3D footage from 2009).

The video footage is very clear (2009 footage) and shows amazing detail.. this makes the 3D footage just that much more impressive. The other footage is passable.

* THE 3D * footage is the reason you'd want the release. This title uses some amazing 3D (the credits and space footage where stars fly right towards you (probably more popout than any other release I've seen), the couple of shots of ""hubble footage"" are equally impressive and go on for about 5 minutes a piece (zooming in and navigating through the footage). These combined 10 minutes of footage are the reason for the 4 star review.  Lots of popout (opposed to only depth, which is very popular with many titles) and the fact that IMAX really pushes the footage (where some might have the footage barely popping out, this one is very in-your-face are the reasons to own this.

The film itself.. I found kind of boring at most times. I didn't need to see the random cuts of the space crew just hanging out in the shuttle (in-between amazing 3D footage) - that seemed more like something that belonged in the outtakes/bloopers section of a DVD.
The other gripe are that they mention some troubles (a bolt is stuck or part of the camera won't go into place) but due to the odd, fixed-camera angle you can't really see what's happening (and it just immediately gets resolved. It would have been nice if there was another camera angle or more time spent on each ""problem"" rather than ""Here's a problem.. and now it's fixed after several hours""  -- I do understand that's not the easiest thing to do in space.

In the end, the 3D was great. Some of the best I've seen. Of the 45 minutes of footage, about 10-15 were worth watching and the other 30 seemed to drag on or were just plain un-interesting.  With that said, due to how well the 3D was, I'd still give it 4-stars as a demo.
If you only plan to get the 2D release (DVD or Blu-Ray) I'd give it about 2 stars (out of 5).

If looking for the 3D release, I wouldn't suggest paying extra for the combo pack (3D + 2D + DVD + Digital Copy) for the same reason.. the DVD/Digital copy you spend extra on will likely never be used due to the fact the 3D is what makes this release.",1344988800,6,4021,4.307284768211921
4432693,1,B004MPRCTG,"I wanted to love this video. The stunning clarity of the visuals are incredible. The shots taken from the Hubble are completely mind blowing. But, please, 3/4 of the film is about the astronauts and their telescope repair. Ok - 1/4 could have been about that, but where were the additional extraordinary images from the Hubble - isn't that what we are paying to see?  Big, big mistake! Could have been a phenomenal DVD, instead of OK",1343001600,22,433,4.623376623376624
4432694,5,B004MPRCTG,This is a great awe inspiring show about how nasa saved the Hubble Space telescope. It's not about the findings or the things it shot in space very much. It's impressive and beautiful. The picture is perfect on blu ray 3d and the narration is excellent by LEonardo D c. It has webisodes for extras and you get a good sense of how hard it was to save the telescope. It does wet my appetite for more footage of the actual deep space findings of the telescope though.  If you KNOW what this is then you Wont be disapointed.,1340928000,,520,4.252525252525253
4432695,5,B004MPRCTG,"I saw this as a 3D IMAX film at the Kennedy Space Center Visitors Complex.  I absolutely loved it and immediately went to purchase the video to be able to watch again and again at home.  What is so amazing is how the detail transmitted by the Hubble telescope can be rendered, digitally, into a journey right into the Orion nebula and other celestial bodies.  The clarity and depth are amazing, as is the new information we now have about the birth of solar systems, etc.  The cinematography is stunning.  A truly beautiful film equally appropriate for both children and professional astronomers--indeed, anyone who would like a closeup glimpse into the amazing universe around us.",1340755200,,681,4.886956521739131

4432699,5,B004MPRCTG,What an amazing movie.  The story is a great addition to the amazing shots of space. Educational and spectacular.  Highly recommended.  The same non-IMAX version as at the Aeronautics and Pace Museum in DC.,1336694400,,206,5.0
4432700,5,B004MPRCTG,"Yes I am an admitted space nut having attended space camp and academy when I was younger. The 3d in this is absolutely stunning.  I had no idea of the quality of pictures that Hubble was giving us before seeing this. The information and history of the Hubble and its troubles was fascinating.

The first time we watched this was while family was visiting. There were 8 of us all just sitting there watching in stunned silence as the wonders of the universe were brought up close and personal. The quality of the pictures and the presentation in 3d just blew our minds.

This is a definite must buy",1334966400,2,597,4.458715596330276

We were not disappointed; it is a knock your socks off presentation that really shows off the 3-D capabilities and Blu-ray quality of our gear. I am sure it will be a go to disk when someone wants to see what home theater 3-D can be like. It is also a fascinating look at a side of the Space Shuttle program we will never see again.

I was contemplating returning this 70"" Sharp 3D TV (top of the line as of Feb 2012 excluding the $7000 Elite model) due to DSE (dirty screen effect) with 1080i materials (OTA, Cable). But this disc let me know what my TV is capable of displaying when the source is clean and top-notched.  DSE still present while watching this but very minimal.  This is a disc that I can use to show off my TV's 3D capability.  Highly recommend.  Storyline is a lil' on the lacking side but that's a plus cos' I couldn't focus on the plot any way with such picture-perfect 3D effect / distraction ...",1329436800,,667,4.346774193548387

4432709,1,B004MPRCTG,"I have often wondered where to see Hubble images in HD, and in that context, this was a terrible, terrible movie.  How hard could it be to make a film showing whatever it is that the Hubble has been shooting all these years?? Instead, they show the astronauts getting dressed and fooling around, and screwing parts into the both the underwater mock-up and the real Hubble for about 80% of the film.  An incredible waste of time!!  NASA knows how to buy rocket engines from outside vendors, they are world class at exceeding budgets and they really know how to crash stuff on Mars. However, they don't seem to have any desire to make a movie about anything other than their astronaut pals.  I did like the scene where that chief NASA bureaucrat gets berated for canceling the Hubble upkeep mission.

I wish they would have explained how much computer enhancement went into that one scene towards the end of the star cloud - was that all optical? or enhanced? They don't even say.  Jeez!

Note: if you are into astronauts, then this is probably an interesting movie.",1327190400,14,1064,4.627659574468085

Got it for $35. Could of been $60 wouldnt of made any difference to me. It's half the length of an ordinary film but worth every penny. Flying through space at 150 trillion miles per second in an accurately scaled universe with stunning vfx design. Hanging out in space with the astronauts watching them float around above the earth still makes my legs a bit queasy. This is an excellent production and if you have a 3D TV (hopefully a big one), this is the most necessary addition to your collection I coud think of. Excellent for a viewing with a significant other as well. You will not walk away from this picture without being touched and moved by how extraordinary space is and the bravery of the astronauts who dare to go there.

It is very educational to the kids and you can view this many times without it getting old.

The video documents several repair efforts that astronauts have made over the years as well as images the telescope has captured.  There are several scenes from within the space shuttle (and out) all in beautiful 3D.  While I bought the disc for the 3D content, I actually thought the content was well documented and informative.  I enjoyed the sound and video effects of the space shuttle launches too, stereo system was rumbling the place as if you were actually there!

One suggestion though, I wouldn't suggest you buy the disc from the resellers here as it is insanely marked up.  I was able to find it for about half the price at Bxxx Buy or Wally world.",1321574400,,810,4.576388888888889

The best part for me were the titles, which would burst into stars that appeared to float all around the room.

There are a couple of special feature clips, in 2D, but haven't checked them out yet.

I originally saw it in an IMAX theater at the Wright Patterson Air Force museum and it was FAR FAR better than looking at any pictures on some website. I've watched countless documentaries on space, going to the moon, etc and although this is the shortest, it also had the biggest WOW factor for me. It does document a large portion of the astronauts experience while fixing the Hubble but that's fine by me.

4432721,5,B004MPRCTG,"The documentary covers what hubble telescope can see, but also on the astronaut prep for upgrade and shuttle launch. I was speechless seeing the inside of nebula. The content is most enlighten of any documentary about deeper space.

Being a big space advocate and live dreams through Star Trek, this is both inspiring and depressing. Inspired by what man kind has done to construct such telescope and send to orbit and see what's out there in deep space. Depressed because we don't have an engine travelling fast enough (warp engine) in our lifetime to explore in person.

3D is shown for working in space (in-screen 3D) and travelling through the stars (some out-of-screen). It's definitely worthwhile for those collecting 3D for enjoyment and demo.

I now have many 3D videos and this one is THE BEST one. It not only shows off the Hubble, it is also one of the best 3D viedos.

The music is supposed to be in the background, and the spoken words should be audible, but they got it backwards.  I wonder if it was like this in the movie theater, or is this just sloppy transferring at the disc level?  The images, though, are wonderful.  Sharp and clear.  I wanted to see more of the Hubble pictures, too.  There was too much of the suiting up and so on, and not enough space photos.  -",1309219200,2,568,4.194444444444445

4432732,4,B004MPRCTG,"Like the Last Airbender, this Blu Ray 3D disc is, at least initially, an exclusive of another large electronics retailer. As with many Blu Ray 3D discs, the package includes a 3D BD, 2D BD, DVD and digital copy. (All of this could be provided on a 2-sided, single disc, with 3D/2D BD on one side and DVD/digital copy on the other, but that is obviously not as fiscally advantageous to the distributor.)

The 3D images in space were shot using an IMAX 3D film camera to document the final repairs to the Hubble Space Telescope in particular, but also the NASA Space Shuttle program in general, which will come to an end in July, 2011, for future generations. No future Hubble repairs will be possible as our ability to do heavy lifting for space delivery will end with the last shuttle unless private space companies rise to fill the gap. As such this 3D Blu Ray disc gets the job done well in 40 minutes. There are also many additional 2D segments which are all worth watching.

The 3D image is spectacular, as might be expected from IMAX. The camera is in a static position on the shuttle with the astronauts moving around in front of it for a given sequence. Presumably the camera was too big to hand hold. There are no trick shots, just documentary-type 3D, and it is very nice.

Of additional interest are the 3D images created from Hubble 2D images of distant, distant galaxies -- the thing Hubble was created to do. So the observer gets to ""fly"" through the cloud-like cosmic cradles where stars are born. This part of the disc was, to me, jaw-droppingly unexpected, and a very real reason to buy this 3D BD.

I dropped one star from the rating because of the number of 2D extras on the disc. 3D digital cameras are now small enough that many extras could have been shot in 3D. The quality would not have matched the IMAX 3D image, but would have made the cost of this short 3D Blu Ray disc more justifiable.",1307318400,54,1914,4.444444444444445
4432733,5,B004MPRCTG,"This movie is so good I saw it twice at the IMAX. I can't wait to get it on DVD.

The footage of the astronauts and the trip to repair the Hubble telescope was cool. But what's really special about this movie is footage from the Hubble itself, which takes you deep inside nebulae and galaxies to see incredible views of our universe.

I had to keep pinching myself to remember that it was not CGI... all of that amazing stuff really exists out there.

4432735,1,B004MPRCTG,"Several minutes of commercials and trailers for completely un-related videos into the program, you finally get the rest of the thing which is merely bragging about how they went about making the video, with frequent references to the personnel on the three missions to the HST, most of these lifted directly, or shared with, the footage from the NASA website and/or NASA TV.  There are precious few shots of a VERY few of the discoveries of the HST over the years.  A few of these are animated to abstraction, closing in or moving away from the objects that are subjects of the current view.  I'll save the jewel case and toss the rest of it.  I'd be too embarrassed to sell it to anyone, even used, and I surely wouldn't wish to build up anybody else's hopes and have them crash as mine did.  The Hubble Space Telescope was a brilliant and quite valuable project; this video is not!

The majority of the picture is about astronauts fixing a few bolts and panels in space.
I am sure there are those out there for whom that is fascinating. Please enjoy.
If you are looking for Hubble's magnificent images go to the NASA page or do a Google search. You will have more luck than in this video.",1301875200,47,570,4.490384615384615
4432738,3,B004MPRCTG,"""Hubble"" takes us out into space viewing through the eyes of the famous space telescope, Hubble. The 3D documentary is narrated by Leonardo DiCaprio and tells the tale of the telescope's origins, threats, successes, and the tale of one mission taken by astronauts to make some important improvements on it so it doesn't suddenly fall to Earth one day.

""Imax Hubble"" would undoubtedly be fascinating in 3D, I missed the screening for it. As soon as the introduction gets away from the astronauts and worries on Planet Earth, we are guided by Leo's voice into a rose cloud 90 trillion miles across where stars are made and ""baby stars are nested in cocoons"" where each cocoon holds their own solar system in Orion's nursery. It looks like something that could have been made up for a science fiction movie, but this is actual footage taken from the impressive Hubble space telescope. It's beautiful and dreamy.

After showing off what Hubble can do, the film brings up the dangers of keeping Hubble out in space and the daring mission proposed to increase its longevity. It is very interesting to see how this all works, especially if you are really into space or interested in becoming an astronaut. Otherwise, it's like watching mechanics in giant suits work on a giant structure you can't even begin to comprehend how it works.

Watching the DVD at home without the 3D did make me want to snooze a little. The calming voice of Leonardo DiCaprio combined with astronauts talking to each other through their helmets made my eyelids flutter a few times. Then oooh, back to pretty pictures! But I still felt sleepy watching them....and there was some overuse of that Hawaiian ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" song. This DVD is only 44 minutes long so just as I was about to conk out, it was over. For sure the highlight of the film was the rose cloud less than halfway through.

Bonus Features:

""Inside Imax Hubble 3D"" has interviews with people involved on the project and shows the Imax camera. If this feature wasn't so concerned with the making of the film, the interviews about the mission itself could have been added to the feature. Oh, if you leave the menu on too long while you're typing your review...it automatically starts the movie again.

I know these films are very expensive to make, but the suggested retail price of $27.98 sounds extreme to me for a forty-four minute film.",1301443200,7,2387,4.753623188405797
4432739,2,B004MPRCTG,"I am a huge fan of NASA and highly respect the brave astronaut community. I visited Cape Canaveral a few years ago and was mesmerized. That said, this film is a disappointment. FIRST - WHAT IT IS NOT: It is NOT a film about the fantastic images shot through the Hubble telescope. Yes, about 1/4 of the film is that, but it is far too short. MOST OF IT IS about the astronauts, suiting up, launching and then repairing the telescope. We were disappointed. This was a grand opportunity to present the awe and wonder of space through visualizing the images brought back from the Hubble itself. Instead we were given images of astronauts unscrewing bolts in space and discussing the lack of toilet facilities while on EVAs. Again, hats off to the courage of the astronauts. However, PLEASE PRODUCE A FILM WITH THE MAJORITY OF FOOTAGE COMING FROM THE HUBBLE ITSELF. The magesty of God's universe is a show of a lifetime in itself.",1301356800,43,925,4.612121212121212

8436202,1,B004MPRCTG,Sorry. Was expecting something completely different....like maybe some pics from the telescope. This short movie just documents how the Hubble telescope came to be and how they had to fix it in an emergency situation. Semi-interesting but very misleading and definitely no need for the high resolution or IMAX. Maybe it's my fault for not reading the description beforehand.....if there is one. All I know is I wasn't happy. And sad to say Leo's voice and narration did nothing for the movie.....actually feel like it detracted from it as if he was completely out of his element and had no idea what he was saying. Alec Baldwin made a better narrator in Journey to the Edge of the Universe....which I would definitely recommend over this.,1518480000,,738,4.912
