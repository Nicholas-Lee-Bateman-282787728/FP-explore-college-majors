4214100,5,B003WHACGK,I am a collector of the old TV shows and this is one of my favorite.  I have all the season up to five and waiting for more to come out.  No complaints on this one.,1309910400,3,164,3.5277777777777777
4214101,5,B003WHACGK,If you need closed captions or subtitles due to hearing issues this is not the season for you.  Shout Factory did not caption or subtitle season 5.  Season's 1-4 all have captioning but sadly season 5 was left with out it.,1291248000,10,222,4.390243902439025
4214102,4,B003WHACGK,"The picture/print quality wasn't as good as that for the fourth season set. I thought the reason for the drop in picture quality, was because the makers of the show changed the way Simon & Simon was shot in the 1985-86 season, and that it had the same look which Dallas had in the 1986-87 season (shot on videotape). But no, the way Simon & Simon was filmed hadn't changed. The masters just looked really grainy in parts. I didn't think Shout! Factory's releases of the second to fourth seasons had been digitally remastered, but they looked in better condition than the episodes in the fifth season set.

The menu screens in this Shout! Select set (the presentation, the absence of the first season theme tune and action scene with explosion before the menu screen appeared) were good. I was initially disappointed, then realised that as it was a Shout! Select title and not like the second to fourth season sets, cost cuts may have had to be made.

I hope Shout! Factory release the remaining three seasons.",1284854400,13,1009,4.662921348314606
4214103,5,B003WHACGK,"I remember this was one of my favorite shows when I was growing up. I tried never to miss an episode back then. When I found out that they were coming out on DVDs, I couldn't wait to get them.

As soon as I got each set, I had to watch it straight through (LOL). I really like the relationship between A.J. and Rick, and between the brothers and their mother and friends.

Getting the movie as an extra was a wonderful surprise.

My favorite was A.J., although I did like Rick too. I hope that they will come through with the rest of the seasons. I will be waiting eagerly to purchase them.",1283385600,3,590,4.157894736842105
4214104,5,B003WHACGK,"Hey fellow S & S fans.
Just an FYI, but from here on out (to season 8) the boys from San Diego will only be available on the shout! factory website.
I think they finally realized they are selling pretty well, and there's no reason to split the $ pie up.",1280102400,25,253,3.980392156862745
4214105,4,B003WHACGK,"This 1985-86 Season of SIMON & SIMON is wonderful, especially since this had to be one of the best seasons of this detective drama throughout it's whole 8-year run on CBS, but the thing that sucks about this DVD is Shout didn't provide any Closed Captioning or subtitles on it at all unlike Shout did with SIMON & SIMON's first 4 released seasons of this detective drama plus I really have such a hard time understanding why does this 5th Season DVD of SIMON & SIMON have to costs so much and why it costs so much more than the first 4 seasons of this show too.

It was also interesting seeing
*Gretchen Corbett in the ""Burden Of The Beast"" episode after her co-starring days as Rockford's sexy attorney girlfriend(Beth Davenport)on THE ROCKFORD FILES before Corbett left Rockford in January of 1978, due to a salary dispute

*Bill Boyett in ""The Apple Doesn't Fall Far From The Tree"" episode after his co-starring days as Sgt. MacDonald on the police drama ADAM-12

*Lance LeGault in the ""Down Home Country Blues"" episode after his co-starring days as the hard-nosed Army nemesis(Col. Decker)on THE A-TEAM & during his co-starring days as Magnum's insensitive Naval nemesis(Col. Green)on MAGNUM, PI

*Tina Louise in the ""Act 5"" episode after her co-starring days as Ginger on GILLIGAN'S ISLAND

*James Whitmore, Jr. in ""The Last Harangue"" episode during his co-starring days as Hunter on McCall's moronic fellow officer(Det. Bernie Terwilliger)on the police drama HUNTER

*John McCook in the ""For The People"" episode before his co-starring days as Eric Forrester on both THE BOLD & THE BEAUTIFUL and THE YOUNG & THE RESTLESS

*Richard Herd in ""The Enchilada Express"" episode after his co-starring days as Hookers hard-nosed superior officer(Capt. Sheridan)on the police drama TJ HOOKER

*Richard Anderson in the ""Act Five"" episode after his co-starring days as Oscar Goldman on THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN & THE BIONIC WOMAN

*Anne Scheeden in the ""Walk A Mile In My Hat"" episode before her co-starring days as Kate on ALF

*David White in the ""Love and/or Marriage"" episode after his co-starring days as Larry Tate on BEWITCHED

*Daniel Lauria in the ""Full Moon Blues"" episode before his co-starring days on THE WONDER YEARS

SIMON & SIMON also reminded me a lot of THE ROCKFORD FILES since the Simon Brothers lived an eccentric lifestyle like the pardoned ex-con now turned private detective Jim Rockford(James Garner) did since the ex-Marine Vietnam veteran now short-tempered gonzo private dick Rick Simon(Gerald McRaney)lived on a boat in the backyard of his often brainy kid brother A.J. Simon(Jameson Parker)house just like Rockford lived alone on a shoe-string budget in a small raggedy trailer in a parking lot in Malibu Beach and always put his gun in a cookie-jar.

Additionally, Rick & AJ had their cop buddies Det. Marcel ""Downtown"" Brown(Tim Reid)and Lt. Abigail Marsh(Joan McMurtry)from San Diego P.D. help out in their investigations just like Rockford had his overworked cop buddy Det. Dennis Becker(Joe Santos)from the LAPD help out with his cases on THE ROCKFORD FILES.

As luck would have it, it just so happens that Gerald McRaney has guest starred on THE ROCKFORD FILES 4 times and Mary Carver which plays Rick and AJ's long-time suffering, but loving mother(Cecilia Simon)has guest starred on THE ROCKFORD FILES too in the ""Dirty Money, Black Light"" episode where you also get to see Roger Mosley guest starring in too before his co-starring days as Thomas Magnum's faithful navy buddy & fellow Vietnam veteran(T.C.)on MAGNUM, P.I.",1279497600,9,3554,5.0426621160409555

4214133,5,B003WHACGK,I enjoyed watching this season the Simon brothers had a lot of cases and challenges to overcome.  I really liked the bonus feature the reunion movie.  I had never seen it before and I really liked seeing it. It is a good addition to the collection.,1334534400,3,248,4.369565217391305

4214135,4,B003WHACGK,"The series reached it's peek with the fifth season and most people consider it to be the best, but I don't. In my opinion it isn't any better than the previous seasons, except for the first. Of course their are a few great episodes (Down Home Country Blues, Quint Is Out, Facets, Family Forecast, A Significant Obsession), a couple of stinkers (Enchilada Express, Act Five, The Skull of Nostradamus), and a few episodes that can be considered just plan boring (Reunion at Alatraz, Sunrise at Camp Apollo, Full Moon Blues). A bonus is the 1995 reunion movie Precious Cargo, and for people, like myself, who have only seen the syndicated versions of these episodes a second bonus is all the footage that was cut from the original broadcast versions. That's 2 or 3 minutes from each episode, over an hour of footage that I'm seeing for the first time. No motion menus for this set, just a still image of Rick and A.J. with an episode selection. Also, it's not closed captioned either. The set is expensive, I bought it on sale from Shout! at $39.99, originally $49.99, and the shipping and handling cost me another $30. So if you are thinking about buying this set just be prepared to pay almost $70 or $80 in total.",1322870400,8,1213,4.594470046082949

Watching Simon & Simon again, on DVD whenever I want, is great. I loved this series when it originally aired and watching the series via DVD is just as enjoyable!",1521849600,,291,4.105263157894737
