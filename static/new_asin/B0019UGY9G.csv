3443971,5,B0019UGY9G,"I'm a romantic so this film was right up my alley.  What makes it so different from every other love story out there is that the love story is between father and son. Martin Sheen finds out he has a son he didn't know he had. Since he's married with a family, you can imagine the chaos this news causes.  Add in the fact his son is French and all the cultural differences there are between the French and Americans--hold on to your hats!  It's very well acted by Martin Sheen, Blythe Danner (Gwyneth Paltrow's mom--you'll see why Gwyneth is so pretty) and the little boy that plays Martin's son.  If you are in the mood for a romantic escape, this film hits the mark dead center.",1289174400,,679,4.322834645669292
3443972,5,B0019UGY9G,I believe this movie will move anyone.  It has a very strong impact on the lives of individuals and it makes one think just how it may feel if a similar incident occurred in your life.,1266364800,,184,4.111111111111111
3443973,4,B0019UGY9G,This movie goes back many years but still manages to hold together in content and emotional tugging of the heart. Relationship movies are always interesting to me and this is no exception. Martin Sheen gives a marvelous performance as a man who's past suddenly catches up with him. The turmoil that this long-married couple must endure takes the viewer through a realistic situation that could happen to anyone; and probably has to many. The ending is both heartbreaking and uplifting and I think this movie should have done much better than it did when released. Watch it some day and you will see.,1257638400,,599,4.825242718446602
3443974,2,B0019UGY9G,"Sheen discovers that an affair some ten years ago resulted in a child. When the boy's mother dies, Sheen must admit his adultery and get to know the son he never knew he had.

Blythe Danner gives a superb performance as Sheen's wife, both incredibly sympathetic and believable in her actions. Sheen doesn't fare as well, playing a rather one-note and not all that likable character. Young Sebastian Duncan does remarkably well in his poorly written role as the youngster who's life changes drastically.

Overall; ""Man, Woman and Child"" is an OK tearjerker. The supporting cast is great with ""Coach"" himself Craig T. Nelson playing a sports fanatic (what else!) and the criminally underrated David Hemmings pops up in two scenes. Rather silly and overly sentimental scenes (particularly near the end) hurt the film and while it's never boring, it never quite takes off the way it should.

The music is great, though.",1246233600,2,915,4.967320261437909
3443975,5,B0019UGY9G,I really enjoyed this movie. Especially the sequences that had to do with the past.,1240012800,,83,4.6
3443976,5,B0019UGY9G,"Well, I am not a professional reviewer but I can tell you this film is excellent! Martin Sheen does a wonderful job in this role and so does the young Sebastian Dungan who plays the role of Jean-Claude Guerin, the child caught in the middle of a bitter-sweet secret that could tear apart a loving family. If you like true dramatic acting and a story so true to life that will make you laugh and cry, this is for you.",1230854400,8,416,4.2125
3443977,5,B0019UGY9G,Martin Sheen and Blythe Danner give stellar performances in this gripping story of a family torn apart by infidelity.  A MUST-SEE for those who appreciate drama and fine acting.,1053388800,7,177,5.103448275862069

3443987,5,B0019UGY9G,I highly recommend Man  Woman and Child.  It is one of those little known gems of films making and is particularly interesting for those who enjoy delving into family dynamics and cross-cultural relationships.  Martin Sheen displays yet another side to his acting abilities.,1403308800,,274,5.325581395348837
3443988,5,B0019UGY9G,"I loved Man Woman and Child when it was first shown a long long time ago .  I was very surprised that my friend had not heard of it, and so I got it for her for Christmas this year.  She liked it as much as I had hoped she would, especially the little boy's acting at the end.  I still remembered all the details that had so impressed me all those years ago, perhaps because, not only was the story a very plausible one, but besides the little boy, it was very well acted by Martin Sheen and Blythe Danner, two lead actors whose work I admire.  I would definitely recommend this movie.",1393718400,,585,4.105263157894737

3443994,2,B0019UGY9G,"Great acting, Martin Sheen and Blythe Danner both show that although they have offspring in the business, the older generation has the chops.

But the ending is a happy one and that feels so tacked-on and sappy.  Perhaps some studio heads insisted on it, but it simply does not fit.  The movie would be much better if Sheen's family leaves him at the end (maybe temporarily).  All stories do not have to end happily.",1341446400,,416,4.581081081081081

3443996,5,B0019UGY9G,"I watched this sad and heart moving movie on betamax video when I was 13 years old with my mom. My mom cried and I followed. I have seen this movie countless times and can't keep hold of my emotion particularly the last scene with Martin Sheen's son. A unique love story, drama and family movie about Martin's extra marital affair during his brief visit to France. Martin as always is in his prime a dashing man who had a one night love affair with a French doctor who is totally attracted to him. After 8 years Martin received a call that this woman passed away leaving a boy unbeknownst to him that he had sired a child with her. Martin decided to have the child come over to America with his wife only aware and keeping the secret to their 8 and 9 year old daughters. Martin is gradually paving his son's assimilation to his American family and this is where the plot thickens and the conflict starts until the painful climactic revelation of the truth. I dare anyone who is not hard enough as a stone not to break down on the last scene. A good movie but with a sad ending and a moral lesson.",1316217600,2,1096,4.274038461538462

8275301,5,B0019UGY9G,"This 1983 family drama stars Martin Sheen as Robert Beckwith, a happily married college professor with two daughters, whose idyllic family life is turned upside down upon discovering the son he never knew existed.  Blythe Danner portrays Robert's wife Sheila, who grows increasingly insecure as she deals with her husband's infidelity in France years ago.  Both Sheen and Danner deliver outstanding performances as a couple trying to keep their marriage and family intact, despite Robert's affair and that his illegitimate son, Jean-Claude Guerin, has come to stay with them after the child's French mother passes away.  Jean-Claude, unaware that Bob is his father, is a well-mannered and likeable child who grows close to the Beckwith family and vice versa.  However, after learning Bob is his father and believing his presence has caused problems for the Beckwith's, Jean-Claude decides to return to France.  In a heartbreaking farewell scene, father and son say goodbye at the airport, embracing and crying, and tell one another ""Je t'aime"" / ""I love you, too.""  This family drama is a real tearjerker, with brilliant casting, acting, writing and directing.",1452556800,2,1160,5.311475409836065
